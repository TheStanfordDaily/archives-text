# SHIPKEY'S INJURY CAUSES SHIFT IN SATURDAY'S LINE-UP
## 
### 
Old Mr. Hard Luck slapped Andy
Kerr across the face against yester
day afternoon when Shipkey,
who has the makings of a mighty good
tackle, broke his nose in the scrim
mage with the freshmen.
Yesterday's action cleaned out
Kerr's stock of first string tackles,
since Johnson is out with an injured
leg, and forces Andy to shuffle the
cards once more for the Santa Clara
game Saturday.
Line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill has a
rush order on his hands, and from the
less promising material he must de
velop two tackles who will not under
mine the strength of the Cardinal line.
Faville, who was handy man on the
line last year; Loomis, and Neill all
tried their hands at the position dur
ing the scrimmage. Since Thornhill
has so many capable guards, it is
likely that Faville or Ludeke will be
transferred.
Joe Douglas, who isn't so slow for
all of his 208 pounds, gave the spec
tators their daily bit of encouragement
last night. After the first-string bucks
—Woodward, Doughty, Wilcox, arid
Cuddeback —had failed to do much
with the 1926 defense, Kerr shot in
his substitutes, among whom was
Douglas at fullback. The hefty blonde
didn't get a chance on the offense, but
he backed up the line on the defense
sa well that, as a rule, Solomon,
Mitchell, Cook, and Clayes, Hunt's
backs, couldn't gain over two or three
yards.
Things didn't go any too well for
the varsity. The 1926 bunch made too
many gains through the line to suit
Thornhill, while the varsity failed to
advance enough to please Kerr, Art
Wilcox, however, going fast and going
far through the babes' line. Whenever
his interference gave him half a
chance, he romped up the field fifteen
and twenty yards at a time.
A1 Clayes, freshman halfback, was
present in his brown helmet yester
day, and repeated his Long Beach per
formance of last week against the
varsity.
He slipped through the big tackles
for a thirty-yard dodging run, then
turned around and repeated the per
formance. Not satisfied, he broke loose |
| again in varsity territory for another
j ten yards.
Clayes is fast and slippery. Coach j
Hunt says he is about the fastest man
he has seen in a yearling football
' suit. When he runw his legs move like j
pistons.
Hunt has developed a feint play j
which crossed up the varsity twice last
night. The first time Quarterback
Nick Kirwan got away for a twenty
five yard run to within two yards of J
goal. The same trick was worked a |
few downs later to put the ball over.
Bill who comes with Clayes '
from Anaheim, was another who got
through the varsity wall. He speared
a pass from Solomon and made twenty
yards with it.
The varsity interference was run- t
ning a little wild, and "Solly" Solo-1
mon, Faust, and Right End Paul Fas
«oth took the opportunity to get in
some neat tackles. Several times,
though. Trainer Denny had to blow
the whistle to keep Wilcox, Cuddeback,
i and others from sprinting through
freshman line and 011 to the goal
1 posts.
