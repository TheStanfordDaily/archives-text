# DEMOCRACY IN DANCING
## 
### 
Skull and Snakes is making" an effort to revive, or
to continue, if the more particular people desire that
term, the custom of giving periodical jolly-ups. The
society's action is commendable in more ways than
one.
There are enough parlor l)oa constrictors on the
<Campus now, worse luck, but this is not a strictly
enjoyable social diet for that particular element in
the student body. The Skull and Snakes jolly-up
is intended more as a social gathering than as an
opportunity for elevated noses and long tailed coats
to be exhibited to the common herd. The jolly-up
is exactly what its name sounds like. It is a place
for people to gather without fear of being out
matched in social poise. It is intended to cultivate
friendships, to promote goodfellowship, and to
maintain democratic standards in undergraduate
social life.
Whoever named the jolly-up has unconsciously
written this editorial. He has described it in one
word better than the writer of this treatment can
in two hundred. It is a jolly-up.
