# MANAGERIAL CANDIDATES
## 
### 
11l order to give men who are working their way
through the University a chance to help themselves
financially as well as to become active participants
in undergraduate activities, the Stanford Adver
tising Club last night systematized managerial try
outee work and sent out a call for candidates.
The Club contends that experience gained by
students through their early connection with busi
ness both within and without the University saves
managers and assistants both time and money after
graduation. Freshmen who have had some ex
perience on the business staffs of their preparatory
school publications are considered well adapted for
this type of student activity.
Active and intelligent participation in any field
of campus journalism in the past has had as its
ultimate reward membership in leading honor
societies. This is an opportunity for freshmen who
want to feel that they are a part of the University
and are active participants in undergraduate affairs.
In thus endeavoring to raise the standards of stu
dent management and to give new men a new and
dual opportunity, the Advertising Club is doing a
service to both the University and itself. And it
is only one of the outward indications that under
graduates are alive to their own interests. It is a
pleasing situation when business managers of rival
publications strive to cooperate rather than to re
sort to unfair and cut-throat competition.
For the guidance of interested students the fol
lowing names and addresses of campus publication
managers follow: The Stanford Cardinal, Chet
Hess, 34 Sequoia: Stanford Chaparral. Jack Young,
Press Building; Daily Palo Alto, William Gage,
Press Building; Stanford Pictorial, Donald Mc-
Oueen, 248 Encina.
