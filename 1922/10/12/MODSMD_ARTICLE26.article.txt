# RATTLING THE CHAINS AGAIN
## 
### 
Sincc the road leading - past Encina Hall from
Encina Gym has been closed, the chains have been
taken down past the Quad to make things, easier
for motorists. There has been much comment in
the past al)out those same chains; how they make
the place look like a prison and so on endlessly.
Today the shoe is on the other foot. Students are
grumbling because cars are driven at a reckless
speed past the Quad, disturbing classes and annoy
ing people walking on the road. Whether it is
because some people are trying to make up for lost
time by the detour, or whether they are trying to
catch up for having been chained off this particular
road for so long doesn't matter. They arc making
a lot of unnecessary noise and are creating too
much unfavorable comment. The chains cannot go
up, but it wouldn't hurt to fine a few irresponsibles.
