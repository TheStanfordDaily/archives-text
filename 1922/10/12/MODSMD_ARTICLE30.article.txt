# WOMEN STUDENTS LEAD MEN IN SCHOLARSHIP AVERAGES
## 
### 
The superiority of women as college
students is again born out in the re
sults of a complete tabulation of Uni
versity of Idaho scholarship averages
for last year. Calculated on a basis of
6.000 being a perfect average, the
women led with 4.9, and the men fol
lowed with 4.345.
