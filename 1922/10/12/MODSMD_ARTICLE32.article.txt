### 
CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 12.â€”
Evacuation of Eastern Thrace by Greek
civilians, as provided by the Nudania
armstice, was under way today.
The first little bands of Hellenic
nationalists, realizing that it is useless to
wait until Saturday midnight, when the
terms of the armistice actually go into
effect, were moving their belongings out
of the lost province.
