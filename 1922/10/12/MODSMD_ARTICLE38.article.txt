# CALLS FOR OLD TEXT BOOKS STILL URGENT
## 
### 
Calls for old text books are still
coming into the University appointment
office at the Administration building.
Mrs. Snell, appointment secretary, re
quests students having text books of no
further use to bring them to the office.
Books on Economics, English, foreign
languages, and mathematics are particu
larly in demand.
Forty textbooks have been given out
already this quarter by the loan library
according to Mrs. Snell. The books,
which were collected last quarter, are
letn to self-supporting students in the
University. A record of each book is
kept, and it is returned at the end of the
quarter.
