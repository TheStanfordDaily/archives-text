# BELGIAN WOMEN HERE AS EXCHANGE STUDENTS
## 
### 
Miss Germaine Collette and Miss
Georgette Fursteinhoff of Belgium
have recently arrived on the campus,
sent here by the Belgian Government
as exchange students. They are grad
uates of the University of Liege which
I* H co-educational institution of 80
women and 2,000 men. Miss Collette
is studying English, while Miss Fur
steinhoff is taking work in the
Economics Department.
They have found American univer
sities very different from the univer
sities of Belgium. The course of study
here is more general and lenient. In
Belgium there are few courses to choose
from and the requirements of each de
partment are exceedingly strict.
Miss Collette is surprised at the
amount of time the Americans spend in
physical exercise. "You devote so
much time to sports," she said, "that
there seems to be no time for study.
Your way is probably better though as
the young men here are so much larger
and stronger than the young men of
Belgium.
"The young ladies here dress almost
entirely in sport clothes which is so
much easier than the way we dress in
Belgium. There we never go out with
out high heels, and we always wear a
hat and gloves. The flapper has been
out of style in Belgium for about
three years."
