# SOCIALIST-MINISTER WILL GIVE SERMONS IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
The Reverend John Howard Melish,
raetor ol the Episcopal Church of the
Holy Trinity, in Brooklyn, New York, 1
one of the largest churches in that city,
will preach in the Stanford Memorial
Church for the next three Sundays.
Under Mr. Melish his church has ex
ercised an influential leadership in the
social service and community life, and
he has several times been chosen to head
enterprises in which all the churches
joined for community affairs.
Mr. Melish, with two or three other
clergymen in the east, may be termed
a "social radical." His purpose in the
ministry he has said is "trying to inter
pret religion to the workers and trying
to interpret the workers to the church.
\V r e are trying to preach a common God
that workingmen can understand and are
trying to tell the church that Jesus Christ
was a working man and lived and died
for a new social order which He called
His Kingdom. Between the present
social order and that Kingdom there are
some divergencies and differences which
must be removed. In other words we
are trying to preach â€¢ a Social Gospel
rather than a program."
A graduate from the University of
Cincinnatti, Mr. Melish studied work in
sociology at Harvard and finished his
theological course at the Episcopal Theo
logical School at Cambridge. In 1909
he became rector of the Church of the
Holy Trinity in Brooklyn, and has been
there since.
Mr. Melish has not only been concerned
with social service work, but also at
various times has been closely identified
with labor movements, and has thereby
been brought into contact with labor
leaders and with the industrial situation
of New York and the east.
