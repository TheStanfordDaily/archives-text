# SEVERAL CHANGES MADE IN LINE-UP OF MISSION TEAM
## 
### 
SANTA CLARA, Oct. 12â€”The
Santa Clara eleven that starts against
the Cardinals Saturday will be con
siderably different from that which
faced the Bruins two weeks ago. In
juries to several of the players have
caused a shift, while the lean* will be
strengthened by some new men.
Coach Buckingham has been having
double practice for linesmen while the
backfield has been having only its or
dinary routine. "Buck" has taken
George Noll, ex-captain, from right
tackle back to his old position at right
guard. Although Noll played a whale
of a game against California, Buck
ingham must think a lot of his ability
at the guard position. John Lewis, 1921
veteran, has been put back at guard
after being cut out for a spell owing
to a wrenched shoulder incurred dur
ing a practice scrimmage.
The two enfts will be taken care of
by Captain "Andy" Kerckhoff and John
Logan. Logan is the lad who scored
the two touchdowns against Andy
Smith's gang, much to the displeasure
of Mr. Smith. Malley and Toso will
fill in at end, if necessary.
"Big" Vowell, the boy who blocked
both of Xesbit's punts, that resulted in
Santa Clara's touchdowns, will hold
his tacklc position. He will have put
ton as a running mate, with Fosdyke
on deck as first string replacement.
Noll and Lewis are slated to start
at guard with Bob Duff or "Baby"
Vowell doing the substituting. Duff
is strictly a Buckingham protege as he
first went out for football last season
when "Buck" was just starting at the
Mission school. Although Duff was a
little late in registering from his home
in Oregon he has been showing up
well.
Just who will snap the ball back
from center is a sort of a mystery.
Jack Nolan was slated to do that job
against California but was switched to
guard at the eleventh hour and "Baby"
Vowell took center. Nolan was hurt
in the Bruin game but showed up for
practice again on Monday. At present
Buckingham is using "Hoot" Miller at
center and it is thought that either he
or Nolan will start against Stanford.
For quarterback, Noonan and Hal
loran are candidates but the former
worked against California and has a
considerable edge. Halloran might start
at half paired with Otto Schvvill. Maybe
Buckingham will start brother Otto with
Herny Schwill as he did at Berkeley.
"Moose" Fawke seems to have a
strangle hold on the fullback's job.
Campus opinion seems to be that the
game will be hotly contested, the light
ing will be tough and even and the
victory will be inherited by the outfit
getting the "breaks."
