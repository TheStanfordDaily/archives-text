Sjj| The object of the association is to provide programs by some
of the best artists who visit San Francisco each season, at a S
popular price and in our own Assembly Hall. Membership dues m
are $5 a year, entitling the subscriber to two tickets for each of
the four concerts, or 62 1-2 cents a ticket. Make cheques pavable
§ to the Peninsula Musical Association.
Memberships will be received up to October 20th, unless the &
$ house should be sold out before that date; but intending sub- H
scribers are warned against delaying, as the sale promises to be
& a large one this season, and late subscribers will be obliged to if
£ choose between having their cheques returned or accepting those
£ inferior side-balcony seats not allotted to regular subscribers.
§ For the convenience of campus residents, subscriptions will be
y received and information furnished by the Stanford Bookstore;
