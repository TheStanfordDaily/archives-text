## 
### 
"Her Husband's Wife," by A. E.
1 homas has been chosen by Sword and
Sandals for presentation on November
3. The play was chosen after much de
liberation from a group of five which
Dramatic Coach J. L. Bentinck had ob
tained.
After successful performances in Phil
adelphia the play had a long run in New
\ ork some years ago, and since then
has been successful on the road. This
will be the first time it has ever been
produced 011 the Pacific Coast.
In his preface to the Drama League
edition, Walter Prichard Eaton, a critic
and playwright, speaks in glowing terms
of "Her Husband's Wife" as a play for
good entertainment, lie speaks highly
of its "style" which lifts the comedy,
though its situations border on farce
now and then, to the rank of a finely
drawn work of art.
The cast which includes six characters
will be selected tomorrow. Rehearsals
will commence that evening in the Green
Room.
