CONSTANTINOPLE, Oct. 13.—The
Kemalists broke thf-ir pledge to the
allies today when 4000 swarmed into
the Ismid area of the neutral zone as
tar as Tapeuren.
The Turks, on hte eve of the day
the armistice is to go into effect, en
tered the forbidden area at Airan and
penetrated several miles to Tapeuren.
Sir Cl'arles Harington immediately
sent a courier by airplane warning the
«ommander of the invaders to with
draw.
This infraction of the agreement led
the allies to become appreheisive lest
they would have much difficulty in
forcing the Turks to live up to their
agreement.
General Harington was in frequent
conference with allied representatives
today, pointing out to them the ne
cessity of calling an early permanent
peace conference.
