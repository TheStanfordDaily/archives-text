# BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL WILL MEET TO DISCUSS REBUKE
## No Official Reprimand Sent to Dr. Barrow As Yet; Members Consider Withdrawal 
### 
Ihe Board of Athlctic Control will
meet tonight to decide whether or not
Stanford will withdraw from the Pa
cific Coast Conference as a result of the
now-famons reprimand, said to be "snow
bound" somewhere in the Siskiyous.
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of ath
letics, and member of the board, had not
received an official rebuke up to yester
day afternoon. Press dispatches fol
lowing the meeting of conference mem
bers in portlan.d Saturday said that
Stanford was to be reprimanded for al
leged discourtesy, and for violations o\
conference rulings by scheduling a game -
with Pittsburg here December 30.
The fact that Stanford sent no rep
resentative to the Portland conclave
â€¢and was represented only by proxy is
said to have aroused the officials' ire.
The only new angle in the case is the
action of the conference in closing with
the Tournament of Roses' committee
for a New Year's game at Pasadena.
In case there is oficial notification of
the reprimand, the Board of Athletic
Control will probably withdraw from
the conference. Acceptance of the re
buke would serve to admit them wrong
in scheduling the game. Rather than do
this, the board is expected to resign,
taking the stand that it has violated no
rules, either in letter or spirit.
If no word is received from U. G.
Duback of Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, president of the conference, it will
probably mean that Stanford's explana
tion of her stand has been found satis
factory.
Should the Board of Athletic Control
withdraw tonight, the remaining games
on the football schedule will in no way be
affected, and the contest with Pittsburg
wlli go through as previously arranged.
