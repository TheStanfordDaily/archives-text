# FIGHT AGAINST FIGHT
## 
### 
One by one, Stanford class fights and tradi
tions have taken the count. Scores by scores,
critics have come to the fore with declarations
against the administration, both student and
faculty, for this summary action. Whose fault
is it? We need only look back to see.
The "plug-ugly" went by the boards years ago
because the participants put increasingly heavy
coats of lead upon their "plugs" until a blow
from one in a fight would have been enough to
]<nock out Battling Siki and three referees. The
fight became nothing short of brutal. It is gone.
The Washington Birthday Parade and public
initiations were discontinued because the roughs'
sense of humor was of too low a standard for a
college community. Curtain.
The baseball fight has been given up.because
"500 students in riot" is bad front-page publicity
for any university. W hen freshmen and sopho
mores arrive at a point of mutual hatred neces
sitating the use of bricks, sticks and croquet mal
lets on each other's heads, it is time to abolish
the cause of that feeling. The baseball fight
now claims an epitaph.
The fight as conducted last week under upper
class supervision was no exception to the rule.
There were just enough irresponsible "super
visors" to allow equally irresponsible underclass
men to give the fight a black eys. The spectators
had kept late hours to see the battle and they
wanted action. They got it. But another re
grettable part of the whole matter is that they
will probably get more. The pages of Stanford's
class fight history need only be consulted to see
what the future holds. Now is the time for
undergraduates who believe in class fights, and
in their potential good ,to frame rules and con
ditions for the last rush of them all.
Among the several changes that might lead to
a solution would be the stopping of night fights.
Cowardly attacks made by mental weaklings un
der the cover of darkness will bear neither the
light of -day nor public criticism. That in itself
would do away with ninety per cent of the annual
hospital list.
The whole idea of the fight as conducted now
is wrong. It's adherents point to the fact that
freshmen get acquainted as one of the chief
advantages. Prisoners in a courtyard are natur
ally thrown together, as well. Misery loves
company.
If a class fight that will at once promote friend
ship, let off accumulated steam, and afford the
participants an opportunity to display ingenuity
is wanted ,it could better be staged along the
following lines:
First, start it in the daytime.
Second, let the participants hate and fight each
other until nightfall. Let it all be concentrated
into one day. If interested students have enough
ingenuity to maintain student government ,to
settle their own problems for themselves, they
surely must have a few ideas about civilized
class fights.
Third, have both classes join in a bonfire and
a Volstead bust in the hills in the evening. The
fight ought to be ended 011 a friendly basis.
Rivalry is fine, but there is no advantage in con
tinued mutual hatred. The introduction of liquor
however, would kill the whole thing.
The fourth and chief point pertains to the
fight itself; whether it is a battle of brains, or
one of main strength and akvvardness. It might
be one of both. Surely all the original ideas on
this subject have not been exhausted. Ihe pro

position is squarely up to the students them
selves. The making or breaking of the last
class fight is in their hands .

men to give the fight a black eys. The spectators
had kept late hours to see the battle and they
wanted action. They got it. But another re
grettable part of the whole matter is that they
will probably get more. The pages of Stanford's
class fight history need only be consulted to see
what the future holds. Now is the time for
undergraduates who believe in class fights, and
in their potential good ,to frame rules and con
ditions for the last rush of them all.
Among the several changes that might lead to
a solution would be the stopping of night fights.
Cowardly attacks made by mental weaklings un
der the cover of darkness will bear neither the
light of -day nor public criticism. That in itself
would do away with ninety per cent of the annual
hospital list.
The whole idea of the fight as conducted now
is wrong. It's adherents point to the fact that
freshmen get acquainted as one of the chief
advantages. Prisoners in a courtyard are natur
ally thrown together, as well. Misery loves
company.
If a class fight that will at once promote friend
ship, let off accumulated steam, and afford the
participants an opportunity to display ingenuity
is wanted ,it could better be staged along the
following lines:
First, start it in the daytime.
Second, let the participants hate and fight each
other until nightfall. Let it all be concentrated
into one day. If interested students have enough
ingenuity to maintain student government ,to
settle their own problems for themselves, they
surely must have a few ideas about civilized
class fights.
Third, have both classes join in a bonfire and
a Volstead bust in the hills in the evening. The
fight ought to be ended 011 a friendly basis.
Rivalry is fine, but there is no advantage in con
tinued mutual hatred. The introduction of liquor
however, would kill the whole thing.
The fourth and chief point pertains to the
fight itself; whether it is a battle of brains, or
one of main strength and akvvardness. It might
be one of both. Surely all the original ideas on
this subject have not been exhausted. Ihe pro

position is squarely up to the students them
selves. The making or breaking of the last
class fight is in their hands .
One by one, Stanford class fights and tradi
tions have taken the count. Scores by scores,
critics have come to the fore with declarations
against the administration, both student and
faculty, for this summary action. Whose fault
is it? We need only look back to see.
The "plug-ugly" went by the boards years ago
because the participants put increasingly heavy
coats of lead upon their "plugs" until a blow
from one in a fight would have been enough to
]<nock out Battling Siki and three referees. The
fight became nothing short of brutal. It is gone.
The Washington Birthday Parade and public
initiations were discontinued because the roughs'
sense of humor was of too low a standard for a
college community. Curtain.
The baseball fight has been given up.because
"500 students in riot" is bad front-page publicity
for any university. W hen freshmen and sopho
mores arrive at a point of mutual hatred neces
sitating the use of bricks, sticks and croquet mal
lets on each other's heads, it is time to abolish
the cause of that feeling. The baseball fight
now claims an epitaph.
The fight as conducted last week under upper
class supervision was no exception to the rule.
There were just enough irresponsible "super
visors" to allow equally irresponsible underclass
men to give the fight a black eys. The spectators
had kept late hours to see the battle and they
wanted action. They got it. But another re
grettable part of the whole matter is that they
will probably get more. The pages of Stanford's
