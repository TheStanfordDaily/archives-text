# DUPLICATING ALUMNI DAY
## 
### 
J. E. McDowell's plan to cooperate with the stu
dent body as much as )K>ssible in making Big Game
day a fall get-together for both alumni and students
is one worthy of serious consideration. After the
success of the session in the pavilion last spring
under the direction of Charles K. Field, no one
should object to making such a function for all prac
tical purposes a semi-annual affair. The spring
meeting would, of course, be the real Alumni Day,
but for those who will come for hundreds of miles
to see the Big Game, the fall meeting would prob
ably be more satisfactory. Stanford has enough
alumni now to prevent her from getting all of them
in several pavilions. Any assistance members of
the student body can give the Alumni Secretary in
this matter should follow as a matter of course.
