Attention has been called to the

which will be the fourth week of the
quarter, is the time specified by the
Academic Council for make-up exam
inations. Â»
The council has ruled that a student
who has received a condition or Un
incomplete through failure 'to take or
to pass a written examination must
make up the deficiency by taking an
other written examination. The pref
erable time for such a second exam
ination is when it is repeated in a
regular course during a later quarter.
Under such circumstances the student
does not have to pay a fee for taking
the second examination.
Otherwise conditions or incompletes
must be removed by taking another
written examination during the fourth
week of a succeeding quarter within
a year, with the provision that quar
ters not in residence do not count.
For such special examinations a fee of
$2 is charged.
The individual instructors have no
option with regard to the time the
special make-up examinations shall be
given, under the ruling of the Aca
demic Council.
