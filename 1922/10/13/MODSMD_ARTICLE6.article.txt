# TWO BABE SQUADS READY FOR DOUBLE HEADER WITH PREP TEAMS
## Strength of Freshman Eleven Shown in Scrimmage With Goofs; Nevers Injured 
### 
If "Husky" Hunt's men in their double
header tomorrow do what they did to
the Goof's last night, there will be two
more victories to the freshmen's credit.
Probably the second varsity has not
had the experience Lowell and San Jose
high will display tomorrow, but in every
thing else they should be equal or
superior.
Anyway, the Babes gave the Grays
a pushing around. Scrimmage lasted
from 5 until after 6 o'clock, and during
that time the first freshman squad not
only held Betts' team even, but ran it
up and down the field.
Lowell high kicking off at 1:30 has
a reputation as a fighting eleven. Twice
they held the hefty Oakland Tech line
for 1 downs close to goal last week.
They have banked on a bewildering
passing game for most of their scores
so far. Passes, Anderson to Van Horn
and Anderson to Rankin, will have to
be guarded against tomorrow.
California freshmen defeated Lowell,
44-6, two weeks ago. After the game
tomorrow, predictions for the "little big
game" probably will be passed out free
ly. This much will have to be remember
ed, however:
Big Ernie Nevers, fullback and star
punter will not be in the game, because
of a torn shoulder ligament sustained
in scrimmage with the varsity Wednes
day; Howard Mitchell, former captain
of Hunt's Berkeley high eleven, will be
playing his first game at quarter—that is,
if the coach thinks he is ready to go in ;
Boles, who showed much promise at
end in pre-season practice, is still out
of uniform with a wrenched leg.
The San Jose high school game at
10:30 a. m. is expected to be the closer
as San Jose boasts a team of veterans.
Last Saturday they stopped San Jose
Teachers' college with six points apiece.
Because of a scarcity of backfield men
for No. 3 team —Lucas, quarter, and
Nick Kirwan, and Allen Rispin may
enter in the morning. "Fat" Nolan, full,
will continue to do the kicking, and Doug
Ackerman, and will run down the punts
again from end.
Bill Cook, halfback who came through

with a sixty yard run last week, is due
to start with Faust, Solomon, and Mitch
ell in the afternoon prelim. Yesterday
he got away from the Goofs several
times for long gains. His best play is
a fast end run.

the Goof's last night, there will be two
more victories to the freshmen's credit.
Probably the second varsity has not
had the experience Lowell and San Jose
high will display tomorrow, but in every
thing else they should be equal or
superior.
Anyway, the Babes gave the Grays
a pushing around. Scrimmage lasted
from 5 until after 6 o'clock, and during
that time the first freshman squad not
only held Betts' team even, but ran it
up and down the field.
Lowell high kicking off at 1:30 has
a reputation as a fighting eleven. Twice
they held the hefty Oakland Tech line
for 1 downs close to goal last week.
They have banked on a bewildering
passing game for most of their scores
so far. Passes, Anderson to Van Horn
and Anderson to Rankin, will have to
be guarded against tomorrow.
California freshmen defeated Lowell,
44-6, two weeks ago. After the game
tomorrow, predictions for the "little big
game" probably will be passed out free
ly. This much will have to be remember
ed, however:
Big Ernie Nevers, fullback and star
punter will not be in the game, because
of a torn shoulder ligament sustained
in scrimmage with the varsity Wednes
day; Howard Mitchell, former captain
of Hunt's Berkeley high eleven, will be
playing his first game at quarter—that is,
if the coach thinks he is ready to go in ;
Boles, who showed much promise at
end in pre-season practice, is still out
of uniform with a wrenched leg.
The San Jose high school game at
10:30 a. m. is expected to be the closer
as San Jose boasts a team of veterans.
Last Saturday they stopped San Jose
Teachers' college with six points apiece.
Because of a scarcity of backfield men
for No. 3 team —Lucas, quarter, and
Nick Kirwan, and Allen Rispin may
enter in the morning. "Fat" Nolan, full,
will continue to do the kicking, and Doug
Ackerman, and will run down the punts
again from end.
Bill Cook, halfback who came through

with a sixty yard run last week, is due
to start with Faust, Solomon, and Mitch
ell in the afternoon prelim. Yesterday
he got away from the Goofs several
times for long gains. His best play is
a fast end run.
