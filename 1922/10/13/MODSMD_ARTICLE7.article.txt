# FRESHMEN MERMEN TO OPPOSE LOWELL HIGH
## 
### 
Coach Ernst Brandsten will have an
opportunity to judge the strength of the
freshmen swimming team next Satur
day morning when the babes oppose the
Lowell High squad in the first meet of
the year. The event will take place in
Encina pool at 11 o'clock.
The veteran aquatic mentor has lined
up quite an array of promising freshmen
material and early indications point to
another successful swimming season.
In Lowell High Coach Brandsten has
scheduled a contcst with the strongest
team of the San Francisco League. Sev
eral weeks ago the Lowell team cap
tured the championship of the bay city
by one of the largest scores ever made.
Ackerman, who at present is spending
his time on the gridiron, appears to be
the best in the 50 and 100 yard events,,
having made these events in 25 and 50
seconds respectively. He hails from
Hawaii, but graduated from Hitchcock
Military Academy. King, a former Pas
adena high star, hopes to give a good
account of liimself in the 50 yards and
diving.
In the backstroke event Brandsten
will start Morrison and Chantry. Mor
rison also competes in the 220-yard race.
Four men have so far been found with
ability in the breast stroke. They are
Waterhouse, Kay, Flagley, and Mack.
Mack last season was Southern Cali
fornia title holder in this race. Smith
and Barnett will be two other entrants
in the diving competition.
In Langley, a product of San Jose
High, Coach Brandsten hopes to develop
a star plunger. He has already done
over seventy feet in the short time he
has been practicing this season. Last
year in a dual met against the freshmen
he romped away with first honors. Ros
enbaum of last ycari's |team will be
eligible to compete on the freshmen team.
His ability is far above that of the aver
age college plunger.
The relay team will probably consist
of King, Ackerman, Canfield, and Harris
although changes might be made later.
