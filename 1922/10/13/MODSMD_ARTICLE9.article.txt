# FOOTBALL SEASON GAINS HEADWAY AS CARDS MEET WITH SANTA CLARA
## Both Kerr and Buckingham Forced to Change Line-ups; Shipkey To Start Game After All 
### 
Coach "Buck" Buckingham, who comes by his football knowledge honestly,
having learned it at Princeton, has an idea his Santa Clara Friars are going
to hang a "veni, vidi, vici" on the Card varsity) tomorrow afternoon.
So do six hundred Latin scholars from the San Jose suburb who are expected
to clamber down the Stadium slopes at 2:40 to watch the battle.
Andy Kerr, who learned his gridiron P's and Q's just as honestly at
Dickenson College, isn't worried by what his opponents think of the outcome.
His cleated warriors, improved since the Olympic debacle, are ready to take
anything the Missionites offer and give a little bit more.
In any event, the spectators are the ones who will benefit by the Saints'
desire to reduce Kerr's embryonic grid machine to a scrap of pig-iron. The

game may lack the intimacy of the
Irish versus Irish fistic combats, but
it will be just as spectacular.
Harry Shipkey, whose official title
is "tackle,"' apparently has an on
again-off-again Finnigan nose. He was
last seen Thursday afternoon march
ing toward Dr. Barrow's office and
rubbing his nose. Dr. Barrow and
Trainer Denny pronounced it broken,
but yesterday afternoon Skipkey was
tearing around the turf as if nothing
had happened. Which means that the
198-pound tackle will chase up and
down the turf tomorrow, participating
in the grid festivities.
That leaves Janssen and 'Johnson as
the only members of the Card tanbark
squad on tho hospital register. Kerr
has hopes of Johnson and his weak leg,
but Janssen is definitely on the out
side for three weeks at least.
Outside of those two Kerr will leave
his hopes and reputation in practically
the same hands as last Saturday.
"Shorty" Mertz, a survivor of the 1921
Big Game, will officiate at end against
Johnny Logan, the lad who scored
two touchdowns against California.
Neill lias an option on left tackle, and
will glare across the line at "Moose"
Fawke, 181-pound back, whom Buck
ingham has shifted to the line.
"Bud" Woodward, who calls the sig
nals so distinctly that he can be heard
a block away, is the only new man
in the Card backfield. His main duties
will be to direct the team to at least
three touchdowns, run interference,
and throw short passes. Anything out
side of that is appreciated but not
required.
Art Wilcox will have a stronger
line in front of him than a week ago,
which means more yards. The same
goes for Doughty and Cudfeback, at
half and full, respectively.
If the varstiy checks Kerckhoff and
Logan, ends; Noll, guard; Noonan,
quarter, and the deadly aerial game,
they will have to toll the bells slowly
down at the Mission in honor of Buck
ingham's departed hopes.
Favorites as substitutes on the
Stanford squad include Joe Douglass,
the line-plunging fullback; "Tiny"
Hartranft, end; Ludeke, tackle or
guard; Pheney and Faville, guard;
Wheat, quarter, and Murray, halfback.

In any event, the spectators are the ones who will benefit by the Saints'
desire to reduce Kerr's embryonic grid machine to a scrap of pig-iron. The

game may lack the intimacy of the
Irish versus Irish fistic combats, but
it will be just as spectacular.
Harry Shipkey, whose official title
is "tackle,"' apparently has an on
again-off-again Finnigan nose. He was
last seen Thursday afternoon march
ing toward Dr. Barrow's office and
rubbing his nose. Dr. Barrow and
Trainer Denny pronounced it broken,
but yesterday afternoon Skipkey was
tearing around the turf as if nothing
had happened. Which means that the
198-pound tackle will chase up and
down the turf tomorrow, participating
in the grid festivities.
That leaves Janssen and 'Johnson as
the only members of the Card tanbark
squad on tho hospital register. Kerr
has hopes of Johnson and his weak leg,
but Janssen is definitely on the out
side for three weeks at least.
Outside of those two Kerr will leave
his hopes and reputation in practically
the same hands as last Saturday.
"Shorty" Mertz, a survivor of the 1921
Big Game, will officiate at end against
Johnny Logan, the lad who scored
two touchdowns against California.
Neill lias an option on left tackle, and
will glare across the line at "Moose"
Fawke, 181-pound back, whom Buck
ingham has shifted to the line.
"Bud" Woodward, who calls the sig
nals so distinctly that he can be heard
a block away, is the only new man
in the Card backfield. His main duties
will be to direct the team to at least
three touchdowns, run interference,
and throw short passes. Anything out
side of that is appreciated but not
required.
Art Wilcox will have a stronger
line in front of him than a week ago,
which means more yards. The same
goes for Doughty and Cudfeback, at
half and full, respectively.
If the varstiy checks Kerckhoff and
Logan, ends; Noll, guard; Noonan,
quarter, and the deadly aerial game,
they will have to toll the bells slowly
down at the Mission in honor of Buck
ingham's departed hopes.
Favorites as substitutes on the
Stanford squad include Joe Douglass,
the line-plunging fullback; "Tiny"
Hartranft, end; Ludeke, tackle or
guard; Pheney and Faville, guard;
Wheat, quarter, and Murray, halfback.
Coach "Buck" Buckingham, who comes by his football knowledge honestly,
having learned it at Princeton, has an idea his Santa Clara Friars are going
to hang a "veni, vidi, vici" on the Card varsity) tomorrow afternoon.
So do six hundred Latin scholars from the San Jose suburb who are expected
to clamber down the Stadium slopes at 2:40 to watch the battle.
Andy Kerr, who learned his gridiron P's and Q's just as honestly at
Dickenson College, isn't worried by what his opponents think of the outcome.
His cleated warriors, improved since the Olympic debacle, are ready to take
anything the Missionites offer and give a little bit more.
In any event, the spectators are the ones who will benefit by the Saints'
desire to reduce Kerr's embryonic grid machine to a scrap of pig-iron. The
