# FOOTBALL SEASON GAINS HEADWAY AS CARDS MEET WITH SANTA CLARA
## Both Kerr and Buckingham Forced to Change Line-ups; Shipkey To Start Game After All 
### 
Coach "Buck" Buckingham, who comes by his football knowledge honestly,
having learned it at Princeton, has an idea his Santa Clara Friars are going
to hang a "veni, vidi, vici" on the Card varsity) tomorrow afternoon.
So do six hundred Latin scholars from the San Jose suburb who are expected
to clamber down the Stadium slopes at 2:40 to watch the battle.
Andy Kerr, who learned his gridiron P's and Q's just as honestly at
Dickenson College, isn't worried by what his opponents think of the outcome.
His cleated warriors, improved since the Olympic debacle, are ready to take
anything the Missionites offer and give a little bit more.
In any event, the spectators are the ones who will benefit by the Saints'
desire to reduce Kerr's embryonic grid machine to a scrap of pig-iron. The

game may lack the intimacy of the
Irish versus Irish fistic combats, but
it will be just as spectacular.
Harry Shipkey, whose official title
is "tackle,"' apparently has an on
again-off-again Finnigan nose. He was
last seen Thursday afternoon march
ing toward Dr. Barrow's office and
rubbing his nose. Dr. Barrow and
Trainer Denny pronounced it broken,
but yesterday afternoon Skipkey was
tearing around the turf as if nothing
had happened. Which means that the
198-pound tackle will chase up and
down the turf tomorrow, participating
in the grid festivities.
