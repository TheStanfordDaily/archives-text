IDAHO WILL GET FOOTBALL
RETURNS AT MATINEE DANCES
Play-by-play returns from all out
side games that Idaho grid men play
this year will be announced at matinee
dances held on afternoons that these
games are played. Because of the
noticeable scarcity of home games
some scheme was thought necessary
whereby students could be kept \
touch with the team, and the matinee
dance plan was adopted.
Advertise in the Daily Palo Alto.
