# Late Developments in Withdrawal
## 
### 
Since Stanford, by unanimous action of the Board of Athletic Control,
pulled out of the Pacific Coast Conference last Friday night. Coast athletic
circles have been humming with rumors of further changes involving Cali
fornia and U. S. C.
Dr. U. G. Duback, president of the Conference, has refused to answer
definitely Stanford's questions on rules of the Conference. Leslie Ayres,
secretary of the Conference, also passes them over as "mere quibbling."
Assurance that the conference football schedule will be played out was
given by President Duback.
Lute Nichols, graduate manager of the University of California, has prac
tically put Berkeley in the same position that Stanford was "reprimanded"
for by announcing that California has closed with the Tournament committee
for a New Year's game without consulting the Conference. Financial terms
have been agreed upon.
To the conference is left the choice of the Eastern team and also "the last
word" in selection of the Western representative, according to Nichols' state
ment. Which may be taken to mean that California is so sure of a victory
in the conference that she has gone ahead and made the arrangements to
represent the West, and left it to the Conference to confirm her action.
The University of California representative was one of the seven who
'voted to call down Stanford for similarly scheduling post-season games with
out the consent of the Conference.
The Stanford Board of Control in effect puts Duback and the Conference
on the witness stand in its resignation-questionnaire, which follows:
"First. Has it been the custom of the members of the Conference to report
to its officials all negotiations for contests with institutions not members
of the Conference?
"Second. Does membership in the Conference imply an obligation to dis
close to the Conference any and all preliminary negotiations concerning
athletic contests with institutions not members of the Conference, and, if so,
can the Conference give to its members definite assurance that in the future
such information will be imparted to them by each member of the Conference?
"Third. Does membership in the Conference imply the relinquishment of
freedom of action on the part of each member in arranging schedules and
negotiations with institutions not members of the Conference?"
