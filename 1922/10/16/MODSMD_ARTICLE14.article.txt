# VARSITY AND FRESHMEN WIN GRIDIRON CONTEST
## Kerr's Eleven Downs Santa Clara, 7 to 0 
### 
Seven minutes after the kick-off Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal varsity
had for all practical purposes beaten Santa Clara, 7 to 0. . It took that long
for Andy Kerr's men to march the ball down the field from their own 37-yard
line and to shove Buckingham's hopes for a Mission victory to the edge of the
grave.
In that initial spurt and for the fifteen minutes following, Stanford showed
everything that the majority of spectators had come to see, and everything
that Saints didn't want to see. A hard-charging line, backs that could find the
holes, good field-generalship made the Cards look more like an efficient grid
machine than at any time to date.
After that first quarter and a half, the contest might just as well have been
called off, and the spectators sent home. For the remainder of the game, the
Cardinal attack became a monotonous success of line bucks and kicks, and the

Friars were unable to approach the
Cardinal goal closer than field goal
range.
DOUGHTY GOES STRONG
Rae Doughty, the gentleman from the
Lone Star state, was here and there and
everywhere in the first half. He ran
back the kick-off twelve yards. Then,
after he had assisted Wilcox and Cudde
back in making two first downs, he tore
off ten yards on a double criss-cross.
Wilcox lost a yard on the same play,
and "Bud" Woodward glanced over
his stock of plays and chose the forward
pass. Wilcox threw to Mertz, who was
downed on the 10-yard line.
Then it was that Doughty stepped in
again. After Cuddeback had only made
five yards in three downs, the "Texas
Terror" dashed through left tackle for
five yards and the only touchdown.
TOO MANY PENALTIES
Stanford threatened the Saints' goal
again throughout the half, but as soon
as it got within striking distance, the
whistle would blow, and back the Car
dinal would go fifteen yards, which in
dicated that one of Kerr's men had been
holding. Referee Humphries presented
the Friars with the length of the field
and a ten yard start on the return trip.
At that Kerr hasn't much cause for
complaint. Had not the officials de
tected a Santa Clara man offside in the
third quarter, the score would have been
tied. Noonan threw a pass to Halloran,
who scampered through the Card back
field for a touchdown only to be callcd
back.
CARDS HAVE IMPROVED
In spite of the efforts of Logan, end,
Halloran, half, and a few other Saints,
the Cards outplayed Santa Clara just
as decisively as the Olympic did Stan
ford a week ago. DeGroot, assisted by
Houck, Johnson, Shipkey, Dole, and
Lawson, who relieved Mertz, formed a
first line defense that the Red ami
White hacks could do little with.
Stanford could only make one score
either because its punches lacked steam
within the Santa Clara 3D yard line, or
because Kerr ordered his men to work
under wraps.

Seven minutes after the kick-off Saturday afternoon, the Cardinal varsity
had for all practical purposes beaten Santa Clara, 7 to 0. . It took that long
for Andy Kerr's men to march the ball down the field from their own 37-yard
line and to shove Buckingham's hopes for a Mission victory to the edge of the
grave.
In that initial spurt and for the fifteen minutes following, Stanford showed
everything that the majority of spectators had come to see, and everything
that Saints didn't want to see. A hard-charging line, backs that could find the
holes, good field-generalship made the Cards look more like an efficient grid
machine than at any time to date.
After that first quarter and a half, the contest might just as well have been
called off, and the spectators sent home. For the remainder of the game, the
Cardinal attack became a monotonous success of line bucks and kicks, and the

Friars were unable to approach the
Cardinal goal closer than field goal
range.
DOUGHTY GOES STRONG
Rae Doughty, the gentleman from the
Lone Star state, was here and there and
everywhere in the first half. He ran
back the kick-off twelve yards. Then,
after he had assisted Wilcox and Cudde
back in making two first downs, he tore
off ten yards on a double criss-cross.
Wilcox lost a yard on the same play,
and "Bud" Woodward glanced over
his stock of plays and chose the forward
pass. Wilcox threw to Mertz, who was
downed on the 10-yard line.
Then it was that Doughty stepped in
again. After Cuddeback had only made
five yards in three downs, the "Texas
Terror" dashed through left tackle for
five yards and the only touchdown.
TOO MANY PENALTIES
Stanford threatened the Saints' goal
again throughout the half, but as soon
as it got within striking distance, the
whistle would blow, and back the Car
dinal would go fifteen yards, which in
dicated that one of Kerr's men had been
holding. Referee Humphries presented
the Friars with the length of the field
and a ten yard start on the return trip.
At that Kerr hasn't much cause for
complaint. Had not the officials de
tected a Santa Clara man offside in the
third quarter, the score would have been
tied. Noonan threw a pass to Halloran,
who scampered through the Card back
field for a touchdown only to be callcd
back.
CARDS HAVE IMPROVED
In spite of the efforts of Logan, end,
Halloran, half, and a few other Saints,
the Cards outplayed Santa Clara just
as decisively as the Olympic did Stan
ford a week ago. DeGroot, assisted by
Houck, Johnson, Shipkey, Dole, and
Lawson, who relieved Mertz, formed a
first line defense that the Red ami
White hacks could do little with.
Stanford could only make one score
either because its punches lacked steam
within the Santa Clara 3D yard line, or
because Kerr ordered his men to work
under wraps.

off ten yards on a double criss-cross.
Wilcox lost a yard on the same play,
and "Bud" Woodward glanced over
his stock of plays and chose the forward
pass. Wilcox threw to Mertz, who was
downed on the 10-yard line.
Then it was that Doughty stepped in
again. After Cuddeback had only made
five yards in three downs, the "Texas
Terror" dashed through left tackle for
five yards and the only touchdown.
TOO MANY PENALTIES
Stanford threatened the Saints' goal
again throughout the half, but as soon
as it got within striking distance, the
whistle would blow, and back the Car
dinal would go fifteen yards, which in
dicated that one of Kerr's men had been
holding. Referee Humphries presented
the Friars with the length of the field
and a ten yard start on the return trip.
At that Kerr hasn't much cause for
complaint. Had not the officials de
tected a Santa Clara man offside in the
third quarter, the score would have been
tied. Noonan threw a pass to Halloran,
who scampered through the Card back
field for a touchdown only to be callcd
back.
CARDS HAVE IMPROVED
In spite of the efforts of Logan, end,
Halloran, half, and a few other Saints,
the Cards outplayed Santa Clara just
as decisively as the Olympic did Stan
ford a week ago. DeGroot, assisted by
Houck, Johnson, Shipkey, Dole, and
Lawson, who relieved Mertz, formed a
first line defense that the Red ami
White hacks could do little with.
Stanford could only make one score
either because its punches lacked steam
within the Santa Clara 3D yard line, or
because Kerr ordered his men to work
under wraps.
