# LOWEIL GIVES SCANT OPPOSITION TO BABES
## 
### Phil Newill, '24 
The freshmen had another workout
Saturday.
They defeated Lowell high school,
34-0, and in so doing proved them
selves to be in the same class with
the California frosh. But they didn't
show any enthusiasm for their work.
The prep team was weaker in every
department, and except tor a tem
porary revival in the third quarter,
gave Solomon, Faust, and their mates
little chance to extend th-ms Ives.
In the morning the Babe third team
ran up against some real opposition.
They lost, 3-0. San Jose high might
have made it 21-0, except that the
freshmen tightened up three times
when the ball was on the three-yard
line.
Three men are out of the game for
a week or more as a result of Satur
day's scrimmages. "Doc" Goodrich was
carried off the field with a bruised and
possibly broken thigh, Sholes dislo
cated a finger, and A1 Rispen. quarter
in the morning game, went off in the
second half with an injured leg which
may keep him out of play for two
weeks.
Sholes, left tackle, and Goodrich, left
guard, are two of the best linemen
on Hunt's squad.
A1 Clayes raised his usual brand of
havoc with the opposition. In the
fourth quarter he received the ball on
a line plunge through right tackle,
picked a big hole, and ran past the
entire Lowell team sixty yards to the
goal.
Football forecasters —among them
"Swede" Righter, who was in the
bleachers Saturday—say that Clayes
has the makings of a second "Rabbit"
Bradshaw.
The freshmen line made a special
point of smothering Lowell's passes,
which were supposed to be her strong
play. What passes were completed
usually lost the prep team three or
four yards. Not until the close of the
first half was there a pass which made
even a small gain.
While Stanford was conceded the
game beforehand, the score of 34-0 is
a strong threat against the Bear fresh
men, who defeated Lowell 44-6 two
weeks ago.
It took exactly three minutes to
score the first six points. Lowell
kicked off, and Faust, Cook, and Solo
mon started a march up the field.
Within fifteen yards of goal Faust
carried the ball seven yards off left
tackle, made another five-yard gain
through right guard, and Bill Cook
chose the same hole to carry it over.
End runs by Kirwan and Cook, and
Solomon's bucks carried the ball to
the seven-yard line by the end of the
quarter. After changing sides Faust
carried it over for the second score
and Cook made his try for goal.
An intercepted pass and ihirty-five
yard run by Solomon accounted for
the third touchdown.
The half ended with the ball in mid
field, after Rankin, the Lowell fullback,
had been nailed twenty-five yards back
of his line on an attempted pass.
Cook retired in favor of Clayes in
the second half line-up, and Howard
Mitchell went in at quarter for Kir
wan. The ball see-sawed in mid field
until the end of the quarter. Mitchell
then started the procession by catch
ing a pass for first down.
On the next play Solomon slapped a
special delivery stamp on the bail and
threw it to Clayes, who ran twenty
five yards to within striking distance
of the goal. Faust went over right
tackle twice, then Solomon took it
over. Faust kicked.
Clayes made the score 34-0 by his
sixty-yard run a few minutes later.
Lowell's best attempts to gain were
made by Van Horn, half.
San Jose high scored their only
points against the third string frosh
on a drop kick by C. Disbrow, tackle,
shortly after the game started.
The ball was in freshman territory
most of the morning game. Bert
Fehren, San Jose halfback, pulled a
stunt similar to Clayes' in the third
quarter. He took the ball fifty yards
down the field on a returned punt, but
the freshmen snapped back into the
game and held for downs.
