# LOWEIL GIVES SCANT OPPOSITION TO BABES
## 
### Phil Newill, '24 
The freshmen had another workout
Saturday.
They defeated Lowell high school,
34-0, and in so doing proved them
selves to be in the same class with
the California frosh. But they didn't
show any enthusiasm for their work.
The prep team was weaker in every
department, and except tor a tem
porary revival in the third quarter,
gave Solomon, Faust, and their mates
little chance to extend th-ms Ives.
In the morning the Babe third team
ran up against some real opposition.
They lost, 3-0. San Jose high might
have made it 21-0, except that the
freshmen tightened up three times
when the ball was on the three-yard
line.
Three men are out of the game for
a week or more as a result of Satur
day's scrimmages. "Doc" Goodrich was
carried off the field with a bruised and
possibly broken thigh, Sholes dislo
cated a finger, and A1 Rispen. quarter
in the morning game, went off in the
second half with an injured leg which
may keep him out of play for two
weeks.
Sholes, left tackle, and Goodrich, left
guard, are two of the best linemen
on Hunt's squad.
A1 Clayes raised his usual brand of
havoc with the opposition. In the
fourth quarter he received the ball on
a line plunge through right tackle,
picked a big hole, and ran past the
entire Lowell team sixty yards to the
goal.
