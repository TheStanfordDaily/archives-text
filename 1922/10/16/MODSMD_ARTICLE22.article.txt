# THIS WAY OUT
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast Conference has in effect
shown Stanford the door. Stanford did not stoop to
effects but merely walked out. She took it for grant
ed that the conference didn't want her, and whether
that august body did or did not makes no difference.
Having made a decision, Stanford has stuck by it
and will continue to do so. She cannot remain in a
group which seeks to criticize every move Stanford
may make with regard to the use of her own stadium.
And it was the stadium and nothing else that caused
the Conference' outcry.
It might not be taken amiss if the linotype oper
ator should make a mistake at this point and mis
spell Pacific Roast Conference. It would be in keep
ing with the general attitude of the other seven
colleges, or rather the remaining seven, toward Stan
ford. Every time they conferred they roasted Stan
ford. When Stanford tried to explain, they called
it "quibbling." When Stanford failed to send a
representative, they called it "discourteous." Yes,
the linotype operator is to be forgiven.
The football schedule this year will not be affected.
As to the future, Stanford will have the Big Game
with California for years and that is what counts.
The University of Southern California will be on
Stanford's schedule next year, but that is the only
other game with a Conference member for the future.
As to northern trips, one in two years is a great
plenty. They take too much time.
The actual affects of Stanford's resignation will
not be known for probably a year. It might be
either for better or for worse. But whatever the
outcome, Stanford has stood squarely for one thing
throughout the entire argument and to the last mom
ent has stuck by her guns. It may be a case of self
respect over-running financial policy. If so, more
power to the Stanford Red. The future will tell.
Why worry now? The thing for Stanford to do is
to get busy on present schedules and get the most
out of them. If worst comes to worst, let us have a
good history, anyway.
