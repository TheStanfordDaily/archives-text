) Nine students were added to Daily Palo Alto staff
today in order to fill up vacancies caused by grad
uation and resignation. It is the opinion of the
editorial department that the tryoutees this quarter
have been better qualified for college newspaper
work than any who have conic on the staff in sev
eral quarters. So high was the average caliber of
work that it was only with the greatest diffirulty
that the nine best could be chosen from the forty
who tried out.
'Hie new members are listed below in their order
of merit as judged by the tryoutee board.
Kathryn McCleave, '24, Berkeley, former member
of the Daily Californian staff.
( Maxwell Stiles, '25. Los Angeles, former member
of the Los Angeles Examiner sports staff.
Howard Bissell, '24, Cleveland, Ohio, former
member of the Dartmouth staff.
Hugh Hollembeak, '25, Long Beach.
Meribcth Cameron, '25, Santa Monica.
Allen Charles, '25, Palo Alto.
Miriam Hilton, '25, Portland, Oregon.
Donald Adams, '26, Riverside.
Beatrice Brailsford, '25, llagerman, Idaho.
A tryout of any kind mnst be of necessity be un
fair and unjust to a certain extent. Mistakes are un
avoidable in any process of elimination. And in this
particular instance because the caliber of work was
of so high a standard, decisions were made on what
would ordinarily have been unimportant details.
