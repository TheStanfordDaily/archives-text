Mike Ely, '24
We went to the show the other night and saw "The
Five Dollar Baby.' Highly over-capitalized, we might
say. It would ha n been enjoyable if the organ had not
kept us awake.

B. V. D. "That's a good joke Smithy just pulled."
E. Z. C. "Any joke would hafta be good to keep going
twenty years."

The cork-tip chewing gum is awarded to the guy who
thinks Candelabra is a fox-trot.

We will now pass on the case of the guy who called
up the Mechanical Engineering department and asked
them to send out a plumber right away.

From the Daily Palo Alto:
I have a ticket to Los Angeles, good till Satur
day night. Phone blank blank £lank.
Our phone was out of order, or we would have told
him to use his ticket before Saturdaynight, by all means.

"Hello, is this 1492 1 ?"
"Yes. To whom do you wish to speak?"
"Columbus."

The jolly-up was a great success. We suggest that
after this they provide dancing space, which seemed to
be the one thing lacking. Music, co-eds, everything,
were there, and if we could have found something
besides rough's feet to dance on we would have been
happy.

Now that rushing season is over we wish to join with
the class of 1925 in a rousing "To hell with '26!" Says
we, Ding 'em ail but six and save them for the tub!

"Shay. Whatsa date?"
"Sunday."
"Gosh. Mish my Law course again!"

Now we aren't superstitious or anything but last
Friday was the Thirteenth, and we had our usual run
of bad luck, as a result of the date. Roommate borrowed
back his overcoat, English teacher didn't forget to give
promised examination, and we couldn't kid the house
manager into pie a la mode for dinner. Worst of all,
we forgot what the date was and couldn't even go
around reminding everybody to be careful.

Howdja like the snappy picture in Cabbages last
Friday? Huh, huh, we're goin gto have'em off en. And
a new top for the column, too. Cabbages hereby thanks
Chaparral and its ed. for last Friday's cut.

"THAT'S MY FINISH," REMARKED THE CAR AS
THE PAINTER APPROACHED WITH THE BUCKET.
