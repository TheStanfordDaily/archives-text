The California Bears defeated the
St. Mary's college 41 to 0 at the Cali
fornia Field Saturday. St. Mary's held
Andy Smith's team scoreless in the
first quarter. Captain Black nearly
made a field goal for the losing team
from the 33-yard line, but the ball
struck the cross bar. St. Mary's was
never again in a dangerous position.
The Blue and Gold squad relied on
straight football.
