"Her Husband's Wife," by A. E.
Thomas, was selected from several
available scripts after some delay
caused by tardiness of Eastern play
brokers in sending "books" on ap
proval.
"For a play of this sort which re
quires 'straight' rather than 'charac
ter' acting, delicate handling rather
than the broad gesture of the farceur,
the cast must combine sincerity of
interpretation with the fine art of
restraint," says Bentinck. As the talent
of amateurs invariably seems co lean
toward character acting. Sword and
Sandals made diligent search among
the tryoutees for those whose "person
alities" approached closest those of
the figures in the Thomas play.
