# Cardinal Rugby Fifteen Plans Invasion of Pacific Northwest
## 
### 
Stanford rugby football players will
start practice about the middle of Nov
ember in anticipation of another invasion
of British Columbia.
Canadian authorities have written to
Harry Maloney, rugby coach, concerning
such a trip. Although Stanford did not
make a complete sweep of the contests
last year, the team's good sportsmanship
and playing won great praise and respect
for Stanford with the result that an in
vitation has been extended again this
ytfar.
The Vancouver Rugby Union wrote as
follows:
Dear Mr. Maloney:
I am directed by my Union to get in
touch with you and find out your propos
als for the season of 1922-23.
We are starting the season with every
prospect of its being the best yet. The
Edmonton team is coming down in the
early part of November and if we are
lucky enough to have you with us at
Christmas it is likely to improve the al
ready great interest shown in the game.
We are assured of keen competition in
the McKechnie Cup series as Victoria
is reported strong and also a new team
from Cowichan has entered the series.

This will give us four teams playing for
the cup. The Miller Cup will have
five teams competing and the Intermedi
ates and High School teams are already
showing great enthusiasm. Given decent
weather the 1922-23 season should be a
great one.
As you are aware the World Trophy
is for competition between the winners
of the California University contests and
our own Varsity, is it likely that you will
send a team from both or will you be
bringing a combined team to play here?
Will you please give me in a gfneral
way your prospects and intentions for the
coming season.
There is a strong feeling on behalf
of our players to have one of your teams
with us.
Yours sincerely,
R. C. Cooper,
Secretary Vancouver Rugby Union.
Harry Maloney is anxious to get in
touch with all players who have had
rugby experience and who would be in
terested in trying out for the team that
is expcctcd to make the journey north.
Practices will not start till after the
California game so as not to interfere
with American football activities.
