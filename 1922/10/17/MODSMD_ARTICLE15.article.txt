## Program of Songs and Yells Ends Second ”Get on The Boat" Assembly

assembly last night in the auditorium.
"It is the duty of every man who can
play at all to go out for football in

work," Hunt said. "If anyone knows
of an eligible man who is taking Phys

the freshman grid team," the coach

men registered for freshman football,
fifteen or twenty are absent each day

the men and women of the freshman
class to find their places in the under
graduate activities described at the
first "on the boat" assembly last week.
"When you have found your place,"
he said, "give the best you have in
you—and you will find at the end of
your four years that you have received
more than you gave."
