# SWORD AND SANDALS SELECTS PLAY CAST
## Gertrude McLeod Gets Women's Lead in "Her Husband's Wife" 
### 
Gertrude McLeod, '25, has been chosen
to play the part of Irene Randolph, the
feminine lead in "Her Husband's Wife"
to be produced by Sword and Sandals on
November 3. Her uncle, John Bcldcn,
a sardonic old man of wisdom and ex
perience has not yet been definitely
chosen. Emily Ladew, a prim young
tiling who is like Irene in that she too
harbors a "funny notion," has been given
to Emily Wardman, '22. • <•
Irene is a sweet, young girl who for
some reason peculiar to her type, has
become possessed of the notion that she is
going to die. Norah, her maid, has the
greatest difficulty in giving to her mis
tress the proper medicine at the right
time from the half dozen bottles which
Irene has on hand. The peculiar thing
is that Irene doesn't know just what is
the matter with her, and more so, that the
medicine does not seem to be of any
benefit to her. "I don't want to give up
my life without a struggle, though," she
says.
IRENE SELECTS HER
HUSBAND'S WIFE
Irene is good, however, and is con
stantly thinking of the care and keeping
of Stuart Randolph, her husband, when
she is about to die. He must marry
again; and to make sure that he selects
the right woman, she chooses his "second
wife" for him. Emily Ladew is a moth
erly sort of person, and like Irene, has
a peculiar notion. Hers is that she is
going to die an old maid. After seme
persuasion by Irene and John Bcldcn,
Irene's uncle, she promises to marry
Stuart on his wife's death. And now the
"plot thickens." Does Irene really die?
What becomes of the poor girl ? And
what happens to her husband if the new
regime goes into effect?
BELDEN THINKS HE
UNDERSTANDS WOMEN
John Belden believes he can argue with
women and especially with young ones
who harbor such silly notions of dying.
He resolves secretly to let her die. His
part is the Good Samaritan, and he is
so cocksure that he can guide the frail
little barks all around him to places of
safety, that be receives a terrible "wal
lop" later in the play.
Gertrude McLeod has had no dramatic
experience while at Stanford, but Coach
Bentinck believes that she is capable of
taking the part of Irene. Emily Ward
man was cast in "The Yellow Jacket,"
the English Club play two years ago.
P. H. Talbert appeared in the Senior
Farce, "Adam and Eve," last June, and
also took the lead in the Forest Play,
"Big Basin" which was staged in Sequoia
National Park the past year. Elsa J.
Barber, who plays the part of Norah read
her part well last night, and according
to Bentinck, will give a good portrayal
of the sensible, understanding, but al
ways watchful maid.
"All cast members must be in the As
sembly Hall tonight at 7 o'clock sharp
to begin rehearsals," says Coach Bentinck.

IRENE SELECTS HER
HUSBAND'S WIFE
Irene is good, however, and is con
stantly thinking of the care and keeping
of Stuart Randolph, her husband, when
she is about to die. He must marry
again; and to make sure that he selects
the right woman, she chooses his "second
wife" for him. Emily Ladew is a moth
erly sort of person, and like Irene, has
a peculiar notion. Hers is that she is
going to die an old maid. After seme
persuasion by Irene and John Bcldcn,
Irene's uncle, she promises to marry
Stuart on his wife's death. And now the
"plot thickens." Does Irene really die?
What becomes of the poor girl ? And
what happens to her husband if the new
regime goes into effect?
BELDEN THINKS HE
UNDERSTANDS WOMEN
John Belden believes he can argue with
women and especially with young ones
who harbor such silly notions of dying.
He resolves secretly to let her die. His
part is the Good Samaritan, and he is
so cocksure that he can guide the frail
little barks all around him to places of
safety, that be receives a terrible "wal
lop" later in the play.

Irene is a sweet, young girl who for
