# MINING EXPERT CLAIMS WRONG AGENCY USED IN FIRE
## 
### (By United Press 
San Francisco, Oct. 17. —The agency
thought to be the only one that might
save the lives of the forty-seven en
tombed miners in the Argonaut was in
reality the very agency that hastened
their death, according to T. A. Rick
ard, mining expert, who testified last
night before the investigating com
mittee appointed by Governor Steph
ens.
The one hope held out during the
early days of the fire at the mine was
that the great fans were forcing fresh
air to the men imprisoned in the
depths of the mine. But, according to
Rickard, it was the operating of the
fans that hastened death by pumping
the lethal gases into the very cham
ber where the men were bulkheading
themselves from the fire.
"Had the fan at the Muldoon shaft
been stopped at once," said Rickard,
"say within thirty minutes after Brad
shaw first reported the fire, the flames
in the Argonaut shaft would have
created a natural draft that would
have given the trapped miners fresh
air and their one chance for life."
