# IS THIS THE TRUTH?

"Long before the end of the Stanford-Olympic
Club game many of the students left the bleachers
and went their respective ways." This charge is
brought by an active Stanford alumnus in a com
munication addressed to the Daily Palo Alto.
This action was condemned by the writer of the
letter in no uncertain terms, and if he had the
facts of the case straight, he had good cause to be
incensed.
"This offense in the good old days—if I may
use the expression—would have called for a
man's being booted off the campus," declares the
irritated correspondent. It seems logical to a
good many contemporary enthusiasts that the
same summary action might be used to good ef
fect in these days, which we are inclined to believe
are just as good as any in the past. The writer
declared that he could not imagine a loyal Stan
ford student leav ing the bleachers with his team
out on the field taking a beating. Neither can
we. Anybody guilty of such an offense is most
certainly not a loyal Stanford man. He may be
registered in the University, but for all intents
and purposes he might as well be registered in
the University of Bankok. He is going to college
merely for his own selfish interests —taking
everything and giving nothing.
"If this is the wonderful Stanford Spirit that
gives me such a thrill every time I hear the name,
1 will say, with emphasis, that the students on
the Campus now do not measure up as they
should." These are pretty harsh words, coming
as they do from an old-timer who is probably
doing as much for Stanford as any known alum
nus. If what he seems to think has a glimmer of
truth in it, then it is about time for Stanford men
and women to WAKE UP. If these are facts,
how about taking the Daily's correspondent at
his word? Let's boot a few poor specimens of
sportsmanship off the Campus and make room
for those who believe in Stanford and are willing
to back Stanford ideas and ideals to the limit.
Up until a few years ago, Stanford students
were forced to do nearly everything for them
selves. Then came the alumni who shouldered
many of the burdens. Together, they might have
accomplished wonders. The students alone did.
Are the students of today shirking their work be
cause they think it is being done for them by
others? If they are, then it is certainly not too
late for them to prove that they appreciate what
the alumni are doing. A little cooperation will
go a long way toward making a united alumni
and student body—a group potentially unbeat
able in any man's town.

Up until a few years ago, Stanford students
were forced to do nearly everything for them
selves. Then came the alumni who shouldered
many of the burdens. Together, they might have
accomplished wonders. The students alone did.
Are the students of today shirking their work be
cause they think it is being done for them by
others? If they are, then it is certainly not too
late for them to prove that they appreciate what
the alumni are doing. A little cooperation will
go a long way toward making a united alumni
and student body—a group potentially unbeat
able in any man's town.
"Long before the end of the Stanford-Olympic
Club game many of the students left the bleachers
and went their respective ways." This charge is
brought by an active Stanford alumnus in a com
munication addressed to the Daily Palo Alto.
This action was condemned by the writer of the
letter in no uncertain terms, and if he had the
facts of the case straight, he had good cause to be
incensed.
"This offense in the good old days—if I may
use the expression—would have called for a
man's being booted off the campus," declares the
irritated correspondent. It seems logical to a
good many contemporary enthusiasts that the
same summary action might be used to good ef
fect in these days, which we are inclined to believe
are just as good as any in the past. The writer
declared that he could not imagine a loyal Stan
ford student leav ing the bleachers with his team
out on the field taking a beating. Neither can
we. Anybody guilty of such an offense is most
certainly not a loyal Stanford man. He may be
registered in the University, but for all intents
and purposes he might as well be registered in
the University of Bankok. He is going to college
merely for his own selfish interests —taking
everything and giving nothing.
"If this is the wonderful Stanford Spirit that
gives me such a thrill every time I hear the name,
1 will say, with emphasis, that the students on
the Campus now do not measure up as they
should." These are pretty harsh words, coming
as they do from an old-timer who is probably
doing as much for Stanford as any known alum
nus. If what he seems to think has a glimmer of
truth in it, then it is about time for Stanford men
and women to WAKE UP. If these are facts,
how about taking the Daily's correspondent at
his word? Let's boot a few poor specimens of
sportsmanship off the Campus and make room
for those who believe in Stanford and are willing
to back Stanford ideas and ideals to the limit.
