# ANOTHER REPORT FROM WITHIN
## 
### 
As if it were an echo of the above sentiments
from within the student body, a letter with a
Stanford University date-line was received by
the Daily today, declaring that students did not
support their teams. The communication was
headed, "Have Stanford Teams Forgotton How
to Fight?" The writer of the letter did not seem
to think so, but he at least intimated that a large
group of students did. He pointed out the fact
that students had become calloused to defeat on
the athletic field and were now cynically denying
the spirit of Stanford Fight.
The present situation is a combination of un
fortunate but unavoidable circumstances. Stan
ford's athletic record for the past few years has
not been very prepossessing. How much do
students expect? No University can win all the
time. Every university must go into a compar
ative slump once in a while or there would be no

intercollegiate competition. Both sides must stand
a chance to win. Students must learn to back
their team in time of defeat as well as victory.
Anybody who accuses Stanford teams of lacking
fight is crazier than Mr. Hyde. And this is a par
ticularly bad situation when that same Mr. Hyde
becomes a benign Dr. Jekyll as soon as the team
wins.
Anybody who has insufficient patience to sit
tight and take things as they come without in
sinuating dark things for Stanford's future, wilt
find himself .as well as others, far better off
playing Rip Van Winkle until the regular cycle
of Stanford victories has made its rounds.
