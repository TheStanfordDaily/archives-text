Sunset —A Pome
(According to our more serious-minded campus con
temporary).
A blaze of blooming squaw-seed in the west,
Purple, and pink, and a dash of gin,
A solo by the master hand of awe,
Pushing the flaming orbit to a cold bath in the
Pacific!
Ah, me! Gyrating kittens gamboling westward. . . .
And the sun has sat.

Hugo, the Midnight Moth, is going up to the U'. S.
mint Saturday. He wants a tree sample of their work.

Howdja Dooit?
The furs go in the moth-balls,
Light dresses, thin and sheer,
And open throats, with lace work,
Tell us that winter's here.
They call the girls the weaker sect,
But there's one thing, says I,
They wear some winter clothes, by heck,
I'd freeze in, in July!

The movie was called "The $5 Baby." Right in front
of us was a young lady who was reading the titles to
her mother. Next to us was a young man afflicted with
sleepiness. As the touching parting scene was reaching
the climax, the young lady murmured softly, "Oh, Uncle
Ben, Uncle Ben, how can I leave you?"
"I guess we'll have to carry her," remarked the sleepy
one, as he slid off the seat.

"WELL," REMARKED THE ACTRESS TO HER IN
TERVIEWER, "WE STARS MAY QUARREL A LITTLE
BUT WE MAKE UP BEFORE EVERY PERFORM
ANCE."


Him: "Say, lady, I just killed your dog, and I'll replace
him if you say so."
Shim: "Oh, George, this is so sudden!"
