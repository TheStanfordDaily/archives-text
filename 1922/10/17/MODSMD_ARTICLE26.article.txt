# WASHINGTON WILD FLOWERS RECORDED BY PHOTOGRAPHY
## 
### 
A complete record of prairie flowers
of Washington by a new process of color
photography has been begun by Professor
F. L. Pickett, head of the botany de
partment of the Washington State Col
lege. He uses regulation black and white
negatives, but photographs through three
color screens which filter out all but
make as many reproductions from one
negative as he desires, instead of the one
possible by the older system of color
photography.
