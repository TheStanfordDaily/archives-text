Now that the Seals have made Alfie
Putnam's heart glad by winning the
pennant from the Vernon Tigers, and
the world's series is already in the
dim, dark past, intercollegiate football
is beginning its reign over the sport
world. More and more space in the
sport sections will be devoted to the
doings of the Coast elevens until No
vember 25. Then there will be a lull,
followed by a revival of interest on
account of the holiday intersectional
contests.

Curiously enough, five sets of
brothers played against Stanford in
the various games Saturday. The
Schwill brothers, Otto and Henry, both
backs, drove the scorekeepers to dis
traction trying to keep account of who
made Santa Clara's plays. Then there
were "Big"' and "Baby" Vowell, and
the two Noonans, designated as T. and
M.
Walter Disbrow played fullback on
the San Jose eleven, but his brother
Cecil dropped back from the line, and
put over a field goal for the only score
of the game. Joe and A1 Smith at left
guard and left end, respectively, for
Lowell, may account for the fact the
Babes made most of their gains
through the right side of the line.

Just why the Stanford varsity didn't
run up a larger score against Santa
Clara, seems to be the main topic of
gridiron conversation this week. For
one thing, the Warner system has al
ways laid more stress at first on de
fense than on offense. Then again the
absence of an experienced head to di
rect the team when Woodward was
taken out may have had something
to do with it.

"Swede" Righter, Cardinal center in
'19 and '20, now coach at the College
of Pacific, is after another crack at
the Bears. He is going to sit in for
Latham, since that gentleman still re
fuses to play against his Alma Mater,
when Evans' Olympics battle the
Bears Saturday.
Righter thinks he has discovered
the secret of "Rabbit" Bradshaw's
elusiveness. Bradshaw starts fast, says
Righter, and suddenly slows up just
as he is about to be tackled. The re
sult is the tackier hits the ground in
stead of the "Rabbit."

Coach Hunt piled his squad into the
bleachers on the old varsity field yes
terday, and gave it a twenty-minute
blackboard lecture on new plays to
be used against the U. C. Central
Branch next week-end. Regular skull
practice is scheduled for tomorrow
night.

The injury to Bob Cravens' ankle
did not prove of a serious nature and
according to Trainer Denny the big
guard will be in shape for Saturday's
contest with thur St. Mary's. Faville
is working out at guard m Cravens'
absence. Bob Janssen's ankle is mend
ing fast and it is possible that he, too,
will be back in uniform Saturday.

Johnston, the only other member of
Kerr's squad who has been on the in
jured list, was ready to go into the
Santa Clara game if he was needed
and will undoubtedly be seen at tackle
when Coach Madigan's team lines up
against the Cardinal. This boy, John
ston, by the way, is a comer and gives
promise of being one iof the best
tackles on the Coast. He has speed,
weight, and power, and knows how to
use all of them.

Without a doubt, California has the
most attractive gridiron program in
the state next Saturday. Experienced
club players, in good condition, com
bating Andy Smith's championship
hopes seem to be about as good foot
ball fare as will be offered before
November 25. If "Bob" Evans, the
Winged "O" coach, can throw dust in
the eyes of Andy Smith following that
14-10 classic, the former Card mentor
will be walking on air tor a week.
And the same goes for Patrick, Levy,
Larson, and Righter.

Don't overlook the work of the var
sity guards in the Mission game. De-
Groot stood out 011 the defense in his
position of roving center; the tackles
and ends were more or less in the eye
of the spectator. The guards, George
Houck and Bob Cravens, until the lat
ter was forced out with an injured
ankle, got in some hard licks against
the Saints. Houck has had 110 previous
varsity experience, yet he seems to
have the call over Pheney, Faville,
and Ludeke.

Johnson received credit in several line
ups for playing in the Santa Clara game,
wheras Fred Loomis did all the work
and wasn't mentioned at all. Trainer
Denny had Johnson's knee in shape to
start, but Kerr preferred to send in
Loomis, to give him some needed ex
perience. The Cardinal line didn't show
any effects of Johnson's absence.

jured list, was ready to go into the
Santa Clara game if he was needed
and will undoubtedly be seen at tackle
when Coach Madigan's team lines up
against the Cardinal. This boy, John
ston, by the way, is a comer and gives
promise of being one iof the best
tackles on the Coast. He has speed,
weight, and power, and knows how to
use all of them.

Without a doubt, California has the
most attractive gridiron program in
the state next Saturday. Experienced
club players, in good condition, com
bating Andy Smith's championship
hopes seem to be about as good foot
ball fare as will be offered before
November 25. If "Bob" Evans, the
Winged "O" coach, can throw dust in
the eyes of Andy Smith following that
14-10 classic, the former Card mentor
will be walking on air tor a week.
And the same goes for Patrick, Levy,
Larson, and Righter.

Don't overlook the work of the var
sity guards in the Mission game. De-
Groot stood out 011 the defense in his
position of roving center; the tackles
and ends were more or less in the eye
of the spectator. The guards, George
Houck and Bob Cravens, until the lat
ter was forced out with an injured
ankle, got in some hard licks against
the Saints. Houck has had 110 previous
varsity experience, yet he seems to
have the call over Pheney, Faville,
and Ludeke.

Johnson received credit in several line
ups for playing in the Santa Clara game,
wheras Fred Loomis did all the work
and wasn't mentioned at all. Trainer
Denny had Johnson's knee in shape to
start, but Kerr preferred to send in
Loomis, to give him some needed ex
perience. The Cardinal line didn't show
any effects of Johnson's absence.
Now that the Seals have made Alfie
Putnam's heart glad by winning the
pennant from the Vernon Tigers, and
the world's series is already in the
dim, dark past, intercollegiate football
is beginning its reign over the sport
world. More and more space in the
sport sections will be devoted to the
doings of the Coast elevens until No
vember 25. Then there will be a lull,
followed by a revival of interest on
account of the holiday intersectional
contests.

Curiously enough, five sets of
brothers played against Stanford in
the various games Saturday. The
Schwill brothers, Otto and Henry, both
backs, drove the scorekeepers to dis
traction trying to keep account of who
made Santa Clara's plays. Then there
were "Big"' and "Baby" Vowell, and
the two Noonans, designated as T. and
M.
Walter Disbrow played fullback on
the San Jose eleven, but his brother
Cecil dropped back from the line, and
put over a field goal for the only score
of the game. Joe and A1 Smith at left
guard and left end, respectively, for
Lowell, may account for the fact the
Babes made most of their gains
through the right side of the line.

Just why the Stanford varsity didn't
run up a larger score against Santa
Clara, seems to be the main topic of
gridiron conversation this week. For
one thing, the Warner system has al
ways laid more stress at first on de
fense than on offense. Then again the
absence of an experienced head to di
rect the team when Woodward was
taken out may have had something
to do with it.

"Swede" Righter, Cardinal center in
'19 and '20, now coach at the College
of Pacific, is after another crack at
the Bears. He is going to sit in for
Latham, since that gentleman still re
fuses to play against his Alma Mater,
when Evans' Olympics battle the
Bears Saturday.
Righter thinks he has discovered
the secret of "Rabbit" Bradshaw's
elusiveness. Bradshaw starts fast, says
Righter, and suddenly slows up just
as he is about to be tackled. The re
sult is the tackier hits the ground in
stead of the "Rabbit."

Coach Hunt piled his squad into the
bleachers on the old varsity field yes
terday, and gave it a twenty-minute
blackboard lecture on new plays to
be used against the U. C. Central
Branch next week-end. Regular skull
practice is scheduled for tomorrow
night.

The injury to Bob Cravens' ankle
did not prove of a serious nature and
according to Trainer Denny the big
guard will be in shape for Saturday's
contest with thur St. Mary's. Faville
is working out at guard m Cravens'
absence. Bob Janssen's ankle is mend
ing fast and it is possible that he, too,
will be back in uniform Saturday.

guard and left end, respectively, for
Lowell, may account for the fact the
Babes made most of their gains
through the right side of the line.

Just why the Stanford varsity didn't
run up a larger score against Santa
Clara, seems to be the main topic of
gridiron conversation this week. For
one thing, the Warner system has al
ways laid more stress at first on de
fense than on offense. Then again the
absence of an experienced head to di
rect the team when Woodward was
taken out may have had something
to do with it.

"Swede" Righter, Cardinal center in
'19 and '20, now coach at the College
of Pacific, is after another crack at
the Bears. He is going to sit in for
Latham, since that gentleman still re
fuses to play against his Alma Mater,
when Evans' Olympics battle the
Bears Saturday.
Righter thinks he has discovered
the secret of "Rabbit" Bradshaw's
elusiveness. Bradshaw starts fast, says
Righter, and suddenly slows up just
as he is about to be tackled. The re
sult is the tackier hits the ground in
stead of the "Rabbit."

Coach Hunt piled his squad into the
bleachers on the old varsity field yes
terday, and gave it a twenty-minute
blackboard lecture on new plays to
be used against the U. C. Central
Branch next week-end. Regular skull
practice is scheduled for tomorrow
night.

The injury to Bob Cravens' ankle
did not prove of a serious nature and
according to Trainer Denny the big
guard will be in shape for Saturday's
contest with thur St. Mary's. Faville
is working out at guard m Cravens'
absence. Bob Janssen's ankle is mend
ing fast and it is possible that he, too,
will be back in uniform Saturday.

Johnston, the only other member of
Kerr's squad who has been on the in
jured list, was ready to go into the
Santa Clara game if he was needed
and will undoubtedly be seen at tackle
when Coach Madigan's team lines up
against the Cardinal. This boy, John
ston, by the way, is a comer and gives
promise of being one iof the best
tackles on the Coast. He has speed,
weight, and power, and knows how to
use all of them.

Without a doubt, California has the
most attractive gridiron program in
the state next Saturday. Experienced
club players, in good condition, com
bating Andy Smith's championship
hopes seem to be about as good foot
ball fare as will be offered before
November 25. If "Bob" Evans, the
Winged "O" coach, can throw dust in
the eyes of Andy Smith following that
14-10 classic, the former Card mentor
will be walking on air tor a week.
And the same goes for Patrick, Levy,
Larson, and Righter.

Don't overlook the work of the var
sity guards in the Mission game. De-
Groot stood out 011 the defense in his
position of roving center; the tackles
and ends were more or less in the eye
of the spectator. The guards, George
Houck and Bob Cravens, until the lat
ter was forced out with an injured
ankle, got in some hard licks against
the Saints. Houck has had 110 previous
varsity experience, yet he seems to
have the call over Pheney, Faville,
and Ludeke.

Johnson received credit in several line
ups for playing in the Santa Clara game,
wheras Fred Loomis did all the work
and wasn't mentioned at all. Trainer
Denny had Johnson's knee in shape to
start, but Kerr preferred to send in
Loomis, to give him some needed ex
perience. The Cardinal line didn't show
any effects of Johnson's absence.
