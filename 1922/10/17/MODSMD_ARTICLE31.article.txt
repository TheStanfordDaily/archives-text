# Dramatic Manager Makes Call for Tryoutees; Will Hold Meeting Tomorrow
## 
### 
J. D. Richer, '24, Business Manager of
the Dramatic Council, has issued a call
for tryoutees for next year's manager
of the Council, meeting of the tryoutees
will be held tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock in the Green Room.
During the year the tryoutees will be
given an opportunity to show their ability
by planning some of the publicity for the
various shows and handling other details
which will give the necessary experience
for the position.
A new policy of selling season tickets
to the five dramatic shows of the year
has been inaugurated by the Dramatic
Council.
The tickets will sell for $4 which will
be a saving of $1 on the five seats. Single
tickets for the various shows will be
sold at 75 cents and $1 which is a sub
stantial reduction over the prices of last
year's shows. The season ticket which is
to be put on sale will not admit the buyer
to the Football Show, Ram's Head, or
the Junior Opera. The five dramatic
shows which are included uiwler this price
are Sword and Sandals, Sophomore Play,
English Club, Masquers, and the Senior
Farce.
The plan of season tickets was first
suggested to the council by President
Wilbur. He believes that there will be a
great many students who will want to
take advantage of the saving by purchas
ing a season ticket. It is also the belief
of Dr. Wilbur that by this means the
University will be able to interest a large
number of the residents of Palo Alto
and vicinity.
After considering the suggestion from
all angles, the council came to the de
cision that the season ticket should in
clude only strictly dramatic productions,
since it is thought that these plays will
appeal to a larger number of people.
J. D. Richer, '24, business manager of
the council, is making arrangements for
the advance sale of these tickets which
will be held about the first of next week.
The third freshman squad played its
last game Saturday, unless Coach
Hunt decides to schedule some more
morning games. No cuts have been
made in the squad as yet, but the
sixty or more now out will be greatly
reduced when interclass football gets
under way.
Ackerman, end. and Rispin, quarter,
are the two most promising players
on the third string.
Hunt's two-backfield system is ex
pected to be in working order again
next Saturday. The absence of Nevers
with a wrenched shoulder prevented
its use against Lowell. In the starting
line-up of this play are Nevers, full,
Faust and Solomon, halves, and Kir
wan. quarter. When the third quarter
starts Hunt shifts Solomon to full,
with Clayes and Cook at halves, and
Mitchell at quarter.

the council, is making arrangements for
the advance sale of these tickets which
will be held about the first of next week.
The third freshman squad played its
last game Saturday, unless Coach
Hunt decides to schedule some more
morning games. No cuts have been
made in the squad as yet, but the
sixty or more now out will be greatly
reduced when interclass football gets
under way.
Ackerman, end. and Rispin, quarter,
are the two most promising players
on the third string.
Hunt's two-backfield system is ex
pected to be in working order again
next Saturday. The absence of Nevers
with a wrenched shoulder prevented
its use against Lowell. In the starting
line-up of this play are Nevers, full,
Faust and Solomon, halves, and Kir
wan. quarter. When the third quarter
starts Hunt shifts Solomon to full,
with Clayes and Cook at halves, and
Mitchell at quarter.
J. D. Richer, '24, Business Manager of
the Dramatic Council, has issued a call
for tryoutees for next year's manager
of the Council, meeting of the tryoutees
will be held tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock in the Green Room.
During the year the tryoutees will be
given an opportunity to show their ability
by planning some of the publicity for the
various shows and handling other details
which will give the necessary experience
for the position.
A new policy of selling season tickets
to the five dramatic shows of the year
has been inaugurated by the Dramatic
Council.
The tickets will sell for $4 which will
be a saving of $1 on the five seats. Single
tickets for the various shows will be
sold at 75 cents and $1 which is a sub
stantial reduction over the prices of last
year's shows. The season ticket which is
to be put on sale will not admit the buyer
to the Football Show, Ram's Head, or
the Junior Opera. The five dramatic
shows which are included uiwler this price
are Sword and Sandals, Sophomore Play,
English Club, Masquers, and the Senior
Farce.
The plan of season tickets was first
suggested to the council by President
Wilbur. He believes that there will be a
great many students who will want to
take advantage of the saving by purchas
ing a season ticket. It is also the belief
of Dr. Wilbur that by this means the
University will be able to interest a large
number of the residents of Palo Alto
and vicinity.
After considering the suggestion from
all angles, the council came to the de
cision that the season ticket should in
clude only strictly dramatic productions,
since it is thought that these plays will
appeal to a larger number of people.
