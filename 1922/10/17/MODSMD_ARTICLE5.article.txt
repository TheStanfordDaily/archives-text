the JunlCt* edition of the Quad, to be
delivered only to members of 1924 who

have appeared in previous years. Man
agerial tryoutees among the sophomore
class are now collecting the 1924 as
sessment from Juniors. Quad Manager
Charles White urges all Juniors to pay
the amount promptly, as it will enable
the Quad to meet cash discount terms
and save money which can be put in
the book to secure additional features.
