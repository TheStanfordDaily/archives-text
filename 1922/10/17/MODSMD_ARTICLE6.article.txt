# FOUR SOCCER TEAMS TIED FOR TITLE IN PENINSULA LEAGUE
## 
### 
Last Saturday afternoon when the
Vikings defeated the University of
California, 2-1, another strong team
made its presence known in the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League.
Coach Harry Maloney of the Stan
ford varsity, who has seen the Vikings
play, says of them, "The fact that the
Vikings won from California shows
them to be a team which must be
reckoned with in the future." Stanford
will go to San Francisco to play them
next Saturday.
In the other contests of the second
round of play in the league, the Olym
pic Club scored an easy victory over
the Italia Virtus, and the Barbarians
won from the American Legion, 4-3.
Stanford's win over the Sons of St.
George ties the four victors for the
championship of the league. The Bar
barians, Olympics, and Stanford were
the main contestants last year for the
honor.
In order that substitutes on the
teams of the University land Club
Soccer League might have competition
other than that of their own team, a
second division of the league was
formed at a meeting held in San Fran
cisco last Friday night.
Five clubs and second teams from
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia have entered elevens, and a
schedule which will start next Satur
day was drawn up. Later in the sea
son the freshman teams from Stan
ford and California will cbmplete the
schedule of the second string players.
