# TEMPLETON TO HOLD FALL TRACK MEETS
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templcton's large
crowd of track proteges will stage the
first cinderpath and field meet of the
year next Friday afternoon after four
o'clock. This will be the first of a series
of class contests which Templeton plans
to have each week during the fall quarter.
Distance events will be omitted from
the meets for several weeks until the
men get in condition. The track and field
events scheduled are: 100 yard dash, 120
yard low hurdles, B<SO yard dash, shotput,
broad jump, and high jump. Each man
in the class will enter a field and track
event in the weekly competition. Prac
tically all members of last year's va--'- ; -
are seen daily on the oval together with
prospects for the 1926 squad.
Templeton stresses the importance of
all "top-notch" men being out for fall
practice as well as those who are novices.
A green man who works hard all year
may step into the championship class the
following season. It is impossible, says
Templeton, for track athletes to attain
the proper training and form in the short
period afforded in the spring quarter be
fore the big meet.
By the system of fall training the
Cardinal mentor hbpes to bring out latent
abilities and develop the present stars.
The all year work is necessary, he thinks,
in order to build the team which he
hopes will triumph over the Blue and
Gold this spring. Under the present plan
the athlete is developed physically and
in form. There is no strain; muscles
develop gradually, while there is plenty
of time to perfect form. Templeton de
sires to get away from the idea of track
as a grind. As much fun as possible is
his motto.
