# CARDINAL VARSITY PREPARES FOR GAME WITH SAINT MARY'S
## Grays Use Madigan's Plays in Scrimmage With Varsity; DeGroot Nearly Scores 
### 
St. 1 " 'ry's, the third obstacle in the
road 01 ihe Card grid varsity, was
represented by proxy at the practice
turf yesterday afternoon.
"Red" Betts, despite lus flaming
hair, was supposed to be "Slip" Mad
igan. The grays, outfitted with the
Oaklanders' plays, imitated Captain
Black and his mates from the Phoenix
college.
If the real St. Mary's men don't exe
cute their plays any better than did
the grays last night, then California's
41 to 0 score won't look so big to
Kerr's charges.
Coach Betts, alias Madigan. had his
men using the Notre Dame shift. That
was the play that raised such a hulla
baloo last Saturday at Berkeley. Andy
Smith claims that it is prohibited by
the new rule saying that any backfield
man less than five yards behind the
line must bring his body to a full
stop before the ball is snapped. Smith
ought to know, for he was a member
of the committee that made the change
last year.
For over three-quarters of an hour
the varsity scrimmaged with Betts'
fake Saints. The first backfield —Wood-
ward, Wilcox, Doughty and Cuddeback
—were not at all puzzled by the grays'
defense, and made gains of twenty
yards frequently. Even the Notre Dame
formation failed to gain for Betts' men,
due principally to the work of the
varsity tackles.
Dud DeGroot will make a touchdown
next Saturday if St. Mary's does the
same thing as its counterpart did yes
terday. The grays kept shooting for
ward passes in DeGroot's direction un
til the big fellow grabbed one and
lumbered through the opposition for a
near score. That rivals the four points
DeGroot made as standing guard on
the varsity basketball team last win
ter.
Thornhill's line, from flank to flank,
started as follows: Hartranft, 1. e.;
Shipkey, 1. t.; Faville, 1. g.; DeGroot,
c.; Ludeke, r. g.; Loomis, r. t.; Dole,
r. e. In the course of the sham battle
Kerr sent in his backfield subs, while
Thornhill ordered in Jim Lawson and
his weak knee for Dole. Lawson
showed especially well on the de
fensive.
The condition of the Card hospital
brigade is as follows: Janssen's ankle
is on the mend, and the tall end was
in a suit, but did no strenuous work.
Paul Murray, having just rid himself
of a "charley-horse," is now bothered
by a weak ankle. Cravens was also in
uniform, but was not TTsed in the
scrimmage. Johnson is ready to start
again. 1

same thing as its counterpart did yes
terday. The grays kept shooting for
ward passes in DeGroot's direction un
til the big fellow grabbed one and
lumbered through the opposition for a
near score. That rivals the four points
DeGroot made as standing guard on
the varsity basketball team last win
ter.
Thornhill's line, from flank to flank,
started as follows: Hartranft, 1. e.;
Shipkey, 1. t.; Faville, 1. g.; DeGroot,
c.; Ludeke, r. g.; Loomis, r. t.; Dole,
r. e. In the course of the sham battle
Kerr sent in his backfield subs, while
Thornhill ordered in Jim Lawson and
his weak knee for Dole. Lawson
showed especially well on the de
fensive.
The condition of the Card hospital
brigade is as follows: Janssen's ankle
is on the mend, and the tall end was
in a suit, but did no strenuous work.
Paul Murray, having just rid himself
of a "charley-horse," is now bothered
by a weak ankle. Cravens was also in
uniform, but was not TTsed in the
scrimmage. Johnson is ready to start
again. 1
St. 1 " 'ry's, the third obstacle in the
road 01 ihe Card grid varsity, was
represented by proxy at the practice
turf yesterday afternoon.
"Red" Betts, despite lus flaming
hair, was supposed to be "Slip" Mad
igan. The grays, outfitted with the
Oaklanders' plays, imitated Captain
Black and his mates from the Phoenix
college.
If the real St. Mary's men don't exe
cute their plays any better than did
the grays last night, then California's
41 to 0 score won't look so big to
Kerr's charges.
Coach Betts, alias Madigan. had his
men using the Notre Dame shift. That
was the play that raised such a hulla
baloo last Saturday at Berkeley. Andy
Smith claims that it is prohibited by
the new rule saying that any backfield
man less than five yards behind the
line must bring his body to a full
stop before the ball is snapped. Smith
ought to know, for he was a member
of the committee that made the change
last year.
For over three-quarters of an hour
the varsity scrimmaged with Betts'
fake Saints. The first backfield —Wood-
ward, Wilcox, Doughty and Cuddeback
—were not at all puzzled by the grays'
defense, and made gains of twenty
yards frequently. Even the Notre Dame
formation failed to gain for Betts' men,
due principally to the work of the
varsity tackles.
Dud DeGroot will make a touchdown
next Saturday if St. Mary's does the
same thing as its counterpart did yes
terday. The grays kept shooting for
ward passes in DeGroot's direction un
til the big fellow grabbed one and
lumbered through the opposition for a
near score. That rivals the four points
DeGroot made as standing guard on
the varsity basketball team last win
ter.
