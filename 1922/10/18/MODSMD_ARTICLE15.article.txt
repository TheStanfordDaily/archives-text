# FORMER PROTEGES OF HUNT'S SLATED AGAINST FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Greek is going to meet Greek on
I Saturday. Coach "Husky" Hunt's Stan
ford freshmen will bump into the
Berkeley high eleven, with over half
of the team veterans of Hunt's 1921
champions.
The coach has been drilling his men
for the past two days 011 special plays
| to use against the trans-bay squad. He
1 can't use his regular attacks because
his former proteges would spot after
the first shift. At the same time, Coach
Schaeffer's men can't use the system
that won them their ohampionship
i last year, for the '26 team khows it by
heart.
It will be the first real battle of the
| season for the Babes. "That gang up
I there is a bunch of scrappers, and I
know just how hard they will fight to
I win a game—especially this game,"
■ Hunt told his men last night.
Mike Murphy, whom Hunt says is
j about the classiest fullback in this
part of the state; Johnny Climer, quar
terback, and Bob Green, the elephan
tine center, are some of the stars who
learned under "Husky."
Not only Hunt, but Assistant Coach
A. E. Post, has a strong personal in
terest in Saturday's developments.
Post has a brother who is left tackle
on the Berkeley team, and the coach is
expecting him to come through—but
not too strong, of course.
Berkeley has already defeated Oak
land Tech., one of the strongest bidders
for the Oakland interscholastic title,
and the St. Mary's freshmen. At pres
ent Coach Schaeffer and his men are
' conceded to be the strongest contend
ers for the sectional championship.
With the exception of Ernie Nevers,
the big fullback who was injured a
week ago, the strongest possible fresh
man squad will go into action against
! Berkeley.
Hunt's backfield is his strongest
asset. He has six men of exactly equal
ability, and can put a combination on
the field that has speed, weight enough
for steady gains through any line, and
accuracy in forward passing. Cook and
Clayes are the sprinters, "Buck" Faust,
Mitchell, and "Solly" S6lomon the line
busters, and the Solomon-Kirwan part
nership attends to the long tosses.

| season for the Babes. "That gang up
I there is a bunch of scrappers, and I
know just how hard they will fight to
I win a game—especially this game,"

With the exception of Ernie Nevers,
the big fullback who was injured a

After practice tonight the squad
will take an hour for blackboard prac-
