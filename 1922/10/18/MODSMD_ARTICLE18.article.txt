David Mannoccir, '24, nas been

The competition in which 150 en
tered was especially strong and inas
much as the cast consisted of but six
characters, the selection was made
difficult. The half-dozen selected, with
one or two exceptions, have nad no
previous stage experience.
"Her Husband's Wife" is too refined
in its humor and situations to be
termed a farce. "Its comedy closely
approaches a finely-drawn work of
art," one critic puts it. Each part re
quires delicate handling rather than
the broad gesture of the farceur, and
according to R. C. Bentinck, dramatic
coach, the characters "must combine
sincerity of interpretation with the fine
art of restraint."
The action of the comedy transpire*
in the fashionable living room of the
Randolphs in Saratoga, N. Y. The orig
inal setting of the play will be changed
so that it will be along more modern
lines. It will be as striking as possible,!
both as to design and color, and also
lighting effects.
The play was first produced in Phil
adelphia in February, 1913, as an ex
perimental run before it was played
on a New York stage in September of I
the same year. In Philadelphia, Henry '
Miller played the part of John Belden,
while Cora Hyde Crews, who recently
appeared on the Coast in "Mr. Pim
Passes By," took the part of Irene
Randolph. In New York, its run lasted
until the late summer of the following
year. It has also been played on the
road and some in stock, but this will
be its first appearance on the Pacific-
Coast.

one or two exceptions, have nad no
previous stage experience.
"Her Husband's Wife" is too refined
in its humor and situations to be
termed a farce. "Its comedy closely
approaches a finely-drawn work of
art," one critic puts it. Each part re
quires delicate handling rather than
the broad gesture of the farceur, and
according to R. C. Bentinck, dramatic
coach, the characters "must combine
sincerity of interpretation with the fine
art of restraint."
The action of the comedy transpire*
in the fashionable living room of the
Randolphs in Saratoga, N. Y. The orig
inal setting of the play will be changed
so that it will be along more modern
lines. It will be as striking as possible,!
both as to design and color, and also
lighting effects.
The play was first produced in Phil
adelphia in February, 1913, as an ex
perimental run before it was played
on a New York stage in September of I
the same year. In Philadelphia, Henry '
Miller played the part of John Belden,
while Cora Hyde Crews, who recently
appeared on the Coast in "Mr. Pim
Passes By," took the part of Irene
Randolph. In New York, its run lasted
until the late summer of the following
year. It has also been played on the
road and some in stock, but this will
be its first appearance on the Pacific-
Coast.
