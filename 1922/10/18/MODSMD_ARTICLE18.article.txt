Wife," to be produced by Sword and
Sandals on Nevember 3. Stuart Ran
dolph, the other doubtful character,

feminine lead, Emily Wardman, '22,
P. H. Talbert, '22, and Elsa Barber, '25,

The competition in which 150 en
tered was especially strong and inas
much as the cast consisted of but six
characters, the selection was made
difficult. The half-dozen selected, with
one or two exceptions, have nad no
previous stage experience.
"Her Husband's Wife" is too refined
in its humor and situations to be
termed a farce. "Its comedy closely
approaches a finely-drawn work of
art," one critic puts it. Each part re
quires delicate handling rather than
the broad gesture of the farceur, and
according to R. C. Bentinck, dramatic
coach, the characters "must combine
sincerity of interpretation with the fine
art of restraint."
