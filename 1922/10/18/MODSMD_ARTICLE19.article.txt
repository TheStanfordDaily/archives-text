# WATER AND POWER ACT TO BE DEBATED ON EVE OF ELECTION
## 
### 
The proposed water and power
amendment to the State Constitution
which is to be voted 011 November 7,
is the question for the triangular de
bates between Stanford, California,
and IT. S. C. on the eve of the general
elections.
The fact that there will be a bonded
indebtedness of half a billion dollars
makes the question of paramount in
terest to every California citizen and
taxpayer, Coach Emerson thinks.
The Stanford-California debate will
occur in the San Francisco Civic Audi
torium, according to Berkeley repre
sentatives. The speeches will be so
timed that the debate will not last
more than an hour and a half. On the
same evening, the University of South
ern California will debate California
in Los Angeles and Stanford in the
Assembly Hall.
Final tryouts for the teams will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the Little Theater. The question as
worded, is: Resolved, That Constitu
tional Amendment No. 19 relating to
the State control of water and power
should be enacted into law. Candidates
are requested to report promptly so
that a systematic order of speaking
may be carried out.
