The Daily Californian published in its Monday
edition the following editorial regarding Stanford's
stand in her recent withdrawal from the Pacific
Coast Conference. No comment is needed. The
article speaks for itself.
''Stanford has done what might be expected of
Stanford. The Cardinals are running true to form.
A mock heroism, coupled with a sort of "holier
than-thou" attitude has resulted in Stanford's with
drawal from the Pacific Coast Conference.
"Their plea is that they did not deserve the rep
rimand ; that their conduct in no way warranted the
action of the conference. As was pointed out in
this column before, Stanford did not in any way
violate the letter of the conference rules, but they x
did, in the opinion of the seven otheremembers,
violate the spirit which should govern all intercol
legiate relations, that is, a spirit of frankness and
cooperation untainted by any clouding of issues or
concealment of facts or actions.
" The conference can be likened to any representa
tive ruling body, which, by reason of the fact that
it is representative, must act for the best interests
of the thing which it rules or else perish. The con
ference rules Pacific Coast football. It is unneces
sary to outline the many good things which that
body has done to better the sport, suffice it is to say
that never have the good intentions of the confer
ence been questioned.
"Now comes Stanford and gets on its high horse
and withdraws. Why? We are lead to believe that
it is because the Redshirts don't know the mean
ing of the words frankness and openness in inter
collegiate relaions. They arc simple words to un
derstand. The other members of the conference
can have no reason to bear a grudge aainst Stan
ford in that they would willingly appyl this phrase
to an action not deservng or fit.
"We cannot help feeling that the Cardinals have
made a grave mistake and one that they will regret."
It is the policy of the editorial board of the Daily
Palo Alto to praise everything it considers worth
while, and to condemn everything to the contrary.
The Daily is taking no special pains to praise the
above editorial.
