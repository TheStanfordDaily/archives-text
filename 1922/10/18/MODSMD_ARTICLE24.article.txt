There's nothing wrong with these long skirts, except
that we have to look at the faces again. And we'd a
lot rather look at buck shins than buck teeth.

kinda think it's to water the K. A. lawn.

More or less apropos of the recent additions to the
staff we are herewith printing an important news item.
It was handed in by a tryoutee some seasons ago, but i
overlooked in the scramble to give Nestoria and Eu- J
phronia exactly equal space. The tryoutee later went
out for English club, where he made his mark. He is
now able to sign his name —in two languages, Pict and !
Latvian:
"Last night about six o'clock p. m. Thomas K. Umph, ;
32 years of age, tripped over his untied shoe string, i
Umph had been walking along a bypath in La Liana
Park when he first noticed the lace dragging on the
ground, but he carelessly let it alone. In landing on
the ground after jumping a ditch left uncovered by the
inefficient city authorities, Umpli stumbled over the
dragging lace and fell on a flower pot face downward,
breaking his nose followed by a roll down a sharp in
cline. Arriving at the bottom of the gully, the un- j
fortunate man struck a large rock and fractured his
right leg either above or below his right knee.
"Umph, who was discharged from the City Health
Department last week for stealing a tomato off the
stenographer's desk, lives at 21 Rubberneck street. He
was found not guilty in the trial for taking the vegetable
but failed to recover his position. Umph has a wife and i
some children, Betty and Dorothy, both girls.
"Umph called for help immediately after his accident.
Assistance came in the shape of a patrol man, whose
box was about ten yards away four hours later when
Umph had become unconscious. Get off my foot, said j
Mr. Umph in his delirium, you big sap.
"The injured man is now in Los Menlos Sanitarium
where he is expected to show sign of recovery and says |
he will sue the City for a million dollars. It jj thought 1
that he won't get the money."
