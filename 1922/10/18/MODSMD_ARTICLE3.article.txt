# MERGER OF NORTHERN ROADS WILL BOOST SEATTLE
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 18â€”Seattle will be
come the western terminal of the
greatest system in the history of the
world, if plans now under contempla
tion for the merger of the Great
Northern, Northern Pacific, Burlington
and S. P. & S. railroads are carried
into effect.
The merger would result in one huge
railroad employing more than 100,000'
men and serving 20 states from west
ern Canada to the Gulf and from the
Mississippi to the Pacific with a com
bined trackage of more than 28,500
miles. This merger was planned some
years ago but was prevented by the
government as a result of the North
ern Securities suit.
