# USE OF MIDDLE NAME CAUSES DIFFICULTIES
## 
### 
Considerable difficulty and great in
convenience are experienced by the Regis
trar's Office in keeping the records of
those students who use their middle name
instead of their first names in University
work. In registering, students gave their
names in full and the Registrar's Office
took the first name as the one to be used
in the records. However, some students
used their middle name in making out
their study lists and caused confusion in
the Registrar's Office as a result. It is
suggested that all students, using their
middle name in every day life, adopt
their first name for all official purposes
while in the University. An alternative
is that students, using their middle names,
write also the initial of their first names
in signing papers.
