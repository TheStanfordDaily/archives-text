# Bunco Bum Bamboozles Patient Profs; Cops Cash and Ambles Away
## 
### 
What is thought to be a record for
aliases within a single day was brought
to light recently when a young man of un
known origin duped several philanthropi
cal members of the University of Kansas
faculty and departed with the proceeds
of his well-woven yarns in his jeans.
The first victim of the confidence
game was a professor in the philosophy
department, the perpetrator of the deed
no doubt thinking that the professor
would be inclined to take a charitable
view of the offense. The brave young
man stepped up to the professor in ques
tion and introduced himself as the son
of a former Dean of Butler College. As
a graduate of Butler and a friend of the
former dean, the professor greeted the
youth with great friendliness and listened
with interest to his tales of "the Great
War." The professor then called up his
wife and asked hei* to give all the money
she had in the house to the young man
when he called. No sooner said than
done. The slicker drew eleven dollars
on that one.
With energy and imagination the graft
er returned to his work and exchanged
reminiscences with the- other members
of the faculty, becoming in rapid suc
cession the son of the president of North
western, the nephew of the president of
Ohio State, and other relatives of dis
tinguished educators.
After quitting the philosophy depart
ment, the wise youth turned his foot
steps toward the physics labratory where
the cold scientific eye of the professor
in charge failed to light up at the mention
of the name of certain celebrities to
whom the* needy young man claimed to be
closely related.
A learned professor in the department
of chemistry was not overjoyed to the
point of contribution by the bunco bum
and so the day was not a financial suc
cess. Other members of the faculty may
have been interviewed, but they would not
admit it.
The most accurate description of the
young'man was that he carried a gold
watch which he constantly consulted in
order that he might not miss his train
to Chicago.
