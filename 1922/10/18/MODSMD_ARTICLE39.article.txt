# University Plays Should Be Above Average, Says Dramatic Coach Bentinck
## 
### 
A university dramatic organization
should present a higher type of plays
than the ordinary "Broadway hit," is the
belief of Dramatic Coach R. C. Bentinck,
expressed to members of Masquers soci
ety meeting in the Union at noon today.
Light comedy, with advances in setting
and staging over city productions, is
best suited to college dramatics, in Ben
tinck's opinion.
Manuscripts for Masquers' play to be
given 'in January will be sent for next
week.
