# GLENN WARNER CRITICIZED IN EAST
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH, Pa., Oct. 18.â€”The
disappointing showing of the one time
unbeatable Pitt eleven has started
tongues wagging that Glenn Warner,
famous Carlisle coach, may be let out
next season.
Warner's contract with Pitt has an
other year to go, after which he is
said to be slated to coach the Stanford
team on the Pacific Coast. Warner
says he will be here next fall but
Pitt followers are not accustomed to a
losing team and claim that poor gen
eralship and lack of foresight lost the
first two games of the season with
Lafayette and West Virginia.
The loss of Captain Holleran, who is
out of the game with a broken arm,
has aroused speculation as to what
sort of showing Warner's eleven will
make when it faces the stronger teams
of Pennsylvania, Washington and Jef
ferson, and Penn State later in the
season.
Coach Warner has 110 defense to
make and is not greatly concerned
over the two defeats, he said here
today.
"We simply were beaten by two of
the best elevens in the country," War
ner said. "My team naturally is green
but it has possibilities and we may
surprise the fans before the season is
over."
