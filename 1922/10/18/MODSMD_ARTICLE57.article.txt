EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 18.â€”The School
of Journalism has decided that the
University of Oregon can afford to
have a Sunday paper. For two years
the Oregon Emerald has been a daily,
and as such has conveyed the news of
the campus to its readers five times a
week.
The Emerald will be one of the few
college papers publishing an edition
on Sunday.
