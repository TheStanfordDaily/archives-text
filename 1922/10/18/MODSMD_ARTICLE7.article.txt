UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA, Oct. 18.
â€”Claiming to be "the most unique
college secret society in the United
States," a dozen men have the official
recognition in the school as "The Sun
downers of the Sagebrush." The or
ganization's claim to freakish fame lies
in the fact that to be eligible to mem
bership a candidate must present proof
that he has "bummed his way" by
land or sea at least one thousand
miles.
