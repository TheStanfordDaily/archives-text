'"The pioneer period of American his
tory epitomizes, in my opinion, the best ;
character of our entire history." Such
was the way in which Lieutenant-Colonel
Charles W. Furlong began his lecture
last evening in the Little Theater on!
"The Passing of the Old West."
The speaker supplemented his talk with
stereoptican views and moving-pictures,
illustrating the cow-boy life of the west
of today'as it is represented in the annual
Rodeos and Round-Ups of Montana and
Oregon. He pictured the cow-boy's part |
in the development of the new West
as a protector of property and o pro-1
moter of law and order, and told incidents i
of the wholesome comradeship which'
marks the life of the cattle ranges of!
today.
lieutenant-Colonel Furlong recalled i
personal experiences during the Round-'
Up at Pendleton, Oregon in 1914 when he
won the world's rough-riding champion- j
ship on the famous bucking bull Sharkey.j
H(- also showed pictures of the Umatilla j
Indian ceremonials which are a marked
feature of the Pendleton Round-Up fc and
of the maverick races, and bull dogging
contests, and told of the game sports-1
manship with which some of the cow-j
boys rode the bucking horses at danger i
to limb and life.
An interesting incident told by the lect
urer was that of the Umatilla Indian, !
Jackson Sundown, who went to Pendle- j
ton in 1915 and won the world's rough- |
riding championship from all comers, j
Sundown was the model from which E. |
Phimister Proctor, the local sculptor, j
modeled a number of his Indian statues. 1
"The Pendleton Round-Up," said the;
lecturer in conclusion, "epitomizes the j
last flare of the dying West, that West ;
which is fast being supplanted by the
growth of cities and the reach of rail- j
roads, and is being surely lost sight of in j
the recesses of the past."
