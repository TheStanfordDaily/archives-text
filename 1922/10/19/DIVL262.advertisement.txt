TF EVER an instructor asks you to name a practical use of 112
the scientific principle of capillary attraction —just cite the I
Parker Pen with its leakproof "Lucky Curve" feed. |
All fountain pen makers were baffled for years by the so- ?
called "sweating" of pens. Inked fingers still cause many
complaints except from those who use Parker Pens. |
For Geo. S. Parker solved the problem by inventing the ?
"Lucky Curve" illustrated above. It forms a contact with the
wall of the ink barrel —and no matter how much ink sur- r
rounds it the capillary attraction regulates the flow —it is
steady; even and positive at all times. j
This is one of the cardinal reasons that the Parker Pen is in [
such high favor with educators and student bodies. A pen \
that's a help —not a distraction —when one is concentrating I
the mind on study or instruction. '■
To all students—
Come and try the Parker at the pen counter designated below —try several
points to find just the right degree for your individual hand.

How Parker Pens put Capillary i
Attraction to actual use |
TF EVER an instructor asks you to name a practical use of 112
the scientific principle of capillary attraction —just cite the I
Parker Pen with its leakproof "Lucky Curve" feed. |
All fountain pen makers were baffled for years by the so- ?
called "sweating" of pens. Inked fingers still cause many
complaints except from those who use Parker Pens. |
For Geo. S. Parker solved the problem by inventing the ?
"Lucky Curve" illustrated above. It forms a contact with the
wall of the ink barrel —and no matter how much ink sur- r
rounds it the capillary attraction regulates the flow —it is
steady; even and positive at all times. j
This is one of the cardinal reasons that the Parker Pen is in [
such high favor with educators and student bodies. A pen \
that's a help —not a distraction —when one is concentrating I
the mind on study or instruction. '■
To all students—
Come and try the Parker at the pen counter designated below —try several
points to find just the right degree for your individual hand.
