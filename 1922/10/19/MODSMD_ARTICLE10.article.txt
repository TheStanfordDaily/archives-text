# "CRIP" LIST CLAIMS MANY FRESHMEN
## 
### Phil Newill, '24 
After thoroughly discussing the sit
uation with his assistants, "Husky"
Hunt reached the conclusion last night
that lie is coaching the greatest aggre
gation of cripples ever assembled in
yearling suits.
Four of his crack linemen, Good
rich, Sholes, Cameron, and Davis, were
hopping around the field yesterday,
shielding various parts of their anat
omy. They were able to run signals,
but had to take the part of innocent
bystanders during scrimmage with the
third goofs.
Thanks to Hunt's two-backfield sys
tem, he is a little better off on the
second line of defense. Ernie Nevers
won't line up Saturday though he was
out booting the ball forty-five yards
last night. A1 Rispin, quarter, is still
turning out for practice on crutches.
On top of this, the frosh are con
fronted with the hardest game of their
season —California excepted—on Sat
urday. Berkeley high, as hard hitting
a gang of prep schoolers as ever
played, are coming down to the Farm
to see what they can do to the team
put out by their last year's coach.
In the morning the third team of
yearlings will try to stop the Hitch
cock Military Academy. In order to do
this trick, they will have to have a
strong line, fast tackling, and a good
pair of ends.
Hitchcock ran up twenty points
against Santa Rosa high last Saturday,
and did it principally by end runs and
swift formation plays. Reports from
the Marin district, where the Hitch
cock eleven holds forth, say that Gon
zales and Pabst, who do the sprinting,
are as elusive as wet soap.
When "Red" Betts failed to persuade
the varsity that his team was St.
Mary's in scrimmage Tuesday, he tried
his third squad out on the freshmen
yesterday.
He had a little better luck this time.
The "Hike! one-two-three-Hike!" shift
of Notre Dame crossed up the fresh
man line for quite a spell, during
which the grays slipped across several
weak-side plays. Even after they
caught onto the play, and shifted on
the heels of the opposition, a Goof or
two would break through the substitute
line.
Bill Cook, the chunky halfback,
saved the yearlings' reputation. He
tore off three end runs, and surprised
everybody, including himself, by un
corking a swift twisting run on spread
formation off tackle. "Buck" Faust,
working at the other half, had an off
day, and was accused of snoring once
or twice by the coach.
While nobody in these regions knows
definitely what the Berkeley squad has
up its shirt sleeve this year, Coach
Hunt has a pretty strong idea of the
strength and weaknesses of the indi
vidual players. He handed out this in
formation in an hour's talk to the
squad in the Union last night.
Today the Babes will run through
their repertoire of special Berkeley
plays, and tangle with the Goofs
again. Hunt is not risking any more
injuries by lining his men up against
the varsity.

this trick, they will have to have a
strong line, fast tackling, and a good
pair of ends.
Hitchcock ran up twenty points
against Santa Rosa high last Saturday,
and did it principally by end runs and
swift formation plays. Reports from
the Marin district, where the Hitch
cock eleven holds forth, say that Gon
zales and Pabst, who do the sprinting,
are as elusive as wet soap.
When "Red" Betts failed to persuade
the varsity that his team was St.
Mary's in scrimmage Tuesday, he tried
his third squad out on the freshmen
yesterday.
He had a little better luck this time.
The "Hike! one-two-three-Hike!" shift
of Notre Dame crossed up the fresh
man line for quite a spell, during
which the grays slipped across several
weak-side plays. Even after they
caught onto the play, and shifted on
the heels of the opposition, a Goof or
two would break through the substitute
line.
Bill Cook, the chunky halfback,
saved the yearlings' reputation. He
tore off three end runs, and surprised
everybody, including himself, by un
corking a swift twisting run on spread
formation off tackle. "Buck" Faust,
working at the other half, had an off
day, and was accused of snoring once
or twice by the coach.
While nobody in these regions knows
definitely what the Berkeley squad has
up its shirt sleeve this year, Coach
Hunt has a pretty strong idea of the
strength and weaknesses of the indi
vidual players. He handed out this in
formation in an hour's talk to the
squad in the Union last night.
Today the Babes will run through
their repertoire of special Berkeley
plays, and tangle with the Goofs
again. Hunt is not risking any more
injuries by lining his men up against
the varsity.
After thoroughly discussing the sit
uation with his assistants, "Husky"
Hunt reached the conclusion last night
that lie is coaching the greatest aggre
gation of cripples ever assembled in
yearling suits.
Four of his crack linemen, Good
rich, Sholes, Cameron, and Davis, were
hopping around the field yesterday,
shielding various parts of their anat
omy. They were able to run signals,
but had to take the part of innocent
bystanders during scrimmage with the
third goofs.
Thanks to Hunt's two-backfield sys
tem, he is a little better off on the
second line of defense. Ernie Nevers
won't line up Saturday though he was
out booting the ball forty-five yards
last night. A1 Rispin, quarter, is still
turning out for practice on crutches.
On top of this, the frosh are con
fronted with the hardest game of their
season —California excepted—on Sat
urday. Berkeley high, as hard hitting
a gang of prep schoolers as ever
played, are coming down to the Farm
to see what they can do to the team
put out by their last year's coach.
In the morning the third team of
yearlings will try to stop the Hitch
cock Military Academy. In order to do
this trick, they will have to have a
strong line, fast tackling, and a good
pair of ends.
