Stanford students and faculty members
j are offered an opportunity at a special
admission rate of twenty-five cents to
study probably the most comprehensive
collection of tapestries ever gathered to
gether in one place. This collection is
now on exhibition at the San Francisco
Museum of Art, the old Palace of Fine
Arts in the Panama-Pacific Exposition,
! wher it will be on display for the re-
I mainder of this month. The regular
| admission charge is fifty cents, but
I special Stanford tickets at 25 cents are
' on sale at the Registrar's office and the
[ Graphic Art building.
The exhibition in San Francisco is the
j result of two years' work byj. Nilsen
I Laurvik, Director of the San Francisco
i Museum of Art, and contains speci
mens, many of them historically famous,
gathered from all parts of tlie world and
representing the work of all important
centers of the tapestry-making industry
throughout its entire history. The exhi
bition is declared by experts to be as fine
artistically as has been gathered to
gether at any time during the last couple
of hundred years, and from an historical
viewpoint was probably never exceeded.
Tlie exhibition is open daily from 10 to
5.
The value of the exhibition, both from
an artistic and historical point of view,
is increased for the layman by an illus
trated catalogue which comments on each
of the seventy-nine tapestries hung on
the walls of the Museum of Art galleries.
