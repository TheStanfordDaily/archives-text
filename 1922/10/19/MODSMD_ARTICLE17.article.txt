There might be some excuse when
an elderly woman who has braved the
hardships of many years, concludes
that she has nearly every disease and
ailment enumerated in her medical
book. But supposing a perfectly nice
girl, radiant with the bloom of youth
and who is also the possessor of a real
nice husband, should get this funny
notion into her head? Wouldn't you
think that something was drastically
wrong with her? What would you do
to help her? You wouldn't get angry
with her, would you? On the other
hand, would you just let her die?
"Uncle John," played by David Man
noccir, '24, thinks that he has found
a way in "Her Husband's Wife" to
save his niece from a premature death.
"Irene," played by Gertrude McLeod,
'25, doesn't know exactly what is the
matter with her. The medicine which
she uses was not prescribed on a doc
tor's prescription, but was merely pur
chased from a door-to-door agenl.
Since it has also been used by her
friend to no avail, Irene concludes that
both of them must be suffering from
the same ailment.
Now here's the rub! If you were the
husband of such a lovely wife as Irene
who decides to choose for you another
wife to fill her place when she dies,
what would you do? And supposing
your "second wife" is a sort of moth
erly person? Yes, what would you do?
"Dick" Randolph, played by Arthur
Conover, '25, is indeed in a precarious
position. How he solves his problem—
that's the play.
