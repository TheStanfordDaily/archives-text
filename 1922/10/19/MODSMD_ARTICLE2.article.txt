## 
### (By United Press 
LARAMIE, Wyo., Oct. 19â€”In an
effort to prove he is the son of Wil
liam Desmond Taylor, slain movie di
rector, William Edward Taylor, 34,
may have the body of the elder Taylor
exhumed for examination for scars of
wounds which he claims his father
received here years ago.
Taylor has been here for several
days looking up past records in an
attempt to show that the former movie
director married Olive Randall here in
1884. Taylor claims he is the son of
these two and is attempting to break
the will of the murdered star.
