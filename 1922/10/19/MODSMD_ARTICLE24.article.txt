# GETTING BLOOD OUT OF A TURNIP
## 
### 
An effort ti limit drives on the campus has been
made by the Executive Committee in its recom
mendation to the Social Service Board, a body
composed of both faculty and student representa
tive's. Opinion in both bodies seems to be divided
as to whether such action ought to be taken.
There is argument on both sides of the question.
I hose who disfavor the limiting of drives con
tend that any worthy organization should be giv
en access to campus groups in order that students
may settle the matter for themselves. They think
that in limiting the number of philanthropic bod
ies to three or four, certain discriminations will
be displeasing to members of the student body.
Some people may want to give only to the organ
izations disbarred.
On the other side there looms up the argument
that students are practically subjected to ex
tortion by the time the college year is well along.
Already this year six organizations have sought to
launch drives in the student body, asking student
cooperation in the conduct of the campaigns. It
is obvious that if six apply for such leave within
the first two weeks of college that the bread line
v/ii', gjt pretty lÂ»ong before the year is over. Even
i fa student is not inclined to give, either because
of financial inability or from choice, he has some
pressure brought to bear upon him from several
sources. Every campaigning organization has a
few friends in the student body. People who fail
to give such drives the desired support will be
freely criticized by these few. And in addition to
that, when the plate is being passed, someone is
likely to roll the fishy eye on those who fail to
contribute.
There is not the slightest doubt that all appli
cants for campaigning privileges on the campus
thus far are Very worthy. They are doing a
great work. But it is impossible for any student
body to give them all the proper attention. Under
the ideal circumstances the ordinary college stu
dent has just enough money to get along on. And
it's usually the one who has just enough who does
the contributing . The students with too much
are always in debt. In such a case, nobody can
expect a large number of drives to meet with any,
success on the campus. About one a quarter is
the limit for satisfactory effectiveness.
As to discrimination, it is is better to show pre
ference to some organizations than to let them
all fight each other for the students' money. There
is, of course, the "money chest" idea, by which a
sum of money is solicited for charitable purposes
once or twice a year and is given out to the or
ganizations in question without holding a drive.
This would probably be the most satisfactory
from the students' point of view, although the
amount of money subscribed would probably be
much less than under present circumstances.
It all depends on what kind of a turnip it is
and what kind of blood you are trying to get,
but it appears to a lot of turnips on the campus
righ now that there has been about enough blood
letting for a while.
