# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M. '24

Bill Wright, '25
For the benefit of those harassed souls who went
undecided, Cabbages offers these pointers. Which house:
i3 nearest your eight o'clock? keeps the pantry unlocked?
knows the most bootleggers? knows the fewest boot
leggers? has the most cars? looks the gentlest? will
take you?

Now the other side. We advise the houses which
"welcomed only a favored few" to drop thirty bids,
addressed to "Smith, Campus," ni the mail. If the Smiths
don't bite, try the Joneses. Also save money by pledg
ing the cook and making him work for his board.

Lester McSneer wants to know if the population fled
into the mountains when the City of Honolulu burned.
No, Lester, they bounded over the billows. There was
a hot time in the old town, anyhow.

Announcement: Next Tuesday being Ash Wednesday,
there will be an open-air meeting in the Art Gallery to
decide what color we will white-wash the Stadium. A
speaker who has been engaged will be selected at ran
dom to deliver an address on "Why Married Men Make
the Best Husbands." Everybody is invited. Law majors
only will be admitted.

The earthy color of University drinking-water of late
reminds one of the pre-Volstead toast—"Here's mud in
your eye." It must be nourishing, at any rate.

Looks now as if "golf" will cease to be synonymous
with "goof." More power to the knights of the niblick,
says Cabbage, hastening to offer mention in this colyum
of the charter member of the "Hole in One" Club.

Cabbages has uncovered a new contributor in the
person of Homer Cayenne, '26, who says that we will
hear from him as long as he can outrun the sophomores.
Homer's first production proves that he has an analytical
mind:
A dream of pulchritude beneath a bough,
A quart of milk, a cake of yeast—that's how
Complexions blossom in the wilderness.
He who can out-flash Fleischmann is thrice blest.
This goal so keenly sought by sons of men
Whose key's the all-important vitamen —
That girlish glow; that skin you love to touch.
Do we eat yeast for health? Ye Gods! Not much!

SOUSE: Shay, wheresh the other shide of the street?
. COPPER: Right over there.
SOUSE: Thash funny. Man just told me wash over
here!

Pel: Why did you stop smoking?
Mel: Got tired of walking miles for camels.

EVEN THE MOST LAVISH SPENDTHRIFT DOES
NOT ENCOURAGE TIPPING IN CANOES-
