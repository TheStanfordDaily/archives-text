The two editorials in today's D. P. A.
headed "What California Thinks of Us,"
and "Get It Off Your Chest" gave im
petus to this urge to "break the ice."
Behold the mighty power of the tin
god who sits in judgment within the
walls and portals of the California Stadi
um. Yes, hearken to his latest squeak.
The center of knowledge, culture, and
learning has once- more bespoken itself.
And we of the "Farm" must quail be
fore this latest outburst of righteous
rseentment.
"A mock heroism, coupled with a sort
of 'holier-than-thou* attitude has resulted
in Stanford's withdrawal from the Pacif
ic Coast Conference." It should not
be our worry or concern if the gentle
men from Berkeley have thus mistaken
a spirit that manifests resentment against
unfairness and injustice. The confer
ence neither included Stanford in its
preliminary "telegraphic vote," nor ex
tended any sort of an invitation or of
fer for this institution to deal in the sub
sequent formal gathering of representa
tives. Then what bearing could the action
of that meeting have upon us? What
could its reprimand or ultimatium mean
to us, since we were not permitted or
asked to take part in sulch official action?
No rhas the Conference yet made clear
its stand on all problems relating to
this affair; it declined to answer the
three questions put to it by the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control. Thus, fail
ing both to see our own "wrong" and to
understand the position that the Confer

ence is taking, our action would most
certainly resolve itself into a withdrawal
from the Conference when that body has
seen fit to reprimand us.
Practically, Stanford's action may re
sult disastrously both to herself and to
the Conference. But on principle, our
stand can hardly be questioned, and as
an issue, it is the matter of principle that
should be paramount.
As for a spirit of frankness and open
ness in intercollegiate relations (of which
the Californians seem to think we are
lacking), we have only to recall the lat
est exploit of the Golden Bear in deal
ing with the Tournament of Roses cam
mittee, behind the Conference's back.
No, the "Redshirts" have nothing to re
gret or worry about.
