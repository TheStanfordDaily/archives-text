# SECRET PRACTICE IS RESORTED TO By VARSITY SQUAD
## Special Preparations for Game With Madigan's Team Exclude Visitors From Field 
### 
Andy Kerr quietly slid the gates
shut in the face of inquisitive victors
last night, and veiled the moves of his
Card varsity in secrecy for the first
time.
"Red" Betts and his grays entered
the enclosure shortly after five o'clock,
and emerged half an hour later, with
nothing to say.
Conjecture may be forced to take
the place of observation quite often
hereafter, unless some new knot-holes
are added to the fence.
What went on behind that green
fence, eight feet high, but as effective
as the Chinese wall? It is practically
certain that Kerr, after years of asso
ciation with the strategist, Warner,
has something up his sleeve new to
Coast football. And it is almost as
certain that if the going gets hard in
the St. Mary's game Saturday, out
will come a few new plays.
"Flsish" Madigan, former Notre
Uame star, and the "fighting" type of
coach, is not held lightly by Kerr or
Thornhill. Gone are "Moose" MacCor
mack, Pete Bahan, and others of the
Phoenix squad that held Stanford to
a 10-7 score last year. But in their
places have come Black, quarter;
Prelli and Hoopli, halves, and Hunger
ford, tackle—names that are less well
known in college gridiron circles.
Then again, closed doors may mean
a shake-up in the varsity line-up. Kerr
isn't any too well satisfied with the
outcomes of the first two games. He
has material galore for the line, and
plenty of promising, though somewhat
inexperienced, backs.
There are enough "white hopes" on
the squad to be more than a match
for any gang of bruisers. Of the thirty
seven candidates ten weigh over 190
pounds, and fifteen are either six feet
or over.
Los Angeles is by far the best repre
sented place on the squad, with seven
hailing from there. San Francisco is
next with four "prides." Outside of
Fullerton, the other places only have
one representative.
