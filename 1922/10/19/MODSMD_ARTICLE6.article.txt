# Nestoria Will Debate on Issue of "500" Abolition
## 
### 
Once every year, it seems that it is
necessary to drag forth the old ques
tion as to whether or not the "500"
should be abolished from Stanford.
Nestoria Debating Society will renew
the discussion at their regular meet
ing tonight at 7:30 in Room 12 of the
Law Building.
James P. McMenamin, '20, captain
ing the affirmative, will try to show
the benefit such action would have at
Stanford. His opponent captain will
be E. K. Baum, *22. Each talk will be
limited to five minutes, after which
the house will be divided and two
minute speeches will be delivered from
men picked at random about the room.
It is hoped that by this method all
new men will be encouraged to partici
pate in the discussion.
