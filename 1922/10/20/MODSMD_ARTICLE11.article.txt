# ELECUTIONIST FROM BELGIUM WILL GIVE READINGS TUESDAY
## 
### 
Miss Claire Werleman, Belgian elo
cutionist, will give a program of
French readings in the Little Theater i
at 7:30 next Tuesday evening. This '
program, which wiTT take the place of j
the usual Tuesday evening lecture, is I
being given under the joint auspices
of the French Club and the Committee i
on Public Exercises.
Miss Werleman is a graduate of the j
Royal Conservatory of Brussels and J
has the distinction of having won the j
first prize in a contest conducted by I
the Conservatory for determining the :
best elocutionist among its students. !
The winning of this prize would have j
served as the open sesame to a pro- :
fessional stage career, but Miss Werle
man has never taken advantage of her '
opportunity, and has spent the past
few years as a teacher of French in â– 
Holland.
The program which will be given
Tuesday evening includes two selec
tions from Moliere and a number of
monologues. It is an example of what j
the French people consider the art of
a public speaker, and will enable the
audience to draw comparisons between
our own standards of elocution and !
those of the French.
