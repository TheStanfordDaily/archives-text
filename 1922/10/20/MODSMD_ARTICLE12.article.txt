# VARSITY AND SECOND SOCCER CLUBS WILL MEET VIKING TEAM
## 
### 
When the soccer varsity meets the I
Vikings in the San Francisco stadium !
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, the Cardinal j
dopsters will have a chance to size np I
the true strength of the Stanford team, j
A hard game is expected, as last Satur- j
day the Vikings downed California. This
game practically eliminated the Blue and
Gold from the race for the championship
as the Olympics won the first game of ;
the season from the Bruins.
Both the varsity and second teams are j
going strong, and great improvement was
shown in dribbling and in goal kicking
during the past week. Coach Harry
Maloney is again using the long passing
game which did much last season in win
ning the cup for the Cards.
While the varsity is playing the first
Viking team, the Stanford second team
will meet the Viking Seconds, in the
first game of the Second Division of the
University and Club league.
Due to the fact that men who have
played on the varsity cannot be trans
ferred back to the second team with
out losing their eligibility for the first
team, the second squad will be somewhat
weaker than the team which held the!
varsity to its single score in the practice
game.
Both squads will meet at the Southern
Pacific Depot to catch the 11 :34 train.
The line-ups follow:
Varsity: Masters, (captain), goal;
Hayes and Clark, fullbacks; Swayne,
Off, Walther, halfbacks; Green, Peavy,
Taam, Deffeback, and Quigley, forwards.
Second Varsity: Genereaux, goal;
Bucklin and Eggleston, fullbacks; Smith,
Snow, and John, halfbacks; Titus, Car
doza, Timmons, Burnev, and Lusignan,
forwards.
