# BAY CITY SUPERIOR TO LOS ANGELES IS DECISION OF DEBATE
## 
### 
San Francisco is much superior to
Los Angeles if the decision made at
the meeting of Euphronia Debating
Society Wednesday has any weight.
Herbert Alexander, '22, and Edward
Landels, '22, held their opponents for
downs and emerged the victors after
a heated and humorous discussion.
The following men were given mem
bership in Euphronia last Wednesday:
Coughton Wells, Fred Ludeke, C. H.
Babcock, Frank Crisi, C. R. Clifford,
C. S. Bowen, C. S. Wainscott, Hale
Dinsmoor, Marion Crist, Louis Joffc,
Aram Ahasapian, and W. H. Odemar.
