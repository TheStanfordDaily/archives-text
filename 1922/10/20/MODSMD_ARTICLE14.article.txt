# BABES DETERMINED TO GIVE BERKELEY LOW END OF SCORE
## Fast, Shifty Backfield Will Enter For Frosh; "Buck" Faust Injured in Practice 
### 
There won't be any false patriotism,
of the sort that is keeping Cort Majors
and "Fat" Latham out of their places in
the Olympic line-up, on exhibit in the
! Freshman-Berkeley high engagement to
morrow.
Howard Mitchell, who was captain and
star of the Berkeley team last year, will
start at quarter for the Babes, and he is
out to ding his former team-mates for
as many points as Coach Hunt thinks
necessary.
That is the spirit in which Hunt is
l sending the entire freshman team into
j the field . It is one of those games that
j has to be won, whether the other side
likes it or not.
Probably Berkeley's huskies have the
! same idea in mind. Mike Murphy, full-
I back, Bob Green, 200-pound center, Jolin
| ny Clyme, quarter, and the other veterans
j certainly won't lose this chance to show
Professor E. P. Hunt just how well they
! learned football under his tutelage, tor
j Schaeffer, the new coach, it is the oppor
| tunity to show Hunt he is not the only
1 one who can send out championship elev
