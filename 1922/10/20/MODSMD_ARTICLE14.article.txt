# BABES DETERMINED TO GIVE BERKELEY LOW END OF SCORE
## Fast, Shifty Backfield Will Enter For Frosh; "Buck" Faust Injured in Practice 
### 
There won't be any false patriotism,
of the sort that is keeping Cort Majors
and "Fat" Latham out of their places in
the Olympic line-up, on exhibit in the
! Freshman-Berkeley high engagement to
morrow.
Howard Mitchell, who was captain and
star of the Berkeley team last year, will
start at quarter for the Babes, and he is
out to ding his former team-mates for
as many points as Coach Hunt thinks
necessary.
That is the spirit in which Hunt is
l sending the entire freshman team into
j the field . It is one of those games that
j has to be won, whether the other side
likes it or not.
Probably Berkeley's huskies have the
! same idea in mind. Mike Murphy, full-
I back, Bob Green, 200-pound center, Jolin
| ny Clyme, quarter, and the other veterans
j certainly won't lose this chance to show
Professor E. P. Hunt just how well they
! learned football under his tutelage, tor
j Schaeffer, the new coach, it is the oppor
| tunity to show Hunt he is not the only
1 one who can send out championship elev
ively. At guards there will be Bob
Cravens and George Houck, both weigh
ing over 190 pounds.
Captain DeGroot is a cinch, for center,
where he will be opposed by either Mc-
Neill or Mahoney of the Oaklanders.
DeGroot received some hard bumps in
the Santa Clara contest, but he stopped
everything that came his way.
"Bud" Woodward has apparently got
ten the contract for the quarterback
job. He will be assisted by Art Wilcox
and Doughty at half, and Cuddeback at
full. Keep your eye on that trio, for if
they can ever get going, three touch
downs will seem mighty small.
"Dummy practice" occupied most of
Kerr's time last night. The first eleven
lined-up opposite the grays, but there
was no real tackling. If the Cards get
within the St. Mary's 35-yard line, it

is a safe guess that Cuddeback will try
a place kick. He was lifting them over
the goal from the 40- yard line last
night.
Here is a line of reasoning by which
the Phoenix rooters figure they have a
chance tomorrow: California beat Santa
Clara 45-14 in the Bears' first game;
two weeks later St. Rlary's lost to the
Bruins, 41-0. Whereupon the Oaklanders
figure they are stronger than Santa Clara,
whom Stanford beat 7-0. and so hope
for a victoryâ€”all of which may or may
not mean something.
The probable line-ups :
'Stanford Position St. Mary's
Mertz LER Murdoch
Shipkey LTR Hungerford
Houck LGR Nelson
DeGroot (C) C McNeill
Cravens RGL Snow
Johnston RTL Corrigan
Dole REL Kuahane
Woodward QB (C) Black
Wilcox RHL Hoopli
Doughty LHR Prelli
Cuddeback FB Starter
