# Cardinals Have Edge on Madigan’s Saints
## Kerr's Warriors Are Due to Show Better Form Than in First Two Games of Season 
### 
Captain "Dud" DcGroot and liis gang
of gridiron huskies arc just about due.
Sooner or later the real Cardinal var
sity of 1922—a shifty,hard-charging,
fighting eleven—is bound to make its ap
pearance. And tomorrow afternoon, when
"Flash" Madigan brings on his St. Mary's
hopefuls, seems the logical time.
One thing and another has put the
jinx on the triumphal entry of Andy
Kerr's new eleven. In the opening game
the opposition was too strong for the in
experienced Cardinal line. Against Santa
Clara, for some reason, the Stanford
touchdowns weren't forth-coming as
they should have been.
Tomorrow, with all of the varsity ex
cept Janssen and Murray in good con
dition, it should he a different story.
For nearly a week Kerr has been drilling
the squad on defences for the Notre
Dame shift—and has added some new
methods of attack.
On paper, the Cards are ahead by,
three touchdowns or so, but it wouldn't
do to bet more than your spare shoe
strings on it. "Flash" Madigan is a
fighter; his team is a fighting one ;and
neither of them give up until the final
gun pops. The Saints aren't thinking
that they will win, but they have hopes
of the unexpected.
Whether they succeed or not depends
on "Tiny" Thornhill's fence. Johnston
is back at right tackle, and Dole will take
right end again. Johnston's return means
more holes for the backs to go through,
and fewer St. Mary's gains. Shipkey,
with his broken nose, and Mertz will
start at left tackle and left end, respect
ens from across the bay.
Whoever wins will have to fight to the
last scrimmage.
Besides their general determination,
the Dinks have another incentive to vic
tory. Coach Hunt announced last night
that the first squad will be posted Mon
day, choices depending largely on what is
done tomorrow, and who does it.
Another candidate was added to Regin
ald Denny's arnica squad by last night's
practice. "Buck" Faust, handy man in
the frosh backfield, lit wrong side up
and will be out of play for a week.
The halves now written in to start are
Clayes and Cook, both as fast as the
timekeeper's watch but not .especially
heavy.
Since Dickson went up the street to
California, Berkeley high has no par
ticularly strong punter. The absence of
Ernie Nevers' boot, therefore, will not be
so much felt as it would if Dickson in
stead of Mills were doing the kicking.
Incidentally, there will be a pretty punt
ing duel between Ernie and "Dick" in
the little big game.
The Dink's line is their weakest point.
The two ends, Bob Nicholson, left tackle,
and Hunt, center, are all that the doctor
has left to the first team's wall. Harville,
Cameron, and Armour, are mentioned for
guards, and Boone for the other tackle.
Fassoth and McDermot are on the ends
as usual. The rest of the regulars are
out of scrimmage for a week or more.
The tentative backfield is: Solomon,

full; Clayes ancl Cook, halves, and Mitch
ell, quarter, with Nick Kir wan ready to
take his place at the helm.
Berkeley's plays will be called by John
ny Clymer, whom Hunt himself says is
practically unbeatable as a field general.
A piece of good luck came Hunt's way
last night. It was in the shape of Thorn
ton Scribner, a 200-pound guard from
Napa high school who changed from
swimming to a football suit. Two hun
dred pounds is acceptable on most any
line, not to mention the yearlings' bat
tered exhibit.
The game starts at 1 :30 tomorrow, with
St. Mary's and the varsity taking the
field immediately after.

they should have been.
Tomorrow, with all of the varsity ex
cept Janssen and Murray in good con
dition, it should he a different story.
For nearly a week Kerr has been drilling
the squad on defences for the Notre
Dame shift—and has added some new
methods of attack.
On paper, the Cards are ahead by,
three touchdowns or so, but it wouldn't
do to bet more than your spare shoe
strings on it. "Flash" Madigan is a
fighter; his team is a fighting one ;and
neither of them give up until the final
gun pops. The Saints aren't thinking
that they will win, but they have hopes
of the unexpected.
Whether they succeed or not depends
on "Tiny" Thornhill's fence. Johnston
is back at right tackle, and Dole will take
right end again. Johnston's return means
more holes for the backs to go through,
and fewer St. Mary's gains. Shipkey,
with his broken nose, and Mertz will
start at left tackle and left end, respect
ens from across the bay.
Whoever wins will have to fight to the
last scrimmage.
Besides their general determination,
the Dinks have another incentive to vic
tory. Coach Hunt announced last night
that the first squad will be posted Mon
day, choices depending largely on what is
done tomorrow, and who does it.
Another candidate was added to Regin
ald Denny's arnica squad by last night's
practice. "Buck" Faust, handy man in
the frosh backfield, lit wrong side up
and will be out of play for a week.
The halves now written in to start are
Clayes and Cook, both as fast as the
timekeeper's watch but not .especially
heavy.
Since Dickson went up the street to
California, Berkeley high has no par
ticularly strong punter. The absence of
Ernie Nevers' boot, therefore, will not be
so much felt as it would if Dickson in
stead of Mills were doing the kicking.
Incidentally, there will be a pretty punt
ing duel between Ernie and "Dick" in
the little big game.
The Dink's line is their weakest point.
The two ends, Bob Nicholson, left tackle,
and Hunt, center, are all that the doctor
has left to the first team's wall. Harville,
Cameron, and Armour, are mentioned for
guards, and Boone for the other tackle.
Fassoth and McDermot are on the ends
as usual. The rest of the regulars are
out of scrimmage for a week or more.
The tentative backfield is: Solomon,

full; Clayes ancl Cook, halves, and Mitch
ell, quarter, with Nick Kir wan ready to
take his place at the helm.
Berkeley's plays will be called by John
ny Clymer, whom Hunt himself says is
practically unbeatable as a field general.
A piece of good luck came Hunt's way
last night. It was in the shape of Thorn
ton Scribner, a 200-pound guard from
Napa high school who changed from
swimming to a football suit. Two hun
dred pounds is acceptable on most any
line, not to mention the yearlings' bat
tered exhibit.
The game starts at 1 :30 tomorrow, with
St. Mary's and the varsity taking the
field immediately after.
Captain "Dud" DcGroot and liis gang
of gridiron huskies arc just about due.
Sooner or later the real Cardinal var
sity of 1922—a shifty,hard-charging,
fighting eleven—is bound to make its ap
pearance. And tomorrow afternoon, when
"Flash" Madigan brings on his St. Mary's
hopefuls, seems the logical time.
One thing and another has put the
jinx on the triumphal entry of Andy
Kerr's new eleven. In the opening game
the opposition was too strong for the in
experienced Cardinal line. Against Santa
Clara, for some reason, the Stanford
touchdowns weren't forth-coming as
they should have been.
