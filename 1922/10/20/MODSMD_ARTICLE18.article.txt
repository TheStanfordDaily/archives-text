# Cardinals Have Edge on Madigan’s Saints
## Kerr's Warriors Are Due to Show Better Form Than in First Two Games of Season 
### 
Captain "Dud" DcGroot and liis gang
of gridiron huskies arc just about due.
Sooner or later the real Cardinal var
sity of 1922—a shifty,hard-charging,
fighting eleven—is bound to make its ap
pearance. And tomorrow afternoon, when
"Flash" Madigan brings on his St. Mary's
hopefuls, seems the logical time.
One thing and another has put the
jinx on the triumphal entry of Andy
Kerr's new eleven. In the opening game
the opposition was too strong for the in
experienced Cardinal line. Against Santa
Clara, for some reason, the Stanford
touchdowns weren't forth-coming as
they should have been.
Tomorrow, with all of the varsity ex
cept Janssen and Murray in good con
dition, it should he a different story.
For nearly a week Kerr has been drilling
the squad on defences for the Notre
Dame shift—and has added some new
methods of attack.
On paper, the Cards are ahead by,
three touchdowns or so, but it wouldn't
do to bet more than your spare shoe
strings on it. "Flash" Madigan is a
fighter; his team is a fighting one ;and
neither of them give up until the final
gun pops. The Saints aren't thinking
that they will win, but they have hopes
of the unexpected.
Whether they succeed or not depends
on "Tiny" Thornhill's fence. Johnston
is back at right tackle, and Dole will take
right end again. Johnston's return means
more holes for the backs to go through,
and fewer St. Mary's gains. Shipkey,
with his broken nose, and Mertz will
start at left tackle and left end, respect
