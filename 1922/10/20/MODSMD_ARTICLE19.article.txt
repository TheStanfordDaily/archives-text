# COACH BETTS' GRAYS WILL PLAY FIRST GAMES OF SEASON
## 
### 
Coach Betts' Grays have two tough
jobs cut. out for them tomorrow when
they meet California Polytechnic In
stitute at 10 o'clock in the morning
and Santa Cruz High School at one
o'clock in the afternoon. Both games
will be played on the old freshman
field. Although little definite informa
tion concerning either of the invading
elevens is available, both should be
strong if past performances count for
anything.
Tomorrow's games will be the first
of the season for the Grays and Coach
Betts is sending two strong combina
tions onto the field. The Grays have
been handicapped somewhat in devel
oping an offensive as they have been
forced to play on the defensive against
Coach Kerr's squad most of the time.
As a result, Betts has developed a
strong defensive and will rely mainly
on an open game tomorrow. In the
"dummy scrimmage" with the varsity
last night, the Grays kept Kerr's men
guessing with their aerial work.
The Grays will line up tomorrow as
follows: Morning game: Center, Wil
liams; guards, Hayes and Rogers;
tackles, Robinson and Haberkorn;
ends, Black and Widaman; quarter,
Blacker; right half, Hamilton; left

ernoon game: Center, Davidson;

er game are: Center, Dunbar; guards,
Simmons and Crawford; tackles, Mc-
