# SEASON TICKETS TO BE ON SALE MONDAY FOR CAMPUS PLAYS
## 
### 
Season tickets for the five dramatic
shows of the year will be put on sale
Monday by the Dramatic Council. These
tickets are to be sold at a reduced price
and will guarantee the owner an or
chestra seat jn the best part of the As
sembly Hall.
The plan is a new one with the Dram
atic Council*md, according to John Rich
er, '24, Dramatic Manager, it promises
to be very popular, especially with the,
residents of Palo Alto. "Four hundred
tickets are expected to sell next week,
so those on the campus who want good
scats at the plays will do well to purchase
a season ticket and be assured of a re
served place," says Richer. "With the
four hundred best seats gone there will
not be much left to choose from when
the final drawings are made at the indi
vidual plays," he adds.
"Her Husband's Wife" will be the
first play for which these tickets are
sold. The other shows are those given
by the Sophomore class, Masquers, Eng
lish Club and the Senior class.
Tickets will be on sale at the Book
store and Crandall's or orders may be
mailed to the Dramatic Council.
