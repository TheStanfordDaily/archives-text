# NEW PLAN FORMED IN INTRAMURAL TENNIS
## 
### 
Entries for the inter-class intramural
tennis toifrnament will close on Fri
day, October 25, and matches in the
first round begin the following Mon
day. All first round matches must be
played off by the end of that week.
Entry lists are filling up well, ex
cept that of the Junior class, which is
falling behind the standard set by the
other three classes. Davis has devised
a new plan, which is expected to bring
about an increase in the number of
contestants. Each match played in this
tournament will give each player
credit for one full period of compulsory
Physical Training, and lie will be ex
empted from as man hours as he
plays matches in the tournament.
In order that men may reach their
opponents more easily, all are re
quested to place address and telephone
number opposite their names on the
Gymnasium bulletin board.
