# Dr. Melish Will Talk on "Mission of Womanhood"
## 
### 
"The High Mission of Womanhood
to the Twentieth Century" is the sub
ject chosen by the Reverend John
Howard Melish of Brooklyn, N. Y., for
his sermon at the Memorial Church
next Sunday.
Woman is coming into her own, Dr.
Melish believes, and man will have to
recognize that she is no longer merely
a "helpmeet." What is her place in the
new era? How will she rise to it?
What is the new relation between men
and women? These questions will be
discussed by the speaker next Sunday.
Dr. Melish, who has been rector of
the Church of the Holy Trinity in
Brooklyn for the last 18 years, has
had wide experience in social service
work and labor movements in New
York and the East.
He is a graduate of the University
of Cincinnati and of Harvard, and he
later held the position of chaplain and
instructor in the University of Cin
cinnati. This is Dr. Melisli's first trip
to the Pacific Coast.
