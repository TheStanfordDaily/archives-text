# SETTING WARNER'S CRITICS RIGHT
## 
### 
United Press dispatches of recent date have
carried with them the impression that Glen War
ner will probably "he let out" at Pittsburg be
cause of the "disappointing 1 showing his team
is making." It is certain that the writer of the
story knew nothing of the background of the
Stanford-W arner-Pittsburg situation when he
made this among other colorful insinuations.
Glenn Warner made up his mind to come west
long before he struck his present temporary los
ing streak. And when he finally closed with Stan
ford authorities, he would have been more than
willing to have begun coaching them at once. His
contract, however, kept him at Pitt for two years
more and he consequently arranged his contract
with Stanford so as not to conflict with the east
ern university's plans.
Any declarations that are being made, if any
have been made, certainly do not come from
people in authority at Pittsburg. They have had
Warner with them long enough to know him.
They want to keep him as long as he will stay.
The United Press dispatch said "that Pitt fol
lowers are not accustomed to a losing team."
Of course, they're not. Who but Glenn Warner
has been coaching them through year after year
of victories? A momentary application of any
one of the rules for straight thinking will soon
upset any such fabrication as the dispatch in
question has sprung on the public.
