# A 						CHEER FOR THE WIND-JAMMERS
## 
### 
Stanford debaters have suddenly quit wooing
the arms of Morpheus and have startled people
interested in local forensic circles by announcing
their intention to debate a live topic. If there is
anything more tiresome than listening to a bunch
of youthful orators reciting from memory a lot
of stale statistics 011 an even staler question, it
is yet to be heard of. Practical experience in de
bating loses ninety per cent of its effectiveness
when an old topic for discussion is chosen —a
topic which has been covered by college debaters
since the beginning—one for which the subject
matter has already been uprooted and exposed
to the fatigued eyes of an enduring public for
years.
The proposed water and power amendment to
the state constitution, to be voted 011 November
7, is to be the question for the triangular debate
among Stanford.California and U. S. C. on the
evening of the general elections. This contro
versial question is not only of general interest to
the public but affords an opportunity for original
thinking, worth-while investigation, and practical
application of actual knowledge. It is alive. There
is something new to be said on both sides. And
best of all, people who go to hear the debates
will not be there as a matter of duty. They will
go to hear something they haven't heard before—
not to hear platitudes expressed in inverted forms
for the purpose of exercising the vocal cords.
A cheer for the wind-jammers. They must
have been represented at the Pageant of Progress.
