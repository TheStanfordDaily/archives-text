# CABBAGES and THINGS

H. M. '24

After having seen the "Broadway Rose" we came
home and just had to work off our surplus energy some
how. Asked Mayberry if she wanted to go for a walk
in the lake; nope. Asked Junie if she wanted to look
at the moon; offered Marchine a glimpse of the church
by starlight; no go. So these co-eds will have to suffer
the consequences. I've turned Rough. And hereby in
this issue Cabbages takes a vow to run a Rough's
Corner darn near every issue. Expose these women,
say we. And the more of 'em we ran expose, the better.
Not a one of the 500 shall escape!
* * <¥
Who is the stingiest man? Much question was re
cently raised over this mammoth question by questions
questioning the advisability of putting bannisters in the
new Toyon Hall. One father wrote in that his son could
not come to college if bannisters were installed. His
son has always wanted to slide down stairs on one,
and father refuses because of the wear on son's pants.
* * *
However, a local man has taken the honors away
from the proceeding. He is so stingy he refuses to
show anyone his gold tooth.

There was a lawyer of great renown
There was a lawyer of great renown
Until he
Dropped the bids and cut for town
Freshmen gathered all around
Ha, ha, ha,
Ho, ho, ho,
WE BIT!
The lawyer said, "I'm back tonight."
The lawyer said, "I'm back tonight!"
But then he
Must have had an awful fright
For of his face —no, not a sight.
Ha, ha, ha,
Ho, ho, ho,
WE BIT!
The wreck was awful to behold
The rushing rules were knocked out cold.
My Gawd, the scores of logs the bosses rolled
And so the conference lies cold.
Ha, ha, ha,
Ho, ho, ho,
WE BIT!
