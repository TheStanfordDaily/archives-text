The editorial columns of the Daily
California!! seem to have taken it upon
themselves also to reprimand Stan
ford for her withdrawal from the Pa
cific Coast Conference. We wonder
how they get that way. It seems
to us that they have eased us a slam
that does need some comment.
"Stanford," says the Daily Cali
fornian, "has done what might be ex
pected of Stanford. The Cardinals are
running true to form. A mock heroism,
coupled with a sort of 'holier-than
thou' attitude has resulted in Stan
ford's withdrawal from the Pacific-
Coast Conference."
It is of our opinion that the writer
of such bunk is extremely narrow
minded if not down-right dumb. Or we
may lay it to his egotistical eagerness
to display some of the California
spirit, although we have never heard
of such a thing.
About the only thing written in that
whole waste of rhetoric that rings with
truth is that "the Cardinals are run
ning true to form." Quite true indeed.
He said it! And we may incidentally
call his attention to the fact that if he
keeps his eye on that form he might
witness some developments that will
cull for a more worthy use of his pen.
As far as California is concerned,
she ought to be glad to have Stanford
stay in the conference, let alone put
ting herself out to offer any repri
mands. She would do better to keep
still and hope for the best. There is
no doubt in our minds that the con
ference authorities can handle this
situation in the proper manner, un
aided by any such bursts of childish
ness as came forth from the California
press.
Is (here a bigger drawing card in
collegiate sports anywhere in the West
than the Stanford J Qalifornia game?
Anybody with an ounce of brains can
see California's advantage if this
squabble should die out and Stanford's
resignation overlooked. It means
money in California's athletic treasury,
and we are not ashamed to admit that
we need it too. More than that, it
means a cooperation between us that
Stanford has always wished to foster.
The writer of that Daily Californian
editorial might well direct his opinions
toward sources that would bring better
results. Mud slinging will get them
nowhere, while a little bit of common
sense might help matters a great deal.
