# PROMOTE WOMEN'S INTERESTS ADVISES DEAN IN ASSEMBLY
## Coach Kerr Urges Women to Show Stanford Spirit by Supporting Football Teams 
### 
"By promoting women's interests on the
| campus, we can more adequately co-oper
ate with the University and with student
activities," said Dean Yost in speaking
at the women's assembly last night in the
Little Theater.
"The fact that most of you are here
tonight shows tjiat you feel yourselves
to be a unit," she said. "Women have to
develop the instinct to work together,
j American college women are in a uosition
to get this group instinct and that is why
I think a college education is so wonder-
I ful. Here we have the group feeling
and the individual gives way before it."
Dean Yost, in talking of the rules and'
regulations which apply to Stanford
women, pointed out that these rules are
made by the women themselves through
conference and council whose members
are elected by the women. "When you
need a regulation changed, you will
find that this can easily be done. Each
one of you puts yourselves on your per
sonal honor in keeping these rules. Do
not deceive yourself with false reasons
for breaking them and do not deceive
others in this matter, because by doing
so you undermine faith not only in your
selves as individuals but also in the whole
of the five hundred."
Dean Yost commended the spirit of
honesty in which the new Pan-Hellenic
ruling is being carried out. "If we make
a success of it, we will have done more to
ward solving the sorority problem, than
has been accomplished before. We want
to work together, not only for the women
but for the University and for the men
and, what men arc especially interested
in, men's athletics," she concluded.
Coach Andy Kerr urged the women to
stand behind the teams and show some
of the famed Stanford spirit which sup
ports the men whether they are winning
or losing. "I want the men to be a
bunch of raving, righting football foo's
when they go on the field, rough but
ready to play square and fight as hard
as they know how. If you can help
us do this, you can help Stanford's team.
"I don't know what the team is going
to do," said Coach Kerr in reference to
the prospects for the remainder of the
season. "If you have as much confidence
in the men as the coaches have, they will
do something big. Give them your sup
port and cooperation and remember that
it takes more than a year or two to build
'a team."
Coach Kerr gave a non-technical ex
planation of the new football rulings
and explained some of the commoner
penalties, advising the women to notice
St. Mary's team particularly next Satur
day. to decide for themselves whether
St. Mary's shift plays arc legal.
Margaret White, '23, president of Or
ganized Women, gave a short talk in
which she emphasized the importance
of keeping up the enthusiasm with which
this year has been started.
