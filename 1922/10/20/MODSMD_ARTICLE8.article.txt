# Davies and Mertz Lose In First Tennis Round
## 
### 
Fighting an uphill battle but with ex
perience giving them the edge at the
finish "Peck" Griffen and Willis Davis,
nationally known tennis stars, beat out
Jimmy Davis and Ted Mertz of the
Stanford varsity 3-6, 9-7, 8-6, in the
feature match of the early rounds of
the San Jose All Comers Championship
Tournament played on the courts of the
San Jose Eennis Club at the Hotel
Vendome.
Griffen, who formerly held the national
doubles title along with Bill Johnsten,
and Davis, once singles champion of the
Pacific Coast, were many times within
a point of losing the match after they had
dropped the first set. Davies and Mertz
forced both of the final sets to deuce
but were never able to put over the
winning ball. All four players were in
top form, Mertz especially surprising
the gallery with his shots.
