# ONE POINT WINS GAME FOR BABES
## 
### Phil Newill, '24 
A drop kick that sailed under the
cross bar instead of over it gave the
frsehmen a one-point victory in the
semi-final Saturday.
Clymer, the Berkeley ..high quarter
back, had made two out of three of
his drop tries-for-point before, aud wan
willing to take a chance on the more
difficult boot again in the last minutes
of the fourth quarter. He lost, and so
did his team. 27-26.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men starred
for both sides. Seven of his last year's
champions were back on the Berkeley
team, prominent among them Murphy
and Mills, halfbacks, and Clymer, quar
ter.
Game Series of Sprints
The game looked like an Irish mara
thon. Little Bill Cook, the Dinks' half,
got loose four times for a total of 190
yards, scording on one; "Buck" Faust,
who went into the game with a bad cut
over his eye, ran sixty yards to the
goal line with an intercepted pass in
the first quarter, and A1 Clayes, an
other of the Speed Bros., took the ball
seventy yards through an open field for
the Babes' final tally.
Elias Post, younger brother of As
sistant Coach Post, nabbed a pass of
Solomon's and ran through the fresh
man line for thirty yards for the preps'
first score. Smith, a sub fullback who
went in for Moffat in the second half,
made the score that nearly tied things
up in the fourth quarter, on a pass
and forty-five yard run.
It was not good football, but both
sides seemed to be enjoying them
selves, and the spectators undoubtedly
got their cheering's worth.
Teams Take Turns Scoring
The two teums took turns scoring in
the first, second, and fourth quarters.
In the third quarter they took turns
dropping the ball. Both had equally
weak lines, though Berkeley outbucked
the Dinks in the first half.
The game was about three minutes
old when Faust grabbed a pass of
Mills' intended for Mike Murphy,
hiked sixty yards down the field with
it, and later his try for goal.
It was then Berkeley's turn, and
Mills started out with a thirty-yard
end run. Bucks by Murphy, Mills, and
Moffat, a final plunge of ten yards by
Mr. Murphy, and Clymer's successful
drop kick squared accounts, 7-7.
Passes Intercepted
The freshmen were taking it easy
when some Berkeley forwards rushed
in on Solomon, and forced him back.
He threw the ball in the hope that it
would be an incomplete pass and car
ried back to the scrimmage line. Post
grabbed it, and headed for the goal
posts with nobody to stop him. Clymer
drop kicked. Score, 14-7, Berkeley.
Shortly after. Cook caught a punt
from Mills, dropped it, grabbed it
again and ran his second heat of sev
enty-five yards to the opposite goal.
Faust kicked. Score, 14-lt.
The two scores in the second period
were made on passes. Mills had foozled
a punt, giving the frosh the ball thirty
yards from the goal. Nevers, who went
in for Cook, next caught a ten-yard
pass from Solomon. Bucks by Solo
mon, Nevers, and Faust carried the
ball to within five yards of the line,
and Solomon tossed a pass to Acker
man for the* six points. Faust made
the try. A pass, Mills, to Clymer, and
a twenty-yard run to the Babes' seven
yard line, followed by another pass
by the same pair over the line, made
the preps' score.
Clymer Fails
Here Clymer made his first mistake.
His drop failed, making the score 21-
20 at the end of the half.
Open play and fumbles marked the
third period, which was scoreless. Fol
lowing Clayes' seventy-yard dodging
run for touchdown in the last quarter
Nevers' kick was blocked, and the
frosh stood pat on twenty-seven points.
Except for Smith's catching a pass
from Mills and breaking away forty
five yards around left end the score
would have remained 21-20.

Touchdowns —• freshmen: Faust,

Murphy, Post, Clymer, Smith.
A drop kick that sailed under the
cross bar instead of over it gave the
frsehmen a one-point victory in the
semi-final Saturday.
Clymer, the Berkeley ..high quarter
back, had made two out of three of
his drop tries-for-point before, aud wan
willing to take a chance on the more
difficult boot again in the last minutes
of the fourth quarter. He lost, and so
did his team. 27-26.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men starred
for both sides. Seven of his last year's
champions were back on the Berkeley
team, prominent among them Murphy
and Mills, halfbacks, and Clymer, quar
ter.
Game Series of Sprints
The game looked like an Irish mara
thon. Little Bill Cook, the Dinks' half,
got loose four times for a total of 190
yards, scording on one; "Buck" Faust,
who went into the game with a bad cut
over his eye, ran sixty yards to the
goal line with an intercepted pass in
the first quarter, and A1 Clayes, an
other of the Speed Bros., took the ball
seventy yards through an open field for
the Babes' final tally.
Elias Post, younger brother of As
sistant Coach Post, nabbed a pass of
Solomon's and ran through the fresh
man line for thirty yards for the preps'
first score. Smith, a sub fullback who
went in for Moffat in the second half,
made the score that nearly tied things
up in the fourth quarter, on a pass
and forty-five yard run.
It was not good football, but both
sides seemed to be enjoying them
selves, and the spectators undoubtedly
got their cheering's worth.
Teams Take Turns Scoring
The two teums took turns scoring in
the first, second, and fourth quarters.
In the third quarter they took turns
dropping the ball. Both had equally
weak lines, though Berkeley outbucked
the Dinks in the first half.
The game was about three minutes
old when Faust grabbed a pass of
Mills' intended for Mike Murphy,
hiked sixty yards down the field with
it, and later his try for goal.
It was then Berkeley's turn, and
Mills started out with a thirty-yard
end run. Bucks by Murphy, Mills, and
Moffat, a final plunge of ten yards by
Mr. Murphy, and Clymer's successful
drop kick squared accounts, 7-7.
Passes Intercepted
The freshmen were taking it easy
when some Berkeley forwards rushed
in on Solomon, and forced him back.
He threw the ball in the hope that it
would be an incomplete pass and car
ried back to the scrimmage line. Post
grabbed it, and headed for the goal
posts with nobody to stop him. Clymer
drop kicked. Score, 14-7, Berkeley.
Shortly after. Cook caught a punt
from Mills, dropped it, grabbed it
again and ran his second heat of sev
enty-five yards to the opposite goal.
Faust kicked. Score, 14-lt.
The two scores in the second period
were made on passes. Mills had foozled
a punt, giving the frosh the ball thirty
yards from the goal. Nevers, who went
in for Cook, next caught a ten-yard
pass from Solomon. Bucks by Solo
mon, Nevers, and Faust carried the
ball to within five yards of the line,
and Solomon tossed a pass to Acker
man for the* six points. Faust made
the try. A pass, Mills, to Clymer, and
a twenty-yard run to the Babes' seven
yard line, followed by another pass
by the same pair over the line, made
the preps' score.
Clymer Fails
Here Clymer made his first mistake.
His drop failed, making the score 21-
20 at the end of the half.
Open play and fumbles marked the
third period, which was scoreless. Fol
lowing Clayes' seventy-yard dodging
run for touchdown in the last quarter
Nevers' kick was blocked, and the
frosh stood pat on twenty-seven points.
Except for Smith's catching a pass
from Mills and breaking away forty
five yards around left end the score
would have remained 21-20.

Murphy, Post, Clymer, Smith.
A drop kick that sailed under the
cross bar instead of over it gave the
frsehmen a one-point victory in the
semi-final Saturday.
Clymer, the Berkeley ..high quarter
back, had made two out of three of
his drop tries-for-point before, aud wan
willing to take a chance on the more
difficult boot again in the last minutes
of the fourth quarter. He lost, and so
did his team. 27-26.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men starred
for both sides. Seven of his last year's
champions were back on the Berkeley
team, prominent among them Murphy
and Mills, halfbacks, and Clymer, quar
ter.
Game Series of Sprints
The game looked like an Irish mara
thon. Little Bill Cook, the Dinks' half,
got loose four times for a total of 190
yards, scording on one; "Buck" Faust,
who went into the game with a bad cut
over his eye, ran sixty yards to the
goal line with an intercepted pass in
the first quarter, and A1 Clayes, an
other of the Speed Bros., took the ball
seventy yards through an open field for
the Babes' final tally.
Elias Post, younger brother of As
sistant Coach Post, nabbed a pass of
Solomon's and ran through the fresh
man line for thirty yards for the preps'
first score. Smith, a sub fullback who
went in for Moffat in the second half,
made the score that nearly tied things
up in the fourth quarter, on a pass
and forty-five yard run.
It was not good football, but both
sides seemed to be enjoying them
selves, and the spectators undoubtedly
got their cheering's worth.
Teams Take Turns Scoring
The two teums took turns scoring in
the first, second, and fourth quarters.
In the third quarter they took turns
dropping the ball. Both had equally
weak lines, though Berkeley outbucked
the Dinks in the first half.
The game was about three minutes
old when Faust grabbed a pass of
Mills' intended for Mike Murphy,
hiked sixty yards down the field with
it, and later his try for goal.
It was then Berkeley's turn, and
Mills started out with a thirty-yard
end run. Bucks by Murphy, Mills, and
Moffat, a final plunge of ten yards by
Mr. Murphy, and Clymer's successful
drop kick squared accounts, 7-7.
Passes Intercepted
The freshmen were taking it easy
when some Berkeley forwards rushed
in on Solomon, and forced him back.
He threw the ball in the hope that it
would be an incomplete pass and car
ried back to the scrimmage line. Post
grabbed it, and headed for the goal
posts with nobody to stop him. Clymer
drop kicked. Score, 14-7, Berkeley.
Shortly after. Cook caught a punt
from Mills, dropped it, grabbed it
again and ran his second heat of sev
enty-five yards to the opposite goal.
Faust kicked. Score, 14-lt.
The two scores in the second period
were made on passes. Mills had foozled
a punt, giving the frosh the ball thirty
yards from the goal. Nevers, who went
in for Cook, next caught a ten-yard
pass from Solomon. Bucks by Solo
mon, Nevers, and Faust carried the
ball to within five yards of the line,
and Solomon tossed a pass to Acker
man for the* six points. Faust made
the try. A pass, Mills, to Clymer, and
a twenty-yard run to the Babes' seven
yard line, followed by another pass
by the same pair over the line, made
the preps' score.
Clymer Fails
Here Clymer made his first mistake.
His drop failed, making the score 21-
20 at the end of the half.
Open play and fumbles marked the
third period, which was scoreless. Fol
lowing Clayes' seventy-yard dodging
run for touchdown in the last quarter
Nevers' kick was blocked, and the
frosh stood pat on twenty-seven points.
Except for Smith's catching a pass
from Mills and breaking away forty
five yards around left end the score
would have remained 21-20.
