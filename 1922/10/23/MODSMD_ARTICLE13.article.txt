# ONE POINT WINS GAME FOR BABES
## 
### Phil Newill, '24 
A drop kick that sailed under the
cross bar instead of over it gave the
frsehmen a one-point victory in the
semi-final Saturday.
Clymer, the Berkeley ..high quarter
back, had made two out of three of
his drop tries-for-point before, aud wan
willing to take a chance on the more
difficult boot again in the last minutes
of the fourth quarter. He lost, and so
did his team. 27-26.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men starred
for both sides. Seven of his last year's
champions were back on the Berkeley
team, prominent among them Murphy
and Mills, halfbacks, and Clymer, quar
ter.

The game looked like an Irish mara
thon. Little Bill Cook, the Dinks' half,
got loose four times for a total of 190
yards, scording on one; "Buck" Faust,
who went into the game with a bad cut
over his eye, ran sixty yards to the
goal line with an intercepted pass in
the first quarter, and A1 Clayes, an
other of the Speed Bros., took the ball
seventy yards through an open field for
the Babes' final tally.
Elias Post, younger brother of As
sistant Coach Post, nabbed a pass of
Solomon's and ran through the fresh
man line for thirty yards for the preps'
first score. Smith, a sub fullback who
went in for Moffat in the second half,
made the score that nearly tied things
up in the fourth quarter, on a pass
and forty-five yard run.
It was not good football, but both
sides seemed to be enjoying them
selves, and the spectators undoubtedly
got their cheering's worth.
