# GRAYS ARE VICTORS IN DOUBLE HEADER; FUMBLES MAR GAMES
## 
### 
Red Betts' Grays enjoyed a field day
Saturday at the expense of California
Polytechnic Institute and Santa Cruz
High School. They trounced the San
Luis Obispo boys 18-0 in the morning
and the high school team was de
feated 14-6 in the afternoon game.
Both scores should have been much
larger but the Grays had a bad habit
of fumbling at critical moments which
cost them several touchdowns. Satur
day's games were the first of the
season for Betts' team and over
eagerness was largely responsible for
the numerous fumbles. In spite of the
boots, the Grays showed flashes of
real football.
Fumbles Lose Three Touchdowns
In the morning game, the Gray-
Sliirts had the ball inside Poly's ten
yard line three times during the first
three quarters but fumbles kept them
from crossing the line. In the fourth
quarter, however. Fuller. Erliorn, and
Wright carried the ball down the field
on line bucks and end runs three times
and each time a touchdown resulted.
All three tries for extra points were
unsuccessful. The passing, tackling,
and general defense work of Williams
at center was a feature of this game.
Santa Cruz Scores
The Grays started badly in the aft
ernoon game. A fumble by McKenney
at quarter resulted in a touchdown
for Santa Cruz in the first period.
Blacker relieved McKenney in the
second quarter and the Grays went
down the field on straight football
with Woodhead and Blacker carrying
the ball. Woodhead went over and
Blacker added the extra point with a
drop kick.
In the third quarter, Creaver, right
tackle, recovered a fumble and ran
sixty yards to a touchdown. Blacker
again dropped one over for the extra
point. The line plunging and defensive
work of Woodhead, fullback, and
Blacker, quarter, were largely respons
ible for the Gray's victory in the
afternoon game.

Red Betts' Grays enjoyed a field day
Saturday at the expense of California
Polytechnic Institute and Santa Cruz
High School. They trounced the San
Luis Obispo boys 18-0 in the morning
and the high school team was de
feated 14-6 in the afternoon game.
Both scores should have been much
larger but the Grays had a bad habit
of fumbling at critical moments which
cost them several touchdowns. Satur
day's games were the first of the
season for Betts' team and over
eagerness was largely responsible for
the numerous fumbles. In spite of the
boots, the Grays showed flashes of
real football.
Fumbles Lose Three Touchdowns
In the morning game, the Gray-
Sliirts had the ball inside Poly's ten
yard line three times during the first
three quarters but fumbles kept them
from crossing the line. In the fourth
quarter, however. Fuller. Erliorn, and
Wright carried the ball down the field
on line bucks and end runs three times
and each time a touchdown resulted.
All three tries for extra points were
unsuccessful. The passing, tackling,
and general defense work of Williams
at center was a feature of this game.
Santa Cruz Scores
The Grays started badly in the aft
ernoon game. A fumble by McKenney
at quarter resulted in a touchdown
for Santa Cruz in the first period.
Blacker relieved McKenney in the
second quarter and the Grays went
down the field on straight football
with Woodhead and Blacker carrying
the ball. Woodhead went over and
Blacker added the extra point with a
drop kick.
In the third quarter, Creaver, right
tackle, recovered a fumble and ran
sixty yards to a touchdown. Blacker
again dropped one over for the extra
point. The line plunging and defensive
work of Woodhead, fullback, and
Blacker, quarter, were largely respons
ible for the Gray's victory in the
afternoon game.
