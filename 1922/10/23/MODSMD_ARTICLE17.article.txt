# HITCHCOCK ACADEMY WINS SLOW CONTEST FROM THIRD DINKS
## 
### 
Hitchcock Military Academy ran
through "Husky" Hunt's third Dinks
for three touchdowns and a 19 to 0
victory on the old football field Saturday
morning.
Hunt started a team that average 160
pounds, but later sent in substitutes
which made the eleven heavier. The
1926 line played listlessly and the backs
made numerous fumbles.
Garthwaite, Hitchcock fullback, broke
the ice in the first minutes of play by
scoring on a 55-yard run. Tn the second
quarter Pabst, quarterback, galloped
around right end for another Hitchcock
scorc. The Dinks resorted to a kicking
game, which gained them more yardage
than their line plays.
Garthwaite added another scorc at the
end of the third quarter on a 5-yard
line plunge.
