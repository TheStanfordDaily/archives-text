# Varsity Eleven Wins; Grays Take Two Games While Babes Break Even in Double Header
## THREE GOALS FROM PLACEMENT BEAT MADIGAN'S GRIDIRON TEAM 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
Waiting at the Stadium for that 1922 Cardinal varsity to arrive is proving
to be a tedious process.
Stanford rooters were down there again Saturday afternoon with the
figurative floral offerings, all ready to greet the "conquering 'eroes" as they
ran rough-shod over St. Mary's. But Andy Kerr's men missed their connec
tion; Madigan's pupils refused to be run over; and it took three field goals by
Cuddeback to win for Stanford, 9 to 0.
The Cards mislaid their final drive—the thing that scores touchdowns—and
that delayed the arrival for another seven days.
Inside the Saints' 20-yard line their punches didn't have enough steam to
push a feather off a fence post. If the Cards coulcf have gotten over the idea
that St. Mary's goal line was sacred territory, and therefore not to be crossed.

then Stanford would have won by
three or four touchdowns.
Three times in the first twelve min
utes Doughty and Wilcox rushed the
ball down (he field on the double
criss-cross play. On the first occasion,
the Phoenix guards and tackles broke
through and the varsity lost the ball
on downs on the 20-yard line. Black,
the roly-poly quarter, kicked, but
Doughty came right back, this time
to the 10-yard line. The Cardinal linn
failed to charge low, and again (ho
ball went to St. Mary's.
Wilcox ambled along for 25 yards
on the crisscross. Three times the
Stanford forwards failed to take care
of the fast-charging Oaklanders, and
no gain was made. Then Cuddeback
dropped back and put the ball over
the uprights on a placement.
All of which was well and good, but
Madigan's men came back with an at
tack that swept the Cards oh their
No. 11's. Hoopii, Pre 11 i and Strater,
plunging through holes as big as a
box car, carried the ball to Stanford's
16-yard line. Here fate, in the form of
a fumble by Strater, intervened, and
that ended St. Mary's offensive for'
the afternoon.
In the second quarter the teams
pushed each other around in mid-field,
with Wilcox and Black exchanging
punts. Thornhill began replacing his
linesmen, sending in Faville, Ludeke,
Lawson, and Neill. With two minutes
to go, Wilcox dashed through the line
for 20 yards, and then passed 12 more
to Mertz. Two more passes failed, and
Art missed a field goal from the 35-
yard line.
Cuddeback added three more digits
after a pass, Wilcox to Woodward,
brought the teams to St. Mary's 20-
yard line. The Stanford attack slacked
off, so that a field goal was all that
resulted. But the disappointment of
disappointments came in the final
quarter.
