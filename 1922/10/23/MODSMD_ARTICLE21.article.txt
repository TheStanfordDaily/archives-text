# SPECTACLE FOR "HUMANITARIANS"
## 
### 
An organization vvitW soft hearts but with little
foresight seeks to subtract from the sufferings of
animals by proposing the passage of an anti-vivi
section bill. Everybody is agreed that useless
pain caused by experimentation should be stop
ped. Rut as to what the word "use" means, the
authors of the bill seem to have a very faint con
ception . Having arranged to stop vivisection, the
reasoning of the organization in question leaves
the realm of sound business judgment, throws
logic to the several winds ,and proceeds the rest
of the distance on pure unadulterated sentiment.
Having stopped experimentation, it may be
supposed that the anti-cruelty league will nestle
among its laurels in peace until some fellow
member is suddenly stricken by disease requiring
special treatment. Then, of course, the
remainder would rally round the sick man
.and offer themselves for experimental purposes
in the place of stray cats and dogs who at
least are given food and shelter before they are
used by science in the place of humans. Otherwise
they would probably die a lingering death of
starvation and cold on the streets .
Thousands of mice and rats are poisoned 01*
trapped every day. No laws have been seri
ously suggested to stop this fearful orgy of de
moniacal cruelty. But when the death of a rat
through experimentation contributes materially
toward the well-being of humanity, the charge of
cruelty" is brought. Fiendish scientists
with malice aforethought plot diabolical tortures
for dumb brutes merely for the pleasure of hear
ing them squeal. It is a wonder that they don't
use elephants in order to magnify the pleasure.
Anti-vivisectionists either do not understand
the situation—do not know that they are menac
ing public welfare —or else are willing as a body
to sacrifice themselves in the place of animals.
The Daily brings 110 charges of selfishness, but
judging by the ordinary run of people, this anti
cruelty group is not likely to practice what its
logic preaches.
It is apparent that anti-vivisectionists are short
sighted. In lieu of more costly spectacles ,thc
Daily asks those suffering from such eye trouble
to look through the above . It may be helpful in
removing the strain usually placed on eyes in an
attempt to sec something which does not exist in
vivisection—namely, cruelty."
