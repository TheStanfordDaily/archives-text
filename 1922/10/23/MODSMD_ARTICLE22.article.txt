Nevada is forunate in having' such a small rep
resentation of tramps. Stanford people are won
dering how many students are bumming their
way through a thousand pages of examinations;
how many are crashing gates; how many are
swiping books off window ledges; and how many
are sneaking into jolly-ups. If all the local bums
would answer a roll call, it's a ten to one shot
that Stanford's "honor society" would have Nev
ada's cheated a mile.
We're not bragging on this situation, but on
the other hand, it is a gentle hint to Stanford
bums not to organize with any idea of being hon
ored by any other authority than the Men's
Council .
