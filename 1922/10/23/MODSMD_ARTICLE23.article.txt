The question had a r isen in the Rhode Island Legis
lature as to whether a certain legislator's district should
be divided or not. In speaking against the measure the
legislator said (in part):
"Mr. Chairman, that district is already small, too
small. Why, I tell you I could spit clear across it right
now."
"You're out of order!" thundered the chairman.
"Yes, I am," admitted the legislator, sadly. "If I
wasn't I could spit across the whole darn state."

How to Rid the Room of Flies
One o fthe biggest problems of campus life since the
weather bureau made it slatest forecast is the fly prob
lem. Here are some simple directions for ridding the
room of these pests:
First, procure a room. Next, after having paid room
rent, shut all windows and after locking it procure some
fancy fly cure from druggist. Burn, sprinkle, or expose
to air, shut and lock door to room, and move in with a
friend for one week. During this time the flies will
thrive and multiply on fly-cure. After a week or ten
days, the flies will be so full of pep from the fly-cure that
race suicide will commence to kill them off. Move back
in room and at the first fall of snow flies will bother
no more.

California-Olympic Club
The trip to the city . . . the finding that end seats
were all that were left ... the man in front who
tells his neighbor that the scar on,his nose was received
when he made the famous touchdown for I. C. C. in
'99 . . . his wife who very audibly reminds him that
he got that the night he tried to chase the cat under the
dresser ... the d fool who brings a lady to the
game, and then tries to explain the difference between
the Goal Post and the Olympic Club . . . the football
expert who explains the difference between a crisscross
forward pass and an off-side kick . . . the wit who
. . . but you all know, fellows . . . you've seen
California play yourself!

Rough's Corner
Reginald the Rough speaks:
A haughty miss strolled down the Quad,
Her head was in the air, J?
She greeted some with formal nod,
But most with icy stare.
For she was popular as a girl
Can ever get to be. + •
She set the campus all a-whirl,
And reigned quite royally.
But now we see this girl can be
A whole lot different, too.
She treads the walks quite modestly,
With friendly "How-de-do?"
She's dropped cold and foreign way,
And yet she's made no slip,
» Her old-time co-ed stuff won't pay,
In Oslikosh. Mississip'.
L'End-Boys
The Queen who cuts you on the Quad,
With scarcely recognition.
Would have to work her best,/>y heck,
Where there was competition!
Reggie the Rough, '24.

Mike the Stevadore: Seen my boy tonight?
Mike the Cop: Yep. Ran him in for starting a riot.
Mike the Stevadore: That right? He said he was going
out to amuse himself.
