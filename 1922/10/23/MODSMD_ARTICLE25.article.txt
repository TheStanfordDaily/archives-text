To the Editor:
Eor year it has been the custom of
the Stanford Young Men's Christian As
sociation to give the students two oppor
tunities to share in the support of the
work of the Association. One of these
canvasses has been for work in a foreign
country similar to that carried on by
practically every other college in the
land. The other was for work on the
campus.
On account of the Endowment drive
neither of these causes was presented
last year. This fall on account of the
Unprecedented need and cajl of the
native workers in foreign lands, the
Cabinet, on October 10th unanimously
decided to proceed with a "Stanford in
China" canvass to begin October 23rd.
Accordingly the consent of the Social
Service Board was secured, organiza
tions were set up. Speakers engaged,
literature secured, and an article an
nouncing the canvass given the Daily
Palo Alto.
Meanwhile the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students took action
raising the whole question of a better
handling of canvasses on the campus.
Therefore in view of these facts, and
desiring to cooperate sympathetically
with the movement, the Association de
sires to take this opportunity to announce
to its workers and to the public, that
the "Stanford in China" canvass has
been postponed, pending the action oi
the Social Service Board.
