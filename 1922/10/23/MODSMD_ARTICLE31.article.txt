# SWORD AND SANDALS PLAY TO USE NEW THREE LEVEL STAGE
## 
### 
The atmosphere of a thoroughly
modern New York society family will
be reflected in the stage settings, now
benig constructed by the class in
Theatrical Workshop for "Her Hus
band's Wife," presented by Sword and
Sandals on November 3.
A modified form of the three-level
stage, in accord with the most ad
vanced stage design, will be used here
for the first time. This will make pos
sible a more effective grouping of
characters. The three-level type, which
has been used to a considerable extent
in Germany, affords an actor more
complete mastery over a scene than is
possible in the usual stage where the
characters must be placed in the old
formal grouping.
The Randolph living room, free from
unnecessary "claptrap"—such as a
grand piano, never used, but included
in the author's plan—will occupy the
stage level. On the stage to the right
stairs lead to a higher landing from
which doors open into two bedrooms.
A piazza, the third level, from which
French windows give glimpses of a
garden, extends along the back of the
stage. An arched doorway leading 'nto
a corridor, a fireplace, and colorful
droperies will equip the left wall.
