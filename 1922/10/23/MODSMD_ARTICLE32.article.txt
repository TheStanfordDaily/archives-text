# Beakers of Anthrax Germs Refused by Hadwen After Attacking Germ Theory
## 
### 
Although he declared the germ
theory to be a complete fallacy, Dr.
W. R. Hadwen, eminent English anti
vivisectionist, ignored an invitation
during a debate in the Berkeley High
School Tuesday night to swallow half
the contents of a vial of anthrax germs
laid on the speaker's table by Clifford
Bishop, student of the University of
California.
Bishop announced that he would
take one-half of the anthrax toxin if
Dr. Hadwen would take the other half.
Bishop added that he would promptly
save himself by swallowing an anti
toxin, inferring a dire result for Dr.
Hadwen if he refused to follow suic.
Dr. Hadwen refused the proposition
and instead made the statement that
"education is the curse of civilization.'
Dr. Hadwen spoke at Palo Alto a
week ago and was accused of "quack
ery" by Stanford professors.
