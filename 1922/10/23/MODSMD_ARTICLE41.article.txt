### 
Music Club has chosen the following
four new members from among those
who have tried out: Geraldine Watt,
vocalist; Eugene Poncelet, pianist;
Luella Rackliff, pianist; Malcolm Dav
idson, cellist.
Second tryouts will be held soon at
a date to be announced later for those
who have missed the first.
The Club meets twice a month, and
has decided to present a program at
every other meeting. One member,
possibly assisted by others, will give
selections representing a special period
of music or will play compositions of
a certain composer. Other meetings
will be for the discussion of business.
