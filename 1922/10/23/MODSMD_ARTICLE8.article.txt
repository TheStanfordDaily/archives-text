Have you the seed of genius? If you
don't know, find the answer in the com
ing issue of the Pictorial. A. R. Boone,
'23, has written an article in this topic
from an interview with Professor Ter
man. Terman very recently published
a long essay about this matter in the
World's Work. This article attempts to
bring out the important points in a short
er form.
If present plans go through there will
be much more space used for pictures
than formerly. Football will hold the
center of the stage. There will also be
some action pictures of the poster fight
and tie up. An idea of the progress
made in constructing the Encina Dining
Hall can be obtained by comparison with
some snapshots taken only a few days ago.
In addition, the Pictorial is developing a
department of cartoons. In this number
there will be two pages of drawings by
J. D. McDonald, '25. This year's first
addition to the Hall of Fame will also
appear with the photographs of new
Student Body Officers.
