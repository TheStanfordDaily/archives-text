# Encina's Ruffs Dislike Tea Hounds Who Serve Pretzels And Near Beer
## 
### 
Encina lias been disgraced. Tea par
tits. sez the loyal ruff, are all riglit in
their place but Encina is no place for
them. Many feel that the good name of
the hall has been dragged on the ground,
or the tea grounds, by an affair given
y'know.
Five members of the hall gave a tea
party for lady friends which resulted
in a great uproar on the fifth floor.
Instead of tea, beer (near), pretzels,
and—the strongest feature of the occa
sion—limburger cheese, were served.
In fact, it had the aspccts of a German
tea and resembled little the famous Eng
lish rite.
An unvited reception committee of
about 100 gave the guests a warm wel
come on their departure.
