# TRYOUTS FOR RAMâ€™S HEAD FOOTBALL SHOW TO BEGIN TOMORROW
## 
### 
1 ryouts for "The Football Frothies
of '22." this year's Ram's Head revue
to be presented on Big Game night, will
be held tomorrow and Thursday from 3
to 6 and 7 to 10 p.m. in the Assembly
Hall. The cast is especially large, there
being twenty-eight speaking parts, five
specialty acts, and tliree choruses. As
many students as possible are urged to
tryout, but Ram's Head makes a special
plea for new talent.
As in last year's show, the production
will have no complicated settings. There
will be eight major and seven minor
scenes, alterating before and behind the
curtain. The revue will be in two acts,
and the stage sets as drawn by Clyde
Coaklcy, '22, promise to be the most
pretentious yet seen on the campus.
