# Pre- Volstead Days To Be Pictured in Coming Play
## 
### 
Pre-Volstead days and the effect of
drink are pictured in the plot of "Her
Husband's Wife" which will be un
folded in the Assembly Hall on No
vember 3.
Stuart Randolph, played by Arthur
Conover, '22, singing "My bonnie lies
over the ocean" in a voice which is
not steady, hasn't "been drunk'n
years." As a happy husband, he comes
gayly home; his brother-in-law calls
him a scoundrel and assaults him; his
wife bursts into tears and locks the
door on him; and his wife's uncle and
friend decline to give any information.
On top of all this, he is accused of
beating fcir, wife with a stick, throwing
a cup of hot coffee at her, and poison
ing poor little Choco, a pet pup.
"I thought it wasn't anything so
awful to have a few sociable ones with
the boys, and nil this time I was com-

I ing home to you—to my dear little
wife —and doing these unspeakable
things. Poor little girl! What a brute
I was! And yet you know that it
wouldn't have happened if it hadn't
been —for the drink. You may get a
divorce."
But Irene Randolph, played by Ger
trude McLeod. '25, refuses to be di
vorced, and rushing into her room,
slams the door and locks it. Where
upon the unfortunate husband tries
to drown his woes in a flask of whis
key—just as men have done before
him. The effect is marvelous!
Some think him sick while others
know that there is only one answer.
Irene thinks that she knows, so her
next act is a sensible one. What be
comes of Stuart and Irene—that's all
worked out in the last few minutes of
[ the play.
