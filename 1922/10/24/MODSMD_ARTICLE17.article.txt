# Coach Kerr Revives Inter-Class Football
## Cardinal Mentor and Dr. W. Barrow Organize Undergraduates To Decide Championship 
### 
"We are going to get down to business, but we are going to get a lot of fun
out of it —all of us," said Coach Andy Kerr in an address to the Stanford
frosh recently. Kerr is making good his word and has conferred with Dr.
W. H. Barrow, director of inter-collegiate athletics, with the result that
tomorrow afternoon the first call will be sounded for inter-class football
candidates.
Following general meetings of the four undergraduate classes, the candi
dates will turn in their names and then trek to the football training fields
for a week of preliminary instruction in the fundamentals of the game. At
the end of the week, moleskins and other necessary equipment will be given

out, and actual intensive training will
begin under the personal direction of
a member of each class chosen as
coach because of superior football
knowledge, and with the aid oi Coach
Kerr and a number of injured varsity
players.
The schedule calls for games 011
November 11 and 18. On the morning
of November 1. the Seniors and Jun
iors will clash, the Sophomore and
Freshman elevens meeting at the same
hour on another gridiron. One week
later the winners and losers will face
each others. Members of the winning
team will be awarded small block num
erals.
Four ten-minute quarters will be
played, it was announced.
Coach Andy Kerr and Dr. Barrow
are starting something new, insofar as
the present generation of students is
concerned. Inter-class football was
played here before Stanford took up
Rugby, but then the sport died out and
has not been revived until this year.
Duffy Seay anil Director of Intramural
Athletics Charles W. Davis are to be
personally in charge of the work, with
Coach Kerr planning to give as much
time as he can afford to the proper
coaching of the class elevens.
The purpose of inter-class football
is to give those students who have not
been able to try out for the varsity, or
who have never played before, an op
portunity to participate in America's
greatest college sport. Many men have
never gone out for varsity football
simply because they have not had con
fidence in themselves. The majority
believe that they are too light and
"could never handle a pigskin any
way." And experience has shown that
these men do not hesitate to go out
for class teams, and quite often dis
cover that they are stars worthy of
varsity competition.
Kerr plans to keep his eye on the
class teams not only to see the boys
"have some fun," but also in the hopes
of discovering possible stars.
It is planned in a year or two to
draw up schedules between Stanford
class teams and the class elevens of

junior colleges and other small schools
near the campus.
Those who wish to change over to
football from their present sport will
receive credit.

concerned. Inter-class football was
played here before Stanford took up
Rugby, but then the sport died out and
has not been revived until this year.
Duffy Seay anil Director of Intramural
Athletics Charles W. Davis are to be
personally in charge of the work, with
Coach Kerr planning to give as much
time as he can afford to the proper
coaching of the class elevens.
The purpose of inter-class football
is to give those students who have not
been able to try out for the varsity, or
who have never played before, an op
portunity to participate in America's
greatest college sport. Many men have
never gone out for varsity football
simply because they have not had con
fidence in themselves. The majority
believe that they are too light and
"could never handle a pigskin any
way." And experience has shown that
these men do not hesitate to go out
for class teams, and quite often dis
cover that they are stars worthy of
varsity competition.
Kerr plans to keep his eye on the
class teams not only to see the boys
"have some fun," but also in the hopes
of discovering possible stars.
It is planned in a year or two to
draw up schedules between Stanford
class teams and the class elevens of

junior colleges and other small schools
near the campus.
Those who wish to change over to
football from their present sport will
receive credit.
"We are going to get down to business, but we are going to get a lot of fun
out of it —all of us," said Coach Andy Kerr in an address to the Stanford
frosh recently. Kerr is making good his word and has conferred with Dr.
W. H. Barrow, director of inter-collegiate athletics, with the result that
tomorrow afternoon the first call will be sounded for inter-class football
candidates.
Following general meetings of the four undergraduate classes, the candi
dates will turn in their names and then trek to the football training fields
for a week of preliminary instruction in the fundamentals of the game. At
the end of the week, moleskins and other necessary equipment will be given

out, and actual intensive training will
begin under the personal direction of
a member of each class chosen as
coach because of superior football
knowledge, and with the aid oi Coach
Kerr and a number of injured varsity
players.
The schedule calls for games 011
November 11 and 18. On the morning
of November 1. the Seniors and Jun
iors will clash, the Sophomore and
Freshman elevens meeting at the same
hour on another gridiron. One week
later the winners and losers will face
each others. Members of the winning
team will be awarded small block num
erals.
Four ten-minute quarters will be
played, it was announced.

the present generation of students is
concerned. Inter-class football was
