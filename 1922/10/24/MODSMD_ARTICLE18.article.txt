The reader is a graduate of the
Royal Conservatory of Brussels, where
as a student she was awarded the first
prize in an elocution contest conducted
for determining the best elocutionist
in the institution. This honor would

Miss Werleman could no doubt have
entered a successful stage career, but
she chose the teaching profession in
preference, and has since her gradua
tion from the Conservatory been
teaching French in Holland.
The program this evening will in
clude a number of dramatic mono
logues and two selections from Moliere
in the original. It will be a sample of
the type of program which is now the
vogue at the Commedie Francaise at
the Saturday matinees, known to the
French people as the Matinees Poet
icjues, and will serve as an example
of what in France is considered the
art of the public speaker.

shows of the year went 011 sale yes
terday at the Boowstore and Cran
dall's. The sale opened with a rush,

have orchestra seats in the best part
of the Assembly Hall guaranteed at
every Campus play. The drawings for
the individual productions will be
