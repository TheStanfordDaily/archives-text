# GETTING A FOOTBALL EDUCATION
## 
### 
In returning- inter-class football to the campus,
the Men's Physical Education Department has
made a step decidedly to the advantage of Stan
ford men—not only to Stanford's athletic teams,
but to the undergraduate body of men as a whole.
A few of the advantages might be enumerated
here.
In the first place, men who have never played
will have a chance. They will be able to take an
active part in a sport they have heretofore merely
watched. They will have an opportunity to learn
the game and will thereafter know what it is to
be an intelligent spectator.
Inter-class competition is a part of a far-reach
ing scheme by which participants in every grada
tion of major sports are brought under the super
vision of the head coach. Every man is personally
concerned with the building of future teams and
with the development of all students as a whole.
It is a chance for the man who is physically un
able to make the first team and at the same time
it will bring to light potential varsity material.
No regular varsity, freshman, or goof candidate
will be allowed to take part in the inter-class
games. The regulars have schedules of their own.
By making this provision the athlctic authorities
have guaranteed a fair chance to every interested
student.
There is a possibility for the future of inter
class football at Stanford aside from the advan
tages just enumerated, in that a regular schedule
may be planned for next year and the years fol
lowing. There are enough junior colleges and
small schools near the campus to make a good
schedule not only a possibility but a likelihood.
It will all depend 011 the interest taken. Stanford
men are being taken at their word—that they
would make good in athletics if they were given
a chance in their own field of capabilities. The
field and the chance are now being provided.
The winners of the class title will be granted
the privilege of wearing numerals, which in itself
should be a sufficient inducement to the ordinary
second-rater in athletics, in which class most
college men fall.
Equipment will be provided after the first few
practices for those who show signs of being in
earnest . Credit will be given to those who trans
fer from other sports . These are about all the ad
vantages apparent on the surface at first thought.
If there are any disadvantages, we have yet to
hear of them. The Daily is more than glad to
welcome inter-class competition back to the
campus again.

men are being taken at their word—that they
would make good in athletics if they were given
a chance in their own field of capabilities. The
field and the chance are now being provided.
The winners of the class title will be granted
the privilege of wearing numerals, which in itself
should be a sufficient inducement to the ordinary
second-rater in athletics, in which class most
college men fall.
Equipment will be provided after the first few
practices for those who show signs of being in
earnest . Credit will be given to those who trans
fer from other sports . These are about all the ad
vantages apparent on the surface at first thought.
If there are any disadvantages, we have yet to
hear of them. The Daily is more than glad to
welcome inter-class competition back to the
campus again.
