# CAMPUS SHOW PRICES
## 
### 
Like manna from Heaven comes the announce
ment that admission prices to campus shows, like
the over-discussed skirts, are coming down. The
Stanford Dramatic Council has decided to issue
a season ticket for four dollars, good for admis
sion to five shows . Single tickcts will he priced
at one doller or seventy-five cents, depending on
the seat. The Ram's Head Show and the Junior
Opera are not included in the season ticket sale,
chiefly because alumni and residents of neighbor
ing towns are not so much interested in these
productions as undergraduates and would conse
quently prefer season tickcts only to the five
dramatic offerings.
Considerable criticism has been directed in the

past toward dramatic organizations beacuse of
high admission charges . There has been good
cause for complaint, but season tickets that in
clude five shows at eighty cents each ought to do
away with accumulated ire . The high standard
of campus dramatics may be maintained at these
rates and at the same time everybody is given a
fair chance to attend. If a movie in Palo Alto
is worth thirty cents, local offernigs ought cer
tainly to be worth eighty and then some.
The campaign for the sale of season tickets
has been worked out and is now being started.
Students will be saved from what in the past they
have been pleased to call extortion if they at
once take advantage of the opportunity offered
by the Dramatic Council. Prices are coming
down! Who could ask more?
