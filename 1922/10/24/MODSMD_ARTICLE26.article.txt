The Man
Ah, there's the girl I'd like to steal,
Take her for life, in woe and weal,
Her ruby lips and black-lashed eyes,
Have bound me fast in Cupid's ties.
The Girl
I've never seen a nobler man,
Through all my lifetime's lengthy spau,
His face, clothes, figure, all reveal,
A character as true as steel.
The Crowd
Well, can you feature some poor goofs. The dame
with the rouged lips and made-over eyes has K. O.'d the
poor boob with the snub nose in the baggy suit! Ain't
love an awful thing?
* * *
Book Review: The G oGet Her, by Peter B. Cow.
Story of an ex-soldier who was impressed while in the
army with the motto of "Do it now." Returned to
Kentucky, saw the girl of his dreams, and did his tricks.
After wedding finds she is a graduate of famous western
university and her motto is, "Don't let 'em get away."
Story starts in California poppy fields, touches Flanders
Fields, and ends in Marshall Fields.

We are asked to announce that in the future the
Junior Prom will not be held in the Library.

B. V. D.: Why the black eye? Thought you decided to
cut out the fighting by always counting ten before
striking.
E. Z. C.: I did, but the guy I was arguing with only
counted to five.

"Where is Milpitas?"
"Sorry, but I'm not up on the Turkish situation."

"I hear that Andy Smith is some coach," remarked
the campus sage as he fought madly through the noon
rush to find his postoffice box empty. "Wasn't he the
one who had his full-back injured and sent in two half
backs to take his place?"
* * *
Have you ever gone to a football and arrived at the
exciting part, and just as the touchdown was being made
have the girl behind you tap your shoulder and ask what
position the coach was playing?
