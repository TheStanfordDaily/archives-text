ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
To the Editor:
It is to be hoped that the Executive
Committee stands pat on its discourage
ment of campus drives. It nipped the
Y.M.C.A. campaign in the hud, and if
the ruling holds, it will nut only save
us money but will spare us from col
umns and columns of blurb.
In the first place the Y.M.C.A. drive
should be squelched because it is a drive,
and the war is over.
Secondly, there is no good reason that
I have ever seen advanced for the
Y.M.C.A. to levy tribute from the gen
eral public. I am not opposed to the
organization. I think it is a good thing
for those who like it. Rut it does not
do any good for non-members, and they
shouldn't be asked to give financial help.
Did you ever stay at the Y.M.C.A. in a
strange city? Several times, seeking
the much advertised good-fellowship
there,, I have done just that. 1 didn't
find it, and I finally quit trying. The
Y. M. C. A. is a closed corporation as
for as benefits to mankind are con
cerned.
During the war the Y.M.C.A. had an
opportunity to serve those outside its
membership, and everyone knows what
a sickening mess it made of the chance.
It is back on the old basis again and
once more asks the public to help sup
port it. The argument in this particular
case, doubtless, is that the Y.M.C.A. fills
a need in China. One can easily grant
that, but the admission would logically
permit the Baptist Church and the Cath
olic Church to carry on public drives
for the China missions, since they are
doing wonderful work in that field, too.
Here's hoping the Executive Com
mittee doesn't weaken.
