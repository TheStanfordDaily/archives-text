The one bright spot in the St. Mary's
game Saturday was more than 93,-
000,000 miles away. It seemed a lot
closer than that, however, and there
was more than one shirt-sleeve brigade
in the bleachers.
How the public loves its win
ner! Forgotten is the Golden Bear
that the writers took such delight
in labeling as tarnished following
that scoreless tie with Washington
and Jefferson. Now the champion
is hailed as if there had never
been a derogatory word said, and
no praise is too lavish for the
Bruins. The champion can do no
wrong. The truth of the matter
probably is that California took
about as much undeserved criti
cism last winter as it is now ac
cepting unearned praise.
Good old psychology re-appears with
reference to the Card varsity. Kerr's
men are off to a slow start. There is
no doubt about that, hut one reason is
that the first game with the Olympics
set them back more than three easy
preliminary c-ontests. That uefeat took
away their confidence. Moreover, Stan
ford hasn't run up any large scores
because it hasn't yet got any team on
the run. After the first couple of
touchdowns, the rest should be easy.
Jim Lawson hobbled down the
field under punts on his prop and
a half in a way that put some of
the other end candidates to shame.
He was on top of the Phoenix
safety man every time. Mertz at
the other end of the fence did his
bit both on the offensive and de
fensive.
Rae Doughty accounted for nearly
half of the total Stanford yardage Sat
urday. The pride of Austin, Texas, has
been lugging the ball fast and far in
the past two games.
