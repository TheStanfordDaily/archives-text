# ROOTERS SEND OFF CARDINAL VARSITY AT BLEACHER RALLY
## Twenty-Seven Men Will Start North Tomorrow Night for Game With Oregon Aggies 
### 
Secret stuff—the tiling that keeps the
football bugs wondering what the
coaches are up to uow—was on the
boards for Andy Kerr's varsity yester
day.
This afternoon the order of tilings
was exactly reversed. Kerr trotted his
men out to the Stadium where anybody
could see 'em that wanted to. He had
them kick, pass, run signals for a while,
and then for good measure lined them
up against "Red" Betts' grays.
While the Cardinal fans and fanettes
on the bleachers cheered the varsity to
a noisy send-off for the O. A. C. game.
Kerr's men shoved the grays all over the
turf in a final scrimmage.
Kerr will take more than two full
teams north lor that first Conference
battle next Saturday. If it rains then,
as it usually has a habit of doing in
Oregon, he will need them. Cardinal
elevens in the past have been no web
iooters, and the combination of water
and sawdust is apt to go hard with
Kerr's dry-land gridders.
Besides Kerr, Trainer Denny, and
Football Manager J. Howell Smythe,
twenty-seven men will leave Oakland
mole at S o'clock tomorrow night bound
for Corvallis, by way of Auburn. They
will arrive at "Red" Rutherford's pri
vate domain in time to have a work-out
Friday afternoon, and to rest up for the
game the next day. Immediately after
the contest is over, the Cardinal dele
gation will hop aboard the rattler for
home, getting in San Francisco Sunday
evening.
