# STANFORD GRIDIRON VARSITY LEA VES FOR CORV ALLIS TONIGHT
## Cardinal Squad in Good Shape For First Real Test Against Oregon Aggie Eleven on Saturday 
### 
Twenty-seven Cardinal football war
riors, none of them hampered by serious
injuries, leave Palo Alto at 6 o'clock to
night bound for Corvallis, Oregon, where
they will bump up against the Oregon
Aggies next Saturday.
The Cardinal brigade, in charge of
Coach Kerr, Trainer Denny, and Foot
ball Manager Smythe, is due to start
from Oakland shortly after 8 o'clock
and will land in Corvallis Friday morn
ing.
The men who leave tonight follow:
Mertz, Lawson, Dole, Thomas, Hart
ranft, ends; Shipkey, Johnston, Neill,
Loomis, tackles; Ludeke, Cravens, Fa
ville, Pheney, Houck, Douglass, guards;
Captain DeGroot, Baker, centers; Wood
ward. Campbell, Wheat, quarterbacks:

Wilcox, Doughty, Cleaveland, Murray,
Kraft, halfbacks; Cuddeback, Taylor,
fullbacks.
Bob Janssen, who injured his ankle
several weeks ago, has been reporting
for practice, but will not make the north
ern trip, Joe Douglas, who lias been
tried in the backfield, will probably
play in the line Saturday. His line
plunging won him a place as fullback
on the 1923 freshman eleven, but last
year Van Gent shifted him to guard,
where he played most of the season.
Kerr needs backfield material badly
enough, but Douglass' weight and ex
perience will come in handy 011 the line.
"Bud" Woodward has his left hand
heavily bandaged, but Denny says that
the quarterback will be in condition to
start against Rutherford's gang.
Stanford has a fifty-fifty chance of
winning its first important game, thinks
Coach Kerr. Cuddeback's placement
kicking is almost certain to play an im
portant part in the battle.
Gridiron history seems to be repeating
itself so far. For two years a sup
posedly weak Cardinal varsity has met
an Oregi 11 eleven. Each time the north
erners have*been sent home sadder but
wiser. In 1920 it was Oregon. The
Lemon-Yellow came to the campus with
the exploits of Bill Steers still fresh in
their minds. "Dink" TemplCton, Pat
rick. Righter. and a few others combined
to throw the skids under the norther
ners, 10 to 7 -
In 1921 Rutherford's "Fighting Ag
gies" came to the campus sure of victory.
In a hair-raising battle on the old foot
ball field, the Cardinal turned back
the plunges of "Gap" Powell, and then
won, 14 to 7, after Patrick had inter
cepted a forward pass and raced to a
touchdown.
Thus far, Stanford is running true to
form. They have shown nothing so
far that would lead anyone to the be
lief that they will beat the Aggies.
But away from home, under the stress
of the first important game, Keer's
men arc liable to arrive with a rush, and
keep up the tradition that the weaker
Stanford team can win from the sup
posedly stronger Oregon eleven. They
will if they have any respect for history.

Wilcox, Doughty, Cleaveland, Murray,

fullbacks.
Bob Janssen, who injured his ankle
several weeks ago, has been reporting
for practice, but will not make the north
ern trip, Joe Douglas, who lias been
tried in the backfield, will probably
play in the line Saturday. His line
plunging won him a place as fullback
on the 1923 freshman eleven, but last
year Van Gent shifted him to guard,
where he played most of the season.
Kerr needs backfield material badly
enough, but Douglass' weight and ex
perience will come in handy 011 the line.
"Bud" Woodward has his left hand
heavily bandaged, but Denny says that
the quarterback will be in condition to
start against Rutherford's gang.
Stanford has a fifty-fifty chance of
winning its first important game, thinks
Coach Kerr. Cuddeback's placement
kicking is almost certain to play an im
portant part in the battle.
Gridiron history seems to be repeating
itself so far. For two years a sup
posedly weak Cardinal varsity has met
an Oregi 11 eleven. Each time the north
erners have*been sent home sadder but
wiser. In 1920 it was Oregon. The
Lemon-Yellow came to the campus with
the exploits of Bill Steers still fresh in
their minds. "Dink" TemplCton, Pat
rick. Righter. and a few others combined
to throw the skids under the norther
ners, 10 to 7 -
In 1921 Rutherford's "Fighting Ag
gies" came to the campus sure of victory.
In a hair-raising battle on the old foot
ball field, the Cardinal turned back
the plunges of "Gap" Powell, and then
won, 14 to 7, after Patrick had inter
cepted a forward pass and raced to a
touchdown.
Thus far, Stanford is running true to
form. They have shown nothing so
far that would lead anyone to the be
lief that they will beat the Aggies.
But away from home, under the stress
of the first important game, Keer's
men arc liable to arrive with a rush, and
keep up the tradition that the weaker
Stanford team can win from the sup
posedly stronger Oregon eleven. They
will if they have any respect for history.
Twenty-seven Cardinal football war
riors, none of them hampered by serious
injuries, leave Palo Alto at 6 o'clock to
night bound for Corvallis, Oregon, where
they will bump up against the Oregon
Aggies next Saturday.
The Cardinal brigade, in charge of
Coach Kerr, Trainer Denny, and Foot
ball Manager Smythe, is due to start
from Oakland shortly after 8 o'clock
and will land in Corvallis Friday morn
ing.
The men who leave tonight follow:
Mertz, Lawson, Dole, Thomas, Hart
