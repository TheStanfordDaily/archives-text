# ELOCUTIONIST FROM BELGIUM PRESENTS INFORMAL PROGRAM
## Miss Claire Werleman Reads Selections From Three French Writers 
### 
A program of readings from three of
the most noted French literary figures
was given last evening in the Little
Theater under the auspices of the French
Club and the Committee on Public Ex
ercises. Miss Claire Werleman, Belgian
elocutionist, who presented the i#ogram,
read from two of the plays of Moliere,
gave sever* of the Fables of Fontaine
and a number of selections from the
works of Victor Hugo.
In her choice of selections from
Moliere, the reader took one from the
comedy "Les Femmes Saventes" which
was especially appreciated for its fund
of humor. Her choice of a monologue
from Victor Hugo. "Oh. Monsieur!"
was another selection which the audience
received with enthusiasm. It was a
splendid example of tone variation as
a means of expressing feeling.
Miss Werleman is a graduate of the
Royal Conservatory of Brussels where
she made a study of elocution. Her
work last evening gave evidence of her
ability at character delineation, and even
to one unfamiliar with the French
language the sense of her selections was
made char by the way in which she
interpreted the action of the characters
and by the tone in which she represented
their emotions.
At the conclusion of the program an
informal reception for Miss Werleman
was held by the French Club at the
Women's Club House.
