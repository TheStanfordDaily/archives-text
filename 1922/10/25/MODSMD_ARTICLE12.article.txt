# Stanford and Barbarian Soccer League Teams Tie
## 
### 
Stanford and the Barbarians became
tied for the championship of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League, when
the Barb eleven defeated the Olympic
Club, 5-0, last Saturday.
Last year the Olympics had a strong
team, and because of their recent vic
tory over the University of California,
they were considered one of the besf
teams in the league. Their defeaA of
last Saturday shows Coach Harry Mal
oney, of the Stanford team, that his hard
game, in the first half of the season,
will be with the Barbarians.
The Cardinal followers of the English
sport will settle the tie with the Barbs
next Saturday when the teams meet
on the local soccer field. The loss of a
single game will not cause a team to
lose the championship as the season is
not yet half over, but it puts a team
under a serious disadvantage.
In the same round of play, the Palo
Alto American Legion defeated the Sons
of St. George, 3-0, and California won
its first game with the Italia Virtus
Club, 4-0.
The standing in the soccer league is
as follows:
