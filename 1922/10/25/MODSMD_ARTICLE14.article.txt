## 
### 
The debate between Stanford and Cali
fornia on November 6 will be held in the
Scottish Rite Auditorium in San Fran
cisco. It was originally announced to
take place in one of the smaller assembly
halls of the Civic Auditorium but it was
changed in order to have a larger hall.
The Scottish Rite Auditorium seats
approximately three thousand people.
November 6 is the day before the
people of California vote on the amend
ment to the state constitution relating
to the state control of water and power.
Coach J. G. Emcrsnn believes that a
large number of people will be present
to hear both sides of the question dis
cussed before they cast their votes.
