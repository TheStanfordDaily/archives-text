# COACH BETTS' GRAYS OPPOSE HUNT'S TEAM IN PRACTICE SESSION
## 
### 
Coach Betts is grooming his grays
for Saturday's contest with the Mar
ines. Last night he treated the gray
shifted lads to a scrimmage with
"Husky" Hunt's first string eleven and
the babes found anything but easy
pickings.
The grays were able to make their
yard through the freshman line on
several occasions, and their passing
game was greatly improved over that
of last Saturday. They seem to have
acquired the knack of holding on to
the ball as fumbles were less frequent
last night than in the games Saturday.
On the defence, Betts' team showed
great improvement, piling the fresh
man line up and throwing the backs
for losses several times.
Bill Black is out with a pulled
muscle in his side and Betts' had
Long working at end last night. Wood
head started at full and showed to
good advantage. Hamilton, at right
half, caused the freshmen no end of
trouble, running forty yards to a touch
down on an off-tackle buck.
The Grays had another light scrim
mage with the Babes this afternoon.
