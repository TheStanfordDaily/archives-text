# HUNT PREPARES FOR LAST THREE GAMES ON BABES' SCHEDULE
## Freshmen Play Fresno Bunch, U.S.C. Yearlings, Before Final With Cubs 
### 
Having delivered his opinion—and it
was a none too flattering one—of his
team's performance last week, Coach
"Husky" Hunt started his final three
weeks training program yesterday.
r \ he Dinks play U. C. Central Branch
(Fresno State Teachers' College) Sat
urday, travel South to meet the U.S.C.
frosh next week, and wind up their
season the following Saturday at Ber
keley in the "little big game."
Nightly practice has settled into grim
earnest. Yesterday Coach Hunt sent his
men against the Goofs for an hour and
a quarter, shooting all thirty of his first
squad into scrimmage.
The Goofs, down to a fine edge of
training for their wind-up against the
Marines this week-end, mauled Hunt's
eleven considerably, scoring one touch
down through the line-bucks of "Ham"
Hamilton, grayshirt half.
Long passes were the rule for the
Dinks. This will probably be Hunt's
plan of attack against the Fresno eleven,
which is reputed to be a beefy bunch.
Aside from the report of their de
feating Loyola college in Southern Cali
fornia by two points last Saturday, and
holding Modesto high school to a 6-6
tie the week previous, nothing of the
Pedagogues' play is known in these
regions.
Hunt's reserve backfield was again in
shape, and will be ready to alternate
with the starters Saturday. The heavy
combination, which usually lines up on
the kickoff, is Nevers, full; Faust and
Solomon, halves, and Mitchell, quarter.
The lightweights, who can be counted
on for long end runs when they are
needed, are Cook and Clayes, halves, and
Kirwan at quarter, with Solomon shifted
to full.
