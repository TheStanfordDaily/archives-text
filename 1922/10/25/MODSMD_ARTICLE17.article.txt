# University Plans Auto Service Station on Farm
## 
### 
A conclusive answer to the anti
automobile agitators is embodied in
the service station which is to bo
installed at the Corporation Yard. The
new aid to convenience is to be oper
ated by the University, for the benefit
of students and the fleet of cars in the
service of the University.
Five of the sheds next to the fire
station will be moved into the Yard,
and the filling station will be erected
in this space, with a driveway leading
into Santa Teresa street. Gasoline and
oils will be sold to the public at mar
ket prices, but no tires or accessories
of any kind will be handled.
This feature will save drivers of
student-owned cars many trips into
Palo Alto for fuel, and will also enable
the University to keep a closer check
on* the gasoline burned in its own
trucks.
