# SWORD AND SANDALS STAGE SET WILL BE BIZARRE, FUTURISTIC
## 
### 
"Bizarre and futuristic" best de
scribes the stage set which is being
prepared by the students in Theatrical
Workshop for "Her Husband's Wife"
to be presented on November 3 in the
Assembly Hall. The general color of
the set is a sandstone tan trimmed in
light lavender, with peculiar vines and
birds forming the wall decorations.
Drapes of a design which, it is claimed,
once seen will never be forgotten, ac
centuate the general futuristic tone
of the entire stage set.
Lighting effects will play an import
ant part in the production, according
to Clyde Coakley, '22. R. C. Bentinck,
dramatic coach, is now working on a
number of new effects which it is in
tended will conform with the atmos
phere of the plot, changing when ne
cessary with the progress of the play.
Bentinck is a professional along this
line, having assisted Belasco with pro
ductions in New York for three years
and having directed productions at
Carmel. The full color of a sunset
through a garden at the rear of the
stage will be one of the mosi beautiful
lighting effects of the play.
Indirect reflected light will be ap
plied by a method adapted from, that
used in connection with plaster domes
or kupple-horizont. This consists in
placing miniature reflecting
one thousand candlepower electric
lights at certain vantage points in
visible to the audience. This system
lias been tried out on a small scale by
the director elsewhere and under cer
tain conditions proven to be entirely
adequate.
The characters will be particularly
effective against the directly lighted
glass veranda which serves as a back
ground.
