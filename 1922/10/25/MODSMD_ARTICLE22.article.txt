# OSTEOPATHY AND CHIROPRACTIC THE SAME OLD STORY
## 
### 
This is an editorial written by a member of the
faculty of the Medical School—an exposition or an
expose, as the reader chooses to view it, of two
phases of the proposed medical legislation. This
is a matter of vital importance to Stanford men
who as a body are an essential part of the education
al system. This editorial has ideas in it. Perhaps
those who read it may pass them on to others who
are now in doubt.—The Editor.
"What is the matter" and what to do about it
are questions that confront everyone in any illness.
Hence all those licensed to minister to disease should
pass exactly the saifie minimum tests. The Supreme
Court of the United States has declared so in every
case appealed to it. The Constitution of the United
States guarantees to every citizen the same rights.
Hence it was held unconstitutional as well as unjust
to establish different standards for the practice of
medicine in the same state.
All persons licensed to minister to disease are
practicing medicine. There are no systems of heal
ing or of medicine. It is a question of science or
quackery. There is no other- ground. Modern
medicine is based on a careful study of the structure
and functions of the human body in health and
disease. Medical sects or cults are based on dogma.
They hold forth a panacea, a universal remedy.
Moreover, all diseases are said to have the same
causes as well as yield to the same remedy. Chiro
practors, for example, declare that ninety-five per
cent of all diseases are due to slightly dislocated
vertebrae. Yes, they even claim that ninety-five
per cent of all cases of insanity are due to slight
changes in position of the first and second vertebrae!
Osteopaths claim to find the causes of disease not
only in minor displacements of the bones of the
spine, but of all the bones of the body and of the
muscles, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels and even
of individual cells themselves! They pretend to be
able to replace all these, even single cells, by manip
ulation of the outside of the human body. They
might as well try to influence the course of Jupiter
by a sneeze.
The history of all medical cults has been to incor
porate more and more of scientific medicine as the
years go by. Osteopaths, for example, now receive
a rudimentary medical education. Nevertheless,
the best of osteopathic schools still rank for below
the lowest of the scientific schools. Two decades
ago the osteopath stood exactly where the chiro
practic stands today. Besides, cults are, of neces
sity unscientific for they teach and believe in
medical dogma regardless of the facts.
Cults possess no secrets. Who would hold that
the grocery clerk knows something about mathe
matics that the foremost mathematician does not
know? They thrive merely upon human credulity
and hope, and take advantage of the wholly ex
cusable ignorance of the public regarding the struc
ture and functions of the body and of the processes
of disease. Nor must it be forgotten that there is
much that the best of us do not know. But that is
no reason why anyone should look to ignorance as
a guide.
