# STAFF MEETING
## 
### 
There will be a meeting' of the staff of the Daily
Palo Alto Friday afternoon at 1 :30 in the Press
Building. The editorial board needs no better ex
cuse than the absence of a few of its members to
cut the staff down to an efficient working organ
ization. This is no plea for attendance. The mem
bers who get red behind the ears may draw their
own conclusions.
