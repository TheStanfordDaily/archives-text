# CABBAGES and THINGS

1 H. M. '2-4
Phil Newill
Cabbages wishes to take this opportunity of expressing
gratification for the crowd that turned out at the rally
last night. Just think of it, every loyal Stanford student
—all 300 of 'em —went way down there to express his
faith in the team In yells that could be heard clear
across the stadium.
* • •
Who says the Stanford spirit is not what it used to be?
Wasn't every live Stanford man and woman in the
University making a deafening amount of noise? And
didn't they snap out the yells with a different brand of
the good old fight than they ever had before? And
won't the same loyal, patriotic, fighting, hard-boiled,
square-shooting, undiscouraged, red-blooded gang that
filled their seats in the stadium be down at the station
tonight, and won't they give the varsity the same rip
roaring send-off?
(Answers will be published in Saturday's Daily.)
♦ * *
With deepest blushes, we proudly present our offering
to the New Songs contest (cash prizes). It has all the
qualifications of a great song of the newer school —
doesn't mention California, has snappy, original words,
and the tune —say, it's by one of the best woman com
posers on the campus!
FIGHT ! ! ! ! !
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Chorus:
Fight-fight-fight
Fight-fight-fight
Fight-fight-fight?
It all depends on the point of view. Of course, the
rally was rather exclusive (we're nothing if not char
itable), but it was worth staying for, even to the bitter
end when the women's section began running up the
seats to the rim.

long it's time for another St. Patrick on the Quad.

Phil Newill
Cabbages wishes to take this opportunity of expressing
gratification for the crowd that turned out at the rally
last night. Just think of it, every loyal Stanford student
—all 300 of 'em —went way down there to express his
faith in the team In yells that could be heard clear
across the stadium.
* • •
Who says the Stanford spirit is not what it used to be?
Wasn't every live Stanford man and woman in the
University making a deafening amount of noise? And
didn't they snap out the yells with a different brand of
the good old fight than they ever had before? And
won't the same loyal, patriotic, fighting, hard-boiled,
square-shooting, undiscouraged, red-blooded gang that
filled their seats in the stadium be down at the station
tonight, and won't they give the varsity the same rip
roaring send-off?
(Answers will be published in Saturday's Daily.)

With deepest blushes, we proudly present our offering
to the New Songs contest (cash prizes). It has all the
qualifications of a great song of the newer school —
doesn't mention California, has snappy, original words,
and the tune —say, it's by one of the best woman com
posers on the campus!
FIGHT ! ! ! ! !
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Chorus:
Fight-fight-fight
Fight-fight-fight
Fight-fight-fight?
It all depends on the point of view. Of course, the
rally was rather exclusive (we're nothing if not char
itable), but it was worth staying for, even to the bitter
end when the women's section began running up the
seats to the rim.
