To the Editor:
Our mutual friend, Eddie Waful,
broke into print yesterday with a let
ter commending the Executive Com
mittee for its stand on charity drives.
As far as he stayed on that theme he
was in accord with the great majority
Of us, but unfortunately he wandered
off into a loosely-worded criticism of
the Y. M. C. A.
I am no great friend of that organ
ization, and am not in the least inter
ested in any of its activities, but I do
not believe that any such indiscrimin
ating criticism should be published
without reply.
This is no place to go into a general
discussion of the success or failure of
the war work of the Y. M. C. A. but it
might not be amiss to point out that in
the opinion of the writer, formed
after twenty-two months' service in
France, no organization was more in
strumental in securing some degree of
comfort to the enlisted men of the
Army than the Y. M. C. A. It did a
work as much greater than that of any
other relief organization as its size j
and scope was greater.
This opinion was confirmed by being !
on a board of nine officers, this board
being directed to inquire into the truth
and justice of certain charges and i
rumors that had general circulation 1
among the troops in France. The re- j
port of this committee, rendered to j
G. H. Q. on March 28tli, 1919, con
cluded with these words:
"In the opinion of this board there
have been errors in some phases of
the management of this organization,
but on the whole the men who have
been responsible for its work are to
be commended for their efficiency in
the face of most serious obstacles.
Graft has been remarkably scarce, and
the sum total of its benefits constitute
an effort for which every member of
the American Expeditionary Forces
should be duly appreciative and grate
ful."
That sentiment is exactly the same
j as that of every board of a military or
11011-military character that has in
quired into the war work of the Y. M.
C. A.and the same as that expressed
by General Pershing on his return to
the United States. Why can't we ac
cept these reports instead of the lat
rine epics of the Army? â€”W. L. S.
