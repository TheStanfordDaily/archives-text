Because the residence of a father
is considered to be that of his son.
numerous protests have been made to
the Regents of the University of Cali
fornia regarding the non-resident fee
system. In a recent case, a student,
who had lived in California with his
mother for ten years, was required to
pay $75 because his father lived in
New York.
Such complaints have led Senator
Frank Carr of Oakland to prepare an
amendment to be submitted to the
legislature at its next session.
