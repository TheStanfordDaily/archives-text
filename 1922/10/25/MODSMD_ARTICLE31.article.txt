There are no pigmies among "Tiny"
Thornhill's line candidates. DeGroot,
center; Houck. Pheney, Cravens, Lu
deke, Faville, guards, all weigh over
190. There isn't much of a lack of
experienced men, either. DeGroot was
one of the best centers on the Coast
last year, and is going to repeat. Lu
deke was no mean tackle, while Faville
and Cravens have both been through
the mill.
This man Cook of Hunt's squad
has a deceiving knack of fumbling
the ball when receiving a punt,
recovering it and then cutting
through the whole field of oppon
ents bearing down on him for a
gain of forty or fifty yards or a
touchdown.
The punting of Mills, Berkeley High
half, was noted by spectators as one
of the features of the Dinks' prelim
inary game last Saturday. Mills is
another of Hunt's products who turned
their skill against him and his fresh
men. Hunt trained Mills carefully dur
ing the football turnout last spring,
and had the rather doubtful satisfac
tion Saturday of seeing the youngster
live up to his instructions.
St. Mary's at the start of the
game unintentionally pulled a play
that isn't seen very often. Black
booted the ball out of bounds twice
on the kick-off. Referee Braddock
presented the ball to the Cardinals
in mid-field, thus making them a
gift of about twenty yards.
Referee Smith, who arbited the
opening game, has been an official in
other Berkeley high games this season,
and declared that the prep team out
did itself Saturday. Coach Hunt did not
think as much for his charges, and
told them so last night.
Hunt sent most of his array of 1
cripples into the game before the
second half was over. Sholes,
whose finger was badly sprained
in the Lowell game, relieved Har
ville at left guard with his hand j
in an aluminum casing. Ernie Nev
ers, the 190-pound fullback who
has been out with a bad shoulder,
was moaning around the locker
room before the game that he
was no ''Crip" any more. Hunt
took him at his word, and sent him j
in during the second quarter for
Cook.
"Doc" Goodrich, the hefty line
man, also got a chance at his
regular position on right tackle in
the first half, and failed to show
any after effects of his bruised
thigh.

There are no pigmies among "Tiny"
Thornhill's line candidates. DeGroot,
center; Houck. Pheney, Cravens, Lu
deke, Faville, guards, all weigh over
190. There isn't much of a lack of
experienced men, either. DeGroot was
one of the best centers on the Coast
last year, and is going to repeat. Lu
deke was no mean tackle, while Faville
and Cravens have both been through
the mill.
This man Cook of Hunt's squad
has a deceiving knack of fumbling
the ball when receiving a punt,
recovering it and then cutting
through the whole field of oppon
ents bearing down on him for a
gain of forty or fifty yards or a
touchdown.
The punting of Mills, Berkeley High
half, was noted by spectators as one
of the features of the Dinks' prelim
inary game last Saturday. Mills is
another of Hunt's products who turned
their skill against him and his fresh
men. Hunt trained Mills carefully dur
ing the football turnout last spring,
and had the rather doubtful satisfac
tion Saturday of seeing the youngster
live up to his instructions.
St. Mary's at the start of the
game unintentionally pulled a play
that isn't seen very often. Black
booted the ball out of bounds twice
on the kick-off. Referee Braddock
presented the ball to the Cardinals
in mid-field, thus making them a
gift of about twenty yards.
Referee Smith, who arbited the
opening game, has been an official in
other Berkeley high games this season,
and declared that the prep team out
did itself Saturday. Coach Hunt did not
think as much for his charges, and
told them so last night.
Hunt sent most of his array of 1
cripples into the game before the
second half was over. Sholes,
whose finger was badly sprained
in the Lowell game, relieved Har
ville at left guard with his hand j
in an aluminum casing. Ernie Nev
ers, the 190-pound fullback who
has been out with a bad shoulder,
was moaning around the locker
room before the game that he
was no ''Crip" any more. Hunt
took him at his word, and sent him j
in during the second quarter for
Cook.
"Doc" Goodrich, the hefty line
man, also got a chance at his
regular position on right tackle in
the first half, and failed to show
any after effects of his bruised
thigh.
