# Organ Recitals
## 
### 
Miss Elizabeth Peirce and Bolton
Whijte, violinists, will assist Latham
True, acting University organist, at the
organ recital tomorrow in the Memorial
Church. The following program will
be played:
Prelude in G minor Bach
Largo (sonata in D minor for two
violins) Bach
Miss White and Miss Peirce
Carillon Leo Sowerby
An impressionistic composition by a
promising Chicago composer. Mr.
Sowerby has caught the elusive quality
of chiming bells borne upon the breeze
across long flat stretches of country,
as one hears them in Belgium.
Echo Pietro Yon
A scherzo-like interplay between gal
lery and echo organs.
Two Movements from the Suite, "In
India" R. S. Stoughton
(a) The Grove of Palms
(b) By the Ganges
Atmospheric rather than descriptive,
these movements possess a peculiar
charm from Mr. Stoughton's use of
modern harmonies.
Prelude in C-sharp minor Sergei
Rachmaninoff.
