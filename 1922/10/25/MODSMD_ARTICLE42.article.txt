NEW YORK, Oct. 25.—Harvard
stands out as perhaps the best and the
strongest team in the East. The Crim
son showed itself to be the farthest
advanced, at least, by the ease with
which it defeated Centre college.
Harvard, Army, Navy, Cornell, Penn
State, Lafayette, Princeton, and
Georgetown remain undefeated in the
East, while Brown and W. & J. have
each played a tie game.
lowa's narrow escape from defeat at
the hands of Illinois and the victory of
Michigan, over Ohio State were the
features of the last week in the West
ern Conference. Chicago, Michigan,
lowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota have
yet to be beaten in the Conference,
Chicago leading with two victories.
Leaders of the South had a bad day.
While Centre was being run over by
Harvard, the great Navy team was
beating Georgia Tech.
Cornell, with a total of 203 points
scored in four games, is keeping close
to the "point a minute" class and is
leading the East in scoring. Notre
Dame leads in the Middle West with
14(3 points. California is the best on
the coast with 191 points.
Harry Wilson, the veteran Penn
State halfback, leads the eastern stars
in individual scoring with 55 points
from nine touchdowns and one goal
after a touchdown. Robertson, Car
negie Tech quarterback, is second with
54 points; Brunner, Lafayette back, is
