# TRYOUTS BEGIN TODAY FOR FOOTBALL REVUE
## 
### 
Tryouts for "The Football Frothies
of '22" began this afternoon in the As
sembly Hall with a large number of
students reporting for the preliminaries.
Tryouts will be continued this evening
from 7 to 10 and again tomorrow from
3 to 0 and 7to 10 p.m. Ram's Head an
nounces that participation in this pro
duction will not count as one of the three
shows in which students are allowed to
take part in during the college year.
The "Frothies" will be in two acts and
fifteen scenes and will be of a local
character. "Because of the short dura
tion of each scene, a great amount of
concentrated work by each student will
not be necessary," according to Arnold
Bayley, '23. assistant director of the pro
duction. "It is not as if the student
were participating in a regular play."
The manuscripts are ready for use
and the directors will commence work
immediately after the players have been
chosen. The fifteen musical hits are
catchy; the major scenes are all spec
tacular; and according to the directors,
the laughter which flows from every
line of dialogue and from every scene
will throw the audience into fits of
convulsions.
