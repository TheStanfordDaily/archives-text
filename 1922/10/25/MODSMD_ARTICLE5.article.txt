SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25.â€”Henry
Wilkens, worn with questioning but
still fighting, today was to undergo
further cross-examination in his trial
for the alleged murder of his wife,
Anna.
It. was believed that the cross-exam
ination would be completed during the
day.
Yesterday's session came to a close
in a dramatic outburst, marked by an
appeal to the jury by Wilkens and by
increasingly tortuous questioning by
Assistant District Attorney Leo Fried
man.
"She is the only woman I ever
loved," he said, his eyes full of tears.
He declared that Helen Lange, with
whom he admitted intimate relations,
had tried to prevent his reconciliation
with Mrs. Wilkens.
