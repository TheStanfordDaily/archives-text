# LIMIT ON CAMPUS DRIVES IS PLACED AT FOUR PER YEAR
## All Organizations Will Appeal on Same Blank; Endowment and R.C. Not Affected 
### 
Drives for charitable funds through
organized campaigns and personal soli
citation of students will be limited to
one each quarter on the Stanford campus
hereafter. This was the decision of the
Social Service Board at a meeting yes
terday afternoon in response to a recom
mendation of the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students that the num
ber of such drives be limited.
The Social Service Board formulated
a system for the conduct of these quar
terly appeals designeAto give full oppor
tunity for all worthy enterprises to call
upon the members of the student body
for financial support while protecting
the students from unexpected and too
frequent calls upon them. The system
now instituted, the Social Service Board
hopes, will lead to well-considered and
hearty support of worthy causes as well
as to the protection of the students
against the difficulties and embarass
ments that have resulted from piling up
appeals in such manner that the students
could not meet all the requests that have
sometimes been made.
Once each quarter of the college year
including the summer term, all organ
izations which select that quarter for
their campaign will be given an oppor
tunity to do so at that time. Subscrip
tion blanks will be prepared with all
the appeals for that quarter listed upon
them, giving each student the opportun
ity of choosing which one or ones he
will give to.
The actual presentation of these
blanks and the collection of the money
will be made by designated members of
the living groups and by representa
lives of the organizations appealing for
funds. Each organization may make
as thorough an appeal as it desires and
may circularize, write letters or state
its case by any other methods without
restriction, but the blank for subscrip
tions to any or all enterprises will be
presented by the living group representa
tive chosen for that duty.
As early as possible in the year a list
of organizations planning to make ap
peals will be made public, with the
quarter in which appeals will come. The
Social Service Board requests that all
these organizations should notify it in
order that the program for the year
may be arranged as early and completely
as possible.
The First Million for Stanford Cam
paign, for aN long as it may continue
is not to be included in the new arrange
ment, but to be handled independently
as at present. Exception is made also
this year for the annual membership roll
call of the national Red Cross. •
Incidental appeals for small sums,
made occasionally by students for stud
ent body enterprises, must have the ap
proval of tlu' Executive Committee of
the Associated Students.
Appeals sent through the mails have
no limit or regulations put upon them,
nor have call- for voluntary contribu
tions, not accompanied by personal solici
tation. „ a
Any big, sudden, outstanding call for
help may be met by an appeal made by
the President of the University.
