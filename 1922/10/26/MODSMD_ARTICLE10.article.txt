# QUAD URGES SENIORS TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN IMMEDIATELY
## 
### 
To facilitate orderly procedure, Charles
White, '24 Quad manager, urges that as
many seniors as possible who have not
as yet appeared at Stone's in Palo Alto to
be snapped for the 1924 Quad, do so at
once. "Work will progress much more
rapidly with the book and it will be
more convenient for you if you will
appear now rather than later when you
will have to come at a definite time,"
White declares.
The slips which were given on payment
of the fees must be presented to the
photographer at the time seniors appear.
All who have as yet not paid the amount
may do so any day between 1 and 2 at
the Quad office in the Administration
building.
