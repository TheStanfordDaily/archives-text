# JEALOUSY BETWEEN WOMEN IS FACTOR IN PLOT OF PLAY
## 
### 
Kingdoms have been destroyed: mighty
barks have been steered into stormy
seas—all because of the jealousy of
Woman. A winsome, meek thing she
may be when happy, but when she is
aroused—there is some truth in the state
ment that the female of the species is
more deadly than the male. At least so
ruminates the philosopher who scans the
coming Sword and Sandals play.
Jealousy plays an important part in
the nufolding of the plot of "Her Hus
band's Wife" which will be presented on
November 3in the Assembly Hall. Irene
Randolph, played by Gertrude McLeod,
'25, for shine reason peculiar to her
type, has become possessed of the notion
that she is going to die. Being of a
considerate disposition, she decides to
select a second wife for her husband be
fore she dies, so that she will be assured
that he will receive kind treatment after
her death. Consequently, she chooses for
him a motherly sort of person, who, from
all indications Irene supposes is a sit-by
the-fire, darn-his-socks type of wife.
In the second act of the play, the tide
begins to turn and Irene regrets her
action. Jealous embers are fanned, and
the looks which she gives Emily Ladew,
played by Emily Wardman, '22, "the other
woman in the case" are anything hut
quiet and comforting.
What caused this sudden change in
Irene's attitude? Was Emily Ladew of
the disposition that she first supposed?
There are chances to rock with laughter
at Irene Randolph's manifestations before
the curtain rolls down on the second act.
