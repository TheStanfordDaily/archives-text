# LARGE SQUADS TURN OUT‘ FOR INTERCIASS FOOTBALL
## 
### 
"Rookies" got a world of fun and a
few hard knocks out of the first night's
training in the newly inaugurated
inter-class football spasm. Following
preliminary meetings yesterday, four
squads were out on Field No. 1 for
their first practice this afternoon. The
work merely consisted of letting the
beginners learn what a football feels
like. Kicking and passing was the
main thing, for actual scrimmage will
not begin until the teams are selected
and uniforms issued next week.
The work was carried on under the
supervision of Dr. W. H. Barrow, Di
rector of Intramural Athletics Davis
and Duffy Seay. Two members from
each class acted as manager and coach
of their respective squads.
Something in the nature of a bomb
shell was thrown into the works when
it was announced that the third fresh
man eleven, which has been in train
ing ever since school started, will up
hold the honors of the class of *26
when actual play gets under way on
November 11. Under the able tutelage
of Jake Irwin, directed always by
Coach "Husky" Hunt, this outfit has
learned quite a bit of football and has
the jump on the other teams. The
squad averages about 145 pounds.

Other freshmen may try out for the
team, it was announced.
r I he lineup of the frosh team at pres
ent is as follows: Williams and Carter,
ends; Neff and Barnett, tackles; Wid
amen and Pope, guards; Condit and
Reynolds, centers; Dicky and Reeves,
quarterbacks; Chase and Trippett,
halfbacks, and Stratton, fullback.
By far the largest turnout was that
of the sophomore class, more than 50
signing up the first night. R. Hoffman
was chosen manager and. temporarily,
at least, coach. Lawrence Duryea was
named manager and Glenn Pollard
| coach of the Seniors, who turned out
twenty strong.
R. L. Walter, Junior manager, is
asking for more candidates. At pres
ent he has only nine men out. The
Juniors who are out at present are
Kauffman, Schwartz, Mcßae, Timraons,
Berry, Mc-Hose, Kirk. Merrill, and Ir
win.
The interclass football managers de
cided that holdovers will be eligible
' to play with the seniors. L. M. Duryea,
manager of the seniors, has announced
i that the first practice of the senior
| team will take place Friday afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
