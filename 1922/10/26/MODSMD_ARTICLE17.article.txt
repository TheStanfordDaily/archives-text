# "Freshmen, Do Your Stuff" Says Chappie Art Editor in Plea
## 
### 
Freshmenâ€”Chappie wants you to
show your stuff.
If there is any ability along artistic
lines in the entering class, Fred
Fisher, '24, art editor of Chaparral,
believes that it is time for it to be
showing up. He emphatically urges all
freshmen who have ever put their
ideas into pictures, or who even think
they can, to submit contributions for
next month's issue. They will be grate
fully received either by Fisher at the
Delta Upsilon house or at the Chapar
ral office in the Press Building.
Incidentally, Fisher extends the call
for art material to members of the
other classes, either old or new.
Chappie wants more art work and
wants it badly.
