# CONSERVATION OF REDWOODS URGED BY JOSEPH GRANT

• "Ultimately there will be in California
a 'Highway of the Giants,' traversing
the entire original Redwoods region from
'The Southern Sentinel,' southermost
Redwood in the world located a few
miles from Monterey, to the northern
most tree of this species above the Cali
fornia-Oregon line. This 'highway' will
connect each of the isolated groves of
Sequoias which have been saved," was
the prophecy made by J. D. Grant, Chair
man of the Board of Directors of Save
the Redwoods League, in an address on
Saving California's Redwoods" in the
Little Theater yesterday afternoon.
"The a ; ms of the League are three
fold: first, t osave as complete a stretch
of timber along the main highways of
the state as is feasible; second, to bring
about the establishment of Federal ap
propriation a National Park, comprising
at least 20,000 acres of primeval Red
wood forest; and third, to aid in scien
tific forestry and reforestation.
"It is through the league's intervention
that the redwoods along our state high
way have been preserved. The Santa
Cruz park was made a state asset prin
cipally through the efforts of Professor
Wing of the University," Mr. Grant
continued.
"There are a number of reasons for
saving the Redwoods. In addition to
saving them as trees of indescribable
beauty, we are saving them as one of the
scientific wonders of the world, and as a
great economic asset of the State and the
nation.
"Forest service figures show that of
the original virgin Redwood timber, only
a little less than a million acres remain
standing, and that this area is being cut
over at the rate of 6,500 acres per year.
All of the original trees will disappear in
the next 100 years. The most important
consideration is this: That the Redwoods
in their finest form and in the regions
where they are most accessible to the
public are already disappearing. Most
of them will be gone within the next
ten years. The best Redwoods are being
cut first, and it is these we must save.
The Sequoias of California have been
likened to an ancient race of giants mak
ing their last stand."
