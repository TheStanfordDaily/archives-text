# Hoover Library Acquires Radical War Literature
## 
### 
An important collection of pacific and
radical literature has been acquired by
the Hoover War Library through the j
courtesy Mrs. George Millar, Jr., ex.
'10, daughter of Ewald Flugel, now in
Riverside, California.
The material includes phamphlets edit
ed by societies such-as the National Civil
Liberties Bureau, American Union
Against Militarism, People's Council of
America for Democracy of Peace, and
The Christian Conscientious Objectors.
These papers were published before and
after America entered the war and are
evidence of the pacific propaganda that
was spread about at that period.
Stanford graduates all over the country
are taking interest in the Hoover War I
Library and this is an instance when |
valuable material has been obtained I
through them.
