# FABLE OF THE DUB AND THE TUB
## 
### 
l'or many long" years there did exist in a good
University a wicked custom; and the name of this
University was Stanford and the name of the custom
was "tubbing. And it came to pass that many
sages who dwelt without the Kingdom of Stanford
waxed wroth when they heard of"this custom; and
they came unto the Administration, saying, "Oh,
most gracious Administration, stretch forth thine
hand and pluck this tare from thy fair fields; smile
not upon this tradition for it maketh all men to go
through one mold." The Administration hearkened
unto these words of wisdom and lo! there was writ
ten upon the tablets a law which forbade the custom.
And when knowledge of this law came to the ears
of the wise men of the Student Kingdom, there
arose a great outcry and the lords from among them
did go before the Administration saying, "Oh,
gracious rulers, look not darkly upon our handi
work, for behold, we perform miracles. Each year
we conquer in war a class and do enslave these
prisoners and make them to follow in our footsteps.
Verily, we are the makers of men."
But the soft words of the wise men fell as seed
on barren soil and the students of the Kingdom did
hie themselves to the hills there to hold converse
and to have council of themselves. And it came to
pass that all the wise men among the students kept
not to the law but ignored the words of the sages
and the laws of the Administration. Even so the
eyes of the Administration did flash with fire and,
behold, many wise men went forth into exile and
all the tubs were transported from the Kingdom.
The wise men did again hold council of themselves
and hardening their hearts did go forth with their
slaves to tubs without the Kingdom's walls. And
there water and tears did flow freely and a plague
of pneumonia did sicken the slaves.
And great was the outcry among the prisoners un
til they were freed from bondage, when lo! they did
seek vengeance of those who followed even as those
before them had sought vengeance upon them. The
Administration bethought itself that this was not
good to look upon and would have stretched forth
its hand a third time, but it came to pass that there
entered the Kingdom a class of prisoners whose num
ber was 1923. Now there were amongst this tribe
certain fanatics who did look with scorn upon the
forbidden custom and did upbraid the wise men
from among the students for their conduct. Rut the
water did still flow freely and because of that which
was written upon the tablets of stone and of bronze
there was loud laughter throughout the land.
There did then replace the first class a second and
the number of the new class was 1924. And great
was the surprise of the graybeard wise men when
they saw that the fanatics from the tribe of 1923
looked not with favor on the tub as was the custom
of those before them; fearing of this the slaves re
joiced and the gravbeards did lament accordingly.
Even again there came a class, one 1925 of num-<
her, whereupon certain lords of 1924 did agree
among themselves saving, "There shall be no
tubbing. Let us not do that which is forbidden."
And the Administration smiled upon them, but the
graybeards did whisper words of ill portent in their
ears and the leaders did again harden their hearts
and go forth to the tub, hearkening not to the en
treaties of the fanatics.
And so it was that when the slaves of 1925 came
into their rule and had admitted to their Kingdom,
1926, the wise among them also did agree among
themselves, saying, "Thou shalt not tub; for behold,
he who maketh a freshman to take Searsville within
himself shall receive no mercy. Let this be the law
and let the name of him who breaketh it to be known
to the Council of Men."
Atul the administration did look upon this handi
work and it was good. And verily, I say unto you.

when the word reached the ears of the fanatics, the
sun did come from behind the mists and did shed
light upon all.
But the fanatics were not to be soothed with oily
words and did say unto 1 { )25, "Behold, oh worthy
class, thou art good to look upon ; but hearken unto
these things; be not the mouther of rights and the
maker of wrongs. Follow not the footsteps of
nor of other classes before ye, for verily they did
depart from the truth. Thy word must be law
among ye. And even so, take not too great credit
to thyself for this deed, for behold, it is lorig since
the written law. Thou but dost uphold it."
So saying, the fanatics girded up their loins, did
take their beds upon their backs, and did go forth to
May field to watch over the water troughs which
were without the Kingdom; for well the fanatics
knew that where there dwell ten honest men, there
dwells among them one who knows not truth.
Moral: Whosoever be tubbed, be he the least
among ye, he shall seek vengeance of another: and
he who bringeth on vengeance shall not enter the
Kingdom of Graduation; wherefore brethren, be of
good cheer, for one may not live without the other.
