"Dear Cabbages," writes a campus correspondent, "I
think it is perfectly ducky that the poster fight is under
criticism. We boys of the better class, who seek to
control our animal nature, are strongly in favor of
instituting a yearly tea-fight instead of the present vi
cious shambles. It is most shocking to a sensitive
nature, you know, when a rather rough person accosts
you in the middle of the night and asks you why the
goodness gracious aren't you out with the rest of the
freshmen getting a hose down your throat.
"The tea-fight could be conducted under the supervi
sion of the Palo Alto Auxiliary Police, and would, I am
sure, be perfectly safe if all contestants were strictly
warned not to allow any base personal animosity to
arise at any time. I myself would be willing to lead our
forces into such a battle as this. Let us down with
violence! The new era, my fellow classmates, has
come!"

Intelligence among our college students, says a New
York paper, has reached a new low level. We desire to
refute this. To this end, there is printed below a sample
law case. Anyone briefing it and sending it in correctly
stamped and addressed will get its name 011 the Roll,
which will be sent to New York by freight to said
newspaper.

BLUMP v. BLUMP, and OTHERS
Defendant says plaintiff stuck chewing gum on rear
wheel of def.'s Ford, thereby rendering def. unable to
start for some time, causing thereby def. to miss train,
which caused def. much mental grief. Def. sues plain
tiff. Pltff. nonsuits on ground of high price of fall styles.
Def. in reply sent following telegram: "Maybe." Is this
a contract? Who told you? BLUMP, J. J. J. J. Judgment
for Blump.

"Dear Cabbages," writes a campus correspondent, "I
think it is perfectly ducky that the poster fight is under
criticism. We boys of the better class, who seek to
control our animal nature, are strongly in favor of
instituting a yearly tea-fight instead of the present vi
cious shambles. It is most shocking to a sensitive
nature, you know, when a rather rough person accosts
you in the middle of the night and asks you why the
goodness gracious aren't you out with the rest of the
freshmen getting a hose down your throat.
"The tea-fight could be conducted under the supervi
sion of the Palo Alto Auxiliary Police, and would, I am
sure, be perfectly safe if all contestants were strictly
warned not to allow any base personal animosity to
arise at any time. I myself would be willing to lead our
forces into such a battle as this. Let us down with
violence! The new era, my fellow classmates, has
come!"
