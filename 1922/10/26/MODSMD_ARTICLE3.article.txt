DENVER, Oct. 26.â€”William G. Mc-
Adoo, former secretary of the treas
ury, was surprised to learn that he was
"sick" when he arrived here last night
en route to Salt Lake City, Utah. Mc-
Adoo explained to newspapermen that
he had retired early at Newton, Kan.,
and when the train reached Dodge City
the porter refused to awaken him de
spite protests of a delegation of demo
crats.
When he reached Denver, McAdoo
found a stack of telegrams inquiring
about his health.
