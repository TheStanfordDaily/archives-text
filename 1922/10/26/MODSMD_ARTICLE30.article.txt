NEW YORK, Oct. 25.—Tommy Gib
bons, St. Paul light-heavyweight, is
now ready to help Jack Dempsey, the
heavyweight king, out of the idle class.
Eddie Kane, manager of the St. Paul
boxer, announces in a letter that Gib
bons wants to meet the champion in a
bout for the title this winter.
"Gibbons is now in the best form of
his career and he believes that he is
entitled to a chance for the heavy
weight title. We have never bothered
the champion with challenges before
because we did not believe we were
ready. We do now," Kane said.
While he is some pounds lighter
than Dempsey. Gibbons figures that
weight disparity was not figured in the
Dempsey-Willard or the Dempsey-Car
pentier fights, and that it should not
the Frenchman ran out on him.
Gibbons wants to fight Battling Siki
if the Senegalese battler comes to
this country. He figures lie should be
given first consideration because he
was deprived of an earlier opportunity
by the unsportsmanlike conduct of
Carpentier.

Tommy has had more tough breaks
than any of the prominent heavy
weights. He worked hard and reached
the position where he was the logical

contender for Carpentier's light-heavy
weight title. He signed for a bout and
