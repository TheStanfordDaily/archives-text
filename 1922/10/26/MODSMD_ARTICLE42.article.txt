# PRIZES OFFERED FOR NEW SONGS AND YELLS
## 
### 
A contest for new songs and yells,
with prizes for those chosen, has been
announced by Yell Leader Lou Minsky,
starting yesterday and closing next
Wednesday. A song without "Cali
fornia" mentioned in it, one that can
be used in other games as well, is the
special need.
A departure from the customary
spelling and shouting of "Stanford" is
being planned. New sounds that will
boom out over the stadium are wanted
in these yells.
Suggestions for Big Game stunts are
in order, says Minsky. All offerings will
be given consideration by the Rally
committee.
