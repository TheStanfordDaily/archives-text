# SQUAD SENT NORTH WITH FINAL RALLY AT STATION
## Houck, Taylor Are Declared Ineligible; Cards May Face Wet Field 
### 
Coach Andy Kerr and his tribe of
twenty-seven gridiron warriors tonight
are speeding along in Southern Oregon,
rapidly nearing Albany, where they leave
the main line to go to Corvallis.
Two hundred and fifty Cardinal root
ers cheered themselves hoarse at an im
promptu rally last night as the Cardinal
delegation drew out of Palo Alto on the
6 :08 train.
Old Man Eligibility reached out with
a long arm and grabbed two of Kerr's
men just as they were about to board
the train, necessitating a change in the
personnel of the squad. George Houck,
who has started at right guard in every
game, and Thatch Taylor, substitute full
back, will play no varsity footbaJJ this
season.
In their places Kerr selected "Kewp"
Sproull, end on the 1921 varsity, but un
der the new scheme of things, a back
field man, and "Tex" Middleton, one of
Thornhill's candidates for end.
Houck isn't lost to Stanford football
altogether, however. He lacks enough
units to play with the varsity, but is elig
ible for the freshmen eleven. The loss
of Taylor along with Houck, puts Kerr
in a peculiar position. The Cardinal
coach had just about decided to take
Douglass out of the backfield and let
him have a fling at his old guard position.
Now there must be somebody to relieve
Murray and Cuddeback, and Douglass is
about the only one available.
The Aggies, so far this season, have
not proved themselves as "fighting" as
they used to be. In their opening tussle
they barely beat Whitman College, 3 to
0, and Enoch Bagshaw's Seattle-ites
tramped over them in the second, 14 to
7.
How the Cardinals will fare in their
test Saturday will depend largely on the
weather conditions in that land of per
petual rain. No Stanford team ever has
been a "mudder," and a wet ball is almost
certain to mean fumbles. Plenty of rain
won't make the slivers in the saw-dust
of the Aggies' field as bad as usual, but
soggy saw-dust is far different from a
fast dry turf.
Kerr indicated before he left that .*ie
did not intend to make any radical changes
in the Stanford line-up. Fred Ludeke,
will start instead of Houck. It is a toss
up between Lawson and Dole for right
end, but otherwise the team will probably
be the same as the one that started the
St. Mary's game.
