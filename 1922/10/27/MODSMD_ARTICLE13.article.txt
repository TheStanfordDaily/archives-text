# Theme Songs Will Be Used in Football Show
## 
### 
Further tryouts for the "Football
Frothies of '22" were held in the As
sembly Hall this afternoon. Those who
have successfully passed the preliminaries
will be notified by telephone for the
Monday eliminations.
A complete program of musical num
bers has been drawn up. "Chick" Midg
ley, musical director, plans to run in two
or three of the best musical pieces
throughout the show, as was done in
the 1922 Junior Opera. The compositions
received an unusually large
number of contributors.
