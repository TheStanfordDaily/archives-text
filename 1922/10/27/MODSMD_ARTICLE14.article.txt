# THREE ELEVENS PLAY TOMORROW
## MARINE ELEVEN TO PLAY BETTS' GRAYS ON FARM TOMORROW 
### 
And now we have with us the grays
who will meet the Mare Island Marines
in the headliner of tomorrow's football
schedule on the Farm. Coach Betts'
huskies will hog the limelight in the ab
sence of the varsity.
Betts has not given his team a minute's
rest since last Saturday's double header.
1 uesday and Wednesday nights the grays
scrimmaged the freshmen and last night
a dummy scrimmage and skull practice
kept them busy. " The grays have
looked better in the two scrimmages with
the yearling squad than they have at
any time this season. Their plays are
working more smoothly and they are
| getting rid of the habit of fumbling
which caused them no end of trouble
last Saturday.
Fuller, who has been showing up well
! at quarter, has been out with an injured
| shoulder but will be in shape for the
! game tomorrow. Black has been among
the cripples for the past week with a
pulled muscle in his side but he will be
ready to take his place at end if he is
needed.
The Marines seem to be a team of
"in-and-outers." After holding Bob
Evans' fighting Olympics to thirteen
j points, they lost to California by a score
Jof 80-0. No definite information is avail-
I able as to their present strength except
that they are a dangerous bunch when
J they are "right."
"The grays have improved materially
j since last Saturday," says Betts, "and I
I expect a close, hard fought game. There
i is one thing that my team knows better
1 than anything else and that is fight."
After tomorrow only two games re-
I main on the gray's schedule. They will
j meet the Agnetian Club on November
4 and the California "goofs" on Novcm
; ber 11 at Berkeley in the preliminary to
I the freshman game.
The game tomorrow begins at 2:30.
The grays will line up as follows to
morrow: center, Williams; guards, Hayes
,uk! Rogers: tackles, \fcCoombs and Rob
inson ; ends, Widaman and Long; quarter,
Puller; right half, Hamilton; left half,
Grondona or Erhorn; full back, Wood
| head.
Other men who may break into the
I game are: Crawford, guard; Driscoll,
| tackle; Black, end: Coverley and Haw
| kins, halves; Blacker, quarter; W r right,

Here is Rae Doughty, '23, varsity
halfback, headed for the imaginary
O. A. C. goal line with the ball tucked
under his arm.
