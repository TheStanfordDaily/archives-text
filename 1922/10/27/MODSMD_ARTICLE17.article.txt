# STORM THREATENS ON EVE OF VARSITY GAME AT CORVALLIS
## 
### 
CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 28. — (Special
Dispatch)— Overhanging clouds leave
little hope that the Oregon Aggie-Stan
ford gridiron battle tomorrow after
noon will be played under a clear sky.
The field, already wetted down by
the intermittent rains of the past few
days, will be in good playing condition
if the threatening storm holds off till
tomorrow evening.
Coach Andrew Kerr led his string
of twenty-seven stalwarts from the
golden state into this college town in
the Willamette valley this morning,
and had them don the moleskins for a
light work-out.
"Dad" Butler, veteran O. A. C.- train
er, last night pronounced every man
in good condition for the contest.
Neither Dick Rutherford, Beaver
coach, nor Kerr, in charge of the
Cardinals, has anything to say.
The teams will probably start as
follows:
Stanford Position Oregon Aggies
Mertz • LER Scott
Shipkey LTR Micklewait
Ludeke LGR Clark
DeGroot (c) C Rich
