# STORM THREATENS ON EVE OF VARSITY GAME AT CORVALLIS
## 
### 
CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 28. — (Special
Dispatch)— Overhanging clouds leave
little hope that the Oregon Aggie-Stan
ford gridiron battle tomorrow after
noon will be played under a clear sky.
The field, already wetted down by
the intermittent rains of the past few
days, will be in good playing condition
if the threatening storm holds off till
tomorrow evening.
Coach Andrew Kerr led his string
of twenty-seven stalwarts from the
golden state into this college town in
the Willamette valley this morning,
and had them don the moleskins for a
light work-out.
"Dad" Butler, veteran O. A. C.- train
er, last night pronounced every man
in good condition for the contest.
Neither Dick Rutherford, Beaver
coach, nor Kerr, in charge of the
Cardinals, has anything to say.
The teams will probably start as
follows:
Stanford Position Oregon Aggies
Mertz • LER Scott
Shipkey LTR Micklewait
Ludeke LGR Clark
DeGroot (c) C Rich
Cravens RGL Ash
Johnston RTL (a) Loeey
Dole or Lawson REL McFadden
Woodward Q Garber
Doughty RHL Miller
Wilcox LHR Gill
Cuddebaok F Tousey
Up in Oregon, the land of perpetual
rain, the first Kerr-made Stanford
varsity faces the fire tomorrow after
noon. None too good as far as reputa
tion goes, but with the advantage of
playing on familiar grounds, the Ore
gon Aggies are formidable enough to
put any eleven to the test.
Reprimand or no reprimand, reputa
tion or no reputation, experience or no
experience, the Cardinal squad left
Palo Alto Wednesday night determined
to clean up on the Beavers or dis
band. Not that they have shown any
thing so far to lead one to believe they
can. clean up on anybody. But they
have bectfme so thoroughly imbued
with the idea that they can beat any
Oregon Aggie team, that they feel
they can fly in the face of 100 to 1
odds and still turn the trick.
It's going to be a hard fight all the
way through tomorrow —harder still
for Stanford if it rains. Two Beaver
guards, Ash and Clarke, who weigh
over 200 pounds, are going to make a
lot of trouble for the center of Thorn
hill's line. Percy Locey, the Aggie cap
tain, plays left tackle. Rutherford's
ends, Scott and McFadden, are espe
cially strong on the aerial game.
Weight and speed are combined in
the Aggie backfield. Luke Gill, who
also does tricks with the basketball,
and Miller rely on off-tackle plays for
yardage. Tousey is the "plunging full
back" for Rutherford's cohorts. That
leaves Garber to do the thinking, run
interference, throw forward passes,
and drop-kick. They say that he boots
them over from all parts of the field.
Up bobs that reprimand affair again.
Corvallis is in the private dominion
of U. G. Duback, who as president of
the Conference, was largly responsible
for Stanford's reprimand. The O. A. C.
students themselves are none too
kindly disposed toward the Cardinals
who they claim beat the Conference
out of 30,000 round dollars. Naturally,
Kerr's men won't remember that repri
mand any too kindly, unless they are
awed by the presence of Duback him
self.
If the Cards once get their fighting
blood up, then they should arrive in a
hurry—unless fumbles on the wet field
take the heart out of them. The Beav
ers themselves are not credited with
having any too much of a punch with
in the shadows of the goal-posts. So
if Dud DeGroot and his associate bone
crushers in the line play real football
and open up the holes, Doughty, Wil
cox, Cuddeback and Woodward ought
to be able to shove over enough touch
downs to keep that straight-win record
over the Oregon Aggies intact.

CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 28. — (Special
Dispatch)— Overhanging clouds leave
little hope that the Oregon Aggie-Stan
ford gridiron battle tomorrow after
noon will be played under a clear sky.
The field, already wetted down by
the intermittent rains of the past few
days, will be in good playing condition
if the threatening storm holds off till
tomorrow evening.
Coach Andrew Kerr led his string
of twenty-seven stalwarts from the
golden state into this college town in
the Willamette valley this morning,
and had them don the moleskins for a
light work-out.
"Dad" Butler, veteran O. A. C.- train
er, last night pronounced every man
in good condition for the contest.
Neither Dick Rutherford, Beaver
coach, nor Kerr, in charge of the
Cardinals, has anything to say.
The teams will probably start as
follows:
Stanford Position Oregon Aggies
Mertz • LER Scott
Shipkey LTR Micklewait
Ludeke LGR Clark
DeGroot (c) C Rich
Cravens RGL Ash
Johnston RTL (a) Loeey
Dole or Lawson REL McFadden

Up in Oregon, the land of perpetual
rain, the first Kerr-made Stanford
varsity faces the fire tomorrow after
noon. None too good as far as reputa
tion goes, but with the advantage of
playing on familiar grounds, the Ore
gon Aggies are formidable enough to
put any eleven to the test.
Reprimand or no reprimand, reputa
tion or no reputation, experience or no
experience, the Cardinal squad left
Palo Alto Wednesday night determined
to clean up on the Beavers or dis
band. Not that they have shown any
thing so far to lead one to believe they
can. clean up on anybody. But they
have bectfme so thoroughly imbued
with the idea that they can beat any
Oregon Aggie team, that they feel
they can fly in the face of 100 to 1
odds and still turn the trick.
It's going to be a hard fight all the
way through tomorrow —harder still
for Stanford if it rains. Two Beaver
guards, Ash and Clarke, who weigh
over 200 pounds, are going to make a
lot of trouble for the center of Thorn
hill's line. Percy Locey, the Aggie cap
tain, plays left tackle. Rutherford's
ends, Scott and McFadden, are espe
cially strong on the aerial game.
Weight and speed are combined in
the Aggie backfield. Luke Gill, who
also does tricks with the basketball,
and Miller rely on off-tackle plays for
yardage. Tousey is the "plunging full
back" for Rutherford's cohorts. That
leaves Garber to do the thinking, run
interference, throw forward passes,
and drop-kick. They say that he boots
them over from all parts of the field.
Up bobs that reprimand affair again.
Corvallis is in the private dominion
of U. G. Duback, who as president of
the Conference, was largly responsible
for Stanford's reprimand. The O. A. C.
students themselves are none too
kindly disposed toward the Cardinals
who they claim beat the Conference
out of 30,000 round dollars. Naturally,
Kerr's men won't remember that repri
mand any too kindly, unless they are
awed by the presence of Duback him
self.
If the Cards once get their fighting
blood up, then they should arrive in a
hurry—unless fumbles on the wet field
take the heart out of them. The Beav
ers themselves are not credited with
having any too much of a punch with
in the shadows of the goal-posts. So
if Dud DeGroot and his associate bone
crushers in the line play real football
