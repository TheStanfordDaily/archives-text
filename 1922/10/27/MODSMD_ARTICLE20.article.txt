# IMPROVED FRESHMAN TEAM PLAYS FRESNO ON PRACTICE FIELD
## 
### 
Because of the freshman intelligence
test coining at noon tomorrow, the year
ling-Fresno Teachers' college game has
been set ahead until 2 o'clock, and
scheduled on the old varsity field instead
of the stadium.
Coach "Husky" Hunt was wearing a
brand new white sweat-shirt yesterday,
in honor of a freshman eleven that is
beginning to show signs of working to
gether.
Observers of the dinks' last two .scrim
mages, with the Goofs and their own
third squad, have noted a new spirit in
the team's offensive, a steady drive and
machine-like precision which shows that
they are doing something more than
merely "playing" football.
Which same is quite a change from
the group of eleven individuals lining
up in past games, wherein one or two
men in the backfield did all the work, and
that only erratically.
Some idea of the U. C. Pedagogues'
strength is shown in the fact that Loyola
college of Los Angeles, a team that held
the U.S.C. frosh to twelve points, was
able to put over only a two point on
Fresno, after the teachers had run the
ball to three yards of goal thrice in the
last half, losing on fumbles.
If Hunt's men get down to business
tomorrow, as they show every intention
of doing, Solomon, Faust, Nevers, and
the rest of the backs are going to have
some real support in their drives on the
goal line. If not, Hunt will have some
more to say to his squad, of the same
brand as last week.
The big lights on the varsity practice
field have been used for the past few
nights to illuminate the last five minutes
of scrimmage. The double line of flares
makes of football'practice a wierd thing
especially to the end who is trying to
catch a forward pass.
Every one is watching Marshall Boone,
the big tackle who started in the Ber
keley game last week. He has the
weight, build, and capability of a good
lineman, but so far Line Coach Post has
i been unable to get him working. He
; showed flashes of real ability Saturday,
i but made up for it by his habit of off
i siding.
"Solly" Solomon, who is a factor in j
| both Hunt's backfield systems, is getting;
; a double workout in the nightly scrim
mages, once with the heavyweights, and'
once with the speed combination.
The probable line-up for tomorrow, as;
it in his mind last night, is:!
McDermot and Fassoth or Stevenson, j
j ends, Goodrich and Sholes, tackles, Cam-i
i eron and Harville, guards, Hunt, center,
Faust and Solomon, halves; Mitchell, |
[quarter; and-Nevers, full.
