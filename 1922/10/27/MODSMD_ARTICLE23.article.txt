# "FIGHT AGAINST FIGHT"â€”ROUND ONE
## 
### 
The Executive Committee has gone to bat again.
After knocking the over-load of charity drives for
a circuit clout, the Committee now proposes to give
the umpire a run for his money on the Poster Fight.
The Social Service Hoard has gladdened the heart
of full many a student with a lean purse by adopting
in principle the recommendations of the Executive
Committee that a limit be placed on the plate-pass
ing. Jt is to be hoped that the various bodies on
whom the Committee has placed the responsibility
of saving the skin of the Poster Fight will make
as good a job of it as the Social Service Board has
done in its own sphere.
