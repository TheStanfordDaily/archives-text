# RALLY DEFINED
## 
### 
It was with true optimism that the Daily Palo
Alto started off this year with discussions concern
ing rallies. The editorial board hereby asks for
giveness for unjustly assuming that the student
body knows what a rally is. It is the purpose of
this editorial to define the term in order that future
readers may know what it's all about.
"To rally" has two meanings. First, it means
reunite, reanimate, revive, restore, or to call together
for any common purpose. Second, it means to at
tack with raillery, to joke, banter. It has been
quite evident that "rally" for the last year or so has
been construed to mean "joke." This is not a
jump at conclusions but is a statement based 011
circumstantial evidence. All the rallies held thus
far this year have been great successes as jokes.
"To attack with raillery" while "gathered for a
common purpose" is the sort of a compromise that
defeats the purposes of a rally. Stanford students,
instead of yelling with the yell-leader, have been
yelling AT him. They haven't given him a chance.
Now that the term rally has been defined, we wonder
if it would be possible for the student body to hold
one ? 0
