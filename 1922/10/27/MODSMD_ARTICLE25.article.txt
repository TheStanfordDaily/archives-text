# A 						CITY BACK OF A MILLION

### 
In endorsing Stanford's medical million project,
leaders of San Francisco's civic, business, and pro
fessional life, have in spirit assured the University
of success. And if in spirit the Stanford endow
ment has the backing of the personal machinery
that has made San Francisco what it is, the final re
sult cannot be anything but favorable. San Fran
cisco has at once seen the mutual advantages to be
gained from western medical supremacy —not the
achieving of the supremacy, but the maintenance
of it. The leaders in the city consider the expan
sion, as well as the normal growth, of the Stanford
Medical School essential to the well-being of San
Francisco and of California. There is no little satis
faction to be gained from such whole-hearted and
understanding support.
