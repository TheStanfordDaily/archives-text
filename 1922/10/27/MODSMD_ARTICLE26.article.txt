# SEQUOIA CLUB SPIRIT
## 
### 
Sequoia Club in arranging for play-by-play ser
vice of the Card-Aggie game lias shown itself to be
available as a key-stone of Stanford spirit. By
assessing themselves for the entertainment of the
student body as a whole in order that every Stan
ford supporter may keep in touch with the team, the
members of the Club show that they are willing to
do their part in keeping "the Cardinal waving." Al
though Sequoia will never receive financial return,
the members of the Club will find that their money
has not been mis-spent.
