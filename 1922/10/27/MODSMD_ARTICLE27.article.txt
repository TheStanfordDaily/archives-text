' H. M. '24
The famous miler wrs out training the hopeful begin
ner. In order that the h. b. should not be overtaxed it
was agreed that the miler should set the pace until the
hopeful beginner called "Stop."
Around the track they dashed. One lap; two . . .
seven. Finally the famous athlete could go no more.
Staggering to a bench, the 112. a. flopped. So did the
hopeful beginner.
"Why, man, you'll become famous. No one has ever
lasted so long the first time out. I was waiting every
minute to hear you yell 'Stop'."
"Puff! Puff! Whoosh! Yep-p, puff," gasped the begin
ner. "So was I, but after the first lap I didn't have the
wind!"

There seems to be a big turn-out for interclass foot
ball amongst most of the classes. But what we want to
know is, are the hangovers going to have a team, too?

First ex-soldier: Is the pen still mightier than the
sword?
Second X. S.: Well, my girl thought so when she

Baby: I want my bottle?
Mother: Hush, now. You're just like daddy!

Him: This prohibition beer is awful stuff.
Shim: Yes, I know. That's because it's boot-lager.

"Yes, some of- you fellows may think you have a

St. Vitus dance and the rheumatism."

No, Heloise, when your friend the Law Major speaks
of Trespass on the Case he doesn't refer to what you
think he does, and in fact I doubt if he drinks at all,

Sh-h h!
It was midnight—possible twelve o'clock. The air
was thick with intrigue and fog. Against a pale magenta
sky loomed a house entirely black —black as —well, black
as a blackboard, anyway. Not a light to be seen, unless
you count the electric lights. Leaving them out, the
house was entirely unilluminated, and, in fact, dark.
Now that we have that settled, we'll go on to a descrip
tion of our heroine. It being entirely dark, she was
invisible but obviously of a delicate sort of youthful
beauty. For she was climbing in the window of the
entirely black house. This was undoubtedly a burglary
or at least trespass on real property and possibly re
plevin or trover depending on whether you know your
Law 3a. Then there was a loud crash as another
dining room chair bit the dust; a blinding flash of
electric lights, and a sigh of relief. "Here's one lockoyt
I don't get," said our heroine modestly, and that was all
there was to it.
