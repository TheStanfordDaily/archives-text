# Juniors to Have Four-Page Section in Quad
## 
### 
Last year the Quad abandoned the
section containing the Junior pictures
and put pictures of the Senior Class
in its place. The Juniors were given a
special edition of the Quad in return
for their regular assessment of $7.
This idea will be developed further
in this year's edition. Instead of hav
ing only a one-page insert for the
Junior edition, there will be a complete
department of four or six pages added
to the book. The extra dollar which
the Juniors have to pay for the Quad
will go into this special section. It
has not yet been determined just what
the addition will contain.
On Monday a closing date will be
announced after which no Senior pic
tures may be taken. Although there
are still several months in which to
have the pictures taken, it is very ad
visable to have it done now, otherwise
the last-minute rush may crowd some
pictures out. Pictures are being taken
at the Franklin Studio in Palo Alto
at any time. Seniors who do not get
their pictures taken within the speci
fied time will not have their records
published, as it is very difficult to ar
range one properly without the other.
Group pictures will not be taken until
the winter quarter.
