## 
### (By United Press 
BERKELEY, Cal., Oct. 27. â€”Califor-
nia expects to beat U. S. C. by a mar
gin of four touchdowns in the game at
Pasadena Saturday.
That was the declaration of Charlie
Erb, California pilot, before the squad
numbering 31 players and six trainers,
coaches and managers, left last night
for Pasadena.
Erb said he did not expe.ct to run
into anything soft in the southland
but from the showing the Bears have
made thus far and because there is
not a poorly conditioned man making
the trip, he believed his team would
win by such a "margin.
