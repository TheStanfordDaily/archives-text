# NEW STUNT TO SAVE LIQUOR THROWN OVERBOARD
## 
### (By United Press 
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 27â€”Enter
the chemist-bootlegger. He doesn't
make synthetic gin either.
It is a new stunt that has been de
vised to save liquor thrown overboard
by rum runners when they are pursued
too closely.
The contraband is tied in sacks with
a quantity of rock salt and a number
of large corks. When the sack is
thrown overboard the weight of the
rock salt sinks it. By the time that
danger has passed, the salt has dis
solved sufficiently to allow the corks
to bring the liquor back to the sur
face.
