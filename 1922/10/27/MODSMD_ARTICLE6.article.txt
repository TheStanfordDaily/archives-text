# INITIAL PLAY OF YEAR INTRODUCES SIX NEW PLAYERS
## Director Bentinck Is Pleased With Rehearsals for Sword and Sandals Show Nov. 3 
### 
When the curtains of the Assembly
Hall stage are raised one week from to
night, "Her Husband's Wife," the current
Sword and Sandals production, will in
troduce to campus theater-goers a sex
tet of players who are comparatively new.
Two short weeks in which to learn lines,
master the technique of the stage, and
acquire that "perfectly at ease feeling"
which is so difficult to secure, is a most
exacting piece of work to accomplish.
But Director Bentinck and his half
dozen players will accomplish itâ€”at
least judging from present indications.
David Mannoccir, '24, playing the part
of "Uncle John" Belden has the heavy
role of the play. A rest of ten minutes
during the first act is all that he se
cures during the entire show. When
Mannoccir is not rehearsing or studying,
he is playing football; hence the manner
in which he has thrown himself into the
part in this short time is remarkable.
It is in Gertrude McLeod, '25, that the
audience will get the chief charm of the
play, for her interpretation of Irene
Randolph, sparkling and at the same
time sad, is all that it should be. Miss
McLeod has had only ballet and chorus
experience. To all indications, how
ever, she has acquired perfect ease.
Emily Wardman, playing Emily Ladew
has a chafing charactei. She is quite
sedate during the first act, but in the
second and third she is entirely different.
"Tex" Talbert, '22, as Richard Belden
probably has had the most experience of
anyone in the cast. Stuart Randolph,
Irene's husband as played by Arthur
Conover, is an interesting person. Though
Conover is only a "last year's," his idea
of a "drunk" as he illustrates it in the
play, is becoming a man of more ad
vanced academic standing. Norali, Irene's
sensible maid as played by Elsa Barber,
'24, is well interpreted.
