### Donald Liebendorfer, '24 
Coach Sommers' Mare Island Marines
played two quarters of football here Sat
urday and ran up twenty points, which
was plenty to beat the scoreless Grays.,
The sailors started out like a cyclone.
"1 he Grays received the kickoff on their
20-yard line, but could make no headway
through the line and were forced to kick.
The Marines took the ball in midfield
and began a steady march toward the
Gray's goal line, with Huffman, and
Chambers carrying the ball.
Grays Fumble
(_ hambers went over for the first score
when the game had been going three
minutes. Huffman failed to drop one
over for the extra point.
The Marines kicked off again and
Hamilton returned the ball twenty yards.
An end run netted seven yards, but on
the next play the Grays fumbled and the
Marines began another march. The
quarter ended with the ball in the Ma
rines' possession on the Grays' 5-yard
line.
All Scores in First Half
Chambers went over on the first play
in the second quarter and I luffman added
another point by dropping one over. The
Marines' last touchdown came when Huff
man ran forty yards through a broken
field in the middle of the second quarter.
The Grays made their yardage for the
first time as the half ended.
With the beginning of the second half
the Grays' defense stiffened. An end
run of thirty-five yards gave the Marines
first down on the Gray's 3-yard line.
At this point, the Grays held and took
the ball.
Betts' team lost its only chance to score
in this period on a fumble which the
sailors recovered on their own 15-yard
line.
In the final quarter, both teams played
listlessly and numerous substitutions
were made, every man on the Marine
squad going in.
Chambers and Huffman during the first
half tore the Grays' line to pieces and
gained at will. Williams at center for
the Grays showed up well on the defense
and Hamilton, Woodhead and Erhorn did
good work on the offense.
