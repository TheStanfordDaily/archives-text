# VARSITY TAKES MUD BATTLE; HUNT'S MEN ARE EASY WINNERS
## FRESHMEN GEE FOUR SCORES ON NORMAL 
### Phil Newill, '24 
THE FRESHMEN WON another
lightly-earned victory on the practice
field Saturday.
A demonstration of the St. Mary's shift
by 1< res 110 Normal failed to impress
Coach Hunt's Dinks, who went
down the field four times for a 27-3
score.
"Solly" Solomon, handy man in Hunt's
backfield, was elected captain before the
scrimmage started.
Normal s eleven was too easy for the
frosh. After the first five minutes, in
which Fresno maneuvered into position
for a place kick, aided by two 15-yard
penalties, the Dinks had everything their
own way. •
Scores Made on Line Bucks
T hey traveled the line-buck route for
all their points. As a result, better foot
ball was played than a week ago, when
Hunt's backfield joined the track team.
Hunt's attack opened at the beginning
of the second quarter, after Kasanjin's
kick had drawn first blood. The gun went
off with the ball five yards from the last
line, and in the new period Ernie Nevers
carried it over off right tackle, adding
another point 011 the kick.
Soon after a Fresno pass flew into the
air and came down into the arms of
Stevenson, freshman left end, 011 the 25-
yard line.
Nevers Is Star
This started the next parade. Nevers,
who was romping through the Peda
gogues' line for great slices of yardage,
made eleven through tackle, and Solomon
carried it over. Faust made his try and
wound up the freshman scoring for the
half.
I Bill Cook repeated his trick of drib
bling the ball on the turf as preliminary
to a long end run. He made twenty-five
yards this way in the third quarter,
■which the redoubtable Nevers converted
• into a goal a few plays later, by a charge
j off left tackle. He missed the kick, mak
ing the tally 20-3.
Faust, Solomon and Nevers bucked
I down the field for the final 27-3 score in
I the third quarter. Solomon made the
touchdown, and Faust kicked.
Second Team Nearly Scores
Hunt evidently told his men to run up
a comfortable score and then retire, for
; he sent in his entire second team, one
at a time, in the fourth stanza.
This substitute team nearly made an
other score. They began a march down
the field in the last minutes, which the
gun ended five yards from goal.
