# FIRST QUARTER SPURT WINS FOR CARDINAL
## 
### Garrett Elmore, '23 
THAT FIRST-QUARTER spurt,
which Stanford followers are begin
ning to expect as regularly as heat in
summer, carried the Card varsity to a
6-to-0 win over the Oregon Aggies on
the rain-soaked sawdust at Corvallis
Saturday.
A lonw touchdown, Rained by forcing
the play and the "breaks" in the first
twelve minutes, proved to be sufficient
after Kerr's men had turned back a
belated attack from their own 5-yard
line.
Poor kicking and bad judgment
lost Rutherford's farmers what
chance they had.
The victorius Cardinal gridmen,
accompanied by Andy Kerr, Train
er Denny, and Football Manager
Smith, arrived on the campus from
Corvallis this morning.
In the opening and closing minutes,
the game belonged to the Kerr-ites;
in the second and third quarters it was
a hammer-and-tong affair, with lots of
kicking.
The tide turned toward the Cards
when, with a yard to go, Garber called
for a fake punt formation Miller lost
12 yards and the ball went to Stan
ford. After two thrusts at the line,
Wilcox hurled the heavy pigskin 31
yards to Mertz. O. A. C. held on the
10-yard line, and a place kick went
wrong by a few inches.
An exchange of punts followed,
and McCart, on his own 9-yard
line, was so hurried that he kicked
outside on the 15-yard mark. Then
entered Cuddeback, the man in
Stanford's "hour of need." He
bucked 10 yards on holes opened
by DeGroot, Faville, and Ludeke;
Wilcox added 3, and Cuddeback
finished the job. Wilcox missed
the place kick.
As the fourth quarter opened. Miller,
Aggie halfback, skipped around Law
son's end for 30 yards, the longest, run
of the game. That put the Farmers
on the Cards' 10-yard line. Two bucks
made 5 yards. Then with a real dis
play of defensive strength, Kerr's men
: held Tousey for no gain. Garber called
| for a pass over tlie line, which was
! incomplete, and Wilcox kicked out of
1 danger from the 20-yard line.
Stanford came right back at the
Aggies. Shipkey recovered when
Garber fumbled Wilcox's punt, but
Scott saved the Aggies by inter
cepting a pass. A few minutes
later Wilcox and Cuddeback
pierced the O A. C. line for first
down, but Doughty, who had a
hard time getting started on the
wet field, fumbled. The game ended
with the Aggies passing, with little
success, on their own 35-yard line.
Faville played most of the game in
stead of Cravens, and Lawson started
for Dole at right end. Cleaveland made
good yardage when he replaced Cud
deback in the second and fourth quar
ters.
A magnavox installed in front
of Sequoia Hall reported the game
play-by-play to the crowd assem
bled on the lawn.

THAT FIRST-QUARTER spurt,
which Stanford followers are begin
ning to expect as regularly as heat in
summer, carried the Card varsity to a
6-to-0 win over the Oregon Aggies on
the rain-soaked sawdust at Corvallis
Saturday.
A lonw touchdown, Rained by forcing
the play and the "breaks" in the first
twelve minutes, proved to be sufficient
after Kerr's men had turned back a
belated attack from their own 5-yard
line.
Poor kicking and bad judgment
lost Rutherford's farmers what
chance they had.
The victorius Cardinal gridmen,
accompanied by Andy Kerr, Train
er Denny, and Football Manager
Smith, arrived on the campus from
Corvallis this morning.
In the opening and closing minutes,
the game belonged to the Kerr-ites;
in the second and third quarters it was
a hammer-and-tong affair, with lots of
kicking.
The tide turned toward the Cards
when, with a yard to go, Garber called
for a fake punt formation Miller lost
12 yards and the ball went to Stan
ford. After two thrusts at the line,
Wilcox hurled the heavy pigskin 31
yards to Mertz. O. A. C. held on the
10-yard line, and a place kick went
wrong by a few inches.
An exchange of punts followed,
and McCart, on his own 9-yard
line, was so hurried that he kicked
outside on the 15-yard mark. Then
entered Cuddeback, the man in
Stanford's "hour of need." He
bucked 10 yards on holes opened
by DeGroot, Faville, and Ludeke;
Wilcox added 3, and Cuddeback
finished the job. Wilcox missed
the place kick.
As the fourth quarter opened. Miller,
Aggie halfback, skipped around Law
son's end for 30 yards, the longest, run
of the game. That put the Farmers
on the Cards' 10-yard line. Two bucks
made 5 yards. Then with a real dis
play of defensive strength, Kerr's men
: held Tousey for no gain. Garber called
| for a pass over tlie line, which was
! incomplete, and Wilcox kicked out of
1 danger from the 20-yard line.
Stanford came right back at the
Aggies. Shipkey recovered when
Garber fumbled Wilcox's punt, but
Scott saved the Aggies by inter
cepting a pass. A few minutes
later Wilcox and Cuddeback
pierced the O A. C. line for first
down, but Doughty, who had a
hard time getting started on the
wet field, fumbled. The game ended
with the Aggies passing, with little
success, on their own 35-yard line.
Faville played most of the game in
stead of Cravens, and Lawson started
for Dole at right end. Cleaveland made
good yardage when he replaced Cud
deback in the second and fourth quar
ters.

of Sequoia Hall reported the game
