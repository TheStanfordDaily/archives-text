# DRIVES WITH A DRIVE
## 
### 
Before the new ruling" laid down by the Social
Service Board limiting charity campaigns on the
Campus, the ordinary student referred to every
solicitation as a "Palm Drive."' Students were con
stantly on their guard and every time some mission
ary pried a nickle out of their toy banks an agonized
cry went up. They had absolutely forgotten their
best bet. They were overlooking the pleasure of
giving.
There is little to be derived from too much indis
criminate giving. When giving becomes a duty, it
is a tax and a tribute. The idea is all wrong.
Under the new system on the Campus, students
may give what they like and it is probable that in
the aggregate they will give more. There is far
more of an incentive under present conditions to use
judgment and to do the whole thing justice than
there has been up to this time. Drives from now on
will have power back of them—they will be drives
with a drive.
KERR'S MEN ARRIVE
The Card Varsity of 1922 is here. Andy Kerr's
men may have caused some impatience on the part
of the more eager rooters, they may have been some
thing <>112 a disappintment to the more optimistic, but
all temporizing aside, they have arrived.
Stanford rooters, if they may be called such on
the strength of what they have given this season in
the way of vocal support, have no longer anv excuse
to sit back and be grumpy because they are backing a
losing team. They now have not only a potential
but an actual winner to support.
If it is a winning team that Stanford men want,
they have a very fair chance to get out this evening
and show that the figiit from now on is not to be a
one-sided affair. 1 112 the rally tonight is a fizzle, as the
rest of them this quarter have been, it will be a good
time for somebody to dynamite a few dead-heads.
J A CREW FOR THE BOAT
Stanford people have been talking about "getting
on the boat" for three years now and thus far the
stately ship has not loaded enough passengers to
embark for a two-minute ride. The chief trouble
is that everybody has been afraid to get aboard be
cause they don't trust the crew or because they think
there isn't any.
Tf the work Sequoia Club did last Saturday is not
indicative that they have the makings of a good
crew, then we might as well sell the boat. Several
people in the editorial department of the Daily Palo
Alto are going to be badly surprised if Sequoia
doesn't keep up the good work and show the
Campus what a real turnout is at the rally tonight.
CONTAGION OF TRADITION
1 Because the law majors have succeeded in making
the Law Steps sacred territory, other majors about
the University have come to the conclusion that the
steps closest to their main buildings were built for
the majors in that department and for them only.
The tradition of the Law Steps is becoming a con
tagious disease, and unless somebody comes to the
front with a cure, women, freshmen, professors and
visitors will have to tunnel to get onto the Quad.
Women can no longer get down the Econ Steps
without shouldering the roughs out of the way.
They cannot go down the Law Steps because they
get too much vocal support. Consequently, they
must come and go the long way around.
To make the Law Steps private property and to
keep it such is a lively, not too discommoding a tra
dition. But if it spreads to other fields, now is a
good time to stop it. Steps were made for other
purposes than foundations for tradition.

more of an incentive under present conditions to use
judgment and to do the whole thing justice than
there has been up to this time. Drives from now on
will have power back of them—they will be drives
with a drive.
KERR'S MEN ARRIVE
The Card Varsity of 1922 is here. Andy Kerr's
men may have caused some impatience on the part
of the more eager rooters, they may have been some
thing <>112 a disappintment to the more optimistic, but
all temporizing aside, they have arrived.
Stanford rooters, if they may be called such on
the strength of what they have given this season in
the way of vocal support, have no longer anv excuse
to sit back and be grumpy because they are backing a
losing team. They now have not only a potential
but an actual winner to support.
If it is a winning team that Stanford men want,
they have a very fair chance to get out this evening
and show that the figiit from now on is not to be a
one-sided affair. 1 112 the rally tonight is a fizzle, as the
rest of them this quarter have been, it will be a good
time for somebody to dynamite a few dead-heads.
J A CREW FOR THE BOAT
Stanford people have been talking about "getting
on the boat" for three years now and thus far the
stately ship has not loaded enough passengers to
embark for a two-minute ride. The chief trouble
is that everybody has been afraid to get aboard be
cause they don't trust the crew or because they think
there isn't any.
Tf the work Sequoia Club did last Saturday is not
indicative that they have the makings of a good
crew, then we might as well sell the boat. Several
people in the editorial department of the Daily Palo
Alto are going to be badly surprised if Sequoia
doesn't keep up the good work and show the
Campus what a real turnout is at the rally tonight.
CONTAGION OF TRADITION
1 Because the law majors have succeeded in making
the Law Steps sacred territory, other majors about
the University have come to the conclusion that the
steps closest to their main buildings were built for
the majors in that department and for them only.
The tradition of the Law Steps is becoming a con
tagious disease, and unless somebody comes to the
front with a cure, women, freshmen, professors and
visitors will have to tunnel to get onto the Quad.
Women can no longer get down the Econ Steps
without shouldering the roughs out of the way.
They cannot go down the Law Steps because they
get too much vocal support. Consequently, they
must come and go the long way around.
To make the Law Steps private property and to
keep it such is a lively, not too discommoding a tra
dition. But if it spreads to other fields, now is a
good time to stop it. Steps were made for other
purposes than foundations for tradition.
Before the new ruling" laid down by the Social
Service Board limiting charity campaigns on the
Campus, the ordinary student referred to every
solicitation as a "Palm Drive."' Students were con
stantly on their guard and every time some mission
ary pried a nickle out of their toy banks an agonized
cry went up. They had absolutely forgotten their
best bet. They were overlooking the pleasure of
giving.
There is little to be derived from too much indis
criminate giving. When giving becomes a duty, it
is a tax and a tribute. The idea is all wrong.
Under the new system on the Campus, students
may give what they like and it is probable that in
the aggregate they will give more. There is far
more of an incentive under present conditions to use
judgment and to do the whole thing justice than
there has been up to this time. Drives from now on
will have power back of them—they will be drives
with a drive.
