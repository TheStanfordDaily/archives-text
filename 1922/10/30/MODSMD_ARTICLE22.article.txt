# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M.'24

Each spring it is supposed that the fancy of the poet
turns to verse, and that of the lover, to worse. But
just to show up that old saw, Cabbages hereby produces
a whole column of \erse in the FALL.

Ode to California Team
(Written by a California supporter at any time before
the first California defeat.)
California, California,
Pride of the Western States (including Hawaii).
Fight, California! Gr-r-r R-r-r r-r-r! Ow!
Palms of victory,
Down on the Stanford Quad, Under the Red Sod,
Or in their Stadium will do just as well.
We'll knock the stuffin' out of Stanford.
Thanx to Brickmuller andy smith calif, spirit,
our wonder team berkey and the s. 112. papers!
GIVE 'EM THE AX. (Where?)
In the safe deposit vault.

Blow Away, California!
(Written after the first defeat of the Wonder Team by
Enterprising California Rooter)
Ow! Ow! Ow! Gr-r-r-r!
Getta new coach.
We wanna stadium!
Anyway, it was their home ground, they otta win.
The wind was against us.
And it was a MORAL Victory for us.
We wanna new coach!

I love to idle by the sea,
And spend the day in reverie,
And dream of glories yet to come —
And so does every other bum.

Suggestions to editor of California Daily for editorial
material:
Monday: Think up new names for Stanford men be
cause they insist on rights in regard to Conference.
Tuesday: Tell the loyal Californiaiis that Stadium is
* at last a reality, but be rather hazy as to site.
Wednesday: Run article on New-Found California
Spirit, illustrating by profound silence when opponents
were near Cal goal., "Aw, we hafta give their team a
chance, don't we?"
Thursday, Friday, ad infinitum: Repeat, with little
variation

The Poet Writes of Fall
Run is the course of summer,
Gone are the days of bliss,
Spent in the green of meadows,
Courting the zephyr's kiss.
Glorious tints of the autumn,
Flare now upon the trees.
Who cares that the cup of summer
v Is drained to the very lees?
The Gardener Writes of Fall
Say, what da heck! I no-a -ak
V
To see the fall-time come-a back!
The dam-a tree, shed all day,
Den I muss rake da leaf away.
•»
Da grass, he droops, an' finally dies,
An* then he muss be fertalize!
Ah. heck! I betta every one
Sure hate to see da summer done.
Each spring it is supposed that the fancy of the poet
turns to verse, and that of the lover, to worse. But

Reverie
I love to idle by the sea,
And spend the day in reverie,
And dream of glories yet to come —
And so does every other bum.

Suggestions to editor of California Daily for editorial
material:
Monday: Think up new names for Stanford men be
cause they insist on rights in regard to Conference.
Tuesday: Tell the loyal Californiaiis that Stadium is
* at last a reality, but be rather hazy as to site.
Wednesday: Run article on New-Found California
Spirit, illustrating by profound silence when opponents
were near Cal goal., "Aw, we hafta give their team a
chance, don't we?"
Thursday, Friday, ad infinitum: Repeat, with little
variation

The Poet Writes of Fall
Run is the course of summer,
Gone are the days of bliss,
Spent in the green of meadows,
Courting the zephyr's kiss.
Glorious tints of the autumn,
Flare now upon the trees.
Who cares that the cup of summer
v Is drained to the very lees?
The Gardener Writes of Fall
Say, what da heck! I no-a -ak
V
To see the fall-time come-a back!
The dam-a tree, shed all day,
Den I muss rake da leaf away.
•»
Da grass, he droops, an' finally dies,
An* then he muss be fertalize!
Ah. heck! I betta every one
Sure hate to see da summer done.
Each spring it is supposed that the fancy of the poet
turns to verse, and that of the lover, to worse. But
just to show up that old saw, Cabbages hereby produces
a whole column of \erse in the FALL.

Ode to California Team
(Written by a California supporter at any time before
the first California defeat.)
California, California,
Pride of the Western States (including Hawaii).
Fight, California! Gr-r-r R-r-r r-r-r! Ow!
Palms of victory,
Down on the Stanford Quad, Under the Red Sod,
Or in their Stadium will do just as well.
We'll knock the stuffin' out of Stanford.
Thanx to Brickmuller andy smith calif, spirit,
our wonder team berkey and the s. 112. papers!
GIVE 'EM THE AX. (Where?)
In the safe deposit vault.

Blow Away, California!
(Written after the first defeat of the Wonder Team by
Enterprising California Rooter)
Ow! Ow! Ow! Gr-r-r-r!

We wanna stadium!
Anyway, it was their home ground, they otta win.
The wind was against us.
And it was a MORAL Victory for us.
We wanna new coach!
