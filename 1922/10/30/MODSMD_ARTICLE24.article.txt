## EDICT AGAINST FOOTBALL "FUSSING" MADE AT COLORADO 
### 
No more "fussing" will be permitted
at the future football games of the Uni
versity of Colorado, according to an edict
issued by Marshal William Montgomery.
Strict enforcement of the new order will
be aided by the office of the Marshal and
the sophomore police department.
Heretofore the rule against dating co
eds for the football games applied only
to freshmen. From now on all men will
sit .together in one section of the grand
stand in an endeavor to get some organ
ized cheering.
"l'he new rule will give an opportunity
for all to give whole-hearted attention to
the yells instead of watching for the com
fort of a woman," says Marshal Mont
gomery.
