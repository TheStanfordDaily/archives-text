# Cross Country Runners Training for U.C. Meet On Morning of Big Game
## 
### 
Twenty-five candidates for the cross
country team are working out daily
under the supervision of Coach "Dink"
Templeton in preparation for the
California meet.
Interest in cross country has been at
a low ebb for the past few years and
Templeton hopes to put a team into
the field this year which will revive
the sport. Several men from last year's
squad are trotting around every day
shaking out the "kinks" and getting
back into shape.
A great deal of new material has
shown up. also. "Pat" Murphy, the
plucky little nailer who placed second
in the Stanford-California freshman
meet last year whe nhe had been reg
istered in school but a week, seems
to be one of the most promising of
the youngsters. Murphy will make the
best of them travel when he is in
condition.
"Dink" is trying to have the Cali
fornia-Stanford cross country meet
held on the Farm on the morning of
the Big Game day.
