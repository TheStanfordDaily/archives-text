# INTERCLASS TRACK MEETS DEVELOPING SPRING MATERIAL
## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton is sending his
track candidates through their third
week of fall practice and is holding an
interclass meet every Friday. Results
of the second meet held Friday showed
I promise and Coacli Templeton expects
! an improvement.
These meets, while "bush stuff" to
: the spectator, will form a very im
portant part of Templeton's program.
"Dink" believes that several men of
i great possibilities will be found in
jthe various contests, and he hesitates
l not at all to admit that he needs all
i the "possibilities" he can get. The
events scheduled are the 100-yard dash,
120-yard low hurdles, half-mile, high
and broad jump, and shot put. Regu
larly enrolled men will be expected to
enter two events, while Templeton
asks all new men who believe that
they have latent powers to turn out.
Meanwhile, quite an aggregation of
stars of the first and second magnitude
are twinkling before Templeton's eye.
He went over the list of men whose
abilities are known, briefly as follows:
"The men lost from last year were
Kirksey and Sudden in the sprints,
Davis in the hurdles, Scofield in the
880, Wilcox in the pole, Howell in the
high jump, and Hanner in the javelin.
"Glenn Hartranft looks like the best
sprinter this year. Along with him
are A1 Carrey and Bob Wright. Carrey
I should be good for 10.1. Lane Falk,
Orlo Hayes and "Swede" Leistner will
take care of us in the hurdles in fine
shape. Roy Williamson, whose mark
of 49 seconds flat looks mighty good,
will be back to defend us in the 440.
With him are Van Judah, who placed
third in the California meet. Thur
man Clarke, Phil Scofield and Ralph
Shermund. The latter will also be tried
out in the sprints.
"Charles Daly, who won the 880
against California last year in 1:59 3-5,
will be back. Dick Mcintosh, Elmer
Elliot, Allan Charles and Paul Murphy
are good men in the mile and two-mile.
A1 Smith will be the best 880-yard and
mile runner on the Coast this year. He
has never been extended yet. French
is back in the two-mile, always good
for points.
"The vaulters are Black and Dennis;
the high jumpers Urner, Robison, Rem
nitzer and Mint Howell if he returns.
Lou Minsky and Dick MacCrae are the
broad jumpers. In the shot and discus
we have Hartranft and Jim Arthur,
while the javelin throwers are Lynn
Farish, Tilden Riglietti, Tony EskeW,
Scotch Campbell, Harlow and Jim Kelly.
John Boone, a freshman from the
San Diego Army and Navy school,
has been putting the shot over 44
feet."

feet."
"Dink" Templeton is sending his
track candidates through their third
week of fall practice and is holding an
interclass meet every Friday. Results
of the second meet held Friday showed
I promise and Coacli Templeton expects
! an improvement.
These meets, while "bush stuff" to
: the spectator, will form a very im
portant part of Templeton's program.
"Dink" believes that several men of
i great possibilities will be found in
jthe various contests, and he hesitates
l not at all to admit that he needs all
i the "possibilities" he can get. The
events scheduled are the 100-yard dash,
120-yard low hurdles, half-mile, high
and broad jump, and shot put. Regu
larly enrolled men will be expected to
enter two events, while Templeton
asks all new men who believe that
they have latent powers to turn out.
Meanwhile, quite an aggregation of
stars of the first and second magnitude
are twinkling before Templeton's eye.
He went over the list of men whose
abilities are known, briefly as follows:
"The men lost from last year were
Kirksey and Sudden in the sprints,
Davis in the hurdles, Scofield in the
880, Wilcox in the pole, Howell in the
high jump, and Hanner in the javelin.
"Glenn Hartranft looks like the best
sprinter this year. Along with him
are A1 Carrey and Bob Wright. Carrey
I should be good for 10.1. Lane Falk,
Orlo Hayes and "Swede" Leistner will
take care of us in the hurdles in fine
shape. Roy Williamson, whose mark
of 49 seconds flat looks mighty good,
will be back to defend us in the 440.
With him are Van Judah, who placed
third in the California meet. Thur
man Clarke, Phil Scofield and Ralph
Shermund. The latter will also be tried
out in the sprints.
"Charles Daly, who won the 880
against California last year in 1:59 3-5,
will be back. Dick Mcintosh, Elmer
Elliot, Allan Charles and Paul Murphy
are good men in the mile and two-mile.
A1 Smith will be the best 880-yard and
mile runner on the Coast this year. He
has never been extended yet. French
is back in the two-mile, always good
for points.
"The vaulters are Black and Dennis;
the high jumpers Urner, Robison, Rem
nitzer and Mint Howell if he returns.
Lou Minsky and Dick MacCrae are the
broad jumpers. In the shot and discus
we have Hartranft and Jim Arthur,
while the javelin throwers are Lynn
Farish, Tilden Riglietti, Tony EskeW,
Scotch Campbell, Harlow and Jim Kelly.
John Boone, a freshman from the
San Diego Army and Navy school,
