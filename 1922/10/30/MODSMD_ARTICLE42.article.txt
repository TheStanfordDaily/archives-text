"Organize your several publications
into one combination rate," said Edwin
W. St. George at a meeting of the Stan
ford Ad Club last Thursday night.
Mr. St. George, who is the advertising
manager of Roos Brothers, was educated
in England and then came to America
for graduate work at Harvard. He has
managed and owned college publications
so that lie can appreciate the college
man's viewpoint as a space salesman.
"Conditions arc different in England.
There is no advertising to help finance
the journals. They depend upon the
subscription price, or arc endowed or
underwritten," lie said.
"And now I'm going to tell you how
you can make your most money," said
St. George. "Let one man sell space
in all the publications on the basis of a
combination rate. In one transaction a
merchant is enabled to bid for Stanford's
trade by being completely represented in
every publication. It is simple and it
will work," he concluded.
