# DON'T BE DRAMATIC CRITIC UNLESS YOU LOVE STAGE-WARREN

Love of the theater is a prime requisite
for success in dramatic criticism, in the
opinion of George C. Warren, dramatic
editor of the San Francisco Chronicle,
who spoke at the first meeting of the
American Journalists' Association Friday
aiight.
In an informal discussion, Mr. Warren
(set forth a few rules for the aspiring
critic to follow and explained the inti-
workings of his department. The
best preparation for theatrical reviewing
is a thorough knowledge of plays, from
Greek tragedies to the latest modern pro
ductions, he believes. If possible, it is
well to be acquainted with the plot be
fore seeing a play presented.
"Unless one has a boundless enthusi
asm for the drama, the business of re
viewing becomes an intolerable burden,"
Mr. Warren said. "Above all things,
criticism must be just and kindly. One
should not appraise an amateur play from
the standpoint of a professional pro
duction."
