when he navigated the distance in the
fast time of 3 minutes and 11 seconds.
Two of the watches caught him at
3:10:3 but the slowest time had to be
taken.

of Salvador of the Pacific City Swim
ming Club. The Cardinal star got away
to a good start and in two lengths of
the tank had gained a lead of twenty
feet over the other competitors.
If Fletcher had been given some stiff
competition Brandsten thinks he would
more than likely have broken the
Coast record of 3:9 for the race.
The excitement of the event was
caused by the close contest between
Eric Kraemer of Stanford and Salvador
of the Pacific City Club for second
place. The two swam neck-and-neck
practicall the entire distance

onstration of fancy diving since col
lege opened. The national champion
did considerable diving during 'the
summer.
