Would You Run on a
Flat Tire?
Suppose your front tire
went flat ten miles from
home.
You would not bang and bump
along after you knew that every
turn of the wheel was tearing
the life out of the casing.
Why not be as reasonable
about your battery?
The penalty for mistreating
a battery is just as sure as for
abusing a tire. The care is just
as easy.
Drive into our Service Station
and let us tell you just how
easv it is.
