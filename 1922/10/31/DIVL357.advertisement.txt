Are YOU SHORT
of MONEY ?
Read what Guy Harris says
about making money selling
Simpson Tailor-made clothes:
"I worked my way through
school selling Simpson suits and
overcoat^.
' Last spring I found myself in
a position of being compelled to
earn extra money to pay my ex
penses or leave school. Through
the employment manager at
school I learned of J. B. Simpson,
Inc., and succeeded in making a
connection with them. Although
I had never in my life before sold
a suit or overcoat, I have earned
an average of $37.00 per week by
using my spare time to take or
ders for Simpson suits and over
coats.
"I did not depend only on the
college students, but each after
noon 1 went out and called on
from ten to thirty men. As
Simpson values are exceptionally
good and I could save the men
from $10.00 to $20.00 on every
suit or overcoat I nearly always
succeeded in getting from one to
live orders a day. The opportun
ity to do this work was a God
send to me and I can think of no
better way to meet expenses
than by getting the agency for
Simpson clothes. The firm is
100 per cent on the level —a big,
reliable, honest institution, and
I cannot speafc too highly of
them. This season I will do even
better as I have several hundred
satisfied customers whom I can
resell." GUY C. HARRIS.

of making money you can find
