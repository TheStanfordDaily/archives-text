FOOTBALL
«C HOW TO WATCH IT
Seeing
vs.
Understanding
Can you see everything that
goes on in a football game?
No — but you can understand
everything by reading Percy
Haughton's new book, addressed
to the 5,000,000 people in the
stands.
The strategy which makes
modern football a contest of brains
and speed is intelligible if you know
the principles of the game.
Haughton's book contains 30
full pages of sharp, clear pictures
of plays in actual games, snapped
at the exact moment designated
by the author.
A full page description faces
each picture, and all important
piays are analyzed.
Your full enjoyment of football
depends upon your knowledge of
the game. Here is a book written
specifically for you, for the girl
who accompanies you, and for the
school boy in whom you are in
terested.
