# RETURNING SQUAD RECEIVES OVATION AT EVENING RALLY
## Victorious Gridders Greeted By Torchlight Procession; Capt. Dud DeGroot Talks 
### 
More than five hundred students
gathered at the Union last night to ex
press their approval of the results of
the northern trip to the varsity eleven.
Three lines left from different parts
of the campus at 6:30. Assistant Yell
Leader A1 Huneke started the first
from the Sigma Nu house and pro
ceeded down the Row. Sequoia marched
in a body under the direction of Burt
Lapp and Encina arrived last.
Yell Leader Lou Minsky had a steam
roller out for the occasion. "Steve,"
who manipulated the roller, had it
parked across the street in front of
the Union. On the sides of the ma
chine were signs enumerating the vic
tims of the Cardinal eleven and con
signing the Gold and Blue to the
warmer regions.
At 6:45, the different lines had ar
rived and Minsky led the mob in songs
and yells until the team appeared in
front of the Union at 7 o'clock. The ap
pearance of the varsity was a signal
for a demonstration which lasted for
several minutes before Minsky could
make himself heard.
Dud DeGroot, captain and center of
the 1922 varsity, was introduced and
when he appeared on the platform at
the side of the steam roller he was
given an enthusiastic welcome, so en
thusiastic, in fact, that he could not
make himself heard for ten minutes.
DeGroot's talk was short. "I am
sorry that every one of you could not
have been present at that game last
Saturday," he said. "If you had been
there you would have seen a team
representing Stanford of which you
could have been justly proud." For the
benefit of those who wondered why the
varsity appeared for practice tonight
in baseball pants, Dud said that some
one had stolen all the football pants
from the train on the trip back from
Corvallis.
