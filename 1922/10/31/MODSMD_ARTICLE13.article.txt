# Theatre Workshop Class Plays Are Progressing
## 
### 
Two one-act plays are to be staged
by Coach Bentinck's Theatrical Work
shop Class, about December twentieth.
The producers, who are to select
the plays, are Harold Minsky and Vir
ginia Henderson, assisted by David
Damson and Aaron Cohan. They will
also select designers for sets and cos
tumes, actors, electricians, and stage
managers. Work on the play will start
November fifteenth.
One play that is being seriously con
sidered is Lord Dunsany's "The
Queen's Enemies." The other will
be written by one of the students.
Several students are now writing
plays.
