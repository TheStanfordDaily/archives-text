# SECOND SALE OF ROOTERSâ€™ SEATS SET FOR TOMORROW
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the Big Game will
be on sale for the last time tomorrow
afternoon from 1 to 5:45 in the Student
Body Office in the Administration build
ing. They will sell for $1.50.
Last Wednesday, 1528 tickets to the
men's rooting section and 391 to the
women's section were sold. Yell Leader
Lou Minsky is not satisfied with the total
amount of rooters' tickets which were
sold and because of a misunderstanding
which arose in the Graduate Manager's
office, is was decided to hold a second
sale tomorrow.
Student applications for seats outside
the rooting section will be filled in the
order of their receipt, but will not be con

sidered after November 11. A student
may apply for reservations whether he
buys a rooter's ticket or not.
The Graduate Manager's office has an
nounced that a great many applications
have been received already from students,
alumni and outsiders. All $3 seats which
were allotted to Stanford have been re-<
served and many of the more expensive
scats are gone.
Public sale of tickets will begin No
vember 15 at Spaulding's and Ellcry
Arms in San Francisco, the White House
in San Jose, and Widaman's in Palo Alto.
Tickets for the Stanford-U. S. C. game
November 11 went on sale yesterday at'
the above places.
