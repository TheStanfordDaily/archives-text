## 
### 
A bleacher rally to send off the
freshman eleven on its first hard con
test of the season, the game with the
U. S. C. Babes in Los Angeles Satur
day, has been announced by Yell
Leader Lou Minsky for Thursday at
4 p. m. in the stadium.
Stanford songs and yells, and spe
cial bleacher stunts will be learned.
The freshmen will have a workout on
the stadium turf.
Coach Hunt believes that the lack
of active support for the freshmen
team is a big handicap in all their
games. "Nobody wants to fight for a
game when there is an attitude of in
difference in the bleachers," he said.
"The men will go in and play football,
but they have no incentive to fight."
"This casual, indifferent attitude is
carried through by the freshman play
er when he goes up to the varsity. It
is not the kind of spirit that should
be fostered in any Stanford team."
