# BETTS’ GRAYS WORK ON DEFENSIVE FOR SATURDAY’S GAME
## 
### 
If the Grays are downhearted over
their 20-0 defeat by the Marines last
Saturday, they disguised it well in last
night's practice session. Bctts' men dis
covered that they have a defensive which
is not to be sneezed at, and are out with
the determination to develop an offensive
to go with it.
Light workout, including signal prac
tice, skull practice, and a talk by Coach
Betts, was the extent of their work last
night. On the defensive, the Grays have
held their own with any team they have
played, but they have appeared woefully
weak on the offensive.
Betts' team came out of Saturday's
fracas without any injuries. Not a man
is on the crippled list at present, and with
four workouts this week the team should
be in fine shape for next Saturday's
game with the Agnetian Club. Little is
known of the club team, but Betts is
taking no chances and is getting his squad
into the best possible shape.
The Grays' "big game" of the season
will be played against the California
Goofs at Berkeley November 11 as the
preliminary to the Stanford-California
freshman game.
