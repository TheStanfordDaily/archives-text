# IN APPRECIATION
## 
### 
The members of the Varsity
squad wish to express heartiest ap
preciation and thanks for the many
telegrams of encouragement which
were received just before the game
last Saturday at Corvallis.
With the odds against us, the
field drenched, the sky still weep
ing great gobs of water, and the
fact that we faced not only eleven
O. A. C. men on the gridiron, but
7000 other raving maniacs in the
grandstands, you may be sure that
so many messages containing the
essence of the old Stanford spirit
and fight went a long way toward
putting across a victory for the
Cardinal.
With that kind of spirit manifest
ing itself, every member of the stu
dent body may rest assured that
each and every member of the
varsity squad is going to give all he
possesses for victory and for Stan
ford in the remaining games of the
season.
