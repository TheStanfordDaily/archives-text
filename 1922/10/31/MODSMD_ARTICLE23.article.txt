# CRABBING AT THE CRITIC
## 
### 
It is a current impression that critics take joy in
pointing out defects in dramatics, athletics, and
everything else that is subject to gradations of
quality. Many people think that critics sit in their
offices gloating over the hot comments they are in
tending to publish the following day. That critics
thrive and fatten on twisted and unjust slants and
on misstatement of facts has become a popular
superstition.
It is strange that nobody but a critic ever thought
that to comment adversely on something that is near
and dear to him is the hardest thing in the world to
<10. No Stanford critic is ever happy in saying in
print that something is wrong with any part of Stan
ford or her affairs. The easiest thing in the world
for an editor or a signed writer to do is to say com
plimentary things about people. Every one is at
once in a warm glow because his abilities have been
recognized. He at once forgets all the little details
of his defects. Here is where the critic comes in.
lie points out mistakes, not because to do so gives
him satisfaction, but because he doesn't want them
to occur again. lie gives credit where credit is due
and criticizes where something is wrong. And he
does all this NOT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO,
but because it is best for the subject of his comment
in the long run.
