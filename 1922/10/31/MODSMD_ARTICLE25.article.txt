# SEVEN-DAY SEED
## 
### 
There was planted in the Stanford rally garden
seven days a seed and the name of this seed was
"Spirit."
On the first day the planters of the seed came to
look upon it and it was dormant.
On the second day the planters did go forth and
behold, conditions were bum.
On the third day, with great impatience, the
planters of the seed did shed tears because nothing
sprang therefrom.
On the fourth day, amid groans, the planters went
unto the garden but found the seed in dry soil.
On the fifth day, amid squeaking of hearse's
wheels, an assembly of mourners did weep over the
dormant seed and go home in melancholy.
On the sixth day, a tombstone was erected over
the seed for, 10, the saline irrigation was of no avail.
But it came to pass that on the seventh day that
the seed didst sprout and didst knock the tombstone
for a loop ; and when the planters of the seed did go
to the rally garden they found that it was well; for
the seed didst branch forth and loud were the cheers
of the multitude.
Wherefore, brethren, be not sad of heart, for the
seed hath taken root and will bear fruit in good
time; but praise ye the name of Stanford, for the
soil in her garden is fertile and the crops therefrom
shall feed the many.
Oh Min!
