Stanford has started! That victory
over the "Fighting Aggies," accom
plished on a wet field, after a journey
of almost 700 miles, shows that Kerr's
eleven is coming strong. The defensive
strength has always been taken more
or less for granted, but at Corvallis
they showed a formidable offensive.
For one thing Wilcox and Cuddeback
were hitting the line for substantial
gains. Then along came Cleaveland
and ripped through for seven and eight
yards at a shot.
Without Art Wilcox, DeGroot and
his men would have had to work
harder for the victory. He out
kicked both McCart and Gill al
most ten yards, carried the ball
often, and otherwise made himself
useful. And without DeGroot, there
is no telling what would have
happened. Many of Stanford's
plays went through the center of
the line.
There was a peculiar mix-up over
that 30-yard run of Miller's, according
to Kerr. Pheney rushed on the field
just as the fourth quarter began, and
the umpire blew the whistle. That put
the Cards off their guard, and in the
confusion the Aggie halfback got away
for his run.
Both Kerr's tackles were right
on the job when it came to re
1 covering fumbles. At the end of
the second quarter, McCart kicked
straight up in the air on an on
side kick, and Johnson recovered.
Then in the final 'period Shipkey
rushed down and recovered when
Garber fumbled Wilcox's punt.
It took the grays two quarters to
discover they could hold the Marines
in the affair Saturday. With the be
ginning of the second half, however,
their defense stiffened and they looked
like a new team. Once in the third
[ quarter they held the sea soldiers for
downs on their three-yard line. Wil
liams at center was everywhere at once
stopping up plays.
Hamilton, Gray halfback, ran
back punts and kick-offs for good
gains. He made most of the Grays'
yardage through the Marine line.
Erhorn, his running mate, also
showed to advantage.
i Coach "Husky" Hunt tried a new
! combination with his two backfields
against the Pedagogues Saturday. He
; started little Bill Cook at full and
; shifted Ernie Nevers to half, with
Captain Solomon on the other wing
and Mitchell calling signals. The ex
periment apparently worked, for
j Cook's lightning speed gained the
Dinks lots of yards on run-back punts,
and Nevei* had a chance to spread
! himself at half.
Hunt's warriors lost fifteen yards
on a freak penalty rarely imposed
in the modern game. A Fresno
man caught a punt and signalled
for a fair kick, but an enthusiastic
Babe tackled and threw him to
I the ground. The penalty was for
throwing the player to the ground.
Thanks to previous training with the
Goofs, the freshmen were well pre
: pared for the Notre Dame shift which
! was Fresno's only line formation. Af
! ter the first few minutes they were
able to penetrate the double-like plays
easily, and once moved the scrimmage
line back twenty yards on two downs.
If there were any scouts from
the U. S. C. freshman team, play
ing up at Berkeley, watching the
Stanford frosh Saturday, they
must have carried away consider
able to worry about in regard to
next Saturday's game at Los
Angeles. For one thing, the per
formance of the substitute team
in nearly running across another
touchdown would give the South
ern California coach an intimation
of the strength of Hunt's reserves.

able to penetrate the double-like plays
easily, and once moved the scrimmage
line back twenty yards on two downs.
If there were any scouts from
the U. S. C. freshman team, play
ing up at Berkeley, watching the
Stanford frosh Saturday, they
must have carried away consider
able to worry about in regard to
next Saturday's game at Los
Angeles. For one thing, the per
formance of the substitute team
in nearly running across another
touchdown would give the South
ern California coach an intimation
of the strength of Hunt's reserves.
Stanford has started! That victory
over the "Fighting Aggies," accom
plished on a wet field, after a journey
of almost 700 miles, shows that Kerr's
eleven is coming strong. The defensive
strength has always been taken more
or less for granted, but at Corvallis
they showed a formidable offensive.
For one thing Wilcox and Cuddeback
were hitting the line for substantial
gains. Then along came Cleaveland
and ripped through for seven and eight
yards at a shot.
Without Art Wilcox, DeGroot and
his men would have had to work
harder for the victory. He out
kicked both McCart and Gill al
most ten yards, carried the ball
often, and otherwise made himself
useful. And without DeGroot, there
is no telling what would have
happened. Many of Stanford's
plays went through the center of
the line.
There was a peculiar mix-up over
that 30-yard run of Miller's, according
to Kerr. Pheney rushed on the field
just as the fourth quarter began, and
the umpire blew the whistle. That put
the Cards off their guard, and in the
confusion the Aggie halfback got away
for his run.
Both Kerr's tackles were right
on the job when it came to re
1 covering fumbles. At the end of
the second quarter, McCart kicked
straight up in the air on an on
side kick, and Johnson recovered.
Then in the final 'period Shipkey
rushed down and recovered when
Garber fumbled Wilcox's punt.
It took the grays two quarters to
discover they could hold the Marines
in the affair Saturday. With the be
ginning of the second half, however,
their defense stiffened and they looked
like a new team. Once in the third
[ quarter they held the sea soldiers for
downs on their three-yard line. Wil
liams at center was everywhere at once
stopping up plays.
Hamilton, Gray halfback, ran
back punts and kick-offs for good
gains. He made most of the Grays'
yardage through the Marine line.
Erhorn, his running mate, also
showed to advantage.
i Coach "Husky" Hunt tried a new
! combination with his two backfields
against the Pedagogues Saturday. He
; started little Bill Cook at full and
; shifted Ernie Nevers to half, with
Captain Solomon on the other wing
and Mitchell calling signals. The ex
periment apparently worked, for
j Cook's lightning speed gained the
Dinks lots of yards on run-back punts,
and Nevei* had a chance to spread
! himself at half.
Hunt's warriors lost fifteen yards
on a freak penalty rarely imposed
in the modern game. A Fresno
man caught a punt and signalled
for a fair kick, but an enthusiastic
Babe tackled and threw him to
I the ground. The penalty was for
throwing the player to the ground.
Thanks to previous training with the
Goofs, the freshmen were well pre
: pared for the Notre Dame shift which
! was Fresno's only line formation. Af
! ter the first few minutes they were
able to penetrate the double-like plays
easily, and once moved the scrimmage
line back twenty yards on two downs.
