# Geology Club Members To Hold Smoker on Thursday
## 
### 
Geology Club members will hold a
smoker in the Old Union at 7:30 p.m., at
which a rather novel form of entertain
ment will be afforded. Members of the

Gym team will put on an exhibition of
gymnastic stunts, which, although funda
mentally the same as all gymnasium ex
hibitions, will differ in their manner of
presentation. The act will assume a
vaudeville nature in order to differ from
the customary performance.
