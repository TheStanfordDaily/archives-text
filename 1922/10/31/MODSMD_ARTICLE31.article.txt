# MIDGLEY ORGANIZES THEATRE ORCHESTRA
## 
### 
Charles Midgley, '23, is organizing and
directing a Theater Orchestra which will
give the programs during the intermis
sions of dramatic productions and play
the scores of the musical shows. The
orchestra will play for the first time for
"Her Husband's Wife," November 3.
Midgley is attempting to form an Or
chestra Club that will meet every week
to practice and build up a large repertoire.
At present this is thejanly campus group
that plays classical music for entertain
ments.
As soon as Midgley can get a club
charter he will hold tryouts, but he needs
a good flute player now and requests .any
one who is capable of playing to see him
at once.
