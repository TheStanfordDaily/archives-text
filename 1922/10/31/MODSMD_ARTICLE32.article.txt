# DRAMATIC SEASON WILL OPEN WITH DISTINCTIVE PLAY
## 
### 
After rehearsing steadily day by day
and making good use of every available
moment, Director Bentinck and his half
dozen players are gradually bringing
"Her Husband's Wife" to perfection.
When the plush curtains on the Assembly
Hall stage are drawn next Friday night,
a distinctive production, considered from
several angles, will be presented.
"Her Husband's Wife" does not make
farce out of its humor and situations. It
is too refined and as one critic puts it,
"the comedy closely approaches a finely
drawn work of art." Each part re
quires delicate handling rather than the
broad gesture of the farceur.
This Sword and Sandals production
will open this year year's dramatic sea
son at Stanford and will be the first pro
duced under the directorship of R. C.
Bentinck. Bentinck is different from
most dramatic coaches in that he believes
sympathy and understanding are the best
incentives for work among stage players.
"They are doing the best they can," he is
fond of asserting.
The personnel of the cast is also to be
noted, for four of the players are new
in the Stanford dramatic field, while the
remaining two have had little previous
experience. Bentinck does not believe
so much in "stars." Amateurs on several
occasions have really turned out to be
the "finds," he says.
Irene Randolph is sweet and winsome,
and Bentinck thinks that the personality
which Gertude McLeod, '25, possesses,
fits the character to perfection. The
gowns which Miss McLeod will wear
have been specially selected from the
latest creation to conform with the at
mosphere of the settings. David Man
noccir, '24, cast as John Belden, Irene's
sympathetic and understanding uncle, has
the heaviest role in the play.
A surprise is furnished by transforma
tion in manner and appearance as effected
by Emily Wardman, '22, in her portrayal
of Emily Ladew, an unfortunate in a
past love episode. She is sedate and prim
in the first act, but when she "comes
back," it is a different matter.
"Tex" Talbert, '22; Arthur Conover,
'25, and Elsa Barber, '25, round off the
cast.
Parallel with the progress made in
drilling the players, is the completion of
the stage set. Bizarre and futuristic to 1
the n-th degree, it is intended that it
will give additional "atmosphere" to the
modern tone of the play. Symmetrical
blotches of bright orange and blue
spotted on drapes, peculiar birds and vines
as wall decorations, and a three-level
stage are novel features.
Lighting effects are one of the most
important requisites for a good produc
tion, according to Bentinck. Consequent
ly, he and Stoddard Atwood, '22, stage
electrician, have co-operated in producing
a number of effects which will accentuate
the changing tones in the plot. Six minia
ture domes, each reflecting 1000-candle
power electric lights, placed at vantage
points invisible to the audience, form the
method of indirect lighting.
