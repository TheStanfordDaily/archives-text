### (By United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 31.—(United
Press). —Frank Molina, held under guard
at the City and County Hospital charged
with attacking Joseph McGili, with a
butcher knife after overtaking him in a
thrilling wheel chair race through hos
pital corridors here, may not recover from
the excitement of his battle, physicians
reported today.
McGili is at another hospital, stabbed
through the shoulder.
Molina, unhurt in the battle, collapsed
from his exertions, which came while
convalescing from serious illness.
McGili and Molina were in wheel
chairs at a private hospital late yesterday,
when Molina is said to have asked McGili
for a cigarette. McGili answered hotly
and a quarrel followed.
Finally, according to hospital reports,
Molina picked up a knife while McGili
fled down the corridors in his wheel chair,
Molina in hot pursuit.
Molina overtook McGili at the end of
the corridor and is alleged to have
stabbed him before hospital attendants
could intervene.
