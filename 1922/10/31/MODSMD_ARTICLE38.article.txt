# WAR ON COLLEGE BETTING TO BE WAGED AT MINNESOTA
## 
### 
War to a finish against betting on
college athletic games has been in
stituted by John L. Griffith, Commis
sioner of Athletics of middle-west
colleges, according to word from the
Minnesota University.
Griffith plans to gain the support of
civic and university authorities and
the pledge of pool hall proprietors and
others to discourage betting pools.
Betting may force the abolition of
college games if it continues with the
growth of sports, Griffith claims. He
also assterts that the men are not
usually fretting their own money and,
in betting large sums, often lose sight
of the sportsmanlike ideal.
