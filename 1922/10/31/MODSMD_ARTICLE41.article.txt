S. I. Kumana, '99, who secured his
A. M. degree in entomology at Stanford
in '01, lias sent the Library, from Japan,
a pamphlet describing his recent experi
mental research on the history of a new
white fly.

Kumana is the chief of the Imperial
Plant Quarantine Station at Yokohama,
Japan. The paper is a reprint from the
Journal of Plant Protection in the Japa
nese language, and it contains a transla

tion of the description of the fly which is
found on the leaves of cultivated mul
berry trees. It was first discovered by
Murato in 1920. and Kuwana studied its
habits.
