# SECRET PRACTICE FOR THE DAYS IS COACH’S PLAN
## Game With Nevada on Saturday Calls for Intense Work By Kerr’s Varsity Cohorts 
### 
Stanford's gang of gridmcn, off to a
good start in the championship race, ar
rived home yesterday and started in to
work for the Nevada game next Satur
day. Kerr had his men out on the prac
tice field limbering up and going through
a light practice.
One of the first things Kerr did was
to order secret practice for Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday, and from now
on closed gates are apt to be the rule
rather than the exception.
Those who witnessed that history
making mud battle at Corvallis agree
with Kerr that the Card warriors de
serve more credit than a 6 to 0 victory
indicates. Only once did the Aggies
really threaten; the rest of the game
they were busy kicking out of danger or
warding off Stanford's attacks. That
attempted field goal by Cuddeback was
so close that many of the spectators
thought it had gone over. Wilcox's kick
in the try-for-a-point, a few minutes
later, also missed by a few inches.
"From tackle to tackle our line played
excellent football," said Kerr. "Our
ends, too, came through in fine shape, es
pecially on the defensive. In fact, the
boys .all did so well that it is hard to
pick any one from the rest."
There is no telling how badly the Cards
would have beaten the Aggies had there
been a dry field. The game was hard
fought, but fumbles, caused by the wet
ball, kept Stanford's score down. In the
third quarter Cuddeback had pushed
through the line for a first down and
then went through center for eight yards,
only to have the ball slide out of his
hands when he was tackled. Again in
the final period the Cards were headed
for a touchdown, but the slippery ball
got away from Doughty.
Dispatches from Corvallis carried the
wrong report in some places, so that sev
eral corrections are due. Faville relieved
Cravens at left guard in the first quar
ter. but Cravens came back and played
in the last half. Ludeke had his shoulder
bruised, and Faville stepped in on the
other side of the line. Pheney took
Cravens' place in the fotfrth quarter.
Thomas went in for Mertz near the end
of the game, and Hartranft relieved
Lawson. Miller on his long run went
around the left end of Stanford's line
instead of the right side.
side.
