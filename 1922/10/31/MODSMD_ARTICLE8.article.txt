## 
### 
Members of the American Legion Post
of Palo Alto will be addressed by John
Sinclair, personal representative of the
State Commander and San Francisco at
torney, at their meeting in the Palo Alto
Community House Thursday evening at
8 o'clock. Sinclair will be here for the
evening only, his visit being an official
one at the request of the State Com
mander,
It is hoped that Legion members will
attend the meeting. Post Commander
George H. Whistler states that the at
tendance at the first meetings of the
Legion this fall has been small and that
out of the 250 notices sent out to Legion
mefabcrs by Adjutant J. J. Broz only
fifteen were effective in securing at
tendance.
Meetings arc held the first and third
Thursdays of each month at the Palo
Alto Community House at present. Un
less the attendance increases meetings will
have to be limited to one a month, or
possibly less, and speakers who are on
the coming programs will not be asked to
appear. The question of the desirability
of continuing the meetings twice monthly
wil be taken up at the next session.
