Crier will be out with his cowbell at
Encina Thursday night. All those lucky
enough to possess 30 cents or less will
have an opportunity to add greatly to
their worldly belongings, for Encina Club
will throw an auction. Pennants, books,
lamps, desks, carpets, bottles, rags and
bones will go to the highest bidder at this
heart-breaking sale. Ten years' accumu
lation of battered and hroken furnishings
have lately been unearthed, and for senti
mental reasons will be offered to anyone
with enough money or nerve to bid on
them. Auction begins early. Come one;
come all; and get your money's worth!
