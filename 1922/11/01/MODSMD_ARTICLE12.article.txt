# SENIORS HAVE HEAVY INTERCLASS ELEVEN
## Two Squads Average Better Than 180 Pounds; 38 Experienced Men Turn Out 
### 
As activity in inter-class football
speeds up under fast-forming organ
ization, it is evident that Glenn Pol
lard's Seniors are going to cut a big
figure in the final reckoning—that is,
if weight counts toward bigness. Pol
lard estimates that his squad will
average better than ISO pounds, with
the line from tackle to tackle tilting
the scales at 185 pounds.
Pollard has 38 men out for regular
practice. He has divided these candi
dates into three squads, of which the
first two average ISO pounds or better.
The Senior advantage in this respect
is realized more clearly when one con
siders tVe fact that the frosh squad
averages but 145 pounds. Thirty-five
pounds help quite a bit at times.
A greater number of candidates for
the Senior team have had football
experience somewhere, either in high
school or on the second varsity at
Stanford in previous years. With this
knowledge of football, together with
the weight, it seems evident right now
that the Seniors will be a hard eleven
to defeat.
No scrimmage of any kind has been
held yet, due to the fact that uniforms
have not been issued. These will be
given out within a few days, and then
with some real work, Pollard will be
able to weed out the inferior players
and chose a representative first string
line-up.
The following twenty-one men have
been named by Pollard as the most
likely candidates for the Senior
eleveji:
Ends —"Walter Miller, Lloyd Tritle,
Price; tackles —Willard, Green, Wat
son; guards—Bradshaw, Fish, Frank
Spurlock; center —Earl Heater, G. W.
Patterson; quarterbacks — Ken Nef,
Griffin, Brooke; halfbacks—Patterson,
Lane Falk, Keller, Coplen, Joe Kelly.
