# LECTURER TELLS VARIED ASPECTS OF BALUCHISTAN
## Corner of Far East Described By Stanford Alumnus; Talk Is Illustrated by Slides. 
### 
"For two outstanding.reasons Baluchis
tan is a country of amazing interest.
From tlie geologist's viewpoint it inter
ests us because of the beautiful develop
ments of strata formation in its mountain
ranges, and its upworking deposits of
sandstone, which add to the unique beauty
of the country. From the point of view
of the historian, Baluchistan is interest
ing because it is the 'no man's land,'
through which countless hordes of in
vaders have swept in ages past on their
way to the rich districts of India." These
were the introductory remarks with which
Robert Vai? Yleck Anderson, Stanford
'06. began his lecture last evening in the
Little Theatre.
The lecturer gave a brief description
of the climate of Baluchistan, telling the
effect of its aridity and excessive heat
upon the geology of the country, and the
discomfort which it causes to the traveler.
There are three chief divisions of the
native stock in Baluchistan, the most
numerous being the original Indian ele
ment. Second in numbers and importance
are the Afghans, and last come the Arab
tribes, which inhabit several districts of
Baluchistan, and upon which Anderson
spoke at greatest length last evening.
The lecture was illustrated by slides
made from pictures which Anderson took
while making a geological survey of
\\ estern India several years ago. During
their trip the party crossed into Baluch
istan and made surveys of that country
also. The eastern portion of Baluch
istan is at present held by the British
government as a means of protecting tl*
Indian frontier from the inroads of bar
barians which constantly threaten it. As
a result, that part of the country shows
the marks of European influence which
are lacking in other districts. The popu
lation of the country is approximately
one million. The natives arc keenly ap
prcciative of the art of the spoken
language, but have no written literature.
The language which they speak is a blend
of several dialects, a product of the Per
sian tongue changed and adapted through
years of use by the natives of Baluchistan.
In his lecture Anderson showed pic
tures of the types of dwellings and the
means of transportation used by these
people of the Far East, and described the
character of their industries and interests.
He also described the geological forma
tions of the country and outlined the in
vestigation work which scientists hope
to carry on in this country in the near
future. His talk was a panorama of the
life and customs of Baluchistan, their ef
fect upon the character of the people
and the interest which they hold for us
as members of a western civilization.

their trip the party crossed into Baluch
istan and made surveys of that country
also. The eastern portion of Baluch
istan is at present held by the British
government as a means of protecting tl*
Indian frontier from the inroads of bar
barians which constantly threaten it. As
a result, that part of the country shows
the marks of European influence which
are lacking in other districts. The popu

one million. The natives arc keenly ap

language, but have no written literature.
The language which they speak is a blend
of several dialects, a product of the Per

years of use by the natives of Baluchistan.
In his lecture Anderson showed pic
tures of the types of dwellings and the
means of transportation used by these
people of the Far East, and described the
character of their industries and interests.
He also described the geological forma
tions of the country and outlined the in
vestigation work which scientists hope
to carry on in this country in the near
future. His talk was a panorama of the
life and customs of Baluchistan, their ef

and the interest which they hold for us
as members of a western civilization.
"For two outstanding.reasons Baluchis
tan is a country of amazing interest.
From tlie geologist's viewpoint it inter
ests us because of the beautiful develop
ments of strata formation in its mountain
ranges, and its upworking deposits of
sandstone, which add to the unique beauty
of the country. From the point of view
of the historian, Baluchistan is interest
ing because it is the 'no man's land,'
through which countless hordes of in
vaders have swept in ages past on their
way to the rich districts of India." These
were the introductory remarks with which
Robert Vai? Yleck Anderson, Stanford
'06. began his lecture last evening in the
Little Theatre.
The lecturer gave a brief description
of the climate of Baluchistan, telling the
effect of its aridity and excessive heat
upon the geology of the country, and the
discomfort which it causes to the traveler.
There are three chief divisions of the
native stock in Baluchistan, the most
numerous being the original Indian ele
ment. Second in numbers and importance
are the Afghans, and last come the Arab
tribes, which inhabit several districts of
Baluchistan, and upon which Anderson
spoke at greatest length last evening.
The lecture was illustrated by slides
made from pictures which Anderson took
while making a geological survey of
\\ estern India several years ago. During
