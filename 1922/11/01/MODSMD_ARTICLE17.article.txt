# FRESHMEN PREPARE FOR FIRST REAL BATTLE OF SEASON
## 
### 
Aftcr four straight victories against
"set-up" teams, Hunt's freshman eleven
is preparing for the first real test of its
football strength Saturday.
Twenty-five players will board the
train for Bovard field tomorrow night,
ready to mix with a U. S. C. Babe team
twenty pounds heavier, and already sea
soned by a drawn battle with the Cali
fornia Cubs.
Stanford rooters will send them off to
Los Angeles with a big rally in the
Stadium at 4:15 tomorrow.
Trojan and Cardinal yearlings are both
ready to hit their stride. The south
erners have'as their star Left End Dorsie,
who can punt a ball fifty yards. Their
3-3 tie last Saturday was partly because
of Dorsie's and partly through
the superior generalship of Quarterback
Loustalot.
In a short thirty-minute scrimmage
with the Thirds last night, the Cardinal
freshmen showed more fight than they
have displayed in any regular game so
far. They swung into their plays as a
unit, and hit the line—though it was only
their own subs' line—hard enough to
please even the critical eye of Line Coach
Post.
Hunt's eleven, therefore, may be con
ceded the edge on "fight," especially as
the Trojans' record shows a slump in the
last period of the California game, which
allowed Dixon to drop-kick the tying
score.
The Babes will perform against the '26
class team again tonight, and work out
lightly in the Stadium tomorrow.
