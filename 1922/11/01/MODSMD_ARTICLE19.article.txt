# FOUR HARD CONTESTS A HEAD OF STANFORD'S VARSITY GRID SQUAD
## Card Eleven Reaches Mid-Season In Good Shape; Bob Janssen, End, Returns to Game After Injury 
### 
Stanford varsity gridiron machine has traversed halt' the route mapped oat
for it by the schedule makers. Four games—all of them hard ones —are iu
front of the Kerr-ites and make the last half harder than the first to travel.
And then comes that late season affair with Pittsburgh 011 December 30.
Stanford lias struck its stride, and is coming fast. The Cards have improved
steadily since the start of the season, but they really found themselves last
Saturday at Corvallis. There is still a lot of work to do, if Stanford is to
win from U. S. C. 011 Armistice Day, and from Washington a week later.
But Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill are hard at it, and have their charges

working behind closed gates well into
the dusk.
Just now the skirmish with the
Nevada Jackrabbits this Saturday con
cerns the campus the most.. The lads
from Reno are a shifty "Corky"
Courtwright, their coach, always has
been an exponent of the forward pass,
even when he had "Rabbit" Bradshaw
to skirt the ends. This season there
are Scranton, a veteran of the 14-14
tie on the Stanford turf last season,
and Lowry to buck the line.
"Bunny" Hug, left half, if? capturing
all of the publicity that went to Brad
shaw last year. They say he is fast,
a good broken field runner, can handle
a forward pass—in fact, the Sage
brushers claim he is all that Bradshaw
ever was and a little bit more.
That is saying quite a bit. Cardinal
fans haven't forgotten what the "Rab
bit" did to Van Gent's varsity the week
before the Big Game last year. He put
on a last minute spurt that tied up
the contest, after the Cardinal appar
ently had it tucked away. That tie
made things look bad for the Big
Game.
Nevada's record has been impressive
enough to cause Kerr to drill his men
on the defense and to teach them sev
eral new plays. Fred Ludeke, the only
one who got more than scratches and
a faceful of mud at Corvallis, is about
ready to go again. His bruised shoul
der, although still sore, is not bother
ing him to any extent.
A little while back the end outlook
seemed none too promising. Now Kerr
has so many good men it is hard to
pick his regulars. Bob Janssen, wlio
sprained his ankle several weeks ago,
is in shape again. But Mertz, who
wasn't rated so high in the preliminary
estimates, has been playing good ball
in the last three games.
For right end, Kerr has to choose
between Jim Lawson, an end by
choice, and Norman Dole, who has j
been made over from tackle. Dole ]
showed surprisingly well in his first
attempts at the new position in the
Olympic and Santa Clara games. Then
he hurt his shoulder in the St. Mary's
affair. That brought in Lawson, who
was just recovering from an Injury
to his knee. Lawson does his tricks
about as well as any end on the Coast,
but he is hampered getting down under
punts by his weak knee.

Courtwright, their coach, always has
been an exponent of the forward pass,
even when he had "Rabbit" Bradshaw
to skirt the ends. This season there
are Scranton, a veteran of the 14-14
tie on the Stanford turf last season,
and Lowry to buck the line.
"Bunny" Hug, left half, if? capturing
all of the publicity that went to Brad
shaw last year. They say he is fast,
a good broken field runner, can handle
a forward pass—in fact, the Sage
brushers claim he is all that Bradshaw
ever was and a little bit more.
That is saying quite a bit. Cardinal
fans haven't forgotten what the "Rab
bit" did to Van Gent's varsity the week
before the Big Game last year. He put
on a last minute spurt that tied up
the contest, after the Cardinal appar
ently had it tucked away. That tie
made things look bad for the Big
Game.
Nevada's record has been impressive
enough to cause Kerr to drill his men
on the defense and to teach them sev
eral new plays. Fred Ludeke, the only
one who got more than scratches and
a faceful of mud at Corvallis, is about
ready to go again. His bruised shoul
der, although still sore, is not bother
ing him to any extent.
A little while back the end outlook
seemed none too promising. Now Kerr
has so many good men it is hard to
pick his regulars. Bob Janssen, wlio
sprained his ankle several weeks ago,
is in shape again. But Mertz, who
wasn't rated so high in the preliminary
estimates, has been playing good ball
in the last three games.
For right end, Kerr has to choose
between Jim Lawson, an end by
choice, and Norman Dole, who has j
been made over from tackle. Dole ]
showed surprisingly well in his first
attempts at the new position in the
Olympic and Santa Clara games. Then
he hurt his shoulder in the St. Mary's
affair. That brought in Lawson, who
was just recovering from an Injury
to his knee. Lawson does his tricks
about as well as any end on the Coast,
but he is hampered getting down under
punts by his weak knee.
Stanford varsity gridiron machine has traversed halt' the route mapped oat
for it by the schedule makers. Four games—all of them hard ones —are iu
front of the Kerr-ites and make the last half harder than the first to travel.
And then comes that late season affair with Pittsburgh 011 December 30.
Stanford lias struck its stride, and is coming fast. The Cards have improved
steadily since the start of the season, but they really found themselves last
Saturday at Corvallis. There is still a lot of work to do, if Stanford is to
win from U. S. C. 011 Armistice Day, and from Washington a week later.
But Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill are hard at it, and have their charges

working behind closed gates well into
the dusk.
