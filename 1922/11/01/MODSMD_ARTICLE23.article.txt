# EMULATING PONZI
## 
### 
The percentage of bad checks floating about the
University leads a good many people to believe that
altogether too many students are following - in the
financial footsteps of Ponzi on a retail basis. It
takes no week of consideration nor wrench of
imagination to take sides against this practice. It
is to be damned at first sight and from then on with
out a let-up. It's bad stuff and everybody knows it.
Why not cut it out ?
A Palo Alto merchant just the other day remarked
with the utmost good nature that the boys meant
well. "They'll all pay it back," he said. "I don't
worry about a bad check now and then if 110 one
makes a practice of writing them." While this
merchant was inclined to take a charitable view of the
situation, there is little doubt but that he disliked it.
lie was optimistic because he would have gone crazy
if every bad check he received worried him much.
And the sorry part about the whole business is the
fact that nine-tenths of it is done either intentionally
or very carelessly. Fifty per cent of the modern
students think nothing of cashing a check Saturday
noon because they will have time to cover before the
check is banked. They sign their names to a worth
less piece of paper, either knowing it is worthless
or having reason to suspect that it verges on that
degree of spuriousness, and hie themselves forth to
spend what amounts to a forced loan. Little they
care for business integrity. Little they care where
the money to cover will come from. To get the
money first and to worry afterwards is their plan of
action.
If this condition is allowed to continue. Palo Alto
business men, at least, will have their doubts alxjut
the business training of Stanford students who apply
for jobs. And as far as that is concerned, business
men elsewhere will soon get onto the facts that Stan
ford men are, to put it mildly, irresponsible.
The Men's Council has already taken action 011 one
student who was CAUGHT. This particular student
is not pointed out as a terrible exception. He was
merely CAUGHT, but the rest of the irresponsibles
look on his record with horror. Despite the fact
that they've been getting away with the same thing,
they are not profiting by his example. What inter
ests them mostly is the identity of the establishment
that brought the man in question to justice. And
instead of stopping a bad practice because of this
instance, students are seeking to cash their checks
where the danger is slight.
It will not be long before Alto merchants, the
University, and all others who receive money from
students, will take action more forcible than pleasant
011 the modern disciples of Ponzi. And the Men's
Council, moreover, will increase the temperature for
all offenders.
Now is a good time to start right.
