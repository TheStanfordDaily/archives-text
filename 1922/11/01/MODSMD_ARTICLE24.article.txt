The row down south between U. S. C. and
S. B. U. C., not to mention the wordy tiff between
the English Club and the Associated Students of
U. C. came just in time to warn Stanford people to
try to get along together. Stanford gets enough of
a black eye by sitting tight and saying nothing. If
there were any sort of a break between Stanford
students and any other college or between Stanford
student organizations, metropolitan publicity would
fatten once again. Now is a good time, while others
are fighting, to settle our troubles among ourselves,
thus to have a better foundation 011 which to build
toward an unblemished future.
