"Hey, Mister Yell Leader, when youh gonna give that
song I wrote out for you."
"Naw, I ain't going to yell this one. Don't like it.
Besides, I never learned the words."
"Let's go right now, huh? I've got to read that serial
in the Pink Book before dinner."
"So this is really a bleacher rally! Oh. Gertrude, I
wonder where all the men are?"
