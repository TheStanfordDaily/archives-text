# INJURIES TO SOCCER MEN CRIPPLE VARSITY
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity is in none too
.good a condition to meet the Olympic
Club team next Saturday.
Coach Harry Maloney is having a diffi
cult time to find some one to take Claude
Peavy's place at center forward. Sev
eral of the second-string men are being
worked in the position, but as yet no
one has shown extra playing ability.
Maloney has a wealth of material out for
the backfield, and it may be that he will
try one of the present varsity halfbacks
in the forward line.
Charlie Deffebach, inside left, and Ted
Walthers, left halfback, did not appear
in suits for Monday night's practice be
cause of injuries sustained in the game
with the Barbarians. Coach Maloney,
however, expects that both of these men
will be in condition to play in the
Olympic Club meet.
Last year the Olympic Club won second
honors in the University and Club League.
This season their team has been beaten
by the Barbarians and tied by California.
It is rumored that they will try to stop
their downhill movement next Saturday,
and. for this reason, will use players
from their team in the San Francisco
Sunday League.
