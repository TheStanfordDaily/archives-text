# Proposed Sample Bill To Be Debated by Nestoria
## 
### 
The proposed Sample Bill to pro
hibit the practice of law and giving of
legal advice by those other than law
yers will be debated at the regular
meeting of Nestoria tomorrow evening
in Room 12 of the Law building. Those
in favor of the bill declare that it will
prevent trust companies from acting
as lawyers. The negative states that
it will legislate people into lawyers'
offices, thereby creating a monopoly
for the legal men.
The question will probably be ar
gued by one-man teams. R. L. Walter,
'24. will uphold the negative, wnile the
man who will argue for the bill has
as yet not been selected.
Selection of a debate team to repre
sent Nestoria in its coming debate
with the Forum of the College of the
Pacific will also be made tomorrow.
Tivoutees will be given five minutes
for their main speech and three min
utes for rebuttal on the question, Re
solved: That the Federal Government
should take over and operate the coal
mines.
