# INTRAMURAL CROSS COUNTRY RACE SET FOR NOVEMBER 18
## 
### 
An intramural cross-country race,
the first of its kind at Stanford, has
been scheduled to be run off before
the Washington football game in the
stadium November 18.
Dr. W. H. Barrow will fire the gun
for the start of the race which will
consist of one lap around the new
stadium track and approximately three
miles over the cross-country course
with a finish of one more lap around
the stadium where the spectators can
view the results of the contest.
Considerable interest is expected to
be shown in the event since individual
awards will be given the first tnree
men to reach the finish line. Team
awards will be given the living unit
whose first three men over the course
present the lowest score. Fraternities
and other groups are allowed to enter
as many men as they wish and awards
will be made on the showing of the
best men entered. Any undergraduate
who so desires may run unattached
for individual honors. Medals will be
given the winning runners and either
a cup or a plaque to the winning team.
Intramural Director C. W. Davis,
who has arranged the details of the
race, asks a large number of men to
enter the race in an effort to develop
or discover new material for the
cross-country team. He expects at
least 200 men to enter the contest, al
lowing -ach living unit as many as
fifteen men. Entry lists will be posted
in the gymnasium on the bulletin
board where unattached individuals
are asked to sign up. These lists will
be closed November 13 in order to
prevent anyone from entering the race
at the last moment without previous
preparation and practice. Davis says
the tendency among the entries is not
to train for the event and such action
may lead to serious results among
those not in condition.
Arrangements have been made with
Cross-Country Coach "Dink" Temple
ton to allow the entries in the intra
mural race to practice with the cross
country team which goes over the
course daily. In this way men will be
able to fit themselves for the three
mile grind. Any who have not had
their physical examinations will be
examined by appointment before the
day of the race.
No varsity runners or men winning
track letters on other college teams
will be allowed to compete. This will
tend to keep the competition more
even among the contestants.
The race will start at 1:30 p. m. and
the distance to the finish line should be
coyered in about twenty minutes. It
has been arranged so that the race
will be finished before the football
teams appear on the field and (here
will be plenty of time for the runners
to get dressed and in the stadium be
fore the opening whistle blows.
