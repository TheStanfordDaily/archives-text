# TEXAS STUDENTS FORBIDDEN USE OF CARS ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Students at the University of Texas
will be prohibited from using automo
biles on the campus after January 1. 1923.
Regents of the university have made this
rule and announced that if the university
failed to take action a state law would
be enacted to prevent students driving ma
chines on the campus. Only those stu
dents who live in the town or are gradu
ates will be permitted to have cars.
The argument for abolition is that it
tends to create a social distinction among
the students. Between 250 and 300 stu
dents will be affected by this new rule.
