BALTIMORE, Nov. I.—John McGraw
needs pitchers to win anotHer National
League pennant and three world's cham
pionships in a row. That's why he owns
Jack Bentiev, for three years star of
the Baltimore Orioles.
McGraw didn't take a sudden notion
to buy Bentley. His scouts have watched
the big lefthander for two seasons
through. While Giant scouts watched
him others were watching, too. All of
these scouts believe he'll make good. In
dication No. 1.
Bentley is no kid. He's a season vet
eran of 27. In three years he has won 41
and lost 6 games. In "little world series"
competitions with St. Paul in 1920 and
1922 Bentley pitched and won five games,
three in 1920 and two in 1922. He didn't
pitch against Louisville last year.
Bentley is a finished pitching product.
He probably has' better control than any
lefthander in the game—better control
than a majority of the right handers.
Jack Dunn says he is invincible—the
greatest southpaw pitcher in baseball
today.
If he fails as a pitchcr, he still is a
hitte- and always will be. In 1921 he
hit .401, and this year's unofficial average
shows him hitting .349. In 1920 He hit
twenty home runs; in 1921, 24, and in
1922, 22.
