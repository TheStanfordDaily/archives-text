# CHEMICAL APPARATUS COMES FROM EUROPE
## 
### 
I
An advance shipment of chemicals
and apparatus imported from Germany
which arrived in this country just in
time to escape a 65 per cent duty im
posed by the new tariff law is being
unpacked for use in the chemistry
department.
Heretofore educational institutions |
have enjoyed the privileges of non
dutiable importations, but since the
new tariff regulation went into effect,
many universities have suffered heavy
losses on account of outstanding Eu
ropean orders that did not arrive in
time to escape the new law.
It is reported that the California ;
School of Technology will be forced to 1
pay duty on supplies for the equipping j
of a new physics laboratory, valued
at $46,000.
