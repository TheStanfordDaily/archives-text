# UNION CAFETERIA WILL BE CHANGED TO ROUGH'S ROOST
## Lounging Room and Restaurant For Men Included; Furnishings To Be Unique 
### 
"Rough's Roost." A real Bohemian
"joint" where Stanford men may retire
with Bohemian companions and in
dulge in the warm luxury of a hot
waffle, or draw the mystic incense of
a favorite pipe—in peace.
Such, according to plans as an
nounced last night by George B. Cul
ver, Dean of Men, is the central idea
around which is built the activity
which within a short month \Y,ill trans
form the present * caifeteria in the
basement of the Stanford Union into
a rustic coffee house. Work will begin
immediately, and the Dean assures
that Stanford men will at la t be given
a cozy, comfortable den, permeated
with a phantastic atmosphere, in which
they may retire for meals, short orders
or soft drinks.
In order to add to the effect de
sired, a number of very old, crude
tables from the historic Mayfield
gambling den will be included in the
rustic appointments of the place. These
tables are round, and made of thick
wood whereon fortunes of men have
been won and lost, and over which
reeled drunken, blear-eyed men of
days long gone.
The room itself will take on an an
cient appearance. Definite plans have
not as yet been formed, but Dean Cul
ver said that it will be a retreat where
the men of the campus will be glad to
spend their spare moments. Women
will not be allowed, according to pres
ent advices.
Rough's Roost will remain open un-;
til 11 o'clock at night. Waffles and |
coffee will probably be a specialty, it
was 1 suggested. In addition, meals from
the Stanford Union kitchen will be
served, or short orders, such as steaks
or chops, will be filled in the Roast's
kitchen.
Efforts will be made to secure the
services of an ancient character, a
jolly old soul of some sort, as cook.
Perhaps it will be a wooden-legged sea
dog, or a Frenchy with twilled mus
tache.
It is probable that there will be a
piano; over the keys of which student
fingers will ply as they pound out
melodies dear to college men. Here the
Roughs may bring their several music
al instruments and make merry as
they will.
Assisting Dean Culver in the plan
ning of this haunt are Comptroller A.
E. Roth and Professor W. E Owens,
chairman of the executive committee
of the Stanford Union.

or soft drinks.
In order to add to the effect de
sired, a number of very old, crude
tables from the historic Mayfield
gambling den will be included in the
rustic appointments of the place. These
tables are round, and made of thick
wood whereon fortunes of men have
been won and lost, and over which
reeled drunken, blear-eyed men of
days long gone.
The room itself will take on an an
cient appearance. Definite plans have
not as yet been formed, but Dean Cul
ver said that it will be a retreat where
the men of the campus will be glad to
spend their spare moments. Women
will not be allowed, according to pres
ent advices.
Rough's Roost will remain open un-;
til 11 o'clock at night. Waffles and |
coffee will probably be a specialty, it
was 1 suggested. In addition, meals from
the Stanford Union kitchen will be
served, or short orders, such as steaks
or chops, will be filled in the Roast's
kitchen.
Efforts will be made to secure the
services of an ancient character, a
jolly old soul of some sort, as cook.
Perhaps it will be a wooden-legged sea
dog, or a Frenchy with twilled mus
tache.
It is probable that there will be a
piano; over the keys of which student
fingers will ply as they pound out
melodies dear to college men. Here the
Roughs may bring their several music
al instruments and make merry as
they will.
Assisting Dean Culver in the plan
ning of this haunt are Comptroller A.
E. Roth and Professor W. E Owens,
chairman of the executive committee
of the Stanford Union.
