## 
### 
Two Stanford teams will debate the
proposeN Water and Power Amendment
to the State Constitution with the Uni
versity of California and the University
of Southern California Monday evening,

Tobriner, '24, will argue on the negative
side of the question, against California,

Francisco, Monday evening at 8. At the
same time John Hall, '25, and Robert
Lewis, '24, will uphold the affirmative
against U. S. C. in the Assembly hall
on the campus.
The team which will meet California
is the more experienced, Landels and
Tobriner have both had previous inter
collegiate debating experience. How
ever. Coach Emerson is sending an able
and enthusiastic team against U. S. C.,
who may make up in earnestness and

work what t hey lack in experience.
Edward Landels is a senior in the
Economics department and a member ot'
Euphronia. Landels has participated in
several intercollegiate and inter-society
debates. He won the $25 prize speaking
contest here last year with the subject.
"A Plea for Sanity in Intercollegiate
Athletics," and with the same subject he
took first in the Northern Oratorical
contest at Pullman. Washington.
Mathew Tobrincr, '24, is a law major
and a member of Euphronia. Last year
he participated in the Stanford-California
and the Euphronia-California Senate
debates.

member of Euphronia and a law major.
The "dark horse" of the tryouts was
