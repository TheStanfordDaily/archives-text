# Freshmen Leave For Game With Trojans
## Rally at Stadium is Send-off to Twenty-five Babes in First Real Contest of the Season on Saturday 
### 
Twenty-five freshman grid warriors are leading the campus for the
University of Southern California at 8:30 tonight, ready for the battle of their
football lives.
That "sixty minutes of fight," the slogan on every billboard at O. A. C., can
be put up again for the Babes' souther n invasion.
When Coach "Husky" Hunt led his men off the turf at 5 o'clock this after
noon, and the rooters had sent the last yell of their send-off rally booming
across the stadium, there was no doubt in his mind that the Stanford frosli
have developed into a lighting eleven.
Down on Bovard field a hard-hitting, beefy bunch of Trojan Babes is prepar
ing to take the best the Cardinals can offer. Their line, weighing close to 190
pounds from tackle to tackle, will be ready by Saturday to meet the onslaughts

of the Babes. Adams, the plunging
halfback who wrenched his neck in
last week's game at Berkeley, will be
back in moleskins, and Dorsle, the left
end who kicked the football 50 yards
against the Cubs, is primed to dupli
cate the best that Ernie Nevers' toe
can offer.
So far the freshmen have had no
real opposition, and no chance to test
out their machine under a strain.
Tonight they are traveling 400 miles
south to a game every whit as hard
as the big contest with California.
Personnel of Squad
Coach Hunt has announced the squad
to leave as follows: McDermot, Fas
soth, Stevenson, Ackerman, Briggs,
Goodrich, Nicholson, Potts, Sholes,
Scribner, Davis, Cameron, Armour,
Harville, Hunt, Mitchell, Faust, Cook,
Clayes, Frazier, Kir wan, Stratton, Ris
pin, Solomon.
This is the largest freshman squad
ever sent on a trip. Accompanying the
players will be Coach Hunt, Jimmy
Ross, trainer, and Roland Kinney, man
ager.
The probable line-up, according to
the first team's personnel last night,
is: McDermot, r. e.; Goodrich, r. t.; i
Davis, r. g.; Hunt, c.; Sholes, 1. g.; j
Potts, 1. t.; Stevenson, 1. e.; Mitchell,;
q.; Solomon, r. h.; Faust, 1. li.;j
Nevers, 112.
Clayes May Play End
The coaches tried out A1 Clayes at
end yesterday. The speedy little half
back got down nicely on punts against
the interclass squad and may start on
one of the wings Saturday.
Charley Stratton, who was discov
ered playing fullback on the class team
a few days ago and promoted to the !
first string, was clipping off long
yardage last night. He is a light, shifty
player who may develop into another
flash of the Cook-Kirwan-Clayes order.
Subs Get in Scrimmage
The subs on the first squad got most
of the scrimmage against the '26 team j
last night. Hunt sent the first eleven 1
in for the last ten minutes.
Tonight the squad went through
signal practice before the bleacher
rally crowd.
Dinner for the freshmen going to ]
Los Angeles will be served in Sequoia j
Club dining rooms at 6:15 tonight. I
