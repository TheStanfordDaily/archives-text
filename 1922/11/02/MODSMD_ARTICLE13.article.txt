# RECORD NUMBER OF MEN OUT FOR SOCCER
## 
### 
Never before in the history of soccer
at Stanford has Coach Harry Maloney
had so many men signed up for the Eng
lish sport. Over four full teams are ap
pearing-every night for practice, and it
has been found necessary to divide the
players up into the first, second, and third
varsities.
Competition for all three of the teams
has been unusually keen this season.
It was because of this fact that the three
team idea was developed. Coach Ma
loney wants to give everyone a chance
to show what he can do, and he considers
his present plant the best method of do
ing this.
Of late, the second team has been im
proving. In a practice game with the
Varsity last night, it was able to hold the
first squad to a 2-1 score.
The rule for eligibility on the second
squad for games played in the second
division of the University and Club'
League is that the person must have bet
ter than a freshman standing in his col
lege work, and that he must not have
played with the Varsity in any league
game. A person taken from the Varsity
and played on the second team is not
eligible for the first team for three
games.
