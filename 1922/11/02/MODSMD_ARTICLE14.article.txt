# OREGON AGGIES MAY TRY HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
Oregon Agricultural College is
awakening to a need for an honor sys
tem in class work such as has been in
force throughout Stanford since the
spring of 1921, and in various depart
ments for several years longer.
Dean Cordley of the O. A. C. issued
a statement in which he said in part,
"The honor system is the best solution
to the present condition on the cam
pus.
"If reports of instructors and stu
dents interviewed can be relied upon,
cheating is prevalent in examinations.
"The one thing needed is the right
sentiment 011 the part of the student
body, a sentiment that would endorse
such a system and enforce it."
