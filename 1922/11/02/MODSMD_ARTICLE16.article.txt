# GRAYS SCRIMMAGE VARSITY; TO PLAY SAILORS SATURDAY
## 
### 
Red Betts and his Grays are priv
ileged characters. Red took his whole
troop over to the varsity field last night,
the gate opened and closed and the Grays
were seen no more. Not only did they
penetrate the barrage of secrecy which
Andy Kerr has laid down, but they en
gaged in a fast scrimmage with the
Varsity for more than an hour.
What actually went on while the Grays
were closeted with Kerr's cohorts is a
secret. \\ hen the gates finally opened,
however, Betts emerged with a satisfied
grin on his face and declared himself to
be well satisfied with the kind of football
his team had played against the Varsity.
The Grays looked particularly good on
the defensive.
Betts, has been working his men hard
all week and has made some shifts in the
line-up for next Saturday's game, which
will be played with the U. S. S. Camden
instead of the Agnetian Club. The club
team will not be able to appear Saturday,
so the sailors have been secured to sub
stitute.
Long, who lias been playing at end for
the Grays, has been shifted to tackle,
which position he held on the 1923 fresh
man eleven. He is showing to good ad
vantage at tackle and will probably start
the game Saturday in this position.
Widaman, the big fellow who has been
performing well at end, is out with a
boil on his elbow. He reported for prac
tice this afternoon, but may not be ready
to play Saturday. In case he cannot
play, "Red" Lawrence will take his place
The Grays invaded the sacred domain
of Kerr's warriors again this afternoon
for a dummy scrimmage.
