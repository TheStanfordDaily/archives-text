# LIGHTING EFFECTS FOR YEAR'S FIRST PLAY DISTINCTIVE
## Bizarre and Futuristic Stage Set Will Be Used in Sword and Sandals Play Friday 
### 
By Carl Shoup, ’24

Dress rehearsal number one of "Her
Husband's Wife" was run through in
quick time last night, only about two
hours and a half being taken up by
the whole three acts. Tonight the last
rehearsal takes place.
Most of the experimenting and
changing that was done last night con
cerned the lighting effects. "Some
thing different," though a well-worn
phrase, may yet be applied to the sys
tem of illumination devised by Bent
inck, director; Atwood, head electri
cian, and their helpers.
Diffused Lighting Used
The three acts of the play call for
lighting effects typifying first, mid
afternoon of a hot August day; second,
towards sunset, after five o'clock; and
third, a couple of hours later, about
seven. To make the scenes at all natur
al, an indirect system of diffused light
is needed in place of the ordinary
glaring footlights and concert border
lights—the latter being the ones sus
pended at the top of the stage a short
distance back of the curtain.
These latter lights as ordinarily
used throw the figures on the stage
into a plane of glaring light that
obliterates all chance for showing
perspective. Only two dimensions
stand out—breadth and height. The
third dimension of depth is thus lost.
Realistic Effect Obtained
To overcome this, Bentinck has been
attempting the best compromise pos
sible to use with the Assembly hall
stage, and has succeeded in overcom
ing the inevitable limitations present
so that a more realistic effect is se
cured. This can be noted in the mid
afternoon scene. A room at this time
should naturally show much shadow,
with here and there the diffused light
entering from the outside. This can
not be done with footlights and con
cert border lights alone, and so an
auxiliary lighting apparatus has been
erected.
Lights Shine From Above
This apparatus consists chiefly of
six one thousand candlepower lamps,
each with its own reflector, arranged
about the stage. Three of them shine
down upon the players from above
stage immediately back of the curtain
—a modified "x-ray bofder" effect. The
other three are placed behind-stage in
the center, and shining upon the back
drop, reflect their colored light through
the thin veranda curtains bar k into the
room. In addition there are two sets
of "bunch lights" arranged each on
one side of the stage, half-way back.
Same Setting Throughout
The setting of the play remains the
same throughout. It is the interior of
a fashionable modern home, opening
out at the reav upon a veranda. Faint
notes of a year ago, when "Koo-Koo-
Kubistown" made all the straight-line
artists happy, are sounded in some of
the border effects, which tend to the
bizarre. The three separate levels of
the stage further carry out the impres
sion that tomorrow night's audience is
going to see something new.
