# HOW "POP" WARNER STANDS AT PITTSBURGH
## 
### 
Unofficial reports from Pittsburgh for the past
few weeks have occasionally carried the impression
that authorities in the eastern institution are criti
cizing their coach. A letter received by the Daily
from K. K. Davis, Graduate Manager of Pittsburgh,
helps to clear up the matter.
"Pitt students and alumni are accepting their de
feats as good sportsmen this year, and are not in
clined to criticize Coach Warner," declares Davis.
"We do not care to appear in the light of poor losers.
J doubt if there is another institution in the United
States that has accepted defeat more gracefully than
Pittsburgh, and while we have been fortunate for a
number of years in losing only a few games, we
realize that we can't make that sort of a record all
the time."
[11 referring to an editorial entitled "Setting
Warner's Critics Right." which appeared in the
October 20 issue of the Daily Palo Alto, Davis said,
"You are right in the statement which I have under
scored." ,
The statement was, "Any declarations that are
being made, if any have been made, certainly do not
come from people in authority at Pittsburgh."
Davis also calls attention to a story which ap
peared in the Buffalo "Courier" recently.
"While the University of Pittsburgh team has lost
two games thus far to Lafayette and West Virginia,"
says the "Courier," "Panther rooters are far from
discouraged. They realize that Coach "Pop" War
ner has quite a task on his hands this year moulding
a team together with a number of stars lost from last
year, and they are showing every confidence in the
famous coach by sticking back of him to a man
through defeat just as they did in victory."
A statement as definite as Graduate Manager
Davis' certainly ought to end this idle chatter which
has kept the sport wires humming for the past two
weeks.
