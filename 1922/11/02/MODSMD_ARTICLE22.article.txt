# "ROUGHS' ROOST"
## 
### 
It" the Old Union cafeteria goes in for such a
career as has been cut out for it by Dean Culver, it
is going to be something Stanford lias needed for a
long time. As it now stands, nobody can deny that
it is a place to eat. that it is clean, and that it is a
great improvement. But as for its being the won
derful place students were expecting, the editor's
typewriter simply refuses to work. It has a
conscience.
Those in charge of the Union are having many
difficulties in getting established, and now is no time
for atiylxxly to complain. It is certainly true that the
food situation, so far as quality is concerned, is far
better than it has been at any time in this college
generation. Let us all hope for the advent of
Roughs' Roost and, further, let us hope that it will
be open on Saturdays and later than 11 at night.
That's just about the time most people want their
waffles.
