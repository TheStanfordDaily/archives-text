# BACKING THE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Aside from a few weak hurrahs when the fresh
man team makes a touchdown, the bleachers have
been sitting through preliminary football games
emulating the justly-famous Egyptian mummy. If
the freshmen are expected to produce the goods as
the Varsity has, they must have at least their share
of student support. The men leave tonight for
Southern California, where they will meet the
Trojan Babes. They should feel when they leave
that they are representing Stanford and not merely
an athletic system. They should be given to feel
that their part in the University is the personal con
cern of every undergraduate.
It is not likely that Stanford students will forget
to do this much for the future varsitv.
