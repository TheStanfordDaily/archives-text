Useless citizens: The guy who insists on stamping
his feet when the prof is giving page references.

Yesterday Reggie the Rough was gloomy. Not for
days had a smile broken through the clouds on his brow.
But today we saw him on the Engineering bench with a
grin plastered all over. The wind has come up . . .
Winter is here.

Prisoner (about to be sentenced): "Aw, Judge, have a
heart. I'm a poor man with seventeen children, and I'm
down and out."
Hard-hearted Judge: "You may be down, but you're
not out. Six months!"

Were you ever feelin' gloomy, thinkin' life was on the
rocks,
Were you ever gettin' exes, in your dog-gone eight
o'clocks?
Were things always goin* goofy, though you worked
from morn to night?
Did you ever feel like murder, right out in the broad
day light?
But surrounded by your troubles, have you summoned
up a smile?
Did you dance beneath your burden, tellin' all that life's
worth while?
Have you followed out the Golden Rule, to cneer up
those around?
You say you did? That proves that you're—a doggone
lying hound!

For the benefit of the general (and otherwise) public,
Cabbages hereby announces a correspondence school in
newspaper writing, selling, advertising, and bunk.
The first lesson will be in writing heads. Any who
quickly catch the class of the head will go to the head
of the class.
