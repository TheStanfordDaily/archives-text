# STATEMENTS ISSUED REGARDING PROPOSED "WATER POWER ACT"
## 
### 
Professor C. D. Marx, head of the De
partment of Civil Engineering, and Dan
Evans, '20, president of the Associated
Students last year, have given their
views on regard to the proposed Water
and Power Amendment to the California
Constitution.
Profesor Marx believes that the man
ner in which the proposal is presented is
objectionable.
"It is to be noted that this act is pre
sented as an initiatory measure and as a
constitutional amendment. Both of these
features, in my opinion, are objectionable.
An act of such importance should have
had the fullest possible discussion by duly
elected representatives in the Legislature,
and, even after its discussion and draft
ing by a legislative committee, it should
not be presented in the form of a con
stitutional amendment.
"An act involving many details is likely
to call for many necessary changes before
n can be a perfectly satisfactory work
able act. The history of legislation in
connection with the Water Commission
Act of California proves this. Similar
experience was had with the Ontario Act,
so often cited in support of the measure.
'1 hi* act, adopted by the Legislative As
sembly of < )ntario in 1903, has been
amended every year but one.
"The California Water and Power Act
furthermore attempts to do by indirection
what cannot be done by direction. At the
present time municipal bond issues, in
order to be legal, must have a two-thirds
vote in their favor. In this act, the
power is vested in the members of the
commission to issue bonds without such
a safeguard.
"The claim is furthermore advanced
that electric power will be furnished at
a less cost to the citizens of the state
because of the difference in rate of in
terest at which state bonds can be sold,
as compared with the bonds of private
corporations. This statement, while true
in general, does not take into account the
fact that the rate at which state bonds
can be placed is likely to depend upon
the outstanding bonds of that state, and j
the contemplated issue of five hundred j
million dollars' worth of bonds may in
crease the rate at which these bonds will
have to be sold in order to find a market
for them."
Evans urges students to become in
formed on the power act.
"During the last three years the tra
ditional provincial attitude of college
student bodies has shown a tendency to
disappear; and the members of these
bodies, realizing that the affairs of the j
nation, state and community vitally affect
them, are beginning to investigate the
facts aback of the great public questions
which demand settlement. Among these
questions is the proposed 'Water and
Power" Act. So vast are its proposals,
so far reaching would be its results, so
opposed are . the different theories in
volved. that every Californian would be
derelict in his duty as a citizen if he did
not consider it carefully and intelligently.
"Stanford students are therefore par
ticularly fortunate in being able to listen
to an authentic presentation of the case
for and against the act by the Stanford-
University of Southern California de
baters the night before the election."
