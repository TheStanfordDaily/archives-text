## 
### 
Forty thousand dollars of the requisite
$150,000 for the proposed hotel on Palm
Drive is yet to be subscribed.
Stock subscribers have been informed
of the status of the company. Fifteen
underwriters have deficiencies to be met,
and the responsibility of completing the
stcxrk canvass rests on this group. Sev
eral teams have been organized to secure
this final quota.
Slowness in selling the last portion of
the stock is due to the fact that many of
the prospects interviewed declare that

they have promised to buy stock through |
some other solicitor. This trouble will!
be overcome by permitting the purchaser
to credit stock bought to any one he
wishes.
