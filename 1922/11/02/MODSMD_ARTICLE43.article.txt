It only goes to indicate that civiliza
tion is still progressing! Picture the
olden days when the Ruff gulped his
"choc malt" in a plain little tavern,
unadorned and undecorated; where
there were no fanciful colorings to
shock his aesthetic sense; and his
declaration of the place as a whole
was, "Well, it'll pass!"

a regular elite Shoppe has ambled in
as a substitute. Here prostrate studes
fatigued from the daily grind of hit
ting the books, may partake of re
freshment and nourishment, amid fu
turistic surroundings of orange and
blue drapes and cream-colored walls.
One Ruff remarked recently, "I feel
out of place here now."
