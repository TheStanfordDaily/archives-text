Several Veterans Report
Captain "Lefty" Rogers appears to
be in very good condition and declares
that his knee which he injured last
season is entirely well now. "Nip" Mc-
Hose, the flashy forward of last year's
quintet, has not lost any of the speed
that gained liim the reputation of
being one of the quickest players in
these regions. He has added weight,
which will greatly aid him.
Fred Anderson, who substituted for
Dick Richmond in several games last
year, has made his appearance at the
practices. Hoffman of the 1925 fresh
men team looks to be the man that
will make a strong bid to fill the
vacancy left by Jirumie Davies. Oliva,
guard; Hooper, forwarfl, and Steele,
center, all of last year's Babe team,
are limbering up their muscles.
Freshman Stars Back
Mcßurney, a transfer from the Cali
fornia Southern Branch, has reported

tuted for Janssen at center in the Cali

stein and Coulthurst of last year's
varsity squad.

fied his intentions of donning a suit

forward on the same team, has signi
fied his intentions of donning a suit
within the next week.
Friday Games Planned
It is proposed to hold the games pn
Friday evening this year instead of
011 Saturday as in the past. It is be
lieved that a larger number of people
will be able to attend the games under
this new plan.
Stanford will not play any prelim
inary games with the northern teams
this year, but will play four games
against California and four against
University of Southern California. The
team making the highest percentage
between these three teams will play a
series with the team winning the hon
ors in the Oregon and Washington
half of the conference. In this way the
champion will be picked.
Games have been scheduled with
Santa Clara, St. Mary's, St. Ignatius,
Nevada, Olympic Club, California, and
Southern California.
Varsity basketball practice for the
fall opened Monday afternoon at the
Pavilion when a number of last year's
veterans got back into action. The
practices for several weeks will be
held on Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day afternoons. The squad will be lim
ited to former members of the varsity
and freshman squads, and to players
who have played on other college
teams.
While Coach Andy Kerr is busy di
recting the football eleven the team
will be handled by ex-Captain Jimmie
Davies and Captain "Lefty" Rogers,
under Kerr's directions.
A number of the varsity basketball
players are on flie football squad and
will not be out for the court game till
the start of the winter quarter. Pros
pects this early in the season look
very promising.
Several Veterans Report
Captain "Lefty" Rogers appears to
be in very good condition and declares
that his knee which he injured last
season is entirely well now. "Nip" Mc-
Hose, the flashy forward of last year's
quintet, has not lost any of the speed
that gained liim the reputation of
being one of the quickest players in
these regions. He has added weight,
which will greatly aid him.
Fred Anderson, who substituted for
Dick Richmond in several games last
year, has made his appearance at the
practices. Hoffman of the 1925 fresh
men team looks to be the man that
will make a strong bid to fill the
vacancy left by Jirumie Davies. Oliva,
guard; Hooper, forwarfl, and Steele,
center, all of last year's Babe team,
are limbering up their muscles.
Freshman Stars Back
Mcßurney, a transfer from the Cali
fornia Southern Branch, has reported
for practice. Paul Pigott, who substi
tuted for Janssen at center in the Cali
fornia series, is 011 hand, as are Lowen
stein and Coulthurst of last year's
varsity squad.
Shipkey, Driscoll, and Middleton are
members of the '25 quintet who will
report for practice at the close of the
gridiron season. Alexander, who played
forward on the same team, has signi
fied his intentions of donning a suit
within the next week.
