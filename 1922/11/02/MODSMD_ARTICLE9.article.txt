# COACH KERR LOOKS FOR HARD BATTLE WITH NEVADA TEAM
## Sagebrushers Change Name to Wolves; Record Indicates They Are Strong Eleven 
### 
Wolves versus Cardinal next Satur
day.
That "Wolves" is something new. It
is the 1922 title of those that were last
year, the year before, etc., known as
the Sagebrushers from Nevada. When
"Rabbit" Bradshaw and his long runs
were in vogue at Reno, they were also
called the Jackrabbits. But with the
versatile Bradshaw gone, the student
body wiped the slate clean and chose
the name of Wolves.
Wolves, Sagebrushers, Jackrabbits,
or whatever Courtwright's eleven is
called, Coach Kerr foresees a hard
battle for the Cardinal next Saturday.
"We will have just as hard a game as
we had last Saturday at Corvallis,"
predicted the varsity mentor last night.
"From rill that I can learn, Nevada has
a strong team, and is coming down all
ready to put something over on us if
it can.
"They had an easy game last week
end, .and laid up as much as possible
to be ready for us. The 14-to-14 tie
last year encouraged them.
"I don't hope to win by a large score
Saturday. It may be that two, seven
or ten points will* look like a big
margin to us."
The record of the Wolf Pack may
or may not be considered impressive.
Nevada bested St. Mary's at the first
of the season by a 21-to-13 score at
Reno. Then came "Gloomy Gus" Hen
derson and his despondent Trojans.
Henderson probably had his men
working under wraps but it wasn't un
til the last five minutes that they
shoved over a touchdown for a 6-to-0
win.
Those scores indicate that the
Wolves are not without fangs. The
black man in the woodpile, however,
is probably the high altitude at Reno,
which tires the visiting teams quickly.
Against Davis Farm at Sacramento last
Saturday, Courtwright's men didn't
look so good and only won 6 to 2, al
though they probably didn't extend
themselves.
