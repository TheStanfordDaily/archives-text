# Steaming Crullers Fried By Journalist Chefettes Will Be Sold Wednesday
## 
### 
Oh Boy! Bring your nickels and
dimes for the choicest of delectable ap
petizers ever cooked by mortal man.
Steaming, Crisco-dipped secrets, rivalling
the choicest crullers given by Salvation
Army lasses to hungry buddies during
the war, will be sold Wednesday morn
ing by Theta Sigma Phi in front of the
Women's Clubhouse. When you have
crushed through the culinary delights to
the hole—which is the worst part of
them—you will reach for some change
and rush back for more.
The journalistic cooks will work from
9 until 12 unless students become so en
thusiastic that the demand exceeds the
supply long before mid-day is reached.
What's more, they'll be only two for
a buffalo.
