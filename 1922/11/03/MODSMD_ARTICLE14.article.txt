# Y.W.C.A. Industrial Study Group To Be Organized
## 
### 
All women interested in industrial
vocational work are asked to meet
with Marion Leflingwell, '22, Thursday
afternoon at 4 o'clock in the Women's
Clubhouse. At this time the vocational
committee of the Y. W. C. A. will be
organized and plans made for its work
during the coming year.

Women who have worked during
the summer in industrial plants are
especially invited to come to the com
mittee meeting Thursday. Their prac
tical experience with industrial con
ditions will keep the committee discus
sions from becoming too theoretical.
OIT-campus speakers will meet with
the committee during the year if the
organization proves successful.
