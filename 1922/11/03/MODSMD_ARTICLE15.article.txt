# U.S. CAMDEN ELEVEN TO CLASH WITH GRAYS
## 
### 
Last Saturday the Mare Island Ma
rines had to play only two quarters of
football to defeat the Stanford Grays,
20-0. Coach Betts has been working his
men hard this week, though, and if the
Grays play the same kind of football
when the sailors from the U. S. S. Cam
den invade the campus tomorrow as
they have shown against the Varsity,
the "gobs" will have to travel at top
speed the entire game if they hope to'
come out on the long end of the score.
In the regular scrimmage Wednesday
night and the dummy scrimmage last
night, the Grays played good defensive
ball and showed signs of developing a
real offensive system.
Widaman, who has been out ..with a
boil on his elbow, reported for practice
last night and will probably be able to
start the game tomorrow in his old po
sition at end. Long, who has been shift
ed from end to tackle, looks like the
goods in this position and will prob
ably start the game. Betts has been
counting on "Red" Lawrence to take
Widaman's place at end should the lat
ter be unable to play, but Lawrence hurt
his leg last night and may not be in a
suit tomorrow.
The Marines tore the Grays' line to
pieces last Saturday and Betts has made
some shifts which has strengthened his
primary defense materially.
The Grays will line up as follows:
Williams, center; Hayes and Rogers,
guards; Long and McCoombs, tackles;
Robinson and Widaman, ends; Fuller,
quarter; Erhorn and Hamilton, halves;
Woodhead or Wright, fullback.
