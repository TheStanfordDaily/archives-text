## 
### 
University of Southern California's
freshman gridiron gladiators are Babes
and very green to the sophomore eye,
but nevertheless they arc real Trojans.
And following an hour of football in
Berkeley last week, there are doubt
lessly a few young men of the Uni
versity of California '26 class who would
swear by Mr. Heck and Mrs. Gum that
the only thing green about the south
erners is their eyes.
Stanford's first-year men are to meet
the U. S. C. reagreens in Los Angeles
tomorrow as a preliminary to the Trojan
Varsity's game with Occidental College.
Efforts will he made to turn the green
blue, and the faithful maintain that this
little trick can be done.
U. S. C. held the California frosh to a
3 to 3 score, although some would main
tain that California held U. S. C. to that
count. In any event, the Trojan frosh
played a powerful defensive game and
lost their chances of a 3 to 0 victorv

only in the last few miftutes of play, i
They impressed Northern California ex
perts with their strength, and it is cer- !
tain that they will he worthy foes for |
Stanford's yearlings. They are, in fact,!
favorites to defeat Stanford by a ma-j
jority of sporting writers who have seen |
both teams in action.
Gene Dorsey, playing at right end, was
the outstanding star of the California j
game. Dorsey was really the most able j
all-around player in the Southern Cali- '
fornia high schools last year. Playing
for Hollywood High, he was chosen
All-Southern guard.
Dorsey played a great offensive and
defensive game last Saturday, but it was
his kicking that amazed Berkeley fans.
He is also a wonderful passer; several
times last year he completed forty-five
yard passes.

I him a place 011 the second All-Southern.

outstanding tackles on the Coast. Earl,
the other tackle, was All-Southern from
Fullerton.

| Southern guard hist year while playing
1 with San Diego. He is a wonderful der
fensive player. Newerf, the other regu
! lar guard, showed up well against Cali
| fornia. Harry Hicks, fifty-pound weight
i thrower, also plays guard. The center
i is Herbert Smutz, from Lincoln High
in Los Angeles, chosen All-City center.
Henry LeFebvre is the star of the
backfield. He was a sensation three
years ago with the state champion Long
Beach eleven, but the following year he
was injured just before the Jackrabbits
met Everett High of Washington.
Quarterback Loustellot played with
the state champion Bakersfield eleven.
Fullback Nason starred for Hbllywood
