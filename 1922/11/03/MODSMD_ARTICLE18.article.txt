# CARDINAL GRIDMEN TO MIX WITH WOLF PACK FROM NEVADA
## Heavier Stanford Varsity Has Edge on Courtwright's Eleven 
### 
Little Nevada, nemesis of the big elevens in Coast football, pays its annual
visit to the campus tomorrow afternoon in an attempt to stop the onward
rush of the Card varsity.
Dud DeGroot and his red-jerseyed satellites are prepared for the eominK
of the Wolf Pack from the sagebrush hills of western Nevada. The Stanford
football machine is under way and rapidly gaining momentum, and will put
on a little more speed tomorrow at the Stadium.
If the balance swing to either side at all, then it favors the heavier Stanford
eleven, which is playing on its home-grounds for the iirst time since that
successful excursion into Oregon. It has gained confidence and experience
following the'stand in the mud and rain at Corvallis. Janssen and Ludeke

| are the only ones that rate being on
i a "cripple" list.
Nevada has thrown a scare into
more than one heavier and better team.
For the last two years, the Keno-ites,
with "Rabbit" Bradshaw. have pushed
over a score on the Blue and Gold,
i Then there is that 14-14 account with
Stanford last fall still to be settled.
The nickname of Wolves is no mis
nomer for Courtwright's men. The
majority of them carry around no ex
cess weight, and depend on speed
rather than bulk. For part of the
j game, they will appear to be perfectly
tame, then they will suddenly rise up
and strike in the least expected
places. Forward passing and trick
formations in abundance the Wolves
possess for their attack.
"Bunny" Hug, said to be greater
than Bradshaw ever was, is a halfback
weighing about 140 pounds. Hobbs is
adept at snaring the elusive forward
pass, and the backs, Lowry and Stran
ton, buck the line and skirt the ends.
Nevada is not underrated by Stan
ford. "Go in to tight all the time, and
win by as large a score as possible"
were the battle orders given the Cards
by Field Marshal Kerr.
Only two positions are doubtful on
the varsity. Dick Faville, who played
a good game against the Aggies, is
| expected to start at right guard. Jim
! Lawson seems due to commence at
I right end, although it is a toss-up be
-1 tween him and Dole.
"Shorty" Mertz will be in the fray
j at left end and Bob Janssen, whose in-
I jured ankle has mended, will sit on
the bench, for a time at least. "Bud"
Woodward, who is carting around a
weak wrist, will direct the play with
Wilcox, Doughty and Cuddeback to
carry the ball.

The left side of the line remains in-;
tact, with Mertz, Shipkey, and Cra
vens. DeGroot will take care of center,
and Johnston is In his old position at
right tackle.
