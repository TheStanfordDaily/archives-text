## 
### (By United Press 
SAN MATEO, Nov. 3.—Carrying the
greatest load ever lifted from the
ground by a single motor, Lieutenants
Oakley Kelly and John Macßeady, army
airmen, got away early today to a per
fect start on their attempted non-stop
flight to New York City.
Army airmen here who watched the
start are confident that the record-hold
ing pair will be successful this time.
One month ago, starting on the same
course, Kelly and Macßeady were
blocked by heavy clouds in a mountain
pass. The tremendous load they carried
would not permit them to pass over, so
they turned their flight into an endurance
-Hglit, and broke all world records with
a sustained flight time of 35 hours and
18 minutes.
