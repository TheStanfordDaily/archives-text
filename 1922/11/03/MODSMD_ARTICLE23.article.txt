# THE 						MANIA TO BELONG
## 
### 
Slanford is certainly becoming a nursery for or
ganizations. Whether the cause is the climate, a
mental disease, or just an advanced stage of the
American craze to organize, is a matter of opinion.
Perhaps it is a result of all three. The condition
remains, however, of an abundant, if not a super
fluous organization.
Honor societies and professional fraternities
spring up in certain departments. For a year or
two leaders are selected for membership, but it is
not long before those who were left out get together
and honor themselves by getting a charter or a
chapter or a franchise or anything else that will
stamp them with the official title—organization.
And a year or two later, when certain people have
been omitted from both groups, a third organization
is sprung on the public and another pin is added
to the many to confuse the public eye and to decorate
the bulging chest of the wearer.
So long as an organization means nothing but
"honor," which ceases to be such if it ever was when
everybody belongs to something with a funny
sounding name, it has little reason to exist. To
justify its presence on the fact of the earth an
organization must not only have ideals, but must
DO something. To wear a pin or just "to belong"
is not enough.
Groups organizing for social purposes are not in
cluded in this criticism of organizations in general.
They are intended to be of benefit chiefly to them
selves. But organizations which are supposed to
guide the action of students, to supply the motives
for advancement to others, or in any way other than
socially to benefit the University, should be
comprised of students who have ALREADY
ACHIEVED SOMETHING. To overlap such
organizations with material left after choice of mem
bers has been made by the senior society is only to
exhibit a blind desire to belong to something, or to
wear a pin indicative of prestige.
Who will be the goat and give the next self
honored group the laugh?
