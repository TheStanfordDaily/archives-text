						START IN INTER-GROUP ATHLETICS

### 
When the Physical Education department re
turned interclass football to the campus, everybody
was invited to "grab a root and growl." The invita
tion has been acccpted.
Judging by the turnout for the majority of classes,
the first season is going to be a success. It ought to
he. It is worth while. And, moreover, it wouldn't
be a bad idea if those who haven't been fortunate
enough to make a team or who haven't been able to
go out for one would appear on the side-lines when
the interclass struggles begin. This is an activity
as worthy of supj)ort as any the University now
boasts.
