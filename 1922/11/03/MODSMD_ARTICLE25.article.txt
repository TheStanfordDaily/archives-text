IN MEMORIAM
OLD STANFORD SPIRIT. Died
at Bleacher Rally, October, '22
• * *
Cabbages hates to hurl the old stale cabbages so often,
but it seemed like something must be done to liven up
those bleacher rallies. So here are the needed sug
gestions:
* * *
Organize co-eds football team. Have the uniforms
hand-embroidered so co-eds will be willing to appear in
them. Organize game with Milpitas Girls' School. Have
bleacher rally to send off girls to Milpitas. Provide
seating for 1,999 snakes. Give our Stanford llough
reserved seat in front row. Run in Stanford varsity
between girls' scrimmages so Rough can cheer them.
Serve tea with dash of lemon. Give one yell that
everyone knows, such as 1 Rah, Rah, Rah, Stanford!
Pass coughdrops and adjourn. Repeat as often as
necessary.

A man sat on a picket fence. Picket fences were
invented by pickets during the Civil War. Still the
man sat on the fence.
* * *
It was night. The man on the fence was thinking.
His name was Lippett. He loved Maronet. Maronet
lived inside in the gloomy house, outside of which the
man sat on the picket fence.
* * *
Lippett was poor, Heroes are always poor. Maronet
opened a window and threw a clock at Lippett. "Time
to move," he chortled. He got off the fence and walked
away. A hint was enough for him.
» * •
Lippett knew he needed money to marry Maronet. -He
had guessed it from her conversation. She told him so.
He went off to earn money.
• * * *
In two years Lippett returned in a handsome car with
a uniformed chat'feur. Two attendants rode beside the
driver. But Maronet had married the Rich Merchant.
The handsome car rolled on. They were taking Lippett
to jail. It was the police patrol.

DID You know that:
1. A bullet shot at the sun would never get there?
2. It is not necessary or advisable to cut law classes
on every legal holiday?
3. We had a bleacher rally yesterday? (We are at
least persistent).

Les Incomprehensibles—Victor Hugh Go.

A man sat on a picket fence. Picket fences were
invented by pickets during the Civil War. Still the
man sat on the fence.
* * *
It was night. The man on the fence was thinking.
His name was Lippett. He loved Maronet. Maronet
lived inside in the gloomy house, outside of which the
man sat on the picket fence.
* * *
Lippett was poor, Heroes are always poor. Maronet
opened a window and threw a clock at Lippett. "Time
to move," he chortled. He got off the fence and walked
away. A hint was enough for him.
» * •
Lippett knew he needed money to marry Maronet. -He
had guessed it from her conversation. She told him so.
He went off to earn money.
• * * *
In two years Lippett returned in a handsome car with
a uniformed chat'feur. Two attendants rode beside the
driver. But Maronet had married the Rich Merchant.
The handsome car rolled on. They were taking Lippett
to jail. It was the police patrol.

IN MEMORIAM
OLD STANFORD SPIRIT. Died
at Bleacher Rally, October, '22
• * *
Cabbages hates to hurl the old stale cabbages so often,
but it seemed like something must be done to liven up
those bleacher rallies. So here are the needed sug
gestions:
* * *
Organize co-eds football team. Have the uniforms
hand-embroidered so co-eds will be willing to appear in
them. Organize game with Milpitas Girls' School. Have
bleacher rally to send off girls to Milpitas. Provide
seating for 1,999 snakes. Give our Stanford llough
reserved seat in front row. Run in Stanford varsity
between girls' scrimmages so Rough can cheer them.
Serve tea with dash of lemon. Give one yell that
everyone knows, such as 1 Rah, Rah, Rah, Stanford!
Pass coughdrops and adjourn. Repeat as often as
necessary.
