### (By United Press 
BERLIN, Nov. 3. (United Press). â€”
Socialists moved in the Reichstag today
to block the plans of the ex-Kaiser for
presenting his bride, the Princess Her
mine, with a diadem worth 900,000,000
marks.
Deputies Braun and Wells asked ques
tions when the Chamber assembled, de
manding whether Wilhelm had applied
for an export license for the diadem and
whether he had made the proper deposit,
which would run into hundreds of mil
lions of marks. They also asked what
the government intended to do in the
event that the diadem was smuggled into
Holland.
