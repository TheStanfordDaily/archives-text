# Negative Wins Devision In Sample Bill Debate
## 
### 
R. L. Walter, '24, speaking for the
negative on the proposed Sample liill
to prohibit the practice of law and giving
of legal advice by those other than law
yers, won a decision over VV. E. Law, '24,
in a debate held at the regular meeting
of Nestoria last night. Walter used the
argument that such a bill would be im
practicable, as it would give lawyers a
monopoly by legislating people into their
offices.
Robert E. Lewis, '24, was elected vice
president, and R. L. Walter, '24, treas
urer of the society at the meeting last
night. Lewis is a member of the Stan
