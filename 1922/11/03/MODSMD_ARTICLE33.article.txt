# TROPHY OFFERED FOR INTER-CLASS FOOTBALL WINNER
## 
### 
As an indication that inter-class foot
ball has come to stay, and that it will
mean much in the life of the under
graduate unable to make the Varsity,
four members of the Board of Athletic
Control of Stanford University yester
day announced that they will present the
winning class team with a silver foot
ball. The men donating the trophy are
Dr. W. H. Barrow, Leland Cutler, J. P.
Mitchell and Dr. T. M. Williams.
The trophy will be on exhibition in
the Gymnasium next week.
Names of sixty-three picked men for
the inter-class teams are now on File
with Graduate Manager William
Fletcher, and by the lirst of next week
it is hoped to have these men out in
full uniform. With the juniors meeting
the seniors, and the frosh hooking up
with the sophs, next Saturday morning,
the respective squads will have but a
week in which to scrimmage.
The coaches of the sophs, juniors and
seniors each turned in the names of
twenty-one men, and these players will
receive equipment. The frosh, who have
been out for a month, have their equip
ment already.
The frosh team looks like a strong
candidate for the trophy. Having the
benefit of an early start and scrimmage
with the first and second frosh elevens,
the team combines experience with a
superior plan of attack. It is obviously
impossible for the other coachcs to de
velop as diversified an offensive, and a
team as well trained as these men, in
a short two weeks. The frosh, while
light, are fast and tricky. They may be
defeated, but only after a wild scramble.
