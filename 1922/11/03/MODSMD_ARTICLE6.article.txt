# 'HER HUSBAND'S WIFE' ON BOARDS TONIGHT
## Gertrude McLeod, David Mannoccir Have Leads in Amusing Comedy Opening 1922 Dramatic Season 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
The present college year's dramatic season will be opened tonight; and
from all appearances it will not require the use of a corkscrew attached to a
four-horse team.
Smoothness and rapidity in action have been achieved to such an extent
through rehearsals of "Her Husband's Wife," that the play will probably
flash under the wire in about two hours and fifteen minutes, including inter
missions. The chronic kicker who delights to knock a performance that is
long drawn-out and delayed will have to hunt for a new job tonight.
Foremost among the features of the farce is the debut of a "new guard."

Assembly Hall at 8:15. Left to right: Arthur Conover, '25; Gertrude McLeod,

Gordon Davis while the latter is tour
ing the Orient on a leave of absence,
has worked out new ideas in action
and stage setting that will have their
first chance to impress a Stanford
audience tonight. Gertrude McLeod,
*25, Elsa Barber, '25, and Arthur Con
over, '25, are making their initial cam
pus stage appearances. Emily Ward
man, '22, Tex Talbert. *22, and Dave
Mannoccir, '24, have appeared previ
ously on the Stanford stage.
As there are only six players in the
cast, tonight's performance is bound
to give each actor a chance to show
his flliility in the interpretation of
roles which must be handled carefully
to apply just the right touch. No mob
scenes or swiftly changing settings

will distract the audience's attention
from the chief characters.
As a New Dramatic Year's resolu
tion, those in charge announce that the
curtain will rise at 8:15 sharp. There
is good reason to believe that this
promise will be made good this eve
ning, so early entrance on the part of
the audience is advisable.
Of the three acts, the last is the
shortest. The ending of the play is
different from the stock "Farewell,
Horace!" which tips the onlookers off
to grab their hats and coats thirty
seconds before the curtain falls. It is
rumored that odds of 4 to 1 are being
offered any newcomer in the audience
who can tell when the finish is due to
come in half a minute.
The play itself is a typical modern
comedy in a modern setting, with em
phasis upon entangling situations that
finally work out to solution through
many humorous incidents. The asser
tion that the setting is up-to-date is
supported by the fact that the short
skirt as an indication of fashion is
dealt a death blow in the last act. The
finishing touch of realism is fortun
ately provided by the location of the
stage. The sunset is in the west.

The present college year's dramatic season will be opened tonight; and
from all appearances it will not require the use of a corkscrew attached to a
four-horse team.
Smoothness and rapidity in action have been achieved to such an extent
through rehearsals of "Her Husband's Wife," that the play will probably
flash under the wire in about two hours and fifteen minutes, including inter
missions. The chronic kicker who delights to knock a performance that is
long drawn-out and delayed will have to hunt for a new job tonight.

The players who will present "Her Husband's Wife" tonight in the
Assembly Hall at 8:15. Left to right: Arthur Conover, '25; Gertrude McLeod,

Gordon Davis while the latter is tour

As there are only six players in the
cast, tonight's performance is bound
to give each actor a chance to show
his flliility in the interpretation of
roles which must be handled carefully
to apply just the right touch. No mob
scenes or swiftly changing settings

will distract the audience's attention
from the chief characters.
As a New Dramatic Year's resolu

curtain will rise at 8:15 sharp. There
is good reason to believe that this
promise will be made good this eve

the audience is advisable.
Of the three acts, the last is the
shortest. The ending of the play is
different from the stock "Farewell,
Horace!" which tips the onlookers off
to grab their hats and coats thirty
seconds before the curtain falls. It is
rumored that odds of 4 to 1 are being
offered any newcomer in the audience
who can tell when the finish is due to
come in half a minute.
The play itself is a typical modern
comedy in a modern setting, with em

finally work out to solution through
many humorous incidents. The asser
