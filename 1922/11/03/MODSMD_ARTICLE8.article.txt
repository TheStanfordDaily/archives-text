# Bonfire Construction to Be Arranged by Freshmen
## 
### 
Organization for the construction of
the annual bonfire will be carried out
at a meeting of the freshmen called
by Class President Johnson for Mon
day at 12:45 in Room 214 of the Eng
lish building. A committee of fresh
men will be elected to work in con
junction with Gurdon Steele, '25.and
his assistant slave-drivers. All fresh
men will probably be expected to put
in 15 hours' work on the fire as was
required last year. The big bonfire will
be placed in the field where the old
library stood, in the same location as
last year.
