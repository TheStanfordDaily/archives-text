# SOCCER VARSITY TO PLAY OLYMPIC CLUB IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
Although the Olympic Club soccer
eleven has not proven itself to be in the
same class as the Stanford Varsity,
Coach Harry Maloney will play his en
tire first team when the Cards meet the
Olympics in the Stadium in Golden Gate
Park tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
So far this season the soccer team has
a clear record, and Maloney does not
intend to take any chance with the club
men.
As yet things in the forward line are
somewhat unsettled. Coach Maloney has
been trying out different combinations
during the week and has finally settled
on two alternatives. Either he will use
Franklin in the inside left position and
Quiglcy at outside left, or else he will
move Qnigley to inside left and play
Titus in the outside position. Jt is more
than likely that both combinations will
be tried out.
The second Varsity meets the Unione
Sportiva Italiana on the Stanford campus
at 3:30 Saturday. Last season the
Sportiva Club entered a team in the first
division of the University and Club
League. It finished last in the league
and failed to make any special showing.
The line-ups are as follows: Varsity,
Masters (captain), goal; Clark, Hayes,
fullbacks; Swayne, Off, Walthers, half
backs; Green, Deffcbach, Ta'am, Frank
lin, Quigley, forwards; reserve, Titus.
Second Varsity: ucncreaux, goal;
Bucklin, Howe, fullbacks; Smith, Snow,
John, halfbacks; Hall, Hamilton, Tim
mons, Cardoza, Borroughs, forwards;
reserve, Birnie.
