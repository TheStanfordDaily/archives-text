# CARD TEAM OUTCLASSES COURTWRIGHT’S WOLVES
## Fluke Gives Nevadans a Touchdown One Minute Before Close Of Half; Final Score, 17-7 
### Garrett Elmore, ’23 
For sixty minutes last Saturday the Cardinal varsity chased the Nevada
Wolves around the Stadium, and then started them back toward the Sierra
Nevadas with a 17-to-7 defeat dragging behind.
Therein is contained the conventional story of gridiron revenge; of Stan
ford's year-old desire to retaliate for that 14-to-14 draw last November.
It was a Stanford day from start to finish. In the morning George Houck,
first-string guard, who was disbarred ten days ago, received word that he had
been restored to full standing.
In the afternoon Andy Kerr's men demonstrated that while a football
machine can't be built in a month, rapid progress ca be made in two weeks.

Art Wilcox, who has played the
"hero" part before, drew the prize
number again Saturday. He kicked,
passed, received punts, and bucked the
line without a falter. In the third
quarter, the veteran half was carrying
the pigskin for five yards or more on
every other play.
It was a different Stanford eleven
from the one which beat St. Mary's 9
to 0 October 21. Nearly every play
went off with a snap, the men handled
themselves surely, and the yards came
when yards were needed. There were
still some rough edges, but plenty of
potential strength for Kerr to develop
appeared.
Once again that first quarter rush
put Stanford in the lead. Wilcox ran
back Harrison's punt to the Nevada
33-yard line; then he passed 8 yards
to Mertz. An end run, a double criss
cross, and Doughty went around Har
rison's end for 12 yards and a score.
Neyada pushed to Stanford's 28-
yard mark, as the second quarter
opened. The Cards held, but an offside
gave the Sagebrushers another chance.
They went as far as the 8-yard line,
where a pass over the line by Church
failed.
Then with a minute and a half to
go before half time, Lady Luck un
ceremoniously brought out the silver
platter and presented Captain Hobbs
of Nevada with as free a touchdown
as a gridiron player ever got. Kerr's
men were near the ..Reno-ites' .goal
when an attempted pass from Wilcox
was blocked. It fell into Hobbs' arms,
and he paced 85 yards for a score
while the Stanford roOters looked on
in dismay.
After the second quarter, the
Wolves had no chance to show their

fangs. The Cards' backs kept poking
at the weak spots in the line, while
Kerr's linesmen were persistently
breaking through and nailing "Bunny"
Hug. The little fellow could only shake
his head and look bewildered as time
after time he was thrown for a loss, or
failed to get his pass started.
Faville recovered one of Wilcox's
punts, after a Nevada man had tipped
it. Doughty made 10 yards around
right end; Cuddeback and Wilcox
added 10 more. With 2 to go on the
fourth down, Wilcox leaped high over
the pile of players, and on the next
play went through Johnston's side for
a touchdown.
Cuddeback kicked a goal from place
ment from the 15-yard line in the
middle of the fourth quarter.
Then just as things were beginning
to get dull, Kerr sent in a flock of
substitutes, among them, Guy Dennis.
The former freshman skipper dashed
through the line in a way that was a
revelation.

Art Wilcox, who is considerable of
a halfback, as certain of the Nevada
Wolves who played in the game last
Saturday will testify.
For sixty minutes last Saturday the Cardinal varsity chased the Nevada
Wolves around the Stadium, and then started them back toward the Sierra
Nevadas with a 17-to-7 defeat dragging behind.
Therein is contained the conventional story of gridiron revenge; of Stan
ford's year-old desire to retaliate for that 14-to-14 draw last November.
It was a Stanford day from start to finish. In the morning George Houck,
first-string guard, who was disbarred ten days ago, received word that he had
been restored to full standing.
In the afternoon Andy Kerr's men demonstrated that while a football
machine can't be built in a month, rapid progress ca be made in two weeks.

Art Wilcox, who has played the
"hero" part before, drew the prize
number again Saturday. He kicked,
passed, received punts, and bucked the
line without a falter. In the third
quarter, the veteran half was carrying
the pigskin for five yards or more on
every other play.
It was a different Stanford eleven
from the one which beat St. Mary's 9
to 0 October 21. Nearly every play
went off with a snap, the men handled
themselves surely, and the yards came
when yards were needed. There were
still some rough edges, but plenty of
potential strength for Kerr to develop
appeared.
Once again that first quarter rush
put Stanford in the lead. Wilcox ran
back Harrison's punt to the Nevada
33-yard line; then he passed 8 yards
to Mertz. An end run, a double criss
cross, and Doughty went around Har
rison's end for 12 yards and a score.
Neyada pushed to Stanford's 28-
yard mark, as the second quarter
opened. The Cards held, but an offside
gave the Sagebrushers another chance.
They went as far as the 8-yard line,
where a pass over the line by Church
failed.
Then with a minute and a half to
go before half time, Lady Luck un
ceremoniously brought out the silver
platter and presented Captain Hobbs
of Nevada with as free a touchdown
as a gridiron player ever got. Kerr's
men were near the ..Reno-ites' .goal
when an attempted pass from Wilcox
was blocked. It fell into Hobbs' arms,
and he paced 85 yards for a score
while the Stanford roOters looked on
in dismay.
After the second quarter, the
Wolves had no chance to show their

fangs. The Cards' backs kept poking
at the weak spots in the line, while
Kerr's linesmen were persistently
breaking through and nailing "Bunny"
Hug. The little fellow could only shake
his head and look bewildered as time
after time he was thrown for a loss, or
failed to get his pass started.
Faville recovered one of Wilcox's
punts, after a Nevada man had tipped
it. Doughty made 10 yards around
right end; Cuddeback and Wilcox
added 10 more. With 2 to go on the
fourth down, Wilcox leaped high over
the pile of players, and on the next
play went through Johnston's side for
a touchdown.
Cuddeback kicked a goal from place
ment from the 15-yard line in the
middle of the fourth quarter.
Then just as things were beginning
to get dull, Kerr sent in a flock of
substitutes, among them, Guy Dennis.
The former freshman skipper dashed
through the line in a way that was a
revelation.
