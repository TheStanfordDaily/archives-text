# CARD TEAM OUTCLASSES COURTWRIGHT’S WOLVES
## Fluke Gives Nevadans a Touchdown One Minute Before Close Of Half; Final Score, 17-7 
### Garrett Elmore, ’23 
For sixty minutes last Saturday the Cardinal varsity chased the Nevada
Wolves around the Stadium, and then started them back toward the Sierra
Nevadas with a 17-to-7 defeat dragging behind.
Therein is contained the conventional story of gridiron revenge; of Stan
ford's year-old desire to retaliate for that 14-to-14 draw last November.
It was a Stanford day from start to finish. In the morning George Houck,
first-string guard, who was disbarred ten days ago, received word that he had
been restored to full standing.
In the afternoon Andy Kerr's men demonstrated that while a football
machine can't be built in a month, rapid progress ca be made in two weeks.

Art Wilcox, who has played the
"hero" part before, drew the prize
number again Saturday. He kicked,
passed, received punts, and bucked the
line without a falter. In the third
quarter, the veteran half was carrying
the pigskin for five yards or more on
every other play.
It was a different Stanford eleven
from the one which beat St. Mary's 9
to 0 October 21. Nearly every play
went off with a snap, the men handled
themselves surely, and the yards came
when yards were needed. There were
still some rough edges, but plenty of
potential strength for Kerr to develop
appeared.
Once again that first quarter rush
put Stanford in the lead. Wilcox ran
back Harrison's punt to the Nevada
33-yard line; then he passed 8 yards
to Mertz. An end run, a double criss
cross, and Doughty went around Har
rison's end for 12 yards and a score.
Neyada pushed to Stanford's 28-
yard mark, as the second quarter
opened. The Cards held, but an offside
gave the Sagebrushers another chance.
They went as far as the 8-yard line,
where a pass over the line by Church
failed.
Then with a minute and a half to
go before half time, Lady Luck un
ceremoniously brought out the silver
platter and presented Captain Hobbs
of Nevada with as free a touchdown
