# BEITSâ€™ MEN OVERWHELM U.S.S. CAMDEN ELEVEN
## 
### 
Outclassed, outweighed, and out
fought, the U. S. S. Camden eleven lost
a one-sided game to "Red" Betts' Grays
Saturday by a score of 18-0.
The Grays played a good defensive
and displayed an offensive which was
too much for the sailors, who had
neither defensive nor offensive.
Johnny Williams at center ana Wida
rnan at end were the outstanding stars
on the defensive for the Grays, while
Erhorn and Wright made most of the
yardage for Betts' team.
Grays Gain on Bucks
McCombs returned the Sailors' kick
off to his won 35-yard line and the
Grays marched down the field on
passes and line bucks to their oppon
ents' 12-yard line where they fumbled.
The Gobs kicked to their own 27-yard
line and the Grays began another drive
with Wright tearing through the line
for substantial gains. The big fullback
finally took the ball over. Hamilton's
place kick failed.
The Grays came back strong in the
second quarter and had the ball in
the Sailors' territory most of the half.
The half ended as a forward pass to
Widaman fell incomplete over the line.
Gobs Nearly Score
At the beginning of the second half,
the Grays seemed to weaken. Loose
playing and poor tackling gave the
Sailors three successive downs and
they were within striking distance of
the Grays' goal line. Here the Grays
held and the Gobs tried a drop-kick
which was blocked. Erhorn recovered
the ball and ran 15 yards before he
was downed.
Bob Wright retired with an injured
ankle and Woodliead took his place.
Erhorn, Hamilton, and Woodhead car
ried the ball down the field on line
bucks and end runs and the quarter
ended with the ball on the Sailors'
5-yard line. Erhorn went over on the
first play in the fourth quarter. The
try for extra point failed.
Betts Sends in Subs
The Grays' last score came as the
result of a pass to Fuller which netted
25 yards, and line bucks by Woodhead
and Erhorn took the ball over. Blacker,
who substituted for Fuller at this point,
failed to add the extra point.
Betts gave most of his second string
men a chance to play in the final
period.
The Grays lined up as follows: Wil
liams, center; Hayes and Rogers,
guards; Long and McCombs, tackles;
Robinson and Widaman, ends; Erhorn
and Hamilton, halves; Fuller, quarter;
Wright, fullback.
