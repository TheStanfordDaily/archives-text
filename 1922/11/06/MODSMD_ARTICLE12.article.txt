Pictures reprinted by courtesy of the
Hoover War Library are among the fea
tures of the November Cardinal on sale

Gift," written by Dati Evans, '20, which
is the literary feature of the issue. A
painting entitled "Springtime" and an
abbey in Alsace are also reproduced.
"Impressions of France and Germany"
is written by Edward L. Beach, captain
in the U. S. N., retired, and who is now
professor of Naval history at Stanford.
"A Mad University" is a satire in drama
