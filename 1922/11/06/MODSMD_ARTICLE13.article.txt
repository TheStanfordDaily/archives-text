## 
### 
Varsity socccr men whitewashed the
Olympic Club, 5-0, in a slow game at
Golden Gate Park Stadium Saturday.
Charlie Deffebach, inside right, was
high score man, with three goals to his
credit. Ted Off, center half, and Pete
Franklin, left inside, each annexed an
other point.
It was a Cardinal victory from the out
set of the game until the final whistle.
The forwards, according to Coach Harry
Maloney, displayed better teamwork in
this game than any other time this sea
son, and close co-operation in the hack
field kept the Stanford goal clear.
Moonlight soccer did not agree with
jthe second Varsity, as it lost to the Unione
Sportiva Italiana, 1-0. The game, which
was scheduled at 3 :30, did not start until
4:45. The score which won for the
Sportiva Club came in the first few min
utes of play. It was a lucky shot and
was the only time that the club men were
near enough to the Stanford goal to
score.
