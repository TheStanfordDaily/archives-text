# KICK BY FAUST IN LAST PERIOD WINS FOR BABES AT U.S.C.
## Freshmen Have Uphill Fight to 10-9 Victory; Backs Start Final Rush 
### Phil Newill, ’23 
A final rush down Bovard field,
and a drop kick at twenty-five
yards from the reliable toe of
"Buck" Faust made the Stanford
freshmen (one-point victors over
the Trojan Babes down at Los
Angeles Saturday.
It also made them favorites by
the scantest of odds against Cali
fornia in the "Little Big Game"
this week-end.
Going into the 'game on the
short end of every predicted score,
and lacking ten pounds of an
equal weight, the Card yearlings
had an uphill fight from start to
finish. The half ended with the
score 3-0 against them. In the
third quarter they crossed the U.
S. C. line, only to see their lead
taken away in the same period by
another Trojan score.
Then, with about two more minutes
left in the fourth quarter, Hunt's back
field opened up. Solomon and Faust
bucked the ball down to within ten
yards of the last chalk line. At this
point an intercepted forward pass
robbed the Dinks of their six-point
chance, Dorsey punted out. forty-five
yards, and Bill Cook made one of his
sensational runs twenty yards back
into Trojan territory. The ball was on
the twenty-five yard line. The rest was
easy for "Buck" Faust.
Halfback Henry LeFebvre caused
the Card Babes more misery than any
other two men on the Southern squad.
It was his passing to Dorsey and Lous
talot, and his runs around end, that
brought the ball down to Stanford's
twenty-five yard line the first quarter,
and gave Dorsey a chance to drop one
over.
LeFebvre Stars For Trojans
Again in the third period LeFebvre
kept the linesmen on the jump with
his wide end runs. With Loustalot and
Adams plunging, the ball got down as
far as the ten-yard line. Here the
shifty halfback slipped around end
and over, making it 9-7, U. S. C.
Dorsey then lost the extra point and
with it the chance for a tie game.
A thirty-yard pass from Solomon to
McDermot, with Faust bucking the
ball over on the next play, gave the
Dinks their necessary touchdown in
the third session. Faust proved him
self more reliable than Dorsey on the
try for point, putting over a place
kick with ease.
U. S. C.'s 200-Pounders Stopped
The freshman line, which has caused
Hunt considerable worry in the past,
came through in great shape against
the huskies that Bill Hess put on the
field. The Trojans were forced to
passing and end runs for most of their
gains.
Ernie Nevers was taken out of the
game with a slight injury in the sec
and stanza, thus calling off the ex
pected punting duel with Gene Dorsey.

A final rush down Bovard field,
and a drop kick at twenty-five
yards from the reliable toe of
"Buck" Faust made the Stanford
freshmen (one-point victors over
the Trojan Babes down at Los
Angeles Saturday.
It also made them favorites by
the scantest of odds against Cali
fornia in the "Little Big Game"
this week-end.
Going into the 'game on the
short end of every predicted score,
and lacking ten pounds of an
equal weight, the Card yearlings
had an uphill fight from start to
finish. The half ended with the
score 3-0 against them. In the
third quarter they crossed the U.
S. C. line, only to see their lead
taken away in the same period by
another Trojan score.
Then, with about two more minutes
left in the fourth quarter, Hunt's back
field opened up. Solomon and Faust
bucked the ball down to within ten
yards of the last chalk line. At this
point an intercepted forward pass
robbed the Dinks of their six-point
chance, Dorsey punted out. forty-five
yards, and Bill Cook made one of his
sensational runs twenty yards back
into Trojan territory. The ball was on
the twenty-five yard line. The rest was
easy for "Buck" Faust.
Halfback Henry LeFebvre caused
the Card Babes more misery than any
other two men on the Southern squad.
It was his passing to Dorsey and Lous
talot, and his runs around end, that
brought the ball down to Stanford's
twenty-five yard line the first quarter,
and gave Dorsey a chance to drop one
over.
LeFebvre Stars For Trojans
Again in the third period LeFebvre
kept the linesmen on the jump with
his wide end runs. With Loustalot and
Adams plunging, the ball got down as
far as the ten-yard line. Here the
shifty halfback slipped around end
and over, making it 9-7, U. S. C.
Dorsey then lost the extra point and
with it the chance for a tie game.
A thirty-yard pass from Solomon to
McDermot, with Faust bucking the
ball over on the next play, gave the
Dinks their necessary touchdown in
the third session. Faust proved him
self more reliable than Dorsey on the
try for point, putting over a place
kick with ease.
U. S. C.'s 200-Pounders Stopped
The freshman line, which has caused
Hunt considerable worry in the past,
came through in great shape against
the huskies that Bill Hess put on the
field. The Trojans were forced to
passing and end runs for most of their
gains.
Ernie Nevers was taken out of the
game with a slight injury in the sec
and stanza, thus calling off the ex
pected punting duel with Gene Dorsey.
