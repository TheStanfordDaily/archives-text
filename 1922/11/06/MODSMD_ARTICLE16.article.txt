### Phil Newill, â€™23 
A final rush down Bovard field,
and a drop kick at twenty-five
yards from the reliable toe of
"Buck" Faust made the Stanford
freshmen (one-point victors over
the Trojan Babes down at Los
Angeles Saturday.
It also made them favorites by

and lacking ten pounds of an
equal weight, the Card yearlings

finish. The half ended with the
score 3-0 against them. In the
third quarter they crossed the U.
S. C. line, only to see their lead
taken away in the same period by
another Trojan score.
Then, with about two more minutes
left in the fourth quarter, Hunt's back
field opened up. Solomon and Faust
bucked the ball down to within ten
yards of the last chalk line. At this
point an intercepted forward pass
robbed the Dinks of their six-point
chance, Dorsey punted out. forty-five
yards, and Bill Cook made one of his
sensational runs twenty yards back
into Trojan territory. The ball was on
the twenty-five yard line. The rest was
easy for "Buck" Faust.
Halfback Henry LeFebvre caused
the Card Babes more misery than any
other two men on the Southern squad.

talot, and his runs around end, that
brought the ball down to Stanford's
twenty-five yard line the first quarter,
