# A
						SUCCESSFUL WEEK-END
## 
### 
Three football victories in one week-end is not a
record to be sneezed at. The Varsity proved in the
early part of the game with Nevada that it was
capable of playing 100 per cent football for four full
quarters. And, in addition to that, Coach Kerr was
able to hold his best stuff in reserve for the Trojans
when they come to the campus next Saturday. No
greater tribute may be paid the Varsity than to say
that every man has done and will continue to do
his best.
There's a laugh for every Stanford student in the
freshman situation. All during the summer months
newspaper men with sgft spots in their hearts for
U. S. C. or Berkeley poured forth copy on the won
derful sets of stars who were registering in those
two universities. Stanford seldom received a men
tion. In fact, Stanford wasn't thought to be in the
running. But, lo and behold, the Cardinal Babes,
without reputation or constellation, migrates into
the southland, there to make much havoc with the
many gridiron stars therein. There are several rea
sons for this, and among them is the one emphasized
by the freshman coaches all during the season.
Stanford has a freshman team comprised of eleven
football players, each of whom is a part of the whole
machine. U. S. C. had all the stars but lost some
thing of the machine in putting the stars together.
And the result is.the first freshman football victory
for Stanford for many a long moon.
"Red" Betts' Grays certainly should come in for a
word of praise, too. They have been fodder for the
Varsity so much this season that they have had little
chance to make a showing against strong opposition.
They are getting more of a chance now, however,
and should begin to show rapid improvement in
preparation for their game with the California
Goofs. Their win over the sailors last Saturday will
give them further incentive, and will make their
undergraduate backers feel all the more like boost
ing for all they are worth.
Stanford rooters have three teams to be proud of.
Let's hope that all pull together from now 011 as they
did last last Saturday.
