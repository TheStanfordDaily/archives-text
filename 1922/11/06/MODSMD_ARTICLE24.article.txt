# “COME JOIN THE BAND”

### 
It was not until the band showed up at the
bleachers last Saturday that Stanford students knew
how necessary the red-coated musicians are. Every
body realized that something was wrong, but they
never suspected for a moment that a lot of the
trouble with the rooting section was caused by the
lack of a band. Rooting without music somehow is
flat.
While we are on the subject, we might as well
admit that music without rooting is also flat. It is
with some satisfaction that students today are point
ing to Saturday's rooting section as the best of the
season, despite the lifeless start. Students are begin
ning to get wise to the fact that the bleachers have to
fight with the same untiring regularity and enthusi
asm as the men 011 the'field. And if the bleacher
spirit improves as fast as the Varsity's, Big Game
day is going to be a marvel to behold from the spec
tators' point of view.
