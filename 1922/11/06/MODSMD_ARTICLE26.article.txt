The ball was on the one-yard line. So was the
referee. It was the third down and a yard to go in one
direction or ninety-nine in the other, depending on whom
you were rooting for. The score was nothing to nothing,
and so were the teams. The goal-posts stood breathless
with suspense. The ball was snapped. The lines charged
—they were businesf-like lines. The rooting section
howled with excitement. He was easiyl excited, anyway.
It was a touchdown, beyond the shadow of a doubt. The
referee dived in to rescue the ball —but it was gone. No
ball at all. Where there ain't no football, there ain't
no touchdown. The teams drew back in dismay. The
gun went Bang, and the game was over —nothing to
nothing. And then modest little Ozzy Umplirish stepped
forth, safety-pin iii hand. "I done it,"he said, "I done
it with my little safety-pin. Look me over." And once
more the Ultramarine and Saffron serpentined.

"Did you ever keep a candy store?"
"No, but I've helped a lot."

With this issue Cabbages inaugurates the Oldest Joke
Campaign. Mid-Victorian, one point; Elizabethan, three
points; Renaissance, five points. For instance: (Mid-
Victorian) :
"Young man, do you drink?"
"Yes, I go to Stanford."

Elizabethan:
It will be a long time till Chicago Staggs it to another
Princeton game.

Renaissance:
"Gimme a kiss, kid."
"Gwan. These kisses are fifty cents a pound. Think
we make this candy to give away?"

Anyone presenting a genuine dyed-in-the-wool Early
Venetian joke, with no trace of circulation after the
twelfth century, will be awarded a handsome quartzite
loving cup. (Economics department jokes positively

forth, safety-pin iii hand. "I done it,"he said, "I done
it with my little safety-pin. Look me over." And once

direction or ninety-nine in the other, depending on whom
you were rooting for. The score was nothing to nothing,

referee dived in to rescue the ball —but it was gone. No

forth, safety-pin iii hand. "I done it,"he said, "I done
