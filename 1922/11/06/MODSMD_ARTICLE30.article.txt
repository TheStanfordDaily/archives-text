# Pittsburg 62, Geneva 0
## 
### 
Glen Warner's Pittsburg Panthers
.scored an easy victory over Geneva
College, running up 62 to 0 score mainly
through line plunges and end runs.
Geneva made first downs only once dur
ing the entire game and at no time
threatened the Panther's goal. Warner
sent in a team in the second half which
was composed mostly of substitutes. The
Pitt line showed more driving power
than it has shown in any game this sea
son.
