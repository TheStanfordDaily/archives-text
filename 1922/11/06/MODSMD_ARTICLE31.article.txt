# Multnomah Club 6, Oregon Aggies 0
## 
### 
The Multnomah Club of Portland de
feated the Oregon Aggie eleven 6 to 0.
Multnomah's touchdown came in the
fourth period and was the result of an
Oregon Aggie punt blocked behind the
Aggie's goal line, where it was recovered
by a Mulnomah player. A piece of poor
headwork on the part of Quarterback
Garber of the Oregon Aggies made the
blocked kick possible. Standing on his
own 7 yard line, he caught a Multnomah
punt that would otherwise have rolled
over the line for a touchback and no
score.
