To the Editor: â€”
During the number of years I have
been at Stanford, I never saw a man fail
to remove his hat when "Hail Stanford,
Hail" was sung until last Saturday in
the Stadium. It was not absent minded
ness that caused this discourtesy. The
man was asked to remove his hat, but
sneered and walked away with his com
panion. This fellow's name is Donahoe;
he is a fraternity man, drives an ; mo
mobile, and is registered in the Law
school. If his fraternity does not take
action on this matter, it would be too bad
if somebody else didn't.
