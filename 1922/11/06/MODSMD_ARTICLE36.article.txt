# “OLD BOY” CALLS FOR EARLY CONTRIBUTIONS TO FOOTBALL ISSUE
## 
### 
The coming issue of Chappie, out the
day of the Big Game, will have the ab
surd title of "Football Issue." Copy must
be in on the 11th of this month—and lots
of it. Art work is chiefly wanted, with
the football "moteef," of course promi
nent.
Contributions to Chappie will all count
011 the Old Boy's beauteous silver cup in
a most generous manner. Freshmen, even
those who would use the cup for a flower
vase if they won it, are wanted on the
contributors' list. There must be some
spark of humor among the gray-domed
ones, and the Old Boy would like to see
it come out. New contributors swinging
a mean drawing pencil will also be wel
comed with open arms.
It is urgent that copy be in by Satur
day night, especially cover designs and
other art work.
