# U.S.C. Trains Hard For Coming Battle Against Card Varsity Saturday
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES.â€”Although the Uni
yersity of Southern California fell be
fore the onslaught of California's Golden
Bears a week ago Saturday at Pasadena,
even in that defeat the Trojans recog
nized their strength.
For three years the Bears have for
aged on the fat of the Pacific Coast grid
iron world and for the same length of
time no pigskin machine has been able
to get closer than 14 points to the cham
pions. The Trojans fought their way
through three quarters while the score
stood 2-0, and only after the tearing
plunges of Morrison had been sent
against the Trojan line was California
able to rush over ten other digits.
But now the fracas has been fought and
the best team won. "Goomy" Gus has
counted his casualties, and been beef
steaking black eyes and preparing for
Stanford, Idaho, and Washington State.
Right now Henderson is having a hard
time because the morale of the squad
is at its lowest point and it will take a
full week of intensive training to get
them up to a pitch to be ready to receive
all the fine points of the Warner system
and Stanford's own interpretation of it.
"Ironsides", Baker, who made his debut
in football circles in the game a week
ago, gave the natives a thrill as well as
something to talk about. Baker has been
used but a very minutes in the earlier
games and was the enigma of Hender
son's backfield. He was thrown into the
fray from the very start and lasted the
first quarter, carrying the ball three
times. But during those three times he
made a total of sixty-nine yards, which
was not so bad for an enigma. After
the first period he was taken out because
of injuries.
Although Baker is still suffering from
the effects of his injuries, he will be able
to play in the Stanford game. Gordon
Campbell. Henderson's mainstay in the
California game, received a broken finger
and Chet Dollev is walking around with
a cracked rib. Outside of the aforemen
tioned men the rest of the team is ready
to take on the Turk army for 0 scrim
mage.
With the Occidental game behind them
now and a victory of 46-0 tucked away,
the Trojans are preparing for the next
conference game which happens to be the
Stanford duel at Palo Alto November
11. Since their first league battle turned
out to be a defeat the Trojans want to
make the score read 50-50, and somebody's
go to be the goat. Right now it looks
like Stanford University is it.
