# MADAME D’ALVAREZ TO GIVE OPERATIC ARIAS
## 
### 
The program to be sung on Thursday
evening in the Stanford Assembly hall
as the initial concert of the Peninsula
Musical Association series is intended
to give the audience an adequate idea of
the art and special qualities of Madame
Marguerite D'Alvarez, in that it contains
operatic arias, a group of French songs
(in the interpretation of which she ex
cels), and three Spanish songs which
should be particularly interesting in view
of her Spanish ancestry. Her accom
panist, Lois Muier, will furnish a group
of piano numbers in the middle of the
program.
As Madame D'Alvarez is not due to
arrive in San Francisco from Australia
until Tuesday, there may be"changes from

acompanist; but the one submitted to the
local management is as follows:
