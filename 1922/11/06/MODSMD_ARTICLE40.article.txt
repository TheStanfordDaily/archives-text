# Late Shipment of Holes Postpones Doughnut Sale
## 
### 
Attention, ye with a collegiate hunger!
The Theta Sigma Phi doughnut sale,
which was scheduled for Wednesday, has
been postponed until Tuesday, Novem
ber 14.
Think well upon the luscious brown
morsels of joy, made from the secret
recipe of this organization, and then obey
that impulse a week from Tuesday.
