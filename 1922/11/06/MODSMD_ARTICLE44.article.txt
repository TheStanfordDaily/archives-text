# CLASS ELEVENS TO RECEIVE SUITS FOR FIRST SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
Members of the class football teams
which will clash Saturday morning in the
first round of the inter-class schedule
were given their uniforms this afternoon
and have started a week of intensive
practice. But five days of scrimmage re
main before seniors meet juniors and
sophs tangle with the freshmen.
Sixty-three uniforms were given out,
each of the three upper classes receiving
twenty-one. The frosh will retain the
red jerseys and other equipment which
they have been using since school opened.
The sophomores received black jerseys,
and the juniors blue with white arm
bands. Gray is the senior color scheme.
While the Babes have been scrimmag
ing for weeks, the other three teams will
be given their first baptism of this sort
today. The student coaches had their
men going through signal practice last
week, but the work was light when com
pared to the* hard knocks which are in
store for them from now on. Each coach
has enough men out to form two scrim
mage lines, and the seniors plan to go a
step farther and engage the "Goofs" for
an afternoon.
