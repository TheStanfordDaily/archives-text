# Hobo Poet Is Slightly Late for Appointment At Oregon University
## 
### 
What's a mere thirty days to a vaga
bond poet? Not for vagrancy; late, â€”
for an appointment.
Vachel Lindsay, nationally known be
cause of his propensity for tramping
through the country districts, trading his
rhymes for bread, was to appear at the
University of Oregon October 28. All
preparations were made for the bard's
reception by the Associated Students, for
whom he was to recite, when word was
received from Lindsay's manager that a
slight mistake had been made in the time.
He would arrive November 28 instead.
Perhaps Vachel's feet aren't going as
smoothly as a poet's should. At any rate,
though he may be good at meters, he is
certainly poor on mileage.
