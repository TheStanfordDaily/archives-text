# WHEN IS A PAGEANT NOT A PAGEANT? WHEN IT HAS A NEW NAME
## 
### 
What is a pageant? That is, how can
you tell a pageant from something that
isn't? Women at California call the fete
a Partheneia. At Stanford they call it
■—but there's the rub. There isn't any
name.
.The Women's Athletic Association is
asking for a name for the annual spring
pageant presented by the women of the
University. Last year's was called "The
Coronation of Randalin," but the fete
itself was unnamed. All men and women
who think they have a suitable name are
asked to communicate with Eunice Bid
die, '24, president of W. A. A.
