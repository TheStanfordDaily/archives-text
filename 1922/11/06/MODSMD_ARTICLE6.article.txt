# NEW PLAY STARTS DRAMATIC SEASON OFF AUSPICIOUSLY
## “Her Husband’s Wife” Pleases Audience; Directing, Acting Done Consistently Well 
### Carl Shoup, ’24 
An auspicious opening for the 1922-
23 campus dramatic season was given
by Sword and Sandals' presentation of
*<Her Husband's Wife" Friday eve
ning. There may have been room for

this attitude she did maintain, giving
what was probably the best character
portrayal of the evening.

heights of happiness ensuant upon an
overdose of furniture polish. Too much
exaggeration would have ruined the
part, but Conover managed to reach a
high degree of excitement and still
make it seem real.
The part of Richard Beklen, al
though not calling for any extreme
character peculiarities, was not dull,
as such parts sometimes are. Paul
Talbert, '22, by his careful attention
