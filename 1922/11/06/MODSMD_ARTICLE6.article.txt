# NEW PLAY STARTS DRAMATIC SEASON OFF AUSPICIOUSLY
## “Her Husband’s Wife” Pleases Audience; Directing, Acting Done Consistently Well 
### Carl Shoup, ’24 
An auspicious opening for the 1922-
23 campus dramatic season was given
by Sword and Sandals' presentation of
*<Her Husband's Wife" Friday eve
ning. There may have been room for
doubt before the performance as to
how the "new guard" would show
itself in its initial performance, but
there was none when the curtain went
down on the last act.
Characterizations Clever
Happily for everyone's peace of
mind, no one character stood out head
and shoulders above the others. What
was billed as the "woman's lead", the
part of Irene Randolph, was handled
by Gertrude McLeod, '25, in a manner
that showed close attention to details.
Facial expression and general attitude
were as important in this part as was
the manner of speaking, and by well
chosen efforts in this line, Miss Mc-
Leod kept alive the few moments in
the play that threatened to drag.
The other feminine lead, that of
Emily Ladew, had a consistent per
former in Emily Wardman, '22. She
had a certain attitude to maintain
throughout the play, despite her
change from "dowdy" to "viper," and
this attitude she did maintain, giving
what was probably the best character
portrayal of the evening.
Furniture Polish Brings Joy
Arthur Conover, '25, as Stuart Ran
dolph, presented a convincing display
of the primary -emotions ranging from
violent despair and anger to the
heights of happiness ensuant upon an
overdose of furniture polish. Too much
exaggeration would have ruined the
part, but Conover managed to reach a
high degree of excitement and still
make it seem real.
The part of Richard Beklen, al
though not calling for any extreme
character peculiarities, was not dull,
as such parts sometimes are. Paul
Talbert, '22, by his careful attention
to details, infused life into a role that
might otherwise have made the cash
customers wonder what it was for. But j
In justice to the part, it was certainly j
essential—a campus show with only
six characters is not likely to be re- ;
garded as being crowded with super
fluous actors.
Mannoccir in Difficult Role
One of the hardest character parts
of the evening went to David Man
noccir, '24, in the role of Uncle John. \
Mannoccir's easy-going mjanner put
Uncle John right at home with the
audience, and quite overbalanced what
criticism there was on his use of too
much in the way of gestures and in- I
sufficient articulation. Uncle John, as .
played by Mannoccir, can well be re- |
membered by all future Uncle Johns
as a good example to follow.
Elsa Barber, '25, as Nora, created
interest every time she came on the
stage. Especially pleasing to the audi
ence was her skillfully mixed attitude
of respectful doubt and disapproval—
and her aunouncement of the "osty
path."
Coaching Cause of Success
Back of all this good performance
lies the cocahing, and no one who
saw both the rehearsals and the show
can doubt that Richard Bentinck has
carved a good roomy niche for him
self in the hearts of campus theatre
goers. The little details of imperfec
tion Tnat so often mar a performance
were evidently away for a vacation,
prescribed by Bentinck, for during the
rehearsals he patiently ironed out all
the wrinkles that might disfigure the
face of the show.
The technical staff deserves credit
for the faithful work it put in 011
the stage setting and lighting. The
finished effect of both setting and
lighting was not up to the standard
of campus shows, but that was not
due to lack of effort on the part of
those concerned. Rather it was due
to an experiment, which did not come
through perfectly, as many experi
ments have a way of doing. John
Richer, new business manager of the
Dramatic Council, handled the finances
for the performance. Clyde Coakley
was once again at his familiar job of
stage manager. William Lucas had
charge of the properties, while Samuel
Vaughan assisted Coakley in manag
ing. Chrysella Dunker furnished ma
terial aid as "technical director." Stod
dard Atwood had charge of the post
which Carroll Hudson used to fre
quent —that of head electrician. All the
scenery and draperies were con
structed by the Theatrical Workshop
class.

of the primary -emotions ranging from
violent despair and anger to the
heights of happiness ensuant upon an
overdose of furniture polish. Too much
exaggeration would have ruined the
part, but Conover managed to reach a
high degree of excitement and still
make it seem real.
The part of Richard Beklen, al
though not calling for any extreme
character peculiarities, was not dull,
as such parts sometimes are. Paul
Talbert, '22, by his careful attention
to details, infused life into a role that
might otherwise have made the cash
customers wonder what it was for. But j
In justice to the part, it was certainly j
essential—a campus show with only
six characters is not likely to be re- ;
garded as being crowded with super
fluous actors.
Mannoccir in Difficult Role
One of the hardest character parts
of the evening went to David Man
noccir, '24, in the role of Uncle John. \
Mannoccir's easy-going mjanner put
Uncle John right at home with the
audience, and quite overbalanced what
criticism there was on his use of too
much in the way of gestures and in- I
sufficient articulation. Uncle John, as .
played by Mannoccir, can well be re- |
membered by all future Uncle Johns
as a good example to follow.
Elsa Barber, '25, as Nora, created
interest every time she came on the
stage. Especially pleasing to the audi
ence was her skillfully mixed attitude
of respectful doubt and disapproval—
and her aunouncement of the "osty
path."
Coaching Cause of Success
Back of all this good performance
lies the cocahing, and no one who
saw both the rehearsals and the show
can doubt that Richard Bentinck has
carved a good roomy niche for him
self in the hearts of campus theatre
goers. The little details of imperfec
tion Tnat so often mar a performance
were evidently away for a vacation,
prescribed by Bentinck, for during the
rehearsals he patiently ironed out all
the wrinkles that might disfigure the
face of the show.
The technical staff deserves credit
for the faithful work it put in 011
the stage setting and lighting. The
finished effect of both setting and
lighting was not up to the standard
of campus shows, but that was not
due to lack of effort on the part of
those concerned. Rather it was due
to an experiment, which did not come
through perfectly, as many experi
ments have a way of doing. John
Richer, new business manager of the
Dramatic Council, handled the finances
for the performance. Clyde Coakley
was once again at his familiar job of
stage manager. William Lucas had
charge of the properties, while Samuel
Vaughan assisted Coakley in manag
ing. Chrysella Dunker furnished ma
terial aid as "technical director." Stod
dard Atwood had charge of the post
which Carroll Hudson used to fre
quent —that of head electrician. All the
scenery and draperies were con
structed by the Theatrical Workshop
class.
An auspicious opening for the 1922-
23 campus dramatic season was given
by Sword and Sandals' presentation of
*<Her Husband's Wife" Friday eve
ning. There may have been room for
doubt before the performance as to
how the "new guard" would show
itself in its initial performance, but
there was none when the curtain went
down on the last act.
Characterizations Clever
Happily for everyone's peace of
mind, no one character stood out head
and shoulders above the others. What
was billed as the "woman's lead", the
part of Irene Randolph, was handled
by Gertrude McLeod, '25, in a manner
that showed close attention to details.
Facial expression and general attitude
were as important in this part as was
the manner of speaking, and by well
chosen efforts in this line, Miss Mc-
Leod kept alive the few moments in
the play that threatened to drag.
The other feminine lead, that of
Emily Ladew, had a consistent per
former in Emily Wardman, '22. She
had a certain attitude to maintain
throughout the play, despite her
change from "dowdy" to "viper," and
this attitude she did maintain, giving
what was probably the best character
portrayal of the evening.

Arthur Conover, '25, as Stuart Ran
dolph, presented a convincing display
of the primary -emotions ranging from
violent despair and anger to the
heights of happiness ensuant upon an
overdose of furniture polish. Too much
