## 
### 
It would seem that Sir Arthur Conan
Doyle is about to be vindicated in his
long fight to convince a derisive and
skeptical world of the existence of the
subtle and elusive ectoplasm. The cre
ator of the famous deducer has had to
turn the other cheek a good many times

stitution as Stanford is being forced to
accept his views.
An object long mourned as departed
forever has again been seen in our midst.
Whether the manifestation is really so
lidified ectoplasm or is just a common
ordinary reincaration has not yet been
determined, however. Many years it ob
structed the parking place before the
post-office, but in this latter life it is
fulfilling a far more ornamental and less
function.
Yes, the old P. O. flagpole has been
repainted, and is to grace the R. O. T. C.
Polo field.
