# JUNIOR ELEVEN WORKS HARD FOR FIRST GAME
## 
### Maxwell Stiles, â€™25 
An exceedingly squat figure wearing
tortoise-rimmed "specs," and a crav
atine pulled up snug about his thick
throat, placed his hands on his spread
out knees and peered through the hazy
drizzle of the rain yesterday afternoon.
From the sidelines of the crude grid
iron he presented an arabesque ap
pearance, and it was certainly a mot
ley bunch of athletes he was looking at,
A series of signals and the athletes
leaped forward from their crouching
position; Emmett Sappington, coach
of the Junior class football team,
skidded back in a frantic effort to get
out of the way.
And then he squatted down on his
haunches again and the performance
was repeated, until darkness inter
vened.
All of which means that these pesky
Juniors are out in spite of rain, cold
and soupy turf to defeat the Seniors
in their first inter-class game of the
schedule Saturday morning. Aside
from the Frosh, who are always out,
the Juniors were the only team which
could be located yesterday evening.
The Seniors and Sophomores either
hied themselves to parts unbeknown,
or were kept indoors by the rueful
weather.

SQUAD LOOKS GOOD
Seriously, Sappington appears to
have the goods. The team averages
about 165 pounds in weight, a medium
between the light Frosh and 180-pound
Seniors. Whatever the advantage the
class of '24 concedes in weight will be
made up in grim determination, if we
may judge by last night's exhibition.
There they were, all alone and all very
wet, smeared with everything from
grime to smiles. They worked hard
and earnestly and when they stopped
it was so dark that the varsity, prac
ticing on the adjoining field, were
working under electric lights.
COACH EXPERIENCED PLAYER
Sappington, the coach, seemed to
know what he was doing and why. By
getting right out in front of the play,
seemingly at the risk of his life, he
was able to see just what was going
on. From the remarks and corrections
which he made, it was evident that he
was 110 blind man, either. Sappington
has had a wide range of experience
and knows the game. He played four
years on the Boise high school team,
champions of the State of Idaho. In
1915 he was captain and quarterback
of the University of California frosh.
After playing two years in the army,
he entered Stanford.
The line-up which will start Satur
day has not definitely been selected.
Walters, who weighs 180 pounds, will
start at center. There are four likely
candidates for guard positions. These
are Bill Irwin, 165 pounds; H. Kirk,
145 pounds; K. Koppock, 160 pounds,
and Tognazzini, 165 pounds.
The tackles are A. Crawford and R.
Koppock, both 160 pounds. Charles
Baker, 150, and "Dutch" Kauffman,
150, are the ends.
Quarterback "Nip" McHose is a
regular phantom. His speed last night
was dazzling, and he followed his in
terference perfectly. He only weighs
about 140 pounds, but he is the fastest
man we have lamped out there on the
inter-class gridiron yet.
