# Stanford Affirmative Wins; Negative Loses
## Southern Speakers Lose Debate to John Hall and Robert Lewis 
### 
Cardinal debaters arguing that the
proposed water and power act should
be enacted defeated the University of
Southern California team by a unani
mous decision in the Assembly hall
last night. At the same time Stanford's
negative speakers lost to the Uni
versity of California in San Francisco.
John Hall and Robert Lewis were
the Stanford affirmative team that
won the decision from the southern
debaters. Edward Landels and Matliew
Tobringer argued against California.
At the Scottish Rite Auditorium one
judge, the Southern California debate
coach, rendered the decision. Cali
fornia was expected to provide two
other judges, but none appeared.
Associate Justice William P. Lawlor
of the State Supreme Court, Professor
Arnold Perstein, the University of
California debate coach, and the Rev
erend George Pollard of the Palo Alto
Baptist Church rendered the decision
between Stanford and U. S. C.
AN AGRICULTURAL PROBLEM
John Hall opened the debate for
the affirmative. He maintained that the
proposed legislation was essentially
an agricultural problem. Irrigation is

badly needed oil many acres of tillable
land in California, and private corpora
tions cannot and will not enter the
field, the federal government is unable
to undertake the project of providing
water for these lands and therefore
"the state is the only agent that can
step into the breach," according to
Hall.
Roy Reames, the first Southern Cali
fornia speaker, asserted that all of the
power resources were being developed
bv private corporations, under state
control, and that this method is suc
cessful. He maintained also that the
adoption of the amendment would be
financially unsound and that the
amendment practically turns the state
over to a commission of five men.
The case of the affirmative was con
tinued by Robert Lewis. If the proposal
is enacted it will not upset the present
system but it will supplement and co
ordinate the institutions which we al
ready have. According to Lewis every
municipality in the state which has
tried municipal ownership and dis
tribution of water and power has re
ceived lower rates than were previous
ly in effect.
BOARD'S POWER UNLIMITED
Constructive argument for the neg
ative was completed by Louis D'Elia,
who argued that the act does not speci
fy definitely where or for what the
funds are to be expended and that to
pass the act is in fact to turn over
to the commission half a billion dollars
!o spend as it desires. "The board has
more taxing power than the state legis
lature," he said.
In rebuttal the negative continued
to discuss the extravagant grants of
power which, they said, would be
granted to an appointed committee of
five men by this act.
Stanford's refutation that excessive
powers were granted to the commis
sion was that these powers were no
greater than those enjoyed by many
other California State commissions,
the affirmative also pointed out that
five hundred million is the maximum
amount that can be expended and that
not one dollar can be appropriated
without proving the necessity of the
project.
