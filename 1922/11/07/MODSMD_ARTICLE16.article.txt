# CALIFORNIA GOOFS TO MEET GRAYS AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## 
### 
, "Red" Betts is well satisfied with the
showing his Grays made against the U.
S. S. Camden eleven last Saturday. He
told the team so last night.
With the California Goof contest set
for next Saturday, the Grays have very
little time to congratulate themselves on
past performances, however, and Betts
had his men running through signal prac
tice last night. They will not serve as
opposition to the Varsity this week, but
will spend all their time perfecting tl«cir
defense and offense for the California
game, which will be played as a prel'm
inary to the "Big Liitlc Game."
Bob Wright, the big fullback who
played havoc with the sailors' line last
Saturday, seems to be the only cripple
on the squad at the present time. Bob's
ankle is in pretty bad shape and the big
fellow may not be in shape for next Sat
urday's game. If Wright is not able
to play, the Grays' chances to beat the
Blue and Gold will be greatly lessened
for he is a valuable man when it comes
to carrying the ball and is improving on
the defensive.
The California Goofs beat the Marines
14-13 last Saturday. This means nothing
to the Grays in spite of the fact that the
Marines tramped on them to the tune of
20-0 two weeks ago. The Giays die! not
start to play football until the second half
of the Marine game and when their de
fensive got into action they held the Ma
rines scoreless for two periods. Betts'
men are expecting a hard battle Satur
day, however, and are working hard to
win their last and most important game
of the season.
