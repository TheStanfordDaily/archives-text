# FIGHTING THE OPPOSITION'S BATTLES
## 
### 
Stanford supporters are trying to convince them
selves that Pittsburgh will turn out to be the strong
est team in the East. Meanwhile, California, ex
pecting' to be the Conference choice for the game
with Penn State at Pasadena, is doing everything
in her power to point out her probable opponent as
the best of the Eastern lot.
In the midst of this publicity favoring the opposi
tion comes a message from the East from Warren
Brown, former sporting editor of the San Francisco
Call, pointing out facts that refute all the evidence
either Stanford or California has been able to pile
up. Brown seems to think that either Lafayette or
Washington and Jefferson will be the best of them
all before the season ends.
"And so the triangular battle goes on, despite the
Fact that none of the games are to be for champion
ships of any conference or section. About the only
thing for people on either side to do is to sit back
and wait for results rather than to build up for their
opponents a nice reputation in order to try to knock
it down again. >
