# SNORES DIMINISH

### 
Rooters are waking up. The vocal showing in last
Saturday's bleachers was a sight for sore eyes, a
sound for sore ears, and a cure for chronic pes
simism. Although there seemed to be a little diffi
culty at first, probably because of the fact that so
many had been slumbering so long and so loud, the
finals were pretty good. If this keeps up, the
bleacher stunts and the yells for the Big Game may
approach normal after all.
