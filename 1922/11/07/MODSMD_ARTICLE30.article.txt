Lurline's Wooing
(A story with a moral)
Lurline sat at the piano in the parlor, allowing her
taper fingers, which were modeled after those in Cutex
ads, to stray idly over the keys. Lurline was utterly
absorbed, nay, almost blotted completely out, by her
music; all her senses were numbed by the passionate
outburst of sound. As she sat there, Bytliwiek Herring
bone, son of the millionaire bookmark manufacturer,
stole into the room. Lurline, not knowing that the man
whose pocketbook she loved was standing by her side,
continued to play. But at last Bythwick placed his hand
gently on her shoulder, and by that indefinable sense
that tells us of a human presence, she knew somebody
was around.
* • *
CHAPTER TWO
Lurline turned quickly and blushed deeply at her
lover. After the usual casual greetings were over,
Bythwick said:
"Cannot you favor me with something more?"
Lurline looked at him in the frank, open way in which
Roble girls ask for more pie.
"I can play but one tune," she cried sadly.
"Are you sure?" cried Bythwick. "Then you must be
my wife. Do you love me?"
For answer Lurline Loosehair flowed into his arms.
* * *
CHAPTER THREE
Presently Bythwick arose to go. "You will come again
tomorrow?" she asked.
"Yes," he replied. "You may tie the dog at eight."
"And you will never regret your choice?"
"Never. All my life I have wanted a girl who knew
but one tune on the piano!"
» * *
"It's a mean wife," said the campus sage, as he tried
to decide on which cap in the Libe book racks would
fit him best, "who will knit her brows when her husband
asks her to darn his socks."

The Test of Love
Whenever I'm about to fall,
Into sweet Cupid's sugared thrall,
There is a little test, I find,
Which chills the heart, and clears the mind,
No matter what you do, or say,
Remember that, some future day,
The girl you know, like many other,
Will grow to look just like her mother.

absorbed, nay, almost blotted completely out, by her
music; all her senses were numbed by the passionate
outburst of sound. As she sat there, Bytliwiek Herring
bone, son of the millionaire bookmark manufacturer,
stole into the room. Lurline, not knowing that the man
whose pocketbook she loved was standing by her side,
continued to play. But at last Bythwick placed his hand
gently on her shoulder, and by that indefinable sense
that tells us of a human presence, she knew somebody
was around.

CHAPTER TWO
Lurline turned quickly and blushed deeply at her
lover. After the usual casual greetings were over,
Bythwick said:
"Cannot you favor me with something more?"
Lurline looked at him in the frank, open way in which
Roble girls ask for more pie.
"I can play but one tune," she cried sadly.
"Are you sure?" cried Bythwick. "Then you must be
my wife. Do you love me?"
For answer Lurline Loosehair flowed into his arms.

CHAPTER THREE
Presently Bythwick arose to go. "You will come again
tomorrow?" she asked.
"Yes," he replied. "You may tie the dog at eight."
"And you will never regret your choice?"
"Never. All my life I have wanted a girl who knew
but one tune on the piano!"

"It's a mean wife," said the campus sage, as he tried
to decide on which cap in the Libe book racks would
fit him best, "who will knit her brows when her husband
asks her to darn his socks."

The Test of Love
Whenever I'm about to fall,
Into sweet Cupid's sugared thrall,
There is a little test, I find,
Which chills the heart, and clears the mind,
No matter what you do, or say,
Remember that, some future day,
The girl you know, like many other,
Will grow to look just like her mother.

Lurline's Wooing
(A story with a moral)
Lurline sat at the piano in the parlor, allowing her
taper fingers, which were modeled after those in Cutex
ads, to stray idly over the keys. Lurline was utterly
absorbed, nay, almost blotted completely out, by her
music; all her senses were numbed by the passionate
outburst of sound. As she sat there, Bytliwiek Herring
bone, son of the millionaire bookmark manufacturer,
stole into the room. Lurline, not knowing that the man
