That freshman game down south might
just as well have been labeled "David vs.
Goliath," with David, as usual, on the
long end of the score—though by a bigger
margin than the 10-9 total indicated.
( The Card Babes, outweighed by ten
pounds at the outset, fought and suc
cessfully held all the beef U. S. C. had
before the game was over. Coach Bill
Hess sent a moose named Hicks in at
guard in the second half, who scaled at
218. Opposed to him was Cleo Davis,
Hunt's 154-pound guard. The first play
after the big Hicks lined up was sent
through him for about seven yards. Davis
continued to upset his man until the end
of the game.

So hard did that freshman line and
the tacklers hit that the Trojan greens
were constantly yelling for time out. They
could not gain through the line, their
forward passes were smothered by Hunt's
defense system, and nearly every time
Quarterback Loustalot sent his speed
burner, LeFebvre, around end he was
dropped so suddenly as to be out of the
play for a few downs. At that, the rec
ords show that LeFebvre got most of the
Trojan yardage.

On the other hand, Hunt's legionaries
made most of their gains on straight
bucks. In the second half the hall was
constantly in enemy territory, and only
the adverse break of an intercepted pass
ten yards from goal prevented a 14-9
finale.

After Nevers left the game in the sec
ond quarter, with Faust replacing, Bill
Cook did the booting, and did it so well
that Gene Dorsey, the widely heralded
fifty-yard punter, was crowded to keep
up with him.

"Bunny" Hug, who might qualify as
world's champion lightweight halfback,
ooked, ran and passed like "Rabbit" Brad
shaw, but he failed to raise the latter's
brand of havoc. In the third quarter Sat
urday Hug was thrown for about as
many yards as he gained. Lawson, Mertz,
Cravens and Johnston each took a turn
at nailing the small Nevadan behind the
line.

Guy Dennis. That name sounds famil
iar. It takes one back to last year when
the "fighting Irishman" from Los An
geles was bucking the line for Seay's
1925 freshmen. Dennis was handicapped
to a certain extent by injuries, but he
shared the burden of the backfield work
witli Cuddeback. Until the closing min
utes Saturday, he had been little heard
of, or little talked of. His sensational
line-plunging, whether due to the fact
that the Nevadans were tired, or to his
own "fight," made him the "discovery" of
the game.

Scranton, Wolf halfback, was about the
only one that could do anything with the
Card defense, and he was stopped short
inside Stanford's 20-yard line. Two suc
cessful forward passes, each about twenty
yards, gave the Nevadans more yardage
than a dozen line bucks.

Just at present Andy Kerr can forget
about half his guard candidates and still
have enough left to get along with. The
return of George Houck raises the num
ber on the first string to five. In addi
tion to Houck. there are Faville, who just
now is going like that famous cyclone.
Phoney, Cravens, and Douglass.

Dud DeGroot saved yardage few* Kerr's
team Saturday. On several ocasions some
linesman was over-eager, and most of
the others charged, but the Card captain
hung on the ball, bringing everyone back
again. DeGroot runs good interference,
as Umpire Korbelt will testify. He just
about knocked the white-trousered gen
tleman from his feet with some well
aimed clipping.

DeGroot is fairly fast, but Hug is
faster. The big center blocked one of
Harrison's punts and had a lead on the
field chasing the pigskin. Hug was after
him in a split second and passed both De-
Groot and Shipkey, saving about a sure
touchdown.

Nevada students are nothing if not
patriotic. There were over a hundred of
them at the game, and a few paid their
fares down from Reno. Twenty-six of
the number chose the box-car route, but
unkind "brakies" put them off in the
Sierras.

"Red" Betts' "pushed-arounds" are rap
idly coming into their own. They have

ceased being a work-horse for the Var
sity, and are working up an offense for
their big game of the season next Satur
day at Berkeley. During the month just
past the Grays have learned over a hun
dred plays for use against the Varsity in
practice. The set was changed every
week, and none was learned well.

Despite the fact that they have changed
mightily since the first days of the sea
son, the Grays are a capable outfit. Moe
Sax, quarterback, has wandered to other
universities, Oliva, end, is out for basket
ball, and Jake Irwin, tackle, is instruct
ing the third string freshmen. But
Erhorn, Wright, Hamilton, and Wood
head, backfield men, show Varsity prom
ise for next year. Then at center there
is Williams, and at end Widaman.

Hunt's 154-pound guard. The first play
after the big Hicks lined up was sent
through him for about seven yards. Davis
continued to upset his man until the end
of the game.

So hard did that freshman line and
the tacklers hit that the Trojan greens
were constantly yelling for time out. They
could not gain through the line, their
forward passes were smothered by Hunt's
defense system, and nearly every time
Quarterback Loustalot sent his speed
burner, LeFebvre, around end he was
dropped so suddenly as to be out of the
play for a few downs. At that, the rec
ords show that LeFebvre got most of the
Trojan yardage.

On the other hand, Hunt's legionaries
made most of their gains on straight
bucks. In the second half the hall was
constantly in enemy territory, and only
the adverse break of an intercepted pass
ten yards from goal prevented a 14-9
finale.

After Nevers left the game in the sec
ond quarter, with Faust replacing, Bill
Cook did the booting, and did it so well
that Gene Dorsey, the widely heralded
fifty-yard punter, was crowded to keep
up with him.

"Bunny" Hug, who might qualify as
world's champion lightweight halfback,
ooked, ran and passed like "Rabbit" Brad
shaw, but he failed to raise the latter's
brand of havoc. In the third quarter Sat
urday Hug was thrown for about as
many yards as he gained. Lawson, Mertz,
Cravens and Johnston each took a turn
at nailing the small Nevadan behind the
line.

Guy Dennis. That name sounds famil
iar. It takes one back to last year when
the "fighting Irishman" from Los An
geles was bucking the line for Seay's
1925 freshmen. Dennis was handicapped
to a certain extent by injuries, but he
shared the burden of the backfield work
witli Cuddeback. Until the closing min
utes Saturday, he had been little heard
of, or little talked of. His sensational
line-plunging, whether due to the fact
that the Nevadans were tired, or to his
own "fight," made him the "discovery" of
the game.

Scranton, Wolf halfback, was about the
only one that could do anything with the
Card defense, and he was stopped short
inside Stanford's 20-yard line. Two suc
cessful forward passes, each about twenty
yards, gave the Nevadans more yardage
than a dozen line bucks.

Just at present Andy Kerr can forget
about half his guard candidates and still
have enough left to get along with. The
return of George Houck raises the num
ber on the first string to five. In addi
tion to Houck. there are Faville, who just
now is going like that famous cyclone.
Phoney, Cravens, and Douglass.

Dud DeGroot saved yardage few* Kerr's
team Saturday. On several ocasions some
linesman was over-eager, and most of
the others charged, but the Card captain
hung on the ball, bringing everyone back
again. DeGroot runs good interference,
as Umpire Korbelt will testify. He just
about knocked the white-trousered gen
tleman from his feet with some well
aimed clipping.

DeGroot is fairly fast, but Hug is
faster. The big center blocked one of
Harrison's punts and had a lead on the
field chasing the pigskin. Hug was after
him in a split second and passed both De-
Groot and Shipkey, saving about a sure
touchdown.

Nevada students are nothing if not
patriotic. There were over a hundred of
them at the game, and a few paid their
fares down from Reno. Twenty-six of
the number chose the box-car route, but
unkind "brakies" put them off in the
Sierras.

"Red" Betts' "pushed-arounds" are rap
idly coming into their own. They have

ceased being a work-horse for the Var
sity, and are working up an offense for
their big game of the season next Satur
day at Berkeley. During the month just
past the Grays have learned over a hun
dred plays for use against the Varsity in
practice. The set was changed every
week, and none was learned well.

Despite the fact that they have changed
mightily since the first days of the sea
son, the Grays are a capable outfit. Moe
Sax, quarterback, has wandered to other
universities, Oliva, end, is out for basket
ball, and Jake Irwin, tackle, is instruct
ing the third string freshmen. But
Erhorn, Wright, Hamilton, and Wood
head, backfield men, show Varsity prom
ise for next year. Then at center there
is Williams, and at end Widaman.
That freshman game down south might
just as well have been labeled "David vs.
Goliath," with David, as usual, on the
long end of the score—though by a bigger
margin than the 10-9 total indicated.
( The Card Babes, outweighed by ten
pounds at the outset, fought and suc
cessfully held all the beef U. S. C. had
before the game was over. Coach Bill
Hess sent a moose named Hicks in at
guard in the second half, who scaled at
218. Opposed to him was Cleo Davis,

dropped so suddenly as to be out of the
play for a few downs. At that, the rec
ords show that LeFebvre got most of the
Trojan yardage.

On the other hand, Hunt's legionaries
made most of their gains on straight
bucks. In the second half the hall was
constantly in enemy territory, and only
the adverse break of an intercepted pass
ten yards from goal prevented a 14-9
finale.

After Nevers left the game in the sec
ond quarter, with Faust replacing, Bill
Cook did the booting, and did it so well
that Gene Dorsey, the widely heralded
fifty-yard punter, was crowded to keep
up with him.

"Bunny" Hug, who might qualify as
world's champion lightweight halfback,
ooked, ran and passed like "Rabbit" Brad
shaw, but he failed to raise the latter's
brand of havoc. In the third quarter Sat
urday Hug was thrown for about as
many yards as he gained. Lawson, Mertz,
Cravens and Johnston each took a turn
at nailing the small Nevadan behind the
line.

Guy Dennis. That name sounds famil
iar. It takes one back to last year when
the "fighting Irishman" from Los An
geles was bucking the line for Seay's
1925 freshmen. Dennis was handicapped
to a certain extent by injuries, but he
shared the burden of the backfield work
witli Cuddeback. Until the closing min
utes Saturday, he had been little heard
of, or little talked of. His sensational
line-plunging, whether due to the fact
that the Nevadans were tired, or to his
own "fight," made him the "discovery" of
the game.

Scranton, Wolf halfback, was about the
only one that could do anything with the
Card defense, and he was stopped short
inside Stanford's 20-yard line. Two suc
cessful forward passes, each about twenty
yards, gave the Nevadans more yardage
than a dozen line bucks.

Just at present Andy Kerr can forget
about half his guard candidates and still
have enough left to get along with. The
return of George Houck raises the num
ber on the first string to five. In addi
tion to Houck. there are Faville, who just
now is going like that famous cyclone.
Phoney, Cravens, and Douglass.

Dud DeGroot saved yardage few* Kerr's
team Saturday. On several ocasions some
linesman was over-eager, and most of
the others charged, but the Card captain
hung on the ball, bringing everyone back
again. DeGroot runs good interference,
as Umpire Korbelt will testify. He just
about knocked the white-trousered gen
tleman from his feet with some well
aimed clipping.

DeGroot is fairly fast, but Hug is
faster. The big center blocked one of
Harrison's punts and had a lead on the
field chasing the pigskin. Hug was after
him in a split second and passed both De-
Groot and Shipkey, saving about a sure
touchdown.

Nevada students are nothing if not
patriotic. There were over a hundred of
them at the game, and a few paid their
fares down from Reno. Twenty-six of
the number chose the box-car route, but
unkind "brakies" put them off in the
Sierras.

"Red" Betts' "pushed-arounds" are rap
idly coming into their own. They have

ceased being a work-horse for the Var
sity, and are working up an offense for
their big game of the season next Satur
day at Berkeley. During the month just
past the Grays have learned over a hun
dred plays for use against the Varsity in
practice. The set was changed every
week, and none was learned well.

Despite the fact that they have changed
mightily since the first days of the sea
son, the Grays are a capable outfit. Moe
Sax, quarterback, has wandered to other
universities, Oliva, end, is out for basket
ball, and Jake Irwin, tackle, is instruct
ing the third string freshmen. But
Erhorn, Wright, Hamilton, and Wood
head, backfield men, show Varsity prom
ise for next year. Then at center there
is Williams, and at end Widaman.
That freshman game down south might
just as well have been labeled "David vs.
Goliath," with David, as usual, on the
long end of the score—though by a bigger
margin than the 10-9 total indicated.
( The Card Babes, outweighed by ten
pounds at the outset, fought and suc
cessfully held all the beef U. S. C. had
before the game was over. Coach Bill
Hess sent a moose named Hicks in at
guard in the second half, who scaled at
218. Opposed to him was Cleo Davis,
Hunt's 154-pound guard. The first play
after the big Hicks lined up was sent
through him for about seven yards. Davis
continued to upset his man until the end
of the game.

So hard did that freshman line and
the tacklers hit that the Trojan greens
were constantly yelling for time out. They
could not gain through the line, their
forward passes were smothered by Hunt's
defense system, and nearly every time
