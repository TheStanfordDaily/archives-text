To the Editor:
In reply to the communication in yes
terday's paper by Mr. Hadley and Mr.
Mareno, I would like to explain my situ
ation in regard to the incident of Satur
day last, which has raised such indigna
tion 011 their parts.
My wife and 1 had been sitting in the
Nevada side of the Stadiiyn, and after
the game we were about to start down
the steps when some gentleman, perhaps
it was Mr. Mareno, as Mr. Hadley was not
present, started toward us demanding that
I remove my hat, and as I did not under
stand what he was driving at his manner
and voice became more threatening, which
resulted in my action, before I realized
that Stanford was singing "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail."
I don't think that I am more lacking in
Stanford spirit and respect for Stanford
ideals than either Mr. Hadley or Mr.
Mareno, and I most certainly would have
removed my hat if he had merely called
my attention to the fact without going to
the length of being discourteous to my
wife in his turn. '
In conclusion, I wish to say that insofar
as my action may have been discourteous
to Stanford, I have 110 other wish but to
apologize.
THOMAS M. DONOHOE, '23.
