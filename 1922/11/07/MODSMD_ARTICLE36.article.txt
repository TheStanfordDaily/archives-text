bers of the Amateur Fencers' League of
America last night in the basketball pa
vilion and succeeded in raising their in
dividual records to 20 3-4 points.
Seven clubs in the league sent repre
sentatives to the meet, including six men
from Stanford and six from California.
The eighteen fencers who took part en
gaged with members of other clubs in
the same class with themselves.
Of the Stanford entries, Sandrette made
the best showing by winning five out of
six matches. Gardner did equally well
when he took four out of five contests.
Aguerrevere won four out of six, Lewis
one out of five, and Richardson and
Monaco each one out of six.
The number of matches won and lost
does not show the keenness of the com
petition. Monaco, whose record shows
only one match to his credit, got 14 points
to 28 for his opponents. Likewise, Rich
ardson got 16 points to 28 scored against
him. and Lewis got 17 to 22 for his op
ponent.
While several of the Stanford fencers
have engaged in previous meets and had
the practice and experiencee to help them
last night. Richardson and Lewis had not
made an appearance in- either of the
previous meets of the season.
The best score of the evening was
made by Von Arnold of California, who
won all five of his matches. Besides,
Sandretto and Gardner, the men losing
only one match were Kraaymas, Califor
nia; Devereux, California, and Kehrline,
Olympic Club.
