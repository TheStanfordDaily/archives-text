# "Pageant of Parliament" Now on New Book Shelf
## 
### 
Michael McLonagh, who as a journal
ist, viewed the English Parliament for
thirty-five years from the reporters' gal
lery, has written "The Pageant of Par
liament," which is on the Library's New
Book Shelf this week. He presents the
human side of Parliament and traces its
progress from the General Election till
its dissolution by the Sovereign on the
advice of the Cabinet.
G. Stanley Hall, Ph. D., LL. D., psy
chologist. has recently published "Senes
cence: The Last Half of Life," which is
now on the New Book Shelf. Hall tries
to present the subject of Old Age and
Death from as many viewpoints as pos
sible to show how ignorant and learned,
child and adult, pagan and Christian, have
looked at these problems, letting each
class speak for itself. He develops an idea
of death, that, if not new, he says is more
true to the facts of life than those now
current.
In this ideal Hall has in mind the na
ture and needs of intelligent people.
A third book is "An Anthrography of
the Eucalyptus," by Russell Grim wade,
containing seventy-nine colored plates.
