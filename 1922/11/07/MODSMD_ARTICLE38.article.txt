# REHEARSALS BEGIN TO SHOW FORM OF FOOTBALL FROTHIES
## 
### 
Life is beginning to appear in the
"Football Frothies of '22" as regular re
hearsals of the choruses and cast are
whipping together the elements of the
Ram's Head show, to be staged the night
of the Big Game.
From this week until the curtains rise
on the night of November 25, the direc
tors will carry on intensive rehearsing
in the effort to develop finesse and origi
nality in the acts.
The cast of thirty-nine, including such
varied characters as Milly, Tilly and the
Javanese Dancer, and the three choruses
are under the direction of Hollis Chal
mers, '23. Arnold Bayley, '23, is assist
ing in the general supervision; Sam Men
denhall, '23, has charge of the dancing;
while "Chick" Midgley, '23, is developing
the music.
