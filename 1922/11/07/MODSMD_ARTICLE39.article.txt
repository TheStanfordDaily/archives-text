# CALIFORNIA STARTS BASKETBALL PRACTICE
## 
### 
Basketball practice opened at Califor
nia last week with seventy men out for
fall training. Coach Earl Wight has
seven letter men from last year's team,
and also a number of men who substi
tuted on the Varsity. It is expected that
several of last year's freshman team will
make a strong fight for positions on the
Varsity.
The Bears who have made their letters
in the hoop game and who have returned
are Captain Le Hane, Talt, Douthit,
Thompson, Kincaid, O'Neil, and Hou
vinen. California will have to work hard
to fill the vacancies left by the gradu
ation of Eggleston, Larkey, and Coop.
An intensive schedule of training will
continue until the Thanksgiving recess.
The first actual competition on the courts
will start on December 4.
