# Riding Club For Upper Class Women Organized
## 
### 
Arrangements for the organization of
a riding club for Stanford upper class
women, the purpose of which will be to
foster an interest in horses and polo,
have been completed by Dean Yost and
Major Collins of the Military Depart
ment. Those desiring to join the club
should leave their names at Dean Yost's
office on Friday, November 10.
A class, meeting two or three times a
week for riding instruction under an offi
cer of the Military Training Department,
will be formed for those women who de
sire to ride, and when sufficiently pro
ficient will conduct paper chases and other
riding excursions over the nearby country.
This form of conducting women's
equitation was thought preferable to the
system last year, by which the officers
acted as instructors for the Women's
Physical Education Department.
