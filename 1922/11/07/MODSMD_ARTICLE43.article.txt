# Mining and Metallurgy Department Arranges to Register Undergraduates
## 
### 
The Department of Mining and Metal
lurgy, heretofore exclusively a graduate
department, will undertake the registra
tion of undergraduate students, beginning
this winter quarter. It is felt that by
thus registering students in the depart
ment upon completion of the Lower Di
vision requirements, closer co-operation
can be secured between faculty and stu
dents, and that the faculty will be able
to guide the undergraduate studies of the
pre-mining and pre-metallurgy students.
Upon completion of the undergraduate
requirements, the A. B. degree will be
given in pre-mining curriculum, which
will have practically the same significance
as the A. B. in the pre-legal curriculum;
that is, that the student has fulfilled the
academic requirements for the A. B. de
gree, and has prepared himself for the
professional studies given in the two
years' graduate course, leading to the de
gree of Engineer in Mining and Metal
lurgy.
Under the new arrangement it will be
possible for students to choose a limited
number of electives and yet obtain their
A. B. without exceeding the 150 units
required for graduation.
