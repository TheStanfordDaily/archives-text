# Sophomores Will Work At Convalescent Home On Saturday Mornings
## 
### 
Following the custom started by the
class of '23, but discontinued last year,
the sophomores will send four men and
four women to the Stanford Convalescent
Home Saturday mornings.
Persons scheduled to work will be noti
fied by phone or their names will appear
in the Daily Palo Alto. The committee
in charge of the work consists of Elsa
Barber, Ted Oviate, and William Hobro.
The Convalescent Home, which was
formerly the Stanford Home, is supported
by private subscriptions. The cost of
employing a man to take care of the
grounds is saved by the work accom
plished by sophomores on Saturdays and
the work done on "Labor Day" by the
entire student body.
