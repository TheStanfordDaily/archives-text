# BRUINS LOSE SOCCER GAME TO EX-SOLDIERS
## 
### 
California was lowered another notch
in the University and Club Soccer
League last Saturday, when the Blue and
Gold eleven met defeat, 1-0, at the hands
of the Palo Alto American Legion.
The score for the ex-soldiers came at
the beginning of the second half, when
Jim Bucklin, '20, former varsity player,
shot in a long pass from Dobie. A little
later a chance for the Legion to score
again was stopped by a lucky catch of
the Bruin goal guard.
Outside of this game, Saturday's round
of play was for the most part the case
of the stronger teams meeting the weaker
ones. The Barbarians had little difficulty
in downing the Sons of St. George, 5-1.
and the Vikings were easy victors over
the Virtus Club.
Next Saturday the Barbarians will meet
the Vikings to play off the tie for second
in the league. Comparing the scores that
the Stanford Varsity ran up on both
teams shows them to be in the same class.
The standing in the league is as
follows:
Teamâ€” GP. W. L. T. Pt.
Stanford 5 5 0 0 10
Barbarians 5 4 10 8
Vikings 5 4 10 8
Olympics 5 2 2 1 5
Legion 5 2 3 0 4
California 5 13 13
Italia Vertus 5 0 5 0 0
Sons St. George 5 0 5 0 0
