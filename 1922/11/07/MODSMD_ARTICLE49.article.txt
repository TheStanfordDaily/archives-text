### 
Five periods of polo were played by
the R. O. T. C. Saturday instead of the
three orginally planned. The whites,
consisting of O. C. Barby, Edwards,
Bruce, and Vanderburg, were victors in
three periods, and the reds, Captain
Cooney, Captain Boyle, Major Collins,
and Reticker took two. The blues,
Emaheiser, Laub, Thompson, and R. E.
Barby, brought up the cellar.
Result of the periods were: Whites
2, Blues 0; Whites 2, Reds 0; Reds 3,
Blues 0; Whites 1, Blues 0; Reds 1,
Whites 0.
This was the first tiyie the new polo
field has been used, and, according to Cap
tain Boyle, in charge of the sport, al
though the turf was cut up to some ex
tent, the field is in good condition.
Major Collins has been corresponding
with the Oregon Agricultural College and
the Colorado Agricultural College rela
tive to scheduling intercollegiate polo
games. Colonel G. W. Moses of Oregon
stated that although his horses are good
swimmers, the men are not, and on ac
count of rain they have been able to get
no practice.
Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Cornell
are members of the American Polo Asso
ciation, which schedules the international
game with England, and their games re
ceive official recognition.
If a sufficient amount of interest could
be aroused among the western colleges
steps to enter the association might be
taken, according to Major Collins.
