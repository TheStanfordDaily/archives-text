# YEARLING ELEVEN PREPARES TO MEET CALIFORNIA BABES
## Freshmen Will Enter Contest Free From Injury; Nevers, Dixon to Stage Punt Duel 
### 
Under the watchful eye of Coach
"Husky" Hunt, Stanford's fighting fresh
men today started intensive preparation
for their Big Game at Berkeley.
The Dinks will enter California field
on Saturday without a single injury to
spoil their chances. Ernie Nevers, who
was sent out of the U. S. C. game in the
second half with a slight injury, was back
on the job today kicking a wet pigskin
around the field. Both Kirwan and "Rip"
Rispin, substitute quarterbacks, are off
the doctor's hands. On the line the re
turn of Cleo Davis last Saturday put
Hunt's first defense back into top effec
tiveness.
Up at California the wearers of the
dink are placing their hopes on the kick
ing of Jimmy Dixon and the fast, line
bending bucks of "Tut" Imlay. Dixon,
a former Berkeley High luminary, has
been kicking them about fifty yards. Last
week he equaled the marks of Gene Dor
sey, Trojan peagreen punter.
That was all very nice, but Hunt's
Cards went south the next Saturday, and
between Nevers, Cook and Solomon suc
ceeded in lifting the ball even farther on
an average than the great Dorsey.
Until last week the Cubs were consid
ered a slow-moving, often badly-directed
outfit. Then they took on the Berkeley
High team that lost by one point to Stan
ford some weeks ago, and handed the
preppers a 46-0 lacing.
While the freshmen of that Berkeley
game were admittedly miles below the
standard of Hunt's smooth running ma
chine of today, the California Cubs must
have done some improving themselves to
run up such a score.
Alex Post, freshman line coach, saw
the Cub-U. S. C. fracas, and believes that
California, when "right," is two touch
downs better than the southerners.
All of which goes to prove that that
game over the bay next Saturday will be
one of the hardest fought gridiron bat
tles put on by freshman teams.
