THE JOY OF GIVING J
—When the winter winds whistle against the windows; when §
homes are bright-with love and laughter, and dear ones gather U
around the family board —then is the joy of giving fully realized.
Whoever would experience the fullest joy of giving must take
time to choose personally and with care, the gift that will be most $
appreciated. Will you be able to say: "I haven't forgotten a §
soul! " Have you learned the lesson that those who do the right
thing at the right time —those people we come to love for their £>
constant acts of kindness —who are always known for their
thought fulness—they don't act on the impulse of the moment — ||
they simply use forethought; they look and look and shop and
shop, and as a consequence their gift to you is just right—just
the very thing you wanted most —because they did their Christ
mas shopping early and at Mendenhall—the Gift Shop.
