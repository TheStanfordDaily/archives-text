# LECTURER TELLS INDIAN WRONGS DONE BY WHITES
## Senate Hid Treaties, Depriving Indians of Rights Due Them From United States 
### 
"Some day payment for every act of
wrong committed against the Indian
will be demanded from the white
people," declared Dr. George Wharton
James, vice-president of the Indian
Board of Cooperation, in his discus
sion of the American Indian at the
Little Theatre last evening. Dr. James
spoke in place of Mrs. Gertrude Bon
nln who was unable to lecture on ac
count of illness.
"In the past, both state and federal
governments have wilfully and with
malice aforethought euchred the In
dians out of their lands," said the
speaker. "We have done these people
even a greater injustice, however, in
destroying popular belief in their truly
poetic and religious nature."
Dr. James, who has been initiated
into membership in forty-five tribes
and who knows more than forty Indian
languages, speaks with authority upon
needs of these native Americans. "I
only dare to criticize my government
because I can prove that what 1 say
is true —that our nation has been dev
ilishly disgraceful, as compared with
the early Spanish government, in the
dishonorable treatment accorded In
dians in California.
"For fifty-seven years treaties with
the tribes of this state were hidden in
the archives of the Senate,' 'the lec
turer continued. "Land amounting to
7,500,000 acres, together with a pay
ment of blankets, horses and cattle,
and the providing of schoolhouses and
instructors, were granted the Indians
in return for waiving their right and
legal title to lands, which they enjoyed
by virtue of the Spanish-American
treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo."
For business reasons, Senator Gwynn
of California prevented ratification of
these treaties when they were pre
sented in the Senate, according to Dr.
James. But ever since, our government
has demanded that the Indians keep
their side of the agreement, in spite of
the rejection of the treaties.
The Indian Board of Cooperation, of
which I)r. Jordan is honorary pres
ident, is working with the California
Indians to see that some justice is
accorded them, the speaker explained.
Through this board's efforts, a Court
of Claims bill is now before Congress,
which asks for the right of an Indian
to demand a court hearing, as is the
privilege of a Japanese, Chinese, or
any foreign-born inhabitant. The right
of Indian children to be educated in
public schools is also being requested.
At the close of his lecture Dr. James
exhibited samples of rare Indian bas
ketry, explaining their symbolism and
artistically intricate workmanship.
"The Indian has never opened his
heart to the white man," he con
cluded. "There is more poetry to the
square inch in the Indian race than
to the half mile in ours."

to demand a court hearing, as is the
privilege of a Japanese, Chinese, or
any foreign-born inhabitant. The right
of Indian children to be educated in
public schools is also being requested.
At the close of his lecture Dr. James
exhibited samples of rare Indian bas
ketry, explaining their symbolism and
artistically intricate workmanship.
"The Indian has never opened his
heart to the white man," he con
cluded. "There is more poetry to the
square inch in the Indian race than
to the half mile in ours."
"Some day payment for every act of
wrong committed against the Indian
will be demanded from the white
people," declared Dr. George Wharton
James, vice-president of the Indian
Board of Cooperation, in his discus
sion of the American Indian at the
Little Theatre last evening. Dr. James
spoke in place of Mrs. Gertrude Bon
nln who was unable to lecture on ac
count of illness.
"In the past, both state and federal
governments have wilfully and with
malice aforethought euchred the In
dians out of their lands," said the
speaker. "We have done these people
even a greater injustice, however, in
destroying popular belief in their truly
poetic and religious nature."
Dr. James, who has been initiated
into membership in forty-five tribes
and who knows more than forty Indian
languages, speaks with authority upon
needs of these native Americans. "I
only dare to criticize my government
because I can prove that what 1 say
is true —that our nation has been dev
ilishly disgraceful, as compared with
the early Spanish government, in the
dishonorable treatment accorded In
dians in California.
"For fifty-seven years treaties with
the tribes of this state were hidden in
the archives of the Senate,' 'the lec
turer continued. "Land amounting to
7,500,000 acres, together with a pay
ment of blankets, horses and cattle,
and the providing of schoolhouses and
instructors, were granted the Indians
in return for waiving their right and
legal title to lands, which they enjoyed
by virtue of the Spanish-American
treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo."
For business reasons, Senator Gwynn
of California prevented ratification of
these treaties when they were pre
sented in the Senate, according to Dr.
James. But ever since, our government
has demanded that the Indians keep
their side of the agreement, in spite of
the rejection of the treaties.
The Indian Board of Cooperation, of
which I)r. Jordan is honorary pres
ident, is working with the California
Indians to see that some justice is
accorded them, the speaker explained.
Through this board's efforts, a Court
of Claims bill is now before Congress,
which asks for the right of an Indian
to demand a court hearing, as is the
privilege of a Japanese, Chinese, or
any foreign-born inhabitant. The right
of Indian children to be educated in
public schools is also being requested.
