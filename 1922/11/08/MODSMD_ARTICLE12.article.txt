# FIRST INTERCLASS GAME TO BE PLAYED SATURDAY
## 
### MAX STILES, '25 
The opening gun for actual play in
the inter-class football ranks will be
fired at 9 o'clock Saturday morning, it
was announced yesterday by Director
of Intramural Athletics C. W. Davis.
At this hour the sophs and frosh will
begin to batter one another about the |
inclosed field whereon the Varsity is l
now holding signal practice. An hour j
later the seniors are to meet the juniors
on the same turf.
Accommodations will be made for a
big crowd, and the first game will be
over in plenty of time to allow the frosh I
to catch the train for Berkeley and the
big game with the University of Califor
nia first-year men in the afternoon.
Each game will consist of four ten-min
ute quarters.
Officials will be chosen this evening.
It is believed that Duffy Seay will ref
eree, with "Dink" Templeton, "Red"
Bctts and Andy Kerr officiating also.
Particular attention was given the
sophomores last night, and it must be |
said that the '25 boys have the makings ]
of a real team. Just at present they ap
pear to be rather poorly organized and [
in the matter of football knowledge the
frosh have it all over them. What they '
need is another week to prepare in. Give
them that, and they would be ready to !
take on the lighter '26 men who have j

been out in moleskins sincc the opening
of school.
This idea of taking the third frosh
eleven and transferring it into inter-class
competition is pretty nice for the Pea
greens, but it means tough going and
some hard thinking on the part of the
sophomores. Taking all things into con
sideration, the frosh should go on the
field Saturday morning as favorites, al
though outweighed nearly thirty pounds
to the man.
Harold Lundburg, who played tackle
with the University of Oregon frosh,
is coaching the sophomore eleven. He is
doing a good job of it, but is so pressed
for time that he realizes himself that his
only hope for victory is on sheer weight
and power. By the time the frosh meet
either the seniors or juniors, as the case
may be, on November 18, their op
ponents will have had a week longer
than Lundburg has been allowed.
The sophomore line will average very
nearly 180 pounds. With two 190-
pounders in the line it looks formidable.

pounds.
The line-up as announced last night
by Lundburg is by no means final, but
will give some idea as to how the ag
gregation will look. Miller, a 165-
pounder, will start at center. Lawrence
