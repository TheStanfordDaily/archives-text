# CARDINALS CONTINUE SECRET PRACTICE AS TROJANS COME NORTH
## Hunt Closes the Gates On Freshmen Gridmen; Numbers Are Issued For "Little Big Game" Saturday 
### 
Behind shut and locked gates Coach
"Husky" Hunt today gave his freshmen
eleven their lirst scrimmage with a series
of plays designed especially to cross up
the Bear Cubs at Berkeley this Satur
day. Secret practice included the first
squad only.
Hunt is taking no risks with injuries
in practice on the eve of the Babes' bife
battle. He sent his second string men
against the intcrclass eleven last night,
saving the regulars for signals.
Iwo coaches are working day and
night up at California to get the Cubs
ready for the big melee. By the time
the squad goes out on the field Barnes
and Toomey ought to have that long
passing combination, Dixon to Imlay or
Schaffnit, down to a science.
Interference that left practically noth
ing for the runner to do but go down
the field was the cause of most of the
gains against Berkeley High, say eye
witnesses. With Bill Blewett back in
the game, "Tut" Imlay, a boy of just
about the size and ability of Bill Cook,
tearing off end runs, and Jimmy Dixon
doing the kicking, Hunt's warriors will
face by far the stiffest combination on
offensive they have struck this season.
Dixon has been elected captain of the
Bear Cubs.
While the Card substitutes have been
busy gaining a reputation as a hard
hitting outfit, the same process has been
going on across the bay. Toomey sent
in nearly his whole squad against the
preppers last week, and it was hard to
tell them from the regular eleven.
Schaffnit at end. Cook at full, and Carey
on the line looked better than many of
the 'first string, and may start against
the Dinks.
As a whole, the team Berkeley will
present against the Babes is only slightly
heavier, but most of this weight is con
centrated in the first defense. Hunt's
heavy backfield has considerable more
beef than the Bears, according to these
who have checked on both squads.
Numbered jerseys were distributed to
the Babe players before leaving for the
south. They will be seen with their
identification tags on at Berkeley. The
squad listing with weight, position and
home town follows:
I—Al Clayes, 142, H., Anaheim.
2—D. D. Graves, 157, E., Santa Monica.
3—Bob Hunt, 190, C., Santa Barbara.

passing combination, Dixon to Imlay or
Schaffnit, down to a science.
Interference that left practically noth
ing for the runner to do but go down
the field was the cause of most of the
gains against Berkeley High, say eye
witnesses. With Bill Blewett back in
the game, "Tut" Imlay, a boy of just
about the size and ability of Bill Cook,
tearing off end runs, and Jimmy Dixon
doing the kicking, Hunt's warriors will
face by far the stiffest combination on
offensive they have struck this season.
Dixon has been elected captain of the
Bear Cubs.
While the Card substitutes have been
busy gaining a reputation as a hard
hitting outfit, the same process has been
going on across the bay. Toomey sent
in nearly his whole squad against the
preppers last week, and it was hard to
tell them from the regular eleven.
Schaffnit at end. Cook at full, and Carey
on the line looked better than many of
the 'first string, and may start against
the Dinks.
As a whole, the team Berkeley will
present against the Babes is only slightly
heavier, but most of this weight is con
centrated in the first defense. Hunt's
heavy backfield has considerable more
beef than the Bears, according to these
who have checked on both squads.
Numbered jerseys were distributed to
the Babe players before leaving for the
south. They will be seen with their
identification tags on at Berkeley. The
squad listing with weight, position and
home town follows:
I—Al Clayes, 142, H., Anaheim.
2—D. D. Graves, 157, E., Santa Monica.
3—Bob Hunt, 190, C., Santa Barbara.

Behind shut and locked gates Coach
"Husky" Hunt today gave his freshmen
eleven their lirst scrimmage with a series
of plays designed especially to cross up
the Bear Cubs at Berkeley this Satur
day. Secret practice included the first
squad only.
Hunt is taking no risks with injuries
in practice on the eve of the Babes' bife
battle. He sent his second string men
against the intcrclass eleven last night,
saving the regulars for signals.
Iwo coaches are working day and
night up at California to get the Cubs
ready for the big melee. By the time
