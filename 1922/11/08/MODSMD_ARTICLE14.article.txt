# GEORGE HAYS IS ELECTED CAPTAIN OF GRAYS' ELEVEN
## 
### 
George P. "Tubby" Hays, '24, the
scrappy little right guard, was elected
captain of the Grays at a meeting of the
squad in Encina Gymnasium last night.
Hays is one of the best linesmen on the
team, both on the offensive and de
fensive.
Coach Betts put his men through a
hard workout yesterday, starting them
out with a stiff signal practice in the
afternoon and ending up with black
board work in the Gymnasium last night.
He had Hamilton, the "demon" half
back, trying place kicks from'various
distances. The big fellow seems to have
had a great deal of trouble locating the
goal posts, but is improving.
"Pat" Gary was out in a suit last night
after a long lay-off on account of an
injured side. Cary was hurt early in the
season and has been missed by the team.
He is one of the fastest men on the
squad and is a shifty open field runner.
The fact that he weighs but 145 p mrds
has kept him off Andy Kerr's squad. He
will undoubtedly break into the game
Saturday, however.
"Bob" Wright, the big fullback who
has been showing up so well in the last
few games, was out in a suit again to
night and his ankle, which lias kept him
on the sidelines this week, seems to be
mending fast. Bctts says he will be
ready to play Saturday, and if he does,
it is a safe bet that the California Goofs
will hear from him.
The Grays engaged in a short sr" ret
scrimmage with the Varsity tonight.
