Elmer C. Henderson and his hard-working
Trojans head northward to
night for the Stanford campus with
visions of a twenty-one-point victory
over the Cardinal next Saturday. That
is no secret. Whenever Henderson fails
to predict publicly that his team will
lose, then it is certain that he figures it.
will win by a good margin.
At Stanford the situation is different.
There is one thing that comes out of
the clouds of secrecy which veil the
varsity practice field nightly. Stanford
—or more particularly, Andy Kerr, and
his squad—are up against a hard propo
sition.
There may have been minor crises for
the Card gridders all through the pre
liminary season, but this is the crisis of
them all. It will take some improve
ment over the showing against Nevada
to beat the Trojans, now rated as the
second best on the Coast. If they do,
the Washington contest the following
Saturday won't seem hard, and here will
be plenty of Cardinal confidence for the
Big Game. If they don't—well, Andy
Kerr's job is so much the harder.
Nothing serious in the way of injuries
happened to any of the varsity squad in
the game with Nevada, so that full
strength will be presented Saturday.
Bob Jansen, who is now in the run
ning, may get into the fray. He has
not scrimmaged for over a month, and
it will take some work before he is in
condition to play a full game.
Reserve strength of the teams may
turn the tide. Kerr will be at no great
disadvantage in this respect, because for
the first time since the return to Ameri
can, a Stanford team has plenty of capa
ble substitutes. With the showing of
Dennis Cleaveland, Murray, Wheat and
Campbell against Nevada, the Card
mentor has practically an alternate back
field. There has been plenty of line ma
terial all along.
What Kerr himself thinks about the
U. S. C. game Saturday he is keeping
pretty much to himself. "We will have
to go better than we have this season, if
we are to win," he said. "We have been
trying to bring the boys along as fast
as possible, but they can only make a
certain amount of progress in a week."
That seems to be the whole thing rolled
up compactly, ready to take home. Will
Stanford's gridmen have progressed far
enough by Saturday to combat the skill
of the best eleven the Trojans have had
i'i several years? Majority opinion, on
the campus, at least, seems to think they
will.
