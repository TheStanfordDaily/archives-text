# STANFORD'S MARK IN THE LINE OF VICTORY
## 
### 
There are memorials and memorials —good, bad,
and indifferent —but for all that really achieving a
worthy purpose. And there are ways and means too
many to mention of raising memorial funds. The
best of all —the most worth-while and the one with
the most meaning—is that memorial which stands
for a great deal, is simple and useful, and is a part
of a great number of people. A memorial to fill its
part should not be a mere gift without a measure of
accompanying sentiment and real interest. The
'University has been given an opportunity to provide
one that lias all these qualifications.
In today's issue of the Daily the proposal is out
lined in detail as offered by the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce in the name of France and accepted by
Dr. Wilbur and the Associated Students in the name
of Stanford.
Stanford's war record is one of which to be proud
and one deserving of an overseas memorial of far
greater cost than the one proposed. It is not the
cost that counts, however, but the thought which in
spires the memorial and makes possible the contri
bution toward it of an entire student body. It is not
a drain on students' purses, but is an opportunity
for the simple, inexpensive, and unpretentious ex
pression of a fine sentiment. Stanford had 3,645
stars in her service flag. Seventy-seven Stanford
men lost their lives in the service. It is not necessary
to mention again the work done by outstanding
Stanford men and women. The fact that Stanford
lias been chosen as one of the twelve colleges and
universities from among the hundreds in the United
.States to erect one of these milestones, is in itself
a recognition of that war record.
Stanford students need not be asked to contribute
to this cause. There is no necessity for a drive. It
is not a campaign for cash, but is an effort to give
all students an opportunity to contribute something
toward a memorial in which they will take a per
sonal interest. Nothing more than fifty cents is
wanted from any one student, because there is no
financial goal to be achieved. The money necessary
to defray the expenses of erecting the monument
might well be taken from the treasury of the Associ
ated Students, but it is to introduce and to maintain
the personal element in general contribution that will
count in this matter.
Stanford is proud of her war record. She has
been chosen as one of the most representative of
American colleges. Her students have been given
an opportunity to make this record lasting. Shall
anybody be able to say that Stanford students over
look their best opportunities?

many to mention of raising memorial funds. The
best of all —the most worth-while and the one with
the most meaning—is that memorial which stands
for a great deal, is simple and useful, and is a part
of a great number of people. A memorial to fill its
part should not be a mere gift without a measure of
accompanying sentiment and real interest. The
'University has been given an opportunity to provide
one that lias all these qualifications.
In today's issue of the Daily the proposal is out
lined in detail as offered by the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce in the name of France and accepted by
Dr. Wilbur and the Associated Students in the name
of Stanford.
Stanford's war record is one of which to be proud
and one deserving of an overseas memorial of far
greater cost than the one proposed. It is not the
cost that counts, however, but the thought which in
spires the memorial and makes possible the contri
bution toward it of an entire student body. It is not
a drain on students' purses, but is an opportunity
for the simple, inexpensive, and unpretentious ex
pression of a fine sentiment. Stanford had 3,645
stars in her service flag. Seventy-seven Stanford
men lost their lives in the service. It is not necessary
to mention again the work done by outstanding
Stanford men and women. The fact that Stanford
lias been chosen as one of the twelve colleges and
universities from among the hundreds in the United
.States to erect one of these milestones, is in itself
a recognition of that war record.
Stanford students need not be asked to contribute
to this cause. There is no necessity for a drive. It
is not a campaign for cash, but is an effort to give
all students an opportunity to contribute something
toward a memorial in which they will take a per
sonal interest. Nothing more than fifty cents is
wanted from any one student, because there is no
financial goal to be achieved. The money necessary
to defray the expenses of erecting the monument
might well be taken from the treasury of the Associ
ated Students, but it is to introduce and to maintain
the personal element in general contribution that will
count in this matter.
Stanford is proud of her war record. She has
been chosen as one of the most representative of
American colleges. Her students have been given
an opportunity to make this record lasting. Shall
anybody be able to say that Stanford students over
look their best opportunities?
