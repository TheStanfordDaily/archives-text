# TWO BIRDS WITH ONE BONFIRE
## 
### 
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb has suggested that the
freshmen in cleaning up all the inflammable material
this year for the bonfire do it systematically. If all
the material were taken out of backyards, cellars,
garrets, woodsheds, ad infinitum, it would make a
pile higher than the gables of Encina. And the very
fact that it is such stuff that catches sparks thus
starting fires is enough of a recommendation for it
so far as the bonfire itself is concerned. Lamb will
be one of the most able assistants to the directors
of California's pyre. He knows where all the in
flammable material in question is, for he has been
trying to have people get rid of it for almost a year.
Now is a good time to cook two birds with one fire.
