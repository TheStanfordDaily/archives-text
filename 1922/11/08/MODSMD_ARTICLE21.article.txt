# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M.'24
## 
### Phil Newill 
Cabbages steps right out and declares himself in
favor of the new fashions. He then steps in again to
remark that he was dead agin those long skirts, because
they forced one to look at the faces. But now the
women are wearing sweat bands covering their fore
heads, which is at least a step in the right direction.

Remarkable Remarks
Helen of Troy: So this is Paris!

It's about time somebody did something about this.
They have, and we wish to congratulate them 011 it. We
may be mistaken, which is probably impossible, but
what we should like to know is, what were they doing
between the eventually and the now?
It is a sad state of affairs in a he-man's school when
there are no women about. However, that is beside
the point—or beside both points. As the professor in
map-making said: "The shortest way to connect two
given points is to shave them off" —a problem so old it
is putrescent. Which is all very well, but what are you
going to do if the points are brought out again, even in
the dark? And will it be done eventually or now?
Paul, in his Epistles to the Pi Phis, says that force shall
be met with force. What we mean is, the student body
hasn't been turning out as it should. It's enough to
raze the hair 011 your lip, just like Stanford gents always
does.
* * *
Whew! It was a close call, but they saved 'em all.
Right in the nick of time they discovered that some form
of parasite was eating the bushes in front of the
Library, and the authorities rushed the shrubs away
before everything was a barren waste, like a bleacher
rally.

How to Drink Punch
Grasp the glass firmly in both hands, as for a brassie
shot, then stretch the neck gradually forward, at the
same time exhaling deeply so that the punch will land
below the belt. Stand with the legs braced apart,
exhale again and toss it off with a quick gulp as if you
were swallowing a hot rock. Then turn to your partner
and ask her in Swedish what the hell she is laughing at.
* * *
Four Cuts and Out
Professor: Well, well, back in your seat again.
Changed some, haven't you?
Professional: Yeh, I was sitting up in the back row
for another guy yesterday.

Andy Smith is pulling for the Cards, eh! Thanks,
