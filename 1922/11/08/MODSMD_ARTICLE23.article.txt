# Organ Recitals
## 
### 
Latham True, acting University or
ganist, will play the following program
at the Organ Recital tomorrow after
noon at 4:15 p. m. in Memorial Church:
Toccata in C Bach
A toccata is a "touch" piece to
show technique as a sonata is a
"sound" piece adapted for harmonies
of tone.
Arabesque in E Claude Debussy
This is an Arabesque in the sense
of figures not of Arabian music
though the name is derived from
that.
Clair de Lune (Suite Bergamasque)
Claude Debussy
A nocturne especially adapted for
the organ, filled with color tone. It
is an impression of a moonlight
scene on the water with temple bells
ringing in the distance.
Aria: My Plane Tree Handel
A tenor aria from the opera Xerxes
Allegro maestoso and Fugue (second
sonata) Mendelssohn
