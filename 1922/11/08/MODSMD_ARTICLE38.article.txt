# GLEE CLUB TO SING FOR FIRST TIME IN YEAR DECEMBER 10
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club will make its
first appearance for tlie year at a Christ
mas oratorio to be held in the Memorial
Church on December 10, according to
Arnold Bayley, '23, president of the
organization. The club will probably
join with the choir for this occasion.
Richard Malaby has taken over the di
rectorship in the absence of Warren
Waters. He is following the type of
program which proved so successful last
year, a combination of classical and semi
classical numbers, together with lighter
selections of a humorous nature.
Concert tours for both the Christmas
holidays and the spring vacation are con
templated, but no definite arrangements
have as yet been made.
