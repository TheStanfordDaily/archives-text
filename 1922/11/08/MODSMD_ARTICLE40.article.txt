# FRESHMEN TO START CONSTRUCTION WORK ON ANNUAL BONFIRE
## 
### 
Active work on the construction of
the annuel bonfire will start in a few
days. Delmer Daves was elected chair
man of the freshman bonfire commit
tee at a meeting of the class yester
day. Daves announced that the mem
bers of his committee will be appointed
Friday and that construction will be
gin at once.
The freshman committee will act
with Guidon Steele, '25, and his slave
drivers in ranking the arrangements
of construction. Each freshman will be
required to do 15 hours' work, and in
order to avoid confusion, time cards
will be issued. An accurate account
will be kept of the time. The field
back of the site of the old library will
again be used for the bonfire.
On suggestion, D. J. Kropp was ap
pointed chairman of a committee to
arrange for the transportation to the
Stanford-California freshman game at
Berkeley next Saturday. Special cars
will probably be chartered for the oc
casion. A canvass of the class will be
made this week in an effort to obtain
a 100 per jent representation at the
Little-Big Game. Any others who are
planning to go across the Bay should
get in touch with Kropp at Sequoia.
Roland Johnston presented his res
ignation as president of the class. A
new president will be elected at the
next meeting to be held Friday at 10
o'clock in Room 214.
