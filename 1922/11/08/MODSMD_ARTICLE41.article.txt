# Old Boy Downs Lampoon In Fierce Struggle For Superiority Among Comics
## 
### 
When the first issue of Chappie for
this year came off the press, the Old
Boy was in great gobs of glory, for
he considered himself as the first college
comic in the country to use color work
other than that used on the cover. He
told the truth all right, but he came
near telling a falsehood.
While Hammer and Coffin was labor
ing independently on color work which
would distinguish Chappie as the first
in a new field, the wielders of the pen
for the Harvard Lampoon, one of the
biggest college comics in the country,
were doing similar work.
A comparison of the first issue of each
of the two magazines shows that: First,
the Stanford Chaparrel had used color
more profusely on the inside pages than
had its rival; and, second, the Old Boy
had really won out. its publication date
being two weeks ahead of the Harvard
Lampoon's. Whereupon the Old Boy
resumes his jig!
