# STUDENT BODY TO ME IN FRENCH WAR MEMORIALS
## Stanford to Have One of 240 Milestones Marking German Advance in France in 1918 
### 
Stanford accepted through the Exec
utive Committee last night an invita
tion from the Republic of France to
erect one of the 240 milestones in the
line of victory in commemoration of
Stanford's dead and as a monument to
Stanford's achievements in the World
War.
The Association of minute women of
Washington proposed on the date of
Marshal Joffre's arrival in the United
States last spring to erect at Chateau
Thierry for dedication next armistice
day 240 milestones to mark the battle
line where the enemy advance was
stopped in 1918.
As a result, each of the 48 states has
been given an opportunity to erect by
means of popular subscription one of
these memorials. In order to provide
the United States' quota of one-fourth,
12 more were needed and France ex
tended the invitation to Stanford and
eleven other universities in the United
States through the Seattle Chamber of
Commerce. In accepting the invitation
for the student body, the Executive
Committee voted to place a limit of
fifty cents on individual subscriptions
in order that all students migh' have
an opportunity to take part. The total
cost of the memorial will be about
$350.
The following letter of notification
was received by Dr. Wilbur who, also
in the name of Stanford students, ac
cepted the invitation.
President Wilbur, Chevalier de la
Legion d'Honneur,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Sir: —
In addition to the 4S memorials men

versity desire to avail themselves of

Mater, notification would gladly be
