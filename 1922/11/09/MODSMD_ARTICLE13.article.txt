# MUD BA TTLES ARE FEA TURE OF INTER-CLASS PRACTICE
## 
### 
Another rainy afternoon yesterday,
but it did not keep the inter-class
football candidates off the field in the
home stretch. The plain, damp, squashy
fact is that the boys were put through
their hardest workout of the training
period. The sophs waded through the
mud to Palo Alto High School, where
they engaged the Greenbacks In a
scrimmage that lasted about an hour,
while the seniors took on the Grays in
what was intended to be fifteen min
utes of real football.
. Both were messy affairs, although
the sophs had the worst of it inasmuch
as they were forced to play in mud
and sawdust. The seniors and Grays
met on the turf.
Glenn Pollard's seniors looked like
just about the best team of the lot.
Carrying the ball on successive
downs, they forced the Grays steadily
back until a touchdown seemed cer
tain. Off-tackle bucks and plunges
through the heart of the line were
doing considerable damage to the
morale of the Grays.
At this point Pollard ordered Phelps
to attempt a place kick. The boot was
about five feet wide and then they
gave the ball to the Grays. Pollard

said that he felt sure that his men
could have shoved the pigskin over
the goal line, and that he wanted to
see if Phelps could make good the
place kick.
The Grays were absolutely unable
to do a thing with Pollard's line. That
big 180-pound bunch dived into the
middle of the play and that was all
there was to it. It will take a mighty
good junior team to make much head
way against Pollard's line when the
two upper classes come together at
10 o'clock Saturday morning.
The sophs played good football and
did well against the more experienced
Palo Alto High outfit. They went over
with the intention of playing a regu
lar game, but there was so much mud
oozing about that they decided to
hold a scrimmage across field on the
20-yard line. The preps opened up with
a few passes which were dangerously
successful. At the start of the scrim
mage the sophs appeared to be hope
lessly outclassed, but after a few
flounderings about in the mud they
decffled it was time to start something.
They did.
Down the field they went 011 line
