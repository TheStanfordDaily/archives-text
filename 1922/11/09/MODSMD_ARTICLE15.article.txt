# U.S.C. PRESENTS FORMIDABLE TEAM
## 
### Maxwell Stiles, â€™25 
The owl-like individual, who ogles
at you through horn-rimmed glasses
and mopes about under the appelation
of "Gloomy Gus" Henderson, wjll be
with us Saturday afternoon. Hender
son is one of those peculiar beings who
carry an onion about with them in
order that pseudo-tears may flow
freely and at will, and who in reality
are veritable tanks of laughing gas.
Henderson weeps gloom like drops
of perspiration. But take the onion
away from his eyes and substitute a
lemon, and, well, he turns out to be a
regular guy after all. He is not nearly
so sad as he would appear. After
weeping for six months that Andy
Smith's University of California eleven
would defeat U. S. C. by four or five
touchdowns, Henderson turned loose
an aggregation that held the Bears
to one touchdown, and twelve points in
all. The vegetable used in this par
ticular instance was an ordinary,
plain, every-day onion. And when the
game was over, all shouted in chorus,
"Raspberries!"
And "Raspberries" it will be if
Coach Elmer C. Henderson starts
spreading his gloom around Palo Alto.
He knows he has a good team and so
does everybody else. It takes more
than horn-rimmed glasses and a pock
etful of vegetables to fool all of the
people all of the time, or so Abe
Lincoln said and he was just as honest
as they make 'em.
Starting with Henderson's backfield
we find first of all a kinky-liaired 165-
pounder who is just about the best
halfback on the Coast. This man is
Rov Baker, formerly of Santa Clara.
Baker hits the line like a Billy goat,
fast and with the power of dynamite.
He was poison to the California eleven,
getting away for two runs of more
than 35 yards right through the heart
of the Bruin line. Turn loose a goat
and see if he could do much better.
Baker wears a No. 33 011 his back and
will bear watching.
"Hobo" Kincaid, halfback, weighs
172 pounds and is particularly good at
running interference. Chet Dolly, quar
terback, was a member of the state
champion Long Beach High eleven
which Jim Lawson played on in 1919.
He runs the team well. Either Gordon
Campbell or Otto Anderson will start
at fullback. Campbell is the fastest
runner on the squad, but Anderson
excels in kicking. He was not in the
California game, but his injuries may
be sufficiently healed to allow him to
start Saturday.
"Phantom Phil" Tiernan, the flash
who ran rings around the Bears last
year, will probably get in at halfback,
as will John Riddle, a powerful colored
boy who was the mainstay of the
freshmen a year ago. Tony Wayahn
is a hard-hitting fullback.
The outstanding end is John Milton
to whom southern scribes gave the
decision over "Brick" Muller.
Either Hayden Phythian or Winchell
Boice will start at right end. Pythian
is the hombre who knocked out Mark
Evans of Stanford in the boxing last
year, and Boice played opposite Law
son at Long Beach.
Norman Anderson, left tackle, is the
most powerful man on the team. He
played with L. A. High and now weighs
over 200 pounds, although he is of
ficially listed at only 198. It was
Anderson who blocked Nisbet's kick
in the game at Pasadena. Ralph Cum
rnings, a hard-working fellow of 184
pounds, is the other tackle. Captain
Leo Ca'land, the outstanding guard in
the conference, plays next to Ander
son. Calland weighs 195 pounds, sup
posedly, but about 205 actually. The
other guard is John Hawkins, from
Fullerton. Hawkins weighs 170 and is
a good punter. Lowell Lindley, 170
pounds, plays center and is considered
by Henderson to be the hardest fighter
on the squad.
