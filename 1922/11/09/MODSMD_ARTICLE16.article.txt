# LEGION SOCCER MEN TO PLAY CARD TEAM
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney has bet a box
of cigars that his soccer varsity will
win by five goals from the Palo Alto
American Legion next Saturday.
Not that the ex-soldiers are running
the varsity a close race for the leader
ship of the University and Club League
but for some unknown reason, in sea
sons past, the Legion team has been
a jinx to the Cardinal followers of
the English sport. The only game that
last year's varsity lost during the en
tire season was to the Palo Alto men
and that was by the small score of
1-0. Maloney is counting on the Card
inals to win by a score large enough
to make up for all past differences.
The Legion team, which is made up
primarily of former varsity men who
are either graduates or are living in
the vicinity, uses Coach Harry Ma
loney's own system of play. When the
two teams meet it is another case of
brother against brother.
Active practice during the week has
been limited on account of the weath
er conditions. Blackboard demonstra
tions were held, however, and the
players have been working out in the
gym.
Last Monday night, A1 Cordoza, '24,
was elected captain of the second
varsity, while Walter Campbell was
chosen skipper of the 1926 team. Car
doza plays inside right, and Campbell
is a fullback.
