# ANNUAL RED CROSS ROLL CALL STARTS ON CAMPUS TODAY
## One-Half of Funds Collected On Campus Will Be Used in Helping Base Hospital Men 
### 
"Respond to the annual roil call off
the Red Cross by wearing the Stan
ford color incorporated in the form of
a Red Cross button!" is the slogan
that is going forth on the campus as
tfie Red Cross starts its membership
drive today. Tomorrow night will see
the end of the campaign, so quick ac
tion will be the order of the two days.
Organization Captains Appointed
Captains have been appointed to
conduct the drive in their respective
living groups. Students who live in
Palo Alto, faculty members, and the
homes on San Juan hill will be covered
by these captains. The Red Cross win
dow card, which is the one hundred
per cent membership symbol should
be displayed in a window of every
house on the campus.
Money to Be for Local Use
Last year the contributions from
the campus amounted to a little over
$1,000. It is hoped that Stanford will
over-shoot the $2,000 mark in this
year's campaign. Professor H. R. Fair
clough, who is directing the Red Cross
roll call, declares that there are many
families of disabled soldiers in this
locality who need the support of the
Red Cross. Some of the soldiers at the
Palo Alto Base Hospital have families
who must be cared for. Half of the
subscriptions from the campus will be
used in this vicinity.
The Red Cross will spend a large
part of the money that is brought in
by the membership drive for the work
it is carrying on in the Near East and
in Smyrna.
