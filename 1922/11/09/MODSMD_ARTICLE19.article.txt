# GRAYS GO THROUGH HEAVY SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
Every man on the Grays' squad hail a
taste of scrimmage last night.
Coach Betts started them out with
two teams running through signal prac
tice. At 5 o'clock the first squad jour
neyed to the varsity field, where they
scrimmaged the varsity for fifteen min
utes in the midst of a heavy downpour.
Betts then sent in the sccond team
against the Varsity and the first squad
went to the freshman field and tangled
with the senior class eleven for half an
hour.
"Bob" Wright is still unable to do
any work, but his ankle is mending fast
and he may be ready to play Saturday.
"Pat" Cary seems to have hit his stride
again, after his long lay-off, and can be
counted on to carry the ball, kick, or run
interference.
Betts gave out a tentative list last
night of who will make the trip
to Berkeley Saturday. They are as fol
lows : Centers, Williams, Dunbar and
Davidson; guards, Hays (captain), Rog
ers, Crawford, Tucker, and Simons;
tackles, McCombs, Long, Driscoll, Crea
