### (By United Press 
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 9.â€”ln a gal
lant effort to save the steamship
Stuart Dollar, which is riding helpless
about 1800 miles out of Seattle, the big
tug Sea Monarch was battling against
wind and wave today, slowly ap
proaching the crippled vessel.
The Dollar's rudder was carried
away by heavy seas while she was on
her way to the Orient from British
Columbia with a cargo of lumber and
the weather has continued so rough
that it has been impossible for her to
rig a jur> rudder.
Captain Aridley, skipper, sent an
S. O. S. to a tug company here and the
Sea Monarch was put to sea, leaving
shortly after 6 p. m. The Dollar is
lying 300 miles southwest of Unimak
Pass and it is expected that it will
lake three weeks to reach her and
tow her into Seattle.
