# SAFE-GUARDING THE FOOT BRIGADE

### 
That students in great numbers walk arm-in-arm
down Palm Drive admiring the scenery and other
wise blocking the traffic, has been called to the atten
tion of the Daily. Since none of the editorial board
own a car, none of them knows how it feels to skid
into a pedestrian, but no first-hand experience is
necessary to draw the conclusion that such things
ought to be avoided.
It is a matter of common knowledge, of course,
that Palm Drive walks are well-crowded, being a
mere twenty feet wide on each side of the street.
However, if students could manage to crowd them
selves into these narrow limits while going in such
numbers between the campus and Palo Alto, a few
of them might save themselves hospital bills. Wet
.and slippery streets are bad enough for Fords, but
when students and cars get to mixing, the student
generally is worsted.
So far as the editorial board of the Daily is con
cerned, all the cars on the campus could be banned in
a body without injury to the University. And as a
matter of fact, it is the belief of a good many that
it would do a lot of good for the University as a
whole and for most car owners individually. How
ever, since we still have them, it wouldn't be a bad
idea for pedestrians and automobiles to get along.
Admitting that people have a right to walk in the
paved street when the walk is full of water holes,
many people feel that there are limits to this prac
tice. A little foresight on the part of students may
avoid useless and unfortunate accidents.
