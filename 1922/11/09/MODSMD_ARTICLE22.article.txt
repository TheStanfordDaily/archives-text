						ROOT FROM A ROOTER

■ A viewpoint published in the Daily today points
•out the fact that Nevada's yells were drowned out
by the Stanford rooting section. He also thinks
that the rooters were bawled out "because of the
lack of yell-leader entlftisiasm." In the case of
Nevada, that couldn't be helped because both sec
tions started several yells at the same time. More
over, Nevada started several just after Stanford did
during the first part of the game because she didn't
know Stanford was yelling. The Nevadans thought
at first that the noise they heard was a hum of con
versation. Hut after the bleachers had been bawled
out and came to life for the first time this season,
Nevada saw what it was all about, and the second
half was not so bad.
it is useless for students to crab about the "lack
of yell-leader enthusiasm." So far the majority of
them have not given the yell leader a chance. A
little co-operation in the future may help.
