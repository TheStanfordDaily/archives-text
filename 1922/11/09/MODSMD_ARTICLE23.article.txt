# STANFORD'S PART IN THE LINE
## 
### 
Stanford students certainly are not unappreciative
of the fact that their University was chosen, with
eleven others, as representative of American colleges
and universities as a whole when the subject of
memorial milestones in France was decided upon.
When the women of the University approach stu
dents in an effort to pin tags on them on this par
ticular occasion, there will be no need to run. Every
l)ody is certainly willing to contribute to this cause,
but nobody will be expected to contribute over 50
cents. It is a matter of number of subscribers that
will count in this matter, not amount of money. Tf
every student in the University were to give 15 cents
it would be enough.
