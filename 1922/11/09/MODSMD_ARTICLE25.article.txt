A1 Maden, '28, kicked oft' to his opponents' ten-yard
line when he stumbled over the dias upon arising.
Everett Washington, '27*4, returned Maden's argument
to the middle of the field. He was then penalized three
yards for tackling an unfair proposition. Two minutes
later he was thrown for a loss because of illegal ges
tures made with his right hand. He acted as though
reaching for his hip pocket. On the other hand, he
wore a diamond ring, and as the judges were stone
blind, they merely gave him five yards on offside. Three
minutes before the fire whistle blew, Washington hurled
his half back and his sentences back upon Maden's cen
ter, but to no avail, and on a grammatical error, the
latter was awarded a touchdown. Final score, 3-0.

A1 Maden, '28, kicked oft' to his opponents' ten-yard
line when he stumbled over the dias upon arising.
Everett Washington, '27*4, returned Maden's argument
to the middle of the field. He was then penalized three
yards for tackling an unfair proposition. Two minutes
later he was thrown for a loss because of illegal ges
tures made with his right hand. He acted as though
reaching for his hip pocket. On the other hand, he
wore a diamond ring, and as the judges were stone
blind, they merely gave him five yards on offside. Three
minutes before the fire whistle blew, Washington hurled
his half back and his sentences back upon Maden's cen
ter, but to no avail, and on a grammatical error, the
latter was awarded a touchdown. Final score, 3-0.
