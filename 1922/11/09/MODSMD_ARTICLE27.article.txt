Dear Sir: The rooters were bawled
out on Saturday at the Nevada game for
lack of enthusiasm or Stanford spirit.
Now, in justice to the rooters, let me
say that we have just as much Stanford
spirit as Stanford students ever had,
and we are behind the team to a man.
But one thing we object to is being re
quested to yell and drown out the op
ponents' rooting section—those are Cali
fornia's tactics—and the yell leaders
should take note that it is small stuff
to lead a yell when the other rooting
section is in the middle of one also.
Saturday we drowned out fully one-half
of Nevada's yelling—is that courteous
to a worthy opponent? NO!
Also, many of our yells were led in
the midst of plays and our attention was
on the game. Due warning of a yell and
what it is to be will aid the rooters, but
don't call for yells at the wrong time.
The rooters deserved a bawling out—
because of lack of yell-leader enthusiasm.
Use a megaphone and tell everyone
clearly what is coming and snap it out
at the right time, and give the other
side a chance, too. Dont let us adopt
Cal's "Drown-the-little-fellow" attitude,
and we will have some rooter spirit
shown—it's there, all right.
"ROOTER."
