Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In the November issue of the Stan
ford Pictorial it was stated that the poor
spirit shown at the rallies was "as much
the fault of the yell leader and his as
sistants as it was of the students." The
job of yell leader is a thankless one at
the best; so why lay blame on the three
individuals who are always present at a
rallyâ€”trying their best to get big noise
out of a little group? If the spirit of
the yell leaders wanes at times, it is
justified: for what could be more dis
couraging than to call a rally and not
have a large enough representation pres
ent to pay teaching them new yells which
the entire student body would not know
on the day of a game?
These men work hard and are always
ready to co-operate with any group de
siring to boost any type of team sup
port. Get a turnout and the yell leaders
will do their part.
