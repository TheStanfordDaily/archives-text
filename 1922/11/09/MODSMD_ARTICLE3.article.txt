## 
### (By United Press 
PARIS, Nov. 9. â€”Battling Siki, dusky
ruler of European heavyweights, is
facing disqualification as a fighter for
using his fist last night on Ferrand
Cuiv, the manager of Maurice Prunier,
French middleweight.
Siki was acting as a second for Bal
zac, former French middleweight
champion, and when Prunier knocked
his charge out in the eleventh round,
Siki became infuriated and took a
swing at the victor's manager.
