# MME. D’ALVAREZ TO GIVE CONCERT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Peruvian Singer Opens Series Of Peninsula Concerts With Program of Selected Arias 
### 
Mine. Marguerite D'Alvarez will give
a program in the Assembly hall tonight
at 8:15, as the opening concert of the
Peninsula Musical Association series.
An operatic prima donna has many
nationalities, for she belongs to the peo
ple of every land where she sings. This
is especially so in the case of Mme.
D'Alvarez. She was born in Lima,
Peru, of Spanish ancestry, but she has
lived the greater part of her life in
England.
Trained in Europe
Her musical training was obtained at
the Brussels Conservatory, and when
she graduated she was appointed court
singer for the late King Leopold of
Belgium. Later, while still under 20
years of age, she was engaged by Oscar
Hammerstein in the Manhattan Opera
Company. Following this, she sang in
opera at Paris, Madrid, Petrograd,
Rouen, and was specially engaged in the
title role of "Carmen" at the La Scala,
Milan. During the winter of 1914 she
returned to America as principal con
tralto of the Boston Opera Company,
and the following summer she was heard
at the Royal Opera, Convent Gardens.
Her success in America was spectacular
and she would have returned to Boston
but for the outbreak of the war. Since
that time she has devoted her talent to
concert work, with only a few excep
tions.
To Spend Season in America
Though her triumph in opera was
great, it has been exceeded by her suc
cess as a song recitalist. She will spend
this entire season in America, touring
from coast to coast. «*'
