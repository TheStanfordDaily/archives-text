# DOUGHTY IS INJURED IN SCRIMMAGE AND WILL BE OUT OF GAME
## 
### 
Just as Andy Kerr was about to shake
hands with himself on the fact that all
his men were in first-class condition, the
jinx appeared and sent Rae Doughty to
the side-lines with an injured shoulder.
Doughty was injured in the rain-and
mud scrimmage last night, and will be
out of the U. S. C. game Saturday. De-
Groot and Cleaveland are in the hos
pital, but more as a matter of precaution
than anything else. Dr. Barrow said
yesterday afternoon that both would be
ready to play Saturday.
While the loss of Doughty will
weaken the Card secondary defense,
Kerr has a capable reserve force on
which he can draw.
If Guy Dennis were a little heavier,
and better able to stand the heavy bat
tering, he would be the logical choice
to start at right half. As it is, however,
Paul Murray looks to be the best all
round man, so he may begin, with Dennis
in the offing. On several occasions Kerr
has used "Scotch" Campbell as half
back, so he may take a turn at bucking
the line and running the ends, instead of
calling the signals.
