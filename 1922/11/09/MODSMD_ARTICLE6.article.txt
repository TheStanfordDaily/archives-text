# Bentinck And Seward Speak At English Club Meeting
## 
### 
Richard Bentinck and Professor S. S.
Seward, Jr., spoke to the members of
English Club on the subject of the se
lection of a play for the annual English
Club stage production at the regular
meeting held last evening.
A new schedule of meetings was de
cided on. Regular meetings on the first
Wednesday of the month will be held
at the Women's Clubhouse, and on the
third Wednesday at the home of some
member. Rosemary Drachman will have
the next meeting at 19 Salvatierra.
English Club decided to undertake the
responsibility of having the grand piano,
which is downstairs in the clubhouse, re
polished. It is the personal property of
Mrs, Ewell, loaned by her to the stu
dents for three years, and it has been
marred by frequent use. No definite
plan for raising the money was decided
upon.
