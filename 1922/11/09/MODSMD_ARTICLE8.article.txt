# BIG CROWD TO SEE FRESHMAN WEST
## 
### 
Judging from the lists now being
checked over in living organizations, the
entire Freshman Class will be at the
California field Saturday afternoon to
watch their team rip into the Bruin
Cubs.
A Stanford section of 1000 seats has
been reserved by the graduate manager's
office 011 the west side of the bleachers.
Rooters' hats will be essential for ad
mittance to the rooting section, which
will occupy most of the block. Special
stunts are being arranged in which the
red and white hats are necessary.
Extra cars will be put on the 11:36
train up the peninsula, on which all fresh
men are asked to take the trip. Street
car service direct to the ferry and from
Oakland to Berkeley has also been pro
vided for, thus cutting down chances
of a mix-up on the way over.
With one day separating them from
the big battle, Hunt's eleven is down to
a fine edge and ready for all the young
Bears can offer. If any one still doubts
that "Husky" has developed a fighting
team of Babes, it would pay to go down
and watch their scrimmage and practice
for about five minutes.
Across the bay one of the best yearling
backfields on the Coast is lining up in
much the same sort of preparations.
With the return of Bill Blewett, the rear
rank is a thousand per cent more for
midable than it was during his absence.
Blewett is as close to an all-around
football player as it's possible to get.
He weighs 165 pounds, and is able to
crash into the line like a truck-horse. He
is also a star on the cinder track, and
uses his running to break away around
end; and when it comes to passing, he
can hurl the ball thirty yards with rea
sonable accuracy.
According to reports from the Cub
camp, about the only thing Blewett can't
do is kick, and that is attended to by
Captain Jimmy Dixon, whose toe will
lift the ball fifty yards in a given di
rection.
Then there is "Tut" Imlay, who works
with Blewett on the other half. Imlay
ii poison on end runs and passes, and
will keep Gil McDermot, Card end, ex
tremely busy all the time he's on the
offensive.
Quarterback Carlson is one of the Ev
erett High School eleven who did not
follow Bagshaw to Washington.
Hunt will not be the only one ready
with a substitute backfield to throw in.
Barnes and Toomey have several men
who get into every game, among them
Cook, a light, shifty full.
Fast men, though, are not the rule
on the California Peagreens. Leaving
Imlay out of calculations, there are no
players on the Berkeley squad capable of
breaking loose and upsetting the scores
like Kirwan, Cook and Clayes for the
Dinks.
On the line the California frosh have
a slight- advantage. But comparative
weights metm little to Hunt's front ranks.
They fought the U. S. C. line off its
feet down at Los Angeles, in spite of
an advertised fifteen pounds handicap.

of a mix-up on the way over.
With one day separating them from
the big battle, Hunt's eleven is down to
a fine edge and ready for all the young
Bears can offer. If any one still doubts
that "Husky" has developed a fighting
team of Babes, it would pay to go down
and watch their scrimmage and practice
for about five minutes.
Across the bay one of the best yearling
backfields on the Coast is lining up in
much the same sort of preparations.
With the return of Bill Blewett, the rear
rank is a thousand per cent more for
midable than it was during his absence.
Blewett is as close to an all-around
football player as it's possible to get.
He weighs 165 pounds, and is able to
crash into the line like a truck-horse. He
is also a star on the cinder track, and
uses his running to break away around
end; and when it comes to passing, he
can hurl the ball thirty yards with rea
sonable accuracy.
According to reports from the Cub
camp, about the only thing Blewett can't
do is kick, and that is attended to by
Captain Jimmy Dixon, whose toe will
lift the ball fifty yards in a given di
rection.
Then there is "Tut" Imlay, who works
with Blewett on the other half. Imlay
ii poison on end runs and passes, and
will keep Gil McDermot, Card end, ex
tremely busy all the time he's on the
offensive.
Quarterback Carlson is one of the Ev
erett High School eleven who did not
follow Bagshaw to Washington.
Hunt will not be the only one ready
with a substitute backfield to throw in.
Barnes and Toomey have several men
who get into every game, among them
Cook, a light, shifty full.
Fast men, though, are not the rule
on the California Peagreens. Leaving
Imlay out of calculations, there are no
players on the Berkeley squad capable of
breaking loose and upsetting the scores
like Kirwan, Cook and Clayes for the
Dinks.
On the line the California frosh have
a slight- advantage. But comparative
weights metm little to Hunt's front ranks.
They fought the U. S. C. line off its
feet down at Los Angeles, in spite of
an advertised fifteen pounds handicap.
Judging from the lists now being
checked over in living organizations, the
entire Freshman Class will be at the
California field Saturday afternoon to
watch their team rip into the Bruin
Cubs.
A Stanford section of 1000 seats has
been reserved by the graduate manager's
office 011 the west side of the bleachers.
Rooters' hats will be essential for ad
mittance to the rooting section, which
will occupy most of the block. Special
stunts are being arranged in which the
red and white hats are necessary.
Extra cars will be put on the 11:36
train up the peninsula, on which all fresh
men are asked to take the trip. Street
car service direct to the ferry and from
Oakland to Berkeley has also been pro
vided for, thus cutting down chances
of a mix-up on the way over.
