A Smart Top -Coat!
A "general utility" sort of a coat—to wear when
you sit on the shady side of the Stadium—or when
you head for the Libe on these cold nights!
Mannish in cut—fully silk lined—trimmed with
clez'er buttons and big patch pockets—at prices
that are really astonishing!

$25.00, $35.00 to $89.50
