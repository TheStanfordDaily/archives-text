# BABES FACE BRUIN CUBS AT BERKELEY TOMORROW
## Wet Field Will Not Spoil Hunt's Chances For Victory; Prospects Good for Stanford Serpentine. 
### Phil Newill, ’24 
As the bleachers empty over at Berkeley late tomorrow afternoon,
Cardinal rooters will have seen one of two things: Stanford serpentine
on a California gridiron for the first time since the return of American
football—or a miniature "wonder" team.
Eleven Cardinal freshmen are awaiting the "little big game." confi
dent of this much —that they will fight to the last inch against the Cali
fornians.
In almost every respect the Cubs have the edge. Their line, consid
ered the weakest part of the team, is slightly heavier than Hunt's. As
for the backfield, there are four men in the line-up, any one of whom

would be the making of an ordinary
yearling team. Blewett, Dixon, Im
lay, and Carlson are the Big Four,
and between them they can do just
about anything with a pigskin that
the rule-book allows.
But a little thing like edge never has
made any difference to Stanford teams,
and it will make still less to Hunt's fight
ing freshmen. Since that uphill battle
with the Trojan Peagreens, the Babes
know their strength, and if they don't
show it tomorrow it will be because some
one has locked up their opponents and
stolen the gridiron.
The Dinks' -backfield is not to be
sneezed at, either. Bill Cook, A1 Clayes,
and Nick Kirwan on open field forma
tions, and "Solly" Solomon, Ernie Nev
ers, "Buck" Faust, and Howard Mitchell
bending back the line is a double com
bination hard for any team to beat.
Jupiter Pluvius will be fighting on the
side of the Cards, for a wet field works
in Stanford's favor. It means that "Tut"
Imlay will not be able to break away for
ar.y long runs, and Skipper Jimmy Dixon
will be kicking a soggy football. For the
Dinks a slushy turf gives opportunity to
concentrate on the line-bucking game,
which tactics won against a heavier team
in the south last week.
Trick plays are not on "Husky's"
menu, anyway. Unless the Solomon-Mc-
Dermot aerial combination gets to work
ing, or Nevers gets around end, it will
be straight football from start to finish.
Cook and Clayes, who take turns mak
ing sudden dashes at the enemy's goal,
may get loose if the field is fast.
Today the squad was banished from
the football field. Talking or thinking
is taboo until the eleven climbs into mole
skins tomorrow, Hunt told his men at
the close of a short practice last night.
Freshmen leaving on the 11:31 special
to San Francisco will get over to the field
about the middle of th Stanford-Cali
fornia Goof game. Special intermediate
transportation to the U. C. campus has
been arranged.
The main event starts at 2:45.
Rooters' hats are an essential for ad
mittance to the Stanford section, as a
series of bleacher stunts have been
planned requiring them.


"Buck" Faust, who will carry the
ball on Hunt's offensive tomorrow. The
big halfback is expected to break
through the Blue and Gold for at least
one touchdown. '
