# GRAYS TANGLE WITH GOOFS AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
Coach Betts' Stanford Grays will
trot out on California Field to meet
the Blue and Gold Goofs tomorrow
afternoon, in a preliminary to the
freshman game, on the short end of
the odds.
The Grays were automatically la
belled the "underdogs" last Saturday
when the Goofs treated Coach Sum
mers' Mare Island Marines to a 14-13
licking. This same Marine team
downed Betts' squad by a 20-0 score
two weeks ago. This means little to
the Grays, however, for the team
which meets the Goofs tomorrow will
be different from the one that lost to
the sea soldiers â€”not in personnel but
in teamwork and football knowledge.
Betts has been drilling his team
hard in the past two weeks and the
results were evident with last Satur
day's 18-0 victory over the U. S. S.
Camden eleven. The Grays have had a
rather one-sided team with a strong
defense and little or no real offensive
strength. They have been called on
repeatedly to be the "goats" of Andy
Kerr's varsity offensive and until the
past two weeks have had little time to
develop an offensive of their own.
Whatever they lack in football knowl
edge and experience, however, they
will more than make up for in "fighting
spirit," according to Betts.
Cranmer, who played guard on Andy
Smith's 1921 varsity, is coaching the
Goofs and has a team which will aver
age close to 185 pounds. The Grays will
average about 175.
Work last night was confined to light
signal practice and fundamentals;
Coach Betts talked to the squad on
defense tactics.
The game will start at 1 o'clock.
Betts announced the lineup which
will start the game as follows: Center,
Williams; guards, Hays (captain) and
Rogers; tackles, McCombs and Long;
quarter, Fuller; halves, Erliorn and
Hamilton; fullback, Wright or Wood
head.
Other men who will probably break
into the game are: Crawford, guard;
Driscoll, tackle; Black, end; Grondona
and Cary, halves; Blacker, quarter.
