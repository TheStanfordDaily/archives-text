# RED CROSS DRIVE ON CAMPUS ENDS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Roll call in the Red Cross on the
campus is expected to close tonight with
nearly every student wearing a red but
ton. During the two days of the drive
all living groups have been canvassed,
and campaign captains are looking for a
100 per cent subscription when the re
turns are checked up.
Besides reaching all living group stu
dents, the faculty members, the homes
on San Juan hill, and students living in
Palo Alto have had a chance to con
tribute.
"Many families of disabled soldiers in
this neighborhood arc in need of Red
Cross help," announces Profesor H. R.
Fairclough, director of the canvass on
the campus. "Smyrna and the Far East
are also centers of Red Cross activity,
especially needy now.
"In order to help this work every living
group on the campus should boast of a
Red Cross window card, which is a sign
that all the occupants are wear'ng the
button."
