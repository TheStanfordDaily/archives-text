# GRIDIRON SEASON NOW IN FULL SWING
## EVEN BATTLE EXPECTED WHEN CARD VARSITY MEETS U.S.C. TROJANS IN CRITICAL GAME 
### 
With a clear sky predicted, Cardinal and Trojan will wage sixty minutes
of gridiron warfare on a soggy and slippery turf tomorrow afternoon to make
or break the southerners as runners-up for the Coast championship.
It will be big football—the biggest at Stanford so far this season —not pre
liminary stuff.
Three hundred rooters from Los Angeles, accompanied by a fifty-piece
band, and a scattering of sport scribes, have trekked northward to watch
Henderson's men defeat or be defeated.
There is little or nothing to choose between the teams. It is a case of
Ike-and-Mike-they-look-alike, and the result may hinge on whether Murray
Cuddeback can beat John Milton at kicking field goals. In the south the

Cardinal and Gold is regarded as al
ready "in"; the north decrees it will
be one of those "the breaks will de
cide" affairs.
Stanford may be weakened if the
last-minute loss of Rae Doughty, the
flashy halfback, affects its morale. It
is more likely, though, that Guy Den
nis, the hard-hitting, fighting skipper
of last year's freshman team, will make
them forget about Doughty.
They may talk of the kicking, pass
ing, and line-plunging of Art Wilcox,
the defensive strength of DeGroot, the
yard-gaining prowess of "Ironsides"
Baker, but the one that is apt to affect
the result the most has been over
looked. That is Jupiter Pluvius, who
has been on the job so much this
week that almost anything may hap
pen tomorrow.
1 he situation for the game is dram
atic. On one side is the heavier, more
untried eleven, with no past reputa
tion to uphold. It has developed fast,
but there still remains latent power. It
will fight—and fight hard—to prevent
its goal line from being crossed. Its
one desire is to win, because for two
years in succession it has met defeat.
That team is Stanford.
On the other side —a good team, its
worth already proved by holding Cali
fornia to a 12 to 0* score. It is com
posed of experienced players, and is
equipped with unusual plays and un
usual formations. The Trojans have
gridiron aspirations, and the desire to
continue their string of victories over
the Cardinal.
Andy Kerr, whose business is coach
ing not predicting, won't comment on
the score. For a week he has been
drilling his men for this battle and it
would be no surprise if Stanford un
loosed a strong offensive power to
morrow.
One thing that will bear watching
is the first quarter rush of the Card
inal. It hasn't been stopped yet, and
once the touchdown is made, the Cards
will be hard lo beat. Wilcox will prob
ably outkick CamiJbell or Anderson,
whoever does the booting for the Tro
jans.
Jim Lawson seems to have the call
over Dole at right end, and "Shorty"
Mertz will be on the other wing. Kerr
has either Houck or Faville for right
guard, but the chances are that Fa
ville will start. With the exception of
Dennis or Murray the Cardinal will
face the Trojans with the same line-up
that has started the last two games.
The contest will start at 2:30, since
there is no preliminary game.
