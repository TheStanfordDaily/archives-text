# ONE HUMP AFTER ANOTHER
## 
### 
When Stanford won from O. A. C, all the rooters
delightedly announced that the Cards were over the
hump. So they were, but now it seems that the same
remark will be in order for each successive victory
following the first Conference game. In order to
beat the Trojans tomorrow the Stanford men will
have to use everything they have. The game will
not only be one of the hardest of the season, but will
precede another counted equally as hard. And so
if Stanford does trim the men from the south they
will only have got over another of those many
humps.
This basis of judgment of Stanford's record by
humps, however, is not fair either to the coaches
or to the players themselves. The many handicaps
under which the coaching staff and the football team
are working this year are too numerous to mention.
Most of the students are familiar with them. To
have won all the games thus far is really more than
could have been expected under the circumstances.
But having come this far, Stanford can only hope to
go as far as good playing and good coaching under
limited time will take any team. The dope is un
doubtedly against the Cards, but it has been that way
before. Everybody is willing to leave the matter up
to the good judgment of Andy Kerr and his clan.
CALIFORNIA PULLS OUT
This post season game situation is rapidly becom
ing a farce in print. Page after page of valuable
space has been filled in sports editions all over the
West because Stanford resigned from the Confer
ence. And it was all because of a post-season game.
Now a California sport writer, who gives his ideas
to the public through the columns of an evening
paper in San Francisco, asks that California get a
chance at Washington and Jefferson. In the same
issue of this paper, California announces her inten
tion of keeping out of post-season games altogether
•this year. After the whole thing has been boiled
down the average follower of sports is going to be
iti a terrible frame of mind. He won't know which
team is representative, which will be the best game,
which will be a championship affair, and probably
will be in some doubt as to which teams are really
playing.
Picking a Conference champion may be a fine
thing in theory, but as it has worked out this year
it is not such a much after all. It may be that Stan
ford in arranging her post-season has been the wise
guy and will prove to others that there is such a
thing as success in independence.

CALIFORNIA PULLS OUT
This post season game situation is rapidly becom
ing a farce in print. Page after page of valuable
space has been filled in sports editions all over the
West because Stanford resigned from the Confer
ence. And it was all because of a post-season game.
Now a California sport writer, who gives his ideas
to the public through the columns of an evening
paper in San Francisco, asks that California get a
chance at Washington and Jefferson. In the same
issue of this paper, California announces her inten
tion of keeping out of post-season games altogether
•this year. After the whole thing has been boiled
down the average follower of sports is going to be
iti a terrible frame of mind. He won't know which
team is representative, which will be the best game,
which will be a championship affair, and probably
will be in some doubt as to which teams are really
playing.
Picking a Conference champion may be a fine
thing in theory, but as it has worked out this year
it is not such a much after all. It may be that Stan
ford in arranging her post-season has been the wise
guy and will prove to others that there is such a
thing as success in independence.
