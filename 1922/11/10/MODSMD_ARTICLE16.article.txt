# THE
						BIG LITTLE GAME

### 
The freshmen, like the Varsity, have the dope
against them tomorrow. Whether or not this means
anything will not he a matter for discussion after
tomorrow evening. "Ihtsky" I lunt and one of these
coaches fairly cat up odds. And so whether the
Babes win or not they may rest assured that the good
wishes of every Stanford man is with them.
