# AN ADDITIONAL SHOUTING SUCCESS
## 
### 
More real interest is being taken in rallies these
days than the most optimistic of Stanford students
could have been led to expect two weeks ago. What
has got into the present student body is too much for
the most of us. They must have taken the attitude
of the football team that no matter what the obstacle,
they will do their best. There is no other attitude for
Stanford men and women. It is that feeling that
has given Stanford its name and it is that feeling
that will keep Stanford in the ascendancy in the
future.
Stanford students are at last pulling together for

a common purpose. That they will win out in the
long run in spite of the odds is taken for granted.
The only thing to cement them together permanently
now is to take an active interest in the administration
of athletics as well as of student body affairs.
