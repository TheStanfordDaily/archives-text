(Owing to the time it takes the author to think up
something nasty or funny about the plays reviewed,
readers should not be disappointed if the attraction has
been gone a week or so. Apologies to Life).
♦ • *
The Hollow Tooth. A very hollow sort of plot, that
needs a lot of filling to make it seem sound. If the cast
were better drilled in their parts, it would be better, if
possible.
The Road to Menlo. Reviewed last week and will be
reviewed again next week. This is our week off.
Przymsyl. A Russian play with no morals. Will not be
shown in Palo Alto, except for amusement of Censor
Board. After they have been properly shocked, it will be
sent on to Redwood, as unfit for a moral college town.
P. S.: The bus fare to Redwood is twenty-four cents.
The Affairs of Calapsis. To be reviewed next week, or
last week, we forget which, because if it's the play we're
thinking of it's rotten.
Queener!
—"really don't see where she gets her line. And as
for looks, if 1 had to be tied down to a thing like that—"
—"may tell him it's naturally curly, but we fellows who
have batted about a little know the real thing—"
—"I says to her, 'But don't think I couldn't have a car if
I didn't want it. Dad says to me'" —
—"never take more than one, and only if it's real stuff.
None of this bootleg stuff for mine. Now I know a
friend who —"
—"didn't cut on me, you understand, but the El Tarzan
changed its date for their beer bust, and she felt that
she simply must wait up and see that her brother got in
all right. These Palo Alto girls are different —"
—"don't tell me about co-eds! Ain't I been around here
four years? Well, what if I don't queen? Don't I have the
use of my ears, and —"

Here is Reggie the Rough. Readers of this column
will both remember him as the originator of several
little ditties; Cabbages feels that he ought to be intro
duced to his readers, along with one of his latest
outbursts:
Poor man is never happy at his lot!
He always wants things changed from what he's got.
The weather, hot, is very far from well,
Yet when it's cold, it, then, is really hell!
39L'
Just think of how we, carefree, trod the road.
When iron-bound chains the speeding auto slowed,
Just think of how we used to smoke in quiet,
When now the cars make life an awful riot.
Ah, for the safety of the chains again.
E'en though they prove, to autoists, a bane,
I hate to feel that life, each day, alas!
Is at the mercy of each car to pass.

In case you stumble over a co'ed's feet in trying to
reach your seat, the proper method of procedure i.; to
glare at the offending co-ed, and say in a firm voice,
"Call in your dogs, girl, call in your dogs." ..This will
make her sorry you fell over her feet

Rules For Conduct No. 234
In case you stumble over a co'ed's feet in trying to
reach your seat, the proper method of procedure i.; to
glare at the offending co-ed, and say in a firm voice,
"Call in your dogs, girl, call in your dogs." ..This will
make her sorry you fell over her feet

(Owing to the time it takes the author to think up
something nasty or funny about the plays reviewed,
readers should not be disappointed if the attraction has
been gone a week or so. Apologies to Life).

The Hollow Tooth. A very hollow sort of plot, that
needs a lot of filling to make it seem sound. If the cast
were better drilled in their parts, it would be better, if
possible.
The Road to Menlo. Reviewed last week and will be
reviewed again next week. This is our week off.
Przymsyl. A Russian play with no morals. Will not be
shown in Palo Alto, except for amusement of Censor
Board. After they have been properly shocked, it will be
sent on to Redwood, as unfit for a moral college town.
P. S.: The bus fare to Redwood is twenty-four cents.
The Affairs of Calapsis. To be reviewed next week, or
last week, we forget which, because if it's the play we're
thinking of it's rotten.
Queener!
—"really don't see where she gets her line. And as
for looks, if 1 had to be tied down to a thing like that—"
—"may tell him it's naturally curly, but we fellows who
have batted about a little know the real thing—"
—"I says to her, 'But don't think I couldn't have a car if
I didn't want it. Dad says to me'" —
—"never take more than one, and only if it's real stuff.
None of this bootleg stuff for mine. Now I know a
friend who —"
—"didn't cut on me, you understand, but the El Tarzan
changed its date for their beer bust, and she felt that
she simply must wait up and see that her brother got in
all right. These Palo Alto girls are different —"
—"don't tell me about co-eds! Ain't I been around here
four years? Well, what if I don't queen? Don't I have the
use of my ears, and —"

Here is Reggie the Rough. Readers of this column
will both remember him as the originator of several
little ditties; Cabbages feels that he ought to be intro
duced to his readers, along with one of his latest
outbursts:
Poor man is never happy at his lot!
He always wants things changed from what he's got.
The weather, hot, is very far from well,
Yet when it's cold, it, then, is really hell!
39L'
Just think of how we, carefree, trod the road.
When iron-bound chains the speeding auto slowed,
Just think of how we used to smoke in quiet,
When now the cars make life an awful riot.
Ah, for the safety of the chains again.
E'en though they prove, to autoists, a bane,
I hate to feel that life, each day, alas!
Is at the mercy of each car to pass.
