With the first show of the season
gone but a few days, and with three
more now in the process of making,
campus dramatics are coming into the
middle of the quarter with a spurt.
Baffling Oriental mystery and con
juring, served up with puzzling passes
and bewildering gestures will be in
the ring on November 18, one week
before the Big Game. "Loong Fat" and
his associates promise something real
ly interesting in this evening of Orien
tal trickery, the financial benefits of
which will go to the Second Million
of the Endowment Fund. Hock How,
'25, and C. H. Lee, '23, who have charge
of the program, have done profes
sional work along this line on more
than one occasion, which augurs well
for the quality of the performance to
be put on.

The next of the three shows to pre
sent itself to the campus comes the
night of the Big Game, Nov. 25. "The
Football Frothies," as it is named,
consists of two acts filled quite full
with musical numbers and clever lines
calculated to make as big a hit as
did the Chappie Show of a year ago.
Hock Chalmers, '23, who is in charge
of the directing, states that the first
act is well under way towards the
final polish, and act two is just being
started on its practice term.

So many "last cries" are heard with
the announcement of new fashions in
coming shows that another mention
of the same is liable to bring a yearn
ing hope for something old-fashioned
for a change. But if a name counts
for anything, the Emile De Racat Cor
poration of San Francisco which is
designing some of the costumes for
use in the coming Ram's Head pro
duction, should show the. campus some
styles so late that short skirts would
seem to fade into the background of
the ninetenth century. Just what these
costumes are like is of course not
being divulged by those who guard
the secret. That information comes
later.

Then on Dec. 9 comes the annual
sophomore play. So far it is all in the
dark, except the known fact that try
outs are now being held. One thing
so far announced is that the play
selected is quite different from "Her
Husband's Wife," in that a large cast
will be required. The program hounds
will have something to keep them
busy this time.

The next of the three shows to pre
sent itself to the campus comes the
night of the Big Game, Nov. 25. "The
Football Frothies," as it is named,
consists of two acts filled quite full
with musical numbers and clever lines
calculated to make as big a hit as
did the Chappie Show of a year ago.
Hock Chalmers, '23, who is in charge
of the directing, states that the first
act is well under way towards the
final polish, and act two is just being
started on its practice term.

So many "last cries" are heard with
the announcement of new fashions in
coming shows that another mention
of the same is liable to bring a yearn
ing hope for something old-fashioned
for a change. But if a name counts
for anything, the Emile De Racat Cor
poration of San Francisco which is
designing some of the costumes for
use in the coming Ram's Head pro
duction, should show the. campus some
styles so late that short skirts would
seem to fade into the background of
the ninetenth century. Just what these
costumes are like is of course not
being divulged by those who guard
the secret. That information comes
later.

Then on Dec. 9 comes the annual
sophomore play. So far it is all in the
dark, except the known fact that try
outs are now being held. One thing
so far announced is that the play
selected is quite different from "Her
Husband's Wife," in that a large cast
will be required. The program hounds
will have something to keep them
busy this time.
