To The Editor:
In the November issue of the Stanford
Pictorial is an editorial entitled "Is
There a Yell Coming?" This editorial
states that the poor bleacher spirit is
as much the fault of the yell leader and
his assistants as of the students, and also
accuses the yell leader of discourtesy
because he did not send one of his as
sistants to lead the women present at
the rally.
If the writer of this editorial would
consider his viewpoint in another light
he might be able to see that our yell
leader is doing his utmost to work up
Stanford spirit among those in whom it
is most lacking. That he did not favor
the women in this case was no discour
tesy to them, because he was putting all
his energy where it was most needed,
and in doing so recognized the spirit of
the women as much better than that of
the men.
The trouble does not lie with the yell
leader, but it does lie with students who
do not get behind him and help him keep
alive the bleacher spirit. There are too
many who would rather criticize at their
leisure than get out at the proper time
and help build up the spirit of our
bleaclur rallies.

In the November issue of the Pictorial
Review appears an editorial under the
caption, "Is There a Yell Coming?"
This editorial contains a criticism of
our yell leaders, which in addition to be
ing extremely personal, could not be
better calculated to strike at that ele
ment which is most vital to the building
up of a real Stanford spirit: the element
of loyalty.
No captain of a team can hope to lead
his men to victory unless he knows that
every man in that team has confidence
in his leadership. No yell leader can in
spire -enthusiasm in a bunch of rooters,
who, instead of making every effort to
co-operate with the leader, try to seize
every opportunity to disconcert him or
criticize him. But, as if that were not
enough to take the heart out of any yell
leader on earth, the author of this edi
torial lands a wallop below the belt that
ought to make every loyal Stanford man
boil.
We are going to win the Big Game, not
by criticizing the team and the coach
and the other men who are doing their
best, but by showing them that wc have
faith in every one of themâ€”including
the yell leaders.
CHESTER CASSELL, '23.
