### PAUL CLYDE 
San Francisco Chronicle
football, that predictions, even if in
play a part in the game of American
There are so many factors that may
teresting, are not apt to be reliable.
This is so even when the relative
strength of teams is known. It is more
so in the case of tomorrow's game for
the power of neither Stanford nor the
University of Southern California has
been determined.
On the basis of games played this
season it is obvious that both univer
sities have hard-hitting teams, and
comparative scores indicate that the
game will be something approaching
a fifty-fifty struggle. Further than this
little can be said.
The predictions of those who are
overly optimistic and those who are
overly pessimistic seem equally ab
surd, on the basis of past performance,
which alone be used as a founda
tion for judgment.
We do know, however, that Stanford
has improved with each game, that in
the Nevada contest the team showed
the punch and spirit which has made
many Stanford elevens famous, and
finally that it will give its best tomor
row.
Nothing more could be asked of any
team, and Stanford men and women
should be satisfied with the result.
