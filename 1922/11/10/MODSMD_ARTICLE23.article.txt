Sentiment only could inspire me to
predict a victory for Stanford over the
Trojans. Inasmuch as every kind of
dope anybody can figure out is all
against the Cardinal, it seems almost
foolish to say that they will win. But
any time a football team makes such
rapid strides toward its ultimate goal
—victory—as the Stanford varsity has,
then it is time for all the dopesters
to stand to one side. I leave it to Andy
Kerr. Tiny Thornhill, Dud DeGroot
and Company.
P. S.: 1 will accept invitations to din
ner until payday if U. S. C. walks off
with the gravy.
