San Francisco Call
U. S. C. is coming to Stanford fully
prepared to defeat the Cardinal eleven.
Henderson says he will use seven men
in his line, as follows: two ends, two
tackles, two guards, and one center.
In the backfield he will have four
players to be officially designated as
â€¢rback, left halfback, right half
and fullback. Andy Kerr is not
outgeneraled; he will use seven
n his line also as follows: one
, two guards, two tackles, and
ids. The Cardinal backfield will
be composed of one fullback, right
halfback, left halfback, and a quarter
back. ,
To say that the team which propels
the ball over the enemy goal line the
most times would win would be er
roneous, but the team that scores the
most points is certain to win.
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson said Cali
fornia would win by 28 points. After
the California contest he said he
wanted to be known as "Cheerful
Gush" and he now declares that the
Trojans will win by 21 points. Laugh
all of that off.
Henderson's proteges make great
use of the deception play. He has a
rattling good backfield but his line is
not such a much. Stanford has a strong
first defense and a mighty smart sec
ondary defense. The question again
arises, as it did against Andy Smith's
eleven, as to whether the Trojans can
receive a team that is mighty well
versed in straight football tactics.
The Trojans on the dope should
score a victory but if they do some
scribes will be ransacking the Armen
ian Relief Drive box looking for shoes.
