Doping out a football game is like
trying to get someone on the tele
phone. You always get the wrong num
ber. But "Brick" Morse takes a chance
and has not lost any of
ealth yet, so here goes:
ran U. S. C. team, with Roy
,1e battering ram, will defeat
atanioru uy two touchdowns. Stanford
will score first, but experience and
power will tell in the long run. It

should be the best game of the year
and if the Stanford boys come
through with a victory they will have
played over their heads and will de
serve undying praise.
