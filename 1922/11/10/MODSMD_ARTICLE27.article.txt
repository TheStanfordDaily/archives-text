While as a rule I hesitate to put forth
the real inside dope on coming foot
ball games, under the circumstances
I am willing to let the readers of the
Daily Palo Alto in on the fact that I
have placed the full amount of my en
tire gambling budget for the present
week 011 Stanford, even money, to win.
(One $).
Considerations prompting my selec
tion of the winner are, I—the general
effectiveness of Minsky's plunging. 2 —
a firm belief that Walter Heirs will be
stopped before reaching the Stanford
goal line.
Much has been said of the greater
weight of the U. S. C. backs. How
ever, it will be an easy matter for
Coach Kerr on offense to shift De-
Groot, Pheney, and Ludeke to the back
field which will undoubtedly give the
Cardinals a speedy and hard-hitting
combination for carrying the ball.
Outside of this I agree with every
thing that lias been said, and like some
others, I hope not to be begging nour
ishment Sunday.
