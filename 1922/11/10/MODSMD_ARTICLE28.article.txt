Whether the Cardinal waves or
wavers over the Stanford stadium to
morrow depends largely on whether
Andy Kerr's tribe can stop the Trojan
backfield composed of Baker, Dolley,
Kincaid, and Campbell. Despite the
return of "Swede" Boyle to the U. S.
C. line, the Stanford pack will have
a clear edge and if the Cardinal de
fense holds out, the Reds should tri
umph by a small score.
Southern California has beaten
Stanford in their last three gridiron
engagements. It is about time that the
Trojans are ushered out of number
two position in the Coast football
derby.
