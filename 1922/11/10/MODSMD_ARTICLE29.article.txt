Saturday's game will, according to
all advance dope, be the hardest on
the Cardinal schedule to date. The
score will depend upon the Stanford
team going as strong as the' Oregon
and the Nevada games indicated they
will.
Courtwright, the Nevada coach, said
after the game last week that Stanford
has a stronger drive than U. S. C„ but
that we have a comparative weak de
fense against forward passing. I am
inclined to believe Courtwright's opin
ionon the latter point was without
sufficient foundation. However, the
Cardinal defense is better than it has
seen in two years.
Despite late injuries, I believe Stan
ford is seven points—or more —better
than U. S. C.
