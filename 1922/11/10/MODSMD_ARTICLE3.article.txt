"Although we haven't beaten U. S. C.
since the return to the American game,
and have never beaten the California
freshmen, this is the first time our teams
can be said to have gone in with an even
break," said "Dink" Templeton, track
coach and former football star, at the
pavilion rally for the varsity and fresh
men elevens last night.
Approximately one thousand men
marched down to the basketball pavilion
under the leadership of Assistant Yell
Leaders Huneke and Lapp.
Concerning systems of coaching Tem
pleton said that success depends not so
much on the type of play taught as the
way in which men are prepared to fill
vacancies c,n the Varsity. • "Freshmen arc
learning the Warner system, and will
not have to be taught how to pkv foot
ball next year," he said. "Berts' Grays
cannot be given too much credit for the
way they have taken the knocks from
the Varsity without any prospect of hero
worship or glory."
Yell Leader Minsky held practice in
songs and yells, and introduced the yells
which have been decided on for use the
rest of the season. He asked that root
ers at the U. S. C. game fill the section
from the bottom up, as stunts have been
planned which will require the lower
portion of the section to be full.
Grinstead's orchestra and the Stanford
band furnished the music.
