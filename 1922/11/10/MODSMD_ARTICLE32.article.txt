# HARD FIGHT, SAYS COACH
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt, who is sending
his freshmen eleven against the
California Cubs tomorrow, believes
that fight will win the 1926 squad's
Big Game.
"No matter what the conditions are
up there, we're going in to scrap,"
said Hunt. "It'll be a hard game. I
know all the California players—four
of them played on my Berkeley high
teams for three years—and I know
they'll give us a battle.
"There will probably be some Stan
ford men in there who have never
been in action before —that's what won
for us at U. S. C."
