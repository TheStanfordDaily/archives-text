# Seniors Take Game From First Year Hockey Team
## 
### 
Freshmen hockey players went down
to a 2 to 1 defeat at the hands of the
seniors in the third of the inter-class
practice games played yesterday after
noon. Myrtle Klahn and Josephine
Scott made the winning goals for the
seniors.
The senior team showed very good
form for its first game this season. They
presented an unusually strong defense,
and exhibited good teamwork throughout
their play. The freshmen also showed
up well against the more experienced
players, as is evidenced by the small score
to which they held their opponents. How
ever, they lacked the ability to put the
ball over the senior goal line.
Next Tuesday the freshmen play their
third match, when they meet the Sopho
more Class. The sophomores have a
strong team, which won from the juniors
last Tuesday, while the juniors defeated
the freshmen by a 5 to 0 score in the
first game played. All four teams are
showing rapid improvement, and hopes
are high for victory in the matches with
California, to be played here Novem
ber 25.
