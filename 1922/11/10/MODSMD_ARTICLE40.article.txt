# PROGRAM STUDENT DRIVES ANNOUNCED BY SERVICE BOARD
## 
### 
The program of appeals to students
for various charitable enterprises, so far
as applications have been received by the
Social Service Board, is as follows:
This quarter the joint campaign will be
for the benefit of the Near East Relief,
the Stanford-in-China Fund, for the pur
pose of maintaining a Y. M. C. A. sec
rotary for Chinese students in China, and
the Students' Friendship Fund (Euro
pean Student Relief). Next quarter the
joint campaign will be for the benefit of
the Y. \V. C. A.and the Y. M. C. A. for
local work, and in the spring quarter the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
The Social Service Board will an
nounce any additions to each quarterly
problem whenever they are made in ac
cordance with the new plan that only
one organized campaign with personal
solicitation shall be held each quarter.
This action was taken at a meeting of
the Social Service Board yesterday aft
ernoon. The Board further arranged
the details by which these campaigns are
to be conducted, especially with reference
to the presentation of the subscription
blanks and the collection of money. All
the appeals will be listed on a subscrip
tion blank and each student will be ap
proached by only one person, a student,
appointed by the committee in charge of
the general campaign, who will be the
only one permitted to present the sub
scription blank and to receive money.
The Board also took formal act'on re
quiring the committee in charge of each
quarter's campaign to co-operate with
the Social Service Board in avoiding per
sonal pressure upon the students so
licited.
