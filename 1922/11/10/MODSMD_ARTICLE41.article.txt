# BEAR CUBS PRESENT STRONG LINE-UP FOR LITTLE BIG GAME
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 10. (Special Dis
patch).â€”When the California freshmen
football team meets the Stanford Babes'
aggregation Saturday at Berkeley it will
be with the usual reputation of being one
of the biggest and strongest teams to
represent the University in years.
And yet through the season report
after report has been issued to the effect
that injuries to the stars made the out
come of each succeeding game doubtful.
Whether these reports were for the ben
efit of watchful Stanford backers or not,
the California Babes succeeded in win
ning every game as it came along, and
by a comfortable margin, too.
Two weeks ago the U. S. C. Babes
traveled to Berkeley for a game with the
1926 gridders. The final score stood 3-3.
Then a week later the Stanford 1926
team traveled to Pasadena and gained a
10-9 verdict over the same team. At the
same time Berkeley High and California
Babes were struggling in a contest which
ended with California on the top of a
46-0 score.
The game will be hotly fought and vic
tory will not be easy. The Stanford
Babes will have to watch for the speedy
end runs of Dixon, California halfback,
as well as his passing and clever defen
sive play. In the backfieid with him are
a trio of stars in Blewett, Dodson, and
Cook. Imlay, quarter, is also a fast and
dangerous broken field runner. Carlson,
another quarter, has managed the team
in several games and is a steady man at
the pivot position. Schaffnit at end is
fast in getting down under punts, dan
gerous when on the receiving end of a
pass, and a hard tackier.
On the line Francis at tackle stands
out as a stonewall on defense and a fast,
low-charging man on offense. The team
is well-balanced and Coaches Barnes and
Toomey have had plenty of material with
which to work. The same line-up used
against the U. S. C. frosh will probably
face the Stanford Babes Saturday. The
line-up: Schaffnit, right end; Francis,
right tackle; Saundby, right guard; Ball,
center; Angier, left guard; Carey, light
tackle; Mell, left end; Carlson, quarter;
Dixon, right half; Dodson or Blewett,
left half, and Cook, forward.
