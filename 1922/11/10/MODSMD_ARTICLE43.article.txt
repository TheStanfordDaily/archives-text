Leland Stanford, '24, arguing for the
negative on the question that junior col
leges should be abolished in California,
won a decision over Emmet McCaffery,
'24, in a debate held at the regular meet
ing of Nestoria last night in Room 12
of the Law building.
McCaffery maintained that junior col
leges do not measure up to the standards
set by full-fledged universities, for they
are independent and in most cases merely
adjuncts to high schools. Stanford based
his argument on the principle of economy;
first, for the student who is able to at
tend a less expensive institution for his
first two years; and, second, for the pub
lic upon whose shoulders falls the burden
of establishment and maintenance.
