# MME. Dâ€™ALVAREZ OPENS ELEVENTH CONCERT SEASON
## 
### 
In opening the eleventh season of the
Peninsula concerts last night in the As
sembly hall, Madame Marguerite
D'Alvarez, the Peruvian contralto, gave
a program which entirely won over her
audience from the first selection to the
last encore.
Mme. D'Alvarez has a voice capable
of a large range of notes, from rich con
tralto to delicately shaded mezzo-soprano.
An underlying tragic theme characterized
almost every number which she gave.
Such compositions as "Tu sei morta," by
Monteverde; "The Tryst," by Sibelius,
and "La Chevelure," by Debussy, called
out the deep emotional tones in her voice.
Mme. D'Alvarez sang Giordani's "Caro
mio Ben" with unusually soft and deli
cately rounded notes.
"El Pano" and "La Zagalina," from the
popular Spanish, with two English folk
songs, were of a gayer and lighter char
acter than the rest of the program.
One of the most enjoyable sections of
the concert was the piano numbers by
Miss Lois Maier, the accompanist. "On
Wings of Song," by Mendelssohn-Liszt,
was especially suited to her light and
graceful touch. "Capriccio in B minor,"
by Brahms, was in the same gay theme
and completely delighted the audience.
