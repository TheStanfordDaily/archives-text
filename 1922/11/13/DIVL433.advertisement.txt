At the Game Saturday
SOMEBODY dropped his watch
and it was during one of those
tense quiet moments. And some
body who had been in the army got
excited and bawled out, 'Hey,
Buddy! You dropped your mess
kit." Now there isn't any moral to
this, but we've got watches that
don't rattle like a mess-kit does.
Thank you.
