## 1400 LIVES LOST IN EARTHQUAKE IN CHILE 
### (By United Press 
SANTIAGO, Chile, Nov. 13.—Four
teen hundred persons lost their lives
in a devastating earthquake and tidal
wave which rent the coast of Northern
Chile early Saturday, according to the
most accurate available estimates to
day.
Starvation, pestilence and exposure
are claiming additional victims in the
wake of the disaster and relief car
avans are pushing to aid homeless
inhabitants of the stricken territories.
Communication with the shattered
towns along the coast from Valparaizo
to Antofogasta, the district which bore*
the brunt of the shock and the up
heaval of the Pacific, was still disrup
ted, but couriers brought word to the
capital of whole villages levelled by
the quake, with survivors, wounded,
lying by hundreds in the streets.
The largest quake, felt over the en
tire South American continent, and
registered on seismographs all over
the world, lasted for over three hours,
although it was perceptible to human
senses only two minutes. It came at
midnight, after a day of terrific heat.
Although the shock was felt north and
south along the coast, it is believed to
have extended even farther from east
to west.
The Pacific ocean for three hundred
miles along the north Chile coast ap
pears to have been rent along the bot
tom. Then the great tidal wave swept
in. Rushing up across the land, batter
ing down everything in its path, the
moutainous sea receded after a few
minutes, dragging humans, houses,
overturned vessels and a great mass of
debris along in the undertow.
The huge wave, perhaps the greatest
that ever spread over the Pacific,
reached Honolulu in one direction and
Africa in the other. At least this is the
cause attributed by scientists for the
small tidal wave early Sunday on the
Gold coast of the Gulf of Guinea.
