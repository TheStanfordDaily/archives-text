# Varsity Loses To Trojan Eleven, 6-0
## BACKFIELD DISORGANIZED BY INJURY TO ART WILCOX; U.S.C. DEFENSE STRONG 
### GARRETT ELMORE 
The football fates dealt Andy Kerr and the Stanford varsity a mighty queer
hand Saturday afternoon. In the first minutes of play Art Wilcox wan
knocked unconscious while tackling Otto Anderson, and Kerr was left with
out any really experienced backs in the first big game of the season.
Then several minutes later there cqme a costly fifteen-yard penalty, a
Trojan offensive flash —and U. S. C. had the ball on the Stanford ten-yard
line. By an irony of fate, Quarterback Dolley called for one of the Card's
best ground-gainers—the double criss-cross. It worked for the only time in
the afternoon, and Campbell plunged through center for nine yards. Dolley
himself took the ball over from the one-yard line.
Thus, by a score of 6 to 0, the Cardinal and Gold of Southern California,
instead of the Cardinal of Stanford, came to wave over the Stadium.
It was a game of hard, driving football, with Stanford trying for the rest of
the sixty minutes to push over the touchdown that would tie or win, since

Johnston had blocked Milton's drop
kick in the try-for-a-point. But the Tro
jan defense was as strong as that of
the Cards themselves, and the Stanford
attacks always fell short.
Kerr sent Cleaveland in for Wilcox,
and the substitute halfback played the
rest of the game, holding his own in
the kicking, and hitting the line like a
veteran.
Henderson was carel'ul not to let
Stanford have any advantage. His star
end, John Milton, was reposing on the
bench when the Cards started a drive
at the end of the first quarter. Dennis,
who had started in Doughty's place,
tore off live around Boice's end,
and repeated on the next play. Hen
derson immediately jerked Boice, and
sent in Milton. Cleaveland plunged
through left tackle, for first downs, but
U. S. C. then stiffened, and he kicked
forty-five yards.
ft was not until the fourth quarter
that things looked propitious again for
a Stanford score. Bob Cravens, who
had been breaking through the line on
nearly every play, intercepted a pass
from G. Campbell. Cleaveland hurled
a nine-yard pass to Jim Lawson, and
Cuddeback went four yards for first
downs. Cleaveland and O. Anderson
exchanged kicks, and then Woodward
tossed a nice pass to Dennis, who
leaped high in the air to get it. But the
Stanford rally was stopped a minute
later when Calland grabbed another
pass.
At. only one fime did things look
critical for Stanford. Galloway's punt
at the end of the third quarter rolled
directly in front of the goal line. On
the second play Cleaveland kicked, but
a U. S. C. man was detected holding,
and the Cards were given the ball on
the forty-yard line.
Fast-charging linesmen made both
teams look bad on the offense. Except
for once when Campbell got away, the
Trojans' wide end runf were stopped
behind the line of scrimmage. Mertz,
Johnston, DeGroot, and their mates,
took turns in smearing Trojan plays.
Vice versa, Hawkins, Newman, and
C&lland bothered the Stanford backs
a lot.
Captain DeGroot, just out of the
hospital, played the most spectacular
and probably the best game of anyone
on the field. He always brought the
runner to earth in the first half, after
a half dozen or so of his teammates
had missed their tackles. The poor
tackling was due more to over-eager
ness and over-running, rather than to
failure to hang on.
Stanford rooters were out in force
with their red and white caps, and put
on several stunts in between halves.
A crowd estimated at 20,000 was on
hand to watch the game.
