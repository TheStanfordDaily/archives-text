# SENIORS, SOPHOMORES WIN CLASS CONTESTS
## 
### 
Inter-class football is here to stay,
judging from the great exhibition of fight
and technique put up by the elevens in
the opening contests of the season Sat
urday morning, in which the sophomores
downed the freshmen, 7 to 0, and the
seniors were victorious over the juniors,
14 to 0.
These were the first intramural foot
ball games played here since Stanford's
return to the American game. It is '
planned to make this sport the biggest
event in intramural athletics in future
1
years.
The manner in which the teams handled
themselves was surprising. They were
well coached, showed knowledge of the
game in all its fundamental details and
fought doggedly.
Babes' Defeat Surprise
The defeat of the freshmen, who have
had weeks of preparation, was a distinct
surprise. The senior victory was ex
pected. Glenn Pollard's heavy line, av
eraging better than 185 pounds, carried
the day by virtue of sheer strength.
Quarterback Ken Nef and Jim Coplen
at fullback rhiped big holes in the junior
defense, accounting largely for the '23
victory. McHose, quarterback for the
juniors, was the most brilliant performer
on the field.
Late in the first period he reached up
out of a mass of seniors and snagged a
25-yard pass from Thatch Taylor. This
gave the '24 men the ball on the senior
10-yard line and Taylor made five through
left guard. The juniors fumbled the ball
on the next play, the Sombreros recover
ing and punting out of danger.
Juniors Block Kick
Early in the second period the seniors
carried the ball to their opponents' 15-
yard line, where they attempted a drop
kick, which was blocked. The juniors
punted, but a moment later the seniors
came right back, Nef going twelve yards
through center to the 20-yard line. Garth
gained ten through center and then Cop
len hit left guard for the touchdown.
Phelps kicked goal.
The winners added to their score in
the third period when Taylor dropped a
punt, the seniors recovering on the '23
30-yard line. A 20-yard pass, Coplen to
Kelly, put the ball within scoring dis
tance. Nef made seven yards through
center and then Coplen went over from
the three-yard line. Phelps again added
the extra point.

break was the reason for the 7-0 defeat
of the freshmen.
Neither team was able to do anything
until the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Then, after a series of line bucks and
off-tackle plays had carried the ball to
the corner of the field close to the fresh
man goal, Londahl shoved it across.
Kohler made the try for goal. Immedi
ately after the touchdown the freshmen
came to life and showed the only organ
ized fight the 1926 team put up during
the whole game. After the kick-oflf the
ball was run back to mid-field. Tucker
tore through left tackle for twenty yards,
a fifteen-yard pass, Lloyd to Condit, was
completed.
Thede was the keystone of the sopho
more backfield and the key to their at
tack. With him were Mason, Harrell,
and Londahl, who played well but showed
the lack of condition. Condit, at center,
played the best game for the freshmen..
