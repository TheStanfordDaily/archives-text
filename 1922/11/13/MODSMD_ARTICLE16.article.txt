# THE 						TUNNEL
## 
### 
Last Friday it was declared that Andy Kerr and
his squad had to go over one hump after another.
The U. S. C. game was pointed out as one of the
last and most formidable humps of all. The dope
was against the Cards, and for once the dope was
right. Despite unfortunate backfield injuries and
bad breaks, the Cards held the score down to a six
point margin. With all the regulars in, the score
might have been closer. But now that it's over and
Stanford has lost to a worthy opponent, we can all
at least say that Andy Kerr has tunneled through one
hump to the next in the shape of the University of
Washington. And a good many seem to feel that
the next hump will not he tunneled.
