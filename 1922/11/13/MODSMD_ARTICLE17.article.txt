We've been thinking for the past four years that
the war was over. Now we know it. In the midst
of the excitement over the week-end, it seemed that
nobody stopped to think what the eleventh of No
vember really meant. And late Saturday evening
when people did think of it, very few were heard
blowing- about their war records. It took four years
to convince some of the boys, but the argument
finally got across. So far as the battles are con
cerned, the war is definitely over, and so far as the
vocal campaigns are concerned, they have died down
enough so that we can say an armistice has been
signed, anyway. Perhaps from now on Armistice
Day may be made to mean something worth while.
