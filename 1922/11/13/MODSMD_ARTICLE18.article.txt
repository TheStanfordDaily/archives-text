# THE 						GOOD AND BAD OF THE AUTOMOBILE
## 
### 
The Daily is in receipt of a communication regard
ing the car situation on the campus, and in order to
give the public a chance to hear another's views on
the subject, the latter is published in today's Another
Viewpoint column.
The writer of this communication points out to
"local intellects" that there "ARE people here who
use cars for other than idle purposes." First among
these are the people who live at some distance from
the Quad. The automobile solves the time problem
for them. The second advantage pointed out is the
fact that the auto "materially aids in the teaching of
-several courses of study at Stanford." Among the six
which the writer of the letter is able to mention
"without having to exert any mental efifort to call
them to mind" is biological research. Presumably,
lie refers to the auto bugs.
Further, "If this be not evidence enough, it seems
no great amount of intelligence should be necessary
for one to realize that the expeditious transaction of
much of the business connected with the Quad of
last year, not to mention other student Ixuly activi
ties, would have been seriously handicapped were it
not for the use of the student-owned automobile."
So far as the editorial board of the Daily is able to
remember, the use of student-owned automobiles as
connected with campus publications in the past has
been for the "expeditious transaction of business con
nected with" not the Quad or anything similar, but
with gentlemen residing on the road to Portola.
Those who drive their cars ONTO the campus are
supposedly harmless characters. It is the car owner
who drives his machine OFF the campus and in the
wrong direction that brings the enthusiasts of bio
logical research into the scope of a general criticism
of fundamental faults with the automobile situation
at Stanford. It is the man who goes out with all
the good intentions of making biological investiga
tions and ends up with fishing bugs out of bad gin
who makes it hot for the rest of the car owners.
Moreover, if all cars were one-passenger models,
the condition here would not be so bad. But for

every ill-advised car owner there are three or four
ill-advised companions who, when assembled to
gether with r.apid transportation at their service,
heed not the call of the bugs and nuts that live in
books, but go forth for a little fun. Take away the
cars and then the call of the wild will no longer be
so much of a temptation, and in the long run stu
dent activities and the/various researches will benefit
by it.
The writer of the letter would apply Dr. Wilbur's
philosophy on the athlctic situation to the automo
bile question. Very well. Let us repeal the Vol
stead act and all other laws designed to correct social
evils. Then all those who have no better sense than
to play with the fire will get burned. And while a
large number were scorching themselves because
they were irresponsible, a few would reap benefit
without injury to themselves.
No, kind folks, society doesn't work that way.
The laissez-faire policy has long been abandoned
by social workers. If the people don't know what is
good for them, then those who do know will supply
what is good for the people.
Jn the interests of Stanford and the Stanford
student body as a whole, the automobile ought to
go. And in banning the car, Stanford would be far
from the first University to take that action.
