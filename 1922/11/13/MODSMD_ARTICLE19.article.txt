Having once more been stirred into a frenzy of
quivering indignation by the quotation in our presence of
such hits of the Asylum season of 1909 as, "The Kitten's
Tonsils," and "That's the turtle's hooray," we take a
firm typewriter in hand to retaliate.

"The Hen's Earlpbes"—try this one on the Castilleja
favorite that just adores campus dances —"they're sort
of different, don't you think?"
* • *
And when you get your health back you might use
this one on the California import that is just sure some
of the boys have been drinking: "Kid. you're the Gnat's
GnoseV

By that time you will be the hit of the evening. Just
pull one more —"Lady, you're the gopher's pin-feathers,"
and the whole outfit will be rocking with merriment.
Rocking you, probably.

But don't let that bother you. Walk right up to the
chaperones and say, "And how do you like the new
warden?" You will get a practically instantaneous re
sponse—quite sincere and unaffected. Don't get your
crutches too long, or you'll cramp your shoulders.

"And is it always this hot?" asked the visitor.
"Yes'm. This here aip't a starter to what it'll be in
August."
"Whew. How do you tell when spring leaves off and
summer begins?"
"Mister, see them squirrels. When it's summer them
sqirrels quits sitting in the shade and climbs up on
them there steam lines to keep cool."

Hints on how to spend the long winter evenings:
1. Match syllabus fees with the freshmen. (Lay off the
Bonehead English stars.)
2. Steal the house-manager's study lamp. This will
cause the simple soul no end of honest fun. Then tell
him you're sorry but you won't be able to pay your
house bill this month, and watch him choke with hilarity.
3. Put in a long distance call for the Mayor of Santa
Fe, New Mexico. By this time you will probably be able
to think up a lot more by yourself.

Hip boots are passe for formal wear this season.
Not many derbies will be seen on the smarter sections
of the Quad this fall.
Pajamas, we are told, will not b£ quite the thing for
morning wear in the Engineering department.
The day of frock coats is almost past among the
younger Gymnasium crowds.

Hi Frosh says he's sorry to see this here campus
falling for this Bolsheveeky stuff. He says the campus
ain't no place for a Union, but as long as there's got to
be one he'd a darned sight rather see it a Men's Union
than a Women's Union because it's hard enough to get
a date now and heaven help us if they went and got
organized.
