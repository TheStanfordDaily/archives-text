To the Editor:
Georges Clemenceau once made a speech
in the French Chamber of Deputies
favoring the passage of a bill providing
for the establishment of an adequate
water supply for certain cities, and as he
sat down he was scornfully asked by one
of his opponents—a man noted for his
contempt for the bath—what possible use
might be made of so much water?
Clemenceau replied, "My dear sir, there
ARE people in France who use water for
other than drinking purposes."
This remark applies by way of analogy
to a situation 011 the Stanford campus.
It seems never to have occurred to sev
eral local intellects that there ARE peo
ple here who use automobiles for other
purposes than idle pleasure.
An automobile is a vehicle, the eco
nomic possibilities of which need 110
enumeration. There are not a few stu
dents who, for perfectly good reasons,
find it necessary 01* desirable to live at
some distance from the Quad and to these
the automobile offers a solution of the
time problem.
Moreover, there are plenty of cases in
which the possession of automobiles by
students has materially aided in the teach
ing of several courses of study at Stan
ford. I can name six such courses with
out having to exert any mental effort
to call them to mind, and I daresay there
are others. In the spring quarter the
writer of this article plans to take up a
problem in biological research, the ade
quate solution of which demands a means
of rapid transportation. The automobile
shall furnish that means.
If this be not evidence enough, it seems
no great amount of intelligence should
be necessary for one to realize that the
expeditious transaction of much of the
business connected with the Quad of last
year, not to mention other student body
activities, would have been . seriously
handicapped were it not for the conveni
ent student-owned automobile.
As for the automobile taking students
from their work, which seems to be a
favored argument, it seems to me that the
philosophy applied by President Wilbur
to the. athletics question might apply al
most equally well to the automobile. If
a student demonstrates his ability to op
erate an automobile and at the same time
achieve academic success, he is entitled
to his machine. If he hasn't sufficient
stamina to do both, then there is doubt as
to his possessing that combination of
qualities we like to think of as character
izing a Stanford man, and it may be seri
ously questioned if we want him, anyway.
Very truly yours,
CARL D. DUNCAN.
