## California 45, Washington 7 
### 
The California varsity proved too
much for the University of Washington
eleven, winning 45 to 7. The Bears' first
score came from a series of delayed
criss-cross plays. Washington made its
only score in the first period through
Ziel's punting and a series of forward
passes from Ziel to Hall and Petrie,
ends. After the second quarter the
Huskies were 011 the defense nearly
all the time. The Bruin line outcharged
the Northerners, while the trick plays
executed by Andy Smith's squad daz
zled the Huskies and enabled the win
ners to gain yardage at will.
