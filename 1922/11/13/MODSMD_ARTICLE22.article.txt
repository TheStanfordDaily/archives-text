### 
Inability to kick the goal after touch
down cost the Pennsylvania eleven a
tie in the anilual game with Pittsburgh
and allowed Glenn Warner's Panthers
to win, 7-6. Pittsburgh made its score
in the first period, while Penn was not
able to pierce the Panther's second
ary defense until the fourth period.
Warner's squad made more first downs
and gained more ground, but Pennsyl
vania held numerous times when the
Panthers got within scoring distance.
In the seven years that the two teams
have been playing against each other
the Panthers have not been defeated.
