### 
After being outplayed in the first
quarter the Oregon eleven came back
strong in the second period and from
then 011 had the Washington State
team on the defense, winning 13 to 0.
The loser's line could not hold. Oregon

scored in the second and fourth
periods, through line plunges and ex
changes of punts.
In the last three minutes of play
the Cougars started an aerial attack
which looked threatening, but inter
cepted passes robbed the attack of its
effectiveness.
