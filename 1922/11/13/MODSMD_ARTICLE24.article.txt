Fumbles by Harvard backs at crit
ical moments of the game allowed the
Princeton eleven to score a 10-to-3
victory over the Crimson. It was the
first victory Princeton has won from
Harvard while playing at Harvard in
twenty-six years. Harvard imrde its
three points when George Owen sent
the ball through the goal posts.
Both teams showed wonderful de

fensive and offensive power but the
breaks of the game went in favor of
Princeton and upset the dope bucket.
