## 
### (By United Press 
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Nov. 13. â€”
Clara Phillips went into court today
confident of her acquittal.
Today Defense Attorney Bertram
Herrington, her gigantic attorney, will
pour forth a heavy stream of old
fashioned oratory in her behalf.
Tomorrow Deputy District Attorney
Fricke will make the last demand for
the death sentence, and it was be
lieved probable that the case would
be in the hands of the three women
and nine men on the jury tomorrow
night.
The jury can return a verdict of first
degree murder with recommendation
for life sentence or death, of second
degree or of manslaughter, if it votes
guilty. Many observers today professed
to see signs of a disagreement.
