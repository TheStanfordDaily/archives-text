# Food Research Director Talks at Mills College
## 
### 
"The food industry is the one funda
mental industry which cannot be reduced
below a certain minimum. It should
therefore be controlled by the govern
ment in the interest of those who con
sume food." said Dr. Carl L. Alsberg,
one of the directors in the Stanford Food
Research Institute, in an address given
at a Mills College assembly last week on
the subject of Federal Food Control.
Dr. Alsberg stated that manufacturers
attempted little intentional poisoning for
the reason that poison usually costs more
than food. "The chief adulterant is
water and it is the hardest to detect, since
most substances contain it."
