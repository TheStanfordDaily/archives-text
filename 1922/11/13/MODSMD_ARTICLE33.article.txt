# COMMITTEE ON POINT SYSTEM STARTS WORK
## 
### 
The card index and point system com
mittee appointed by the Executive Com
mittee will begin work this week on the
compilation of information. to guide the
student body in considering these sys
tems for governing student activities
Members of the committee are: Andrew
R. Boone, '23, chairman; Stoddard At
wood, '22; Doris Stevenson, '22, and Cal
vin Conron, '25.
The point system provides that no stu
dent shall in any one quarter be entered
in more than a given number of outside
activities, probably two. Each activity
will be given a certain number of points.
This is in order that each participant in
actvities shall have time left to study and
not be burdened wth too many conflicting
interests.
By card indexing student leaders are
given an accurate record of each student
both before and after entering college.
People needed to serve on committees can
be located through the card index and
executives of the student body will not
have to depend upon their intimate circle
of friends for assistants.
The card index system is included in
the point system, while the index system
may be used alone. Both have been
proved very satisfactory in the colleges
and universities where they have been
used.
