# Latin Books in Original Are Received at Library
## 
### 
A large number of old Latin books in
the original editions have been bought
by the Latin department from dealers all
over the country and are now being re
ceived and catalogued at the Library.
One of the oldest of these books is a
treatise on Latin style by Lorenzo Valla,
published in 1526. It is in the original
vellum binding with bits of parchment,
probably of hand-written prayer books,
used in binding it together. It originally
had ties to hold it.
There is a Natural History by Pliny,
published in 1540, by Aldus, one of the
rpost famous of old printers. Another
Aldine edition is the orations of Cicero,
1546, in morocco.
An edition of the complete works of
Horace, 1733, in two volumes, is the most
handsome of the books that have come in.
It is engraved throughout with copper
plate engravings instead of being printed,
and is bound in full calfskin. One vol
ume contains a list of subscribers to the
publication and includes scholars at Paris,
Cambridge, and Leipzig.
One of the later books is a Becker
edition of Livy, 1879, autographed by
John Addington Simons.
