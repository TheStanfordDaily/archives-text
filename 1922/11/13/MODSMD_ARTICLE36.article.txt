Smith, foreman of the press room, and
W. C. Bignold, head of the composing
room, attending to the printing.

yon will help on the action and all liv
ing group photos.

seniors can be snapped for the 1924

confusion the last few days and incon
venience through the need of special ap
pointments for sittings, as many seniors
