# FRESHMEN, FIGHTING AGAINST ODDS, LOSE TO BEAR CUBS 54-0
## California Line Breaks Through and Blocks Babe Offensive 
### PHIL NEWILL 
You can't win a football game on fight alone.
The Cardinal freshmen found that out over at Berkeley last Saturday. They
fought, tooth and nail for four quarters, but they were sunk under a 54-0 score.
That California Cub line, touted as the weak cog in Toomey's machine, went
through the Stanford ranks like water through a sieve, blocking Cook, Solomon,
and the other Card backs before they could get fairly started. That was the
main reason for those eight touchdowns.
Then there was the wet field. With the line unable to stand the Cubs"
pounding, Mitchell had to call open plays, and open play on a slippery field
is worse than useless.
For the Bears, the mud was not so bad. All last week they had been
practicing running flat-footed to avoid sliding, and for that reason "Tut"
Imlay, Jimmy Dixon, Bill Blewett, and the rest of that stellar array of

Berkeley backs were able to sprint
while the Cards skidded.

Finally, there was the strain of two
hard games in two week-ends. The
Dinks played a glorious game against
U. S. C. the week before, and in so
doing used up a lot of steam they
sorely needed against California.
Cubs Had Better Balanced Team
Having established the alibis more
or less firmly, we will proceed to knock
them flat. These California freshmen,
under any conditions whatsoever,
would have beaten Stanford by three
touchdowns. v They had a stronger, bet
ter balanced team, a line far superior
to the Cards, and a star of the "won
der" brand in Jimmy Dixon.
For most of the contest the ball was
in Cardinal territory, with the Babes
battling fiercely to stop the rushes of
Bear backs. Stanford made only four
first downs.
Bill Cook Does Stellar Work
Two of them were by Bill Cook, the
diminutive Dink halfback who was
easily the hardest scrapper on Hunt's
scrapping eleven.
A lucky fumble on Stanford's five
yard line at the beginning of the game
staved off the impending calamity for
a little while, after the Cubs had
shown their strength in a first rush
down the field. They came back,
though, with an 18-yard smash by Bill
Blewett, and another by Dixon. Dixon
broke over for the first score, Blewett
kicked, and that ended scoring for the
first quarter. •
"Big Smoke" Francis, an Ethiopian
whirlwind who did most, of the dam
age to the Red line, opened up a gap
ing hole through right tackle through
which Dixon ran twenty-three yards
to another score. He failed the kick.
Imlay Lightning on End Runs
Imlay, going in for Blewett in the
middle of the second period, carried
the ball out of danger the one time it
was in California territory. Francis in
tercepted one of Solomon's passes, and
on the next play Imlay—running flat
footed —went fifty-one yards around
left end and wa3 dropped with the ball
on Stanford's twenty-seven-yard meas
ure. Clayes ran him down and nailed
him in one of the prettiest tackles of
the game. From there Imlay carried it
over on a fifteen-yard pass, and kicked
for his point.
Not content with that, he broke away
again just before the half ended and
ran thirty yards to the seven-yard
mark. Brown carried it over and Im
lay kicked. Score at end of half, Cali
fornia 27, Stanford 0.
