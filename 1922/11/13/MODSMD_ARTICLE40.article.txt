# STANFORD MERMEN WILL COMPETE FOR WATER POLO TITLE
## 
### 
With the junior national water polo
championship slated Wednesday, Coach
Brandsten has his varsity squad working
with the "ghost ball" and under search
lights.
The Cardinal seven last year was de
feated in the finals by the Olympic Club.
With five of last year's squad as a
nucleus, Coach Ernie Brandsten has com
bined a team that may romp away with
the title if they continue to perform as
they have been doing in daily practice.
The team which more than likely will
represent Stanford is composed of the
following: Forwards, Fletcher, Robert
Meyers, Captain Miller; backs, Lacey,
McCallister, Austin ; goalkeeper, Collett;
substitutes, Schmieder, Belcher, Hooper,
Logan, Graham.
'ihe schedule for the championship
matches issued by Manager Loren Bush
is as follows:
Wednesday, November 15, at Olympic
Club, San Francisco, at 8 o'clock. Olympic
Club versus Stanford; California versus
Pacific City.
Thursday, November 16, at Olympic
Club, at 8 o'clock.
1. Winner of Olympic. Club-Stanford
versus winner of California-Pacific City.
2. Loser of Olympic Club-Stanford
versus loser of California-Pacific City.
Friday, November 17, at Olympic Club,
at 8 o'clock.
3. Winner of No. 2 match versus
Lowell High School.
Saturday, November 18, at Stanford
University, at 1:30, the winner of match
No. 3 versus winner of match No. 1.
A challenge has been received from the
California freshman water polo team for
a game with the Stanford Babes on the
morning of the Stanford-California foot
ball game. Coach Brandsten accepted the
challenge.
This contest will have nothing what
ever to do with the annual game between
the two teams, which is always held in
the spring quarter, but to arouse interest
in the fall practice.
The Cardinal Babes have been prac
ticing together three times a week since
the opening of college. Brandsten has
found a number of fast players in the
squad, but has had to progress slowly
with the tricks of the game because only
two or three of the squad have had any
previous experience. He expressed him
self yesterday as being well pleased with
the manner in which the first-year men
are grasping the tricks of the game. For
forwards he will possibly use Mack, Har
ris, Lewis. In the backfield positions,
Morrison, Langley, and Schumacher look
to have a firm hold on their jobs. Flag
ler appears to be the best man for the
goalkeeper's duties. Canfield, Kay, and
several new men who have just reported
for practice may at any time replace the
men now holding down the positions.
