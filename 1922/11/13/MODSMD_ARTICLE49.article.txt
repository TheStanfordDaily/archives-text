# Stanford Students Are Offered a Reduction To Galsworthy Play
## 
### 
John Galsworthy's powerful drama,
"The Skin Game," is now playing an
engagement of two weeks at the Col
umbia Theatre in San Francisco.
Stanford students and teachers can
receive a 50< per cent reduction on all
$1.50 and $2 seats by applying for spe
cial rate coupons at the Bookstore or
Director Bentinck's office in the Green
Room of the Economics building.
Originally produced under the direc
tion of Basil Dean at St. Martin's
Theatre, London, "The Skin Game"
has been one of the greatest successes
seen on the London stage in many
seasons. Its success was duplicated in
New York last year. The cast which
is making the present tour was direct
ed by Basil Dean and approved by
Galsworthy himself, who attended all
the rehearsals.
"The Skin Game" has been ac
claimed as Galsworthy's greatest play.
It is the story of a feud between the
Hillcrists and the Hornblowers, and
while its author has placed the play
in an English setting, its application
is accepted as universal.
