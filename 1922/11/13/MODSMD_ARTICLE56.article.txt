NEW YORK, Nov. 13.â€”After another
turbulent week, in which form went
astray, Princeton and Cornell sit astride
the football heap in the East.
The Tigers seem to be the champions
for a week at least. They have won
seven games and lost none and their vic
tories were more glorious than those of
Cornell, who has won six games over
less illustrious opponents.
West Virginia, figured generally as an
Eastern team, has also won six games
without being defeated. In the unde
feated class also are W. and J. and the
fine Army eleven, but W. and J. has one
tie game with Carnegie Tech and the
Army has engaged -in two no-decision
contests with Yale and Notre Dame.
Princeton has one more game between
a first-class claim on the Eastern chatrf
pionship and the culmination of one of
the best seasons the Tigers have had in
years. That one game is with Yale next
Saturday, and the El is have developed to
a point where they are meat for no one.
California, which overwhelmed Wash
ington, 57 to 7, leads the country in scor
ing. with 321 points. Cornell, with 282
the East; Centre leads in the South, with

254, and lowa leads in the Western Con
ference, with 159.
Michigan still remains as the only
major team in the country that has not
been scored on, and Notre Dame is next,
with only ten points allowed the opposi
tion.
