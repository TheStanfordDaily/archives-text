# GRAYS LOSE TO BLUE AND GOLD GOOFS 18-0
## 
### DON LIEBENDORFER, â€™24 
Coach Cranmer's California Goof
eleven handed the Stanford Grays an 18-0
defeat at Berkeley Saturday after the
two teams had slipped and slid from one
end of California field to the other for
sixty minutes.
It was a case of two good defensive
teams with little to choose between them.
The Berkeley Goofs got the breaks, the
first of" which came early in the first
period. Fuller, quarterback for the
Grays, ran the kick-off hack to his own
35-yard line. The Grays lost five yards
for being off side. Erhorn carried the i
ball fifteen yards around right end on a
criss-cross line.
Fumble Brings First Score
Here the Goofs held and the Grays j
could not gain through the line. On the j
third down, Hamilton fumbled and the'
Goofs recovered. With perfect inter- j
ference, the California fullback ran forty- j
five yards around right end 011 a fake
punt formation and the score stood 6-0. I
The try for point failed.
The Goofs kicked off and Bugbee ran '
the ball back to their 15-yard line before 1
he was downed. The Grays could make !
I
110 headway through the line, however, j
and lost the ball and incidentally their
only chance to score. For the rest of the j
first quarter, the ball exchanged hands
in the middle of the field.
At the beginning of the second quarter
the Grays seemed unable to hold, and a!
23-yard end run followed by a 20-yard j
off-tackle buck netted the California
Goofs their second touchdown. The try
for extra point again failed.
Last Score in Third Period
At the end of the third quarter the j
'Goofs started another drive and got the !
ball to the Grays' 8-yard line as the quar
ter ended. On the fourth place in the
final period the Goofs put the ball over i
for the last score of the game.
Crawford at guard, Erhorn at half,
and Widaman at end, played good defen-'
sive ball for" the Grays, and Bugbee and
Erhorn made practically all their yard
age. Bill Black was called back from
end to do the punting and his hefty boot i
sent the ball 35 and 40 yards out of the j
Grays' territory several times.
The Grays lined up as follows : Center, !
Williams; guards, Hays and Rogers;
tackles, McCoombs and Long; ends, ;
Widaman and Robinson; quarterback,;
Fuller; halfbacks, Erhorn and Hamilton;]
fullback, Bugbee.
Substitutions: Black for Robinson,
Grondona for Hamilton, Dunbar for Wil
liams, Blacker for Fuller, Cary for Gron
dona, Crawford for Rogers, Woodhead

for being off side. Erhorn carried the i
ball fifteen yards around right end on a
criss-cross line.
Fumble Brings First Score
Here the Goofs held and the Grays j
could not gain through the line. On the j
third down, Hamilton fumbled and the'
Goofs recovered. With perfect inter- j
ference, the California fullback ran forty- j
five yards around right end 011 a fake
punt formation and the score stood 6-0. I
The try for point failed.
The Goofs kicked off and Bugbee ran '
the ball back to their 15-yard line before 1
he was downed. The Grays could make !
I
110 headway through the line, however, j
and lost the ball and incidentally their
only chance to score. For the rest of the j
first quarter, the ball exchanged hands
in the middle of the field.
At the beginning of the second quarter
the Grays seemed unable to hold, and a!
23-yard end run followed by a 20-yard j
off-tackle buck netted the California
Goofs their second touchdown. The try
for extra point again failed.
Last Score in Third Period
At the end of the third quarter the j
'Goofs started another drive and got the !
ball to the Grays' 8-yard line as the quar
ter ended. On the fourth place in the
final period the Goofs put the ball over i
for the last score of the game.
Crawford at guard, Erhorn at half,
and Widaman at end, played good defen-'
sive ball for" the Grays, and Bugbee and
Erhorn made practically all their yard
age. Bill Black was called back from
end to do the punting and his hefty boot i
sent the ball 35 and 40 yards out of the j
Grays' territory several times.

Coach Cranmer's California Goof
eleven handed the Stanford Grays an 18-0

teams with little to choose between them.

first of" which came early in the first
period. Fuller, quarterback for the
Grays, ran the kick-off hack to his own
35-yard line. The Grays lost five yards
