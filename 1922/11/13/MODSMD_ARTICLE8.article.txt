# IMPERSONATOR WILL READ FROM DICKENS TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
Frank C. Thompson, impersonator,
spoken of as "the man of many voices,"
will give a series of readings from the
works of Charles Dickens tomorrow eve
ning in the Little Theatre. Mr. Thomp
son is said to be a reader of remarkable
ability. He presents characters in a man
ner sympathetic with the intent of the
author, and shows skillful management
of his marvelous voice. Such is the com
ment which comes from audiences which
have heard him recently.
The Santa Rosa Republican, in speak
ing of a program which Mr. Thompson
gave in that city, says, "Mr. Thompson
has the rare gift of delivering his se
lections in such a manner that the char
acters he portrays take on the brain
image of persons known to the audience,
persons one meets intimately in daily life."
The program tomorrow evening will
begin promptly at 7:30.
