# Pictorial Gives Call For December Contributions
## 
### 
"Early copy!" cries Harry Borba,
editor of the Stanford Pictorial, which
means that all contributions for the
December issue must be in his hands
by November 15.
It is generally conceded among cam
pus readers that the last issue of
"Pic" was a great improvement over
former ones, not only in the number
and variety of articles from campus
scribes but also because of the en
larged pictorial supplement. Borba
wants to keep this record up. He
makes a special plea to every man
and woman at Stanford who can shake
any kind of a pen, to do the same, and
try themselves out with a contribution.
Address to Box 618, Campus; and re
member that November 15 is the last
day!
