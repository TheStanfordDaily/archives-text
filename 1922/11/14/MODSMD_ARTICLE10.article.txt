## 
### 
Victorious in their respective clashes
last Saturday, Glenn Pollard's seniors
and Harold Lundburg's sophomores will
meet at 10 o'clock Saturday morning in
the final round of play for the inter-class
football championship of the University, j
At 9 o'clock the frosh, defeated by the j
sophs, are scheduled to take on the
juniors, who bowed to the '23 class in
a hard fought game last Saturday morn
ing.
The silver football, donated by mem
bers of the Board of Athletic Control to
the winning team, will be awarded the
champions after the game, it was an
nounced today by Dr. W. H. Barrow,
one of the donors of the trophy. The
trophy is perpetual, and will not become
the permanent possession of Saturday's
victor.
Becausc of their greater weight, the
seniors are favored to win. Weight told
in both contests last week, and the
seniors have it on their opponents by
several pounds. The sophs, however, dis
played such grit and determination in their
gruelling struggle with the frosh that
many look for them to upset the dope
as completely as they did in their first
game. They expcct to win, but realize

> that the odds are against them. This
] makes them all the more determined.
In commenting on the success of the
inter-class football, which has been re
vived this year for the first time since
j the return to American football at Stan-
J ford, Dr. Barrow said:
"I was amazed and delighted at Un
surprising manner in which the boys took
to the game. They outdid all expecta
tions. They had but a little more than a
week in which to train, yet they put on
the field teams tliat would do credit to
any school. They knew football and
they did not get their signals juggled.
But the best part of it all was the way
in which they fought for every inch.
There was no laying down out there.
This proved that they were real men,
and they played hard to win for their
respective ciasscs.
"Next year we will have inter-class
foothall on a bigger scale. The season
will be longer and we will schedule games
' with sonic of the class teams of nearby
: colleges, and with high schools. It will
give every man in school something to
jdo if he wants to come out. A light man
will have a chance here as well as the
big men. Go to it Saturday and let's keep
I up the good work.

Victorious in their respective clashes
last Saturday, Glenn Pollard's seniors
and Harold Lundburg's sophomores will
meet at 10 o'clock Saturday morning in
the final round of play for the inter-class
football championship of the University, j
At 9 o'clock the frosh, defeated by the j
sophs, are scheduled to take on the
juniors, who bowed to the '23 class in
a hard fought game last Saturday morn
ing.
The silver football, donated by mem
bers of the Board of Athletic Control to
the winning team, will be awarded the
champions after the game, it was an
nounced today by Dr. W. H. Barrow,
one of the donors of the trophy. The
trophy is perpetual, and will not become
the permanent possession of Saturday's
victor.
Becausc of their greater weight, the
seniors are favored to win. Weight told
in both contests last week, and the
seniors have it on their opponents by
several pounds. The sophs, however, dis
played such grit and determination in their
gruelling struggle with the frosh that
many look for them to upset the dope
as completely as they did in their first
game. They expcct to win, but realize

> that the odds are against them. This
] makes them all the more determined.
In commenting on the success of the
inter-class football, which has been re
vived this year for the first time since
j the return to American football at Stan-
J ford, Dr. Barrow said:
"I was amazed and delighted at Un
surprising manner in which the boys took
to the game. They outdid all expecta
tions. They had but a little more than a
week in which to train, yet they put on
the field teams tliat would do credit to
any school. They knew football and
they did not get their signals juggled.
But the best part of it all was the way
in which they fought for every inch.
There was no laying down out there.
This proved that they were real men,
and they played hard to win for their
respective ciasscs.
"Next year we will have inter-class
foothall on a bigger scale. The season
will be longer and we will schedule games
' with sonic of the class teams of nearby
: colleges, and with high schools. It will
give every man in school something to
jdo if he wants to come out. A light man
will have a chance here as well as the
