# Theatre Workshop Will Produce Trio Of One Act Plays
## 
### 
I lie Theater Workshop class, under
the direction of Mr. Bentinck, will pro
duce three one-act plays on Friday, De
cember 15. Two scenes from Shake
speare's "Henry IV," with Falstaff as
the principal character, will be one of
the offerings. The other two are "The
Queen's Enemies," by Lord Dunsany, and
"Mannikin and Minnikin," a short, two
character comedy sketch, which Director
Bentinck has produced before in the
East and in Carmel this summer.
Mr. Bentinck s idea in selecting these
particular plays is to give the campus
something different in the dramatic line,
and yet something which will be very
pleasing to a student audience. The casts
will be selected this week and rehearsals
will begin immediately. Staging, light
ing, costuming and producing will all be
done by the members of the class under
Mr. Bentinck's direction.
