# FROTHIES CHORUS PRACTICING FOR DANCE ALLEGORY
## Sad Tale "The Birth of the Milkweed" Said to Bring Tears to Stony Beholder 
### 
Allegorical to the last degree, a dance
representing in all fullness "The Birth of
the Milkweed" is now being coached to
completion for the Football Frothies to
be staged the night of the Big Game.
"The Milkweed" is but one of many
novel chorus effects that are being ob
tained under the direction of "Hock"
Chalmers and Sam Mendenhall in the
constant practice being held to whip the
Frothies into perfect shape within the
next two weeks.
The sad tale of "The Milkweed" lias
a story which might well soften the
heart of the stoniest of stony onlookers.
The poor milk fairies, unlike Kansas,
with its sunflower and Hawaii with its
shredded wheat biscuit bloom, have no
national flower. To soften the bitter
blow, they appeal to Carnation, high
priestess of milk. The part of Carna
tion is taken by Paul Claflin, who, aided
by both the pony and beauty choruses,
works out a pageant effect that is calcu
lated to make the producers of "When
Knighthood Was in Flower" look to
their laurels. Classical music as ren
dered by "Chick" Midgely sustains the
ceremonious note throughout.
Lacking such farcial elements, on the
other hand, is the song and dance num
ber, "Javanese Twilight," featuring Helen
Whitney in steps but recently imported
from the South Seas. This number will
furnish a spectacular and gorgeous ef
fect to the show through its lavish use
of specially designed costumes furnished
by the De Raca Corporation of San
Francisco, and by its pretentious stage
settings, which are being constructed un
der the direction of Chrysella Dunker.
The scenery represents the interior of
a Javanese temple, as the evening "wat
chang" is in progrss. The high priestess
invokes the spirit of the occasion to come
forth, and it is here that Helen Whit
ney enters to give her interpretation of
the South Pacific ritual.
Nothing spared—all secrets bared—is
the motto promised in regard to the finale
of the first act, which will, those re
sponsible affirm, show the true likeness
of the interior of a fraternity house. It
is in this scene that what promises to be
the song hit of the show, "I Want to
Major in Love," will make its debut.
