# Entry Lists For Cross-Country Race To Be Run Saturday Are Still Open
## 
### 
Entry lists for the intramural cross
country race, to be run off Saturday
in the stadium before the Washington
game, will be kept open until Wednes
day night since several runners now
practicing are undecided whether they
will be in condition to compete by
Saturday.
Several last-minute entries were
handed in last night, bringing the to
tal number up to nineteen. Any other
men desiring to enter the race can
do so until the lists are closed finally.
So far the plaque to be awarded to
the winning team will go to Sequoia
since all other contestants have en
tered as unattached competitors. The
first three men finishing for any one
team will be awarded the plaque for
their living group.
