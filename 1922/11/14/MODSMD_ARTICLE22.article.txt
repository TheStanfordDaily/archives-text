# REDUCING THE RISK
## 
### 
Since Fire Marshal Ed Lamb came on to the
campus a great change has taken place in the method
of handling rubbish, refuse, and old odds and ends
that accumulate to make fire risks all the greater.
And the best part of the whole thing, according to
Lamb, is the fact that it did not take a great deal of
persuasion to get campus people to clean things up.
Stanford homes and buildings are all the better off
for the elimination of the waste and Stanford as a
whole has a safer future. If progress were only
made along other lines as fast as in fire prevention
the campus would be far in advance of the times.
