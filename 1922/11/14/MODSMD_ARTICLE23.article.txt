# BIG LITTLE ROOTERS
## 
### 
It is reported that Stanford had one of the livest
rooting sections extant over at Berkeley last Satur
day despite the fact that its numbers were few.
People are more likely to notice a big noise from a
little crowd than a bigger noise from a big crowd.
Any time a rooting section can make such a showing
as that one did over at Berkeley last Saturday, and
in the face of defeat, it is representative of the Stan
ford spirit that has been declared practically dead.
And since that crowd comprised largely freshmen, it
may be concluded that our varsity rooting section
has some good material for next year.
