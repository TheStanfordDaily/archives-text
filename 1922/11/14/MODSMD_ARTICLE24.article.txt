# THE
						TROJAN SPIRIT
## 
### 
Several hundred rooters from the University of
Southern California who came north with their team
last week were cordially received on the campus and
went away afteV the game leaving behind them the
highest regard for the southern university in the
minds of Stanford people. The utmost courtesy
marked the conduct of the Trojans' team and rooters
during their short stay 011 the campus, and both
universities are all the better for it.
Stanford, California, and the University of South
ern California are bound together by a common tie,
and as representative colleges of the state should
endeavor always to remain 011 the friendliest of
terms.
Stanford is glad to have had an opportunity to
welcome the southerners to the campus, resting as
sured that her teams and rooters will be accorded
the same reception in a return game next year.
