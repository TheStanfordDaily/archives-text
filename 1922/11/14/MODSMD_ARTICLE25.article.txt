# AMONG THE BRIGHT SPOTS
## 
### 
Even when in the midst of a cycle of athletic
defeats, such as every university must meet oc
casionally in its history, Stanford has been able to
point with pride to consistent victory over all com
petitors in minor sports. The Stanford soccer teams
have been winning - for years. Swimming 1 and water
polo victories are beginning to be taken for granted.
Boxing and wrestling squads, not to mention fencing,
gymnastic, and handball teams, have been holding
their own all through the darker days of the losing
cycle.
And it is not because Stanford has had the best
of the material all the time. For other reasons apply
to Ilarrv Maloney and Ernie Brandsten.
