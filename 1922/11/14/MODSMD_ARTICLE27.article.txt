# CABBAGES AND THINGS H.M.21

### 
Having finally accumulated a new cut for the top of
the column, Cabbages stepfi out and "points with pride",
and then calls the attention of the reader to several
features of it. Notice, first, that the figures at the right
are being struck by nothing more serious than Cabbage;
we don't throw bricks, intentionally. Second, imagine
that the guys whose arms are sticking out of the office
are laughing, not at you, but with you; and there you
have it. Simple, isn't it?

Cabbages also thanx McD. for the drawing.

Portable, Ark., claims the distinction of having a home
wrecked there by a bomb, instead of a boarder, as is the
usual case. This claim has not yet been investigated by
the League of American Commonwealths and so cannot
be substantiated.

Dingville, Ga. —Sol Lather had some of these college
fellelis out to his place the other day. They were alius
talking about rooters and so on back at college, but Sol
told them we have some of the best rooters here they
ever was. Sol took them out to the pig pen and showed
'em the pigs, and said, "There is it!" But the college
boys haven't much sense of humor, 'cause they threw
Sol in and told him to root for his team with the rest of
his family.

Him: Do you think an ear phone would improve my
hearing?
Shim: Might, if you could ever get Central.

Obvious Joke Column
Joke Number One:
Why are girls who go to Long Beach foolish?
Answer: Because they're beach-nuts (beech-nuts).
Explanation: The cleverness here depends largely
upon the play on the words. The point of the joke is
hidden in the parenthesis, and may be deduced with a
little care. Perhaps those who have been to the annex
of our southern Metropolis will have another explanation
for the above question, but we absolutely refuse to pub
lish any contributions of this nature. Besides, we've
been to Long Beach, too.

Joke Number Two:
Q. What course do you expect to graduate in?
A. In the course of time!
Explanation: This course is not given at any of the
universities, but we have heard of some judges giving
Time in the state institutions. However, the true mean
ing of the expression is merely an Idiomatic expression
used by the hoi-poiloi. (Laughter).

Q. Prof. Walton: How did nitrates (night-rates) orig
inate.
A. Sleepy Stude: In a hotel!
Explanation: The point depends upon the misinter
pretation of the original intention of the prof, to have a
serious discussion of the nitrate. However, the student
must have done his laboratory work in hotels, as they
are still uppermost in his mind.
Dear Editor: How can I win the love of the men at
Stanford?
Dear Co-ed: Move to South America by next boat!

Notice: "Will the person who took my Ford cut-down
from the Library Friday night return the notebook in
back seat, and no questions asked
* * *
"Johnson Sweeps Country": Which is merely proof
that maybe the Encina janitors might be able to sweep
a few rooms better than they do.
