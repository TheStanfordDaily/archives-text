EDITOR'S NOTE—Compared to a
number of viezvpoints received today by
the Daily, the folloivitig is rather lauda
tory. However, since it was this same
writer's viewpoint that the editor com
mented upon yesterday, it is no more than
fair that the follozving "rebuttal" be
printed. If the ideals of the Daily's cor
respondent in this case were really facts,
there would be no need for the abolition
of student-ozvned cars. It is the im
pression of the editor, who does not ozvn
a car, but has been one of "the irrcspon
sibles who was ill-advised" and who has
made the rounds with campus journalists,
that Mr. Duncan has justified HIS use
of a car on the campus, but is not
cognizant of the fact that the majority
of the remainder are without such prin
ciples. The way in which he uses his
ozvn car blinds the writer of the view
point to all that might happen to other
car owners and their friends.
To the Editor:
It is with fear and trembling that the
following contribution is offered in re
buttal to the editorial in yesterday's
Daily. Moreover, the writer entertains
no wish to engage in a battle of wits
over the subject of automobiles, for after
the evidence afforded by the editorial in
question he feels as if he would, with
out doubt, be overwhelmed by the bar
rage of literary brilliance which would
rain down about his head as a result of
such an encounter. For, verily, the editor
doth sling a wicked pen!
However, it may be well to correct
an impression and call attention to what
seems to be a confusion of ideas.
The writer is not an advocate of the
laissez-faire policy and does not wish
to be considered as such. He feels in
some degree cognizant of the fallacies
involved in laissez-faire — and does not
believe that his suggestions can be placed
under that head.
We live under what is termed a demo
cratic government. To the best of the
writer's knowledge, it is not the aim of
a democracy to level its people, still less
is it to force them to be good. Rather
is it to provide opportunity for maximum
individual development within the limits
set by social necessity. Hence the editor's
reference to the Volstead act, etc., seems
a little beside the point. This act was
passed, not to save a certain "irrespon
sible" portion of the population, "who
don't know what is good for them" from
damnation, but to prevent them from do
ing an incalculable amount of injury to
the other and larger portion.
If the automobile situation at Stanford
really parallels the liquor situation, then
without doubt similarly drastic action
ought to be taken. The writer, however,
seriously doubts the existence of any
such parallelism. He feels that those who
advocate the ban on automobiles are in
grave danger of identifying social neces
sity with their own ideals and thus losing
sight of the true function of free gov
ernment.
He hardly admits that the Stanford
Student Body arc "irresponsible" or that
they to any alarming extent "do not
know what is good for them."
Very truly yours,
CARL D. DUNCAN.
