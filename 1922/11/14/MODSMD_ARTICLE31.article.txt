San Francisco sport scribes are
more and more joining in worship at
the altar of Andrew Smith and his
Golden Bears. Apparently there is
nothing in the Pacific Coast football
field except California —and nothing
more is anticipated for several years
to come. Stanford, together with the
other unfortunates who do not boast
"wonder teams," occupies a rather dis
tant place in the background, accord
ing to some writers' scheme of things.
Two weeks before the Big Game,
Stanford isn't even being accorded a
fighting chance, and that is why some
of the professional prophets are go
ing to be sadder but wiser the Sunday
morning after the gridiron classic. The
1922 Stanford varsity, at its full
strength, is a good football team—
good enough to give even California a
tussle. Wilcox has recovered from the
effects of his collision Saturday, and
now there seems a possibility that Ray
Doughty will be in there on November
25. There have been many Stanford
teams that have gritted their teeth and
beaten better teams, and there is no
reason why something of the same
sort shouldn't happen this year.
Ere the U. S. C. struggle is gone
and forgotten, there should be a few
words of praise for Henderson's ends,
Pythian and Milton. They knew a
tiling or two about getting down under
punts, and it was the exception when
Woodward, who was playing safety,
had any chance to make a return.
Bob Janssen is another one who
must be reckoned when counting
Stanford's chances next Saturday. He
played for two quarters against the
Southerners, and now that his ankle
is strong again will probably alternate
with "Shorty Mertz." Then Fred Lu
deke, whom some Oregon Aggie
bumped in the shoulder, is getting
tired of warming the bench. So is Joe
Douglass, who weighs over 200 pounds
and is remarkably fast for his weight.
Douglass was one of Van Gent's regu
lar guards last year, and tackled "Crip"
Toomey so hard in the Big Game that
the Bruin back fumbled on his own
five-yard line.
The U. S. C. game had hardly started
when Wilcox passed twenty yards to
Woodward, but it v;as declared illegal
because the ball touched Johnston
first. Kerr had Wilcox using the on- j
side kick for a time, but Gordon Camp- j
beil always caught the punt before j
Cuddebac-k had a chance to get down !
there.
Ernie Nevers, who has played half
back on Hunt's eleven until the final,
lined up at right end in the cross
country entertainment over at Berk
eley Saturday. Ernie was able to hold
down his territory fairly well for a
man who has never played on the wing
before, but he had to be taken out in
the second half with his weak shoul
der again injured.
"Holy Smoke" Francis was the
whole Cubs' line, bucking through on
the defensive, opening holes, running
interference, and generally making a
nuisance of himself. The colored (
tackle weighs 192 pounds, and was
lined up against Potts of Stanford.
Once "Smoke" caught one of Solomon's
passes, on the only chance the Babes
had with the ball in enemy territory.
California field was churned into a
puddle by the time the game was
over. Starting cftjt with only a scanty
clothing of grass, and that torn up by
the Goof contest before the main
event, the gridiron looked like a mud
flat by the end of the first half. In
spite of this handicap that speed
burner, "Tut" Imlay, made some forty
yard runs that had Walt Christie eye
ing him speculatively.
"Buck" Faust, who was by far tne
best of Hunt's line-busters, got hit on
his bad leg in the second quarter, and
had to be taken from the game. A1
Clayes went in for him. and once or
twice during the avalanche of Cub
"scores managed to show ?ome of the

speed that won him a place on the
team.
After that first rush down the field
for a touchdown, Coach "Husky" Hunt,
standing on the sidelines, never
changed his expression. He evidently
saw the odds, and knowing Dixon,
Mell, Thatcher, and some of the other
Bear freshmen as he did, could guess
a little of what was coming.
Kill Blewett, the Bruin halfback who
is famous as a runner, weight-thrower,
basketball player, and a few other
things, only got into the game in the
first half. He has been out all season
with an injury to his leg, and evidently
the basketball coaches were taking no
chances of his being put out of the
running for the next sport on the cal
endar. While he was in Blewett went
even better than "Brick" Morse's dis
covery, Jimmy Dixon.
Last Saturday was not the first time
that "Tut" Imlay has scored on a
Stanford class team. Last year, after
he went to California for a few weeks
and then dropped out, he ran for two
touchdowns against the Babes under
Salinas high school colors.

Woodward, who was playing safety,
had any chance to make a return.
Bob Janssen is another one who
must be reckoned when counting
Stanford's chances next Saturday. He
played for two quarters against the
Southerners, and now that his ankle
is strong again will probably alternate
with "Shorty Mertz." Then Fred Lu
deke, whom some Oregon Aggie
bumped in the shoulder, is getting
tired of warming the bench. So is Joe
Douglass, who weighs over 200 pounds
and is remarkably fast for his weight.
Douglass was one of Van Gent's regu
lar guards last year, and tackled "Crip"
Toomey so hard in the Big Game that
the Bruin back fumbled on his own
five-yard line.
The U. S. C. game had hardly started
when Wilcox passed twenty yards to
Woodward, but it v;as declared illegal
because the ball touched Johnston
first. Kerr had Wilcox using the on- j
side kick for a time, but Gordon Camp- j
beil always caught the punt before j
Cuddebac-k had a chance to get down !
there.
Ernie Nevers, who has played half
back on Hunt's eleven until the final,
lined up at right end in the cross
country entertainment over at Berk
eley Saturday. Ernie was able to hold
down his territory fairly well for a
man who has never played on the wing
before, but he had to be taken out in
the second half with his weak shoul
der again injured.
"Holy Smoke" Francis was the
whole Cubs' line, bucking through on
the defensive, opening holes, running
interference, and generally making a
nuisance of himself. The colored (
tackle weighs 192 pounds, and was
lined up against Potts of Stanford.
Once "Smoke" caught one of Solomon's
passes, on the only chance the Babes
had with the ball in enemy territory.
California field was churned into a
puddle by the time the game was
over. Starting cftjt with only a scanty
clothing of grass, and that torn up by
the Goof contest before the main
event, the gridiron looked like a mud
flat by the end of the first half. In
spite of this handicap that speed
burner, "Tut" Imlay, made some forty
yard runs that had Walt Christie eye
ing him speculatively.
"Buck" Faust, who was by far tne
best of Hunt's line-busters, got hit on
his bad leg in the second quarter, and
had to be taken from the game. A1
Clayes went in for him. and once or
twice during the avalanche of Cub
"scores managed to show ?ome of the

speed that won him a place on the
team.
After that first rush down the field
for a touchdown, Coach "Husky" Hunt,
standing on the sidelines, never
changed his expression. He evidently
saw the odds, and knowing Dixon,
Mell, Thatcher, and some of the other
Bear freshmen as he did, could guess
a little of what was coming.
Kill Blewett, the Bruin halfback who
is famous as a runner, weight-thrower,
basketball player, and a few other
things, only got into the game in the
first half. He has been out all season
with an injury to his leg, and evidently
the basketball coaches were taking no
chances of his being put out of the
running for the next sport on the cal
endar. While he was in Blewett went
even better than "Brick" Morse's dis
covery, Jimmy Dixon.
Last Saturday was not the first time
that "Tut" Imlay has scored on a
Stanford class team. Last year, after
he went to California for a few weeks
and then dropped out, he ran for two
touchdowns against the Babes under
Salinas high school colors.
San Francisco sport scribes are
more and more joining in worship at
the altar of Andrew Smith and his
Golden Bears. Apparently there is
nothing in the Pacific Coast football
field except California —and nothing
more is anticipated for several years
to come. Stanford, together with the
other unfortunates who do not boast
"wonder teams," occupies a rather dis
tant place in the background, accord
ing to some writers' scheme of things.
Two weeks before the Big Game,
Stanford isn't even being accorded a
fighting chance, and that is why some
of the professional prophets are go
ing to be sadder but wiser the Sunday
morning after the gridiron classic. The
1922 Stanford varsity, at its full
strength, is a good football team—
good enough to give even California a
tussle. Wilcox has recovered from the
effects of his collision Saturday, and
now there seems a possibility that Ray
Doughty will be in there on November
25. There have been many Stanford
teams that have gritted their teeth and
beaten better teams, and there is no
reason why something of the same
sort shouldn't happen this year.
Ere the U. S. C. struggle is gone
and forgotten, there should be a few
words of praise for Henderson's ends,
Pythian and Milton. They knew a
tiling or two about getting down under
punts, and it was the exception when
Woodward, who was playing safety,
had any chance to make a return.

man who has never played on the wing
before, but he had to be taken out in
the second half with his weak shoul
der again injured.
"Holy Smoke" Francis was the
whole Cubs' line, bucking through on
the defensive, opening holes, running
interference, and generally making a
nuisance of himself. The colored (
tackle weighs 192 pounds, and was
lined up against Potts of Stanford.
Once "Smoke" caught one of Solomon's
passes, on the only chance the Babes
had with the ball in enemy territory.
California field was churned into a
puddle by the time the game was
over. Starting cftjt with only a scanty
clothing of grass, and that torn up by
the Goof contest before the main
event, the gridiron looked like a mud
flat by the end of the first half. In
spite of this handicap that speed
burner, "Tut" Imlay, made some forty
yard runs that had Walt Christie eye
ing him speculatively.
"Buck" Faust, who was by far tne
best of Hunt's line-busters, got hit on
his bad leg in the second quarter, and
had to be taken from the game. A1
Clayes went in for him. and once or
twice during the avalanche of Cub
"scores managed to show ?ome of the

speed that won him a place on the
team.
After that first rush down the field
for a touchdown, Coach "Husky" Hunt,
standing on the sidelines, never
changed his expression. He evidently
saw the odds, and knowing Dixon,
Mell, Thatcher, and some of the other
Bear freshmen as he did, could guess
a little of what was coming.
Kill Blewett, the Bruin halfback who
is famous as a runner, weight-thrower,
basketball player, and a few other
things, only got into the game in the
first half. He has been out all season
with an injury to his leg, and evidently
the basketball coaches were taking no
chances of his being put out of the
running for the next sport on the cal
endar. While he was in Blewett went
even better than "Brick" Morse's dis
covery, Jimmy Dixon.
Last Saturday was not the first time
that "Tut" Imlay has scored on a
Stanford class team. Last year, after
he went to California for a few weeks
and then dropped out, he ran for two
touchdowns against the Babes under
Salinas high school colors.
San Francisco sport scribes are
more and more joining in worship at
the altar of Andrew Smith and his
Golden Bears. Apparently there is
nothing in the Pacific Coast football
field except California —and nothing
more is anticipated for several years
to come. Stanford, together with the
other unfortunates who do not boast
"wonder teams," occupies a rather dis
tant place in the background, accord
ing to some writers' scheme of things.
Two weeks before the Big Game,
Stanford isn't even being accorded a
fighting chance, and that is why some
of the professional prophets are go
ing to be sadder but wiser the Sunday
morning after the gridiron classic. The
1922 Stanford varsity, at its full
strength, is a good football team—
good enough to give even California a
tussle. Wilcox has recovered from the
effects of his collision Saturday, and
now there seems a possibility that Ray
Doughty will be in there on November
25. There have been many Stanford
teams that have gritted their teeth and
beaten better teams, and there is no
reason why something of the same
sort shouldn't happen this year.
Ere the U. S. C. struggle is gone
and forgotten, there should be a few
words of praise for Henderson's ends,
Pythian and Milton. They knew a
tiling or two about getting down under
punts, and it was the exception when
Woodward, who was playing safety,
had any chance to make a return.
Bob Janssen is another one who
must be reckoned when counting
Stanford's chances next Saturday. He
played for two quarters against the
Southerners, and now that his ankle
is strong again will probably alternate
with "Shorty Mertz." Then Fred Lu
deke, whom some Oregon Aggie
bumped in the shoulder, is getting
tired of warming the bench. So is Joe
Douglass, who weighs over 200 pounds
and is remarkably fast for his weight.
Douglass was one of Van Gent's regu
lar guards last year, and tackled "Crip"
Toomey so hard in the Big Game that
the Bruin back fumbled on his own
five-yard line.
The U. S. C. game had hardly started
when Wilcox passed twenty yards to
Woodward, but it v;as declared illegal
because the ball touched Johnston
first. Kerr had Wilcox using the on- j
side kick for a time, but Gordon Camp- j
beil always caught the punt before j
Cuddebac-k had a chance to get down !
there.
Ernie Nevers, who has played half
back on Hunt's eleven until the final,
lined up at right end in the cross
country entertainment over at Berk
eley Saturday. Ernie was able to hold
down his territory fairly well for a
man who has never played on the wing
before, but he had to be taken out in
the second half with his weak shoul
