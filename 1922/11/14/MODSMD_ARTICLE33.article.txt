# Eliot Jones Discusses Railroad Wage Situation
## 
### 
The present railway labor situation
was outlined by Professor Eliot Jones
of the Economics department at the
forum meeting held last night in the
Unitarian hall in Palo Alto. A brief
history of the movement for the regu
lation of wages in the railroad industry
was given, with special reference to the
developments during the past two years
which resulted in the decision of the
board that it is not required by law to
order the payment of a living wage. Dis
cussion from the floor followed the ad
dress.
