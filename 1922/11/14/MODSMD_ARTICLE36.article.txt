# Names Replace Numbers In Union Dining Room
## 
### 
"Hev, Bill!" and "Oh, there, Mr. Mc-
Thumb!" will henceforth take the place
of "Waituh!" or "You, No. 71!" in the
dining room of the New Union, where
waiters are now tagged with their names
rather than their numbers.
Where before a shining nickel-plaited
emblem, strongly resembling the star a
sheriff wears, bore the waiter's numeral,
now a neat ribbon badge will proclaim
him by his proper cognomen of Mr.
Jones, or more often "Runt O'Gallien."
The change is due to requests coming
from faculty members and others who
frequent the dining room, who say they
would prefer "bawling out" or compli
menting their waiters, as the case may be,
by a name rather than a number.
