# BRUIN SOCCER TEAM IN TIE GAME WITH SONS OF ST. GEORGE
## 
### 
California's soccer varsity took an
other step downward in the University
'and Club League in the round of
games last Saturday when the Sons of
St. George succeeded in tieing the
Blue and Gold, 2-2. The Sons of St.
George has been beaten by every team
except California and is probably the
weakest team in the League.
Two San Francisco clubs, the Vik
ings and the Barbarians, are still tied
for second place in the league. The
Vikings defeated the Olympic Club, 2
to 0, and the Barbs played the Italia
Virtus for a 4-0 victory. These two
teams will have their little difficulty
out next Saturday when they meet in
the last game of the first half of the
league in the stadium in Golden Gate
Park. Comparative scores compiled by
both teams show them to be about
even.
