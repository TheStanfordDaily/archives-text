# MORE LOCAL CLUBS BEING FORMED AT WASHINGTON STATE
## 
### 
Several new local clubs are being
organized at the State College of
Washington in order to provide less
expensive living accommodations and
also to give the advantage of group
life. The present men's dormitories are
inadequate to take care of all of the
freshmen and sophomores and about
500 men are required to seek rooms in
town.
