## 
### (By United Press 
COQUIMBO, Chile, Nov. 14. â€”Fears
were felt here today for safety of the
steamer Renaico, bound from New
York to Anlofagasta and Coquimbo, in
the earthquake and tidal wave zone.
The steamer carried many notables
and was due to have arrived yester
day. Repeated radio calls to her from
stations along the Chilean coast failed
to bring an answer.
