# UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO CO-EDS TAKE UP MARKSMANSHIP
## 
### 
University of Idaho marksmen be
lieve they will need to look to their
records since women students are tak
ing up rifle drill. The first practice held
last week under the supervision of
Captain Loyd was mainly spent in dis
abusing the women of the notion that
both eyes must be closed at the mo
ment of pulling the trigger. As yet the
class is limited through lack of ma
terial, but it is hoped to enlarge the
classes to accommodate all women who
wish to take it. Regulation army
rifles are being used.
