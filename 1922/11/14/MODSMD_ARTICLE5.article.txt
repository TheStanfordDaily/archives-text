# CARDINAL ELEVEN STARTS PRACTICE FOR VIKING GAME
## Men Who Played Saturday Get One Day Rest; Kerr Begins Work Again Today 
### 
While football "experts" criticize Stan
ford in one paragraph and laud Califor
nia in the next, Andy Kerr and his red
shirted warriors are quietly starting a
final drive that will win from Washing
ton next Saturday.
That is Kerr's main concern at pres
ent—to get safely by the contest with
the Vikings without any injuries that will
weaken the Cards for the Big Game.
Yesterday afternoon all those that
started against the Trojans, together with
Norm Cleaveland, were given a vaca
tion, but they resumed practice this aft
ernoon.
Stanford is not in nearly as bad a way
as San Francisco football writers would
have their readers think. Kerr's gridmen
were nervous and over-anxious against
U. S. C, especially the more inexperi
enced members of the eleven. The offen
sive strength wasn't there because Wil
cox and Doughty, who are just about 90
per cent of the attack, were gone. That
team Saturday wasn't anywhere near the
ultimate strength of the Cardinal. There
were plenty of faults, but none that can
not be remedied.
Bob Cravens, together with Hawkins
and Newman, an Indian of the Trojans,
wrecked many a well-planned play.
Cravens, according to Kerr, played the
best game he has thus far this season,
and the Cardinal left guard has been go
ing at a fast clip.
One thing that made some of Stan
ford's plays look bad was that Hender
son's men were calling the plays. "Bud"
Woodward would snap the signals, and
on many occasions Chct Dolley would
tell his mates where the play was di
rected before DeGroot got rid of the ball.
On the double criss-cross Newman was
through the Stanford line and had
tackled the man with the ball before the
triple passes had been completed.
