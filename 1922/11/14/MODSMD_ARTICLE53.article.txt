## 
### 
Swedish athletics have at last come
into their own at Stanford, according to
late reports from dwellers in the Union.
Several times during the past two weeks
drills have been observed in the Women's
Clubhous rivalling preparations for a
fete day in Stockholm.
Accompanied by music and song, the
gymnasts go through every kind of calis
thenics from a breathing exercise to the
"Chicago." Many frantic attempts have
been made to ascertain the identity of this
corps of contortionists, but all have been
unsuccessful thus far. An unfounded
rumor says that it is the Ram's Head
Pony chorus galloping off its daily dozen.
