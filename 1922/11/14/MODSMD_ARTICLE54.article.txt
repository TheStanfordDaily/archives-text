# "LAST OBSTACLE" TO U. OF C. STADIUM TO BE REMOVED
## 
### 
The last obstacle blocking the im
mediate construction of California's
memorial stadium is expected to be re
moved today when the Berkeley city
council meets to approve the revised
plans for placing the bowl in Straw
berry canyon. The special stadium
committee appointed by the council
has already expressed itself as being
in favor of the final plans.
Objections to the original plans for
placing the stadium in Strawberry
canyon were voiced by Chief of Police
August Hollmer and Fire Chief G. Sid
ney Rose on the grounds that poor j

parking accommodation would in
crease the fire hazard in the surround
ing territory. These objections were
withdrawn when the revised plans
were shown to provide safe and ade
quate parking.
Architect's sketches showing in de
tail cross-sections, grading, and other
technical features of the stadium are
on display today from 11 to 4 o'clock
in Architecture hall.
The new stadium, which will be a
combination of the earth-bowl and
coliseum types and will cost in excess
of $1,000,000, will be ready for the
1923 Big Game. The entire structure
will be of concrete, seating approx
imately 72,000 persons.
