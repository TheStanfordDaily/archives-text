# CHINESE MYSTERY SHOW WILL BAFFLE DECLARE PRODUCERS
## 
### 
Breathing the spirit of the Orient,
with its colorful tapestries and robes,
baffling and humorous conjuring acts,
jingling music, and typical Chinese folk
dances, the coming Loong Fat produc
tion, to be presented by Hock How, '25,
and C. H. Lee, '23, for the benefit of the
Second Million for Stanford campaign,
on next Saturday night, will, from pres
ent indications, strike a new note in the
long list of "distinctly different" per
formances which have played over the
Assembly hall footlights. Comedies,
melodramas, burlesques, and Denishawn
dancers have gone by the boards, but the
magician and his store of tricks and ap
pliances in typical Chinese atmosphere is
yet to come.
If you have ever become so completely
mystified at the bewildering antics of
magicians that you have leaned back in
your seat to gasp and murmur, "How did
he do it?" you will like How's perform
ance. Bedecked in rich flowing Chinese
robes, and carrying a huge casaba-shaped
headgear, with long dangling tassels, How
will mystify you. Yeh, verily, he will
almost upset you. He has appeared in
San Francisco and Stockton vaudeville
houses, and in every case the perform
ance had to be halted because someone
fainted.
The music which will be given at fre
quent intervals to relieve this tension will
be typical Chinese folk songs, according
to Lee, who is managing this end of the
production. He promises something
which will have a special appeal to an
American audience. 11. C. Wong, '25,
will perform on the Chinese harp.
Nellie Leong. 8 years of age, and a
dancer, who is well-known, and Annie
Chang, 9 years old, a singer, who toured
the Orpheum circuit last year, will put
on an act.
Seat sale began yesterday at the Alumni
Secretary's office upstairs in the Adminis
tration building and at Crandall's in Palo
Alto. General admission is 50 cents, with
reserved seats at 75 cents.
