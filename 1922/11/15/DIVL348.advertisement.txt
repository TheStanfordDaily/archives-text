Shoes. Which kind gets you
j there the quickest?
rpwo college men were walking down the road,
A when a classmate whizzed by in his car.
"Pretty soft!" sighed one.
Said the other, "I'll show him. Some day
I'll own acar that's got his stopped thirty ways."
The more some men want a thing, the harder
they work to get it. And the time to start work
ing—such men at college know —is right now.
All question of classroom honors aside, men
would make college count for more if they realized
this fact: You can buy a text book for two or
three dollars, but you can sell it for as many
thousand —once you have digested the contents.
This is worth remembering, should you be
t inclined to the self-pity which social comparisons
sometimes cause. And anyway, these distinc
tions are bound to be felt, even though your
college authorities bar certain luxuries as un
democratic—as perhaps they are.
The philosophy that will carry you through is
this: "My day will come —and the more work
I crowd into these four years, the quicker I'll
make good.''
