# DICKENS PROGRAM IS PRESENTED BY READER
## Impersonation of Characters In Works of English Author Given by Frank Thompson 
### 
A large and appreciative audience
listened with interest to a program of
readings from Dickens which was
given last evening in the Little Thea
ter by Frank C. Thompson, profes
sional impersonator. The reader had
made his selections from the best
known works of the English author
and was able through skillful control
of his voice and actions to portray
to his audience many of the beloved
characters which have become so fam
ous to readers of English fiction.
The eloquent Mr. Micawber of
"David Copperfield" fame stood out
in brilliant contrast to the stammering
and embarrassed A. Toots Esq., whose
attempted proposal to the sister of
Paul Dombey in "Dombey and Son"
forms one of t humorous passages
of the novel. An example of skillful
elocution was given in the representa
tion of Mrs. Crupp, the landlady of
David Copperfield, in tile scene where
she attempts to diagnose David's seem
ing melancholy by accusing him of
being in love. This selection, together
with a representation of Mr. Mould,
the undertaker in "Martin Chuzzlewit",
were among the most popular on the
program.
The single touch of pathos which
Thompson included in his read
ings was the scene from "The Tale of
Two Cities" in which Sidney Carton
and the little Seamstress face the
guillotine together. The almost des
perate determination with which Sid
ney Carton comforts his companion in
her misery and faces his own death
without a tremor was represented
with real dramatic skill. Other charac
terizations which the reader presented
were taken from "Bleakhouse", "Barn
aby Rudge", "Nicholas Nickleby", and
"The Old Curiosity Chop". A scene
from Dicken's "Christmas Carol", the
book which is said to have done more
good than half the sermons which the
ministers of its decade preached, gave
the audience a glimpse of the charac
ter of Scrooge after the visit of Mar
ley's ghost had reformed him.
The reader of last evening's program
indeed lived up to his reputation of
being "the man of many voices." By
his tone well and bearing he was
able to draw a fine distinction between
the different characters, so that even
to one unfamiliar with the works from
which they were selected, it was ap
parent what impression they were in
tended to convey.
