# CAST OF "THREE LIVE GHOSTS" TO REHEARSE ON THURSDAY NIGHT
## Every Member of Group Is New on Local Stage With Exception of the Chorus 
### 
" Three Live Ghosts," the 1925 Sopho
more Play, will be rehearsed for the first
time Thursday night at 7 :30 in the Green
Room. All persons in the cast are ex
pected to be present at this reading.
None of the six sophomores who carry
the leading parts in "Three Live Ghosts"
haj» had previous experience on the cam
pus stage, with the exception of chorus
wc*k.
Edith Gronen, who takes the part of
Rose Gordon, has had previous experi
ence in high school and also carries a
part in "The Football Frothies of '22."
As Rose Gordon, the American girl, she
finds the key to her destiny in the news
paper she wraps around the china doll
which stands between her and the cold,
cruel cobblestones.
Evelyn Van Horn has the difficult char
acter part of Mrs. Gubbins, or Old Sweet
heart, as she is called. Mrs. Gubbins is
a fond step-mother, who, contrary to the
accepted view, is quite attached to her
step-son Jimmy. Old Sweetheart has a
fine appreciation of spirits, with sound
discrimination as to the promiscuous dis
tribution of the more volatile kind.
Jimmy Gubbins, played by Harold
Minsky, is responsive to his step-mother's
warm-heartedness t£ the extent of being
willing to comply to her startling but
most excusable request to remain "dead."
William Foster, played by Carl Ander
son, has the misfortune of being under a
cloud. Bill is quite willing to remain in
the land of the ghosts, but Scotland Yard
and others interested will not allow him.
Philip Urner takes the part of Spoofy.
Spoofy can't remember anything. He
exhibits a mystifying delight in pretty
things—anything that shines. The only
link between Spoofy and his past is an
inexplicable desire to acquire things. He
goes about it systematically finally
comes into his own.
Dorothy Dahler as Miss Peggy
Woofer has more than a passing inter
est in the Gubbins' family affairs.
