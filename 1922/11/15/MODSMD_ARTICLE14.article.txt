and England, will speak on "Lloyd
George, His Present Position in Eng
land," in the Little TShcater one week
from tonight. Tickets arc now on sale

"Lloyd George is a man of great
genius, a tricky politician, and the great
est opportunist in the history of the
world." This is Powvs' opinion of the
late Chief Minister of Great Britain.
According to the Kansas City Star, "It
is an experience worth while for a com
munity to come in contact with such a
stimulating, unusual personality. His
challenge provokes thinking."
