# FORWARD PASS IS STRONG POINT IN BAGSHAW'S ATTACK
## Vikings Have Weaker Defense Than Trojans; Andy Kerr's Men Are Taking Things Easy Week. 
### 
Enoch Bagshaw, who used to turn
lumberjacks into good football players,
at Everett High a few years back, has
his Washington Vikings all ready to
take Stanford down a notch Saturday.
And Bagshaw isn't planning to do
it by straight football, because his
backs could only make thirty-seven
yards through the Bruin line. While
Andy Kerr's first line defense is sup
posed to measure up to California's, it
seems no wild guess that the Vikings
won't make very many yards on
straight football against the Cards.
It is reasonable to suppose that after
the Vikings have bumped the Stanford
wall a few times, they will resort to
tactics of a wiser and more tricky na
ture. That is where Leonard Ziel, who
is the most-talked-of player in the
Northwest, comes in.
Ziel almost scored, single-handed, on
the Bruins. He ran back a punt forty
five yards, and then skirted Muller's
end for nine yards. A Bruin was off
side, and then Zeil passed five yards to
Abel, Viking quarterback. The next
play was another pass, Ziel to Harper,
for nine more yards, and then Bag
shaw's ace hurled the pigskin over the
goal line into the arms of Hall, right
end.
Kerr knows that it behooves him f.o
work up a defense that will stop Ziel
and his forward passing. It isn't pos
sible to drill the first-string Cards
strenuously, for they have been
through one hard game after another,
so there will be a "dummy scrimmage"
most of the afternoons.
Things are looking good for a Stan
ford victory Saturday. Wilcox isn't in
any too good condition, but now it
seems that Rae Doughty may be able
to play. That will make a lot of dif
ference in the Stanford backfield.
Doughty has the weight, he has the
ability to run the ends, and he has
worked with the others since Septem
ber 15. It all counts â€”especially on a
team where an experienced man is at
a premium.
Wilcox, with his kicks going fifty
yards and more, should vanquish Ziel.
The Card halfback has been averag
ing between thirty-seven and forty
yards, while Ziel averaged thirty-live
last Saturday.
It is hardly probable that Stanford
will be up against anything like the
defense U. S. C. had last Saturday.
Bagshaw hasn't been able to scout
Ker's plays, so he has only a general
idea of what the Cards will do. It is
the Viking offense that will bother. If
that is stopped, then Kerr's men should
haye little to worry about.
Jim Lawson, who has been starting
at right end for the Cardinal, went
to the hospital last night with an in
jured leg which will keep him out of
the Washington fracas. This time his
good limb went back on him, and he
may be through for the season.
