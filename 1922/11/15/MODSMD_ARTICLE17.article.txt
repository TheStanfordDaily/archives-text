# OLYMPIC CLUB WILL BE SCENE OF FIRST WATER POLO GAMES
## 
### 
Coach Ernie Brandsten will send
his water polo seven against the Olym
pic Club team at 8 o'clock tonight in
the Olympic Club tank in San Fran
cisco in the opening contest for the
junior national championship.
The Cardinals are going to the Bay
City with the intention of gaining re
venge for their defeat in the finals
last year at the hands of the club
mermen.
Brandsten's aggregation is one of
the fastest that has ever worn the
Cardinal colors and if they play the
same type of game against the club
team that they have in practice games
they should have 110 great trouble in
winning.
The Winged "O" seven has lost the
majority of its star players from last
year and has had to rebuild entirely
its team, using several swimmers who
have had very little polo experience,
but who are known about the city of
the Golden Gate for their swimming
ability.
The players who will make the trip
are: Forwards, Fletcher, Meyers, Cap
tain Miller; backs, Lacey, McCallister,
Austin; goalkeeper, Collett; substi
tutes, Sclimieder, Belcher, Hooper, Lo
gan, Graham.
The California water polo squad is
also slated to play its first match
against the Pacific City Club at the
Olympic Club tank this evening.
The freshman water polo team will
have its first contest of the season
next Saturday morning when they meet
the Berkeley High team in Encina
pool at 10:30.
This game will enable the Cardinal
mentor to see how his charges can
perform. The strength of the Berkeley
team is not known, but in the past
seasons they have turned out some
fast swimming teams.
In the practices Coach Brandsten
has been experimenting with numerous
combinations. Only a few of the first
year men have had any previous ex
perience in the polo game but they
have adapted themselves to it very
rapidly.
So far Mack, Lewis, and Harris seem
to be first choices for the forward
positions; with Langley, McGettigan,
and Morrison playing the guard posi
tions. Flagler shows the most style
and skill at the goalkeeper's position.
Kay, King, and Schumacher may be
chosen to play in place of the above
slated men at any time.
