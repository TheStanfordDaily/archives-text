### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. (United
Press). â€”President Harding, although
the soldiers' bonus forces in the election
gained sufficient strength in the Senate
to pass an adjusted compensation meas
ure over his veto, is still strongly opposed
to the bill, it was officially stated by a
spokesman for the executive at the White
House today.
1 he President directed this spokesman
to deny reports that the executive's atti
tude toward the measure had been
changed because of the elections, in which
anti-bonus Senators were defeated and
state bonuses approved in five states.
