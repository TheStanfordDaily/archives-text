						ROSE UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME

Harvard is among the latest of the universities to
ban pet names used to label college teams. The
Easterners oppose the term "yearling" for fresh
man, because, according to an accepted definition,
it means a beast in the second year of its growth.
The University of Nevada threw off the name
"Sagebrusher" and at the same time disowned
"Jackrabbit." The University of Washington, after
some discussion, settled on "Huskies," and the
Nevadans chose "Wolf Pack." Meanwhile, Stan
ford is trying to decide whether her teams are to be
referred to as the "Cards" or the "Indians." And
there's the rub. Whenever any organization chooses
a name, somebody within it always wants a new
one, and before either the first or second is gen
erally accepted, a third is proposed.
When a college gets a name that serves a good
purpose for several seasons, that name ought to be
kept unless some especially serious objection is
raised. Or if another is decided upon, the first
ought to be definitely dropped in order to avoid con
fusion.
As to names for the freshmen teams, "Babes,"
"yearlings," "first-year men," the classical numeral
and even "Dinks" have been used. These are only
local terms as a general rule and are used to avoid
repetition. Anyone who can see unfavorable con
notation in the word "yearling" as applied to a
freshman team certainly has a well developed sense
of astheticism. People should remember that writers
of freshmen sport stories are deprived of certain
terms, such as "Varsity." It is necessary, then, to
use other names for the team. One cannot help
sympathizing with the reporter of "yearling" sports
for the Harvard student paper.
