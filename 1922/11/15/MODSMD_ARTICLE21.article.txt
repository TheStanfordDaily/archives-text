* A ripple of comment was caused recently by a very
precursory survey of the local automobile situation
this week in these columns. The editorial board is
not satisfied with a ripple in this case and, in fact,
would like to hear a big splash. Anybody who
either owns a car or occasionally rides in one cer
tainly must have some views on the subject. About
a week's airing of opinions on this question would
bring the issues down to a debatable point and might
serve as a basis either of proving the argument of
one side or the other or of effecting some kind of a
compromise. For both sides to feel that they are
not only in the right, but have squelched the opposi
tion is not even a draw and does not help to clear
things up. Let us define the issues, at any rate. The
columns of the Daily are open for that purpose.
