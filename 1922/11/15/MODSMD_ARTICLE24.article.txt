## MONOLOGUE 
### Launcelot Lump 
His droning voice and hazy face
Float up to me through distance space;
I hear his facts and note his laws
And jot down economic flaws;
His words are dry as Menlo's dust,
His lectures universally cussed.

The others sit there, row on row,
And play their games of tit-tat-toe,
Or gently nod, or study math,
Or plan to give the dog a bath.

Reading his manuscript found in a bottle.

Epilogue
But the students all rush to get into his class,
Which proves not a stude is a mere silly ass, %

The Cheerful Sole
Hello —ello —ello! Here you flunked the midquarter.
Tough luck, eh, —ha-ha! Yeh, got an A. Bet you didn't
give the rule of arithmetical retrogression, huh? That
accounted for it, huh? Most important question in the
ex. Oh sure, I got it. Less see —thesumofthewholeisun-
equaltotwicethesquareonthehypothenusedividedbvthirty-
percentcompoundedannually—see, I got it all memorized.
Yeh, I'd advise you to take out a leave. Get a medic
to think you up a high-sounding disease —no, it never
works, but I've only heard of a few guys getting kicked
out for trying it.
Hear jobs are awful scarce in the city—say, are you
taking that course on Care of Dependents. Well, goo'bye,
goo'bye, old man —wish you the best kind of luck.

Did you ever see Mary chase Walter?
He hit her one day with a beam;
She ran for a mile and a quarter,
And you could not see Mary for steam.
