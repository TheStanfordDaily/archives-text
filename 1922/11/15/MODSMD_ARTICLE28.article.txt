## 
### 
Latham True, acting University or
ganist. will play Wagner and Liszt
selections at the Organ Recital in
Memorial Church Thursday afternoon
at 4:15. His program is as follows:
Prelude to Lohengrin Richard Wagner
Walther's Preislied (Die Meistersinger
von Nurnberg) Richard Wagner
This is the master-song that wins
for Walther the hand of the fair
Eva, in competition with the Mas
ter-singers' Guild of Nuremtfurg.
Symphonic Poem: Les Preludes
Franz Liszt
The text is a line from Lamartine:
"What is Life but a series of Pre
ludes to that unknown Song of
which Death sounds the first sol
emn note?" "Les Preludes" is the
best-known of Liszt's symphonic
poems for orchestra. The composi
tion portrays in tone the develop
ment of a life, â€”the passing pleas
ures of love, the unrestrained pas
sions of youth, the sterner strug
gles of ripened manhood, and the
fullness of realization that comes
with maturity.
