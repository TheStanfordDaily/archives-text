{United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORK, Nov. 15.—The Jones
method of coaching, which has been un
der some criticism, will have its acid test
Saturday, when Old Eli goes against
Princeton in the second of this season's
Big Three games.
Yale has been showing great improve
ment of late and from where we sit it
looks as if the Bulldog and the Tiger
would play a tie.
Of course, a favorite will pop up be
fore game time. There has to be a
favorite because the general football fan,
as in any other sport, demands something
to wail about if the favorite loses or an
excuse to stage a snake dance if the un
derdog comes through.

COLUMBI# Mo„ Nov. 15.—"Chuck"
Lewis, former Tiger football star, today
assumed charge of the Missouri Univer
sity eleven, following unexplained resig
nation of Head Coach Tom Kelly.
