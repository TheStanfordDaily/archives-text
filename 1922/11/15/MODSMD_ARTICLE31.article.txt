LONDON. Nov. 15. â€”Bonar Law ap
peared certain of a majority in the
house of commons at noon today after
Britain's election had been under way
for five hours in the metropolitan dis
tricts and four hours elsewhere.
Although foggy weather kept the
vote down this morning, and an air of
general apathy appeared to pervade
the polling places in many districts
political observers declared that un
less all signs went amiss, full returns
tonight would shoav the conservative
party safely "In" by a majority of
10 and 50.
