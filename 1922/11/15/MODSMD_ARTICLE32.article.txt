"Mysterious Japan," by Julian Street,"
a gift of the Japan Society to the |
Stanford Library, is on the new book i
shelf in the Library Reference Room !
this week. It is the story of the au
thor's trip to Japan, written in an in
teresting conversive style. He de
scribes and illustrates with photo
graphs the people as he found them in
everyday life, their ceremonies, cos
tumes, games, diversions, and litera
ture.
A second book on Japan presenting
serious contemporary problems is j
"Japan's Pacifio Policy" by K. K.
Kawakami. The Japanese author takes
up the questions of naval disarma
ment, the Pacific treaty, the Chinese 1
and Shantung dispute, and Japan's Si- :
berian ventures. He gives a full dis- j
cussion and explanation of the facts
in every case with a hint of the Jap- i
anese point of view.
"The Pacific Triangle," by Sidney
Greenbie, is, according to Greenbie an
attempt to bring the outstanding fac
tors in the Pacific within focus. Other
than the descriptions of the origin of
some peoples he says that all the facts
come within his personal experience.
He describes the book as an assem
blage of stories, types and descriptions
to illustrate native problems in Fiji,
Samoa, New Zealand, Japan, China,
and all the political problems involving 1
Australia, Asia, and America.
The China of today is depicted in
"China Awakened," by T. Z. Tyan, l
L. L. D. (London). Tyan says that the |
Shantung question has brought China j
to the notice of the world. Though I
the internal political and financial con-1
ditions are very unstable and confused
at present he tries to show that the
people are really sound and are only
awaiting an opportunity to resume nor
mal life. He tells of new reforms and
the history of the world war and peace
arbitrations.
