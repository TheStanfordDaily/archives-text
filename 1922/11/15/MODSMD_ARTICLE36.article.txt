# Use of Graflex Explained At Lens and Plate Meeting
## 
### 
"Steady nerves are the first requis
ite for taking action pictures," said
Glenn Kenyon in explaining the use
of the graflex camera at the Lens and
Plate open meeting in the Y. M. C. A.
reading room last night.
Kenyon described the construction
of the graflex and its operation, and
gave advice as to focusing and expos
ure. Football games, he said, are the
most difficult subjects.
A regular meeting of Lens and Plate
will be held next Tuesday. The secre
tary urges that all members be pres
ent as proposals for membership will
be considered.
