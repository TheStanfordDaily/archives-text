# Student Volunteers Send Delegates To Conference
## 
### 
Registration for the Northern Cali
fornia Student Volunteer Union shows
that seventy-five delegates attended
the conference which was held at
Stanford last week-end. These dele
gates represented nearly all the col
leges of Northern California including
the University of California and the
College of the Pacific.
Missionary speakers from different
parts of the Orient spoke on the con
ditions prevailing in these fields and
the work and workers needed to better
the conditions.
Delegates were entertained during
their stay at the homes of local Stu
dent Volunteers on the campus and in
Palo Alto.
