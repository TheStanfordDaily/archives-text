# GERMAN LEADERS SEEK TO PRODUCE PREMIER
## 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 15.â€”German leaders
today sought a combination of political
groups sufficiently stable to produce a
Premier. The Wirth government re
signed last night after nineteen stormy
months of office.
Refusal of the United Socialist to join
a coalition which included the German
People's party, which is backed by Hugo
Stinnes and other conservative elements,
was the immediate cause of Wirth's
downfall. Without the Socialists, he had
not a sufficient majority to carry on in
the face of adverse financial conditions
and the reparations tangle.
