Editor Alto:
It is interesting to note that with
one breath the San Francisco Call de
fends the University of California for
its action in not playing at Pasadena
on New Year's Day as a commendable
attempt to stamp out commercialism frn
football; and in the next suggests that
the Olympic Club should play there in
place of Washington or U. S. C. One
is moved to ask: Just how many de
grees from professionalism do we find
the Olympic Club's football team?
A little further down the column,
Edgar T. Gleason, author of both of
the above suggestions, goes out of his
way to hand Stanford the "bawl-out"
in regards to everything from the
"dumbness" of our coaches to the al
leged cry-baby efforts of our rooting
section to support our team. San
Francisco newspapers have been pull
ing for the Bears for so long that we
are used to that; but when they begin
to touch so intimately upon Stanford' 3
domestic relations as we found the
Call dbing on Monday, it is high time
for some loyal Stanford man to raise
a howl of protest.
"The play of Stanford this year has
been that of a team without a chap
erone," says the Call. "If the game, as
laid down by Kerr and Thornhill, is
the eastern system, a la Muggsy Mc-
Graw, it's the dumbest yet experienced
on the Coast."
It is noted that no credit is given
Coaches Kerr and Thornhill for turn
ing out the strongest team Stanford
has had in years. The Stanford team
of last year would not have had a
chance against that U. S. C. outfit. Last
Saturday the Cardinals were every bit
as good as U. S. C., knew just as much
football, and lost because U. S. C. had
a punch as well as a great defense.
"Believe me," continues the writer,
"110 team playing as Stanford played
Saturday is going to stave off the
quick thinking Erbs, Nicholses and
Mullers."
It is apparently forgotten, at least
it is ignored, that U. S. C. stopped the
quick-thinking Erbs, Nicholses and
Mullers. But it is hard to convince
some people that unless the Bear runs
up 45 points he is way off form and
were he right the opposition would
have no chance. Stanford stopped the
team that stopped California, yet if
Stanford plays no better than that our
team is to be mercilessly beaten in
the Big Game. That is because Cali
fornia could have beaten U. S. C. by
ten touchdowns if the Bear had not
had an off day on October 28!
The writer also takes a crack at Art
Wilcox for missing his man "two feet"
when he was knocked out. Very poor
work on Art's part. He hit Otto Ander
son like an express train and saved a
touchdown, yet he missed his man a
couple of feet and helped Stanford
give "its poorest exhibition."
Furthermore, neither U. S. C. nor
Washington is worthy of the honor of
substituting for the Bears on New
Year's Day. Both are the bunk and
Stanford is worse yet. So, let's have
the Olympic Club AND CUT OUT
PROFESSIONALISM.
To our point of view, it is not easy
to understand just how a team com
posed of college alumni and some men
who have never gone to college would
discourage professionalism. The Call
takes a crack at Washington and Jef
ferson because the Presidents play
freshmen and do not come up to the
standards of California. Does the Olym
pic Club conform to inter-collegiate

rules? No, and why should they? But,
when they don't, why suggest that
team as a remedy for an existing evil?
And why pick 011 Stanford? â€”M. S.
