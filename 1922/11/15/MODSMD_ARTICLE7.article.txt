# CUDDEBACKâ€™S PLACE KICKING ATTRACTS ATTENTION IN EAST
## 
### 
Parke Davis, statistician for the
Football Guide, a booklet published
annually on the principles and rules
of the gridiron game, has written Andy
Kerr about Murray Cuddeback's place
kicking records.
In the game with St. Mary's on Octo
ber 21, the varsity fullback kicked
three goals from placement out of
three attempts. The first was from the
thirty-five yard line, the second from
the twenty-five, and the third from the
fifteen.
Kerr will send in Cuddeback's name,
together with the circumstances sur
rounding the field goals. That means
that Cuddeback will be listed next
year along with Charles Brickley, for
mer Harvard star, and others who,
from 1873 to the present time, have
made unusual records in kicking field
goals.
