### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt has requested
the freshman football squad to turn out
this Friday, Monday and Tuesday of
next week to scrimmage the Varsity in
preparation for the Big Game. The
Babe squad* will attempt to follow the
style of play used by Smith's Cubs lasl
week.
After the Big Game it is probable that
the freshmen will turn out about twice
a week to keep the varsity players in
practice for the Pittsburgh game. Sev
eral of the freshmen will probably go
out for basketball. Solomon, Davis,
Fassoth, Nevers, Stevenson, and Mc-
Dermot are all experienced court players
