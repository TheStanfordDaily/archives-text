# OLYMPICS DEFEAT WATER POLO TEAM IN HARD BATTLE
## Stanford Five To Get Second Try At Gaining Junior Title In National Championships 
### Chesley M. Douglas, '23 
In one of the fastest and closest
contests of water polo ever staged on
the Pacific Coast the Olympic Club
team, after battling for three extra
periods, managed to defeat the Stan
ford Varsity squad by a score of 7 to
4 in the first game of the junior na
tional championships. According to the
way the schedule was arranged the
Cardinals will be afforded another
chance to meet the Winged "O" seven
if they defeat the Lowell High team
Friday night.
Johnson of the Olympics opened the
scoring with a tipped ball from Witt
of the same team. McCallister, Card
inal forward, accounted for the next
score. Charlie Fletcher sent Coach
Brandsten's men into the lead when
he broke through the club's defense
for another tally. The score at half
time stood 2 to 1 in favor of the
college aggregation.
Fast work by Tesson and Luster re
sulted in two goals for the club team
which put them ahead. In the last
few minutes of play Fletcher added
another score, just as it looked to be
an Olympic victory. The Cardinal team
was playing a class of game that
startled all the water polo authorities
present. McCallister evened the score
with a pretty throw just as the whistle
blew.
The officials in charge decided to
have the teams play two three-minute
periods in order to break the tie. In
these two periods both teams gave a
wonderful exhibition of playing but
neither could place the sphere within
their opponents' goal.
With the score still tied Referee
Johanson ruled that it would be ne
cessary to play another three-minute
session. In this frame the Olympics
got off to a good start and by desper
ate fighting managed to annex three
points, Johnson scoring one and Tes
son the last two, which gave the club
team a 7 to 4 victory.
The University of California had
little trouble in trouncing the Pacific
City team 6 to 2. The Blue and Gold
team will meet the Olympic Squad
tonight at the Winged "O" tank. The
Pacific City team forfeited to the Stan
ford team. Stanford will now play the
winner of the Lowell High and Nep
tune Club match on Friday. Stanford
should have little trouble in winning

from the squad which the Cardinal
Babes have already defeated. As a re
sult the Cardinal seven will meet
the winner of the Olympic Club-Cali
fornia match.
The schedule as arranged was
agreed to by all the contesting te&mn
before the start of the matches, and
gives a team a chance to lose and
still come out the winner in the final
games.
The line-up of the teams was:
Olympic Club —Forwards, Johnson,
Witt, Tesson; Backs, Bond, Luster,
Stoll; Goalkeeper, Shaw.
Stanford —Forwards, Fletcher, Mil
lerm, McCallister; Backs, Lacey, Aus
