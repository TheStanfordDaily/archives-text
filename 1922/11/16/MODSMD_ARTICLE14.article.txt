# SQUAD OF TWENTY-FIVE MEN FROM WASHINGTON IS DUE HERE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Enoch Bagshaw, the hardy Washing
ton coach, gathered his Vikings together
last night and headed them for Palo
Alto. Their itinerary is timed so that
they w.ill have a chance to look over the
Stadium, the scene of Saturday's com
bat, tomorrow afternoon.
While the Vikings are traveling, the
Cardinals are marking time, waiting for
Saturday. Kerr takes his men behind
closed gates, as he has been doing for
over two weeks. Any one of several
things may be going on behind the green
fence. Kerr may have decided to meet
Bagshaw at his own game, forward pass
ing, and is brushing up the Cards in that
department. Or he may be working to
make his defense even more air-tight.
It is most probable, however, that noth
ing outside of the usual daily routine
is happening.
It is going to be a great game Satur
day with the program reading; Ziel
versus Wilcox. Bagshaw's favorite does

everything that Wilcox doesâ€”passes,
kicks, bucks the line, runs through a
broken field. Both will have strong lines
in front of them, with the Vikings hold
ing the slight advantage in weight.
Bill Grinun, who is an old-timer in
these parts, is one of Bagshaw's tackles.
Grimm played against the Blue and Gold
in 1919, and every time that Dummy
Wells, Smith's chief plunger, hit Grimm,
he bounced back for a two-yard
loss. Bob Ingram, who is the Viking
captain, plays right tackle, and between
the two Shipkey and Johnston, both
playing their first year on the Varsity,
will have quite a time.
There is going to be a merry contest
between the rival ends. Hall and Pctric
from Seattle are specialists in caging
forward passes from Ziel. Mertz is
the most experienced of Kerr's wing
candidates, but Bob Janssen showed lots
of stuff at the beginning of the season.
He has been on the sidelines most of
