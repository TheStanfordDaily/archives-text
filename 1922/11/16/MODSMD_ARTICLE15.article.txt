Hold everything, men, there's a
rough session coming up! It'll be every
bum tor himself, and may the watch
dog take the hindmost. And don't
forget the barrels, for what is an un
dress parade without a barrel?
There'll be a warm time 011 the
Quad next Wednesday. Huh! Yeah,
next Wednesday is gonna be Rough's
Day, when all de guys shows up like
dey is gonna be when dey escapes
from collidge, de time when wearing
a arrow collar to class or sporting a
blood-and-sandy vest is like making
faces at de Twentieth Century Limited
Things ain't like they used to was,
when Harry Phiz was de king of de
Engineers, but who the Mephistopheles
cares? Harry will be back wit de cor
ner gang next week, and he gets
crowned again ifÂ«de supply o' bricks
holds out.
