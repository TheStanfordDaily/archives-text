# THIRD PARTY FOR NEXT ELECTION IS NOW PREDICTED

WASHINGTON, Nov. 16.—A third
party will be manufactured for 1924,
whether there is public demand for it
cr not.
Politicians of both great parties pre
dict this, declaring the next two years
will see determined' afforts to create
a third party and that whether it will
finally appear as a spontaneous ex
pression of dissatisfaction with exist
ing factions depends upon three
things:
J —Taxation and the cost of living.
2 —lndustrial and economic policies
oi the government.
3—How fast Europe gets back on its
feet.
But whether public sentiment de
mands it or not, observers whose pre
dictions seldom go wrong see a third
party presidential ticket in the field
in 1924 drawing many votes. But the
third party will be organized and
mainly supported by people who are
not now republicans or democrats.
The kind of third party the republican
and democratic leaders are concerned
about is one made up of republican
or democratic voters, or both —a third
party that will ruin either one or both
of the now dominant political groups.
