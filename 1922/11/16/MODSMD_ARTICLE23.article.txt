# AN UPSET IN THE MOVIES
## 
### 
Permission has been granted the Lasky Studios
of Los Angeles to film the Big Game here a week
from Saturday. Excerpts from the play are to be
used in the screen production of Charles Norris'
novel, "Brass." One of the scenes is to be the
annual game between the Cards and the Bears, in
which Stanford is getting the best of it. Suddenly
a ne'er-do-well who wears the Blue and Gold is
sent into the game as a last hope. This remarkable
person wins the game for California and the lady in
the case.
Now that is a very nice way for the film to end
up—for California. We were just wondering what
the Lasky people would do if Stanford, who is sup
posed to get the worst of it, should shoot in a for
lorn hope and pull the California ne-er-do-well's
trick. It is to be hoped that it wouldn't spoil the
film, but even the Lasky corporation could afford to
see a come-back like that. Who on the Stanford
eleven will take the lead in this production?
