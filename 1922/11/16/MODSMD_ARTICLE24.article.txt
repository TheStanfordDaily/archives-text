# KEEPING UP APPEARANCES
## 
### 
A few of these ancient, untidy posters of a by
gone clay that Hap in the breeze from telephone
poles and fence posts will be removed by the people
who put them up if the Executive Committee's
ruling has any effect. Old posters are not only ugly
to look at, but they destroy the advertising value of
fresh posters. The campus will look a lot better
when the old ones are gone.
But while we're talking in this strain, the matter
of following rules as to the laying of posters might
be discussed with advantage. There are certain
objects on the campus which are supposed to be
respected by the hand-bill distributor, but it seems
that the matter has been overlooked. Stickers are
slapped on the Quad buildings with the utmost un
concern, cards are tacked on trees without regard
for the tree or the card, and, in fact, anything that
isn't wholly sticker and puncture-proof is subject to
incipient posteritis.
It should not be necessary trÂ» paint '"Post No
anywhere on the campus.
