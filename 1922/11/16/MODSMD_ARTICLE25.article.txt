# HOW MUCH IS FOOTBALL WORTH?
## 
### 
An Australian sporting editor says that American
football is not worthy of the men who play it. Tie
remarks that Stanford's Stadium, the crowds, and
tlie rooting sections were admirable, yet he cannot
see many advantages in the American game.
It would seem that if football is worthy of such
crowds, of such rooting, and of the building of the
greatest Stadium in the West, that it is not exactly
a failure after all. It may be a case not of how
much football is worth as compared to other sports,
but of how much people THINK it is worth.
\merican colleges almost all seem to think that the
game as played in the United States is worthy of as
many men as they can get to play it.
Of course, the Australian authority 'did not get
to see as spectacular a game as other teams might
have furnished. American football as played be
tween two evenly-matched squads is not very ex
citing to anybody who does not understand it. But
whatever an outsider may say of football, its friends
are numerous enough to prove that it has some
merits.
