# A 						HALF-BUILT MILE STONE
## 
### 
Quietly and efficiently the first of the necessary
funds for Stanford's mile stone in France were
raised on the Quad last week by a tag sale. By noon
the women had sold out the entire supply of tags at
whatever the buyer was willing to pay—anywhere
from 10 cents to 50 cents. Even if not another cent

is given, the mile stone will have at least one thou
sand names behind it—one thousand people who
know of its existence and understand what it means.
But because the campaign WAS so quiet, many
people have not had an opportunity to give some
thing toward the memorial. Another chance will be
given soon in order that the full amount of money
may be sent to the American headquarters of the
memorial committee this month.
