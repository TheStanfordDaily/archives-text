On the eve before the big interclass football struggles
for supremacy, we have, at great cost and no end of
expense, not to say financial efforts, obtained exclusive
statements from each of the coaches in charge. Just
what they think —you'll have to guess at that yourself.
But here is what they say:
» » »
Freshman Coach: "I am positive that if we had
another chance at the sophomores, we would not be
found on the short end of the game tomorrow. As it is,
however, we play the juniors."
Sophomore Mentor: "Need I say that our tenor eleven
is in well-night perfect shape for almost anything on
Saturday—even a football game? Our linesman is espe
cially good."
Junior Overseer: "Although we will not have another
crack at the champions, we feel sure that it will be a
fine day Saturday. Most of the clouds are gone and the
frost seems to indicate cold weather."
Senior slave-driver: "In regard to the question as to
whether we or our opponents will win on Saturday, I
wish to t;ay that I think*so. In fact, it looks very
probable, and I would not be at all surprised if it
turned out that way."

What ere we going to do about the guy that thinks
the football coach has four wheels?
