# CONVALESCENT HOME GIVEN ADDITION OF TWENTY-BED WARD
## 
### 
Construction will begin at once on
the $22,000 unit given by Mrs. Henry
J Crocker to the Stanford Conval
escent Home on the campus. The new
twenty-bed ward will be the first of
the group of buildings constituting
the future Convalescent llome quad
rangle.
This addition will more than dou
ble the present capacity of the Home
which now accommodates only fifteen
children. Mrs. Crocker plans to equip
the new unit to care for twenty pa
tients.
Resident nurses will make it pos
sible to receive convalescent children
from the Stanford clinic in San Fran
cisco who are still too ill to be out of
bed. One nurse was added to the staff
last summer and since that time the
Home has been able to care for bed
patients.
The new ward will provide also for
children with contagious diseases;
heretofore the Home has not been able
to receive these cases owing to lack
of accommodations.
