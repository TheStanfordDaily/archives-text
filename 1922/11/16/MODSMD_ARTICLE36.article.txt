# REPORT IS MADE ON RED CROSS CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
With nearly all the returns in from
the Red Cross membership drive, Stan
ford's response to the annual roll call
almost reaches the $700 mark. Reports
from the residences on San Juan hill
and a few of the fraternities have not
yet been received. Professor H. R.
Fairclough, who directed the drive on
the campus, expects the contributions to
amount to $800.
Nearly all the living groups were fair
ly well represented in the membership
campaign. There were no 100 per cent
Red Cross organizations.
Any one who was not reached by the
Red Cross captains and wishes to sub
scribe to the membership drive may take
their contributions to Professor Fair
clough's office in Room 257.
