# Work on U.C. Stadium To Be Started in January
## 
### 
Construction of California's million
dollar Stadium will be started on cr
before January 1, according to a definite
announcement yesterday of Comptroller
Robert G. Sproul. Sproul deplored the
fact that the Berkeley council had de
layed in accepting the plans presented
by the Regents.
"Strawberry Canyon may or may not
be the ideal site," the Comptroller said,
"but the Regents have gone to the ex
pense of purchasing additional property
and have taken pains to make the pro
posed field one of attraction and a
project that will in no way reflect on
the adjoining property owners."
While Berkeley's council last Friday
held up the plans, it was claimed yes
terday that approval was assured for the
meeting next Friday. The Berkeley
Chamber of Commerce indorsed the site
yesterday.
