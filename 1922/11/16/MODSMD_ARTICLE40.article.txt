WASHINGTON, Nov. 15. —An anti
strike bill will be introduced by Sen
ator Cummins, lowa, early in the extra
session of congress which meets Mon
day.
This will be- the keynote measure in
a program of industrial legislation,
which Cummins, as chairman of the
interstate commerce committee, will
propose.
He will try to get President Hard
ing to urge enactment of this pro
gram, either in his message to the ex
tra session, or to the regular Decem
ber session. Cummins will confer with
Harding today or tomorrow.
Republican legislators were amazed
to hear of Cummins' determination to
press for anti-strike legislation as a
means of preventing future railroad
strikes. Most of them regard the pres
ent as the poorest time in recent years
to suggest such a thing and there is
little likelihood that Cummins' bill will
receive serious consideration for a
long time. — (Copyright, 1922, by The
