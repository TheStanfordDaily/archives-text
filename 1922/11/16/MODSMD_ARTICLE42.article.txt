# SOPHOMORES NEEDED TO DIRECT BONFIRE
## 
### 
A call for sophomore volunteers to
assist in the supervision of the construc
tion of the bonfire has been issued by
Gurdon Steele, '25, chief engineer of
the 1925 pile. Men are needed especially
between 3:30 and 6 in the afternoons
and on Saturdays.
Four high-poles have been erected and
considerable material gathered at the
base of the structure to date. The neces
sary flues to start the fire off the night
of the rally have been laid. As the ma
terials are being hauled on trucks under
the direction of Fire Marshal Ed Lamb,
the work of sophomores can be confined
to direction of the construction of the
bonfire itself.
