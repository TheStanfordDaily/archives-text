# Campus Telephone Poles Take on Springtime Hue
## 
### 
Due no doubt to the recent heavy
showers, campus telephone poles are
blossoming out in a vivid color scheme.
The poles themselves with their bright
green tint would make fitting markers
for any St. Patrick's Day parade if it
were not for the cross arms at the top.
These have been painted such a hue
that one of Sticky's Orange Domes must
be ashamed to bear the name.
Should any loyal son of Erin venture
on the farm while the telephone com
pany's linesmen are blighting the scenic
beauty of the campus with this direct
clash of colors, brtickbats And paint
buckets may be expected to fly, and the
fife department called out to quench a
riot.
