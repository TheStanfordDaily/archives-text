# CHINESE MYSTERY SHOWEDUCATIONAL STATE PRODUCERS
## Eighteen-Year-Old Girl Boxer Will Give Exhibition; Music And Dances Also Scheduled 
### 
When Nah Chang,- 18-year-old Chi
nese girl from San Francisco, steps
on the Assembly hall stage Saturday
night to go through her act of Orient
al boxing, the campus will be given
the start of an entertaining and edu
cational performance.
The purpose of "Loong Fat" as pre
sented by the Chinese students at
Stanford for the benefit of the Second
Million, is primarily to entertain, ac
cording to the producers, Hock How,
'25, and C. H. Lee, '23; but the typ
ical Chinese music and dances, the
display of richly colored tapestries
and robes, and the exhibition of box
ing, will offer also a liberal education
al insight into Chinese life. The con
juring acts to be given by How will
of course constitute the major part of
the program, but other things have
been added to make the evening di
versified.
Boxing, as it is conducted in China,
involves not only the use of the hands,
but also the feet. Long poles at times
seven feet in length are also intro
duced when the person is in grave
danger. Before Western ideas came
into China, this form of self-protection
occupied much the same position as
firearms now do. Miss Chan, who has
just arrived from China, is a graduate
of a normal school there, and intends
to continue her studies in an Amer
ican university. She is considered to
be one of the best boxers of her sex.
The regalia which How will wear
as chief magician, in the vernacular
of the ring, will be a "knock-out."
Garbed in a bright red silk robe, heav
ily embroidered in many colors, and
wearing a complicated headgear con
sisting of a score or more of indi
vidual pieces with green tassels hang
ing from the sides, How will procure
the impressive effect necessary for
his act.
This type of clothing was worn by
all Chinese during the Ming dynasty
300 years ago, but with the entrance
of the Manchurian dynasty, a radical
change in fashions took place and
plain clothes were accepted. The spec
tacular robes worn during the Ming
reign were preserved by actors, who
adopted them as regalia in all Chinese
dramas.
T. S. Wong, '26, will perform on the
Chinese harp, which is considered by
authorities to be one of the best of
Oriental musical instruments. Wong's
harp is made of a red wood, and had
its origin in Yang county in China.

It is therefore called the "Yang Kum"
harp. Harps originally in China were
used only in the homes of scholars and
high officials. Only recently were they
made available for ull lovers of music.
The Misses Chang and Chien of
Berkeley will also play Chinese mus
ical instruments. Nellie Leong, 8 years
of age, a well-known dancer, and An
nie Chang, 9 years old, a singer who
toured the Orpheum circuit last sea
son, will present typical Chinese
songs and dances.
Seats can still be purchased at the
Alumni Secretary's office upstairs in
the Administration building or at
Crandall's in Palo Alto. General ad
mission is 50 cents, with reserved
seats at 75 cents.

seats at 75 cents.
When Nah Chang,- 18-year-old Chi
nese girl from San Francisco, steps
on the Assembly hall stage Saturday
night to go through her act of Orient
al boxing, the campus will be given
the start of an entertaining and edu
cational performance.
The purpose of "Loong Fat" as pre
sented by the Chinese students at
Stanford for the benefit of the Second
Million, is primarily to entertain, ac
cording to the producers, Hock How,
'25, and C. H. Lee, '23; but the typ
ical Chinese music and dances, the
display of richly colored tapestries
and robes, and the exhibition of box
ing, will offer also a liberal education
al insight into Chinese life. The con
juring acts to be given by How will
of course constitute the major part of
the program, but other things have
been added to make the evening di
versified.
Boxing, as it is conducted in China,
involves not only the use of the hands,
but also the feet. Long poles at times
seven feet in length are also intro
duced when the person is in grave
danger. Before Western ideas came
into China, this form of self-protection
occupied much the same position as
firearms now do. Miss Chan, who has
just arrived from China, is a graduate
of a normal school there, and intends
to continue her studies in an Amer
ican university. She is considered to
be one of the best boxers of her sex.
The regalia which How will wear
as chief magician, in the vernacular
of the ring, will be a "knock-out."
Garbed in a bright red silk robe, heav
ily embroidered in many colors, and
wearing a complicated headgear con
sisting of a score or more of indi
vidual pieces with green tassels hang
ing from the sides, How will procure
the impressive effect necessary for
his act.
This type of clothing was worn by
all Chinese during the Ming dynasty
300 years ago, but with the entrance
of the Manchurian dynasty, a radical
change in fashions took place and
plain clothes were accepted. The spec
tacular robes worn during the Ming
reign were preserved by actors, who
adopted them as regalia in all Chinese
dramas.
T. S. Wong, '26, will perform on the
Chinese harp, which is considered by
authorities to be one of the best of
Oriental musical instruments. Wong's
harp is made of a red wood, and had
its origin in Yang county in China.

It is therefore called the "Yang Kum"
harp. Harps originally in China were
used only in the homes of scholars and
high officials. Only recently were they
made available for ull lovers of music.
The Misses Chang and Chien of
Berkeley will also play Chinese mus
ical instruments. Nellie Leong, 8 years
of age, a well-known dancer, and An
nie Chang, 9 years old, a singer who
toured the Orpheum circuit last sea
son, will present typical Chinese
songs and dances.
Seats can still be purchased at the
Alumni Secretary's office upstairs in
the Administration building or at
Crandall's in Palo Alto. General ad
mission is 50 cents, with reserved
seats at 75 cents.
