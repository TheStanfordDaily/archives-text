# KING HABIT BREEDS THIRST FOR POWER IN LAST ELECTIONS
## 
### 
The political problems of two kings
were solved when they were recently
elected district attorneys by their ad
miring subjects. King Edward I, alias
Henderson, *19, has been elected dis
trict attorney of Tulare County, Cali
fornia. The other member of the no
bility who has entered politics iÂ¥ His
Majesty Joe Murphy, '20, who will
soon take up his duties as district at
torney of Nye county, Nevada.
Henderson and Murphy reigned for
short but brilliant periods over the
Royal Kingdom of Stanford for two
days during the springs of 1920 and
1921 respectively.
And now that two of the former
carnival kings are busily engaged at
their respective wood piles and the
Kaiser is happily married, how about
"Husky" Wassum?
