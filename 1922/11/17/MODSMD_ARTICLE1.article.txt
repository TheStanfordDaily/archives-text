## CONSERVATIVES HAVE CLEAR MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT 
### Lloyd Allen United Press Staff Correspondent 
LONDON, Nov. 17. â€”With a clear
majority of 85 seats over all other
political parties in parliament, Pre
mier Bonar Law is to have ample op
portunity to test his policy of "tran
quility" when commons convenes next
jNlcnday.
The conservatives won a tremen
dous victory; a victory that was a
surprise to the country coming as it
did after early announcement of suc
cesses of the labor party. Heavy vot
ing in the industrial districts had put
r.iany labor candidates into office
early, but when returns from outlying
districts came in, Britain's general
election of Wednesday proved to have
been something in the nature of a
conservative landslide.
Bonar Law's government will be un
hampered for the present; his ma
jority makes it possible for him to
rule- parliament in as autocratic a
fashion as Lloyd George while at the
head of the coalition government.
