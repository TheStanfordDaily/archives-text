# SENIORS PLAY â€™25 CLASS TOMORROW
## 
### 
With the silver football donated by
three members of the Board of Ath
letic Control up as a trophy, the linal
round of play for the inter-class grid
iron championship will be held tomor
row morning on the varsity training
lield. Following the junior tilt at 9
o'clock, the seniors and sophomores
will take the field for the game which
is to decide the title. The big game
will start about 10:30.
The sophomores and seniors enter
the game on even terms. Harold Lund
berg's '25 men so completely upset
the dope In their 7 to 0 win over the
more experienced freshmen last week
that no one would go so far as to pre
dict their defeat tomorrow. On the
other hand, Glenn Pollard's seniors
won an impressive 14-to-O 1 victory over
the junior eleven. The seniors will out
weigh their rivals about ten pounds to
the man, and in inter-class football
weight counts considerably.
The '23 eleven has been scrimmag
ing with the Babes this week and did
not show up nearly so well as the
second-year men did in their game
with the Dinks. Ken Nef, star of the
senior backfield and one of the most
able men in the circuit, is out with an
injury.
There are various predictions as to
the outcome of the freshmen-junior
tilt, which is a consolation round. The
juniors have a fine team, but the dinks
have been doing so well in their scrim
mages with the seniors that many pick
the yearlings to carry the day.
