# BASKETBALL NEXT ON INTER-CLASS PROGRAM
## 
### 
Immediately at the end of the inter
class football program comes the an
nouncement from C. W. Davis, director
of intramural athletics, that inter-class
basketball contests will be held.
Letters explaining the plan of the
competition have been sent to each of
the class presidents. The first move in
securing a program is a meeting of all
men interested in class basketball in
the lobby of the Old Union at 7:15
Monday night. At that time class
coaches and managers will be ap
pointed similar to the arrangements
made for the football contests.
Each class will be assigned certain
hours for practice in the gymnasium
or the basketball pavilion and two
teams, a first and second team, will
be formed. Games will be scheduled
to allow each team to play each rival
in a Round Robin affair. Second team
games will .also bo scheduled and
members of the squads will have an
opportunity to advance to the first
squad as in varsity competition.

Practice will start Tuesday and will
continue until November 30, thus giv
ing the men two weeks in which to
round into shape and organize teams.
The two weeks before final examina
tions and Christmas vacation will be
devoted to playing off the six inter
class games. x
The schedule will probably provide
for three games to be played each
week, one on each of three nights.
However, to save time, four games
may be played the first week, two on a
night, and the remaining two the fol
lowing week on one night. This ar
rangement will then allow any tie
games to be played off or, in event of
a tie betwee ntwo teams, it will per
mit a final championship game before
the start of examinations.
All men who can should attend the
first meeting in the Old Union Mon
day night. Those unable to be present
should get in touch with their class
president and with their team coach.
Announcement will be made of the
trying out for their class team. Most
selection of the coaches and lists will
be posted in the gymnasium for the
of the practicing will be done in the
gymnasium but all of the six inter
class contests will be held in the bas
ketball pavilion where loyal class
looters can view the struggles.
The meeting Monday will be ad
dressed by Dr. W. H. Barrows and
Coaches Andy Kerr and "Husky"
Hunt. Kerr and Hunt are both inter
ested in the coming contests since by
means of them they can get some idea
of the material they will have at
hand for their basketball teams this
winter. Kerr will coach varsity bas
ketball and Hunt will have charge of
the freshman cagers.
The interclass tournament will in
no way conflict with the intramural
contests which will not start until the
beginning of the winter quarter.

looters can view the struggles.
The meeting Monday will be ad
dressed by Dr. W. H. Barrows and
Coaches Andy Kerr and "Husky"
Hunt. Kerr and Hunt are both inter
ested in the coming contests since by
means of them they can get some idea
of the material they will have at
hand for their basketball teams this
winter. Kerr will coach varsity bas
ketball and Hunt will have charge of
the freshman cagers.
The interclass tournament will in
no way conflict with the intramural
contests which will not start until the
beginning of the winter quarter.
Immediately at the end of the inter
class football program comes the an
nouncement from C. W. Davis, director
of intramural athletics, that inter-class
basketball contests will be held.
Letters explaining the plan of the
competition have been sent to each of
the class presidents. The first move in
securing a program is a meeting of all
men interested in class basketball in
the lobby of the Old Union at 7:15
Monday night. At that time class
coaches and managers will be ap
pointed similar to the arrangements
made for the football contests.
Each class will be assigned certain
hours for practice in the gymnasium
or the basketball pavilion and two
teams, a first and second team, will
be formed. Games will be scheduled
to allow each team to play each rival
in a Round Robin affair. Second team
games will .also bo scheduled and
members of the squads will have an
opportunity to advance to the first
squad as in varsity competition.

Practice will start Tuesday and will
continue until November 30, thus giv
ing the men two weeks in which to
round into shape and organize teams.
The two weeks before final examina
tions and Christmas vacation will be
devoted to playing off the six inter
class games. x
The schedule will probably provide
for three games to be played each
week, one on each of three nights.
However, to save time, four games
may be played the first week, two on a
night, and the remaining two the fol
lowing week on one night. This ar
rangement will then allow any tie
games to be played off or, in event of
a tie betwee ntwo teams, it will per
mit a final championship game before
the start of examinations.
All men who can should attend the
first meeting in the Old Union Mon
day night. Those unable to be present
should get in touch with their class
president and with their team coach.
Announcement will be made of the
trying out for their class team. Most
selection of the coaches and lists will
be posted in the gymnasium for the
of the practicing will be done in the
gymnasium but all of the six inter
class contests will be held in the bas
ketball pavilion where loyal class
looters can view the struggles.
