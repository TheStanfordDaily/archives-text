# BASKETBALL NEXT ON INTER-CLASS PROGRAM
## 
### 
Immediately at the end of the inter
class football program comes the an
nouncement from C. W. Davis, director
of intramural athletics, that inter-class
basketball contests will be held.
Letters explaining the plan of the
competition have been sent to each of
the class presidents. The first move in
securing a program is a meeting of all
men interested in class basketball in
the lobby of the Old Union at 7:15
Monday night. At that time class
coaches and managers will be ap
pointed similar to the arrangements
made for the football contests.
Each class will be assigned certain
hours for practice in the gymnasium
or the basketball pavilion and two
teams, a first and second team, will
be formed. Games will be scheduled
to allow each team to play each rival
in a Round Robin affair. Second team
games will .also bo scheduled and
members of the squads will have an
opportunity to advance to the first
squad as in varsity competition.

Practice will start Tuesday and will
continue until November 30, thus giv
ing the men two weeks in which to
round into shape and organize teams.
The two weeks before final examina
tions and Christmas vacation will be
devoted to playing off the six inter
class games. x
The schedule will probably provide
for three games to be played each
week, one on each of three nights.
However, to save time, four games
may be played the first week, two on a
night, and the remaining two the fol

rangement will then allow any tie
games to be played off or, in event of
a tie betwee ntwo teams, it will per
mit a final championship game before
the start of examinations.
All men who can should attend the
first meeting in the Old Union Mon
day night. Those unable to be present
should get in touch with their class
president and with their team coach.
