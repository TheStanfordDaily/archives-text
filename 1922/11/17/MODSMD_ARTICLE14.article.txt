# BONFIRE GROWING SKYWARD; WILL BE FINISHED TUESDAY
## 
### 
A good idea of the slave armies of
the Pharaohs working on the pyra
mids may be gained by going down
and watching the freshmen at work
on their bonfire. With but four after
noons' work completed yesterday, the
pile was beginning to take on its final
form.
The four corner posts, marking a
twenty-five-foot square, point fifty feet
in the direction in which the Cali
fornia coffin will go on the fatal night.
An inclined runway has been built
about twenty-five feet up the side of
the funeral pyre, and along this a con
stant stream of inflammable material
is passed from hand to hand. To date
the first ten feet have been filled in
with rubbish, old lumber, branches,
crates, and the like. About one hun
dred freshmen are at work on the bon
fire at a time.
Very little of the material has come
from Palo Alto this year. Almost the
whole of the barn at Mayfield, which
was demolished by a windstorm last
winter, has been removed by the
freshmen, assisted by the military de
partment's trucks. Wood has also been
brought from the Convalescent Home
and the Nursery.
Living groups will be visited by Fire
Marshal Ed lamb today or tomorrow
to collect rubbfsh. Lamb promises
that when the freshmen have com
pleted their pile the campus will be
cleaner than it ever has been before.
The University will supply trucks and
wagons to help in this work. Scrap
lumber from the building operations
at Toyon and the Encina eating hall
will also furnish fodder. The top is to
be finished off with eucalyptus trees,
and the California coffin will be placed
on the apex by the Sequoia men Thurs
day before the rally.
Freshmen who have not put in their
hours are warned to do so before
Tuesday, when it is expected the work
will be finished. Those having labora
tory classes in the afternoon will be
permitted to work Saturday and Sun
day.
The bonfire will be guarded Tues
day and Wednesday nights. There will
be two guard shifts of three hours for
every freshman. Bulletins will be
placed in the postoffice stating at what
time each wlil be expected to guard.
