## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton has joined Eddie
Lamb's brigade of fire-fighters.
The setting was perfect and there
was a chance for someone to be a
hero. "Dink" was it.
Some thoughtless one had emptied
ihe ashes from the old track house
fuel burner into a wooden barrel at the
couth end of the track bleachers. Live
coals from the ashes set the barrel to
burning merrily. Flames leaped up
wards and the bleachers stood to go
the way of the San Carlos speedway.
Enter the hero! Track coach and
manager threw aside their official dig
nity and rushed to the scene of the
impending disaster. The burning bar
rel was dragged out to a safe distance
and the day was saved.
Boy, page Eddie Lamb!
