# VARSITY MEETS WASHINGTON IN LAST PRELIMINARY GAME; CLASS TEAMS TO START SECOND ROUND
## No Touchdowns Have Been Scored In Last Two Cardinal-Viking Contests on Gridiron 
### 
Stanford and Washington gridiron aggregations of the past two seasons
have not been "scoreless wonders," but for some reason, neither has been
able to cross the other's goal line. Last year they slipped and slid around in
the slush at Seattle for a scoreless tie. fn 1920 a long drop kick by "Dink"
Templeton won for Stanford, 3 to 0.
Its a pretty safe bet that there is going to be at least one touchdown to
morrow afternoon at the Stadium when the Cordinal and the Purple and Gold
hook up again. According to Viking enthusiasts, all that is necessary is that
Leonard Ziel, Bagshaw's "wonder man," lob the pigskin into the waiting arms

of Hall or Petrie,, and the trick is
done. The lads from Seattle are con
fidently expected to forward pass the
Stanford gridders to death and defeat,
with Ziel adding to the excitement
with a few dazzling runs of forty yards
or so.
To come right down to cleats and
headguards, and the rest of the grid
iron impedimenta, it might be any
body's game. The two lines are almost
even in weight, Bagsliaw's forwards
averaging one pound more than "Tiny"
Thornhill's charges. The Viking backs
hang it all over the Cards in respect
to weight, but not in anything else.
Cardinal followers expect Wilcox to
duplicate everything that Ziel doeB;
Dennis, who will again be found at
right half when the first whistle blows,
is rated as high as Ray Hill; Cudde
back should be able to line plunge
even better than Dubois, who is slated
to start since Bagshaw left his two
good fullbacks, Harper and Sherman,
in the cold north.
The contest may be won on field
generalship. Fred Abel is supposed to
be a mighty smart quarterback, and
he has fifteen pounds on Bud Wood
ward. Abel played on the 1921 Wash
ington freshman eleven that was said
to sit on tile fence every afternoon
begging Bagshaw to let them have a
crack at the poor varsity.
But Woodward is a scrappy quarter
back, and is in the fighting all the
t.me, He is getting better and better
as a field general, and if no one is in
jured, should engineer the Cards to a
touchdown or two.
Neither team is keyed up to the
highest pitch. Kerr wants to win to
morrow, but not at the expense of
weakening his men for the Big Game
the following Saturday. The Purple
and Gold played its "big game" against
the Bruin machine, and is now fighting
it out with U. S. C. for second honors
in the Conference.
The long, hard grind of the season
has begun to tell on the Cardinals to
a certain extent, and many of them
are nursing minor injuries. Norman
Dole will replace Jim Lawson, who
has a weak leg. DeGroot, Wilcox, an<?
Cuddeback have all been taking a rest,
however, and will have lots of fire
tomorrow.
Unless the going gets rough and
