# THE
						LAST OBSTACLE
## 
### 
Cardinal meets Sundodger tomorrow in Stanford
Stadium in the last game on the local field before
the sport classic of the football season on the
Coast. Coaches Kerr and Bagshaw have much to
gain in winning tomorrow's battle, and in spite of
the fact that both teams will be in poor compara
tive condition, they will probably put up the fight
of their lives.
If Bagshaw can take the laurels tomorrow, he
will stand a fair chance of representing the Coast
Conference at Pasadena 011 New Year's Day. If
Kerr can chalk up another victory, he will go
against California next week feeling that his men
have a much better chance to make a traditional
Stanford showing.
Misfortune has dogged the steps of the Card
Varsity for the past three weeks. One injury after
another has taken men from the game, and colds
and fevers have weakened the others. As for Bag
shaw, his men had a tiring fight with the Bruins
last week, and will arrive in even worse shape after
the ride from the North. But because both teams
have so much to gain by taking the long side of the
score, tomorrow's contest will undoubtedly be one
of the chief attractions on the Coast.
To predict the outcome of the battle one way or
another would be an indication of snap judgment.
Stanford is fast gaining the reputation of having
one of the most able defenses of western college
teams. In holding U. S. C., her line showed itself
capable of holding even California to comparatively
small gains. Injuries and shortage of reserves in
the backfield, however, makes the scoring proposi
tion a tough one for Stanford to think about.
As things look now, Stanford has a better chance
to win tomorrow's game than the team had against
the Trojans. But strong or weak on the offense or
defense, in good or poor condition, the coaches
and the team will do everything in their power for
victory. Stanford rooters, knowing this from past
experience to be the case, will be there en masse.
They are prepared to receive with enthusiasm the
best that Stanford teams offer in any game.
