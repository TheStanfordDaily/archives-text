# THE
						PURSE WITH THE ACHING HEART

It has been the custom of Daily editors in the
past to write against gambling on the campus
every time they lost money in a crap or poker
game. While the present editor is not making a
yell about the money he has lost in any kind of
betting, he would like to sing a swan-song about
point money on football games. Of the man who
wins on twenty-one points, yet loses because the
score was 20 to 0, these words sing scant praise.
Even a hint for invitation to dinner sometimes
fails when everybody else is in the same boat.
