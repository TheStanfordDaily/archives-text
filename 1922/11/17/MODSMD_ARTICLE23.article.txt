Weekly Book Review: "How to Find a Wife," by
Heck. A very human treatment of a dry subject. The
chapters on Wants Ads and Cave Man Methods are both
good. The discussion of the probability of crooking the
little finger at a woman and having her follow you is
interesting if rather disheartening. Chapter on the
college woman deleted by censor.
Next week we will review the sequel, "What To Do
After You've Made The Find."

Modern Fables
Once there was a Goat who liked to Butt everybody
and Everything. Once a Tractor came down the street,
but the goat did not Butt That. It was too Heavy for
HIM.
Moral: Don't use too many Butts in writing correct
English.

Dear Editor of Cabbages:
I notice that you have written several poems about
women so I guess you are well versed on them. I am
a young girl and much in love with a young man who
gave me a beautiful engagement ring. But yesterday
I saw him with another girl. Shall I believe him true?
—Betty.
Dear Betty:
Have the ring appraised. If it is valuable, go on
believing in him. —ED.
