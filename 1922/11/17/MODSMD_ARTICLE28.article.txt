# Track Prospects Face Regular Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
As evidence of the approaching track
season, "Dink" Templeton's proteges of
the cinder path will go through a regu
lar meet Friday afternoon. All track
events up to two miles and all field
events except the 56-pound weight, will
be held, it was announced.
In meets to date the hurdlers and dis
tance men have been taking things easy
over short distances, but tomorrow they
are in for a tough workout.
Templeton reports his men gradually
rounding into shape and expects some
fair marks tomorrow.
