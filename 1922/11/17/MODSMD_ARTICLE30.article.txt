# Women to Wear Rooters' Hats at California Game
## 
### 
White rooters' hats with a red "S"
on front and a red tasael on top will
be worn by the Stanford women root
ers at the Big Game on November 25.
The hats will be used to make a uni
form background of white for stunts.
All women must wear these hats in
order to obtain their seats in the root
ing section.
The hats arrived yesterday and will
be on sale for one dollar next Monday
at Roos Brothers in Palo Alto.
