# Mrs. Sherman Describes Modern Church to Y.W.
## 
### 
Unity, democracy, and a valiant search
for truth, mark the modern church, ac
cording to Mvs. Harry Sherman, presi
dent of the House of Churchwomen, who
spoke to the Y. W. C. A.yesterday aft
ernoon in the Women's Clubhouse.
"The church is the true force back
of every worthwhile movement," Mrs.
Sherman said. "In pagan California v/e
have not realized this; we have thought
that we are doing all that is necessary
when we live up to our ethical ideas. But
the habit of church-going is a stabilizing
influence, helpful to both ourselves and
the church."
Mrs. Sherman believes that the mod
ern church is now developing so rapidly
that the young people of today will see
great changes in its organization. A
freedom from theological rigidity char
acterizes the present day church, the
speaker said.
Miss Florence Tyler, national Pres
byterian student secretary, outlined the
opportunities for service in home and
foreign fields of Christian work. Fol
lowing her talk, Miss Agness Hall, na
tional Episcopalian student secretary,
gave a few pointers on problems of
"The Church on Main Street."
Preceding the speeches, Louise Wilber,
'23, played two violin solos, accom
panied by Sara Meskimmons, '25.
