# Negative Wins in Debate On Abolition of Ku Klux
## 
### 
Bertrand Comparet, '24, a member of
Stanford's Tri-State debate team last
year, won a 2 to 1 decision for the nega
tive over R. L. Walter, '24, at the regu
lar meeting of Nestoria last night in
Room 12 of the Law building, on the
question : Resolved, That the Ku Klux
Klan should be abolished. The decision,
however, does not represent the general

opinion of the society, according to Em
met McCaffery, '24, president.
Because the Klan cannot enforce laws
in an impartial way, Walter contended
that it is a menace. He also said that
it was organized for personal financial
gain.
Comparet claimed that there is a need
of some new agency to enforce the laws,
because of the decrease in efficiency of
present organizations. Comparet ven
tured to say that when the need of such
an organization is over, it will auto
matically disappear.
