"Von sot," meaning "magic"! That
is the keyword of the Loong Fat pro
duction to be presented by Hock How,
'25, and C. H. Lee, '23, in the Assem
bly hall tomorrow evening at 8:15 for
the benefit of the Second Million. "Von
sot" is that peculiar symbol which ap
pears in the upper left hand corner
of the yellow placards which have
been posted all over the campus.
The conjuring acts to be presented
by How will constitute the rpajor part
of the entertainment, but the delight
ful mixture of this magic with Orient-

al dancing, boxing, and peculiar jing
ling music, will form a program which
will add new color to the Stanford
dramatic boards. Burlesques, -junior
operas, comedies, dancers, symphony
orchestras, and tragedies have each
taken their turn. Magicians in typical
Chinese atmosphere will now occupy
the limelight.
How and Lee are both accomplished
wizards having given successful per

been in great demand for lodge and
club entertainments. Their repertoire
of tricks, stunts, aud illusions is un
usually large. Some of them will mys
tify and cause wonderment; others
will provoke laughter.
Magic acts presented in such per
formances usually give the audience
a tenseness of feeling which is diffi
cult to lose. This is the reason why
the Loong Fat program will be thor
oughly diversified including every
thing from a burlesque show to a box
ing exhibition by an 18-year-old Chi
nese girl. The colorful display of Chi
nese tapestries and robes such as those
worn during the Ming dynasty 300
years ago will also prove interesting.
The music under Lee's direction will
consist of Chinese folk songs and
popular American music jazzed a la
Oriental.
"Gen hi fon hee gee mon," promises
How, which in English means, "A
thoroughly enjoyable evening."
