# "FROTHIES" TICKETS GO ON SALE MONDAY
## Continual Practices Rounding Into Shape Satire on Local Conditions and Characters 
### 
The ticket sale for seats to the "Foot
ball Frothies" will be held Monday aft
ernoon, beginning at 1. Tickets arc sell
ing for $1.10 and $1.40.
Ram's Head satire on Stanford, pres
ent and future, is rounding into shape
through continual practice, so that detail
instruction may now be given toward
perfecting the work of the chorus es
pecially. Rehearsals are scheduled for
Saturday and for every day the follow
ing week. The show has been "put to
gether"â€”a good start at unity made, and
with a week left for the final polish,
chances that any noticeable flaw will
appear on the night of the Big Game
appear to be exceedingly small.
Although the show is mainly what the
pink cards claim, a "souffle," neverthe
less there is a thread of unity through
out. In this respect it will be different
from last year's Football Show, which
was made up of isolated acts after the
fashion of an Orpheum bill.
This unity can be traced to the fact
that one man, Dan Evans, has written
the complete show, including all the
lyrics. In this way cohesion has not been
sacrificed for the sake of putting in here
and there a lonely, if interesting, num
ber. There are fifteen musical numbers
in the show, the songs having been com
posed especially for the occasion by
Chick Midgley and Myron Higby. '
The two acts of the show will be sep
arated by a ten-minute intermission,
which will be inserted purely to give
the audience a chance to catch their col
lective breath, and not because of neces
sities of stage shifting. Clyde Coakley
and his assistants have worked out a
set-changing plan that shows promise of
making the actors speed up to keep pace
with it. Thirty seconds will be the max
imum time required for any scence shift
ing, and even those thirty seconds will
be kept lively by intervening skits.
Last night the choruses and the "Jazz
Dispensers" went through the "Pop Har
ris" bootblack scene, which purports to
give a glimpse into the shining future of
the local establishment. "Blue My
Shoes." a catchy tune concoctcd by Chick
Midgley, furnishes the musical accom
paniment to this prophetic bit of black
magic.
