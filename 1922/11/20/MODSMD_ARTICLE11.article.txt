# CLASS FOOTBALL TROPHY TAKEN BY SENIOR ELEVEN
## Sophomore Gridmen Blanked 8-0 in Deciding Contest; Freshmen Defeat Juniors 
### Maxwell Stiles, '25 
After the most desperately contested
struggle of the schedule, Glenn Pollard's
husky senior eleven won the interclass
football championship of Stanford Sat
urday morning by defeating Harold
Lundberg's sophomores, 6 to 0.
The winning score was made late in
the third period when Johnny Phelps
snagged a 17-yard pass from Jim Cop
len and ran four yards across the '25
goal line.
Dr. W. H. Barrow, one of the three

the perpetual trophy to Pollard immedi

class of '23 is the first to be engraved
on the trophy, which is emblematic of
the interclass championship.

The actual score of the feature game
was 8 to 0, although the two points
gained on a safety late in the final period
were denied the seniors when Referee
Post ruled that a touchback and not a
safety had been scored. George Varnell,
considered the best referee on the Coast,
saw the play. Pulling out a rule book,
he pointed to Rule 6, section 16, which
reads that a safety is scored when an
incompleted pass is grounded behind the
goal line of the team putting the ball
in play. The sophs had attempted a pass
from back of their goal and it was
blocked, falling in the end-zone.
Weight Wins For Seniors
The sophs outplayed .their opponents
in certain departments of the game, and
at times outfought them. But the su
perior weight of Pollard's eleven car
ried the day. The plunging of a very
large person named Kelly was the out
standing feature of the game. He made
consistent gains through the soph line,
and Nef and Kelly plunged oif tackle
with great regularity. In the line, Samp
son at tackle and Tritle at end stood
out. Thede played a smashing defensive
