# CLASS FOOTBALL TROPHY TAKEN BY SENIOR ELEVEN
## Sophomore Gridmen Blanked 8-0 in Deciding Contest; Freshmen Defeat Juniors 
### Maxwell Stiles, '25 
After the most desperately contested
struggle of the schedule, Glenn Pollard's
husky senior eleven won the interclass
football championship of Stanford Sat
urday morning by defeating Harold
Lundberg's sophomores, 6 to 0.
The winning score was made late in
the third period when Johnny Phelps
snagged a 17-yard pass from Jim Cop
len and ran four yards across the '25
goal line.
Dr. W. H. Barrow, one of the three
donors of the silver football, presented
the perpetual trophy to Pollard immedi
ately following the game. Thus the
class of '23 is the first to be engraved
on the trophy, which is emblematic of
the interclass championship.
Freshmen Defeat Juniors
In a preliminary game, the frosh came
to life and downed the juniors, 12 to 2.
The actual score of the feature game
was 8 to 0, although the two points
gained on a safety late in the final period
were denied the seniors when Referee
Post ruled that a touchback and not a
safety had been scored. George Varnell,
considered the best referee on the Coast,
saw the play. Pulling out a rule book,
he pointed to Rule 6, section 16, which
reads that a safety is scored when an
incompleted pass is grounded behind the
goal line of the team putting the ball
in play. The sophs had attempted a pass
from back of their goal and it was
blocked, falling in the end-zone.
Weight Wins For Seniors
The sophs outplayed .their opponents
in certain departments of the game, and
at times outfought them. But the su
perior weight of Pollard's eleven car
ried the day. The plunging of a very
large person named Kelly was the out
standing feature of the game. He made
consistent gains through the soph line,
and Nef and Kelly plunged oif tackle
with great regularity. In the line, Samp
son at tackle and Tritle at end stood
out. Thede played a smashing defensive
game for the losers, and Dicky at end
was the fastest man on the field. Rich
ards and Jergins stood out in the line.
The first half was about even, with
the sophs playing a purely defensive
game. In the third period Mason blocked
a senior punt and Ferguson recovered for
the sophs on the Sombrero 25-yard line.
Dickey completed a ten-yard pass from
Harrow, and on the next play a pass,
Harrow to Londahl, placed the ball on
the four-yard mark. The sophs were
penalized for off-side play, and then a
pass was intercepted, the seniors punting
out of danger.
Pass Wins Title
A moment later a poor punt by Har
row went out of bounds on his own 28-
yard line, and this led up to the senior
score. Coplen made yards on two
plunges, and then threw the pass to
Phelps that won the game. Goal was
not kicked.
The frosh had the better of the
juniors throughout. Stratton plunged
through the line for a score in the first
period, and in the second P.eaver fell
on the ball behind his own goal line for
a safety. Tn the third period Beaver
went over for the second touchdown
scored by the frosh.
