# PAVILION TO BE SCENE OF ANNUAL BIG GAME RALLY THURSDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford alumni and undergraduates will gather in the basketball pavilion
Thursday night for the annual bonfire rally.
With the passing of the custom of holding the rally in the Assembly hall,
the complexion of one of Stanford's oldest traditions is to be altered. For
years past, the pre-Big Game get-together has been held in the Assembly hall
and on many occasions students were turned away because the hall was filled.
Lou Minsky has arranged to make it possible for every student in the
University to get into the pavilion Thursday night.
The women will occupy the balcony on the south side of the building and
the alumni will be seated directly across the hall. The men will be on the
lower floor.
Andy Kerr's squad of grid warriors will occupy the position of honor on
the stage at the north side of the building. The Stanford band will furnish
music for the songs during the rally and will be given a place on the lower
floor.
T. T. C. Gregory, President Wilbur, and Jim Reynolds will represent the
alumni. Coaches Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill will talk from the football
mentor's point of view and Captain Dud DeGroot is to represent the varsity
and the undergraduates as a whole in his talk.
Following the rally in the pavilion, the bonfire will be lighted. The band
will lead a serpentine around the fire and undergraduates and alumni will
join in the parade.
Yell Leader Lou Minsky announces that no guns will be allowed in the
pavilion. Admission to the rally will be by student body cards.
