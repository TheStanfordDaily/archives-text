# WASHINGTON WINS FROM CARDINAL VARSITY, 12-8
## Blocked Kick Near Viking Goal Line Almost Nets Touchdown In Last Minute of the Play 
### Garrett Elmore 
Princeton beat Harvard by following the ball. Stanford, while it followed
the pigskin, failed to fall on it at the right time, and lost to Washington
Saturday, 12 to 8.
For fifty-nine minutes the Cards chased the ball up and down the field,
a la Princeton, never losing track of it. They were still close after it in the
last minute of play when Shipkey blocked Ziel's punt on the Viking's seven
yard line. Two red-jerseyed players reached for the pigskin as it rolled
aimlessly towards Washington's goal line.
But, instead of falling on it, the Cards tried to pick up the moving piece of
leather and carry it over the last line. It got away from them, and little
Dailey, substitute quarter, dove for it. Instead of a touchdown Stanford got

a safety, which proves that there is
many a slip 'twixt the two-yard mark
and the goal line.
It was a great game to watch if you
didn't mind who won. If you were for
Stanford, it was a hafd one to lose,
because that one miscue robbed the
Cards of a well-earned victory.
Bagsliaw's lumberjacks got the first
break in the early minutes when Mike
Hanley, brother of the Hanleys famous
in gridiron history of the Northwest,
recovered a fumble by Wilcox. Line
bucks and a pass, Ziel to Bryan,
brought the pigskin to Stanford's fif
teen-yard mark. The Cardinal line held,
and Ziel booted the ball between the
posts.
Before long Kerr's men got under
'way. Cuddeback fell on the ball when
Abel dropped it after running back
one of Wilcox's punts. Guy Dennis
ripped off eleven yards on a criss-cross
and then Cuddeback got his toe in
action on the fifteen-yard line.
In the middle of the second quarter
Wilcox passed nineteen yards to Den
nis, and a criss-cross in which Wilcox
traveled eight yards put Cuddeback in
posftion to score another three points.
It looked like Stanford's game at
half time. Wilcox had been outpunting
Ziel, and except for Petrie, the big
Viking end who was clown on every
punt, Baggy's lumberjacks were doing
little damage.
Then Washington spurted after Wil
cox had hurled a beautiful pass to
Mertz who ran twenty yards before he
was downed. Hall blocked Cuddebaek's
third attempt at a field goal. Stanford
took a chance with the ball in mid
field by electing to buck the necessary
two yards instead of kicking.
Washington held, and a few minutes
later Bryan, Ziel and Hill had bucked
and passed to Stanford's twelve-yard
line. There Murray, who had relieved
Dennis, and was playing a great game,
cut through and nailed Hill for a
twelve-yard loss. But Ziel stole some
of Cuddebaek's thunder and sailed the
ball over from thirty yards out.
Just at the beginning of the fourth
quarter a Stanford pass was inter
cepted, Hill scampered between center
and guard for sixteen yards. The Vik
ing advance continued until it reached
the five-yard line. There Stanford
three times resisted line bucks, but
on the fourth time Ziel went through
right guard for a score.
That put Stanford behind, and the
Cards responded with a great show of
offensive power. No man ever tried as
conscientiously to keep within the line
as Doughty did when he ran fifty-five
yards to the goal line, but he was
called back. It was a fine piece of
work, with the Stanford men doing
some real clipping. Wilcox drove Ziel
back of his own goal line in a punting
duel. A flock of Stanford subs went in
and were throwing the Vikings back
every time. It became a question of
time whether Stanford's rally would
succeed. It would have, had the Cards
fallen on the ball.
George Baker went in for DeGroot
in the first quarter when the Stanford
skipper twisted his knee. It was
Baker's first football game and he was
scared stiff when he went in. He made
the tackle on his first play, however,
and gained confidence with the result
that he never made a poor pass, and
broke through on several plays.
Paul Murray had his day Saturday.
He was starting fast and got away
for several long runs. Dennis, too, did
some good work in the first half. All of
which indicates that Kerr has some
mighty capable reserves.
"Shorty" Mertz, who has been going
at a good clip, kept up the good work.
He made some nice tackles, and kept
the Vikings away from his end.
While it was hard to have to lose,
things don't look bad for the Big
Game. Enter the Stanford offense, as
shown by that last quarter. If Ket r's
men can go at that rate against the
Eruins, the scribes won't keep refer
ring to them as a team weak on the
offense.
