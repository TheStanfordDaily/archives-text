# WASHINGTON WINS FROM CARDINAL VARSITY, 12-8
## Blocked Kick Near Viking Goal Line Almost Nets Touchdown In Last Minute of the Play 
### Garrett Elmore 
Princeton beat Harvard by following the ball. Stanford, while it followed
the pigskin, failed to fall on it at the right time, and lost to Washington
Saturday, 12 to 8.
For fifty-nine minutes the Cards chased the ball up and down the field,
a la Princeton, never losing track of it. They were still close after it in the
last minute of play when Shipkey blocked Ziel's punt on the Viking's seven
yard line. Two red-jerseyed players reached for the pigskin as it rolled
aimlessly towards Washington's goal line.
But, instead of falling on it, the Cards tried to pick up the moving piece of
leather and carry it over the last line. It got away from them, and little
Dailey, substitute quarter, dove for it. Instead of a touchdown Stanford got

a safety, which proves that there is
many a slip 'twixt the two-yard mark
and the goal line.
It was a great game to watch if you
didn't mind who won. If you were for
Stanford, it was a hafd one to lose,
because that one miscue robbed the
Cards of a well-earned victory.
Bagsliaw's lumberjacks got the first
break in the early minutes when Mike
Hanley, brother of the Hanleys famous
in gridiron history of the Northwest,
recovered a fumble by Wilcox. Line
bucks and a pass, Ziel to Bryan,
brought the pigskin to Stanford's fif
teen-yard mark. The Cardinal line held,
and Ziel booted the ball between the
posts.
Before long Kerr's men got under
'way. Cuddeback fell on the ball when
Abel dropped it after running back
one of Wilcox's punts. Guy Dennis
ripped off eleven yards on a criss-cross
and then Cuddeback got his toe in
action on the fifteen-yard line.
In the middle of the second quarter
Wilcox passed nineteen yards to Den
nis, and a criss-cross in which Wilcox
traveled eight yards put Cuddeback in
