### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 20.â€”Wets lost
no time as Congress convened today in
launching their fight for enactment of a
soldiers' bonus bill, to be paid for by a
tax on legalized beer.
The first bill introduced in the House
was one by Representative John Phillip
Hill, Maryland, Republican, proposing re
enactment of the adjusted compensation
measure killed by Presidential veto last
summer. He suggested a 20-cent per
gallon levy on 2.75 per cent beer and
cider to raise the necessary funds.
Representative Britten, Illinois, Repub
lican, announced lie would introduce a
similar bill.
