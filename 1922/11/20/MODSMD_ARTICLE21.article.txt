# COMING FROM BEHIND
## 
### 
Stanford football enthusiasts today have some
idea what to expect from their team in the Big
Game following the display of offensive and de
fensive strength in the Washington game last
Saturday. The fury of the last few minutes ol
play has had no equal since the rush toward the
California goal in 1919, when football history was
on the verge of being made. The last minute
inarch down the field against Washington did not
end so satisfactorily as might be wished, but ii
proved that Stanford has a stronger attack than
she has been credited with, and further indicates
that if any of the breaks go Stanford's way next
Saturday, the Golden Bear will not find the set-up
for which he has been looking.
The Stanford eleven showed in its last prelimi
nary game the stuff that makes Stanford football
teams. It showed why Stanford has in the past
been able to hold her own with a university with
three times as many students registered. And,
better than all these, it showed the foundation
for a succession of great teams has been built.
The cycle of defeats is slowly giving way to its
natural successor, the cycle of victory. Stanford
cannot long remain the under dog. And if there
is any Stanford man who does not believe this,
he either didn't see the game last Saturday or he
doesn't know football and Stanford.
The Cardinal machine is under way. Whether
victorious in either preliminary or final games
this first season under Coach Kerr and the
M r arner system is not so great a matter of im
portance as a number of victories in the future.
But let no one think that in building for the
future that the present has been neglected.
Otherwise, "Big Game" would not be marked by
capitalization.
