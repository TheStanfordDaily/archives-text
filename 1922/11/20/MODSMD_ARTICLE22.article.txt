# MAKING A JOB FOR CAMP
## 
### 
Eastern football teams are making it tough for
Walter Camp this year by upsetting the dope six
ways from Sunday every week-end. Last season,
the picker of All-Americans and rater of college
football teams was put to a severe test in unrav
eling the gridiron tangle. But now since Prince
ton has beaten Yale and Harvard. Brown has
beaten Harvard, Lafayette has fallen before
Washington and Jefferson, who in turn fell be
fore "Pop" Warner's Pitt Panthers, who lost to
Lafayette, the whole football world is upside
down. Pitt has taken Pennsylvania into camp
and Pennsylvania has taken the measure of Penn
State. At present Pitt is on top of the heap, but
if Penn State beats Warner's proteges on Thanks
giving Day. Walter Camp may as well give up
football for this year and take to philosophy.
And if Harvard beats Yale and Washington and
Jefferson beats West Virginia, he probably will.
