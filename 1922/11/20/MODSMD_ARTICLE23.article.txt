# WOMEN'S RALLY
## 
### 
Women's "S" Socicty has called a rally of all
women students for 4:20 tomorrow afternoon on
the hockey turf back of Rohle Gymnasium. This
rally is in preparation for the contests with the
University of California Saturday morning, when
the four class teams will meet the corresponding
squads from Berkeley. The women song leaders
will be on hand td lead the singing and a practice
game between the senior and sophomore elevens
will be played during the rally. The women may
show how much Stanford spirit they possess by
turning out en masse to support their teams.
This is the first time in the memory of the
present generation of students that Women's "S '
Society has done anything more important than
elect new members at the end of each year. Call

ing tomorrow's rally is their first step in the di
rection of a new policy, by which they hope to
become a guiding factor in women's sports and
to hold the position in this field that Skull and
Snakes and Circle "S" Society holds for men's
athletics.
