Hepsibah
Hepsibah has eyes that are auburn-tinted limpid pools
of mystery. She has long, silky, brown hair, with just
a hint of red in it, that glints in the sunlight as its
tresses sway with her graceful walk. She has a swinging,
carefree gait that speaks of long tramps over pleasant
green hills and o fa spirit that could never be happy
indoors. Hepsibah has a mildly reproachful way of
looking at you when her feelings are hurt that would
melt the heart of an executioner.
Yessir, Hepsibah is a mighty fine cow, and the best
Jersey in the county.

Hepsibah
Hepsibah has eyes that are auburn-tinted limpid pools
of mystery. She has long, silky, brown hair, with just
a hint of red in it, that glints in the sunlight as its
tresses sway with her graceful walk. She has a swinging,
carefree gait that speaks of long tramps over pleasant
green hills and o fa spirit that could never be happy
indoors. Hepsibah has a mildly reproachful way of
looking at you when her feelings are hurt that would
melt the heart of an executioner.
Yessir, Hepsibah is a mighty fine cow, and the best
