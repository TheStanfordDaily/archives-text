California 61, Nevada 13
The California Bears tore through
the Nevada Wolves for a 61 to 13 vic
tory Saturday. The California team
had things all its own way in the first
period when it crossed the line three
times. It continued its onslaught in
the first of the second period for two
more. Suddenly showing a fast offens
ive the Wolves slipped two touch
downs over on the Blue and Gold
squad. During the third period Cali
fornia found the Nevada eleven a
little harder to score on. Andy Smith
started his entire first team, but re
placed them in the second quarter
with second string men. He returned
the regulars in the final frame.
Southern California 14, Idaho 0
Southern California defeated the
University of Idaho eleven 14 to 0,
mainly as a result of forward passes.
The Trojan backfield made substantial
gains around the Vandals' ends and
off tackle, but the Idaho line did not
yield for the Trojans. On several oc
casions the Vandals had the ball on
the U. S. C. five-yard line only to have
the Trojans offer a stone-wall defense.
The Vandal attack was very threaten
ing in the last period. Galloway
starred for the winners, running the
team, throwing passes, and doing the
punting. Anderson and Dolly, Trojan
regulars, did not play.
Pittsburgh 19, Washington & Jeff. 0
Glenn Warner's Pittsburgh Panthers
showed their true power by defeating
the Washington and Jefferson 19 to 0.
The W. & J. eleven has not been de
feated in three years and has been
recognized as one of the strongest
teams in the country. They were out
played, out-generaled and out-kicked.
W. & J. was sent off its feet in the
first few minutes of play and with the
exception of a spectacular forward
pass rally in the latter part of the
second period, the Presidents were
usually fighting within the shadow of
their goal. Pittsburgh made 14 first
downs to five for the W. & J. team.
Oregon "U" 10, Oregon Aggies 0
The Universtiy of Oregon triumped
over the Oregon Aggie eleven by a
10-to-0 score in their annual contest.
The winners made their points early
in the first period. The Aggie eleven
stiffened its defense, but did not pos
sess sufficient driving power to re
taliate. The battle was an even affair
after the first quarter.
