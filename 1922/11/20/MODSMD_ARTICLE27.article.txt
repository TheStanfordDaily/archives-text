# Stanford Guarantees Part Costs to Colorado Team
## 
### 
Major Collins has written the Colo
rado Agricultural College guarantee
ing $200 of their expenses to bring
their polo team here during the Christ

mas holidays. It is thought that this
amount will be sufficient to pay half
the cost.
The three teams from the Stanford
R. O. T. C., the Reds, the Whites, and
the Blues, will play on the field by
the highway at 10 o'clock Saturday
morning. Machines stopping on the
highway to watch the games have
been so numerous as to obstruct the
traffic, and it may be necessary to
fence that part of the field near the
highway.
