# DeGroot's Knee Badly Injured; Cannot Start At Center in Big Game
## 
### 
When the Cardinal Varsity lines up
against the Blue and Gold in the Big
Game, Dud DeGroot, captain and cen
ter, will be on the bench.
His knee was injured so badly Satur
day when he was clipped by a Washing
ton man that he is out of the game for
several weeks. Baker went in for him
near the end of the first quarter.
DeGroot's bulk and experience is need
ed in the middle of the line, but Baker
came through in fine shape against the
Vikings.
Kerr will work Faville at center this
week, and it may be that the guard will
start the Big Game instead of Baker.
I'aville played center at the first of the
1921 season.
