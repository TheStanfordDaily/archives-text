# Mix-Up in Final Dates Causes Postponement of Card-Bruin Game
## 
### 
Owing to a misunderstanding in the
University and Club League, Stanford's
freshman soccer eleven did not play the
game with the California Babes sched
uled for last Saturday.
Some way, in the making of the sched
ule of the second division of the league,
Stanford was led to believe that the
freshmen game was to be played a week
before the varsity game, on November
25. California received the impression
that both the freshmen and varsity teams
would play at Stanford the morning of
the football game.
Coach Harry Maloney agreed to play
the game next Saturday at 9 o'clock.
The freshmen were in top form for
the California Cubs last Saturday. They
had just completed a two weeks' inten
sive training period against the varsity.
Coach Maloney will scrimmage them
every night for the coming week against
the varsity.
