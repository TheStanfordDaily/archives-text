## 
### 
Members of the freshmen class will
entertain the football team which
represented them through the season
with a banquet at 7:30 tomorrow night
in the main dining hall of the Stanford
Union. Dean Culver and Coach
"Husky" Hunt will be among the
speakers.
"This banquet is an expression of
the appreciation of the class to the
freshman team for the work it has
done through the season which has
just been completed," says Raymond
Kay, class president. For this reason a
good representation of the class is
expected.
Tickets are now on sale and may
be purchased from any officer of the
class.
