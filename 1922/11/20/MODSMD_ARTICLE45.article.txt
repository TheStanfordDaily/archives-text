# Ken Nef, Senior Backfield Ace, Injured in Practice
## 
### 
Injuries to two of Glenn Pollard's
star players will seriously weaken the
senior team in its game with the sopho
mores for the intcr-class football cham
pionship Saturday morning. Ken Nef,
the most able man in the '23 backfield,
tore his hand in scrimmage and wiil
probably be out of the game. Peterson,
who at center is one of the mainstays
of the line, is also out of the game with
an injury.
The seniors have been holding serins
mages with the frosh this week, and
judging from their showing they are in
for a hard Saturday morning. The
frosh, losers to the sophs, went right
through the husky Sombreros and com
pletely dominated the play.
