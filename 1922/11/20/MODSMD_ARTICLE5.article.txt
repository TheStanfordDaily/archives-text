# LOONG FAT MAGIC PERFORMANCE IS WELL PRESENTED
## Oriental Wizards Have Large Repertoire of Tricks; Song And Dance Act Is Pleasing 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
It is a rare pleasure for theater
goers to be permitted to wintess some
performance different from the ordin
ary run. Last Saturday night in the
Assembly hall, Loong Fat filled such
a need. The diversified program which
included magic, music, dancing, and
boxing, was well received by the
crowd.
The select 300 present went away
feeling well pleased at the ingenious
two hours of entertainment given
them.
Few Breaks in Performance
The production was not altogether
without flaws —to expect a perfect
magic performance from amateurs is
aiming a little too high. In spite of a
few awkward illusions, unnecessary
stage pauses, and mutterings which
could not be understood, however, the
performance was appreciated. Much
credit is due Hock How, '25, and C. H.
Lee, '23, its producers. Presented for
the benefit of the Second Million, it
demonstrated that the Chinese stu
dents are awake to the possibilities
which Stanford as a university has to
offer them.
The fairly good chatter which ac
companied How's and Lee's acts made
them interesting. The repertoire
proved to be unusually large. Such old
standbys as the pouring of a goulash
mixture into a borrowed hat, and the
waving of an American flag which
never fails to bring down a house,
were well presented.
Coffee Pumped From Elbow
Among the more novel stunts was
How's transformation of three goblets
of confetti into milk, coffee, and candy.
A young man called from the audience
was much embarrassed when the wiz
ard placed a funnel at his elbow, and
working the other appendage as a
pump, forced coffee out through the
spout.
In another illusion, several little
chicks which later proved to be the
result of a chop-suey concoction, were
distinctly heard peeping before they
were supposed to.
Chinese Dancers Make Hit
"Cute" is a hackneyed and stereo
typed word, but it best expresses the
singing and dancing of Nellie Leong
and Annie Chan, two little Chinese
girls from San Francisco. Sweet,
dainty, and clothed in beautiful Ori
ental raiment, the two girls received
one of the largest applauses of the
evening. It is unfortunate that more
of this type of entertainment was not
given.
A super-abundance of Chinese music
which is always difficult for the Amer
ican ear to sympathize with, is prob
ably the main criticism which can be
passed against Loong Fat. When an
audience centers its attention on its
program rather than on the stage, it
is a good sign that it is not overly
interested. Due credit, however, must
be given S. F. Lee, T. S. Wong, and
the Misses Chang and Chien of
Berkeley.
Girl Displays Oriental Boxing
With a quick manipulation of the
feet, a complicated punch with the

hands, and an intricate side-step, Nah
Chan, an 18-year-old Chiuese girl,
gave an excellent illustration of the
technique of Oriental boxing.
Appropriate Chinese atmosphere was
given the performance by rich, multi
colored tapestries which hung in the
background of the stage. The raiment
worn by How and Lee was particularly
effective.
C. W. Midgley and the University
orchestra assisted in the production.

feet, a complicated punch with the

hands, and an intricate side-step, Nah
Chan, an 18-year-old Chiuese girl,
gave an excellent illustration of the
technique of Oriental boxing.
Appropriate Chinese atmosphere was
given the performance by rich, multi
colored tapestries which hung in the
background of the stage. The raiment
worn by How and Lee was particularly
effective.
C. W. Midgley and the University
orchestra assisted in the production.
It is a rare pleasure for theater
goers to be permitted to wintess some
performance different from the ordin
ary run. Last Saturday night in the
Assembly hall, Loong Fat filled such
a need. The diversified program which
included magic, music, dancing, and
boxing, was well received by the
crowd.
The select 300 present went away
feeling well pleased at the ingenious
two hours of entertainment given
them.
Few Breaks in Performance
The production was not altogether
without flaws —to expect a perfect
magic performance from amateurs is
aiming a little too high. In spite of a
few awkward illusions, unnecessary
stage pauses, and mutterings which
could not be understood, however, the
performance was appreciated. Much
credit is due Hock How, '25, and C. H.
Lee, '23, its producers. Presented for
the benefit of the Second Million, it
demonstrated that the Chinese stu
dents are awake to the possibilities
which Stanford as a university has to
offer them.
The fairly good chatter which ac
companied How's and Lee's acts made
them interesting. The repertoire
proved to be unusually large. Such old
standbys as the pouring of a goulash
mixture into a borrowed hat, and the
waving of an American flag which
never fails to bring down a house,
were well presented.
Coffee Pumped From Elbow
Among the more novel stunts was
How's transformation of three goblets
of confetti into milk, coffee, and candy.
A young man called from the audience
was much embarrassed when the wiz
ard placed a funnel at his elbow, and
working the other appendage as a
pump, forced coffee out through the
spout.
In another illusion, several little
chicks which later proved to be the
result of a chop-suey concoction, were
distinctly heard peeping before they
were supposed to.
Chinese Dancers Make Hit
"Cute" is a hackneyed and stereo
typed word, but it best expresses the
singing and dancing of Nellie Leong
and Annie Chan, two little Chinese
girls from San Francisco. Sweet,
dainty, and clothed in beautiful Ori
ental raiment, the two girls received
one of the largest applauses of the
evening. It is unfortunate that more
of this type of entertainment was not
given.
A super-abundance of Chinese music
which is always difficult for the Amer
ican ear to sympathize with, is prob
ably the main criticism which can be
passed against Loong Fat. When an
audience centers its attention on its
program rather than on the stage, it
is a good sign that it is not overly
interested. Due credit, however, must
be given S. F. Lee, T. S. Wong, and
the Misses Chang and Chien of
Berkeley.
Girl Displays Oriental Boxing

feet, a complicated punch with the

hands, and an intricate side-step, Nah
Chan, an 18-year-old Chiuese girl,
gave an excellent illustration of the
