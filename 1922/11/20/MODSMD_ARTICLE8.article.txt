# New Sprint Find Runs Furlong in Near-Record Time

Either "Dink" Templeton is trying
to "spoof" the public by timing his
athletes by the proverbial alarm clock,
or we have with us Mr. Marshall Hale,
'24, future intercollegiate sprint cham
pion. Hale romped off with both
sprints in the first full-distance track
meet of the fall season Friday after
noon, in which he was officially cred
ited with 10 seconds flat in the 100-
yard dash and 21 4-5 seconds in the
220.
Considering the fact that Hale was
virtually unknown on the track last
year, also the early season, critics are
inclined to doubt these two perform

fastest sprinter in school, only did 10
flat once in his life and never ap
proached 21 4-5 in the furlong. This
latter time equals that of Eddie Sud
den, former national junior champion.
Until Charley Paddock rattled off the
220 In 20 4-5 seconds, the world's rec
ord was 21 1-5 seconds and few men
could approach that mark.
Hale's performances will be watched
with interest in the future, as will the
performnace of Coach Templeton's
time clocks.
The marks hung up Friday were
very good for this early in the season.
