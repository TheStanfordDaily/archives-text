## PRESIDENT BRINGS SHIP SUBSIDY TO CONGRESS 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21.—President
Harding brought his ship subsidy to
Congress in person today.
With a prepared message elucidating
his ideas on the establishment of a gov
ernment subsidy under the United States
Shipping Board to promote the American
Merchant Marine, the chief executive
was to appear before a joint session of
Congress at 12:30 o'clock.
The President's advocacy of ship sub
sidy in the face of strong opposition in
Congress will constitute a real test of
his leadership.
The message will:
I—Urge Congress to the great speed
in passage of the shipping measure al
ready before the House.
2—Suggest minor changes in his origi
nal plan as outlined in his last special
message to Congress.
The personal appearance of the Presi
dent is designed to arouse supporters of
the administration measure to greater
activity in its behalf. Witli this new
impetus, it is expected that no successful
opposition can be stirred up against the
measure in the House.
