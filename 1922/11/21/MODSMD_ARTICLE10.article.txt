# Lively Spirits Will Frolic in Play of the “Three Live Ghosts”
## 
### 
There are spirits and spirits, as is
amply demonstrated in "Three Live
Ghosts," the sophomore play to be given
December 9. As past-master of the art,
Mrs. Gubbins, "Old Sweetheart," to be
played by Evelyn Van Horn, shows con
siderable ability in communicating with
all varieties of spirits, from those that
range in ( the outer-world to those repos
ing on the cupboard shelf. How Mrs.
Gubbins and her friend Peggy Woofers,
to be played by Dorothy Dahler, had a
spirited time of it while the former's
step-son, Jimmie, taken by Harold Min
sky, was away at the war, is one of the
many light comedy touches which char
acterizes this three-act play.
The setting is in England during the

period of the World War. The atmos
phere of the cockney Englishman is kept
up throughout the play. The peculiar
characteristics of London's east-end
dwellers arc brought out in a fashion
whifch offers opportunities for laughter
and thrills side by side.
"Three Live Ghosts" will thus be the
first play produced on the campus which
has as its main background the last war.
Ancient times with their peculiar cos
tumes and old-time plots are supplanted
in this case with a modern up-to-the
minute dramatization of the joys and
woes which elated and depressed in turn
one of the peoples who bore the heaviest
brunt of the fighting.
