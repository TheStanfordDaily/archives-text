# Football Frothies Acquiring Polish For Final Night
## 
### 
On the last week of its "training
period," the Rani's Head Football
Show is acquiring the finishing polish
necessary to put it over successfully
next Saturday night. At the close of
last week the final co-ordinations of
various parts of the "Frothies" was
secured and constant practice this
week will finish out the job of which
Directors Hollis Chalmers, Arnold
Bayley and Sam Mendenhall are in
charge.
Purely local comedy has in the past
been attended with success when it
appeared, although lately there has
been a strong tendency away from this
type of show. The "Frothies," however,
bring back the local element strongly,
blended with generalizations enough
to make it interesting for every one.
Satirical sketches of campus incidents
furnish the framework on which the
songs, action and lines are hung.
The plot is not so complicated that
an easy-going audience could not grasp
it. What plot there is lies in the ad
ventures of a young man who comes
to Stanford and has a rather difficult
time making up his mind as to what
department to major in. How he finally
decides to "major in love," is offered
by some as a solution for the problem
confronting the lower division student
as his junior year approaches. As in
all the most successful musical shows,
the plot is not allowed to become com
plicated enough to make the evening
at all heavy. It is rather a thread of
unity which runs through the show
and hitches up the varied specialty
numbers into a cohesive whole.
