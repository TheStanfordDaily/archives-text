# Big Game Programs Will Have Thirty-Two Pages; No Advertising Included
## 
### 
Big Game programs this year will be
the largest and most unique ever printed,
according to Vic Smith who has charge
of them.
They will contain thirty-two pages and
will have no advertising in them. Pic
tures of the California and Stanford
teams, coaches, and individual players
will occupy a great deal of the space.
Everything printed in the programs will
pertain directly to the game and the two
teams.
Smith has a corps of 110 men and
boys who will sell the programs at the
Stadium Saturday. The price will be
twenty-five cents.
