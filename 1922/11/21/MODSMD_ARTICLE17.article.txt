# INTERCLASS HOOP SEASON IS BEGUN BY DIRECTOR DAVIS
## Practice Will Begin at Once; First Round to Be Played After Thanksgiving Days 
### 
Interclass basketball started last night
when sixty-five candidates attended a
meeting called by Director of Intramural
Athletics Davis in the Old Union.
Practice will begin at once and the in
itial round of play is scheduled for the
first Tuesday following the Thanksgiving
vacation.
The schedule will run through two
weeks and will close about December
15. Then will come intramural court play
and intensive work by the varsity and
freshman fives.
"I want to see you go through with
this and get something out of it," said
Dr. Barrow at the meeting. "If you have
not made the varsity, here is your
chances to show what you can do. Inter
class players who show ability will stand
a chance of being promoted to the
varsity.
"Next to representing the university in
intercollegiate athletics is the honor of
representing your class. It is the big
best honor you can win. other than that
of making the varsity "S." Keep clique
and group relationships or politics out
of it. Make it a class affair and things
will run smoothly."
Coach Andy Kerr said that he would
be on hand to witness the games.
Coach "Husky" Hunt said that the
first year team will be chosen largely
from the men who make good in inter
class competition. No regular freshman
practice will be held until after the close
of the interclass schedule, and so the
best players in the '26 class will be in
the interclass schedule.
Classes to Have Two Teams
Final arrangements have not been
made, but it has been definitely settled
that each class will have two teams.
The first team is to be composed of the
best players and will play a schedule of
its own. The second team will play an
independent schedule also, and so there
will be two championships.
Members of the first team will not be
allowed to play on the second, even
though they may be first team substitutes.
However, second team men of ability may
be moved up to the first squad at the dis
cretion of tbe coaches. Upon doing
this, they forfeit their right to play with
the second team.
Each team will play each other team in
its own division once. Thus, each quin
tet will play three games.
It is proposed to play the games on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
evenings about 7:30. The second team
of each class will play on the same
night that the first squad plays.

The first team is to be composed of the
best players and will play a schedule of
its own. The second team will play an
independent schedule also, and so there
will be two championships.
Members of the first team will not be
allowed to play on the second, even
though they may be first team substitutes.
However, second team men of ability may
be moved up to the first squad at the dis
cretion of tbe coaches. Upon doing
this, they forfeit their right to play with
the second team.
Each team will play each other team in
its own division once. Thus, each quin
tet will play three games.
It is proposed to play the games on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
evenings about 7:30. The second team
of each class will play on the same
night that the first squad plays.
Thirty-Eight Freshmen Report
Albert F. Schneidecker, manager of
the freshmen, announced that thir.'y
eiglit candidates turned out last night.
He expects more out later. Glenn Pollard,
who coached the seniors to a football
championship, is organizing his class in
basketball. Candidates for the junior five
were requested to meet Coach Granger
in the Encina pavilion at 4:30 this after
noon. The sophomores have not as yet
organized.
Davis announces an extensive intra
mural athletic program for the rest of
the year. Each sport will be taken up
in season, basketball occupying the center
of attention at present. Inter-class track
and baseball will come later.
Interclass basketball started last night
when sixty-five candidates attended a
meeting called by Director of Intramural
Athletics Davis in the Old Union.
Practice will begin at once and the in
itial round of play is scheduled for the
first Tuesday following the Thanksgiving
vacation.
The schedule will run through two
weeks and will close about December
15. Then will come intramural court play
and intensive work by the varsity and
freshman fives.
"I want to see you go through with
this and get something out of it," said
Dr. Barrow at the meeting. "If you have
not made the varsity, here is your
chances to show what you can do. Inter
class players who show ability will stand
a chance of being promoted to the
varsity.
"Next to representing the university in
intercollegiate athletics is the honor of
representing your class. It is the big
best honor you can win. other than that
of making the varsity "S." Keep clique
and group relationships or politics out
of it. Make it a class affair and things
will run smoothly."
Coach Andy Kerr said that he would
be on hand to witness the games.
Coach "Husky" Hunt said that the
first year team will be chosen largely
from the men who make good in inter
class competition. No regular freshman
practice will be held until after the close
of the interclass schedule, and so the
best players in the '26 class will be in
the interclass schedule.
Classes to Have Two Teams
Final arrangements have not been
made, but it has been definitely settled
that each class will have two teams.
The first team is to be composed of the
best players and will play a schedule of
its own. The second team will play an
independent schedule also, and so there
will be two championships.
Members of the first team will not be
