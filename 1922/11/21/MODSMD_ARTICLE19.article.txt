# THE 						CAMPUS CAR ISSUES
## 
### 
Such editorials as have been run in these col
umns on the automobile question have not been
written for the purpose of bringing the argument
down to personal issues. No editorials have been
written to antagonize. None have been included
in the series that represent the editor's personal
feelings as such. The purpose of this campaign
has been to bring out the arguments on both sides
in order that the real issues may be defined and
understood by all concerned.
It has not been the purpose of the editor to
point out the good and baa points so far as cars
are concerned for any or all individual car
owners. It is not a matter of individual tastes
and welfare, but a matter of effect on the Uni
versity as a whole. What may be good for the
individual may be bad for Stanford, and if such
is the case, then the individual should regulate
his actions and desires accordingly.
Such opinions as have come to the Daily from
the student body were based on comparative
good and bad uses of student-owned cars. Let
us not classify the uses, but instead classify
the drivers on whom the uses of the cars depend.
Whether to retain or to do away with the auto
mobile at Stanford depends largely upon the
students who own cars and upon the friends who
influence car owners.
The largest class is comprised of wealthy stu
dents, who keep cars as a luxury. The majority
of these are young, free from the rules of their
homes, often used to getting by without much
work, and as a general rule, irresponsible. They
are no different from other people in this respect,
except that they have transporation at their dis
posal at all hours and are thus given more oppor
tunities to leave the campus. If they had no cars,
the extra trouble entailed in getting away might
keep at their work or out for an activity.
They are thus really at a disadvantage from the
standpoint of academic and student body affairs.
The second class is comprised of upperclass
and graduate students who are using their cars
in business or in academic work off the campus,
are living elsewhere, or else are far enough re
moved from Stanford atmosphere to exclude them
from the present issues. There is no fault to be
found with student ownership of cars when the
owners are matured in judgment or are essen
tially scholars. The fact that they own cars af
fects neither themselves as individuals nor the
student body as a whole. Were all student car
owners included in this class, there would be no
problem serious enough to warrant the exclusion
of the automobile from Stanford.
There is a third and very much smaller class
comprised of students of ordinary means who
pay their car expenses by doing outside work.
The chief objtction to this class is the fact that
by the time students have earned enough to pay
for gas, oil, and repairs, they want recreation,
and take it at the expense of scholarship. and
student affairs, to which they might well give a
little time and thought.
What the Automobile Does
First, the very presence of the student-owned
car on the campus creates social distinctions
which heretofore did not exist. Tht rich man's
son cannot be picked out from the poor man's
son at Stanford unless the car enters. This di
vision of classes cannot be reconciled with a
united student body.
Second, student-owned cars used for all of the
several harmful porposes do not have this harm
ful effect on the owners only, but upon as many

other students as the cars can hold. Every
car owner is assured of at least as many friends
as can pile on, regardless of the destination. And
as a general rule, cars used for academic and
business purposes are seldom so heavily loaded
as when a good time is in view.
Third, no student can really become a part o£
Stanford if he spends his spare time, and some
that he cannot spare, off the campus. His studies
and his campus associations are neglected. Often
those who are most guilty do not know what they
are missing. They have never tried to get into
anything—never tried out for any activity, ath
letic or otherwise. They are merely going to
Stanford and will newer know what they have
missed until they have graduated or dropped out.
There is no good reason why the burden of stu
dent life and activity should rest on some fifty
people, as it does.
In brief, the automobile is said to save tin.e,
but that is refuted by the fact that it can also
be used to waste it. It is a convenience, but dis
tances 011 the campus are not so great as to make
a car necessary. At least the majority of the
students have been able to do without one. It
has been said to be an aid to student activities.
It is with some difficulty that a student who at
the same time takes any active part in under
graduate affairs and drives a car may be found.
There are, of course, a few exceptions.
The chief argument in favor of retaining the
car is that it does no harm. This has rather
negative value at best. An attempt has been
made to disprove this statement.
These are a few of the facts. What can be
done? Should anything be done? How would
it be to restrict the use of cars to upperclassmen
only? Has the attack on automobiles been
oi-used by irresponsible action of a few? What
to do and how to do it is the question before the
students. The issues have been defined.
