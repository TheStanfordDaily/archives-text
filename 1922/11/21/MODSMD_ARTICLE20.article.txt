# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M.24
## 
### 
Having received a cut in the festive eight o'clock, we
feel more able to bit up and take notice of what is
passing about us. The first thing we perceive is that
the guy next to us is passing a whole lot more than we
are; he's gettiny the A's and leaviny us the D's. Which
reminds us of the one about the street car motorman
who passed up three guys on the street corner with the
remark, "That's passing fare!"

Cabbages wishes to suggest some new characters for
the campus comedians for Rough's Day. For years the
Old Clothes Man, the Female Impersonator, the Fat Man
and the Fiji Islander have flitted about trying to find a
camera to wander about in front of accidentally.

It is rumored that the most novel costume will repre
sent Adam. The character will be dressed in golf
panties. The full name of the character is Adam Fool.
* * *
The Female Impersonator is always a novel thing. He
will come attired in a short skirt, a wig, and a tremolo
falsetto voice, and will enliven all the spectators by
making love to all the men. The finishing touches are
added when the affected walk and powder puff are
displayed. They were well finished about three years
after Rough's Day began. Since then they have merely
been revived.

Reggie the Rough was wandering through the camp
of the enemy Sunday, and he came back with the infor
mation that the enemy does not think much of the old
fighting spirit. tSo he dashed off the following to prove
that the Bears are walking into a trap Saturday:
We're the team that wears the Card'nal on the field
If you want to die with terror, look at us.
We're chain lightning, with a 30 ampere yield,
We're the snorters of the boundless western coast.
CHORUS:
We are killers, we are haters,
We're the great annihilators,
We're the terrors of the boundless western coast.
We're the double-jawed hyenas; west or east;
We're the bloody blazing blizzards of the States.
We're the celebrated sluggers, we're the beasts,
That can snatch a team bald-headed while it waits.
CHORUS:
We're a snorter and a snoozer,
We're the great trunk-line abuser,
We can snatch a team bald-headed while it waits!
* * *
The Latin class was struggling along waiting for the
class dumbell to translate "Rex fugit." Finally he
drawled out, "The King flees."
"In what other tense can 'fugit' be conjugated?"
asked the teacher.
'■Dunno."
"Why, put a has in it."
Agani came the drawling voice, "The king has fleas."

mation that the enemy does not think much of the old
fighting spirit. tSo he dashed off the following to prove
that the Bears are walking into a trap Saturday:
We're the team that wears the Card'nal on the field
If you want to die with terror, look at us.
We're chain lightning, with a 30 ampere yield,
We're the snorters of the boundless western coast.
CHORUS:
We are killers, we are haters,
We're the great annihilators,
We're the terrors of the boundless western coast.
We're the double-jawed hyenas; west or east;
We're the bloody blazing blizzards of the States.
We're the celebrated sluggers, we're the beasts,
That can snatch a team bald-headed while it waits.
CHORUS:
We're a snorter and a snoozer,
We're the great trunk-line abuser,
We can snatch a team bald-headed while it waits!

The Latin class was struggling along waiting for the
class dumbell to translate "Rex fugit." Finally he
drawled out, "The King flees."
"In what other tense can 'fugit' be conjugated?"
asked the teacher.
'■Dunno."
"Why, put a has in it."
Agani came the drawling voice, "The king has fleas."
Having received a cut in the festive eight o'clock, we
feel more able to bit up and take notice of what is
passing about us. The first thing we perceive is that
the guy next to us is passing a whole lot more than we
are; he's gettiny the A's and leaviny us the D's. Which
reminds us of the one about the street car motorman
who passed up three guys on the street corner with the
remark, "That's passing fare!"

Cabbages wishes to suggest some new characters for
the campus comedians for Rough's Day. For years the
Old Clothes Man, the Female Impersonator, the Fat Man
and the Fiji Islander have flitted about trying to find a
camera to wander about in front of accidentally.

It is rumored that the most novel costume will repre
sent Adam. The character will be dressed in golf
panties. The full name of the character is Adam Fool.

The Female Impersonator is always a novel thing. He
will come attired in a short skirt, a wig, and a tremolo
falsetto voice, and will enliven all the spectators by
making love to all the men. The finishing touches are
added when the affected walk and powder puff are
displayed. They were well finished about three years
after Rough's Day began. Since then they have merely
been revived.
