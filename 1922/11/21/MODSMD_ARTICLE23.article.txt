# WORESâ€™ COLLECTION IS SHOWN IN ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A large collection of oil paintings by
Theodore Wores, a California artist, is
now being shown at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
This group of pictures represents
twenty years o|f ,the artist's work
which accounts for the variety of sub
jects, which range from scenes of
blossom vistas at Saratoga to Japan
ese, Hawaiian, and Spanish landscapes
and portraits.
Wores says that the decided atmos
pheric effect of his outdoor scenes is
the result of his habit of always
painting from life in the open and not
in the studio. His portraits have a
life-like expression, the most notable
one being a likness of Edwin Mark
ham, the poet.
"The Hunting Ground of the Past,"
showing an Indian standing on a low
hill and gazing with surprise at a
city below him, which has grown up
since he last hunted there ten years
before, is a striking example of the
artist's method. The Indian depicted
actually had that experience in Can
ada.
This group of paintings will be on
exhibition, until November 26. The
Art Gallery is open every day, includ
ing Sunday, from 10 a. m. to 5 p. m.
