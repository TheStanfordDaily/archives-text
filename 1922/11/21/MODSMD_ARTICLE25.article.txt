# BIG GAME ISSUE OF CHAPPIE OUT FRIDAY
## 
### 
"Every successive year the Big Game
issue of Chappie outstrips its predeces
sors. Hammer and Coffin will uphold
the tradition this year and will present
one of the best Chaparrals of its ca
reer." So declared the Old Boy yester
day when he announced that his Big
Game issue would be on sale Friday.
The new Chappie will be several pages
larger than heretofore. Many distinctive
and original drawings will appear, in
cluding a full page from the pen of
James Swinnerton, in which he takes his
comic supplement character. "Little
Jimmie" to the big gridiron classic of
the West.
