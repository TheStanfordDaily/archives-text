# WRANGLERS DEFEAT EUPHRONIA IN DEBATE ON JUNIOR COLLEGES
## 
### 
Wranglers won the decision by a vote
of 16 to 13 over Euphronia in a hotly
contested debate held last evening in the
Women's Clubhouse. The proposition
was: Resolved, That transfers from
junior colleges should be prohibited from
entering Stanford.
Sidney Hawkins, '24, the first speaker
for Wranglers on the affirmative, de
clared that such transfers do not parti
pate in student activities and should
therefore not be given entrance to Stan
ford.
"If transfers from other universities
are allowed to register here, while those
from junior colleges are banned, then
it is unfair to the latter," said Harold
Fendler, '22, Euphronia's first speaker.
Linda Van Norden, '23, thought that
the hostile attitude against the transfer
such as exists at Stanford should not be
allowed to continue.
"We are not convinced that these
transfers are entirely lacking in Stanford
spirit," contended Bert Levitt, '24.
Elsa Barber, '25, claimed that the
standards set by junior colleges are
lower than those of universities, so that
students from the former are not fully
equipped.
Joe Mandl, '22, in refuting her argu
ment, contended that the graduates from
junior colleges receive instruction from
capable teachers, and meet the require
ments of a full-fledged university just
as well as do transfers from other um
\ersiiies.
