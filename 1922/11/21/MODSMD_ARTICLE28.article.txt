# “He Who Would Get the Kernel Must First Crack the Shell”
## WHO’S WHO AND WHY IN PALO ALTO 
### 
(1) Think of the countless obstacles
the pioneers of old had to overcome
as they journeyed forth to lay the
foundation for a future that might
hold some promise' for them. Some
achieved their goal, others failed. Then
consider your own environment and
chances for the future. Your lot is a
path of roses compared with that of
tho pioneers. jfist lay aside a small
amount each week and start an ac
count with the First National Bank of
Palo Alto. They have a capital of
$100,000.00, and $24,000 surplus, and
are members of the Federal Reserve
System of Banking. The officers and
everyone connected with this bank
have always practiced service and
courtesy to their patrons. You are
treated with consideration whether
you are a large or small depositor or
whether you are a temporary visitor in
this favored locality. A man putting
his money in a bank should always
make sure that the institution is finan
cially solid and this is just such a
bank. They pay 4 per cent interest on
Term Deposits. Name the directors of
this banking institution. What is the
margin of security including stock
holders' liability?

(2) In purchasing jewelry, the buyer
puts more faith in the seller than any
other commodity that men buy and
sell. This article is about a jewelry
store that has been in business in
Palo Alto for a number of years, and
their reputation for being dependable
is second to none. In addition to their
exceptional stock of watches, jewelry,
rings, SILVERWARE, cut glass, etc.,
they do expert watch and jewelry re
pairing. This is the store to select your
•"Gifts That Last." Nielsen and Culver
are the kind of fellows we like to men
tion in our columns, because they have
a sociable and intelligent personality
—ones who know how to make friends
and keep them. Go see this store and
look over their high class line of jew
elry and you are sure to make all of
your purchases in this line from them.
Every article they sell not only bears
the guarantee of the manufacturers,
but their personal guarantee goes with
it as well. If you have a broken piece
of jewelry, no matter how fine it is,
they will repair it for you. What are
Mr. Culver'? initials, and where is
their store located. Also what other
department do they conduct? What is
their leading line of Silverware?

(3) It ticV les everybody's vanity to
a certain dc pre e to have his friends
say how we ! his homo is furnished,
and perhaps many of these friends se
cretly wish they knew where they
could buy furniture of equal looks.
There is no secret of obtaining the
right kind cf furniture if one knows
the place to shop. The Palo Alto Fur
niture Company is such a place. They
not only hf nd!e high-class furniture
for the parlor, bofl-roora and dining
room, but their kitchen department is
well stocked with ranges and
utensils and for the floor they have
Linoleum of the latest designs and
patterns. It is easily cleaned and al-

ways sanitary. Just go to this store !
once and let them show you their col
lection of home furnishings. They are
sure to suit your individual taste, no
matter how exacting. They are featur
ing a complete line of stoves and
ranges. The best in the world is
Wedgewood. Where is this large fur
niture store located? and what make
of water heaters do, they recommend?
How many square feet of Inlaid Lin
oleum are they now laying in the Rus
sel Cafeteria?

(4) No matter who you are and what
your life is, it can be made happier
and better through the influence of
music. This up-to-date store that we
are writing about is the home of the
best there is in music, and they are
representatives for Brunswick and
Columbia phonographs. The Music
Shop at 273 University Avenue is the
music house of Palo Alto, for they not
only carry and sell phonographs and
pianos, but they carry all kinds of
musical instruments, sheet music,
player rolls and records. If you are
fond of string instruments, they have
anything from the ukelele to the cello.
They are exclusive representatives in
Palo Alto for two well-known phono
graphs which are recognized for their ;
many exceptional qualities. These ma
chines play disc records of any make.
If you like a lot of noise moulded into
music, then they have drums for your
choice. The proprietor here is a music
loving man, himself, and he delights in
showing his line to patrons. A visit
from you will be appreciated. What
make of Band Instruments does he
carry? Who are the manufacturers of
the Victor and Brunswick? What is
the price of the Gretsch Sac., Melody
C, Finish No. 2?

(5) Two of the best places to eat in j
Palo Alto are home and here. That is
what the editor thought after trying
one of this restaurant home-cooked
meals. All of you people do not know
of this restaurant or you would be
Johnny on the spot every time Old
Man Hunger gripped your frame. They
not only cater to the man who is in a
hurry with counter service but they
have linen-covered tables for the
ladies. However, the same service is
had at both places and at the same
prices. If you have lots of time to sit
and enjoy your meal, then sit at the
tables, but if you are a business man
with only a few minutes to "grab"
your lunch, the counter service will be
most ideal. The location of this home
like place is 105 Alma Street. The
proprietor of this restaurant has a
most affable manner and he does all
in his power to please his patrons.;
Anything that you want is not too
much trouble for him to get. He uses
the best grade of meats and come
fresh from the meat market when he
needs them and not a week before, j
Who is the energetic proprietor of the
"Popular" restaurant? What is the
price of their noon lunch? What brand
of coffee do they use? How much are
their meal tickets?

(6) Clothes cost too much money to
be carelessly cleaned and pressed, i
Your tailor should be picked just as
your doctor or your grocer. It is just
as important. If you send your clothes
to first one cleaner and then anothf r,
in the ert'd your clothes will be ruined,
and with none to blame but yourself.
The Stanford Dyeing and Cleaning
Works commands a high position in
the cleaning and pressing business of
Palo Alto, and they always guarantee
their work. These people know how to
press a suit. They press it to its
natural form and not "against the
srain." They also use an odorless pro
cess in their cleaning and every meth
od of handling clothes that is modern
is used by them. They have a call and
delivery system and for them to keep
your wardrobe in prefect trim at all
times is no trouble for you. They will
call at your home at regular intervals
tor your clothes and return them
promptly. This prompt service is a
great item in their business. They also
do repairing. What does this firm
charge for cleaning and pressing a
suit, and where is their plant located?
What does 444 mean?

(7) Chiropractic was born 27 years
•,'Ko. The suspicion, distrust and re
sentful criticism aimed at it in the

beginning has been dispelled. Chiro
practors have proven their worth in
healing the sick and lame with their
chiropractic adjustments. With all of
this human service in California they
were held under the yoke of the med
ical board. But thanks to the fair
minded people of this state, that is
over.
Dr. Minor and Dr. Hall wish to thank
all Iheir friends for the support they
gave them. These two doctors are
graduates of the Palmer School of
Chiropractic in Davenport, lowa. They
have practiced Chiropractic for years.
People come for miles around to Doc
tors Minor and Hall.
They are located at 153 University
Avenue. Give both the 'doctors' first
names and give two reasons why Chi
ropractic is beneficial to one's health.

(8) Don't junk your old tires. Take
them to a reliable tire shop and get
their opinion on their condition. They
may be vulcanized and run for several
thcHtsand miles more. And if you want
an honest opinion as to this, take your
tires to Palo Alto Vulcanizing Works.
Tires are this man's sole business,
and we make no mistake when we say
that he knows his business thoroughly.
Vhen he has patched a tube or vul
canized a "shoe" for you, then he has
made a friend. A guarantee goes with
evefy job he does and this is a guar
antee of absolute satisfaction. There
is no money value set on it, but it is a
personal guarantee that you get what
you want and no matter what it cost
him, he'll see that you get it. In addi
tion to the vulcanizing and repair de
partment, this man also carries a stock
of Goodyear tires and he has y ur size.
You don't want to meet a more con
genial man than Mr. Bogges with a
smile for you. Where is the shop lo
cated? What is his price for a Good
year Ford all-weather fabric tire?
What is the price of the 40x10 solid
truck tire that Mr. Bogges has in his
window?

(9) It is a source of discomfort and
worry for some people to buy a new
pair of shoes, but if you are careful in
selecting the correct size in the right
grade of shoes, you will not have this
inconvenience to contend with. At the
Lentos Shoe Store they will not only
sell you a new pair of shoes, but they
will make your old ones like new for
you. They conduct a modern electrical
shoe repairing shop in connection with
the shoe store and they do the work
just like it is done at the factories.
Let your next pair of shoes come from
this store and they will last you much
longer, for when you have worn off
the original soles, just return them
and they will put new ones on at a
small cost. They use the very best
double wear genuine leather soles and
the name and trade mark is stamped
cn them. When you have work done
here, it is well guaranteed, and there
is something back of the guarantee.
Then if it is in the power of these
people to do you a good turn, they
certainly will take pleasure in doing
it. They work for others as well as
themselves. What brand of pure
leather do they use on their soles, and
where is the store located?

. (10) Is milk and cream an important
part of your daily meals? If not, you
are one out of a hundred. Then with
this in view, it is only natural for peo
ple to be sure that their milk and
cream is' absolutely light. And to be
"right" it should contain a certain per
cent of butterfat, as well as be clean
and free from all foreign matter. The
milk, cream, butter and dairy products
you get at the Altomont Creamery are
all that the name implies—sanitary.
They feature pasteurized and guaran
teed dairy products. You can ask for
no better merchandise in this line. So
the next time you need any dairy
products of any sort, whether it be
butter, milk, cream, or cottage cheese,
just go to the Altomont Creamery. It
will be filled with satisfaction.
These people will give you service, as
their business depends upon it. If they
did not give you good service on your
first trip, you would not return again,
and they want your future friendship
and business. What is the location of
this firm's retail store, and what do
they get per quart for their milk. What
does pasteurized mean? and what does
guaranteed milk mean?

(11) When the pioneers blazed a
trail across the continent in '49 there
was also organized a man that blazed
the way in the paint industry, W. T.
Floyd. Since that time, this firm has
been beautifying Palo Alto with its
products. In addition to paints, they
also sell oils, glass, and if you are
looking for a waterproof paint, this is
the place to go. The Hadle Stormtight
Roof Paint firm has a very modern and
up-to-date store, and they are known
for their neatness and complete stock
of goods they carry. This store is a
credit to any city. This store which
this writing is for has the agency for
Acme Quality Paints and Varnishes,
the world's higest standard in paints.
Not only do they retail their products,
but wholesale as well. If you are a
paint man, you will know what firm we
are referring to for they carry one of
the largest stocks in these parts. What

is the name of this firm and what do
they recommend for floor varnish?
Just call at the local store and their
salesmen will gladly assist you. How
many square feet will a gallon of Acme
Quality Paint cover two coats?

(12) Just up the street at Mr. Ethen's
is he liveliest spot in Palo Alto. There is
something doing there most all of the
time and especially so after supper. It
is a place where gentlemen congregate
and exchange experiences of the day
over a friendly game of pocket bil
liards. But, in addition to the billiard
parlor, they also conduct a large bowl
ing alley and soda fountain where they
will make you a creamy milk shake
that will certainly make you return for
another in a short while. They are also
local agents for the United Cigar
Stores and carry a line of cigars that
cannot be had in any other establish
ment in the city. If you are looking for
a friend, you are sure to find him here.
It is a place where practically every
man frequents once in a while just for
the gentlemanly company he is sure to
find. If it is a box of candy you wisn
for your girl, then this is the place for
you to seek. They carry several differ
ent makes and it is kept in a specially
equipped refrigerator which insures
you of freshness at any time. How
many pocket pool tables have they?
What line of pipes do they carry? How
many alleys are there and name what
team is leading in the bowling tourna
ment now being conducted?

(13) Now comes a renowned meat
market which sells fresh meats. In
deed their meats are fresh. They make
it a point to keep them so, which is
responsible for the popularity and
wonderful business gained in the past
months. There are mrny tricks em
ployed by the meat buyers in judging
duality, and the Stanford Meat Com
pany is perfectly willing to share its
secrets with you. They buy only the
best, but they want you to know at
the time of your purchase that you
are getting what you want. Cleanli
ness is the watchword of this market.
The business is so great that their
daily purchases keep their meats
fresh. They seldom carry much over
from one day to another. We enjoy
writing about this market and its
owner for several reasons. One is they
say "never mind about buying, just
come in and look the good things
over." Give exact address. How long
have they been established? What are
their phone numbers? How often do
they get fresu fish at this market?

(14) In buying drugs, you want the
best, including purity and service,
which are two essential things to con
s'der when selecting from which to
buy these needs. Impure drugs are
worse than none at all, and poor ser
vice means aggravation and annoy
ance. Only the best drugs are ever
handled at the Young Drug Company
at the corner of University avenue
and Florence street. The proprietor
is a registered pharmacist and he en
deavors to keep a stock that will
meet with all requirements and cus
tomers do not have to go elsewhere
for anything usually found in an up-to
date drug store. In addition to drugs,
they carry a large stock of perfumery,
toilet articles, safety razors, and if
you happen to have a sweet tooth,
their candies will be appealing to you.
This store has the agency for all of
the Owl products, so you may obtain
these goods right here at home. What
is Ihe proprietor's name? Also what
line of remedies do they handle? What
is "Pom Pom" Luster?

(15) We are now presenting a firm
where fresh staple and fancy groceries
can be secured. It is a concern with
a conscience, and has an aim to please
the hard-to-suit in their lines. In fact,
you can close your eyes and buy here,
and every sale carries a guarantee of
satisfaction, and a little profit is all
they ask. Now just stop a second and
say to yourself, "Where is the best
stock of fruits, vegetables and gro
ceries carried in Palo Alto?" The best
brands of everything are the distin
guishing characteristics of this store,
along with its sanitary aspect. It is a
source of personal satisfaction to the
writer to write about this "quality"
store and the proprietor, Mr. Earle,
Ever since he started, years ago, his
popularity has met with a steady in
crease. He is not only a popular mer
chant. but is an alert business man,
and his idea is to always make the
place home-like when you do business
with him or his clerks, and so far he
has succeeded, and if he can make
Palo Alto a better city you can depend
upon him to take off his coat, roll up
his sleeves and help put it over. He
has for those who need it, a smile,
and has won their business or confi
dence. No merchant in Palo Alto is
more popular with his customers than
the owner of this store. Name the
owner and give his first name in full,
location and phone.

(16) Here is a works that makes a
lot of noise in a legitimate way. It is a
sheet metal establishment. They have
been making a big noise
for some time. They make a
of tin and sheet iron, and a 112

cialties are tanks, and irrigating pipe,
.spouting, skylights, cornice as well as
tin and copper sheet metal specialties.
The expert tinner is a great necessity
i'or those owning homes or business
places, as they look to them for re
l airs and parts. To be efficient, they
must be skilled in their calling and
geniuses as well. And these things are
apparent at the Palo Alto Sheet Metal
Works. There are many ways of tin
ning that will not stand the test. These
people use the right way. The owners
of this shop believe it better to be on
the level with their customers than
to climb upward by a crooked path.
Such a firm as this we surely like to
include in our feature. In fact, we can
not say enough for them, for they de
serve much more than a mere word of
praise. They deserve sure success.
Who is the proprietor of this shop and
Low long have they been established
here. Where are they located? What
size Warm Air Heater does it take to
heat a 7-room house? and give the
price of it.

(17) When a business establish
ment has reached the heights of suc
cess and prominence, it is either cred
ited to the skillful management or to
the quality of merchandise they han
dle. At the enterprising store at 317
University Avenue both of these items
are responsible for their standing in
Palo Alto. The most prominent resi
dents of the city are among their cus
tomer list. Their costumes can always
be depended upon for beiug the latest
styles and the good quality never
varies. "Where there is quality, there
is style." The Style Shop is well
known for both. (The store is attrac
tively decorated and the merchandise
is displayed in such a manner that it
becomes a profound pleasure to shop
with them). Their courteous sales
women also render great assistance
with their timely suggestions of "what
is being worn" and you leave the store
pleased witn your visit, feeling that
you have wasted no time whatever.
What is the slogan of this enterpris
ing store. Tell name of this classy
store's proprietor. A Big Clearance
Sale is now going on at the Smart
Shop. Everything in the store is re
duced for this Sale.

(18) The most widely known and
recognized decorations for any and all
occasions are flowers. They are recog
nized internationally and more can be
said with a small bunch of flowers
than can be said with a dozen tele
grams or any other form of communi
cation. "Say it with flowers" is a fit
ting slogan for their usefulness and
worth. The one flower shop in Palo
Alto that has created a reputation for
having in stock all of the different
(lowers in season is known as the
Palo Alto Flower & Seed Shop. They
carry a complete line of flowers for
the dining room table, to ship to your
friends or pot flowers to decorate your
home and porches. When you desire
to remember yourself to a friend, this
is the one place to come for they will
make up a beautiful boquet for you.
The proprietor here likes flowers him
self, which is symbolic of happiness.
His disposition is also like that of a
flower, bright and full of cheer. Who
is this proprietor? What is the num
ber of the shop? What kind of seeds
does he carry? What are the names
of the jardiners that they are selling
that come from Japan?

(19) Who is there in this city en
gaged in correction and the conserva
tion of eyesight? Many have come to
him and received great relief when
troubled with eye defects. His strict
attention to his business has won for
him a host of friends and patrons. Dr.
Cochran will be found very busy at
his offices at 122 University avenue
and you will make no mistake in con
sulting him about your eyes. He has
passed the State Board of Optometry
examinations and is recognized for his
excellent work, and is also a graduate
Dr. of Optometry. In addition to
working on your eyes, he will replace
broken lenses or make you a complete
pair of glasses. The eyes are the win
dows of the soul and when they are
wrong, the body is handicapped, for,
without clear vision, we can't see the
world as it is. Eye troubles are often
started when young and your chil
dren's eyes should be examined before
it is too late. Make an appointment
•with Dr. Cochran and get his opinion.
His office is completely equipped with
all of the modern instruments used in
this work. What are Dr. Cochran's ini
tials, and what is the range of prices
for his glasses? What is the store
motto?

(20) Most men like to know where
they can find a good barber shop, as
they are very particular about per
sonal appearance. They demand satis
factory work. When I suggest Mar
quee's Barber Shop, I know what I'm
talking about. They have a very sani
tary little shop with all the modern
equipment, also including five modern
chairs. They specialize in all kinds of
shampooing, scalp and facial treat
ments. If you want your hair to have
jompadour cut, or any other kind,
t let Marquee's do it for you. If

you are having trouble with your
scalp, they can help you. Dixol is the
scalp treatment they recommend. They
also bob children's hair, so bring them
in the next time you are down town.
Just ask anyone who has visited Mar
quee's shop, and they will tell you
how well satisfied they were. Where
ic their shop located? What brands of
hair tonic do they use and recom
mend?

(21) A most important institution of
business in any city, town or commun
ity is the reliable drug store. Here it
is that we depend for our health. And
It ere is where we go when we want
toilet articles, kodak supplies, foun
tain pens and a hundred other luxuries
and necessities. The Kenyon & Crow
Store is known for its large and com
plete stock of all of these articles, and
in fact, anything found in a first-class
store. In addition to their general line
of pure drugs, assortments of high
class cosmetics and sundries, they are
tlie Penslar Store in Palo Alto. This
line of household remedies is com
plete. There is one for every possible
need or use. Now is the time to begin
to think about Christmas Gifts. A
large collection of hand-colored Christ
mas Cards have just arrived. They
are wonderful in design and color.
Fountain pens and Pen and Pencil sets
in Christmas Boxes make a very fine
pi esent to your student friends, or a
big box of gift stationery. At this store
they conduct the largest Kodak print
ing and developing business 011 the
Peninsula, handling a full line of East
man Kodaks and Cameras. One of
the big features of this store is their
framed pictures and mirrors. They
have a framing department and are
able to frame for you any size picture
with most any style mounting you
desire. What profit-sharing system do
they practice? Find out the four lead
ing perfumes they handle? In what
line do they excell all other concerns
in this locality? What are the pro
prietors' nicknames?

(22) There is a mail in this town
much wiser than his sires; he ran
into a bramble bush and punctured all
four tires. When he saw his tires
were wrecked, with all his might and
main, he went to this tire shop and
had them fixed again. One of the first
things to learn if you own an auto
mobile is to know what vulcanizing
nrm gives Service that Serves. The
Retread Shop is recognized for their
expert tire repairing. You should con
sult these doctors when your tires get
sick for they surely have the dope
that cures. You cannot help but like
this firm for those connected with it
make every effort possible to please
you. They will always go out of their
way to do a good turn for you, and if
you have tire trouble on the street,
just notify them and they will render
assistance People who do business
here are really proud .of ttie fact and
it is simply because they give what
the customers want and should have
—"Satisfaction." Go to this shop and
meet these tire men and then tell us
what make of tires they sell and what
their price for a Ford-size cord tire in
the make begins with "F." Give two
reasons why this tire is the best on
the market for its size.

(23) Pleasure of motoring is in
creased if your car is in good working
condition. It is, therefore, advisable to
have your car looked over before you
start on this trip and when you have
your car worked on, be sure of* your
garage. The Palo Alto Garage on Em
reson street is indeed a thoroughly
dependable establishment in regard to
their repairing. Mr. J. M. Blackburn
employs only expert mechanics. The
Palo Alto Garage has the agency for
the Durant car and many others such
as the Chandler, Cadillac, and Cleve
land. Have you seen the new 1923
model Durant. Just step in and let
them sTiow you what a wonderful mod
el it is. The proprietor of this garage,
Mr. J. M. Blackburn, personally super
vises the garage at all times, and as
sures you of prompt service whether
you are buying a spark plug or filling
your tank with gas. They have Ever-
Ready Battery service, and they also
carry Associated Gasoline. They want
satisfied customers at the Palo Alto
Garage. That is their motto. Give two
reasons why the Durant car is more
practical. What is Mr. Blackburn's
first jiame? How long have they been
established?

(24) In writing of the leading busi
ness firms and institutions of Palo
Alto, we have come across an inter
esting shop at 367 University Avenue,
that well deserves mentioning. No, it
won't interest you men, particularly—
but has an especial appeal to the wo
men of Palo Alio and vicinity who
are lovers of beautiful things. This at
tractive shop is fairly overflowing with
wonderful creations of Laces, Em
broideries, Frocks, and Sport Skirts,
Reads for the Miss and Mistress —at-
tractively displayed, and just a) at
tractively priced. These are only a
112» w of the many beautiful and useful
articles to be found in this modern,
up-to-date shop—and the proprietor
