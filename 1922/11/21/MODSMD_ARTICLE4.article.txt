## 
### (By United Press 
HOLLYWOOD. Nov. 21 (United
TYess). —Financial and domestic diffi
culties explained in a note to his second
•wife has overwhelmed George Bronson
Howard, well-known writer of plays and
novels, who ended his life by turning on
the gas in his room here yesterday.
The letter, written not long before his
death, exclaimed, "If you worry me too
much, I will give up in disgust."
The letter, responding to an appeal for
funds, evidently, pictured Howard as
broke and disheartened, and contained
references which officers who are in
vestigating the tragedy believe indicate
that Howard may have fallen victim to
the drug habit.
The body was found in the closet of
his room, a rubber tube from the gas
jet having been brought under the door.
