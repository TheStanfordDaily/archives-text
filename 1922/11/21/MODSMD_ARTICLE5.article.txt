# CARDINAL GRIDMEN TO LEAVE CAMPUS TO REST FOR GAME
## Squad Will Return to Campus For Bonfire Rally; DeGroot May Play Part of Contest 
### 
One more day and the varsity practice
field, where Stanford football candidates
have worked for eight steady weeks, will
be as deserted as the Stadium in mid
winter. Andy Kerr will take thirty grid
men into the Santa Cruz mountains to
morrow night, where they will forget the
Big Game as much as possible.
On Thursday night the squad will re
turn to the campus to be present at the
rally and bonfire, but as soon as the cele
bration is over it will again go into re
tirement until Saturday morning.
Have Had Hard Schedule
The Cards enter the final week in a
peculiar situation. They have been
through the hardest schedule ever at
tempted by a Stanford gridiron team,
and the biggest event of all is yet to
come. They are probably deprived of
the services of Captain DeGroot at a
time when full strength is needed. Today
there seems some hope that DeGroot
will be able to play at least part of the
game—how much of it only Saturday
afternoon can tell. Doughty hasn't been
the route for two weeks now, but he
should be at the top of his form against
the Bruins. If Baker or Faville can
make good on that large task of filling
DeGroot's place, or if the Stanford cap
tain plays himself, Kerr's men are going
to form the best eleven that weeks of
training can make them.
Stanford, U. C. Even in Games
After digging around the musty and
dusty records, it appears that Stanford
and California have about an even break
in their football games. Up to 1906,
when the rugby game was instituted,
Stanford had won seven, tied four, and
lost four. In rugby also the Cards had
it over the Bruins, the record reading five
for Stanford, three for California, and
one tie.
But after the return to American, the
balance swung to the Blue and Gold. For
three years Stanford has been defeated.
In 1910, there was that history-making
14-to-10 struggle. In 1920 Andy Smith's
machine, composed mostly of sophomores
and seniors, ran up a 38-to-0 score, a rec
ord for Stanford-California competition.
Last year California won again, 42-to-7,
but only after the Cardinal had scored
the first touchdown in the Stadium.
If the game 1918, between the S. A.
T. C. teams of the two universities is dis
regarded, the tally on American games
stands at seven apiece. If it is counted,
the odd contest goes to California.

and California have about an even break
in their football games. Up to 1906,
when the rugby game was instituted,
Stanford had won seven, tied four, and
lost four. In rugby also the Cards had
it over the Bruins, the record reading five
for Stanford, three for California, and
one tie.
But after the return to American, the
balance swung to the Blue and Gold. For
three years Stanford has been defeated.
In 1910, there was that history-making
14-to-10 struggle. In 1920 Andy Smith's
machine, composed mostly of sophomores
and seniors, ran up a 38-to-0 score, a rec
ord for Stanford-California competition.
Last year California won again, 42-to-7,
but only after the Cardinal had scored
the first touchdown in the Stadium.
If the game 1918, between the S. A.
T. C. teams of the two universities is dis
regarded, the tally on American games
stands at seven apiece. If it is counted,
the odd contest goes to California.
One more day and the varsity practice
field, where Stanford football candidates
have worked for eight steady weeks, will
be as deserted as the Stadium in mid
winter. Andy Kerr will take thirty grid
men into the Santa Cruz mountains to
morrow night, where they will forget the
Big Game as much as possible.
On Thursday night the squad will re
turn to the campus to be present at the
rally and bonfire, but as soon as the cele
bration is over it will again go into re
tirement until Saturday morning.
Have Had Hard Schedule
The Cards enter the final week in a
peculiar situation. They have been
through the hardest schedule ever at
tempted by a Stanford gridiron team,
and the biggest event of all is yet to
come. They are probably deprived of
the services of Captain DeGroot at a
time when full strength is needed. Today
there seems some hope that DeGroot
will be able to play at least part of the
game—how much of it only Saturday
afternoon can tell. Doughty hasn't been
the route for two weeks now, but he
should be at the top of his form against
the Bruins. If Baker or Faville can
make good on that large task of filling
DeGroot's place, or if the Stanford cap
tain plays himself, Kerr's men are going
to form the best eleven that weeks of
training can make them.
Stanford, U. C. Even in Games
After digging around the musty and
dusty records, it appears that Stanford
and California have about an even break
in their football games. Up to 1906,
when the rugby game was instituted,
Stanford had won seven, tied four, and
lost four. In rugby also the Cards had
it over the Bruins, the record reading five
for Stanford, three for California, and
one tie.
