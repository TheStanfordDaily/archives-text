# ROUGHEST NECKS OF UNIVERSITY TO SING PRAISES OF RAG-MAN
## 
### 
White collars will be just simply rip
ping tomorrow, eh what?
No, of course not, that isn't what we
mean. Tomorrow is the Day of the
Rough. Neckties will be passe, except
in tackles, and the whiskers of righteous
gents will curl with indignation at the
mere sight of a shiny shoe, even with
trouser seat to match.
Reports from rival training quarters
are that the Engineers and Lawyers are
plotting to lay down a frijole barrage to
blast the wearer of vaseline vests, and
dampen the ardor of mucilage matadors.
