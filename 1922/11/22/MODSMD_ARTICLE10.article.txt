# J.C. POWYS TO TALK ON LLOYD GEORGE, BRITISH IMPERIALIST
## 
### 
Lloyd George, the modern type of
statesman and the exponent of British
Imperialism, will be analyzed by John
Cowper Powys, noted English lecturer,

philosopher, poet, and author, in a lec
ture at. the Little Theater this evening
at 8 o'clock
Napoleon, Lincoln, Gladstone, Cav
our, Bismarck —these are the men who
shaped modern history; Lloyd George
is their successor and the representa
tive statesman of today, in the opinion
of the lecturer.
"The great English leader is at once
an implacable Imperialist and a ten
der-hearted Crusader," declares Mr.
Powys. "Lloyd George as Chancellor
of the Exchequer in 1909, presented to
Parliament the greatest experiment in
national financing that any country
except France, under the Bourgeois
Revolution and Russia under the
Proletarian Revolution, has ever
known."
The Stockton Record is quoted as
saying, "Mr. Powys seems almost ec
centric in his gestures and attitudes
on the platform, but he is so tremen
dously in earnest, so vivid and dram
atic, that one is carried along by the
thrill of his personality rather than
the manner of his presentation."
As a representative of Oxford, Cam
bridge, the University of London, and
the American University Extension
Society, Mr. Powys has had a long ex
perience on the lecture platform and
critics throughout the country have
praised his work. The speaker, who is
himself an Oxford man, wears his
academic gown while lecturing.
His new book on the subject of
psychoanalysis, another field which has
interested Mr. Powys, will soon appear
in San Francisco.
