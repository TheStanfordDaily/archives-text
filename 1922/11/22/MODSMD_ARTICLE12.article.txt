# SPECIAL NUMBERS IN "FROTHIES" OF RECORD VARIETY
## Scene-Shifting Brought Down To Fine Art Through Work Of Coakley And Assistants 
### 
On display Saturday night, as the
"hootball Frothies" unfolds its two acts
of entertainment, will he First, the
greatest range of specialty acts yet at
tempted in a campus performance; and,
second, the most ambitious scene-shift
ing job yet attempted by Stanford stu
dents.
I hese assertions are borne out by
watching the rehearsals which are night
ly swinging the Ram's Head show nearer
to the point where it will be absolutely
ready to greet the house Big Game night.
1 he "special numbers" travel from boot
black stand to Javanese palace, and from
registrar's office 'to the baseball fight's
native haunts. Behind all this variety
is a thread of unity that binds the whole
together.
In regard to the scene-shifting asser
tion, proof plenty can be found by
enumerating the number of shifts neces
sary. The stage has been divided into
three depths. Some scenes will thus ap
pear before the front curtain; some will
occupy the stage half-way back to where
an intermediate curtain will drop; and in
six ot the scenes the whole stage back
to the gray cyelorama is utilized. Stage
Manager Clyde Coakley is using the
largest force lie has yet employed be
hind the scenes.
There arc fifteen changes of sets neces
sary for the two acts of the show. The
six main lull-stage sets will be changed
while the action is going 011, so that not
a minute will be lost between numbers.
One set. showing the L'nion Promenade,
is set up in thirty seconds. This scene
is used several times, and takes half the
depth of the stage.
Of the special numbers, the one show
ing Pop Harris' improved "Salon de
Shine,' as it will be in 1924, affords the
most novel of chorus effects. "Pop's"
place of business has been influenced by
the advent of Jack, the "love major,"
and its effete and exotic appearance
forms a background for a striking boot
black chorus, along with a dark-stage
effect. This latter scheme has been
made possible by the use of radium paint
'on the gowns and parasols of the pony
and beauty choruses, and the effect ob
tained by darkening the stage while the
choruses go through their song and
dance act will be something absolutely
new to campus productions. The
rythmic swing of the bootblack chorus—
the "jazz dispensers"—as they crack
their shinnig rags in unison fits in pre
cisely with the song number, "Blue My
Shoes," written for this scene by Chick
Midgley.
The Greenwich Village Follies, with
"Ted" Lewis and his famous jazz band,
will have but little edge on the
"Frothies," for a special Ram's Head
orchestra has been formed to appear in
one of the scenes. Grant Corby will
tinkle the xylophone, the "Saxophone
Trio" will be on hand, and Homer
Mitchell and Bill Bnrgess will handle
the banjo and piano, respectively. Col
laborating with them will be Paul Claf
lin, presenting feature numbers. The
orchestra will introduce some new dance
hits that have been produced lately by
Ambrose Whitmer and other campus
dance composers. It will also bring back
memories of some of the more recent
successes that are familiar to Stanford.
Last night the last preliminary re
hearsal was held, and tonight and to
morrow night dress rehearsals will be
run through. Emphasis is being put 011
perfecting the steps of the chorus. Most
of the stage settings are now ready, and
the system by which they are changed
has been perfected for some time.
