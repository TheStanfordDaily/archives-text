# GERMANY IS STILL POVERTY STRICKEN
## Indifference of Population Holds Back New Repulic, Declares H. D'Arcy Power 
### 
"Until France realizes that you can't
get anything out of merely compressing
a body to the extreme, nothing good or
hopeful can be expected to grow out of
present conditions in Germany." Such
was the opinion expressed by Dr. H.
D'Arcy Power, who lectured on modern
Germany last evening in the Little The
ater.
Dr. Power refuted the report that Ger
many is enjoying a secret prosperity by
citing instances to prove the deplorable
state of national finance in that country,
and by declaring that 110 nation, cut off
as Germany has been for the past five
years from the advantages of foreign
commerce, could possibly acquire the
wealth of which Germany has been ac
cused.
Dr. Power gave what he considered
three probable reasons for the fall of
the value of the German mark. Firsi.
the lowered economic outlook of her
people, who do not see the value in sav
ing money which may be worth less to
morrow than it is today; second, the
social and political hatred which exists
between the various parties of the gov
ernment; and. third, a fear of ivance.
This last reason has prevented the banks
from lending out money which is greatly
needed for the rehabilitation of indus
tries.
There are just two hopeful features in
the economic situation of Germany to
day, explained the lecturer. These aie
the tremendous intellectual activity of
the people fostered by the prevalence of
good literature, and the growing organi
zation of the youth of the country for
the upbuilding of themselves and the
fatherland.
