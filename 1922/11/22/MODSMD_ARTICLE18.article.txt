# CARD VARSITY FINISHES TRAINING FOR BIG GAME
## Kerr Has a Large Reserve Force On Which To Draw; Stanford Line On Par With California

Coach "Husky" Hunt led his fresh
man gridmen to the green fence that
encloses the varsity practice field and
cried "open sesame." The gates slid
open, and the first-year delegation
trailed inside. 112
They came out an hour later looking
as if they had seen action. Which
means that Kerr gave his varsity war
riors the final scrimmage last night
before they left for the mountains
this afternoon.
It is probable that Kerr continued
his policy of teaching the squad three
or four new plays each week. So the
Cards will have a few more tricks in
their repertoire which may or may
not fool the Bears, but at any event
Kerr's men will not go into the big
tussel unprepared.
"I have built all I can this year,"

remarked "Tiny" Thornhill just before
the U. S. C. game. The main job is
finished and the two mentors are at.
present concerned in keeping the
Cards in the form shown in the last
quarter of the Trojan contest.
Andy Smith has declared a perman
ent truce on practice for the year at
Berkeley. The Blue and Gold machine
has before it sixty minutes of hard
fight next Saturday and then it will be
broken up, since the Bruins will play
no post-season game.
Until Saturday afternoon there is
going to be speculation—and more
speculation. And the chances are that
most of it is going to turn out to be
wrong. It is the exception, rather than
the rule, when a Stanford-California,
football game comes out as expected.
There are too many people predicting
a forty-point California victory lor that
to happen.
Kerr has reserves —and plenty of
them, so if things go against the Card
inal there will be many substitutions.
California, with Muller and Berkey,
with Huffman as the third choice, have
an edge over the Card wingmen. Mertz
and Lawson, provided the latter's leg
is in shape, will probably start, and
then Janssen and Dole will go in, with
Thomas also ready.
Johnston, at right tackle, is going
to do battle with "Brick" Muller, and
it should be a great contest. On the
offense, it is Johnston's duty many
times to take out the end, and on the
defense the two also clash. Shipkey,
on the other side of tin line, will mix
with Berkey. Neill and Loomis may
get a chance, although Shipkey and
Johnston have been going through the
games pretty regularly.
Cravens and Faville will be the
guards, and have an even break with
Beam and Clark, or Perry. If Baker
starts at center, the pre-game advan
tage will have to go to Gallagher, on
account fo his weight and experience.
Kerr has several possibilities in the
center of the line. Faville may play
center, and in that case either Houck
or Ludeke will be taken off the bench
to play right guard. Houck has been
the regular substitute for Faville, and
is the favorite over Ludeke, whose
shoulder is still sore.
Man for man, the Stanford line
doesn't look at all bad against the Blue
and Gold. It lacks one thing—experi
ence, for Smith's men have all been
through the mill of varsity or second
varsity competition. Kerr and Thorn
hill, however, have stressed defense,
and when the Bruin backs hit the line
they will find one of the best defensive
walls on the Coast.
