# INTERCLASS BASKETBALL
## 
### 
It seems that class games have returned to the
Stanford campus to stay. Intramural athletics
for the past few years have been popular at times,
but they have never shown indications of such
sustained interest as football has for the past
three weeks. And now that the grid contests are
over, Dr. Barrow has started the basketball to
rolling before interest had a chance to flag.
Intramural competition has long been regarded
as child's play by many students and has not
received the proper support for that reason.
Interclass games, however, are big enough and
close enough to the average student's idea of
"worth while" to be a continued success. With
the new blood in Encina Gymnasium added to
the old, something substantial has been started.
The success of interclass competition at Stanford
is assured.
