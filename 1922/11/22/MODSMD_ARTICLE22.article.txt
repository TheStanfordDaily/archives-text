# HOW ABOUT THOSE HATS?
## 
### 
Great groans are coming from the women in
regard to the rooters' hats, which they are re
quired to wear at the Big Game Saturday. Some
of them don't like the idea of wearing rooters'
hats at all, others dislike the style chosen, and
still others feel that the hats were thrust upon
them in altogether too high-handed a manner.
As a matter of fact, a committee of three
women picked the present type of hat from the
available samples. Those cast out were much
worse than the one selected. The scheme of
having the women wear rooters' hats was not
spread promiscuously around the campus because
plans for bleacher stunts are never given out
before the game.
We hear now that the California women will
have blue and gold hats at the game.
For several years the women have repeatedly
signified their desire to co-operate with the men
in all matters of University interest. This time
the yell leaders want the white background that
these hats will form, for the men's bleacher stunts
below. So, since the hats are here, and even
though they don't please all of us, let's co-operate
and wear them.
