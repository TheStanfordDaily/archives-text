# THE
						CROWNING BLOW
## 
### 
The editor of the Daily wrote an editorial on
rushing and was called an agitator. He wrote
on the poster fight and was referred to as a liar.
The series of articles on rallies brought him the
name, poor logician. Then the automobile ques
tion stirred up one party to the extent of calling the
editor a hypocrite. But today, we bow down before
the crowning blow of all. The editor is a Hearst!
There are lots of agitators, liars, poor logicians,
and hypocrites, but there is only one Hearst. In
seeking out an invective to shrivel the editor, the
writer of "Another Viewpoint'' today has chosen
from all those varying from merely damning to
unprintable and has at last with glee fallen upon the
choicest of the lot. The writer shrivels, shrinks, and
fades away. It seems that the only way an editor
can get a viewpoint favorable to any ideas that he
might put in print is to propose the abolition of the
faculty, the throttling of the Men's Council, or the
theft of the Stanford Ax.
Go to it, folks! Express any opinion you like.
That's what the editor expects to do and he is no
privileged character.
