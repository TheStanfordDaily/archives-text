Editor Daily Palo Alto:
This "Automobile on Campus" ques
tion looks as if the "Dippy" is using
Hearst methods and trying to start
something.
It seems to me that whether or not
a student should have a war is pretty
much up to the student —and his fam
ily. There is nothing, in itself, im
moral in owning an automobile. Col
lege men ar*e supposed to be old
enough and intelligent enough not to
fall too hard for the "lure of the open
road." If they do, the faculty seems
to have fairly effective methods of
finding them out.
Personally, I've been able to main
tain both a B average and an automo
bile at Stanford some time. I think
most of the other "criminals" have
done as well, if not better. I don't
think a man goes wild just because he
brings his flivver to school with him.
