# Organ Recitals
## 
### 
Miss Elizabeth Peirce, violinist, will
play two numbers, one Bach and one
Handel composition, at the Organ Re
cital, Thursday, at 4:15 in the Me
morial Church. Latham True, acting
University organist, who will give two
organ numbers in addition, announces
the following program:
Fantasia in G major Bach
This belongs to Bach's early period,
and is characteristically brilliant
rather than profound.
Allegretto moderato (sixth Violin
Sonata) Handel
Miss Peirce
Introduction to Act 111 (Die Meister
singer von Nurnberg)
Richard Wagner
Arioso Bach
Chorale in A minor Cesar Franck
One of the truly great organ com
positions written in modern times.
