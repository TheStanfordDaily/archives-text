# NESTORIA WINS OVER FORUM IN DEBATE ON COAL MINE CONTROL
## 
### 
Nestoria won a 2-to-l decision over
the Forum of the College of the Pacific
in a debate held at the College of
the Pacific Auditorium in San Jose
last night. The proposition discussed
was, Resolved, That the Federal Gov
ernment should take over and operate
the coal mines.
Harold Milnes, debating commis
sioner at the San Jose college, arguing
in favor of the measure, declared that
there was a great need for some
change in the method of operation of
the coal mines, "Private companies
are in the business only for profit.
They disregard the basic needs of the
people."
R. M. Farley, '24, Nestoria's first
speaker, said that the issue centered
around the advisability of Federal con
trol. At present, Farley said, the gov
ernment acting as an impartial third
party, is able to intervene in labor
controversies as the representative of
the public. "If the government oper
ated the coal mines, it would not be
impartial and could not intervene."
Charles E. Blydenburgh, the For
um's second speaker, declared that
government ownership and operation
is the only solution suggested for the
operation of the coal mines. "The fed
eral government has successfully oper
ated the army, navy, the Panama
canal, and the postoffice."
"Government ownership is econom
ically unsound," said Emmet McCaf
fery, '24, Nestoria's second speaker.
He showed that such control would
mean waste, extravagance, inefficiency,
politics, and higher prices.
The judges for the debate were J.
A. Richards, Superior Court judge; S.
A. Johnson, editor of the San Jose
Mercury-Herald, and W. A. Southeim
er, judge of the police court.
