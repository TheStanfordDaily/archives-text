Twelve men have been selected from

San Jose Country Club teams.
The selection was made after the pres

a six-man team to meet other groups are :
Hovey, Hirschman, Hines, Putnam, Ditz
ler, Miller, Chase, Van Keuren, Strouse,
Kleiser, Kohler, and Alabaster.
The first match will take place on the
San Jose Country Club links against the
club team next Wednesday.
The second meet will be with Cali
fornia on the Sequoia Club links in Oak
land December 2.
The present competition will be com
pleted before the first meet next week.
Only one match remains to be played
in the third round. Alabaster and Peery
will play for the right to enter the
fourth round. The winner of the match
will meet Hines, who defeated Kohler
in a third-round contest seven and six.
Chase and Miller will play in the other
four-round setto. Chase won from Put
nam, captain of the team, one up; and
Miller took his match from Van Keuren,
live up and three to go. The fourth
round must be completed before the end
of the week, so the final match can be
played before the meet with San Jose
Wednesday.
