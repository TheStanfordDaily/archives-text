# Artistic Photographs Are On Exhibit in Art Gallery
## 
### 
Artistic photographs, by Ida Kra
jewski, are now on exhibition at the
Stanford Art Gallery.
Miss Krajewski, a member of the
California Camera Club, has succeeded
in making more of her work than mere
photographs. In artistic value they are
closely related to etchings and other
forms of prints.
The photographs, which are of two
kinds, portraits and purely artistic sub
jects, are not retouched enough to de
stroy the likeness which she considers
the primary purpose of photography.
This exhibition will be open until De
cember 18.
