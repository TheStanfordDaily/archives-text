# Sophomores And Seniors Tie In Interclass Hockey Game
## 
### 
The senior and sophomore hockey
teams came off the turf yesterday after
noon claiming the same number of points
in the interclass practice game. The
score was 3 to 3. The senior women
made the first goal one minute after the
contest had begun, but the second-year
squad retaliated by scoring twice in the
first half. During the last part of the
game the senior eleven broke through
the sophomore defense and made two
goals, only allowing the second-year
squad to score once.
According to the showings that have
been made in the interclass practice
games, the sophomore class stand out as
the best hockey eleven. In a contest with
the freshmen, the sophomore women
broke through the defense of the first
year team more times than either of the
upperclass hockey squads succeeded in
doing. The juniors lost to the sopho
mores by a 2 to 1 score.
Even though the freshmen did not
score in their contest with the seniors,
they kept the fourth-year women from
making more than two points. The
third-year class team defeated the
seniors by one tally.
The real strength of the hockey squads
will be tested when the four class teams
meet their respective opponents from
California on Saturday morning. The
interclass practice contests have been
played to prepare the women for the big
hockey games with the Berkeley teams.
Before the senior-sophomore contest
yesterday afternoon the women students
held a rally on the hockey fields. Songs
and yells for the Big Game were prac
ticed.
