# SEQUOIA MOURNERS TO BURY BEARS TONIGHT
## 
### 
One hundred and fifty Sequoia men
will gather in front of Sequoia hall
tonight at seven to conduct the mortal
remains of California to its last rest
ing place on top of the Big Game
bonfire.
A large black coffin will be the re
ceptacle for the departed. The mourn
ers will go first to the Men's Union,
and give the team a chance to shed
their bitter tears over the remains.
From there the procession will pro
ceed to Roble, that posterity cannot
say that the valiant California team did
not lack a few feminine mourners. Up
Lasuen, and back down to Salvatierra,
past the postoffice, thence to Encina
and over to the pyre the sad proces
sion will wend its way. There the
funeral march will be sung and Cali
fornia be alone under the eyes of the
freshmen t oawait the fire of Thurs
day night.
It has become a tradition with Se
quoia Club to furnish the crowning
effigy of the Big Game pyre.
