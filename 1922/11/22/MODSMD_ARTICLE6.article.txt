# DUPRE WILL GIVE ORGAN RECITAL AT ASSEMBLY TUESDAY
## Notre Dame Organist Has Had Brilliant Musical Career; On Second American Tour 
### 
Marcel Dupre, organist at Notre Dame
Cathedral, will give a recital in the
Memorial Church next Tuesday morning
at 11 o'clock. This concert will be a
University assembly and all classes will
be dismissed for that hour.
Dupre, called "the Paganini of the
organ," has had a brilliant musical
career. At the age of 12 he was ap
pointed organist at the Church of St.
Vincent at Rouen, his native city. He
won the first prize given by the Paris
Conservatory in piano at 19, and at 23
the first prize in organ. At this time he
was a pupil of Guilmant, Widor, and
Vierne. At 28, Dupre won the highest
prize offered by the French government,
the Grand Prix dc Rome, with a can
tata for mixed voices and orchestra.
At the age of 30, Dupre became the
organist at Notre Dame Cathedral, the
most coveted musical post in Europe.
Four years later he performed the re
markable feat of playing the complete
organ works of Bach from memory in
ten recitals at the Paris Conservatory.
Dupre's return to America for an ex
tended tour this season is in response
to the requests from all sections of the
country for his recitals. His American
debut in New York last year was a
"sensational successhe gave a series
of eight recitals to audiences approxi
mating 50,000 persons in New York City
alone. He has been adding to his laurels
in England and on the Continent during
the past season by numerous concerts,
including a series at the famous Traca
dero in Paris.
