### 
Bang! Give 'em the other barrel!
Queener! Hey, look at that bird!
Hello, Sweetheart!
Such were the noises that rent the
welkin this morning when the ruffs and
near-ruffs came down the Quad to their
eight o'clocks. Females, foreigners,
forty-niners, and fakirs had to run the
gauntlet of the engineering corncr, and
woe was it unto him who had been
feeble-minded enough to do a white yoke.
Even the dignified professors did not es
cape the watchful guardians of Stan
ford's tradition. Some even have spread
the rumor that certain of the live hun
dred had absorbed the spirit of the day
and were out on parade.
Between classes demonstrations were
held on the Law and Library steps and
on the Engineering corner. The main
panic was staged at 11 o'clock and lasted
until noon. "Classes be dinged!" said
Reggie, "Ruffs' day comes but once a
year!"
At 4 oclock the motley crew assembled
at the Law steps en masse. Several
stunts were pulled off while waiting fur
the procession to get under way. Headed
by Stanford's Hor?e M;u i ic band, the
ruffs then marched over to the Stadium
and passed in review before the apprais
ing eyes of the co-eds. He who was
judged the ruffest by the feminine rooters
received the kingly ciov/n of the day.
