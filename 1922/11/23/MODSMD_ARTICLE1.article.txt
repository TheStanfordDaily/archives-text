## CHINA WILL RESUME CONTROL OF SHANTUNG 
### (By United Press 
PEKING, China, Nov. 23.â€”China and
Japan have reached an agreement
through the joint Shantung Commission
under which control of the Shuntung
peninsula, subject of much controversy,
will be resumed by China.
The agreement now is being set down
in the form of a treaty.
Under the terms of the treaty China
will take over civil control of Tsing Tao
December 2. China will assume a debt
of approximately forty million yen, in
cluding the debts of the Shantung rail
road.
Japan came into control of Shantung
during the war when she took it from
Germany. At the Versailles conference
Japan retained control of it over China's
protest and it was not until the Wash
ington arms limitations conference that
steps were taken for its return to China.
At Washington Japan and China
agreed to enter negotiations toward an
agreeable basis for the return of Shan
tung. These negotiations have been in
progress through a commission named
by the two countries for many weeks.
