# SEVERAL CHANGES IN SOCCER VARSITY ARE CONSIDERED BY COACH
## 
### 
In last night's practice, Coach Harry
Maloney of the Stanford soccer varsity
made several last-minute changes in the
line-up which he had intended to start
Saturday against California.
No definite team has been announced
as yet, but in the best combination tried
out, Franklin, who has been taking Ted
Off's place at center half, was moved up
to the forward lint, taking the place of
Ta'am. Howe, a new member of the
squad this quarter, made a good showing
of himself at center half, and it is not
at all unlikely that he will start the game
with the Blue and Gold in this position.
Franklin seems to add more punch to
the forward line. He was originally a
forward, but was moved back to rein
force the halfback line when Off became
ineligible.
The freshman squad held their last
practice yesterday afternoon. Of late
the 1926 players have shown a good
improvement. "Red" Reynolds, former
varsity captain, has had them in charge,
anrf under his careful guidance, the
Babes have developed a fairly well
rounded team. The forward combina
tion is a little weak, vbut Reynolds be
lieves tbe freshmen defensive is strong
enough to hold the Bruin Babes. He
thinks that one or two scores on the
part of the forwards will give the Cardi
nals a victory.
