# BELGIANS TO UNVEIL STATUE ON CAMPUS HONORING HOOVER
## Special Envoy of "Heroic Nation" Makes Long Trip From Europe For Dedication Ceremony Dec. 4. 
### 
The Belgian nation, through its officially appointed representatives, will,
on Monday, December 4, formally dedicate on the Stanford campus a bronze
statue to commemorate their gratitude for the work of erbert Hoover, '95,
on their behalf during the Woiid War. Stanford was selected as the site for
this gift because it is Hoover's college.
The statue, the work of a Belgian sculptor, was purchased through a fund
made up of small contributions from all the people of Belgium, including
the children. It has already arrived on the campus.
Senator Albert Lejeune, who has been delegated by the Belgian government
to make the formal presentation, has just arrived in the United States from
Belgium and will come directly across the continent to Stanford. Belgium

will be further represented by Jules
Simon, Belgian consul in San Fran
cisco.
The gift is a heroic sized representa
tion of the Egyptian goddess Isis en
throned. The significance of the goddess
lies in the fact that in Egyptian mythol
ogy she was the representative of the
spirit of motherhood and of the grow
ing grain, and of the beneficent forces
of humanity and nature eternally at war
with evil. In her attributes therefore
are summed up the humanitarian efforts
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium and subsequent efforts directed by
Hoover to care for the war-oppressed
people of Belgium and supply them with
food.
The statue will be placed temporarily
in the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery pending the erection of the Stan
ford War Memorial building, in which
it will find its permanent place.
The public ceremonies of the presenta
tion will take place in the Memorial
Church at 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
Senator Lejcune will make the principal
address on this occasion and the statue
will be formally accepted on behalf of
the University by Frank Deering of the
Board of Trustees. President Wilbur
will also speak on behalf of the Uni
versity and there will be brief addresses
by Governor Stephens and President
Barrows of the University of California,
who have accepted invitations to attend.
In addition there will be present rep
resentatives of other Western universi
ties and of various organizations which
participated in the Belgian relief work.
The Stanford Glee Club will sing the
Belgian national anthem and will lead
the audience in the singing of "Amer
ica." Dr. Latham True will be at the
organ.
Admission to the church will be by
ticket only and the distribution of tickets
will be held in the Administration build
ing on Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week. Each student will be entitled to
one ticket upon presentation of his stu
dent body card during those two days.
Members of the faculty may also obtain
tickets during those days. After the ex
ercises in the church there will be brief
exercises, attended by the representatives
of the University and the specially in
vited guests, in the Art Gallery.

The Belgian nation, through its officially appointed representatives, will,
on Monday, December 4, formally dedicate on the Stanford campus a bronze
statue to commemorate their gratitude for the work of erbert Hoover, '95,
on their behalf during the Woiid War. Stanford was selected as the site for
this gift because it is Hoover's college.
The statue, the work of a Belgian sculptor, was purchased through a fund
made up of small contributions from all the people of Belgium, including
the children. It has already arrived on the campus.
Senator Albert Lejeune, who has been delegated by the Belgian government
to make the formal presentation, has just arrived in the United States from
Belgium and will come directly across the continent to Stanford. Belgium

will be further represented by Jules
Simon, Belgian consul in San Fran
cisco.
The gift is a heroic sized representa
tion of the Egyptian goddess Isis en
throned. The significance of the goddess
lies in the fact that in Egyptian mythol
ogy she was the representative of the
spirit of motherhood and of the grow
ing grain, and of the beneficent forces
of humanity and nature eternally at war
with evil. In her attributes therefore
are summed up the humanitarian efforts
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium and subsequent efforts directed by
Hoover to care for the war-oppressed
people of Belgium and supply them with
food.
The statue will be placed temporarily
in the Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery pending the erection of the Stan
ford War Memorial building, in which
it will find its permanent place.
The public ceremonies of the presenta
tion will take place in the Memorial
Church at 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon.
