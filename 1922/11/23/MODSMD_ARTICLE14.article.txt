# LLOYD GEORGE IS INDIVIDUAL GENIUS SAYS JOHN POWYS

"David Lloyd George is the supreme
type of that force which is staggering
humanity—individual genius," stated
John Cowper Powys, the distinguished
lecturer, who is a countryman of the
British statesman, in a talk at the
Little Theater last evening. "Possess
ing a compelling magnetism and all
the craftiness of the cosmic cat, the
little middle-class Welshman with a
big head, great blue eyes, and spindly
legs, belongs to the aristcracy of
genius."
Pitted against this power of person
al dominance in world affairs, Mr.
Powys sees the spirit of international
ism. The present conference at Lau
sanne, where Mr. Childs, the Amer
ican ambassador to Italy, is simply a
bystander, will be the scene of an
extraordinary merging of political
creeds. The Russian "Reds' are send
ing delegates, and it is conceivable
that the Italian leader, Mussolini, has
been gathering honorable nationalists
in Italy to lead them into a revolution
ary faction, the speaker suggested.
"The overthrow of Lloyd George in
England is simply the old authentic
English way of working out revolu
tions," explained Mr. Powys. "In this
case landowners of Norman blood
have started the reaction, because
they hate this lower class prime min
ister, who bled them white by huge
property taxes.
"Englishmen are so obstinately in
dividualistic that they think for them
selves, and they have a delicious feel
ing of escape from the magnetism of
that little Welshman. English patriot
ism consists in keeping up a personal
sense of self-respect, and though all
true Englishmen grumble against the
government if they feel so inclined,
they nevertheless adore it."
The "red" element is now repre
sented in parliament in the persons
of the laborites, and the lecturer point
ed out that, under the cloak of law
and order, England is having a revolu
tion of her own.
"Lloyd George will come back," pre
dicted Mr. Powys, "but how soon I can
not say. He saved England in the
war by sheer imagination. His real
personal ideal is democracy, and al
though he occasionall suffers socially
from an inferiority complex, he is
alone in the world in one thing, which
is the source of his power—his faith
in the average man."
