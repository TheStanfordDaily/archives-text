# "DUD" DE GROOT WILL BE OUT OF CALIFORNIA GAME
## 
### 
Any hope that Captain DeGroot would be able to play part of the Big Game
was abandoned last night when the Cardinal leader did not accompany the
rest of the varsity to the Santa Cruz mountains.
Kerr admitted that DeGroot would have to watch his last Big Game as an
onlooker on the side-lines, instead of as the Stanford leader in the actual
combat.
With the game less than forty-eight hours away, there is talk of last-minute
changes in both lineups. Norman Cleaveland, who was a member of the
varsity squad last year, and who has proved to be one of Kerr's best ground

gainers, may replace Cuddeback at
the start. Cuddeback's place kicking is
too valuable to be lost, especially
since the Bears have a strong defense,
so that he should see action most of
the sixty minutes. It all depends what
quirks and twists the game takes.
Kerr said last night that the reg
ular lineup, with the exception of
DeGroot at. center, would take the
field. That would seem to install Cud
deback definitely at fullback, and Fa
ville at right guard, for a time, any
way. George 4 Baker is to undertake the
burden of snapping the ball back and
of playing the roving type of center
the Warner system calls for.
Dick Dunn, a flashy halfback who
measures an even six feet, apparently
has won the right to start for "Spud"
Spalding in the Bruin backfield. Dunn
is a veteran while Spalding is just
starting his varsity career. The latter
can handle the ball more surely and
probably has as much ability as his
rival, but Dunn has lots of speed. His
one weakness is fumbling—and he
may overcome that.
Who is going to be the "dark horse"
of the Big Game? Someone always
rises to the occasion and plays far
better than he is expected to. It may
be this same Dunn. The younger mem
bers of the Card Varsity—Johnston,
Lawson, Shipkey, Janssen, Cuddeback,
Baker, Dole, and Houck —have a fine
chance to cover themselves with un
expected glory.
On paper it doesn't seem as if Stan
ford is going to lose so very much on
punts returned. That is a large item,
and the Cardinal wing men have been
none too proficient in the art of down
ing the receiver to date. Lawson's
speed limit iB limited, but the guards
and tackles are fast, so if the ends

don't nail Nichols and Nesbit, some
of the others should.
Can the Stanford line stand up
under the terrifflc plunges of Duke
Morrison? It wasn't able to resist
them in 1920 and 1921, but things have
changed since "Tiny" Thornhill has
been on the job. If Smith starts Nes
bit, plays the kicking and waiting
game for a while, and then shoots in
the "Iron Duke," Morrison is going to
look good. He will have the advantage
of being fresh, and he never was any
slouch at doing the chores of a full
back.
On the other hand, what are Wil
cox and Doughty going to do if the
Card line behaves as it should be
have? Last year the fast Bruin for
wards sifted through and caught them
before they got started. Wilcox failed
to get off his kicks twice because he
had no protection. That lost many
yards for Stanford. This season, how
ever, he hasn't had one of his kicks
blocked, which points to the fact that
the line is holding well.
Once Doughty gets in the open field
he is much the same as Nichols or
Dunn —a dangerous man. When he
gets tired Kerr has Guy Dennis and
Paul Murray to fall back on. Those
two, along with Cleaveland. have
gained a lot of ground because they
have started fast.
Charley Erb will bear watching. Any
backfield man that can stay on thr
California teams of the last threo
years without carrying the ball more
than a few times, must be good. Erb
is a sure tackier, good at running in
terference, and a wise and shrewd
Held marshal. Bud • Woodward has
everything that Erb has except, ex
perience. Erb has the start on him by
two or three years, and that makes a
lot of difference.

of the others should.
Can the Stanford line stand up
under the terrifflc plunges of Duke
Morrison? It wasn't able to resist
them in 1920 and 1921, but things have
changed since "Tiny" Thornhill has
been on the job. If Smith starts Nes
bit, plays the kicking and waiting
game for a while, and then shoots in
the "Iron Duke," Morrison is going to
look good. He will have the advantage
of being fresh, and he never was any
slouch at doing the chores of a full
back.
On the other hand, what are Wil
cox and Doughty going to do if the
Card line behaves as it should be
have? Last year the fast Bruin for
wards sifted through and caught them
before they got started. Wilcox failed
to get off his kicks twice because he
had no protection. That lost many
yards for Stanford. This season, how
ever, he hasn't had one of his kicks
blocked, which points to the fact that
the line is holding well.
Once Doughty gets in the open field
he is much the same as Nichols or
Dunn —a dangerous man. When he
gets tired Kerr has Guy Dennis and
Paul Murray to fall back on. Those
two, along with Cleaveland. have
gained a lot of ground because they
have started fast.
Charley Erb will bear watching. Any
backfield man that can stay on thr
California teams of the last threo
years without carrying the ball more
than a few times, must be good. Erb
is a sure tackier, good at running in
terference, and a wise and shrewd
Held marshal. Bud • Woodward has
everything that Erb has except, ex
perience. Erb has the start on him by
two or three years, and that makes a
lot of difference.
Any hope that Captain DeGroot would be able to play part of the Big Game
was abandoned last night when the Cardinal leader did not accompany the
rest of the varsity to the Santa Cruz mountains.
Kerr admitted that DeGroot would have to watch his last Big Game as an
onlooker on the side-lines, instead of as the Stanford leader in the actual
combat.
With the game less than forty-eight hours away, there is talk of last-minute
changes in both lineups. Norman Cleaveland, who was a member of the
varsity squad last year, and who has proved to be one of Kerr's best ground

gainers, may replace Cuddeback at
the start. Cuddeback's place kicking is
too valuable to be lost, especially
since the Bears have a strong defense,
so that he should see action most of
the sixty minutes. It all depends what
quirks and twists the game takes.
Kerr said last night that the reg
ular lineup, with the exception of
DeGroot at. center, would take the
field. That would seem to install Cud
deback definitely at fullback, and Fa
ville at right guard, for a time, any
way. George 4 Baker is to undertake the
burden of snapping the ball back and
of playing the roving type of center
the Warner system calls for.
Dick Dunn, a flashy halfback who
measures an even six feet, apparently
has won the right to start for "Spud"
Spalding in the Bruin backfield. Dunn
is a veteran while Spalding is just
starting his varsity career. The latter
can handle the ball more surely and
probably has as much ability as his
rival, but Dunn has lots of speed. His
one weakness is fumbling—and he
may overcome that.
Who is going to be the "dark horse"
of the Big Game? Someone always
rises to the occasion and plays far
better than he is expected to. It may
be this same Dunn. The younger mem
bers of the Card Varsity—Johnston,
Lawson, Shipkey, Janssen, Cuddeback,
Baker, Dole, and Houck —have a fine
chance to cover themselves with un
expected glory.
On paper it doesn't seem as if Stan
ford is going to lose so very much on
punts returned. That is a large item,
and the Cardinal wing men have been
none too proficient in the art of down
ing the receiver to date. Lawson's
speed limit iB limited, but the guards
and tackles are fast, so if the ends

don't nail Nichols and Nesbit, some
of the others should.
