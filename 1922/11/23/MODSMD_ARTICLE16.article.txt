When the last strains of "Hail, Stan

fire is nothing but a heap of smoulder
ing embers tonight, Andy Kerr and
his gridiron warriors will know that

T. T. C. Gregory, President Wilbur,

seats will be reserved for the society
and its guests near the platform at
the east side of the pavilion.
The bonfire will be lighted at 9

made for getting the crowd into the
