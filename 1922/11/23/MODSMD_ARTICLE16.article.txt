# RALLY TONIGHT WILL GIVE TEAM HUGE SEND-OFF
## Yell-Leader Minsky Promises Unique Stunt; Coaches and Captain To Address Crowd 
### Don Leibendorfer, ’24 
When the last strains of "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail," have died out, and the bon
fire is nothing but a heap of smoulder
ing embers tonight, Andy Kerr and
his gridiron warriors will know that
the undergraduates, and alumni to a
man are behind them.
Three thousand rabid football fans
—students, alumni and friends—will
gather in the pavilion at 7:30 to hear
what alumni, coaches, and players
think of Stanford's chances in the
game with the Golden Bear Saturday.
If the undergraduates are discour
aged over the prospects in Saturday's
game, they gave no sign of it in the
Roughs' Day rally in the basebalL
bleachers yesterday afternoon. Andy
Kerr and his squad of huskies ap
peared on the soccer field and were
given a tremendous ovation which
lasted for fully five minutes.
Men will march to the rally tonight,
in groups. One line will start down the
Row from the Sigma Nu house at 7:10
and all fraternity men will join in the
parade. The second line will organi&e
at Sequoia at 7:25 and another will
leave Encina at 7:30.
T. T. C. Gregory, President Wilbur,
and Jim Reynolds will represent the
alumni, Andy Kerr the coaching staff
and Dud DeGroot the players, in short
talks. The speakers will sit on the
platform with the varsity.
Skull and Snakes is giving a banquet
for the visiting alumni tonight, and
seats will be reserved for the society
and its guests near the platform at
the east side of the pavilion.
The bonfire will be lighted at 9
o'clock and undergraduates and alum
ni, led by the band, will serpentine
about it chanting the old battle cry,
"To hell with the Gold and Blue."
Special arrangements have been
made for getting the crowd into the
pavilion tonight and Yell Leader Min
sky asks that everyone observe the
rules which have been devised. Stu
dents will enter the pavilion by the
main (south) entrance. The women
will occupy the balcony on the south
side of the building and the men the
main floor on the same side. Alumni
will enter by the east entrance and
occupy one-half of the balcony on the
north side. Visitors will use the west
entrance and occupy the west end of
the main floor and that half of the
balcony on the north side of the build
ing nearest the west entrance. The j
doors of the pavilion will be opened at
7 o'clock.
Minsky has refused to divulge the
nature of the surprise he has promised
but says that it will be unique.

Three thousand rabid football fans

gather in the pavilion at 7:30 to hear
what alumni, coaches, and players
think of Stanford's chances in the
game with the Golden Bear Saturday.
If the undergraduates are discour
aged over the prospects in Saturday's
game, they gave no sign of it in the
Roughs' Day rally in the basebalL
bleachers yesterday afternoon. Andy
Kerr and his squad of huskies ap
peared on the soccer field and were
given a tremendous ovation which
lasted for fully five minutes.
