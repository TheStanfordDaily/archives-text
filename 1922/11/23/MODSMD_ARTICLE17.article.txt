# Light Wines And Beer May Be Subject of Tri-State Debate in March
## 
### 
"Light Wines and Beer" may be the
subject of the Tri-State debate to be
held in March. Stanford has submitted
this question as her choice for the
debate. According to J. G. Emerson,
faculty debating advisor, there is every
probability that this question will be
the one chosen because of the recent
agitation among the colleges on the
Coast for more live and interesting
subjects for debate.
The title of "faculty debating ad
visor" has been adopted by Professor
Emerson instead of "coach." The rea
son for this change is that an attempt,
is being made to advise the debaters
rather than to coach them. In the
triangular debate held recently with
Ciilifornia and U. S. C. the debaters
were allowed a great measure of inde
pendence in the preparation of their
speeches and this system is to be con
tinued. according to Emerson.
