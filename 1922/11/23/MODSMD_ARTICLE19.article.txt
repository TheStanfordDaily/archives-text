# ARE WE DOWNHEARTED?

A San Francisco newspaper, which publishes
in its sporting columns certain stories by a critic
partial to California, contained yesterday the
following of Stanford and her chances in the Big
Game:
"At Stanford they have no worries . There's
no thought about who will win the game next
Saturday. They are licked already, and they
know it. The beating they'll get will not hurt.
They are immune to such pain. They've been
kicked in the gutter so often lately, they've come
to think that that's part of the game.' What Stan
ford needs is a victory. Then the old Stanford
spirit, the old Stanford fight will come back. The
present gang hasn't got it by a jugful, no matter
how little they like to be told so."
Well, there you are. Stanford students and
teams may take this as they see fit. Some of it
is the gospel truth. Some is not. For example,
when any California man comes out in print and
says that Stanford knows she's licked before the
game, he doesn't show as much knowledge of
Stanford as he has been credited with. However,
the writer of this article in the city newspaper
laid his editorial finger on a few points that will
bear considerable thinking over.
