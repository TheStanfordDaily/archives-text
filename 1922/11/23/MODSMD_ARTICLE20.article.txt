# RUFFIANS' DAY
## 
### 
One need only to read the letters published on
this page today to get some idea of the things
that ought not to be included in the Roughs' Day
program. Others are disturbing classes, indecent
dress and questionable stunts.
There are mighty few things left the students
-of today in the way of momentary relaxation from
"the monotony of "just one day after another."
But the students still have Roughs' Day, and,
what is more, they are going to keep it.
Had it not been for two or three little indis
cretions yesterday, the event would not have
caused complaint. While no one of them was
bad enough to warrant the abolition of the cus
tom, they may easily lead to some that do.
Those few students who jeopardize the chances
of retaining what customs we now have left us,
might be tapped on the shoulder by some student
in authority next year and told to go home and
get some clothes on. We have student govern
ment and might as well take advantage of it.
Let us not wait for official action from above,
but try to get somewhere ourselves.
