# THEY ALL GO

The Hig Game rally is one move toward back
ing the team which does not require the united
efforts of three yell leaders and often a few other
people in getting a crowd out. You can't keep
'em away. Why it is that a football team should
not get just as much support during the early
part of the season as in the last is hard to figure
out, but that seems to be the case.
The Big Game rally is always one of the things
that is remembered in after years. Freshmen
who have not been affected in any way by Stan
ford and things Stanford cannot come away from
the rally still holders of their proud records.
There is a feeling throughout the student body
that this is one time to relax. Reserves are let
down, pent-up enthusiasms are released, and as
a consequence a lot of noise is made, everybody
feels foolishly happy, and worries are over for
the day. The Big Game rally is a tonic that many
an old quack would give his Sunday hat to ac
quire in drugs. But it can't Ire done. As a mat
ter of fact, it is done at Stanford only once a year.
