EVERYDAY PROBLEMS SERIES
No, 46—How To Get A Syllabus Sheet
Approach cautiously the chair on which the sheets are
laid. Take especial care to look unconcerned, and as
you walk by, dart out the left hand in a nonchalant
effort to hook one. Return the 15 sheets you have thus
grabbed at once, and approach again. Moisten one
forefinger to get a better grip on the paper. Keep your
eyes fixed on the pile of syllabi. With a brusque move
ment seize the topmost sheet. Time out for five minutes
to allow for picking up the other 32 sheets that also
come off. Ask the instructor won't he get one for you.
Yeh, just ask him!
Borrow syllabus from adjoining seat.

EDITORIAL
We prate about student spirit, and then we ungrate
fully leave in the lurch the most noblest of causes!
Fellow student-body, let us assert ourselves. Roughs'
Day has come and gone, and yet no effort is made to
award a costly prize to the most deserving rough! Why
not arrange to award an annual prize, such as a
waterproof tea set, or a rubber parasol, to the rough
who shows the best make-up? Anyone winning it for
seven years in succession could keep it permanently!
Here is our chance to fire up some spirit! Cash con
tributions to the Roughs' Prize Fund will be received
anywhere!

Think of Roughs' Day:"

"This is an outrage, a perfect outrage! It has gone
too far, but as far as I am concerned, you can all cut
class, for I'm not coming, and I think it's a good thing,
anyway . Surely, it's all right as long as no one is hurt.
I think it shows good spirit. It's an outrage, it's an
outrage!"
