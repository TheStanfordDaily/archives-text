Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Rough-handling a professor is in itself
pretty much small-town stuff, but when
a prof is mobbed outside his own office
while on the way to his class, it is a
personal affront—and, what is more
serious, an insult to the faculty. Any
one who saw the melee on the Quad
flanking the Romanic Languages build
ing this morning must have been dis
gusted with the spectacle of college men
tormenting a professor for the reason
that he had forgotten to wear a flannel
shirt for the day. But he was not only
tormented in this case; he was pulled
around and mauled in a way which was
anything but funny; he was then
jammed up against a wall so closely that
it would have been impossible for him
to take off his collar and tie even if he
had wished to do so—especially hard to
do when a person is bewildered by a
hooting mob. There was 110 resistance
011 the part of the professor other than
that which any sane man will make when
lie is assaulted by a gang of husky
hoodlums, and does not wish to have
his glasses splintered into his eyes.
Some lady visitors to the campus were
close enough to see everything that went
011. They were impressed, and they will
carry away the impression that there
are no real men on the campus, and cer
tainly 110 sense of sportsmanship and
fair play.
No one can cavil at the rough-and
tumble which happens off the Quad 011
the roadway or in front of the Library.
That is exepcted. But when it comes
to making the Quad a place for staging
all kinds of rough-housing and horse
play, it is time to stop. The road is the
place for that. Hereafter, let's keep off
the Quad, and not molest people who
have to work on Roughs' Day, and those
who are obliged to use the Quad as
thoroughfare.

To the Editor:
Again we have seen the passing of
another Roughs' Day. ,Again the Stan
ford Spirit of fair play ordinary
decency has been submerged by the mob.
Again there has been laid the basis of
the banishment of another Stanford
tradition.
Roughs' Day is doomed. Soon it will
take its place with the rest of Stanford's
barbaric traditions under the official ban.
And, indeed, the passing of a tradition
by which women are insulted, professors
are attacked, and the limits of ordinary
decency passed, ought to be witnessed
with satisfaction by every loyal Stan
ford man and woman. When men, un
der the name of Stanford, perform some
of the things which were performed yes
terday, it is high time for a stop to be
called. Any one who has followed in
the wake of the Roughs yesterday knows
the facts. I need only mention the as
saulting of at least two professors, the
invasion of the Library .and the leading
of two horses under the Arcade of the
Library, to say nothing of scores of
other incidents, to prove my case.
The Stanford "Roughs' Day" has be
come an instrument of the mob. The
mob spirit prevailed yesterday, and will
always prevail in such a demonstration,
where there is 110 responsible leadership.
Just as the instinct of the mob has been
the downfall of other traditions, so will
it be the downfall of "Roughs' Day."
Of course, "Roughs' Day" is tradi
tion. but after all tradition is not every
thing. In fact, it is often the least of
the things to be considered. Tradition
binds men to the past, it holds obsolete
forms in place; it prevents development.
What we need at Stanford is not tra
dition, but innovation. Other universi
ties have long since discarded such liar
baric customs, while we. the "last fron
tier." still retain them.
Let 11s hope that it will not be long
before such institutions as "Roughs'
Day" will be consigned to the pages of
regrettable history. No true Stanford
man or woman wants to keep in tradi
tion such demonstrations which sully
the fair name of Stanford.
A. J. Buttrey.

"Roughs' Day" should be reformed or
it should go the way of Plug Ugly and
other disgraceful customs of earlier days.
Of the practical unanimity of Stanford
professors 011 this point, there can be
little doubt. Perhaps a majority of the
students who have returned to normal
sanity since yesterday's wild debauch will
agree that what was once a picturesque
and relatively unobjectionable perform
ance has degenerated into plain hood
lumism.
As long as Roughs' Day was limited to
the wearing of outlandish costumes and
to a reasonable amount of good-natured
ragging and jazzing between classes, it
was at least tolerable. The average
Stanford professor is willing to concede
a good deal to the euphoria of youth.
But in recent years the celebration has
become more and more objectionable in
nature and has encroached more and
more upon the work of the University.
Yesterday's performance went consid
erably beyond the limit. There was
coarseness that bordered on indecency.
Women students and other persons suf
fered indignities that no Stanford stu
dent would he guilty of inflicting except
under the influence of mob madness.
Students in hordes of hundreds cut
classes and by their vociferous orgies,

disrupt the work of the entire University
at a time when study is already suffi
ciently interfered with by the distrac
tions incident to bonfire and football.
For a day, the University circus was en
tirely swallowed by one of its side
shows. That the student body permits
such a side show to continue in its pres
ent form is hardly thinkable.

"Roughs' Day" should be reformed or

Of the practical unanimity of Stanford
professors 011 this point, there can be

agree that what was once a picturesque
and relatively unobjectionable perform
ance has degenerated into plain hood
lumism.
As long as Roughs' Day was limited to
the wearing of outlandish costumes and
to a reasonable amount of good-natured
ragging and jazzing between classes, it
was at least tolerable. The average
Stanford professor is willing to concede
a good deal to the euphoria of youth.
But in recent years the celebration has
become more and more objectionable in
nature and has encroached more and
more upon the work of the University.
Yesterday's performance went consid

coarseness that bordered on indecency.
Women students and other persons suf
fered indignities that no Stanford stu

under the influence of mob madness.
Students in hordes of hundreds cut
classes and by their vociferous orgies,

disrupt the work of the entire University

For a day, the University circus was en

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Rough-handling a professor is in itself
pretty much small-town stuff, but when
a prof is mobbed outside his own office
while on the way to his class, it is a
personal affront—and, what is more
serious, an insult to the faculty. Any
one who saw the melee on the Quad
flanking the Romanic Languages build
ing this morning must have been dis
gusted with the spectacle of college men
tormenting a professor for the reason
that he had forgotten to wear a flannel
shirt for the day. But he was not only
tormented in this case; he was pulled
around and mauled in a way which was
anything but funny; he was then
jammed up against a wall so closely that
it would have been impossible for him
to take off his collar and tie even if he
had wished to do so—especially hard to
do when a person is bewildered by a
hooting mob. There was 110 resistance
011 the part of the professor other than
that which any sane man will make when
lie is assaulted by a gang of husky
hoodlums, and does not wish to have
his glasses splintered into his eyes.
Some lady visitors to the campus were
close enough to see everything that went
011. They were impressed, and they will
carry away the impression that there
are no real men on the campus, and cer
tainly 110 sense of sportsmanship and
fair play.
No one can cavil at the rough-and
tumble which happens off the Quad 011
the roadway or in front of the Library.
That is exepcted. But when it comes
to making the Quad a place for staging
all kinds of rough-housing and horse
play, it is time to stop. The road is the
place for that. Hereafter, let's keep off
the Quad, and not molest people who
have to work on Roughs' Day, and those
who are obliged to use the Quad as
thoroughfare.

Some lady visitors to the campus were

011. They were impressed, and they will

No one can cavil at the rough-and

That is exepcted. But when it comes

play, it is time to stop. The road is the
place for that. Hereafter, let's keep off
the Quad, and not molest people who
have to work on Roughs' Day, and those
who are obliged to use the Quad as
thoroughfare.

To the Editor:
Again we have seen the passing of
another Roughs' Day. ,Again the Stan
ford Spirit of fair play ordinary
decency has been submerged by the mob.
Again there has been laid the basis of
the banishment of another Stanford
tradition.
Roughs' Day is doomed. Soon it will
take its place with the rest of Stanford's
barbaric traditions under the official ban.
And, indeed, the passing of a tradition
by which women are insulted, professors
are attacked, and the limits of ordinary
decency passed, ought to be witnessed
with satisfaction by every loyal Stan
ford man and woman. When men, un
der the name of Stanford, perform some
of the things which were performed yes
terday, it is high time for a stop to be
called. Any one who has followed in
the wake of the Roughs yesterday knows
the facts. I need only mention the as
saulting of at least two professors, the
invasion of the Library .and the leading
of two horses under the Arcade of the
Library, to say nothing of scores of
other incidents, to prove my case.
The Stanford "Roughs' Day" has be
come an instrument of the mob. The
mob spirit prevailed yesterday, and will
always prevail in such a demonstration,
where there is 110 responsible leadership.
Just as the instinct of the mob has been
the downfall of other traditions, so will
it be the downfall of "Roughs' Day."
Of course, "Roughs' Day" is tradi
tion. but after all tradition is not every
thing. In fact, it is often the least of
the things to be considered. Tradition
binds men to the past, it holds obsolete
forms in place; it prevents development.
What we need at Stanford is not tra
dition, but innovation. Other universi
ties have long since discarded such liar
baric customs, while we. the "last fron
tier." still retain them.
Let 11s hope that it will not be long
before such institutions as "Roughs'
Day" will be consigned to the pages of
regrettable history. No true Stanford
man or woman wants to keep in tradi
tion such demonstrations which sully
the fair name of Stanford.
A. J. Buttrey.

"Roughs' Day" should be reformed or
it should go the way of Plug Ugly and
other disgraceful customs of earlier days.
Of the practical unanimity of Stanford
professors 011 this point, there can be
little doubt. Perhaps a majority of the
students who have returned to normal
sanity since yesterday's wild debauch will
agree that what was once a picturesque
and relatively unobjectionable perform
ance has degenerated into plain hood
lumism.
As long as Roughs' Day was limited to
the wearing of outlandish costumes and
to a reasonable amount of good-natured
ragging and jazzing between classes, it
was at least tolerable. The average
Stanford professor is willing to concede
a good deal to the euphoria of youth.
But in recent years the celebration has
become more and more objectionable in
nature and has encroached more and
more upon the work of the University.
Yesterday's performance went consid
erably beyond the limit. There was
coarseness that bordered on indecency.
Women students and other persons suf
fered indignities that no Stanford stu
dent would he guilty of inflicting except
under the influence of mob madness.
Students in hordes of hundreds cut
classes and by their vociferous orgies,

disrupt the work of the entire University
at a time when study is already suffi
ciently interfered with by the distrac
tions incident to bonfire and football.
For a day, the University circus was en
tirely swallowed by one of its side
shows. That the student body permits
such a side show to continue in its pres
ent form is hardly thinkable.

Rough-handling a professor is in itself
pretty much small-town stuff, but when
a prof is mobbed outside his own office
while on the way to his class, it is a
personal affront—and, what is more
serious, an insult to the faculty. Any
one who saw the melee on the Quad
flanking the Romanic Languages build
ing this morning must have been dis
gusted with the spectacle of college men
tormenting a professor for the reason
that he had forgotten to wear a flannel
shirt for the day. But he was not only
tormented in this case; he was pulled
around and mauled in a way which was
anything but funny; he was then
jammed up against a wall so closely that
it would have been impossible for him
to take off his collar and tie even if he
had wished to do so—especially hard to
do when a person is bewildered by a
hooting mob. There was 110 resistance
011 the part of the professor other than
that which any sane man will make when
lie is assaulted by a gang of husky
hoodlums, and does not wish to have
his glasses splintered into his eyes.
