# CAMPUS GARDENERS MAKING READY FOR VISITORS AT GAME
## 
### 
For the past two weeks the Stanford
campus has undergone a thorough
cleaning in preparation for the Stan
ford-California game, Saturday. Cam
pus gardeners have been working hard
to get averything in first class condi
tion for the Big Game and the finish
ing touches will be made within the
next two days. ,
All waste material gathered during
the general clean-up has been turned
over to the freshmen and is being
used by them in the construction of
the bonfire. Parking spaces for autos
at the Big Came have been cleared
and they are ready.
Comptroller A. E. Roth announces
that tiie load running along the street
car tracks west of Encina will be com
pleted by Saturday. Work was started
on this road in October and an entire
new road bed has been constructed
consisting of several layers of gravel
and rock. This road will be used for
pedestrians going to and from the
parking areas Saturday.
Due to the urgent need of the Bas
ketball Pavilion at the time of its
completion the floor was not finished.
As a result the work of finishing it is
now being done before the season
opens. The floor is being sandpapered
and then finished with a coat of boiled
linseed oil. This will put the floor in a
much better condition for the players.
Landscape gardening around the
pavilion is now being arranged and a
combination of plants and lawn will
soon be planted in the now empty
spaces. Similar work around the Stan
ford Union on the sides and in the
rear is being done. A badly needed
cement driveway in place of the for
mer mud-hole at the supply entrance
in the rear of the Union is now oc
cupying the attention of the well
known University steam roller. The
driveway will be completed within a
few days.
"Encina eating clubs are being con
structed on schedule," Mr. Roth as
serts, "and they will be ready for plas
tering by the first of the year." The
clubs are to be finished and ready
for use at the beginning of the spring
quarter, according to the schedule.
Recent weather conditions made it
impossible to get the rock from the
quarry for several days during the
last week and the delay made it neces
sary to do overtime work in unloading
when it was finally possible to obtain
'â– .he rock. Two trucks and a dozen men
were on the job Friday until mid
night.
The floor of the Encina club'toom
has been refinished during the last
week and work on several rooms in
the basement has been completed.
