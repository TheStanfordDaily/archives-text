Mr. Editor:
Regarding the perpetuation of the an
nual Roughs' Day, which seems to be
in some danger of abolishment: this
tradition, practically the last of those
old ones which usually for indiscretion
of a few have been done away with,
ought to be kept if at all possible. The
old traditions are among the things which
bind the alumnus to the University.
When he comes back at the time of the
Big Game and finds that the customs of
old are not followed in the week pre
ceding the struggle he thinks that the
Farm is an empty place indeed and that
senility has overcome the place, leaving
none but an indifferent crowd of young
people who go cibout an ordered daily
grind without diversion or inspiration
for anything other than the principle
they thing are here forâ€”learning.
The Student Council ought to be in
shape to handle the ones who so far
overstepped the "rules of decency" yes
terday. No one is viciously trying to
put anything over; it is mere lack of
thought until the harm is done. But
the outside world eats up scandal of any
kind happening in a community like
this. For our own good and for that
of the University, which needs the re
tention of the established traditions, co
operate with the governing bodies and
keep the annual celebrations healthy, for
those that weaken surely die.
O. B. Alumnus.
