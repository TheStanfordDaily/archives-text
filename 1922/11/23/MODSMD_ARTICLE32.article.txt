# RUGBY SQUAD WILL NOT TAKE NORTHERN TRIP AT CHRISTMAS
## 
### 
Stanford will not send a rugby foot
ball team to Vancouver this Christ
mas vacation, according to Coach
Harry Maloney, who has been con
ferring with the northern officials. Al
though word had been published to
that effect several weeks ago, the
matter was not definitely decided un
til last night when Maloney received
a telegram stating that the Vancouver
Rugby Association would be unable to
increase the guarantee.
Owing to the heavy expenses being
borne by the Stanford Board of Ath
letic Control it was impossible for this
body to allow any fund for rugby this
year. The Vancouver Association dur
ing the last few years has stood the i
greater part of the expense of the
trip, but this body was not able to do
so again this Christmas, because of
the large sums it has spent already
this year in bringing teams from ceu
tral Canada to Vancouver to play in
the western Canadian matches.
Several years ago, when arrange
ments were made for the Stanford
team to go north, the northern officials
accepted Stanford's terms provided a
Canadian team could be brought to
Stanford at a later date for a series of
games. The Stanford authorities were
greatly disappointed to learn that it \
would be impossible to bring a team
down to California for a series of;
games that would be a financial sue-;
cess, because of the rapid decline of
interest in this type of game.
Maloney states that no practice will
be held this year in rugby. He has
received letters from the Olympic
Games Committee which state that
that body is looking to Stanford and j
California to furnish material for a
team to be sent to the games in Paris
in 1924. The Olympic Games Commit
tee is meeting today in New York to j
deal with this matter.
Johnny Norton, '16, one of the
greatest hurdlers ever developed at;

Stanford, is representing the Cali
fornia Rugby Association at this meet
ing. It is believed that a Rugby com
missioner will be appointed by this
committee to gather material and de
velop a team that will be able to make
a good showing aganst the teams from
other countries.
