# HOLD UP WATER POLO TITLE AS RESULT OF SCHEDULE DISPUTE
## 
### 
The completion of the schedule of
the P. A. U. national junior water
polo championship has temporarily
been held up as a result of a dispute
arising over the schedule and the
right of the Stanford team to play the
Neptune Club in the semi-finals. The
matter will be decided when the
Pacific Athletic Association officials
meet this week.
Stanford lost last Wednesday to the
Olympic Club. As a result Stanford
was to play the Pacific City team.
The Pacific City team forfeited its
game to Stanford. One of the teams
refuses to allow the next contest to
be played because it claims Stanford
did not show up at the location of the
scheduled game and therefore should
not have been entitled to a forfeited
victory, but should be charged with a
defeat. This would prevent Stanford
from meeting the Neptune Club and
destroy the Cardinal team's chance to
play any more games in the title race.
The Olympic Club defeated the Uni
versity of California seven 011 last
Thursday and was to meet the winner
of the Neptune-Stanford contest in the
Encina pool last Saturday morning
when the difficulty arose.
Coach Brandsten has clearly stated
his side of the question to the P. A. A.
officials and yesterday put his team
through a stiff practice in anticipa
tion of another contest. He believes
that the committee will observe Stan
ford's right to meet the Neptune Club.
