# COMMENTS BY EDISON ON COLLEGE MEN BRING PROTESTS
## 
### 
Educators all over the United States
are taking issue with Thomas A. Edi
son, who, in an interview with the
Daily Princetonian. said college men
are afraid of work —especially dirty
work. The celebrated inventor's criti
cism of collegians has stirred up al
most as much excitement as his fam
ous questionnaire. Mr. Edison, it was
stated at his office, has no intention
of amplifying or explaining his re
marks, despite the counter-attack from
the colleges.

DALLAS, Texas, Nov. 21. —"The
trouble with Mr. Edison is he has
never been to college," said Dr. R. S.
Hyer, president-emeritus of Southern
Methodist University. "There are, of
course, loafers in college as there are
everywhere else. Perhaps we tolerate
them a little more and so probably
save a great many who, if they had
not gone to college, would not have
been saved."

PALO ALTO, Calif.- —Professor Lew
is M. Ternan, psychologist of Stan
ford University, inventor of the army
Alpha intelligence test, who probably
has examined more college students
than any other man, said:
"College students are not afraid of
work and prove it by working. At
Stanford a majority work their way,
or part of their way, through. Out
engineering students are not afraid of
dirty work. Edison has made a gen
eralization which sounds fine but is
not borne out by facts."

KANSAS CITY —Professor L. M.
Flint, Kansas University: "Eighty per
cent of our men work their way
through school so they don't have a
chance to get out of the habit."

ST. PAUL—"The pleasure-loving ir
responsible sons of the rich and near
rich seem to be the only class of
students who shirk work and are un
ambitious," said Father Thomas Cul
len, president of St. Thomas College.

ATLANTA, Ga. —"Edison's denuncia
tion is evidently the result of observa
tion of men who are not really repre
sentative. Approximately nine-tenths
of the responsible positions in the
business world are held by college
graduates," Dr. M. L. Britton, presi
dent of Georgia Tech. —(Copyright,
