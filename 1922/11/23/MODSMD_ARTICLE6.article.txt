# BURLESQUE USED EXTENSIVELY IN FOOTBALL SHOW
## Many Well-Known Characters Portrayed in Frothiesâ€™ Two Acts Have Varied Contrasts 
### 
Burlesque, of the variety local but
not extremely personal, will be part
of the potion to be administered to
the audience of the "Football Frothies"
Saturday night. The following list, al
though by no means complete, will
help to give an idea who and what
get honorable mention during the two
acts:
The Unofficial Registrar.
Pop Harris.
The Campus Cop.
ITncle Ben's Nephew.
The Pageant.
The Baseball Fight.
Ruth St. Denis.
And Others.
All is not burlesque, however. A
real spectacle is promised in "Javan
ese Twilight," where a combination
of unusual dancing and elaborate stage
setting will combine to make one of
the most impressive numbers of the
show. Chrysella Dunker has executed
a set for this feature that will repre
sent all the colorful and mysterious
atmosphere of a Javanese "wat," or
temple. Pillars of light will stream
down upon a six-foot stage from which
Helen Whitney, impersonating the
spirit of the ceremouy, will begin her
special dance number. On each side of
the stage the choruses will sway in
rhythm to the weird music as the high
priestess makes her invocation. The
use of batiks, Oriental draperies and
South Sea harmony will further the
production of what should be one of
the highlights of the show.
New effects in both costume and
stage design have been worked for.
In the "Birth of the Milkweed," the
full-stage set will represent a Greek
theater, simple and severe. An innova
tion will be the use of a stage audi-
ence on the right and left which will
produce the effect of the cash cus
tomers extending in an even larger
semi-circle than usual. Following the
latest idea in the use of steps, or
"jessnerstreppen," as it is known to
the technical followers of the game,
the Greek theater set will owe a large
measure of its effectivenss to the ar
rangements of the steps leading down
from this stage within a stage.
Equally well-supplied with steps of
a different kind will be the version of
the baseball fight in 1924, in which
Quintero and Harris move their feet
in lively rhythm to the tune of music
a la mode. Persons with weak hearts
are advised to be ready for the shock
that comes when the roaring mob in
this scene appears.
Paul Claflin this time impersonates
a high priestess (not of the Javanese
type), and has worked up a series of
steps calculated to give Ruth St. Denis
much food for thought. He appears in
"The Birth of the Milkweed" as Carna
tion, the high priestess of milk, an
swering the agonized summons of the
little milk fairies, and his burlesque
of the aSthetic dancing mood is cal
culated to be one of the laughing bits
of the show. Claflin also appears in a
specialty number with the Ram's Head
Orchestra, helping them in several
novelty stunts.
"Late Again," the song featuring
Gene Trago, tells in two words the
essential thing in his part. As the
"Rear Guard," Trago is late for every
thing all the time, from breakfast to
lunch and dinner and around to break
fast again. He even misses the Cam
pus Car on one occasion. Hap Ken
nedy takes the part of Crew of the
Campus Car, and at one time goes so
far from his duties as to appear in Pop
Harris's Salon de Shine.
