# CHANGE IN NAME OF SIGMA DELTA CHI IS FAVORED BY SCRIBES
## 
### 
A change in the name and nature of
the fraternity, widening its scope to
include, the whole field of professional
journalism, was advocated at the
eighth annual conclave of Sigma Delta
Chi held at Manhattan, Kansas, last
week, according to Kenneth Stewart,
'23, delegate from the Stanford chap
ter who returned to the campus yes
terday.
President K. C. Hogate of New York
advanced this drastic change in the
organization to enable the fraternity
to exert greater influence for good in
the matter of ethical standards in the
entire profession. It is the hope that
Sigma Delta Chi, under an anglicized
name and with a wider field, may
come to mean to the press what the
American Medical Association means
to the medical profession and what
the American Bar Association means
to the legal profession.
Delegates from forty chapters repre
senting colleges from Maine to Cali
fornia were present at the convention.
The four-day program included lec
tures, smokers, luncheons, banquets,
dances, and an excursion through the
Capper Farm Press, the largest farm
publishing plant in the world, at To
peka, and the Kansas-Colorado foot
ball game at Lawrence.
