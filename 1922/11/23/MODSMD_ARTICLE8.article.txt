# Photograph of Early Home Of Stanfords at Library

### 
A photograph of otic of the early
homes of Governor Stanford, a gift by
Boutiwell Dunlap to the Library, gives
a contrast surprising to most people be
tween the Stanfords as wealthy founders
of the University and as they lived when
they first came to the West.
The house in the photograph is at
Michigan Bluff, sometimes called Michi
gan City in early days, Placer county,
California, 1852-1855. At that time Gov
ernor Stanford was a leading citizen,
Justice of Peace, and merchant in the
important mining town. The house is
the same as in the Stanfords' time, ex
cept for the addition of one room since
they left it. It is a small frame build
ing of one story with three rooms, typi
cal of that period. An apple tree grows
close to one side and overhangs the
roof.
