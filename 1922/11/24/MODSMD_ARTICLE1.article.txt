# BRUINS FAVORED TO TAKE BIG GAME FROM CARDS
## CURB ROOTERS ROAR DEFIANCE AT BEARS ”Stanford Spirit Is Good For Thirty Points,” Kerr Tells Mob at Big Game Rally 
### Don Liebendorfer, ’24 
Give 'era the ax!
No longer can the Blue and Gold
rooting section bark back, "We've got
the ax." That red symbol ot' Stanford
spirit was created again last night in
the presence of 3500 undergraduates
and alumni in the pavilion, and will be
seen in front of the Cardinal rooting
section tomorrow.
Have you ever tried to push your
way down crowded Picadilly on a
foggy day? Neither have I, but after
walking on the toes of half the stu
dent body while the other half was
fighting for standing room on mine,
amidst a maze of serpentine in the
pavilion last night, I've come to the
conclusion that I don't want to.
Crowd Sees Red
It wasn't just an ordinary rally. My
own voice or rather lack of it will tes
tify to that. From the time that Dud
DeGroot led the Cardinal grid war
riors down the aisle with "Little
Andy" and "Tiny" trailing behind un
til the crowd whispered "Mail Stan
ford, Hail," every Stanford man and
woman saw red and nothing but red.
Had "Andy" Smith heard Tom Greg
ory, '99, talk last night he might have
scratched his head and gone home
thinking. Tom just couldn't seem to be
pessimistic and from the ovation he
got. it looked as if he wasn't alone by
any means. "We are not going Into the
game tomorrow with the idea of hold
ing the score down but with the idea
of winning," he said. "The Princeton
Tiger and the Yale Bulldog are all
well enough but under every red shirt
on that field tomorrow will beat, the
heart of the king of beasts!"
"Stanford Spirit Good For 30 Points"
And "Little Andy," who followed
Tom, agreed with him. "This rally and
spirit is unique," said the midget
coach, "and 1 want to express the ap
preciation of the team and coaches for
the exhibition here tonight. Win, lose,
or (Jraw tomorrow, you can rest as
sured that, the gang of red shirts on
the field will be fighting every minute.

than us to win for this spirit is as
good as thirty points."
Jim Reynolds, president of the
Southern Alumni Association, gave a
vote of confidence to Andy and his
warriors when lie said, "The alumni
are willing to leave the honor of their
Alma Mater with this team so ably
coached by Andy Kerr."
"Football is not played by eleven
men, but by the whole student body,"
said "Tiny" Thornhill. "California has
been held once this year and I think
we can hold them again Saturday."
"Brick" Morse Is Called
Dud DeGroot will not watch the
game from the sidelines. Of that,
every one who heard the big captain
talk, is sure. Well, anyway, we hope
that "Brick" Morse was not among
those present last night.

give the last talk of the evening, the

And "Little Andy," who followed
Tom, agreed with him. "This rally and
spirit is unique," said the midget
coach, "and 1 want to express the ap

the exhibition here tonight. Win, lose,

Jim Reynolds, president of the
Southern Alumni Association, gave a
vote of confidence to Andy and his
warriors when lie said, "The alumni
are willing to leave the honor of their
Alma Mater with this team so ably
coached by Andy Kerr."
"Football is not played by eleven
men, but by the whole student body,"
said "Tiny" Thornhill. "California has
been held once this year and I think
we can hold them again Saturday."
"Brick" Morse Is Called
Dud DeGroot will not watch the
game from the sidelines. Of that,
every one who heard the big captain
talk, is sure. Well, anyway, we hope

Give 'era the ax!
No longer can the Blue and Gold
rooting section bark back, "We've got

ford, Hail," every Stanford man and
woman saw red and nothing but red.
Had "Andy" Smith heard Tom Greg

got. it looked as if he wasn't alone by
any means. "We are not going Into the
game tomorrow with the idea of hold
ing the score down but with the idea
of winning," he said. "The Princeton
Tiger and the Yale Bulldog are all
well enough but under every red shirt
on that field tomorrow will beat, the
