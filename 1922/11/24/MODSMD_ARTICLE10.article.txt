# VARSITY AND 1926 SOCCER SQUADS TO PLAY BRUIN TEAMS
## Cardinal Kickers Are Favored To Win From Blue And Gold Soccerites 
### Louis Bucklin, ’24 
Stanford will have two soccer teams
in action against California tomorrow.
The freshmen will meet the Berkeley
first-year men on the Held back of the
track bleachers at 9 :.?(>, and at 10 o'clock
the Blue and Gold Varsity will tangle
with Coach Harry Maloncy's Cardinals
on the varsity field.
California is supposed to have a weak
Varsity this year. Dope from compara
tive scores in the University and Club
Leagues show the Stanford team to be
from three to live goals better than their
Bruin rivals.
Stanford's Varsity this season is
strong, both in the defense and in the
attack. So far it has succeeded in mak
ing a total of twenty-three scores against
a single goal of their opponents.
The Stanford-California game will
complete the first half of the University
and Club schedule.
Little is known about the Bear fresh
men. They got off to a late start this
season, as did the Stanford frosh. No
comparison of the strength of the Babe
elevens can be made, as they have not
met the same teams this year. The
Cardinal freshmen have a strong de
fensive aggregation, but seem to lack
the necessary punch when it comes to
scoring.
The teams will line up as follows:
Varsity — Masters (captain), goal;
Hayes, Clark, fullbacks; Swaync. Howe.
YValthers, halfbacks; Green, Dcffebach,
Franklin, Quigley, Titus, forwards; El
more, John, Smith. Johnson, Hamilton,
Snow, Ta'am, substitutes.
Freshmen — Newland, goal; Polland,
Campbell (captain), fullbacks; Devlin.
Franklin, Roodhouse, halfbacks; Espy,
Shillock, Schoon, Hocker, Richardson,
forwards; Motheral. Laughlin. White
head, Dobbins, substitutes.
