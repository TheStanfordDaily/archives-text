# WHAT THE MORROW HOLDS IN STORE
## 
### 
Today and tomorrow all Stanford lives only
for football. A thirty-million dollar plant, a hun
dred-million dollar student body, and a faculty
and alumni body whose worth cannot be esti
mated, will tomorrow be overshadowed by two
coaches and thirty ordinary, everyday men,
whose particular business this year is to with
stand the California attack.
There will be no parties, no examinations, no
everyday affairs of any kind tomorrow. There
will be no individual loves and hates, no clique
squabbles, no interclass struggles, no political
wrangles. There will be no criticism of this and
that, no dictation of rights and policies, no classi
fications of the good and the bad. For tomorrow
is November 25. Tomorrow Stanford playS
California.
For three years Stanford has tried to force the
Golden Bear to growl its own football swan-song.
For three years under as many coaches Stanford
Varsity has gone into the classic of the Coast
willing but unprepared to wrest the honors from
the mighty paw of the California Bruin. For
three years California has remained unshaken at
the top of the football heap.
Tomorrow the fourth Stanford Varsity in four
years, under the fourth system and the fourth
coach, will meet that same undefeated Bruin,
■now mightier by far. And tonight Andy Kerr,
the man, is telling his squad, the Stanford stu
dents, "Work, fight, and be merry; for tomorrow
is another day." And tomorrow Andy Kerr, the
coach, will tell his squad, the Stanford Varsity,
"Go in and use everything you've learned."
California has reached the peak of football
achievement. Stanford is beginning at the bot
tom of the ladder. California has worked under
a system for years. Stanford has had the benefit
of but one.
Every unbiased observer of football concedes
California an almost hopeless edge. Every Stan
ford enthusiast gives Stanford more than an out
side fighting chance. Stanford is never defeated
until the game is over. Nobody is giving up
today.
Stanford ends tomorrow the first regular sea
son under the Warner system —a system that was
not built to achieve victory in a single year over
the greatest college team in America. No such
system was ever invented. But when the great
crowd has heard the last strains of "Hail, Stan
lord ! Ilail!" at the Stadium tomorrow afternoon,
they will go home convinced that Stanford is on
her way to better days in athletics. It will not
be enough to see Stanford on the field. The
crowd must see the Stadium, hear the comment,
watch the stunts, and drink in the atmosphere of
a college that is on its road to eventual and con
sistent victory, if it is to be impressed with Stan
ford's showing. And that victory may come to
morrow! For those who understand the game,
this will not be necessary. Old Varsity men re
turning will see in the Stanford team with its
back to the wall tomorrow the making of a future
Stanford Varsity that will have no historical
equal on the Farm. They will see the outline of
the carefully constructed foundation of the War
ner system. They will see here the touch of
Andy Kerr, there the handiwork of Tiny Thorn
hill. And those who look forward to better days
for Stanford on the athletic field will go away
encouraged and pleased with what they saw.
The Stanford team tomorrow will be 110 dif
ferent from others in the past. Whether they
win, lose, or draw, they will give all they have.
They want to win. Many say that victory for
Stanford is not possible, but regardless of cir
cumstances, Stanford always has a chance. If
it means anything to the reader, it must be re
membered that it is STANFORD VARSITY
that is playing California tomorrow.
What else can a Stanford man ask?

The Stanford team tomorrow will be 110 dif
ferent from others in the past. Whether they
win, lose, or draw, they will give all they have.
They want to win. Many say that victory for
Stanford is not possible, but regardless of cir
cumstances, Stanford always has a chance. If
it means anything to the reader, it must be re
membered that it is STANFORD VARSITY
that is playing California tomorrow.
What else can a Stanford man ask?
Today and tomorrow all Stanford lives only
for football. A thirty-million dollar plant, a hun
dred-million dollar student body, and a faculty
and alumni body whose worth cannot be esti
mated, will tomorrow be overshadowed by two
coaches and thirty ordinary, everyday men,
whose particular business this year is to with
stand the California attack.
There will be no parties, no examinations, no
everyday affairs of any kind tomorrow. There
will be no individual loves and hates, no clique
squabbles, no interclass struggles, no political
wrangles. There will be no criticism of this and
that, no dictation of rights and policies, no classi
fications of the good and the bad. For tomorrow
is November 25. Tomorrow Stanford playS
California.
For three years Stanford has tried to force the
Golden Bear to growl its own football swan-song.
For three years under as many coaches Stanford
Varsity has gone into the classic of the Coast
willing but unprepared to wrest the honors from
the mighty paw of the California Bruin. For
three years California has remained unshaken at
the top of the football heap.
Tomorrow the fourth Stanford Varsity in four
years, under the fourth system and the fourth
coach, will meet that same undefeated Bruin,
■now mightier by far. And tonight Andy Kerr,
the man, is telling his squad, the Stanford stu
dents, "Work, fight, and be merry; for tomorrow
is another day." And tomorrow Andy Kerr, the
coach, will tell his squad, the Stanford Varsity,
"Go in and use everything you've learned."
California has reached the peak of football
achievement. Stanford is beginning at the bot
tom of the ladder. California has worked under
a system for years. Stanford has had the benefit
of but one.
Every unbiased observer of football concedes
California an almost hopeless edge. Every Stan
ford enthusiast gives Stanford more than an out
side fighting chance. Stanford is never defeated
until the game is over. Nobody is giving up
today.
Stanford ends tomorrow the first regular sea
son under the Warner system —a system that was
not built to achieve victory in a single year over
the greatest college team in America. No such
system was ever invented. But when the great
crowd has heard the last strains of "Hail, Stan
lord ! Ilail!" at the Stadium tomorrow afternoon,
they will go home convinced that Stanford is on
her way to better days in athletics. It will not
be enough to see Stanford on the field. The
crowd must see the Stadium, hear the comment,
watch the stunts, and drink in the atmosphere of
a college that is on its road to eventual and con
sistent victory, if it is to be impressed with Stan
ford's showing. And that victory may come to
morrow! For those who understand the game,
this will not be necessary. Old Varsity men re
turning will see in the Stanford team with its
back to the wall tomorrow the making of a future
Stanford Varsity that will have no historical
equal on the Farm. They will see the outline of
the carefully constructed foundation of the War
ner system. They will see here the touch of
Andy Kerr, there the handiwork of Tiny Thorn
hill. And those who look forward to better days
for Stanford on the athletic field will go away
encouraged and pleased with what they saw.
The Stanford team tomorrow will be 110 dif
ferent from others in the past. Whether they
win, lose, or draw, they will give all they have.
