# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M.24
## 
### 
It has been with a great deal of effort that Cabbages
has induced Brick Morse to come forth with a state
ment about the game Saturday. With his usual bashful
reticence Brick absolutely refused to give Cabbages a
single word about the California team. Finally he was
prevailed upon to write the following impartial account
of the coming contest:
CALIFORNIA MAY POSSIBLY
SCORE, SAYS BRICK MORSE
Of course there cannot be two sides to the question.
California, with the best gridmen it has ever had, will
run. up a record score tomorrow. I am not prejudiced
when I say this, but I assert that the Bruins have the
best eleven in the country. As for the chances of
Stanford scoring, that cannot be even imagined. The
only time that Stanford will get into the Bear territory
will be when they stagger down the field on the kickoff
after a California score. Readers of the Chronicbull
have always realized that my criticisms have been im
partial. They have come from a man who knows the
game from A to Z. When I said last year that California
would walk away with a five-touchdown lead, I was
scorned. But when the shadows darkened the Stadium
011 the eve of the Big Game, the frowners admitted that
"He was right."
Therefore hark! California will win tomorrow decis
ively. There will be 110 room against the wonder team
of the country. I will be vindicated. California cer
tainly is IT!

Cabbages presents the following thumb-nail inter
views with prominent members of the Bear squad. We
could only interview the members of the first team, due
to lack of space. The other nine teams will have to
go unrepresented.

Charlie Erb had nothing to say on the game. "Unless
prevented by the Berkeley police force from attending,
I will be there, and the team will be complete," said
the California quarterback modestly.

Duke Morrison had little to say on the game. "If
Andy Smith puts me in, the game is won," he blushed,
and then would say no more. There was nothing more
to say.

When approached 011 the subject of the Big Game, A.
Smith had little to say.
"Unless Stanford turns the tables on us we will cer
tainly win, although it is possible that we may lose.
Overconfidence is bad for a team. It tell the boys not
to expect to score more than a dozen touchdowns.
There's no use being certain of a thing as serious as
this."

When approached on the question of who would win
tomorrow, a prominent member of the Stanford team
said nothing, but spit on his hands, stuck out his chin,
and flashed a couple of sparks of lightning out of his
eyes. The reporter did not wait longer. Words were
not necessary. Cabbages only hopes that California's
team has a strong constitution.

Reggie the Rough dashed off a poem about fighting
spirit and all that some may think is rather foolish, and
old, and all that, but somehow it struck us as the way
we felt about it, too, and so we give it to you and let
you see if you don't feel the same way that we did:
Eleven men are down there giving all they have to win,
A thousand in the bleachers fighting too,
The odds are all against them, yet they never will-give in,
Yet isn't that the proper thing to do?
Is there any use in fighting till you're tired, and sick,
and worn,
When it's easy to give up. and take a rest?
There is but a single answer to this question, and we
scorn
Any man who cannot answer with the rest.
If you think the game is rotten, and the referee's
forgotten
How to penalize the error*? you can see.
If the spirits start to oozing just because the team is
losing,
Or the umpire's soul is bathed in perfidy.
That's the time the team needs backing, and 110 rooter
should be lacking
In the yells and in the pep all through the fight.
So don't quit because we're losin', and it's a foregone
conclusion,
That some day the game is going to come out right!
