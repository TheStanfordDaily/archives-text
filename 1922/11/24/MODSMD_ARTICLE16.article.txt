# CALIFORNIA MAY SET NEW SCORING RECORD—GLEESON
## 
### Edgar T. Gleeson

The California varsity, like all cham
pions, has come to occupy an unen
-1 viable position. One half of the foot- j
ball public turns out to see it win; the
other half to see it licked.
One of these two groups is bound to I
be disappointed in tomorrow's clash
of California and the Cardinal. It will
, not be us.
California will win. As to the exact
score, that calls for too much guess
work. When it looked as though the
Bears would win by at least 50 to 0
over Stanford last year, the latter
managed to put through a touchdown.
At Pasadena, California should have
won by 20 to 0, but it elected to play
a defensive game, or was forced into
a defensive game and the struggle
j ended without either the Bears or W.
& J. chalking up a point.
Today, it is not who will win, but
; how can Stanford hold down the
1 score?
We figure to spend the afternoon
high up in Section C, passing the word
along every tew minutes that Cali
fornia has just scored again. It is not
beyond the realms of possibility that
Cuddeback may get his toe working
and put over a field goal, or that Wil
cox will get a pass away for a touch
down. But the Olympic Club couldn't
i do it and we fail to see how the Cards
; have much chance.
Andy Smith, with his double set of
backs and an army of second string
men, most of whom are stars in their
own right, can be counted on to run
up a record score.
It may exceed those of other years
by at least ten points. On the last oc
casion that California met Stanford,
we thought the game would be a run
away, but the new turf had a lot to
do with upsetting the aerial play. A
} soft field affects the California speed
to such an extent as to almost place
the team at a disadvantage. We no
ticed in the U. S. C. game that; Stan
j ford brought new full set of shoes
j on the field for the second half. Even
then, the players were kept busy shak
ing the clods loose from the cleats.
There are two good reasons why the
Bears will want to run up a high score
| today: first, because the game marks
the close of their season —there is no
game with an eastern eleven in pros
pect; and, secondly, because it is the
last contest in which Captain Charley
Erb, "Duke" Morrison, "Brick" Muller,
Archie Nesbit, Jimmy Dean. "Fat"
Clark, and Bill Gallagher will have a
part. In addition to these eight—the
backbone of California's success, there
are Art Best and Bill Bell, two Bear
substitutes.
The California squad lias brought
fame and glory to not only the institu
tion at Berkeley, but to the whole
state. Stanford, as a friendly compet
itor, knows that when the game is
over tomorrow, it will be the first to
offer its congratulation to the 1922
Bears. They're a great team, fellows,
and we don't admit that anybody can
j beat them.
Some one of these seasons Cali
fornia will be overthrown in the foot-
I ball world. When that hour comes we
hope Stanford will be the team to
i turn the trick.
All right, let's go!
