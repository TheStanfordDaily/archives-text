# U.C. WILL WIN BY 21 POINTS, SAYS ED HUGHES
## 
### Ed R. Hughes 
San Francisco Chronicle
I would like to say of the California-
Stanford game next Saturday that "It
looks like a toss-up and the team that
gets the breaks will win."
But I can't honestly say that.
To my way of thinking, California
is a cinch to win.
If Stanford does win it will be the
biggest upset in football that ever

took place west of the Rockies at
least.
California outclasses every other
team on the Pacific Coast so far that !
perhaps we do not give the other ■
teams due credit. Those who have \
seen the California team in action for
the last three years can't help but :
compare other teams with them, and
to the disadvantage of the other I
elevens.
The men trained by Andy Smith not
only excel as individuals but the team
work has been worked up until the
machine runs as smooth as oil.
Stanford will wrest the football
supremacy from California one of
these days—but not this season.
The Cards have gone in for football
in a big way by hiring Glenn Warner,
one of the most competent coaches in
the land, and he is assisted by Andy
Kerr and Tiny Thornliill, men of ex
perience and undoubted ability. Given
any kind of luck those men will pro
duce powerful teams for Stanford. But
California has a tremendous edge this
year, and class will tell in football as
well as in other lines of sport and
endeavor.
Next year California will lose eight
men, all of them fine football players
and some of them brilliant stars. Stan
ford will lose but three. U. S. C. loses
three. Washington loses three.
If California is to be toppled, next
year is the year to do it. But Andy
Smith has a sound system working at
California and the Bears will be a
well-rounded team again next year—
make no mistake about that. The race
next year should be a corker.
As to the size of the score Saturday
—that is mere guesswork. There is a
lot of luck in football, so picking
scores is hazardous business. But with
luck breaking even, I should say that
California will win by at least twenty
one points.
Will Stanford score?
That's another tough one to answer.
No one expected Stanford to score last
year, yet Toomey fumbled the kick
off, a Stanford man recovered the ball
and Art Wilcox went over for Stan
ford's only touchdown before the game
was three minutes old.
Stanford must always be given a
chance to score so long as Cuddeback
is in the game, for that young man
has shown that he is a place kicker
of class.
But no matter which team wins the
spectacle of that big Stanford stadium
filled with happy folks —the organized
rooting of the rival rooting sections,
and the stunts that will be pulled off
are well worth the time and trouble
i of the Big Game.

make no mistake about that. The race
next year should be a corker.
As to the size of the score Saturday
—that is mere guesswork. There is a
lot of luck in football, so picking
scores is hazardous business. But with
luck breaking even, I should say that
California will win by at least twenty
one points.
Will Stanford score?
That's another tough one to answer.
No one expected Stanford to score last
year, yet Toomey fumbled the kick
off, a Stanford man recovered the ball
and Art Wilcox went over for Stan
ford's only touchdown before the game
was three minutes old.
Stanford must always be given a
chance to score so long as Cuddeback
is in the game, for that young man
has shown that he is a place kicker
of class.
But no matter which team wins the
spectacle of that big Stanford stadium
filled with happy folks —the organized
rooting of the rival rooting sections,
and the stunts that will be pulled off
are well worth the time and trouble
i of the Big Game.

I would like to say of the California-
Stanford game next Saturday that "It
looks like a toss-up and the team that
gets the breaks will win."
But I can't honestly say that.
To my way of thinking, California
is a cinch to win.
If Stanford does win it will be the
biggest upset in football that ever

took place west of the Rockies at
least.
California outclasses every other
team on the Pacific Coast so far that !
perhaps we do not give the other ■
teams due credit. Those who have \
seen the California team in action for
the last three years can't help but :
compare other teams with them, and
to the disadvantage of the other I
elevens.
The men trained by Andy Smith not
only excel as individuals but the team
work has been worked up until the
machine runs as smooth as oil.
Stanford will wrest the football
supremacy from California one of
these days—but not this season.
The Cards have gone in for football
in a big way by hiring Glenn Warner,
one of the most competent coaches in
the land, and he is assisted by Andy
Kerr and Tiny Thornliill, men of ex
perience and undoubted ability. Given
any kind of luck those men will pro
duce powerful teams for Stanford. But
California has a tremendous edge this
year, and class will tell in football as
well as in other lines of sport and
endeavor.
Next year California will lose eight
men, all of them fine football players
and some of them brilliant stars. Stan
ford will lose but three. U. S. C. loses
three. Washington loses three.
If California is to be toppled, next
year is the year to do it. But Andy
Smith has a sound system working at
California and the Bears will be a
well-rounded team again next year—
make no mistake about that. The race
next year should be a corker.
