# Big Game Will Not Be A Track Meet—DeGroot
## 
### 
The Stanford Varsity has been
amused at the articles which have ap
peared during the past week describing
tlu Big Game, and its foregone outcome.
No one gives us a chance; in fact,
many writers obviously avoid saying
anything about the result, spending most
of their time describing the rooting sec
tions, the clothes the women will wear,
t tc. Great stuff 1 But the Stanford
Varsity is only thinking about winning
the game, not about losing it.
We all realize that in California we
a:e meeting what is undoubtedly one
of the greatest—if not the greatest
football teams in the United States.

The old saying that the "best thing
about Stanford is California, and the
best thing about California is Stanford,"
still goes. Therefore we are glad that
the writers give California credit for be
ing the best team in the country—as
long as they do not give that honor to
Stanford.
Win, lose or draw tomorrow, every
pcrfon who attends the Big (lame is
going to see a knock-down-drag-out
football game and not a track meet.
