# BEARS HAVE BETTER OF SEASON’S SCORES
## 
### 
Comparative scores for the 1922 sea
son show the Bears to be decidedly su
perior as a scoring machine. Every one
of the Berkeley wins, except the "off
day" showing against U. S. C., has been
characterized by the large denomination
of the Bruin tallies and the smallness of
their opponents. The Cards, on the
other hand, have won four out of seven
games.
California began its third consecutive
winning season by taking the measure
«jf Santa Clara with a 45 to 14 score.
The fundamental weakness of the Bruin
squad was shown in this game when the
Missionites succeeded in making three
touchdowns by breaking through and
blocking Nesbit's kicks.
Two weeks later Stanford met Santa
Clara and defeated her 7 to 0. This
was the Cards' second preliminary game,
but Andy Kerr's outfit showed that it
could be a real football team for one
quarter at leaist and punched the ball
over for the lone touchdown in the first
seven minutes of play.
The first Card game was a hard one,
for the Winged "O" aggregation of foot
ball stars piled up 27 points to Stan
ford's 9.
California did not meet the Olympics
until three weeks after the Cardinal de
feat, so the month-old Bruins cannot be
put in the same class as the green team
which Coach Kerr sent out on the Held
for its initial contest. The Bears upset
all dope and- gave the Clubmen a 25 to 0
cleaning, stopping everything they sent,

even the slippery "Rabbit"
who figured so largely in the Stanford
loss.
Saint Mary's was California's third
, victim, and also Stanford's. Berkeley
! trounced Madigan's varsity by 41 points
1 and allowed no Saint to cross its goal,
j Neither did Stanford, but the nine points
1 scored against Saint Mary's were due
alone to Cuddeback's educated toe.
U. S. C. sprang the unexpected by
j halting the Golden Bears' large tally
streak. A touchdown, a safety, and a
Held goal were the best Andy Smith's
' growlers could do against the strong
Trojan defense. Were it not for the
: experienced California line, U. S. C.
would have scored, for they were within
j striking distance several times.
Stanford's first conference defeat was
handed her by the team from the south,
j That stone wall which had stopped Cali
| fornia kept the Cards from scoring,
; while a couple of breaks gave the Tro
jans a chance to make the only score
j of the game.
The two northern "Aggie" schools
both fell to the teams from California.
W. S. C. fell before U. C'..s attack and
went home at the short end of a 61 to 0
score. Stanford invaded the (). A. C.
campus and won a muddy battle by six
points made in a first quarter spurt.
On Armistice Day, California beat
Washington by a 45 to 7 score. The
Vikings won from the Cards, 12 to 8,
in a game that was hard for Stanford
to lose.
Nevada was the Bears' last pre-Big
Game morsel and lost a 61 to 13 game on
the Berkeley field. Two weeks previous
the Nevadans fell before the Stanford
attack and took a 17 to 7 beating.
All these comparative scores go to
show that Stanford is due for a 30 to 0
defeat, but the dope bucket never has

taken account of the Stanford Big Game
"Fight," a something which must be
reckoned with.
