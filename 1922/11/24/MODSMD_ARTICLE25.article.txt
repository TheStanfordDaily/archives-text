Berkeley, Calif., Nov. 24. —On the
California campus the average thought
of the "Big Game" is, how big a score
will the Bears run up? Supreme con
fidence in the 1922 Bruin varsity to
defeat the Cardinals is the feeling of
the campus.
Never before in the history of a
California varsity has the team been
supported in the same manner as the
1922 squad has. It may be typified by
the throng of 2,000 that gathered at
Berkeley station a week ago to greet
the varsity returning from Seattle
with an ovation that the men will not
forget the rest of their lives. That
something—sometimes known as "Cal
ifornia Spirit"—was expressed at the
aftnual Pajamarino Rally in the Greek
Theater last Thursday when the hills
resounded with cheers for "Andy"
Smith, Captain Erb and the rest of
the team.
The California campus may well be
proud of their team. Coach Smith has
welded a football machine together
that is the equal of the 1920 and 1921
teams. It has reached the climax of
its efficiency at the present time and
no excuse can be made for a poor
showing against the Cardinals.
It is impossible to pick stars on the
team. Erb, Nichols, Nesbit, Spalding,

Morrison and Dunn would all-star on
any other team on the Coast. All have
been playing great football for Cal
ifornia and all can play teamwork and
not individual games.
Erb, Nichols, Spalding and Nesbit
will probably start the game Satur
day. Morrison and Dunn will be sure
to get in before the game is over.
Bell, Burgess and Newman can be
called upon if necessary.
Muller and Berkey, playing their last
game at end for California, will start
Saturday. They are probably the
greatest ends California has ever
boasted of and will put all they have
into their farewell game. O'Brien and
Mell are in good condition and will be
ready any time Smith should decide
to take out the regulars.
While Witter and Beam have earned
the right to start the game it is sure
that "Don" Newmeyer will play at
seme time. Beam and Newmeyer are
seniors playing their last game.
Both guards are also seniors. "Fat"
Clark and "Jimmy" Dean have played
011 the varsity for three years and
will give all they have in their last
game. "Bill" Gallagher will start at
center but he is not enough better
than "Babe" Horrell to keep last year's
freshman captain out of the game en
tirely.
California is not undervaluing Stan
ford. They have seen the Cardinal
with his back to the wall before and
the Bear has a wholesome respect for
his fighting ability. The Bear expects
to fight but he also expects to win, an
entirely logical assumption when the
comparative scores of the season are
gone over.
