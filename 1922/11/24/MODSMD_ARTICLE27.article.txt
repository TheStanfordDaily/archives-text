# HOCKEY TEAMS TO MEET U.C. WOMEN ON STANFORD TURF
## 
### Mildred Dannenbaum, â€™24 
Five hours before the Cardinals and
Bears begin their fight in the Stadium,
the Stanford women will play the big
game of the hockey season when the
four class teams meet their opponents
from California Saturday morning at
9:45 on the Roble turf. The two hockey
fields make it possible to run off two
contests at the same time.
California has four strong teams that
have been working hard in order to be
in top-notch condition for Saturday's
hockey battle. The Stanford women
have also shown a great deal of en
thusiasm in their interclass practices,
which were held to prepare the squads
for the contest with Berkeley.
In the last two weeks the senior eleven
has developed speed, and ability to shoot
the ball through a defensive line. In
the beginning of the season the senior
women defeated the freshmen by the low
score of 2 to 0. Last Tuesday the
fourth-year team succeeded in tying with
the sophomore eleven, which, according
to points made in the interclass practice
games, is the strongest class squad.
The 1 ine-tip for the senior hockey
eleven is: RW, Carlsmith; HI, Robson;
CG, Bell; LI, Burks; LW, Churchman;
RH, Leonard; CH, Tegner; LH, Ken
nedy: RFb, Stern; LFb, F. M. Scott;
G, Clark.
Stanford and California have strong
junior teams. The Stanford juniors de
feated the freshmen by a 5 to 0 score;
the Berkeley juniors ran up a 9 to 1
score when they played against their
freshman squad. In a practice game
the juniors lost by one point to the sopho
mores. The third-year team has made
the second-best showing in interclass
matches.
The following is the line-up for the
junior squad: RW, Biddle; RI, Muzzy;
CF, Strobel; LI, Tamplin; LW, Jame
son ; RH, J. Franklin; CH, Roth; LH,
G. Franklin; RFb, Hull; LFb, Schardin;
G, Overfelt.
From the standpoint of evenly matched
teams, the game between the California
and Stanford sophomores will be the
most interesting. The Stanford sopho
mores have a strong backfield and a fast
forward line.
The sophomore team line-up will be:
RW, Watson; RI, Davis; CF, Harter;
LW, Meskimmons; LI, McKibben; RH,
Burlingame; CH, Strouse; LH, Learn
ard; RFb, Turner; LFb, French; G,
Rossariai.
Either the California freshmen have
an unusually weak team or the upper
class teams are unusually strong. The
Stanford sophomores broke through the
Cardinal freshman's backfield more
times than the two upperclass teams suc
ceeded in doing.
The line-up for the freshmen will be:
RW, Sneddon; RI, Hyde; CF, Morrill;
LI, Ebright; LW, McCall; RH, Tolman;
CH, Yredenburgh; LH, Tognazzini;
RFb, Thygeson; LFb, Brown; G, Green
acre.
