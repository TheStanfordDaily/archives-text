# STADIUM IS READY TO RECEIVE SECOND ”BIG GAME” CROWD
## 
### 
Tomorrow, for the second time a Big
Game crowd will pour into the Stanford
Stadium. The Stadium is ready to re
ceive the throngs of football enthusiasts,
the ticket bcfoths are in place, and the
ushers, ticket sellers, and police arc
ready to perform their duties.
A year ago there were many who pre
dicted that before another year had
rolled round the embankment would
have settled and the wooden seats would
have warped.
The Stanford Stadium is a Stanford
product. It was conceived, designed,
financed, and built by Stanford people.
Ground was broken for the Stadium
on June 1. 1921, and it was completed
and ready for the Big Game six months
later at a cost of about $206,000.
The Stanford Stadium, with a seating
capacity of 65,000 people, is one of the
largest in the country, Yale Bowl com
ing first. The Big Game crowd last
year was the largest body of people ever
assembled on the Pacific Coast to wit
ness an intercollegiate contest.
The old Stanford field, which was con
structed in 1905, had a seating capacity
of 15,000 when it was first built. At
that time it was considered one of the
most modern and up-to-date fields in
the country.
The plan of the Stadium has already
| been copied in the Pasadena structure
j The Pasadena project is similar to the
one at Stanford, except that ingress and
egress are gained by means of viaducts
under the embankment.
One end of the field is left open in
! order to provide adequate ventilation and
space for a 220 straightaway. The lack
[ of ventilation on humid days has been
i found to be a serious problem in the
jYale Bowl.
The cinder track around the edge of
the field was constructed from plans of
the late "Dad" Moulton. Moulton
supervised the construction of many of
i the fastest tracks in this country, and
the Stadium cinder path is expected to
be the scene of many record-breaking
races.
The general dimensions follow:
Depth of playing field below original
: surface, 23 feet.
Height of top of embankment above
i original surface, 36 feet.
Length of oval at surface of field, 562
feet.
Width of oval. 355 feet.

Width of track, 15 feet.
Width of straightaway, 30 feet.
Distance of nearest seat from center
of field, 173 feet.
Distance of farthest seat from center
of field, 415 feet.

The old Stanford field, which was con
structed in 1905, had a seating capacity
of 15,000 when it was first built. At
that time it was considered one of the
most modern and up-to-date fields in
the country.
The plan of the Stadium has already
| been copied in the Pasadena structure
j The Pasadena project is similar to the
one at Stanford, except that ingress and
egress are gained by means of viaducts
under the embankment.
One end of the field is left open in
! order to provide adequate ventilation and
space for a 220 straightaway. The lack
[ of ventilation on humid days has been
i found to be a serious problem in the
jYale Bowl.
The cinder track around the edge of
the field was constructed from plans of
the late "Dad" Moulton. Moulton
supervised the construction of many of
i the fastest tracks in this country, and
the Stadium cinder path is expected to
be the scene of many record-breaking
races.
The general dimensions follow:
Depth of playing field below original
: surface, 23 feet.
Height of top of embankment above
i original surface, 36 feet.
Length of oval at surface of field, 562
feet.
Width of oval. 355 feet.

Width of track, 15 feet.
Width of straightaway, 30 feet.
Distance of nearest seat from center
of field, 173 feet.
Distance of farthest seat from center
of field, 415 feet.
Tomorrow, for the second time a Big
Game crowd will pour into the Stanford
Stadium. The Stadium is ready to re
ceive the throngs of football enthusiasts,
the ticket bcfoths are in place, and the
ushers, ticket sellers, and police arc
ready to perform their duties.
A year ago there were many who pre
dicted that before another year had
rolled round the embankment would
have settled and the wooden seats would
have warped.
The Stanford Stadium is a Stanford
product. It was conceived, designed,
financed, and built by Stanford people.
Ground was broken for the Stadium
on June 1. 1921, and it was completed
and ready for the Big Game six months
later at a cost of about $206,000.
The Stanford Stadium, with a seating
capacity of 65,000 people, is one of the
largest in the country, Yale Bowl com
ing first. The Big Game crowd last
year was the largest body of people ever
assembled on the Pacific Coast to wit
ness an intercollegiate contest.
