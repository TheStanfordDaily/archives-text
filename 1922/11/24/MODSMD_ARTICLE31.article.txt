# HOLLISTER JUNIOR COLLEGE ELEVEN TO MEET BETTSâ€™ GRAYS
## 
### 
"Red" Betts and his Grays will jour
ney to Hollister Thanksgiving Day to
Play the Hollister Junior College, eleven.
Betts had planned to make the game
with the California Goofs the last of
the season for his team, but the Grays
are anxious to play together again and
the invitation froin Hollister was ac
cepted. .
Regardless of tlr* strength of the Hol
lister lads, C oach Betts is counting on
winning the Thanksgiving Day tussle.
And he has a perfect right to put his
confidence in the team, for the Grays
played the best football they have ex
hibited this season against the California
Goofs.
If all the regulars arc able to make
the trip, the team will probably line up
as it did in the California game. Johnny
Williams, who hurt his arm in the game
with the Goofs, and has been carrying
it in a sling ever since, will probably be
in shape to go in at center. If Williams
is unable to play, Dunbar will get the
call. Captain "Tubby" Hays and A1
Rogers will start at the guard positions
with "Tubby" Crawford ready to go
in any time. Long and McComhs will
undoubtedly be Betts* choices for the
tackle positions, with Widaman and
Black or Robinson at end.
"Dope" Fuller, the fiery quarterback,
will be in his regular position calling
signals. Erhorn and Hamilton will start
at halves and Woodhead at full. Tf
Bob Wright, the big fellow who had
been going so well until he hurt his
ankle in the game with the U. S. S. Cam
den, is in shape, he will probably start
the game in the fullback position.
