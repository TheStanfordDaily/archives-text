# POWER FORMS BASIS OF FAMOUS WARNER SYSEM
## 
### Maxwell Stiles, ’25 
POWER!
That, in the words of Coach Andy
Kerr, is the very essence of the Glenn
Warner system which he is introducing
in Stanford's football curriculum. Power,
"Sixty minutes of fight," and work the
whole year round in order to be in con
dition to fight at all times. Learn the
fundamentals of the game thoroughly.
Play close formations, but do not hesi
tate to be progressive.
That, folks, is the much-talked of,
though little understood, "Pop" Warner
system. Having much in common with
other systems, there is so very little to
distinguish it in the eye of the casual
observer that the public as a whole
knows very little about it. The Warner
system! Ah, yes, that's a great system
of football! It made Carlisle and Pitt
famous. 'S a great system.
But ask the bug what the Glenn War
ner system is and all you will get is a
wheeze, a cough and a shrug of the
shoulders.
"The Warner system, as I see it, is
very little different from any other sys
tem." explained Andy. "It's football,
good, sound football. We may use our
men a little differently, or work our
plays a little differently—but not much.
Anyway, .1 couldn't go into details as
regards to that. The best coaches in
the country have been trying in vain to
get wise to that part of the Warner
system for the past twenty years. You
can't expect me to give it all away to a
newspaper man, can you?"
We admitted that we could not. How
ever, a little further questioning was
rewarded.
"The Warner system is based on the
fundamentals of football. We do not
take a bunch of green men and expect
them to learn everything in a day. Our
teams develop very slowly when the
material to start with is green. We
teach the boys football step by step,
concentrating first on defense and then
delving into the mysteries of offensive
football as the men progress. We want
to make sure that every man knows

thoroughly everything relative to every
step we take. Therefore, we do nut
turn out high-power teams overnight.
"But give me a bunch of men who
know the fundamentals, who are not
green, and I'll show you how long it
takes to urn out a great team.
"Warner uses close formations and
the unbalanced line. He shuffles his
men about so as to yet the most POWER
into every play. Every man counts for
something. *
"Warner sticks to straight football
when he is able. During the past few
years the Pittsburgh team has stuck to
straight football, as they call it, and has
made a great record. They have not
been forced to play on open game, be
cause they were men who had the
power to plow their way to victory.
"But this year Glenn Warner is doing
more passing and more kicking than he
ever did in his life before. Don't let
'em tell you that Warner does not be
lieve in the forward pass or kicking for
the breaks. He does. He believes in
that if you haven't got the men who can
win on straight football. Why should
you run the risk of having a pass inter
cepted when you can win a game by
packing the ball through the line? But
when you can't win that way, open up.
This year Warner has been forced to
pass and kick because his team 110 longer
can win by other methods.
"In other words, Warner plays that
style of game which is best fitted to his
present material. He is the most pro
gressive coach in the country."
Warner's system differs from that of
Andy Smith in that Warner plays as
Kerr tells above, while Smith plays an
open, passing, kicking game at all times.
If his men lack the natural ability to
pass and kick and take advantage of the
breaks, Andy Smith rises up to his full
height, rubs the magic lamp and—presto!
they develop this ability in short order.
Tomorrow's game will be 110 fair cri
terion on which to judge the merits of
the two systems. Andy Smith's men
have been raised in his system for six
years!

"But this year Glenn Warner is doing
more passing and more kicking than he
ever did in his life before. Don't let

Warner's system differs from that of
Andy Smith in that Warner plays as
Kerr tells above, while Smith plays an
open, passing, kicking game at all times.

POWER!
That, in the words of Coach Andy
Kerr, is the very essence of the Glenn
Warner system which he is introducing
in Stanford's football curriculum. Power,
"Sixty minutes of fight," and work the
whole year round in order to be in con
dition to fight at all times. Learn the
fundamentals of the game thoroughly.
Play close formations, but do not hesi
tate to be progressive.
That, folks, is the much-talked of,
though little understood, "Pop" Warner
system. Having much in common with
other systems, there is so very little to
distinguish it in the eye of the casual
observer that the public as a whole
knows very little about it. The Warner
system! Ah, yes, that's a great system
of football! It made Carlisle and Pitt
famous. 'S a great system.

ner system is and all you will get is a
wheeze, a cough and a shrug of the

"The Warner system, as I see it, is
very little different from any other sys

good, sound football. We may use our
men a little differently, or work our
plays a little differently—but not much.
Anyway, .1 couldn't go into details as
regards to that. The best coaches in
the country have been trying in vain to
get wise to that part of the Warner
system for the past twenty years. You
can't expect me to give it all away to a
newspaper man, can you?"
We admitted that we could not. How
ever, a little further questioning was
rewarded.
"The Warner system is based on the
fundamentals of football. We do not
take a bunch of green men and expect
them to learn everything in a day. Our
teams develop very slowly when the
material to start with is green. We
teach the boys football step by step,
concentrating first on defense and then
delving into the mysteries of offensive
football as the men progress. We want
to make sure that every man knows

thoroughly everything relative to every
step we take. Therefore, we do nut
turn out high-power teams overnight.
"But give me a bunch of men who
know the fundamentals, who are not
green, and I'll show you how long it
takes to urn out a great team.
"Warner uses close formations and
the unbalanced line. He shuffles his
men about so as to yet the most POWER
into every play. Every man counts for
something. *
"Warner sticks to straight football
when he is able. During the past few
years the Pittsburgh team has stuck to
straight football, as they call it, and has
made a great record. They have not
