# HEAVY NOSE-GUARDS NOT NECESSARY IN FOOTBALL OF TODAY
## 
### 
Football as it is played now is con
siderably different from the game played
by the first Stanford teams. When the
players stepped on the field they were
heavily padded on elbows and shins as
well as the shoulders. They wore big
head-guards and large rubber nose
guards, which nearly smothered them,
and successfully concealed the identity
of the individual. But the men needed
the protection of this additional weight.
Instead of four downs in which to make
ten yards and first down, the rules called
for three downs in which to make five
yards. To do this line plays were used
exclusively and a wedge attack with
three-man interference was the vogue.
When American football was again
started at Stanford in 1918 a new style
of play had developed. The forward
pass, never used in a game of football
as "it used to be played," played a promi
nent part, and end runs with criss
crosses were adopted to open up the
play.
Bleacher stunts have also developed
with time. At the dedication of the
wooden bleachers, in 1905, a block "S"
was formed, the first appearance of in
tricate bleacher stunts in the West.
