# CARDS, BEARS MEET THIS AFTERNOON IN CROSS-COUNTRY RACE
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton left for
Berkeley today with a squad of fifteen
men, which he entered in the annual
Stanford-California cross-country race
this afternoon.
A new route has been laid out at
Berkeley for the distance runners. The
course is set around the edge of the
California campus and is a mile around.
The race will consist of four one-mile
laps.
Walt Christie's men easily won the
cross-country run last year, but "Dink"
has a strong squad this time and expects
the Stanford runners to make a better
showing.
A1 Smith, 880-yard and mile runner
from the 1925 freshman track team, is
probably the best man on the Cardinal
squad and should make a strong bid for
iirst place. A1 Charles and "Pat" Mur
phy, who put on a pretty race in the
mile last year against the California
freshmen, should also be near the front,
Holland arc two others whom Templeton
Smith step to keep ahead. Gurley and
Holland are two others who Templeton
expects to make good bids for places.
The entire squad has been working
out daily on the course back of the
campus and all the men are in the best
of shape, which seems to indicate that
upsets are not altogether impossible.
The following men made the trip to
Berkeley: Charles, French, Murphy,
Starr, Thayer, Todd, Smith, Macintosh,
Bertrand, Marcus, Hayashi, Holland,
Gurley, Liljenstein, and Hayes.
