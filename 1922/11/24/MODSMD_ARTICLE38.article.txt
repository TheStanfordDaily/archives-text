# RADIO REPORTS OF BIG GAME WILL BE HEARD OVER STATE
## 
### 
Results of the Big Game Saturday
will be broadcasted play by play from
a station set up in the Stadium by the
Electrical Engineering department. H.
A. Greene, '23, is in charge of the sta
tion, and H. E. Overacker, '22, as tech
nician, will handle the mechanical end
of the station.
The equipment which will be used is
owned and operated entirely by the Elec
trical Engineering department, under the
supervision of students.
The broadcasting apparatus has a
power of 250 watts and a wave length
of 460 meters. The majority of broad
casting stations are only allowed to have
a 316-meter wave length/ .
Permission to operate the station was
obtained from the State Radio Inspec
tor. An application for a Limited Com
mercial License has been filed in order
that the local station will be able to op
erate on the same basis as others in the
vicinity.
Parts of the game last Saturday were
broadcasted and more than a hundred
letters have been received from those
who got the messages. The local sta
tion was heard as far away as Syra
cuse, Nebraska, Santa Fe, N. M., and
British Columbia.
In reply to these letters, the local sta
tion has gotten out circular letters which
outline its purposes as follows: To aid
inter-university communication, to broad
cast lectures of general interest, and to
broadcast news for the alumni and peo
ple interested in the University.
Arrangements for broadcasting the re
sults of the Big Game are novel, in that
a man will be stationed on the sidelines
and will talk into a transmitter as the
game progresses. From the transmitter
at the field the messages will be sent
directly through the Radio Station at
the rear of the High Voltage Labora
tory to the waiting alumni all over the
state.
