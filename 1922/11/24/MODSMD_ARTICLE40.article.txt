# COACHES WERE FROM YALE IN EARLY DAYS
## 
### 
In the first nine years of football at
Stanford a Yale man was head coach,
with the exception of 1897, when G. P.
Brooke of Pennsylvania was coach.
That year Stanford lost to California,
28-0. The year before Stanford met its
first "Big Game" defeat, 20-0, with H. P.
Cross of Yale as coach. All the other
games were tie games or victories.
