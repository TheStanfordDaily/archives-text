The Stanford first line defense as it will probably take the field tomor
row. The men are: Mertz,leftend; Shipkey, left tackle; Cravens, left guard;
Baker, center; Faville, right guard; Johnston, right tackle; Lawson, right end.


Kerr's backfield quartet may surprise some of the critics who keep insist
ing that Stanford has a weak offense. All of them are good ground-gainers.
From left to right they are: Rae Doughty, right half; Bud Woodward, quar
ter; Murray Cuddeback, fullback; Art Wilcox, left half.
