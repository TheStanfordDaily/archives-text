# GAME TOMORROW TO BREAK TIE RECORD
## Stanford And California Each Present List of Seven Wins With Four Undecided 
### 
From the beginning of football rela
tions with California in 1891, when the
first "Big Game" was played, Stanford
and the Hears have struggled through to
a tie record with seven victories to the
credit of each institution. Four times
have the contests ended in a tie score.
Saturday's game will break this tie, no
matter which team wins, and a victory
for the Cardinals will end a string of
three successes for the Golden Bears.
In the fall of 1891, the year in which
Stanford was founded, with R. L. Por
ter of Yale as the Cardinal coach, Cali
fornia suffered her first defeat at the
hands of her now-ancient rivals by a
score of 14-10. The following year
Walter Camp, also of Yale and at pres
ent the greatest authority on the com
parative ability of American football
players, undertook the coaching job at
the University. His team fought Cali
fornia to a 10-10 tie. In 1893 another
Yale man, "Pop" Bliss, carried Stanford
to a tie game with the Bruins, this time
with a 6-6 score. Camp returned for
the next two years; and his team won
from California in 1894 and duplicated
Bliss* accomplishment the next year.
In 1898 the Stanford Varsity suffered
its first "Big Game" defeat, and the vic
tory lay now with one team and now
with another for the succeeding years
Then came J. F. Lanagan, '00, as coach
and with him a scries of victories. In
1903 another tie score was recorded, but
the next year the Cardinals came j
through with a hard-fought and well
earned win by a score of 18-0.
With the growing popularity of Amer
ican football, which had been played
each year since the founding of the Uni
versity. a larger demand for bleachers
was evident.
The team dedicated the new stands
with a 12-5 win over California in the
last game of American football between
the two universities until 1918.
From 1906 to 1915 rugby games took
tlit place of the American football
games and in the seven years they were
played a> "Big Games," Stanford took
three and California three, with one tie.
In 1918. soon after the armistice was
signed, Stanford announced an Ameri
can football schedule, which included a
game with the Bruins, but the results
were not written in the records because
the team had practiced for only two
weeks before the game and was com
posed of men in the training school on
the campus without regard to eligibility
rules. The 1919 game went to the Blue
and Gold, 14-0, in as fiercely contested
a game as has been ever witnessed at
Stanford. But the best efforts of Bob
Evans' team were repulsed and Cali
fornia won out. Under Walter Powell,
in 1920. the team was again beaten by
the Bears, suffering a 38-0 defeat. Last
year the Varsity was overcome, 42-7, at
the dedication of the new Stadium, seat
ing 65,000, as compared to the structure
of 1905, which seated under 20,000.
What Coach Andy Kerr and the Warner
system can do to California will be told
tomorrow and in the years to come.

tory lay now with one team and now
with another for the succeeding years
Then came J. F. Lanagan, '00, as coach
and with him a scries of victories. In
1903 another tie score was recorded, but
the next year the Cardinals came j
through with a hard-fought and well
earned win by a score of 18-0.
With the growing popularity of Amer
ican football, which had been played
each year since the founding of the Uni
versity. a larger demand for bleachers
was evident.
The team dedicated the new stands
with a 12-5 win over California in the
last game of American football between
the two universities until 1918.
From 1906 to 1915 rugby games took
tlit place of the American football
games and in the seven years they were
played a> "Big Games," Stanford took
three and California three, with one tie.
In 1918. soon after the armistice was
signed, Stanford announced an Ameri
can football schedule, which included a
game with the Bruins, but the results
were not written in the records because
the team had practiced for only two
weeks before the game and was com
posed of men in the training school on
the campus without regard to eligibility
rules. The 1919 game went to the Blue
and Gold, 14-0, in as fiercely contested
a game as has been ever witnessed at
Stanford. But the best efforts of Bob
Evans' team were repulsed and Cali
fornia won out. Under Walter Powell,
in 1920. the team was again beaten by
the Bears, suffering a 38-0 defeat. Last
year the Varsity was overcome, 42-7, at
the dedication of the new Stadium, seat
ing 65,000, as compared to the structure
of 1905, which seated under 20,000.
What Coach Andy Kerr and the Warner
system can do to California will be told
tomorrow and in the years to come.
From the beginning of football rela
tions with California in 1891, when the
first "Big Game" was played, Stanford
and the Hears have struggled through to
a tie record with seven victories to the
credit of each institution. Four times
have the contests ended in a tie score.
Saturday's game will break this tie, no
matter which team wins, and a victory
for the Cardinals will end a string of
three successes for the Golden Bears.
In the fall of 1891, the year in which
Stanford was founded, with R. L. Por
ter of Yale as the Cardinal coach, Cali
fornia suffered her first defeat at the
hands of her now-ancient rivals by a
score of 14-10. The following year
Walter Camp, also of Yale and at pres
ent the greatest authority on the com
parative ability of American football
players, undertook the coaching job at
the University. His team fought Cali
fornia to a 10-10 tie. In 1893 another
Yale man, "Pop" Bliss, carried Stanford
to a tie game with the Bruins, this time
with a 6-6 score. Camp returned for
the next two years; and his team won
from California in 1894 and duplicated
Bliss* accomplishment the next year.
In 1898 the Stanford Varsity suffered
its first "Big Game" defeat, and the vic
