# CROWDS BEGIN TO GATHER FROM ALL PARTS OF COUNTRY
## 
### 
Stanford is the host.
Fifty thousand alumni, Californians,
and just plain football bugs are the
guests.
The visitors began to drop off the
trains early yesterday afternoon, con
tinued in increasing streams today, and
by night should just about double the
population. Those who belonged to
living groups went to their respective
organizations, and. were welcomed with
open arms and hearths. The others
joined the scramble for rooms in Palo
Alto.
Herbert Hoover and Mrs. Hoover are
traveling toward Palo Alto, and should
be on the campus in time for the Big

Game. The Secretary of Commerce de
cided to drop statecraft for football
about two weeks ago, and sent his
reservation to Alumni Secretary Mc-
Dowell.
Alumni will be seated in the rear of
section C, and in B, D, and E, on the
Stanford side of the bleachers. Section
C is partly the rooting section. Many
of the alumni will be "in on" all yells
and songs, and to further this spirit
copies of the Stanford songs will be
distributed in the alumni sections.
The Stadium will hold, without addi
tional seats, 60,095 people. Starting at
11 :30 a. m., the Southern Pacific will
rush special trains down to the campus
as fast as the cars can be loaded. This
will mean that a five-car train will dis
gorge its load of humanity at the Sta
dium station every quarter of an hour.
Toward the last minutes before the game
starts the crowds will be pouring down
Embarcadero road and up the Stadium
steps at the rate of 1400 a minute.
Old grads are swarming on the
campus today, renewing old acquaint
ances and swapping old stories. Stars of
former Cardinal elevens—the names of
Reg Caughey, "Hero" Bihlman, "Swede"
Righter, Jack Patrick, Les Summerfield,
and Pret Holt come to mind—will be
in the stands tomorrow watching the
1922 edition of the Stanford Varsity. A
delegation of alumni about the size of
an army corps is coming up from Los
Angeles. Smaller, but just as active,
[ crowds have sent in applications from
all over the state.
From Madison, Wis., Mrs. Minna Kid
well Hotchkiss, '95, is coming to wit
ness her first Big Game since "pioneer"
days.
What amounts to one continuous train
will be in service to carry the crowd
away as it swarms out of the Stadium
after the game. By the time the last
train in the relay leaves the Stadium
station, the first one will be back and
|on its heels. These trains positively
i will not stop at Palo Alto, announce
I S. P. officials.
