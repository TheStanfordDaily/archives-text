# STANFORD AXE, SHARPENED AND READY, WILL BE USED ON GOLDEN BEAR TOMORROW
## 
### 
Dark blue clouds, clouds of defeat,
are rolling over the yellow hills of
Berkeley; cowering, spiritless figures
rush for cover before the impending
storm; a puny bear, yellow and mangy
where the gold has rubbed off, scurries
for his hole—and after him, swinging
a great broad-axe, comes a grinning Son
I of the Stanford Red.
Give 'im the axe!
Once more, wielded by the wearer of
the bloody shirt, the axe is the gleaming
symbol of a great and unconquerable
tradition—the Stanford Spirit.
Over at Berkeley there is a chunk of
metal, rusted and corroded from long
contact with slimy alien hands. It is
kept carefully hidden in a vault, and
dragged out once a year in chains, for
fear lest some wearer of the Cardinal
take it away and spank its trembling
guardians with the flat of the blade.
This piece of iron means little or
nothing to Stanford. It is no longer a
tradition, its dulled blade no longer
stands for anything, for it is no longer
more than some unrecognizable relic of
a forgotten day. That tarnished tool
has been killed as a tradition bv the
very ones who hold it; their policy of
concealment has made it little more
than a stale curiosity.
In its place has come a new weapon,
a keen, broad-bladed hewer of victories.
It is the Stanford Axe, swinging ever
closer to the neck of the Golden Bear.
Wielding it is a brawny Stanford Gent.
The light of battle is in his face. He
is a representative of the new era on
the Farm, when Stanford teams, fight
ing under the greatest of football sys

tems, shall crush California's Varsity
into the sod, and make of the Cam
panile a Cardinal flagpole.
The new symbol has more of real tra
dition clinging around it than the old
one ever had. The present Stanford
Axe was found in the historic Bret
I Harte country last summer by J. E. j
| Peterson, a resident of Palo Alto, who
has been connected with the University
since its founding. This broad-bladed
weapon probably belonged to some old
Forty-niner, who toiled with it across
mountains and deserts to the red sun
set of California.
The tool reposing over in Berkeley's
vault was brought out by some Stanford
fjnen in the spring of 1899, as a casual
adjunct to the new Axe Yell composed
some time before by Will Irwin. It
was taken to the old Valencia-street
baseball series. It had little more sig
nificance then than the locomotive bell
used in the "Railroad."
But when the Berkeleyans offered in
sult to Stanford by stealing the axe,
Cardinal spirt at once flared up. The
rising flame of indignation caused the
theives to run with their prize to a
government-protected vault.
Tomorrow the Stanford Axe will be
swung for the first time against a Bear
football team; its wielders re going to
test the blade on eleven men called by
certain press agents a "wonder team."
And they will be strong with the might I
of the Stanford Spirit.
Next year, in the hands of a veteran
eleven, the Axe will be used to dedicate
another stadium in Raspberry Canyon.
Then—
GIVE 'EM THE AXE!

government-protected vault.
Tomorrow the Stanford Axe will be
swung for the first time against a Bear
football team; its wielders re going to
test the blade on eleven men called by
certain press agents a "wonder team."
And they will be strong with the might I
of the Stanford Spirit.
Next year, in the hands of a veteran
eleven, the Axe will be used to dedicate
another stadium in Raspberry Canyon.
Then—
GIVE 'EM THE AXE!
Dark blue clouds, clouds of defeat,
are rolling over the yellow hills of
Berkeley; cowering, spiritless figures
rush for cover before the impending
storm; a puny bear, yellow and mangy
where the gold has rubbed off, scurries
for his hole—and after him, swinging
a great broad-axe, comes a grinning Son
I of the Stanford Red.
Give 'im the axe!
Once more, wielded by the wearer of
the bloody shirt, the axe is the gleaming
symbol of a great and unconquerable
tradition—the Stanford Spirit.
Over at Berkeley there is a chunk of
metal, rusted and corroded from long
contact with slimy alien hands. It is
kept carefully hidden in a vault, and
dragged out once a year in chains, for
fear lest some wearer of the Cardinal
take it away and spank its trembling
guardians with the flat of the blade.
This piece of iron means little or
nothing to Stanford. It is no longer a
tradition, its dulled blade no longer
stands for anything, for it is no longer
more than some unrecognizable relic of
a forgotten day. That tarnished tool
has been killed as a tradition bv the
very ones who hold it; their policy of
concealment has made it little more
than a stale curiosity.
In its place has come a new weapon,
a keen, broad-bladed hewer of victories.
It is the Stanford Axe, swinging ever
closer to the neck of the Golden Bear.
Wielding it is a brawny Stanford Gent.
The light of battle is in his face. He
is a representative of the new era on
the Farm, when Stanford teams, fight
ing under the greatest of football sys

tems, shall crush California's Varsity
into the sod, and make of the Cam
panile a Cardinal flagpole.
The new symbol has more of real tra
dition clinging around it than the old
one ever had. The present Stanford
Axe was found in the historic Bret
I Harte country last summer by J. E. j
| Peterson, a resident of Palo Alto, who
has been connected with the University
since its founding. This broad-bladed
weapon probably belonged to some old
Forty-niner, who toiled with it across
mountains and deserts to the red sun
set of California.
The tool reposing over in Berkeley's
vault was brought out by some Stanford
fjnen in the spring of 1899, as a casual
adjunct to the new Axe Yell composed
some time before by Will Irwin. It
was taken to the old Valencia-street
baseball series. It had little more sig
nificance then than the locomotive bell
used in the "Railroad."
But when the Berkeleyans offered in
sult to Stanford by stealing the axe,
Cardinal spirt at once flared up. The
rising flame of indignation caused the
theives to run with their prize to a
government-protected vault.
