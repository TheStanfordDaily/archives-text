# Ram’s Head To Present “Football Frothies” For Big Game Crowd
## 
### Carl Shoup, ’24 
A little bit of everything will be
offered a campus audience tomorrow
| night as the Football Frothies bubble
I and foam their way through two acts
I of local satire.
Burlesque in acting will contrast with
j beauty in stage setting. In addition,
Stage Manager Clyde Coakley, using
the largest force of stage hands yet em
ployed on campus productions, lias built
up a system that should show truly re
markable swiftness in scene-shifting.
Three Directors Coach Cast
The stage sets, as seen in the dress
rehearsals, are almost sure to score a

hit. The plot and lines furnish good
material for the cast to work with. The
musical numbers are above the average.
The only question mark left is in regard
to the effectiveness of the directing, and
that is a question that cannot be settled
until Saturday night has passed.
A tri-partite system of directing has
been employed in this show, supplanting
the one-man regime, which Les Seib was
able to carry through last year. Mollis
Chalmers, Arnold Bayley, and Sam
Mendenhall are the three who have
been working with chorus and cast for
the past month. None of the three are
veterans in campus directing, but from
tlit- appearance of the rehearsals, it
makes no difference.

##Jack Majors in Love

What unity there is to the show—and
by its nature there is not need for much
—is achieved by correlating the different
scenes into the adventures of Jack,
played by Jerry Powell, who transfers
from Harvard to Stanford and cannot
find what he wants to major in. The
unofficial registrar partially solves his
problem by having him major in love,
and from then on he has a difficult time
finding the right girl. From Javanese
temple to baseball light," from women's
pageant to bootblack shop, Jack goes in
a vain search for a girl whom he will
love, blind to the fact that Jill, played
by Dorothy Rominger, is already en
tranced by him. Finally, as the unofficial
registrar is about to give Jack up as a
bad job, California's new Stadium is
dedicated (this in 1924), by a Stanford
victory. Then, of course—but Dick Tay
lor says there are still tickets for sale
for those who want to learn how it all
comes out.
Fifteen Songs Introduced
There are fifteen song numbers in the
show, including compositions by C. W.
Midgely, Myron Higby, Clu Carey, and
Alice Dodds. Two of the songs, "I
Want to Major in Love," and "Blue My
Shoes," both by Midgely, will be on sale
during the show, at the purchase price
of 25 cents each.
The opening number is a combination
of the song numbers, "Froth," "Behind
the Mask," and "The Registrar." In

volving three curtain shifts, this trio of
scenes ends up in the office of the un
official registrar. Here is obtained some
comedy which is purely unconscious. The
registrar's clock draws a laugh with its
many peculiar facial changes.
Later 011 in the show Paul Clafiin ap
pears as Carnation, the high priestess
of milk; and if he draws half as hearty
a laugh from the whole audience as he
did from the few present at the dress
rehearsals last night, the noise will be
deafening. This will undoubtedly be
one of the high spots of humor in the
show. It is burlesque carried practically
to perfection.
Last night was the final dress re
hearsal. One or two more short re
hearsals may be held before the curtain
rises at 8:15 tomorrow night. Tickets
will be 011 sale at the box office next to
the Assembly hall tomorrow night after
7:30.

light from the bonfire lit up the west end
of the Pavilion, and students and alumni
arose as one man to hear the President
say to the team, "We have only admira
tion and respect for you and confidence
in you."
What followed is a matter of history.
The mad serpentine about the bonfire
with thousands of spectators looking on,
the defiant chant, "To Hell with the
Gold and Blue!" and finally, as the fire
died down, the singing of "Hail, Stan
ford, Hail!" brought to a close another
Big Game rally.
Licked already? Downcast? Hell, no!
