# “BIG FOUR” OF FOOTBALL WILL KEEP TAB ON GAME

While twenty-two football players
battle for supremacy on the Stanford
turf tomorrow afternoon, the four
greatest figures in football history in
another section of the country will be
scanning the results of the California-
Stanford struggle; always the "big
game" west of the Rockies.
Stanford has been particularly inter
ested in the quartet of mentors who
for years have held the respect of
every player who ever donned a cleat
ed shoe. Walter Camp, Glenn Warner,
Alonzo Stagg and Fielding Yost are
considered to be the "Big Four" of
football, and all have a particular in
terest in Stanford. If the wishes of
this group of strategists goes for any
thing the Cardinal rooters will have
cause to celebrate when the whistle
sounds to end the game.
About thirty years ago, Walter
Camp at the head of the Stanford
team, scored notable victories over
California. Not until 1898 did a Cali
fornia cheer signal victory over the
Cardinals. Will Stanford score on Cali
fornia? How many points will the
Californians run up on Andy Kerr's
eleven? These are two questions as
often discussed as the one put when
the question of a movie is up before
the family circle.
Back in 1894 when Walter Camp
wa s at the head of the coaching staff,
Captain Downing, right tackle on the
Palo Alto squad, blocked one of
"Wolf" Ransom's kicks when things
looked dark for the Red team. Coch
ran, the other tackle, was away like a
flash and rolled across the goal line
with the ball. Kennedy kicked the goal
and Stanford won.
It was in this same year that Alonzo
Stagg, now grown gray in the service
of his beloved game, brought the Chi
cago university team to the coast to
meet the Pacific Coast champions dur
in the Christmas vacation. This first
East vs. West contest went to the
East with Hirschberger, the great Chi
cago star, more than living up to his
reputation.
Newspaper accounts of the games
28 and 30 years ago indicate that there
was red-hot rivalry between the teams,
and one story reads: "there wasn't
more than the usual amount of slug
ging, gouging and choking," which
would lead one to believe it wasn't a
sport for delicate youths.
Then Fielding H. Yost came to Stan
ford and a few years later brought a
great Michigan team to the Coast to
win from the Cardinals. For years
after, "Hurry-Up" Yost was a name
to conjure with in football. Walter
Camp saw in the Wolverine stars
many of the foremost players.
The last member of the "Big Four,"
too, has an interest in Stanford. Glenn
Warner of Pittsburgh, rejoicing over
his defeat of the mighty Washington &
Jefferson team, will be awaiting the
word from his lieutenants as to the
Cardinals' strength against the mighty
California eleven.
So, regardless of any superiority on
the part of the Golden Bears, judging
from comparative scores, the big fel
lows of the football world will be look- [
ing for surprises in the test tomorrow.
