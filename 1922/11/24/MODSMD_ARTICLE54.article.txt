# LOST RADIUM IS FOUND IN STOVE WITH ELECTROSCOPE
## 
### 
A five-hundred dollar speck of radium,
about as large as a pin point, was lost
at the home of Mrs. F. L. Nitsche, in
Portland, Ore. The radium, which was
being used for medical purposes, had
been thrown into the stove with some
waste. It was recovered by Professor
Knowlton of Reed College, with the aid
of an electroscope, used in the college
for experimental purposes.
