# STANFORD MAY UPSET DOPE BY STOPPING ATTACKS OF FAST BLUE AND GOLD BACKS
## CAPTAIN DE GROOT WILL PROBABLY START AT CENTER; BEARS ARE CONFIDENT OF VICTORY. 
### BY GARRETT ELMORE, ’23 
O iANFORD has the greatest opportunity in three decades
of Stanford-California football history tomorrow.
There never has been, and there never will be, for many
years to come, a Big Game in which the Cardinal varsity is
accorded so little a chance.
California, greater even than in 1920, hailed as the best
eleven in the country, dominates the situation on the eve of
the contest.
Predictions and wagers are freely made that the Bears
will win by a record score—by more than thirty-eight points.
Stanford, its strength uncertain, with a none-too-impres
sive record, is denied even that "fighting chance" they talk
so much about.

Therein lies Stanford's opportunity. It can, by beating
the great Bruin eleven, even by a single point, accomplish
a football miracle. By holding the Bears to two touch-

downs, the Cardinals can
achieve a result scarcely less
sensational.
And Stanford alumni and students
believe that Andy Kerr's first Warner
system eleven, no matter what its for
mer record, has the power to hold the
Bears. They will continue to do so
until the scoreboard shows California
has won.
Captain Dudley DeGroot, his knee
still weak, has discarded his cane and
declared that he will play in his last
Big Game. Jim Lawson, contrary to re
ports, is eligible and will start at right
end.
For the past weeks, both elevens
have been waiting for tomorrow, doing
practically nothing in the way ot'
strenuous training.
Will there be a miracle, or will it
be the same old story of disappointed
hope? Washington, with a strong
team, thought it might be the eleven
to defeat California for the first time
in three years. Erb, Morrison, Berkey,
Muller, and the rest of Smith's veter
ans, made the trip to Seattle and over
whelmed Bagshaw's men.
If the Cardinals can tackle, clip and
run interference well tomorrow, the
battle will be even, for those things
are the fundamentals of the gridiron
science. The two lines average around
188, while the California backlield is
slightly heavier.
Can Archie Nesbit and Duke Mor
rison, mentioned for a position on the
mythical all-American team, drive
Kerr's men back to their goal line
with high spiralling punts? Art Wil
cox can average nearly forty yards
per boot from the line of scrimmage,
and will hold his own if the Card line
holds.
The Stanford problem is to stop the
broken field running of Don Nichols,
the piledriving charging of Duke Mor
rison, and the wiles of Charley Erb.
That is a large order. No team has
been able to do it yet, although the
Trojans came fairly close.
Smith's backfield is one of the greatest
scoring machines ever assembled at
the Berkeley plant; Kerr's secondary
men are good—and better if the line
can open up a few holes.
Mertz and Lawson are both over
shadowed by the Bear wingmen, Mul
ler and Berkey, but both are experi
enced. Kerr's other three, Dole, Jans
sen, and Thomas, are about as good
as the first two.
The rival tackles are an even break
if Shipkey and Johnston play as they
have all season. Faville and Cravens
at guards, and DeGroot at center, with
Baker in reserve, are the strongest in
"Tiny" Thornhill's pack.
In the backfield, Doughty will oblige
with end runs and dashes through the
broken field. Cuddeback will place kick
and Wilcox will punt, pass and hit the
line. Bud Woodward will direct the
Cardinal eleven.
The substitutions will probably be
as follows unless Kerr has something
up his sleeve: Dole for Lawson, Jans
sen for Mertz; Houck for Faville;
Pheney for Cravens; Baker for De-
Groot; Murray or Dennis for Doughty;
Cleaveland for Cuddeback.

the great Bruin eleven, even by a single point, accomplish
a football miracle. By holding the Bears to two touch-

downs, the Cardinals can
achieve a result scarcely less
sensational.
And Stanford alumni and students
believe that Andy Kerr's first Warner
system eleven, no matter what its for
mer record, has the power to hold the
Bears. They will continue to do so
until the scoreboard shows California
has won.
Captain Dudley DeGroot, his knee
still weak, has discarded his cane and
declared that he will play in his last
Big Game. Jim Lawson, contrary to re
ports, is eligible and will start at right
end.
For the past weeks, both elevens
have been waiting for tomorrow, doing
practically nothing in the way ot'
strenuous training.
Will there be a miracle, or will it
be the same old story of disappointed
hope? Washington, with a strong
team, thought it might be the eleven
to defeat California for the first time
in three years. Erb, Morrison, Berkey,
Muller, and the rest of Smith's veter
ans, made the trip to Seattle and over
whelmed Bagshaw's men.
If the Cardinals can tackle, clip and
run interference well tomorrow, the
battle will be even, for those things
are the fundamentals of the gridiron
science. The two lines average around
188, while the California backlield is
slightly heavier.
Can Archie Nesbit and Duke Mor
rison, mentioned for a position on the
mythical all-American team, drive
Kerr's men back to their goal line
with high spiralling punts? Art Wil
cox can average nearly forty yards
per boot from the line of scrimmage,
and will hold his own if the Card line
holds.
The Stanford problem is to stop the
broken field running of Don Nichols,
the piledriving charging of Duke Mor
rison, and the wiles of Charley Erb.
That is a large order. No team has
been able to do it yet, although the
Trojans came fairly close.
Smith's backfield is one of the greatest
scoring machines ever assembled at
the Berkeley plant; Kerr's secondary
men are good—and better if the line
can open up a few holes.
Mertz and Lawson are both over
shadowed by the Bear wingmen, Mul
ler and Berkey, but both are experi
enced. Kerr's other three, Dole, Jans
sen, and Thomas, are about as good
as the first two.
The rival tackles are an even break
if Shipkey and Johnston play as they
have all season. Faville and Cravens
at guards, and DeGroot at center, with
Baker in reserve, are the strongest in
"Tiny" Thornhill's pack.
In the backfield, Doughty will oblige
with end runs and dashes through the
broken field. Cuddeback will place kick
and Wilcox will punt, pass and hit the
line. Bud Woodward will direct the
Cardinal eleven.
The substitutions will probably be
as follows unless Kerr has something
up his sleeve: Dole for Lawson, Jans
sen for Mertz; Houck for Faville;
Pheney for Cravens; Baker for De-
Groot; Murray or Dennis for Doughty;
Cleaveland for Cuddeback.
O iANFORD has the greatest opportunity in three decades
of Stanford-California football history tomorrow.
There never has been, and there never will be, for many
years to come, a Big Game in which the Cardinal varsity is
accorded so little a chance.
California, greater even than in 1920, hailed as the best
eleven in the country, dominates the situation on the eve of
the contest.
Predictions and wagers are freely made that the Bears
will win by a record score—by more than thirty-eight points.
Stanford, its strength uncertain, with a none-too-impres
sive record, is denied even that "fighting chance" they talk
so much about.

Therein lies Stanford's opportunity. It can, by beating
