What the Toung ii

44 There may be something in this new art," you say, "but'l
don't get it; one modern thing looks as queer as the next to
me. What's it all about — what are the new men up to?" i
The Dial J
is the one American magazine to intelligently explain the mean
ing and interpret the trend of the new movements in art and
literature. It is the only magazine which publishes side by side *
— the best 'work produced by Americans ,
—the best 'work produced abroad
— the best 'work in traditional styles \
—the best 'work in the modern manner
in poetry, essays, criticism, and reproductions of the X
fine arts,
You know that in a few years certain of our contemporaries,
j whose work is anathema to the present generation, will stand i
out like giants. They will be hailed as great artists and geniuses d
by those who now lack the critical discernment to understand
j what they are trying to do. The genius of Swift, Milton, Blake, l(
Moliere, Ibsen, Shelley, Poe, Thoreau, Melville, and Whitman, J
i to mention only a few, went unrecognized, except by the dis
criminating minority, in their own generation. Dor.'t wait for
* the next generation to see your contemporaries in perspective, y
but enjoy their work now in The Dial, and accord them your "
appreciation while they are yet alive. H
In addition to the best work by the new generation,' The Dial y
I presents the finest work by established writers: Joseph Conrad,
E. A. Robinson, George Moore, Thomas Hardy, and Anatole I
" France, appearing side by side with Sherwood Anderson, E. E.,
y Cummings, Waldo Frank, Van Wyck Brooks, T. S. Eliot, D. *
H. Lawrence, and Ezra Pound. The Dial thus offers you the jj
1 unusual pleasure of comparing and criticizing.
