SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27.â€”Efforts
to determine whether the ocean floor
along the Pacific Coast of the Americas
is sinking, and perhaps reveal informa

and their causes, were under way today.
The government and the Carnegie Re

The destroyers Hull and Cory have
been assigned to take an expedition,
financed by the Carnegie Institute, to the
west coast of Mexico to take soundings
and gather data.
