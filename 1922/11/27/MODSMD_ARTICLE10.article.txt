# Smith, Murphy Are Winners in Cross Country
## 
### 
A1 Smith and Paul Murphy took first
and second in the annual Stanford Cali
fornia cross country meet at Berkeley
Friday. Murphy was ineligible, however
as this is only his second quarter in the
University.
Owing to confusion on the part of
officials, the winner of the meet has not
been announced.
Other Stanford men who finished in
the first twelve are: Charles, fifth; Gur
ley, tenth; Hays, eleventh; and Mac
intosh, twelfth.
The unofficial score gives California
the meet by a three-point margin, but
this may be changed when the official
score is announced.
