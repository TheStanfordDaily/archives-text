# UPPERCLASS HOCKEY SOUADS DEFEAT U.C.
## 
### 
Stanford women won two victories in j
the class hockcy meet Saturday morning.
Junior and senior hockey squads defeated <
their respective opponents from Califor
nia on Roble turf, 2-0, and 3-2; the Ber
keley sophomores won by four goals, and
the Stanford freshmen women lost their |
contest 3-2.
In the senior game, Captain Hazel
Churchman, left wing, made the only
point during the first half. The Berke
ley forward line kept the ball near the
Stanford goal, but Flora Scott, left full
back, who is the strongest part of the
Cardinal backfield, sent the ball out of
the striking circle and kept the Blue and
Gold women from scoring.
During the last part of the contest
Henrietta Peyser, left-inside on the Cali
fornia team, tied the score by shooting a ;
goal. Joyce Robson, left-inside and Vir
ginia Burks, right-inside, retaliated with
two points for Stanford. Almost imme
diately after these two plays, Maude
Barrigar, center forward for the Berke
ley seniors broke through the Cardinal
backfield and made the last goal in the j
game.
The fact that the Berkeley junior
women had a strong defense was quite j
evident when the Stanford eleven played:
the ball near the goal and around the |
twenty-five yard-line for the first half of j
the match and broke through the Cali- j
fomia backfield for only one point. Ruth
Jameson, left wing, made the first score, j
At the beginning of the second half j
Grace Strobel, center-forward, scored I
again for Stanford. For fifteen minutes !
at the last part of the contest the U. C.
women tried without success to make a j
goal.
The Stanford sophomores started their!
match with a rush down the turf toward
the California goal. They were stopped
by the enemy's skillful defense. Then the j
Blue and Gold sophomores recovered the
ball and shot three goals in about twelve j
minutes. The Cardinal squad was forced t
to play a defensive game most of the
time.
Berkeley considers its sophomore
eleven as the best of its hockey class
squads. The Cardinal forward-line did
not show its usual amount of speed in
last Saturday's match.
The Card freshman team scored first
in three minutes after the contest had
begun. Two minutes later the Berkeley
eleven scored. The Stanford fullbacks
came too far up the turf to stop the ball,
and consequently the Blue and Gold
freshmen made three goals in the first
half.
During the last part of the contest the
Cardinals made a rush for the Berkeley
goal. They broke through the enemy's
defense once, bringing the points up to
3 to 2, in favor of California.
