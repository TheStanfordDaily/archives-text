# CALIFORNIA SOCCER VARSITY DOWNED BY CARDINAL ELEVEN 2-1
## Franklin Scores Both Goals For Varsity; Freshmen Lose to Bruins 
### Louis Bucklin, '24 
Steady playing and bulldog deter
mination to win, last Saturday allowed
the Stanford soccer varsity to down
the California eleven 2-1 in the first
game of the annual series.
The Bears drew first blood at quar
ter time when Keyes, Blue and Gold
inside right, hooked the ball from the
Cardinal defense and scored from a
rather difficult angle. Stanford for
wards, despite the fact that they made
consistent efforts, could not break
through the Bruin backfield, and the
score at half time remained California
1, Stanford 0.
Franklin Scores Twice
But the second period told a differ
ent story. Charles Franklin, inside
right on the varsity, decided that Bear
meat was distinctly disagreeable and
almost at the outset evened matters
up with a Stanford score. Later in the
game, about five minutes before the
final whistle, Franklin scored again
when a series of short passes by the
forward line put him in an advan
tageous position. The game ended,
Stanford 2, California 1.
Coach Harry Maloney's men, while
not playing their usual flashy game,
used teamwork to an advantage. The
only noticeable time when the team
work failed was when California
scored. Stanford's halfbacks closed on
the fullbacks and prevented them from
getting a clean kick at the ball.
Freshmen Lose
The freshmen kickers did not fare
so well with the California freshmen,
losing their game 4-0. For the first
fifteen minutes the Babes held the
Cubs, but a lucky goal for California
broke down the Card defense, and the
Berkeleyites were able to cage three
more goals in the remainder of the
game.
The Stanford lineups last Saturday
were as follows:
Varsity—Masters (captain), goal;
Hayes, Clark, fullbacks; Swayne,
Howe, Walthers, halfbacks; Green,
Deffebach, Franklin, Quigley, Titus,
forwards; Elmore, substitute.
Freshmen —Newland, goal; Polland,
Campbell (captain), fullbacks; Devlin,
Franklin, Roodhouse, halfbacks; Espy,
Shillock, Schoon, Hocker, Richardson,
forwards; Motheral, Laughlin, White
head, Dobbins, substitutes.
