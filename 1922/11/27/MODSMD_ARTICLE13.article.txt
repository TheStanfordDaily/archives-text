# CROWD OF 55,000 SEES BIG GAME PROGRAMS SCATTERED FOR MILES
## 
### Phil Newill 
At 10:30 last Saturday morning, the Stanford stadium was empty and
deserted, its vacant seats gleaming in the morning sun. A few early arrivals
came up to the rim, looked it over, and went back down again.
At exactly 2:30 Charley Erb won the toss. There was a murmur, and then
a hush, as 55,000 spectators, who had been filling the huge bowl with an
expectant hum, settled back for the 1922 Big Game. They clothed the
sides of the horseshoe with a black-and-speckled covering, and except for a
few patchy places where vacant seats showed up, and the one empty section
at the open end, completely hid the wooden tiers.

Between 11 o'clock and 2:30, when
the last special train spilled out its
load at the stadium station, fully 50,-
000 people had come up Embarcadero
Road to the embankment. Some
brought lunch, some brought cushions,
some brought their children, and oth
ers brought only memories of other
years when the varsity had trampled
on the Gold and Blue.
Stanford was ready to receive them.
There were 170 ushers in charge of C.
M. Douglas, '23, stationed all around
the stadium, at the foot of the steps,
and on the aisles. Automboile travelers
were directed by seventy-eight traffic
policemen to proper parking grounds,
within easy reach of the bowl. Fences
around the campus roads kept persist
ent drivers from rolling right up to
the gates.
As far as "newsies" were concerned,
the district around the middle ticket
offices might just as well have been a
metropolitan street. There were 110

of them, all shouting "offishul pro
grum!" at the top of their respective
voices.
Seventy ticket punches, operated at
top speed by seventy ticket-takers,
punctured 55,000 tickets as the con
tinuous lines moved through the seven
gates.
Once on the scene of action, the
crowd took out its restless impatience
on the six splendidly uniformed "cops"
patrolling the rim of the stadium, or
sang snatches of old undergrad songs.
Then the kickoff. After that it was not
a crowd. It was bedlam.
At times the huge bowlful of people
was turned itno a roaring cauldron of
noise, and at other times you could
hear a pin drop—provided you were
listening for such things. The drawl
ing voice of "Bud" Woodward, Card
inal quarter, could be heard clear to
the top of the stadium as he called out
"Seex, Fourrr. Fi-eeve," and all the
ter started. A flock of Stanford sub
stitutes trailed on the field, among
them Wheat, Ludeke, and Campbell.
Wheat barked the signals, Ludeke
opened the holes, and "Scotchy" Camp
bell, his head lowered, the ball tucked
under his arm, tore through the Bruin
defense. Wilcox and Campbell were
making substantial gains where there
had been none at all earlier in the
✓
game. A fifteen-yard penalty helped
place the ball on California's ten-yard
line. The rooters on the west side of
the bowl clamored for a score. Cali
fornia held up under line bucks, and
Wilcox dropped back for a place kick,
since Campbell had taken Cuddeback's
place. But this same Beam blocked the
attempt, although Wflcox recovered
the ball.
It seemed as if Stanford had lost in
a race against time. Time-keeper Kla
wans pulled out his gun as Dennis lost
nine yards on an end run. As a final
hope Wilcox again tried a place kick,
this time from the thirty-five yard line.
His toe met the ball squarely. It
headed end over end between the two
uprights. Then with a thud it struck
the white crossbar and bounced back
onto the field. Stanford hadn't scored,
and the final reckoning was 28 to 0.
Every one of the twenty-five Stan
ford players starred—because there
wasn't one that didn't play better than
he had all season. But let the names
of Dudley DeGroot and Arthur Wilcox
lead all the rest. DeGroot, as gritty a
leacier as ever wore the Cardinal, did
what the doctors said was impossible.
He not only started the game with his
injured knee, but he played through
until the final two minutes.
Art Wilcox played his last Big
Game, and played it well. He kicked
on a par with Morrison; he caught the
punts without a slip while Berkey,
Muller and Beam rushed down on him.
He took his turn at hitting the line —
and he hit it hard; he did the place
kicking in the absence of Cuddeback.
He took the burden on both the of
fense and defense. And when it was
all over he collapsed, because he had
played on his nerve alone in the final
minutes.
Harry Shipkey, in his first Big
Game, rivalled "Stew" Beam. Shipkey
was everywhere on the defense, mak
ing sensational tackles. "Shorty"
Mertz and Jim Lawson were right
down on Nichols on the kicks.
Dick Faville and Cravens outplayed
Dean and Clark of the Bruins. Cravens
followed the ball well, recovering it
when Nichols fumbled, in the second
quarter.
Kerr sent in substitutes near the
end until Wilcox was the only member
of the original line-up left.
California's backs had an edge on
the Cardinal secondary defense. They
stopped Kerr's chargers right back of
the line, and Stanford's greatest gain
for scrimmage was eight yards. Mul
ler, Nichols, and Erb, together with
Beam, did their share toward the Blue
and Gold victory. California was —well,
just California, champions of the
Coast for the third successive time.
