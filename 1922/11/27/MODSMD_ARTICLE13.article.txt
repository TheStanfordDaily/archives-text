# CROWD OF 55,000 SEES BIG GAME PROGRAMS SCATTERED FOR MILES
## 
### Phil Newill 
At 10:30 last Saturday morning, the Stanford stadium was empty and
deserted, its vacant seats gleaming in the morning sun. A few early arrivals
came up to the rim, looked it over, and went back down again.
At exactly 2:30 Charley Erb won the toss. There was a murmur, and then
a hush, as 55,000 spectators, who had been filling the huge bowl with an
expectant hum, settled back for the 1922 Big Game. They clothed the
sides of the horseshoe with a black-and-speckled covering, and except for a
few patchy places where vacant seats showed up, and the one empty section
at the open end, completely hid the wooden tiers.

Between 11 o'clock and 2:30, when
the last special train spilled out its
load at the stadium station, fully 50,-
000 people had come up Embarcadero
Road to the embankment. Some
brought lunch, some brought cushions,
some brought their children, and oth

and on the aisles. Automboile travelers
were directed by seventy-eight traffic
policemen to proper parking grounds,
within easy reach of the bowl. Fences
around the campus roads kept persist

the gates.
As far as "newsies" were concerned,
the district around the middle ticket
offices might just as well have been a
metropolitan street. There were 110

of them, all shouting "offishul pro
grum!" at the top of their respective
voices.
Seventy ticket punches, operated at
top speed by seventy ticket-takers,
punctured 55,000 tickets as the con
tinuous lines moved through the seven
gates.
Once on the scene of action, the
crowd took out its restless impatience
on the six splendidly uniformed "cops"
patrolling the rim of the stadium, or
sang snatches of old undergrad songs.
Then the kickoff. After that it was not
a crowd. It was bedlam.
At times the huge bowlful of people
was turned itno a roaring cauldron of
noise, and at other times you could
hear a pin dropâ€”provided you were
listening for such things. The drawl
ing voice of "Bud" Woodward, Card
inal quarter, could be heard clear to
the top of the stadium as he called out
"Seex, Fourrr. Fi-eeve," and all the
