# FIGHTING CARDINALS HOLD BEARS TO FOUR TOUCHDOWNS IN BIG GAME
## CALIFORNIA TURNS TO PASSING GAME AS PLUNGES FAIL STANFORD PUSHES DOWN FIELD, BUT PLACE KICK STRIKES BAR 
### GARRETT ELMORE, '23 
It is a bad year for favorites.
The prophets picked California, leader of the great and near-great
in the football world, to annihilate, overwhelm, route, and otherwise
desecrate the Cardinal to make a footall holiday for the Pacific Coast.
Byt there was no slaughter; no rout; no debacle; no record score.
California merely defeated—not overwhelmed—Stanford in the
twenty-ninth annual Big Game at the Stadium Saturday after four
quarters of the best football since the classic of 1919.
THE STANFORD VARSITY WAS THERE! It dug its respec
tive cleats into the turf and fought—and the Cardinal fight made up
for many disadvantages.
The Cards hung onto the pigskin with a death grip; they followed
the ball closely; they tackled hard; they rushed down under punts

so fast that Don Nichols had no
chance to make his flashy runs;
they withstood the heavy batter
ing of "Duke" Morrison, Archie
Nisbet, and Dick Dunn.
But they didn't have enough experi
ence to defend their goal line against
invasion by the aerial forces. Archie
Nisbet, with high, soaring spirals,
drove Stanford back, and then Charley
Erb, the "master mind" of the Bears,
seeing that his backs could not gain,
through or around the line, called for
forward passes. The first traveled 15
yards from the hands of Nichols to the
paws of Muller, who ran another fif
teen to the first California touchdown.
Stanford came back and fought its
defensive game, which surprised even
the most hopeful of Cardinal followers.
Another break, and "Stew" Beam, who
outshown Erb, Muller, Morrison, and
the other stars, hulled his body in
front of Art Wilcox's punt. The Bruin
linesman picked up the leather, and
headed for the Stanford line, but Wil
cox brought him to earth with a shoe
string tackle. Three times the Bear
backs hit "Tiny" Thorrthill's line, and
they got four yards for their pains.
Duke Morrison, who had been rushed
in by Smith, carried it over on the
fourth down.
Again the Bears brought out their
main offensive weapon. Near the end
of the half, Nichols tossed a thirty
yard pass to O'Brien, who was playing
in Muller's place. Two jabs at the
line were ineffective, but Nichols drew
back his arm again and hurled a pass
over the goal line into the arms of
Spalding. The score at half time was
21 to 0.
Then, instead of weakening, the
Cardinal varsity got stronger. The
final half was a replica of the Stan
ford-Washington game, except that the
Cards did not score. Wilcox and Wood
ward frustrated Muller's attempts to
throw a successful | sixty-yard pass.
Woodward kept Wilcox, Doughty, and
Cuddeback jabbing at the Bruin line...
The California stone wall finally
gave way, after a fifteen-yard pass and
a twelve-yard run through the line by
Nichols had tallied the last score for
the Bruins just after the fourth quar
rest of them.
The new Stanford axe, symbol of the
great fight the Cardinal eleven was
putting up in the field below, was
brought out in front of the rooting
section in the second quarter and
waved defiantly at the Gold and Blue
square across the turf.
At the end of the half, after a series
of whistles and frantic instructions
from the rival yell leaders, the two
sections got under way with their
bleacher stunts. The Berkeleyans
spelled out "California," in gold letters
on a blue background, then flashed a
replica of the Golden Bear. It looked
like an ant-eater, but nobody minded
that.
Then the smaller Stanford section
came in. They attempted first a color
display with the "Skyrocket," but
something went wrong with the fuse
and the rocket didn't go off all at
once. The rooters made up for that,
though, by their spelling of "Stanford,"
which moved fast and without a hitch,
much to the satisfaction of Yell Lead
er Minsky.
Half an hour of grim struggle, and
it was all over, with the Cal rooting
section pouring out —or rather stum
bling out, for they were pretty weary
and not very pecunious—to form their
serpentine. And for a university sup
posed to be humbled, the Cardinal
stands showed remarkably little de
jection. It was a defeat, but —
At 5:30 the last two rooters were
straggling out of the field, grasping a
yellow and blue hat apiece. Said one
to the other: "Just wait till next year!
Boy, we'll dedicate that stadium at
Berkeley with a serpentine of our
own."
