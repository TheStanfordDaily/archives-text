# WHAT ANDY KERR HAS BROUGHT STANFORD
## 
### 
The greatest tribute that may be paid Andy Kerr
is that al! Stanford is glad to have taken defeat by a
four-touchdown margin at the hands of California.
This sounds wrong. At any rate it doesn't sound
like Stanford. The Cardinal under ordinary cir
cumstances would be drooping in melancholy today
at having been taken into camp by such a decisive
margin. But confidence in Andy Kerr and the
future, the showing of his men promises enough
to let prospects overshadow the present. Andy
Kerr and the Stanford Varsity of 1922 have laid a
mighty foundation that California and Andy Smith
will have a hard time shaking next year. But the
fact that students, usually impatient and short
sighted so far as athletic results are concerned, are
not only satisfied, but greatly pleased, is the highest
compliment a coach and his team may receive.
The story of how the Stanford Varsity of 1922
held one of the greatest teams in athletic history to
what in this college generation is a low score is
something not to be forgotten in a day. The ex
ample set by every man who entered the game for
Stanford last Saturday is one that Varsity men in
the future will do well to follow. In typical Stan
ford fashion they gave all they had—more even than
they knew they had. The whole of the last quarter
"was played on sheer nerve by every Stanford man.
'And it was in that last quarter when the team was
physically exhausted that the fight which has char
acterized Stanford teams since their first contest
resulted in that last-minute come-back that makes
the future look so good. The Cards used their last
ounce of energy in a valiant attempt to score and
were thwarted in their efforts only by a bad break-
A cross-bar seldom stops a field goal, but this time
when it meant so much, Fate intervened and the
Bears were allowed to escape with a clean shirt-
It takes nerve—more dian most people realize —to
go through the last quarter of a hard football game
against a better team- It takes will-power and fight
to force exhausted, pained bodies to the limit of
endurance against great odds. But Stanford did
it and California knows that Stanford did it. There
was not a man on the Bruin eleven who was unwill
ing to admit that he had just gone through the
hardest game of his life. When the gun sounded
the finish of the football classic of the Coast for
1922, it was an utterly exhausted, bewildered Bear
who shambled off the field. And it was a collapsed
Stanford Varsity that walked or was carried to its
dressing rooms. It will be a point in athletic history
that no four touchdowns were ever harder earned
than those that California took from Stanford last
Saturday.
The role of the losing coach is always the hard
one. Even when it is conceded by unbiased critics
that he is to lose even before the game starts, the
short end of a score is always the bitter one to take.
Andy Kerr took it with the utmost patience and
quiet. He had no alibis, no excuses. None were
needed. People could see for themselves what Kerr
had to offer. They did not see a hastily-finished
Stanford machine, but the rough outlines of the
Varsities of 1923 and 1924. They saw, not Kerr's
Varsity as a team for 1922 but the foundation he has
laid —the one he said he was going to lay. And
their confidence in Stanford men to fight to the last
ditch was retained in spite of the slow process of
molding such spirit into victory.
After Thanksgiving, Kerr will start where he left
off and build toward the Pittsburg game. In the
spring he will begin where he left off at Christmas
and next fall he will start in just where the last
work on the unfinished machine was done.
Stanford's football record next year will be an
interesting one to watch. And it will be all the more
so, knowing the difficulties under which Kerr and
this year's team have had to work.
