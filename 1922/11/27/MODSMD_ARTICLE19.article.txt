Cabbages begs to introduce two new so,ngs. One is
a dainty little bit carrying with it all the exquisite
sentiment of the Old South, expressed in the quaint,
wistful title of "I'se Got De Razor and Youse Got De
Throat." The other is semi-classical, and is inspired by
the famous photoplay of the same name. It is "Way
Down Yeast," by Fleischmann. It is a stirring song.

Before the Game:
"We are going to set up a record score for future
teams to shoot at" —the California Varsity.
After the Game:
"We expected a 21 or 28 point victory, and that is
what we got"—the California Varsity in yesterday's
papers.
We are glad California isn't stubborn and can be
happy no matter how things turned out. A disposition
like that is going to be an asset for the boys after they
get out of school. At that maybe they were right the
first time. Our friends across the Bay are going to have
to elevate their sights and drag out all the family am
munition to be able to nick twenty-eight points again.

"Do they have reindeer in Alaska?"
Pause to indicate rumination; further pause to re
move hairpin from eye.
"I don't know; but they have snow, dear."

I love to think of lovely fall
With all its colors gay;
My syllabus fees were very small;
That's why I feel that way.

Finals are just three and a half weeks away. Make
your "College of the Pacific" reservations early, as
there will be a big rush.
