# NEW MAGNETIC THEORY CAUSES SCIENTIFIC INTEREST
## 
### (By United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27.â€”Scien
tists here were deeply interested today
in the exposition of a new magnetic
theory by Professor T. J. J. See, astron
omer in charge of the government ob
servatory at Mare Island.
In an address before the California
Academy of Sciences he declared he had
adduced a theory that magnetic energy
travels in waves at the same speed as
light and its cause lies in the actions of
waves in the ether.
This force, he declared, has close con
nection with gravitation, and hence the
force of gravity is transmitted from
the plants at tne same rate as light.
The new theory, if proven as Professor
See said lie could prove it, would upset i
present theories of gravitation and have
widespread effect on astronomical
studies.
