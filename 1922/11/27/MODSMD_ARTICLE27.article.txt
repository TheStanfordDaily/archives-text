Concerning the viewpoint on Roughs'
Day expressed by Mr. Adelbert John
Buttrey, LD., who lives in Palo Alto, I
would like to say that things are coming
to a pretty pass if he considers that the
roughs are "sullying the fair name of
Stanford." The Stanford Rough is a
unique institution. One cannot say
whether he is rich or poor, Row or Hall,
good or bad, medic or econ, but we do
know that he is intensely human beneath
his semester-shirt. He is the one who
goes to the games; he makes up the
Stanford teams; he cheers the longest
and loudest (for he has no "fastidious"
friends to "shock" by such vociferation,
and he is a true Stanford man). He is
the backbone of Stanford, and surely
he ought to have his day to howl.
I am not trying to gloss over the fact
that there were things done on Roughs'
Day that thould not have been done.
There arc always a few who overstep
the bounds of proper conduct and cause
the majorltv to suffer, but as for the
fact that "decency and fair play were
submerged by the mob," I deny it. It
sounds as if the article were written by

one who wore a white collar. If he did.
he had it taken off. Maybe he had a
mustache. If he did, he had it taken off.
Even an old alumnus is for the tradition
—and the roughs. 1 like the roughs; I'm
strong for 'em; I'm one myself.
