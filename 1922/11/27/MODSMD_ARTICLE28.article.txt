# Theater Workshop Class Plans Elizabethan Stage
## 
### 
The stage as it was in the time of
Shakespeare will be one of the novelties
offered to the campus on December 15
by the Theatre Workshop class. As
complete a replica of the Elizabethan
stage as is possible and consisted with
the material in hand, will be used in the
production of the selected scenes from
Henry IV, says Director Bentinck.
Musicians will sit on the platform
and entertain the spectators in the pit
before and during the play. The stage
manager and his assistants in complete
Shakespearian regalia will shift scenes in
full view of the audience. Gulls may also
be expected to clutter up the stage and
show off their finery as they did centuries
ago in the Globe theatre of London.
According to Director Bentinck, some
thing similar to this has been done re
cently in Germany in professional pro
ductions of Shakespearian plays.
