# French Organist Will Appear at Assembly Hall
## 
### 
Marcel Dupre, who will give an organ
recital at the University assembly in
Memorial Church next Tuesday morning,
is famed as a composer of exceptional
merit. His cantata, "Psyche," won the
Grand Prix de Rome in 1914 and since
that time he has written not only for
the organ but for the violin, piano, and
orchestra. "De Profundis," Dupre's
armistice hymn in memory of the French
dead, was played at Notre Dame after
the war. He will give this work in Bos
ton this season accompanied by the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra.
At his New York debut last season,
Dupre improvised a complete symphony
in four movements on themes submitted
but a few moments before. This was
the first time the organist had impro
vised a long work in public although
improvisation in shorter forms has long
been a part of his concert career, as is
customery in the French organ schools.
Speaking of Dupre, an Eastern musi
cal critic said:
"In perfection of technique, clarity of
performance, variety of tone-color and
purity of style, no organist can surpass
Dupre. In the rare art of improvisation,
he stand alone, incomparable."
Themes for the artist's improvisation
are presented to him in sealed envelopes
in sight of the audience. Dupre exam
ines them a moment and then begins his
composition. H. T. Finck, the veteran
critic of the New York Evening Post,
describes this feat as a "musical miracle."
Dupre will include one of his own
works in his program at the Memorial
Church. According to the critics, his
compositions combine the scintillating
brilliance and color of the modern French
school with the traditional forms of
classic literature.
