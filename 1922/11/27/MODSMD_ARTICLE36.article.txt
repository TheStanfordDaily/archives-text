# PROFESSOR SCHOELL WILL LECTURE ON ACADEMY OF FRANCE
## 
### 
Professor Franck Louis Schoell, who
has been visiting professor from France
at the University of Chicago for the
past two years, will deliver a lecture at
7:30 tomorrow evening in the Little
Theater on "The French Academy of
the Twentieth Century."
Professor Schoell is a native of
France. He received his education at
the Sorbonne in Paris and did graduate
work at Cambridge University. Later
he traveled extensively on the Continent
and in the United States and served for
a year as secretary to the ex-Czar Ferdi
nand of Bulgaria.
During the Great War Professor
Schoell held a commission in the French
army. He was severely wounded in
action and was later captured by the
Germans and held prisoner for nearly
two years.
Since 1918 he has resumed his study
of French art and traditions, upon which
he had become an authority before the
war caused him to suspend his work
along these lines.
The lecturer is traveling under the
auspices of the Institute of International
Education, with headquarters in New
York City. He is delivering lectures
at various universities and art institutes
in the United States and Canada, and
will return to France in the spring to
resume a professorship at the University.
