### (By United Press 
NEW YORK, Nov. 27.â€”Twenty per
sons are injured and four under arrest
today as the result of rioting wherein
5,000 Irish republican sympathizers
routed firemen and policc reserves here
last night.
An effigy of King George was burned
at the height of fighting which was pre
cipitated when the police tried to prevent
an overflow meeting outside the Carroll
Theater, held to denounce execution of
Erskinc Childers and "murder" of Mary
MacSwiney.
The rioting raged for hours. Women
led the Irish "rebels," clawing faces of
policemen and tearing their uniforms
from them. The officers were finally
forced to withdraw and watch the dis
turbance die out shortly after midnight.
