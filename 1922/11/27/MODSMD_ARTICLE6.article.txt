# CATCHY LINES DRAW LAUGHS IN FOOTBALL SHOW
## "I Want to Major in Love" Is Hit of Frothies; New Songs Introduced Prove Popular 
### Carl Shoup,'24 
The "Football Frothies of 1922"
drew plenty of applause from a packed
he-use Saturday night, and showed that
an all-student performance of consid
erable length and width can closely
approach professional standards in
more than one particular.
First prize goes to the ideas and
lines which the cast was given to work
with. Some of the most spontaneous
applause followed on the heels of a
single remark or incident, as witness
the House Presidentess' exclamation
—"What a victory for the house!"
"Late Again!" Says Trago
Also, the idea of the gent who was
always "late again!" tickled the fancy
of those present.
The unity of the whole show was
just enough to tie most of the dif
ferent acts together. Credit for all this
goes to Dan Evans, who wrote the en
tire book and the lyrics as well. Some
of the latter such as "Pan-Hell means
just what it says," were so clever as
to outshine the music they were set
to.
Ranking right up with the ideas aud
lines was the music. "I Want to Major
in Love," by C. M. Midgley, was fea
tured throughout, and deserved it.
"Late Again," by Clu Carey and "Blue
My Shoes," by Midgley, won favor,
helped a great deal by the clever
way in which they were presented.
Alice Dodds and Myron Higby also
contributed several popular numbers.
The music as a whole was as good as
any the campus has produced for more
than a year.
Singers Are Wobbly
Before the rest of the bouquets are
passed out, what few criticisms there
are to make might be aired. The lack
of good singers stood out conspicuous
ly, both in the choruses and the cast.
The trio of House Harmonizers set a
good many of the customers on edge,
and Gene Trago, Dorothy Rominger
and Jerry Powell were the only ones
whose voices carried well out into
Row Z. The chorus work was weak in
many places, both in singing and danc
ing.
In addition, several scenes which
were good and one or two which were
not so good were dragged out beyond
the right length. Reference is had here
especially to the fraternity house
xroin */
scene and the encores in front of the
Union Promenade. The same might be
said of the orchestra act were it not
for the audience's evident craving for
music that night.
New Inebriate Introduced
"The Foam," as the main charac
ters were called, made a distinctly
good showing. Gene Trago had the
hardest part to put over, especially in
his lone song, "Late Again," and he
put all the grief and soulful heart
break into it that was necessary. Ed
die Waful paid particular nicety to his
part and evidently felt right at home
on the platform. He introduced a new
type of stage drunk —the deliberate,
meditative "souse," instead of the hec
tic arm-waver who usually overdoes
his loud shouts and violent motions.
Jerry Powell, despite the handicap
of a poor make-up, put fire into a part
that needed it, and Dorothy Roming
er's characterization of Jill was pleas
ing, as was her singing—in contrast to
many others in the performance.
Milly and Tilly, played by Arnold
Bayley and Delmar Daves were the
best pair of the evening. Bayley's
range of voice scored often, and
Daves' mannerisms and makeup struck
many sparks of laughter. Their voices
harmonized, and, like Trago, they
made the words of their songs easily
understandable to the audience.
The campus has seen so much good
■work from Helen Whitney that it is
likely to take it too much for granted
that her act will be a hit, and lose
sight of the real worth of it and the
work it takes. Her Javanese dance,
unique and graceful, was worth all the
applause it got.
Paul Clafiin and the team of Baldy
Quintero and Ed Harris drew plenty
of free and easy laughs in their re
spective acts. John Sansone slouched
along in accordance with all the best
ideas of what a prohibition officer at
least ought to look like. Bob Wisnom
and A. D. Cohan didn't have a chance
to show much, but they got across
what they did have. Fred Hughes wore
a variety of clothes with his usual
grace. Clyde Babcock, as Pop Harris,
made his first appearance on the Stan
ford stage, and although weak in his
singing, gave an otherwise realistic
impression of a shine purveyor.
Gasps of wonderment were wrung
from many of the paid admissions by
the agile wielding of the xylophone
ticklers by Grant Corby. His four-in
a-hand stunt was a remarkable exhibi
tion of sureness of eye and muscle.
This number, along with the Ram's
Head eight-piece orchestra hit the
right spot, as was evidenced by the
loudest burst of applause of the eve
ning.
The rest of the principals (there
were only twenty-seven altogether),
did what was allotted to them in an
effective way.
To the Bouncing Bubbles, the Beau
tiful Bubbles and the Pop Harris As
sistants should go credit due for
spending many wfiary hours practicing
steps and new steps and more steps.
A lot of chorus rehearsal is real work,
the results of which show up, not in
coveted personal notoriety, but in
group excellence without which a mus
ical show would be a flat failure.
Clyde Coakley, Chrysella Dunker
and their assistants had a huge job
confronting them on the technical end,
and carried off with practically no vis
ible hitches in the program. The "Jav
anese Twilight" setting will be re
membered for some time to come, and
if Pop Harris takes a hint from that
set in the second act, he will likely
find business requiring an assistant
cashier. The costumes which evoked
so much admiration in "Javanese Twi
light" were furnished by the De Recat
Corporation of San Francisco. The
radium-coated gowns used in the Pop
Harris fiesta had a good many guess
ing where the light came from on the
darkened stage.
Hollis Chalmers, Arnold Bayley and
Sam Mendenhall formed a triple al
liance of directing that for the great
est part performed efficiently, al
though it would be useless to say that
Les Seib is not missed. But Seib will
not be missed if the trio who handled
this show keep up the standard set
Saturday night.
