# CATCHY LINES DRAW LAUGHS IN FOOTBALL SHOW
## "I Want to Major in Love" Is Hit of Frothies; New Songs Introduced Prove Popular 
### Carl Shoup,'24 
The "Football Frothies of 1922"
drew plenty of applause from a packed
he-use Saturday night, and showed that
an all-student performance of consid
erable length and width can closely
approach professional standards in
more than one particular.
First prize goes to the ideas and
lines which the cast was given to work
with. Some of the most spontaneous
applause followed on the heels of a
single remark or incident, as witness
the House Presidentess' exclamation
â€”"What a victory for the house!"
"Late Again!" Says Trago
Also, the idea of the gent who was
always "late again!" tickled the fancy
of those present.
The unity of the whole show was
just enough to tie most of the dif
ferent acts together. Credit for all this
goes to Dan Evans, who wrote the en
tire book and the lyrics as well. Some
of the latter such as "Pan-Hell means
just what it says," were so clever as
to outshine the music they were set
to.
Ranking right up with the ideas aud
lines was the music. "I Want to Major
in Love," by C. M. Midgley, was fea
tured throughout, and deserved it.
"Late Again," by Clu Carey and "Blue
My Shoes," by Midgley, won favor,
helped a great deal by the clever
way in which they were presented.
Alice Dodds and Myron Higby also
contributed several popular numbers.
The music as a whole was as good as
any the campus has produced for more
than a year.
Singers Are Wobbly
Before the rest of the bouquets are
passed out, what few criticisms there
are to make might be aired. The lack
of good singers stood out conspicuous
ly, both in the choruses and the cast.
The trio of House Harmonizers set a
good many of the customers on edge,
and Gene Trago, Dorothy Rominger
and Jerry Powell were the only ones
whose voices carried well out into
Row Z. The chorus work was weak in
many places, both in singing and danc
ing.
In addition, several scenes which
were good and one or two which were
not so good were dragged out beyond
the right length. Reference is had here
especially to the fraternity house
