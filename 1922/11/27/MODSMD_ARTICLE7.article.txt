# Summer Art School Will Be Started in Palo Alto
## 
### 
A large summer school of art will be
opened in Palo Alto the summer of 1925
under Pedro J. Lemos, director of the
Stanford Art Gallery.
Lemos forces for Palo Alto a brilliant
future as an art center.
Carmel was originally selected as the
location of this school by a large art
corporation of Chicago, but the proposed
erection of Palo Alto's new hotel at
which teachers who would attend the
art school could be accommodated,
caused this city to be given preference.
"Palo Alto is rapidly developing into
a pronounced art center," Lemos said.
"With its proximity to the Stanford Art
Gallery which places on exhibition from
one to three displays every month, the
art lectures at the Community House, and
the new exhibition room to be available
at the Palo Alto public library, this city
will offer rare opportunities for artistic
enjoyment."
