# STANFORD GOLFERS TO MEET SAN JOSE COUNTRY CLUB MEN
## Felt Lake Site Considered As Possible Location For Golf Course 
### 
An eight-man golf team will meet the
San Jose Country Club on the San Jose
links tomorrow afternoon. The men
are Cecil Putnam, '23 (captain), Frank
Ditzler, L. W. Miller, Howard Chase, R.
M. Hirschman, C. A. Strouse, R. A.
Harvey, and Sidney Van Kueren.
A suitable situation two or three miles
back of the campus has been found for
the construction of a golf course. This
location will be near enough to permit
more men to play than can at present go
over to the San Jose links. All efforts
which formerly were directed toward
perfecting the clock golf course on the
baseball field will now be directed to
adapting the Felt Lake territory to a
course lit for playing.
With the construction of this new golf
course, the possibility of golf becoming
a first-class minor sport, instead of a
second-class minor sport, as at present,
is nearer realization. With no golf
course on the campus, few men bccame
interested in the game and those who
did play could not keep in good form
because of the few times they could af
ford to travel twenty or thirty miles
to an available course.
Golf was started at Stanford by Dr.
Stoltz. He attended to the laying out
of a nine-hole course back of the campus,
contributing some of his own money
toward getting the sand greens installed,
and some of the tar weed eliminated. In
the fall of 1915 the first Stanford golf
championship tournament was held over
this makeshift course. Cap Slade, '18,
won the contest, and L. W. Miller, pres
ent golf manager, was runner-up.
Owing to the difficulties of getting
financial support to make the course
really playable, and owing later to the
war, golf languished and it was not until
1919 that golf was made a second-class
minor sport and competition with Cali
fornia was arranged. Since then a
Stanford team has met the Berkeley team
every year, winning twice and losing
once. But the team which lost would
undoubtedly have made a better showing
if the members had had an opportunity
to play together and practice with any .
degree of regularity. Two members
played at Beresford and two others
played on the Menlo Country Club links.
Because the men did not play together j
they lacked the confidence in each oth
er's ability, which is just as important in
golf as in football or any other sport.;
This year a successful tournament is
in progress over the San Jose Country [
Club links. Thirty-two men entered the j
competition and only four defaults have
been made up to the semi-finals of the
tournament. Considering the distance of •
twenty-four miles to the San Jose links, j
it is easy to note the increased interest
shown in the game. |
From the thirty-two men who en-1
tered the tournament, Captain C. M. Put- j
nam and ten others have been selected
to practice for a match with California
December 2 at Berkeley. A six-man
team will be chosen from the number
practicing and will leave Friday night for
Berkeley, where the players will be en
tertained by the California team. The |
team stands a good chance of winning
because this year the men have played
together, although they could make bet-.
ter scores next Saturday when they
meet California if they had been able
to play twice as often on a course near
the campus.

this makeshift course. Cap Slade, '18,
won the contest, and L. W. Miller, pres
ent golf manager, was runner-up.
Owing to the difficulties of getting
financial support to make the course
really playable, and owing later to the
war, golf languished and it was not until
1919 that golf was made a second-class
minor sport and competition with Cali
fornia was arranged. Since then a
Stanford team has met the Berkeley team
every year, winning twice and losing
once. But the team which lost would
undoubtedly have made a better showing
if the members had had an opportunity
to play together and practice with any .
degree of regularity. Two members
played at Beresford and two others
played on the Menlo Country Club links.
Because the men did not play together j
they lacked the confidence in each oth
er's ability, which is just as important in
golf as in football or any other sport.;
This year a successful tournament is
in progress over the San Jose Country [
Club links. Thirty-two men entered the j
competition and only four defaults have
been made up to the semi-finals of the
tournament. Considering the distance of •
twenty-four miles to the San Jose links, j
it is easy to note the increased interest
shown in the game. |
From the thirty-two men who en-1
tered the tournament, Captain C. M. Put- j
nam and ten others have been selected
to practice for a match with California
December 2 at Berkeley. A six-man
team will be chosen from the number
practicing and will leave Friday night for
Berkeley, where the players will be en
tertained by the California team. The |
team stands a good chance of winning
because this year the men have played
together, although they could make bet-.
ter scores next Saturday when they
meet California if they had been able
to play twice as often on a course near
the campus.
An eight-man golf team will meet the
San Jose Country Club on the San Jose
links tomorrow afternoon. The men
are Cecil Putnam, '23 (captain), Frank
Ditzler, L. W. Miller, Howard Chase, R.
M. Hirschman, C. A. Strouse, R. A.
Harvey, and Sidney Van Kueren.
A suitable situation two or three miles
back of the campus has been found for
the construction of a golf course. This
location will be near enough to permit
more men to play than can at present go
over to the San Jose links. All efforts
which formerly were directed toward
perfecting the clock golf course on the
baseball field will now be directed to
adapting the Felt Lake territory to a
course lit for playing.
With the construction of this new golf
course, the possibility of golf becoming
a first-class minor sport, instead of a
second-class minor sport, as at present,
is nearer realization. With no golf
course on the campus, few men bccame
interested in the game and those who
did play could not keep in good form
because of the few times they could af
ford to travel twenty or thirty miles
to an available course.
Golf was started at Stanford by Dr.
Stoltz. He attended to the laying out
of a nine-hole course back of the campus,
contributing some of his own money
toward getting the sand greens installed,
and some of the tar weed eliminated. In
the fall of 1915 the first Stanford golf
championship tournament was held over
this makeshift course. Cap Slade, '18,
won the contest, and L. W. Miller, pres
ent golf manager, was runner-up.
