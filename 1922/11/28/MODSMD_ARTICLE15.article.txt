# Tomorrow Is Last Day Seniors Can Pay Picture Assessment For Quad
## 
### 
Tomorrow is the last day on which
seniors may pay their $1.50 assessments
and have their pictures in the 1924 Quad,
according to Carl Shoup, editor of this
year's book. Sophomore tryoutees were
stationed at the Engineering corner yes
terday and today, and will be there to
morrow to receive assessments. These
may also be paid at the Quad office up
stairs in the Administration building
from 1 to 2 in the afternoon, or from
3 to 6.
All seniors are asked to have their
pictures taken at once so as to avoid
unnecessary confusion the last week. De
cember 15 is the last day, but it will
soon be necessary to arrange special ap
pointments for sittings, according to
Shoup. Roble Club and sorority women
may also have their pictures taken at
any time now at Franklin's Studio.
