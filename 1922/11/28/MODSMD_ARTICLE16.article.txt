# ECONOMIC AWAKENING OF EUROPE CAUSED BY TRADE-PIRENNE
## Belgian Historian Traces the Period of Agriculture To Renaissance 
### 
The economic renaissance of the elev
enth and twelfth ccnturies which revo
lutionized the social structure of Europe
in the middle ages was analyzed by Pro
fessor Henri Pirenne, noted Belgian edu
cator and historian, who delivered the
first of a series of two lectures in French
on "La renaissance economique de
l'Europe au moyen age," yesterday aft
ernoon in the Little Theater.
Forces from without were responsible
for this transformation of Europe from
a sluggish era of domestic agricultural
activity to a circulation of commerce
between countries, Professor Pirenne ex
plained, describing the upheaval as a
product of history rather than nature.
In the eighth and ninth centuries, and
during the reign of Charlemagne, occi
dental Europe was passive, due to the
political lull. From an economic point
of view its civilization was purely an
agricultural one. In the words of the
speaker, the economic organization rest
ed upon "les grand domains," or the
great estates of landed proprietors and
of the church.
Extensive commerce was unknown to
the mediaeval world, which produced
only enough for local needsâ€”a practice
that proved to be both abnormal and un
healthy in industrial development, be
cause civilization could remain but rudi
mentary while working in this way.
That trade of any sort during the
Carolingian epoch was superficial, the
speaker proved by citing examples of
various local famines, occuring in
France during 880, which could not have
existed under a system of commercial
intercourse.
Constantinople, a great industrial and
manufacturing center, became the foyer
for economic advancement during the
eleventh century, declared Professor
Pirenne. The greatest city of the time,
it provided a trade interest, without
which the renaissance in Europe would
have been impossible.
Professor Pirenne gave the second lec
ture of the series this afternoon at 4:15
in the Little Theater.
