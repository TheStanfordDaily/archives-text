# FRENCH ORGANIST GIVES PROGRAM IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Marcel Dupre of Notre Dame Plays Group of Selections From Classical Composers 
### 
Soft tones and delicate shadings char
acterized the program which Marcel
Dupre, organist at Notre Dame Ca
thedral in Paris, gave in the Memorial
Church this morning. The numbers
furnished an effective contrast to the
usual organ recital which consists of
many loud and grandiose selections.
An improvisation of four movements
of a symphony was the most interesting
as well as most beautiful part of the pro
gram. 1 he themes of the movements were
given to Dupre just before the recital,
and he improvised eacn movement as he
played. Latham True, acting University
organist, furnished original themes for
the lirst and third movements, while C.
A. Fitzgerald of San Francisco suggested
parts of the Plain Chant for the second
and last parts. The symphony, which
showed no traces of hasty improvisation,
was blended together into a finished
whole. Jt was shaded from the full
swell of the organ to a low, barely dis
tinguishable throb.
"Passacaglia and Thema fugatum," by
Bach, was the opening number of the
program. It is based upon a theme in
four measures in the rhythm of an old
Italian dance. This is typical of Bach's
love for the purely mechanical stunt of
variation, for he made use of every de
vice of counterpoint in the scries o£
variations upon the opening theme.
The "Toccata." by Henry Purccll, who
was at one time organist in Westminster
Abbey, was an example of original treat
ment and was characterized by mellow
tones. "Noel avec variations," by Louis
Claude d'Aquin is a delightfully gay lit
the selection which shows the type of
French organ music in the eighteenth
century. It was adapted from a popular
song of Provence.
A particularly descriptive number was
Bach's "Chrisi Lay in the Bonds of
Death." Its slow, solemn movement
gives a clear picture of the progress of
the disciples as they carried the bier of
the dead Christ to the tomb. In direct
contrast to this, Dupre played "Chimes,"
by Einile Bourdon. This gave a pic
turesque view of a spring morning with
the French chimes pealing out into the
air.
A "Scherzo from the Fourth Sym
phony," by Charles M. Vidor, and "Pre
lude and Fugue in G minor," by Dupre
himself, completed the program.

contrast to this, Dupre played "Chimes,"
by Einile Bourdon. This gave a pic
turesque view of a spring morning with
the French chimes pealing out into the
air.
A "Scherzo from the Fourth Sym
phony," by Charles M. Vidor, and "Pre
lude and Fugue in G minor," by Dupre
himself, completed the program.
