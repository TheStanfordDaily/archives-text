# Fraternity Men To Turn New York Cliff Dwellers
## 
### 
On account of the high price of lodg
ings, New York fraternity men are turn
ing cliff dwellers. To meet the common
housing problem, the Fraternity Clubs'
building, a sixteen-story structure, is be
ing erected at Madison avenue and
Thirty-eighth street.
Members of the various clubs, nearly
all of them college graduates, will have
private club quarters and suites of sleep
ing rooms, but while they may lounge
and slumber under the Greek emblems of
their own fraternities, they will enjoy
the privilege of a communal dining hall
and gymnasium.
