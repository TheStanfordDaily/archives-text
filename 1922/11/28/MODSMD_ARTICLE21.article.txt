# THE 						BIG GAME IN VERSE

### 
A bit of college verse is reproduced in these col
umns today—the first college verse, in fact, that the
editor ever cared a whoop about. Biased as he is
against most rhymed rot about ravens and rills and
rig-a-ma-jigs, the editor cannot help saying that
his own editorial about the Big Game would never
have been written yesterday had he been in pos
session of these few lines from S. W. W. While
this is no polished gem of poetry, it at least sets
forth to say something, says it, and is done. That's
why it is printed here:
"Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Your light burns on, it cannot fail.
Your luster is tonight undimmed,
I he greatness of your heart unhymned;
With generous spirit did you yield
The palm to your guests on the field;
No greater victory could be won
Than your courageous work, well done.
The torch of valor from your red.
The justice of your white was spread
Through every play. At your fair gates
Today, stands guard—tomorrow, waits!
Your glory shines beyond the pale :
Hail, Stanford, Hail!"
