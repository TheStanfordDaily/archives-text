# THE
						RIGHTEOUS ROUGH
## 
### 
The tone of recent viewpoints 011 the Roughs' day
situation indicates that there is a strong feeling; in
favor of letting the Rough do just about as he
pleases. In the majority of individual cases such
a policy would be in keeping with Stanford's policies
in general. But the fact that the objections recently
raised came as a result of letting the Rough do as
/3ie liked is enough to condemn the plan. There must
be supervision of some sort. It need not be faculty
supervision—in fact, could and should not be while
:student government is in effect—but someone must
l>e responsible. Just because the difficulties now
may be attributed to a few irresponsibles is no reason
to suspect that the next Roughs' Day will not be
as bad or worse.
It is the editor's personal opinion that Roughs'
•Day is a darned good thing and, along with hun
dreds of others, he wants to keep it as one of the
few remaining traditions and customs. The Wash
ington's Birthday Parade is not far enough back in
history for us to forget the trend of unsupervised
student affairs of this kind. Let us, then, take
measures like all good men of typewriter exercise
fame and come to the aid of the party.
