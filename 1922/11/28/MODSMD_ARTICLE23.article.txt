# THE 						INDIANS AGAIN
## 
### 
Has Stanford taken over the name "Indians" or
not? Everybody is calling - us by that name, and
even the Stanford stunts in the ]>ig Game as much
as admitted that we are willing to accept the term.
The Indian who chased the Bear before the game
evidently was intended to convey some such impres
sion. If Stanford wants to be called by this name,
then let us get together and adopt it through the
regular channels. If Stanford doesn't want it, then
the same means may be used to get the opposite
result.
Last year, the team wore blankets with a very
large, very red, and very indistinct-in-the-distance
Indian sewed 011 to the back of each. This practice
did not seem to stick, but the sport writers got a
grip on the idea and it hasn't died yet. Do we
want it to?
Somehow, it seems that the two terms Stanford
and Cardinal cannot be improved upon much, par
ticularly if the interested party is a Stanford man.
And so unless Indian will add something to the
meaning of either of the other two names, it is hard
to see where there is much use for it.
