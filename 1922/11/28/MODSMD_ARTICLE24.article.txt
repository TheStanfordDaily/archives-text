# CABBAGES AND THINGS H.M.’24
## 
### 
It is thought fitting at this time to review in a hasty
way the literary tests of the campus, and for this pur
pose Cabbages is presenting a Complete Correspondence
Guide for Letter Writers. If your own need is not
found below, write us, and we will fill it:
Number One
(For the wife of the manufacturer of brass doorknobs
who has had a hangnail upon the left thumb for two
weeks, writing to her deceased sister's friend in Potun
ket who never ate watermelon till she was twenty-five.)
Dear Blank: (Insert name of deceased sister's friend
here.)
In the cognomen of the defunct sister and inestimable
friend who so recently passed into the bourne from
which no traveler ever returns, I request that you
inform me of the speediest way of removing a loosened
fragment of the hardened epidermis from my thumb, as
it has incessantly caused me travail of spirit and the
utter uselessness of that member.
Yours in suspense,
Inolo.
P. S. The signature, "Yours in suspense," has nothing
to do with the hangnail.—lo.
Number Two
(To the young girl about to be married to the tall
young man in the checkered suit, having a wart on the
right side of his nose, who belongs to the Free Tankers
Society of Brooklyn, and who travels for the Sears-
Roesbuck Company from the maiden aunt in a New
England village whose name is Tabitlia.)
Dear Niece:
It was with a sense of deep trepidation that I was
informed by reliable sources (the U. S. government, it
was —the postoffice department) of your marriage with
this traveling salesman of one of our large commercial
houses. However, your mind is probably fixed, and if
the folks are resigned, go to it.
Your aunt,
Tabitha.

"Are fish active?" cried the campus sage, crawling
over the string of cars placed on the path between
Encina and the Quad, "why, where is the man who never
saw a gold-fish bowl!"

"Committee Appointed To Investigate Drinking at
Army-Navy Game" —news headline.
One week later the tireless committee reports: "Com
mittee Finds There Was Drinking at Army-Navy Game."
After which astounding discovery they adjourned.

"They say love is blind," remarked Reggie the Rough
to himself, "but I'm darned if most guys don't see a lot
more in their particular girl than I can."

"Son," cried the venerable old man, "I do not know
•
you very well, yet I feel a fatherly interest in you. I
have just seen you take a drink of that terrible bootleg
from Dangerous Dan's. Son, you are on the road to
death! That vile stuff you have just consumed is rank,
raw poison. It would congeal the blood of a Malay
sailor; it would cause the heart to freeze in an Eskimo!
Son, let me lead you from the evil ways you are tread
ing. My boy" here the venerable old saint lowered
his trembling voice to a whisper, and, as the scalding
tears flowed down his cheeks at my wrong-doing, he
said, "I know where you can get the real stuff for five
dollars a pint. How about taking a pint now?"
* * •
Were you ever lightly tripping,
When you heard a garment ripping.
And you felt that something, slipping,
Slipping downward, inch by inch,
Soon would put you in a pickle,
If that safety pin, so fickle,
Didn't quit its sliding trickle,
Soon would put you in a pinch.
And you dash for home so madly,
Though men hail you, sadly, gladly,
You must cut them rather badly,
For the slipping's growing worse!
When you get home, somewhat flustered,
And it's found your belt was busted,
Quote you then, in tones disgusted,
"Oh, well, I never believed in these trick belts."

"THIS LOOKS LIKE A SENTENCE WITH A HANG
ING PARTICIPLE," REMARKED THE GRAMMARIAN
AS THE JURY FILED IN.
