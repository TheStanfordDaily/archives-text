Football is about through for 1922,
and except in a few sections, the grid
iron athletes are hanging up their
cleats and moleskins until next spring,
at least. Pittsburgh and Penn State,
meeting in their "big game" on
Thanksgiving Day, still attract atten
tion. On the same day St. Mary's and
Santa Clara will oppose each other for
the first time since the breach in rela
tions some years ago. If Pitt wins from
Penn State, it will rival Princeton as
the leading eleven of the East.

Now is the time for the "l-told-you
so" boys to come out, and tell how
they knew in advance the exact out
come of the Stanford-California tus
sle. As a matter of plain fact, there
are mighty few of them really quali
fied, for the result was a big upset.
The Cards played as they have never
played before, and it is probable that
even Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thorn
hill were agreeably surprised.

There wasn't enough difference be
tween the rival lines in the Big Game
to make it worth while talking about.
But Andy Smith's machine had cards
and spades and the whole deck on the
offense. The problem next year is to
develop a good offense and add a little
more defensive strength to the Cards.

Four members of the first string will
not be eligible next season. Wilcox,
DeGroot, Doughty, and Mertz are sure
to be missing when the call is sounded
next September. There may be others,
too, depending on how they fare with
their studies.

Archie Nisbet, who started and fin
ished at fullback for California, can
make the pigskin travel when he has
a mind to. He booted one more than
sixty yards on his first attempt, and
a few minutes later barely missed a
drop kick from the thirty-seven-yard
mark.

What would have happened had the
Cards received a break similar to the
one in 1921? There is no telling, for
they were going hard and fast. They
were tackling and clipping the Bears
in no gentle manner, so that Muller,
Erb, and Nichols were ready to stop
all activity when the final gun barked.
Faville, Wilcox, and DeGroot were
tuckered out, too.

From the top of the Stadium it
looked as if Wilcox would not have
had his first attempt at a field goal
blocked by Beam had the ball been
held farther back of the line of scrim
mage.
There is absolutely nothing doing
in the way of football at the gym
nasium and athletic fields this week.
Kerr gave everybody a vacation, with
training rules declared null and void.
The head coach is taking charge of
the basketball candidates for this
week. "Tiny" Thornhill made a flying
visit to Los Angeles, and is back on
the campus again. Beginning next
Monday the varsity will start prepar
ing for the Pittsburgh game with prac
tice three times a week.

iron athletes are hanging up their
cleats and moleskins until next spring,
at least. Pittsburgh and Penn State,
meeting in their "big game" on
Thanksgiving Day, still attract atten
tion. On the same day St. Mary's and
Santa Clara will oppose each other for
the first time since the breach in rela
tions some years ago. If Pitt wins from
Penn State, it will rival Princeton as
the leading eleven of the East.

Now is the time for the "l-told-you
so" boys to come out, and tell how
they knew in advance the exact out
come of the Stanford-California tus
sle. As a matter of plain fact, there
are mighty few of them really quali
fied, for the result was a big upset.
The Cards played as they have never
played before, and it is probable that
even Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thorn
hill were agreeably surprised.

There wasn't enough difference be
tween the rival lines in the Big Game
to make it worth while talking about.
But Andy Smith's machine had cards
and spades and the whole deck on the
offense. The problem next year is to
develop a good offense and add a little
more defensive strength to the Cards.

Four members of the first string will
not be eligible next season. Wilcox,
DeGroot, Doughty, and Mertz are sure
to be missing when the call is sounded
next September. There may be others,
too, depending on how they fare with
their studies.

Archie Nisbet, who started and fin
ished at fullback for California, can
make the pigskin travel when he has
a mind to. He booted one more than
sixty yards on his first attempt, and
a few minutes later barely missed a
drop kick from the thirty-seven-yard
mark.

What would have happened had the
Cards received a break similar to the
one in 1921? There is no telling, for
they were going hard and fast. They
were tackling and clipping the Bears
in no gentle manner, so that Muller,
Erb, and Nichols were ready to stop
all activity when the final gun barked.
Faville, Wilcox, and DeGroot were
tuckered out, too.

From the top of the Stadium it
looked as if Wilcox would not have
had his first attempt at a field goal
blocked by Beam had the ball been
held farther back of the line of scrim
mage.
There is absolutely nothing doing
in the way of football at the gym
nasium and athletic fields this week.
Kerr gave everybody a vacation, with
training rules declared null and void.
The head coach is taking charge of
the basketball candidates for this
week. "Tiny" Thornhill made a flying
visit to Los Angeles, and is back on
the campus again. Beginning next
Monday the varsity will start prepar
ing for the Pittsburgh game with prac
tice three times a week.
Football is about through for 1922,
and except in a few sections, the grid
