# U.S.C. VARSITY IS READY TO REPRESENT WEST NEW YEAR'S

### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CAL
IFORNIAâ€”If the Trojans can defeat
Gus Welch's gang from Washington
State on Thanksgiving Day, Coach
Elmer Henderson has a hunch the
Tournament of Roses Committee will
name U. S. C. to represent the West
on New Year's Day.
Southern California and Washington
are both unofficial candidates for the

honor, Henderson's men being the fa
vorites because they held California to
a 12 to 0 score, while the Bears beat
the Vikings 45 to 7.
The Trojans came out well enough
, against the Potato Diggers. W, S. C.
niched Idaho for the same number,
but the scores were not made on
straight football.
The regular line-up is due to start
for the Trojans, with Dolley, Maker.
Kincaid, and Otto Anderson composing
the backfleld.
