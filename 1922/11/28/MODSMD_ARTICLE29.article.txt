# POLO FINDS FAVOR WITH MEMBERS OF STANFORD R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
Because of its appeal to lovers of
horses, and the joy of playing the game,
polo has beeii popular with members of
the Reserve Officers' Training Corps,
and from the time of its introduction,
coincident with the establishment of the
field artillery unit, many more men have
desired to play than it has been possible
to mount.
Polo, at present, is a recognized minor
sport at Stanford. It is fostered in the
army because it develops horsemanship,
and for that reason ponies and saddles
are furnished by the government.
Equipment such as niallets, balls, hel
mets, polo boots, and incidentals are
supplied by the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
The need for increased space to play
has become so urgent that a new field
near the highway has been constructed
at a cost of several thousand dollars,
to supplement the grounds east of Encina
hall.
This new field is well turfed, and all
match games are played there, while the
old field is used for practice. A club
house, which is also used as. a grand
stand, has been moved to the new field,
and will, when completed, form the cen
ter of the newly organized "Polo and
Riding Club."
The Stanford polo team has each year
improved so greatly that, according to
Captain Charles E. Boyle, U. S. A., who
is the polo coach, this year it could hold!
its own with any regimental army team j
in the country. It is hoped that inter-j
collegiate polo competition will be in- j
troduced this Christmas with a tourna-l
ment with the Colorado Agricultural j
College corps. Games are also assured I
with the 3lhh Infantry team from the!
Presidio and the 76th Field Artillery at j
Del Monte. I
Games are played every Saturday j
morning on the field near the highway, j
The line-up of the Stanford team in
practice has been: No. 1, Barby, '24, or j
Edwards. '23; No. 2. Easly, '24; No. 3,
Bruce, '23; and back, Vanderburg, '24,
captain.
