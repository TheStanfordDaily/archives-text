## 
### (By United Press 
PARIS, Nov. 28. â€”Premier Poincare's
plans for seizing German property and
invading German territory were today
formally approved by the French cab
inet in preparation for the reparations
crisis now considered unavoidable.
A notification of the French decision
has been sent to the allies.
France's move is likely to take
place when the next German payments
fall due in January. It will involve
seizure of the Ruhr and the setting up
of a nominally independent regime on
the left bank of the Rhine.
