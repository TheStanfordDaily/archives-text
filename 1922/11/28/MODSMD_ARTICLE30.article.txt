# New Review Sets Speed Record in Photography
## 
### 
With only three days in which to
develop the Big Game pictures taken
last Saturday, have the cuts made, and
do the printing, it is thought that the
December Illustrated Review which
goes on sale tomorrow will set a new
record on the campus for speed in
publishing of photos.
Three full pages of action pictures
of the annual classic, snaps of bleacher
stunts, and a story of the struggle by
Garrett Elmore, '23, will be among
the features of the new Review.
