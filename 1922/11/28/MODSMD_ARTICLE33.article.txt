# Tickets For Sophomore Cotillion Going Fast; Details Are Determined
## 
### 
Tickets for the Sophomore Cotillion
are selling rapidly. The number has
been limited to 250, so that the floor will
not be crowded, and about 200 of these
have been sold, so, according to John
Hall, chairman of the committee, it
behooves "potential snakes to get their
tickets in a hurry."
Programs and decorations have been
decided on, but just what these will be
has not been released. Programs, how
ever, will be distributed Tuesday, De
cember 5.
Whitmer's ten-piece orchestra has been
secured to play. There will be twelve
dances, and possibly one extra.
Tickets for the cotillion are still on
sale at the Bookstore for $5 each.
