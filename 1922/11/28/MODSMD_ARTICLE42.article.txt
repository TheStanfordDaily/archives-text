# Euphronia Defeats California Congress In School Argument
## 
### 
Euphronia won a 2-to-l decision over
the California Congress in a debate at
the Little Theater Friday evening. The
proposition argued was: "Resolved, That
the primary and secondary schools of the
United States should be placed under the
jurisdiction of the national government."
Dick Jenkins, '25, Euphronia's first
speaker Oil the affirmative side of the
question, claimed that schools lack com
petent teachers and good physical equip
ment, which can only be remedied by gov
ernment control.
Royal Jumper, who opened the debate
for the negative, said that the present
system is school control by the people
and he advocated its continuance.
"Our educational system must be co
ordinated," declared Percy Spencer, '25,
Euphronia's second speaker. He recom
mended a national board consisting of
nine members which would bring about
this and eliminate waste.
Harold Baiter, the second speaker for
Congress, claimed that national control
would have all the drawbacks of a na
tional political system.
The judges were the Rev. W. B.
Thorpe of Palo Alto; Norman C. Mal
com, district attorney of Palo Alto; and
Professor Gurlow of the Palo Alto
Union High School. Faculty debating
adviser Emerson acted as chairman.
Euphronia's annual banquet will be
held tomorrow evening at the Chicken
Inn below Mayfleld on the state high
way. Tickets can now be purchased
from Dick Gross, '24. or Burt Palmer,
*24. All Euphronians who intend to go
are asked to communicate with either
of these men at once.
