# KERR TAKES COMMAND OF VARSITY HOOP TEAM
## 
### 
Andy Kerr is now getting acquaint
ed with his basketbail prospects. Until
the smoke clears out of the Stadium,
and preparations for the Pittsburgh
game begin, Andy will spend his work
ing hours over at the pavilion.
Court practice started two weeks
ago, but Kerr was then busy on the
practice field, and didn't get around
for more than one of the three weekly
practices. Starting Monday, the coach
has been sending his men through an
hour of practice nightly, assisted by
Jimmy Davies, captain and star last
year, and Skipper "Lefty" Rogers.
There is already a scramble for that
one vacancy left by Davies last season.
Fred Anderson, who subbed for Rich
mond last year; Paul Piggott, who got
into several games at center; A1 Low
enstein, and Mcßurney, a transfer last
fall from the California Southern
Branch team, are the veterans who
hope to make the place. Of the fresh
men, A1 Hooper, Roland Hoffman, and
Gurdon Steele are all likely to°shove
aside older men.
"Nip" McHose and Rogers are hold
ing things down for the varsity while
Dud DeGroot and Bob Janssen are
still in moleskins. Three more Babes
of last year, Shipkey, Driscoll, and
Middleton, will be on the court when
football suits are laid away.
No northern trips are on the Cards'
time card this year, but they will play
four against California and four with
the Trojans. Santa Clara, St. Igna
tius, St. Mary's, Nevada, and the Olym
pic Club are also on the menu. Games
will be played on Fridays this winter.
