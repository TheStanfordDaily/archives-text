"Religion's all or nothing: it's no mere smile
O' contentment, sigh of aspiration, sir—
No quality o' the flnlier tempered clay
Like its whiteness or its lightness; rather stuff
O' the very stuff; life of life, and self of self.
1 tell you men won't notice. When they do,
They'll understand."
Unitarian Church
Charming and Cowper Sts.
