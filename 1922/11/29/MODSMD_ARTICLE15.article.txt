# PROF. F.L. SCHOELL DESCRIBES MODERN FRENCH ACADEMY
## Representative of Literary, Social, And Political Life Of Present French Nation 
### 
"The French Academy of the twentieth
century is representative not only of
the 'beaux arts,' but of the social, intel
lectual, and political life of the French
nation," said Professor Franck Louis
Schocll in a lecture given last night in
the Little Theater. He characterized
the Academy as a French salon in the
true sense of the word.
Professor Schoell sketched a brief his
tory of the Academy, since the date of
its founding in 1635 by Cardinal Riche
lieu, through its suppression at the time
of the French Revolution and its later
revival by the Emperor Napoleon I, to
its place in the France of today. It
played its most important part in the
seventeenth century, when it was rep
resentative of the best in French letters.
It later tended to become more re
actionary and conservatory, and is now
essentially traditionalistic in spirit, ac
cording to the lecturer.
The purpose of the Academy was the
cleansing of the impurities of the French
language, existing as a result of the ig
norance of peasantry and nobility alike.
Its foremost production to this end is
a dictionary of the French language,
which was compiled in 1694, and has
been in use ever since that time. This
dictionary is revised annually, and is
the ultimate source of authority for any
new words.
The French Academy consists of forty
members, representing the leading men
of the nation in literary, dramatic, politi
cal, church, and military affairs. The
modern Academy is characterized by the
large number of novelists, who were not
admitted in the earlier days. Foremost
among these stands Anatol France, a
member for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury. Other members include philoso
phers, historians, poets, and dramatists.
The army is represented by Marshal
Foch and Marshal Joffre, and the politi
cal world by the former President Poin
care and the late President Deschanel.
The French nation is very proud of
the Academy and would never consent
to its suppression or abolition, although
there are many widely-recognized faults
in the present institution, according to
Professor Schoell. Its principal fault
lies in its reactionary character, which
allows the admittance of only the offi
cially acknowledged talents. This policy
has shut out many writers, such as
Moliere, Balzac, and Daudet, because of
their too liberal ideas.
A second striking fault is the igno
rance of foreign letters shown by Acad
emy members, who are permeated with
traditional French writings at the ex
pense of all others. Members arc often
ignorant of any knowledge of the Eng
lish, Italian, or Russian language, and
are therefore cut off from that great
source of literature and knowledge.
There has also lately been a marked
tendency for the Academy to become
plutocratic, due to the fashion estab
lished of bequeathing to it large estates,
art collections, and vast sums of money
to be used as awards for literary achieve
ment or acts of especial virtue.
The rapid rise of women in the French
literary world has created a need for
their admittance to the French Academy
or the formation of a new academy for
women members only, Professor Schoell
declared. A contest is being carried on
in France at the present time to select
the ten women who should be included
in such an academy.
