# PROF. F.L. SCHOELL DESCRIBES MODERN FRENCH ACADEMY
## Representative of Literary, Social, And Political Life Of Present French Nation 
### 
"The French Academy of the twentieth
century is representative not only of
the 'beaux arts,' but of the social, intel
lectual, and political life of the French
nation," said Professor Franck Louis
Schocll in a lecture given last night in
the Little Theater. He characterized
the Academy as a French salon in the
true sense of the word.
Professor Schoell sketched a brief his
tory of the Academy, since the date of
its founding in 1635 by Cardinal Riche
lieu, through its suppression at the time
of the French Revolution and its later
revival by the Emperor Napoleon I, to
its place in the France of today. It
played its most important part in the
seventeenth century, when it was rep
resentative of the best in French letters.
It later tended to become more re
actionary and conservatory, and is now
essentially traditionalistic in spirit, ac
cording to the lecturer.
The purpose of the Academy was the
cleansing of the impurities of the French
language, existing as a result of the ig
norance of peasantry and nobility alike.
Its foremost production to this end is
a dictionary of the French language,
which was compiled in 1694, and has
been in use ever since that time. This
dictionary is revised annually, and is
the ultimate source of authority for any
new words.
The French Academy consists of forty
members, representing the leading men
of the nation in literary, dramatic, politi
cal, church, and military affairs. The
modern Academy is characterized by the
large number of novelists, who were not
admitted in the earlier days. Foremost
among these stands Anatol France, a
member for nearly a quarter of a cen
tury. Other members include philoso
phers, historians, poets, and dramatists.
