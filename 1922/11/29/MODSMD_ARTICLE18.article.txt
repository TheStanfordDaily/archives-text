# Glee Club Makes First Appearance of Year at Dedication of Statue
## 
### 
Stanford Glee Club will make its
first public appearance of the year
when it sings the Belgian national
hymn, "La Brabaconne," and leads in
the singing of "America," at the dedi
cation, next Monday, of the statue pre- !
sented by the Belgian government to
Stanford University.
It was originally proposed to sing'
the hymn in French, and Professor S. |
S. Seward, Jr., of the English depart- j
ment, was to coach the club in the
words. Because of lack of time this
plan had to be given up, however.
The Glee Club has been practicing
two afternoons a week since the begin- j
ning of the quarter, under the direc-!
tion of Dick Malaby, '23, but no trip j
will be taken during the Christmas |
holidays because it has not been pos-1
sible to prepare a suitable program.
It will, however, sing two carols for 1
the Christmas music.
