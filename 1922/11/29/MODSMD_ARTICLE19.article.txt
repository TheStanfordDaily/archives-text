# HOCKEY CONTESTS WON BY SENIOR AND SOPHOMORE SQUADS
## 
### 
The seniors defeated the freshmen
by a 2 to 1 score and the juniors lost
to the sophomores yesterday afternoon
in the first games of the interclass
tournament. All four teams were in
top-notch condition after the hockey
battle with California last Saturday,
and the sophomore and senior victories
were close contests.
In the senior-freshman contest both
the squads scored once during the
first half. The fourth-year women made
the first goal before the freshman |
eleven had time to realize that the !
game had begun. At the beginning of ;
the match the senior backfield played !
up-field and kept the ball within the j
twenty-five-yard line of the freshman j
goal. Then the first-year team recov-'
ered the ball, shot it past the enemy's
defense, and scored before the seniori
backfield could come to the aid of
their goalkeeper. Mary Learnard, right j
halfback, and Ruth Stern, right full
back, playing for the senior eleven,
showed up well in defense. During the
second half the first-year team drove
for their opponents' goal, but were'
stopped by the backfield and did not
succeed in scoring. The fourth-year
women made another tally In the last j
part of the contest.
At the very beginning of the junior-1
sophomore match the third-year wo-1
men drove the ball to the sophomore 1
goal and scored. Then the second-year
team's forward line rushed the ball
down the field, broke through the
junior backfield, and tied the score.
The junior women were unable to
score in the second half, but their de
fense could not keep the sophomores
from making one more goal. Polly
Learned, left halfback, and Mabel Mc-
Kibben, left- inside for the second
year squad helped the sophomores to
play a fast offensive game. The juniors
have three good halfbacks, Alice Roth,
and Geraldine and Josephine Frank
lin, who play good defensive games.
