9:30 o'clock.
This will be the first regular game
played on the field, as well as the first
of the season. The army team is rated
as one of the best in the West, but the
It. O. T. C. have been practicing con
sistently every afternoon, and have
had games among themselves on Sat-1
urdays, with the result, according to
Captain Charles E. Boyle, U. S. A.,
their coach, that they are capable of
holding their own with most of the
army teams in the country. At any
rate it should be a hard-fought strug

Stanford in charge of the unit may
take a hand on the side of the in
vaders.
