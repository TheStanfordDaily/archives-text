# HAMPERING THE HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
Phis is not exactly a fling at the faculty. The
editor can't stand any such in his present precarious
position, speaking- in terms of smoke-lips. But the
fact that there are certain of the faculty who dis
regard student sentiment and University practice
by remaining in classes during examinations is
enough justification for a mild kick.
Stanford has the Honor System and is proud of
it because it works. In the personal experience of
many students, there has been less cheating by far
since the institution of the system than at any time
in their previous careers. But despite the fact that
students have been granted the right to have this
system, and faculty members have been instructed
to abide by the rules laid down for instructors, there
arc still a few who openly scoff and even go so far
as to remain in the room to spy upon suspects.
To many this attitude is nothing short of an insult.
To others, it is merely indicative of a twisted faculty
slant on the matter. But to those most interested,
it spells the ruination of the Honor System. If a
student is placed on his honor, the chances are that
he will not cheat. If the same student knows that
he is watched closely by a man who is without faith
in human nature, the student will try to cheat if for
110 other purpose than to fool the professor. The
average student, which includes the writer of this
editorial, would take a distinct pleasure in cheating
under any professor's nose, provided that professor
were extremely anxious to catch some culprit in the
act. There is nothing criminal about such an over
sight of honesty. It is merely unidealistic inde
pendence.
Who is going to keep the suspicious members of
the faculty out of their respective classrooms while
•examinations are going on? Who will enforce the
Honor System from the side of the faculty? Who
will see that all students are subjected to the same
system? Well bite. But while we're biting, we
are rather inclined to think that somebody will take
the hint.
