# WHOSE ORGAN RECITAL?
## 
### 
All eleven o'clock classes were dismissed yester
day to allow students to hear the organ recital in
the Memorial Church. Those who came from ten
o'clock classes at some distance from the church
arrived too late to get in. Everything would have
been all right ordinarily, but in this case two hun
dred or more people from Palo Alto had already
taken the seats. No one was allowed to stand in
the aisles and many students were forced to- go
away disappointed. While the people of Palo Alto
are to !>e lauded for their very good taste in their
choice of music, many students arc inclined to ask
today, "Whose organ recital was this, anyway?''
