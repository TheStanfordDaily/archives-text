WHEN KNIGHTHOOD WAS IN FLOUR
Fictionized perversion from the picture of a different
name.
By Launcelot Lump, '23-24
'Twas twilight. In the flickering moonlight the bull
frogs were croaking .ight and left. The bulldogs made
run on the bank. It wag a hot night, and in the hot
house the thermometer hung limp and exhausted.
"What ho!" cried out the guard, filing in through the
iron bars.
"No metal can touch me," returned the fullback,
throwing back his vest. "I have just been invested with
the Order of the Garter."
On the sag of his undershirt there were the three
brilliant safety pins of the O'Gees —the order entitled a
man to three pins, and so got most of the Joiners —for
do not three pledge pins make a guy more prominent
than one? Or do they?
"Did you get the sack?" breathed the guard.
"Yes. I got five," sneezed the fullback.

The scene changes. So does the guard. It is morning,
tmci the rosy-cheeked bootblacks are setting out their
shoes to be shined upon by the sun. In the distance
approaches Chest, the lady-like instructor. In his hand
is a manuscript, much thumbed and considerably
fingered.
Ah! The soup thickens —what can one say?—lt was
the work of a moment —then it was all over, and nobody
stopped to pick it up.
Chest tried to collect his scattered thought. In the
distance, watching, stood the guard, in sackcloth—five
of them—and on his chest was a circle block "Flour."
"Curse this Day!" stated Chest, sighting the guard.
"I have been fouled. I shall claim fiteen yards pen
alty."
"Wrong again. We plucked you," snarled the guard,
roughing a passing neck. *■

It was cold, bitter cold, and dark. No one could see
anyone else. The lights were out. The heating plant
had used up all the steam on the five o'clock whistle.
"I think it's terrible," suggested the chairman, calling
the meeting back to order.
"The little beasts took it right off and stamped upon
it," said Chest, with a fierce waggle of his ingrowing
chin. "Sacrilege, I calls it. Why, I had been wearing
that same collar for twenty years."
Then there came a stormy serene. Several other winds
blew off. A rain of adjectives fell into a sea" of verbs.
Ah, but that was a scene! It was a spectacle! If you
don't believe it, ask the press agent.
"Such practices shall be abolished," ordered the chair
man when the disorder had ceased.
"Sure, dey don't need no practice," coincided the
sergeant-at-arms. "Shall we decapitate him?"
"Hey?" demurred the chair.
"Just as a matter of form, I think it would improve
him."
It was Chest's turn to fly open. "Give him the sack!"
he abrogated. "I myself shall say it with flour."
And so it came about. And as the two passed hand-in
hand into the dying rays of a faint red sunset, the lady
like instructor remarked that if he had anything to say
about it, it was the end of a perfect Day.
Moral (All movies gotta have a moral): Never rough
the kicker.
