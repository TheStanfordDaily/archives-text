## Some Eastern Records Should Be Better, But Few Coaches to Change 
### HENRY L. FARRELL United Press Staff Correspondent 
NEW YORK, November 28. — Even
though many Eastern records might be a
little better looking at the end of the
1922 football season, few changes are
expected among the prominent coaches.
Because the Yale eleven turned out to
be a tine fizzle instead of the great ma
chine that was expected last September,
it was expected outside of Yale circles
that Ted Jones would lose his job. Jones
not only will not lose his job, but he will
be given a vote of confidence this winter,
according to reliable information. Those
on the inside claim that Yale blundered
and floundered around this season
through no fault of the coach. Losing
to Princeton and Brown, Harvard had
a bad season, but no one of Crimson fol
lowing had a thought of holding Bob
Fisher or the Haughton system responsi
ble. The Haughton system is a mighty
influence at Harvard.
Bill Roper may not return to Prince
ton because he is now laboring under the
pressure of outside business and it is
understood that he may be named for
a responsible government position. Roper
is now prominent in Philadelphia poli
tics and has a good law practice.
Johnny Heisman is sure of his job at
Pennsylvania University, but Hugo
Bezdek may step out of the athletic chair
at Penn State and get back into pro
fessional baseball as the manager of the
Philadelphia Nationals.
"Greasy" Neale is through at W. & J.
He blames friction with the faculty for
conditions that forced him to look for
a job elsewhere. Neale had had many
offers, but he wants to come to Columbia.
VV. &. J. is after Knut Rockne, the
capable director of athletics and coach
at Notre Dame. Rockne has two years
to go at Notre Dame and it isn't quite
possible that the Hoosier University will
allow a matter of dollars to come be
tween him and his present job.
