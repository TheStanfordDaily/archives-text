# TRAINING QUARTERS DAMAGED BY FIRE
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA â€” The
upper floor of the Mackay Training
Quarters was completely destroyed by
fire last Tuesday morning. The exact
origin of the blaze is unknown, al
though it is thought that the flames
might have started through the explo
sion of a bottle of alcohol placed too
near an overheated gas plate.
The quarters were built in 1909, and
were presented to the university by
Clarence Mackay. The damage is es
timated to be in excess of ten thou
sand dollars and is covered by insur
ance. The building will be rebuilt.
