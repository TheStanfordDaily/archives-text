# INTERCLASS TEAMS TO START BASKET SEASON NEXT WEEK
## 
### Maxwell Stiles, '25 
Now we present the interclass bas
ketball frothies of 1922, of which the
opening chorus runs along in the fol
lowing manner a la camembert: #
Hoop la! Hoop la!
Forty frosh in B. V. D.'a,
Think every team but theirs is
cheese —
Ring around casaba.
And then Mother Goose flopped over
on her feathered side and quacked
herself to death. It was announced by
the great virtuoso, Charles W. Davis,
that the first game in the interclass
basketball hoop-it-up-and-in will be
toddled on Tuesday, December 5, two
days after the return from the Tur
key's Funeral.
The sophs and frosh will do the deed
on that night, the second teams tang
ling finger knuckles at 7:15, and the
first teamß grappling an hour later.
There are two separate championships
to be fought for, because the com
mittee decided that everybody would
have a better time if there were more
weepers after the defeat.
The schedule follows, the second
teams playing at 7:15 and the first
squads at 8:15 in each case: sophs
vs. frosh, Dec. 5; seniors vs. juniors,
Dec. C; frosh vs. juniors, Dec. 7; sen
iors vs. sophs, Dec. 12; juniors vs.
sophs, Dec. 13; seniors vs. frosh, Dec.
14.
This schedule leaves much to the
imagination and quite a bit to the
newspapers. There we have six whole
rounds times two, twelve games in all
—rubber type made to order, we calls
it. And the Roughs gathered round
the bull pen ought to get quite a kick
out of the doings also, if recent foot
ball was anything of a criterion.
The frosh are working out in the
Encina gym between 4 and 5 o'clock,
while the same floor is taken by the
sophs an hour later. Between the
hours of 7:15 and 8:15 the juniors are
putting the finishing touches on the
Encina floor and an occasional casaba
through the Encina basket. At the
sanie hour the seniors are showing off
their sombreros and not a little melon
expertness in the pavilion.
Yas, the basketball frothies are quite
melonious.

This schedule leaves much to the
imagination and quite a bit to the
newspapers. There we have six whole
rounds times two, twelve games in all
—rubber type made to order, we calls
it. And the Roughs gathered round
the bull pen ought to get quite a kick
out of the doings also, if recent foot
ball was anything of a criterion.
The frosh are working out in the
Encina gym between 4 and 5 o'clock,
while the same floor is taken by the
sophs an hour later. Between the
hours of 7:15 and 8:15 the juniors are
putting the finishing touches on the
Encina floor and an occasional casaba
through the Encina basket. At the
sanie hour the seniors are showing off
their sombreros and not a little melon
expertness in the pavilion.
Yas, the basketball frothies are quite
melonious.
