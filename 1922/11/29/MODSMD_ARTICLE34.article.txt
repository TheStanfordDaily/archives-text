# Big Game Pictures And Snaps of Pitt Panthers Appear in New Pictorial
## 
### 
A center spread of the Big Game
and the first complete set of photos
of the Pittsburgh Panthers who will
battle the Cards December 30, make
up a part of the enlarged eight-page
rotogravure section in the December
Pictorial which will go on sale about
December 8. A full page is devoted to
the women's archery and hockey
teams. Snaps of the more daring cos
tumes worn Roughs' Day, the bonfire,
and action pictures of the Nevada,
U. S. C., and Washington games com
plete the section.
Of lighter vein on the literary side
of the new Pictorial is Henry Mack's
one-act playlet entitled, "Have You
Anything for the Cleaners?" Tom
Kleckner's frontispiece editorial gives
another good lesson and moral for as
similation by every Stanford man and
woman, while Hap Kennedy, '24, and
Julliard McDonald. '25, contribute
some snappy cartoons to the issue.
