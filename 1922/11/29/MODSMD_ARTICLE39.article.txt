NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â€”Princeton's
place at the top of Eastern football is
firmly established.
Princeton, Cornell, the Army, and
West Virginia remain undefeated, so
perhaps the claim of the Tigers to the
Eastern championship can be disputed.
None can deny, however, that the
Tigers have the best record.
The Army proved itself to be one
of the most powerful teams in the
East in winning from the Navy but as
long as West Point goins on to vic
tories with players who have been
playing for five, six, seven, and as
many as eight years, it is not fair to
consider the cadets for championships.
One of the surprises was the defeat
administered to the Washington and
Jefferson eleven by Detroit. The nar
row escape Lafayette had in beating
Lehigh only 3 to 0, was another jolt.
Because most of the experts figured
Yale to be the favorite the victory of
Harvard in the last of the Big Three
games might be considered a surprise.
Yale's only hope for victory rested in
playing a different game than the Elis
had played all season and they didn't
do it. Yale had the material and per
haps the coaching but Yale didn't have
football brains.
In beating Stanford, 28 to 0, the
great California eleven was able to re
tain its position as the best scoring
machine among the major teams. The
Bears have piled up a total of 398
points. Leading the East and second
on the national list is Cornell with 330
points. Auburn has the lead in the
South with 277, and lowa was the best
in the Midwest with 208.
Michigan and Notre Dame had the
best defense in the country. Each had
only 13 points scored against them.
Notre Dame, however, had her goal
line crossed once while the Michigan
line was twice crossed. DePauw scored
one touchdown on Notre Dame while
Georgia Tech and Butler scored a field
goal each. Both Wisconsin and Minne
sota scored touchdowns on Michigan
and Minnesota added the point after
touchdown.
Brunneur, Lafayette back, was the
best individual scorer among the ma
jor elevens with 86 points; Wilson of
Penn State and Robertson of Carnegie
Tech scored 73, and Pfann of Cornell
had 66.
