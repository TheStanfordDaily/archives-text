# CHARLIE CHAPLIN'S WOMEN ARE TOO TAME
## 
### (By United Press 
OAKLAND, — American women are
losing their personalities, and are built
too much nowadays on the "follow-the
leader" plan, according to no less an
authority than Charlie Chaplin. They're
too tame, complains Charlie.
"The follow-the-lcader club life is
making the American women shallow,"
declared Charlie. "They have too little
association with men, which results in
a loss of personality.
"When all is said and done, women)
to cultivate self-expression and individu
ality, must associate with men rather
than with women.
"European women arc bored to death
without men in their clubs; in fact, they
go in very little for club life at all un
less men are also included among the
members.
"But," added Charlie, "American girls
arc much more beautiful, both in their
figures and their features than the Eng
lish or French girls."
Which proves after all that Charlie
isn't such a bad diplomat.
