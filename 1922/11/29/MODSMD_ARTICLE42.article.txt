# Students Have Varying Duties to Perform in Thanksgiving Vacation
## 
### 
When is a recess not a recess?
Visions of a huge platter of delicious,
savory turkey with stuffln', cranberry
sauce, et al, loom before the hungry
eyes of prostrate studes. The Thanks
giving holiday starts tonight.
Is it appropriate to call it a vacation
when Ye Hard-Working Student la
bors over his books in preparation for
final exes and in catching up on back
work; or is the term to be limited to
a big "blowout" and a good time some
where in the city?
A canvass of a dozen representative
students on the campus showed that
seven of their number were resolved
to study through the holiday; two ex
pressed themselves as going "to the
city;" another said he was returning
home; while the remaining two were
fully determined to study, sleep, and
have a good time, too.
Intentions may be good but how
about the realizations?
