NEW YORK.—Pennsylvania recently
turned what seemed to be a sure defeat
by the Navy eleven into a brilliant vic
tory by a spectacular showing in the
second half.
The change between a team that had
been completely and decisively beaten in
the first half and the team that came out
in the second half and ran away from
one of the best teams in the East was
startling.
The wand that brought about a magic
transformation was said to be a cutting
remark and an inference by their coach,
"Johnny" Heisman, that they were yel
low.
After the first half, Heisman, accord
ing to the story, went into the Penn
clubhouse and had the following, in ef
fect, to say to the squad :
"I don't mind you losing, if you lose
like men with your heads up. I've got
a long contract and I'm going to tear
it up tonight and leave you flat, if you
don't fight in the next half."
They went out and fought so much
that they won and provided the biggest
upset of the season.
* * * *
Many stories are told of such scathing
remarks made by coaches that worked
heart and fight in a team and many of
them are not true.
One told recently in New York con
cerned Tad Coy, one of the greatest of
all Yale backs.
Princeton several years back was lead
ing at the first half, 10 to 0, and the
Yale eleven wasn't showing too much
fight. They came out in the second half
and rolled up twelve points for a vic
tory.
Nasty cutting words from the coaches
and charges that they lacked the courage
of boys was regarded as the strategy
that the Yale coaches worked between
halves to get the team on its feet.
Several years later Coy was asked what
was said to them in their dressing room,
and he replied:
"Nothing that I know of. I was
asleep."
* * * *
In one of the big Eastern games this
year, one of the teams that had been
badly outplayed in the first -half, came
back in the second half and by almost
superhuman efforts tied the score.
"You must have told them plenty be
tween halves" the coach of the eleven
was asked after the game.
"Didn't tell them a thing," he replied.
"Wasn't even in the clubhouse."
* * * *
Sometimes it is a most effective means
of getting results from athletes to ques
tion their courage. If you are big
enough to get away with it it is a good
strategy.
Two years ago Yale had a crew that
was almost the joke of the East. Every
one took a turn in leaving the Blue boat
lengths behind and it looked like Har
vard could leave three men out of the
Crimson shell and win in their annual
classic.
Guy Nickalls, the British coach of
Yale, resigned and made the rather sen
sational charges publicly that the crew
was yellow and that he couldn't get re
sults from weaklings.
Another coach came and in two weeks
such a transformation came that the Yale
eight went 011 the Thomas river, rowed
the very heart out of Harvard and won
the race.

been completely and decisively beaten in
the first half and the team that came out
in the second half and ran away from
one of the best teams in the East was
startling.
The wand that brought about a magic
transformation was said to be a cutting
remark and an inference by their coach,
"Johnny" Heisman, that they were yel
low.
After the first half, Heisman, accord
ing to the story, went into the Penn
clubhouse and had the following, in ef
fect, to say to the squad :
"I don't mind you losing, if you lose
like men with your heads up. I've got
a long contract and I'm going to tear
it up tonight and leave you flat, if you
don't fight in the next half."
They went out and fought so much
that they won and provided the biggest
upset of the season.

Many stories are told of such scathing
remarks made by coaches that worked
heart and fight in a team and many of
them are not true.
One told recently in New York con
cerned Tad Coy, one of the greatest of
all Yale backs.
Princeton several years back was lead
ing at the first half, 10 to 0, and the
Yale eleven wasn't showing too much
fight. They came out in the second half
and rolled up twelve points for a vic
tory.
Nasty cutting words from the coaches
and charges that they lacked the courage
of boys was regarded as the strategy
that the Yale coaches worked between
halves to get the team on its feet.
Several years later Coy was asked what
was said to them in their dressing room,
and he replied:
"Nothing that I know of. I was
asleep."

In one of the big Eastern games this
year, one of the teams that had been
badly outplayed in the first -half, came
back in the second half and by almost
superhuman efforts tied the score.
"You must have told them plenty be
tween halves" the coach of the eleven
was asked after the game.
"Didn't tell them a thing," he replied.
"Wasn't even in the clubhouse."

Sometimes it is a most effective means
of getting results from athletes to ques
tion their courage. If you are big
enough to get away with it it is a good
strategy.
Two years ago Yale had a crew that
was almost the joke of the East. Every
one took a turn in leaving the Blue boat
lengths behind and it looked like Har
vard could leave three men out of the
Crimson shell and win in their annual
classic.
Guy Nickalls, the British coach of
Yale, resigned and made the rather sen
sational charges publicly that the crew
was yellow and that he couldn't get re
sults from weaklings.
Another coach came and in two weeks
such a transformation came that the Yale
eight went 011 the Thomas river, rowed
the very heart out of Harvard and won
the race.
