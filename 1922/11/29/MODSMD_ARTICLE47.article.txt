# KISS BRANDED IMMORAL BY CALIFORNIA PROFESSOR

BERKELEY, Nov. 29 (United Press).
â€”The kiss has been branded as not only
unsanitary, but immoral by Dr. Robert
O. Moody, professor of anatomy at the
Llniversity of California, and social
hygiene expert, who is lecturing before
the Berkeley Police School, where Chief
Vollmer trains his diplomaed "high
brow cops."
"Leg shows," declared Dr. Moody,
"are a contributing factor toward mod
ern delinquency. They lower the tone
of the nation's morals.
"Modern young people who indulge
in too many 'spooning' parties are wreck
ing the moral standards of the coun
try," he declared.
"Allowing young men to take kissing
liberties has been the first step in the
ruin of many a girl. Boys and men lose
respect for girls who let men kiss and
hug them.
"It will surprise and shock many good
people to learn the hard fact that the
morality of a number of almost naked
tribes in the Philippines is far above
that of any civilized people in the world,
and that, curiously enough, some of the
most fully clad tribes fall far below
the ordinary standards of civilized
people.
"If I should advertise a leg show of
the best developed men's legs in the
world, and charge a dollar admission,
only a few would pay the price. But if
I should advertise a similar show of
girls' legs at two dollars admission, a

crowd would besiege the place. And
the men would come in super-enthusiasm
in the thought of what they were to see.
"A single standard of morality for
men and women is the most effective way
of curing things. There is a crying need
today to educate children into the so
called 'mysteries' of life, and their par
ents should furnish the information
rather than it should comc from hap
hazard sources."
