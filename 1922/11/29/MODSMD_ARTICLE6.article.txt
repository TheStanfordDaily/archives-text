The twenty-fourth annual meeting

universities will attend the sessions,
which will be held both mornings and
afternoons.
Papers on subjects connected with
the study of literature will be given
by various professors of Stanford Uni
versity. Professor H. R. Fairclough, of
the Department of Classical Literature,
will speak on "The Poems of the Ap
pendix Vergiliana," while Professors
J. S. P. Tatlock, W. D. Briggs, and
H. J. Hall, of the English department,

Hall, under the title, "An Early Amer
ican Poet," will discuss the works of
Benjamin Tompson, 1642-1714, school
master, physician, and the first native

are uncollected and little known, re
flect very clearly the spirit and cul
ture of colonial Massachusetts.
