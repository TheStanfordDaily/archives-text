# CAMPUS WELL CLEANED UP SAYS FIRE CHIEF
## 
### 
The campus is cleaned up in better
shape than it has been in a long time,
according to Fire Marshal Ed Lamb.
Over 110 truckloads of burnable rub
bish were carried to the bonfire from
the campus by freshmen workers.
According to the Fire Chief, the an
nual bonfire is a very valuable institu
tion here at Stanford, in that, once a
year the whole campus and surround-1
ing territory is given a thorough
cleaning up, thus reducing the fire (
hazard.
