# LEJEUNE PRESENTS GIFT OF BELGIANS TO HOOVER
## American Government Put Right Man in Right Place, Says Senator at Exercises 
### 
"I am proud to be able today in this University, the cradle of thoughts to
which we owe so much, to bring you the tribute of gratitude of the people of
Belgium, gratitude moulded in bronze everlasting as the spirit of Life itself,
essence of the Almighty Will of the Great Maker."
Thus stamping Herbert Hoover as a typical American and Stanford man,
Senator Albert Lejeune presented to him whom King Albert and the Belgian
people call "Citizen and Friend" a token of the gratitude and admiration of a
nation.
Th bronze statue of Isis, goddess of motherhood and growing grain, typify
ing the spirit of beneficence at war with evil in the world, has been placed
on the Stanford campus as a permanent memorial to the work of the great
American in Belgium during the World War.

The statue is the last work of the
great Belgian sculptor, Puttemans,
who died last year. It was done dur
ing the war.
The workmen at the Fondrie Nation
ale des Bronzes, where the statue was
finished, were, with the rest of Bel
gian workmen, under an eight-hour
law at that time. In order to finish
the statue in a given time, they work
ed more than eight hours on many oc
casions. When Senator Lejeune called
the workmen together to thank them,
the foreman declared that the men
welcomed the opportunity to show
their appreciation of Hoover's work.
Senator Lejeune was introduced by
President Wilbur, who made a brief
talk of welcome.
M. Jules Simon, the Belgian consul
in San Francisco, who was designated
as the official representative of the
Belgian government, spoke briefly and
was followed by Frank Deering of the
University Board of Trustees who for
mally accepted the honor of having
the statue placed on the campus.
Others who spoke briefly were Pres
ident David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California, and the Honor
able Egerton Shore, representing Gov
ernor Stephens. The invocation was
given by Dr. D. Charles Gardner.
The Stanford Glee Club sang the
Belgian nationals hymn, "La Braba
conne" and led the singing of "Amer
ica" by the audience.
Following the ceremony in Memorial
Church, the unveiling ceremony took
place in the Art Gallery. The Belgian
senator presented the statue and
Hoover made a short speech of ac
ceptance.
Senator Lejeune traveled 6000 miles
to represent the Belgian people at the
presentation ceremony in Memorial j
Church this afternoon.
"For long months, nay, for years
even, have I looked forward to the
day on which it would be my privi
leged honor to carry out the purpose
for which the Commission of ..the
Hoover Monument was formed during
the war, and standing on American
soil to be able to express to Mr. j
Hoover, before his own countrymen,
Belgium's gratitude for his splendid
services and devotion," he said. "And
now that the long-cherished day has
come, I feel something like a shudder
running through my veins for fear I
should prove unworthy of the occasion
and be unable to correctly express in
a foreign language, and with the
proper words, the feelings which leap
from my heart, the feelings which are
in the heart of all the citizens of my
native land.
"My task is all the more difficult as
I am fully aware of the extraordinary
modesty of the hero of this ceremony.
I think it will be enough for the pur
pose that I would say to him in very
plain words that we all here know and
feel, that it is Stanford University
which he so dearly loves, and above
all, the great, the grand American na
tion, that we are honoring in the per
son of one of the first scholars of this
University, of one of the illustrious
sons of the United States of America.
"Is not the greatness of a nation
built up with the deeds, the thought,
the spirit and the devotion of certain
individual citizens who may be set
forth as an inspiring example to the
people and to the young generations?
Mr. Hoover is one of those citizens
but his citizenship goes even beyond
these shores. Need I remind you that
he has been also nominated by King
Albert, a Citizen of Belgium and the
Friend of the Belgium people, which
title no other man in the world pos
sesses because it is the acknowledge
ment by a nation of what no other
man has acquired—the actual pres
ervation of the life of the people of
that nation."
Senator Lejeune set fourth some of
the reasons why Hoover's work stands
so high in the esteem of the Belgian
people.
"He is a self-made man who decided
to become an engineer of repute and
by hard work obtained a degree at the
age of twenty-one. His achievements
as an engineer in America, Australia,
China, and elsewhere, are important
but not direct in their effects on civ
ilization.
"Here, we are at the cross-roads,"
declared Lejeune, "and we must draw
a line between those who may be in
directly an asset to their country by
their business capacities wielded to
suit the ends of their own interests
and those who, inspired by loftier
ideals, consider and understand that
fortune and wealth are a means to do
good—not the object of life and that
the faculties and power which a gifted
human being can possess to produce
wealth are to serve for the purpose of
directly benefitting under his own
guidance and clear judgment the inter
ests of his country and the cause of
civilization and humanity. The Amer
ican citizen whom I have in mind and
who was educated in this University
is one of those."
Senator Lejeune described the in
tervention of the American govern
ment during the war when starvation
faced the Belgian people, the creation
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium, and the appointment of Hoover
to head the commission.
"The American government put the

right man in the right place," said
Lejeune. "All through the long years
of the war never did the nine and a
half millions of poor suffering human
creatures pray in vain for their daily
bread and their courage and faith in
the dawn of delivery and justice was
kept alive.
"Forgive me, Mr. Hoover, but 1
must add that the unimpeachable hon
esty and righteousness of the organ
izing spirit of the Commission for Re
lief was praised so highly as to draw
from the lips of the German governor
general, von-Bissing, the following
words:
" '1 fully trust Mr. Hoover although
I know quite well that he in constant
touch with the French and British
governments and that he is at heart
with our enemies.'
"Is it surprising that he who could
command respect from our bitterest
foe whose name is hated and shall
continue to be hated by generations
in Belgium as a synonym of despotic
barbarism, could also, by his call to
the generous feelings of the great na
tion he belongs to, persuade his own
countrymen to forfeit of their own
free will, a part of their own food in
favor of the sufferers?
"I am here to remind you after four
years that we have not forgotten the
voluntary sacrifice the American peo
ple imposed upon themselves."
Senator Lejeune told of how,
through the efforts of Herbert Hoover,
the surplus from the Commission for
Relief in Belgium was turned over to
the development of higher education
in Belgium.
In closing, he said, "What greater
thought could be more simply and
more effectively carried out than it
has by the sons and daughters of the
United States of America and in par
ticular by Mr. Hoover? And is not
as I said at the start, the generous
and thoughtful American spirit cou
pled with American high training and
education —namely, the training of
Stanford University responsible for all
this?"
Hoover will leave tonight for Los
Angeles to address the Chamber of
Commerce on the work of the Col
orado River Commission, of which he
is chairman.

ale des Bronzes, where the statue was
finished, were, with the rest of Bel
gian workmen, under an eight-hour
law at that time. In order to finish
the statue in a given time, they work
ed more than eight hours on many oc
casions. When Senator Lejeune called
the workmen together to thank them,
the foreman declared that the men
welcomed the opportunity to show
their appreciation of Hoover's work.
Senator Lejeune was introduced by
President Wilbur, who made a brief
talk of welcome.
M. Jules Simon, the Belgian consul
in San Francisco, who was designated
as the official representative of the
Belgian government, spoke briefly and
was followed by Frank Deering of the
University Board of Trustees who for
mally accepted the honor of having
the statue placed on the campus.
Others who spoke briefly were Pres
ident David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California, and the Honor
able Egerton Shore, representing Gov
ernor Stephens. The invocation was
given by Dr. D. Charles Gardner.
The Stanford Glee Club sang the
Belgian nationals hymn, "La Braba
conne" and led the singing of "Amer
ica" by the audience.
Following the ceremony in Memorial
Church, the unveiling ceremony took
place in the Art Gallery. The Belgian
senator presented the statue and
Hoover made a short speech of ac
ceptance.
Senator Lejeune traveled 6000 miles
to represent the Belgian people at the
presentation ceremony in Memorial j
Church this afternoon.
"For long months, nay, for years
even, have I looked forward to the
day on which it would be my privi
leged honor to carry out the purpose
for which the Commission of ..the
Hoover Monument was formed during
the war, and standing on American
soil to be able to express to Mr. j
Hoover, before his own countrymen,
Belgium's gratitude for his splendid
services and devotion," he said. "And
now that the long-cherished day has
come, I feel something like a shudder
running through my veins for fear I
should prove unworthy of the occasion
and be unable to correctly express in
a foreign language, and with the
proper words, the feelings which leap
from my heart, the feelings which are
in the heart of all the citizens of my
native land.
"My task is all the more difficult as
I am fully aware of the extraordinary
modesty of the hero of this ceremony.
I think it will be enough for the pur
pose that I would say to him in very
plain words that we all here know and
feel, that it is Stanford University
which he so dearly loves, and above
all, the great, the grand American na
tion, that we are honoring in the per
son of one of the first scholars of this
University, of one of the illustrious
sons of the United States of America.
"Is not the greatness of a nation
built up with the deeds, the thought,
the spirit and the devotion of certain
individual citizens who may be set
forth as an inspiring example to the
people and to the young generations?
Mr. Hoover is one of those citizens
but his citizenship goes even beyond
these shores. Need I remind you that
he has been also nominated by King
Albert, a Citizen of Belgium and the
Friend of the Belgium people, which
title no other man in the world pos
sesses because it is the acknowledge
ment by a nation of what no other
man has acquired—the actual pres
ervation of the life of the people of
that nation."
Senator Lejeune set fourth some of
the reasons why Hoover's work stands
so high in the esteem of the Belgian
people.
"He is a self-made man who decided
to become an engineer of repute and
by hard work obtained a degree at the
age of twenty-one. His achievements
as an engineer in America, Australia,
China, and elsewhere, are important
but not direct in their effects on civ
ilization.
"Here, we are at the cross-roads,"
declared Lejeune, "and we must draw
a line between those who may be in
directly an asset to their country by
their business capacities wielded to
suit the ends of their own interests
and those who, inspired by loftier
ideals, consider and understand that
fortune and wealth are a means to do
good—not the object of life and that
the faculties and power which a gifted
human being can possess to produce
wealth are to serve for the purpose of
directly benefitting under his own
guidance and clear judgment the inter
ests of his country and the cause of
civilization and humanity. The Amer
ican citizen whom I have in mind and
who was educated in this University
is one of those."
Senator Lejeune described the in
tervention of the American govern
ment during the war when starvation
faced the Belgian people, the creation
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium, and the appointment of Hoover
to head the commission.
"The American government put the

right man in the right place," said
Lejeune. "All through the long years
of the war never did the nine and a
half millions of poor suffering human
creatures pray in vain for their daily
bread and their courage and faith in
the dawn of delivery and justice was
kept alive.
"Forgive me, Mr. Hoover, but 1
must add that the unimpeachable hon
esty and righteousness of the organ
izing spirit of the Commission for Re
lief was praised so highly as to draw
from the lips of the German governor
general, von-Bissing, the following
words:
" '1 fully trust Mr. Hoover although
I know quite well that he in constant
touch with the French and British
governments and that he is at heart
with our enemies.'
"Is it surprising that he who could
command respect from our bitterest
foe whose name is hated and shall
continue to be hated by generations
in Belgium as a synonym of despotic
barbarism, could also, by his call to
the generous feelings of the great na
tion he belongs to, persuade his own
countrymen to forfeit of their own
free will, a part of their own food in
favor of the sufferers?
"I am here to remind you after four
years that we have not forgotten the
voluntary sacrifice the American peo
ple imposed upon themselves."
Senator Lejeune told of how,
through the efforts of Herbert Hoover,
the surplus from the Commission for
Relief in Belgium was turned over to
the development of higher education
in Belgium.
In closing, he said, "What greater
thought could be more simply and
more effectively carried out than it
has by the sons and daughters of the
United States of America and in par
ticular by Mr. Hoover? And is not
as I said at the start, the generous
and thoughtful American spirit cou
pled with American high training and
education —namely, the training of
Stanford University responsible for all
this?"
Hoover will leave tonight for Los
Angeles to address the Chamber of
Commerce on the work of the Col
orado River Commission, of which he
is chairman.
"I am proud to be able today in this University, the cradle of thoughts to
which we owe so much, to bring you the tribute of gratitude of the people of
Belgium, gratitude moulded in bronze everlasting as the spirit of Life itself,
essence of the Almighty Will of the Great Maker."
Thus stamping Herbert Hoover as a typical American and Stanford man,
Senator Albert Lejeune presented to him whom King Albert and the Belgian
people call "Citizen and Friend" a token of the gratitude and admiration of a
nation.
Th bronze statue of Isis, goddess of motherhood and growing grain, typify
ing the spirit of beneficence at war with evil in the world, has been placed
on the Stanford campus as a permanent memorial to the work of the great
American in Belgium during the World War.

The statue is the last work of the
great Belgian sculptor, Puttemans,
who died last year. It was done dur

ernor Stephens. The invocation was
given by Dr. D. Charles Gardner.
The Stanford Glee Club sang the
Belgian nationals hymn, "La Braba
conne" and led the singing of "Amer
ica" by the audience.
Following the ceremony in Memorial
Church, the unveiling ceremony took
place in the Art Gallery. The Belgian
senator presented the statue and
Hoover made a short speech of ac
ceptance.
Senator Lejeune traveled 6000 miles
to represent the Belgian people at the
presentation ceremony in Memorial j
Church this afternoon.
"For long months, nay, for years
even, have I looked forward to the
day on which it would be my privi
leged honor to carry out the purpose
for which the Commission of ..the
Hoover Monument was formed during
the war, and standing on American
soil to be able to express to Mr. j
Hoover, before his own countrymen,
Belgium's gratitude for his splendid
services and devotion," he said. "And
now that the long-cherished day has
come, I feel something like a shudder
running through my veins for fear I
should prove unworthy of the occasion
and be unable to correctly express in
a foreign language, and with the
proper words, the feelings which leap
from my heart, the feelings which are
in the heart of all the citizens of my
native land.
"My task is all the more difficult as
I am fully aware of the extraordinary
modesty of the hero of this ceremony.
I think it will be enough for the pur
pose that I would say to him in very
plain words that we all here know and
feel, that it is Stanford University
which he so dearly loves, and above
all, the great, the grand American na
tion, that we are honoring in the per
son of one of the first scholars of this
University, of one of the illustrious
sons of the United States of America.
"Is not the greatness of a nation
built up with the deeds, the thought,
the spirit and the devotion of certain
individual citizens who may be set
forth as an inspiring example to the
people and to the young generations?
Mr. Hoover is one of those citizens
but his citizenship goes even beyond
these shores. Need I remind you that
he has been also nominated by King
Albert, a Citizen of Belgium and the
Friend of the Belgium people, which
title no other man in the world pos
sesses because it is the acknowledge
ment by a nation of what no other
man has acquired—the actual pres
ervation of the life of the people of
that nation."
Senator Lejeune set fourth some of
the reasons why Hoover's work stands
so high in the esteem of the Belgian
people.
"He is a self-made man who decided
to become an engineer of repute and
by hard work obtained a degree at the
age of twenty-one. His achievements
as an engineer in America, Australia,
China, and elsewhere, are important
but not direct in their effects on civ
ilization.
"Here, we are at the cross-roads,"
declared Lejeune, "and we must draw
a line between those who may be in
directly an asset to their country by
their business capacities wielded to
suit the ends of their own interests
and those who, inspired by loftier
ideals, consider and understand that
fortune and wealth are a means to do
good—not the object of life and that
the faculties and power which a gifted
human being can possess to produce
wealth are to serve for the purpose of
directly benefitting under his own
guidance and clear judgment the inter
ests of his country and the cause of
civilization and humanity. The Amer
ican citizen whom I have in mind and
who was educated in this University
is one of those."
Senator Lejeune described the in
tervention of the American govern
ment during the war when starvation
faced the Belgian people, the creation
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium, and the appointment of Hoover
to head the commission.
"The American government put the

right man in the right place," said
Lejeune. "All through the long years
of the war never did the nine and a
half millions of poor suffering human
creatures pray in vain for their daily
bread and their courage and faith in
the dawn of delivery and justice was
kept alive.
"Forgive me, Mr. Hoover, but 1
must add that the unimpeachable hon
esty and righteousness of the organ
izing spirit of the Commission for Re
lief was praised so highly as to draw
from the lips of the German governor
general, von-Bissing, the following
words:
" '1 fully trust Mr. Hoover although
I know quite well that he in constant
touch with the French and British
governments and that he is at heart
with our enemies.'
"Is it surprising that he who could
command respect from our bitterest
foe whose name is hated and shall
continue to be hated by generations
in Belgium as a synonym of despotic
barbarism, could also, by his call to
the generous feelings of the great na
tion he belongs to, persuade his own
countrymen to forfeit of their own
free will, a part of their own food in
favor of the sufferers?
"I am here to remind you after four
years that we have not forgotten the
voluntary sacrifice the American peo
ple imposed upon themselves."
Senator Lejeune told of how,
through the efforts of Herbert Hoover,
the surplus from the Commission for
Relief in Belgium was turned over to
the development of higher education
in Belgium.
In closing, he said, "What greater
thought could be more simply and
more effectively carried out than it
has by the sons and daughters of the
United States of America and in par
ticular by Mr. Hoover? And is not
as I said at the start, the generous
and thoughtful American spirit cou
pled with American high training and
education —namely, the training of
Stanford University responsible for all
this?"
Hoover will leave tonight for Los
Angeles to address the Chamber of
Commerce on the work of the Col
orado River Commission, of which he
is chairman.
"I am proud to be able today in this University, the cradle of thoughts to
which we owe so much, to bring you the tribute of gratitude of the people of
Belgium, gratitude moulded in bronze everlasting as the spirit of Life itself,
essence of the Almighty Will of the Great Maker."
Thus stamping Herbert Hoover as a typical American and Stanford man,
Senator Albert Lejeune presented to him whom King Albert and the Belgian
people call "Citizen and Friend" a token of the gratitude and admiration of a
nation.
Th bronze statue of Isis, goddess of motherhood and growing grain, typify
ing the spirit of beneficence at war with evil in the world, has been placed
on the Stanford campus as a permanent memorial to the work of the great
American in Belgium during the World War.

The statue is the last work of the
great Belgian sculptor, Puttemans,
who died last year. It was done dur
ing the war.
The workmen at the Fondrie Nation
ale des Bronzes, where the statue was
finished, were, with the rest of Bel
gian workmen, under an eight-hour
law at that time. In order to finish
the statue in a given time, they work
ed more than eight hours on many oc
casions. When Senator Lejeune called
the workmen together to thank them,
the foreman declared that the men
welcomed the opportunity to show
their appreciation of Hoover's work.
Senator Lejeune was introduced by
President Wilbur, who made a brief
talk of welcome.
M. Jules Simon, the Belgian consul
in San Francisco, who was designated
as the official representative of the
Belgian government, spoke briefly and
was followed by Frank Deering of the
University Board of Trustees who for
mally accepted the honor of having
the statue placed on the campus.
Others who spoke briefly were Pres
ident David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California, and the Honor
able Egerton Shore, representing Gov
ernor Stephens. The invocation was
given by Dr. D. Charles Gardner.

services and devotion," he said. "And
now that the long-cherished day has
come, I feel something like a shudder
running through my veins for fear I
should prove unworthy of the occasion
and be unable to correctly express in
a foreign language, and with the
proper words, the feelings which leap
from my heart, the feelings which are
in the heart of all the citizens of my
native land.
"My task is all the more difficult as
I am fully aware of the extraordinary
modesty of the hero of this ceremony.
I think it will be enough for the pur
pose that I would say to him in very
plain words that we all here know and
feel, that it is Stanford University
which he so dearly loves, and above
all, the great, the grand American na
tion, that we are honoring in the per
son of one of the first scholars of this
University, of one of the illustrious
sons of the United States of America.
"Is not the greatness of a nation
built up with the deeds, the thought,
the spirit and the devotion of certain
individual citizens who may be set
forth as an inspiring example to the
people and to the young generations?
Mr. Hoover is one of those citizens
but his citizenship goes even beyond
these shores. Need I remind you that
he has been also nominated by King
Albert, a Citizen of Belgium and the
Friend of the Belgium people, which
title no other man in the world pos
sesses because it is the acknowledge
ment by a nation of what no other
man has acquired—the actual pres
ervation of the life of the people of
that nation."
Senator Lejeune set fourth some of
the reasons why Hoover's work stands
so high in the esteem of the Belgian
people.
"He is a self-made man who decided
to become an engineer of repute and
by hard work obtained a degree at the
age of twenty-one. His achievements
as an engineer in America, Australia,
China, and elsewhere, are important
but not direct in their effects on civ
ilization.
"Here, we are at the cross-roads,"
declared Lejeune, "and we must draw
a line between those who may be in
directly an asset to their country by
their business capacities wielded to
suit the ends of their own interests
and those who, inspired by loftier
ideals, consider and understand that
fortune and wealth are a means to do
good—not the object of life and that
the faculties and power which a gifted
human being can possess to produce
wealth are to serve for the purpose of
directly benefitting under his own
guidance and clear judgment the inter
ests of his country and the cause of
civilization and humanity. The Amer
ican citizen whom I have in mind and
who was educated in this University
is one of those."
Senator Lejeune described the in
tervention of the American govern
ment during the war when starvation
faced the Belgian people, the creation
of the Commission for Relief in Bel
gium, and the appointment of Hoover
to head the commission.
"The American government put the

right man in the right place," said
Lejeune. "All through the long years
of the war never did the nine and a
half millions of poor suffering human
creatures pray in vain for their daily
bread and their courage and faith in
the dawn of delivery and justice was
kept alive.
"Forgive me, Mr. Hoover, but 1
must add that the unimpeachable hon
esty and righteousness of the organ
izing spirit of the Commission for Re
lief was praised so highly as to draw
from the lips of the German governor
general, von-Bissing, the following
words:
" '1 fully trust Mr. Hoover although
I know quite well that he in constant
touch with the French and British
governments and that he is at heart
with our enemies.'
"Is it surprising that he who could
command respect from our bitterest
foe whose name is hated and shall
continue to be hated by generations
in Belgium as a synonym of despotic
barbarism, could also, by his call to
the generous feelings of the great na
tion he belongs to, persuade his own
countrymen to forfeit of their own
free will, a part of their own food in
favor of the sufferers?
"I am here to remind you after four
years that we have not forgotten the
voluntary sacrifice the American peo
ple imposed upon themselves."
Senator Lejeune told of how,
through the efforts of Herbert Hoover,
the surplus from the Commission for
Relief in Belgium was turned over to
the development of higher education
in Belgium.
In closing, he said, "What greater
thought could be more simply and
more effectively carried out than it
has by the sons and daughters of the
United States of America and in par
ticular by Mr. Hoover? And is not
as I said at the start, the generous
and thoughtful American spirit cou
pled with American high training and
education —namely, the training of
Stanford University responsible for all
this?"
Hoover will leave tonight for Los
Angeles to address the Chamber of
Commerce on the work of the Col
orado River Commission, of which he
is chairman.
"I am proud to be able today in this University, the cradle of thoughts to
which we owe so much, to bring you the tribute of gratitude of the people of
Belgium, gratitude moulded in bronze everlasting as the spirit of Life itself,
essence of the Almighty Will of the Great Maker."
Thus stamping Herbert Hoover as a typical American and Stanford man,
Senator Albert Lejeune presented to him whom King Albert and the Belgian
people call "Citizen and Friend" a token of the gratitude and admiration of a
nation.
Th bronze statue of Isis, goddess of motherhood and growing grain, typify
ing the spirit of beneficence at war with evil in the world, has been placed
on the Stanford campus as a permanent memorial to the work of the great
American in Belgium during the World War.

The statue is the last work of the
great Belgian sculptor, Puttemans,
who died last year. It was done dur
ing the war.
The workmen at the Fondrie Nation
ale des Bronzes, where the statue was
finished, were, with the rest of Bel
gian workmen, under an eight-hour
law at that time. In order to finish
the statue in a given time, they work
ed more than eight hours on many oc
casions. When Senator Lejeune called
the workmen together to thank them,
the foreman declared that the men
welcomed the opportunity to show
their appreciation of Hoover's work.
Senator Lejeune was introduced by
President Wilbur, who made a brief
talk of welcome.
M. Jules Simon, the Belgian consul
in San Francisco, who was designated
as the official representative of the
Belgian government, spoke briefly and
was followed by Frank Deering of the
University Board of Trustees who for
mally accepted the honor of having
the statue placed on the campus.
Others who spoke briefly were Pres
ident David P. Barrows of the Uni
versity of California, and the Honor
able Egerton Shore, representing Gov
ernor Stephens. The invocation was
given by Dr. D. Charles Gardner.
The Stanford Glee Club sang the
Belgian nationals hymn, "La Braba
conne" and led the singing of "Amer
ica" by the audience.
Following the ceremony in Memorial
Church, the unveiling ceremony took
place in the Art Gallery. The Belgian
senator presented the statue and
Hoover made a short speech of ac
ceptance.
Senator Lejeune traveled 6000 miles
to represent the Belgian people at the
presentation ceremony in Memorial j
Church this afternoon.
"For long months, nay, for years
even, have I looked forward to the
day on which it would be my privi
leged honor to carry out the purpose
for which the Commission of ..the
Hoover Monument was formed during
the war, and standing on American
soil to be able to express to Mr. j
Hoover, before his own countrymen,
Belgium's gratitude for his splendid
services and devotion," he said. "And
now that the long-cherished day has
come, I feel something like a shudder
running through my veins for fear I
should prove unworthy of the occasion
and be unable to correctly express in
a foreign language, and with the
