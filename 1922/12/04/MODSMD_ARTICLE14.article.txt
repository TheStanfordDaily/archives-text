# "Atomic Structure" Is Discussed in Cardinal
## 
### 
"Atomic Structure" is discussed by
Professor George Harrison of the
Physic department in the December
Cardinal, which goes on sale the end of
this week. The article is illustrated by
Ted Van Deusen, '24.
Professor Harrison has made some
original investigations and his discussion
is intended to present absolute scientific
accuracies in such a way that even the
layman can understand it.
Carl Wilhelmson has another story
from his "Life in Finland" series. A
discussion of the man who left the world
better than when he entered it, the next
installment in "The Ideal Lives," also
appears.
