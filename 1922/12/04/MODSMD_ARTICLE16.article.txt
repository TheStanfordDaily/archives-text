# ALTHOUSE WILL SING IN PENINSULA SERIES
## 
### 
Paul Althouse, American tenor of the
Metropolitan Opera company, will sing
in a concert presented by the Peninsula
Musical Association at the Assembly
hall, Thursday evening. He is the sec
ond of the artists selected by the asso
ciation to give concerts this season at
the University.
Percy Rector Stephens, the vocal
teacher, was the first to recognize Alt
house as a promising tenor. Stephens
met him soon after he left college and
was encouraged by him to study music
as his life work.
Grand Opera Singer at 21
Althouse has steadily risen in the
musical world since his first appearance
with the Metropolitan company, nine
years ago. At that time he was 21 years
of age.
Since then metropolitan opera-goers re
quest more opportunities to hear him
than can be given them. Critics scored
the management in reviews last season
for not presenting Althouse oftener, al
though he gave eighty-one concerts in
a general tour of the East.
Tickets are now on sale at Crandalls'.
No more season tickets will lie issued
by the association this year. The re
maining seats are offered for general
sale to non-subscribers.
The executive committee of the Pe
ninsula Association wishes to remind
subscribers that special post-card notices
formerly mailed to them before each
concert are not being sent out this year,
and no further announcement, except
press notices and window cards, will be
given.
