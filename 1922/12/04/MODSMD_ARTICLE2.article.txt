# FEAR FOR SAFETY OF OVERDUE VESSEL'S CREW
## 
### (By United Press 
SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich., Dec. 4.
â€” Fear was expressed here today for
the lives of 30 members of the crews
of the steamer Thomas Maytliam and
her tow barge Tyrone, down-bound,
which are several days overdue.
According to reports in marine cir
cles here, the Maytham and Tyrone
were seen last Thursday leaving Fort
William, just before the storm which
wrecked the Maplehurt swept over the
lake.
It is believed that the vessels may
have been blown on the Candian shore
of Lake Superior by the stiff wind of
last Thursday night.
