ternities on the campus, but for all
Greek letter men, whether they have
chapters here or not.
Houses are asked to call meetings early
and make them short in order to get
down as promptly as possible.
A program, including hits from Ram's

tions, will be presented, including the
Ram's Head orchestra.
