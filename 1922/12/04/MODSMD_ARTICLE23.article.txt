# WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## 
### 
The Women's Clubhouse is used by almost every
Stanford student, whether it is for a dance, as the
place to make doughnuts which are sold on the
Quad, or for a club meeting'.
To keep it in condition and ready for any one
of the various demands made upon it, requires a
fairly large budget for current expenses. One dollar
of the incidental fee of every woman student goes
to the upkeep of the clubhouse. But this amount
is not sufficient. Therefore the Clubhouse Board is
sponsoring a bridge tea in the clubhouse Wednes
day afternoon in place of the regular alumnae tea,
the receipts from which will be used for immediate
running expenses.
The clubhouse belongs to the women of the Uni
versity, but few of them realize how important it
is to them, and how much they would miss it if it
were not here. Their services should not end with
the payment of their $1 fee. The faculty and the
alumnae take the burden of looking out for it. The
surprising thing is that most of these women who
are acting in the interest of the clubhouse at present
are the same ones who were in college when it was
built and who took an important part in working for
it and obtaining it for Stanford.
Those \vho use the clubhouse the most are the
ones who do the least for it. It is always open for
club meetings, or any other form of student activity.
Its kitchen is well stocked with dishes which may
be used at any time. Its pianos are available for
students who wish to practice on them. There are
innumerable uses to which it is put every day.
The Clubhouse Board is not asking Roble or the
houses to provide food or anything else, but merely
to show their co-operation by taking bridge tables
or coming in for tea.
