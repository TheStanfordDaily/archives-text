# BIG GAME RADIO SERVICE
## 
### 
â€¢' Another feather has been added to the cap of
members of the faculty and student body who took
part in making - radio service for the Stanford-Cali
fornia football game possible. If the work was ap
preciated to the extent that letters should be received
from people already supplied with service, then it
is reasonable to suppose that others without addi
tional service was equally pleased.
A letter from the Radio Club of the Oakland
Tribune to the president published in the Another
Viewpoint column today makes plain the kind of
work Stanford people did on November 2?.
