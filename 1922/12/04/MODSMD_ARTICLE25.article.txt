# FUN FOR SOME PEOPLE

While the major portion of the student body sits
back and takes things easy following the close of the
official football season, the few men who are sched
tiled to uphold the Cardinal's honor against the
Pittsburgh Blue and Gold on December 30 must of
necessity keep up the daily grind. It is a rather
bleak prospect for the members of Stanford Varsity
who have thus to train and to sacrifice time with
out a break until after the finals are over and even
well into the vacation period. Football seasons grow
tiresome enough when only of the regular length,
but when post season games are scheduled, the
players are eventually the goats.
It is worth a lot to Stanford students to see their
team in action against probably the best the East
has to offer this year, but if local enthusiasts appreci
ate what is being done for them, they might lend a
helping hand now and then to the members of the
squad. There are great numbers of little details to
which any student can attend and if these were cared
for, the extra work of training for this game might
not seriously handicap the players.
