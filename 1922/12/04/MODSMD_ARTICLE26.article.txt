Cabbages herewith presents its exclusive report of
the track and field meet at St. Quentin last week:
The greatest enthusiasm prevailed. As the teams
trotted out on the track, the East Side rooting section
burst forth in a cheer —"Give 'em the chair, the chair,
the chair." The first event was the hundred-yard dash,
which was won by No. 18953, who has been on every
varsity for the last 18 years. The pole vault was won
by No. 5649, of the Second-story league. No. 4782 was
severely reprimanded for attempting to steal the shot.
The low hurdles were won by No. 387, who was dis
qualified, however, for sticking a dirk into the man in
the next line.
The winners will be awarded their Bar Sand will
win the right to Represent San Quentin in the Inter-Pen
championships next spring.

After glancing back at that Vin Rouge one, Cabbages
feels it necessary to air a couple more and ease its
conscience:
"Do you know Isidore?"
"Isidore who?"
"Isidore necessary on a bicycle?"

And this:
"Do you know Chester?"
"Chester who?"
"Chester song at twilight."

I'M A GOAT GLAND BABY. Baaaa!
