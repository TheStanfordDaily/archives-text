Pen Women's Club Meets at Union
At the invitation of Mrs. James Swinnerton of Palo
Alto, the Santa Clara branch of the League of American
Pen Women met at luncheon in the Stanford Union
Saturday. This is the first time that such a meeting has
been held in Palo Alto. The idea, however, of organiz
ing a Palo Alto branch was discussed. Plans for the
fair to be held in the spring were made. It was decided
to hold an all-California exhibit instead of a book fair
only. The exhibit will include painting, sculpture, ap
plied arts, and art crafts, in addition to books.
Informal talks were given by Pedro J. Lemos, A.
Phimister Proctor, and Professor Bailey Willis.
There were fifty guests present.
