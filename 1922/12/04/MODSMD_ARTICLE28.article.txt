Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
The question has come up to many
men on the campus as to just why the
gym is closed on Sunday and holidays.
Do the authorities think it a moral sin
to have men use the gym on Sundays?
What do they want us to do, spend the
mornings in blissful slumber, in reading
the Saturday Evening Post or Sunday
supplements, and the afternoons in loung
ing on sorority porches?
Which is better for their moral health,
exercise in the gym or various types of
amusement in the city It is reasonable
to suppose that if the gym were open,
there would be increased incentive to
stay on the campus. During the Thanks
giving recess, those in control very kind
ly consented to open the gym for a few
hours on Friday and Saturday after
noons.
It has been the athletic policy here at
Stanford to get all the men out for some
kind of sport. The gym is usually
crowded during the week days by the
regular classes and by Varsity and inter
class practice. It is possible for a great
number of men, particularly those who
work, to use the gym only on week-ends
and holidays. Why do those in control
seek to deprive such men of this priv
ilege?

RADIO REPORTS APPRECIATED!
Oakland, Calif., Nov. 25.
President's Office,
Stanford University,
Palo Alto, Calif.
Dear Sir:
I wish to compliment your radio
broadcasting sation in the way it
broadcasted the results of the game
today between Stanford and California,
play by play.
We were able to get the plays ahead
of the several wire services upon
which we usually depend for the re
sults.
While we did not rely entirely upon
your reports for our paper, we were
enabled by them to give to the waiting
crowds the plavs ahead of the'wire
service bulletins.
Although I must say there is room
for improvement of your modulation,
nevertheless the service was sufficient,
and I am sure that thousands of radio
fans enjoyed it. The band at times
could be heard, as well as the shout
ing crowds.
I wish you would compliment the
proper persons who made this service
possible, and say to them that as an
institution interested in the develop
ment of radio as a means of public
service, we believe they have accom
plished a great deal in showing what
can be done with radio.
Most sincerely yours,
SETH T. BAILEY,
Director of Radio KLX,
The Oakland Tribune.
