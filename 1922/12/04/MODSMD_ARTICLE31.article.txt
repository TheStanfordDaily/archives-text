# NEW MEMBERS SOUGHT FOR 1925 PLAY CAST
## 
### 
Although "Three Live Ghosts" must
face occupants of Assembly hall seats
Saturday evening, the principal member
of the cast is still missing, according to
information given out by R. C. Bentinck.
This character, played by itself, which
takes the lead in the second and third
acts, is the baby that "Spoofy" purloins,
together with wads of money and jew
elry, from a home in Kensington Gar
dens.
Chrysella Dunker and the property
men are scouring the nurseries in the
neighborhood for a baby possessed of
a voice of the proper qualities, and the
necessary stage presence to fit into the
scene.
Some proud mothers interviewed,
while rather covetous of the honor of
having their infants appear on the stage
at such an early age, were a little hesitant
to allow their child to attend as many
rehearsals in the evenings as might be
necessary to procure its vocal responses
at the desired time. Yet at present there
is such tremendous competition for this
part that it may be imperative to have
the part played by a dollâ€”and Arnold
Bailey.
Director Bentinck requests the pres
ence of all members of the cast, in
cluding the two policemen, at 7 o'clock
every evening in the Assembly hall, com
mencing tonight.
