# CAULIFLOWER EARS 10 FLAY BIG GAME WITH ROUGHNECKS
## 
### 
"First clown and ten to go," or "how
do you get that way," and many other
phrases from bad to worse, may be
heard any Sunday afternoon in front of
Ericina when the "Third Floor Rough
necks" hold the "Cauliflower Ears" of
the first floor in the play-off of the
Rough's championship at Encina.
These games are unofficially umpired
by anybody and everybody who happens
to be around and when nobody is around
the players take it upon themselves,
which occasionally results in time out to
discuss the correct decision.
Individual positions for the members
of the respective teams is a thing of the
past for these gridiron heroes and the
game goes on regardless of the number
on each team.
Many new and unheard of plays have
been staged by these would-be stars of
the "pigskin" and many new rulings are
made and used for the special difficulties
encountered.
