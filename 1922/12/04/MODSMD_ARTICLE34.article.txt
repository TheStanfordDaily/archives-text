A. Phimister Proctor's recently com
pleted "Circuit-Rider" will be the center
of interest at a reception in his studio
ort the campus Wednesday.
Unveiling of the statue in Salem, Ore.,
will take place some time in April, ac
cording to Proctor. fhe figure repre
sents a "circuit rider," or traveling min
ister of the old West, mounted on a
gaunt steed. The sculptor has caught
the earnestness of spirit which typified
the heroic preachers of earlier daysâ€”
the rider's face is bent over a book, his
head is bare, his long hair in ruffled in
the wind.
Proctor will begin work soon on a
head of Dr. J. K. McKenzie, known
throughout the Northwest as a leading
clergyman of that section. The model
is being dene in recognition of Dr. Mc-
Kenzie's work in securing a new hospital
for Portland.
