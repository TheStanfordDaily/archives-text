## 
### 
With the advent of cold weather
there also arrive what may be termed
"seasonal fire hazards." Among these
is found tne oil heater, so commonly
used throughout the country. Fire
Marshal Ed Lamb has called attention
to the following information sent out
by the National Board of Fire Under
writers, in order to prevent possible
fires 011 the campus through their use.
While kerosene is not as hazardous
as gasoline, it gives off vapors that
are inflammable and explosive when
mixed with air in proper proportion.
Numerous fires have been caused by
filling the reservoir when the wick was
lighted. All filling should be done by
daylight and away from open fires or
lights. Another prolific fire cause is
that from placing heaters where they
may come in contact with curtains or
other light and highly inflammable
house furnishings.
The portability of this device is in
itself a hazard. Not being secured in
place, it is easily overturned. The
heater snould never be carried about
or moved while lighted.
