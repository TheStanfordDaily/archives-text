# Hoover Speaks At Statue Dedication
## Secretary Accepts Gift of Belgian Nation in Behalf of Relief Commission Members 
### 
"In behalf of the Hoover Memorial, and in the name of the King and the
Belgian people, I dedicate this monument to Herbert Hoover for the work
he has done in the preservation of life temporal and life spiritual of the
Belgian people," said Senator Albert Lejeune in the formal presentation of
the statue of Isis yesterday afternoon in the Art Gallery.
Before the assembled group of the members of the faculty and a small
number of invited guests, the statue was slowly unveiled by Germaine Collette,

Golden Isis in heroic size appeared at the back of the Gallery as a great

in London, the sculptor Puttemans,
and to him was entrusted the care of
making the memorial. The subject
chosen was one symbolic of life and
the life preserved to our unfortunate

Made Possible by Refugees
"The statue was made through the
contributions of the refugees first of
all. Those who could gave their
pounds, their number unfortunately
