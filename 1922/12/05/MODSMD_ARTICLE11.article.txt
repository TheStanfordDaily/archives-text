# Hoover Speaks At Statue Dedication
## Secretary Accepts Gift of Belgian Nation in Behalf of Relief Commission Members 
### 
"In behalf of the Hoover Memorial, and in the name of the King and the
Belgian people, I dedicate this monument to Herbert Hoover for the work
he has done in the preservation of life temporal and life spiritual of the
Belgian people," said Senator Albert Lejeune in the formal presentation of
the statue of Isis yesterday afternoon in the Art Gallery.
Before the assembled group of the members of the faculty and a small
number of invited guests, the statue was slowly unveiled by Germaine Collette,
a student from Belgium at Stanford University on a Commission for Relief
in Belgium scholarship, and Frances Willis, *20, who was a student at the
University of Brussels, Belgium, on a similar scholarship in 1920-21. The
Golden Isis in heroic size appeared at the back of the Gallery as a great
benign goddess and seemed to truly represent the spirit of good and benefi
cence.

History of Statue
Senator Lejeune gave a short sketch
of the history of the statue. "During
the war among a number of Belgian
refugees in London," he said, "the idea
started to present a token of our
thankfulness to Herbert Hoover for
his work in connection with the Amer
ican Relief Administration in 'Bel
gium.
"You know that refugees during the
war were not in possession of their
belongings and you will understand
that their task, was perhaps a difficult
one. They had one of their compatriots
in London, the sculptor Puttemans,
and to him was entrusted the care of
making the memorial. The subject
chosen was one symbolic of life and
the life preserved to our unfortunate
fellow citizens remaining in occupied
territory by the work of the Commis
sion for Relief in Belgium and in par
ticular of Mr. Herbert Hoover.
Made Possible by Refugees
"The statue was made through the
contributions of the refugees first of
all. Those who could gave their
pounds, their number unfortunately
was not great, and those who had not
pounds gave of their sixpences and
their pennies. There was never one
who refused or did not ask to give to
this monument of giatitude. Even the
soldiers in the trenches, some of whom
never saw their families or their
homes, contributed to this same monu
ment.
"On the base of the monument you
read the words, 'Je suis ce qui a ete,
ce qui est. et ce qui sera, et nul homme
mortal a jamais lev 6 la voile qui me
couvre,' which put into words is the
.symbol of life personified by the veiled
statue of Isis."
Senator Lejeune's final words were,
"I entrust the monument into the
hands of the president of Stanford
University that he should keep this
trust for the American nation."
"Adequate Response Impossible"
In reply to this speech Herbert
Hoover said. "It would be impossible
to find within the human heart or
â– within the human mind an adequate
response for the tribute that I have
received today. I feel, however, that
nothing of the accomplishments of the
Commission for Relief in Belgium was
made by one man alone, but it was
made by some 200 Americans, of whom
the great majority come from this
state, and these all practically came
from these two institutions, Stanford
and California. Therefore, twlien it
was proposed that the Belgian people
set some monument of gratitude here,
I suggested that it might be placed in
charge of our University, that it might
represent a tribute to those who had
gone from this institution and our sis
ter institution in that service.
"The great emotions that were in
spired by the heroic action of Bel
gium, that sense of loyalty and ser
vice that awakened the entire world,
came to America as voluntarily as it
came to Europe, and America, in the
Belgium Relief, sought an expression
during the early years of the war of
the emotion that was impelled by Bel
gian heroism. It was fortunate for the
university men of California and Stan
ford that we should have been trusted
of all the people in America with this
task.
Memorial to University Men
"I like to feel that we have here a
memorial to the service of university
men and the appropriate place for that
memorial is in this University. I thank
you. Senator, for this tribute to the
men and women of my University,"
concluded Hoover, almost unable to
finish his last sentence.
At the general university assembly
in the Memorial Church previous to
the formal presentation, Senator Le
jeune spoke in eulogy of Hoover and
of the gratitude which the Belgian
people felt toward him.
Consul Jules Simon Speaks
Consul-General Jules Simon, the Bel
gian consul in San Francisco, who was
.selected as the official representative
of the Belgian government, gave a
brief address in the Church. "Hoover,
who saved the Belgian people from
starvation," he said, "will live in the
hearts of all the Belgians." He empha
sized Hoover's unselfish work during
the years of the war.
"Will Strengthen Character"
Frank Deering of the University
Board of Trustees spoke for that body
in acknowledging the honor of having
the statue placed on the Stanford
campus. "The trustees wish to empha
size the good which this memorial
will bring to this character-building in
stitution. This symbol of what
Belgium did will turn our thoughts
to heroism and loyalty to prin
ciple impossible to forget. Belgium
placed her obligation above life
and then came the deluge of horrors.
The statue is a living memory of what
men and women may do and proves
that they may not compromise their
honor. The characters of future Stan
ford students who gaze upon the
statue will be strengthened by this
thought."
"Human Spirit Unconquerable"
The University of California was
represented by President David P.
Barrows. "Belgium has proved for all
time," he said, "that the human spirit

is unconquerable." He emphasized the
fact that, despite the innumerable dif
ficulties, the arrival of food in Belgium
was uninterrupted and that the supply
never failed during the four terrible
years. "To you," he said, addressing
the people of Stanford, "is the honor
of having led in this work and the
honor of having furnished the great
son who was indispensable at that
time."
The Honorable Egerton Shore spoke
as a representative of Governor Ste
phens and from the standpoint of the
State of California. His message from
Governor Stephens was, "California is
highly honored that such an auspicious
event should take place at this Uni
versity which is representative of
some of the fundamental ideals of the
commonwealth." In speaking of
Hoover, Shore said, "As Stanford is
proud of him as one of her first alum
ni, so California is proud of him as
one of her foremost and honored citi
zens."
President Wilbur presided at the
assembly in the Memorial Church and
introduced the various speakers.
