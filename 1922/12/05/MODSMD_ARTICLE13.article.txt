# Sophomore Play, With War for Background, Avoids Stereotype
## 
### 
"Three Live Ghosts," the 1925 soph
omore play, to be produced on Satur
day evening, has for its background
the Great War. Although its authors,
Frederick Isliam and Max Marcin,
have introduced several policemen,
soldiers and automatics, they have
had the insight to avoid the stereo
typed war play with its German spy,
suffering mother, and Croix-de-Guerre
hero.
The plot is not too involved as are
the skeletons of many of the war
type. Although a considerable amount
of the comedy depends upon the situa
tions evolved, much of the interest and
many of the best lines come directly
from the character parts of Spoofy,
"Old Sweetheart," Peg Woofer, and
Jimmie Gubbins.
An attractive swing to the plot is
the introduction of the "Three Live
Ghosts," who return from No-Man's-
Land to visit Mrs. Gubbins in her

home in London's east side. The
"Three Live Ghosts" are William Fos
ter, an American; Spoofy, an unknown
spectre of peculiar actions, and Jim
mie Gubbins.
The women living under the Gub
bins' roof, upon whom the burden of j
the war falls heaviest, are Peg Woof- j
er, "Old Sweetheart," and Rose Gor
don. Hose Gordon finds continual hard
ship in her attempt, to gain a living.
Peg Woofer has not recovered from
the loss of her old sweetheart, report
ed killed in France. Mrs. Gubbins, al
though well supplied with food and
drink, feels the loss of her son Jimmie
very keenly.
hiost amazing turn to the plot
occurs when detectives from Scotland
Yard, who evidently have discovered
the kidnaping of a child and the rob
bery of a Kensington Garden Home,
leave voluntarily the Gubbins home
on the east side to which they have
tracked the culprits.
