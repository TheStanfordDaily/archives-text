Affee of Berkeley will be the speakers
at the student assembly tomorrow

hall.

"Stanford in China" is the fund with
which the Stanford Y. M. C. A. sup
ports a student secretary in China. It
was formerly known as the Lockwood
fund; E. H. Lockwood, "Y" secretary
here in 1913-14, was sent to carry on
the work of the association in China
with the aid of the fund which was
organized for that purpose. E. E. Bar
nett succeeded Lockwood in 1918 when
the death of the latter's wife com
pelled him to return to the States.
The people of Asia Minor, particu
larly the Christian Greeks, face starva
tion and death from exposure and lack
of medical aid if the Near East Relief
is unable to care for them. The burn
ing of Smyrna by the Turks left thou
sands of exiles homeless and without
food; the Near East Commission af
forded the refugees temporary relief
but its supplies are now exhausted
and an appeal is being made to the
public for immediate help.
Approximately 75 per cent of the
fund for European Student Relief will
be expended in Russia; Czechoslo
vakia, Poland and Vienna will receive
the remainder of the fund. While the
students in all Central Europe are
studying under extreme handicaps
those in Russia are particularly in
need of help. Only 3 per cent of the
Russian students are communists;
consequently in assisting them Amer
ica is aiding Russia to throw off bol
shevism.

paign. Professor E. W. Martin of the

is unable to care for them. The burn
ing of Smyrna by the Turks left thou
sands of exiles homeless and without
food; the Near East Commission af
forded the refugees temporary relief

Approximately 75 per cent of the
fund for European Student Relief will
be expended in Russia; Czechoslo
vakia, Poland and Vienna will receive
the remainder of the fund. While the
students in all Central Europe are
studying under extreme handicaps
those in Russia are particularly in
need of help. Only 3 per cent of the
Russian students are communists;
consequently in assisting them Amer
ica is aiding Russia to throw off bol
shevism.

"Stanford in China" is the fund with
which the Stanford Y. M. C. A. sup
ports a student secretary in China. It
was formerly known as the Lockwood
fund; E. H. Lockwood, "Y" secretary
here in 1913-14, was sent to carry on
the work of the association in China
with the aid of the fund which was
organized for that purpose. E. E. Bar
nett succeeded Lockwood in 1918 when
the death of the latter's wife com
pelled him to return to the States.
