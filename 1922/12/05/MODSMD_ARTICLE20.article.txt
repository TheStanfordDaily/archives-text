# TRIBUTE TO HOOVER—HONOR FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
Stanford today is charged with the care of a
monument —a memorial, which in itself would be of
but passing significance if compared to the motives
which brought it to the campus. The monument
is only the physical expression of a gratitude and a
devotion for a Stanford man shown by the people
of a country for whom this man has done much,
in the name of the spirit of service this tribute has
been offered Herbert Hoover and entrusted to the
care of Stanford as the "cradle of thought," which
produced its greatest alumnus. The Belgian tribute
to Hoover reflects honor upon Stanford, for it was
in Stanford that Hoover early, displayed and de
veloped the qualities of independent action and
leadership. Recognizing this fact, Senator Lejeune,
in his dedicatory speech, indicated that certain hon
ors were due Stanford for her ability to produce
such men.
Hoover, unwilling to take full credit for his work,
and unwilling to receive the honor as an individual,
accepted the tribute in a truly Hoover-like fashion.
"I like to feel that we have here a memorial to
tlie service of university men and the appropriate
place for that memorial is in this University." lie
could not have more neatly or unselfishly accepted
the honor. And the way in which the words were
spoken was in itself a definite assurance that this
mark of Belgian esteem and gratitude was appreci
ated more than "human heart or human mind" could
say.
This monument from the people of Belgium has
been accepted by neither Hoover nor Stanford as a
just due, nor as a payment in terms of emotion for
services rendered. That Belgium's appreciation
should take this form was never expected at the
time the services were porformed. As was pointed
•out on several occasions in yesterday's ceremony, it
was Belgium's heroism in the early part of the
AVorld War that prompted the fine spirit of service
and co-operation typical of the Betgian Relief Com
miission under the direction of Hoover. The
memorial coming to Hoover and to Stanford under
these conditions and after so long a time, proving
that Belgium does not forget, makes the honor all
the greater. Belgiurii and America are perhaps
closer today in their relations than ever before, be
cause of this mutual spirit of helpfulness.
A point of particular signficance, and one which
might well be remembered 011 other occasions, is the
fact that at 110 time in the course of the ceremonies
or previous to the ceremony in advance publicity
was any mention made of the gift in terms of money.
For once, at least, something has been achieved,
something has been made possible without the in
fluence or the unpleasant connotation of the word
"dollar." True, it was said that "some gave their
pounds and others gave their sixpences and pennies,"
but this gift expressed a nation's gratitude and was
not intended to enrich the recipient in other terms.
The day is past, it is to be hoped, when the inter
change of gifts of ever increasing value will be made
as in the days of Croesus. What Hoover has ac
quired from Belgium and what Stanford has ac
quired through Hoover, will last longer and will be
more appreciated than anything" money can buy.
Had the tribute taken the shape of a deed to all
Belgium, no finer spirit could have been shown and
110 greater appreciation could have been possible.
December 4 will henceforth be a day to be remem
bered in Stanford historv.

but this gift expressed a nation's gratitude and was
not intended to enrich the recipient in other terms.
The day is past, it is to be hoped, when the inter
change of gifts of ever increasing value will be made
as in the days of Croesus. What Hoover has ac
quired from Belgium and what Stanford has ac
quired through Hoover, will last longer and will be
more appreciated than anything" money can buy.
Had the tribute taken the shape of a deed to all
Belgium, no finer spirit could have been shown and
110 greater appreciation could have been possible.
December 4 will henceforth be a day to be remem

Stanford today is charged with the care of a
monument —a memorial, which in itself would be of
but passing significance if compared to the motives
which brought it to the campus. The monument
is only the physical expression of a gratitude and a
devotion for a Stanford man shown by the people
of a country for whom this man has done much,
in the name of the spirit of service this tribute has
been offered Herbert Hoover and entrusted to the
care of Stanford as the "cradle of thought," which
produced its greatest alumnus. The Belgian tribute
to Hoover reflects honor upon Stanford, for it was
in Stanford that Hoover early, displayed and de
veloped the qualities of independent action and
leadership. Recognizing this fact, Senator Lejeune,
in his dedicatory speech, indicated that certain hon
ors were due Stanford for her ability to produce
such men.
Hoover, unwilling to take full credit for his work,
and unwilling to receive the honor as an individual,
accepted the tribute in a truly Hoover-like fashion.
"I like to feel that we have here a memorial to
tlie service of university men and the appropriate
place for that memorial is in this University." lie
could not have more neatly or unselfishly accepted
the honor. And the way in which the words were
spoken was in itself a definite assurance that this
mark of Belgian esteem and gratitude was appreci
ated more than "human heart or human mind" could
say.
This monument from the people of Belgium has
been accepted by neither Hoover nor Stanford as a
just due, nor as a payment in terms of emotion for
services rendered. That Belgium's appreciation
should take this form was never expected at the
time the services were porformed. As was pointed
•out on several occasions in yesterday's ceremony, it
was Belgium's heroism in the early part of the
AVorld War that prompted the fine spirit of service
and co-operation typical of the Betgian Relief Com
miission under the direction of Hoover. The
memorial coming to Hoover and to Stanford under
these conditions and after so long a time, proving
that Belgium does not forget, makes the honor all
the greater. Belgiurii and America are perhaps
closer today in their relations than ever before, be
cause of this mutual spirit of helpfulness.
A point of particular signficance, and one which
might well be remembered 011 other occasions, is the
fact that at 110 time in the course of the ceremonies
or previous to the ceremony in advance publicity
was any mention made of the gift in terms of money.
For once, at least, something has been achieved,
something has been made possible without the in
fluence or the unpleasant connotation of the word
"dollar." True, it was said that "some gave their
pounds and others gave their sixpences and pennies,"
but this gift expressed a nation's gratitude and was
not intended to enrich the recipient in other terms.
