# STANFORD AND THE CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Stanford will send two representatives to the meet
ingl of the Pacific Coast Conference at Seattle on
December ( >. Since Stanford is still a member of
the Conference, because her resignation has not been
acted npon, it is to be supi>oscd that the matter' of a
final settlement will be brought up in the course of

the meeting. It will not be difficult for the parties
at variance to come to reasonable terms if all mem
bers enter into the discussion unprejudiced in their
views. Most of the momentary excitement has now
died down, so that the temporary upheaval may be
expected to be at an end.
