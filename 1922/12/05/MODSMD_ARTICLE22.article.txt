### 
MODERN FABLES
A Dog and his Tail fell into a dispute as to which
was to wag the other. An itinerant Wasp passing that
way casually remarked: "Speaking of Tails, reminds me
that I possess One which might be influential in wag
ging you Both!"
This Fable teaches us that a dime's worth of Dyna
mite is worth a Dollar's worth of Dispute.

Darn! Another assembly. Gosh, just our luck to
have it come right during our hardest class! (Pro
fessors having Cabbage contributors in nine o'clock
classes please notice.)
* * •
"Prominent Women Will Talk on Projected Bridge
Tomorrow," says San Francisco paper. These women
will talk most anywhere!
• * •
After watching the pie races at the smoker a new
suggestion was presented for an intercollegiate sport
which would obviate the very obvious difficulties now
existing in debating. Change debating from an ex
change of obsolete phrases into a pie-eating contest;
the candidates are already well-versed in the proper
of the mouth, tongue, etc., and how much
more pleasant a soundless debate would be!
Blackberry pie for the affirmative, strawberry for the
negative, and pumpkin for the rebuttal. Watch the
interest in debating grow!

THE LITERARY INDIGESTION
Pokopok, Mo. —John Dangle, prominent farmer of this
town, was severly injured today by an explosion. John
was seen crawling into the back window of Silas
Meadowgrass's house, just before the explosion. The
revolver bullet which entered the left side of the un
fortunate man as the result of the explosion will be
removed as soon as Dr. Blank recovers from his last
prescription, which he prescribed for himself.

"I sometimes wonder," casually remarked the campus
sage, as he hid a reserved book behind the library
radiator, "whether people with open minds on all sub
jects don't mean that their mind is a blank."
No, Heloise, just because the goldfish pond has rail
ings around it is no sign that it is a fountain pen.

YOU
(With apologies to Carolyn Wells, Elinor Glynn, and
others.)
From the early light of morning when I first jump out
of bed,
To the latest hour of evening when again I rest my
head,
I cannot remove your mem'ry from my heart or from
my mind,
And it does not help me, either, when each single day
I find
That you've sent to me another of those little notes
you write,
Women —let me ask you plainly—Do you think you treat
me right?
Don't you know I want to blot you from my sad and
aching heart?
Don't you understand I loved you, till we finally had to
part?
Now I hate to have you think that I'm the kind that
hollers,
BUT I WISH YOU'D QUIT REMINDING ME I OWE
YOU NINETY DOLLARS!

"Prominent Women Will Talk on Projected Bridge

After watching the pie races at the smoker a new
suggestion was presented for an intercollegiate sport
which would obviate the very obvious difficulties now
existing in debating. Change debating from an ex
change of obsolete phrases into a pie-eating contest;
the candidates are already well-versed in the proper
of the mouth, tongue, etc., and how much
more pleasant a soundless debate would be!
Blackberry pie for the affirmative, strawberry for the
negative, and pumpkin for the rebuttal. Watch the
interest in debating grow!

THE LITERARY INDIGESTION
Pokopok, Mo. —John Dangle, prominent farmer of this
town, was severly injured today by an explosion. John
was seen crawling into the back window of Silas
Meadowgrass's house, just before the explosion. The
revolver bullet which entered the left side of the un
fortunate man as the result of the explosion will be
removed as soon as Dr. Blank recovers from his last
prescription, which he prescribed for himself.

"I sometimes wonder," casually remarked the campus
sage, as he hid a reserved book behind the library
radiator, "whether people with open minds on all sub
jects don't mean that their mind is a blank."
No, Heloise, just because the goldfish pond has rail
ings around it is no sign that it is a fountain pen.

YOU
(With apologies to Carolyn Wells, Elinor Glynn, and
others.)
From the early light of morning when I first jump out
of bed,
To the latest hour of evening when again I rest my
head,
I cannot remove your mem'ry from my heart or from
my mind,
And it does not help me, either, when each single day
I find
That you've sent to me another of those little notes
you write,
Women —let me ask you plainly—Do you think you treat
me right?
Don't you know I want to blot you from my sad and
aching heart?
Don't you understand I loved you, till we finally had to
part?
Now I hate to have you think that I'm the kind that
hollers,
BUT I WISH YOU'D QUIT REMINDING ME I OWE
YOU NINETY DOLLARS!
MODERN FABLES
A Dog and his Tail fell into a dispute as to which
was to wag the other. An itinerant Wasp passing that
way casually remarked: "Speaking of Tails, reminds me
that I possess One which might be influential in wag
ging you Both!"
This Fable teaches us that a dime's worth of Dyna
mite is worth a Dollar's worth of Dispute.
