# IN OTHER UNIVERSITIES
## BRANCH STUDENT WAS BRANDED AS FRAMEUP 
### 
Fellow classmates in the southern
branch of the University of California
at Los Angeles branded the letters U. S.
C. on his forehead as a "frame-up
against the University of Southern Cali
fornia," according to a signed statement
by William Sykes, S. B. U. C. student.
The branding of Sykes, who was tied
to his bed and gagged by three assailants,
created an acute situation between the
student bodies of the two southern in
stitutions some time ago.*
At that time it was thought that the
Llniversity of Southern California stu
dents were the perpetrators of the deed.
The branding followed the burning by
U. S. C. students of material collected
by the branch freshmen for a bonfire
on their campus.
The statement by Sykes followed an
investigation by police detectives and
Pinkerton operators directed by Attorney
W. M. Bowen, representing the Univer
sity of California. Consider
able satisfaction was expressed by stu
dents and officials of U. S. C. over the
solution of the mystery and the subse
quent absolution therefore of all blame
which might have attached itself to the
University of Southern California.
