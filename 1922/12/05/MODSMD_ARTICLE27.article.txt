Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Referring to a letter in this column
yesterday, may I assure those interested
that there is no question of Sunday blue
laws involved in the closing of the Gym
on Sunday. The main reason is cleanli
ness. The pool, which is the principal
attraction, is cleaned and re-filled on that
day. However, I shall be glad to dis
cuss the matter with the three men
initialing the protest or with anyone else
interested.
I wish to take this opportunity to say
| that I shall always be glad to be visited
I by men who have ideas to express in re
gard to the work of this department,
without their waiting for the formality
j of an invitation through the channels of
J the press.
W. H. BARROW. M. Dâ€ž
