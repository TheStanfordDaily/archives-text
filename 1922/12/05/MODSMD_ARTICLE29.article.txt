# Interfraternity Council Is Organized at Cornell
## 
### 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY.â€”Without
a dissenting vote among fifty fraterni
ties, a Cornell Interfraternity Council
has become a reality. The Council will
handle all interfraternity matters with
the exception of rushing. This ques
tion cannot be considered unless with
the unanimous consent of all delegates.
