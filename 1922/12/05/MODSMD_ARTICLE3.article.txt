## 
### (By United Press 
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. s.â€”Mad
alynne Obenchain is free today to re
sume her romantic career, or in her
own words to "live down the things
that have happened."
The pretty woman, her face sad
dened by long imprisonment, almost
ran from jail to a waiting closed car
outside when the case against her and
Arthur C. Burch was dismissed by the
court on motion of District Attorney
Thomas Lee Woolwine.
Woolwine told the court that inas
much as five juries had disagreed on
whether the two were involved in the
midnight murder of John Belton Ken
nedy, prominent broker, near his
bungalow home, there was no hope for
a verdict.
