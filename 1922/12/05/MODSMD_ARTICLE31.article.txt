# UNIVERSITY WOMEN URGED TO SUPPORT CLUBHOUSE BENEFIT
## 
### 
Fifty tables have been reserved for
the benefit bridge tea to be given tomor
row afternoon for the support of the
Women's Clubhouse. This number,
however, represents only the tables taken
by the faculty and the alumnae, as so
far Roble and the sorority houses have
failed to show the support expected from
them.
The clubhouse belongs to the women
of the University, and the benefit tomor
row gives them an opportunity to aid
a little in its support, and at the same
time to enjoy an afternoon of bridge or
Mah-Jong. Those whose classes prevent
them from playing are asked to come in
later for tea.
Members of the Women's Clubhouse
Board will speak again today at the
various sorority houses and at Roble,
and will have tickets for sale at this
time. Tickets for bridge and Mah-Jongg
are $2 for the table, or 50 cents for single
places. The tea afterwards is 25 cents.
Homemade candy will be on sale
throughout the afternoon.
