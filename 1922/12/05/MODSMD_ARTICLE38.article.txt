"Throw 'Em Out" says Leon T.
David, '25, In the December Pictorial
which goes on sale tomorrow. The
writer classifies the women of the
campus into three groups, and advo
cates as one method of remedying
existing social conditions, the raising
of the "500" limit. The other is evi
dent from the title. Ruth Wilson, '23,
answers David's article in "Independ
ent Women and Self-important Men."
The "Prowling Panthers from Pitts
burgh," who battle the Cards Decem
ber 30, are discussed by Garrett El
more, '23. The article gives authorita
tive insight into the type of grid ag
gregation which "Pop" Warner will
bring West. Bill Leiser discusses the
Big Game under the title, "The Four
teen-Point Margin."
" 'The Next Ewent' —Brandsten," by
Chet Douglas, '23, outlines the success
of the trip to Europe made by the
Cardinal swimming coach last summer
in an attempt to get the people there
interested in diving regulations before
the next Olympic games.
"The American College Woman. 1922
Model," is the title of an article by
Ruth Mcßride, '24, in which the writer
defends the younger university women
from the wails of their older sisters.
Henry Mack, '24, has a one-act playlet
called, "Have You Anything for the
Cleaners?"
A center spread of the Big Game
and the first complete set of photos
of the Pitt gridmen will make up a
part of the enlarged eight-page rota
gravure section. A full page is also
devoted to the women's archery and
hockey teams. Snaps of costumes worn
Roughs' Day, the bonfire, and action
pictures of the Nevada, U. S. C., and
Washington games complete the sec
tion.
Cartoons by Hap Kennedy, '25, and
Julliard McDonald, '25, with verses by
Dave Lamson, '25, also appear.
For some mysterious reason, the
December Pictorial is printed entirely
In green ink, the cover which is an
action picture of the Big Game, even
being finished in that color. Harry
Borba, "Pic's" editor, thinks that this
abundance of green is due perhaps to
the nearness of the Christmas season.

of the Pitt gridmen will make up a
part of the enlarged eight-page rota
gravure section. A full page is also
devoted to the women's archery and
hockey teams. Snaps of costumes worn
Roughs' Day, the bonfire, and action
pictures of the Nevada, U. S. C., and
Washington games complete the sec
tion.
Cartoons by Hap Kennedy, '25, and
Julliard McDonald, '25, with verses by
Dave Lamson, '25, also appear.
For some mysterious reason, the
December Pictorial is printed entirely
In green ink, the cover which is an
action picture of the Big Game, even
being finished in that color. Harry
Borba, "Pic's" editor, thinks that this
abundance of green is due perhaps to
the nearness of the Christmas season.
