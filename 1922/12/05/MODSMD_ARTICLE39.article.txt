# Story of Struggle in Steam Bath Is Told in New Issue of Cardinal
## 
### 
"The Test of the Bath" in which
rival suitors contest for the hand of a
Finnish maid by trying to outlast each
other in a steam bath hut, is related
by Carl Wilhelmson, '24, in the Decem
ber Cardinal out Friday.
The story of the man who left the
world better than when he entered it,
in "The Ideal Lives" series by Mer
vyn Crobaugh, '19, also appears. Ruth
Mc√üride, '24, a new writer on the
campus, has written a symbolic story
called "Dream Children."
"Atomic Structure" is discussed by
Professor George Harrison of the
Physics department in which absolute
scientific accuracies are presented in
such a way as to be easily understood
by the average reader.
Discussion of the "moron and the
mad university" which was started
last month will be continued in the
December issue. "Intellectual Giant
and the Light that Couldn't Come" by
Lee Sandberg, '24, is a satire on the
teaching of English literature.
A story of the Isis statue from a
technical and artistic point of view
with an accompanying picture of the
Egyptian goddess, is an added feature
of the new Cardinal.
The frontispiece is a drawing of two
Viking ships by Les Kiler, '23, whose
work has been unknown heretofore
on the campus. A Theatrical and Art
Review section has been added as a
regular monthly feature.
