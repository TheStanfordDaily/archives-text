# SOPHOMORES WILL MEET FRESHMEN ON BASKETBALL COURT
## 
### 
The casaba will be up for a rough
house tonight when, starting at 7:15 in
the pavilion, teams representing the
freshman and sophomore classes hook
up in the first interclass basketball tilt
of the 1922 season. The second squads
will hold the floor at this hour, and at
8:15 the first teams will begin pl^y.
Many consider this first game the big
gest of the entire schedule, inasmuch as
unofficial dope seems to favor the win
ner of tonight's tilt as the probable
champion in the first division. The
sophs have a wealth of material from
last year's frogh to recruit from, while
the Dinks are using in class competition
just about the line-up which will repre
sent the class in intercollegiate contests
later in the season. Every member of
this freshman team is a seasoned player,
and Ernie Nevers' outfit must be rated
as the favorite. Virtually every man
played football this year and is in the
pink of condition.
Managers Scheidecker and Bielefeldt
announce the following tentative line
ups :
Freshmen Position Sophomores
Nevers, Frank F Aydelotte
Carter F Hobro, Harlow
Morrison C....Tremaine, Teague
Frazier, Mitchell G..Pennepacker, Clark
McDermott, G Thede, Beardsley
Kirwan
Jimmy Aydelotte is coaching the '25
class.
The sccond big game will be played
tomorrow night between the seniors and
juniors. Managers of both teams crave
more candidates, as neither squad is
large enough to do justice to the second
division.
