# ENCINA EATING CLUB MANAGEMENT WILL BE DECIDED IN JANUARY
## 
### 
Plans for the management of the
Encina eating clubs, now under con
struction, will not be completed until
the first of the year announced Comp
troller Roth yesterday. Definite ar
rangements have not been made, but
in all probability the present organ
ized eating clubs now situated in the
New Union will be moved to the new
buildings when they are completed
during the winter quarter,
Mr. Roth also stated that the waters
from Felt Lake are soon to be turned
into Lake Lagunita for the purpose
of soaking the floor of the lake. This
not only makes possible the filling of
the lake at an earlier time of the year,
but also adds to the domestic supply of
water used on the campus which is
obtained from the gravel beds that
form a part of the floor of the lake.
The diversion dam at the rock
quarry has been equipped with a new
apron and general repairs have been
completed in preparation for the first
flood water that comes down San
Francisquito Creek. The dam is used
to divert the flow of the water from
the creek into Lake Lagunita.
Now that the road which runs along
the west side of Encina has been fin
ished, the white chains and posts on
Lasuen street again make traffic move
around by the new road instead of
past the Quad.
Work in grading the former site of
the Old Inn is now taking place and
the parking around the New Union
will soon be entirely completed as the
last section, the southwest corner, is
being staked for walks, shrubs, and
lawns. Grass recently planted in front
of the Library and at the Union is well
above the ground.
It was stated that preparations sim
ilar to the Big Game will be made for
the Pittsburgh game on December 30.
Exactly what will be done concerning
the traffic regulations will depend upon
the size of the crowd attending.
