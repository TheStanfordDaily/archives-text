# CARDINAL GRIDMEN START WORK AGAIN AFTER WEEK'S REST
## Varsity Will Practice Three Times a Week; Pittsburgh Is Among Leaders in East 
### 
After a week of rest, during which
training rules were suspended, the
Cardinal gridmen who will uphold the
reputation of Western football against
Pittsburgh, took up Jhe grind once
more yesterday afternoon.
Stanford is one of the few centers
of gridiron activity in the country,
most of the universities and high
schools having shut down on the turf
until next fall. At Los Angeles the
Trojans are still keeping in trim for
the expected New Year's game, while
St. Mary's will make a trip to the
Hawaiian Islands.
Lawson Is Out For Season
There was nothing in the way of
strenuous exercise at the varsity
practice field yesterday, the majority
of the men being content to take a
few kicks at the pigskin, catch a few
passes, and let it go at that. When
Coach Kerr counted noses, he found
that his squad was practically intact.
Jim Lawson is the only one of the
regulars who is certain to be out of the
tussle with the Panthers. Captain De-
Groot's knee still needs rest and Nor
man Cleaveland, who ought never to
have played at all in the Washington
or California games, has his leg in a
cast.
Three times a week the Cards will
go inside ihat green fence to learn
more football and get themselves in
the condition they were in for the
clash with California. When examina
tions come, there will be a lay-off of
about a week, and then Kerr and
Thornhill will start into work in real
earnest, drilling the men every day
during the holidays.
Panthers' Record Is Strong
What chance has Stanford against
Glenn Warner's outfit? "Tiny" Thorn
hill, for one, thinks that the Cards will
have to play better than they did in
the Big Game if they are to win. Pitts
burgh, from all that Thornhill can
learn, has an eleven this year that is
at least on a par with Andy Smith's
machine.
If the team turned out by Glenn
Warner, the "old master," is beaten
by an eleven coached by Andy Kerr,
one of Warner's disciples, there can
be no wail in the East that Pittsburgh
was weak. Today it is considered as
one of the two leading teams east of
the Mississippi. The other is Prince
ton, and for all intents and purposes,
the 1922 Tiger eleven is a thing of the
past.
Warner had few men who had been
through the fire of varsity competition
when they started the season. The
Panthers got off to a slow and inauspi
cious start, losing to West Virginia
and Lafayette. Then they struck their
stride, and finished the season in a
manner that made a place at the top
of the heap for them, beating P«nn
State, 14 to 0, on Thanksgiving Day.

After a week of rest, during which
training rules were suspended, the
Cardinal gridmen who will uphold the
reputation of Western football against
Pittsburgh, took up Jhe grind once
more yesterday afternoon.
Stanford is one of the few centers
of gridiron activity in the country,
most of the universities and high
schools having shut down on the turf
until next fall. At Los Angeles the
Trojans are still keeping in trim for
the expected New Year's game, while
St. Mary's will make a trip to the
Hawaiian Islands.
Lawson Is Out For Season
There was nothing in the way of
strenuous exercise at the varsity
practice field yesterday, the majority
of the men being content to take a
few kicks at the pigskin, catch a few
passes, and let it go at that. When
Coach Kerr counted noses, he found
that his squad was practically intact.
Jim Lawson is the only one of the
regulars who is certain to be out of the
tussle with the Panthers. Captain De-
Groot's knee still needs rest and Nor
man Cleaveland, who ought never to
have played at all in the Washington
or California games, has his leg in a
cast.
Three times a week the Cards will
go inside ihat green fence to learn
more football and get themselves in
the condition they were in for the
clash with California. When examina
tions come, there will be a lay-off of
about a week, and then Kerr and
Thornhill will start into work in real
earnest, drilling the men every day
during the holidays.
Panthers' Record Is Strong
What chance has Stanford against
Glenn Warner's outfit? "Tiny" Thorn
hill, for one, thinks that the Cards will
have to play better than they did in
the Big Game if they are to win. Pitts
burgh, from all that Thornhill can
learn, has an eleven this year that is
at least on a par with Andy Smith's
machine.
If the team turned out by Glenn
Warner, the "old master," is beaten
by an eleven coached by Andy Kerr,
one of Warner's disciples, there can
be no wail in the East that Pittsburgh
was weak. Today it is considered as
one of the two leading teams east of
the Mississippi. The other is Prince
ton, and for all intents and purposes,
the 1922 Tiger eleven is a thing of the
past.
Warner had few men who had been
through the fire of varsity competition
when they started the season. The
Panthers got off to a slow and inauspi
cious start, losing to West Virginia
and Lafayette. Then they struck their
stride, and finished the season in a
manner that made a place at the top
of the heap for them, beating P«nn
State, 14 to 0, on Thanksgiving Day.
Pittsburgh's record for 1922 follows:
Pittsburgh 37 Cincinnati 0
Pittsburgh 0 Lafayette 7
