# SOPHOMORE MEN BEGIN WORK IN PAVILION FOR DANCE DECORATIONS
## 
### 
Work on the decorations for the
sophomore cotillion started Sunday in
order that they may be completed in
plenty of time for Friday night. Sopho
mores are being signed up to work on
the decorations each afternoon. The de
tails have not been released, in order to
retain the surprise elment as much as
possible, but the general plan will be
a garden with suitable novelties to agree
with the scheme.
Bccause their supply ran out, the
Bookstore stated Monday that all tickets
had been sold. Although the number has
been limited to 250, so as not to crowd
the floor space, there are still a very
few left, and these can be obtained at
the Bookstore tomorrow.
The cotillion committee has announced
that but one program will be used. Al
though this may be criticized by some,
this was thought necessary in view of
the campaign instituted last year by Skull
and Snakes and other honor societies to
cut down on dance expenses.
To perfect the acoustics the University
is erecting the best sounding board that
could be securcd. It will be box-shaped,
and will completely hood Whitmer's ten
piece orchestra, which will be placed at
the east end of the pavilion.
Patrons and patronesses have been an
nounced as follows: President and Mrs.
Wilbur, Professor and Mrs. Owens, Pro
fessor and Mrs. Robinson, Dean Mary
Yost, Dean and Mrs. Culver, Miss
Bunting, Major and Mrs. Leroy P. Col
lins, Coach and Mrs. Andrew Kerr,
Comptroller and Mrs. Roth, and Alumni
Secretary J. E. McDowell.
