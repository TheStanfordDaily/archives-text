# RIVER FLOOD CONTROL TO BE LECTURE TOPIC
## C.E. Grunsky Will Explain Engineering Problem of Lower Colorado 
### 
Dr. C. E. Grunsky, civil engineer of
San Francisco, will lecture this evening
in the Little Theater on "The Problem
of the Lower Colorado River." Grunsky
is a native of California and has for a
long time been intimately connected with
various engineering problems carried
on within the state. During the early
years of his career as an engineer he
served as chief assistant to the Califor
nia State Engineer, and was later made
a member of the Examining Commission
on Rivers and Harbors of California.
In 1904 he was chosen a member of the
Isthmian Canal Commission.
The problems of river rectification an-1
draining have long been of special in
terest to the lecturer, and his talk this
evening will be based upon a personal
study which he has made of the Colorado
River basin. He will speak especially
cf the effect which the changing course
and uncertain water supply of the lower
Colorado has upon the irrigation of Im
perial Valley, and will explain the at
tempts which engineers are making to
establish a flood control over this por
tion of the river in order to remedy the
situation.
Grunsky is the author of several ar
ticles dealing with civil engineering prob
lems, among them are "Valuation, De
preciation and the Rate-Base," which ap
peared in 1916, and "Public Utility Rate
Fixing." He is a member of the Ameri
can Association of Civil Engineers, and
president of the California Academy of
Sciences. His lecture this evening should
be of special interest to students in the
Engineering department, to whom his
work in the profession is well known.
