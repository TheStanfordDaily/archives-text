# CAPTAIN DE GROOT CHOSEN ALL-PACIFIC CENTER BY SCRIBES
## 
### 
Captain "Dud" DeGroot of the Stan
ford varsity has been chosen as all-
Pacific center for 1922 on a team
picked by the sporting editors or foot
ball writers of nine leading Pacific
coast newspapers and compiled by the
United Press.
California has seven representatives
and Stanford, University of Washing
ton, University of Southern California
and Washington State have one repre-

sentative each on the all-Pacific Coast
football team for 1922.
The line-up is as follows:
Position Player College
Left end Berkey....California
Left tackle....-Dunton....Wash. State
Left guard Clark- California
Center DeGroot.. Stanford
Right guard....Calland....U. S. C.
Right tackle....Beam California
Right end Muller California
Quarterback-..Erb California
Left half Ziel.... Univ. of Wash.
Right half Nichols ..California
Fullback Morrison California
In the selection of the team each of
the nine papers made its own inde
pendent selection and these were com
bined into a composite team represent
ing the majority opinion on each posi
tion to be filled.
Art Wilcox was favored by two ed
itors for the halfback position.
In making the selections only two
positions were filled by unanimous
agreement. "Brick" Muller was unan
imously chosen to fill one end position
and "Duke" Morrison's record of hav
ing scored more points than any
player in the country this year made
him an unquestioned choice for the
fullback berth.
