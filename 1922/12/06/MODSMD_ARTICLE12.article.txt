# DRESS REHEARSAL FOR 1925 PLAY TO BE HELD TONIGHT
## Chrysella Dunker Plans Scene Of London Tenement House And Indicates Thames Fog 
### 
The first dress rehearsal of "Three
Live Ghosts," the 1925 sophomore play,
to be given Saturday evening, will be
held tonight in the Assembly hall. Ac-1
cording to Director Richard C. Bent
inck, who has been giving the cast j
intensive rehearsing since the return
from the Thanksgiving vacation, the
next three or four rehearsals of the ;
cast will put "Three Live Ghosts" in
good order for presentation.
No dress rehearsal will be held on
Friday evening in order that the cast
may attend the sophomore cotillion. |
Other rehearsals will be held Thurs
day night from 7 to 10 in the Little 1
Theater, Friday afternoon from 3 to;
5:30 in the Assembly hall, and Satur
day morning from 10 to 12.
The settings are being arranged by
Chrysella Dunker. The scene which is
used throughout all three acts is that:
of the interior of a house in one of
London's tenement districts. An at
tempt will be made to indicate some-!
thing of London's foggy atmosphere.
Although there is nothing startling
in the simple settings, with the old
fashioned, shabby furniture, at times
the room will contain not only char
acters of singularly magnetic person
alities, but objects amusingly interest
ing. One of these is an aristocratic
perambulator, fully equipped to render
service; another is its inmate —a doll
baby, but capable, with the assistance I
of Arnold Bayley, of making its pres
ence appreciated. Spoofy may re-enter
in act two, accompanied by a lamb —
providing that the guardian of the As-1
sociated Students' "animated lawn
mower" can be induced to lend one
member of his wooly flock to the
property man.
