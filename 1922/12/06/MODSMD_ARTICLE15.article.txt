freshman team downed the sophs, 10-5.

that hotly contested battlts were put on
for the small gallery. Excellent guard
ing and rough play featured. The play
ers found some difficulty in locating the
hoop.
In the first division tilt, the supcrioi
teamwork and passing of the sophs
turned the tide in their favor. There
were no outstanding stars for the win
ners, but good all-around work kept the
ball down under the frosh basket a
greater part of the time. Ernie Nevers,
the big boy from a state champion team
in Nebraska and who starred for Santa
Rosa last year, was the outstanding
figure on the court. Nevers played just
about two-thirds of the game for his
team. He followed the ball all over the
court and was always on top of the man
in whose possession it was. He seemed
to be able to anticipate every pass, and
if all the frosh had fought like their
coach did they would have won easily.
'Carter at forward also played well.

the half were holding a 7 to 5 advantage.

floor work enabled them to increase this
lead in the second period.

Holding the lead from the start, the
sophomores downed the frosh in the first
game of the interclass basketball sched
ule played last night in the Pavilion, 17
to 11. In a preliminary game, the second
freshman team downed the sophs, 10-5.
The going in both tilts was fast, and
while none of the teams showed any
marked degree of teamwork, the indi
vidual efforts of the players was such
that hotly contested battlts were put on
for the small gallery. Excellent guard
ing and rough play featured. The play
ers found some difficulty in locating the
hoop.
In the first division tilt, the supcrioi
teamwork and passing of the sophs
turned the tide in their favor. There
were no outstanding stars for the win
ners, but good all-around work kept the
ball down under the frosh basket a
greater part of the time. Ernie Nevers,
the big boy from a state champion team
in Nebraska and who starred for Santa
Rosa last year, was the outstanding
figure on the court. Nevers played just
about two-thirds of the game for his
team. He followed the ball all over the
court and was always on top of the man
in whose possession it was. He seemed
to be able to anticipate every pass, and
if all the frosh had fought like their
coach did they would have won easily.
'Carter at forward also played well.

The winners took an early lead and at
the half were holding a 7 to 5 advantage.
Some fancy basket shooting and good
floor work enabled them to increase this
lead in the second period.
The line-ups:
Frosh (11. Position Sophs (17)
Carter 5, Frank F Aydelotte
Nevers 2, Barnett F Cohen 4. Grace 6
Morrison 2 C Middleton 4,
Hoffman 3
McDermott, G Driscoll
Kirwan
Mitchell 2, Frazicr G Oliva
In the second division tilt, the frosh

, completely off their feet. The sophs
; played well and fought hard and were
leading until within a few minutes of

I the Dinks came from behind and scored
an impressive victory.
