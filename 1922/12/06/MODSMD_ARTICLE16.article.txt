# PAUL ALTHOUSE IS REGULAR AMERICAN, NOT MATINEE IDOL
## 
### 
Paul Althouse, Metropolitan Opera
tenor, will sing in the Assembly hall
Thursday evening, as the second of
the artists engaged this season by the
Peninsula Musical Association to give
concerts at the University.
Althouse Is not the figure of ro
mance which matinee-goers imagine
all grand opera stars to be, but in
stead, he appears like a quite matter
of-fact young American. He tells with
much pleasure how he is often taken
for a salesman by hotel clerks who
ask him if he wants a sample room,
and says that, far from resenting it, he
is glad they do not see any difference
between him and a "regular American
man."
Althouse is a native of Reading,
Penn.," where he went through the
local high school. After six months in
a business college, he took a position
in the Reading Chemical Works. From
there he went to college to specialize
in chemistry, his selection of Bucknell
as an alma mater being due entirely,
according to his own admission, to the
fact that Christy Mathewson went to
that institution. As an undergraduate
he played football, but his voice was
his real talent. After leaving college
he had worked a few months as clerk
in a bank when he met Percy Rector
Stephens, the vocal teacher, who heard
the young tenor and encouraged him
to study music and train his voice for
he believed it had great possibilities.
The result was that Althouse took up
music as his life work.
