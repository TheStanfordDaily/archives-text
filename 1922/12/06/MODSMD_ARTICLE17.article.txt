### 
Ssh! Ssh! Here comes the Scandal
Man! Gather round men and hear the
latest. All about the 'queen who went
wrong and the last royal ball. Got some
j of the dope from S. N. Ache, '23, in the
Cactus Garden last night, but he clammed
himself when asked for particulars,
i However, he did say that if one had a
loose dime handy tomorrow morning he
might be sadder though wiser before the
end of the quarter.
