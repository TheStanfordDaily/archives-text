## 
### (By United Press 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 6.â€”Fear that
Clara Phillips, alleged "hammer mur
deress" has been kidnaped and per
haps killed was expressed today by
Armour Phillips, her husband.
"The more I think about it, the
more I'm afraid she had been kidnaped
by a gang that lured her through the
jail window on a promise of helping
her escape, and but that her 'friends'
will betray her, take her somewhere
and kill her," he said.
"She was threatened many times
during the trial."
Officers admitted that "of course
that's a possibility" but were inclined
to class it as "another strange hypoth
esis in this most remarkable case."
