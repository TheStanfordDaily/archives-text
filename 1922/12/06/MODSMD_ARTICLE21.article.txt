# FOREIGN RELIEF NEED OUTLINED IN DRIVE ASSEMBLY
## Miss Mather and Kenneth J. Saunders Tell Experiences In European Countries 
### 
"Charity begins at home, but does not
end there," said Miss Mather, in pre
senting the needs of the Near East at
the University Assembly this morning.
Dr. Saunders, who told of the work of
Stanford in China and the European
Student Relief, described conditions in
Russia and China.
Miss Mather told of her experiences
in rescuing refugees from cities occupied
by the Turks. Caravans have been used
to take 80,000 women and children from
the clutches of the invaders to a place
of safety.
"Charity begins at home. It is our
job to help those in need and we must
finish what we have begun," declared
Miss Mather. "The children of the Near
East must be protected and it is up to
us."
The program as outlined by Miss!
Mather, includes the education of the
homeless children, fitting them socially
for their place in society, and, above
all, making them desirable citizens for
whatever country they choose for their
homes. The purpose is to give these
children the benefit of the Near East
Relief slogan, "Good Citizenship."
Dr. Saunders, speaking on the Euro
pean Student Relief, made a plea to
Stanford in behalf of the Russian stu
dents.
"There is enough good will and edu
cation in Stanford to support , all three
of these drives," he said. "I know that
the spirit of Herbert Hoover is here
this morning to prompt you to do so."
Dr. Saunders declared that of 12,000
refugees from Russia in one place, the
majority of them are students who were
schoolboys when the war began. He
told of one case of sacrifice he had en
countered. Corn had been sent to the
starving people and instead of eating it,
they planted it in order that there would
be more for younger people the follow
ing year.
According to Dr. Saunders, Herbert
Hoover has said, "We owe a great debt
to the ancient universities of Europe.
It would be a tragedy if these were al
lowed to go under."
Referring to China, he said, "Every
nation needs uncorruptible leadership."
He described the advance of civilization
in China and lauded the work of Ameri
cans there.
The speakers were introduced by Phil
Landis, president of the A. A. S. U., who
emphasized the fact that three drives
would be carried on at the same time on
the campus and that the success or fail
ure of the new system would depend
on the students.

by the Turks. Caravans have been used
to take 80,000 women and children from
the clutches of the invaders to a place
of safety.
"Charity begins at home. It is our
job to help those in need and we must
finish what we have begun," declared
Miss Mather. "The children of the Near
East must be protected and it is up to
us."
The program as outlined by Miss!
Mather, includes the education of the
homeless children, fitting them socially
for their place in society, and, above
all, making them desirable citizens for
whatever country they choose for their
homes. The purpose is to give these
children the benefit of the Near East
Relief slogan, "Good Citizenship."
Dr. Saunders, speaking on the Euro
pean Student Relief, made a plea to
Stanford in behalf of the Russian stu
dents.
"There is enough good will and edu
cation in Stanford to support , all three
of these drives," he said. "I know that
the spirit of Herbert Hoover is here
this morning to prompt you to do so."
Dr. Saunders declared that of 12,000
refugees from Russia in one place, the
majority of them are students who were
schoolboys when the war began. He
told of one case of sacrifice he had en
countered. Corn had been sent to the
starving people and instead of eating it,
they planted it in order that there would
be more for younger people the follow
ing year.
According to Dr. Saunders, Herbert
Hoover has said, "We owe a great debt
to the ancient universities of Europe.
It would be a tragedy if these were al
lowed to go under."
Referring to China, he said, "Every
nation needs uncorruptible leadership."
He described the advance of civilization
in China and lauded the work of Ameri
cans there.
The speakers were introduced by Phil
Landis, president of the A. A. S. U., who
emphasized the fact that three drives
would be carried on at the same time on
the campus and that the success or fail
ure of the new system would depend
on the students.
