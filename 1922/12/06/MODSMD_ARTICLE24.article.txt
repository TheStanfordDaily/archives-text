# THE 						END OF FORCED GIVING
## 
### 
For the first time in this college generation, at
least, students will he permitted to give to whatever
cause they like without having any sort of pressure
brought to bear on them. For once, all the drives
of the quarter will be combined into one —and it
will not be a "drive." It will be merely the result
of an organized attempt to do away with over
lapping campaigning activities andfcto take the ele
ment of coercion out of heretofore so-called charity.
There cannot possibly be any justified complaint
among the students at an attempt to raise money
for charitable purposes. It is as much a student's
duty and privilege to subscribe to worthy charities
as it is any other person's. The business-like way
in which this week's campaign is to be carried on
and the deserving character of the ultimate recip
ients of the gifts are together good reasons why
Stanford students should give freely and without
complaint.
It would be a tribute to the work the Social Ser
vice Board has done if Stanford students this week
were to subscribe in total without coercion what in
the past they have subscribed in the course of a
quarter with more pressure brought to bear. And
such a sign of acknowledgement of good work done
would insure for the future the continued success
of the plan recently effected.
It is not the intention of the Daily Palo to touch
upon the needs of the various groups to be bene
fited bv this week's campaign. Nor will it be either
the purpose or the wish of the Social Service Board
to do so after the campaign has started. All this
has been done by means of newspaper publicity and
through the Assembly today. It is for the students
themselves to decide for what purpose their gifts
are to be used.
