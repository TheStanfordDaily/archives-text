# FIGHT AGAINST FIGHTâ€”ROUND TWO
## 
### 
Quadrangle Club, Skull and Snakes, and Circle
"S" Society have taken action on Executive Com
mittee's recommendation regarding the Poster Fight
and have submitted their ideas to that body. Quad
rangle Club has drawn up plans for such a contest.
Skull and Snakes does not like to see a change, but
would be willing if there were no other alternative.
Circle "S" Society desires that the fight remain as
it is.
It is as plain as the nose on one's face that the
Poster Fight cannot continue under its present rules.
It is equally plain that the entire student body not
only wants, but should have some kind of a class
contest at this time of the year. Under these cir
cumstances, then, it is to be hoped that the Execu
tive Committee takes advantage of such plans as
have been offered and will provide the underclass
men next year with a fight that will not only be as
good, but better than the old one.
But whatever else happens, the Searsville, the
nozzle-in-the-throat, and night fighting must go.
Ingenuity will provide a suitable substitute.
