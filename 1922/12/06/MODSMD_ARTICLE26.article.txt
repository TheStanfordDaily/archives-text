# ROUGHS' OR TOUGHS' DAY
## 
### 
Realizing that Roughs' Day has been carried to
such extremes that its existence as a Stanford tra
dition is threatened, the Men's Council is now taking
measures to guard against indiscretions in the future.
Complaints have steadily been pouring into the
President and through other channels, proving
that it is high time some action was taken. Not that
there isn't something to be said on both sides of the
question, but it is a matter of closer supervision or
ultimate abolition.
There may be some justification in the charge that
the older students are getting dotty in their old age,
but this is no reason why bouquets should be handed
the younger generation. The student body awaits
with some interest what the Men's Council has to
offer.
