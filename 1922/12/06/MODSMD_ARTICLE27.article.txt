# CABBAGES AND THINGS H.M.'24
## FACULTY HUMOR 
### Launcelot Lump 
The room was hot, the air was dense,
Concentration was intense;
The prof was rumbling on the rates
Of traffic in Assyrian dates;
It was quarter to, and all there knew
That soon his mumble would be through.
But on his face there came a grin
That almost hid his ingrown chin.
"Oh dear," he laughed, "I forgot to give warning.
There will be an ex for the rest of the morning."

CLASS CANTALOUPS CLASH!
HOOP HOPPERS HAVE HEMORRHAGE!
By Cabbages' Extra Special Sport Writer
Oh, boy, did you ever see twenty silk-clad Eskimos
playing Mah-Jongg on th ; rafters? The refree counted
time out, and then the old gent wound up the spring
floor and tickled himself to death.
Count the cagers, men! Ten of 'em, and every one
of the troupers trying to toss the tomato at each other
or the loop. As Ed Poe said to Jack James:
Once against a forward weary
While he slumbered, shot and bleary,
Over by the exit door;
Suddenly there came a blocking,
As of someone gently socking,
Socking at another's jaw.
Only that and nothing raw.
Yeh, friends, it was a good game. It started at 8:14
and ended at 8:16. I wish I had been there.

The conductor: Six cents, please.
The convict: All right; throw up your hands!

"Whew!" Hugo, the midnight moth, hit the lamp for
the price of a raincoat, "I know one guy who's going to
graduate in three years—he quit going to class to study
for finals."

DO YOU KNOW YOUR UNIVERSITY?
Neither do we. But do you realize that there are
14,786 squares in the north walk of the Quad?
That half of them are red?
That the five o'clock whistle blows for two minutes
in order to wake up the Toyon workmen in time for
dinner?
That the gymnasium pool is cleaned every Sabbath?
Why?
Dear Etta:
Now I ain't taking my pen in hand to take any jabs
at anybody, but honest, just between me and you. how
did that harness buckle get into the lamb stew today?
I like to be polite, and real submissive-like the way that
blond hasher over by the door acts, so I just thought I'd
drop you a line and ask if you wanted the buckle. If
not I can use the thing to fasten my pocketbook, which
ain't very full but it sure needs a padlock. Oh yea,
please tell that blond waiter to leave my dessert for
dinner last night at the P. 0.. and he don't need to send
the check until the spring quarter if he's busy.
Yours as ever,
Hammond Eggs.
Did you ever see a sea-going notebook? Well, there
aren't any. Next time we drop one, it'll be in a desert.

Prof: There will be no final in this course
Rough: Whee!
Prof: Until the last day.
