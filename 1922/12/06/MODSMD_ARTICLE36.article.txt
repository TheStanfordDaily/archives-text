# ENGINEER DISCUSSES COLORADO PROBLEM
## Flood Control Is Essential to Development of the Desert Lands Says C.E. Grunsky 
### 
The settlement of the problem of the
Lower Colorado River is one of inter
state and international interest. Its so
lution, according to C. E. Grunsky,
who lectured on this subject last eve
ning in the Little Theater, should not
be delayed. At present a vast quantity
of water, available for irrigation pur
poses in the lower districts of Cali
fornia, is being carried south into
Mexican territory and there used by
Mexican landowners before its residue
is turned north into Imperial and
Ooachella Valleys where its need is
vital to the development of the coun
try.
For many years, the Colorado River
bed has been a source of mystery to
the engineer, and a puzzle to those
who have depended upon its flow for
the irrigation of their lands. Within
the last few centuries an erratic
change in the course of the river
threw its lower reaches to the south
west, and caused the building up of a
huge barrier of sediment between the
southern part of our state and the
northeastern part of Lower California,
thus forming an inland lake which
has since evaporated. In the depres
sion caused by this evaporation are
now situated the towns of El Centro,
Calexico, and Brawley. The river later
returned to its original course, flow
ing south into the Gulf of California.
Numerous attempts have been made
to divert a part of the water from the
Colorado westward from a point south
of Yuma in order to carry it into the
lower districts of California for pur
poses of irrigation. In 1892 an Amer
ican company with a subsidiary com
pany in Mexico attempted to cut a
canal between the present river-bed
and the old course which it once fol
lowed toward the southwest. Later
another canal was cut in close prox
imity to the first, with the disastrous
result that too much water flowed into
the canal, flooded its banks, and laid
waste large tracts of agricultural lands
in the northern part of Lower Cali
fornia.
The problem which now confronts
the engineers of the United States is
the formation of some method of flood
control by which the water can be
regulated and by which the desert
lands of our own Southwest may re
ceive adequate irrigation for their de
velopment. For this purpose, an Inter
state Colorado River Commission has
been formed, with Herbert Hoover at
its head. Its object will be to see that
the American landowners of California
and the neighboring states shall re
ceive their apportionment of water
from the river flow, and will consider
the erection of dams in the upper re
gions of the Colorado for the purpose
of generating electric current to be
used in these states.
The problem is one of international
as well as interstate importance, inas
much as the landowners of Lower
California are also entitled to a share
of the waters from the Colorado, and
therefore merits immediate and seri
ous consideration, said the lecturer.

has since evaporated. In the depres
sion caused by this evaporation are
now situated the towns of El Centro,
Calexico, and Brawley. The river later
returned to its original course, flow
ing south into the Gulf of California.
Numerous attempts have been made
to divert a part of the water from the
Colorado westward from a point south
of Yuma in order to carry it into the
lower districts of California for pur
poses of irrigation. In 1892 an Amer
ican company with a subsidiary com
pany in Mexico attempted to cut a
canal between the present river-bed
and the old course which it once fol
lowed toward the southwest. Later
another canal was cut in close prox
imity to the first, with the disastrous
result that too much water flowed into
the canal, flooded its banks, and laid
waste large tracts of agricultural lands
in the northern part of Lower Cali
fornia.
The problem which now confronts
the engineers of the United States is
the formation of some method of flood
control by which the water can be
regulated and by which the desert
lands of our own Southwest may re
ceive adequate irrigation for their de
velopment. For this purpose, an Inter
state Colorado River Commission has
been formed, with Herbert Hoover at
its head. Its object will be to see that
the American landowners of California
and the neighboring states shall re
ceive their apportionment of water
from the river flow, and will consider
the erection of dams in the upper re
gions of the Colorado for the purpose
of generating electric current to be
used in these states.
The problem is one of international
as well as interstate importance, inas
much as the landowners of Lower
California are also entitled to a share
of the waters from the Colorado, and
therefore merits immediate and seri
ous consideration, said the lecturer.
The settlement of the problem of the
Lower Colorado River is one of inter
state and international interest. Its so
lution, according to C. E. Grunsky,
who lectured on this subject last eve
ning in the Little Theater, should not
be delayed. At present a vast quantity
of water, available for irrigation pur
poses in the lower districts of Cali
fornia, is being carried south into
Mexican territory and there used by
Mexican landowners before its residue
is turned north into Imperial and
Ooachella Valleys where its need is
vital to the development of the coun
try.
For many years, the Colorado River
bed has been a source of mystery to
the engineer, and a puzzle to those
who have depended upon its flow for
the irrigation of their lands. Within
the last few centuries an erratic
change in the course of the river
threw its lower reaches to the south
west, and caused the building up of a
huge barrier of sediment between the
southern part of our state and the
northeastern part of Lower California,
thus forming an inland lake which
has since evaporated. In the depres
sion caused by this evaporation are
now situated the towns of El Centro,
Calexico, and Brawley. The river later
