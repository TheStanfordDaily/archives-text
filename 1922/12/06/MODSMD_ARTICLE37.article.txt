# Engineer Plumber Does a Hero Act
## 
### 
A raging torrent of water rushed
down the street carrying everything
before it. A shriek of despair rent the
welkin as the swirling current caught
the fair damsel in its mad embrace
and left her stranded far from dry
land. The waters rose until they al
most reached her shoetops and still
she vainly cried for help. Suddenly a
figure was seen leaping from point to
point like a young Dick Barrelmess
on the ice floes. Would he reach her
in time? He did. Saved! And by a
hardy engineer in overalls, wing collar,
bow tie, and carrying a monkey
wrench. When it comes to rescuing
people from the perils of Nature's
broken waterworks these engineer ini
tiates sure come in handy as plumbers.
