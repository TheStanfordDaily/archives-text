# Legalization of Light Wines and Beer Is Tri-State Debate Subject
## 
### 
Should the United States legalize
the sale of light wines and beer? This
is the question which will be argued
in the annual tri-state debate to be
held with the universities of Oregon
and Washington next March.
The exact statement of the question
is "Resolved, That the manufacture
and sale of light wines and beer in
the United States should be legalized,
by constitutional amendment if neces
sary." This is the question which Stan
ford submitted as her choice for the
debate.
There is a bill now before Congress
which proposes to legalize the manu
facture of light wines and beer, along
with the agitation all over the coun
try for a loosening of the bonds of
prohibition.
Tryouts for the debate will be held
the first week of next quarter. There
will be a preliminary tryout a few
days after instruction begins and the
final choice of the team will be made
a few days later.
J. G. Emerson, faculty debating ad
visor, is anxious that everyone who
possibly can should try out. "This de
bate is the opportunity for the new
debater at Stanford," says Emerson.
"There are four places on the team
to fill and absolutely no one has a first
call on any of the positions. Every
man who has any debating ability
should come out."
The Stanford team has two months
in which to prepare to meet the north
ern schools. Last year both of these
debates were lost by small margins
and Emerson believes that this year
Stanford has a good chance to turn
the tables if enough interest is shown
in the tryouts.
The faculty debating advisor would
like to see all men who intend to try
out at his office in the English build
ing as soon as possible.
