# Histories of Negroes And Indians Now at Library
## 
### 
Closely related to the history of
white peoples in America and the
United States and deeply affecting the
problems of progress is the presence
of two other races in this country, one,
the Indian, that the Europeans found
when they took possession of the new
land, and one that they brought with
them, the Negro.
James McLaughlin, a United States
Indian Inspector, takes up the Indian
from the viewpoint that he has gotten
after 38 years of intimate contact, in
his book, "My Friend the Indian," now
on the new book shelf at the Library.
He knows the losing struggle of the
Indian for existance by his own ideas,
mode of thought, and of the things
that have happened to him since he
first met him on the plains of Dakota
in JB7l. He tells the stories of Sitting
Bull, Rain in the Face, and Mrs. Spot
ted Horn Bull, the most intelligent
woman of her nation, and how they
and others got their names.
"The Negro in Our Country," which
is also on the new book shelf, has for
its purpose the presentation, to the
average reader, of the history of the
LTnited States as influenced by the
presence of the Nego. The author,
Carter Godwin Woodson, Ph. D., has
been editor of journals of negro his
tory and education and has written on
the migration and ths church of the
Negro. He has taken up all phases of
negro life and history, and discusses
how the Negro has been influenced by
contact with the Caucasian, and to
what extenr Fhe former has contributed
to civilization, in his progress from
savagery in Africa, on through slavery
and freedom, to his part in the World
War. The book contains many illustra
tions, reprints from old cuts.
