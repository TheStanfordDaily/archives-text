# BRANDSTEN'S WATER POLO SEVEN WINS FIRST TITLE GAME
## 
### 
Showing a high brand of teamwork,
the Cardinal water polo seven outplayed
the Neptune Club in all departments of
the game and ran up a 15 to 0 score in
the first contest of the national junior
water polo championship at the Olympic
Club tank last night.
Coach Brandsten's charges showed bet
ter form than they have displayed at
any time during the fall season. They
offered the Neptune Club very few op
portunities to score by furnishing a de
fense which was difficult to get through.
The Cardinal aggregation scored seven
goals in the first half and in the linal
period showed great offensive by adding
eight more tallies to the score sheet. Cap
tain Miller proved to be high point man
and accounted for six goals. He was
closely followed for scoring honors by
Dickey, who had five goals to his credit.
Myers and Austin made two goals each.
The showing of the Cardinals makes
them the favorites over the Lowe II High
paddlers in the second contest of the
race for the title, which will be staged
toi|ght in the Olympic Club tank. The
Cardinal freshmen have a victory to
their credit over the preparatory team,
which alone gives the varsity team de
cided advantage over their opponents.
The Olympic Club water polo team
will play its lirst game of the tourna
ment against the Pacific City and should
emerge from the fray winner by a good
margin. The winner of the Olympic
Club-Pacific City match will play the
winner of the Stanford-Lowell High
game in the final game for the champion
ship in Encina tank next Saturday aft
ernoon.
All indications point to a contest be
tween the Olympic Club and the Cardi
nals in the final game. In the contest
between these two teams under the old
schedule for the title, which was de
clared null and void because of a mistake
in the arrangement of the matches, the
two aggregations fought for two extra
periods to decide the contest without
result. In the third additional period
the Winged "O" players managed to slip
through ■ for a tally which gave them
the victory.
Charlie Fletcher, star forward for the
Cardinals, was unable to play in last
night's game, but will probably be able
to play Saturday if the Cardinals win
tonight.
