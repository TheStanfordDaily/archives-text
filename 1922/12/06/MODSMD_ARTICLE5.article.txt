PARIS, Dec. 6. —Battling Siki, dis
credited light-heavyweight champion
of the world, has been advised by Al
bert Sarraut, minister for the colonies,
to return to Senegal.
The big black threw a bombshell
into the Parisian boxing world by de
claring the fight in which he beat
Georges Carpentier and won the title
to have been "fixed." Siki claimed he
double-crossed the Frenchman and
won.
Irrational statements, confused and
conflicting, made by the Senegalese
since that time, however, have led to
the belief he is either mentally un
balanced or merely wished to harm
the boxing commission by his charges.
He has been advised, therefore, to go
home.
