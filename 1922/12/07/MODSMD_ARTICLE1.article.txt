WASHINGTON, Dec. 7—The visit
here of Georges Clemenceau, the 81-
year old French statesman, to Wood
row Wilson, stricken ex-president of
the United States, failed to bring about
a real reconciliation between the two
great war leaders,, the United Press
learned today.
The fact that there has been no
agreement between Wilson and Clem
enceau on policies does not mean that
all clouds of personal antagonism that
might have hovered over them have
not passed. The reverse is true. The
Tiger described his meeting with Wil
son even as "affectionate."
