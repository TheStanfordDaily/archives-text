# SENIORS WINNERS OF COURT CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
Glenn Pollard, who is doing most of
the coaching when it comes to senior
athletic teams, has yet to face defeat.
Pollard followed up his football cham
pionship with a victory over the juniors
in the second game of the interelass
basketball schedule played last night in
the Encina Gymnasium, 14 to 10. His
second team downed the junior five. 20
to 12. The seniors arc thus tied with
the sophomores for first place in the
first division, and with the freshmen
for the lead in the second division.
The first division tilt was about even
for one-half, the juniors leading at that
time, 5 to 4. Hard fighting and close
guarding held the score down. In the
second half poor passing on the part of
the juniors gave the '23 men their chance,
and they took advantage of it by run
ning up a score and victory.
Austin, playing left forward for the
winners, scored eight points for his
team and was probably the outstanding
player on the court. Pollard played a
good game at guard, and it was due to
his work that the juniors were forced
to hurry their shots with the result that
they missed many apparently easy goals.
O'Hara, forward, played well for the
losers.
