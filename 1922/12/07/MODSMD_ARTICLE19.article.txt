Expressing the idea that "prep school"
athletes do not materialize, but that ath
letes who have made names for them
selves have been made right at Stanford,
: President Mark Evans admonished the
younger men who attended the joint
Masonic Club and De Molay last night,
1 to follow the advice of the coaches, work
hard and by principles of decent living
1 get out and win a letter for themselves.
In speaking of the value of the De
Molay, Albert Seale, past master of the
Masonic lodge of Palo Alto, said, "The
j order enables the young man to affiliate
himself with those who arc associating
j themselves with the higher ideals of life,
which make for better citizenship. Man
lis not worth much alone, but gets a
better insight on life by many fellow
| ships."
"The fellow who gets along is one
who believes in something tremendously
1 strong, one who has the courage of his
convictions," said Judge Edgerton D.
Larkin, '08.
j James H. Coke, '25, president of the
Dc Molay Order, spoke briefly of their
