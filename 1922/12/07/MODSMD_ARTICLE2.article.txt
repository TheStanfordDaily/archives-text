# PEACE WITH TURKS ALMOST AT HAND
## 
### (By United Press 
LAUSANNE, Dec. 7. â€”Peace with
the Turks is now considered almost
at hand. Conference circles today con
fidently expected that the issue of the
Dardanelles would be settled immedi
ately, enabling the delegations to take
up and expedite the remaining prin
cipal questions including the Ottoman
debt, Asiatic features and the capitula
tions.
Turkish reactions to the allied pro
posals of yesterday developed no seri
ous opposition and the intervention of
America showing her complete solid
arity with the allies was declared to
have helped greatly to secure Tur
key's acquiescence.
