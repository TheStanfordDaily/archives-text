# 1825 PLAY WILL OFFER CHANCES FOR NEW STARS
## Twelve Character Parts Give Many Chances for Talent Moving Picture Is Different 
### 
When the curtain rises Saturday
night in the Assembly hall, on the
sophomore play, "Three Live Ghosts,"
there will be several reasons for
watching the progress of the perform
ance with interest.
In the first place, it is easily remem
bered that the sophomore plays of the
past have been the proving ground of
many campus dramatic stars —the lo
cale where they first found themselves
as actors and actresses of talent. Men
tion of Gordon Davis and Les Seib,
each of whom made his first big*hit
in a sophomore production, will bring
back memories to bear out this state
ment. In the same way, most of the
campus dramatic talent now conspicu
ously before the local eye have gotten
their start in second-year perform
ances.
Opportunity to Star
There will be opportunity for six
main characters to show in a decisive
fashion what they can do when the
opportunity offers. Besides these roles
which offer perhaps the best opportun
ity, and which are taken by Evelyn
Van Horn, Dorothy Dahler, Harold
Lundberg, Carol Klink, Harold Mnisky
and Philip Urner, there are six more
character parts which will give their
takers a chance to show what they
can do within range of the footlights.
Carl Anderson, Foresta Hodgson, Tal
bot Bielefeldt, Alfred Rogers, Harry
Nolan, and Everett Smith complete
the cast of twelve.
True to tradition, this year's sopho
more play will be a comedy. The type
of comedy, however, is different from
both the last two. especially in set
ting. "Wedding Bells" of 1920 was a
typical modern Broadway show, while
last year's "You Never Can Tell," a
Shavian production, relied a good deal
on philosophical wit in the lines. On
Saturday the scene will be shifted to
the Cockney section of London, and
the war of recent memory will be
given a chance to influence in an un
usual way the thread of the plot.
