# PUBLICITY FOR THIEVES
## 
### 
It seems unfair that robbers, of all people,
should receive as much or more publicity than
persons of more respectable trades. And yet,
whether one chooses the editorial columns or the
front page of a newspaper, he finds that there
is much more space accorded to the house-breaker
and the highwayman than there is to the minister
and the social worker.
The Editorial Board of the Daily has received
more requests for an expression of opinion on the
matter of petty thieving at Stanford than on any
other subject. One student is biting his nails to
day because while he left his car five minutes
after it had broken down, he found on his return
that somebody had stolen everything in it that
was loose. Another had his notebook taken from
beneath his nose. Had the matter stopped there,
much would not have been said, but the person
who took the binder removed the notes and
placed them in a conspicuous place near the
original owner's room. He kept the cover.
Later, perhaps it was the same sneak, somebody
entered the same man's room and removed every
thing of value in sight. Similar cases are re
ported to the authorities every day.
It has been said that the honor system is in
effect at Stanford. While this may mean noth
ing to those who are guilty of theft, others should
remember that the same rules for the reporting
of cheating apply in the case of thieving. Cases
against any suspects should be rigorously prose
cuted regardless of standing or circumstances.
It is time to make somebody the goat so that not
only thieving may be stopped, but that the honor
system may be protected.
It is not thought for a moment that this edi
torial will do the slightest good in so far as the
thieves themselves are concerned. In the first
place, thieves seldom read editorials, and in the
second place, the editor is modest enough to ad
mit that his written words do not possess the
power of reformation. If they did, the campus
would be living in the editor's own pet idea of
heaven right now. But for those who are inter
ested in this matter, it can at least be said that
concerted and definite measures to report all
cases of thieving will go a long way toward
diminishing losses of personal property in the
future.
