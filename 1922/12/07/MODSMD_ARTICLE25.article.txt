# NORMALCY IN GIVING
## 
### 
Immediately after the Social Service Board had
announced its intention of organizing and sys
tematizing charitable campaigns on the campus,
a few students began to work toward the com
plete abolition of drives of all kinds. They were
not satisfied with reform.
Apropos of this, it might be said that Stanford
is supposed to be a fairly normal community,
comprised of a group of what most of us hope
are normal citizens. In order to remain normal,
it is necessary that the ordinary duties of citi
zenship be preserved in this community. It is a
part of the life of every good citizen to give a
certain portion of his income toward the preser
vation of life and the alleviation of human suffer
ing. This has been the duty and the privilege of
civilized people since the beginning of religion.
Charity has been taught in every creed and is
recognized as part of the program of society the
world over. There is no earthly reason why
Stanford should be the exception to this rule.
That every student shall give something
toward the Stanford quota this quarter is not to
be expected. But there are dozens, even hun
dreds, who do not expect to give because they

feel that it is not their duty. It should not be
necessary to remind normal Stanford people that
some little sacrifice would only be in keeping with
the proper spirit of gratitude for the benefits a
fortunate society has heaped on them. Stanford,
as represented by her students, might well im
prove on the art of giving, for it IS an art. as
more experience along that line will prove.
