## OUR OWN STYLE SHEET 
### 
Or, Correct English In Tabloid Form
The first thing always to consider is CAPITALIZA
TION :
Capitalize the following:
Proper names. Improper names at your own risk.
Names of all soft drinks, such as Raspberry Sink,
Marshmallow Muss, and Buffalo Bill Buster. Do not
capitalize food served in cafeteria.
Important dates, such as Jan. 1, Feb. 1, Mar. 1, Apr. 1,
etc. If the check does not come, try capitalizing the
whole letter.
Local names: Row, Cop, Smoke-Up, Snake, Hello,
and Howaryuh.
College classes, thusly: senior class, junior class,
sophomore class, freshman class, BUT: No Class, Some
Class, My Class, your class, and Cutclass.

The next thing to remember is TITLES:
Don't use first name or initials of person who is well
known. Wrong: Uncle Ben.
Always give correct initials the first time you mention
a person's name. After that, use your own judgment
if you think he can't read.
Late at night, never address a lamp-post as "sir."
The correct title is "pleash, mishter."
Use degrees sparingly, as: John Blumph, 80 Faren
heit; Amy Ame, minus 40 Centigrade.
* * *
The third lesson is concerned with ABBREVIATIONS:
Always abbreviate the prose on a check, as : "Forty,"
instead of "Forty-five."
Abbreviate phone calls when they tell you it's $6.74
for extra minutes.
Spell out all names, such as Boneliead, Dumbbell, Cat,
Souse, and Highbrow.
"Xmas" is bad form. We have too many exes before
Christmas as it is.
Never abbreviate the name of a state when it follows
a proper noun, such as: John Blumph, oiled.
* * *
The fourth thing to remember is about PUNCTUA
TION:
Always make a dash after trains.
Write today, tonight, and tomorrow without a hyphen.
In fact, write all next year without a hyphen if you
want to.
Use no comma in such expressions as "Why the
* * * didn't you get your * * * car out of the
* * * way before I hit you don't you know I can
sue you for d ages you * * * I'd like to wring
your * * * neck ******* you!"
When speaking, never introduce commas or semi
colons, but indicate periods by a whistle. Paragraphs
can be denoted by a low bow.
And remember: Always be punctuation in your ap
pointments.
