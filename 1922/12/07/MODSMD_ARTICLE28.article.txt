## INTELLIGENCE TESTS SHOW ABILITY OF COLLEGE STUDENTS 
### 
Intelligence tests given to the mem
bers of the freshman class at Dart
mouth College shortly after the open
ing of college for the first semester of
the year show that the class avreage
was 100.9 out of a possible 200. The
lowest score was 30 and the highest
170.
The results of the same test given
to the freshman class at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology give
a class average of 102.5 out of the
possible 200.
The test is constructed to determine
the alertness of the individual and was
devised by Professor Stone of the Psy
chology department.
A second test was also given the
Dartmouth freshmen in order to find
out the students' ability to complete
words. The class average was 36.7, an
increase of .2 over the sophomore class
which scored 36.5 on the test a year
ago. The highest mark was 69 out of
a possible 75 and the lowest grade was
8.
The results of the tests showed
clearly the relation between the alert
ness of the individual and his ability
to do satisfactory work in the college.
Men who were failing in two subjects
averaged in the lowest fifth of the
class in each test. Those who were
cited by their instructors as being of
unusual promise averaged in the upper
quarter of each test. Of the lowest 10
per cent in each test, nine-tenths were
reported failing in one or more sub
jects.
