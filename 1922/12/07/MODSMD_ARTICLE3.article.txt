# BATTLING SIKI WILL MEET CARPENTIER AGAIN
## 
### (By United Press 
PARIS, Dec. 7.â€”Battling Siki, bete
noir of Parisian boxingdom, today ac
cepted a challenge to meet Georges
Carpentier in a return battle for the
world's light-heavyweight title.
As Siki had been disqualified, the
bout could not be staged in the ordin
ary way, so Georges defied the black
to fight privately, receipts, if any, to
go to charity. Carpentier's challenge j
was to a fight anywhere and under any
conditions the Senegalese wished and
carried a rider to the effect he would
whip the black decisively in their
rounds.
This being conveyed to Siki, whose
charges the fight in which he won
from Carpentier was "fixed" have
raised a furore and threaten to dis
rupt the whole boxing game in France,
the Senegalese retorted he would fight
any place and at any time and "beat
up Georges worse than before."
