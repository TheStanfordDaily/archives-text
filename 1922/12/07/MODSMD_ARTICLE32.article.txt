# U.S. MAY DOMINATE CONFERENCE OF PREMIERS
## 
### (By United Press 
LONDON, Dec. 7. â€”America is ex
pected to dominate the conference of
allied premiers here next Saturday in
much the same manner as the United
States made its voice heard at Lau
sanne, according to belief in British
official circles.
Ambassador Harvey's speech at the
Lyceum Club Monday night, in which
he declared the fate of Europe hung
upon the forthcoming week-end con
ference, was inadequately reported
and diplomats here are just beginning
to discuss it.
