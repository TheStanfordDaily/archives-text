# NEED FOR SUPPORT IS URGED IN CAMPAIGN

### 
Stanford in China
"Stanford in China" means Stanford
helping to support E. E. Barnett, Stu
dent Secretary for all China. The pat
riotic uprising of China means that
they all are the hope of this would
be republic, embracing a quarter of
the human race. Suppose the 400,000,-
000 should become militaristic? These
American "ambassadors of good-will"
are helping the Chiinese "make democ
racy work" by an example of unselfish
service for China and all the world.
The Chinese furnish buildings and
everything but the salaries of the
Americans. The President gave $5000
in one year. Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and piactically all American colleges
support similar work, totaling hun
dreds cf thousands of dollars a year.
What will Stanford do?
FRANCIS STEWART, *23.

Near East Relief
The Near East needs your help be
cause thousands of children and refu
gees are now dying from starvation
and exposure. Whole innocent popula
tions are fleeing n the midst of the
bitter conditions of winter. Recent
events at Smyrna and elsewhere have
multiplied the horrors. The Near East
Relief Organization has the confidence
and authority of Congress and is rec
ognized as exceptionally efficient and
economical. They have had several
years of experience and have a trained
and devoted personnel on the ground.
Stanford's record is unique among
American colleges. It is unthinkable
that we should not again meet this
crisis in the old way. As never before,
to give now is to save human life.
PROFESSOR E. W. MARTIN.

Russian Student Fund
Thousands of European students are
this winter slowly starving and are
without warm clothing and fuel. Rus
sian students, of whom only 3 per cent
are communist, whether in Russia or
as refugees, are struggling under all
but impossible conditions to fit them
selves to serve "Great Russia." If
Europe collapses for want of educated
leaders, then what?
Everywhere the meagerest assist
ance spells hope for their unique and
heroic efforts at self-help, for Amer
ican money goes far. The one meal a
day, on which so many are living,
costs but half a cent. Herbert Hoover
and President Wilbur are on the Stu
dent Relief Committee. Does not the
Stanford spirit mean that at least
some of our luxuries shall be saved
that they may have the barest necessi
ties?

in one year. Harvard, Yale, Princeton,
and piactically all American colleges
support similar work, totaling hun
dreds cf thousands of dollars a year.
What will Stanford do?
FRANCIS STEWART, *23.

Near East Relief
The Near East needs your help be
cause thousands of children and refu
gees are now dying from starvation
and exposure. Whole innocent popula
tions are fleeing n the midst of the
bitter conditions of winter. Recent
events at Smyrna and elsewhere have
multiplied the horrors. The Near East
Relief Organization has the confidence
and authority of Congress and is rec
ognized as exceptionally efficient and
economical. They have had several
years of experience and have a trained
and devoted personnel on the ground.
Stanford's record is unique among
American colleges. It is unthinkable
that we should not again meet this
crisis in the old way. As never before,
to give now is to save human life.
PROFESSOR E. W. MARTIN.

Russian Student Fund
Thousands of European students are
this winter slowly starving and are
without warm clothing and fuel. Rus
sian students, of whom only 3 per cent
are communist, whether in Russia or
as refugees, are struggling under all
but impossible conditions to fit them
selves to serve "Great Russia." If
Europe collapses for want of educated
leaders, then what?
Everywhere the meagerest assist
ance spells hope for their unique and
heroic efforts at self-help, for Amer
ican money goes far. The one meal a
day, on which so many are living,
costs but half a cent. Herbert Hoover
and President Wilbur are on the Stu
dent Relief Committee. Does not the
Stanford spirit mean that at least
some of our luxuries shall be saved
that they may have the barest necessi
ties?
NEIL GRANGER, '24.
