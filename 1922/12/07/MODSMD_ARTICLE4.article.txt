# CLARA PHILLIPS HAS NOT BEEN FOUND

### 
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 6.—Be
lief that Clara Phillips, "Tiger wo
man," who escaped sometime Tuesday
morning from the county jail here, had
made good her escape, was growing
rapidly Wednesday night. •
More than 100 peace officers search
ing for her in Mexico, California, and
Arizona; penetrating the wastes of
Lower California for miles below the
border; failed to report an authentic
trace of the woman who is stamped as
the most remarkable criminal in the
colorful annals of the Los Angeles
courts.
Reports of Mrs. Phillips having been
"seen" in at least a half dozen places
—all widely separated—during the last
24 hours —all were investigated and
led nowhere.
