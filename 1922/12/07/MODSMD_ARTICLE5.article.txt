# PAUL ALTHOUSE, OPERATIC STAR, TO SING TONIGHT
## Famous Tenor Received Early Training From Caruso in Making Debut in New York 
### 
Paul Althouse, tenor of the Metro
politan Opera Company, will give a
concert this evening at 8:15 in the
Assembly hall under the auspices of
I the Peninsula Musical Association.
The late Enrico Caruso, always gen
erous in his appreciation of other art
ists, had a number of singing "pets,"
as he called them, in whose work he
i took an especial interest. One of his
favorites among the younger artists
was Althouse.
Encouraged by Caruso
During the first tryouts Althouse
underwent before he was accepted by
the Metropolitan Company, Caruso
promised great things for him, and
encouraged him in every way. Alt
house himself tells of a characteristic
incident:
"When I made my first appearance
at the Metropolitan, Caruso was sing
ing in "Pagliacci." As I stood in the
wings, shaking like a leaf, for you may
believe I was nervous, the big tenor
walked up to me and scrutinized my
; costume. In a second he caught hold
of my tie and ripped it off, saying,
'That will not do at all.' Then his keen
eye fell on my jacket. 'That coat is
not good.' Turning to his man he gave
a hurried order in Italian and dragged
me off to the nearest dressing room.
We had no sooner entered than the
servant returned with a complete suit
over his arm. 'Here, I make you a pres
ent,' Caruso said as he handed me the
suit. 'Put it on quick.' Then he added,
as a mischievous light tfame into his
eyes, 'And go out and sing like
: Caruso'."
