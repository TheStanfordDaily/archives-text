# CARDINAL WATER POLO TEAM WILL BATTLE OLYMPICS
## National Junior Championship At Stake; Preliminary Contests Indicate Close Game 
### 
The Cardinal varsity water polo team
will meet the Olympic Club seven for
the junior national water polo champion
ship at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in
J Encina pool. This match will be one
I of the fastest and closest contests ever
j staged on the Pacific Coast if the recent
I showings made by these two teams in
preliminary games of the tourney are
considered.
Coach Brandsten's aggregation, with
several of his strongest players out of
the line-up, defeated the Neptune Club,
15 to 0, in the first match. The Cardi
nals showed their great offensive
ability by taking a victory over the
Lowell High School paddlers to the tune
of 14-0. The Cardinal team in these
two games displayed some of the best
teamwork that followers of the sport on
the Pacific Coast have seen since the
national senior championship was held
here several years ago.
That the Winged "O" club will also
present a powerful seven is proved by
the team's 10 to 1 victory over the Pa
cific City squad.
The Cardinals and the Olympic Club
have met once already this season. Un
der the old schedule of games for the
championship the Cardinals battled the
Olympics to a 4-4 tie for two extra
periods. The Olympics opened up a
drive in the third period that produced
three tallies, giving them the contest.
From the way both squads have been
practicing the last few weeks it looks
as if water polo followers will be treated
to another fast and hard fought game.
This time the Cardinals will have the
advantage of playing in their own tank.
Coach Brandsten will start Fletcher,
Myers, and Miller in the forward po
sitions. Austin, McCallister, and Lacey
j will be his choice for the backfield jobs.
! Collett has been holding down the goal
keeper's position in great style, and is
1 slated to perform his duties tomorrow.
| Brandsten may decide to use Dickey,
Belcher, or Schmieder to fill any of the
above positions in case of injury or if
; he wishes to shift the line-up.
The line-up of the Winged "O" squad
' has not been announced but Coach Cavill
will probably use the same team that
played against the Pacific City aggrega
tion on Wednesday evening.
