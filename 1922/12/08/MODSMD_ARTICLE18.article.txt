# BABE INTERCLASS BASKETBALL TEAMS DEFEAT 1924 MEN
## Ernie Nevers Stars As First String Freshmen Take 29-21 Win; Second Game Close 
### 
Defeated in their initial game played
with the sophs on Tuesday, Ernie Nevers
and his frosh came back strong in the
Encina Gymnasium last night and wal
loped the junior interclass team, 29 to
21. This score might have been doubled
had not Nevers sent in a new team when
he was holding a 27 to 2 lead up to with
in eight minutes of the finish. The '24
men hopped on Nevers' substitutes and
all but ran out a victory.
In the second division tilt, the frosh
came from behind and nosed out their
opponents, 11 to 10, in the last few min
utes of play.
With big Ernie Nevers again running
amuck all over the court and back again,
covering up, guarding, intercepting
passes, and shooting impossible baskets
while flying in mid-air, the victors put
up a brand of whirlwind basketball that
made them look like the best quintet in
the circuit. They played far better than
when they lost to the sophomores, their
teamwork outshining anything that has
yet been seen in interclass basketball.
Once they had the ball, they dribbled or
passed it anywhere they wished and had
the bewildered juniors completely at
their mercy.
The sophs and seniors, the two unde
feated fives, are to meet next Tuesday
evening. The last appearance of the
frosh will be against the seniors next
Thursday. This gang is not out of the
race yet.
