one-act plays to be given by the Thea
tre Workshop class on December 15.
The plays chosen are "The Queen's
Enemies," by Lord Dunsany; "Man
nikin and Minnikin," by Alfred Krym
borg, and three scenes from Shakes
peare's "Henry IV."
The entire work of production is in
the hands of the members of the class
under Director Bentinck's supervision.
Actors, directors, scene-shifter, iand
electricians are all recruited from the
class roll and are working out their
various problems by themselves.
These plays were selected by Mr.
Bentinck and the class to give the
campus something different in the line
of one-act dramas.
