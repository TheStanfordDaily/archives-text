# "THROW 'EM OUT."
## 
### 
Stanford is giving educational opportunities to
five hundred objectionables, if the author of that
opinionated article, "Throw 'Ein Out" is to be
believed. Stanford women are all huntresses of
pipe courses, matrimonial baiters, or animated
sponges, if they are classified properly in this
article. Further, if the logic used in the con
clusion of the article is correct, then Stanford,
like Eden, is soon to close its gates to inmates.
The proposed solution is to throw out the women
before the whole bunch gets the air.
While as a general rule such one-sided opinions
do not receive enough attention to call someone
to champion the cause of those in alleged dis
repute, in this case certain metropolitan journals
took up the matter in a spectacular way and
caused unfavorable comment. Had the article in
question been justified in the first place, and had
been able to accomplish its rather doubtful pur
pose in the second, then the publicity could have
been borne without comment. But since nothing
can be done and the facts of the case are all on
one side, the question arises, "Why waste time
and space on such bunkum?"
City papers had it that "Stanford women were
lip in arms" over an attack upon their fair name.
As a matter of fact, the magazine containing the
article had not yet gone on sale. Stanford women
knew nothing about it. And even when they did
read this "attack" few of them sounded the
"boots and saddles" call. They took the proper
stand on the matter and either ignored the article
or else laughed it off. Most of them, without the
newspaper publicity, would have thought that it
was all a joke. Even the author will admit that
he wasn't serious. But when such a refrain as
" Throw 'Em Out" is taken up by outside agencies
it assumes a more serious aspect, and the laugh
is on the University as a whole.
