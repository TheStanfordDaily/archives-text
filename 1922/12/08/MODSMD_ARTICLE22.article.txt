# CLASS PARTISANSHIP
## 
### 
Quadrangle Club at its last meeting went on
record as favoring the return of class partisan
ship to the campus, which in effect means the re
vival of alliances between the senior and sopho
more and between the junior and freshmen
classes.
It is natural for the juniors to take the part of
freshmen against the sophomores, and it is nat
ural for this feeling to carry into the next year of
college. There can never be any particular love
between the sophomores and the freshmen, nor
can such affections exist between the juniors and
seniors later in college.
The older class usually takes the part of the
newcomer, particularly against such a class as
was under its supervision in the second year.
And while such a feeling under present circum
stances is largely traditional, it creates a spirit of
rivalry and competition that will do a great deal
toward working off some <of the animal spirits
that as a rule brings on Men's Council cases.
This natural grouping of classes is being car
ried out in the present method of scheduling
interclass games. The seniors play their natural
rivals and successors, the sophomores, who in
turn play a like part against the freshmen.
Class spirit rather than University spirit, has
been a great factor in building up alumni support
of Eastern universities. In colleges in the East
the class is the thing. After graduation, class
reunions bind the alumni together. It is only
when all class reunions are held at the same place
on a single clay that the alumni body meets as a
group. And this competition between classes in
working for the good of the university as a whole
tends in the long run to make university organi
zation stronger and university action more
effective.
Let us have more rivalry and more wholesome
good-natured competition between classes at
Stanford.
