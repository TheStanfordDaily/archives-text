Poems of Pessimism
We've a bunch of finals exes that would stun a Registra,
We've a bunch of final exe3 that would stun a Registrar,
And we've got a lot of emoke-ups, if you know what
them things are,
But I guess we'll pass the exes, but that don't cheer us
a bit,
For we'll have to work next quarter, till we flunk out,
or we quit.
We don't want to go home Xmas, for we have to journey
back,
And we can't think of remaining here . . . my gosh, the
outlook's black.
We didn't rate a Horsefly Razz, we'd feel bad if we did,
We haven't smiled for most a year, we know it can't be
did.
The reason for our sorrow, boys, is common, though not
nice,
We dated for the dance tonight before we knew the
price!

Fellow citizens, we have witnessed one of the most
atrocious insults to journalism and the intelligence of
our readers on record. A certain publication, which
used to contain the ordinary number of ads, has gone
to the extent of cracking the shell by putting in more
pictures, thus necessitating the removal of some of the
ads, thus hardly realizing that they were appealing to
an intelligent group of readers. Let us keep up the
standard of our publications!

Wrote home for money three days ago. Yesterday
came just half of the amount I requested, as usual. But
I was happy. Yes, happy. I am not the man to ask my
poor old parents to struggle to the bank and draw out
more than they think I will need. No, a thousand times
no. Besides, I had asked for twice as much as I wanted,
as usuaI.—REGGIE THE ROUGH.

"Well, that woman has the right idea," remarked the
campus sage as he passed the gym. "She's keeping in
shape for the finals."

A SOCK ON THE FOOT IS WORTH TWO ON THE
