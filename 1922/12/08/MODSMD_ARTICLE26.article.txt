That "one-show-a-quarter" rule which
! prevents any student from talcing part in
j more than one campus performance per
quarter \VOuld seem to offer plenty of op
portunity to those who might otherwise
I be crowded out by the constant repetition
{ of some one individual, for this fall quar
ter will have seen, at its close, 110 less
than five shows given 011 the campus in
which University students have partici
pated. Scanning the list carefully, how
ever, reveals the fact that it would have
| been possible, although highly improb
able, for some particularly ambitious
J actor to participate in four out of the fiv r ,
despite the above ruling. This is because
of numerous exemptions granted.

The five performances are: "Her
j Husband's Wife" (Sword and San
'dals) ; "Loong Fat," "Football Frothies"
i (Ram's Head); "Three Live Ghosts"
j (Sophomore play), and the two Theatre
Workshop plays, "The Queen's Enemies"
jand "King Henry IV."
"Her Husband's Wife" and "Three
I Live Ghosts" are the only ones which
i come under the restriction ruling. The
football show was exempted last year
just before tryouts were held, and this
year the precedent thus established was
adhered to. Regardless of the ruling,
; however, the ambitious who are already
i prominent and those who are trying to
be, have, neither of them, any complaint
: coming 011 lack of chances. Five pro
. ductions in one quarter is something to
; cheer the hearts both of those who like
I to act and those who like to see them act.
