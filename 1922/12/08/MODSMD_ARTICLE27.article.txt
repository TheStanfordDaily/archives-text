iTo the Editor:
There seems to be a fervent movement
ion the part of some youths of the LTni
' versity to belittle and make fun of our
Stanford women.
I What right has a boy of 19 years to
; make public such rot as has been pub
lished in the last "Pictorial"? Before
he passes judgment on Stanford women,
j I would advise him to live longer, to
cultivate the friendship of campus
; women, to meet some of the commoner
j women of the world, and then form his
I conclusions.
Sometimes men become prejudiced in
j their opinions concerning women, es
j pecially when these women are above
; them socially. A Stanford man does not
i have to have money to win the admira
tion of Stanford women. He has to
! have personality, ambition, and common
! sense. Sincerely yours,
WILLIAM KEMNITZER.
