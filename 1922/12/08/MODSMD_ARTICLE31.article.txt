## 
### 
"When a woman decides to enter
industry she must either have ade
quate training or be prepared to start
at the bottom," said Mrs. Elizabeth
Snell, the appointment secretary,
speaking before the Y. W. C. A.yes
terday.
"Women are apt to take small things
too personally," said Mrs. Snell. "They
should learn tolerance and self-control.
It is lack of the 'get-together' spirit
that causes much of the trouble in
industry. If women could apply broad
ly some of the emotions that they cen
ter on themselves they could do much
to correct this." Mrs. Snell also said
that women frequently view their vo
cations as only temporary and do not
give them any serious thought.
