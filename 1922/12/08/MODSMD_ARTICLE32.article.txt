# FAR EASTERN JOURNALS OBTAINED BY LIBRARY
## 
### 
Two new sets of Far Eastern publi
cations now have been added to the
Oriental and Indian reference materials
in the Stanford Library. One consists
of bound volumes of information bulle
tins concerning India, and the other is
a series of journals on China.
The Library already has important col
lections of Far Eastern literature, and is
making a specialty of this division.
"The Asiatic Journal," in fifty bound
volumes, covering the period 1816-1843,
is frcm the library of the East India
Association. It was a monthly register
for British India and its dependencies
for that period, and contains original
communications, memoirs of eminent
persons, natural history and geography,

debates at the East India House, mar
kets and stocks, and personal items from
the Colonies and England.
The first volume is typical of the rest.
An agricultural discussion for India, an
essay on a poisonous tree, a discourse of
Honorable T. S. Raffles, and current
events for Calcutta, Madras, and current
states, are among the many subjects.
Journals of the North-China branch
of the Royal Asiatic Society, published
at Shanghai, make up a series from 1858
that is not entirely complete. The bulle
tins, in pamphlet form, were acquired
by Professor Payson J. Treat through
the publishing society, which has a li
brary, museum and lecture hall at
Shanghai.
This collection contains information
on such subjects as Chinese botany, his
tory and literature of the period before

1898, reports on journeys, maps and
geology of the great plains, and facts
on other such general and specific ques
tions.
