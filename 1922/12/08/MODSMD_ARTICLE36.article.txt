### 
Denying the statement made in the
October issue of the Stanford Card
inal to the effect that a pledge to re
main unmarried was required of all
teachers at Northwestern University,
the president of that institution has
written the Cardinal protesting against
the caustic editorial which appeared.
The substance of the editorial was
based on an interview which appeared
in the press and reads in part as fol
lows: "It is hardly ethical for a uni
versity to allow the temptation to over
expansion to carry it so far that it not
only underpays its employees but
makes them pretend that they are not
underpaid and denies them the right
to be poor. Such incidents make it still
harder for those who elect to become
teachers to convince people that they
could succeed at anything else."
The president of Northwestern in
answering the editorial, declared that
there are a number of married in
structors on the faculty of the College
of Liberal Arts and that no pledge of
celibacy is required of any teacher.
"Several instructors have married
since the publication of this interview.
The reporter who secured it was rath
er more interested in the sensation he
might make than in any meticulous
use of words."
