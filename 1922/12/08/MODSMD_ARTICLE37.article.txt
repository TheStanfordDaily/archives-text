# Fire Chief Tells Dangers in Christmas Decorations
## 
### 
Fire Chief Ed Lamb is making a pre-
Christmas campaign to warn the campus
against the use of inflammable Christmas
decorations and unsafe lights.
Lamb believes that the University fire
hazard is greatly increased during the
holidays and that death of students in
house fires is greater than is commonly
realized. He urges that the living groups
use care in selecting decorations this sea
son and gives the following suggestions
and warnings:
Do not decorate Christmas trees with
paper, cotton, or any other inflammable
material; use metallic tinsel and other
non-inflammable decorations only, and
set the tree securely so that it cannot
be tipped over in reaching for things.
Do not use cotton to represent snow;
asbestos fiber or powdered mica is a
good substitute.
Do not use candles; the records will
show that many lives are lost because
of their use. Electric lighting systems
avoid this danger.
Do not allow trees to remain inside
of buildings after the holidays. The
tree ignites readily when the needles
have become dry.
