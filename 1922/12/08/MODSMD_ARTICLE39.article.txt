UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAâ€”
Thirty thousand blotters bearing the
slogan of the Honor Spirit will be dis
tributed with all bluebooks sold by the
A. S. U. C. bookstore during the two
weeks of final examinations. This
means of reminding the students of
the practical application of the honor
system which was tested last semester
proved the most successful of any
tried yet.
