# FANS LIKE GOSSIP IN SPORTING NEWS SAYS HARRY SMITH
## 
### 
Gossip and comment rather than
straight news are most popular with the
sports-reading public, in the opinion of
Harry B. Smith, sporting editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle. Smith, in his
talk to the American Journalists' Asso
ciation last night, described the growth
of the personal element in sports writing;
sports writers now cultivate a chatty,
small-town style and try to keep in
touch with their readers in every way.
"Newspapers make much of their own
news," tbe speaker said. He gave as
examples the Chronicle's "Willie Kamm
Day"and the golf and tennis tourna
ments conducted by the papers. "Such
stories." Smith continued, "gives a paper
exclusive news and a certain amount of
prestige. The editor knows, too, that
when he plays up a story rival papers
and the readers will think it big."
Professionalism in the sporting game
is going by the boards in favor of ama
teur athletics, Smith believes. He at
tributed much of the improvement to
the increased public interest in amateur
sports.
The ideal sporting editor, according to
the speaker, knows something about all
sports and is interested in all of them.
The man who is a "nut" on one particu
lar sport will have a lop-sided page guar
anteed not to please the general public.
Seasonal sports must be played up big,
but aside from this, every editor aims to
have a balanced sheet.
Experience in general newspaper work
gives the would-be sports writer training
in digging up stories and makes him ap
preciate the necessity of getting his work
in on time. Hughes, Gleason, Runyon,
and many other well-known sports
writers have had experience in routine
newspaper reporting. The specialized
writer is rare today because of the sea
sonal character of most sports.
Smith described the extensive prepara
tions necessary to cover important sport
ing events such as the championship
fights and the Big Game. "You people
don't know what a lot of work it would
have made in all the newspaper offices
had the ball gone over the bar in the
last few minutes of play," he said, in
describing the inside work of getting
out the Big Game story.
Shortly after beginning his work on
the Chronicle, Smith was sent to Reno
to cover the Jeffries-Johnson fight; he
also covered the Dempsey-Willard bout
in Toledo, and the Carpcnticr-Dempscy
battle in New York.

sports.
The ideal sporting editor, according to
the speaker, knows something about all
sports and is interested in all of them.
The man who is a "nut" on one particu
lar sport will have a lop-sided page guar
anteed not to please the general public.
Seasonal sports must be played up big,
but aside from this, every editor aims to
have a balanced sheet.
Experience in general newspaper work
gives the would-be sports writer training
in digging up stories and makes him ap
preciate the necessity of getting his work
in on time. Hughes, Gleason, Runyon,
and many other well-known sports
writers have had experience in routine
newspaper reporting. The specialized
writer is rare today because of the sea
sonal character of most sports.
Smith described the extensive prepara
tions necessary to cover important sport
ing events such as the championship
fights and the Big Game. "You people
don't know what a lot of work it would
have made in all the newspaper offices
had the ball gone over the bar in the
last few minutes of play," he said, in
describing the inside work of getting
out the Big Game story.
Shortly after beginning his work on
the Chronicle, Smith was sent to Reno
to cover the Jeffries-Johnson fight; he
also covered the Dempsey-Willard bout
in Toledo, and the Carpcnticr-Dempscy
battle in New York.
