"Three Live Ghosts" will stalk the
boards tomorrow night when the class
of 1925 gives itß play to round off the
dramatic season of the fall quarter.
Those who wish to listen to a
weighty exposition on some of the
graver phases of life need not come.
The performance is at the other end
of the scale from "heavy," and the
humorous situations and characters
which make the play what is, should
draw a plentiful number of laughs
from the audience.
The three acts take place with the
same setting throughout—a home in
London's "east side." Although in

some situations a uniformity of setting
might detract from the effectiveness
of a production, here it accentuates
instead. The scene is designed to fit
in with the type of the play and before
the third act is reached the set "grows
on"the observer to such an extent
that any alteration would do harm
rather than good.
The sophomores who make up the
cast of "Three Live Ghosts" will have
a real opportunity to show whether or
not any of them have "arrived" in
Stanford dramatics. For that reason
sincerity of effort will not be lacking;
and judging from the rehearsals so
far, the results will not be lacking
either.
The plot deals with peculiar charac
ters of London's "cockney" district,
the place from which "Old Sweet
heart's" son goes to war and returns
in a most surprising manner. How
"Spoofy" presents "Old Sweetheart"
with all manner of jewelry in a most
non-committal way, and his lucid ex
planations of liis manner of obtaining
the precious stones—ranging from a
diamond tiarra of pearls—are typical
bits of humor scattered throughout the
Play.
The war is brought in, as the far-off
background for the reason for the
plot, but the play is nevertheless not a
typical war story. It's chief appeal lies
in the light and airy flashes of humor
which make it essentially a perform
ance to enjoy, and not one from which
to draw a moral.
The curtain will rise at 8:15. Tickets
may be obtained the evening of the
performance at the office outside the
Assembly hall. The cast will not re
hearse tonight because of the cotillion,
but will go through a last practice
tomorrow morning.

The curtain will rise at 8:15. Tickets
may be obtained the evening of the
performance at the office outside the
Assembly hall. The cast will not re
hearse tonight because of the cotillion,
but will go through a last practice
tomorrow morning.
