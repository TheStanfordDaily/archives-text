Eclipse of the sun
THIS is the month when the sun is outshone, and
we mortals draw greater warmth and sustenance
from that homely provender—mince pie.
It is the warmth of the holiday spirit, which causes
human hearts to glow when temperatures are lowest.
Mother's cooking — the family united — Christmas
trees and crackling logs—what would this world be
without them?
In promoting the family good cheer the college
man's part is such that modesty often blinds him to it.
It would hardly occur to the glee club man to sing
over the songs of Alma Mater for the still Dearer
One at home. „
The football man would scarcely suspect that his
younger brother is dying to have him drop-kick for
the "fellers".
The Prom leader would not presume to think that
among those sisters who have been waiting to share
this agility at fox-trot may be his own sister.
And in general, college men would scorn to believe
that any conversational prowess they might possess on
books, professors or campus activities could possibly
interest a certain Gentleman Who Foots the Bills.
But just try it, all of yon. The welcome you get
will warm the cockles of your heart.
This suggestion, amid sighs as they look back
across the years, is the best way a bunch of old grads
here know of wishing you "Merry Christmas".
