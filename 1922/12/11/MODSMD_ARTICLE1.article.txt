## STRENGTHENED SUBSIDY BILL IS BEFORE SENATE 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 11.—A
strengthened ship subsidy bill was
brought before the senate today for
action —opening what threatens to be
a long and bitter struggle between
the opposing factions.
Administration forces, with a some
what rejuvenated confidence of push
ing the bill through the upper house
before March 4, rallied all their strong
powers for the first onslaught.
The sentiment, as the opening gun
was fired, appeared to "be against
carrying out the tremendous legislat
ive task assigned for this session by
President Harding.
