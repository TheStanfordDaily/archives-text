# NATIONAL TITLE IS WON BY CARDINAL WATER POLO SEVEN
## Teamwork Gives Brandsten's Men 7-1 Victory Over Olympic Club and Junior Championship 
### Chesley M. Douglas, '23 
The national junior water polo cham
pionship of the Amateur Athletic Un
ion was won by the Stanford team
when it overwhelmed the Olympic
Club seven by a 7 to 1 score in Encina
pool Saturday afternoon.
Olympics Outplayed From Start
Coach Brandsten's charges outplayed
the Winged "O" aggregation in all
departments of the game. The team
work of the Cardinal squad was all
that could be desired, and at no time
during the contest did tttfe Olympians
appear dangerous.
The defense of the winners, accord
ing to several experts that witnessed
the game, was the best that ihey have
ever seen on the Pacific Coast.
On several occasions when the Olym
pics got in front of the goal the Card
inal backs would offer a defense that
was impregnable. Collett, playing goal
keeper for the Cardinals, startled the
spectators by stopping long shots
thrown by the clubmen; his work was
greatly responsible for the low score
made by the Olympics. His perform
ance is all the more sensational when
it is considered that he never played
the game before October 15.
First Score in Fifteen Seconds
Miller, captain of the Cardinals, got
possession of the ball on the start of
the game and within fifteen seconds
had accounted for the first tally. The
second score was made by Charlie
Fletcher, by a fast throw from the
center of the tank.
The Olympics made their only point
on a long throw by Johnson from the
side of the tank into the corner of the
goal net. After several minutes of see
saw play Miller tossed a quick pass to
Fletcher. Fletcher evaded the Winged
"O" backs and shot a short goal.
Austin intercepted a throw from one
of the clubmen and swam half the
length of the tank. He caused the of
ficial scorer to chalk up another tally
with a short throw from the side of
the goal. The half ended with the
score 4 to 1 in favor of Stanford.
Olympics on Defense
Throughout the second half the
Olympics were forced to play a de
fense game. The Stanford backs gained
possession of the sphere, passed the
ball to Fletcher, who made another
goal from the 12-foot line. A short
and fast pass from Myers to Miller
gave the Cardinals another opportun
ity to score. The final goal of the game
was made when Austin obtained a free
throw from the eight-foot line.
The strength of the Cardinal team
was shown when Miller and Myers
were forced to leave the tank, until
another score was made, because of
fouls. With only five Stanford men
against seven Olympians the Card
inals fought hard and offered a stiff
defense with the result that they man
aged to make the score themselves,
although handicapped.
Cards Use Teamwork
The entire Cardinal team played as
a unit. Fletcher and Miller were used
for most of the offensive work and
scoring, with the other members pass
ing to them. Austin played a roving
game and broke up many attempts of
the Winged "O" team to score. Lacey
ind McCallister proved themselves
stars on defense. Myers played an im
portant part in the offensive work. |
Fletcher and Captain Miller were in
the midst of the struggle at all times, i
The Olympiq Club did not have the
teamwork and were not able to cover
their opponents when the Cardinals
took the offensive.
Coach Brandsten has gathered to
gether and developed this season the
fastest team that has ever worn the
Cardinal colors. The team's play shows
evidence of thorough and expert coach
ing.
Brandsten's Statement
"The success of the Cardinal team
in winning the championship," de
clared Coach Ernie Brandsten, "is due
to the fine spirit shown by all mem- |
bers of the team and substitutes in i
reporting every day this season for
practice. A spirit of cooperation has
been evident at all times. We hope to
keep this feeling alive as we have
very good prospects ahead for water
polo at Stanford."
