Two undefeated teams, the seniors Aid
sophomores, will hook up in the fourth
tilt of the interclass basketball schedule
in the Pavilion tomorrow night.
With the season half over, these two
quintets have maintained their 1.000 per
centage by winning one game apiece.
The schedule calls for each club to play
three games, so the .seniors and sophs
have two tilts on the book.
The sophs meet the juniors Wednes
day night, and the schedule will end
Thursday evening with the senior-frosh
clash.
Tomorrow night's game should go a
long way toward deciding the cham
pionship. A victory for the '25 men
would virtually assure them of the title,
as they should have little difficulty in de
feating the juniors on the following
night. If the seniors win, they still must
down the frosh to clinch the title, and
this is a big undertaking. Ernie Nevers'
boys completely swamped the juniors last
Thursday evening, playing the best

basketball yet seen on the interclass
court. The senior-junior tilt was nip
and tuck, with the result always in
doubt. In spite of their early defeat
at the hands of the sophs, the Babes
looked like the best team in the race last
Thursday night, and if they play that
well against Pollard's men they will be
mighty dangeroys.
A freshman victory over the seniors,
following a senior defeat of the sophs,
would give the seniors and freshmen a
tie for the title, each with two wins and
one defeat. Either a play-off game would
be held, or the frosh would gain the
coveted honors by virtue of their victory
j over the Sombreros.
In the second division, the seniors and
Dinks remain undefeated and the upper
division men are favored to win their
way through to the title. The juniors
have lost two games in both divisions
and are permanently out of the running.
An analysis of the play to date, has
' been made which places Ernie Nevers,
coach and star forward of the freshmen,
at the top of the individual performers.
Nevers has scored eight field goals and
one foul for a total of 17 points. His
i floor work has also marked him as the
most valuable man on any of the teams.
Carter, freshman forward and Timmons
of the juniors are tied for second hon
ors, each with 13 points. All of these
j men made their total in two games, al
though Nevers scored 15 of his in the
second contest.
