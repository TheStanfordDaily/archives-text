# STANFORD IS ASKED TO RETURN TO CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Stanford's position in the Pacific
Coast Conference today is exactly the
same as it was before the conference
undertook to "reprimand" her for
scheduling the Pittsburgh game.
The delegates at the conference
meeting in Seattle last week requested
Professor J. P. Mitchell and Graduate
Manager Fletcher, Stanford represent
atives to the meeting, to reconsider
the resignation; the two thereupon
withdrew the resignation, acting for
the Board of Athletic Control. This
withdrawal was accepted.
From press dispatches, the position
of Stanford in the conference is even
stronger than it was before the post
season game flurry. At the Seattle
meeting the right of conference mem
bers to schedule outside games was
defined, apparently giving each college
a free hand to manage its own affairs
in regard to outside games.
Stanford's representatives then en
tered schedule arrangements and se
cured a more favorable line-up of con
ference games that was given this sea
son. Instead of meeting a strong con
tender like the University of Wash
ington the week before the Big Game,
the Stanford eleven will play the com
parativly weak Idaho squad at Palo
Alto. The only long jump will be to
Portland to meet the University of
Oregon November 10. The schedule
follows:
October 27 —University of Southern
California at Palo Alto.
November 10 —University of Oregon
at Portland.
November 17 —University of Idaho
at Palo Alto.
November 24 —University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley.
Professor Mitchell and Graduate
Manager Fletcher will return to Palo
Alto tomorrow.
