# THEATRE WORK SHOP CLASS WILL GIVE FIVE PERFORMANCES
## 
### 
Free dramatic entertainment will be
furnished to the campus by the Theater
Workshop class Friday evening. The
class will present two one-act plays and
two scencs from Shakespeare.
The first selection is "The Queen's
Enemies," by Lord Dunsany, the Eng
lish playwright. It is a fantastic play.
The queen, played by Edythe
'24, is greatly pained by the fact that she
has so many enemies. She invites them
to banquet with her in a subterranean
vault, and when the lords are all carous
ing she slips out, closes the door and
the waters of the Nile rush in upon
them. The Queen is then satisfied, for
she no longer has enemies.
In contrast to this is the second pro
duction, "Minnikin and Mannikin," a
poetic interlude by Alfred Kreymborg.
Two Dresden china dolls are found
seated on the mantelpiece when the cur
tain opens. For about fifteen minutes
they sit perfectly still and* engage in
poetic conversation until the curtain
closes again. Minnikin is played by Ger
trude McLeod, '25.and Wanda Leach,
23, takes the part of Mannikin.
The Shakespeare production consists
of two scencs from Henry IV, with Fal
staff and Prince Hal in the leading roles.
In this selection the class will try to
reproduce as far as possible the stage
and settings of the Elizabethan age.
