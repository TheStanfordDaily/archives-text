# DIFFICULT PLAY STAGED BY 1925 SATURDAY NIGHT
## Harold Minsky, Evelyn Van Horn Give Good Performances In Three Live Ghosts 
### Carl Shoup,'24 
"Three Live Ghosts" proved the
hardest play of the quarter to put
over; but the majority of the sopho
more east rose to the occasion and did
as well as could be expected with the
material at hand.
"Nothing much" about sums up the
substance of the play itself; and in ad
dition, the actors were confronted with
the task of carrying on the cockney
dialect throughout, and subduing their
natural characteristics in order to con
form to the conditions instead of being
allowed to expand in parts which, in
another play, might have been more
natural to them.
Play Is Difficult
The show was the kind which only
a thoroughly experienced group of
actors could put over at its best; and
it is doubtful if its value even so
would warrant an appearance on the
campus stage. This criticism is not
aimed directly at the committee that
chose the play; for it is a difficult
task: to select a manuscript that will
suit both actor and audience.
Nevertheless, it can well be hoped
that the remaining quarters of the
year will see staged some perform
ance with more substance and fewer
difficulties to overcome.
Standing out above the rest of the
cast Irere Evelyn Van Horn and Har
old Minsky, playing respectively the
parts of Mrs. Gubbins and Jimmie Gub
bins. Evelyn Van Horn had the hardest
task of the lot, in assuming the pose
of an old woman habituated to liquor
and a craving for cash. The way she
stuck closely to the characteristics of
"Old Sweetheart," from the halting
hobble to the ever-present shrewdness
and watchfulness gives promise for
more good acting from her in future
plays to come.
Minsky Shows Promise
Harold Minsky had about as hard a
role to carry, and he was an easy tie
for first honors. Expressiveness in his
action, voice and gestures kept the
audience well interested in what he
was doing. He put himself right into
his part better than did any other
member of the cast. What he will be
able to do in t||e future with more
serious roles is an interesting matter
of conjecture. If he can do as well
with them as he did Saturday night
with nothing much to go on, the cam
pus may miss Les Seib less than any
one has figured on; though Mnisky has
a hard pull to make before he can
carry on the work where Seib left off.
Dorothy Dahler, as Peggy Woofers,
carried parts of her role in a way that
got over quite well with the audience.
The "Yes, sir" scene with the detective
was excellent except for a slight self
consciousness. Carl Anderson assumed
all the sadness and heartlessness ne
cessary to indicate how morose an
American youth can be over the theft
of a few thousands in bonds. A1 Rog
ers chewed on his cigar in approved
detective agency style.
"Spoofy" Picks Up Loose Ends
Phil Urner had a mean job in por
traying a shell-shocked kleptomaniac
with a kind heart and a shrill laugh,
but he kept to it well and showed ap
preciation of the value of actions with
out words as he walked around the
room picking up whatever was loose.
Carol Klink did her best to add to the
part of Rose Gordon, but it was a role
that demanded an experienced actress
to lift it out of the commonplace. For
esta Hodgson, entering only for a few
minutes in the last act, gave in that
short space of time one of the most
natural performances of the evening
in the portrayal of Lady Leicester.
The police force of London was
quite a study in types. Talbot Biele
feldt made Inspector Briggs appear a
great deal like Sherlock Holmes al
ways used to assume Scotland Yard
sleuths were like. As for the two po
licemen, Everett Smith and Harry No
land, those who have been to London
can best judge for themselves how
life-like their performances were.
The setting was simple enough, but
the technical staff —Clyde Coakley,
William Lucas, Stoddard Atwood,
Chysella Dunker, and John Richer,
business manager—carried off their
part of the program with the usual
lack of hitches. The University Thea
ter Orchestra, under the direction of
C. W. Midgley, furnished the music
for between acts.
Throughout it all the influence of
Richard Bentinck was evident in the
good showing the whole cast made
against what might be termed "heavy
odds."

bins. Evelyn Van Horn had the hardest
task of the lot, in assuming the pose
of an old woman habituated to liquor
and a craving for cash. The way she
stuck closely to the characteristics of
"Old Sweetheart," from the halting
hobble to the ever-present shrewdness
and watchfulness gives promise for
more good acting from her in future
plays to come.
Minsky Shows Promise
Harold Minsky had about as hard a
role to carry, and he was an easy tie
for first honors. Expressiveness in his
action, voice and gestures kept the
audience well interested in what he
was doing. He put himself right into
his part better than did any other
member of the cast. What he will be
able to do in t||e future with more
serious roles is an interesting matter
of conjecture. If he can do as well
with them as he did Saturday night
with nothing much to go on, the cam
pus may miss Les Seib less than any
one has figured on; though Mnisky has
a hard pull to make before he can
carry on the work where Seib left off.
Dorothy Dahler, as Peggy Woofers,
carried parts of her role in a way that
got over quite well with the audience.
The "Yes, sir" scene with the detective
was excellent except for a slight self
consciousness. Carl Anderson assumed
all the sadness and heartlessness ne
cessary to indicate how morose an
American youth can be over the theft
of a few thousands in bonds. A1 Rog
ers chewed on his cigar in approved
detective agency style.
"Spoofy" Picks Up Loose Ends
Phil Urner had a mean job in por
traying a shell-shocked kleptomaniac
with a kind heart and a shrill laugh,
but he kept to it well and showed ap
preciation of the value of actions with
out words as he walked around the
room picking up whatever was loose.
Carol Klink did her best to add to the
part of Rose Gordon, but it was a role
that demanded an experienced actress
to lift it out of the commonplace. For
esta Hodgson, entering only for a few
minutes in the last act, gave in that
short space of time one of the most
natural performances of the evening
in the portrayal of Lady Leicester.
The police force of London was
quite a study in types. Talbot Biele
feldt made Inspector Briggs appear a
great deal like Sherlock Holmes al
ways used to assume Scotland Yard
sleuths were like. As for the two po
licemen, Everett Smith and Harry No
land, those who have been to London
can best judge for themselves how
life-like their performances were.
The setting was simple enough, but
the technical staff —Clyde Coakley,
William Lucas, Stoddard Atwood,
Chysella Dunker, and John Richer,
business manager—carried off their
part of the program with the usual
lack of hitches. The University Thea
ter Orchestra, under the direction of
C. W. Midgley, furnished the music
for between acts.
Throughout it all the influence of
Richard Bentinck was evident in the
good showing the whole cast made
against what might be termed "heavy
odds."
"Three Live Ghosts" proved the
hardest play of the quarter to put
over; but the majority of the sopho
more east rose to the occasion and did
as well as could be expected with the
material at hand.
"Nothing much" about sums up the
substance of the play itself; and in ad
dition, the actors were confronted with
the task of carrying on the cockney
dialect throughout, and subduing their
natural characteristics in order to con
form to the conditions instead of being
allowed to expand in parts which, in
another play, might have been more
natural to them.
Play Is Difficult
The show was the kind which only
a thoroughly experienced group of
actors could put over at its best; and
it is doubtful if its value even so
would warrant an appearance on the
campus stage. This criticism is not
aimed directly at the committee that
chose the play; for it is a difficult
task: to select a manuscript that will
suit both actor and audience.
Nevertheless, it can well be hoped
that the remaining quarters of the
year will see staged some perform
ance with more substance and fewer
difficulties to overcome.
