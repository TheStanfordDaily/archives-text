# A SUPPLEMENTARY INTELLIGENCE TEST
## 
### 
Freshmen entering Stanford are subjected to an
intelligence test, which, although it has no effect
on their entrance, is used when need arises in later
months or years. The results of the tests are not
made public nor are the students themselves in
formed as to their rating.
Here is one place where student government has
a chance for a little expansion. Here is one place
where students in control have an opportunity to
get at the root of numbers of Men's Council cases.
Here is a chance for a little missionary work.
Why not, in addition to giving the ordinary pre
scribed academic intelligence test, give an examina
tion soon after the first of each quarter on student
activities and University problems ? There are hun
dreds of little things that eyery student should
know, but it is not until he becomes a senior that
the ordinary man or woman learns much about the
place in which he has lived for more than three
years.
Students should have a background of University
history. They should know something more than is
told them in catalogues and in assemblies. Such
information, unless especially noticed, is soon for
gotten, anyway. A definite effort should be made to
acquire such knowledge, thus insuring a better atti
tude on the part of students through a more thor
ough understanding.
I low many underclassmen know how many mem
bers there are on the Student Executive Committee?
Who elects them? From what classes are they
chosen ? What are their duties ? Who is on the
committee now? Something of the same questions
might well be asked with regard to the Board of
Athletic Control, the Men's and Women's Councils,
and the Women's Athletic Association.
What has been the history of Stanford traditions?
Which of the old traditions are left? Which class
js responsible for the preservation of tradition?
Who is responsible for student government, and how
does it work? What do you know of the honor
.â€¢system and its enforcement?
How was the Stadium made possible? The Pa
vilion? What are the Graduate Manager's duties?
The Director's of Physical Education? The Student
Adviser's, if there is one?
Who is responsible for the putyicatton of the
Daily Palo Alto, the Chaparral, the Pictorial, the
Illustrated Review, the Cardinal, and the Quad?
Who are the editors and who elects them? Who are
"the student body officers and how long do they
serve ?
It is not so essential that the names of athletes
and details of athletics be asked of students, new or
old. These facts are soon found out. But as to
other matters of importance to undergraduates, not
one in ten is anything like well versed. The average
student is as ignorant of the plans and the policies
of endowment and expansion and of the ideals in
general of Stanford as the ordinary outsider. There
is no justification for this siftiation. Had those who
have committed many indiscretions in the past been
better informed in tradition in University history,
and in student affairs, there would have been fewer
troubles. Many mistakes have been made as the
result of shallow knowledge and thoughtlessness,
rather than intentional maiice.
If older students are equal to the task of causing
new people to acquire this knowledge in the form of
an intelligence test, adding to it certain penalties,
such as result from failures to take "bonchead" Eng
lish, immediate steps should be taken to perfect such
a plan. Since the University is supposed to give
lessons in practical citizenship, it is alxmt time for
students to become acquainted with the laboratory
materials.
