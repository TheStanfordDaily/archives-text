# THE
						CONFERENCE MAKES UP
## 
### 
Stanford students and the public are glad to see
tlurt the Coast Conference situation has been cleared
up at last. This amicable settlement of differences

without unfavorable publicity at the end speaks well
for the future good relations between members of
the organization.
The Conference's move to limit post-season games
to the minimum will no doubt work to the advantage
of Coast colleges in the long run. Few football
teams are able year after year to do justice to their
game or to their studies when the schedule carries
them well into Christmas vacation. An occasional
post-season contest is good for the sport and is good
publicity for the universities concerned if both are
strong representative institutions. But on either a
strictly commercial or championship basis post
season games of any frequency are decidedly in
jurious to the sport. It was to a post-season con
test with Pittsburgh that the Conference owes its
one-time quarrel with Stanford. The new policy
will undoubtedly do away with the troubles in the
future.
