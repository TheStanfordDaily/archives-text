A PLAY IN A NUMBER OF ACTS
First Act —Raising the curtain.
The interior of a Mexican jail, done artistcally in
early Mosaic, after the quaint fashion of the Mexicans.
The walls are of adobe, brick ingeniously held together
by plaster. The Mexicans are so clever that way. To
the right is a door of a type common to Mexican jails—
composed of vertical ferrous members secured at either
extremity by horizontal members of the same material.
Over the door is an ancient inscription—"Como esta
este" the translation of which is, "Please do not shake
the bars." There is a typical Mexican blizzard going on
outside, and the wind howls in through the interstices
between the vertical ferrous members.
Our hero is seated dejectedly on a keg which he
has just discovered is empty. He is plucking the spines
from a small cactus, murmuring gently, "Muy Bien,
Suhuara." ("She loves me, she loves me not").
Enter the Alcalde (jailor).
Alcalde: Escondido Pinon. (What time is it.)
Hero: Mojave chaparral. (You make me sick.)
Alcalde: Dinero y casita. (Pleasant day, isn't it?)
Hero: Manana. (No.)
Now follows the climax. The wind whistles through
the bars even more fiercely, the chill August blast forc
ing quivering heat-waves and snow through the jail.
Alcalde: Dio diptongo dirreccion directamente directo
dirigir discipulo dislabico dispuesto distinguido distin
guir distinto divertirse dividir doce docena dolar dom
nar domingo don donde dona dormir dos doscientos
dramatico dramaturgo. (Translated, "What?")
Hero: Chico. ("You either come back here damn quick
with some chow or I'll get tired of staying in your
blankety-blanked jail aiid take it home with me. Get
that, you sun-burned turnip?")
Climax: The roofs falls in.
Curtain.

CONCERNING THE WEATHER
The weather right at present (presuming the usual
Monday rain) is subject to two classifications, depending
on whether the classifier is a Native Son or some Other
Son. To the Native Son, it is Unusual Weather. To any
Other Son it is Miserable Weather. Last April we had
two days of Usual Weather and all the stores closed to
celebrate. This year it looks as though we were going
to have Unusual Weather all winter. If there are any
members of the Frosh Class who are as yet not on the
boat, we might say that this winter itself, let alone the
weather, is an Unusual Winter. There hasn't been so
much rain since 1899. Last year we had Gentle Showers
which Sprinkled the Northland, drowning a large por
tion of the inhabitants. It's a good thing the Quad can't
float away.
But cheer up! This would be a clear day in Oregon.

The non-soluble soap cake is awarded, with due pomp,
to the guy that things that lisle silk is made by lisle
worms.

Furthermore, Heloise, we wish you to understand that
that isn't mercerized cotton growing in those fields.

Last year, apparently, the co-eds all smoked and drank
and shot craps, bless their little hearts. This year they
sit around on pedestals and take their pick of the cars.
That's better. Next year if we can just get them to
knitting they will be just fine. Last year they got a
headline in the city papers. This year they had an
editorial. Maybe next year the 500 will bust in on the
sporting section.
