To the Editor:
I read with interest the comment of
Mr. Kemnitzer upon the current dis
cussion of the Stanford women, and I
am glad he put the matter in the way he
did.
By investigation, he could find that
the author of the Pictorial article is as
able to vote as he. That is, however,
immaterial to the question at issue. He
makes one fundamental assumption which
is erroneous. The sentiments of the
article are not to be taken as the judg
ments of the writer, but rather as a
compilation of opinions popularly held
among the men as a whole, to be proven
or disproven by testimonies such as Mr.
Kemnitzer's.
Stanford women have for a long
period of time been subject to criticism.
The purpose of the article in the Decem
ber Pictorial was to bring this matter
to an issue and through the resultant
criticism and comment to attempt to set
tle this matter once and for all.
If these commonly-held ideas of the
Stanford women are unfounded, now is
the time to knock the fallacies on the
head as bury them forever. If there
is any degree of truth in these ideas, it
is hoped that the women will recognize
it and take it for its worth.
Criticism and discussion such as Mr.
Kemnitzer's are indispensable in bring
ing the real light to bear upon the ques
tion, and it is hoped that such serious
consideration will continue. Sincerely,
LEON DAVID.
