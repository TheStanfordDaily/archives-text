# POWYS WILL TALK ON PSYCHOANALYSIS
## 
### 
"Psychoanalysis" — that much-dis
cussed subject throughout the world
of thought—will be presented by John
Cowper Powys, who is considered one
of the foremost authorities on the sub
ject, in a lecture this evening at 8
o'clock in the Little Theater.
The noted British philosopher-poet
was well received by his Stanford audi
ence when he discussed the life and
personality of Lloyd George several
weeks ago.
The topic for his return lecture is
based on the Freudian theory that
hysteria is due to suppressed desires,
consciously rejected but subconscious
ly persistent.
"As science freed man from super
stitious fear, so will psychoanalysis
lift the incubus of conventional sex
morality and banish its centuries-old
tabu," says Mr. Powys.
Powys at First Against Theory
Although the lecturer was for many
years prejudiced against this theory,
he became its ardent advocate after
studying the subject. Mr. Powys be
lieves that there is a real need in the
world for an appreciation of this little
understood subject of morals in their
true relation to human life, and he
has just completed a book on "Psycho
analysis and Morality," which is soon
to be released.
Redfern Mason, in the San Fran
cisco Examiner, says: "If you are a
musician or a music lover, go and
listen to Cowper Powys. He may not
talk about music; his fantasy ranges
over the whole realm of things know
able and far beyond into the heaven
of things only to be divined; but,
wherever his mind wanders, music is
not far from his thoughts. Take the
advice of one who believes, and hear
Powys, no matter what the subject
may be."
Tickets for the lecture are on sale
at Crandall's book store.
