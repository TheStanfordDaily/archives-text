# "ENTER MADAME" IS THEATER GUILD PLAY OFFERED NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
"Enter Madame," Gilda Varesi's por
trait of a prima donna, which has been
one of the most popular successes of the
San Francisco Stage Guild's season, will
be produced by the Guild at the Stanford
Assembly hall next Monday night, under
the auspices of the Palo Alto Com
munity Players.
The San Francisco Stage Guild has
won the unqualified admiration of the
critics and public in its first season at the
Plaza Theater, in which it has produced
six noteworthy plays.
Medea Radzina, the Russian actress,
who has made a remarkable success in
the role of the temperamental prima
donna, Delia Robbia, will have the lead
ing part in the Stanford production. The
campus play has the same cast as'in San
Francisco.
Mme. Radzina was trained in the Mos
cow School of the Theater and she
toured Russia with Stanislavsky, the
great founder of the Moscow Art The
ater.
The supporting cast includes stars of
other performances: Same Hume, Mil
dred Martin, Dan Totheroh, Irving
Pichel, Mary Morris, Lloyd Corrigan,
Virginia Sciaroni, Irene McSwain, and
Kiichi Nishino.
The play is "A Comedy of Artistic
Temperament," and it tells the story of
the revolt of Madame's American hus
band, weary of being merely one of his
famous wife's accessories. He seeks
solace in the quieter charms of Flora
Preston, but it can hardly be said that
he finds it. The narrow-minded widow
is not a match for the glorious singer.
Seats will be sold at 75 cents and $1,
the second price being for the first six
teen rows downstairs and the first five
rows in the balcony. Reservations may
be made through Mrs. J. W. Bingham,
653 Melville avenue, Palo Alto.
