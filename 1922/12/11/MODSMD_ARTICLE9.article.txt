# FRESHMAN SWIMMERS GAIN DOUBLE VICTORY
## 
### 
Freshmen swimmers' team easily de
feated the Lowell High School team, 51
to 20, in Encina pool Saturday morning.
Not being content with their morning
victory, Coach Brandsten's first-year men
took the measure of the Lowell High
water polo seven by a 2 to 1 score in
the afternoon as a preliminary to the
junior national championship contest.
The Cardinal Babes captured first and
second places in the 100-yard free style
event, the diving and the plunge for dis
tance.
Diving Event Close
The diving event was very close when
the final count was made. King of the
Babes pulled a surprise by nosing out
his teammate, Smith, with a very small
margin for first honors. Coach Brand
sten has two very promising performers
in King and Smith. With additional
experience and training they should be
able to hold their own with nearly any
young divers of the Coast.
Langley was the high point man of the
meet, capturing first place in the 220-
yard free style and in the plunge, and
third place in the 50-yard backstroke
event His time in the 220-yard free
style race was very good for early sea
son work.
Hanley of Lowell swam a fast race in
the 100-yard breaststroke competition.
Hablutzel of the Babes also showed good
form in this race.
Relay Team Nears Record
The freshman relay team, composed
of Mack, Ackerman, King, and Carl
smith, made event in one minute and
ten seconds, which is only one second]
slower than the Stanford-California
freshman record.
The Cardinal water polo team showed
better team work than their opponents
and possessed greater offensive ability.
The contest was hard fought through
out. The Babes are developing quite
rapidly into a clever team, especially
when it is considered that only a few of
the squad had any experience in water
polo previous to entering college.
