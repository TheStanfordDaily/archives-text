# INTERIM QUINTETS MIX IN CRUCIAL TILT
## 
### Maxwell Stiles, '25 
With but three games still to be played,
the seniors and sophomores will meet in
the crucial contest of the intcrclass
basketball schedule in the Pavilion to
night. The tinal outcome of the first
division may hinge on the result of to
night's clash, and for this reason C. W.
Davis, director of inramural athletics,
is expecting not only the best game of
the series to date, but also the biggest
crowd.
A victory for the sophomore swill vir
tually assure them of the title. Vic
torious over the freshmen last week, the
'25 men would have only to face tlie
juniors to finish the schedule undefeated.
The junior five has been the weakest to
date, and if the sophs are able to step
on the Sombreros they should have little
difficulty with their tinal opponents.
A senioj#win tonight would throw the
spotlight on Thursday's tilt between the
seniors and frosh. The '23 quintet has
won one game and lost none. A victory
tonight would give them a two and noth
ing score. The frosh have won and lost
a game. Should the frosh turn around
and defeat the seniors on Thursday,
the two squads would be tied for the
championship, cach with two games won
and one lost. Davis announced today
that in this event, a play-off game would
be held to determine the title holder.
Comparative scores to date would give
the sophs an edge on tonight's scramble.
The seniors had trouble in downing the
juniors, while the frosh mopped up the
floor with the '24 class team. The sophs
downed the frosh.
In the second division, the frosh have
won two games and have not yet suffered
defeat. The seniors have copped their
only tilt. A senior victory in this di
vision tonight would bring them even
with the Dinks, and then a lively scram
ble would be the result in the prelimi
nary game Thursday evening.
