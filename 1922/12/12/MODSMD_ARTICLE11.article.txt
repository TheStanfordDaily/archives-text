# STANFORD GIVES UP GAME IN SOUTH TO CALIFORNIANS
## Sacrifice of Card Delegates at Conference in Seattle Has Made Schedule Possible 
### 
That Stanford's salrifice, made to
break a deadlock and to keep all Cali
fornia members in the Pacific Coast Con
â€¢ ference, was the scheduling of the Uni
versity of Southern California game in
Palo Alto rather than in Los Angeles,
; was the salient point of interest in the
: report issued today by Professor J. P.
Mitchell, who, with Graduate Manager
William F. Fletcher, represented Stan
ford at the meeting of the Conference
held last Friday and Saturday in Seattle.
Delegates Deadlock
"We were all in an apparently hope
less deadlock," said Professor Mitchell.
"Every member of the Conference had
agreed to play a particular rival on a
particular date.
"We worked from 9 o'clock Friday
morning until midnight, submitting, con
sidering and rejecting many proposed
schedules.
"After a night's sleep the northern
colleges decided that they would come
around to California's ultimatum that
they must either concede a few points
or face the proposition of scheduling
games with local colleges when they
could and at the pleasure of the Cali
fornia colleges. The Northwest offered
to meet us half-way. That seemed fair
enough, but th ematter was still such
enough, but the matter was still such
University of Oregon in Portland. We
were especially anxious to meet U. S. C.
in L#s Angeles because of the big gate
a dedication of the new Los Angeles
stadium would draw.
Stanford Gives Up Southern Game
"But we could not schedule two games
away from home. California wanted to
play the Trojans in Los Angeles next
year, in order that the year following
they could meet the southerners in the
new Berkeley stadium. We therefore
sacrificed ourselves to the cause and
agreed to play U. S. C. here and Oregon
in Portland."
Professor Mitchell said that there was
nothing but good will among the various
members of the Conference. Stanford
did not voluntarily withdraw the resig
nation, but did so at the request of Con
ference members. "They asked us if
we were satisfied with the schedule and
the new rules regarding post-season
games.
"As a matter of fact, everyone was
equally dissatisfied with the schedule,
but we had no objections to anything that
had been done, so we told them that we
were satisfied.
"They then asked us to withdraw our
resignation, which I then did. They ac
cepted our withdrawal of the resigna
tion."
Professor Mitchell said that the new
attitude assumed on post-season games
virtually sounds the death knell of the
annual New Year's Day game at Pasa
dena. The Rose Bowl might as well be
placed on the market for sale. The
regular Conference season ends the sec
ond Saturday after Thanksgiving, and
all games scheduled after this date will
be considered a post-season game, pro
viding that all negotiations are made by
