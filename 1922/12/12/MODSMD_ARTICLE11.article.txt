# STANFORD GIVES UP GAME IN SOUTH TO CALIFORNIANS
## Sacrifice of Card Delegates at Conference in Seattle Has Made Schedule Possible 
### 
That Stanford's salrifice, made to
break a deadlock and to keep all Cali
fornia members in the Pacific Coast Con
• ference, was the scheduling of the Uni
versity of Southern California game in
Palo Alto rather than in Los Angeles,
; was the salient point of interest in the
: report issued today by Professor J. P.
Mitchell, who, with Graduate Manager
William F. Fletcher, represented Stan
ford at the meeting of the Conference
held last Friday and Saturday in Seattle.
Delegates Deadlock
"We were all in an apparently hope
less deadlock," said Professor Mitchell.
"Every member of the Conference had
agreed to play a particular rival on a
particular date.
"We worked from 9 o'clock Friday
morning until midnight, submitting, con
sidering and rejecting many proposed
schedules.
"After a night's sleep the northern
colleges decided that they would come
around to California's ultimatum that
they must either concede a few points
or face the proposition of scheduling
games with local colleges when they
could and at the pleasure of the Cali
fornia colleges. The Northwest offered
to meet us half-way. That seemed fair
enough, but th ematter was still such
enough, but the matter was still such
University of Oregon in Portland. We
were especially anxious to meet U. S. C.
in L#s Angeles because of the big gate
a dedication of the new Los Angeles
stadium would draw.
Stanford Gives Up Southern Game
"But we could not schedule two games
away from home. California wanted to
play the Trojans in Los Angeles next
year, in order that the year following
they could meet the southerners in the
new Berkeley stadium. We therefore
sacrificed ourselves to the cause and
agreed to play U. S. C. here and Oregon
in Portland."
Professor Mitchell said that there was
nothing but good will among the various
members of the Conference. Stanford
did not voluntarily withdraw the resig
nation, but did so at the request of Con
ference members. "They asked us if
we were satisfied with the schedule and
the new rules regarding post-season
games.
"As a matter of fact, everyone was
equally dissatisfied with the schedule,
but we had no objections to anything that
had been done, so we told them that we
were satisfied.
"They then asked us to withdraw our
resignation, which I then did. They ac
cepted our withdrawal of the resigna
tion."
Professor Mitchell said that the new
attitude assumed on post-season games
virtually sounds the death knell of the
annual New Year's Day game at Pasa
dena. The Rose Bowl might as well be
placed on the market for sale. The
regular Conference season ends the sec
ond Saturday after Thanksgiving, and
all games scheduled after this date will
be considered a post-season game, pro
viding that all negotiations are made by
the two universities concerned exclusive
of outside business interests.
"The Tournament of Roses may offer
to rent their stadium for a game," said
Professor Mitchell, "and any Conference
member may accept. But with the rental,
all further negotiations for the game
must he made through the rival institu
tions. Inasmuch as California, Stanford,
and U. S. C. will have large stadiums
of their own, they will play their post
season games in their own grounds
rather than rent Pasadena's stadium.
The Conference, however, will frown
upon any member \hich schedules post
season games year after year.
"U. S. C. is the goat. Inasmuch as the
new rulings do not take effect this year,
proceeds of the U. & C.-Penn State
game are to be divided up among mem
bers of the Conference. In the future
there will be no division of the proceeds,
as there has been none in the past.
There is one bright light for the Tro
jans, hqwever. Stanford, California, and
Washington have voted not to accept
any proceeds of the game. A few of the
northern schools, like Idaho, have al
ready made provision for the use of this
money and were therefore bound to ex
pect a division, although it was the spirit
of the Conference to let U. S. C. have
all the money."
Baker of U. S. C. Ineligible
Professor Mitchell explained the new
eligibility rules.* Under the late rulings,
a player is eligible to three years of
varsity football and these must come
within four academic years. Thus, a
man cannot play two football seasons,
quit the game for three seasons of track
and then return to football again four
or five years after his matriculation.
Freshmen are not to be eligible for var
sity competition until one year after
matriculation.
This means that men entering Stan
ford in January and staying in college
during the winter, spring and summer
quarters would not be eligible for var
sity competition, as were Jim Lawson.
Houck, and Johnston this year. Instead,
they would play freshman football in
the fall, although in academic standing
they would be sophomores.
The new four-year ruling hit Roy Ba
ker, halfback, who was declared ineli
gible after this season. Baker played
two years at Santa Clara, rested a year
and played a year at U. S. C. Under
the old rule he would have had one more
year, but under the new ruling he is out
for good.

Delegates Deadlock
"We were all in an apparently hope
less deadlock," said Professor Mitchell.
"Every member of the Conference had
agreed to play a particular rival on a
particular date.
"We worked from 9 o'clock Friday
morning until midnight, submitting, con
sidering and rejecting many proposed
schedules.
"After a night's sleep the northern
colleges decided that they would come
around to California's ultimatum that
they must either concede a few points
or face the proposition of scheduling
games with local colleges when they
could and at the pleasure of the Cali
fornia colleges. The Northwest offered
to meet us half-way. That seemed fair
enough, but th ematter was still such
enough, but the matter was still such
University of Oregon in Portland. We
were especially anxious to meet U. S. C.
in L#s Angeles because of the big gate
a dedication of the new Los Angeles
stadium would draw.
Stanford Gives Up Southern Game
"But we could not schedule two games
away from home. California wanted to
play the Trojans in Los Angeles next
year, in order that the year following
they could meet the southerners in the
new Berkeley stadium. We therefore
sacrificed ourselves to the cause and
agreed to play U. S. C. here and Oregon
in Portland."
Professor Mitchell said that there was
nothing but good will among the various
members of the Conference. Stanford
did not voluntarily withdraw the resig
nation, but did so at the request of Con
ference members. "They asked us if
we were satisfied with the schedule and
the new rules regarding post-season
games.
"As a matter of fact, everyone was
equally dissatisfied with the schedule,
but we had no objections to anything that
had been done, so we told them that we
were satisfied.
"They then asked us to withdraw our
resignation, which I then did. They ac
cepted our withdrawal of the resigna
tion."
Professor Mitchell said that the new
attitude assumed on post-season games
virtually sounds the death knell of the
annual New Year's Day game at Pasa
dena. The Rose Bowl might as well be
placed on the market for sale. The
regular Conference season ends the sec
ond Saturday after Thanksgiving, and
all games scheduled after this date will
be considered a post-season game, pro
viding that all negotiations are made by
the two universities concerned exclusive
of outside business interests.
"The Tournament of Roses may offer
to rent their stadium for a game," said
Professor Mitchell, "and any Conference
member may accept. But with the rental,
all further negotiations for the game
must he made through the rival institu
tions. Inasmuch as California, Stanford,
and U. S. C. will have large stadiums
of their own, they will play their post
season games in their own grounds
rather than rent Pasadena's stadium.
The Conference, however, will frown
upon any member \hich schedules post
season games year after year.
"U. S. C. is the goat. Inasmuch as the
new rulings do not take effect this year,
proceeds of the U. & C.-Penn State
game are to be divided up among mem
bers of the Conference. In the future
there will be no division of the proceeds,
as there has been none in the past.
There is one bright light for the Tro
jans, hqwever. Stanford, California, and
Washington have voted not to accept
any proceeds of the game. A few of the
northern schools, like Idaho, have al
ready made provision for the use of this
money and were therefore bound to ex
pect a division, although it was the spirit
of the Conference to let U. S. C. have
all the money."
Baker of U. S. C. Ineligible
Professor Mitchell explained the new
eligibility rules.* Under the late rulings,
a player is eligible to three years of
varsity football and these must come
within four academic years. Thus, a
man cannot play two football seasons,
quit the game for three seasons of track
and then return to football again four
or five years after his matriculation.
Freshmen are not to be eligible for var
sity competition until one year after
matriculation.
This means that men entering Stan
ford in January and staying in college
during the winter, spring and summer
quarters would not be eligible for var
sity competition, as were Jim Lawson.
Houck, and Johnston this year. Instead,
they would play freshman football in
the fall, although in academic standing
they would be sophomores.
The new four-year ruling hit Roy Ba
ker, halfback, who was declared ineli
gible after this season. Baker played
two years at Santa Clara, rested a year
and played a year at U. S. C. Under
the old rule he would have had one more
year, but under the new ruling he is out
for good.
That Stanford's salrifice, made to
break a deadlock and to keep all Cali
fornia members in the Pacific Coast Con

versity of Southern California game in
Palo Alto rather than in Los Angeles,

Stanford Gives Up Southern Game
"But we could not schedule two games
away from home. California wanted to
play the Trojans in Los Angeles next
year, in order that the year following
they could meet the southerners in the
new Berkeley stadium. We therefore
sacrificed ourselves to the cause and
agreed to play U. S. C. here and Oregon
in Portland."
Professor Mitchell said that there was
nothing but good will among the various
members of the Conference. Stanford
did not voluntarily withdraw the resig
nation, but did so at the request of Con
ference members. "They asked us if
we were satisfied with the schedule and
the new rules regarding post-season
games.
"As a matter of fact, everyone was
equally dissatisfied with the schedule,
but we had no objections to anything that
had been done, so we told them that we
were satisfied.
"They then asked us to withdraw our
resignation, which I then did. They ac
cepted our withdrawal of the resigna
tion."
Professor Mitchell said that the new
attitude assumed on post-season games
virtually sounds the death knell of the
annual New Year's Day game at Pasa
dena. The Rose Bowl might as well be
placed on the market for sale. The
regular Conference season ends the sec
ond Saturday after Thanksgiving, and
all games scheduled after this date will
be considered a post-season game, pro
viding that all negotiations are made by
the two universities concerned exclusive
of outside business interests.
"The Tournament of Roses may offer
to rent their stadium for a game," said
Professor Mitchell, "and any Conference
member may accept. But with the rental,
all further negotiations for the game
must he made through the rival institu
tions. Inasmuch as California, Stanford,
and U. S. C. will have large stadiums
of their own, they will play their post
season games in their own grounds
rather than rent Pasadena's stadium.
The Conference, however, will frown
upon any member \hich schedules post
season games year after year.
"U. S. C. is the goat. Inasmuch as the
new rulings do not take effect this year,
proceeds of the U. & C.-Penn State
game are to be divided up among mem
bers of the Conference. In the future
there will be no division of the proceeds,
as there has been none in the past.
There is one bright light for the Tro
jans, hqwever. Stanford, California, and
Washington have voted not to accept
any proceeds of the game. A few of the
northern schools, like Idaho, have al
ready made provision for the use of this
money and were therefore bound to ex
pect a division, although it was the spirit
of the Conference to let U. S. C. have
all the money."
Baker of U. S. C. Ineligible
Professor Mitchell explained the new
eligibility rules.* Under the late rulings,
a player is eligible to three years of
varsity football and these must come
within four academic years. Thus, a
man cannot play two football seasons,
quit the game for three seasons of track
and then return to football again four
or five years after his matriculation.
Freshmen are not to be eligible for var
sity competition until one year after
matriculation.
This means that men entering Stan
ford in January and staying in college
during the winter, spring and summer
quarters would not be eligible for var
sity competition, as were Jim Lawson.
Houck, and Johnston this year. Instead,
they would play freshman football in
the fall, although in academic standing
they would be sophomores.
The new four-year ruling hit Roy Ba
ker, halfback, who was declared ineli
gible after this season. Baker played
two years at Santa Clara, rested a year
and played a year at U. S. C. Under
the old rule he would have had one more
year, but under the new ruling he is out
for good.
That Stanford's salrifice, made to
break a deadlock and to keep all Cali
fornia members in the Pacific Coast Con
• ference, was the scheduling of the Uni
versity of Southern California game in
Palo Alto rather than in Los Angeles,
; was the salient point of interest in the
: report issued today by Professor J. P.
Mitchell, who, with Graduate Manager
William F. Fletcher, represented Stan
ford at the meeting of the Conference
held last Friday and Saturday in Seattle.
Delegates Deadlock
"We were all in an apparently hope
less deadlock," said Professor Mitchell.
"Every member of the Conference had
agreed to play a particular rival on a
particular date.
"We worked from 9 o'clock Friday
morning until midnight, submitting, con
sidering and rejecting many proposed
schedules.
"After a night's sleep the northern
colleges decided that they would come
around to California's ultimatum that
they must either concede a few points
or face the proposition of scheduling
games with local colleges when they
could and at the pleasure of the Cali
fornia colleges. The Northwest offered
