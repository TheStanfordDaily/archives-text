# "THE QUEEN'S ENEMIES" HAS TRAGIC IMAGINATIVE ENDING
## 
### 
"Something different in the line of
campus dramatics" was Director Bent
inck's idea in selecting the one-act
plays to be given by the Theater
Workshop class Friday evening in the
Assembly hall. His idea seems to have
been carried out very well, if re
hearsals of "The Queen's Enemies"
by Lord Dunsany mean anything.
The setting is laid in some mystic
land on the banks of the Nile where
a queen has an underground temple.
Weird lighting effects give the place
an atmosphere of impending doom.
In addition, the style used by Dunsany
in the lines of the play further in
creases this, eerie feeling.
In this subterranean temple the
queen prepares a banquet for her
enemies. She does not want to have
enemies so she invites them to dine
with her and become her friends. They
enter the dismal palace reluctantly and
are afraid of everything they see or
hear. However the queen allays their
fears and soon they are all drinking
and making merry. «
When the warriors are all absorbed

in their revels the queen quietly
leaves the room and locks the door.
Her enemies jump up with drawn
swords when they see they are alone,
and prepare to defend themselves. The
only means of access is a dark grated
hole in the rear, so they feel quite
capable of disposing of any who enter
that way.
Meanwhile the queen is outside pray
ing to holy Nile to take away her
enemies, the thought of whom pre
vents her from sleeping. Then she
gives a signal and the waters of the
Nile rush into the terrible banquet
chamber and drown her warrior
guests. The queen sleeps well that
night knowing that she no longerrtias
enemies.
The other two selections to be pre
sented by the Theater Workshop are
"Minnikin and Mannikin," by Alfred
Kreymborg, and two scenes from
"Henry IV" by Shakespeare. No ad
mission price will be charged for these
productions which are scheduled to
start at S: 15.
