# FRATERNITIES DISCUSS ROW-HALL AGREEMENT
## W.F. Leiser, '21, Gives Views Of Hall On Question At Conference Meet 
### 
A Row-Hall agreement in regard to
rushing freshmen to alleviate possible
hard feeling was discussed at the
meeting of the interfraternity confer
ence last night. W. F. Leiser, '21, pre
sented the hall's ideas on the subject
for the approval of the fraternities.
Leiser gave three suggestions which
the halls believed should be included
in such a compact. He said that fresh
men should not be interviewed in the
hall after 8 o'clock at night; that no
more than two fraternity men be al
lowed to talk to a freshman at a time;
and that the dormitory room be re
garded as the hall man's home and
should not be violated for purposes
other than making dates with the
freshmen.
According to Leiser the eating clubs
are ready to agree not to take men in
until after the fraternities have
pledged, %nd that they will not in the
future incorporate freshmen who are
not certain that they do not wish to
join a fraternity.
The conference voted to draw up
substantially such an agreement, to
hold for two quarters, which will be
put before the halls. A similar com
pact was in effect in 1920, but was not
renewed in 1921 or 1922.
Sam Langford, '23, was elected sec
retary of the conference.
A meeting of the conference will be
called during the first week of next
quarter.
