# Cards Practice For Game With Panthers
## Pittsburg Team To Arrive Here on Christmas Day; Warner Will Stay for Spring Practice 
### 
On a turf soaked by the rains of the last week the Stanford varsity gridmen
yesterday afternoon slipped and skidded through their first scrimmage since
the Big Game.
Andy Kerr, in a pair of galoshes, trudged up and down the field, directing
the clash between his first and second elevens. "Tiny" Thornhill, whose line
stood up so well against the Blue and Gold, looked on from the side and
watched his men perform.
Captain Dud DeGroot, the only Stanford man whom the majority of
"pickers" place on the all-Coast eleven, was not in uniform, since his knee
still needs rest. Art Wilcox, mentioned by some as halfback on the mythical
eleven, was missing and Paul Murray took his place temporarily. Other
absentees yesterday included "Scotchy" Campbell, "Shorty" Mertz, Fred
Ludeke, and Bob Janssen.

Lawson May Be Eligible
Unless there are some new injuries
between now and December 30 every
man who faced California will be able
to play against "Pop" Warner's Pan
thers. The story is now going the
rounds that Jim Lawson, who was sup
posedly out of the fray, is eligible.
Norman Cleaveland was in uniform
for the first time since the Big Game,
but he did no strenuous work. If he Is
not in good shape for the Pitt game,
Kerr will have to scurry around for
another punter who will be ready to
step in if anything happens to Wilcox.
Kerr probably won't have to look
farther than Murray Cuddeback, who
did all of the booting for the 1926
freshmen. He hasn't been doing much
in the punting line this season, but
with a few days' practice should de
velop into a consistent fifty-yard man.
Panthers Here Christmas
It is now planned to have the Pitts
burgh contingent complete its trans
continental journel on Christmas Day,
instead of on December 27. That
means Warner and his associates will
have to leave the Smoky City on De
cember 21. No important stopoVers are
scheduled en route, and the boys will
do most of their exercise on the train.
Wallace Denny, associated with
Warner in the halcyon days when
Carlisle had the most-feared eleven in
the country, discounts the idea that
Pittsburgh will suffer to any great
extent by the journey. With five days
in which to work off the effects, Pitts
burgh should have no alibis if de
feated.
Denny also thinks that the Cards
are aching to surprise the Panthers.
The Cardinal linesmen, he figures, will
hold their own with Warner's charges.
Then, if Kerr's backs get started —and
that depends on the weather condi
tions —Stanford will have a good
chance to win.
Warner to Stay on Coast
When the Panthers return home
after the contest, "Pop" Warner will
be missing. The "old master" will stay
on the Coast and when April comes
around will take charge of spring foot
ball practice at Stanford.
In addition to the players and War
ner those who will compose the ret
inue from Pittsburgh are: Floyd Rose,
assistant coach; Charles S. Miller, di
rector of athletics; Karl E. Davis,
graduate manager; Dr. "Huve" Wag
ner, physician; Ollie de Victor, train
er, and Ralph E. Davis, press repre
sentative.
