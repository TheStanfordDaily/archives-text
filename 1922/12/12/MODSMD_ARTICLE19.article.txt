# "AND THEY CALL IT DANCING"
## 
### 
The Daily has been trying to keep away from this
subject for a long - time. Inasmuch as dancing is
an activity in which the writer of these editorials
has taken no part heretofore, he has felt that the
matter should he left to future editors who know
more about the subject. But campus dancers
wouldn't have it that way. They had to extend
the rules of this particular sport to include every
thing' that even hinted of dancing. The matter can
K'o no further without receiving at least the atten
tion of passing comment.
During and just after the war, the shimmy shook
certain portions of the social atmosphere of the
campus loose from its moorings and called down the
editorial wrath of a whole country besides. The
shimmy eventually shook itself out of college into
the public dance halls and dives of larger cities.
But whatever may be said of recent "improvements"
in dance steps, they certainly will never leave college
to follow the footsteps of the shimmy. No self
respecting dive would permit them to be introduced.
•Such dances as were seen at the Cotillion last Fri
day evening would jar a North Beach copper into
-complete sobriety. Those who gave cause for com
plaint, and there certainly was cause, probably for
got themselves. It is to be hoped that the moral
caliber of average Stanford students is above that
of patrons of less respected social centers.
It is about time for the "Chicago Walk," or what
ever this new but somewhat questionable trick is
called, to walk oft" the campus before it is thrown
off with a group of protesting ''innocents.'-i—lt was
only last Saturday night that several couples from
the campus were practically told to leave the Com
munity House in Palo Alto for an exhibition that
would have been excellent material for a sculptor.
The models didn't move three feet in a ten-minute
dance. The parties who were called down declared
that they danced that way on the campus all the time
and pointed out the Cotillion as an example of their
speed.
• Why is it, many people are demanding to know,
that unkind remarks are made of women? Why is
it that "Throw 'Em Out" articles are written ? Don't
the women command any respect? The reader may
draw his own conclusions.
While the writer is not in a position to make any
assertions as a result of first-hand experience, there
has been talk—too much talk—about women at
Stanford. It all comes down to a few individuals
in the long run. And where there is such a smoke
screen there is, of course, a lot of curiosity to see
what is back of it. Charitable people like to think
that there is nothing but poor judgment back of it
all on both sides. If such is the case, the condition
is not so bad, but that it may be immediately cor
rected. If those women in the student body who
are in authority want to do a little missionary work
for their constituents, they would do well to work
on prevention and less on cure. To make somebody
the goat for a general wrong is only a temporary
measure of relief. *
Here is a place to start. Any fool, whether he
dances or not, knows that the woman regulates a
couple's style of dancing. If she likes extreme step
ping, she lets the man lead as he likes. If she does
not approve of it, she can with little trouble put a
stop to it. A word in most cases is sufficient. Fur
ther, it is no tribute to Stanford men that they will
go the limit. We might as well be frank in saying
that this degree in extreme dancing has been
reached. If it isn't the limit, then dancing in the
modern sense of the word has been misnamed. It
is "something else again."
The question is, are five hundred women to be
damned in print because of the indiscretions of a
very small minority of their number? Are Stanford
women to suffer in reputation because by the failure

of a few to exercise flcliilt judgment, certain men
take advantage of the situation and put the campus
as a whole in a bad light? Yes. Damned, to be sure,
along with the men. Why not? Anything so ob
jectionable as this which is at the same time so easily
correctcd is a fit subject for the condemnatory pen
of even an uncouth person who has not danced
recently, but is likely to do so very soon for the pur
pose of getting first-hand information.

in the long run. And where there is such a smoke
screen there is, of course, a lot of curiosity to see
what is back of it. Charitable people like to think
that there is nothing but poor judgment back of it
all on both sides. If such is the case, the condition
is not so bad, but that it may be immediately cor
rected. If those women in the student body who
are in authority want to do a little missionary work
for their constituents, they would do well to work

Here is a place to start. Any fool, whether he
dances or not, knows that the woman regulates a
couple's style of dancing. If she likes extreme step
ping, she lets the man lead as he likes. If she does
not approve of it, she can with little trouble put a
stop to it. A word in most cases is sufficient. Fur
ther, it is no tribute to Stanford men that they will
go the limit. We might as well be frank in saying
that this degree in extreme dancing has been
reached. If it isn't the limit, then dancing in the
modern sense of the word has been misnamed. It
is "something else again."
The question is, are five hundred women to be
damned in print because of the indiscretions of a
very small minority of their number? Are Stanford
women to suffer in reputation because by the failure

of a few to exercise flcliilt judgment, certain men
take advantage of the situation and put the campus
as a whole in a bad light? Yes. Damned, to be sure,
along with the men. Why not? Anything so ob
jectionable as this which is at the same time so easily
correctcd is a fit subject for the condemnatory pen
of even an uncouth person who has not danced
recently, but is likely to do so very soon for the pur
pose of getting first-hand information.
The Daily has been trying to keep away from this
subject for a long - time. Inasmuch as dancing is
an activity in which the writer of these editorials
has taken no part heretofore, he has felt that the
matter should he left to future editors who know
more about the subject. But campus dancers
wouldn't have it that way. They had to extend
the rules of this particular sport to include every
thing' that even hinted of dancing. The matter can
K'o no further without receiving at least the atten
tion of passing comment.
During and just after the war, the shimmy shook
certain portions of the social atmosphere of the

But whatever may be said of recent "improvements"
in dance steps, they certainly will never leave college
to follow the footsteps of the shimmy. No self
