## 
### (By United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 12.â€”The
British freighter Orteric seemed
doomed today to join the long list of
ships bleaching their bones in the
graveyard of the Pacific.
The four thousand ton freighter hit
Fish Rock, about 75 miles north of San
Francisco at 10 p. m. t yesterday, ac
cording to radiograms picked up by
the Radio Corporation of America
here.
The last report from her which came
early today descrfbed the ship as lying
broadside on the beach a short dis
tance from the rock, pounding heavily
under the battering of a rough sea, at
least two of her holds and probably
more filled with water and her plight
serious.
The revenue cutter Shawnee was
ordered out from San Francisco and
the tanker El Segundo was standing
by but chief hope for saving Captain
Harper and the crew of approximately
25 was placed in the coast guard sta
tion at Point Arena, some 20 miles
away.
