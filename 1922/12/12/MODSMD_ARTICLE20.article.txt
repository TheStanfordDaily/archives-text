ACCORDING TO WALT MASON
If you have to study all the night in order to prepare
To do your final exes, that's no reason to despair.
If your room is cold and noisy, yet it's not too cold,
you know,
For a little seed ff genius in that study room to grow.
'* * .
If some skunk has stole your notebook, and your only
fountain pen,
Don't give up the daily lessons, he may bring them
back again.
If you've flunked the midquarter, and the prof is
getting mean,
Be kind and patient to him, treat him nice and treat him
keen.
If the whole darn world's against you, and you haven't
got a friend,
If you think the deal's been rotten, see the thing out to
an end.
Just remember when all's over, you've one pleasure yet,
for fair:
And that's kill these "cheer up" poets who make life so
hard to bear!

Two Turkish soldiers were fighting recently in the
battle of prsutywl over the ownership of a black slave.
An American, seeing the slave standing there watching
with interest the progress of the fight, asked him why
he didn't either join in or run away.
"Did you ever see two dogs fighting over a bone?"
asked the slave. The American admitted that he -had.
"Well, did you ever see the bone fight?—l'm the bone."
