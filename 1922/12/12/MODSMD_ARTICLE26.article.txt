To the Editor:
The so-called "unusual" weather re
ferred to in yesterday's D. P. A. has
brought home the fact that some kind of
sidewalk should exist between the Union
and Encina other than the one now ex
isting, which is paved in an artistic man
ner with mud and mud only. Even one
of Pop Harris' shoe shines fails to sur
vive a journey through this oozy mass,
for on emerging one would judge that
the traveler had reurned to his child
hood days and gone in but
failed to exercise prudence and remove
his shoes. And since going barefoot is
tabooed on the campus, wouldn't it be
a good idea to construct at least a gravel
sidewalk? One seems to have existed
there once upon a. time, but it seems to
have sunk down to the Paleozoic strata
and remains only a memory.
Perhaps when the rainy season is here
in full force, however, the more prac
tical thing would be to construct a bridge
or import a fleet of gondolas. Very sin
cerely,
