# CARD POLO TEAM WILL PLAY MONTEREY SQUAD
## 
### 
The officers of the 11th Cavalry, sta
tioned at the Presidio, Monterey, will
play the Stanford polo team on the high
way field next Saturday at 2:30 p. m.
The cavalry team is considered one of
the best in the country, and takes part
in the civilian tournaments held each
year at Del Monte and San Mateo. For
this reason it is doubtful if they
will send all their first string men to
compete against the Cardinals. They
will use the local ponies, as it was
thought impracticable to transport the
horses this far for the game.

R. O. T. C. unit has written that they
were unable to securc funds to make the
trip here during the Christmas holidays,
and so have had to call off the games.
