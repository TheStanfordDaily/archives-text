# PSYCHOANALYSIS IS DEFINED BY POWYS
## 
### 
"We must distinguish between true
authorities on psychoanalysis, such as
Freud, Adler, and Jung, and mere imi
tators who simply prejudice people
against the subject by their charlatanism.
When you separate psychology and psy
choanalysis from philosophical thought,
you throw science to the Philistines. If
you are going to be honest in approach
ing this ticklish subject, you must vivi
sect yourself."
Such was the view of John Cowper
Powys, the English lecturer, who dis
cussed the subject of "Psychoanalysis and
Morality" last evening at the Little
Theater.
No one should study psychoanalysis
without examining the relationship of
body and mind, for Watson's "Behavior
ism" runs parallel with Freudian theory,
the speaker believes. He explained that
with Freud the "libido" is the primitive
sex impulse which is censored, drops into
the subconscious mind, and expresses
itself in sleep. With Jung, the libido be
comes the "cosmic urge."
"Adler's theory is really the most sat
isfying one," the lecturer declared, "be
cause it not only applies to unusual cases,
but to so-called normal people. There
are no normal people—we all have
manias. The inferiority complex often
leads to the overcoming of weaknesses,
and in some cases it accounts for the
subject's becoming a genius."
Mr. Powys indicated the value of an
artistic or philosophical mind in "getting
over" the psychonalytical idea. Even
the scientists themselves are forced to al
lude to figures in art and literature to
illustrate their theories—Oedipus, Elec
tra, Lady Macbeth, Hamlet, and char
acters of Greek mythology are good ex
amples.
"When it comes to a question of what
effect psychoanalysis has on morality, the
answer is this," concluded Mr. Powys,
"it will destroy spiritual inhibitions and
tabus, and will substitute a kindly, nat
ural, and sympathetic attitude, namely,
ordinary human common sense."
