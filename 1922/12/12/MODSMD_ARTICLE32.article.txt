# Books On Engineering Now On New Book Shelf

### 
Calculation of stress in frame struc
tures, an important problem in en
gineering, is discussed by two books
that are on the New Book Shelf at
the Library this week.
In "Theory of Frame Structures" by
C. A. Ellis, professor of structural en
gineering at the University of Illinois,
the essentials of the fundamental idea
are given different treatment than in
the usual reference book. Ellis illus
trates each principle by problems.
Milo S. Ketchum, director of the De
partment of Civil Engineering at the
University of Pennsylvania, takes up
the questions of stresses in "Design of
Steel Mill Buildings." He gives con
cise descriptions of stresses and prob
lems of detailed design of buildings
having self-supporting steel frames.
"Blue Printing and Modern Plan" by
B. H. Hall is intended to be of service
to engineers and architects engaged in
all forms of drafting. The methods of
working that Hall describes were thor
oughly tested in the war period. He
gives directions for copying by cam
era, photo printing, the photostat, and
the use of ordoverox.
