# TOURNEY IN MINOR SPORTS ATTRACTS MANY SPECTATORS
## Boxing Holds Center of Stage, Adams And Pennepacker Make Best Showing 
### HOWARD BISSELL, '24 
Nearly three hundred persons attend
ed the final contests in the combination
boxing, fencing, and wrestling tourna
ment conducted in Encina Gymnasium
last night. The crowd gathered prompt
ly and the matches started on time. The
program was concluded in little more
than an hour.
The contests began with two exhibi
tion bouts. Harry Maloney gave a
clever idea of how the fistic game should
be fought, with Jimmie Ross as his op
ponent. John Lane and William Burk
hart fought the second preliminary con
test. Both were two rounds in length,
giving time for the audience to get set
tled before the main matches began.
Adams-Penepacker Draw
The best fight of the evening was the
match between Adams and Penepacker,
who fought three rounds to a draw.
Both men showed a clever kriowledge of
the game and fought hard and straight
throughout their match.
McKee and Stoddard also fought to a
draw in a tensely interesting bout. Mc-
Kee seemed to have the advantage in
coolness of action, being able to time
his blows well and use all the openings
offered. Stoddard, on the other hand,
was a new man in the boxing game and
made his good stand through aggressive
ness and grit.
Paine beat Swing in the 127-pound
class in a good fight, two rounds of
which were even, the bout being decided
in the final round of the match. Hall
won from Sapero in the 138-pound class
by taking all three rounds, although each
was hotly contested. Huneke easily de
feated Kennedy in the 175-pound class,
but several well-aimed blows by Ken
nedy made the bout of interest. Robin
son and Morrison fought hard for a
decision which came in the last round,
Robinson getting the verdict.

ranged for next quarter, when the elimi
nation bouts for the team to meet Cali
fornia will be held. The coming meets
