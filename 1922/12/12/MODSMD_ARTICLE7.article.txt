# STANFORD SUBMITS PROPOSAL FOR COAST ORATORICAL LEAGUE
## 
### 
Stanford has proposed the forma
tion of a Pacific Coast Oratorical
league among the coast colleges. Un
der the Stanford plan the larger uni
versities and colleges on the Pacific
coast will hold a contest each year in
order to determine the oratorical
championship. A western orator may
be sent East to represent the Coast
in oratorical contests there.
# This plan has been submitted in
answer to the proposal of several
northern colleges for the formation of
an oratorical conference comprising
all of the colleges in California, Ore
gon, and Washington. Under this plan
elimination contests would be held in
each state and the state champions
would meet for the Coast title.
If the Stanford plan is accepted it
will probably include the Universities
of Washington, Oregon and California,
Oregon Agricultural College, Washing
ton State, U. S. C., and Stanford, ac
cording to Faculty Debating Advisor
J. G. Emerson.
In the belief of Emerson if this plan
is accepted it will do a great deal to
revive interest in public speaking on
the Coast.
