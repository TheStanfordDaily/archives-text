# Wranglers Will Discuss Stanford Men's Attitude
## 
### 
Whether the Stanford women are re
sponsible for the men's attitude toward
them as expressed in the article, "Throw
'Em Out," by Leon David, *25, which
appeared in the last number of the Pic
torial, will be the subject for discussion
at the meeting of Wranglers, to be held
Thursday at 7:30 in the Women's Club
house. Sidney Hawkins, '24, and Eliza
beth Pcircc, '24, will argue that the re
sponsibility rests with the women. Laura
Austin, '23. and Eunice Biddle, '24, will
be the negative speakers.
