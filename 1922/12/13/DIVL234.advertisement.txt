A Box of Wilson's Candy
What might be given in better taste or more
symbolic of Stanford than Wilson's candy?
It was in 1897 that "Sticky" Wilson, then a
student, first catered to campus sweet
tooths. Since then, "Leland Stanford,"
"Co-ed," "College Maid," and "Clods"
have won fame as the Stanford candies and
are sold in five Wilson's stores at
