# VARIETY OF PLAYS MAKE UP SHOW BILL FOR FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Variety in program and stage settings !
will be the outstanding characteristic of !
the Theater Workshop's choice of plays ;
for the performance Friday night. The
selections were made with the view of
giving a wide latitude to members of the
class in the matters of staging, direction
and acting.
It was originally hoped that plays
would be submitted by students in suffi
ciently finished form to make up the
evening's playbill. The short time in
which to prepare and deliver such prod
ucts of campus pens, however, prevented
that hope from being realized. It is ex
pected that the winter term may bring
to the boards several offerings by local
talent.
The first production is the Dunsany
play, "The Queen's Enemies," a grim lit
tle episode which has been staged very
rarely owing to its rather difficult set
ting.
The producers of this playlet, Harold
Minsky and Virginia Henderson, have
directed the acting to "get over" the cu
mulative suspense which suddenly and
most unexpectedly reaches its climax
as the swift ferocity of the Queen's
strategem becomes clear.
"Minnikin and Mannikin," a charming
fantasy by Alfred Kreymborg, will fol
low the tragic playlet. This little inter- 1
lude, dainty and quaintly humorous, will
prepare the audience for the robust mer- (
riment of Sir John Falstaff, whose ap-,
pearance in three scenes from "Henry j
IV" will close the evening's performance.
In this the class will endeavor to re- |
produce the stage of about 1622, when
Shakespeare's plays were being shown J
at the Globe Theater and the court of i
Queen Elizabeth. All scene shifting and I
stage work will be done in full view of I
the audience by stage hands in true
Shakespearian regalia.
Costumes, decorations, settings and
properties are the work of members of I
the Theater Workshop class.
