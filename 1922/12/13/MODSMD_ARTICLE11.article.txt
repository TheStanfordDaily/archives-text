# STUDENT COUNCILS BAR ALL FORMS OF EXTREME DANCING
## Burden of Control Placed on Organization Sponsoring Dance; “Chicago” Banned 
### 
Following the recommendation of the
Executive Committee made at its regu
lar meeting last night, the Men's Coun
cil has voted to forbid all forms of ex
treme dancing, such as characterized
by the "Chicago Walk"; the Women's
Council has endorsed this action.
i he burden of control will be placed
on the organizations giving the dance;
violations will be penalized by refusal of
the Executive Committee to grant any
future dates to the offending organiza
tion and personal cases will be handled
by the student councils.
In taking this stand, the two councils
believe that they have the great mass
of right-minded students behind them
as soon as the situation is understood. It
is not in harmony with Stanford tradi
tions to countenance dancing which is
harmful to the individuals who take part
in it and detrimental to the standing of
the University. Also, the councils feel
that it is unfair to ask the chaperons to
sanction by their presence dancing which
would not be tolerated in a public dance
hall.
Executive Committee recommended to
the Men's Council that the freshman
sophomore poster fight be conducted
without the use of water and without
night lighting. The plan submitted by
Quadrangle Club for the reorganization
of the tight was accepted with minor
reservations.
A committee, made up of the student
body president, the junior and senior
class presidents, the secretary of Men's
Council, and a representative from Ex
ecutive Committee, was constituted to
meet with the Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs.
The minutes of the meeting are as
follows:
