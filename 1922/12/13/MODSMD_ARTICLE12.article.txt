# SENIOR FIVE OVERWHELMS SOPHS IN CLASS MATCH
## 
### Max Stiles, ’25 
To be revised—one good novel en
titled "The Three Guardsmen," by Alex
andre Dumas; someone has just discov
ered that the author overlooked Glenn
Pollard, who is herewith nominated as
a fifth guardsmen to join D'Artagnan,
Porthos, Aramis, and Athos, whose re
spective last names are Austin, Suminy,
Piggott, and Mcßirney.
Last night our Five Guardsmen of the
Royal Senior Casaba became five veri
table personifications of "Doug" Fair
banks, which, of course, means that they
were invincible. Led by "D'Artagnan"
Austin at forward and Pollard at guard,
the senior quintet carried the sopho
mores off their feet and won their sec
ond victory of the interclass basketball'
series, 24 to 5. The winners used the
five-man defense to such advantage that
the sophs did not score a single field
j goal throughout the contest. All five
points were scored on fouls.
The senior second division club was
, also victorious, downing their rivals, 14
1 to 10.
Tonight the juniors and sophs tangle,
and tomorrow evening the Pavilion will
| see the biggest games of the season when
the seniors and frosh tangle for the
championship in each division. The sec
i ond division teams, each having won
two games and lost none, are scheduled
to take the court at 7:15. The winner
will be the undisputed champion of the
J second division.
At 8:15 the first division squads will
begin their battle for the championship.
A victory for the seniors will give Pol
lard's five the title; a frosh win would

give them a tie with the Sombreros in
the percentage column, and a play-off
game would be held to determine the
championship. Both quintets play hard,
fast, brainy basketball, and as they are
apparently evenly matched, a real battle
is anticipated. There is no just basis on
which we could consider either team a
favorite. The seniors arc undefeated,
while the frosh lost to the sophs. On
the other hand, the frosh, playing a
hundred per cent better than when they
met defeat, trounced the juniors, a team
which gave the seniors a stiff battle.
Pollard's five-man defense kept the
sophs worried throughout last night's
tilt. They had very few chances to
shoot, and when they did try for a bas
ket some red-shirt was always right
there to hurry the shot. Whenever the
seniors lost possession of the ball, all
five men gathered in a bunch, under
their own basket. Pollard always stuck
near his goal and played highly spec
tacular ball.
For an exhibition of beautiful drib
bling and basket shooting we have to
hand it to that little fellow Austin, senior
forward, who continually thrilled the
crowd with his perfect shots. He shot
six field goals and four fouls for a total
of 16 points. This is a record for one
game, beating Ernie Nevers' mark by
one point. McBirney, at running guard,
played a good game for the winners, but
it was Austin and Pollard who seemed
to be doing a greater part of the work.
McBirney's passing and dribbling was
especially commendable, and he proved
to be an important cog in the senior
teamwork.
Five minutes from the end of the game
the seniors speeded up their play in a
desperate attempt to keep their rivals
| from scoring a field goal. They suc
ceeded, never giving the sophs a smell
of the ring during the final period of
play.

hundred per cent better than when they
met defeat, trounced the juniors, a team
which gave the seniors a stiff battle.
Pollard's five-man defense kept the
sophs worried throughout last night's
tilt. They had very few chances to
shoot, and when they did try for a bas
ket some red-shirt was always right
there to hurry the shot. Whenever the
seniors lost possession of the ball, all
five men gathered in a bunch, under
their own basket. Pollard always stuck
near his goal and played highly spec
tacular ball.
For an exhibition of beautiful drib
bling and basket shooting we have to
hand it to that little fellow Austin, senior
forward, who continually thrilled the
crowd with his perfect shots. He shot
six field goals and four fouls for a total
of 16 points. This is a record for one
game, beating Ernie Nevers' mark by
one point. McBirney, at running guard,
played a good game for the winners, but
it was Austin and Pollard who seemed
to be doing a greater part of the work.
McBirney's passing and dribbling was
especially commendable, and he proved
to be an important cog in the senior
teamwork.
Five minutes from the end of the game
the seniors speeded up their play in a
desperate attempt to keep their rivals
| from scoring a field goal. They suc
ceeded, never giving the sophs a smell
of the ring during the final period of
play.

To be revised—one good novel en
titled "The Three Guardsmen," by Alex
andre Dumas; someone has just discov
ered that the author overlooked Glenn
Pollard, who is herewith nominated as
a fifth guardsmen to join D'Artagnan,
Porthos, Aramis, and Athos, whose re
spective last names are Austin, Suminy,
Piggott, and Mcßirney.
Last night our Five Guardsmen of the
Royal Senior Casaba became five veri
table personifications of "Doug" Fair
banks, which, of course, means that they
were invincible. Led by "D'Artagnan"
Austin at forward and Pollard at guard,
the senior quintet carried the sopho
mores off their feet and won their sec
ond victory of the interclass basketball'
series, 24 to 5. The winners used the
five-man defense to such advantage that
the sophs did not score a single field
j goal throughout the contest. All five
points were scored on fouls.
The senior second division club was
, also victorious, downing their rivals, 14
1 to 10.
Tonight the juniors and sophs tangle,
and tomorrow evening the Pavilion will
| see the biggest games of the season when
the seniors and frosh tangle for the
championship in each division. The sec
i ond division teams, each having won
two games and lost none, are scheduled
to take the court at 7:15. The winner
will be the undisputed champion of the
J second division.
At 8:15 the first division squads will
begin their battle for the championship.
A victory for the seniors will give Pol
lard's five the title; a frosh win would

give them a tie with the Sombreros in
the percentage column, and a play-off
game would be held to determine the
championship. Both quintets play hard,
fast, brainy basketball, and as they are
apparently evenly matched, a real battle
is anticipated. There is no just basis on
which we could consider either team a
favorite. The seniors arc undefeated,
while the frosh lost to the sophs. On
the other hand, the frosh, playing a
hundred per cent better than when they
met defeat, trounced the juniors, a team
which gave the seniors a stiff battle.
