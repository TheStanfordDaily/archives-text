# RAIN INTERFERES WITH PRACTICE OF CARDINAL GRIDMEN
## Varsity Will Practice Daily In Holidays For Intersectional Game With Pitt December 30 
### 
Rain and final examinations have about put a stop to football activities oa
the campus. The Cards are getting good practice for mud football by
charging around in the slush at the practice field, but Kerr can do little
actual teaching. «
As soon as the weather clears up and examinations are over, however, the
Card machine will start at full speed. There will be intensive practice daily
until the eve of the contest with the Pitt Panthers December 30 at the
Stadium.
Two days after the Stanford gridmen get to work in real earnest, on
December 23, "Pop" Warner and his easterners will arrive on the campus
and start training.
If the rain holds off on the last day of the year, the crowd should be the
second largest at Stanford this season —and that means something over

20,000. If the weather is bad, however,
there is no telling how the fans will
turn out.
In importance the Card-Pitt game
will be THE contest of .the country,
outshining the Penn State-U. S. C.
clash at Pasadena on New Year's Day,
and the Gonzaga-West Virginia affair
at San Diego on Christmas Day.
Warner's men may have the experi
ence and the better reputation, but
Stafford has the weight—and by De
cember 30 should have more football
knowledge than on November 25. The
Card line, with Dole at right end, tips
the scales 188 pound on an average,
while the Panthers tip the beam at five
pounds less per man.
Except for "Tiny" Hewitt the two
backfields are evenly matched in
weight. But with the 200 pounds of the
mastodon fullback included, Warner's
men average 171. Kerr's backfield av
erages 166 pounds.
What are Stanford's chances to beat
Pittsburgh, rated at the end of the
regular season as one of the best in
the East? A great deal depends on the
weather and on the progress made by
the Cards between now and December
30. A wet field will be a point in favor
of the visitors since they are accus
tomed to handling the slippery pig
skin and to ploughing through the
mud.
Stanford must stop the line-plunging
of Hewitt and Flanagan. That will be
quite a job, since Hewitt is a candi
date for all-American honors.
Several of Warner's men, among
them Captain Holleran, Hewitt, Win
terburne, Bowser, and Williams, will
play their last game for Pitt. On the
Cardinal side Captain DeGroot, Wil
cox, and Doughty will make their fare
well appearances.
No one seems to know exactly what
type of football the Panthers will play.
It is a safe guess that a great part
of Warner's attack is built around the
line-plunging of Hewitt, and Ander
son's forward passing. Warner, accord
ing to Kerr, is the most progressive
coach in football, so that Pitt may
have some new wrinkles.
Seventeen days before the game it
looks as if the following line-ups will
start:
Stanford Position Pittsburgh
Mertz (166) LER (166) Sauer
Shipkey (196) LTR (200) Gourley
Cravens (196) LGR (185) Sack
DeGroot (195) C (172) Bowser
Faville (196) RGL (206) Clark
Johnston (187) RTL (186) Simpson
Dole (185) REL (178) Williams
Woodward (158) Q (160) Holleran
Doughty (172) RHL (160) Flanagan
Wilcox (164) LHR (165) Anderson
