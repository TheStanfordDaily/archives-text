# WEBSTER DIDNâ€™T KNOW
## 
### 
When Webster defined dancing as being' "a regu
lated succession of movements, commonly to the
sound of music," lie didn't know how much advan
tage was to be taken of him. This definition is tre
mendously inclusive. Like the hood of a well
known automobile, it covers what may or may not
3>e, according to the point of view, a multitude of
sins. There is one redeeming feature in this defini
tion, however, and that is the word "regulated."
Executive Committee, at its last regular meeting
of the quarter last night, passed a resolution recom
mending to the Men's and Women's Councils the
prohibition of extreme forms of dancing on the
campus. This means, if the judiciary of student
government takes the recommended action, that the
word "regulated"' is to be used for the purpose of
setting Webster right.
Dancing hereafter, so far as extremes are con
cerned, will be left up to the organizations giving
the dance. If they permit undesirable forms, they
will without further parley lose the right to have
further social functions. This may be done in more
ways than one. The easiest and most effective
method is to have Executive Committee refuse to
grant further dates to the offending organization.
And if such measures will not correct the situation,
and, further, if the students do not care to co
operate to the extent of guaranteeing themselves the
privilege of dancing, then they will lose that priv
ilege. It does not seem possible that normal men
and women of college age should have to be ruled
by such drastic executive provisions. They should
treed no threats.
Ihe Registration dance next quarter will be
watched with considerable interest by those who care
about dancing, those who care about Stanford's
reputation, and those who are responsible for stu
dent conduct.
