# FIGHT AGAINST FIGHTâ€”ROUND THREE
## 
### 
The Poster Fight and its discussion has been
largely a process of discrimination, elimination, and
condensation. But the use of these three highly
alliterative terms has resulted in an underclass con
test that will do away with many of the evils and
-will at the same time perhaps do something to better
class spirit.
Executive Committee last night recommended to
the Men's Council the elimination of the use of
Searsville and the abolition of night fighting in
future class rushes and at the same time recom
mended except in minor detail the substitute fight
plans offered by Quadrangle Club.
Here are some of the good points in the plan:
All the fighting takes place within a period of two
hours instead of extending over two days and a
night. Night fighting and the forcing of Searsville
water down participants' throats are not included.
Those who have in any way been exposed to chills
are disbarred from further competition. Competi
tion between the two classes is so arranged that for
the most part underclassmen themselves may enjoy
it as s[>ectators. Many of the preliminary features
arc designed for this very purpose. Everything is
out in the open so that all may see what is going on.
The fight is so arranged that close upperclass super
vision will be possible. Even without supervision it
could scarcely resolve itself into so harmful a con
test as the old Poster Fight was. A point system is
worked out so that the committee in charge of the
contest may judge the winner without being accused
of favoring either faction. And, finally, the two
classes meet in the hills at a bonfire or some similar
function that night on friendly terms. This is noth
ing new. It was formerly the big tiling in class
fights. It is in itself a point favoring the claim that
such contests promote friendship.
This new plan as a substitute for the Poster Fight

is perhaps weak in places. No theoretical plan can
be expected to work smoothly or even to appear
fanltless in print. There are too many factions from
conservative to radical to satisfy. It is, however,
a foundation for a fight that may be a credit to Stan
ford and may do great good in promoting the ad
vantages claimed for previous class contests.
