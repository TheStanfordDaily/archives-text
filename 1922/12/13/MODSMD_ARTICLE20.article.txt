### 
Being as how this is the last issue, Cabbages feels
that it is only right to help out the advertising depart
ment so's they can make a good record for the quarter,
and takes this opportunity to print the following un
balanced column of want ads:
* * *
TAKEN BY MISTAKE—On Quad, one gray felt hat
from head; owner will please return same at once.
Lizzy Dizzy.
• • »
STOLEN —One box of matches from pocket. Thief will
please return same damn quick and get rewarded.
Ed Ibble.
• • «
WILL THE GENT who took my watch on the left side
of University avenue kindly keep to his own side of
the street? Y. Egg.
• • «
FOUND —Final examination paper. Owner may have
same if he can get it. Bill Bull.
» • •
WANTED —Position for young man of good family and
two sisters to act as cabin boy in log cabinet; salary
$3 an hour, board room, bath, and three meals a day.
O. Dam.

FOR SALE OR LEASE —Three overcoats, two hats, ten
scarfs, one auto robe, three lap robes, two gloves.
Apply check room pavilion on or after Dec. 7. Mike
Muck.

Hugo, the midnight moth, blew in the window last
night and in the resulting confusion remarked that the
varsity backfield was not in it with the line-up at the
pavilion. He personally counted 53 fullbacks, 10 half
backs, and an even dozen quarters. All the team needs
is a good line and some faster open plays

To the cabbagerial editor,
Say:
This purports to be a frank indictment of the un
warrantedly malicious malediction of those impregnable
idiosyncrasies with which I undertook to give expression
to and by constructive criticism and consecutive com
ment attempt to settle this matter once and for all. He
makes one fundamental assumption which is erroneous.
That, however, hypothetically hypercritical as it un
dubitably assumes to be, is immaterial to the question
at issue. By intense investigation the rudimentary writer
of that maligning missive may become informed that I
went to tremendous trouble to secure an alternative
date for the cotillion, some seventeen days before the
event came to a climax. Such criticism and discussion,
while indispensible, is superfluously superficial when
applied to innocent parties.

Hugo, the midnight moth, blew in the window last
night and in the resulting confusion remarked that the
varsity backfield was not in it with the line-up at the
pavilion. He personally counted 53 fullbacks, 10 half
backs, and an even dozen quarters. All the team needs
is a good line and some faster open plays

To the cabbagerial editor,
Say:
This purports to be a frank indictment of the un
warrantedly malicious malediction of those impregnable
idiosyncrasies with which I undertook to give expression
to and by constructive criticism and consecutive com
ment attempt to settle this matter once and for all. He
makes one fundamental assumption which is erroneous.
That, however, hypothetically hypercritical as it un
dubitably assumes to be, is immaterial to the question
at issue. By intense investigation the rudimentary writer
of that maligning missive may become informed that I
went to tremendous trouble to secure an alternative
date for the cotillion, some seventeen days before the
event came to a climax. Such criticism and discussion,
while indispensible, is superfluously superficial when
applied to innocent parties.
