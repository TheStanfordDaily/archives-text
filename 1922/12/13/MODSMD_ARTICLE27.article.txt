# Organ Recitals
## 
### 
Friday
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will give a special program in
honor of the hundredth anniversary of
the birth of Cesar Franck, on Friday,
at 4:15, in Memorial Church.
Cesar Franck was born in Liege, Bel
gium, in 1822, and died in Paris in
1890. He was one of the most profound
composers of modern times, and so
many French musicians were influenc
ed by him that he is regarded by
many as the founder of the modern
school of musical art in France. He
left a great symphony, and minor
works for orchestra; some very beau
tiful examples of chamber music and
choral works, the latter including his
masterpiece, "The Beatitudes," but the
serenity of Franck's character, and the
loftiness of his ideals, are nowhere
better illustrated than in his works for
organ.
