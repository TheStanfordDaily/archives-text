# ROOTERSâ€™ TICKETS GO ON SALE LAST TIME TOMORROW
## Advance Sale For Pittsburgh Game Is Small; Workers Announced For Dec. 30 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the Pittsburgh
game will be on sale for the last time
tomorrow afternoon from 1 to 5:30 in
the Administration building. Graduate
Manager W. D. Fletcher has announced
this sale because of the small number of
tickets disposed of at the two previous
sales.
Three hundred and ten rooters' tickets,
I including forty-three tickets to the
women's section, have been sold to date.
| According to Fletcher, more than two
hundred men have applied for jobs and
about one hundred and twenty will be
used. The list of all men who have been
accepted is now posted in Encina Gym
nasium near the entrance to the Gradu
ate Manager's office.
Fletcher declares that tomorrow's sale
will be the last for rooters' tickets and
that students who fail to take advantage
of it will be compelled to pay the regular
price of $3 if they wish to see the game.
Rooters' tickets are selling for $1 and
students must present their student body
cards when purchasing them.
Yell Leader Lou Minsky has issued the
following statements: "The game with
Pittsburgh is of more national impor
tance to Stanford than the rccent Big
Game, and purely from the standpoint of
football it should be better than any we
have seen this year. All Stanford root
ers, women as well as men, should be
there to support the Varsity in this con
test."
Minsky announces that men will wear
their rooters' hats at the game, but that
no complicated stunts will be attempted
unless the size of the rooting section
makes them practical.
Public sale of tickets began Monday
and will continue until the day of the
game. It is expected that a great many
tickets will be sold at the last minute
and that those waiting until just before
the game to buy their tickets will be
compelled to accept poorer seats.
Tickets may be gotten at the follow
ing places: Wideman's in Palo Alto,
Spauldings and Ellery Arms in San
Francisco, Spauldings in Oakland, the
White House in San Jose, and the Stu
dent Union on the University of Cali
fornia campus.
