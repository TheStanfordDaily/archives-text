Architecture—Today and Tomorrow
THE great buildings of today, designed in masses which rear rug
ged, mounting profiles into the sky, foretell even greater and »
more massive structures for the next half century. Always a close co*
ordination of architecture and engineering, of design and construc
tion, the architecture of the future will find architect and engineer
working ever more closely together.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organi- '
zation, will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture
of the future.
