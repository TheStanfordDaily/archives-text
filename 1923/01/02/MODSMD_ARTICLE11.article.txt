# PRESIDENT WILBUR DISCUSSES FOOTBALL TREND AT BANQUET
## 
### 
At a football banquet in the Colonial
room of the Hotel St. Francis in San
Francisco, given by the Hi Y organiza
tion of the Y. M. C. A. for the Stanford
and Pittsburgh varsities and the San
Francisco high school teams last Thurs
day night, President Wilbur clearly out
lined the tendencies of football as de
veloped in the past few years.
In discussing his subject, "Modern
Trend of Intercollegiate Athletics,"
President Wilbur pointed out that we
must beware of any taint of profession
alism in football as the foremost evil of
the game.
"We Americans as a nation are con
tinually overdoing amusements and by
too great enthusiasm very shortly run
their popularity into the ground. The
wave of enthusiasm for kewpie dolls is
an example. But, fortunately, football
is a seasonal game and consequently can
not be so easily overdone," the president
said. s
"But we must take care lest in our
desire to develop winning teams we un
duly urge men to attend one university
or another We must keep football as
an amateur sport unless we wish to see
it go the way of so many other games
into which professionalism has crept.
Baseball has had its scandals and so has
boxing, but football has not ben at
tacked seriously yet and we must keep
it straight.
"The game should be developed so
that it can be played by a large number
and can be learned and played by a green
man without any previous brilliant high
school record. It must be confined to
a sane limit of time and should not de
mand more than two hours a day from
clothes to clothes. Any game that does
should be given up.'*
In concluding, Dr. Wilbur said, "I see
no danger in building large stadia. It
doesn't matter how many see the game
as long as gambling and professionalism
are eliminated. Football is a great game,
the all-American game, but we must be
careful to make it truly so."
The program, which commenced after
the dinner had been served, was opened
by a few selections of wit as told by
Robbie Robertson, the Harry Lauder of
the A E. F. Following him were short
three-minute speeches by Captains Tom
my Holleran of the Pittsburgh team,
Dud DeGroot, Charlie Erb, and Coaches
Andy Smith, Andy Kerr, and Glenn
Warner.
