# GAME WITH 1921 STARS WILL OPEN COURT SCHEDULE
## Righter And Davies to Play Against Varsity Saturday; Kerr Holds Daily Practice 
### 
Some of the old basketball favorites
will come back next Saturday night,
I when stars of the 1921 Cardinal quintet
meet this year's varsity to open the 1923
!court season.
'| "Swede" Righter, the big blond for-
I ward, who used to be the nemesis of
" | every guard in the Pacific Coast Con
' ference, will lay aside his coaching duties
' at the College of Pacific long enough
! to play against the younger generation.
Righter's old running mate, Jimmy
Davies, will also be on hand. Davies
finished his court career at Stanford last
Ij season as captain of the quintet. Davies
! has the speed, while Righter has the
: j weight.
Others who played on the five in 1921
j are Fred Adams, captain and standing
guard; Bert Mills, center; and Dick
Richmond, running guard.
Nobody— not even Kerr or Captain
j Rogers—is able to tell at the present
time what kind of a showing the Cards
II will make in basketball this season. The
j material is heavier and more experienced
! than last year, and a great deal will
j depend on the style of game the five
! plays.
Football has hindered the practice, al
though Kerr has been in charge since
December 26. Bob Janssen, who did
the jumping at center last season, has
been occupied on the gridiron, and it
will take him some time to get into con
dition.
The material shapes up in this man
ner : Forwards—Rogers, McHose, Hoff
' man, Austin, Summy. Centers—Janssen,
Piggott, Steele. Guards—Hooper, Mc
» Burney, Anderson, Olivt.
More candidates were expected this
1 afternoon from the ranks of the gridiron
1 squad. There is some doubt as to
1 j whether DeGroot's knee, injured in foot
ball. will be able to hold up. Campbell,
1 who was a substitute guard last year,
; I will probably'be in the running for one
of the guard positions again.
There has been little doing at the bas
' ketball pavilion outside of practice in
? fundamentals.
i : There are two newcomers to Stanford
. basketball. Mcßurney, a transfer from
U. C. Southern Branch, is a candidate
for running guard. He is chunky, and
• i apparently adept at the court game.
[ Summy, who was a substitute on the
r I Washington five in 1921, is out for one
i! of the forward positions.
t! The 1925 quintet is preserved intact, all
• of the men who played against the Bruin
. Cubs being candidates for the Varsity.
; j They are Hoffman and Alexander, for
i wards; Steele, center; Hooper, Olive, and
Shipkey, guards.
