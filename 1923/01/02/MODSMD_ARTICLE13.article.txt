# Big Game Minus Bleacher Stunts, Crowds and Noise Seen by Shivering 6500
## 
### Pearl Bundick, ’23 
The Big Game minus the crowds,
minus the bleacher stunts and minus
the pep—that was the Pitt game Sat
urday afternoon. "Where was the
crowd?" a Pitt player asked after the
battle: the answer is easy—there
wasn't any. A week of rain and threat
ening clouds on the day of the contest
kept the attendance down to a shiver
ing 6500.
Pitt had annexed the Navy band
and a handful of leather-lunged sail
ors who accounted for most of the
noise from the north bleachers. There
was a saxophone artist in the band
who, with more aptness than ethics,
emitted dolorous and facetious noises
at appropriate intervals during the
game. Between halfeS fifteen gobs and
the Navy band staged a serpentine
for the benefit of the Cardinal sup
porters and the movie cameramen.
While they were gamboling on the
green, the Pitt rooters introduced a
totally new bleacher stunt to Coast
football fans. It was a cross between
Camp's famous twin-sixes and the pan
tomine song of kindergarten days be
ginning, "This is the way we wash
our clothes, wash our clothes, etc." We
couldn't make out the words the Pitts
burghers were singing, as they went
through their shadow boxing but this
is said to be one of their best stunts.
Stanford came back by singing the
"Gambolier" song—which is the first

time we remember hearing THAT at
a football game.
It was not until the team made its
magnificent drive in the final quarter
that the Cardinal rooters woke up.
The yell leaders had tried valiantly to
instill a little of the ol dfiglit into the
glumly silent bleachers but their lungs
didn't limber up until the red-shirts
began their march toward the Pitt
goal. When Dennis went over for the
touchdown, a Stanford rooter who had
been asserting prayerfully that the
team WOULD score now, shouted a
triumphant "I told you so!" And a
certain A. Smith, with true sports
manship, was as overjoyed (almost)
as any Stanford man in the bleachers.
When Cuddeback's boot sent the ball
spiraling between the goal posts, a
jubilant rooter was inspired to imitate
him by sending a gunnysack cushion
hurtling into the air. Then the fun
began. Hats, cushions and programs
were pressed into service as Irish
confetti.
Oh, boy! that last quarter was a
humdinger! And not a peew came
from the Cardinal supporter on the
north side who had implored the team
throughout the first three quarters to
"Pla-ay like you did against Ca-a-al!"
It takes just such a smashing, brilliant
finish to give the spectators plenty of
thrills and send them away exulting.

It was not until the team made its
magnificent drive in the final quarter
that the Cardinal rooters woke up.
The yell leaders had tried valiantly to
instill a little of the ol dfiglit into the
glumly silent bleachers but their lungs
didn't limber up until the red-shirts
began their march toward the Pitt
goal. When Dennis went over for the
touchdown, a Stanford rooter who had
been asserting prayerfully that the
team WOULD score now, shouted a
triumphant "I told you so!" And a
certain A. Smith, with true sports
manship, was as overjoyed (almost)
as any Stanford man in the bleachers.
When Cuddeback's boot sent the ball
spiraling between the goal posts, a
jubilant rooter was inspired to imitate
him by sending a gunnysack cushion
hurtling into the air. Then the fun
began. Hats, cushions and programs
were pressed into service as Irish
confetti.
Oh, boy! that last quarter was a
humdinger! And not a peew came
from the Cardinal supporter on the
north side who had implored the team
throughout the first three quarters to
"Pla-ay like you did against Ca-a-al!"
It takes just such a smashing, brilliant
finish to give the spectators plenty of
thrills and send them away exulting.
The Big Game minus the crowds,
minus the bleacher stunts and minus
the pep—that was the Pitt game Sat
urday afternoon. "Where was the
crowd?" a Pitt player asked after the
battle: the answer is easy—there
wasn't any. A week of rain and threat
ening clouds on the day of the contest
kept the attendance down to a shiver
ing 6500.
Pitt had annexed the Navy band
and a handful of leather-lunged sail
ors who accounted for most of the
noise from the north bleachers. There
was a saxophone artist in the band
who, with more aptness than ethics,
emitted dolorous and facetious noises
at appropriate intervals during the
game. Between halfeS fifteen gobs and
the Navy band staged a serpentine
for the benefit of the Cardinal sup
porters and the movie cameramen.
While they were gamboling on the
green, the Pitt rooters introduced a
totally new bleacher stunt to Coast
football fans. It was a cross between
Camp's famous twin-sixes and the pan
tomine song of kindergarten days be
ginning, "This is the way we wash
our clothes, wash our clothes, etc." We
couldn't make out the words the Pitts
burghers were singing, as they went
through their shadow boxing but this
is said to be one of their best stunts.
Stanford came back by singing the
"Gambolier" song—which is the first

time we remember hearing THAT at
a football game.
