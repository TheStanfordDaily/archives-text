# Charles Paddock Will Run in Eastern Meets
## 
### 
Charles Paddock, U. S. C. champion
sprinter, will compete in several Eastern
track meets this year.
Paddock intends to show his Eastern
critics that the timers made no mistake
at Santa Barbara by running on the East
ern tracks with Eastern timers. The rec
ords made by Paddock last year at the
Santa Barbara meet were not allowed by
the A. A. U. because they believed that
the timers had not been accurate.
This is the last year the southern flash
will be eligible to run for U. S. C.
