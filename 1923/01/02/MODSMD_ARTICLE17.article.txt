# PITT WINS ROM CARDS, 16-7
## STANFORD FAILS TO SHOW POWER UNTIL CLOSING MINUTES Kerr's Men Shove Over Touch-down In Fourth Quarter; Pittsburgh Has Edge For Three Periods 
### Garrett Elmore, ’23 
"Pop" Warner, twenty-five Warner-made football players, and several
miscellaneous aides traveled 2500 miles from Pittsburgh so that the Panthers
might oppose the Cardinals on the gridiron for sixty minutes.
The results of the afternoon of Saturday, December 30, when the clash took
place at the Stadium, shape up something like this: •
Pittsburgh beat Stanford, 16 to 7.
The East won from the West.
Warner (himself) beat Warner (his system). ,
Stanford won the fourth quarter.
De Groot won from Bowser.
The empty seats outnumbered the occupied ones, 9 to 1.
To begin at the end and work backward, the real contest didn't start until
the fourth quarter, after Pitt had amassed enough points to win. For the firsß

forty-five minutes Pittsburgh out
classed Stanford by a big enough mar
gin to make the game uninteresting.
As the fourth quarter opened,
Cleaveland punted to the Stanford 41-
yard line. Then Pitt accomplished the
most spectacular, and incidentally the
most perfect, piece of football seen at
Stanford this season. "Hoot" Flanagan
stepped back and tossed the ball tea
yards to John Anderson, who was sur
rounded by his mates. Anderson got
under way, and one by one the Pan
thers took the Cards out of the play.
Anderson kept on going until he was
across the goal line, when he was
brought to earth by Doughty.
That was too much for Stanford.
Kerr's men, who hadn't made a first
down all afternoon, began to show
Warner that they were a real football
team, and could do some forward
passing on their own account. Cudde
back, who was doing most of the work
in the Card backfield, received the
kick-off and brought the ball back to
mid-field.
Woodward abandoned the line
plunges which had been futile earlier
in the afternoon and called for forward
passes. Several went wild, but one
from Cleaveland to Thomas was com
pleted for fifteen yards. The Panther*
stiffened, and a pass from a place-kick
formation was intercepted by Hewitt.
But Stanford came right back. Kerr
sent in the men who were to carry
the ball over the Pitt goal line, and
save Stanford from rout. Dennis re
lieved Cleaveland; Campbell went in
for Woodward; Murray took Doughty's
place.
With Cuddeback, that trio forward
passed and bucked its way to Pitts
burgh's 5-yard mark. There the Pan
thers held—for two downs. The out
look was dismal for Stanford. But
Campbell hurled a short pass to Den
nis. That covered three yards. There
were two more to go, and one down
to make it in.
Campbell called the signals, Dennis
I took the ball on the run, and squeezed
I through a hole made by Johnston at
right tackle. He went over and Cudde
back kicked a goal for the extra point,
i The less said about Stanford's show-
ing in the first half the better. There
was something wrong with the team—
perhaps it was due to the absence of
Wilcox, whom the doctor ordered to
stay on the bench. Or it might have
been due to nervousness. There were
fumbles galore—and Bowser was right
on top of the ball nearly every time it
got loose.
"Tiny" Hewitt was like a street car.
He kept on going straight ahead until
he was brought to a stop —usually af
ter he had gained several yards. Then
those dinky forward passes bothered
the Cards. The Pitt quarters worked
them to death. None of them gained
many yards at a time, but Flanagan
and Anderson generally made the
yards in a pinch by the aerial route
Pitt's attack was varied —more so
than any other team that has played at
Stanford. Straight bucks, split bucks,
end runs, and finally deception plays,
kept Kerr's men on their toes as to
what was coming next.
In the battle of centers, DeGroot
had the shade over Bowser, whom
Walter Camp named on his second
all-American eleven. Bowser was out
weighed by the Stanford captain some
twenty pounds. DeGroot's knee was
hurt in the final quarter but he re
fused to leave the game, while Bow
ser retired in favor of Ashbaugh a
few minutes before the end.
Captain Holleran of the Panthers
was unable to play more than a few
minutes in the last quarter.

The East won from the West.
Warner (himself) beat Warner (his system). ,
Stanford won the fourth quarter.
De Groot won from Bowser.
The empty seats outnumbered the occupied ones, 9 to 1.
To begin at the end and work backward, the real contest didn't start until
the fourth quarter, after Pitt had amassed enough points to win. For the firsß

forty-five minutes Pittsburgh out
classed Stanford by a big enough mar
gin to make the game uninteresting.
As the fourth quarter opened,
Cleaveland punted to the Stanford 41-
yard line. Then Pitt accomplished the
most spectacular, and incidentally the
most perfect, piece of football seen at
Stanford this season. "Hoot" Flanagan
stepped back and tossed the ball tea
yards to John Anderson, who was sur
rounded by his mates. Anderson got
under way, and one by one the Pan
thers took the Cards out of the play.
Anderson kept on going until he was
across the goal line, when he was
brought to earth by Doughty.
That was too much for Stanford.
Kerr's men, who hadn't made a first
down all afternoon, began to show
Warner that they were a real football
team, and could do some forward
passing on their own account. Cudde
back, who was doing most of the work
in the Card backfield, received the
kick-off and brought the ball back to
mid-field.
Woodward abandoned the line
plunges which had been futile earlier
in the afternoon and called for forward
passes. Several went wild, but one
from Cleaveland to Thomas was com
pleted for fifteen yards. The Panther*
stiffened, and a pass from a place-kick
formation was intercepted by Hewitt.
But Stanford came right back. Kerr
sent in the men who were to carry
the ball over the Pitt goal line, and
save Stanford from rout. Dennis re
lieved Cleaveland; Campbell went in
for Woodward; Murray took Doughty's
place.
With Cuddeback, that trio forward
passed and bucked its way to Pitts
burgh's 5-yard mark. There the Pan
thers held—for two downs. The out
look was dismal for Stanford. But
Campbell hurled a short pass to Den
nis. That covered three yards. There
were two more to go, and one down
to make it in.
Campbell called the signals, Dennis
I took the ball on the run, and squeezed
I through a hole made by Johnston at
right tackle. He went over and Cudde
back kicked a goal for the extra point,
i The less said about Stanford's show-
ing in the first half the better. There
was something wrong with the team—
perhaps it was due to the absence of
Wilcox, whom the doctor ordered to
stay on the bench. Or it might have
been due to nervousness. There were
fumbles galore—and Bowser was right
on top of the ball nearly every time it
got loose.
"Tiny" Hewitt was like a street car.
He kept on going straight ahead until
he was brought to a stop —usually af
ter he had gained several yards. Then
those dinky forward passes bothered
the Cards. The Pitt quarters worked
them to death. None of them gained
many yards at a time, but Flanagan
and Anderson generally made the
yards in a pinch by the aerial route
Pitt's attack was varied —more so
than any other team that has played at
Stanford. Straight bucks, split bucks,
end runs, and finally deception plays,
kept Kerr's men on their toes as to
what was coming next.
In the battle of centers, DeGroot
had the shade over Bowser, whom
Walter Camp named on his second
all-American eleven. Bowser was out
weighed by the Stanford captain some
twenty pounds. DeGroot's knee was
hurt in the final quarter but he re
fused to leave the game, while Bow
ser retired in favor of Ashbaugh a
few minutes before the end.
Captain Holleran of the Panthers
was unable to play more than a few
minutes in the last quarter.

Cleaveland punted to the Stanford 41-
yard line. Then Pitt accomplished the
most spectacular, and incidentally the
most perfect, piece of football seen at
Stanford this season. "Hoot" Flanagan
stepped back and tossed the ball tea
yards to John Anderson, who was sur
rounded by his mates. Anderson got
under way, and one by one the Pan
thers took the Cards out of the play.
Anderson kept on going until he was
across the goal line, when he was
brought to earth by Doughty.
That was too much for Stanford.
Kerr's men, who hadn't made a first
down all afternoon, began to show
Warner that they were a real football
team, and could do some forward
passing on their own account. Cudde
back, who was doing most of the work
in the Card backfield, received the
kick-off and brought the ball back to
mid-field.
Woodward abandoned the line
plunges which had been futile earlier
in the afternoon and called for forward
passes. Several went wild, but one
from Cleaveland to Thomas was com
pleted for fifteen yards. The Panther*
stiffened, and a pass from a place-kick
formation was intercepted by Hewitt.
But Stanford came right back. Kerr
sent in the men who were to carry
the ball over the Pitt goal line, and
save Stanford from rout. Dennis re
lieved Cleaveland; Campbell went in
for Woodward; Murray took Doughty's
place.
With Cuddeback, that trio forward
passed and bucked its way to Pitts
burgh's 5-yard mark. There the Pan
thers held—for two downs. The out
look was dismal for Stanford. But
Campbell hurled a short pass to Den
nis. That covered three yards. There
were two more to go, and one down
to make it in.
Campbell called the signals, Dennis
I took the ball on the run, and squeezed
I through a hole made by Johnston at
right tackle. He went over and Cudde
back kicked a goal for the extra point,
i The less said about Stanford's show-
ing in the first half the better. There
was something wrong with the team—
perhaps it was due to the absence of
Wilcox, whom the doctor ordered to
stay on the bench. Or it might have
been due to nervousness. There were
fumbles galore—and Bowser was right
on top of the ball nearly every time it
got loose.
"Tiny" Hewitt was like a street car.
He kept on going straight ahead until
he was brought to a stop —usually af
ter he had gained several yards. Then
those dinky forward passes bothered
the Cards. The Pitt quarters worked
them to death. None of them gained
many yards at a time, but Flanagan
and Anderson generally made the
yards in a pinch by the aerial route
Pitt's attack was varied —more so
than any other team that has played at
Stanford. Straight bucks, split bucks,
end runs, and finally deception plays,
kept Kerr's men on their toes as to
what was coming next.
In the battle of centers, DeGroot
had the shade over Bowser, whom
Walter Camp named on his second
all-American eleven. Bowser was out
weighed by the Stanford captain some
twenty pounds. DeGroot's knee was
hurt in the final quarter but he re
fused to leave the game, while Bow
ser retired in favor of Ashbaugh a
few minutes before the end.
Captain Holleran of the Panthers
was unable to play more than a few
minutes in the last quarter.

"Pop" Warner, twenty-five Warner-made football players, and several
miscellaneous aides traveled 2500 miles from Pittsburgh so that the Panthers
might oppose the Cardinals on the gridiron for sixty minutes.
The results of the afternoon of Saturday, December 30, when the clash took
place at the Stadium, shape up something like this: •
Pittsburgh beat Stanford, 16 to 7.
The East won from the West.
Warner (himself) beat Warner (his system). ,
Stanford won the fourth quarter.
De Groot won from Bowser.
The empty seats outnumbered the occupied ones, 9 to 1.
To begin at the end and work backward, the real contest didn't start until
the fourth quarter, after Pitt had amassed enough points to win. For the firsß

forty-five minutes Pittsburgh out
classed Stanford by a big enough mar
gin to make the game uninteresting.
