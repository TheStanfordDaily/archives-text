# THE 						PITT GAME
## 
### 
Andy Kerr's men as a team looked like a group
of seasoned gridiron veterans during- the last
quarter of the Card-Pitt contest. A glimpse of
the future power and drive of the Stanford Var
sity was furnished a few of the opposing college
coaches who visited Stanford on that day. They
all went away feeling that strong competition for
Coast honors was going to be furnished by this
group of men for the next two years, and unless
the scho'astic knell is tolled in individual cases,
they have good cause for worry. And there's
where the chief objection to post-season games
enters.
The ordinary football season is long enough
for the average fan. When the big games of sec
tions are played the climax has been reached, and
it is usually a difficult task to rebuild interest after
the chief attractions have become a thing of the
past. But this objection might be overlooked if
it were not for endangering the scholastic stand
ing of the players themselves. A post-season
game is not worth the loss of a single man off a
football squad. No game staged more as a spec
tacle than as a contest is worth the termination
of a single individual's college career. Of course,
a football game and the practice entailed is not
in itself sufficient cause to put a man in the
danger zone, scholastically speaking, but it is a
contributory factor. In Stanford's case, where
the number of candidates is comparatively small,
this is a distinct disadvantage. Stanford cannot
afford it.
In making post-season games the exception
rather than the rule, the Coast Conference made
a move toward the protection of football and the
men who play it. As a regular part of a univer
sity's athletic schedule these belated intersec
tional contests cannot but spell disaster in one
shape or another. It is to be hoped that another
is not arranged for at least until Stanford indi
cates by her showing in local football circles that
she is in need of other worlds to conquer.
