The opening of the winter quarter sees
in view a good season in the dramatic
line, as Masquers, Ram's Head, and Eng
lish Club are all preparing to put,on
their best to meet the campus demand for
well-staged shows Masquers and Eng
lish Club usually attempt something dif
ferent from the direct-from-Broadway
farces that lack all attempt at "heavy"
or serious plots and parts. This year
should see no startling change from that
rule, for Masquers last quarter was con
sidering a play full of romance and real
life, which can be staged in a highly
effective manner. The character of the
English Club productions is well known,
"The Yellow Jacket" of two years ago,
and "If 1 Were King" of last year, be
ing typical examples of the substantial
mouth fuls undertaken by the club in
their annual show.

Ram's Head furnishes each year the
dose of burlesque that is highly enter
taining—and necessary—to the campus.
Coming as it does during the same quar
ter that two of the most serious produc
tions of the year occur, it hits the right
spot in the variety circle and keeps in
terest at a good pitch.

This brings up a question—why not
more of this variety appropriately sand
wiched in at the proper times During
the last quarter there were two plays
under Dramatic Council auspices—given
by Sword and Sandals, and the Sopho
more Class—and both of them were
farces. This quarter will evidently have
two performances of the heavier type.
If the Sophomore Class production were
changed over into the winter quarter, and
either the English Club or Masquers'
show was put on in the fall session,
there would be more variety per quarter,
and evidently more box receipts because
of greater interest. The Sophomore Class
almost invariably choose a farce to stage,
and a majority of the times Sword and
Sandals does the same. Two plays of
the same type in one quarter cannot be
expected to draw as well as they would
ii separated by a greater lapse of time.
