# FIRE BELL'S CLANG WAKES CAMPUS INTO FEVERISH ACTIVITY
## 
### 
Fire ! Fire ! Fire !
Residents of upper Alvarado were
startled out of their last day of restful
quiet before the return of the students
by the clangorous clang of the fire
truck's bell. Numerous reports spread
that the entire campus was in flames.
Law majors fervently prayed that it was
the Law building; Engineers hoped it
was the Engineering corner, and knew
that the prevalent winds there would soon
wipe out all possibilities of work next
term; many students who had been
granted the circle minus by the scholar
ship committee hoped that it was the
Registrar's office, and were busy hunt
ing kerosene when the paper went to
press.
But after valiant work by the members
of the Stanford Fire Department, the
soot was extinguished with a pail of
water in a chimney on upper Alvarado,
and quiet again settled on the Farm
