# Young Mr. 1923 Gets Welcome on Stanford Campus New Year's Eve
## 
### 
Who helps Old Man 1922 to wobble
out. and who gives Young Mr. 1923 the
glad hand on the Stanford campus-
That is a question that few people can
answer, because there aren't very many
Sons of the Stanford Red or members
of the Five Hundred on the Farm. But
| just the same Mr. 1923 gets a welcome
on New Year's eve.
Didn't the chimes on the campus greet
j the new year when they boomed out the
hour of twelve- Didn't whistles shriek
! their approvals, and didn't cars full of
! men and women, screaming, or blowing
horns, parade the campus- They did.
And, what was more prevalent but not
obvious, didn't almost every one make
New Year's resolutions- You can an
j swer that question yourself. Or rather
j a few lines from a comic opera can
| answer this question more truthfully.
"Resolutions- Yes, we make them, not
|to keep them, but to break them, for
we're only human after all."
