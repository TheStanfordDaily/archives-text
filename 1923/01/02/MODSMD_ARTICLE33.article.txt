# O'Brien Collection Will Remain in Art Gallery
## 
### 
The Frank Morgan O'Brien collection
of paintings will remain on exhibition
at the Art Gallery until January 8.
The time has been extended for the
benefit of the art students who are re
turning to the campus for the winter
quarter and who have not yet had an
opportunity to sec these paintings which
are now being shown for the first time
since O'Brien's death.
This collection occupies the large rear
room of the Gallery. An exhibit of art
photographs by Dr. Carl G. Wilson is in
one of the small rooms. In the other
room is a varied exhibit of color prints,
etchings and lithographs. Both of these
will be shown until the middle of the
month.
