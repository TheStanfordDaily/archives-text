# BERKELEY SORORITIES ARE ATTACKED BY BRIDGE CRAZE
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Cal., Jan. 2. — So
great has become the card-playing fad
at University of California sororities
that numerous houses have imposed
rules, which work the terrible hard
ship on the "sisters" of being restrict
ed to only 14 hours a day for bridge
playing.
The new rule is that there must be
no bridge playing before 10 a. m., and
none after 7 p. m. on school nights.
On other nights, the lid is off.
Some of the more studious sisters
decided that a grand slam in the
evening means a flunk in the morn
ing.
It was reported that the bridge
playing fad got so bad that the girls
were making a night of it, and taking
a cup of coffee and a morning rub in
place of regular breakfast before rush
ing off bleary-eyed to classes. The
first houses to pass the new rules
were Gamma Phi Beta, and Delta Zeta.
In other sororities, the sky—and the
dawn—is still the limit.
