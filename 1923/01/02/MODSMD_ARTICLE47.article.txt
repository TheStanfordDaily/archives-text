technical subjects, several of which are
being written by Stanford professors.
Dr. E. C. Franklin will soon publish a
treatise on "Liquid Ammonia as a Sol

paring an article on "Solubility."
Dr. Gilbert N. Lewis of the University
of California will also publish a paper

Twenty-one of this group of mono
