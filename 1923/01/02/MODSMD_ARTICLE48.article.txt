## 
### 
A standardized springboard, the in
vention of Ernest Brandsten, Stanford
swimming coach, has been adopted by
the Intercollegiate Swimming Associa
tion. All of the colleges of the asso
ciation will be required to install the
board according to certain definite speci
fications. It is thought that this will
do much to overcome the handicap which
divers have heretofore encountered in
going from one college to another, by
having to work off a board entirely dif
ferent from their own.
