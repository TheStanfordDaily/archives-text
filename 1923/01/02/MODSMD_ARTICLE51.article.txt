# DOPE PROVES RIGHT WHEN U.S.C. DEFEATS PENN BY 14-3 SCORE

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 2—At last
that long-sought, absolutely according
to dope, football game has been played.
For years critics have been predicting
the results of important football games
on the basis of comparative scores
only to have the contending teams
shatter all precedent and reverse the
proper order of things.
When the LTniversity of Southern
California Trojans yesterday demon
strated a superiority of eleven points
over the Nittany Lions of Penn State
they ran true to form and made the
prophets rejoice at an opportunity to
say "I told you so."
Pitt beat Stanford 16 to 7 —a margin
of nine points.
U. S. C. beat Stanford 6 to o—a0 —a
margin of six points.
Pitt beat Penn State by 14 points,
but U. S. C., because of a three point
poorer showing against Stanford fig
ured only eleven points better than
Penn State. And the final score was
U. S. C. 14; Penn State 3 —a margin
of eleven <points.
While there has been a tendency
during the past week to belittle west
ern football because of West Virginia
and Pittsburgh victories over Gonzaga
and Stanford, Coast enthusiasts claim
fairly enough that representative east
ern teams scored victories over the
teams that were not representative of
the best on the Coast.
West Virginia, victor over Pitts
burgh, beat Gonzaga—by one touch
down. West Virginia had not lost a
game all season and was rated as one
of the best in the East. Gonzaga had
not won a single game of real im
portance, and Pittsburgh defeated
Stanford which had lost to three other
Coast college teams. U. S. C., the only
really representative Coast team, won
its game. Bui its glory is tarnished by
the fact that the team it defeated had
lost three games to representative
eastern teams.
The last game of the 1922 season has
been played but the fans can continue
to discuss the merits of the eastern
athletes versus the superiority of the
western athlete from now until the
great I. C. A. A. A. A. track meet at
Cambridge next spring, when they will
have more facts with which to support
their arguments.
