# SOPHOMORE HOCKEY TEAM IS WINNER OF 1922 CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
By defeating the junior and freshman
hockey teams and tying the score with
the senior squad, the sophomores won
the 1922 interclass hockey championship.
The seniors ran the sophomores a close
race in the hockey tournament. Neither
team lost a game. The senior eleven
won their match from the freshmen by
a 2 to 1 score, but tied in the senior
junior and senior-sophomore games.
The speed of the forward line and the
strength of the halfbacks were the out
standing characteristics of the sophomore
team. Mabel McKibben, left inside;
Polly Learned, left halfback; Margaret
Watson, right wing; Carol Davis, right
inside, were the fastest players. They
shot through the opponent's defense and
were good at stopping the opposing
team's advance.
The last two games of the hockey sea
son were played between the seniors and
juniors and the sophomores and the
sophomores and freshmen. The fact
that the junior and senior squads were
evenly matched was shown by the 3-3
score, which was the outcome of the
match between these two squads. The
senior women had the superior backfield.
This advantage was balanced by the skill
of the junior halfbacks, Josephine and
Geraldine Franklin, and Alice Roth. The
speed of the junior and senior forward
lines was about equal.
The champion sophomore eleven had
an easy time defeating the freshmen. The
first-year squad could not stop the sopho
more advance, and once within the strik
ing circle, the sophomores soon made a
goal. A 6to 1 score was the result of
this match.
The interclass tournament concludes
the hockey season, which is the women's
fall sport. Basketball wil be played dur
ing the winter quarter.
