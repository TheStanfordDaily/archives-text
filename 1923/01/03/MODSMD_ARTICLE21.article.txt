NEW YORK, Jan. 3.—Joie Ray, who
has more or less of an iron-bound option
on the national one-mile title, has not
only saved his own amateur hide, but has
rendered a great service to the entire
athletic world by coming through at the
last minute with the $100 which the A.
A. U. claimed he had received over and
above his regular expenses to an Eastern
meet last year.
Joie was probably under the impression
that the A. A. U. was only having its
little joke and his eleventh-hour action
was most likely inspired by some hard
headed advice from a friend or well
wisher. There is not much doubt but
that a failure to pay would have resulted
in the farewell of the marvelous little
runner; so sport lovers in general heaved
a big sigh of relief to learn that Joie's
chest would be much in evidence at all the
biggest meets of the coming year. What
ever influence was brought to bear was
certainly exerted in a worthy cause.
To lose as colorful and as able an ath
lete as Joie Ray, while still running at
the top of his form and taking them all
as they come, would not only be a jolt
to his admirers, but a distinct disappoint
ment to the promoters of meets who are
planning to make expenses by exploiting
the famous miler in match races with
the best men in the country. In fact,
plans have already been made to enter
him in certain meets and his reinstate
ment as an amateur in good standing in
more or less of a new year's present to
track and field athletics.
