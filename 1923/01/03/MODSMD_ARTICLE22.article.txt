# Overheated Chimney and Smoking Wall Feature Second Big Fire Scare
## 
### 
An overheated chimney and a smok
ing wall last night aroused the campus
out of stupor incident to registration
day.
There is something about the new
year that seems different. Mr. 1923
likes the sensational, the exciting type
of thing. He enjoys shaking his wee
cherub body because of great mirth,
i His pranks are many. This perhaps
accounts for the great number of fires
and near-fires which have occurred on
the campus since the beginning of the
i year.
Along about dinner-time last night,
the campus was awakened into reality
I by insistent noise from a boisterous
fire siren. Vehicles joined the chase,
; but the location of the huge conflagra
tion seemed to be vague. Students
pursued the car in front of them, turn
ing whenever that vehicle did. Con
sequently, few saw the fire and more
thought that there really wasn't any.
. As a matter of fact, there wasn'tâ€”it
was only a "fire scare." At least that
| is what the occupants of Madrono hall
| said today when catapus convulsions
had subsided.
The chimney in the hall had become
! extremely hot, the surrounding hall
soon starting to smoke. The would-be
fire was extinguished with a bucket of
water before the Stanford Demon Fire
Fighters could arrive on the scene.
The wall was scorched but no serious
damage was done.
