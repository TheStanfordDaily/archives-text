# COLORED PRINTS ARE NOW IN ART GALLERY
## 
### 
A varied exhibition of colored prints
of etchings and block prints with litho
graphs and combinations of etchings and
: monotone prints, by several different
artists, is now being shown in one of the
i small rooms at the Art Gallery.
These prints arc exhibited with the
purpose of illustrating the numerous
methods of printing employed by artists.
They were selected from permanent col
lections owned by the University and
from material contributed by contem-
I porary artists for exhibition purposes.
Among important artists whose work
is being shown are Gustav Baumann,
i Brangwyn, and Baroness Gobanz, an
Austrian. A few of the best examples
of the work of James Carl of San Fran
cisco show a new method in colored
etching that he is perfecting.
Several Japanese prints, while not
"old masters," are old examples of the
way in which the Japanese have devel
oped this branch of art. There is one
study each from the work of Helen
Hyde and Bertha Lum, American artists,
who have studied in Japan, and who
both have bccomc famous for the Ori
ental quality of their original prints.
A large collection of photographed
I scenes from the Yosemite by Dr. Carl
Wilson, taken last summer, is in the sec
i ond small room of the Gallery. The
j pictures arc especially good from an in
formational standpoint, as they point
out the special scenes of interest and
give the observer a fair idea of the valley.
Frank Leos says, in criticizing the ar
j tistic value of the pictures, that Wilson
I has shown a good judgment of compo
. sition in his way of massing dark and
medium values and breaking up the sur
face with lights that many other artists
would do well to observe.
Dr. Wilson has provided a birdseye
j view chart of the Park, on which he has
indicated the points from which he took
the photographs. „
