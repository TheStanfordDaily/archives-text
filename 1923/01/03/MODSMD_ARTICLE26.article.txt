# NEW COACH ISSUES CALL FOR VARSITY BASEBALL MATERIAL
## Candidates for Positions On Two Teams Will Report for First Practice Tomorrow. 
### 
Baseball will begin on tbe Farm to
morrow afternoon, when freshman and
varsity tossers report to Coach Harry
Wolter on the varsity diamond at 4
o'clock.
Coach Wolter will take charge of both
squads temporarily. "Husky" Htint is
to take over the yearling nine as soon
as the basketball season is well under
way.
Wolter has several veterans and a
number of stars from last year's fresh
man squad to choose a line-up from and
he will start practice in earnest tomor
row. With the exception of "Red" Mail
lot, shortstop, the varsity infield will re
port for practice as it lined up last
season.
Woodward, who performed so satisfac
torily at first base, is back and should
have a better season than last year.
"Bud" is a sensational fielder and a
dangerous man with the stick. Claude
Peavey has completely recovered from
his operation for appendicitis and will
be back at the keystone sack. "Shorty"
Roberts, captain and second baseman of
the 1925 yearling team, will be a hard
man to keep off the team and may fit
into the vacancy left by Maillot. "Perc"
Heckendorf has another year and will
undoubtedly be seen around the difficult
corner.
In the outfield, Roy Carver and Parker
will be on hand from last year's varsity.
"Doc" Wayland will not be eligible, and
Dick Lawson and "Slim" McCandless
of the 1925 babe nine will give all com
ers a battle for the hard-hitting out
fielder's place.
Wolter will have a number of good
men ready for mound duty. Lowenstein
and Clark, veterans of last year, and
Teague, Aydelotte, and Solomon from
Kallam's team have all returned.
George Green, captain-elect and catcher
for the past two years on the varsity, has
not returned to college, and "Ike" Hol
ston, his understudy, will probably bat
tle with Jim Lawson for the job behind
the plate. Lawson played good ball on
the 1925 team and should make a strong
bid for the job.
Several other members of last year's
babe team will also be on hand to make
trouble for varsity Mulchay
at short. McDonald at first, and "Duke"
Follansbee, who plays almost any posi
tion. can be counted on to make compe
tition for positions keen.
Freshman material is a doubtful
quantity. A number of men come with
high school reputations, but just how the
babes will line up is unknown.
