# FROM GRIDIRON TO COURT
## 
### 
Stanford is getting a late start in basketball be
cause of the Pittsburgh game, but with Andy Kerr
at the wheel and a good prospective line-up hitting
on all five, everything points toward a successful
season. As it was in football, the first game is one
of the hardest. The 1921 Varsity was good enough
to take the Pacific Coast Conference gonfalon and
most of the members of that prize five are still in the
best of condition. In the absence of Andy Kerr,
Jimmy Davies has been putting the varsity candi
dates over the floor and has turned over a squad to
him that would look well in any man's gymnasium.
What the outcome of the game will be is in doubt.
Nobody has made capital of the fact that Andy
Kerr comes to Stanford highly recommended as a
basketball coach. The words "Kerr" and "football''
have become so closely associated on the campus
that everyone seems to have forgotten the coach's
record in the East. His teams in the past have won
a great majority of their games, and while that is no
reason to predict immediate and constant victory
here, it is something of an encouragement to Stan
ford basketball fans. Given fair material and even
breaks, together with the undivided support of the
students, Kerr may be expected to repeat his en
viable Eastern record. It would be stretching opti
mism a bit too much to expect a champion five this
year, but it is not only possible, but probable that a
team above the ordinary will be developed before the
winter quarter is over.
