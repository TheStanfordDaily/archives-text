# TALKING SPORTS TO DEATH
## 
### 
One of tile big objections raised in the recent and
many controversies over college sports, football in
particular, has been that of the waste of time in
gossip. It has been charged that great numbers of
students spend so much time predicting scores and
"doping" the outcome of games that they neglect
their work. The declaration is certainly not un
founded. There is more trine wasted in idle gossip
and meaningless "bull sessions" by the average stu
dent than the average candidate puts into practice
for squad membership. Inasmuch as mere talk will
get one nowhere, it would not only seem possible,
but necessary for the good of sports for students to
go out for the teams to spend their surplus energy
in practice. If it is the harm done scholarship that
causes this constant and unpleasant opposition to
athletics, then it is up to the students to talk less and
do more. Under the present circumstances they are
merely taking stones from the bottom of the foun
dation to put on top. It is the students' task to fur
nish a sound lower portion to keep the whole upper
structure of college sports from tumbling down
alxxit the ears of its participants. There are enough
agencies in the shape of conscientious objectors doing
their bit now to minimize college sports. Nothing but
constant effort and co-operation from within will
withstand the attacks of these groups. But more of
these agencies later. They have a lot coming one of
these days.
