# THE
						TRANSFER RULE
## 
### 
Conference rules regarding 1 the eligibility for
sports of transfer students arc yearly becoming more
strict. It is predicted that within a year or two trans
fers will be declared ineligible for all time. If this
is the case, it is about time for Stanford to take
measures to minimize the transferring of students
and to lay more emphasis upon the entrance of men
and women from preparatory schools. There was
a scare here about three years ago on the underclass
situation. It was said at that time that Stanford's
trend was toward a graduate university. If such is

the case, then Stanford is not the place many of us
have thought it to be. If it is not the case, then it
is only fair to the undergraduate body that rules
concerning the admission of transfers be altered or
else make it possible for students to enter without Phi
Beta Kappa averages. While it is admitted that
entrance requirements under the present regime have
great advantages, it begins to look very much as if
they are much stiffer than they were three years
ago. At any rate, the writer of this editorial
matriculated with thirteen recommended units. No
body's getting in today with such a miserable record
as that. There's a hitch somewhere.
More students transfer to Stanford than to any
other Western university of the same side. Before
long such students will be dead numbers so far as
intercollegiate activity is concerned. The result
may be imagined. It's time to start thinking about
the way out now.
