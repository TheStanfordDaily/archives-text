(California coeds are bridge crazy; houses are limit
ing play to fourteen hours a day.—News item.)
The coeds at Cal have got tired of the dance,
And of riding in autos and such,
They've abandoned the tea. They are looked at askance
For indulging the men very much.
For it's down with the queening, and up with the cards,
For bridge is the game that was sung by the bards.
It requires little brains, to get by very well,
And queening's so wearing, so the card-players tell!
But somehow we suspicion the fad was begun
By the women who queened not at all,
While the queens were away playing cards for their fun,
The non-queened get the hop on the ball!
We fear for the queens when they wake from the daze,
Of playing at bridge for a hundred-odd days.
Each will find her old place has been filled by a lime,
And she'll keep off of bridge till the end of all time.

No, Clarissa, the Code of Civil Procedure is not a

Dear Dad:

Stude: Don't be too damperticular about your Eng

"Didja ever see two girls meet again after a absence
from one another and kiss each other?" asks Reggie the
Rough. "And did you ever stop to consider that that
isn't right.—it's women doing men's work!"

•'Well, well," remarked the campus sage, as the alarm
clock roused him at 7:56, "better make that eight
o'clock. Gosh, only 79 days till finals.
