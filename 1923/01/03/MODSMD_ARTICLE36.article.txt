The winter quarter starts as every
other winter quarter has started for
many years—with talk of the athletes
that have been "disqualified." If we
would believe every rumor, the foot
ball team hit the skids en masse and
what there is left of "Dink" Temple
ton's track team isn't worth gathering
together. Undoubtedly some of those
who are really on the outside now will
be re-instated at a later date, so the
casualties are not as great as they
might seem at first sight.
Andy Kerr's ends have shown
steady improvement all season, and
they outplayed their opponents in the
Pittsburgh game. Mertz, Lawson, and
Thomas had little chance to do any
thing spectacular on the offense, they
were kept busy stopping the regula
tion end runs and criss-crosses, fake
and otherwise, that came their way.
The most encouraging thing about
the Pitt game was the way that the
Card gridmen jumped into the contest
and did things without a falter that
they had never done before. Doug
lass played tackle instead of his regu
lar guard position. Kerr's substitu
tions in the backfield left him without
a safety man, but Paul Murray took
the job, caught Flanagan's kicks, and
ran them back ten yards or more.
Art Wilcox would have steadied the
team, and it is doubtful whether there
would have been so much fumbling
at the start of the game. Wilcox was
about fifty per cent of the Stanford
backfield, and his absence left a large
gap.
Physically, the Cardinals had it over
the Panthers. "Pop" Warner has made
real football players out of men who
are not as well adapted physically as
many of the westerners. Some had
weight and some had height, but they
all knew their business. The eastern
players—if Pittsburgh is representa
tive—are smaller but more compactly
built than their brothers on the Pacific
Coast.
A decision in the contest of centers
between DeGroot and Bowser would
be hard to make. Bowser was the
more versatile of the two. He was all
over the field, intercepting passes and
recovering fumbles. DeGroot stuck
to his job more and played a less
spectacular game.
There will be nothing doing in the
football line until after the track meet
with California. In the interim, until
the weather is such that baseball and
track can start, basketball will mo
nopolize local interest. The court game
is growing fast in popularity, prob
ably because it is less complicated and
easier to watch.
Prospects on the court are not ex
ceptionally good or poor. The chief
danger is that a slow start will handi
cap the progress of the quintet all
season.
While Andy Kerr runs his varsity
basketers around, "Husky" Hunt is
busy weeding out his freshmen mate
rial. He has the squad pretty well
sized up, and like Kerr, will commence
to build his five.
