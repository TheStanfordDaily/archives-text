# LAMB STRESSES NEED FOR FIRE PREVENTION
## 
### 
'Co-operation is the needed tiling now
in preventing campus fires," said Fire
Marshal Ed Lamb. "The fire depart
ment has never been in better shape than
at present; we arc equipped to handle
any blaze that might develop. But that
is not the sole aim of the department;
flooding a place with water can be done,
but it will never have to be done if the
students will co-operate in fire preven
tion.
"There have been two fires already this
quarter, both of them caught in time to
save the buildings and contents with no
damage. They were caused by the over
heating of stoves, thus setting fire to the
soot in chimneys. This is a most dan
gerous fire, as it catches at the top and
in the hidden parts of the house, and
usually obtains much headway before
noticed.
"I have noticed that the premises which
were cleaned such a short time ago by
the University Clean-up Day are already
accumulating rubbish in attics and cel
lars. 1 his is the most efficacious way
known of setting afire a building and
giving the fire material to burn till it can 1
catch the house itself.
"Another thing which is again failing
to receive attention from living groups j
is the wiring. No wiring should be done;
without the sanction of the University
engineer. Mr. McDonald will gladly
furnish a man to inspect all campus wir
ing and suggest safeguards. Overloaded
wires naturally heat, and many fires start
from no other cause.
"There is not a university in the conn- j
try which has not had a big loss fromj
fire this year. University of lowa lost ,
i $200,000 building not a month ago; a'
California sorority house burned to the!
ground during the vacation period; Uni
versity of Nevada lost a training house
through carelessness in leaving a heater :
going; such accidents are too common to
require mention. And it is almost all
preventable if people would only think.
"Another thing which has come to my
attention in running to the last two lircs."
Marshal Lamb continued, "is 'he careless -
ness of students in blocking the file
truck with their cars. During the run
last night we had to wait until a big 1
touring car, which was racing up to the
fi r e, pulled off to one side, before pro

ceeding. That sort of thing will nor be
tolerated a moment. Students should
keep their cars off the narrow streets
when they hear the fire gong; pulling
over to one side will greatly aid our

J progress. Furthermore, anyone caught!
i racing the truck or blocking its passage
; with a car will be forbidden to use a car;
I on the Stanford campus age-in."
