BASTROP, La., Jan. 3. —Citizens of
Morehouse Parish how attend the
open hearing in the courthouse here
beginning Friday to investigate the
kidnaping and murder of Watt Daniels
and Thomas Richards by a hooded
mob, must cheek their shooting irons
outside the court.
Up in this country, where the roads
are dark and homes far apart, where
customs centuries old, mockingly bow
and yield to the strange demands of a
newer civilization, the men carry wea
pons as a matter of course, and "since
that Mer Rouge affair," they have
oiled up their guns for action.
But during the hearing, for the first
time in the romantic history of More
house Parish, its citizens will not be
permitted to keep their side-arms.
