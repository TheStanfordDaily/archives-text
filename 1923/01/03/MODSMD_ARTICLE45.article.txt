# KERR HAS FOUR OLD MEN BACK FOR 1923 BASKETBALL SEASON
## 
### 
If the veterans of the 1922 basket
ball season are able to make experi
ence count, there will be only one j
vacancy in the new squad now being
moulded by Andy Kerr. That place
is the running guard niche filled by
Dick Richmond last year.
With the announcement today that
Dud DeGroot would be back on the
floor this year as soon as he is able to
take his knee out of its cast, the line
up of veterans reads: Forwards, Rog
ers, McHose; center, Janssen; guards,
DeGroot, and any one of about five
from last year's varsity squad, this
providing some sophomore does not
make the place.
The quintet, when it is chosen, will
go into action against a gang of fight
ers in its first game. These are the
1921 varsity squad, who still claim,the
Pacific Coast Conference champion
ship of two years ago. Even if they
are not champions, as the negative in
the two-year-old dispute holds —they
beat the champions when they cleaned
up on California 30-25 in the final
game of the series. California then
announced that the play-off was not a
conference game, and the matter hung
in the air.
Anyway, Andy Kerr is giving his
men a good stiff introduction to its
six weeks' season, and whether they

win or not—their possibilities at pres
ent are one of the mysteries—they
will learn a lot from the boys who
played under Walter Powell.
- Following the forty-minute period of
instruction next Saturday, the present
varsity will meet"Swede" Righter's
College of Pacific five on January 10.
