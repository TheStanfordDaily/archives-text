PARIS, Jan. 3.—The British delega
tion to the allied premiers' conference,
will withdraw tomorrow, if Premier
Poincare insists upon the French repara
tions plan as the sole basis for discussion,
pit was announced today.
The French cabinet voted today that
the British plan of reducing the German
payments to fifty billion gold marks with
a four-year moratorium and no coercion
was "absolutely inacceptable." It in
structed Premier Poincare to request the
conference to adopt the French plan.
The British declared the premiers'
parley may end abruptly at any time now,
and that they see no possibility of con
ciliating the plans of France and Eng
land toward collecting German repara
tions.
French official circles likewise admitted
the plans submitted by the two countries
were divergent as to make agreement
practically impossible.
Belgium and Italy were closely akin to
France in their reparations aspirations.
Neither agreed with Poincaire flatly re
garding guarantees, however, and it was
admitted continuance of the conference
depended entirely upon British accept
ance and use of the French plan as a basis
for discussion.
If Great Britain refuses, as is indi
cated, by her delegation, France is ready
to act alone, it was announced.
The French cabinet issued a ciom
munique after examining the British note
saying it had unanimously decided the
lyiglish program means a considerable
reduction of French rights, new delays,
no securities and abandonment of essen
tial clauses of the Versailles treaty.
Poincare came out of the meeting and
announced he would open the afternoon
session by explaining why France
couldn't accept the British plan, and ask
a vote on the French project as represent
ing a minimum demand. If it was re
fused by Britain, the French said, the
conference w'ould end.
