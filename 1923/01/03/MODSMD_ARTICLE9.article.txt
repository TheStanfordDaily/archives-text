Journalism Scholarship Founded
An anonymous donor has established
this year a scholarship of $150 for the
benefit of a student in journalism.
Dr. Lawrence Becking, a member of
the Stanford faculty, has presented the
University with a collection of plaster
casts of Assyrian, Egyptian, and Italian
sculptures in the Museums of Berlin,
Genoa, and Leydcn.
Indian Relics Received
George F. Morrell, Stanford '11, a
resident of Palo Alto, has given the Uni
versity for its historical collections a
considerable number of California In
dian stone mortars.
Miss Laura Harlow of Oakland pre
sented the University for its museum a
piece of the original Plymouth Rock.
F. W. Nunenmacher of Piedmont has
presented Stanford University with a
valuable collection of more than 3,000
specimens of flies, bees, and wasps,
beautifully mounted and labeled.
Nunenmacher, who is a landscape gar
dener, has long been interested in en
tomology and has made valuable scien
tiiic collections, especially of lady bugs,
or as the scientists term them, "lady
bird beetles."
In November he attended a meeting of
entomologists, held on the Stanford
campus, and at that time became inter
ested in Stanford's equipment and
achievements in entomology. As a re
sult upon his return home he presented
the Unverisity with this collection of
dipter and hymenoptcra.
Memorial Scholarship Increased
Other recent gifts to the University,
as announced by the president's office,
include $900 from John T. Cooper of
Los Angeles, who graduated from the
University in 1904, and was the holder
of the Leland Stanford Junior Memorial
Scholarship as an undergraduate. This
scholarship, which was established by
Mrs. Stanford, provides for the ordinary
living expenses and the cost of books and
fees for its holder.
Cooper has added this $900 to the prin
cipal of the fund with the idea of mak
ing it possible in time to establish two
more memorial scholarships of a similar
character.
