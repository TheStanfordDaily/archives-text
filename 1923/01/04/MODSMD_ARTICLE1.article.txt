## BRITISH DELEGATES SAY CONFERENCE IS FAILURE 
### (By United Press 
PARIS, Jan. 4. —The British dele
gation announced this afternoon that
the reparations conference will end in
a disagreement.
Premier Bonar Law has decided to
end useless discussion at the allied
reparations conference and return to
London this evening, according to
members of the British delegation.
The premiers' parley was declared
by observers, delegates and the
French press to be in a state of hope
less deadlock.
Delegates lunched with President
Millerand at the Elyssee, after which
discussions in a last effort to recon
cil French and British views on col
lections of reparations were to be re
sumed.
British experts spent practically all
night working out details of Bonar
Law's reply to Poincaire, who yester
day insisted upon the French plan of
"guarantees" which Great Britain con
siders coercive.
