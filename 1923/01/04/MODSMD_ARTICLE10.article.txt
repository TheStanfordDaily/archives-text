# TRYOUTS CONTINUED FOR MASQUERS PLAY
## 
### 
Second tryouts for Masquers Soc
iety's play, to be given 011 January 26,
are being held this afternoon from
2:30 to 5 and this evening from 7 to
9:30 in the Assembly hall. The cast
will be announced on Friday.
"Romance" by Edgar Sheldon was
originally chosen by Masquers for
their annual presentation, but the pro
duction "Enter Madame," given by the
San Francisco Stage Guild under the
auspices of the Palo Alto Community
Players in the Assembly Hall on De
cember 18, made it seem inadvisable
to give "Romance." For this and
other reasons, another play has been
selected.
The play now chosen is one which,
according to Director Bentinck, cam
pus audiences would not be likely to
see 011 the professional stage. It was
a phenomenal success during its pro
duction in New York by a famous
group, and is considered to be a play
of great merit.
The following persons, who passed
the first tryouts held yesterday, as
well as those who passed the tryouts
held before vacation are eligible for
second tryouts today:
Dorothy Muller, Evelyn Huntington,
Dorothy Forch, Dorothy Dahler. Aucr
usta Corey, Heien Whitney, Edythe
Baylis, Irene Campbell, Ruth Wilson,
Frank Chase, Colin Timmons, Fred
erick Barlow, Walter Hays, Murray
Ward.
