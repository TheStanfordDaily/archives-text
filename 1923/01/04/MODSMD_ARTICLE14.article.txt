# LIBRARY OBTAINS RARE EDITION OF “DIAL” OF 1840
## Emerson’s Magazine Declared ”Most Remarkable Thing of Its Kind” by Critic. 
### 
A complete set of the "Dial" as
originally published in four bound vol
umes, edited by Ralph Waldo Emer
son, in the transcendental period of
1840 as the exponent of the Brook
Farm experiment, has been procured
by the Library. Complete sets in this
I condition are extremely rare.
This quarterly magazine, essentially
! Boston in spirit, first appeared in 1840
and was published for a period of four
years under the joint editorship of
Emerson and Margaret Fuller, a bril
liant young writer.
George William Curtis, nationally
known literary critic, says the "Dial"
is the most remarkable thing of its
kind, comparable to Schiller's "Horen"
but since the latter was not very suc
, cessful the "Dial" stands unique. Its
circle of readers and contributors was
small, but it contains some of the best
writings of Emerson, Fuller, Parker,
! and Thoreau. Other authors, less
famous, are Dana, Elizabeth Peabody,
John S. Dwight, Parke Goodwin, and
i Hawthorne. This assortment of Ameri
i can philosophers and men of letters
| were all members of the Brook Farm,
which was founded with the idea of
having a philosophical colony on a
communistic basis.
The quarterly was especially dedi
i cated to literature, philosophy and re
ligion. The active interest it evinced
in German literature and music, and
Parker's preaching, were signs of the
general moral and intellectual revival
impetus to which the anti-slavery and
women's rights agitation belongs.
While not an organ of any particular
movement, it was the literary gazette
of the new spirit. Its natural editor
was Emerson, the peculiar representa
tive of Transcendentalism, whose in
fluence was noiseless but extraordi
nary.
This set of the "Dial" contains the
I engraved book plate of Edwin B. Hol-
I den.
