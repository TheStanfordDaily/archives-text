# COMMUNITY PLAYERS WILL SPONSOR MORE PRESENTATIONS HERE
## 
### 
Following "Enter Madame," which was
given in the Assembly Hull on Decem
ber 18, the Palo Alto Community Play
ers plan to secure several further en
gagements with the San Francisco Stage
Guild for .presentation in the Assembly
Hall of plays which the Stage Guild have
been giving at the Plaza Theater.
"Enter Madame," although it played
to an audience necessarily small because
of University examinations, was pro
claimed a remarkable success by Palo
Alto critics. The lead was carried by
Medea Radzina, the Russian actrcss, who
was associated with Stanislavsky, the
founder of the Moscow Art Theater.
Mme. Radzina gave a very brilliant in
terpretation of the temperamental prima
donna, Delia Robbia. The supporting cast,
which contains stars of other perform
ances, and is the same cast that has been
playing at the Plaza Theater, includes:
Sam Hume, Mildred Martin, Dan Toth
eron, Irving Pichel, Mary Morris, Lloyd
Corrigan, Virginia Sciaroni, Irene Mc-
Swain, and Kiichi Nishino.
The Palo Alto Community Players,
organized last year, is an organization
for the purpose of developing Palo Alto
dramatic talent and for procuring for
presentation under their auspices certain
good plays which the community would
not be likely to see otherwise. The mem
bership includes more than 600.
