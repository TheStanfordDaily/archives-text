# SOCCER SQUADS WORK OUT AFTER VACATION
## 
### 
After a lay-off of nearly three weeks,
varsity and freshmen soccer practice
were resumed yesterday afternoon.
Work consisted of kicking and goal
mage. The men appeared to be in
good condition in spite of lack of re
cent practice.
The varsity .champions of the Soccer
League, remained nearly intact for this
quarter. Orlo Hayes, an experienced
fullback, is not registered this quarter.
Coach Maloney is confident, however,
that he will be able to replace any of
those lost from the wealth of substi
tutes on hand.
The freshmen team presents quite a
different problem to be solved by the
coaches. Beaten by the California
babes due to lack of experience, the
freshmen are working hard in the hope
of staging a come-back. Assistant
coach Reynolds, who has charge of the
'26 men, believes that by the time the
return game is played they will show
a much better defensive and offensive
game.
