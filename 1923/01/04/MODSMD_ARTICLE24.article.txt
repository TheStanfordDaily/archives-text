To those undergraduates who cynically laugh or
complain with unreasoning constancy about the state
of Stanford athletics, a pertinent pointer or two
might at once serve to clarify the situation and to
improve it at the same time. With a blind trust in
fate, the bulk of the undergraduate body waits hope
fully at the Registrar's gate for the possible entrance
of future Stanford stars. Their vision fails to ex
tend beyond the immediate Stanford horizon. They
have become so used to thinking in terms of entrance
requirements that they leave the burden of responsi
bility upon the somewhat unsuspecting, but never
theless more optimistic, alumni. When the average
Stanford student learns that his home town high
school has splendid athletic material, he groans and
sourly points to the "fresh meat for competing col
leges." Few undergraduates make any definite effort
to secure .for Stanford many of these men who could
get into Stanford if they would. The road to suc
cess in Stanford athletics is surely along the road
of student effort and co-operation in such matters
as these.
But the fault docs not limit itself to this field. De
spite the handicap, certain hard-working and deeply
interested alumni would put Stanford on the athletic
map with far more emphasis than might readily be
suspected. Where the alumni are baffled is in the
student's rightful field of endeavor. Having secured
men who are at once athletes and students for Stan
ford. it is a distinct disappointment to students of a
bygone day to see their proteges suddenly ejected on
the ground of deficient scholarship. It certainly
seems, judging by the results of the potshot taken at
Stanford teams last quarter, that there is a vast
amount of room for a little missionary work. Stu
dents have been urged time and again to help out
those who are taking part in undergraduate activity,
but somehow'the admonition seems to have no effect.
The task seems so big that individuals shrink from
an attempt to meet it. And yet it will be by indi
vidual effort only that any improvement may be
made along these lines. It is safe to say that fully
50 per cent of the students enrolled in the University
are in a position to give help in one way or another
to those who most need it. If one-fifth of those who
are in such a position would really do something,
the problem would be solved. Even one-tenth would
be of material benefit to Stanford athletics. When
is this spirit of helpfulness as well as self-help going
to manifest itself?

dents have been urged time and again to help out
those who are taking part in undergraduate activity,
but somehow'the admonition seems to have no effect.
The task seems so big that individuals shrink from
an attempt to meet it. And yet it will be by indi
vidual effort only that any improvement may be
made along these lines. It is safe to say that fully
50 per cent of the students enrolled in the University
are in a position to give help in one way or another
to those who most need it. If one-fifth of those who
are in such a position would really do something,
the problem would be solved. Even one-tenth would
be of material benefit to Stanford athletics. When
is this spirit of helpfulness as well as self-help going
to manifest itself?
To those undergraduates who cynically laugh or
complain with unreasoning constancy about the state
of Stanford athletics, a pertinent pointer or two
might at once serve to clarify the situation and to
improve it at the same time. With a blind trust in
fate, the bulk of the undergraduate body waits hope
fully at the Registrar's gate for the possible entrance
of future Stanford stars. Their vision fails to ex
tend beyond the immediate Stanford horizon. They
have become so used to thinking in terms of entrance
requirements that they leave the burden of responsi
bility upon the somewhat unsuspecting, but never
theless more optimistic, alumni. When the average
Stanford student learns that his home town high
school has splendid athletic material, he groans and
sourly points to the "fresh meat for competing col
leges." Few undergraduates make any definite effort
to secure .for Stanford many of these men who could
get into Stanford if they would. The road to suc
cess in Stanford athletics is surely along the road
of student effort and co-operation in such matters
as these.
But the fault docs not limit itself to this field. De
spite the handicap, certain hard-working and deeply
interested alumni would put Stanford on the athletic
map with far more emphasis than might readily be
suspected. Where the alumni are baffled is in the
student's rightful field of endeavor. Having secured
men who are at once athletes and students for Stan
ford. it is a distinct disappointment to students of a
bygone day to see their proteges suddenly ejected on
the ground of deficient scholarship. It certainly
seems, judging by the results of the potshot taken at
Stanford teams last quarter, that there is a vast
amount of room for a little missionary work. Stu
