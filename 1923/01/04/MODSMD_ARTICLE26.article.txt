# LEAVING A GOOD THING
## 
### 
Strange as it may seem, a great number of stu
dents when graduation nears declare that they can
hardly wait until the day when they set foot off the
campus for what they predict to be all time. What
causes all this rush to get out just at a time when
leaving should be regretted is hard to say. These
very sentimental passages from college stories which
refer to the grave senior shedding tears in the moon
light as he thinks how sad it will be to leave his
Alma Mater are for the most part mere literary effort
expended upon an unappreciative public. As a mat
ter of fact, it is usually the very person who leaves
in such a hurry who likes to think of himself as
shedding tears at the parting some years after gradu
ation. It is the man or woman who has done noth
ing in college, the person who has not even per
formed very creditably in scholarship, who in his

later days regrets the past and paints sentimental
pictures of a "might have been." It is not too late
for the present college generation to prepare a
pleasanter background for reference in the long days
of alumni-ism that loom up ahead.
