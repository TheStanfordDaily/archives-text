Now that the dry season has arrived —everybody's
doing the Wright Act —it seems appropriate to publish
the few rules regarding rough weather which the
Campus Community Protective Association has pub
lished for the guidance of unsophisticated students,
and also for all freshmen.
I—Never borrow someone else's umbrella in a hurry
when it is raining hard. A student who did that once
died. The umbrella had holes in it, and he caught
pneumonia. Always take plenty of time in selecting
your umbrella.
2 —ln choosing your rubbers, overshoes, galoshes,
or Fords, to keep your feet from getting damp, wet,
or even soaked (sh-h-h-h) —be careful to get the latest
stream-line style. If the streams by the P. O. and the
car tracks get too big, learn to swim.
3—lf you see a friend coming down the street in a
pouring deluge of rain and hail, bareheaded, with worn
out shoes and no overcoat or umbrella, be a gentleman
and tell him to go some place where he's not likely to
get damp. Under no circumstances offer him your own
coat. There are cases on record where such an offer
was accepted.

HEY, FELLOWS, THIS IS FREE!
Tuition costs,
So do text-books,
And syllabi,
And meals aren't free;.
Neither are dances.
But this verse (?) is.
Maybe that's why
It's so unpopular.
