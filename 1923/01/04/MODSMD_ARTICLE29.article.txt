## Committee Investigates Honor System at Cornell 
### 
Reports on the honor system at Cor
nell University drawn up by the fac
ulty committee appointed to investi
gate the system have been sent to
faculty members with special recom
mendations. The.reports advocate the
following:
If a teacher finds grounds for sus
pecting fraud he should not first con
fer with the student suspected unless
necessary. If there is any doubt, the
case should be referred to the Chair
man of the Student Honor Committee.
If a student is under suspicion at
the time a grade report is due, a grade
should be given for the work regard
less of any suspicion.
From the point of view of the honor
system there is no objection to taking
the roll when the examination begins.
Unless the students requests it, it
is not desirable to set different sets
of questions for the students occupy
ing alternate seats even if the exami
j nation room be crowded.
The teacher should not require the
student to record on his examination
book the number of the seat which
he occupied.
Cases of fraud in matters of attend
ance should be dealt with like other
instances of fraud.
A department calling for reports on
home readings, home problems or
other outside assignments should give
the class written instructions, detailed
and specific, about the manner in
which the work is to be done and the
amount of cooperation between stu
dents, if any, which is permissible. In
such cases the prosecution is that the
work must be done individually unless
coopei ition among students has been
specifically authorized.
The faculty members are to act on
j these suggestions and recommend
them for adoption by the students.
