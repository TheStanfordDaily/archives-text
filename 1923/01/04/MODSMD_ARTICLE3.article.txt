## 
### (By United Press 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 4.â€”Patrons
of cafes as well as proprietors, will be
arrested in prohibition raids hereafter,
Samuel Rutter, prohibition director,
declared today, if cafe proprietors
when arrested present the defense
that liquor seized belonged to guests
and not to them.
"We will see how many people take
chances on patronizing cafes where
bootlegging is indulged in if they
know they are going to be arrested in
case of a raid," Rutter declared.
He explained that in the past only
proprietors had been arrested and pat
rons were permitted to go unmolested.
"Some of them who have been pres
ent at raids have got quite a kick out
of it," Rutter commented.
