Studehaker car owned by E: J. Thomas,
565 Lincoln street, Palo Alto, last Friday
night to "take a ride." Bowman was ar
rested by Officer W. Evans last night
near Encina Hall as he attempted \p enter
the car. which lie says he left there Mon
day. Smith lias not been found.
The car was taken from in front of
the P'alo Alto police stafion last Friday
night while the Thomases were at the
show. No trace of it had been found
until 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon when
Lemuel C. Smith, '23, recognised the car
parked at the cast side of Encina Hall.
Smith notified Mr. Thomas and the Palo
Alto Police Department. Officer Evans
hurried to the place where the stolen car
was parked, and, discovering that the
gasoline tank was full, decided to wait
for the thief to return.
At 7 o'clock, Evans noticed a man ap
proach the car. look around for a few
minutes and finally unfasten the ,chain
on tin front wheel. As the man entered
the car, the officer jumped out of his
Chevrolet roadster, which he had parked
across the road, ran to the machine, and
slipped a pair of handcuffs about Bow
man's wrists.
According to Bowman's story, he and
Leroy Smith took the car last Friday
night and went to the city. Bowman, who
works in a Palo Alto garage, returned
Monday morning. Smith told him not
to park the car in Palo Alto, but on the
campus. Police believe that this was
done to place the blame on the students
if the car was found.
Bowman declared that lie was to meet
Smith in San Francisco last night, and
Officcr Evans, accompanied by Mr.
Thomas and Bowman, drove there last
night, hoping to find Smith. He was not
to be found, however, and the Police De
partment of San Francisco is on the
lookout for him.
The stolen car was slightly damaged.
The bumber was torn loose, a hub cap
mashed, and a rear axle sprung.
Authorities say that Bowman has
served eighteen months in a California
reform school for burglary. He is being
held in the Palo Alto jail.
