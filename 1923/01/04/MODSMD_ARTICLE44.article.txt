# Football Captains For 1923 Chosen by Five Universities
## 
### 
Five colleges and universities have
recently chosen their football captains
for 1923. Other selections are sure to
follow soon, but a number of institutions
are delaying in selecting leaders until
final examinations show what men are
lost to the different varsities for next
year. The teams which have already
elected captains are Cornell, Texas Agri
cultural and Mining College, University
|of Texas, Minnesota University, and
| University of Missouri.
The Cornell leader for 1923 is G. I\.
Pfann, '24, of Marion, Ohio, who has
piloted the Cornell team for two seasons
in every game from the quarterback po
sition. He has been ranked by Eastern
critics as one of the best backs of the
season. His versatility won him a first
place, with his backfield mate, kaw, on
the New York Times' All-Eastern se
lection.
D. Lane Tynes of Cooper, Texas, has
been chosen to captain the University of
Texas team for next year.
He played on the Texas freshman team
| in 1919, making a good record, and the
next year won a place on the varsity,
! where he has played ever since. Since
| he started playing before the three-year
rule went into effect, he will be allowed
four years of intercollegiate football.
Tynes' regular position has been full
[ back, but he has shown himself capable
of playing other backfield positions.
The 1923 Texas A. & M. football team
will be led by T. L. ("Silent") Miller.
Miller, although only 19 years old. has
played well since he won his place on the
varsity. His first game was last year
against Centre College in the January
post-season game. He has done most of
the punting for his team this year and
has developed into a strong offensive and
defensive man at the halfback position.
Clyde W. Smith, '25, of Sapulpa, Okla.,
has been named captain of the Univer
sity of Missouri's football team for 1923.
Smith played all season at center on the
Missouri team.
University of Minnesota football men
have elected Earl Martineau to captain
their 1923 team. Martineau played a
steady, consistent game at the halfback
position all season.
