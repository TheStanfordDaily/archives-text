duction in California during 1922 totaled
130,(XX),000 barrels, breaking all previous
records, according to figures made pub
lic today by the office of the state's oil

The great increase in production was
attributed to intensive drilling in the new
fields of Los Angeles and Orange coun
ties. The increase over 1921 production
was 24,000,000 barrels.
The new Los Angeles and Orange
county fields produced a total of 41,000,-
000 barrels, making up for the decrease
in production of some of the older dis
tricts.
Of the new fields, Huntington Beach
poured forth 11,500.000 barrels; Long
Bcacib, 18,000 barrels, and Santa Fe
Springs, 11,200,000 barrels.
Increased production brought about a
reduction in price last July, the announce
ment showed, but since then the price of
crude oil has been firm.
Consumption has been increased great
ly, it was declared, by shipments to the
Atlantic Coast via the canal, constituting
a new outlet for California petroleum.
