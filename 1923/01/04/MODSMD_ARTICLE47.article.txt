# COACHES DIFFER ON FOOTBALL SIGNAL CALLING METHODS
## 
### JACKSON V. SCHOLZ 
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.—There seems to
be a rather wide difference of opinion
among the football coaches of the coun
try concerning the "convention" system
of giving signals before the play starts.
This was brought out at the recent meet
ing of the Football Coaches' Associa
tion, where the makers of the sport from
all parts of the country had an oppor
tunity to discuss just such points.
The "convention" system consists in
gathering of the players behind the line
of scrimmage before each formation, in
which they form a tight group with their
heads together and the quarterback gives
the signals. Such a practice is claimed
by some to hold up the game while other
coaches claim that it speeds things up.
It would seem to depend upon how the
players were coached and whether the
"convention" was used as a pow wow or
merely to give the signals.
Major Cavanaugh of Boston College
and Robert Zuppke of Illinois took op
posite sides of the question at the meet
ing. Cavanaguh claimed that in his ex
perience of watching games where the
"ring around the rosie" system was used,
a great deal of time was wasted and the
spectators became impatient. Zuppke as
serted, on the other hand, that he had
timed this system as well as the old one
and had found that by actual seconds
the "convention" was a time saver.
Fielding Yost of Michigan, who is one
of the staunch backers of the new idea,
claimed that much more time was lost
by a team which called the signals on the
line of scrimmage because of the fact
that the signals quite often had to be
repeated and that after they were called
the players then had to shift to positions
called for in the signals.
