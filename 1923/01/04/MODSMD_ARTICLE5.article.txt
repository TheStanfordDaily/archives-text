# COLLAPSE OF KELSO BRIDGE CAUSES EIGHTY CASUALTIES
## 
### (By United Press 
KELSO, Wash., Jan. 4.â€”Authorities
in charge of rescue work today ex
pressed the belief that the dead as a
result of the collapse of the Kelso
bridge across the Cowlitz River here
last night may run as high as eighty.
All sources were of the opinion,
however, that It will be impossible to
establish definitely how many persons
lost their lives, owing to the impossi
bility of establishing the exact num
ber on the bridge when the cables
snapped and the great structure, with
its human freight, went lurching into
the turbulent, muddy river waters.
Witnesses agreed that the number
on the bridge must have been approxi
mately 150 and dome thought higher.
