# EXCITED ACTION AND WORRIED LOOKS MARK QUARTER’S OPENING
## 
### 
Considerable excited activity among
certain individuals on the campus has
■been noticed during the past two or three
days. Several persons have been seen
one purpose—to exchange silver, gold,
the Quad. Slips of papers have been car
ried from place to place where after
much serious conversation, signatures
have sometimes been added, sometimes
not. Worried looks and forced laughs
are very much in evidence, and classes
which last quarter were tilled to over
flowing are sadly emaciated at present.
The old year passes but student don't.
The faculty axe has fallen, and most
heavily on those who have been giving
the axe to California and Pittsburgh.
"Unhappy New Year!" say they all.
