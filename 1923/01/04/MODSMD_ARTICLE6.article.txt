# AUSTIN TO FILL FIFTH POSITION ON DAVIES’ TEAM
## Selection of Running Guard on 1920 Squad Completes Line-up for Opening Game. 
### 
Harry Austin, who played on "Fight
ing Bob" Evans' quintet, has been chosen
by Jimmy Davies as the fifth man among
the returning prodigals who will intro-

duce the present varsity to their 1923
season.
Austin is slated for running guard, the
position he held in 1920. He was on the
program for the same place in 1921, but
did not return to college, and Bob
Pelouze stepped into the hole.
This completes the line-up of veterans,


Bert Mills, one of the five veterans of
Walter Powell's aggregation who
will step out on a Stanford court
again Saturday. Mills will line up
at center, his old position.

The crutches brigade claimed its first
recruit last night. Rolland Hoffman,
forward and captain of the freshman five
last year, wrenched his weak knee in
scrimmage and was taken to the hos
pital, out for at least two weeks. The
same joint went bad on him about this
time last year, and kept him out of a lot
of Babe contests. However, Kerr is rich
in forwards, with two veterans, Mc-
Hose and Roberts, besides Austin, Sum
my, and Alexander of the '25 crew.
Instead of four letter men, Kerr will
have three new faces on his team when
the season opens Saturday. DeGroot and
Janssen will not be on the floor, as they
have not yet had enough practice passing
the melon to put them in trim Piggott,
who got into some of the finals last year,
is due to open at center, with Kolberg,
a transfer from Wisconsin, ready to re
lieve him. Fred Anderson is just about
picked for one guard, with Hooper,
Oliva, and Mcßurney candidates for the
other defense.
Saturday night's mele will be more in
the nature of a grand reunion than a
battle for blood. The squad that wal
loped California will try to be again the
fast, smooth running machine they were
as undergraduates, but they will have no
subs to relieve them, and most of the
quintet are in no sort of training. Ten
minute quarters have been scheduled in
stead of the usual twenty-minute halves,
to offset this, but if Kerr's team shows
any talent with the globule they ought
to be pretty close to topside of the score
at the finish.

Pelouze stepped into the hole.
This completes the line-up of veterans,


Bert Mills, one of the five veterans of
Walter Powell's aggregation who
will step out on a Stanford court
again Saturday. Mills will line up
at center, his old position.
which now reads:
Davies (captain) Forward
Righter Forward
Mills Center
Austin Running Guard
Adams Standing Guard
The crutches brigade claimed its first
recruit last night. Rolland Hoffman,
forward and captain of the freshman five
last year, wrenched his weak knee in
scrimmage and was taken to the hos
pital, out for at least two weeks. The
same joint went bad on him about this
time last year, and kept him out of a lot
of Babe contests. However, Kerr is rich
in forwards, with two veterans, Mc-
Hose and Roberts, besides Austin, Sum
my, and Alexander of the '25 crew.
Instead of four letter men, Kerr will
have three new faces on his team when
the season opens Saturday. DeGroot and
Janssen will not be on the floor, as they
have not yet had enough practice passing
the melon to put them in trim Piggott,
who got into some of the finals last year,
is due to open at center, with Kolberg,
a transfer from Wisconsin, ready to re
lieve him. Fred Anderson is just about
picked for one guard, with Hooper,
Oliva, and Mcßurney candidates for the
other defense.
Saturday night's mele will be more in
the nature of a grand reunion than a
battle for blood. The squad that wal
loped California will try to be again the
fast, smooth running machine they were
as undergraduates, but they will have no
subs to relieve them, and most of the
quintet are in no sort of training. Ten
minute quarters have been scheduled in
stead of the usual twenty-minute halves,
to offset this, but if Kerr's team shows
any talent with the globule they ought
to be pretty close to topside of the score
at the finish.
Harry Austin, who played on "Fight
ing Bob" Evans' quintet, has been chosen
by Jimmy Davies as the fifth man among
the returning prodigals who will intro-

duce the present varsity to their 1923
season.
Austin is slated for running guard, the
position he held in 1920. He was on the
program for the same place in 1921, but
did not return to college, and Bob
Pelouze stepped into the hole.
