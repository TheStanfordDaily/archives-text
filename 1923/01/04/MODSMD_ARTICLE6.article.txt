# AUSTIN TO FILL FIFTH POSITION ON DAVIES’ TEAM
## Selection of Running Guard on 1920 Squad Completes Line-up for Opening Game. 
### 
Harry Austin, who played on "Fight
ing Bob" Evans' quintet, has been chosen
by Jimmy Davies as the fifth man among
the returning prodigals who will intro-

duce the present varsity to their 1923
season.
Austin is slated for running guard, the
position he held in 1920. He was on the
program for the same place in 1921, but
did not return to college, and Bob
Pelouze stepped into the hole.
This completes the line-up of veterans,


Bert Mills, one of the five veterans of
Walter Powell's aggregation who
will step out on a Stanford court
again Saturday. Mills will line up
at center, his old position.
