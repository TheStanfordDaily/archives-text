# CHAPPIE TUNES UP HAMMER TO ISSUE ”MOURNFUL NUMBER”
## 
### 
The loud singing noise is the Old Boy
tuning up the Hammer for use in his
next issue—the "Mournful Number"—
for which he craves an exceeding large
amount of copy. It's a hard job for the
Ancient One to be mournful, but this'
number will help him get a lot of .favor
ite little kicks off on their Draw
ings, copy, all in great profusion, not to
say plenitude, are wanted, and the sooner
the more sudden. The dead line for all
contributions is January 15. Contribu
tions should be addressed to Chaparral,
Box 15, Stanford University. Contribu
tors should religiously avoid the "pro
vincial" joke—one that can be appreci
ated only by Stanford people. Copy and
drawings should be of a general appeal,
not limited to campus readers.
Judge's College Wits' Contest is al
ready under way, and that means that
Chappie is going to have a fight on its
hands. This year Stanford is going to
win that cup or know the reason why,
in spite of the fact that Cornell will be
out after it in earnest in order to bring
home a third win and permanent posses
sion of the cup. All copy and drawings
must be in Judge's office by the first of
March. Contributions intended for the
College Wits' Contest should be ad
dressed to the Chaparral as above, and
will be forwarded in a body to Judge.
Out with the old typewriter, sharpen
up the old funny-bone, and make the Old
Boy weep with joy
