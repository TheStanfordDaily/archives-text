# SENIORS MUST RETURN QUAD PROOFS AT ONCE
## 
### 
Seniors who had their Quad pictures
taken last quarter, and who have not yet
returned their proofs, arc requested by
Stone, at the Franklin Studio on the
Circle, to do so at once, in order to avoid
inaccuracies, and to get the picture that
j each individual likes the best in this
year's Quad. Stone will wait until Janu
i ary 10 to receive proofs, but after that
| date selections will have to be made im
j mediately without waiting longer for the
J individual's choice. The most important
reason for calling in the proofs at once
; is that inaccuracies in names arc likely
to result if each senior is not on hand to
check up the identity of the picture.
