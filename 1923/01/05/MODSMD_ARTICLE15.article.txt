## 
### 
The Stanford Chapter of Delta Chi
| fraternity has given to the Stanford Law
School Library a set of California Re
; ports and California Appellate Reports
| numbering 232 volumes and valued at
| about $600. This gift has been accepted
I by the Board of Trustees of the Univer-
I sity and will be placed on the shelves of
the Law School library, with a book plate
1 in each volume noting the fact that the
I collection is the gift of the Delta Chi
I fraternity.
Delta Chi was originally a legal fra
; ternity and recently changed its char
| acter to that of a general fraternity. The
chapter then, with the approval of its
| alumni, offered this collection to the Law
j School as an appropriate gift.
The reasons for the gift were set forth
j by the chapter itself in a letter to Acting
! Dean M. R. Kirkwood of the Law School
j in the following paragraph:
"Delta Chi has recently changed its
'character from that of a strictly legal
; fraternity to that of a general fraternity.
Inasmuch as the Stanford Chapter was
I founded by men who were primarily in
! terested in the study of law and who
j were deeply interested in the Law School,
| and inasmuch as the books above referred
to were originally acquired through the
efforts and for the use of men whose
study in the University was largely in
the Law School, the Stanford Chapter of
Delta Chi feels that the placing of these
books in the Law Library for the use of
the Law School Faculty would be a fit
j ting and permanent recognition of the
1 work of its founders.
