# FRESHMEN QUINTET TO MEET FREMONT
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
quintet meets the Fremont High
School five tomorrow night at 7 o'clock
in the Pavilion, in the preliminary to
the varsity game.
Tomorrow night's game will be the
first of the season for the 1926 team
and their strength is somewhat doubt
ful. They were beaten by the senior
team in the interclass series but have
been steadily improving in teamwork
and basket-shooting since their defeat.
They seemed to be unable to find the
basket in the interclass games but
Hunt is drilling the forwards daily and
they are having less, trouble locating
the lioop.
Hunt has a number of good men and
will probably use most of them some
time during the game. Ernie Nevers,
190-pound end and fullback on the
192G grid squad, is the star of the
team at his forward position. He is
big and fast and is the surest man on
the squad at shooting baskets. Perry
and Frank have also been doing well
at the forward jobs.
At center, there are two good men.
Morrison and Carter are both fast and
each is fairly sure on baskets. Carter
can be used at a forward position if
he is needed.
The defense will probably be the
strongest department of the team. At
running guard, Mitchell, who played
quarter on the babe eleven, Witten
burg, and McDermott, also of fresh
man football fame, are showing up
well. Kirwan and Frazer seem to be
the most likely candidates for the
standing guard jobs.
Hunt has been working the squad
hard all week, at basket shooting and
dribbling and has put them through
several lively scrimmages.
