# CARDINAL VARSITY PRIMED FOR OPENER WITH OLD-TIMERS
## Andy Kerr Plans to Use the Entire 1923 Squad Against the Former Coast Conference Champs 
### 
The doors of the basketball pavilion
open on the coming court season to
morrow night with the Stanford var

the untried varsity of 1923.

changed sides so often that it was
impossible to tell much except that a
Cardinal jersey seemed to make a
winner of all of them.
After tomorrow Stanford will move
from the Unknowns out among the
Possibilities, probably as a dangerous
threat to other conference teams'
hopes. So far, the squad is specializing

directions. One letter-man, Dud Do-
