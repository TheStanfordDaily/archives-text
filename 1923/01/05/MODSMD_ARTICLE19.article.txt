# CARDINAL VARSITY PRIMED FOR OPENER WITH OLD-TIMERS
## Andy Kerr Plans to Use the Entire 1923 Squad Against the Former Coast Conference Champs 
### 
The doors of the basketball pavilion
open on the coming court season to
morrow night with the Stanford var
sity of 1920 and 1921 drawn up against
the untried varsity of 1923.
The veteran quintet, Coast Confer
ence champions in '20' and '21, and who
credit a great deal of their success to
the enthusiastic student support dur
ing those years, propose to put on an

exhibition that will start the hoop sea
son off with a bang, and send the pres
ent Cards on another championship
trail.
"Swede" Righter, the oldest Stan
ford captain of the three on the squad,
will be in command of the veterans.
To start the Cardinal steam roller
to rolling, and get the cheers bouncing
around pavilion rafters, it is proposed
to make the exhibition tomorrow night
a yearly thing, a team of veterans
opening future schedules.
Kerr will use every man he has in
his plan of attack, more to spot the
best working combination than to
wear out the opposing five. "Give 'em
all a chance" is the motto he is going
by at present.
Twenty or more tossers were out on
the floor last night in their first eve
ning practice, and went through a
scrimmage fast enough for an ordin
ary scheduled game. The Red five
scored at just about two-minute inter
vals on the scrubs, but every player
changed sides so often that it was
impossible to tell much except that a
Cardinal jersey seemed to make a
winner of all of them.
After tomorrow Stanford will move
from the Unknowns out among the
Possibilities, probably as a dangerous
threat to other conference teams'
hopes. So far, the squad is specializing
in teamwork during practice and get
ting rid of preliminary faults, under
Kerr's constant fire of comment and
directions. One letter-man, Dud Do-
Groot, has yet to show up on the
floor, but whether he will have a
chance against the gang of fighters
now there is not anything to be
guessed at.
As always happens when ex-college
athletes compete with the current
specimens, it will be a case of experi
ence against condition. How much
condition the vets have to their credit
is uncertain, but they should have
enough to give Kerr's men a stiff run.
especially with two seasons together
back of them.
"Lefty" Rogers has his squad work
ing as smoothly as bread and butter,
and Coach Kerr has seen to it that the
lot of them are in the best shape pos
sible for beginning the season.
All line-up predictions to the con
trary, the chosen five have not been
picked and won't be, at least until just
before the whistle.
"I don't know myself who is going
to start that game," says Andy, "but
a line-up should contain all twenty.
They are all first-string players on
this squad, and every one will have
to hump some to keep his place once
he gets in." This means that no favor
ites are being played; also that there
will be a stream of substitutes coming
from the Stanford bench.
Ten-minute quarters instead of the
usual twenty-minute halves are
planned, to give Rigliter and his five a
chance to play the game at top speed
while they're in it.
Rufus Klawans, head of a sporting
goods store in San Francisco and an
enthusiastic basketball fan since his
playing days on an All-Eastern team,
has volunteered to referee the scrim
mage.
The veterans' line-up, against whom
Kerr nominates the entire Stanford
squad, is as follows: Righter, Davies,
forwards; Mills, center; Austin, run
ning guard; Adams, standing guard.
Play begins at 8 o'clock, preceded by
the Freshmen-Fremont high school con
test.

ting rid of preliminary faults, under
Kerr's constant fire of comment and
directions. One letter-man, Dud Do-
Groot, has yet to show up on the
floor, but whether he will have a
chance against the gang of fighters
now there is not anything to be
guessed at.
As always happens when ex-college
athletes compete with the current
specimens, it will be a case of experi

condition the vets have to their credit
is uncertain, but they should have
enough to give Kerr's men a stiff run.
especially with two seasons together
back of them.
"Lefty" Rogers has his squad work
ing as smoothly as bread and butter,
and Coach Kerr has seen to it that the
lot of them are in the best shape pos
sible for beginning the season.
All line-up predictions to the con
trary, the chosen five have not been
picked and won't be, at least until just
before the whistle.
"I don't know myself who is going
to start that game," says Andy, "but
a line-up should contain all twenty.
They are all first-string players on
this squad, and every one will have
to hump some to keep his place once
he gets in." This means that no favor
ites are being played; also that there
will be a stream of substitutes coming
from the Stanford bench.
Ten-minute quarters instead of the
usual twenty-minute halves are
planned, to give Rigliter and his five a
chance to play the game at top speed
while they're in it.
Rufus Klawans, head of a sporting
goods store in San Francisco and an
enthusiastic basketball fan since his
playing days on an All-Eastern team,
has volunteered to referee the scrim
mage.
The veterans' line-up, against whom
Kerr nominates the entire Stanford
squad, is as follows: Righter, Davies,
forwards; Mills, center; Austin, run
ning guard; Adams, standing guard.
Play begins at 8 o'clock, preceded by
the Freshmen-Fremont high school con
test.
The doors of the basketball pavilion
open on the coming court season to
morrow night with the Stanford var

the untried varsity of 1923.
The veteran quintet, Coast Confer
ence champions in '20' and '21, and who
credit a great deal of their success to
the enthusiastic student support dur
ing those years, propose to put on an

exhibition that will start the hoop sea
son off with a bang, and send the pres
ent Cards on another championship
trail.
"Swede" Righter, the oldest Stan
ford captain of the three on the squad,
will be in command of the veterans.
To start the Cardinal steam roller
to rolling, and get the cheers bouncing
around pavilion rafters, it is proposed
to make the exhibition tomorrow night
a yearly thing, a team of veterans
opening future schedules.
Kerr will use every man he has in
his plan of attack, more to spot the
best working combination than to
wear out the opposing five. "Give 'em
all a chance" is the motto he is going
by at present.
Twenty or more tossers were out on
the floor last night in their first eve
ning practice, and went through a
scrimmage fast enough for an ordin
ary scheduled game. The Red five
scored at just about two-minute inter
vals on the scrubs, but every player
changed sides so often that it was
impossible to tell much except that a
Cardinal jersey seemed to make a
winner of all of them.
