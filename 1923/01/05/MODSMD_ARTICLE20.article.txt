# CAPTAIN FALK IS BEST BET FOR ’23 TRACK PROSPECTS
## 
### William Wright, ’25 
"It's too early in the season —we
can't make a good guess as yet," said
Track Coach Dink Templeton when
sounded on the possibilities and proba
bilities of the 1923 track season. His
manner seemed to imply that the first
round between the Faculty pruning
hook and the Stanford serpentina bad
gone to the pruning-hook without seri
ous competition. Ten points is a liig
margin in a Big Meet, and ten ooints
is the least that Glenn Hartranft can
get. There is a possibility that the dis
aster may be averted, but it is a very,
very bare possibility. "Tiny" is prob
ably lost to the team. Next on the list
comes "Al" Smith, who is as good as
the best at the distances, but who
failed to demolish Political Science in
the best of style.
Crossing over to the assets, we have
Captain Falk, who took first place in
practically every hurdle event in
which he was entered last year, and
should have no trouble in repeating.
"Swede" Leistner, coming up from the
1925 freshmen, will bear the next
heaviest burden in the obstacle races,
and will bear it well. The outlook there
is bright. The quarter milers will in
clude Williamson and Judah, both of
whom placed in the last California
meet, as well as Shermund, last year's
freshman captain; they may be de
pended upon to do their share. Wil
liamson's record in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet in Boston last spring is an as
surance of Cardinal strength in that
department. Coverly, Wright, and
Schofield failed to place last year, but
will make a much stronger bid for
fame during the coming season.
The sprint supremacy, which has
recently been Stanford's by an over
whelming margin, is by no means so
positive this year. With Sudden, Kirk
sey, and Hartranft gone, the responsi
bility will rest upon Hale and Carrey,
neither of whom have so far survived
the acid test. A year's development
may work wonders, however, and
"dark horses" are Templeton's spe
cialty. The half mile is well off, with
Daly, last year's first place man, Mc
intosh, Moody and Dole to carry the
hopes of the Farm. Arthur, Ludeke,
and Lawson will do the honors in the
shot and discus, with Righetti and
Harlow taking Flint Hanner's place in
the javelin throw. "Bill" Black tied for
first place in the pole vault last year,
and is getting better all the time, with
Guy Dennis to keep him working at
top speed. The jumps will be handled
by Kemnitzer and Minsky, in the hori
zontal and vertical respectively, and
will receive capable attention through
out the season.
Elliott, who placed in the most re
cent Big Meet after only three weeks
of training, will tie back to do even
more, and will be supported in the
mile run by Childs and Murphy. The
team as a whole, while lacking in the
number of brilliant stars which char
acterized it last year, seems to be
fairly well balanced, and the chances
are that the usual quota of stars will
be developed as the season passes into
history.
Although on training at the present
moment, the squad will not go on strict
rules until a month before the Cali
fornia meet, which is scheduled to
take place on April 21. The minor
meets of the season are still pretty
hazy, but the schedule will shortly be
completed and released. The usual pre
season interclass meet will be run off
a week from tomorrow, followed by
the preliminary season lasting until
the week before the Big Meet, which
is to be held in the Stanford Stadium.

whelming margin, is by no means so
positive this year. With Sudden, Kirk
sey, and Hartranft gone, the responsi
bility will rest upon Hale and Carrey,
neither of whom have so far survived
the acid test. A year's development
may work wonders, however, and
"dark horses" are Templeton's spe
cialty. The half mile is well off, with
Daly, last year's first place man, Mc
intosh, Moody and Dole to carry the
hopes of the Farm. Arthur, Ludeke,
and Lawson will do the honors in the
shot and discus, with Righetti and
Harlow taking Flint Hanner's place in
the javelin throw. "Bill" Black tied for
first place in the pole vault last year,
and is getting better all the time, with
Guy Dennis to keep him working at
top speed. The jumps will be handled
by Kemnitzer and Minsky, in the hori
zontal and vertical respectively, and
will receive capable attention through
out the season.
Elliott, who placed in the most re
cent Big Meet after only three weeks
of training, will tie back to do even
more, and will be supported in the
mile run by Childs and Murphy. The
team as a whole, while lacking in the
number of brilliant stars which char
acterized it last year, seems to be
fairly well balanced, and the chances
are that the usual quota of stars will
be developed as the season passes into
history.
Although on training at the present
moment, the squad will not go on strict
rules until a month before the Cali
fornia meet, which is scheduled to
take place on April 21. The minor
meets of the season are still pretty
hazy, but the schedule will shortly be
completed and released. The usual pre
season interclass meet will be run off
a week from tomorrow, followed by
the preliminary season lasting until
the week before the Big Meet, which
is to be held in the Stanford Stadium.
"It's too early in the season —we
can't make a good guess as yet," said
Track Coach Dink Templeton when
sounded on the possibilities and proba
bilities of the 1923 track season. His
manner seemed to imply that the first
round between the Faculty pruning
hook and the Stanford serpentina bad
gone to the pruning-hook without seri
ous competition. Ten points is a liig
margin in a Big Meet, and ten ooints
is the least that Glenn Hartranft can
get. There is a possibility that the dis
aster may be averted, but it is a very,
very bare possibility. "Tiny" is prob
ably lost to the team. Next on the list
comes "Al" Smith, who is as good as
the best at the distances, but who
failed to demolish Political Science in
the best of style.
Crossing over to the assets, we have
Captain Falk, who took first place in
practically every hurdle event in
which he was entered last year, and
should have no trouble in repeating.
"Swede" Leistner, coming up from the
1925 freshmen, will bear the next
heaviest burden in the obstacle races,
and will bear it well. The outlook there
is bright. The quarter milers will in
clude Williamson and Judah, both of
whom placed in the last California
meet, as well as Shermund, last year's
freshman captain; they may be de
pended upon to do their share. Wil
liamson's record in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet in Boston last spring is an as
surance of Cardinal strength in that
department. Coverly, Wright, and
Schofield failed to place last year, but
will make a much stronger bid for
fame during the coming season.
