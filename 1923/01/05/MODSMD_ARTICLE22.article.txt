# "A WORD TO THE WISE IS SUFFICIENT"

### 
The promptness with which styles of dancing
were changed on the Campus following the recent
dropping of gentle hints by certain student agencies
only shows that our previous conclusion that Stan
lord students have the best of intentions is correct.
Under ordinary circumstances in ordinary univer
sities such measures as were taken to correct an
undesirable condition would have done more harm
than good. Somehow, Stanford is different. There
may be the malicious few and the careless many,
but underneath the mask of undergraduate indiffer
ence there is that distinctive, matured element that
characterizes Stanford men and women. Dancing
will go on as a student social function as before,
furnishing probably as much "kick" under existing
circumstances as the more extreme styles were pur
ported to afford. Those who claimed to know noth
ing but the "Chicago Walk" have adapted themselves
o the simpler steps with what appears to be amazing
ease. At any rate their general attitude shows good
taste and proves that a helpful spirit of co-operation
exists. If this attitude is made to extend to other
.fields which come under student government, under
graduate affairs at Stanford will have a long and
pleasant future. Here's a Wright Act toast to the
Men's and Women's Council and to those students
who have so ably supported their measures.
