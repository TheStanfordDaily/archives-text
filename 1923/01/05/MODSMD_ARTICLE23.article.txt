If the twenty men and five women who comprise
the membership of the recently appointed commit
tee to sponsor co-operation in student control and to
guide student opinion in Campus affairs function
properly in the first year, they will have made an im
portant step toward the improvement of local admin
istrative conditions. Without constant attention and
unceasing effort on the part of a few of those deeply
interested in undergraduate activity and in student
government at Stanford, the present system will soon
prove itself to be a failure. While this is not demo
cracy in the strictest sense of the word, it approaches
it as nearly as possible, all things considered. An
ideal government at Stanford would necessitate the
understanding and complete co-opeartion of fully
ninety-eight per cent of the undergraduate body. At
present, there is some doubt as to whether that pro
portion even knows that we have student govern
ment. Hence, in the absence of the ideal condition,
it is necessary to make the best of such opportuni
ties as are offered for improvement. The newly
appointed co-operative committee has a fair chance
to do a great deal of good work and if its members
are interested in Stanford and Stanford's welfare
they cannot spend too much time in the study and
solution of undergraduate problems.
