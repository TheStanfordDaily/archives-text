# STANFORD'S LOSS
## 
### 
W. D. Fletcher's announcement that he will not be
available for reappointment as Graduate Manager of
Stanford proves again that it's a hard task to keep a
ten-thousand dollar man in a three-thousand dollar
job. To be manager of a university doesn't sound
very big, but when all the details are known, people
wonder why it is that a man can be kept for more
than one year. Fletcher has been on the job for
two years and has brought the Board of Athletic
Control his salary many times over by means of his
keen business judgment and by the introduction of
saving devices and new policies. He cannot be re
placed. Every Stanford student regrets that a
change must come but is willing to place his confi
dence in the Board of Control, in whose hands the
nature of the necessary substitution rests. Thg stu
dent body awaits with interest the Board's next move.
