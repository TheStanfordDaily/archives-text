"Fires are eminently persona 11011 grata," said Master
of Holocausts Wham in an address delivered before the
Browning Society yesterday at midnight. "Rubbish,
oil-soaked waste, and waste paper, besides detracting
from the beauty of one's drawing-room, are a flaming
menace and offer an almost irresistible allure to the
fire microbe. Individuals tempting Providence by suf
fering such deplorable conditions to prevail should be
straightway ostracized and reduced to the level of social
pariahs. Dese kids in de frat houses don't know deir
groceries," concluded the Master of Holocausts in his
concise way.

That if all the answers to all the examination ques
tions asked last quarier were published in text-book
form, the world's history, economics, law, and engineer
ing would become greatly muddled?
That '27 is certainly an odd number.

That if all the macaroni manufactured in the world
were strung together end to end it would make a pipe
line from the Walker distillery in Canada to the
Administration building?

"Fires are eminently persona 11011 grata," said Master
of Holocausts Wham in an address delivered before the
Browning Society yesterday at midnight. "Rubbish,
