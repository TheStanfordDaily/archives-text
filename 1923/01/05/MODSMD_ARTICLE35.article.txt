# FIVE FENCING MEETS ON AMATEUR LEAGUE PROGRAM FOR WINTER
## 
### 
Several fencing meets have already
been arranged for the winter quarter
by the Pacific Coast Division of the
Amateur Fencers' League of America.
These meets, like those of the fall
quarter, are part of a Series of indi
vidual cumulative competitive contests
to decide the league fencing cham
pions in each of the three classes of
fencers. Final scores will be based on
the records made in all of these meets,
those held in the winter and spring
quarters as well as those completed
during the fall quarter.
The coming matches are as follows:
Olympic Club, January 22; California,
February 5; Stanford, February 18;
Unione Sportiva Italiana, March 5; and
Olympic Club, March 19. The clubs
which will send men to the meets are:
Olympic Club, California, Stanford,
Unione Sportiva Italiana, and possibly
the San Francisco Gym Club and the
Army and Navy Club.
The intercollegiate meet with Cali
fornia will be held on March 1 at
Stanford in Encina Gymnasium. Im
mediately following the meet at the
Olympic Club in San Francisco on
March 19, the fencing team will leave
for Los Angeles where a meet with
the Los Angeles Athletic Club will be
held. Arrangements for this trip have
definitely been made.
At the beginning of the spring quar
ter on April 9, the fencing team will
participate in the team championship
matches of the Amateur Fencers'
League of America held at the Unione
Sportiva Italiana Club. Each of the
league members will enter a team of
three men who will compete for team
honors. The winning team will be pre-!
sented with a cup.
The individual championship match
es of the Pacific Coast Division of the
Amateur Fencers' League of America
will be held at. the Olympic Club on
April 16. Medals will be given to the
winners, and those placing second and
third, in each of the three classes of
fencers in the league.
Ratings of the individual fencers
will be made following the results of
this meet. They will be based on the
total records of the performances of
the fencers compiled from all the
matches engaged in during the whole
year.
At present the Stanford team has I
proven itself only mediocre in match
scores but shows a large point score
due to the fact that many of the
matches lost were dropped by only a
single po'nt. With the beginning of
the winter quarter and the resump
tion of practice the team is expected
to show better form.
