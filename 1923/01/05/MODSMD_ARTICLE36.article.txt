## 
### 
'The Esthcmian people are showing a
splendid spirit of courage," said Mrs.
Olive Gordon Miller, formerly Y.W.C.A.
secretary in Esthonia, speaking before
the local association yesterday. "They
have suffered revolution and hardships,
but they are not complaining."
Mrs. Miller briefly sketched the his
tory of the Esthonians who have been
under the domination of the Russians
and Germans for 700 years. In 1917
Esthonia declared its independence, but
the Bolshevists soon conquered the coun
try. Then came a period of alternate
Bolshevist and German control, but in
1919 Esthonia finally became independent.
The result of centuries of serfdom, how
ever, is that the Esthonians have an in
tense hatred for both Russians and Ger
mans.
Esthonia, according to Mrs. Miller, is
trying hard to become an independent,
individual state. However, most of the
people are not educated, and the Estho
nians have no written language. A uni
versity has been established and 3000 stu
dents have been enrolled.
