"I wish that this party could come be
fore the registration day for my first
meeting with you is so brief and business
like." said Miss Yost in welcoming the
new women at the conference party last
night. She told the entering women not
to take their studies either too lightly
or too seriously, but to give them care
ful work. Miss Yost also said a few
words about organized women.
Miss Bunting, head of the women's
gymnasium department, emphasized the
fact that the work in that department is
meant to give the students both pleasure
and benefit.
What women can do in activities was
the theme of Frances Willis, who rep
resented the graduate women. "There is
a place for every one of you if you will
only try to find it and will not be dis
couraged by failure at first."
Since Margaret White '23, president
of Organized Women, was unable to at
tend, Alice Roth '24. secretary of Wom
en's Council, presided. After the talks
there was a whistling solo by Eunice
Jiiddle '24. and a song by George Smith.
The program was followed by dancing.
