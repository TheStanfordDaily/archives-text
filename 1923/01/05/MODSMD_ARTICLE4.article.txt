### (By United Press 
GAINESVILLE, Fla., Jan. sâ€”Fresh
outbreaks were feared today as a re
sult of a race riot at Rosewood last
night, in which six persons were killed
and a score injured.
Practically the entire white popula
tion of Cedar Key, heavily armed, was
reported marching on Rosewood in
retaliation for last night's killings and
further serious trouble was anticipated
by officials.
The disturbance was the outgrowth
of an assault on a young white woman
by a negro at Sumner. One black was
lynched by a mob at Sumner after he
confessed to aiding the guilty one to
escape.
