# AMERICAN WOMEN SELL OUT BEAUTY TO STYLE MONGERS
## 
### (By United Press 
CHICAGO, Jan. s.â€”American women
are selling out their beauty to the style
mongers. Dressing to the dictates of
fashion is ruining the feminine figure.
Charming busts are giving way to un
dulating hips, and the Venus woman has
become the faddist femme. This was
the substance of an interview today with
Ralph Moni, instructor in women's dress
designing at the Chicago Academy of
Fine Arts.
"The American woman has fallen prey
to the French dressmaker and is sacrific
ing her beauty to the fads and foibles of
fashion," declared Moni, who teaches that
dressing is an art, and each woman a
canvas to be made or marred by the
right strokes of design.
