"He Who Gets Slapped," translated
from the Russian by Gregory Zilboorg,
is better adapted to stage production than
any of Andreyev's previous works, ac
cording to Director Bentinck. Andreyev's
rather grim philosophy of life, sardonic
and even contemptuous, is presented in
"He" with great dramatic force.
The first regular production of "He"
in English was by the Theater Guild of
New York City on January 9, 1922, at the
Garrick Theater. Although this produc
tion was very successful financially, it
was branded by critics as a "sugar
coated, saccharined-dosed, slushily senti
mentalized version of the original."
"He's appearance at Stanford will be
its first showing on the Pacific Coast.
It is considered a rather ambitious pro
duction for amateurs, but it is Bentinck's
intention to give a truthful, artistic ver
sion. According to Bentinck, amateurs
find it no harder to present a good play
than a poor theatrical contraption, while
a truly good play acted with the spon
taneity and freshness that are the par
ticular attributes of amateurs will, he de
clares, invariably please audiences far
better than an amateur production of
some superficially brilliant Broadway
show which must depend on polished act
ing technique for its success.
Cast members will meet in the Assem
bly hall this evening at 7 o'clock for the
initial reading of the play, Bentinck an
nounces.
