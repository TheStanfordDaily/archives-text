# PROFESSOR COOPER DESCRIBES GERMAN LIVING CONDITIONS
## 
### 
War conditions still prevail in Ger
many, according to Professor W. A.
Cooper of the German department, who
has just returned from a seven months'
trip into Holland, Germany and Switzer
land.
"While there I witnessed the collapse
of German finance," Professor Cooper
said in an interview this morning. "Or
dinary capital is virtually gone and in
come is worthless. An income which
before the war would yield a comfort
able living is now insufficient to furnish
the bare necessities of life." Pie told of
the widow of a university professor
whose husband had left her an income of
2000 marks; this is enough to buy one
and one-fourth pounds of butter at pres
ent prices.
An attempt to pay the reparations with
paper marks and the continued printing
of more billions of marks arc the causes
of the financial straits of the German
nation, Professor Cooper believes.
Prices, although skyrocketing all the
time have not yet caught up with the de
valuation of the mark. Real estate docs
not yield sufficient income to pay for re
pairs; and people cannot afford to travel
for ordinary purposes.
"The railroads and other public utili
ties are run at a great loss to the national
government. The army of occupation is
a constant and heavy drain on the finances
of the state; I knew of one French gen
eral at Dusseldorf who received a larger
salary than the combined incomes of the
president and entire cabinet of Germany.
"Travelers who live in the best hotels
and eat at the first-class restaurants, come
out of Germany with no conception of
the living conditions of the people," Pro
fessor Cooper said. He described the in
tense suffering of even the middle class
of the populace; no one can afford to
heat more than one room and the food
is scarce and of poor nutritive value.
Milk and eggs can't be bought on the
market and meat and other essentials are
out of the question because of prohibitive
prices.
Professor Cooper left for Holland last
June where lie spent five days before
going into the industrial region of Dussel
dorf. He visited noted Schiller and
Goethe scholars in Bonn, Frankfort, Stutt
gart, Weimar, and Heidelberg. While at
the latter place he witnessed the illumi
nation of the castle ruins—one of the
most famous sights of Germany. The
old castle on the mountain is flooded with
red light at night, furnishing a rarely
beautiful spectacle which was staged in
honor of Swiss students at the univer
sity. Professor Cooper was forced to
cut short his stay in Frankfort to avoid
a threatened Communist demonstration.
While in Germany he secured consider
able material for the Hoover War Col
lection. He spent three months at Wei
mar working on a paper on Goethe which
he read before the Modern Language
Association in Chicago while on his way
home. Professor Cooper also visited in
Munich, Jena and Nuremberg and saw
the Passion Play at Oberammergau.
When concluding an account of his trav
els he said:
"And when I sailed for home I was
never more glad to leave any place as
to leave Germany." Which is a suf
ficient commentary on conditions in that
country.

salary than the combined incomes of the
president and entire cabinet of Germany.
"Travelers who live in the best hotels
and eat at the first-class restaurants, come
out of Germany with no conception of
the living conditions of the people," Pro
fessor Cooper said. He described the in
tense suffering of even the middle class
of the populace; no one can afford to
heat more than one room and the food
is scarce and of poor nutritive value.
Milk and eggs can't be bought on the
market and meat and other essentials are
out of the question because of prohibitive
prices.
Professor Cooper left for Holland last
June where lie spent five days before
going into the industrial region of Dussel
dorf. He visited noted Schiller and
Goethe scholars in Bonn, Frankfort, Stutt
gart, Weimar, and Heidelberg. While at
the latter place he witnessed the illumi
nation of the castle ruins—one of the
most famous sights of Germany. The
old castle on the mountain is flooded with
red light at night, furnishing a rarely
beautiful spectacle which was staged in
honor of Swiss students at the univer
sity. Professor Cooper was forced to
cut short his stay in Frankfort to avoid
a threatened Communist demonstration.
While in Germany he secured consider
able material for the Hoover War Col
lection. He spent three months at Wei
mar working on a paper on Goethe which
he read before the Modern Language
Association in Chicago while on his way
home. Professor Cooper also visited in
Munich, Jena and Nuremberg and saw
the Passion Play at Oberammergau.
When concluding an account of his trav
els he said:
"And when I sailed for home I was
never more glad to leave any place as
to leave Germany." Which is a suf
ficient commentary on conditions in that
country.
War conditions still prevail in Ger
many, according to Professor W. A.
Cooper of the German department, who
has just returned from a seven months'
trip into Holland, Germany and Switzer
land.
"While there I witnessed the collapse
of German finance," Professor Cooper
said in an interview this morning. "Or
dinary capital is virtually gone and in
come is worthless. An income which
before the war would yield a comfort
able living is now insufficient to furnish
the bare necessities of life." Pie told of
the widow of a university professor
whose husband had left her an income of
2000 marks; this is enough to buy one
and one-fourth pounds of butter at pres
ent prices.
An attempt to pay the reparations with
paper marks and the continued printing
of more billions of marks arc the causes
of the financial straits of the German
nation, Professor Cooper believes.
Prices, although skyrocketing all the
time have not yet caught up with the de
valuation of the mark. Real estate docs
not yield sufficient income to pay for re
pairs; and people cannot afford to travel
for ordinary purposes.
"The railroads and other public utili
ties are run at a great loss to the national
government. The army of occupation is
a constant and heavy drain on the finances
of the state; I knew of one French gen
eral at Dusseldorf who received a larger
salary than the combined incomes of the
president and entire cabinet of Germany.
