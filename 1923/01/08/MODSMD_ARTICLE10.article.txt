# FORMER COACH IMPROVES
## 
### 
James F. Lanagan, former Stanford
coach, and prominent San Francisco
attorney, who has been confined in a
sanitarium at Monrovia, is improving
rapidly, according to information given
out by George Presley, one of his
closest friends. Although Lanagan's
condition was never very serious, it
might have been so if he had neglected
it for any length of time.
