# RIGHTER AND MATES TAKE CONTEST FROM 1923 VARSITY FIVE
## Spurt At Beginning of the Fourth Quarter Wins For Veterans; Final Score, 23-19 
### Phil Newill 
A close-up of the Stanford varsity, after their first appearance on the floor
against "Swede" Righter's seasoned veterans last Saturday, reveals the
following facts which should prove interesting to any other Conference teams
who have championship hopes:
A team of scrappers who hit hard and fight every minute;
Fast, smooth-running team-work with no individual stars to do all the work;
A five-man defense perfected, and a five-man offense lacking nothing but a
little practice in basket-shooting, and a little more speed on the starting rush;
Plenty of able subs, many of whom have a good chance to beat the veterans
out of their places; ' ,
A lack of weight, which necessitates some fast work and sure passing.
That is the prospect for the 1923 season 011 the court, seen after the story
of weight and experience against condition and 110 playing experience had

been told, and the last installment
read: Experience, 23; Condition, 19.
A family reunion couldn't have been
any more joyous than the return of the
five athletes who made Stanford bas-
I ketball history. Led by Captain
"Swede" Righter, the team of 1920
and 1921—Fred Adams, Harry Austin,
Bert Mills, Jimmy Davies—went out
onto the floor determined to have the
times of their lives. They kept the
smiles on their faces straight through
I the game, though they lost most of
their breath.
Andy Kerr's plan of attack showed
itself right from the start. It was the
passing game, with no headlong un
organized rushes down the floor only
to have the ball intercepted. Several ;
times in the first minutes the Cards J
waited too long before starting the
rush, probably to draw the alumni
j down the floor. That didn't work with 1
veterans, though. The old-timers sim
ply stood around and rested up. The
five-man offensive, in which any four
! men are able to work under the oppo
j site basket, got the ball down among
the oldsters' defenses plenty of times ;
in the first of the ten-minute quarter,
and put the Redsliirts in the lead, 6-4.
"Jimmy" Austin, who played against
Brother Harry at forward, was the sur
prise of the game. In the first quarter
Austin shot two from the side of the
court, after breaking through the
strong defenses of the '21 five. A score
by Bert Mills, and two fouls apiece
gave the Cardinals the topside tally.
Wind and stiffened muscles started
to take their toll in the second quar
ter, but to make up for this the varsity
of two years ago began to find the
hoop again. The Davies-Righter com
bination got back into form, and made
six points. If Stanford had been a little
surer on their shots they would have
run up many more than the four they
tallied, for they had the panting alum-1
ni on the run and played the ball on
j the other end of the court most of,
the time. Jimmy Austin again drew
j first blood with a long throw through j
the hoop, and "Lanky" Piggott slipped
in the other out of a snarl of players
fighting for the ball under the basket.
The alumni got a second wind with
I the opening of the half, and rushed
things, Mills shot a short basket, and
Righter followed with a neat throw.
Fred Anderson, Cardinal running
guard, took the ball down the court
with a fast dribble immediately after
this, and looped a perfect basket be
fore Freddy Adams, standing guard
of tire whiteshirts, could get near him.
Anderson was one of the three vet
erans of last year's season who got
into the game Saturday. Janssen went
in for Piggott in the second and third
quarters, and "Lefty" Rogers played
thfoughout the contest, sometimes al
ternating with Oliva at standing guard.
Oliva came through with two points
during his stay at the offense end. At
the close of the third period "Swede"
and his gang had taken a one-point
lead on two baskets and two fouls,
17-16.
The long shots that used to win
games for the Cardinal three years ago
were seen in the fl%al ten-minute ses-'
sion. Mills shot one, then Righter
threw the ball from almost the center
of the court, giving his team a mort
gage on the lead. The Cards then came
back with a rush, and put up a whirl
wind battle for the last three minutes.
But the old-timers fought them off, and
the varsity was only able to put one
more through the hoop. The way the
Cards speeded up at the last of play
is going to be a threat to teams that
tangle with them for the rest of the
season, when the Cards have worn off
the rough edges.

The long shots that used to win
games for the Cardinal three years ago
were seen in the fl%al ten-minute ses-'
sion. Mills shot one, then Righter
threw the ball from almost the center
of the court, giving his team a mort
gage on the lead. The Cards then came
back with a rush, and put up a whirl
wind battle for the last three minutes.
But the old-timers fought them off, and
the varsity was only able to put one
more through the hoop. The way the
Cards speeded up at the last of play
is going to be a threat to teams that
tangle with them for the rest of the

A close-up of the Stanford varsity, after their first appearance on the floor
against "Swede" Righter's seasoned veterans last Saturday, reveals the
following facts which should prove interesting to any other Conference teams
who have championship hopes:
A team of scrappers who hit hard and fight every minute;
Fast, smooth-running team-work with no individual stars to do all the work;
A five-man defense perfected, and a five-man offense lacking nothing but a
little practice in basket-shooting, and a little more speed on the starting rush;
Plenty of able subs, many of whom have a good chance to beat the veterans
out of their places; ' ,
A lack of weight, which necessitates some fast work and sure passing.
That is the prospect for the 1923 season 011 the court, seen after the story
of weight and experience against condition and 110 playing experience had

been told, and the last installment
read: Experience, 23; Condition, 19.
A family reunion couldn't have been
any more joyous than the return of the
five athletes who made Stanford bas-
I ketball history. Led by Captain
"Swede" Righter, the team of 1920
and 1921—Fred Adams, Harry Austin,
Bert Mills, Jimmy Davies—went out
onto the floor determined to have the
times of their lives. They kept the
smiles on their faces straight through
I the game, though they lost most of
their breath.
Andy Kerr's plan of attack showed
itself right from the start. It was the
passing game, with no headlong un
organized rushes down the floor only
to have the ball intercepted. Several ;
times in the first minutes the Cards J
waited too long before starting the
rush, probably to draw the alumni
j down the floor. That didn't work with 1
veterans, though. The old-timers sim
ply stood around and rested up. The
five-man offensive, in which any four
! men are able to work under the oppo
j site basket, got the ball down among
the oldsters' defenses plenty of times ;
in the first of the ten-minute quarter,
and put the Redsliirts in the lead, 6-4.
"Jimmy" Austin, who played against
Brother Harry at forward, was the sur
prise of the game. In the first quarter
Austin shot two from the side of the
court, after breaking through the
strong defenses of the '21 five. A score
by Bert Mills, and two fouls apiece
gave the Cardinals the topside tally.
Wind and stiffened muscles started
to take their toll in the second quar
ter, but to make up for this the varsity
of two years ago began to find the
hoop again. The Davies-Righter com
bination got back into form, and made
six points. If Stanford had been a little
surer on their shots they would have
run up many more than the four they
tallied, for they had the panting alum-1
ni on the run and played the ball on
j the other end of the court most of,
the time. Jimmy Austin again drew
j first blood with a long throw through j
the hoop, and "Lanky" Piggott slipped
in the other out of a snarl of players
fighting for the ball under the basket.
The alumni got a second wind with
I the opening of the half, and rushed
things, Mills shot a short basket, and
Righter followed with a neat throw.
Fred Anderson, Cardinal running
guard, took the ball down the court
with a fast dribble immediately after
this, and looped a perfect basket be
fore Freddy Adams, standing guard
of tire whiteshirts, could get near him.
Anderson was one of the three vet
erans of last year's season who got
into the game Saturday. Janssen went
in for Piggott in the second and third
quarters, and "Lefty" Rogers played
thfoughout the contest, sometimes al
ternating with Oliva at standing guard.
Oliva came through with two points
during his stay at the offense end. At
the close of the third period "Swede"
and his gang had taken a one-point
lead on two baskets and two fouls,
17-16.

six points. If Stanford had been a little
surer on their shots they would have
run up many more than the four they
tallied, for they had the panting alum-1
ni on the run and played the ball on
j the other end of the court most of,
the time. Jimmy Austin again drew
j first blood with a long throw through j
the hoop, and "Lanky" Piggott slipped
in the other out of a snarl of players
fighting for the ball under the basket.
The alumni got a second wind with
I the opening of the half, and rushed
things, Mills shot a short basket, and
Righter followed with a neat throw.
Fred Anderson, Cardinal running
guard, took the ball down the court
with a fast dribble immediately after
this, and looped a perfect basket be
fore Freddy Adams, standing guard
of tire whiteshirts, could get near him.
Anderson was one of the three vet
erans of last year's season who got
into the game Saturday. Janssen went
in for Piggott in the second and third
quarters, and "Lefty" Rogers played
thfoughout the contest, sometimes al
ternating with Oliva at standing guard.
Oliva came through with two points
during his stay at the offense end. At
the close of the third period "Swede"
and his gang had taken a one-point
lead on two baskets and two fouls,
17-16.
The long shots that used to win
games for the Cardinal three years ago
were seen in the fl%al ten-minute ses-'
sion. Mills shot one, then Righter
threw the ball from almost the center
of the court, giving his team a mort
gage on the lead. The Cards then came
back with a rush, and put up a whirl
wind battle for the last three minutes.
But the old-timers fought them off, and
the varsity was only able to put one
more through the hoop. The way the
Cards speeded up at the last of play
is going to be a threat to teams that
tangle with them for the rest of the
season, when the Cards have worn off
the rough edges.

A close-up of the Stanford varsity, after their first appearance on the floor
against "Swede" Righter's seasoned veterans last Saturday, reveals the
following facts which should prove interesting to any other Conference teams
who have championship hopes:
A team of scrappers who hit hard and fight every minute;
Fast, smooth-running team-work with no individual stars to do all the work;
A five-man defense perfected, and a five-man offense lacking nothing but a
little practice in basket-shooting, and a little more speed on the starting rush;
Plenty of able subs, many of whom have a good chance to beat the veterans
out of their places; ' ,
A lack of weight, which necessitates some fast work and sure passing.
That is the prospect for the 1923 season 011 the court, seen after the story
of weight and experience against condition and 110 playing experience had

been told, and the last installment
read: Experience, 23; Condition, 19.
A family reunion couldn't have been
any more joyous than the return of the
five athletes who made Stanford bas-
I ketball history. Led by Captain
"Swede" Righter, the team of 1920
and 1921—Fred Adams, Harry Austin,
Bert Mills, Jimmy Davies—went out
onto the floor determined to have the
times of their lives. They kept the
smiles on their faces straight through
I the game, though they lost most of
their breath.
Andy Kerr's plan of attack showed
itself right from the start. It was the
passing game, with no headlong un
organized rushes down the floor only
to have the ball intercepted. Several ;
times in the first minutes the Cards J
waited too long before starting the
rush, probably to draw the alumni
j down the floor. That didn't work with 1
veterans, though. The old-timers sim
ply stood around and rested up. The
five-man offensive, in which any four
! men are able to work under the oppo
j site basket, got the ball down among
the oldsters' defenses plenty of times ;
in the first of the ten-minute quarter,
and put the Redsliirts in the lead, 6-4.
"Jimmy" Austin, who played against
Brother Harry at forward, was the sur
prise of the game. In the first quarter
Austin shot two from the side of the
court, after breaking through the
strong defenses of the '21 five. A score
by Bert Mills, and two fouls apiece
gave the Cardinals the topside tally.
Wind and stiffened muscles started
to take their toll in the second quar
ter, but to make up for this the varsity
of two years ago began to find the
hoop again. The Davies-Righter com
bination got back into form, and made
six points. If Stanford had been a little
surer on their shots they would have
run up many more than the four they
tallied, for they had the panting alum-1
ni on the run and played the ball on
