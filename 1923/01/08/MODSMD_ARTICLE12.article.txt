# STANFORD BAND IS IN NEED OF CORNETISTS
## 
### 
Two solo cornetists are badly needed by
the Stanford Band, according to Lowell
Berry, manager of the organization.
There are also places in the band for
saxophones, altos, and clarinets.
The band will hereafter take one hour
a week for practice in marching under
the direction of an officer in the military
department, in order that the band will
be trained to put 011 some special stunts
at the Big Game next year. This will
take the place of physical education and
will not be compulsory.
Plans are now under consideration to
form the band into a club, copying the or
ganization of the Stanford Glee Club.
Music possessed by the Stanford band
has recently been catalogued. It was
found that the organization has over 500
classical pieces and 300 marches, accord
ing to Berry this is one of the largest
and best collections of band music in the
country.
