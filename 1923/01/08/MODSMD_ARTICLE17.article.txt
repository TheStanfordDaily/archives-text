## 
### 
The 1926 court quintet, coached by
| "Husky" Hunt, made its first appcarance
j of the'season Saturday night in the pa
vilion and nosed out the fast Fremont
: High School five by a score of 19-14 in
the last few minutes of the game.
The babes were slow in getting under
1 way. At the end of the first quarter of
| Play, tfte high school lads .were on the
long end of a 5-0 score as the result of
field goals by Johnson and Berger and a
free throw by tffe latter. The freshmen
; couldn't seem to locate the basket the
j few times they got open shots. With
| the beginning of the second quarter, the
j Fremont boys made a series of personal
1 fouls, and Peery converted three of them
into points. Junta, high school center,
, made a field goal under the basket and
the score stood 7-3. A few seconds later,
Frazier made the babes first fi?ld goal.
| Peery and Morrison tied the count with
;a free throw each and the half ended
with the score at 7-7.
Ernie Nevers, who had been playing
the entire floor and breaking up the high
j school team work started the sec
ond half by dropping in a pretty one
I from the*side of the court. Westphal
came back with another good shot and
the score was again tied at 9-.9 Two
free throws for each team still left the
score tied. As the quarter ended, Mor
rison sunk one from under the goal and
the babes were ahead 13-11.
The high school team took the lead for
the last time shortly after the final period
began. A field goal and a free one by
Junta gave them a one-point advantage.
Morrison once more knotted the count
with a free throw. At this point, Frazier,
who had been playing a good defensive
i game, went wold. In quick succession,
he dropped in two pretty field goals and
,a free one and the high school team was
beaten.
The babes look to be a strong defensive
aggregation and should develop into a
well-balanced team as soon as the for
wards begin to find the basket. The
score of Saturday's game might well have
' been much larger if they had made half
\ of the free throws and field goals they
