# FRESHMAN QUINTET WINS EU FREMONT
## 
### 
The 1926 court quintet, coached by
| "Husky" Hunt, made its first appcarance
j of the'season Saturday night in the pa
vilion and nosed out the fast Fremont
: High School five by a score of 19-14 in
the last few minutes of the game.
The babes were slow in getting under
1 way. At the end of the first quarter of
| Play, tfte high school lads .were on the
long end of a 5-0 score as the result of
field goals by Johnson and Berger and a
free throw by tffe latter. The freshmen
; couldn't seem to locate the basket the
j few times they got open shots. With
| the beginning of the second quarter, the
j Fremont boys made a series of personal
1 fouls, and Peery converted three of them
into points. Junta, high school center,
, made a field goal under the basket and
the score stood 7-3. A few seconds later,
Frazier made the babes first fi?ld goal.
| Peery and Morrison tied the count with
;a free throw each and the half ended
with the score at 7-7.
Ernie Nevers, who had been playing
the entire floor and breaking up the high
j school team work started the sec
ond half by dropping in a pretty one
I from the*side of the court. Westphal
came back with another good shot and
the score was again tied at 9-.9 Two
free throws for each team still left the
score tied. As the quarter ended, Mor
rison sunk one from under the goal and
the babes were ahead 13-11.
The high school team took the lead for
the last time shortly after the final period
began. A field goal and a free one by
Junta gave them a one-point advantage.
Morrison once more knotted the count
with a free throw. At this point, Frazier,
who had been playing a good defensive
i game, went wold. In quick succession,
he dropped in two pretty field goals and
,a free one and the high school team was
beaten.
The babes look to be a strong defensive
aggregation and should develop into a
well-balanced team as soon as the for
wards begin to find the basket. The
score of Saturday's game might well have
' been much larger if they had made half
\ of the free throws and field goals they
tried for. Of twenty-three free throws,
they made nine, and almost every man on
the squad tried for several.
Nevers is the outstanding player on the
team. He is heavy and fast, handles the
ball well, and makes himself generally
useful in breaking up his opponent's pass
ing game. If he gets his eye on the
hoop, he has the makings of another
"Swede" Righter. Frazier, at either
guard or forward, is a valuable man and
Mitchell, at the running guard position
handles himself well. Morrison held
down the job at center for more than
half of the game and gave a good ex
hibition. He is a good defensive man
and fairly sure on baskets.

The 1926 court quintet, coached by
| "Husky" Hunt, made its first appcarance
j of the'season Saturday night in the pa
vilion and nosed out the fast Fremont
: High School five by a score of 19-14 in
the last few minutes of the game.
The babes were slow in getting under
1 way. At the end of the first quarter of
| Play, tfte high school lads .were on the
long end of a 5-0 score as the result of
field goals by Johnson and Berger and a
free throw by tffe latter. The freshmen
; couldn't seem to locate the basket the
j few times they got open shots. With
| the beginning of the second quarter, the
j Fremont boys made a series of personal
1 fouls, and Peery converted three of them
into points. Junta, high school center,
, made a field goal under the basket and
the score stood 7-3. A few seconds later,
Frazier made the babes first fi?ld goal.
| Peery and Morrison tied the count with
;a free throw each and the half ended
with the score at 7-7.
Ernie Nevers, who had been playing
the entire floor and breaking up the high
j school team work started the sec
ond half by dropping in a pretty one
I from the*side of the court. Westphal
came back with another good shot and
the score was again tied at 9-.9 Two
free throws for each team still left the
score tied. As the quarter ended, Mor
rison sunk one from under the goal and
the babes were ahead 13-11.
The high school team took the lead for
the last time shortly after the final period
began. A field goal and a free one by
Junta gave them a one-point advantage.
Morrison once more knotted the count
with a free throw. At this point, Frazier,
who had been playing a good defensive
i game, went wold. In quick succession,
he dropped in two pretty field goals and
,a free one and the high school team was
beaten.
The babes look to be a strong defensive
aggregation and should develop into a
well-balanced team as soon as the for
wards begin to find the basket. The
score of Saturday's game might well have
' been much larger if they had made half
\ of the free throws and field goals they
tried for. Of twenty-three free throws,
they made nine, and almost every man on
the squad tried for several.
Nevers is the outstanding player on the
team. He is heavy and fast, handles the
ball well, and makes himself generally
useful in breaking up his opponent's pass
ing game. If he gets his eye on the
hoop, he has the makings of another
"Swede" Righter. Frazier, at either
guard or forward, is a valuable man and
Mitchell, at the running guard position
handles himself well. Morrison held
down the job at center for more than
half of the game and gave a good ex
hibition. He is a good defensive man
and fairly sure on baskets.
