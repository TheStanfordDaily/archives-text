# DR. JORDAN WILL DISCUSS NEW ERA IN JAPAN'S POLICY
## Observations During Visit to Japan for Fish Specimens To Be Subject of Lecture 
### 
Japan's economic development an#
broadening policies during the last ten
years will be topics included in Dr. Jor
dan's talk, based on his recent trip to that
country, in the first lecture of the quar
ter next Tuesday evening. On account
of the large attendance expected, the lec
ture will be held in the Assembly Hall.
Dr. Jordan spent two months in Japan
this summer lecturing and collecting
specimens of fish for research work and
for the zoological museum. During his
visit the Japanese government made him
a Knight of the Order of the Rising
Sunâ€”one of the highest honors that may
be conferred upon a foreigner.
Will Discuss Agreement
In his lecture Dr. Jordan intends to
discuss how Japan has made good her
agreement to get out of China, how and
why she has reduced her army and navy,
and what the Japanese women are doing
in this new era.
"The Japanese people are not hard to
understand," Dr. Jordan said, in speaking
of the subject. "Contrary to popular be
lief, they are not inscrutable. There is a
wide difference in the world as it is, and
the world as it appears to agitators."
The women's peace party is a coming
factor in Japan, he believes. "This or
ganization has lately conducted a revision
of school books, with the result that all
references to military glory have been,
censored."
Japanese Professors Assist
Dr. Jordan was assisted in his fish col
lecting by a number of Japanese profes
sors whose services were offered by sev
eral universities. Twenty-nine cases of
specimens have arrived and will soon be
unpacked. Customs officers examined the
contents of the boxes to learn if the fish
were preserved in alcohol, but passed the
shipment on finding that the solution was
formalin.
At a meeting of the American Legion
Thursday night in Palo Alto, Dr. Jordan
gave a talk with Japan as his subject. Of
the 2000 Japanese who have been edu
cated in America, 200 received their edu
cation at Stanford, said Dr. Jordan.
