# MECHANICAL DISQUALIFICATION
## 
### 
Until this quarter no newspaper publicity has been
given the disqualification of Stanford students since
the new point system went into effect. There had
been, as always, the faint rumblings of a disgruntled
few, but until the accumulation of "probations" sud
denly culminated in the disqualification of a too-large
number of athletes, the majority of people had come
to think of the new system as a probable success.
There has been a distinct change in attitude these last
few days, partly because of the disappointment of
those interested in athletics, and partly because the
disqualification of better-known Stanford students
has led to investigation of individual cases.
Nothing new has resulted from these investiga
tions. The results of the point system are the same
as before. But for the first time the students have
learned what the trend of the present method really
is. They have been awakened with a rude shock to a
realization that perhaps the apparently harmless
method of culling the bad students from the good
has a few short-comings. If so, they would like to
see corrections made.
No system, however detailed or comprehensive, can
be wholly good. Perfection is impossible. But if
there is room for reasonable improvement, then such
changes as are necessary to effect this end ought to
be made. The present system cannot be attacked on
the ground that it disqualifies athletes. Obviously, an
athlete is entitled to no more consideration than an
ordinary student. Nobody who really is awake to
Stanford's interests wants any preference shown to
a particular group. But when the number of athletes
disqualified is all out of proportion to the number
of other students, it is a fair indication that some
thing is wrong. We do not know what system other
universities use in the retention of their football and
track teams. But we do know that Stanford has
always had to fight probation and disqualification
much harder and with far less success than other col
leges in this section of the country. And we do know
that many athletes who are dropped from Stanford's
rolls enter competing colleges and are retained there
until they graduate from those institutions or else are
re-admitted to Stanford. It is too bad when our
alumni work so hard to get men who are both stu
dents and athletes to come to Stanford to have them
refused the privilege of registration. But worse yet
is the situation which permits them to enter with an
extremely high average and then disqualifies them be
fore they have definitely proven or disproven their
scholastic ability.
The point system is obviously designed to make
disqualification a matter of mere mechanical detail.
Certain limits are set up. Overstepping means dis
qualification. There is seldom such a thing as an
"extenuating circumstance." The hearing of ap
peals, the reconsideration of cases, is designed only
to reclaim such students as can prove that a mistake
was made by a corrector or who can fool the com
mittee into giving them another chance. This method
admits of dishonesty and imposition in the case of
the unknown student. A premium is set on dis
honesty. But in the case of an athlete, whose name
and record is well-known to the committee, especially
if some one has interceded for him, there is no chance
to use any of the several devices for reinstatement.
The committee cannot do more than to listen to the
story. They must close the case because their neigh
liors, the faculty members who do not approve of
student activity, will make sly hints about the group
that flunks out scholars and allows "thick-headed ath

letes" another chance. And the committee, itself,
when it looks over the record of an athlete, smiles
knowingly whenever its official eye encounters an
A or a B, because here is more evidence of favoritism
on the part of faculty members who already have the
record of giving "pipe" courses.
It is a foregone conclusion that an athlete atStan
ford is at a disadvantage because Jie is in the public
eye. It is impossible for him ever to get the breaks.
If it is a question of a "B" or a "C", he gets the "C".
Correctors and instructors live in a constant fear that
some other faculty member will see signs of favor
itism in their ivork. Faculty'members are too prone
to question the motives and methods of their fellow
members. The average instructor bends backward
in his attempt to give the well-known student only
what is coming to him. An athlete can never get
the breaks.
Theoretically, the point system gives the greatest
pdlsible latitude for the retention of the lagging
scholar. It is so designed that if only its minimum
requirements are met, the candidate for degree will
barely get his diploma in the last quarter of his fourth
year. But it allozvs no latitude for uneven breaks.
Its penalties are cumulative and utterly mechanical.
It permits of disqualification before the Lower Dizn
sion requirements are met. And it is to the Lower
Division system that fully there-fourths of disquali
fied students may trace their dowtifall. Certain stu
dents have aversions to certain subjects. It may be
a language. In such a case, the twenty to thirty hours
required under the present system are enough to place
the student on probatipn from which he cannot pos
sibly redeem himself so long as he is burdened with
the disliked course. In the recent disqualifications,
one student, an athlete of no mean ability, was sent
away from Stanford because he had lost twenty
grade points in Spanish. He had just completed his
last quarter of the language, but it was one quarter
too late. It was his third and last time on proba
tion. Had he been allowed to remain in college, it is
practically certain that he could have henceforth met
all requirements. But the mechanical procedure of
a committee bound by the rules of a purely automatic
system, unable to use judgment and prohibited to
exercise any initiative, put this student out of college
on even terms with men who had not made a single
hour. This may be mechanical perfection but it is
not justice.
There is nothing so pitiless or inhuman as the ma
chine type of administration. In theory, it is a mas
terpiece of fairness. An absolutely even chance is
given every individual governed by its rules. It is
based on the far-reaching and detailed scheme which
characterizes German political philosophy, but like
that same scheme, it fails utterly to function prop
erly in the case of exceptions. And it is with ex
ceptions that we have to deal in the matter of dis
qualification.
This is no appeal for athletes as a group or for
any other group. It is not intended as an attack upon
the point system, its authors, or its administrators.
It is not intended to stir up a rebellion and it is sin
cerely hoped that it will cause no ill-will. But it
is intended to point out the hardships which beset the
paths of athletes, and to show a few faults of a sys
tem which has thus far been looked upon as an
experiment by its authors. Stanford students
would like to see every individual given a fair
chance in every way. They would like to see a more
human element enter into the mechanics of the point
system. They would like to see the three-quarter pro
bation clause changed at least enough to off-set possi
ble Lower Division difficulties. They would like to
see a spirit of helpfulness and co-operation between
faculty members and the better-known students,
rather than a give-as-little-as-you-can and get-as
much-as-you-can attitude. They would like to have
another chance given students who make all their
hours but are disqualified because the grade in every
case is "D". They do not think that three quarters
of probation is a big enough proportion of a twelve
quarter college career. There is opportunity for
more latitude.
In brief, unless the present system is so concrete
in form and is so complicated in its organization that
it will not permit changes,.the students would like
to see it amended. And if it cannot be changed, then
they would probably look with favor upon a new and
fairer system.
