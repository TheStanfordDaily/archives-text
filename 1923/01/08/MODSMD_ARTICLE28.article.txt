# Seniors Not Registered Last Quarter May Get Pictures in 1924 Quad
## 
### 
Seniors who were not registered dur
ing the fall but are signed up for this
quarter, may get their pictures and rec
ords in the 1924 Quad by paying the
$1.50 fee by next Thursday.
Fees may be paid at the Quad office,
on the second floor in the Administra
tion building, on Tuesday, Wednesday or
Thursday from 2:30 to 4:00. Upon pay
ment jjf the fee, an official receipt will be

given for the picture to be taken at the
Franklin studio on the circle.
These pictures must be taken by Janu
ary 13, in order that the engravers may
pictures on schedule time. Im
mediately after that date the pictures will
be alphabetically arranged and sent up to
San Francisco at once to be engraved,
thus making it impossible for further
seniors to get either their pictures or rec
ords of the Quad.
