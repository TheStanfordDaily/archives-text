## 
### 
Facsimiles of the works of Shakes
peare as they were produced in edi
tions of 1632 and 1664 are now owned
by the Library.
Each edition ,a faithful reproduction
published according to the original
copies, is in one large volume printed
in London in 1909. They contain the
comedies, histories and tragedies with
the old spelling and style of print re
tained. The edition of 1664 announces
that it contains seven additional plays
that were never printed in folio.
Both books contain long and enthu
siastic commemorating articles with
odes and epitaphs to the memory of
Shakespeare by such men as Ben Jon
son, Hugh Holland, and others less
well-known and more flowery in their
praises.
Lists of the actors and actresses
who were cast in Shakespeare's plays
in those days and in which plays they
appeared, are included in the intro
ductions to the plays.
Each volume contains an engraved
portrait of Shakespeare.
