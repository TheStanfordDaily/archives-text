# U.S.C. BASKETBALL COACH HAS BUT ONE VARSITY LETTER MAN
## 
### 
Coach Turner, who has charge of the
basketball squad of the University of
Southern California, has only one star,
Captain Kenney White, from last year's
quintet to aid him in forming a team to
compete with Stanford and California in
the Pacific Coast Conference games.
White is the only letter man with
whom Coach Turner can mold a new
team and few new men are available.
According to Turner, the present state
of affairs is due to the fact that the late
football training in preparation for the
Penn State game on New Year's Day
has led to a real lack of interest in basket
ball on the part of undergraduates and a
consequent dearth of material.
In order for U. S. C. to avoid the
reputation of being a one-sport institu
tion, Coach Turner says that much more
interest will have to be shown in basket
ball.
It has not quite got to the point where
the coach has to go out on the street and
drag in passers-by by the nape of the
neck and force them to play on his team,
but the number of men competing for
positions is very small and more men are
needed, and needed badly.
