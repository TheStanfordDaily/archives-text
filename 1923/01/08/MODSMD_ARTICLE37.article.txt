# SOCCER PLAYERS TO MEET ITALIA VIRTUS IN GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford soccer players will engage in
their first game of the quarter Saturday
when they travel to San Francisco to meet
the Italia Virtus soccer team. This game
marks the opening of the University and
Club League games which will be con
cluded before the end of the winter quar
ter. During the fall quarter, a series of
games was played among the eight teams
in the league and the same schedule will
be followed this quarter except with an
exchange of fields.
The first game in the fall quarter was
played between Stanford and Italia Vir
tus at Stanford and the same teams will
meet Saturday on the Italia Virtus
grounds in San Francisco. The other
teams to play Saturday are: California
and the Barbarians at Berkeley; Vikings
and Trafalgar in San Francisco; and the
Olympics and the American Legion in San
Francisco.
The game between Stanford and Cali
fornia which was formerly scheduled to
take place in March has been changed to
February 22 and will be played on the
California grounds in Berkeley.
The Stanford team has emerged league
victor for two successive seasons and the
prospects for the continued success of the
team are bright. During the entire first
half of the soason the team won every
game and played sych a brand of soccer
that only two goals were scored against
it, compared with twenty-five goals to
its credit. With such a record it leads
the league, being pressed close by the
Barbarians who have lost only one game
and won six, scoring twenty-three goals
to six for their opponents. The point
score gives Stanford a lead of two points
over her nearest rival, with a score of
fourteen points to twelve for the Bar
barians.
If the Stanford players again win the
league title, William Ellery, of the El
lery Arms Company, has promised. to
award to the best fifteen players gold
soccer football metals in appreciation of
their third successive triumph.
