WASHINGTON, Jan. B—The United
States may soon again make its voice
heard in European councils.
The Washington government is
watching closely events in France and
it is believed certain President Hard
ing will make at least one further
move if war looms larger on the
Rhineland horizon.
Despite the fact that this govern
ment believes it did all that was pos
sible under the circumstances recently
in announcing its program to relieve
the situation in Europe—the plan for
a conference or commission to recom
mend a reparations figure, with hope
of a loan to Germany to follow —the
United States will state its position in
some further way if matters become
worse in Europe.
President Harding, Secretary of
State Hughes and American Ambassa
dor to England George Harvey today
were considering the Reed resolution,
by which the senate declared that the
American troops of occupation on the
Rhine should be withdrawn.
While nothing is yet understood to
be decided, the indications are that
the administration will prefer to await
an actual advance by France into the
Ruhr before withdrawing the United
States forces.
