# Regulation of Stanford Women Is Unnecessary Says Pictorial Article
## 
### 
Why should Stanford women be com
pelled to check in at a certain hour after
an evening's entertainment when Stanford
men are allowed to remain out until
morning of they wish to? Why should
the female of the species be bound down
by any hard and fast rule while the male
is allowed to perambulate about the coun
try at all times and at all hours just to
his liking?
Such rules and regulations governing
the conduct of women in the University
are entirely unnecessary according to Don
Sncdden, '23, who compares the freedom
of the Stanford man with the lack of it
in the Stanford woman. In "A Benevo
lent Diatribe," appearing in the next issue
of Pictorial, he declares that because
Stanford men and women should be on the
same plane, the latter should be just as
capable of taking care of themselves as
the former.
