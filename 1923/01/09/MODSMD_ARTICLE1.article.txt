### (By United Press 
COLOGNE, Germany, Jan. 9. —Move-
ments of French troops, now filtering
into the Rhineland, are surrounded
with all the secrecy of war time. Com
manders of the French armies expect,
momentarily orders from Paris to ad
vance into the rich Ruhr basin.
Advance contingents of French en
gineers and customs officials already
have arrived at Dusseldorf and other
cities in the Rhineland, en route to
Essen, home of the Krupp munitions
tactories which will be the first city
to be occupied in the new movement.
Essen will be used as the base of
French operations in the Ruhr.
The increasing number of poilus in
cities in the path leading to the Ruhr
gives the impression that the actual
occupation is largely a matter of the
issuance of the formal order from
Paris.
