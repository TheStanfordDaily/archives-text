## Undeveloped Resources, International Relations Will Be Discussed This Evening 
### 
What are Japan's industrial possibili-,
tics for the future and what are the
economic resources remaining untouched? j
Dr. Jordan will answer these questions
in his talk upon various aspects of mod
ern Japan—from international relation
ships, the present government, and her
undeveloped industries, to the promotion
of scientific research —in a lecture this
evening at 7:30 in the Assembly Hall.
In touching upon the country's indus
trial needs, which he will discuss in his
talk. Dr. Jordan said recently, "Japan
should develop her water-power in order
to increase manufacturing. Waste lands |
in the north can also be used to advantage |
for cattle grazing, thus adding valuable |
dairy products, such as butter, cheese,!
and milk to the Japanese diet."
He is well acquainted with Premier
Uchida and believes that the present gov
ernment, which is cautious and quiet, is a
good one. The Japanese are a law-abid
ing people, for, according to Dr. Jordan,
more crimes are committed in Chicago;
in a week than in Tokyo in a year.
During his stay in Tokyo alone, Dr.
Jordan delivered addresses at five of its
six universities, and spoke to many or
ganizations as well. He was entertained
by a number of Stanford graduates, of
whom there are more than sixty now liv-!
ing in Japan.
