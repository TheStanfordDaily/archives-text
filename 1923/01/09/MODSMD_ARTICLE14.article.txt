# FIRE MARSHAL HOPES TO FINISH CLEAN-UP OF CAMPUS THIS WEEK
## 
### 
"Clear oft" your scrap piles and get rid i
of your junk heaps! Supply metal con-;
tainers for all rubbish. This includes
laundry boxes in the halls." Such is the
Fire Marshal's word for the edification
of the wise.
Strenuous efforts arc being made by:
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb under the direc
tion of the University administration to
complete the campus fire-prevention;
clean-up within a week.
Living groups having rubbish and in- 1
flammables on their premises and other
fire hazards in violation of state laws on!
the subject have been sent notices to com
ply with the state regulations and the
requirements incorporated in the leases!
from the University.
These notices will be followed by a
second noticme which the Comptroller's
office has prepared to warn erring living
groups of the liability of lease cancella
tion in case the Fire Department's com-1
plaint is not adjusted. A second inspec
tion by the Marshal follows the initial j
one after about one week, and it is only
upon his recommendation that trouble can
be avoided.
The Fire Marshal will make a visit of
inspection to the offending groups this i
week, and if the conditions have not been,
remedied they will be notified by Comp
troller Roth to appear to show reason,
why their leases should not be cancelled.
