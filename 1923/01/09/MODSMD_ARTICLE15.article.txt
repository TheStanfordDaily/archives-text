# INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL SEASON IS OPENED WITH CLOSE CONTESTS BETWEEN INEXPERIENCED FIVES
## 
### 
Four fraternity teams won their first
starts last night in Encina Gymnasium on
the first day of play in the intramural
basketball tournament. All of the play
ers lacked condition and each team took
several time-outs. The scoring was ir
regular and only an occasional basket was
recorded. The new rules caused the play
ers as well as the referee some difficulty
and the games were slowed up as a result.
It was a case of the biggest man winning
and the games were hard fought, every
player going to the limit.
D. K. E. Wins Opener
The opening game of the intramural
scries was played between the Breakers
and Delta Kappa Epsilon, the latter win
ning after a hard fight 8-4. The score
was the lowest and the closest of any of
the four games played. Botli teams
opened up with a lot of pep and spirit
and carried the ball back and forth on the
floor with a few wild shots at the basket
interspersed. After the game had pro
gressed several minutes, Wheat, playing
forward for D. K. E., caged a pretty
shot under the basket. From then on
things opened up ond both sides alter
nated in scoring. At the half both sides
we r e all in, and the game was finished
with little more scoring.

Phi Gamma Delta, 14; Encina First
Floor, 10
Immediately following the Breakers-
Delta Kappa Epsilon game, the Phi
Gamma Delta teams started play against
Encina Hall, first floor. The Phi Gamma
Delta five got the jump on Encina and!
piled up enough of a lead to win the
game although the hall men came back
in the second half and fought on even
j terms with their rivals. The final score!
was 14-10.
At 7:15 p. m. the Alpha Delta Phi
quintet took the floor with the Encina
1 Hall, second floor men, and led them
easily from the start. The score at the
half was 9-5 in favor of the Alpha Delta !
; and was increased to 14-6 by the' end of
; the game. Campbell and Pollard played j
: half was 9-5 in favor of Alpha Delta Phi
| ing two baskets apiece. The winners
j showed the best team work of the day
j and managed to work the ball to theirl
! opponents' basket repeatedly, poor shoot
! ing and lack of condition alone preventing J
i a larger score. The Encina players were
1 considerably smaller than their opponents
j but put up a good fight, following the
ball closely throughout the game.
