# Kerr’s Basketball Five Will Make Second Start of Year Against Righter’s Quintet
## 
### 
Tomorrow night, Kerr's varsity five
will make their second start of the season,
this time against Swede Righter's fast
aggregation from the College of Pacific.
This bout should find the Cardinal
team much improved over Saturday's
showing and with Nip McHose back at
his old position, the Rogers-Janssen-Mc-
Hose combination with Piggott and Aus
tin to alternate gives Coach Andy Kerr
a strong offensive. Last night, the prac
tice was given over to perfecting the
weaknesses brought out in the game with
the 1921 varsity.
This will be the first game of the year
for the College of Pacific and not much
is known of their strength with the ex
ception that they have three members of
last year's five playing. Spoon, captain
and guard on the Orange and Black
quintet, is regarded as the best bet
against the Cardinals by Coach Righter.
Spoon is playing his third year on the
San Jose team and gave the varsity no
end of trouble in the bout last year that
dedicated the new Pavilion.
Wagner, the other guard on Righter's
team, is also a three-year man while
Keeney at forward was a member of last
year's squad. Stevens will probably start
the game at center for the Orange and
Black while Burcham or Collis will play,
the other forward position.
Last night, Righter put his squad
through the paces on the pavilion floor
and although he refused to make any pre
dictions as to the outcome of the game,
he stated that it was too bad that his
team could not have played the Varsity
in the condition that it was last Saturday.
Janssen should be in better shape
Wednesday than he was in the opening
fray. The tall lanky center had a great
deal of trouble with his wind last year
but since then an operation has remedied
this defect. Steele, center of the 1925
freshmen team has been showing up well
in practice lately and may get a chance to
show what he can do tomorrow. Piggott
who started the game Saturday at center
is lighter than Janssen but makes up this
handicap by his ability to find the basket
occasionally.

Fred Anderson is at present leading all
aspirants for the running guard position
although Mcßurney, a transfer, and A1
Hooper are giving him plenty of compe
tion. Oliva is holding down DeGroot's
old position at standing guard.

team could not have played the Varsity
in the condition that it was last Saturday.
Janssen should be in better shape
Wednesday than he was in the opening
fray. The tall lanky center had a great
deal of trouble with his wind last year
but since then an operation has remedied
this defect. Steele, center of the 1925
freshmen team has been showing up well
in practice lately and may get a chance to
show what he can do tomorrow. Piggott
who started the game Saturday at center
is lighter than Janssen but makes up this
handicap by his ability to find the basket
occasionally.

Fred Anderson is at present leading all
aspirants for the running guard position
although Mcßurney, a transfer, and A1
Hooper are giving him plenty of compe
tion. Oliva is holding down DeGroot's
old position at standing guard.
Tomorrow night, Kerr's varsity five
will make their second start of the season,
this time against Swede Righter's fast
aggregation from the College of Pacific.
This bout should find the Cardinal
team much improved over Saturday's
showing and with Nip McHose back at
his old position, the Rogers-Janssen-Mc-
Hose combination with Piggott and Aus
tin to alternate gives Coach Andy Kerr
a strong offensive. Last night, the prac
tice was given over to perfecting the
weaknesses brought out in the game with
the 1921 varsity.
This will be the first game of the year
for the College of Pacific and not much
is known of their strength with the ex
ception that they have three members of
last year's five playing. Spoon, captain
and guard on the Orange and Black
quintet, is regarded as the best bet
against the Cardinals by Coach Righter.
Spoon is playing his third year on the
San Jose team and gave the varsity no
end of trouble in the bout last year that
dedicated the new Pavilion.
Wagner, the other guard on Righter's
team, is also a three-year man while
Keeney at forward was a member of last
year's squad. Stevens will probably start
the game at center for the Orange and
Black while Burcham or Collis will play,
the other forward position.
Last night, Righter put his squad
through the paces on the pavilion floor
and although he refused to make any pre
dictions as to the outcome of the game,
he stated that it was too bad that his
team could not have played the Varsity
in the condition that it was last Saturday.
