# WOMEN AND DEBATING
## 
### 
The organization of the women's debating group
last night under the sponsorship of Wranglers So
ciety fills a real need at Stanford. It will give the
needed encouragement to the interest which the
women already have in debating and it will open
another activity to them.
Every year Stanford women have been challenged
to debates with other universities but there have
been 110 debaters among the 500 for several college
generations. No restrictions have ever been placed
on their competing with the men for the University
debating teams but without the backing of some
kind of organization the women have* not taken
any initiative in the past. The newly organized
group will promote active participation in both local
and intercollegiate debating.
The charge is sometimes made that Stanford
women do not show sufficient interest in under
graduate activities; but the field of these activities
has been too limited to attract many participants.
With the addition of debating to the list this con
dition of inertia may be expected to improve.
