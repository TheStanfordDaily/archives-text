# WHERE IS THE LEAK?
## 
### 
Official action taken by many of the committees
and boards which attend to the administration of
Stanford's affairs seems lately to become common
property with a speed that is at once startling and
annoying. This trouble is to be found particularly
in the case of action taken by the Board of Athletic
Control. No resolution, 110 recommendation, 110
result of an executive session has been kept from
the public for the past year. The stories of the
appointment of Glenn Warner, of Andy Kerr, of
"Tiny" Thornhill, all broke prematurely. Local
correspondents for city papers \fere surprised to
learn of the appointment of Harry Wolters to the
position of baseball coach before the Board's recom
mendation had been passed upon by the President
and the Trustees. W. D. Fletcher's announcement
that he would not be available for re-appointment
after this year was printed in this same paper. And
a few days later the offer of the position of Gradu
ate Manager to Paul Davis was announced in this
and another paper. This last news break followed
an executive session of the Board of Control three
days before at which certain actions of a necessarily
private nature were taken. What the Board did at
that time was nobody's business until such actions
as it took had been approved or revoked by higher
authority. It became, however, everybody's business
and caused campus correspondents a great deal of
trouble. Moreover, official procedure in the matters
involved have been hampered.
The editor of the Daily Palo Alto has been present
at all meetings and attended the last executive ses
sion of the Board of Athletic Control. In the
interests of the Daily, particularly because matters
taken up in the Board meetings are chiefly of inter
est to Stanford readers, such news as comes from
the body in question should be printed locally first.
As it turns out, the first that Daily readers learn of
the matter is through the editorial columns. The
Daily has been scooped through no fault of its own
in every important news break for months. The
worst part of the whole situation is the fact that
the editor of the student publication is in possession
of the facts but has not the dishonest qualification
of breaking the news before it is ripe.
The question is, "Where is the leak?" If an
answer is not forthcoming, and if there is any reason
to believe that this practice is not to be stopped,
then all concerned may take it for granted that
nothing hereafter is to be sacred to the Daily or to
its representatives. Tf because it is a student pub
lication, the Daily is to get the most unethical of
all newspaper breaks, then in the future it shall
conform to what seems to be truly metropolitan
standards—the news at any cost.
The editor of the Daily has been accused time
and again of breaking faith with fellow members of
an organization which is the source of our most
interesting news. Why, in the name of disgusted
journalists, should he not Ijencfit by the alleged
"break" and put it in his own paper first?

If the source of the leak can chew on this choice
morsel and swallow it without choking, then we
think we have discovered the individual who "can
strain at a gnat and swallow a camel."

in every important news break for months. The
worst part of the whole situation is the fact that
the editor of the student publication is in possession
of the facts but has not the dishonest qualification
of breaking the news before it is ripe.
The question is, "Where is the leak?" If an
answer is not forthcoming, and if there is any reason
to believe that this practice is not to be stopped,
then all concerned may take it for granted that
nothing hereafter is to be sacred to the Daily or to
its representatives. Tf because it is a student pub
lication, the Daily is to get the most unethical of
all newspaper breaks, then in the future it shall
conform to what seems to be truly metropolitan
standards—the news at any cost.
The editor of the Daily has been accused time
and again of breaking faith with fellow members of
an organization which is the source of our most
interesting news. Why, in the name of disgusted
journalists, should he not Ijencfit by the alleged
"break" and put it in his own paper first?

If the source of the leak can chew on this choice
morsel and swallow it without choking, then we
think we have discovered the individual who "can
strain at a gnat and swallow a camel."
Official action taken by many of the committees
and boards which attend to the administration of
Stanford's affairs seems lately to become common
property with a speed that is at once startling and
annoying. This trouble is to be found particularly
in the case of action taken by the Board of Athletic
Control. No resolution, 110 recommendation, 110
result of an executive session has been kept from
the public for the past year. The stories of the
appointment of Glenn Warner, of Andy Kerr, of
"Tiny" Thornhill, all broke prematurely. Local
correspondents for city papers \fere surprised to
learn of the appointment of Harry Wolters to the
position of baseball coach before the Board's recom
mendation had been passed upon by the President
and the Trustees. W. D. Fletcher's announcement
that he would not be available for re-appointment
after this year was printed in this same paper. And
a few days later the offer of the position of Gradu
ate Manager to Paul Davis was announced in this
and another paper. This last news break followed
an executive session of the Board of Control three
days before at which certain actions of a necessarily
private nature were taken. What the Board did at
that time was nobody's business until such actions
as it took had been approved or revoked by higher
authority. It became, however, everybody's business
and caused campus correspondents a great deal of
trouble. Moreover, official procedure in the matters
involved have been hampered.
The editor of the Daily Palo Alto has been present
at all meetings and attended the last executive ses
sion of the Board of Athletic Control. In the
interests of the Daily, particularly because matters
taken up in the Board meetings are chiefly of inter
est to Stanford readers, such news as comes from
the body in question should be printed locally first.
As it turns out, the first that Daily readers learn of
the matter is through the editorial columns. The
Daily has been scooped through no fault of its own
in every important news break for months. The
worst part of the whole situation is the fact that
the editor of the student publication is in possession
of the facts but has not the dishonest qualification
of breaking the news before it is ripe.
