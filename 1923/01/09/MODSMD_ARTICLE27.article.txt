# NEW SPORTING EDITOR
## 
### 
Glenn Pollard becomes Sporting Editor with this
issue of the Daily to fill the position of Garrett
Elmore who has resigned to take up further aca
demic work. Pollard has been in close touch with
athletics all during his college career, which, to
gether with his natural abilities in journalism, espe
cially fits him for his new position. Hal Rorke this
quarter returns to the Daily to assume the position
of Telegraph Editor left vacant by Pollard.
