ACT ONE
A modern drawing room In Italy, New York. Portraits
and paints scattered about to give the necessary draw
ing room effect; a weasel in one corner. A large vase
of vermicelli stands on a three-legged table as near the
center of the stage as possible; this is the home of
Strangolio, the Vermicelli King.
Overture, "Romeo didn't think he'd wed her when he
saw how Julyet."
The curtain rises, showing Strangolio and Juliet in
animated argument.
Strongolio: No matter how you hate him, I tell you this,
my dear,
You'll marry that Potato, and his thousand
pounds a year!
Julyet: O father, spare thy child, for I must marry whom
I choose,
Besides, I think Potato drinks entirely too much
booze!
Strangolio: You vixen! Do my bidding, for I need Pota
toe's gold!
Julyet: The Hell I will, dear father. How much need
you be told.
(Strangolio stumbles out, leaving Julyet alone. In
order to pass the time she sings: "My fortune is my
face, and that's why I'm so poor." Enter Romeo through
window, attracted by the noise).
Romeo: My Julyet, what says your dad, what news have
you for me?
Julyet: The deal is off, for papa needs Potato's cash,
you see.
Romeo: My dad and he are rivals in the making of
spaghet'
But maybe I can fix it. I will try like H ,
you bet.
Curtain
ACT TWO
Overture, "She works in the calendar factory, and
she's always making dates."
Scene: Balcony hung out over some romantic spot.
Moonlight, denoting night-time. Romeo under balcony
playing saxaphone. "If Marriage is a Lottery, there
sure are lots of blanks." Julyet on balcony above. Her
head and shoulders showing above the rail are bare, but
the audience needn't worry.
Romeo: My dad, the great Spangolio, refuses me his aid.
We'll have to bow to circumstance, we cannot
make the grade.
Tomato: (Coming around corner of balcony and over
hearing the conversation.) So this is how
affairs have run. I'll have to see to this.
Romeo: I'll scale yoor wall, on both my knees, and
give you a final kiss.
(Romeo gets half way up, when Strangolio dashes out
on balcony with the huge vase of vermicelli. He drops
it on Romeo. The jester, Tomato, laughs ripely. Romeo
and the Curtain fall together).
ACT THREE
Scene: The tomb of the Spangolios. The stage is
empty, but as it is dark the audience is not aware of
this. Overture, "When once you've committed suicide,
it's hard to change your mind."
Julyet: (enters with candle, lit. She has decided to
drink the potion Tomato the Jester has
brought her, which will aid her escape
from her father's castle and clutches and
her elopement from Potato with Romeo.
She climbs up on empty bier, drinks po
tion, accompanied by gorgling soond from
orchestra. Either the potion or the cold
bier causes a numbness to steal through
her. She looks dead. Romeo steals in).
Romeo: Here have I come to take a nap before I must
elope. (Discovers Julyet dead on the bier.
She is really dead. The Jester played a
little joke on her and substituted arsenic
for the potion).
Romeo: My Gawd! Somebody's played a dirty trick on
my poor girl,
I guess that finishes me with life; I'll try grim
Death a whirl.
(Stabs himself with a cutting glance. Dies. Orches
tra plays the finale from "The Undertaker" entitled,
"You May Get By For Quite a While, But I'll Nail You
in the End." Curtain).
