Fred Adams, standing guard who
helped to open the basketball season
with the rest of the veteran crew, was
noted particularly in his varsity days
for the long passes he shot down the
floor to his forwards. Last Saturday
Fred was performing in his old style,
whizzing the ball nearly the length of
the court into the hands of Righter or
Jimmy Davies.

Weight was a big factor in the final
victory slipped across on the speedy
varsity players. Three men on the
alumni five, Righter, Adams, and Bert
Mills, bump the ceiling at six feet,
and flirt with the scales at around 200.
In the last couple of years weight has
come to be a big factor in caging
wins, much more than in the old days
of hit-or-miss dashing about the floor.
Oliva and Janssen were the only
heavies seen on the Redshirt side
Saturday.

Oliva, standing guard on the fresh
man squad last year, came through in
his first varsity game with a lot of
new stuff. He messed things up in
good shape when the vets sent the
play near his basket, and once went
up into the offensive and popped one
into the bucket, while Rogers took his
place at standing guard. Dud DeGroot,
who sat on the bench during the game
with his knee in a cast, is going to
have a job cut out for him to beat the
'25 player back to his old position.

"Nip" McHose, who streaked about
the court last season like a stray light
ning-fork, was another of Van Gent's
crew who sat on the bench. Poison
oak infection was the cause of his in
action, but the chances are he will be
seen in the game with Righter's Col
lege of Pacific gang.

Back at Pittsburgh, where Andy
Kerr was head coach of basketball,
the five-man offensive was the rule,
and Kerr intends to install the same
strategy here. He went easy on the
plan in the opener, so that the men
could start off play together under a
system they were accustomed to, but
the intention is to eventually make the
rear guard a part of the play all the
time, just back far enough to cover
his basket. This means that there will
have to be five instead of four men on
the Cardinal first line-up who can han
dle themselves in enemy territory.

Kerr used only four subs in the con-;
test, contrary to expectations that he
would take the opportunity to see all
the material possible in action. Jans
sen went in for Paul Piggott, Koba for
Austin, Hooper for Anderson, and Mc-
Burney for Oliva; probably others
would have gone in if it had not been
such a tight little battle along at the
last.

According to the rule-book, a player
who gets four personal fouls called on
him retires for the evening and a sub
stitute is called in. Had Rufus Kla
wans, referee for the Stanford season
starter, been forced to call four on any
of the returning stars, jthey would
have been up against it, or he would,
for there were only five of Stanford's
former great in the pavilion. Fortun
ately none of the vets had more than
two called against him.

Klawans, formerly a well-known
referee and at one time a star on an
All-Eastern quintet, has some interest
ing theories about arbiting a basket
ball game which he explained before
the Present and Past embroglio Sat
urday. Klawans thinks that a signal
from the scorekeeper's bench when a
player has made three fouls, and sub
sequent warning of the player, is the

worst thing that can be done. For the
athlete, it gets him excited, nervous,
and uncertain of himself, so that he
often fouls unintentionally; on the
referee's end, it makes him watch the
offender more closely, and at the same
time he is loth to call the final penalty.
Klawans figures both would be better
off without the warning signal, judg
ing that a referee should take it upon
himself to warn the player of inten
tional roughness or a repetition of the
same foul is observed.

Twelve of the two dozen who are
practicing on the pavilion court were
selected for new outfits last week, as

a preliminary to choosing the first
squad. Those who sport new outfits
are: Rogers, McHose, Austin, Summy,
Koba, Janssen, Piggott, Hooper, Oliva,
Anderson, Steele, Mc√üurney.
