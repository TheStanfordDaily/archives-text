# Lightweight Quintet Will Start Practice in Pavilion Tonight
## 
### 
With a record of two years without a
defeat, the Cardinal 130-pound basketball
team gets under way tonight when candi
dates will report to Coach W. W. Young,
'23, at 7 :30 in the Pavilion for the first
practice.
A schedule is being drawn up by the!
Graduate Manager's office, several penin- J
sula high schools being included in the j
tentative list.
As soon as the season gets under way, j
the lightweights will play curtain-raisers
to both the varsity and freshman games, j
In the two years that it has been in j
existence, the 130-pound five has enjoyed
the most success of any Stanford quin
tet. During that time it has met many
strong high school teams and has de
feated them all. The Card lightweights
also won the two series from their Cali
fornia opponents, despite the fact that
weight basketball at Berkeley had been
established for several years prior to the
formation of the 130-pound team at Stan
ford.
