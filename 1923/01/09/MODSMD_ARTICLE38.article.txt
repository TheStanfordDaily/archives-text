# Freshman Tennis Outlook Brightened by New Star
## 
### 
Freshman tennis prospects, already
bright, have been further enhanced by
the registration here of "Tubby" Og-;
den, Southern California junior tennis:
star.
Ogden was Bay League champion
last year and was ranked as the third
best tennis star in the south. With
three racquet wielders like Coffin, Og-'
den, and Fairchild on the team the
freshmen, according to all advance
dope, should be able to defeat any:
other Pacific Coast yearling tennis
team.
