The latest in war memorials is an
Auditorium and Stadium to be erected
at the University of Minnesota as a
combination tribute to the Minnesota
dead of the World War and the late
President Emeritus Cyrus Northrup.
The executive council of the Minne
sota American Legion has passed a
resolution in favor of the structures,
which will be built in cooperation with
the Greater University Corporation.
The cost and details are yet to be
determined.
