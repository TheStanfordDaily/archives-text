WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE
â€”Self-support while in college is a so
cial accomplishment among the men
at the State College of Washington,
according to a Y. M. C. A. question
naire which reached 1347 students. Of
these men, 48% earned all of their
expenses, while only 13% do so of
necessity. Living at home seems to
ease the financial pinch, as 74% of
the men living outside of Pullman earn
their way as against only 10% of the
home towners. A bare 16 men out of
every hundred go through school with
out self assistance.
