# CROP FAILURE IS THREAT TO EUROPE SAYS A.E. TAYLOR
## Secretary of Food Research Institute Makes Inspection Tour of European Countres 
### 
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, executive secretary
of the Stanford Food Research Institute,
has returned to his office oil the campus
today after a tour of inspection of several
months through Germany, Poland, Aus
tria, Hungary, and Czecho-Slovakia, in
which he made a first-hand study of food,
transportation and economic conditions in
those countries. •»
Last quarter was Dr. Taylor's vaca
tion period and, as he has done before,
he took the opportunity to make a trip
to Europe in connection with his work in
the Food Research Institute.
"One of the most interesting situa
tions that I encountered during my trip,"
Dr. Taylor said, "was being in Germany
in November and watching the mark go
down from 3000 to 9000 in a month. It
was a demonstration of the topsy-turvey
condition that arises when a currency
ceases to be a circulating medium or a
measure of value. The people do not use
it for trading and emergency money of
all sorts appears, based solely on the in
tegrity of the people who issue it.
"One of the difficulties in Europe this
year," Dr. Taylor says, "is the partial
crop failure in the regions north of the
Alps and the Balkans."
Concerning the German reparations
situation Dr. Taylor said, "It was appar
ent when I was there that the affairs of
Germany and France revolving about
reparation were rapidly approaching a
crisis when a decision could no longer
he postponed. The outcome depends on
the wisdom of that decision. There must
be a definite fixing of the reparation, fol
lowed by the establishment of a definite
method of payment which has tolcome
into operation after a period of mora
torium. It is unfortunate that the Brit
ish and the French did not agree more
closely on the method of procedure."
Before returning to the United States
Dr. Taylor spent brief times in Paris and
in London. "The one country in Europe
that I visited," he says, "that shows defin
ite and positive improvement is England.
Unemployment there is not yet conquered
but the whole situation is vastly improved
over what it was when I was there a
year ago.
"So far as an outsider can judge the
deadest living man now is Lloyd George.
Everyone in England expresses relief at
getting back to the two-party system."
