Wranglers' Society last night to organize
the first debating group Stanford women
have ever had. Definite organization will
not be made until later in the quarter but
it is understood that the group will make
part in local and intercollegiate debating.
Wranglers chose as the question for
their debate with Euphronia freshmen
January 31 the topic, "Rescolvcd, That no
special preference be given to varsity ath
letes except three University crcdits plus
honor points." Wranglers' Society does
not know whether it will take the affirma

the new debating group; they will report

the new organization mature, it will be
formed as a subsidiary to Wranglers' So
ciety, with the probability of its develop
into a separate group.
