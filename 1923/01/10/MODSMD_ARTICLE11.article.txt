# BABE QUINTET PLAYS SAN JOSE HIGH TEAM
## Frosh Squad in Good Shape For Mission City Five; Hunt Announces Lineup to Start 
### 
The Cardinal freshman quintet plays
its second game of the season against
San Jose High School in the preliminary
to the Varsity-College of the Pacific bat
tle tonight in the Pavilion, at 7 o'clock.
Coach Hunt has been working his
squad hard all week in preparation for
tonight's game and has succeeded in de
veloping better teamwork than the babes
used against Fremont last Saturday. Two
teams of freshmen scrimmaged for al
most an hour in the Pavilion last night
and Hunt seemed well pleased with the
results.
The babes still seem to have difficulty
in finding the basket. The first string
combination had no difficulty in keeping
the ball in their opponents' territory last
night but were seldom able to sink the
ball in the basket.
Hunt will probably send the same com
bination against the high school team to
night that he used in practise last night.
Morrison seems to have the edge on the
job at center. Carter is sure to get into
the game at this position, however. Both
of these men have been improving daily
in their defensive work but neither of
them have yet got their eyes on the
basket.
Nevers and Frazier make up the best
combination at the forward positions.
Both are big and fast and play the entire
floor. Frazier is the better man on
baskets.
The babe squad lias a wealth of mate
| rial for the guard positions. Mitchell,
| however, stands fur above any other man
in his place at rujuiing guard. He handles
the ball well and seldom gives his man a
chance at the basket. Kirwan will un
doubtedly be the choice for the staudiaig
guard job.
