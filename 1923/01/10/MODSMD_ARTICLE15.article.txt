# ANTI-IMPERIALIST PARTY DOMINATES JAPAN-DR. JORDAN
## Reduced Army Evacuation of Siberia Proves Sincerity of Japan's New Policies 
### 
"Do not believe everything you
hear, have no feeling of fear for!
Japan; they are human beings just as
we are, and those returning to Japan
from here are going to be your
friends." This is the sum of Dr. Jor-!
dan's opinion regarding the sincerity,
of the Japanese.
"What does it mean that jApan has
dismissed 30,000 men from her army
and navy? That she has evacuated;
Siberia and China." Dr. Jordan de- j
clared that he found significant j
changes in political administration and
in educational progress during his two i
months' visit to the country this sum- j
mer.
Three reasons influenced reductions j
in the fighting force of Japan, accord- j
ing to the lecturer —the enormous ex-,
pense of the campaign in Siberia; i
heavy taxes; and"a growing sentiment'
against imperialism. The money spent
in keeping troops on the continent
would have made a new city of Tokyo,
with a much-needed sewerage system,
paved streets, and subways. This was
the statement of Baron Goto, mayor
of Japan's capitol.
"In Germany Japan decided she had
backed the wrong horse," said Dr.
Jordan. "We must remember that the
feudal system existed in the country
until comparatively a few years ago,
and all Japanese officers were edu
cated in Germany. At the beginning
of the war it was thought that the j
United States would side with the
Teutons, supposedly on account of
hatred of England. Later, Germany's
minister was furious when Count
Okuma would not break his word."
in speaking of the Gentlemen's
Agreement, Dr. Jordan stated that,
contrary to papular belief, this coun
try cannot fintf a single case where
the pledge has been violated by Japan.
She does nc»l want emigrants, who are
usually of th«e common-laborer type, to
come to these shores on account of the
poor impression they make.
"I have seen a good deal of tire
growth ol education on this last visit,"*
said the speaker. "English is now com
pvilsory in the schools. A women's
peace party exists in Japan, for which
"Madame Ozaki is nan ardent worker.
She it the wife of ra former mayfa- of
Tokyp, who has done more than any
other single man to kill militarism. In
contrast to oldeii days, one can now
speak of democracy anywhere the
country with impunity."
