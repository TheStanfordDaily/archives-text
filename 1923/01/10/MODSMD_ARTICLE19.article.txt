# STANFORD SQUAD MEETS METHODIST FIVE TONIGHT
## Righter's College of Pacific Team Doped to Hand Out Real Struggle to Cardinal 
### 
Swede Righter's College of Pacific squad of veterans are doped to give the
Cardinal basketball varsity a great deal when the two quintets tangle on tlif
pavilion floor tonight. With five members of last year's team playing with
the Orange and Black this season, Righter has developed a team strong both
in offense and defense.
The Cardinal forwards will meet real competition in Spoon and Wagner,
who are playing their third year at guard for the College of Pacific five.
Wagner, it will be remembered, was the gent who shot thirteen out of sixteen
free throws in the bout between the two teams at the opening of the pavilion

last year. Eddie Spoon is counted upon
by Righter as the best shot on the
squad and is considered dangerous at
all angles when in possession of the
ball.
At the forward positions, llighter
will probably use Keeney, Collis, and
Bureham. Burcham and Keeney both
played on the 1922 Orange and Black
team. Keeney is fast and a good point
winner while Collis, a new man, is re
garded as a comer by the San Jose
followers of the game. Steven, who
will start the game tonight at center,
was a substitute last year but played
in the majority of the games.
Just who will start against the Meth
odists is not yet determined. McHose
has been in a suit all of this week but
is still suffering from poison oak. In
case Coach Andy Kerr decides to let
him recuperate a little more, Austin
will open the game at forward with
Captain Lefty Rogers. The showing of
A\istin this year has been a surprise
to every one. This is his first try for
the varsity and if he continues to de
velop as fast as he has in the past
two weeks, McHose will have a good
battle to retain his position on the
team.
Kerr's proteges should show a
marked improvement both in defense
and offense in the match tonight. Con
siderable stress has been placed upon
teamwork in the two days of practice
following the Alumni game. Kerr has
been working on a five-man defense
this year which the Orange and Black
will find difficult to penetrate.
Bob Janssen will start the game
in his old position at center while the
choice for guards will probably be
Fred Anderson and Oliva. Anderson
is the fastest guard on the squad and
with a little polish will soon make the
fans forget the loss of Dick Richmond.
One of the big features of the squad
this season is the large number of
able substitutes available, especially
in the guarding department. Hooper,
Mcßurney, and Harry Shipkey will
probably get into the game for a short
time tonight while Kerr has two good
centers in Pjggott and Steele to calP
upon.

in the guarding department. Hooper,
Mcßurney, and Harry Shipkey will
probably get into the game for a short
time tonight while Kerr has two good
centers in Pjggott and Steele to calP
upon.
Swede Righter's College of Pacific squad of veterans are doped to give the
Cardinal basketball varsity a great deal when the two quintets tangle on tlif
pavilion floor tonight. With five members of last year's team playing with
the Orange and Black this season, Righter has developed a team strong both
in offense and defense.
The Cardinal forwards will meet real competition in Spoon and Wagner,
who are playing their third year at guard for the College of Pacific five.
Wagner, it will be remembered, was the gent who shot thirteen out of sixteen
free throws in the bout between the two teams at the opening of the pavilion

last year. Eddie Spoon is counted upon
by Righter as the best shot on the
squad and is considered dangerous at
all angles when in possession of the
ball.
At the forward positions, llighter
will probably use Keeney, Collis, and
Bureham. Burcham and Keeney both
played on the 1922 Orange and Black
team. Keeney is fast and a good point
winner while Collis, a new man, is re
garded as a comer by the San Jose
followers of the game. Steven, who
will start the game tonight at center,
was a substitute last year but played
in the majority of the games.
Just who will start against the Meth
odists is not yet determined. McHose
has been in a suit all of this week but
is still suffering from poison oak. In
case Coach Andy Kerr decides to let
him recuperate a little more, Austin
will open the game at forward with
Captain Lefty Rogers. The showing of
A\istin this year has been a surprise
to every one. This is his first try for
the varsity and if he continues to de
velop as fast as he has in the past
two weeks, McHose will have a good
battle to retain his position on the
team.
Kerr's proteges should show a
marked improvement both in defense
and offense in the match tonight. Con
siderable stress has been placed upon
teamwork in the two days of practice
following the Alumni game. Kerr has
been working on a five-man defense
this year which the Orange and Black
will find difficult to penetrate.
Bob Janssen will start the game
in his old position at center while the
choice for guards will probably be
Fred Anderson and Oliva. Anderson
is the fastest guard on the squad and
with a little polish will soon make the
fans forget the loss of Dick Richmond.
One of the big features of the squad
this season is the large number of
able substitutes available, especially
in the guarding department. Hooper,
Mcßurney, and Harry Shipkey will
probably get into the game for a short
time tonight while Kerr has two good
centers in Pjggott and Steele to calP
upon.
