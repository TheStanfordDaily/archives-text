# A 						PROSPECTIVE WINNER

### 
It seems that basketball was the only major sport
that failed to suffer casualties in the recent annihila
tion of third-quarter probationists. It is a singular
incident that this sport of all the five majors should
come thus unscathed through the rapid fire and good
aim of the official marksmen, dispassionate and im
partial as they are. Here at least is one good chance
of the several prospects that Stanford had to make
a showing in the field of athletics. If there is any
thing in the declaration that the ordinary university
has too many athletic irons in the fire, then Stanford
has a good chance now to demonstrate what may
be done with the one iron left her. It is a source
of considerable pleasure that the hoop season is
over before the winter quarter comes to an end for
reasons that have been made obvious by very recent
experience.
With good material, already showing up well,
and a good coach, whose system is already begin
ning to assert itself, basketball looms up as a pos
sible winner this year. It is to be hoped that the
grain of comfort to be had from this source will in
some measure offset the bad effect recent scholar
ship troubles have had on the students as a whole.
