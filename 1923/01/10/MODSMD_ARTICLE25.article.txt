# THE 						DEAD COMES TO LIFE
## 
### 
C. W. Davis has taken the bad taste out of intra
mural sports. For several seasons the word "intra
mural" has been something' to laugh or to cry
about, judging by the average student's attitude.
"Intramural politics, intramural drinking, and intra
mural queening" as a current expression indicates
how far this activity had gone toward its grave.
Davis has restored the dead to life, has somehow
removed the alleged questionable features from such
competition, and is now on the road to the best
year in this department of athletics that this college
generation has seen. Perhaps the new attitude
is the result of the intermingling of class games
with inter-group competition. Perhaps it is some
other change in system. Perhaps it has something
to do with the attitude and personality of the new
•director. At any rate, there has been a decided
•change for the better. It is possible that those who
participate in the sport can explain what has hap
pened in this department.
