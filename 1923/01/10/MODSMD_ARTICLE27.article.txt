A ruling of the Executive Committee forbids the
promiscuous posting of handbills and signs over the
Campus and requires all that are properly posted to
be taken down after their term of usefulness has
expired. Posters placed about the Campus adver
tising a dance for Friday night, January 12, were
put up without the slightest idea of conforming to
regulation. One even was posted in the University
bulletin board in front of the Administration Build
ing covering an announcemet of a scholarship. At
the present rate, University officials may expect to
wake up any morning with a series of advertising
stickers slapped onto their front windows.
A rule has been made. If it means nothing to
those whose action it is intended to influence, then
it might be of benefit to all concerned if more active
enforcement measures were taken.
