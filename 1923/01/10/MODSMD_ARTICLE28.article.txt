GRADES
The fig-ures that come back on the lit-tle yell-ow card
are Grades. Why do they call them Grades? Be-cause
they are so Steep. What does the straight line after
Calculus mean? That means that the Fac-ul-ty could
not ap-prec-iate Orig-i-nal-i-ty. The D stands for pro
fan-i-ty that the Bus-i-ness Office would not let the
Instruct-or print on the Card. So does the other D. So
does the other one up above. The C means Congratu
la-tions. Do not ask us what Band A means be-cause
Cab-bages never saw any at close range.

Does one go to a jolly-up to be jollied-up? One does
not. One goes to get even with all hte Co-eds who
won't speak. Maybe they have corns —at any rate it is
worth finding out. They why do the co-eds go? They
go in hopes that you will be there and they will get a
chance to dance with you, probably. If you believe that,
you're even dumber than we thought.

The fig-ures that come back on the lit-tle yell-ow card
are Grades. Why do they call them Grades? Be-cause

Calculus mean? That means that the Fac-ul-ty could
not ap-prec-iate Orig-i-nal-i-ty. The D stands for pro
fan-i-ty that the Bus-i-ness Office would not let the
Instruct-or print on the Card. So does the other D. So
does the other one up above. The C means Congratu
la-tions. Do not ask us what Band A means be-cause
Cab-bages never saw any at close range.

you're even dumber than we thought.
