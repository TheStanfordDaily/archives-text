## 
### 
Since the alumni toppled the 1923
varsity in the first court battle of the
year last Saturday night, Cardinal sup
porters have been wondering. Garrett
Elmore, '23, dopes Stanford basketball
prospects for this season in the next
issue of Pictorial. In the rotogravure
section, there is a group picture of the
5923 hoop squad with an individual
snap of Captain "Lefty" Rogers. The
basketball schedule for the season also
appears in this issue.
"The Old Man Wins" is the title at
tached to Bill Leiser's description of
the Stanford-Pittsburgh game Decem
ber 30. A center spread of action pic
tures of the Pitt game is in the eight
page picture section.
There are two distinct contrasts in
one-act plays also in the next number
of the Pictorial. One by Henry Mack,
'24, called "Have You Anything for
the Cleaners?" represents humor. The
other, by Ruth Mcßride, '24, is en
titled, "Masculine Majority," and is a
somewhat learned discussion of fem
inine types here at Stanford. Miss
Mcßride thinks that there is one type
which comes to learn, while the other
comes for education. Learning, she
describes as the subjection of educa
tion to conditions, or the adaptation of
a person to his environment.
