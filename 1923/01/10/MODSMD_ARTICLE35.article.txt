# WORKS OF ARISTOTLE ARE NOW IN LIBRARY
## 
### 
Eight volumes of the works of Ari
stotle translated into English by Thomas
Taylor and published in London in 1811
have come into the cataloging room at
the Library this week.
The set was originally in nine volumes
and only about fifty copies of each were
printed.
This edition contains the Organum or
logic of Aristotle. The entire work is
translated immediately from the original
Greek and contains copious elucidations
from the best of Greek commentators, ac
cording to Taylor.
Aristotle was the authority of the day
on practically every subject. He has
treatises on every classification of science
though what he wrote could not be con
sidered scientific at present. Essays on
rhetoric, ethics, physics, metaphysics,
parts and motions of animals, and phil
osophical articles on life, death, youth,
dreams, and memory, are among his many
subjects.
