# CHICAGO SHEIKS TROUBLED BY CASTOR OIL IN SODAS
## 
### (By United Press 
CHICAGO, Jan. 10.â€”"Sheiks" of
Chicago were having troubles all their
own today as the result of the "re
venge" of pretty Thelma Reed.
Thelma, soda jerker in one of the
most popular "cake eater" drug stores
here, doped each "Sheik's" soda with
a lusty dash of castor oil.
Thelma's revenge was the result of
disillusionment when she married Joe
Gates in Indianapolis. Thelma de
clared that Joe vaselined his hair, car
ried a book with a long list of girls'
names and addresses, and, worst of
all, "he suggested that I get a job on
our wedding night."
So Thelma ran away and came to
Chicago where she started out to get
revenge.
Last night detectives appeared at
the drug store and took Thelma into
custody. The girl thought the police
had learned of her castor oil antics
and told the whole story. '
The police, however, had received a
telegram from Thelma's sister in Tip
ton, Ind., asking that she be held until
her arrival here.
