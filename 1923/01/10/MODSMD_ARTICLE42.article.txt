El Campo took the floor first with
Encina Hall, third floor, as their op
ponents. Penepac.ker started the scor
ing for El Campo and by half time he
and Hobro, playing the opposite for
ward, had put the game on ice with
three baskets between them. They had
little difficulty in carrying the ball
down to the basket but failed to locate
the hoop In a number of tries. Close
guarding by McKee and Steindorf and
lack of form of the Encina Hall for
wards, Silvius and Sawyer, held the
Encina team scoreless until near the
end of the half when Jackson caged
a shot from mid-floor. Hosapian, sub
; stituting for Penepacker, started the
J second half with a marker and Hobro
and Hill followed, bringing the total
up to fourteen. The game ended with
j the score 14-3.
The second game, with the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and Theta Xi teams
playing, started out with a rush and
both teams seesawed the ball up and
i down the floor for several minutes. At
half time the score stood 4-3 in favor
of the S. A. E. team. Mathews, playing
forward for the S. A. E. team, account
ed for two baskets, while Strong and
Polland made the other two for their
team. Doughty played a strong de
fensive game at standing guard and
held the Theta Xi forwards to one
i field goal. The game ended with the
j score at 10-5 for Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
El Cuadro Club put up the best ex
hibition of team play and accurate
basket shooting of the day when they
decisively defeated Encina Hall, fourth
floor, team, 24-8. Both teams fought
hard but El Cuadro always had the
edge and kept the ball in their posses
! sion most of the game. Robinson
started the scoring with three suc
i cessive baskets in as many tries. Burk
hard followed suit with two more and
one by Eggleston ended the half. En
cina Hall players were unable to score
a single point during the last half but
El Cuadro piled up six more baskets
I before the final whistle blew. Carlson
starred for the Encina team, and Rob
| inson, Burkhard, and Eggleston for El
; Cuadro.
Theta Delta Chi and Sequoia Hall,
first floor, fought the hardest game of
the day, the former leading by a com
fortable margin at the half and being
nosed out by Sequoia Hall in the last
half. The score at the half stood 10-4

in favor of Theta Delta Chi but Se
quoia Hall piled up five more baskets
in the final half and held their oppon
ents scoreless at the same time. The
game was singular in that with one
exception all the baskets made were
scored by two men. In the first half,
Barham, of Theta Delta Chi, caged five
baskets in a row and Timmons scored
the two Sequoia Hall made. But Tim
mons ran wild in the last half and
Barham seemed to tire with the result
that Timmons made four baskets and
Barham did not count once. Just be
fore the final whistle blew May caged
a pretty shot for Sequoia, making the
total 14-10 for Sequoia.
