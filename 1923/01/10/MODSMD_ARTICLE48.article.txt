Freshman swimming team have been
materially improved by the registration
of Wallace O'Connor, holder of the
Pacific Coast swimming records for
the 440 and 880 yard dashes. O'Con
nor, who has hung up a mark of 2:30
for the 220-yard, is one of the neatest
presents the Cardinal tankers have re
ceived in many a day. .Because of the
departure of Ackerman, former Babe
sprint star, O'Connor will probably be
assigned to the shorter distances,
which he can cover in splendid time.
A schedule of nine swimming meets
and one water polo match has been
tentatively drawn up, and the 1926
mermen will have every opportunity
to establish themselves in the lime
light. The meets as arranged are: Jan
