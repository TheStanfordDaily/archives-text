# Professors to Publish New Biology Text Book
## 
### 
"General Biology," a text book by
Professors L. L. Burlingame, Harold
Heath, E. G. Martin and G. J. Peirce,
which is the outcome of Biology I and
II lecture courses will soon be issued
by the publisher, Henry Holt and Com
pany. This book, which is the embodi
ment of the lectures given in General
Biology, will be used as a text.
The authors have been writing, criti
cizing, and testing the material in
cluded in this general biology for
more than two years. The work has
been gone over and revised many
times; the contents have been sifted
as experience in the course of lec
tures has suggested.
This book is distinctive from other
works on the same subject in that it
stresses function, placing emphasis on
what living things do, not upon their
structure. The thread which runs
through the whole is the interdepend
ency of organisms, especially in their
relation to mankind. According to the
authors, this work, more than any
other ever written, strives to show
this interdependency of organisms and
the relation of man to other living
things.
The work is divided into the follow
ing general sections: (1) The living
substance; (2) the role of green
plants; (3) the maintenance of life;
(4) adjustment of organisms; (5) as
sociation of organisms; (6) death; (7)
a role of microorganisms; (8) growth
and reproduction; (9) heredity; (10)
evolution; (11) distribution of organ
isms; (12) man.
The idea underlying this text has
been set forth by Professors Martin
and Burlingame in Science for May 7,
1920. This purpose is brought out in
the Preface of "General Biology":
"Biology has now reached such de
velopment that it comprises a large
amount of information and knowledge
which is not only of the first practical
importance to the layman but is also
susceptible of being organized into a
coherent set of principles suitable for
presentation to hte ordinary freshman
or to the lay public. This necessarily
involves principles rather than fac
tual details and limits discussion to
such tpoics as do not put an undue
strain on the reader's knowledge of
related sciences such as physics, chem
istry and geology."
