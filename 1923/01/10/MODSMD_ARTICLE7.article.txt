UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS—Letters
to parents of all Texas University stu
dents were dispatched by President
Vinson of the University just before
Christmas, stating that in the future
no students would be permitted to
maintain cars on the campus. A num
ber of replies have been received ex
pressing approval of the measure and
willingness to cooperate with the au
thorities in its enforcement.
The large number of cars filled with
students seen on the campus on the
following registration day, however,
have started much speculation among
the campus loungers as to whether the
new regulation could or would be ef
fectively enforced. Much has been said,
and much more will be said concern
ing just how the University Regents
will enforce their order, but no overt
violation has yet been made to fur
nish a test case. The editorial policy
of the University newspaper favors
either repeal or strict enforcement.
The University of Oklahoma has
also decreed that no midnight oil shall
be consumed by combustion
motors, and has appointed "Uncle
Ben," the college sleuth, to drag of
fenders to justice.
