# COLLEGE OF PACIFIC TIGERS ARE TAMED BY CARDINAL FIVE
## Righter's Squad of Basketers Are Able to Score But Two Field Goals Against Stanford Team 
### 
Coach Swede Righter's College of Pacific five ran into a snag last night
when they tried to penetrate the defense put up by Andy Kerr's quintet and
as a result the Cardinal team tamed the Tigers in easy order, 18 to 9. Only
two field goals were registered by the Methodists during the contest, these
being long shots from the middle of the floor.
Coach Andy Kerr's statement that he had a team of fifteen men instead
of five was well proved in the game last night. Substitutes were continually
streaming upon the court but at no time was there a slackening in the play.
Righter also used a number of men in the second half.
The game started out rather rough and a large number of personal fouls
were called on both teams in the first five minutes' of play. During the
greater part of the time the ball was in Stanford's possession but it was some
time before a field goal was marked up by the Cardinal forwards. Righter's

squad took the lead at the opening of
the bout when Wagner dropped in two
free throws followed a short time af
terwards with a field goal by Stevens
from the center of the court.
Cards Show Clever Passing
Clever passing on the part of Austin,
Rogers and Janssen opened up the of
fensive for Stanford and field goals by
Rogers and Anderson coupled with
free throws by Austin ended the half
with the score 10 to 5 in favor of the
Cardinal. Austin was not 4 playing up
to his usual standards in the first half
and over-anxiety cost him a couple of
easy baskets.
Nip Mcllose, playing in Austin's
place, opened the second half with a
couple of spectacular field goals. Nip,
although only in for a short time,
proved a big factor in the Cardinal
scoring machine with his dribbling and
passing. He was taken out in the mid
dle of the half to give Fred Koba, the
diminutive forward, a chance to show
what he could do.
Wealth of Running Guard Material
In Shipkey and Fred Anderson, Kerr
has a wealth of material in running
guards. The playing of Anderson in
the first half was one of the features
or' the game. The fast little guard
seemed always to be at the right place
at the right time and some fast drib
bling on his part accounted for two
points just before the half ended.
Hooper and Mcßurney also got into
the game a short tirpe before it ended.
