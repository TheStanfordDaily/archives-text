## 
### 
San Jose High School's fast court quin- j
tet outplayed the Stanford freshmen last
night and defeated them 14-7 in a ragged
contest.
The Cardinal babes found out that to ;
win a basketball game they must suc
ceed in dropping the ball through the >
hoop. And that seemed to be almost
impossible for them last night. The ball
was in the high school team's territory :
most of the time, but the freshman for
wards could not pile up the necessary !
i points.
Early in the first quarter of play, the
babes took the lead on field goals by
: Nevers and Frazier. Ward and Woods j
each sunk one for San Jose and the score
was tied at 4-4 where it remained for the
| rest of the first period. In the second j
! quarter, the high school team took a five
| point lead which was never threatened.
In this period. Ward, who played a good
game at center, dropped three field goals
while the babes were making a single
point. The half ended with the score
standing 10-5 in favor of San Jose.
Both teams slowed up in the second
; half and played a defensive game. The
babes made a single field goal while the
I high school team made two.
The freshmen were outplayed during
| most of the game. Fumbles lost them
chances to scorc many times, while the
San Jose lads were at their best under
I the basket.
The teams lined up as follows:
Freshmen San Jose;
Nevers 112 Minshall
| Frazier 112 Woods
