# BRANDSTEN SPRING BOARD ADOPTED BY SWIMMING CIRCLES
## 
### 
Swimming Coach Ernst Brandsten's
standardized diving spring-board, which
he recently developed to obviate the dif
ficulties divers have in competition in
strange pools, has been almost unani
mously adopted by colloges and athletic
organizations in the United States.
The Intercollegiate Swimming Associa
tion, which controls the various organi-;
zations of colleges throughout the coun
try will require the universities to install |
the board. Columbia, New York, Yale,
Princeton, Cornell, West Point and An
napolis as well as all colleges on the Pa
cific Coast are already equipped. The |
New York Athletic Club, Illinois Ath
letic Club, Olympic Club, Multnomah
Club, and Los Angeles Athletic Clubs
and the beaches and swimming pools
around San Francisco are using it.
The spring board is made of clear ver
tical grain Oregon pine, instead of the
usual hickory or ash. Brandsten finds
the pine equal if not superior to the more
expensive woods. It comes in two sizes.:
One for indoor pools, where a short
head piece must be used, measures thir- :
teen feet long, twenty inches wide, and j
three inches thick. This is tapered at the
forward end to one and a half inches. It
is set about one meter above the surface j
of the water: The outdoor board is of ,
the same dimensions except that it is j
sixteen feet long, and is set at two
heights, one meter and three meters.
Brandsten was assisted in getting the j
board adopted by Louis Ballbach, '16, :
now a student at Columbia.
