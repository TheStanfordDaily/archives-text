# UTAH UNIVERSITY HAS NOVEL CONVENIENCE

### 
A dispatch from the University of
Utah gives statistics of a curious insti
tution that is constantly used but not
spoken of. It is the sewing basket in
Dean Van Cott's office. Several years
ago it cost the treasury $2.75. Now,
whenever a man or woman is so inclined
he may present "Aunt Luncy with a
nickel, after using the basket and when
enough has collected, the depleted
stock is replenished.
It is estimated that at least twelve girls
a day, and some men (Dean Van Cott.
has never had the heart to count how
many) find the little basket necessary. A
rumor is about to the effect that a dig
nified member of the faculty once had
to recur to it to save his dignity. And
that not being able to wield the needle
without danger to himself the kindly
Dean of Women took pity on him and
sewed up the hole.
