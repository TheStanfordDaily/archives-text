# THE 						EDUCATION FOUR
## 
### 
"The Education Four is the greatest ear on earth—
not for the money because money won't buy it—
but yet the greatest car. We do not sell it to you on
a money basis. We sell it to you on principle. The
demand for this machine exceeds the supply but we
do not sell to the highest bidders. We sell to those
who operate the machine according to the best stand
ards. The supply ? Why, we turn out about 600 ma
chines a year but we expect to increase our out-put
in the next few years when the factory is enlarged.
We have just started a selling force on the road
with three million dollars in Education Four stock.
And we've already raised a third of it from old car
owners themselves."
The Superintendent of the Factory, proudly sur
veying a demonstrator's model, is in the middle of
the busiest moment of the day—anytime. His office is
overflowing with a single visitor —a man who looks
as if he might well use an unlimited number of cars.
Me is like nobody in particular and yet is like every
body in general. The Superintendent knows him
well; seems to have sold him cars before. His
visitor's name is Public.
The visitor speaks. His worst nature seems to
have the upper hand this morning. "Seems to me,"
he rumbles, "that I hear a knocking in your engine."
lie is right. The engine IS knocking.
The Superintendent puts an expert ear to the
hood. He straightens to a great height—touches a
button. "Shop Foreman," he says to his secretary.
The Foreman enters and makes a hasty inspec
tion. "Cylinder number one is knocking," is his
diagnosis.
"Why?"
"Too small a bore. No room for natural action."
"Why, aren't all the measurements alike?"
"The other three cylinders want Number One to
do the work."
"Then if the other bores are larger this knocking
comes from the other cylinders' efforts to force the
first. Equalize the bore on all cylinders."
The Sophomore, Junior, and Senior cylinders at
this point make a great deal of noise and seem about
to split the engine block. The casting is strong,
however, and the engine continues to run. The
knocking subsides—dies completely out. The engine
purrs smoothly.
"You get results quickly." Public smiles. "Put
me down for five bund "
The engine is picking up speed. It races madly.
It sounds as if it were running away with itself.
Loud squeaks and rattles are heard. Public begins
to sidle toward the door, expecting an explosion.
"One moment, please." The Shop Foreman is
called in again.
"What's wrong now?" The Superintendent is
annoyed.
"Too much of that new Text Book Gas," growls
the Foreman. "Trying to get too much work out of a
four-cylinder engine. That stuff was made only
for sixes and eights."
"I hear a grinding noise. What's that?"
The Foreman listens intently. "That last ship
ment of Restriction Oil," he groans. "Too much
of it."
The Superintendent turns a screw. The grinding
noise ceases. He turns another. The engine slows
down. "Turn it back toward the same place a little
at a time," he says. "Adjustments will be necessary.
"Don't go too fast with anything new, especially if
it is just recovering from internal friction."
The Superintendent turns. "Now about that
order "
Public dubiously inspects the quietly humming en
gine. "Mighty touchy sort of a critter," he grumbles,
frowning. "Likely to bust into pieces most any time.
And yet "
The room is suddenly filled with a tremendous
racket. Sounds of scurrying feet are heard outside
as their owners scramble for shelter. It seems that

the plant is about to blow up. The visitor grows
pale as the Foreman dashes madly in, shouting,
"Holy Cats! Somebody's taken the governor off the
gas feed and a big piece has been blown out of every
cylinder!"
"Is that all ?"
"No. Somebody put a shot of hip oil in the auto
matic lubricator."
"Is that all?"
"No. Somebody stirred up a lot of scandal in
the shop."
"Well, is THAT all?" •
The guest holds up his hands in horror. "Your
engine needs too many trouble shooters," he de
clares, "and besides, it's unsafe." He turns to leave.
A terrific report almost deafens him. Pieces of ma
chinery fall about, his ears. Panic-stricken, he dives
under the Superintendent's desk. He moans and
asks himself why he ever came near this Factory.
"All clear. Come on out," says the Superintendent
persuasively.
Public tremblingly creeps from under the desk.
"Wh-wh-what th ?" He stares uncomprehend
inglyl atl the model engine. It is intact —running
smoothly, merrily. "I thought it blew up," gasps
Public.
The Superintendent laughs. "That was a neigh
boring explosion," he explains. "That happens about
once a week. And so, by comparison, you may see
for yourself "
"That's enough. Sign me up for all the cars you
can turn out for the next five hundred years," and
Public leaves the office, thankful that he is not a
Factory Superintendent.

as if he might well use an unlimited number of cars.
Me is like nobody in particular and yet is like every
body in general. The Superintendent knows him
well; seems to have sold him cars before. His
visitor's name is Public.
The visitor speaks. His worst nature seems to
have the upper hand this morning. "Seems to me,"
he rumbles, "that I hear a knocking in your engine."
lie is right. The engine IS knocking.
The Superintendent puts an expert ear to the
hood. He straightens to a great height—touches a
button. "Shop Foreman," he says to his secretary.
The Foreman enters and makes a hasty inspec
tion. "Cylinder number one is knocking," is his
diagnosis.
"Why?"
"Too small a bore. No room for natural action."
"Why, aren't all the measurements alike?"
"The other three cylinders want Number One to
do the work."
"Then if the other bores are larger this knocking
comes from the other cylinders' efforts to force the
first. Equalize the bore on all cylinders."
The Sophomore, Junior, and Senior cylinders at
this point make a great deal of noise and seem about
to split the engine block. The casting is strong,
however, and the engine continues to run. The
knocking subsides—dies completely out. The engine
purrs smoothly.
"You get results quickly." Public smiles. "Put
me down for five bund "
The engine is picking up speed. It races madly.
It sounds as if it were running away with itself.
Loud squeaks and rattles are heard. Public begins
to sidle toward the door, expecting an explosion.
"One moment, please." The Shop Foreman is
called in again.
"What's wrong now?" The Superintendent is
annoyed.
"Too much of that new Text Book Gas," growls
the Foreman. "Trying to get too much work out of a
four-cylinder engine. That stuff was made only
for sixes and eights."
"I hear a grinding noise. What's that?"
The Foreman listens intently. "That last ship
ment of Restriction Oil," he groans. "Too much
of it."
The Superintendent turns a screw. The grinding
noise ceases. He turns another. The engine slows
down. "Turn it back toward the same place a little
at a time," he says. "Adjustments will be necessary.
"Don't go too fast with anything new, especially if
it is just recovering from internal friction."
The Superintendent turns. "Now about that
order "
Public dubiously inspects the quietly humming en
gine. "Mighty touchy sort of a critter," he grumbles,
frowning. "Likely to bust into pieces most any time.
And yet "
The room is suddenly filled with a tremendous
racket. Sounds of scurrying feet are heard outside
as their owners scramble for shelter. It seems that

the plant is about to blow up. The visitor grows
pale as the Foreman dashes madly in, shouting,
"Holy Cats! Somebody's taken the governor off the
gas feed and a big piece has been blown out of every
cylinder!"
"Is that all ?"
"No. Somebody put a shot of hip oil in the auto
matic lubricator."
"Is that all?"
"No. Somebody stirred up a lot of scandal in
the shop."
"Well, is THAT all?" •
The guest holds up his hands in horror. "Your
engine needs too many trouble shooters," he de
clares, "and besides, it's unsafe." He turns to leave.
A terrific report almost deafens him. Pieces of ma
chinery fall about, his ears. Panic-stricken, he dives
under the Superintendent's desk. He moans and
asks himself why he ever came near this Factory.
"All clear. Come on out," says the Superintendent
persuasively.
Public tremblingly creeps from under the desk.
"Wh-wh-what th ?" He stares uncomprehend
inglyl atl the model engine. It is intact —running
smoothly, merrily. "I thought it blew up," gasps
Public.
The Superintendent laughs. "That was a neigh
boring explosion," he explains. "That happens about
once a week. And so, by comparison, you may see
for yourself "
"That's enough. Sign me up for all the cars you
can turn out for the next five hundred years," and
Public leaves the office, thankful that he is not a
Factory Superintendent.
"The Education Four is the greatest ear on earth—
not for the money because money won't buy it—
but yet the greatest car. We do not sell it to you on
a money basis. We sell it to you on principle. The
demand for this machine exceeds the supply but we
do not sell to the highest bidders. We sell to those
who operate the machine according to the best stand
ards. The supply ? Why, we turn out about 600 ma
chines a year but we expect to increase our out-put
in the next few years when the factory is enlarged.
We have just started a selling force on the road
with three million dollars in Education Four stock.
And we've already raised a third of it from old car
owners themselves."

"Then if the other bores are larger this knocking
comes from the other cylinders' efforts to force the
first. Equalize the bore on all cylinders."
The Sophomore, Junior, and Senior cylinders at
this point make a great deal of noise and seem about
to split the engine block. The casting is strong,
however, and the engine continues to run. The
knocking subsides—dies completely out. The engine
purrs smoothly.
"You get results quickly." Public smiles. "Put
me down for five bund "
The engine is picking up speed. It races madly.
It sounds as if it were running away with itself.
Loud squeaks and rattles are heard. Public begins
to sidle toward the door, expecting an explosion.
"One moment, please." The Shop Foreman is
called in again.
"What's wrong now?" The Superintendent is
annoyed.
"Too much of that new Text Book Gas," growls
the Foreman. "Trying to get too much work out of a
four-cylinder engine. That stuff was made only
for sixes and eights."
"I hear a grinding noise. What's that?"
The Foreman listens intently. "That last ship
ment of Restriction Oil," he groans. "Too much
of it."
The Superintendent turns a screw. The grinding
noise ceases. He turns another. The engine slows
down. "Turn it back toward the same place a little
at a time," he says. "Adjustments will be necessary.
"Don't go too fast with anything new, especially if
it is just recovering from internal friction."
The Superintendent turns. "Now about that
order "
Public dubiously inspects the quietly humming en
gine. "Mighty touchy sort of a critter," he grumbles,
frowning. "Likely to bust into pieces most any time.
And yet "
The room is suddenly filled with a tremendous
racket. Sounds of scurrying feet are heard outside
as their owners scramble for shelter. It seems that

the plant is about to blow up. The visitor grows
pale as the Foreman dashes madly in, shouting,
"Holy Cats! Somebody's taken the governor off the
gas feed and a big piece has been blown out of every
cylinder!"
"Is that all ?"
"No. Somebody put a shot of hip oil in the auto
matic lubricator."
"Is that all?"
"No. Somebody stirred up a lot of scandal in
the shop."
"Well, is THAT all?" •
The guest holds up his hands in horror. "Your
engine needs too many trouble shooters," he de
clares, "and besides, it's unsafe." He turns to leave.
A terrific report almost deafens him. Pieces of ma
chinery fall about, his ears. Panic-stricken, he dives
under the Superintendent's desk. He moans and
asks himself why he ever came near this Factory.
"All clear. Come on out," says the Superintendent
persuasively.
Public tremblingly creeps from under the desk.
"Wh-wh-what th ?" He stares uncomprehend
inglyl atl the model engine. It is intact —running
smoothly, merrily. "I thought it blew up," gasps
Public.
The Superintendent laughs. "That was a neigh
boring explosion," he explains. "That happens about
once a week. And so, by comparison, you may see
for yourself "
"That's enough. Sign me up for all the cars you
can turn out for the next five hundred years," and
Public leaves the office, thankful that he is not a
Factory Superintendent.
"The Education Four is the greatest ear on earth—
not for the money because money won't buy it—
but yet the greatest car. We do not sell it to you on
a money basis. We sell it to you on principle. The
demand for this machine exceeds the supply but we
do not sell to the highest bidders. We sell to those
who operate the machine according to the best stand
ards. The supply ? Why, we turn out about 600 ma
chines a year but we expect to increase our out-put
in the next few years when the factory is enlarged.
We have just started a selling force on the road
with three million dollars in Education Four stock.
And we've already raised a third of it from old car
owners themselves."
The Superintendent of the Factory, proudly sur
veying a demonstrator's model, is in the middle of
the busiest moment of the day—anytime. His office is
overflowing with a single visitor —a man who looks
as if he might well use an unlimited number of cars.
Me is like nobody in particular and yet is like every
body in general. The Superintendent knows him
well; seems to have sold him cars before. His
visitor's name is Public.
The visitor speaks. His worst nature seems to
have the upper hand this morning. "Seems to me,"
he rumbles, "that I hear a knocking in your engine."
lie is right. The engine IS knocking.
The Superintendent puts an expert ear to the
hood. He straightens to a great height—touches a
button. "Shop Foreman," he says to his secretary.
The Foreman enters and makes a hasty inspec
tion. "Cylinder number one is knocking," is his
diagnosis.
"Why?"
"Too small a bore. No room for natural action."
"Why, aren't all the measurements alike?"
"The other three cylinders want Number One to
do the work."
"Then if the other bores are larger this knocking
comes from the other cylinders' efforts to force the
first. Equalize the bore on all cylinders."
