Hugo, the midnight moth, punched the clock on the
nose and took time out, shooting the following three

Walter Christie, California coach of track, speaking on
the football situation before Oakland Order of De Molay,
said last night, "I am thankful for the Pittsburgh
Panthers that they did not play Andy Smith's Golden
Bears. I am thankful that they did not play Andy
Smith's second squad.
"Gonzaga played in the south recently. We have
twelve teams that can beat Gonzaga.
"Diverging slightly, I am glad that Stanford's varsity
squad did not play Berkeley High School this year.
Berkeley had a strong team."

Gabriel Gluntoose, Ursur major in probation, speaking
before the California Chapter, Order of Arcadia, said at
midnight: "Divulging slightly, I am glad, glad, glad,
for the Berkeley Broons that I did not take that 7-unit
course in Muscle Manipulation. I went to a class re
cently. If it had been that one, just think of the average
I would have wrecked!"

Him: I hear that Reggie's girl has money to burn.
Her: Yes. She's looking for a match.
