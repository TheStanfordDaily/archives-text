The pendulum is now swinging the
other way. Last quarter every dra
matic undertaking on the campus was
of a light and airy nature, with the
motto chosen apparently being "the
lighter the better." This quarter sees
a change in exactly the opposite direc
tion. Furthermore, there seems to be
unanimity of sentiment on the advisa
bility of the change. Too much of any
one thing is enough, as the commit
tees who choose the plays have
learned.
Masquers will start the turn about
face of the dramatic march on Janu
ary 26, when they present "He Who
Gets Slapped," a drama straight from
the boards of New York, written by
the Russian playwright, Leoned And
reyev.
The word "drama" is used advisedly,
for that best describes the production.
The demarcation line between a com
edy and a tragedy is very faint and
thin, and this show is on or near that
line. In Continental Europe nobody
bothers to distinguish between a "com
edy" and a "tragedy"—they call it a
"drama," if it deserves that name, and
let it go at that. It saves a lot of
useless defining, and Masquers' pro
duction can well do without that. "He
Who Gets Slapped" has its heavy
spots and its light spots.
Ram's Head has also joined partially
into the swing of the "higher level"
march. Just what this statement
means will not be made public until
Mike Ely and Phil Newill finish the
details of the show they are now
writing. Dan Evans has furnished an
other one of his entertaining plots,
and the combination of that with the
work of Newill and Ely should pro
duce something the campus will be
anxious to see.
"Higher level" does not, of course,
mean that Ram's Head will abandon
their traditional comedy type. But it
will be a different kind of comedy
from last year, and likewise from that
of the year before. What will it be?
Ah-h-h-h! That is the mys-s-s-stery! as
the stalwart policeman always re
marks in a stage whisper to the beauti
ful heroine in the middle of the last
act in all well-regulated mystery plays.
Apropos of nothing in particular,
just what is a stage whisper? Should
it be loud enough to be heard in the
$1.10 seats, and not quite forcible
enough to reach the 75-cent custom
ers? Or is it based on pitch—say, a
booming bass, or a wavering soprano?
A course in Stage Whispers should
prove interesting, if not instructive.
For the best answer to the problem of
"What is a stage whisper?" this col
umn will make no reward whatsoever.

edy" and a "tragedy"—they call it a
"drama," if it deserves that name, and
let it go at that. It saves a lot of
useless defining, and Masquers' pro
duction can well do without that. "He
Who Gets Slapped" has its heavy
spots and its light spots.
Ram's Head has also joined partially
into the swing of the "higher level"
march. Just what this statement
means will not be made public until
Mike Ely and Phil Newill finish the
details of the show they are now
writing. Dan Evans has furnished an
other one of his entertaining plots,
and the combination of that with the
work of Newill and Ely should pro
duce something the campus will be
anxious to see.
"Higher level" does not, of course,
mean that Ram's Head will abandon
their traditional comedy type. But it
will be a different kind of comedy
from last year, and likewise from that
of the year before. What will it be?
Ah-h-h-h! That is the mys-s-s-stery! as
the stalwart policeman always re
marks in a stage whisper to the beauti
ful heroine in the middle of the last
act in all well-regulated mystery plays.
Apropos of nothing in particular,
just what is a stage whisper? Should
it be loud enough to be heard in the
$1.10 seats, and not quite forcible
enough to reach the 75-cent custom
ers? Or is it based on pitch—say, a
booming bass, or a wavering soprano?
A course in Stage Whispers should
prove interesting, if not instructive.
For the best answer to the problem of
"What is a stage whisper?" this col
umn will make no reward whatsoever.

The pendulum is now swinging the
other way. Last quarter every dra
matic undertaking on the campus was
of a light and airy nature, with the
motto chosen apparently being "the
lighter the better." This quarter sees
a change in exactly the opposite direc
tion. Furthermore, there seems to be
unanimity of sentiment on the advisa
bility of the change. Too much of any
one thing is enough, as the commit
tees who choose the plays have
learned.
Masquers will start the turn about
face of the dramatic march on Janu
ary 26, when they present "He Who
Gets Slapped," a drama straight from
the boards of New York, written by
the Russian playwright, Leoned And
reyev.
The word "drama" is used advisedly,
for that best describes the production.
The demarcation line between a com
edy and a tragedy is very faint and
thin, and this show is on or near that
line. In Continental Europe nobody
bothers to distinguish between a "com
edy" and a "tragedy"—they call it a
"drama," if it deserves that name, and
let it go at that. It saves a lot of
useless defining, and Masquers' pro
duction can well do without that. "He
