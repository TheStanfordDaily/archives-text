Stanford's basketball team will be rep
resented for the first time in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Games have been ar
ranged with teams in the California-
Nevada league and with the winners of
the state titles in Oregon and Washing
ton. A series has also been scheduled
with California.
That Stanford's traditional "democ
racy" is "largely clap trap and is too
often the snobbishness of unaspiring
mediocrity," is the assertion made in the
holiday number of the "Alumnus" by an
anonymous graduate. The writer recom
mends the "weeding out of puerile tradi
tions at Stanford." State universities,
professional football coaches, and the so
called "elective system" are also attacked.
Declaring that he had found the first
year of his presidency entertaining, Presi
dent Wilbur opened the first assembly of
the year this morning, with a general
survey of the problems confronting the
University, and expressed satisfaction

with the scholarship standing of Stanford
at the present time.
"Dad" Mercer, who resigned his posi
tion as patrolman of the Quad last semes
ter to take up chicken raising, is hack at
his old job today. His chick farm failed
to realize the huge profits that he thought
would raise him into the ranks of the
"nouveau riche."
Stanford's local phone service has been
increased in extent and usefulness. No.
900 will work from 7 a. m. to 11 p. m.
hereafter instead of stopping at 6 p. m.
It will remain closed all day Sunday.
The first band dance of the semester
will be held in the Armory in Palo Alto.
The latest rag and musical comedy hits
will be played. Prospects for a good
musical organization are unusually bright
this year.
