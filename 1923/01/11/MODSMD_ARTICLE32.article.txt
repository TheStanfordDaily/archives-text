# ART EXHIBIT OPEN TO STANFORD STUDENTS
## 
### 
Stanford students, upon presenta
tion of their registration cards, will be
admitted for the nominal sum of ten
cents to an exhibition of contemporary
French Art, consisting of 497 exam
ples of painting and sculpture, now
open in Polk Hall (the west end of the
Civic Auditorium) in San Francisco.
The exhibition includes the work of
the best-known French artists of the
last twenty-five years. Not all of them
are adequately represented, but never
theless the trend of art during the past
decade is easily apparent and for this
reason the exhibition is important. Of
especial value are canvases by Vuil
lard, Henri-Matisse, Manguin, Lebas
que, Bonnard and others which show
a conception of color which was little
used in the Exposition of 1915.
Among the sculptors are found Ro
din and his greatest pupil, Antoine
Bourdelle.
Some of the best-known San Fran
cisco artists are sponsoring the exhibi
tion and feel that it deserves careful
study. It is open from 10 a. m. to 10
p. m., daily, Sundays included, closing
on January 31st.
