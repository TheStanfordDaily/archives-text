## 
### 
Walter Camp, noted football critic
gave the Wolverines unusual honors last
week when he named three Michigan men
on his all-American football selection.
Harry Kipke, captain-elect of the Varsity,
was given one of the half back positions
on the first team. Bernard Kirk won an
and berth on the second team and Irwin
Uteritz was selected to pilot the third
team which was picked by Camp.
Michigan was the only school which
placed three men on the mythical elevens.
Harvard, Princeton, Annapolis, West
Point, lowa and California and Yale each
placed two men and the remainder of the
honored athletes were chosen from 16
different schools. It is noticed that 11
different schools are represented on each
team and that Michigan is the only
school to have one man on each.
