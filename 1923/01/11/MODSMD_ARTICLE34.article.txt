# ZOOLOGY CLUB HEARS DR. JORDAN ON FISHES
## 
### 
Personal experiences in deep sea-fish
ing and an exposition of the cultured
pearl industry in Japan were recounted
by Dr. Jordan in his talk,-"Confessions
of an Ichthyologist," to the Zoology Club
last evening at the Kappa Alpha Theta
house.
In commenting upon the rise of the
cultured pearl industry, he stated that
on account of harmful pests, the pearl
yield this year amounted only to $600,-
000. An interesting feature of the indus
try, Dr. Jordan said, was the use of
women divers instead of men.
