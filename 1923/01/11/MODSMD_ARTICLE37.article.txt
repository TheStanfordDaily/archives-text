# CALIFORNIA STADIUM CONSTRUCTION GOES AHEAD AFTER DELAY
## 
### 
After a long period of delay, the con
struction of the California stadium is at
last going ahead. The objections of prop
erty owners, real estate people, civic au
thorities, and faculty have been met.
Approximately two hundred men are
engaged in excavating and clearing the
land. Supply sheds are being erected,
and steam shovels are beginning to dig
into the earth.
California hopes to have the stadium
ready in time for the 1923 Big Game
and construction is going ahead full blast.
The stadium is being constructed in
Strawberry canyon. It will be a concrete
structure in the shape of a bowl, with
wooden seats.
