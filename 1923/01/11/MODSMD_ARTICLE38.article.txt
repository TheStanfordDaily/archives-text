# COLLEGE OF JOURNALISM PLAN AT SOUTHERN BRANCH OF U.C.
## 
### 
S. B. U. C. â€”The board of regents at
the University of California, Southern
Branch, are considering the proposi
tion of installing a College of Journal
ism at the Los Angeles plant. A reso
lution urging this step has been pre
sented by the Junior Scribes Club of
Los Angeles, and the opinion of this
body is that in all probability the re
quest will be granted. The college
could be worked out with very little
expense, and would be of great value
to Southern California journalism.
