# Stanford Graduate Sows 276-Acre Field in Plane
## 
### 
A dispatch from Tracy tells of the
sowing of a 276-acre field of grain by
airplane, the pilot being Fauna W. Farris,
a Stanford graduate.
Twenty of the 276 acres had been cov
ered in the first half-day, the seed being
released from a height of 100 feet. A
swath fifty feet wide was covered.
The owner of the field estimated that
the cost at $1 an acre as against 10c
when the sewing is done by horses.
