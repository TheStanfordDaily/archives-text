### 
"There always has been and always
will be an aristocracy of brains," de
clared President Ernest Martin Hopkins
in an address before the Boston Chamber
of Commerce at the Copley-Plaza Hotel
December 21..
Included in the audience were three
college presidents—Lemuel H. Murlin of
Boston University, Frank P. Speare of
Northeastern University, and John A.
Cousens of Tiffts. Governor Cox of
Massachusetts '01 headed a delegation of
prominent Dartmouth alumni.
"All through history," continued
President Hopkins, "it has been the
aristocracy of brains which has come
to the assistance of the world. Only as
the aristocracy of brains is enlarged and
the instruments of education, which are
our schools and colleges, work for that,
will the world find peace and health."
At another point in his address, Presi
dent Hopkins referred to his quoted state
ments that too many young men go to
college. He explained by that statement
that he never meant that all who wished
should have the opportunity to go to
college, but rather that men should go in
for other forms of higher education than
generally comprehended in a strictly col
lege course.
"The more different colleges can keep
themselves from their fellows," he said,
''the better it will be for mankind at
large."
