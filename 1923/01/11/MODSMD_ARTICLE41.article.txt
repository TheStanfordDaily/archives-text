# COLLINS OUTINES JUNIOR COMMITTEE WORK AT MEETING
## 
### 
Work for the Junior Committee re
cently appointed by Junior Collins '24,
was outlined at a class meeting held this
afternoon in Room 214. Lou Minsky
'23, chairman of the Senior Committee,
spoke to the juniors concerning the work
of the seniors in regard to helping solve
the problems before the student body.
Minsky recommended that the Junior
Committee begin work at once, as a sub
sidiary body to the Senior Committee.
This, he pointed out, would help in the
forwarding of the solution to the ques
tions now before the senior body. Upon
a motion, seconded and carried, it was
decided that the Junior Committee would
act in the .manner that Minsky proposed.
A meeting of the committee was an
nounced for next Monday afternoon in
Room 214.
Following Minsky's speech, Charles
White and Carl Shoup spoke on the situ
ation as regards the special junior edi
tions of the 1924 Quad. White outlined
the financial side of the work accom
plished so far on the year-book, and an
nounced the last day of January as the
closing date for payment of the $7.00
necessary to secure a junior edition.
White also mentioned phases of the work
connected with the tryoutees, advertise
ments, and general disbursements.
Shoup outlined the nature of the in
sert which will be the feature of the
junior edition. It will consist of eight
pages, and will contain reproductions of
the signature of every class member who
pays his $7.00 before February 1. In ad
dition, there will be color work featured,
besides other material which will be put
in the eight pages. In order to get the
signatures to he reproduced, the first two
weeks of February will be devoted to
this purpose by the Quad office. Each
junior will be expected to call at the
office, starting February 1, and sign his
name with special India ink and paper
which will be provided for that purpose.
At the end of the two weeks the list will
be closed and sent up to the Commercial
Art Engraving Company of San Fran
cisco for zinc etching.
Dan Gage, class manager, spoke on the
manner in which the 1924 debt is being
rapidly reduced. Gage said that by the
end of this year, the debt with interest
should be fully paid, with some surplus
over for the senior year. Bookstore
coupons continue to be a substantial
source of incomc, said Gage, nearly $400
for one year's collection being the ex
pected amount. The dance given the
night of the Pittsburgh game did not
draw as well as had been anticipated, due
to the unusually small attendance at the
football game.

'23, chairman of the Senior Committee,
spoke to the juniors concerning the work
of the seniors in regard to helping solve
the problems before the student body.
Minsky recommended that the Junior
Committee begin work at once, as a sub
sidiary body to the Senior Committee.
This, he pointed out, would help in the
forwarding of the solution to the ques
tions now before the senior body. Upon
a motion, seconded and carried, it was
decided that the Junior Committee would
act in the .manner that Minsky proposed.
A meeting of the committee was an
nounced for next Monday afternoon in
Room 214.
Following Minsky's speech, Charles
White and Carl Shoup spoke on the situ
ation as regards the special junior edi
tions of the 1924 Quad. White outlined
the financial side of the work accom
plished so far on the year-book, and an
nounced the last day of January as the
closing date for payment of the $7.00
necessary to secure a junior edition.
White also mentioned phases of the work
connected with the tryoutees, advertise
ments, and general disbursements.
Shoup outlined the nature of the in
sert which will be the feature of the
junior edition. It will consist of eight
pages, and will contain reproductions of
the signature of every class member who
pays his $7.00 before February 1. In ad
dition, there will be color work featured,
besides other material which will be put
in the eight pages. In order to get the
signatures to he reproduced, the first two
weeks of February will be devoted to
this purpose by the Quad office. Each
junior will be expected to call at the
office, starting February 1, and sign his
name with special India ink and paper
which will be provided for that purpose.
At the end of the two weeks the list will
be closed and sent up to the Commercial
Art Engraving Company of San Fran
cisco for zinc etching.
Dan Gage, class manager, spoke on the
manner in which the 1924 debt is being
rapidly reduced. Gage said that by the
end of this year, the debt with interest
should be fully paid, with some surplus
over for the senior year. Bookstore
coupons continue to be a substantial
source of incomc, said Gage, nearly $400
for one year's collection being the ex
pected amount. The dance given the
night of the Pittsburgh game did not
draw as well as had been anticipated, due
to the unusually small attendance at the
football game.

cently appointed by Junior Collins '24,
