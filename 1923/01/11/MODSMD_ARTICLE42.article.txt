# Washington Women Advise Early Marriage for Girls
## 
### 
Girls should marry young, very
youngâ€”before they are 21 if possible,
according to co-eds at the University
of Washington.
The girls say that marriage is like
any other venture and that you should
start early so that if you don't succeed
you can try, try again.
