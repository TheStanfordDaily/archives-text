WASHINGTON, Jan. 11.â€”Whether
the American government will take
any further steps in the European
crisis following the orders for with
drawal of American troops from Ger
many, is problematical and largely de
pends on developments and circum
stances.
Further action by the United States
is made extremely difficult because of
official knowledge that France is now
determined to carry out her great ex
periment of occupation of the Ruhr to
make Germany pay and that nothing
will swerve the government at Paris.
Plans continued to be rushed for
ward at the war and state depart
ments for the immediate evacuation of
the small American army of occupa
tion from the Rhine, ordered with
dramatic suddenness yesterday.
A resolution urging recall of Roland
W. Boyden, American unofficial repre
sentative on the reparations commis
sion, will be introduced in the senate
in a short time. The senate will be
asked to take a position on Boyden's
recall similar to that it expressed last
week on recall of American troops
from Europe.
