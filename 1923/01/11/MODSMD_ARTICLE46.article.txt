# BOWSER TO CAPTAIN 1923 PITTSBURG FOOTBALL TEAM
## 
### 
Charlie Bowser, who acted as captain
of the Pittsburg football team during the
whole of the past season, has been elected
to captain the Pitt team next year. It
had been announced that this was Bows
er's last year owing to the new three-year
playing rule but the rule was not made
to apply to those who started playing
before the change. As a result Bowser
will play next season at his old position

at center and his right guard, Sack, will
also return, these two men being the
only ones remaining in school who can
play for four years. Twenty-four var
sity letters were awarded to members of
this year's football squad.
"Tubby" McEwen of Lexington, Ne
braska, has been re-elected captain of
the Louisiana State University football
team for 1923.
