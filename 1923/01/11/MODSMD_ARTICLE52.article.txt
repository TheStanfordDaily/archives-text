# STATE SENATE SPLIT OVER APPOINTMENTS
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Cal. Jan. 11.â€”
Possibility of the Senate shearing Lieu
tenant-Governor Young of the right of
naming committees in the upper house of
the California legislature was believed
far removed today.
Threat of a split in the senatorial
ranks, as sharply cleft as that which di
vided the assembly over the selection of
a speaker, was not expected to develop
over the committee question. Although ;
the power to name this legislature's com
mittees has not been voted the senate
president, senators stated that this is due -
only to the fact that the matter has not;
yet been brought before them.
President Young is understood to be
going ahead with his committee selections
with the possibility that they will be an- <
nounced within the next 48 hours, always
providing the senate votes him the au- !
thority, which it is expected to do soon.
This legislature is beginning to be one
of surprises, however, and none of the j
upper house lawmakers are laying any
wagers one way or the other over the
possibility of a disruption in their ranks
over the committee question.
