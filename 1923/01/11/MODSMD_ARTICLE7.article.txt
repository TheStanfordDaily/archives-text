# FIVE INTRAMURAL BASKETBALL TEAMS START WITH WINS
## El Tigre Spectacular Victor Over Phi Kappa Psi Five in Extra-Period Contest 
### 
El Tigre, in defeating the strong Phi
Kappa Psi team, furnished the thrill
in intramural basketball yesterday af
ternoon in the Pavilion when they
won an overtime contest by the score
of 17-14. Delta Upsilon, Delta Chi,
Alpha Tau Omega, and Alpha Kappa
Lambda were the other winners in
their opening contests in the intra
mural tournament which started at the
first of the week.
The El Tigre-Phi Kappa Psi contest
started out fast and Woodhead for El
Tigre and Wittenberg for Phi Kappa
Psi scored in the first few minutes.
Close guarding prevented more goals
on both sides and a fast and accurate
passing game kept the men on the
move. The teams were evenly matched
throughout the game and the forwards
alternated in caging their shots. At
the end of the half Woodhead had
scored three times and Kennedy, his
mate at forward, once. Wittenberg
made two goals and Newlin one for
Phi Kappa Psi at the same time.
The second half began as fast as the
first one, the score standing at 9-8 for
El Tigre. Kennedy shot a field goal
and sent El Tigre farther into the lead
but baskets by Newlin and Knox with
a free throw by McAllister put Phi
Kappa Psi ahead. Just as the game
ended Cota made a free throw and tied
the score. By agreement an overtime
period of five minutes was played.
Woodhead immediately opened up on
the basket at long range and Â§hot two
goals in several tries from mid-floor.
Phi Kappa Psi was unable to overcome
the lead and the game ended with the
score 17-14 in favor of El Tigre.
Kappa Sigma started scoring early
in their game with Delta Upsilon and
Tex Middleton scored five field goals
before the half was up. At the same
time the Delta Upsilon players had
only been able to make one field goal
which Boles tossed in early in the
game. With the score standing 10-3
against them at the beginning of the
second half, the Delta Upsilon men
opened up and three consecutive bas
kets by Boles, one by Green, and one
by Black, with a free toss, put Delta
Upsilon in the lead. Middleton, who
had caged several spectacular shots in
the first half tired quickly and was j
unable to make any further score. Hey
made the only points Kappa Sigma I
scored in the last period. Clark and
Miller played as strong a game at
guard for Delta Upsilon as Hey and
Ward did in the first half. Lacey
finished the scoring by two free throws
and a field goal. The final count gave
Delta Upsilon the game at 17-12 after
a brilliant comeback in the second
half.
Delta Chi won their game from Phi
Delta Theta, 10-8. Neither team
showed effective passing or accurate
basket shooting. Driscoll scored two
field goals for Phi Delta Theta and
with Logan did the best playing for
their team. Suffern and Tritle shot
two baskets each for Delta Chi and
with two free throws were able to
keep ahead of Phi Delta Theta. Both
teams displayed a fast brand of basket
ball but speed was not coupled with
the accurate passing necessary to
make it effective in the scoring
column.
Phelps and Dorrestein, by scoring
two field baskets each, put the game
away for Alpha Tau Omega when they
met the Zeta Psi team. The Zeta Psi
players showed a lack of condition and
practice in playing together. Their
passing was fast but far from accur
ate, numbers of passes going out of
bounds or into the hands of Alpha Tau
Omega players. Taylor and Stratton
guarded their basket closely and pre
vented any scoring by Zeta Psi from
the field route except one basket by
Loskamp. Post and Cravens both
guarded well for Zeta Psi in the first
minutes of play, but the game was
too fast for them and the Alpha Tau
Omega men got down closer to the
basket as the game progressed. Neil
caged a pretty shot for Alpha Tau
Omega and the game ended with the
score 12-3.
Alpha Kappa Lambda piled up the
highest score of the tournament when
they defeated the weak El Capitan
team 37-11. Howe started the scoring
for Alpha Kappa Lambda on the first
play and he, with Sloane, Hardwicke,
Cornell, and Vanderburgh, continued
to drop shots through the basket until
the half ended with the score 21-G in
their favor. The march down the floor
continued in the second half with
Cornell and Howe starring. Walker,
playing forward for El Capitan, did all
their scoring, shooting four field goals
and three free throws. The Alpha
Kappa Lambda team showed up well
but found very little resistance in the
El Capitan guarding and was easily
able to roll up the points.
