## SITUATION RELIEVED BY FRENCH RETIREMENT TO SUBURBS OF ESSEN 
### (By United Press 
The bulk of the invading forces had
been withdrawn to the suburbs. The
absence of tanks, armored cars and
machine guns was marked. German
traffic police were in charge through
out the city.
Surprised at the absence of war-like
demonstrations, citizens of Essen, who
had acted sullenly when the city first
was seized, were apparently engrossed
in an effort to master their resent
ment. Stiff German smiles were ex
changed as occasional groups of
French officers appeared.
"There will be no further advance
by French troops in the Ruhr unless
Germany provokes such a move," Gen
eral De Goutte, commanding the Ruhr
occupation forces, declared today in
an interview at Essen with the corres
pondent of the Evening News.
PARIS, Jan. 12. —France has modi
fied her plan for collecting cash repar
ations from Germany and is willing to
consider a moratorium on a basis pro
posed by Premier Mussolini of Italy,
it was learned from semi-official
sources today. The next payment is
due Monday.
The reparations commission will
meet tomorrow to consider Germany's
request for a moratorium. A majority
vote will decide, so if France, Belgium
and Italy agree, Great Britain cannot
hinder their move. (This refers to
cash reparations, not reparations in
kind which the French entered Ruhr
to collect).
France and Belgium today sent ex
perts to study measures for forcing
coal deliveries from the Ruhr.
Hugo Stinnes, Dr. Krupp von Bohlen
and other coal barons of the Ruhr
today ignored the Franco-Belgian "in
vitation" —in reality an order —to at
tend a meeting on coal distribution.
Germany Still Pacific
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12.—Germany
lias given her word to the United
States that as a result of the French
occupation of the Ruhr, she will not
"meet violence with violence."
This, and the fact that Germany de
clares she will not renounce the Ver
sailles treaty were the outstanding
points in a note from the Berlin gov
ernment which protested against
French invasion of the Ruhr.
NEW YORK, Jan. 12—France's re
ported willingness to modify her plan
for collecting cash reparations and to
consider a moratorium for Germany
was looked upon as indicating a lessen
ing of tension in the foreign situation
and stocks were higher at the opening (
today.
