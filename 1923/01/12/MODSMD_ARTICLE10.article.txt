# L.E. Bassett Will Give Reading Of Drama “Herod”
## 
### 
"Herod," by the late Stephen Phil
lips, the English poet-dramatist, will
be the subject of a reading by Profes
sor Lee Emerson Bassett, head of the
Department of Public Speaking, next
Tuesday evening in the Little Theater
at 7:30.
The drama, which deals with the life
of the great Herod of New Testament
times, was presented with phenomenal
; success in London several years ago
by the famous British actor, Sir Her
bert Beerbohm-Tree, for whom the
play was originally written. It was
produced with settings of great splen
dor, and had an unusually long run in
England.
"Herod" has never been presented
in this country, probably because it is
so distinctly a one-character play, Pro
fessor Bassett believes. Its attractive
features, aside from the clear portray
al of Herod, the king, are the strong,
, well-handled dramatic situations, and
the music of the blank verse, which is
: said to be particularly beautiful.
