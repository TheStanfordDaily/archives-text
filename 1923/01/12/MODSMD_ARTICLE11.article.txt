# ALABASTER WILL DIRECT MUSIC FOR RAMâ€™S HEAD SHOW
## 
### 
Lewis Alabaster has been selected as
j director of the music for the Ram's Head
i Show February 16. He will have com
' plete charge of this branch of the pro
duction. All selection of music and lyrics,
and their arrangement to harmonize with
the play as a whole, will be under his
I direction.
Alabaster will take up the director's
i baton for the first time in the forthcom-
I
ing play. He has been well known to
! the campus music world, both as a player
; and a student of music.
Nathan Tyroler will assist Alabaster
| and will play the piano both during re
j hearsals and for the final productions.
Selection of the cast will commence
Monday. Preliminary tryouts will start
at 2:00 in the Assembly Hall, according
to Director Arnold Bayley, and will con
tinue until 10:00. On Tuesday the hours
."will be from 2 :00-5 :30. Bayley wishes
to emphasize the necessity for those try
ing out being at the Assembly Hall early
in the day, if possible, in order to avoid
j the rush around the dinner hour.
A large cast is needed for the play, and
there is good opportunity for new mate
rial to develop litre. Men who can take
female parts are especially needed, but
( the tryouts are not limited in that respect.
The play, written by Mike Ely and
Phil Newill around a plot furnished by
Dan Evans, promises something new both
in style of presentation and in theme, al
though the central idea of the plot is be
ing kept a dark secret. "A Connecticut
Yankee, Backwards," is all that the au
thors will release on the subject.
