# ROUGHâ€™S DAY IS MODIFIED BY HEW COUNCIL RULING
## Tradition Is Doomed Thinks Dr. Wilbur; Mob Activity Threatens Student Control 
### 
No class cutting, no men in women's
dress, no annoying of women or faculty
members, and none of the accustomed
activities of the day will be observed on
the Quad, at Rough's Day next year, ac
cording to regulations of the Men's Coun
cil issued today.
The action of the Men's Council, in
regulating future Rough's Days was taken
because of the conduct of certain students
on Rough's Day last quarter.
The activities of the day are to Lie
confined to the undergraduate men of the
University and others must not be drawn
into the spirit of the day by coercion,
under the new regulations.
President Wilbur has accepted the
regulations laid down by the Men's Coun
cil, but, in a statement to the Council he
says that he believes that Rough's Day
is doomed and the sooner it is eliminated
the better. Wilbur asserts that Rough's
Day "is an invitation to mob activity on
the part of the students."
The regulations governing future
Rough's Days as laid down by the Men's
Council are as follows:
Roughs' Day is a tradition of long
standing in the University and one which
we feel should be perpetuated. In order
that it survive as a tradition and accom
plish its original purpose the following
rules and regulations must be adhered to:
1. The activities of the day are to be
confined to the undergraduate men of the
student body. The utmost respect must
be shown all visitors and persons not
connected with the student body who arc
in no way to be considered as partici
pants.
2. Members of the faculty must also
be shown due respect. Any attempt to
force faculty members through abuse or
coercion to enter into the spirit of the
day will not be tolerated.
.3 Women students must not be an
noyed in any way, and dressing in
women's clothes will not be permitted.
The utmost courtesy and respect must
be shown them and any ridiculing or
abusive language or any ungentlemanly
conduct will be severely dealt with.
4. Class attendance must be kept in
violate. Absences arc not excused on
this day any more than on any other day.
5. The activities of the day must not
take place within the Quad or in any of
the University buildings. Noise outside
classrooms which interfere with class
work will not be tolerated.
6. Property of the University or indi
viduals must in no way be molested or
destroyed.
7. As set forth in the constitution of
the Men's Council (Art. 5, Sect. 1), it
becomes the duty of the Senior Class to
see that Rough's Day is carried out*in a
proper and gentlemanly manner.
Any infractions of the above regula
tions will subject violators to dismissal
from the University upon the recom
mendation of the Men's Council.
President Wilbur's letter to the Men's
Council in regard to these regulations is
given in full below:
Mr. Alfred R. Masters,
Secretary Men's Council,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Masters:
I have gone over the regulations gov
erning Roughs' Day proposed by the
Men's Council for Student Control. If
lived up to it seems to me that they will
prevent a recurrence of the disgraceful
proceedings of this year. I am perfectly
willing to accept the regulations of the
Men's Council, but I feel compelled to
give you my judgment in the matter.
I think that Roughs' Day is doomed
and the sooner that it is eliminated the
better for all concerned, particularly for
student control. It is an invitation to
mob activity on the part of the students.
The control of mobs has been one of the
most difficult problems in all democracies.
When a group is turned loose, free from
the ordinary inhibitions and without lead
ership, it is inevitable that trouble will
follow sooner or later. The students, it
seems to me, should only sanction events
that are properly organized and conducted
under leadership and in the light of day.
Experience everywhere has shown that
night events, such as the poster fight, and
day events, without leadership, such as
Roughs', Day, inevitably land upon the
rocks. Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty and of good government as well.
When these rules are enforced the pres
ent Council will be no longer active. A
new group, without experience and past
responsibility, will have the problems to
meet. It is the function of those who go
before to make it easier for those who
follow not to repeat the same errors.
Thanking you and your associates for
the careful consideration given this mat
ter, I am
Very sincerely yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President.

No class cutting, no men in women's
dress, no annoying of women or faculty
members, and none of the accustomed
activities of the day will be observed on
the Quad, at Rough's Day next year, ac
cording to regulations of the Men's Coun
cil issued today.
The action of the Men's Council, in
regulating future Rough's Days was taken
because of the conduct of certain students
on Rough's Day last quarter.
The activities of the day are to Lie
confined to the undergraduate men of the
University and others must not be drawn
into the spirit of the day by coercion,
under the new regulations.
President Wilbur has accepted the
regulations laid down by the Men's Coun
cil, but, in a statement to the Council he
says that he believes that Rough's Day
is doomed and the sooner it is eliminated
the better. Wilbur asserts that Rough's
Day "is an invitation to mob activity on
the part of the students."
The regulations governing future
Rough's Days as laid down by the Men's
Council are as follows:
Roughs' Day is a tradition of long
standing in the University and one which
we feel should be perpetuated. In order
that it survive as a tradition and accom
plish its original purpose the following
rules and regulations must be adhered to:
1. The activities of the day are to be
confined to the undergraduate men of the
student body. The utmost respect must
be shown all visitors and persons not
connected with the student body who arc
in no way to be considered as partici
pants.
2. Members of the faculty must also
be shown due respect. Any attempt to
force faculty members through abuse or
coercion to enter into the spirit of the
day will not be tolerated.
.3 Women students must not be an
noyed in any way, and dressing in
women's clothes will not be permitted.
The utmost courtesy and respect must
be shown them and any ridiculing or
abusive language or any ungentlemanly
conduct will be severely dealt with.
4. Class attendance must be kept in
violate. Absences arc not excused on
this day any more than on any other day.
5. The activities of the day must not
take place within the Quad or in any of
the University buildings. Noise outside
classrooms which interfere with class
work will not be tolerated.
6. Property of the University or indi
viduals must in no way be molested or
destroyed.
7. As set forth in the constitution of
the Men's Council (Art. 5, Sect. 1), it
becomes the duty of the Senior Class to
see that Rough's Day is carried out*in a
proper and gentlemanly manner.
Any infractions of the above regula
tions will subject violators to dismissal
from the University upon the recom
mendation of the Men's Council.
President Wilbur's letter to the Men's
Council in regard to these regulations is
given in full below:
Mr. Alfred R. Masters,
Secretary Men's Council,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Masters:
I have gone over the regulations gov
erning Roughs' Day proposed by the
Men's Council for Student Control. If
lived up to it seems to me that they will
prevent a recurrence of the disgraceful
proceedings of this year. I am perfectly
willing to accept the regulations of the
Men's Council, but I feel compelled to
give you my judgment in the matter.
I think that Roughs' Day is doomed
and the sooner that it is eliminated the
better for all concerned, particularly for
student control. It is an invitation to
mob activity on the part of the students.
The control of mobs has been one of the
most difficult problems in all democracies.
When a group is turned loose, free from
the ordinary inhibitions and without lead
ership, it is inevitable that trouble will
follow sooner or later. The students, it
seems to me, should only sanction events
that are properly organized and conducted
under leadership and in the light of day.
Experience everywhere has shown that
night events, such as the poster fight, and
day events, without leadership, such as
Roughs', Day, inevitably land upon the
rocks. Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty and of good government as well.
When these rules are enforced the pres
ent Council will be no longer active. A
new group, without experience and past
responsibility, will have the problems to
meet. It is the function of those who go
before to make it easier for those who
follow not to repeat the same errors.

Roughs', Day, inevitably land upon the
rocks. Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty and of good government as well.
When these rules are enforced the pres
ent Council will be no longer active. A
new group, without experience and past
responsibility, will have the problems to
meet. It is the function of those who go
before to make it easier for those who
follow not to repeat the same errors.
Thanking you and your associates for
the careful consideration given this mat

Very sincerely yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President.
No class cutting, no men in women's
dress, no annoying of women or faculty
members, and none of the accustomed
activities of the day will be observed on
the Quad, at Rough's Day next year, ac
cording to regulations of the Men's Coun
cil issued today.
The action of the Men's Council, in
regulating future Rough's Days was taken
because of the conduct of certain students
on Rough's Day last quarter.
The activities of the day are to Lie
confined to the undergraduate men of the
University and others must not be drawn
into the spirit of the day by coercion,
under the new regulations.
President Wilbur has accepted the
regulations laid down by the Men's Coun
cil, but, in a statement to the Council he
says that he believes that Rough's Day
is doomed and the sooner it is eliminated
the better. Wilbur asserts that Rough's
Day "is an invitation to mob activity on
the part of the students."
The regulations governing future
Rough's Days as laid down by the Men's
Council are as follows:
Roughs' Day is a tradition of long
standing in the University and one which
we feel should be perpetuated. In order
that it survive as a tradition and accom
plish its original purpose the following
rules and regulations must be adhered to:
1. The activities of the day are to be
confined to the undergraduate men of the
student body. The utmost respect must
be shown all visitors and persons not
connected with the student body who arc
in no way to be considered as partici
pants.
2. Members of the faculty must also
be shown due respect. Any attempt to
force faculty members through abuse or
coercion to enter into the spirit of the
day will not be tolerated.
.3 Women students must not be an
noyed in any way, and dressing in
women's clothes will not be permitted.
The utmost courtesy and respect must
be shown them and any ridiculing or
abusive language or any ungentlemanly
conduct will be severely dealt with.
4. Class attendance must be kept in
violate. Absences arc not excused on
this day any more than on any other day.
5. The activities of the day must not
take place within the Quad or in any of
the University buildings. Noise outside
classrooms which interfere with class
work will not be tolerated.
6. Property of the University or indi
viduals must in no way be molested or
destroyed.
7. As set forth in the constitution of
the Men's Council (Art. 5, Sect. 1), it
becomes the duty of the Senior Class to
see that Rough's Day is carried out*in a
proper and gentlemanly manner.
Any infractions of the above regula
tions will subject violators to dismissal
from the University upon the recom
mendation of the Men's Council.
President Wilbur's letter to the Men's
Council in regard to these regulations is
given in full below:
Mr. Alfred R. Masters,
Secretary Men's Council,
Stanford University, Cal.
Dear Mr. Masters:
I have gone over the regulations gov
erning Roughs' Day proposed by the
Men's Council for Student Control. If
lived up to it seems to me that they will
prevent a recurrence of the disgraceful
proceedings of this year. I am perfectly
willing to accept the regulations of the
Men's Council, but I feel compelled to
give you my judgment in the matter.
I think that Roughs' Day is doomed
and the sooner that it is eliminated the
better for all concerned, particularly for
student control. It is an invitation to
mob activity on the part of the students.
The control of mobs has been one of the
most difficult problems in all democracies.
When a group is turned loose, free from
the ordinary inhibitions and without lead
ership, it is inevitable that trouble will
follow sooner or later. The students, it
seems to me, should only sanction events
that are properly organized and conducted
under leadership and in the light of day.
Experience everywhere has shown that
night events, such as the poster fight, and
day events, without leadership, such as
Roughs', Day, inevitably land upon the
rocks. Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty and of good government as well.
When these rules are enforced the pres
ent Council will be no longer active. A
new group, without experience and past
responsibility, will have the problems to
meet. It is the function of those who go
before to make it easier for those who
follow not to repeat the same errors.
Thanking you and your associates for
the careful consideration given this mat
ter, I am
Very sincerely yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President.
