# ROUGH’S DAY IS MODIFIED BY HEW COUNCIL RULING
## Tradition Is Doomed Thinks Dr. Wilbur; Mob Activity Threatens Student Control 
### 
No class cutting, no men in women's
dress, no annoying of women or faculty
members, and none of the accustomed
activities of the day will be observed on
the Quad, at Rough's Day next year, ac
cording to regulations of the Men's Coun
cil issued today.
The action of the Men's Council, in
regulating future Rough's Days was taken
because of the conduct of certain students
on Rough's Day last quarter.
The activities of the day are to Lie
confined to the undergraduate men of the
University and others must not be drawn
into the spirit of the day by coercion,
under the new regulations.
President Wilbur has accepted the
regulations laid down by the Men's Coun
cil, but, in a statement to the Council he
says that he believes that Rough's Day
is doomed and the sooner it is eliminated
the better. Wilbur asserts that Rough's
Day "is an invitation to mob activity on
the part of the students."
The regulations governing future
Rough's Days as laid down by the Men's
Council are as follows:

standing in the University and one which
we feel should be perpetuated. In order
