# Professor B.0. Fosterâ€™s Livy Translation Arrives
## 
### 
The second volume of the transla
tion of Livy's Histories by Professor
B. O. Foster of the Classical Litera
ture department has been received.
The third volume is now on the press
in London and will be available soon.
The entire work will demand thirteen
volumes, when complete. Professor
Foster is one of three Stanford pro
fessors who have contributed to this
series of translations of Greek and
Latin authors for the Loeb Classical
Library. Dr. Murray has made the
translation of the "Odyssey" and is
now at work upon the "Iliad," while
Dr. Fariclough made a translation of
Vergil's works and has recently been
asked to translate the "Satires and
Epistles" of Horace.
