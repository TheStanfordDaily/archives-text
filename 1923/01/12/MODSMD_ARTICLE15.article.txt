# SIGMA NU WINS FROM KAPPA ALPHA TEAM
## 
### 
Nothing was able to stop the Sigma
Nu intramural basketball team last
night in their game with Kappa Alpha
and they took the contest by a score
of 41-6, the largest win in the intra
mural series to date. The Sigma Nu
contest was by far the prettiest ex
hibition of basketball displayed by any
of the four winners of yesterday's in
tramural games, although Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Sigma
Chi all outclassed their opponents.
The Sigma Nu scoring machine
started caging their shots early and
continued to add to the score until
the end of the game. Aydelotte starred
for the Sigma Nu outfit and caged
neraly every shot fed to him by Thede,
playing center, and Bragg, playing the
opposite forward. Up to half time he
had counted five times and Thede an
equal number, Bragg making three
shots good. At the same time, "Long
and Dwight guarded the Kappa Alpha
forwards so closely that only one field
goal was chalked up to their credit,
Beeson making the count.

Long opened the second half with a
pretty basket caged after making a
long run and clever dribble from his
guard position. A moment later he
made another marker on a pass from
Aydelotte. Thede and Bragg again fed
the ball to Aydelotte who scored six
more points from the field before the
end of the game.
Beeson made the only points Kappa
Alpha was credited with, scoring two
I additional baskets in the final half of
I the contest.
The Delta Tail Delta-Alpha Sigma
j Phi game which the former Avon 15-7
! was close until after half time when
Meyers, Delta Tau Delta forward, and
Collett, center, shot three baskets and
gave their team a lead which Ferguson
and Welch, Alpha Sigma Phi forwards,
could not overcome.
Campbell made a good try to even
the score by shooting two field goals in
the second period but his teammates
failed to follow suit and the game was
lost. Both Campbell and Ferguson
covered the floor well for Alpha Sigma
Phi but the accuracy of Meyers on
shots from the floor kept the Delta
Tau Delta team well in front and in
no particular danger of defeat.
Phi Kappa Sigma presented a fairly
well-rounded team, all of their players
being of equal ability and spede. A
good brand of teamwork with slow
but accurate passing allowed the for
wards to work the ball down under
the basket and score often enough to
win the game 15-5. The Chi Psi team
was slow in getting started and none
of the four forwards taking part in the
game was sufficiently accurate on bas
ket-shooting to pile up much of a
score. Cook made one basket and Hays
the other for the Chi Psi team.
Thomas scored most often for Phi
Kappa Sigma making three field goals
and three free throws during the
game, Crandall, Cohen, and Coult
liurst each made one basket and all
played the ball and covered their men
well.
Another upset of the season and re
versal of the half time results was the
game between Sigma Chi and Sequoia
Hall, second floor, teams. Sequoia led
4-1 at the half but the men were tired
during the second half by their exer
tions and could not hold the Sigma
Chi forwards in check, allowing them
to score and win, 11-7.
Shaw, playing forward under the
basket for Sigma Chi, could not locate
the hoop in the first half and his team
mates were just as powerless. But
with the start of the final period the
Sigma Chi team made a strong spurt
which carried them through to victory.
Shaw scored three times and Campbell
twice, both men missing shots by
inches on other attempts. Parker kept
down the Sequoia score by close guard
ing and permitted only one basket to
get by him during the second half.
Clark and Brazil scored the four
points for Sequoia in the first period
but Cole was the only one to break
loose in the final half and register,
making one field goal and one free
throw.
The guarding of the Sigma Chi team
was the feature of the game. At the
start it looked like only a question
of when the Sigma Chi forwards would
get their eyes on the basket and put
a few of their close shots through the
hoop. But the guarding weakened after
the first few minutes and Sequoia took
advantage of the opening and made
their scores.
In the second half the guarding was
as strong as ever and Sequoia had
only one or two chances during the
whole half to get within the foul line,
all shots at the basket being made
from mid-floor.
Today's games as scheduled are:
Encina Hall, fifth floor, and El Toro,
5 p. m.; Los Arcos and Theta Chi, 5:40
p. m.
