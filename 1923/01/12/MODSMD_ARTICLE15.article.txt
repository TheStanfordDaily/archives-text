# SIGMA NU WINS FROM KAPPA ALPHA TEAM
## 
### 
Nothing was able to stop the Sigma
Nu intramural basketball team last
night in their game with Kappa Alpha
and they took the contest by a score
of 41-6, the largest win in the intra
mural series to date. The Sigma Nu
contest was by far the prettiest ex
hibition of basketball displayed by any
of the four winners of yesterday's in
tramural games, although Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Sigma
Chi all outclassed their opponents.
The Sigma Nu scoring machine
started caging their shots early and
continued to add to the score until
the end of the game. Aydelotte starred
for the Sigma Nu outfit and caged
neraly every shot fed to him by Thede,
playing center, and Bragg, playing the
opposite forward. Up to half time he
had counted five times and Thede an
equal number, Bragg making three
shots good. At the same time, "Long
and Dwight guarded the Kappa Alpha
forwards so closely that only one field
goal was chalked up to their credit,
Beeson making the count.

Long opened the second half with a
pretty basket caged after making a
long run and clever dribble from his
guard position. A moment later he
made another marker on a pass from
Aydelotte. Thede and Bragg again fed
the ball to Aydelotte who scored six
more points from the field before the
end of the game.
Beeson made the only points Kappa
Alpha was credited with, scoring two
I additional baskets in the final half of
I the contest.
The Delta Tail Delta-Alpha Sigma
j Phi game which the former Avon 15-7
! was close until after half time when
Meyers, Delta Tau Delta forward, and
Collett, center, shot three baskets and
gave their team a lead which Ferguson
and Welch, Alpha Sigma Phi forwards,
could not overcome.
Campbell made a good try to even
the score by shooting two field goals in
the second period but his teammates
failed to follow suit and the game was
lost. Both Campbell and Ferguson
