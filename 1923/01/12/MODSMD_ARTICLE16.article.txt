# STANFORD VARSITY SQUAD WILL BATTLE OLYMPIC CLUB FIVE
## Cardinal â€“ Clubmen Match is Doped To Be Fast; San Francisco Team Boasts Veteran Aggregation 
### 
With a two-day rest after tlieir game with the College of Pacific five, the
Stanford varsity will take on the Olympic Club unlimited quintet tomorrow
night in the Pavilion. The game will begin promptly at 8 o'clock, immediately
following the Freshman-Lowell High bout.
The Olympic Club squad, an aggregation that has always been a source of
trouble to past Stanford varsities, is made up of practically the same players
that faced the 1922 Cardinal five. Lauterwasser, who accounted for the
majority of the points in last year's match, will be in the lineup for the
Clubmen, as will his running mate, Gavin. Boyle is doped to start the game
at center for the Olympics.
Although the showing of the Stanford team in the College of Pacific game
was an improvement over their first start, they will encounter trouble unless
they watch their passing game more. In the contest Wednesday, several

hurried passes went to their oppon
ents, which, had they been playing a
I stronger aggregation, might have
I counted for points.
1 Austin, at present, is troubled with
a bad leg and in all probability Nip
MeHose will start at his old position
Saturday. Janssen was also limping in
practice yesterday afternoon with a
bad ankle so he may not start although
both Janssen and Austin will be used
later 011 in the game. Kerr was using
both Steele and Pigott in the first,
string lineup at center yesterday.
Steele's condition has been bothering
him lately and when he rounds into
mid-season form, he can be counted
upon to put up a good battle for the
first team job.
Fred Anderson and Dave Oliva ap
pear to be Kerr's selection for the
guard positions to start the game
against the Olympics. Harry Shipkey
and A1 Hooper will be on deck to go
into the game in case Kerr decides to
use them.
The game tomorrow will be a battle
of speed against speed. The Olympic
Club five have a light squad but one
that is noted for speed in covering the
court. With a record of having played
together foi four years, the Cardinal
defense has a dangerous combination
to battle in the Gavin, Lauterwasser.
Boyle trio. Boyle is noted for his long
shots and will be a problem for the
Stanford guards if he starts finding
the range on the baskets tomorrow
night.
