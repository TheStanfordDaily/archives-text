# FRESHMAN QUINTET WILL MEET LOWELL
## 
### 
If the workout Coach Hunt's fresh
man basketball squad went through
last night means anything, the Lowell
High School five is in for a bad time
Saturday night.
The Cardinal yearlings are still
smarting from the 14-7 defeat handed
them Wednesday night by the San
Jose High School and are aching to
take out their spite on somebody. It
looks as if the Bay City lads might
be that somebody.
Hunt had his charges working hard
last night placing most of the em
phasis on the scoring department for
it was the inability to find the basket
that beat the Babes Wednesday night.
The squad went through thirty min
utes of hard scrimmage in addition to
some practice in dribbling, passing,
and shooting.
Frazier is the only man on the in
jured list and he may not be able
to play Saturday. He has a badly
sprained thumb which kept him out
of practice last night. Hunt had
Peery and Morrison working in the
big forward's place but neither of
them seem to fit in as does Frazier.
The latter can play either guard or
forward and will be missed if he is
kept off the floor for very long.
Several new men reported for prac
tice last night and Hunt is hopeful
that among them, he may find a man
who is a consistent point-maker. A
forward who is sure of his shots for
the basket would fit into the yearling
aggregation nicely at present.
