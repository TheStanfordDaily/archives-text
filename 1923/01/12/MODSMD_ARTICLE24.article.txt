# HEREâ€˜S A LAUGH

### 
Whether the fact that Stanford has lost some of
her football players caused recent unique observa
tions to be made by Occidental College authorities is
not known, but it is obvious, judging by the remarks
in question, that Stanford is not a big leaguer in
athletics. In notifying U. S. C. of her intention to
abandon the annual football game with the 1 rojans,
the coach of Occidental declared that Henderson's
men were too strong and in the next breath an
nounced his intention of signing a two-year agree
ment with Stanford. As yet no predictions have
been made by the southern college as to the size
of the probable one-sided score their team will roll
up against Stanford next year. However, Andy
Kerr will try to the best of his ability to stave off a
land-slide and may even upset what seems to be
the dope and lose only by six or seven touchdowns.
At any rate there is comfort to be had in the
thought that after the expiration of the two-year
agreement, Stanford may send a similar letter to
the southern college, regretting that they are "too
strong," and will take a set-up in the shape of a
Harvard or Yale eleven.
