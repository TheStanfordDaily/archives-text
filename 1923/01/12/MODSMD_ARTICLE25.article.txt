"The utmost secrecy prevails in the administrative
building at the University of California, at Berkeley,
regarding the personnel of the 561 students who
failed at the close of the fall semester. It is rumored
that no prominent college athletes are numbered in
the list of "flunkies."
"This is attributed by university officials to the
close watch kept upon the scholarship standings of
members of the various teams throughout the college
semester, which tends to guard against such a fiasco
as took place at Stanford last week when seven of
the University's most prominent athletes were
dropped for academic failure."
The above information was placed before the
public by a San Francisco newspaper Wednesday
morning. This news is at once strange and
cheering.
Many Stanford people would like to be initiated
into the mysteries of this secret agency which keeps
such close watch upon the "scholarship standings of
the various teams throughout the college semester."
It certainly seems to be efficient. However, there
must be something more to the story. Nobody has
been keeping any closr watch on athletes than
Stanford people, but it hasn't done any good. At
•Stanford at least fifteen athletes are lost in the
student total of eighty-five. At California, one ath
lete is rumored to have been lost out of a total of
561. Some watchmen! Some athletes! Some
students!
