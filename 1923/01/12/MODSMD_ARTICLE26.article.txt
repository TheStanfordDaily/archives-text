# A 						WORD TO THE ROUGHS IS SUFFICIENT

Regulations laid down by the Men's Council for
the guidance of students during Rough's Day cere
monies, if properly enforced, should be a sound
guarantee against the recurrence of indiscreet, not
to say outrageous, incidents which took place last
quarter. The trouble in the past has arisen from a
lack of rules. The trouble of the future will lie in
the enforcement of them. Dr. Wilbur has pointed
out in his letter to the Men's Council that the reten
tion of student control may possibly depend upon
the success of the new regulations. He thinks that
Rough's Day is doomed. We hope not. It strikes
the ordinary student that there has been altogether
too much dooming and damning these last few
years. There is a way out if that same ordinary
student cares to see it.
A lack of continuity in student offices and rec
ords, a j>oor memory for history, and short-sighted
administration, will tend during each year of student
government to accumulate a list of wrongs that
will eventually end in the abolition of student gov
ernment on what appears on the face of the matter
to be a single count, if drastic and immediate meas
ures are not taken. The past may not be forgotten,
the present may not be neglected, and the future
may not be ignored. No government can last long
if it has no vision. Problems of the future must
be studied and measures must be taken to solve
them. A year-to-year administration with new ideas,

but little background, and no co-operation from the
student body which is usually not interested in the
future, is in constant danger of disruption. These
are ticklish times. Unless Stanford students want
to see faculty control reassumed it is time to forego
a few choice pleasures of the present for the sake
of the future.
In the case of Rough's Day, the Junior Class
would make no mistake by beginning to learn some
thing of the duties which it must undertake next
year. Upon senior supervision and control rests
the destiny of student government, not upon the ef
ficiency of the Men's Council, which acts chiefly as
an agency of cure of individual cases rather than
one of prevention of a common fault. If this is a
democracy, then let its members keep it one.
