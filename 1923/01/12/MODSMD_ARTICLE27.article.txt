DIRGE
(With no apologies whatsoever)
Break, break, break,
On thy cold grey stones, oh sea!
And I would that my tongue could utter
The things that the profs ask me.
Oh well for the fisherman's boy,
That he shouts with his sister at play;
Oh well for instructors' pets,
That they know what is comnig each day!
And the stately ships pass on,
To their haven under the hill;
Though the profs pass by, they never pass me,
And my classmates are passing me still!
Break, break, break.
At the foot of thy cliffs, oh sea!
But the memorized facts of a course long dead,
Will never come back to me.
