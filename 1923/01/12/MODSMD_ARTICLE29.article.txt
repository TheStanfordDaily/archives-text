# German War Conditions Are Shown in Documents
## 
### 
German documents, which have re
cently been received by the Hoover
War Library, set forth in a concrete
manner the economical conditions that
prevailed in Germany during the war
period and the period of reconstruc
tion. Official reports tell the extent of
the scarcity of food and what efforts
were made by the government in com
batting famine by the distribution of
foodstuffs and the issuing of food
cards.
The large case of material contains
an entire collection of originals of all
orders, proclamations, placards, and
posters concerning German economic
life and national economy during the
period of blockade, 1914-1919, which
were issued by the War Raw Materials
Department of the German Ministry
of War. There are about 1500 of these
documents which are illustrative of
war conditions and efforts of the Ger
man government to nullify the eco
nomic measures of its enemies.
All forms of food cards issued in
Berlin from the beginning of the ra
tioning of the population until the ra
tion regulations of the Greater Berlin
are represented. Supplementing this
division are all the forms and printed
documents of the Bread Commission.
