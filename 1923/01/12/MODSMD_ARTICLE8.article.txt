# AID FOR ATHLETES OF POOR STANDING IS URGED BY NESTORIANS
## 
### 
A more strict probation system and |
a better feeling of co-operation be
tween athletes and the rest of the stu
dents was the substance of the forum
discussion at the meeting of Nestoria
last night. The informal debate was
prompted by the recent disqualifica
tion of eighty-five Stanford students,
many of them widely known on the j
campus.
Citing the example of Michigan
where the students take an active in
terest in all athlete sof low academic ;
standing by rendering voluntary aid,
one student recommended that such
a feeling of co-operation be adopted
here at Stanford.
It was also suggested that the old
system providing that all students who
are on probation not be allowed to
participate in any student activities,
be readopted. A scheme which proved
to be more favorable, was that of al
lowing athletes to take part in activi
ties their first quarter on probation
but not their second.
All members of Nestoria are asked
to be present on the Library steps
Tuesday afternoon at 12:60 to have
the society's picture taken for the
1924 Quad.
