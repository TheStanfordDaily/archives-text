## McCARTHY TO BROACH DRAFT QUESTION AT PORTLAND MEETING 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 15.—William
H. McCarthy arrived in the camp of
the enemy—to-wit, the Portland base
ball headquarters, and home of Wil
liam H. Klepper—last night, and was
met by the branch of olive, the flag of
truce, and other symbols of goodwill
on the part of the Portlanders.
McCarthy and Klepper have tem
porarily forgotten their own private
squabble, or so it appears from the
greeting to the league president, and
are bent on combining the Coast
League forces against Judge Landis
and his draft edict.
A luncheon will be tendered Mc-
Carthy by the Portland Chamber of
Commerce at noon today, at which
the prexy is expected to make a
speech, laying his cards on the table
in a consecutive order, and appeal for
cooperation of the entire league in his
definance of "Czar" Landis' regula
tions.
The Portland Baseball club, which
is the Klepper organization, will bant
quet the California visitors tonight, at
which time, if all goes well, the final
terms of the peace—with or without
victory—and the plan of campaign for
the minor leagues is expected to be ar
ranged.
Playing schedules, trades, and regu
lar business will follow after the big
question of peace among members of
the Coast League, and "baseball war"
against the majors has been settled
by the eight representatives.
