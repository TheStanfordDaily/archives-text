## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton drove his hopes and
hopelesses around the oval Friday after
noon in the first informal meet of the
quarter, and though no astounding rec
ords were set, comparison with last year's
marks show the times and distances to
be quite creditable.
The fastest time in the century was
10:3. made by Caspar. Campbell. Fay,
and Van Judah won the other three
heats of the 100-yard in 10:4, 10:4, and
11 seconds, respectively.
Competition was keen in the 660-yard
run, where Daly, winner of the half-mile

in last year's big meet was forced to
work hard in order to pull ahead of
Moody and Richardson. The time in
this heat was 1 :27:3, a mark which was
not equaled last year until late in Feb
ruary.

heats of the 352-yard run in 40:4. The
