# Stanford Defeats Olympic Club Five
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity made another stride toward a successful season
Saturday night by turning the fast Olympic Club back with an IS-to-14 defeat,
i Too many fouls on the part of the clubmen and superior condition on the part
of the Cardinal qunitet tells the story of the downfall of the San Francisco
aggregation. ,
Captain Lefty Rogers, the "Iron man" of the Stanford varsity, through his
shots from the foul line can be counted as the biggest factor in winning
| Saturday's game. The Cardinal leader chalked up twelve free throws out of
sixteen tries and is credited with one field goal. A comparison of the points
made by the two teams shows that the Olympic Club made four goals to

three by Stanford but were only able
to register six of their eleven tries at
free throws.
Stanford Leads at Half
Early in the first half, the Olympic
Club stepped into the lead when Fred
Bonney, a member of "Bob" Evans'
1919 Stanford football varsity dropped
in two field goals. Personal fouls by
the clubmen which were turned into
points for the Cardinal squad by Lefty
Rogers and field goals by Rogers and
Anderson, who, by the way, played his
best game of the season so far, re
versed the score and at the end of
half time, Stanford was leading 13
to 8. \
The second half was mostly a fight
for the possession of the ball with
members of both teams exhibiting
dives for the casaba that would make
a football coach feel proud. Lauter
wasser, who had been playing the
bench up until this time, was put into
the game by Ryan and immediately
made known his presence by a field
goal. Nip McHose accounted for Stan
ford's only field goal in this period
while Rogers added three points by
the free throw route.
Cards on Offense
Ryan used ten men Saturday in try
ing to find a combination that could
pierce the Stanford defense but the
Cardinal five refused to give them
many chances at a close shot. Fast
work in the opening of the game
placed the ball under the Olympic
Club basket but the Stanford guards
soon solved the Club offense and the
ball during the last half was played
mostly in Stanford territory.
Anderson and Rogers were easily
the stars of the game. Kerr was well
pleased with the work of Anderson
and just before the game ended, gave
him a try at the forward position.
Gurdon Steele played the best game of
the three centers used by Kerr while
Hooper looked good during the time he
was in the bout at running guard.

Cards on Offense
Ryan used ten men Saturday in try
ing to find a combination that could
pierce the Stanford defense but the
Cardinal five refused to give them
many chances at a close shot. Fast
work in the opening of the game
placed the ball under the Olympic
Club basket but the Stanford guards
soon solved the Club offense and the
ball during the last half was played
mostly in Stanford territory.
Anderson and Rogers were easily
the stars of the game. Kerr was well
pleased with the work of Anderson
and just before the game ended, gave
him a try at the forward position.
Gurdon Steele played the best game of
the three centers used by Kerr while
Hooper looked good during the time he
was in the bout at running guard.

Saturday night by turning the fast Olympic Club back with an IS-to-14 defeat,
i Too many fouls on the part of the clubmen and superior condition on the part
of the Cardinal qunitet tells the story of the downfall of the San Francisco
aggregation. ,
Captain Lefty Rogers, the "Iron man" of the Stanford varsity, through his
shots from the foul line can be counted as the biggest factor in winning
| Saturday's game. The Cardinal leader chalked up twelve free throws out of
sixteen tries and is credited with one field goal. A comparison of the points
made by the two teams shows that the Olympic Club made four goals to

three by Stanford but were only able
to register six of their eleven tries at
free throws.
Stanford Leads at Half
Early in the first half, the Olympic
Club stepped into the lead when Fred
Bonney, a member of "Bob" Evans'
1919 Stanford football varsity dropped
in two field goals. Personal fouls by
the clubmen which were turned into
points for the Cardinal squad by Lefty
Rogers and field goals by Rogers and
Anderson, who, by the way, played his
best game of the season so far, re
versed the score and at the end of
half time, Stanford was leading 13
to 8. \
The second half was mostly a fight
for the possession of the ball with
members of both teams exhibiting
dives for the casaba that would make
a football coach feel proud. Lauter
wasser, who had been playing the
bench up until this time, was put into
the game by Ryan and immediately
made known his presence by a field
goal. Nip McHose accounted for Stan
ford's only field goal in this period
while Rogers added three points by
the free throw route.
