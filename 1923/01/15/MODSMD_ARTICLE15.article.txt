## 
### DON LIEBENDORFER, '24 
Playing an improved brand of bas
ketball, the 1926 court quintet defeated
the weak Lowell High School five 42-
12 in the Pavilion Saturday night.
The Bay City lads showed little
knowledge of the game and were
never dangerous. The Babes, on the
other hand, played together well,
passed, dribbled and shot baskets in
a way that made them look more like
a team than five individuals on the
floor.
Hunt's jnen" started piling up scores
early in the fracas. Baskets by Mac-
Derruot, Carter, Mitchell, and Nevers
gave the Babes a ten-point lead before
the game was ten minutes old. The
Lowell team had no defense, and
guards and forwards alike were drib
bling under the basket and dropping
the ball through the hoop.
Hunt used thirteen men in the game,
six forwards, two centers, and five
guards. Nevers, with six field goals
and as many free ones, a total of
eighteen points, was high point man.
Morrison at center accounted for four
field goals and Mitchell for three.
Mitchell, at running guard, was the
backbone of the Babe offense and de
fense. He followed the ball every min
ute and never allowed his man to get
loose when the high school team had
the ball. On the offense, he is fast on
his feet and the best man on the squad
at dribbling. He seems to lack confi
dence when he gets under the basket,
however, for several times when he
was within easy scoring distance Sat
urday night he passed instead of shoot
ing.
Carter and Morrison both played
well at center. Morrison played his
usual steady game, while Carter
showed a vast improvement over his
work in the San Jose scuffle.
At the standing guard job, Hunt will
have a hard job choosing between
MacDermot and Kirwan, although the
former seems to have the best claim
to the position at present.
