# BERLIN MOB GATHERS IN FRONT OF FRENCH EMBASSY
## 
### 
BERLIN —The square in front of
the French embassy this morning pre- \
sented the appearance of an armed
camp, with hundreds of mounted po
lice and pyramids of rifles and ma
chine guns.
Excited crowds hissed and shouted
"Down with France!" Bands played
while the patriotic throng sang
"Deutschland Über Alles" and the
"Watch on the Rhine."
A deputation was sent to the office
of Chancellor Cuno asking him to ap
pear, but he sent a message of thanks j
and said that he was tied down by I
important state business.
The crowd tried unsuccessfully to j
break the police cordon guarding
Brandenburger Gate, behind which is
the French embassy, repeating the
cry, "Down With France."
