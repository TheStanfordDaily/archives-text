# INTERNAL DISSENSION
## 
### 
Skull and Snakes and the journalistic faction on
the campus never did get along. About three years
ago an editor of Chaparral refused to affiliate with
that so-called honor society, and a great rumpus was
raised. Later, another journalist expressed in public
his opinion of Skull and Snakes and was soon
trembling in his boots at the august organization's
threats to "take measures to remove the cause of diffi
culty." The journalist went right on expressing his
opinions and the measures were not forthcoming.
Then a reaction set in. Skull and Snakes adopted
a "broad policy," a forgiving attitude toward Oppos
ing factions, and so 011 ad infinitum. Beyond the
point of admitting to membership non-athletic under
graduates who were active in student* affairs, most
of the members of Skull and Snakes had no more
idea than the man in the moon what comprised their
"broad policy." They knew it was something big,
something tremendously inclusive and far-reaching,
but they didn't have the least idea what it was. In
short, they expected to set the local world on fire, but
they didn't know what with. It was alxnit as laugh
able as their threats to silence the aforementioned
journalist.
Since the memorable occasion, in which every
campus journalist of any prominence was taken in,
the great honor society has eschewed everybody but
athletes, with two exceptions. Neither of these were
journalists. Since that time certain members have
been patting local pen athletes with one hand and
tossing in the renowned blackball with the other. For
example let us put on our smoked spectacles and
glance over the election returns of the last meeting.
First nine men were elected. In the second place, the
nine neophytes are athletes, with one exception. In
the third place, all nine were fraternity men. In the
fourth, only two non-fraternity men were proposed
for membership.
As to the election of nine men, there are no objec
tions. But, considering the second count, where are
representatives of other interests? As to the fact
that all nine were fraternity men, we can only won
der why Skull and Snakes does not change its name
to Phi Phi whose hand takes such an active part in
these elections. It is further absurd to think that
there are 110 more than two non-fraternity men
eligible for membership.
There are several logical conclusions to be drawn
from this array of facts, which, if they were human,
would blush because of their existence. The first is
that no honor society can long be one that ignores the
standards which characterize the word "honor." It
friendship, enmity, and affiliations are to be counted
over the individual personalities of candidates, then
the "broad policies" and "high principles" are of use
only for the organization's letter head. Whereupon,
we may go further and remark with assurance that
you don't have to go as far as Denmark to find some
thing rotten.
The ordinary reader, having progressed thus far,
has no doubt said to himself that the author of this
article is grieved because lie didn't get clected into
Skull and Snakes. To be frank, if the author ever
cherished any such ambitions, he lost them two elec
tions ago when he discovered who it was that tossed
in the Ethiopian beans. At this stage of the game,
election would have meant merely another pin and
another initiation fee. A half-year in an organiza
tion, regardless of its high ideals and great honor,
spells neither effectiveness nor hope for continuity,
an essential in any "going concern."
We now arrive at the heart of the situation. Why
have this war between fraternity and non-fraternity
factions on terms of Hun against Yank, the termi-

nology depending upon affiliation? Why waste en
ergy fighting each other when a more logical foe
offers strong athletic teams for competition some
fifty miles away ? Why this deadly enmity ? Alumni
returning to Stanford are astonished to find that such
an intense feeling has arisen between factions, a
term which should be amended to read "elements."
They say that affiliation meant little between Stan
ford men a decade ago. The same certainly cannot
be said today. As an example, a certain fraternity
man was openly congratulated in a classroom las*
quarter by another fraternity man because the first
had succeeded in rushing a member of an eating club
to the ertent of pledging him. After the rushee in
question had broken his pledge and returned to his
club, certain non-fraternity men took pleasure in
"rubbing it in." Nice bunch of boys, what?
In the outside world a Stanford man is a Stanford
man. At Stanford he is either a ( ) (sub
stitute name of fraternity) or "Hall" man. iach
side in speaking of the other does not trouble itself
to add "man."
Thus we have false barriers erected on a false
foundation for false reasons, altogether a sweet sham
for the old-timer and the newcomer. There's one
good place to start a reform and that is in the so
called honor societies where brotherly love and pan
cake pins might well be forgotten for the good of
Stanford and its undergraduate politics.
