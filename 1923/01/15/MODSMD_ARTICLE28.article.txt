## California and Nevada Quintets Meet Tonight 
### 
Interconference basketball for this sea
son will start tonight when the teams for
the University of California and the
University of Nevada meet in Harmon
Gymnasium.
Neither team has seen much action yet
this season. Coach Courtwright will
bring a light, fast team from Nevada, but
he has lost Bradshaw and Reed, who
were powerful assets to his squad last
year.
Coach Wight has not announced who
will start the game for California, but it
is probable that he will use his second
team to begin with and make substitu
tions from his first. The Blue and Gold
is an aggregation of veterans. Practi
cally every man has won his letter in
that sport before.
From the early season reports the Ne
vada team is powerful on defense. They
have a strong set of guards, but their
defense has not been developed very
strongly.
The California team this year is com
posed of Captain LeHane, standing
guard; Thompson, running guard ; Paul
O'Neil, center; Douthit and Talt, for-

wards. As hitherto, California will use
a five-man defense and four-man offense.
During the game the Bruins usually keep
one man under the basket as a secondary
defense.
