# MINNESOTA STUDENTS MAKE EXPERIMENTS WITH RATS
## 
### 
Sub-normal rats, or rats with only
a part of their brains, are quicker in
action than normal rats. This has been
discovered by students working in re
search psychology at Minnesota Uni
versity. The experiments are made
with groups of four or five rats each.
A particular significance attaches
itself to the experiments in the con
notation hidden in the fact that hu
man reactions are nearly identical to
those of rats, in all tests of this kind.
Trick traps have been perfected by
the psychology department whereby a
rat must step on two levers of a cage
before the door to the cage opens and
the rat gains access to the food which
has been placed within.
It has taken normal rats from 600
to 850 seconds to step on both levers
before they got to their food. In the
case of rats who have only part of
their brains, the time is from 20 to 2
seconds.
