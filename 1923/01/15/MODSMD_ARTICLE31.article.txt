# California Enrollment Is Largest in Country
## 
### 
California has the greatest enroll
ment of any university in the United
States according to the state univer
sity's annual report which has reached
the California Legislature. The enroll- 1
rnent in November was 14,505 regular
full-time students and 15,909 non-resi
dents.
President David P. Barrows said that
the rapid growth of this and other I
institutions had given rise to the fear
that standards of scholarship might
break down.
This, he said, he did not believe
would occur.
The report also calls attention to the
financial increases necessitated by this
growth, a budget with a figure of!
$1,176,998.62 over the amount granted
the university last biennium being
asked for.
