# ETCHINGS BY ENGLISH PRINT SOCIETY SHOWN IN STANFORD GALLERY
## 
### 
A collection of eighty-two prints by
members of the Print Society, an Inter
national Society of Etchers and Print
Collectors in England, has been placed
on exhibition in the Stanford Art Gal
lery, where it will remain until Febru
ary 5.
The prints are of a high quality, par
ticular excellence being shown in the
printing.
The British organization is largely
composed of younger artists who show
a tendency, which is reflected in their
subjects, to follow newer notes and to
seek different subjects for etching.
The exhibition shows a varied range
of etching types, from dry points to
color etching.
The work of this group has been
shown at Toronto, Amsterdam, New

Zealand, Sydney, Philadelphia, and I
throughout Great Britain.
Mr. E. Hesketh Hubbard organized
the society, regarding which an article
appearing in the 1922 issue of Penrose's
Annual (London) says:
"To realize a need and to deal with i
it in a thoroughly practical and very |
workmanlike way has been the good for- \
tune of Mr. E. Hesketh Hubbard. It i
waS brought home to this young land-1
scape painter and etcher that there are,;
in the country districts of England,
many cultured people with a real love of
prints, who rarely visit the large cities
where exhibitions are held, and so» have
very limited opportunities of seeing or
acquiring etchings. To balance this class
of appreciative would-be collectors there
is the group of young artists who, at the
outset of their careers, find great diffi
culty in showing and disposing of their
work, good though it may be.
"The idea of introducing these two

groups materialized into the Print So
ciety with its headuarters at 'Woodgreen
Common,' in the New Forest. Much
steady work and thoughtful organization
went to founding that enterprising lit
tle society. Its main function was to
show the work of its etcher members to
its collector members in their homes, as
often as they wished; to help young
etchers to find a market for their prints;
and to give collectors an opportunity to
handle good etchings, moderately priced,
and to enjoy them at leisure.
Mr. Hubbard made several preliminary
j tests to find out whether the idea was
| workable, and finally, in 1919, was joined
|by nine other artists; in July of that year
the first portfolio of prints was circu
' lated.
"Results at first were not sensational,
but progress was very steady; at the end
of six months one out of every three
prints was finding a purchaser. After
that the stury little society became more
and more widely known ; and because the
| work was sound and good, and the or
ganization thoroughly workmanlike,
I things went ahead by leaps and bounds."
The galleries are open to the public
from 10 a. m. until 5 p. m. every day,

on exhibition in the Stanford Art Gal
lery, where it will remain until Febru
ary 5.
The prints are of a high quality, par
ticular excellence being shown in the
printing.
The British organization is largely
composed of younger artists who show
a tendency, which is reflected in their
subjects, to follow newer notes and to
seek different subjects for etching.
The exhibition shows a varied range
of etching types, from dry points to
color etching.
The work of this group has been
shown at Toronto, Amsterdam, New

Zealand, Sydney, Philadelphia, and I
throughout Great Britain.
Mr. E. Hesketh Hubbard organized
the society, regarding which an article
appearing in the 1922 issue of Penrose's
Annual (London) says:
"To realize a need and to deal with i
it in a thoroughly practical and very |
workmanlike way has been the good for- \
tune of Mr. E. Hesketh Hubbard. It i
waS brought home to this young land-1
scape painter and etcher that there are,;
in the country districts of England,
many cultured people with a real love of
prints, who rarely visit the large cities
where exhibitions are held, and so» have
very limited opportunities of seeing or
acquiring etchings. To balance this class
of appreciative would-be collectors there
is the group of young artists who, at the
outset of their careers, find great diffi
culty in showing and disposing of their
work, good though it may be.
"The idea of introducing these two

groups materialized into the Print So
ciety with its headuarters at 'Woodgreen
Common,' in the New Forest. Much
steady work and thoughtful organization
went to founding that enterprising lit
tle society. Its main function was to
show the work of its etcher members to
its collector members in their homes, as
often as they wished; to help young
etchers to find a market for their prints;
and to give collectors an opportunity to
handle good etchings, moderately priced,
and to enjoy them at leisure.
Mr. Hubbard made several preliminary
j tests to find out whether the idea was
| workable, and finally, in 1919, was joined
|by nine other artists; in July of that year
the first portfolio of prints was circu
' lated.
"Results at first were not sensational,
but progress was very steady; at the end
of six months one out of every three
prints was finding a purchaser. After
that the stury little society became more
and more widely known ; and because the
| work was sound and good, and the or
ganization thoroughly workmanlike,
I things went ahead by leaps and bounds."

from 10 a. m. until 5 p. m. every day,
