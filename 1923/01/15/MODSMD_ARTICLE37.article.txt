# VARSITY SOCCER MEN DEFEAT VIRTUS CLUB
## 
### 
Italia \ irtus Club of San Francisco
I was defeated by the varsity soccer team
m the first game of the new season at the
Golden Gate Stadium Saturday by a score
of 5 to 0. Virtus Club was outclassed
during the entire contest; at no time did
they have an opportunity to score.
Although rather one-sided the game
was a very creditable exhibition of pass
ing. Coach Maloney's men had little
difficulty in placing the ball accurately;
the backs wings and forwards worked
together formidably.
1 a'am, playing center forward, shot
three of the five goals, while Dwight, at
inside right, registered the other two.
Swayne, the right half, was injured in
the early part of the first half, so the
varsity was forced to play twenty min
utes with only ten men.
