# One Year of Fire Prevention Finds Hazard Decreased
## 
### HAL RORKE, '24 
One year ago today, lieutenant Ed
ward Lamb left his San Francisco fire
I company for a fifteen-day vacation. One
year ago tomorrow he arrived at Stan
ford, interviewed the administration, ob-
I tained the position of fire marshal and
started work against old man Fire Haz
ard. Since then he has arranged for
leave of absence which will permit him
Ito remain at Stanford until February,
1924, become a public character and slash
old man 1\ H. to ludicrously small di
mensions in preparation for the moving
away of the nuisance altogether.
The proof that Lamb's work has been
| successful is the fact that a recent in
| spection of the local properties by in
surance men found such an improvement
j in fire protection and such a reduction
of dangerous rubbish and unsafe care
lessness that a cut in insurance rates is
j all but arranged.
In the last year the fire marshal has
taken charge of laying miles of new
mains, organized the water system to ob
tain a minimum of dead ends; he has
improved alarm methods, remodeled the
enginehouse and fighting equipment, fixed
roads and ,as well, has been the moving
spirit of a number of small reforms and
improvements, signally in connection with
prevention of fire causes. The depart
ment has only been called out on one
night fire. It has often been called upon
to fight flames, grass fires particularly,
off the Stanford property.
In general, the policy of "we view with j
alarm" has been successful in preventing
that of "we run to alarms." Marshal
Lamb says that almost all of the living
groups have cleaned up as much as they
are able. It is this sort of co-operation
to which he attributes all his depart-j
ment's success. When he has convinced i
three fraternities that their lease will be
canceled by the Comptroller's Office if a'
clean-up doesn't result soon, he feels that
he will have done everything possible
within his authority. Further effort, since !
not absolutely essential, he regrets will j
have to depend on what natural cleanli- j
ness thirty or more young collegians may
possess.
Now and then Fire Marshal Lamb re
laxes his vigilance over a perfectly
trained organization to peruse his studies
j under the Federal compensation arrange
j ment providing for the tutelage of

wounded veterans He is swiftly becom
ing proficient in the secondary school
curriculum.
Lamb intends to remain here until he
has carried out the one or two more im
provements the administration has
planned when he will return to San Fran
cisco and his old company.
