# PROFESSOR LANZ EXPRESSES HIGH OPINION OF "HE"
## 
### Allan Charles, '25 
"He Who Gets Slapped," Masquers'
choice for presentation on January 26,
is a tremendous drama of universal
human appeal, a play such as the Stan
ford campus has never seen before.
This is the opinion of Professor
Henry Lanz of the Slavic languages
department, who is enthusiastic over
the selection for presentation of "He
Who Gets Slapped," a four-act play by
the Russian dramatist, Leoned An
dreyev.
No Claptrap in "He"
The drama is not one of the usual
"something different" type, with some
new theatrical contraption attached or
some unusual "atmosphere" worked
in; but is, according to Lanz, an im
pressionistic play of superb qualities.
Lanz, who is familiar with the works
of Andreyev, was a professor in a Rus
sian unversity, and was in Germany
when the war broke out, coming then
to England and later to America."He,"
Lanz thinks, is a truly artistic play of
great significance.
Circus Rider Well Depicted
That the role of Consuelo, a circus
rider, to be played by Peggy Richard
son in the Masquers' presentation, is
the most important character in the
drama is the belief of Lanz. "The most
vital point is the presentation of the
girl Consuelo's character; upon Con
suelo more even than "He," the artistic
effect of the play depends.
"Consuelo is a charming savage. She
is a combination of the effects of the
rude and primitive environment of the
circus and the virtues of a kind heart.
Although an angelic, innocent creature
of admirable qualities, she is cloaked
with the primitive crudeness and
roughness of the circus life."
According to Lanz, all the charac
ters in the drama are exceedingly in
teresting types. "The Baron, a despic
able human with a spider-like stare, is
very well drawn. Consuelo's father
likewise is artistically done.
Tragedy of Clown Felt
"Throughout the play we can feel
the bitter and tragic element of the
-clown, "He," mingling with laughter.
The outward comic shows of the cir
cus clown are combined with tragedy
in this figure," said Lanz.
" 'He', from allusions we get in the
third act, is a specimen of the highest
humanity; 'He' is a man of unusual
values, a creative mind, a true genius
who found life polluted by trivialities.
Evidently his creations outside the
circus have been 'slapped,' as well as
his creations within."
"He Who Gets Slapped" is the type
of play which should prove particular
ly interesting to the college student
who is just starting out in life, Lanz
ventured. "The play is puzzlingâ€”it is
rather difficult to decide at once just
what the meaning really is. The drama
has a good deal of social significance.
It is, I would say, decidedly symbolic;
it has an idea to represent. This idea
which the play expresses may strike
people differently.
Virtues Get Slapped
"My conception is that the 'He Who
Gets Slapped' represents that which is
best in human life, all that which is
good, that which is refined.
"These elements are getting coninu
ally 'slapped' by the brutal forces and
trivial environment of ordinary life.
"The whole artistic effect of the
drama is pleasing. It is not pleasing in
the sense of the ordinary moving pic
ture, which is always concluded hap
pily, but it is artistically stimulating.
The average person should feel as
though he had gained something of
value for his own mental development
and personality."
While the play has a strong Russian
tinge, Lanz does not consider it a
typical Russian type, but believes "He
Who Gets Slapped" to be a drama of
wide human significance. For this rea
son, to show the international charac
ter of the play, Andreyev laid the
scene in a permanent circus in France.
