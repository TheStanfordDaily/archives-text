# CONVALESCENT HOME WILL BE AIDED BY CHILDREN'S CIRCUS
## 
### 
Plans are being made by the Children's
Club of Menlo Park for their fourth an
nual circus, to be given on June 23, the
proceeds of which will go to the Stanford
Home for Convalescent Children. In
1920 the first performance was given by
three small girls with a couple of cats,
chickens and clogs, a performance which
netted nearly $500. In 1921 and last year
much more elaborated enterprises, which
included concessions, gave proceeds of
over ten thousand dollars each. On June
23 the circus which will be given on a
new riding field, will be larger than ever.
On the new riding field which will be
the children's country club, the club plans
to establish a clubhouse, stables, racing
track, circus field and, later on, a swim
ming pool. Many Stanford, Palo Alto,
and Menlo Park people have subscribed
to the fund which will make possible the
furthering of these plans. On the new
grounds, where more people can be ac
commodated, the circus children hope to
send a larger amount than before to
the children of the Stanford Convalescent
Home.
