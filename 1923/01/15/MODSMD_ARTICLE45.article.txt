# TRIPLE TRACK MEET IS DECIDED AGAINST
## 
### 
Stanford, California, and the Univer-j
sity of Southern California will not com- j
pete in a triple track meet this year. I
R. VV. Cortelyou, the new university ath
letic manager at California, makes clear
the reasons for not scheduling the meet, j
The University of Southern California
was anxious for a contest of this sort
and all three universities are agreed that
from a financial standpoint it would be
profitable; but the aim of Stanford and
California is to keep away from the pro
fessional and to stimulate rivalry 'where
it is natural.
California and Stanford are close
enough for real rivalry to grow. It is
different with U. S. C., where rivalry is
caused merely by sectional division. To
have a track meet with all three univer
sities competing would mean the slacken
ing of interest in the Stanford-California
meet which is the big meet of the year j
as far as the athletic managers are con
cerned. At present U. S. C. is only a
secondary consideration with the other
two universities. This decision will be
come a policy that will influence Coast
athletics especially in California, to a'
great extent.
The above will have no effect on the i
dual meets which are regularly sched
uled between all three of the universities.'
