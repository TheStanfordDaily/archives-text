# SECOND ROUND OF INTRAMURAL PLAY WILL START TODAY
## EI Toro Defeats Encina Fifth Floor Quintet; Ed Tigre, Theta Chi Winners 
### 
In the closest game of the week,
El Toro defeated Encina fifth floor
Friday in the last of the first round
contests of the intramural basketball
tournament.
A single basket by the Encina team
in the last minute would have tied
the game up and forced it into over
time, but the El Toro guards kept
awake and no basket was made. The
final score stood 8-6 for El Toro.
With the exception of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon-Breakers game which
the former won 8-4, Friday's contest
was the closest game and had the
smallest score of any played during
the week. The El Tigre-Phi Kappa Psi
contest which the former won 17-4
after a five-minute period, was tied
at the end of the game and probably
was the hardest-fought game of the
week, but no teams kept even, point
by-point, as did the Encina and El
Toro teams.
Many Fouls Mark Close Game
Between El Toro and Encina
The game started with the usual
rush, but the ball had not been passed
a dozen times when the referee's
whistle blew for a foul. Fouls and
jump balls were called time and again
during the whole game. The referee
worked as hard as the players. Crook,
j playing guard for El Toro, was taken
out of the game in the middle of the
second half when four personals had
been called on him. Neither team was
able to take advantage of the many
free throws allowed as only six out of
fourteen tries were made good.
The guarding was close 011 both
sides; Crook and Martin for El Toro
and Mahan and Swan for Encina
played a hard game. The Encina for
wards were light and inaccurate 011
their basket shots. Fain tallied for the
Encina team the only time they scored
j via the field route.

As Theta Chi Beats Los Arcos
The only other game of the day was
{ played between Los Arcos and Theta
i Chi, the latter winning easily 11-2.
The Theta Chi team, which was run
ner-up in the intramural tournament
last year, showed much the same class
i as before.
The game was slow in getting start
ed and the only points scored during
the first half were four free throws by
Blosser and a field goal by Hollings
worth just before half time was called.
J At the beginning of the second half,
the Theta Chi team got under way and
added two more field goals to their
total, ending their scoring bee with
another free throw.
In the middle of the last half, Ham
j ilton broke through the Theta Chi de
| fense and tallied once for Los Arcos,
this basket being the only score to
i their credit.
The Theta Chi team did not have
quite the same strength of last year
and showed the lack of practice but
with a strong lineup and good guard
ing by Green and Barnard the team
should gain speed. Hollingsworth and
Blosser both played a good game at
forward and promise something better
! when they improve their dribbling and
| basket shooting.

In the closest game of the week,
El Toro defeated Encina fifth floor
Friday in the last of the first round
contests of the intramural basketball
tournament.
A single basket by the Encina team
in the last minute would have tied
the game up and forced it into over
time, but the El Toro guards kept
awake and no basket was made. The
final score stood 8-6 for El Toro.
With the exception of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon-Breakers game which
the former won 8-4, Friday's contest
was the closest game and had the
smallest score of any played during
the week. The El Tigre-Phi Kappa Psi
contest which the former won 17-4
after a five-minute period, was tied
at the end of the game and probably
was the hardest-fought game of the
week, but no teams kept even, point
by-point, as did the Encina and El
Toro teams.
Many Fouls Mark Close Game
Between El Toro and Encina
The game started with the usual
rush, but the ball had not been passed
a dozen times when the referee's
whistle blew for a foul. Fouls and
jump balls were called time and again
during the whole game. The referee
worked as hard as the players. Crook,
j playing guard for El Toro, was taken
out of the game in the middle of the
second half when four personals had
been called on him. Neither team was
able to take advantage of the many
free throws allowed as only six out of
fourteen tries were made good.
The guarding was close 011 both
sides; Crook and Martin for El Toro
and Mahan and Swan for Encina
played a hard game. The Encina for
wards were light and inaccurate 011
their basket shots. Fain tallied for the
Encina team the only time they scored
j via the field route.

As Theta Chi Beats Los Arcos
The only other game of the day was
{ played between Los Arcos and Theta
i Chi, the latter winning easily 11-2.
The Theta Chi team, which was run
ner-up in the intramural tournament
last year, showed much the same class
i as before.
The game was slow in getting start
ed and the only points scored during
the first half were four free throws by
Blosser and a field goal by Hollings
worth just before half time was called.
J At the beginning of the second half,
the Theta Chi team got under way and
added two more field goals to their
total, ending their scoring bee with
another free throw.
In the middle of the last half, Ham
j ilton broke through the Theta Chi de
| fense and tallied once for Los Arcos,
this basket being the only score to
i their credit.
The Theta Chi team did not have
quite the same strength of last year
and showed the lack of practice but
with a strong lineup and good guard
ing by Green and Barnard the team
should gain speed. Hollingsworth and
Blosser both played a good game at
forward and promise something better
! when they improve their dribbling and
| basket shooting.

tournament.
A single basket by the Encina team
in the last minute would have tied
the game up and forced it into over
time, but the El Toro guards kept
awake and no basket was made. The
final score stood 8-6 for El Toro.
With the exception of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon-Breakers game which
the former won 8-4, Friday's contest
was the closest game and had the
smallest score of any played during
the week. The El Tigre-Phi Kappa Psi
contest which the former won 17-4
after a five-minute period, was tied
at the end of the game and probably
was the hardest-fought game of the
week, but no teams kept even, point
by-point, as did the Encina and El
Toro teams.
Many Fouls Mark Close Game
Between El Toro and Encina
The game started with the usual
rush, but the ball had not been passed
a dozen times when the referee's
whistle blew for a foul. Fouls and
jump balls were called time and again
during the whole game. The referee
worked as hard as the players. Crook,
j playing guard for El Toro, was taken
out of the game in the middle of the
second half when four personals had
been called on him. Neither team was
able to take advantage of the many
free throws allowed as only six out of
fourteen tries were made good.
The guarding was close 011 both
sides; Crook and Martin for El Toro
and Mahan and Swan for Encina
played a hard game. The Encina for
wards were light and inaccurate 011
their basket shots. Fain tallied for the
Encina team the only time they scored
j via the field route.
Blosses, Hollingsworth Star,
As Theta Chi Beats Los Arcos
The only other game of the day was
{ played between Los Arcos and Theta
i Chi, the latter winning easily 11-2.
The Theta Chi team, which was run
ner-up in the intramural tournament
last year, showed much the same class
i as before.
The game was slow in getting start
ed and the only points scored during
the first half were four free throws by
Blosser and a field goal by Hollings
worth just before half time was called.
J At the beginning of the second half,
the Theta Chi team got under way and
added two more field goals to their
total, ending their scoring bee with
another free throw.
In the middle of the last half, Ham
j ilton broke through the Theta Chi de
| fense and tallied once for Los Arcos,
this basket being the only score to
i their credit.
The Theta Chi team did not have
quite the same strength of last year
and showed the lack of practice but
with a strong lineup and good guard
ing by Green and Barnard the team
should gain speed. Hollingsworth and
Blosser both played a good game at
forward and promise something better
! when they improve their dribbling and
| basket shooting.
