# SECOND ROUND OF INTRAMURAL PLAY WILL START TODAY
## EI Toro Defeats Encina Fifth Floor Quintet; Ed Tigre, Theta Chi Winners 
### 
In the closest game of the week,
El Toro defeated Encina fifth floor
Friday in the last of the first round
contests of the intramural basketball
tournament.
A single basket by the Encina team
in the last minute would have tied
the game up and forced it into over
time, but the El Toro guards kept
awake and no basket was made. The
final score stood 8-6 for El Toro.
With the exception of the Delta
Kappa Epsilon-Breakers game which
the former won 8-4, Friday's contest
was the closest game and had the
smallest score of any played during
the week. The El Tigre-Phi Kappa Psi
contest which the former won 17-4
after a five-minute period, was tied
at the end of the game and probably
was the hardest-fought game of the
week, but no teams kept even, point
by-point, as did the Encina and El
Toro teams.
Many Fouls Mark Close Game
Between El Toro and Encina
The game started with the usual
rush, but the ball had not been passed
a dozen times when the referee's
whistle blew for a foul. Fouls and
jump balls were called time and again
