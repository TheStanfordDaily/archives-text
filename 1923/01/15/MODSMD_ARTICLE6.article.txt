# SAN MATEO CIVILIAN POLO TEAM DEFEATS STANFORD R.O.T.C.
## 
### 
Before the largest audience that ever 1
witnessed a polo game at Stanford,!
George Moore's San Mateo civilian 1
team defeated the R. O. T. C. Saturday
afternoon by a 14-3 score.
Stanford was at a disadvantage be
cause the San Mateo team brought a
string of about twenty first-class polo
points, the Card's government mountsi
were less speedy and less handy, and
no handicap was given either on team!
or horses.
The San Mateo team play was dis
appointing to those who expected to
| see a well-rounded civilian team. This
is credited to the new players they \
used, and to the fact that the wet
weather has made practice impossible
for the last six weeks.
The Stanford squad played the best
i game hey have so far this year, but
' they were up against one of the first
j teams in the West and were constantly
on the defense because of inferior
mounts.
The aggression of O. C. Barmy, Stan
ford No. 1, and the team play of
Willie Tevis and Captain Bryan, the
English cavalry officer for San Mateo,
were the spectacles of the game. Tevis
is one of the highest personal-handicap
men on the Pacific coast.
, There was almost a nasty accident
during the play when Captain Bryan
and Paul Verdier, also of the San
Mateo team, collided, with the result
that both were thrown heavily, Bryan
under his pony. Both luckily escaped
without injury.
The visiting team praised the high
way field, saying that it was nearly the
equal of those at Coronado and Pasa
dena.
The line-ups follow:
San Mateo —George Moore, No. 1;
Paul Veirder, No. 2; Willie Tevis (c),
No. 3; Captain Bryan, No. 4.
