# VARSITY WILL MEET STIFF OPPOSITION FROM ST. IGNATIUS
## Team Which Defeated Van Gent's Five Last Season Will Play At Pavilion Tonight 
### 
Stanford's basketball varsity will
meet stiff opposition tonight when
they tackle the St. Ignatius quintet
on the Pavilion floor at 8 o'clock. Last
year, with the Cardinal five a decided
favorite, the Ignatians handed Van
Gent's squad the only set-back of the
preliminary season games. This year,
with a better and faster squad, St. Ig
natius gives promise of offering the
best competition to be seen on the
Pavilion court this year.
The record of the San Francisco
squad so far this season is good. They
have played five games up to date
without the loss of a single contest,
one of the teams falling before their
onslaught being the powerful O. A. C.
quintet that captured two games from
the Cardinal squad last season in the
Coast Conference schedule.
The St. Ignatius team, coached by
Jimmy Needles, is mostly a squad of
veterans. Johnston, at forward, is an
old-timer, accounting for 15 points in
the Stanford-St. Ignatius contest of
last year. Begley, used at guard last
reason, has been showing up well this
year at forward and, according to the
reports from the San Francisco
scribes, will be the man to watch.

Jimmy Needles will probably start the
game at guard while Neill and Imlay
will also get into the contest.
With a schedule of three hard games
facing them for this week, the Card
inal varsity is somewhat crippled. Bob
Janssen is still limping from a weak
ankle and did not do much in practice
last night while A1 Hooper may be
out of the game tonight as a result
of a nasty cut over the eye obtained
in a collision with Shipkey last night.
Fred Anderson, who starred in Satur
day's game, will open the game at run
ning guard tonight with Dave Oliva
playing the standing guard position.
If Janssen is unable to do much to
night, Gurdon Steele will probably
start at center with Paul Pigott to
alternate. Captain Lefty Rogers and
Nip McHose will play the forward
positions.
With two days' rest, the Stanford
varsity will play the Nevada live Fri
day and Saturday. These two games
should give a good estimate of how
the Cardinal squad lines up with the
Blue and Gold team. Last night, the
California squad handed out a 27-to-17
defeat to the Sagebrush aggregation,
using their second string men through
out most of the contest.

the Stanford-St. Ignatius contest of
last year. Begley, used at guard last
reason, has been showing up well this
year at forward and, according to the
reports from the San Francisco
scribes, will be the man to watch.

Jimmy Needles will probably start the
game at guard while Neill and Imlay
will also get into the contest.
With a schedule of three hard games
facing them for this week, the Card
inal varsity is somewhat crippled. Bob
Janssen is still limping from a weak
ankle and did not do much in practice
last night while A1 Hooper may be
out of the game tonight as a result
of a nasty cut over the eye obtained
in a collision with Shipkey last night.
Fred Anderson, who starred in Satur
day's game, will open the game at run
ning guard tonight with Dave Oliva
playing the standing guard position.
If Janssen is unable to do much to
night, Gurdon Steele will probably
start at center with Paul Pigott to
alternate. Captain Lefty Rogers and
Nip McHose will play the forward
positions.
With two days' rest, the Stanford
varsity will play the Nevada live Fri
day and Saturday. These two games
should give a good estimate of how
the Cardinal squad lines up with the
Blue and Gold team. Last night, the
California squad handed out a 27-to-17
defeat to the Sagebrush aggregation,
using their second string men through
out most of the contest.
Stanford's basketball varsity will
meet stiff opposition tonight when
they tackle the St. Ignatius quintet
on the Pavilion floor at 8 o'clock. Last
year, with the Cardinal five a decided
favorite, the Ignatians handed Van
Gent's squad the only set-back of the
preliminary season games. This year,
with a better and faster squad, St. Ig
natius gives promise of offering the
best competition to be seen on the
Pavilion court this year.
The record of the San Francisco
squad so far this season is good. They
have played five games up to date
without the loss of a single contest,
one of the teams falling before their
onslaught being the powerful O. A. C.
quintet that captured two games from
the Cardinal squad last season in the
Coast Conference schedule.
The St. Ignatius team, coached by
Jimmy Needles, is mostly a squad of
veterans. Johnston, at forward, is an
old-timer, accounting for 15 points in
the Stanford-St. Ignatius contest of
last year. Begley, used at guard last
reason, has been showing up well this
year at forward and, according to the
reports from the San Francisco
scribes, will be the man to watch.
