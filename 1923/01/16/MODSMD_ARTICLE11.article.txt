# SET FOR "HE WHO GETS SLAPPED" IS COMPLETED; ACTION DEPICTS GLAMOR OF THE SAWDUST RING
## 
### 
With production night nearly two J
weeks off, the cast of "He Who Gets
Slapped," the drama by Andreyev to
be presented by Masquers' Society on
January 26, is rehearsing on a stage
completely set and ready for the per
formance. The construction of the set- j
ting for the play has been rushed by
Clyde Coakley, stage manager, in '
order that the players might grow ac-'
customed to the unusual setting re
quired, and that pictures of the cast
might be made on a set stage.
Setting by Farmer
Designs for the scenes of "He Who
Gets Slapped" were made by Edward
Farmer, '23. Farmer will be remem
bered by his designs for two Junior
operettas, "Maid to Order," in
1921, and "Up On a Ladder," in 1922.
In the opinion of Director R. C. Bent
inck, Farmer in his designs shows a
remarkable sense of color and mass
design, while he has as well a particu- j
lar ability for expressing in his set
tings the motive or theme of the play.
Farmer's setting for "He Who Gets
Slapped," resembling somewhat that
for the original Theater Guild produc-1
tion, harmonizes perfectly with the |
spirit of the drama, according to Bent- '
inck.
Action in French Circus
All four acts of "He Who Gets ;
Slapped" take place in the same scene, '
the "green room" or actors' lounging I
room of a permanent circus in France. I

The permanent circus is unknown in
this country. It resembles the Ameri
can stock company in that the same
performers play in the same building
throughout the entire season. The cir
cus is housed in a huge wooden build
ing in which the circus folk live their
lives completely out of touch with the
outside world. The performers are con
sidered to be the lowest class of pro
fessional entertainers; the circus and
its people is a "back water of life."
But the performances in these cheap
one-ring contraptions are those of cir
cuses the world over. There are
clowns, lion tamers, jugglers, bareback
riders, acrobats. In spite of the tawdry
squalor of the single ring, there hangs
over it the splendor and glamor that
enfolds the sawdust ring wherever
it is found. It is the circusâ€”the tar
nished gilt of its worn trappings spar
kles as bravely as the new gold leaf
of the gorgeous three-ring pageants of
this country.
The action of the play takes place in
an anteroom off the ring, where the
performers gather between acts. On
one side the slanting wall of the arena
overhangs the stage threateningly. In
this set, Coach Bentinck is using two
levels, part of the stage being covered
by a platform about three feet in
height. Its use makes possible move
ment up and down as well as forward
and back, and aids materially in "put
ting over" the more impressive scenes
of the play.
