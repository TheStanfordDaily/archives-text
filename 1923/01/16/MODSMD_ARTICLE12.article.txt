# SECOND ROUND OPENED
## Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Win Intramural Court Contests 
### 
Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Hall,
first floor, teams, by defeating their op
ponents in Encina Gymnasium last night,
started the second round of the intra
muhal basketball tournament with a much
faster and more decisive style of play
than that which marked the opening of
the tournament a week ago.
Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma won
their games from weaker opponents by
scores of 14-6 and 18-1 respectively.
The Sequoia team which took the floor
| last night against El Tigre was the same
'one which defeated Theta Delta Chi 14-10
in last week's game. Although El Tigre
I had won an overtime contest from the
! Phi Kappa Psi team at the start, the
! Sequoia men surprised their opponents by
preventing them from making a single
field goal, winning by a score of 10-4.
Timmons Is Individual Star
In Sequoia-El Tigre Contest
Again, as last week, Timmons was the
individual star for Sequoia, scoring eight

of their ten points with four field goals
to his credit. His basket shooting was
accuratc and he sank shots from all an
gles and positions, missing a few close
shots by inches. Williard, at center for
Sequoia, made the other goal for his team
playing a hard game against Woodhead
his opponent, who was everywhere on
the floor.
Kennedy and Woodhead shot the fouls J
for El Tigre but both seemed unable j
to locate the basket when shooting from
the floor. Butterfield managed to work
the ball up to the Sequoia basket often,
but neither lie nor his forwards could 1
make the counters. None of the El Tigre
men could get free from their opponents, !
who stuck tight and when unable to fol- j
low dropped back and formed a five-man j
defense for their goal.
Poor passing and little team work
slowed the game up and although the
men worked hard they failed to move the |
ball over the floor with any accuracy and
speed.
The Phi Delta Theta team showed a
much improved game of basketball over
wliat they displayed when they lost their
first game last week to Delta Chi 10-8.
The players worked together as a unit
and with a good passing game and close
guarding easily held the Alpha Tau
Omega team without a field goal and at
the same time accumulated a total of
thirty-one points. The Alpha Tau Omega
team defeated the Zeta Psi team 12-3 last
week in the first game, but last night was
able to make only three points and those
all from free throws.
Driscoli Gives Exhibitions
Of Accurate Basket Shooting
Joe O'Hara started the scoring with a
field goal from the center of the floor
and followed that with another from un
der the basket. Paul O'Hara followed
suit with a couple of free throws and
Driscoli, who went in to the game just
before the lialf, caged a shot and ended
the scoring for that period.
The Phi Delta Theta players lost no
time in adding to their score in the sec
ond lialf and Logan at center opened up
with three pretty shot's in succession from
under the basket. Paul O'Hara tallied
three times and Driscoli broke away from
his guard and scored four times.
In the last few minutes of play, the Phi
Delt players scored almost at will and the
ball sailed through the basket on the first
play after the toss-up. The A. T. O.
guards, although tired out after the first
few mintues of play, held their opposing
forwards at bay until the middle of the
last half.
Neill played a fast and hard game for
Alpha Tau Omega, covering all the floor
and fighting all the time for possession
of the ball. Stratton playing center also
put up a good brand of basketball, but'
the lack of teamwork and fast passing
kept him from making many shots at the
basket.
The Phi Delta Theta team followed
up their shots well and made good use of
a swift passing game.
Middleton and Carey Pile
Up Points for Kappa Sigma
Kappa Sigma defeated Theta Delta Chi
18-1 in a one-sided game in which Middle
ton and Carey showed class for Kappa
Sigma. The Theta Delta Chi team
which played yesterday showed the lack
of improvement in team play and basket
shooting visible in the other second round
games. Trago made the only point scored ■
for his team when he made good a free'
throw, in the first half.
At the start, the outcome of the game
seemed in doubt, but atfer the Kappa
Sigma forwards, Carey, Miller, and Es- :
kew got warmed up, the scoring started.
Most of the baskets were made in the final
half, in which Henderson and Clark,!
guards for 'I heta Delta Chi, were unable
to stop the onslaught.
Fast Kappa Psi Forwards
Display Excellent Teamwork
Until the beginning of the second half
of the Phi Kappa Psi-Delta Upsilon game,!
the teams seemed deadlocked with a pos
sibility of an overtime contest. But two'
liaskets by Newlin followed by two more
by Wittenberg gave Phi Kappa Psi a
sufficient lead to give them the victory.
Delta Upsilon made only one point in
the second half, a free throw by Lacey
making the count. Newlin and Witten- j
burg showed some of the best forward
line play of the tournament when they i
passed back and forth inside the foul line *
until an opportunity for a shot occurred, j
The fast pair worked down to the basket
several times and by snappy, passing caged
four shots between them.
Miller and Lacey handled the ball well i
for Delta Upsilon but were unable to get!
up to the basket many times. Clark was
responsible for the low score of the Phi
Kappa Psi team, preventing a number of
shots by careful guarding of his basket.

The Phi Delta Theta team followed
up their shots well and made good use of
a swift passing game.
Middleton and Carey Pile
Up Points for Kappa Sigma
Kappa Sigma defeated Theta Delta Chi
18-1 in a one-sided game in which Middle
ton and Carey showed class for Kappa
Sigma. The Theta Delta Chi team
which played yesterday showed the lack
of improvement in team play and basket
shooting visible in the other second round
games. Trago made the only point scored ■
for his team when he made good a free'
throw, in the first half.
At the start, the outcome of the game
seemed in doubt, but atfer the Kappa
Sigma forwards, Carey, Miller, and Es- :
kew got warmed up, the scoring started.
Most of the baskets were made in the final
half, in which Henderson and Clark,!
guards for 'I heta Delta Chi, were unable
to stop the onslaught.
Fast Kappa Psi Forwards
Display Excellent Teamwork
Until the beginning of the second half
of the Phi Kappa Psi-Delta Upsilon game,!
the teams seemed deadlocked with a pos
sibility of an overtime contest. But two'
liaskets by Newlin followed by two more
by Wittenberg gave Phi Kappa Psi a
sufficient lead to give them the victory.
Delta Upsilon made only one point in
the second half, a free throw by Lacey
making the count. Newlin and Witten- j
burg showed some of the best forward
line play of the tournament when they i
passed back and forth inside the foul line *
until an opportunity for a shot occurred, j
The fast pair worked down to the basket
several times and by snappy, passing caged
four shots between them.
Miller and Lacey handled the ball well i
for Delta Upsilon but were unable to get!
up to the basket many times. Clark was
responsible for the low score of the Phi
Kappa Psi team, preventing a number of
shots by careful guarding of his basket.
Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Hall,
first floor, teams, by defeating their op
ponents in Encina Gymnasium last night,
started the second round of the intra
muhal basketball tournament with a much
faster and more decisive style of play
than that which marked the opening of
the tournament a week ago.
Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma won
their games from weaker opponents by
scores of 14-6 and 18-1 respectively.
The Sequoia team which took the floor
| last night against El Tigre was the same
'one which defeated Theta Delta Chi 14-10
in last week's game. Although El Tigre
I had won an overtime contest from the
! Phi Kappa Psi team at the start, the
! Sequoia men surprised their opponents by
preventing them from making a single
field goal, winning by a score of 10-4.
Timmons Is Individual Star
In Sequoia-El Tigre Contest
Again, as last week, Timmons was the
individual star for Sequoia, scoring eight

of their ten points with four field goals
to his credit. His basket shooting was
accuratc and he sank shots from all an
gles and positions, missing a few close
shots by inches. Williard, at center for
Sequoia, made the other goal for his team
playing a hard game against Woodhead
his opponent, who was everywhere on
the floor.
Kennedy and Woodhead shot the fouls J
for El Tigre but both seemed unable j
to locate the basket when shooting from
the floor. Butterfield managed to work
the ball up to the Sequoia basket often,
but neither lie nor his forwards could 1
make the counters. None of the El Tigre
men could get free from their opponents, !
who stuck tight and when unable to fol- j
low dropped back and formed a five-man j
defense for their goal.
Poor passing and little team work
slowed the game up and although the
men worked hard they failed to move the |
ball over the floor with any accuracy and
speed.
The Phi Delta Theta team showed a
much improved game of basketball over
wliat they displayed when they lost their
first game last week to Delta Chi 10-8.
The players worked together as a unit
and with a good passing game and close
guarding easily held the Alpha Tau
Omega team without a field goal and at
the same time accumulated a total of
thirty-one points. The Alpha Tau Omega
team defeated the Zeta Psi team 12-3 last
week in the first game, but last night was
able to make only three points and those
all from free throws.
Driscoli Gives Exhibitions
Of Accurate Basket Shooting
Joe O'Hara started the scoring with a
field goal from the center of the floor
and followed that with another from un
der the basket. Paul O'Hara followed
suit with a couple of free throws and
Driscoli, who went in to the game just
before the lialf, caged a shot and ended
the scoring for that period.
The Phi Delta Theta players lost no
time in adding to their score in the sec
ond lialf and Logan at center opened up
with three pretty shot's in succession from
under the basket. Paul O'Hara tallied
three times and Driscoli broke away from
his guard and scored four times.
In the last few minutes of play, the Phi
Delt players scored almost at will and the
ball sailed through the basket on the first
play after the toss-up. The A. T. O.
guards, although tired out after the first
few mintues of play, held their opposing
forwards at bay until the middle of the
last half.
Neill played a fast and hard game for
Alpha Tau Omega, covering all the floor
and fighting all the time for possession
of the ball. Stratton playing center also
put up a good brand of basketball, but'
the lack of teamwork and fast passing
kept him from making many shots at the
basket.

The Phi Delta Theta team showed a
much improved game of basketball over
wliat they displayed when they lost their
first game last week to Delta Chi 10-8.
The players worked together as a unit
and with a good passing game and close
guarding easily held the Alpha Tau
Omega team without a field goal and at
the same time accumulated a total of
thirty-one points. The Alpha Tau Omega
team defeated the Zeta Psi team 12-3 last
week in the first game, but last night was
able to make only three points and those
all from free throws.
Driscoli Gives Exhibitions
Of Accurate Basket Shooting
Joe O'Hara started the scoring with a
field goal from the center of the floor
and followed that with another from un
der the basket. Paul O'Hara followed
suit with a couple of free throws and
Driscoli, who went in to the game just
before the lialf, caged a shot and ended
the scoring for that period.
The Phi Delta Theta players lost no
time in adding to their score in the sec
ond lialf and Logan at center opened up
with three pretty shot's in succession from
under the basket. Paul O'Hara tallied
three times and Driscoli broke away from
his guard and scored four times.
In the last few minutes of play, the Phi
Delt players scored almost at will and the
ball sailed through the basket on the first
play after the toss-up. The A. T. O.
guards, although tired out after the first
few mintues of play, held their opposing
forwards at bay until the middle of the
last half.
Neill played a fast and hard game for
Alpha Tau Omega, covering all the floor
and fighting all the time for possession
of the ball. Stratton playing center also
put up a good brand of basketball, but'
the lack of teamwork and fast passing
kept him from making many shots at the
basket.
The Phi Delta Theta team followed
up their shots well and made good use of
a swift passing game.
Middleton and Carey Pile
Up Points for Kappa Sigma
Kappa Sigma defeated Theta Delta Chi
18-1 in a one-sided game in which Middle
ton and Carey showed class for Kappa
Sigma. The Theta Delta Chi team
which played yesterday showed the lack
of improvement in team play and basket
shooting visible in the other second round
games. Trago made the only point scored ■
for his team when he made good a free'
throw, in the first half.
At the start, the outcome of the game
seemed in doubt, but atfer the Kappa
Sigma forwards, Carey, Miller, and Es- :
kew got warmed up, the scoring started.
Most of the baskets were made in the final
half, in which Henderson and Clark,!
guards for 'I heta Delta Chi, were unable
to stop the onslaught.
Fast Kappa Psi Forwards
Display Excellent Teamwork
Until the beginning of the second half
of the Phi Kappa Psi-Delta Upsilon game,!
the teams seemed deadlocked with a pos
sibility of an overtime contest. But two'
liaskets by Newlin followed by two more
by Wittenberg gave Phi Kappa Psi a
sufficient lead to give them the victory.
Delta Upsilon made only one point in
the second half, a free throw by Lacey
making the count. Newlin and Witten- j
burg showed some of the best forward
line play of the tournament when they i
passed back and forth inside the foul line *
until an opportunity for a shot occurred, j
The fast pair worked down to the basket
several times and by snappy, passing caged
four shots between them.
Miller and Lacey handled the ball well i
for Delta Upsilon but were unable to get!
up to the basket many times. Clark was
responsible for the low score of the Phi
Kappa Psi team, preventing a number of
shots by careful guarding of his basket.
Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Hall,
first floor, teams, by defeating their op
ponents in Encina Gymnasium last night,
started the second round of the intra
muhal basketball tournament with a much
faster and more decisive style of play
than that which marked the opening of
the tournament a week ago.
Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma won
their games from weaker opponents by
scores of 14-6 and 18-1 respectively.
The Sequoia team which took the floor
| last night against El Tigre was the same
'one which defeated Theta Delta Chi 14-10
in last week's game. Although El Tigre
I had won an overtime contest from the
! Phi Kappa Psi team at the start, the
! Sequoia men surprised their opponents by
preventing them from making a single
field goal, winning by a score of 10-4.
Timmons Is Individual Star
In Sequoia-El Tigre Contest
Again, as last week, Timmons was the
individual star for Sequoia, scoring eight

of their ten points with four field goals
to his credit. His basket shooting was
accuratc and he sank shots from all an
gles and positions, missing a few close
shots by inches. Williard, at center for
Sequoia, made the other goal for his team
playing a hard game against Woodhead
his opponent, who was everywhere on
the floor.
Kennedy and Woodhead shot the fouls J
for El Tigre but both seemed unable j
to locate the basket when shooting from
the floor. Butterfield managed to work
the ball up to the Sequoia basket often,
but neither lie nor his forwards could 1
make the counters. None of the El Tigre
men could get free from their opponents, !
who stuck tight and when unable to fol- j
low dropped back and formed a five-man j
defense for their goal.
Poor passing and little team work
slowed the game up and although the
men worked hard they failed to move the |
ball over the floor with any accuracy and
speed.
