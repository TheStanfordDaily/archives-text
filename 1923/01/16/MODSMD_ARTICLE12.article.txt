# SECOND ROUND OPENED
## Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Win Intramural Court Contests 
### 
Phi Delta Theta and Sequoia Hall,
first floor, teams, by defeating their op
ponents in Encina Gymnasium last night,
started the second round of the intra
muhal basketball tournament with a much
faster and more decisive style of play
than that which marked the opening of

Phi Kappa Psi and Kappa Sigma won

preventing them from making a single
field goal, winning by a score of 10-4.

Sequoia, made the other goal for his team
playing a hard game against Woodhead

the ball up to the Sequoia basket often,
but neither lie nor his forwards could 1

men could get free from their opponents, !
who stuck tight and when unable to fol- j

defense for their goal.
Poor passing and little team work
slowed the game up and although the
men worked hard they failed to move the |
