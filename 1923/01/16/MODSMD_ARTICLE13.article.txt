What' is the correct procedure when
you are held up by desperate bandits,
and all your valuables about to be taken
j away ?
This was the question seething in the
i minds of at least hree Stanford men and
two California students during the hold
up of a popular cafe in Oakland Saturday
night.
The Stanford students decided that
complete agreement with all that the ban
dits did, said, acted, and, if possible,
thought, was the best conduct under the
circumstances. Accordingly, tlu-y
I reached as high as possible, and held it
| as long as possible ,in order to show the
bandits that they were whole-heartedly
in accord with the proceedings.
Perhaps one of the California men had
i just come from a movie of our wild-west
I life perhaps they had been reading Rex
i Beach; at any rate, one of them started
a desperate fight to save the women and
children and all the valuables in a heroic
struggle.
Unfortunately, the thug in charge had
failed to keep up 011 current literature.
\V ith one swift motion he cracked his
revolver down on the skull of the budding
Tom Mix, and when the hero of the eve
ning aroused from his slumbers the rob
bers and his wallet were both gone.
It was reported at a late hour this
morning that the Tom Mix movies have
lost a patron.
