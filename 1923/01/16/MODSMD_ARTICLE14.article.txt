# BABE QUINTET PLAYS LIVERMORE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Livermore, the home of the famous
Livermore Cowboy five, is sending its
high school quintet to the campus to
night hoping to take the measure of
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman team.
If advance rumors of the strength of
the preps mean anything, the babes
will have to travel at top speed to take
the decision.
Hunt had his charges working hard
last night at passing, shooting baskets,
and dribbling, winding up the practice
with a lively scrimmage. The Babes
showed vast improvement in the Low
ell game over their playing in the San
Jose contest three days before. The
forwards are beginning to get their
eyes on the basket and the whole team
looks more like a machine than five
individual players.
The team will probably start against
the valley lads with the same person
nel that started the Lowell game. Mor
rison is out temporarily with a bad
ankle and Carter is filling his shoes at
center very capably. The big fellow is
getting some confidence in himself and
is improving with every game.
Nevers and Frazier have first call on
the forward positions. These men play
well together and although Frazier
cannot locate the basket with very
great regularity, he is a valuable man
in advancing the ball and on the de
i fense. Nevers has partially forgotten
i the one-man game and his shots are
1 finding the hoop with greater regular
ity.
Mitchell and MacDermot are the
best bets for the defensive jobs.
Mitchell is the most valuable man on
the squad at his running guard posi
tion. He is fast, handles the ball well,
and is making more baskets since he
discovered that no law prevents him
from taking an occasional shot. Mac-
I Dermot is a good standing guard. He is
! a steady player who uses his head at
I all times and can be counted on to
i come through in a tight place.
The Babe contest will serve as a
[ curtain raiser for the Varsity-St. Igna
l tius game and will begin at 7 o'clock.
