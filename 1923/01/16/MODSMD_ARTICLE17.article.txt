# VARSITY BASEBALL PRACTICE HINDERED BY WET DIAMOND
## Forty-Five Men to Be Divided Into Four Nines; Workouts Scheduled Every Afternoon 
### 
With the advent of a modified form
of spring weather and an occasional dry
field on which to work out, Coach Harry
Wolter's 1923 baseball varsity is now
getting in the early rudiments of dia
mond technique. For the past week, five
old varsity men and forty others re
cruited from last year's freshman squad
together with a raft of amateurs, have
reported for light workouts.
Four Squads Practice
No intensive training lias yet been
started due to the wet condition of the
playing fields. Coach Wolter intends di
viding the squad into four baseball nines
and four or five innings will then be
played every afternoon. If weather con
ditions permit, the first game will be run
off tomorrow afternoon.
The schedule for this year's varsity is
not yet complete, but to date nine teams
have been booked to mix with the Cardi
nal. The first contest is scheduled for
February 3, when the San Francisco Bank
of California nine traveling under the
name of the "Jeffersons" will invade the
Stanford campus. This organization has
always been fairly strong and Wolter's
men have resolved to make it the first
stepping stone to a successful season.
That of course means a win in the first
game of the year.
