# A 						YEAR'S SHOWING
## 
### 
Ed Lamb came to Stanford only a year ago and in
the time since lie first set foot on the Campus he has
succeeded in making the place about as fire-proof as
is possible without all the most expensive and mod
ern equipment, lie has succeeded in getting what
many others have failed to attain â€”co-operation.
And it is to the fine spirit of co-operation in his work
that he lays the responsibility for his marked success
as Fire Marshal. If what he says is true, then it is
of very little credit to three living groups on the
Campus that they have failed to clean up their estab
lishments.
It is not the intention of the Daily to make public
the names of these three groups which are distinctive
only because they failed to co-operate in a matter
that may in case of fire be of vital interest to them.
But in case the University takes measures to cancel
the leases of the living groups in question, the names
will become news and will be used as such. Ed
Lamb would like to make a one hundred per cent
record. Those who know him think that he is likely
to get his wish.
