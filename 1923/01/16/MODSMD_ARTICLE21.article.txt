1 It was to St. Ignatius last year that the Stanford
basketball team lost its first practice game. In this
small college five the Cardinal has always found in
past years one of the stiffest competitors of the court
season. While nobody expects Andy Kerr's men to
come out of the Pavilion tonight without having
registered another victory, it is not likely that any
great score will pile up. Basketball is one sport in
which registration statistics fail to play a very im
portant part because developed talent has equal op
portunities with natural talent in a game of this sort.
The Stanford five will have to be at its best to prove
any definite superiority over the San Francisco
squad.
