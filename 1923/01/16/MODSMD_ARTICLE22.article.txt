# THE 						YELL-LEADING FUTURE
## 
### 
The announcement that tryouts are now in order
for assistant yell leaders brings to mind the talk
about these gentry last quarter when it was main
tained by large numbers of students that college
spirit as manifested at athletic games and rallies all
depended upon the yell leader, himself. There is
undoubtedly much truth in'lhe assertion. In order
to get the proper results a yell leader should be at
once a leader, a driver, and a dynamo of energy. lie
should be alive to all interests, quick-witted, and
endowed with natural qualities of enthusiasm.
Where do we get such people ?
It might as well be admitted right now that 110
such candidates will be available until the yell leader
occupies a more respected position in the student
body than he docs at present. If it is necessary to
put the promoter of enthusiasm on a plane with the
highest of high offices in the student body, it should
be done. Under existing circumstances, not one man
in ten aspires toward the position because it begets
much criticism and scant praise.
But if we are ever to get anywhere in this particu
lar department, it is time to start getting out prom
ising candidates, at the same time making the posi
tion of yell leader worth while as a student body
office.
