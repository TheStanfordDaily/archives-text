# THE
						CALL FOR THE GRADUATE
## 
### 
Stanford has always welcomed graduate students
from other institutions and yet nothing is done to
make these men and women feel themselves a part
of Stanford life. As one graduate expressed it,
"We are tolerated bilt not encouraged!" The case
of the Stanford graduate is different since he still
occupies the place created for himself while an

undergraduate, but this false attitude does strike
many of our graduate students from other universi
ties. It is due, it seems, to the absence of any
organization to unite the graduates into a body.
Naturally, men and women coming here for ad
vanced work are no longer interested in under
graduate activities and politics but if the University
is to gain the most from these students, there must
be some organization through which their ideas
may be crystallized into action. The graduate brings
to the University the fruit of several years' experi
ence in his respective field; and his maturer judg
ment can make a valuable contribution to student
thought. The success of graduate organizations in
eastern universities proves that they fill a real need.
Isn't it about time Stanford made some provision
for the interests of its graduate students?
