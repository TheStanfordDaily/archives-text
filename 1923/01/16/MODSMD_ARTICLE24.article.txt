A gent who was anxious to dance
As they do in Chicago and France
Substituted for prancing,
Immovable "dancing,"
And put all the roughs in a trance.

A. Goofus thought practical jokes
Make life quite worth while; so he soaks
All the beds of his friends
With wet paint, odds and ends.
They sent his remains to his folks.

Poor Joe met a horrible fate;
He died, for the shock was too great.
As he stood in the line,
A new post-office sign
Said, "The mail for today isn't late."

The county nurse called at the house where there
was a case of infectious disease.
"And have you a bath in the house?" asked the prac
tical visitor.
"Yes, mam," was the reply, "but thank Gawd we've
never had to use it!"

"The terrible power of the skunk.
Is merely historical bunk!"
Said one Mr. Slater,
But just a week later,
He sold his new trousers for junk.

Enough of this subterfuge, say we. Let's be frank
and above board, or at least frank, with our enemies.
Think how much more satisfying it would be to walk
up to the bobbed-liair corrector, and instead of remark
ing, "Ah, there, Alycia, you're looking wundafil this
morning—" which she probably isn't, unless she happens
to be making out the bi-weekly ex questions —well,
anyway, wouldn't it be better to walk firmly up, look
her in both eyes, and exclaim: "Get out of my sight,
you mule-faced mud-fence, before I have the colic?"
Of course it would, especially if you do it after getting
safely out of her course.

Professors, especially, welcome an honest expression
of opinion among their classes. They even say so.
Imagine the cruel disappointment it is to an honest
professor to have someone say to him: "You know,
professor, I really enjoyed your course more than any
I have ever taken. It was so uplifting, so filled with
the higher moral tone." To which the prof replies in
disgust: "Well, well, that is most gratifying, because I
take a great deal of pride in that course myself. You
know (deceptive smirk) J-er-give some other courses
this quarter."

Think how it would please the old boy to corner him
in his office on registration day and address him re
spectively thus: "Look here, you fossilized old frost, I
think your course is just about the worst waste of time
of any pipe in the University, but I'm gonna take it
because I need the hours in your department. How
ever, you needn't think I'm going to take any notes, or
read your dam book, because 1 know more right now
about the lioofey you're passing out than you'll ever
learn. Get that, you half-witted wampus?"
Can't you imagine the pleasant anticipation with
which he will welcome such a frank student to his
class. Or can you?
