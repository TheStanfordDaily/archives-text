# Translation of Japanese Book Is Given to Library
## 
### 
A translation, in manuscript, of a
Japanese book, has recently been
given to the Library by Professor H.
C. Huggins, now of Keiogijuku Univer
sity in Tokyo, who formerly studied
at Stanford.
The original work is entitled Soken
Kisho, or "Estimation of Ornaments
on Swords," written by Inaba in 1781,
The translation was made in 1883 by a
Japanese for the late Captain Brink
ley, the author of "Japan" and other
histories of the Japanese people which
are among the few that we have in
English.
The book aims to act as a guide in
judging the character of workmanship
of the ornamental work in sword
furniture. It contains a geneological
study of the more celebrated sword
artists. A large space is devoted to
Goto, the house of celebrated artists.
The kind of tools employed in this
art are described and the methods'
used in combining the various metals
used in work are told. The book takes
up the study of leather work on swords
and seals, and gives a history of their
makers.
The original work was profusely il
lustrated but the manuscript does not
contain any prints.
The manuscript is divided into seven
volumes carefully written by hand.
Brinkley made use of the chapters de
voted to the sword in his history, but
despite that fact, the manuscript re
mains valuable because in it the Jap
anase view from technical, artistic,
and historical standpoints is given by
an expert.
