## MICHIGAN ATHLETIC GUIDE INVENTS FAST NEW GAME 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN â€”
"Speedball," a new game invented by
Elmer D. Mitchell, director of Intra
mural Athletics at the University of
Michigan, is taking a firm hold at
Michigan and other universities. The 1
game is a combination of football and
basketball, with the kicking element
of soccer also involved, and is said to
be faster than any of the parent sports. |
A ball kicked in the air may be played
with the hands until it touches the
ground, thus allowing the forward j
pass to be used with great effect. |
Scoring may be done by several meth- [
ods, and the key to the game is strate- j
gy, as worked out by the intramural 1
teams at Michigan.
