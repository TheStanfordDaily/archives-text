# HANDBALL MEN TO PREPARE FOR GAME WITH CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Practice for a coming intercollegiate
handball match with California will
start this week and continue until a
team of the six best players can be
chosen.
The date for the match is still pend
ing. It was to have been held last
quarter but owing to a conflict of ex
aminations at the two universities it
was postponed to the winter quarter
by mutual agreement. The future date
will be set for some time within the
next two weeks.
Members of the team who play
against California will win second
class minor sport letters. Several vet
erans are in college and have been
asked to report to C. W. Davis imme
diately in order to arrange a practice
period daily on the Peninsula Club
| box court in Palo Alto.
The men who have played before
and show up as likely members of this
year's team are: W. Welch, T. E. Col
vin, C. D. Rutter, R. M. Farley, J. B.
Sansone, M. M. Cohen, Fred Koba, and
L. H. Lowenstein. Any others desiring
to enter the competition preliminary
to the California match should also
report to Director Davis immediately.
