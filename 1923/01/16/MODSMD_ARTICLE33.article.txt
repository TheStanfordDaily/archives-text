# "OLD BOY" ISSUES CALL FOR MATERIAL
## 
### 
The Old Boy, now on the point of
closing the contribution list for the
forthcoming issue of the Chaparral,
has sent out one last call for copy.
This issue is going to be the Mourn
ful Number, and a large and mighty
list of contributors is wanted. There
has been a great tidal wave of poetry
flowing into the Old Boy's office, but
so far it has not been accompanied
with the desired amount of short stuff.
Contributions intended for the Mourn
ful Number should be forwarded im
mediately to Box 15, Campus.
The College Wits' Contest is now
in full swing, and Chappie is oiling the
Hammer up for some deadly work.
Last year Stanford took second in
Judge's annual race, and this time
Chaparral is out for blood. Not only
does considerable honor accrue to suc
cessful contributors to His Honor's
pages in the contest, but Judge also
pays liberally for accepted material.
Contributions intended to be credited to
Stanford in the College Wits' Contest
should be addressed to the Chaparral,
Box 15, Campus, and will be forwarded
in a body later.
