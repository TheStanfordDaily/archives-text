# U.C. Alumni Are Against Split of State Institution
## 
### 
Alumni of the University of Cali
fornia have taken a firm stand against
the proposed division of that institu
tion. Robert Sibley, executive man
ager of the Alumni Association, re
moved whatever doubt may have ex
isted about the condition at Berkeley.
"If there is an impending breach
between the northern and southern
portions of California, due to the ad
vocated split between the University
of California Southern Branch, and
the main institution at Berkeley, the
alumjii of the university are no party
to it,"he said.
"To attempt to create in this State
two universities means that both
would be condemned to mediocrity,"
asserted former President Barrows.
