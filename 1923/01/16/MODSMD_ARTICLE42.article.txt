# Son Dislikes Uninvited Sun in Early Morning

"D !" the Stanford son remarked
as the real sun pushed his head over the
horizon in an attempt to pierce the icy,
drizzling mist and give the peninsula a
little natural warmth and light.
No longer can Percy Reggy Algernon,
'27, respose in secluded slumber whence
all about him are in feverish states of
activity. He must toss back his robes,
hurriedly get dressed, and go about his
tasks. He cannot even shut out the un
invited light by pulling down the window
shades, for he hasn't any.
The aforesaid Percy resides in the Old
Union. The cause of all his vociferous
ejaculations is this: The big tree which
had so long stood outside his window on
the chained drive has at last been cut
down. Hence, the sunlight at the un
mirthful hour and said son's stormy pro
tests.
