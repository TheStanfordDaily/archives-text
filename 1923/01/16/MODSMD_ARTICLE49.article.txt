Six hundred dollars for one eve
ning's pleasure isn't half bad, is it?
Two Stanford students today are won
dering whether they "got off easy or
not." They are alive, it is true, but
how about the "600"?
It all happened last Friday night.
Lost in the darkness and late for an
engagement, the speed demons drove
the plunging sedan down a side road
to the main highway. The highway
approached all too fast, and when the
driver frantically pulled at his wheel,
the road refused to straighten out and
the car turned over with its occupants.
That happened at 12 midnight. Short
ly after, the frightened speed kings
climbed through the top door and to
safety without a single scratch, to
themselves.
