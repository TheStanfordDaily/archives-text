## 
### 
Delta Tau Delta defeated Phi Kappa
Sigma 9-8 yesterday afternoon in En
cina Gymnasium in the second round
contest in the intramural basketball
tournament. In the other games on the
day's schedule, Alpha Kappa Lambda
won over Zeta Psi 20-6, Chi Psi took
their game from Kappa Alpha 16-9,
Sigma Nu beat Alpha Sigma Phi 17-3,
and Delta Chi won from El Capitan
19-10.
The Delta Tau Delta-Phi Kappa
Sigma contest was close throughout
and resulted in the closest score yet
registered by any of the intramural
teams. The score at the half stood 4-2
for Delta Tau Delta and the Phi Kappa
Sigma players were unable to over
come the lead before the final whistle
ended the game.
Meyers and de Back played the for
ward line for Delta Tau Delta and by
fast passing and good teamwork suc
ceeded in making all of the points for
their team between them. Each for
ward made a field goal in each half
and de Back shot the foul which gave
the Delta Tau Delta team the victory.
Crandall scored two field goals for
Phi Kappa Sigma in the second half
and with another one by Graham in
the same period brought, the score up
even with that of the Delta Tau Delta
team. But the foul which de Back
threw in the last few minutes of play
decided the game and removed any
chance of an overtime contest.

Meyers played the same fast game
that he did against Alpha Sigma Phi
in his first contest and Collett played
a large part in the passing game al
though he failed to tally. The Delta
Tau Delta team won its first contest
from Alpha Sigma Phi 15-7 and Phi
Kappa Sigma took its first game from
Chi Psi 15-5. Thomas, who starred in
that game ,did not show up so well
yesterday, failing to make a single
point.
El Capitan Leads Delta Chi at
Half But Fails to Hold Pace
El Capitan started out to beat Delta
Chi in the Pavilion and were leading
their opponents at the end of the first
half 10-6. But they were unable to in
crease their score by a single point in
the last half and the Delta Chi team
got under way and registered thirteen
points, giving them the game 19-10.
Tritle was responsible for 11 of the
points made by Delta Chi, getting
away from Wright, the El Capitan
guard, almost at will during the sec
ond half. Suffern and Whitfield made
most of their points in the first half.
After their team got some teamwork
into their play they held the ball until
Tritle could get loose and make some
close shots from under the basket. By
this method of feeding the ball to
Tritle, the Delta Chi team soon pulled
ahead of El Capitan which lacked the
endurance to overcome the Delta Chi
lead and keep their opponents' for
wards well guarded.
White made two of the five field
goals for El Capitan and played all
over the floor in his attempts to get
his hands on the ball for a shot at the
basket. Fain also played a hard game
at center.
Walker could not get away from his
guard long enough to make more than
one basket for El Capitan and his ac
curate shooting was not in evidence
as much as when he made the eleven
points for his team last week when
they were defeated by Alpha Kappa
Lambda 37-11.
Delta Chi, by winning yesterday,
scored its second victory of the tourna
ment, having defeated Phi Delta Theta
10-8 last week.
Cornell Stars as Alpha Kappa
1 Lambda Defeats Zeta Psi Team
Alpha Kappa Lambda easily defeat
ed the weak Zeta Psi team yesterday
20-G. allowing the Zeta Psi players
only three field goals, all in the last
half of the game. Cornell was the
leading point scorer for Alpha Kappa
Lambda just as when they defeated
El Capitan 37-11 last week. In the
latter game he made thirteen points
and yesterday boosted his total to
twenty-one.
So poor was the defense of the Zeta
Psi team that every player but Van
derburgh made a field goal, Sloan
making three, Howe two, and Hard
wicke one, besides what Cornell
scored. Solomon showed the best form
for Zeta Psi, shooting two field goals
from the middle of the floor. Hazeltine
made the other basket on a follow-up
shot.
Chi Psi Wins From Kappa
Alpha 16 to 9 in Slow Game
Players on the Chi Psi and Kappa
Alpha teams took turns in playing
under each other's basket in a game
in which the Chi Psi team showed the
greater degree of accuracy and won
16-9. G. Hayes fought hard for posses
sion of the ball during the whole game
and made many shots at the basket
which rolled around the rim of the
hoop in the most exasperating fashion.
He did manage to make two shots
count and with one by Hicks and two
by McCandless his team got enough
points to win.
The Chi Psi team showed consider
able confidence in its passing as well
as in its shooting and general floor
play. The passing was not always
accurate and several times Cook and
W. Hays led the ball slip through
their fingers. Cavanaiigh kept down
the Kappa Alpha score by his close
guarding and Beeson, who made all
six points for Kappa Alpha when they
were defeated by Sigma Nu 41-6 was
unable to break loose until the final
period when he tallied twice. Mowers
played the best game for Kappa Alpha,
aiding his teammates by good passing
and careful following of the ball.
Aydelotte Fails to Find Hoop
In Sigma Nu's 17 to 3 Victory
Aydelotte had an off-night last night,
when the Sigma Nu team met Alpha
Sigma Phi, and shot only two goals
during the entire game, both coming
in the last minutes of play. In the
first game Aydelotte played, he scored
eight field goals for Sigma Nu, helping
materially in the 41-6 defeat of Kappa
Alpha last week.
During the whole of the first half
only fpur points were made by both
teams. Bragg caged the only shot from
the floor and Aydelotte made a num
ber of close shots earlier in the game.
Ferguson and Campbell both at
tempted long shots for Alpha Sigma
Phi but failed to make any of them
good with the exception of one by
Campbell towards the end of the game.
Welsh played a fast game, hung onto
the ball well and dribbled cleverly but
he failed to get close enough to the
basket to tally.
The Sigma Nu team used teamwork
at the expense of a few more shots
and before the end of the game the
results were evident in several suc
cessful tries from under the basket.
Thede and Dwight played strong de
fensive games for Sigma Nu, covering
their men well.
