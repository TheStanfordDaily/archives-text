# HEROD'S CRUELTY PORTRAYED BY BASSETT
## Battle of Vanity and Love Delineated in Character of Famous King of Jews 
### MIRIAM HILTON 
"Terrible Herod of the New Testa
ment cringing and servile to the power
of Rome, but selfish, cruel, and despotic
to those beneath him." This characteri
zation by Professor L. E. Bassett was
forcefully portrayed in his rendition of
Stephen Phillips' poem drama, "Herod,"
last evening in the Little Theater.
The closing lines, "They who grasp the
world must pay with misery and sin, and
ever ransom the outward victor with in
ward loss," sum up the tragedy of
Herod's life. Aside from a stressing of
his great but selfish love for his wife,
Mariamne, the story of Herod is histor
ically correct.
Professor Bassett's finished character
portrayal gave a necessary dramatic
touch to the beautifully poetic lines. In
his reading, he made the most of several
fine situations, which demonstrated Phil
lips' knowledge of dramatic values.
Herod's speech on the verge of mad
ness, when he "summons" the Queen, was
particularly vivid. "To my will no limit
hath been set—l will create her out of
endless yearnings: cannot I imitate in
furious ecstacy what God has made?"
The plot hinges upon the murder of
Aristibulus, the Queen's brother, at the
instigation of Herod. Through this deed
he loses his wife's love, and in a moment
of selfish rage, he is tricked by Salome
and her mother into causing Mariamne's
death by poison.
When the King's tottering reason
grasps the fact of the Queen's death, lie
goes mad with remorse, and the final
scene pictures Herod, stricken at the
height of his power, standing in a cata
leptic trance by the body of Mariamne.
