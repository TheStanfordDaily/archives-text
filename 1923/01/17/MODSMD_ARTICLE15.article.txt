# ANNIVERSARY OF MEMORIAL CHURCH WILL BE OBSERVED
## 
### 
The twentieth anniversary of the dedi
cation of the Stanford Memorial Church
will he observed by special services in
the church next Sunday morning and
afternoon. So far as possible the pro
gram of the dedicatory exercises when
the church was opened for the first time,
on Sunday, January 25, 1903, will be re
peated.
Dr. Jordan will read the same first les
son as was read then and Dr. Wilbur, in
similar fashion, will read the second
lesson.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, chaplain of
the Memorial Church now, as he was
then, will in the morning services next
Sunday recall some of the things h? said
in his address twenty years ago and note
the progress that has been made sinre
then. At the dedicatory exerci.scs in 190.3
the morning sermon was preached by the
Rev. Dr. R. Hcbcr Newton. Dr. Gard
ner made the address at the services
which were held in the church in the
afternoon.
This year, following the custom that
has developed, the afternoon services will
be musical and Dr. Gardner will speak
briefly, his talk dealing with music.
The Daily Palo Alto on the Sunday of
the dedication of the church twenty
years ago, issued a special twelve-page
edition of the little four-column paper
of that time. It contained the addresses
of Dr. Newton and Dr. Gardner and
much material illustrated with half tones
concerning the church itself. The Daily
Palo Alto quoted Dr. Newton as saying:
"This noble building which is opened
today, a decade after the founding of
the University, is no mere afterthoughtâ€”
it is an integral part of the original plan
of the founders.
"In the large and luminous planning
of the founders of the University, it was
decided that its church would minister to
the spiritual life of the University after
a fashion worthy of a University. The
charter ordered that the church should
be forever free from any ecclesiastical re
lationships; that the teachings from its
pulpit should lie non-sectarian; and that
the worship should be such that in it all
might freely unite. This provision com
mands the unhesitating acquiescence of
those who arc now placed in charge of
the church.
"The pulpit of this church is to try to
find the common denominator of our
manifold forms of Christianity. It is to
present those essential, ethical, ajid'
spiritual truths which are the heritage of
all who bear the name of 'Christian'."
Dr. Gardner in his address said:
"In ancient days, schools and colleges
were added to the church, for the church
was then the teacher. Here the old or
der changeth, yielding place to the new;
a church is added to a University.
"Hut this is no afterthought; it is the
consummation of a plan. Stanford Uni
versity rests upon a religious foundation.
Its charter declares the existence of an
all-wise and beneficent Creator; and that
obedience to his laws is the highest duty
of man. The University was by the
founders designed for the l>cnefit of man
kind. not only intellectually, but physic
ally, and materially. Provision having
been made for the physical and intellec
tual welfare of the members of the Uni
versity, provision is now made for their
moral and spiritual development.
"Here, in the inauguration of this work
is the recognition of religion as a prin
ciple in the culture and education of men.
"And, by and by, must come, to make
the University complete, an academic de
partment for the critical study of Bible
literature and history and the general
science and history of religion. For the
present this church has been added to
the University to conserve a principle
which was a definite part of the foun
ders' plan.
"Religion is to be taught, not casually
and without proper place, but daily and
as a necessary vital part of the Uni
versity,
"Here by the western shore of the
New World, the theater of the drama of
the future, we begin today a unique ex
periment. No less an experiment than
this: To test whether a non-sectarian
church can minister to the spiritual needs
of a great University."
