# ANNIVERSARY OF MEMORIAL CHURCH WILL BE OBSERVED
## 
### 
The twentieth anniversary of the dedi
cation of the Stanford Memorial Church
will he observed by special services in
the church next Sunday morning and
afternoon. So far as possible the pro
gram of the dedicatory exercises when
the church was opened for the first time,
on Sunday, January 25, 1903, will be re
peated.
Dr. Jordan will read the same first les
son as was read then and Dr. Wilbur, in
similar fashion, will read the second
lesson.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner, chaplain of
the Memorial Church now, as he was
then, will in the morning services next
Sunday recall some of the things h? said
in his address twenty years ago and note
the progress that has been made sinre
then. At the dedicatory exerci.scs in 190.3
the morning sermon was preached by the
Rev. Dr. R. Hcbcr Newton. Dr. Gard
ner made the address at the services
which were held in the church in the
afternoon.
This year, following the custom that
has developed, the afternoon services will
be musical and Dr. Gardner will speak
briefly, his talk dealing with music.

the University, is no mere afterthought—
it is an integral part of the original plan
of the founders.
"In the large and luminous planning
of the founders of the University, it was
decided that its church would minister to

charter ordered that the church should
be forever free from any ecclesiastical re

pulpit should lie non-sectarian; and that
the worship should be such that in it all

those who arc now placed in charge of
the church.
"The pulpit of this church is to try to

manifold forms of Christianity. It is to
present those essential, ethical, ajid'
