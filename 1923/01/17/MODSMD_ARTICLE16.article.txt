# ST. IGNATIUS GIVEN BEATING BY CARDS IN ROUGH BATTLE
## Stanford Quintet Comes From Behind to Win Game 25 to 19 
### 
Coach Andy Kerr's varsity basketball team added one more scalp to its
swiftly growing belt by coming from behind in the second half of last night's
contest and defeating the St. Ignatius five, 25 to 19. The game was one of the
hardest fought and roughest played on the Pavilion floor this season.
Living up to their reputation of being one of the best squads in the bay
region, the Ignatians threw a scare into the Cardinal fans by holding the lead
all through the first half of the game. Both teams started off slow, each
counting only one field goal in the first period. Begley, however, had the
best of Rogers in the free throw department and when the timekeeper's gun

announced the ten-minute rest period,
Connolly's men were leading by a 7
to 4 score.
Something happened between halves.
Maybe it was something that Coach Kerr
had to say to the players. Anyway, the
Cardinal five came back and played the
best game that they have been credited
with this year. A field goal and three
free throws by Captain Lefty Rogers at
the opening of the second half gave the
Stanfordites the lead that they never re
linquished throughout the rest of the
game. The St. Ignatius crew lead by
Morrissey and Begley attempted several
rallies during the last fifteen minutes, but
clever guarding and passing on the part
of the Cardinal five caused the hope of
the Connollyites to sink each time.
Andy Kerr's ability as a coach was
plainly imprinted in the play of the Stan
ford team in the latter part of the St.
Ignatius contest. The San Francisco
squad of veterans were outplayed in ev
ery department of the game in the sec
ond half with the exception of long shots,
Morrisey showing exceptional ability here
by dropping in three from the center of
the floor.
One of the outstanding points in the
playing of the Stanford quintet last night
was the fight put up by tlie players. Ev
ery man was fighting continually for the
possession of the ball, while their
fense gave the St. Ignatius but small op
portunity for close range shots. Begley,
touted as one of the best forwards on the
Pacific Coast, was given lttle chance to
show what he could do and was forced
to content himself with but one field goal.
In Rogers, McHose, and Janssen, Kerr
has the possibility of developing one 6f
the most powerful offensive combinations
in the conference. McHose and Rogers
had a regular field day during the last
half, "Nip" registering four goals to
"Lefty's" three. Janssen, suffering with
a weak ankle, played only a part of the
game, but during the time he was in
showed much of his last year's form.
