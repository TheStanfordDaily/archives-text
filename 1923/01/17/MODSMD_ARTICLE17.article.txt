# SPEED IN LAST HALF WINS FOR FRESHMEN
## 
### 
When Ernie Nevers, George Frazier,
and Johnny Carter finally found the
basket along in the second half, the
freshman scuffle with Livermore High
School began to look more like a basket
ball game.
The final count was, Freshmen, 22;
{Jvermore, 13. At the start of the third
quarter it was 6-2, Babes.
Previous to that, the work of the
.reshmen looked more like slow motion
pictures of five men passing the buck.
Frazier, forward; Nevers, forward,
and Carter, center, depended almost en
tirely on the passing game. In the first
quarter they took plentiful shots at the
bucket, and only once came even close.
In the second period, Nevers took a
chance on a long, straight shot from the
side, and made it, followed a minute later
by Mitchell with another lucky one frum
the same place. After the half the Dinks
speeded up, broke through the preppers'
lines, and began to pop the egg regularly
into the cage.
Defensively, the Babes were all that
could be asked in the first stanza; at the
end they spent most of their time on of
fense.
Captain Harold Wright, standing
guard on the prep quintet, was taken off
the floor with a broken shoulder in the
first quarter. The game as a whole was
not especially rough, and the referee
helped to hurry things along by extreme
lenience in calling fouls.
Nevers was high point man for the
Dinks, checking in with five field goals.
Frazier scored two, Mitchell and Carter
one apiece. McDermot played his usual
steady game at guard, working in well
with Mitchell.
Billy McGlinchey and Bonnetti did
most of the heavy work for Livermore.

end they spent most of their time on of
fense.
Captain Harold Wright, standing
guard on the prep quintet, was taken off
the floor with a broken shoulder in the
first quarter. The game as a whole was
not especially rough, and the referee
helped to hurry things along by extreme
lenience in calling fouls.
Nevers was high point man for the
Dinks, checking in with five field goals.
Frazier scored two, Mitchell and Carter
one apiece. McDermot played his usual
steady game at guard, working in well
with Mitchell.
Billy McGlinchey and Bonnetti did
most of the heavy work for Livermore.

When Ernie Nevers, George Frazier,
and Johnny Carter finally found the
basket along in the second half, the
freshman scuffle with Livermore High
School began to look more like a basket
ball game.
The final count was, Freshmen, 22;
{Jvermore, 13. At the start of the third
quarter it was 6-2, Babes.
Previous to that, the work of the
.reshmen looked more like slow motion
pictures of five men passing the buck.
Frazier, forward; Nevers, forward,
and Carter, center, depended almost en
tirely on the passing game. In the first
quarter they took plentiful shots at the
bucket, and only once came even close.
In the second period, Nevers took a
chance on a long, straight shot from the
side, and made it, followed a minute later
by Mitchell with another lucky one frum
the same place. After the half the Dinks
speeded up, broke through the preppers'
lines, and began to pop the egg regularly
into the cage.
Defensively, the Babes were all that
could be asked in the first stanza; at the
end they spent most of their time on of
fense.
