# THE 						WOMEN'S CLUBHOUSE
## 
### 
A glance down the announcement column of the
Daily Palo Alto will show the extensive use of the
Women's Clubhouse as a center for all kinds of
meetings and University functions. The question
arises, where did committees and clubs meet eight
years ago prior to the opening of the Clubhouse?
.Where were jolly-ups and "non-partisan" dances
held and where did Ram's Head choruses practice
before this building was erected? The answer is
that student organizations met in Quad basements
or any other available place, however inconvenient.
About eleven years ago, Stanford alumnae and
friends of the University became interested in the
question of a campus center for student meetings,
particularly for the women. They set to work
collecting money, chiefly through gifts, for the pro
posed building and three years later, the Women's
Clubhouse was opened. But since that time, Feb
ruary, 1915, many improvements and additions
have been made through the loyal efforts of the
â€¢Clubhouse Board and other friends of the Univer
sity.
The Women's Clubhouse has been called the one
great enterprise of Stanford women and yet few
of the present college generation have any concep
tion of the time and labor that have gone into its
building. We accept the existence of the Clubhouse
as a matter of course; it never occurs to the hun
dreds of students who use it daily that there was a
time when it wasn't there for their convenience.
To the Clubhouse Board and other women who
have worked tirelessly for our benefit, we owe a
great measure of appreciation. And we can show
this appreciation through our hearty cooperation
with the Board in paying off the remaining portion
of the Clubhouse debt.
