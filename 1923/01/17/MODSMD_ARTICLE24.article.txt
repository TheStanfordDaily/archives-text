# THE 						STUDENT EMPLOYMENT BUREAU
## 
### 
' At the instance of Mrs. Elizabeth Snell a student
employment bureau has been formed for the purpose
of cooperating- with the Appointment Office in its
work and to inform the undergraduate body of op
portunities offered by the office.
Few people knew until the series of articles that
appeared in campus magazines last year how much
good work was being done by Mrs. Snell for Stan
ford students who are financially short. Few knew
how Mrs. Snell has extended the field of the Ap
pointment Office to supplying information and es
tablishing employment connections for alumni and
graduates. Since that time, however, little has been
done by the student body in the way of cooperation.
There are enough part-time employment and full
time temporary employment students among the
approximately 2600 enrolled to make it well worth
the while of every student to get in touch with the
Appointment Office if for no other reason than to
be informed of its field of servicc. The majority
of undergraduates at least have friends who need
work. It is certainly the duty of every under
graduate under such circumstances to cooperate in
every way to make the finding of employment easy.
Often more time is spent in looking for a job than
is spent on the work itself. This is particularly
true in the case of new students who are wholly
uninformed and yet have as much right to consid
eration as any other Stanford people.
The ideal of the Appointment Office is SERVICE.
In order to achieve the ends in view better informa
tion and more publicity are necessary. Neither of
these is possible without student interest. It is for
the Student Employment Bureau to supply informa
tion and to make its work public. It remains, then,
for the student body as a whole to assume some of

the responsibilities of the Appointment Office. Here
is the easiest and most effeetive way of accomplish
ing this task. Inform students who need work of
the purposes of the Office. Tell them that it has
classified work on and near the campus. Tell them
that it has a library for self-supporting students.
Tell them that it is through the Appointment Office
that Stanford has been able to keep many of its
financially poor students in college. Having done
this, go to the Office yourself and learn from Mrs.
Snell what more can be done.
And remember through it all that if you are
porperly enrolled in the Appointment Office your
self your opportunities for being well placed after
graduation will be far better' than you supposed.
Mrs. Snell is operating in a bigger field than the
ordinary undergraduate supposes.
