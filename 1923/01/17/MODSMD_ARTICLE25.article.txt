THE COURT REPORTER
Abie Mazda has been up in court again. While the
charge is not so very serious, yet the judge and attorney
for the state are insisting on knowing where his last
wife has disappeared.
* * *
Abie Mazda's case was discharged today. Upon close
questioning it developed that Abie's most recent wife
died accidentally. She got her throat caught in between
Abie's fingers one night and strangled to death.
* * *
When this queer angle of the case developed, the
court was thrown into a hubbub of quiet. The spectators
were knocked speechless by the brilliant defense of the
attorney for the defense, and chatte/ed away most
unmindful of his puerile flow of wit.
* * *
Cabbages hates to say a great deal about the plans,
hopes, ambitions, etc., ad infinitum, of them what knows
their eggs. But can you imagine all the lawyers, en
gineers, medics, and so on, ad curriculum, grouped into
their special dormitories?
Life and conversation in the lawyer's hall would be
just one darned case after another; for the engineers it
would be just one surveying grip after another, and
for the medics just one corpse after another, and so on,
ad nauseum.

For three in one canoe.

She was a trim little nurse, and the very picture of
efficiency as she stood with her finger-tips on the pulse
of her patient and her eyes fixed upon her tiny wrist
watch. Missing never a beat she counted faithfully,
watching for the minute hand to crawl one short space
around the dial. She counted and counted, with her
eyes growing troubled and anxious. At the Four-hun
dred-and-eighty-ninth pulsation—my God —she fainted
dead away with a fluttering sight ....
After that she never forgot to wind her watch!

The things one does while at Stanford: holding a
letter from home to the light while passing out of the
post-office. The passing out depends on the relation of
the result to your bank balance.

But the stuff was so rank
