Swimming will soon be one of the
best-known sports on the Pacific Coast
if the plans of Graduate Manager
Behrens and Swimming Commissioner
Ernie Smith of the Piedmont Baths at
Oakland are carried out successfully.
They are endeavoring to have an inter
collegiate meet at the Baths some time
during the latter part of the season
that will decide the championship of
the Pacific Coast universities.
Eleven games have been scheduled
for the Stanford freshmen baseballers
this season. Some strong nines are
slated to meet the Babes and it will
take a good team to emerge victorious
in a majority of the games. Last year
was the first attempt at freshman
baseball at Stanford since 1908. It was
a success and the games with Cali
fornia were well attended and hard
fought. The freshman nine developed
some of the best gall tossers that the
Cardinal has ever had.
Fired by the dramatic and interest
gripping details of the preliminaries to
the American Revolution, a class in
American History this morning were
taking rapid notes on the professor's
lecture. The members of the class tem
porarily forgot that they were in a
classroom at Stanford. One freshman
hid behind his notebook; a member of
the "500" picked up her skirts in dis
may and started for an open window.
The lecturer regained his equilibrium
and said, "No, that's not a shot. It's the
blasted blasting down at the old Li
brary site. Henceforth, my course on
the Revolution will be attended by
these shots. This will add a touch of
realism."
"If Belgian relief is the work of any
one group of people it is the work of
Stanford," declared Mrs. Vernon Ly
man Kellogg, wife of Professor Kel
logg, head of the Entomology depart
ment, in her lecture on "Belgium Re
lief" in the Little Theater last night.
"There is the greatest bond of sym
pathy between the workers in Belgium
and this University. Mr. Hoover
doesn't talk very often, but when he
does speak to his helpers, it is often
of Stanford."
