# LEADER INSTALLS NEW ROWING SYSTEM AT YALE
## 
### 
By discarding the old modified Eng
lish stroke and substituting the Coni
bear system, which he taught at Wash
ington, Coach Ed Leader of the Yale
crew has changed the entire system
of rowing at Yale and is building up
from the bottom. Leader's stroke has
more leg-drive in it, makes necessary
a longer slide, a steadier application
of power and a sharper, firmer catch
than the former Yale method, say ex
perts who have been watching it.
