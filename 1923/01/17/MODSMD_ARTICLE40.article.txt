TON —"Potatoes can be successfully
fed to dairy cows, to the extent of 20
pounds daily," says Prof. E. V. Elling
ton, head of the dairy department of
the State College of Washington.
"Ordinarily potatoes are not much
used for feeding dairy cattle. When
the price is low, however, they may
be used to advantage. They are valu
able chiefly on account of the crabo
hydrates they contain. When fed un
cooked they serve the same purpose
in the ration as any other root crop
or silage, contributing succulence to
the ration. The dry matter in potatoes
is probably of slightly lower nutritive
value than in corn silage.
"When fed in too large quantities,
potatoes will injure the flavor of the
milk somewhat.
"Cows will relish cooked potatoes,
and these may be used successfully if
not more than 30 lbs. are fed each cow
a day."
