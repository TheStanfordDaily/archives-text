# SINGLES, DOUBLES TENNIS TOURNAMENT SET FOR NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Drawings for a singles and doubles
tennis tournament will be made from
the list of entries January 19 and 20
and the first round contest will start
Monday, Januray 23. The tournament
is an annual contest to determine the
ratings of the tennis players in the
University regardless of previous ex
perience or records. Every undergradu
ate registered in the University is
eligible to enter the tournament.
Ratings of the tennis players will be
made from the winners of the final
round contests. The first ten men
chosen will be allowed to play on the
varsity tennis courts and the eight
leading freshman players will be given
the use of the freshman tennis courts.
Any men who are eliminated in the
first few rounds of the tournament
will be allowed to challenge for a right
to continue to play.
After the ratings of the freshmen
and combined upper classes have been
decided, no changes in those ratings
will be made unless the lowest man
has been challenged and defeated. The
winner will substitute himself for the
last man in the ratings. He can then
advance in position of the ten men
rated by challenging the man directly
above him at any time and thus ad
vancing step by step towards the top
of the ranks.
