### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 17.â€”Two members of the Nevada
Sagehen Quintet, which has just fin
ished a two-game series with the Blue
and Gold five, played on "Corky" Court
wright's football eleven last fall.
Harrison and.Scranton hold down the
two guard positions on the basketball
court, but on the gridiron they play half
back and fullback, respectively. Har
rison is the bigger man of the two and
is used as standing guard while his team
mate does the running around the court.
The other members of the Nevada
squad confine their activities to the bas
ketball court. "Jimmy" Bradshaw who
coached the Redwood City High School
eleven last fall, is missed on the court
almost as much as he was on the grid
iron.

Two games with Andy Kerr's Stanford
five are scheduled before the Wolves
start the swing back to Reno.
Had it not been for Johnny Talt, the
star Bruin forward, the Nevadans might;
have had a chance to beat California in.
at least one of the two games. On both [
evenings Coach Earl Wight of Calif or
nia started his second string men. The [
Nevadans managed to hold the reserves [
fairly even, but then Wight shot in Talt
and his regulars, so that the Bruins I
walked away with both games by sub !
stantial scores.
The following men will probably start
for Nevada against Stanford next Friday
night: Fredericks and Clay, forwards;
Randall, center; Sscarton and Harrison,
guards.
The substitutes on the Reno squad in
elude Goodall ,center; Monehan and
Downing, forwards.
