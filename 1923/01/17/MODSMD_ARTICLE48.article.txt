Every day has its dog, every dog has
its day; if the dog once gets in, why not
let him stay ? But such is not right, say
the cops in their might, and when they
j show up, the dogs exit right.
Two dogs of some sort, with tails loose
; and short, appeared between halves on
the basketball court; as they stood in
| a group there a sound hit the roof air,
as of two hundred dagos partaking of
i soup fare. The whistles increased ,the
i cops at once ceased shooting craps in the
' hallway" where they always policed. One
I cop took one dog, another the other, and
both found the canines somewhat of a
j bother, but they led 'em away, not to
durance vile, but out of the doorway,
j quick step, single file.
