# RAM'S HEAD TO USE CAST OF FORTY MEN
## 
### 
More than 150 students have dramatic
tendencies which they wish to express,
according to Arnold Bayley, director of
the coining Ram's Head Show. That
number tried out for the play during
the last two days; of these some eighty
three were accepted. An exceptionally
large cast will be chosen for this play;
there is room for forty people, including
all the choruses.
Those passing the preliminary tryouts,
whose names did not appear in the paper
Tuesday, will find their names posted in
the Green Room, Economics building.
Bayley will notify the successful candi
dates by telephone this week when to
appear for second tryouts.
A meeting of lyric writers has been
called for 1 p. m. Thursday at the Beta
House for the purpose of completing the
necessary words for some of the songs.
Rehearsals will not commence until
next Monday at the earliest, according to
Bavley. The place and time will be an
nounced later.
