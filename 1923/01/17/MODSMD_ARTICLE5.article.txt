ESSEN, Jan. 17. —German mine op
erators in the Ruhr defied French
threats of arrest and confiscation and
refused today to deliver coal as de
manded.
The French, as a further punitive
step for this "passive sabotage," or
dered the army of occupation to seize
more Ruhr lands. Troops advanced
toward Muenster, which is outside the
zone originally designated for occupa
tion and march toward Hagen, to the
south of Dortmund, was expected be
fore the day is over.
General De Goutte had summoned
the operators, headed by Thyssen, and
threatened them with courtmartial and
imprisonment if deliveries did not com
mence this morning. The French gen
eral met stoic defiance from every
side today. Thyssen ignored the
threats; Hugo Stinnes moved his com
pany headquarters from Mulheim to
Hamburg. The latter is) not in the
Rhineland but is spending the winter
quietly at a resort.
If the French make good their threat
and arrest some of the operators the
Germans declare a general strike' in
the Ruhr will follow.
Coal Barons Arrested
LONDON, Jan. 17. —August Thyssen
and three other German coal barons
were arrested by the French today for
persistent refusal to obey General
Simons' orders regarding coal deliv
eries, according to a dispatch from
Dusseldorf. The Germans apparently
were not taken into custody but. were
told to consider themselves under ar
rest.
BERLIN, Jan. 17. — Essen miners
today rebuffed efforts of French of
ficers to inspect mines in the vicinity,
declaring the workers would quit the
pits at once "rather than work under
bayonets."
Can't Make Enough Marks
BERLIN, Jan. 17—The Reichsbank
cannot turn out paper money fast
enough to meet the country's needs as
the mark collapses. New bank notes
printed at the rate of 25,000,000 marks
a day do not supply the demand.
