from the attack of grippe which caused
him to leave his desk yesterday after
noon, was confined to his room today.
The president's condition, resulting
from a severe cold contracted a week
ago, is not serious, Secretary Chris
tian stated this morning, but Dr. Saw
yer, his personal physician, desires
that he remain quietly in his room and
not tax his strength for a day or two.
