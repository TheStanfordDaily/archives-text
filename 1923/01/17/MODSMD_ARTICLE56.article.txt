UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA —The precincts of Sport,
hitherto held almost inviolate by the
male element, have been invaded by
the übiquitous co-ed at the University
of Southern California. One more tra
dition has gone to smash with the ap
pointment of Miss Florence Jones as a
sport editor of the "Trojan." Anticipat
ing her promotion, Miss Jones made
a careful study of athletics from the
sidelines, and also took a course in the
principles of football coaching from
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson.
