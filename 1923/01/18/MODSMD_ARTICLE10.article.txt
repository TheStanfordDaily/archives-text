# Material Needed From Campus Humorists for College Wits' Contest
## 
### 
Forthcoming issues of the Chaparral
and the College Wits' Contest were the
chief topics of discussion at the meet
ing of Hammer and Coffin last night.
Material for the March issue is to be
supplied by the alumni in order that
campus contributions may spend their
full time preparing copy for the College
Wits' Contest, which closes March 1.
Stanford has ranked high in Judge's
annual competition, last year obtaining
second place, Cornell ranking first. This
year Chappie is hot after the prize and
bids fair to get topmost place. Material
for the College Wits' Contest should be
mailed to the Chaparral, Box 15, Campus.
