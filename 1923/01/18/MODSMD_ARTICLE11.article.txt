# LIGHTWEIGHT COURT TEAM EASY VICTORS OVER HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
Taking advantage of their oppon
ents' ragged teamwork, the Stanford
130-pound basketball team crushed the
Mountain View High School quintet
by the one-sided score of 37 to 15 in
the Pavilion last night. At no time
during the fracas were the Stanford
men headed.
Young Plays Star Game
"Bud" Young, playing running guard
for the lightweights, was the star of
the contest. He was the main cog in
both the defensive and offensive game
played by his team, accounting for
thirteen of the points. Shaw, playing
center in the first period, found the
basket regularly, and both Hobro and
Meyers showed up well in their for
ward positions.
Regli, of the visitors, seemed to
know his game, and persistently broke
up the lightweight offensive. He was
the only member on the Mountain
View squad who located the hoop at
regular intervals, chalking up a total
of eight digits for his team.

Exceptional Team-Work Helps

From the opening whistle the Stan
ford team took the Mountain View
squad off their feet, and with excep
tional teamwork. Meyers-to-Shaw-to-
Young, they elided the half 22 to 10
in their favor.
In the second period, Mountain View
tightened up their defense, but were
comparatively weak on the offense,
scoring only five points during the
half. Substitutions, Scholtzberg for
Shaw, and Blosser for Thompson,
strengthened the Cardinal defensive,
but weakened their offensive game.
The lightweights missed many easy
shots under their goal, although their
teamwork seemed more efficient than
in the first stanza. This failure to lo
cate the hoop did not materially affect
the result, however, for the 18(Kpound
ers added fifteen points to the score
before the final whistle blew.
Game Free From Fouls
The game was surprisingly free from
fouls, both teams playing open basket
ball in preference to the smashing
variety.
The lightweights will play their next
game against San Mateo High School,
preliminary to the Stanford-Nevada
game in the Pavilion Friday night. The
game will start promptly at 7 p. m.

Stanford — Mountain View—
Hobro (S) F Guthrie (4)

cate the hoop did not materially affect
the result, however, for the 18(Kpound
ers added fifteen points to the score
before the final whistle blew.
Game Free From Fouls
The game was surprisingly free from
fouls, both teams playing open basket
ball in preference to the smashing
variety.
The lightweights will play their next
game against San Mateo High School,
preliminary to the Stanford-Nevada
game in the Pavilion Friday night. The
game will start promptly at 7 p. m.
The line-up:
Stanford — Mountain View—
Hobro (S) F Guthrie (4)
Meyers (6) F Regli (8)
Shaw (8) C Lund
Thompson G Harding
Young (13) G Cameron (2)
Substitutions: Stanford, Blosser,
Scholtzberg (2), Hollingsworth; Moun
tain View, Campbell, Smith, Rose, Vil
heur. Marsh.
Taking advantage of their oppon
ents' ragged teamwork, the Stanford
130-pound basketball team crushed the
Mountain View High School quintet
by the one-sided score of 37 to 15 in
the Pavilion last night. At no time
during the fracas were the Stanford
men headed.
Young Plays Star Game
"Bud" Young, playing running guard
for the lightweights, was the star of
the contest. He was the main cog in
both the defensive and offensive game
played by his team, accounting for
thirteen of the points. Shaw, playing
center in the first period, found the
basket regularly, and both Hobro and
Meyers showed up well in their for
ward positions.
Regli, of the visitors, seemed to
know his game, and persistently broke
up the lightweight offensive. He was
the only member on the Mountain
View squad who located the hoop at
regular intervals, chalking up a total
of eight digits for his team.

Exceptional Team-Work Helps

From the opening whistle the Stan
ford team took the Mountain View
squad off their feet, and with excep
tional teamwork. Meyers-to-Shaw-to-
Young, they elided the half 22 to 10
in their favor.
In the second period, Mountain View
tightened up their defense, but were
comparatively weak on the offense,
scoring only five points during the
half. Substitutions, Scholtzberg for
Shaw, and Blosser for Thompson,
strengthened the Cardinal defensive,
but weakened their offensive game.
The lightweights missed many easy
shots under their goal, although their
teamwork seemed more efficient than
in the first stanza. This failure to lo
cate the hoop did not materially affect
the result, however, for the 18(Kpound
ers added fifteen points to the score
before the final whistle blew.
