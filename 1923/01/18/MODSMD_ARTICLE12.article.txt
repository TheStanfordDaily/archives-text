# VARSITY, FRESHMAN NINES MEET TODAY IN INITIAL CLASH
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity and freshman
baseball nines are scheduled to meet
in the first diamond clash of the year
this afternoon at 4:15 on the varsity
field if weather conditions permit. Last
night the field was watersoaked and
the players spent most of their time
skidding around the lot.
Outlook Appears Bright
Since the start of the winter quar
ter, both squads have been throwing
and batting the ball around and gen
erally getting a good limbering up. As
yet, Coach Harry Wolters has not any
real idea of the strength of this year's
varsity, but the outlook is bright. With
five old veterans back, together with
good material from last year's Babe
squad and some promising "finds," the
Cardinal chances look good.
Freshmen in Field Strong
The freshmen have had more oppor
tunity to get in some real work the
past few weeks than has the varsity,
having played several innings every
afternoon when the diamond has been
dry enough. Wolters is enthusiastic
over the infield combination and ven
tures to say that the freshman nine
this year will be one of the strongest
that has ever fought for the Cardinal,
at least in the fielding department.
Whether the '26 batsmen can find the
ball or not is still doubtful.
Wolters is undecided as to the bat
teries he will start, although he be
lieves Solomon and Huneke will take
the field for the varsity. Oviatt and
Kohler are the likely candidates for
the freshmen.
