# ONE-SIDED COURT CONTESTS FEATURE INTRAMURAL CLASH
## Sigma Chi, Los Arcos, Theta Chi and D.K.E. Victors in First Basketball Games 
### 
In the four intramural basketball
games played yesterday in Encina
Gymnasium, Sigma Chi defeated En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 19-4; Los Arcos
won from Sequoia Hall, second floor,
19-17; Theta Chi beat El Toro 20-9, and
Delta Kappa Epsilon took their contest
from Phi Gamma Delta 14-1.
Sigma Chi Has One-Sided Win
The Sigma Chi-Encina contest which
opened the play for the afternoon was
one-sided from the start, the Sigma
Chi players displaying a brand of bas
ketball which kept the ball in their
possession until they could work it
down to the basket and make a shot.
For the first few minutes some dif
ficulty was experienced in working the
ball within striking distance of the
goal, but Swan and Mahan both tired
before the half ended and the Sigma
Chi forwards had little opposition from
then on. Swan played a hard game,
but was unable to guard his basket
and at the same time help out the
passing game of the Encina forwards.
Besides weak guarding, the Encina
team had practically no aerial attack
and the ball went wild or into the
hands of the Sigma Chi players time
after time.
Shaw Shows Up Well
Shaw played a good game at forward
for Sigma Chi, scoring three field goals
and one free throw. Cleaveland, his
mate at forward, paired off well with
him and by accurate passes and shots
caged three goals himself. Tremaine
and Parker did the rest of the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Fox blocked the Encina forwards
from his goal and prevented any close
shots at the basket. In the first period,
Yates slipped one in for Encina and
in the last half, Wells succeeded in
scoring on a long shot. None of the
Encina men could yet loose from their
opponents, and only once or twice se
lured openinps for shots at the basket.
Spectacular Shots Are Feature
During the first half of the Los
Arcos-Sequoia Hall game, the former
looked like a sure winner, piling up a
good lead in the first few minutes. Sev
eral of the shots were spectacular. The
first score was made by Smith, who
caged a long shot from the side of the
floor. A minute later Hamilton scored
on a shot from under the basket. A
third basket was registered by Hender
son, who took advantage of the jump
Los Arcos had on Sequoia and dribbled
his way from mid-floor through an
opening right up to the basket.
Before the half was over, Blacker
also registered twice and Hamilton
scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los
Arcos players tired and showed lack
of practice and condition. The result
was that Brown ran up four basnets
in a row for Sequoia and Cole added
one more to the score, coming within
an ace of tying the count.
But by this time. Smith had caged
another shot, and Blacker and Gomes
another one each.
Smith and Hamilton were the out
standing players for Los Arcos, keep
ing up a good passing game when they
were unable to work the ball down to
