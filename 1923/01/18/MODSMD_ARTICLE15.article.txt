# ONE-SIDED COURT CONTESTS FEATURE INTRAMURAL CLASH
## Sigma Chi, Los Arcos, Theta Chi and D.K.E. Victors in First Basketball Games 
### 
In the four intramural basketball
games played yesterday in Encina
Gymnasium, Sigma Chi defeated En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 19-4; Los Arcos
won from Sequoia Hall, second floor,
19-17; Theta Chi beat El Toro 20-9, and
Delta Kappa Epsilon took their contest
from Phi Gamma Delta 14-1.
Sigma Chi Has One-Sided Win
The Sigma Chi-Encina contest which
opened the play for the afternoon was
one-sided from the start, the Sigma
Chi players displaying a brand of bas
ketball which kept the ball in their
possession until they could work it
down to the basket and make a shot.
For the first few minutes some dif
ficulty was experienced in working the
ball within striking distance of the
goal, but Swan and Mahan both tired
before the half ended and the Sigma
Chi forwards had little opposition from
then on. Swan played a hard game,
but was unable to guard his basket
and at the same time help out the
passing game of the Encina forwards.
Besides weak guarding, the Encina
team had practically no aerial attack
and the ball went wild or into the
hands of the Sigma Chi players time
after time.
Shaw Shows Up Well
Shaw played a good game at forward
for Sigma Chi, scoring three field goals
and one free throw. Cleaveland, his
mate at forward, paired off well with
him and by accurate passes and shots
caged three goals himself. Tremaine
and Parker did the rest of the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Fox blocked the Encina forwards
from his goal and prevented any close
shots at the basket. In the first period,
Yates slipped one in for Encina and
in the last half, Wells succeeded in
scoring on a long shot. None of the
Encina men could yet loose from their
opponents, and only once or twice se
lured openinps for shots at the basket.
Spectacular Shots Are Feature
During the first half of the Los
Arcos-Sequoia Hall game, the former
looked like a sure winner, piling up a
good lead in the first few minutes. Sev
eral of the shots were spectacular. The
first score was made by Smith, who
caged a long shot from the side of the
floor. A minute later Hamilton scored
on a shot from under the basket. A
third basket was registered by Hender
son, who took advantage of the jump
Los Arcos had on Sequoia and dribbled
his way from mid-floor through an
opening right up to the basket.
Before the half was over, Blacker
also registered twice and Hamilton
scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los
Arcos players tired and showed lack
of practice and condition. The result
was that Brown ran up four basnets
in a row for Sequoia and Cole added
one more to the score, coming within
an ace of tying the count.
But by this time. Smith had caged
another shot, and Blacker and Gomes
another one each.
Smith and Hamilton were the out
standing players for Los Arcos, keep
ing up a good passing game when they
were unable to work the ball down to
the basket. Brown was high point
scorer for Sequoia, making twelve of
their seventeen points. Brazil failed
to score a single field goal but it was
due to his passes to Brown that Brown
was able to run the score as high as
he did.
Theta Chi Easy Victors
Theta Chi met little difficulty in
defeating El Toro 20-9. The game was
rough and hard fought by both teams,
but when the Theta Chi forward line
got the ball it was able to work it
down under the El Toro basket before
shooting. Hollingsworth and Blosser,
both members of the 130-lb. team, took
a large part in the accurate passing
of their five. Smith at center made
most of the baskets, scoring six goals,
three in each half, but he got the ball
on passes from Blosser and Hollings
worth, who had dribbled into position.
In spite of the superiority of the
Theta Chi passing game, the ball was
rushed back and forth on the floor and
the score was less even than it would
have been if El Toro had had one man
who could shoot baskets. Clifford did
the best work, making three goals
during the game, and Boren caged a
fancy shot from the side of the floor
soon after he entered the contest iii
the first half.
Long Shots Go Wild
In the second half Clifford got reck
less in his desire to score for El Toro
and catch up with the Theta Chi team,
and he made several attempts at field
goals from the middle of the floor, all
of them going wild.
Neither team took advantage of get
ting the ball off the backboard and
following a long shot up with another
from under the basket. Several
chances to score thus escaped both
teams, each set of forwards allowing
their opposing guards to gather in the
ball from the backboard and heave it
to the opposite end of the court.
Steffan and Dana Fuller did the
scoring for Delta Kappa Epsilon In
their game with Phi Gamma Delta
which the former won 14-1. At the
start the teams seemed evenly
matched but the lack of practice of the
Phi Gamma Delta team was soon evi
dent. The Delta Kappa Epsilon for
wards raced back and forth on the
floor, being loose most of the game.
Only when they entered the foul zone
did they meet any resistance. Hunt,
Dills, and Chase took turns guarding
the Phi Gamma Delta goal but Steffan
and Fuller got by them every time and
by some clever and fast passing scored
easily.
Forwards Are Sluggish
Neither Bonner nor Colvin showed
any speed with the ball and Muir at
forward failed to get loose and run
down the floor. The whole team was
sluggish and covered ground slowly
when compared to the fast Delta Kap
pa Epsilon team. The Delta Kappa
Epsilon players blocked all attempts
of Phi Gamma Delta at the basket.
Only one point was scored against
them, a single marker on a free throw
by Chase, thus preventing a white
wash.
The games on tonight's schedule
are: Breakers and Alpha Delta Phi,
5 p. m.; Encina Hall, first floor, and
Japanese Club, 5:40 p. m.; Encina
Hall, second floor, and Beta Theta Pi,
7:15 p. m.; Encina Hall, third floor,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 8 p. m.
Friday's schedule as formerly an
nounced has been changed. A mistake
was made in the arrangement so that
the same teams were set to meet
twice. As corrected, the schedule is:
El Campo and Encina floor, fourth
floor, 5 p. m.; El Cuadro and Theta Xi,
5:40 p. m. This correction will mean
a rearrangement of several later
games. The revised schedule will be
announced later.

Neither team took advantage of get
ting the ball off the backboard and
following a long shot up with another
from under the basket. Several
chances to score thus escaped both
teams, each set of forwards allowing
their opposing guards to gather in the
ball from the backboard and heave it
to the opposite end of the court.
Steffan and Dana Fuller did the
scoring for Delta Kappa Epsilon In
their game with Phi Gamma Delta
which the former won 14-1. At the
start the teams seemed evenly
matched but the lack of practice of the
Phi Gamma Delta team was soon evi
dent. The Delta Kappa Epsilon for
wards raced back and forth on the
floor, being loose most of the game.
Only when they entered the foul zone
did they meet any resistance. Hunt,
Dills, and Chase took turns guarding
the Phi Gamma Delta goal but Steffan
and Fuller got by them every time and
by some clever and fast passing scored
easily.
Forwards Are Sluggish
Neither Bonner nor Colvin showed
any speed with the ball and Muir at
forward failed to get loose and run
down the floor. The whole team was
sluggish and covered ground slowly
when compared to the fast Delta Kap
pa Epsilon team. The Delta Kappa
Epsilon players blocked all attempts
of Phi Gamma Delta at the basket.
Only one point was scored against
them, a single marker on a free throw
by Chase, thus preventing a white
wash.
The games on tonight's schedule
are: Breakers and Alpha Delta Phi,
5 p. m.; Encina Hall, first floor, and
Japanese Club, 5:40 p. m.; Encina
Hall, second floor, and Beta Theta Pi,
7:15 p. m.; Encina Hall, third floor,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 8 p. m.
Friday's schedule as formerly an
nounced has been changed. A mistake
was made in the arrangement so that
the same teams were set to meet
twice. As corrected, the schedule is:
El Campo and Encina floor, fourth
floor, 5 p. m.; El Cuadro and Theta Xi,
5:40 p. m. This correction will mean
a rearrangement of several later
games. The revised schedule will be
announced later.
In the four intramural basketball
games played yesterday in Encina
Gymnasium, Sigma Chi defeated En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 19-4; Los Arcos
won from Sequoia Hall, second floor,
19-17; Theta Chi beat El Toro 20-9, and
Delta Kappa Epsilon took their contest
from Phi Gamma Delta 14-1.
Sigma Chi Has One-Sided Win
The Sigma Chi-Encina contest which
opened the play for the afternoon was
one-sided from the start, the Sigma
Chi players displaying a brand of bas
ketball which kept the ball in their
possession until they could work it
down to the basket and make a shot.
For the first few minutes some dif
ficulty was experienced in working the
ball within striking distance of the
goal, but Swan and Mahan both tired
before the half ended and the Sigma
Chi forwards had little opposition from
then on. Swan played a hard game,
but was unable to guard his basket
and at the same time help out the
passing game of the Encina forwards.
Besides weak guarding, the Encina
team had practically no aerial attack
and the ball went wild or into the
hands of the Sigma Chi players time
after time.
Shaw Shows Up Well
Shaw played a good game at forward
for Sigma Chi, scoring three field goals
and one free throw. Cleaveland, his
mate at forward, paired off well with
him and by accurate passes and shots
caged three goals himself. Tremaine
and Parker did the rest of the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Fox blocked the Encina forwards
from his goal and prevented any close
shots at the basket. In the first period,
Yates slipped one in for Encina and
in the last half, Wells succeeded in
scoring on a long shot. None of the
Encina men could yet loose from their
opponents, and only once or twice se
lured openinps for shots at the basket.
Spectacular Shots Are Feature
During the first half of the Los
Arcos-Sequoia Hall game, the former
looked like a sure winner, piling up a
good lead in the first few minutes. Sev
eral of the shots were spectacular. The
first score was made by Smith, who
caged a long shot from the side of the
floor. A minute later Hamilton scored
on a shot from under the basket. A
third basket was registered by Hender
son, who took advantage of the jump
Los Arcos had on Sequoia and dribbled
his way from mid-floor through an
opening right up to the basket.
Before the half was over, Blacker
also registered twice and Hamilton
scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los
Arcos players tired and showed lack
of practice and condition. The result
was that Brown ran up four basnets
in a row for Sequoia and Cole added
one more to the score, coming within
an ace of tying the count.
But by this time. Smith had caged
another shot, and Blacker and Gomes
another one each.
Smith and Hamilton were the out
standing players for Los Arcos, keep
ing up a good passing game when they
were unable to work the ball down to
the basket. Brown was high point
scorer for Sequoia, making twelve of
their seventeen points. Brazil failed
to score a single field goal but it was
due to his passes to Brown that Brown
was able to run the score as high as
he did.
Theta Chi Easy Victors
Theta Chi met little difficulty in
defeating El Toro 20-9. The game was
rough and hard fought by both teams,
but when the Theta Chi forward line
got the ball it was able to work it
down under the El Toro basket before
shooting. Hollingsworth and Blosser,
both members of the 130-lb. team, took
a large part in the accurate passing
of their five. Smith at center made
most of the baskets, scoring six goals,
three in each half, but he got the ball
on passes from Blosser and Hollings
worth, who had dribbled into position.
In spite of the superiority of the
Theta Chi passing game, the ball was
rushed back and forth on the floor and
the score was less even than it would
have been if El Toro had had one man
who could shoot baskets. Clifford did
the best work, making three goals
during the game, and Boren caged a
fancy shot from the side of the floor
soon after he entered the contest iii
the first half.
Long Shots Go Wild
In the second half Clifford got reck
less in his desire to score for El Toro
and catch up with the Theta Chi team,
and he made several attempts at field
goals from the middle of the floor, all
of them going wild.
Neither team took advantage of get
ting the ball off the backboard and

scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los
Arcos players tired and showed lack
of practice and condition. The result
was that Brown ran up four basnets
in a row for Sequoia and Cole added
one more to the score, coming within
an ace of tying the count.
But by this time. Smith had caged
another shot, and Blacker and Gomes
another one each.
Smith and Hamilton were the out
standing players for Los Arcos, keep
ing up a good passing game when they
were unable to work the ball down to
the basket. Brown was high point
scorer for Sequoia, making twelve of
their seventeen points. Brazil failed
to score a single field goal but it was
due to his passes to Brown that Brown
was able to run the score as high as
he did.
Theta Chi Easy Victors
Theta Chi met little difficulty in
defeating El Toro 20-9. The game was
rough and hard fought by both teams,
but when the Theta Chi forward line
got the ball it was able to work it
down under the El Toro basket before
shooting. Hollingsworth and Blosser,
both members of the 130-lb. team, took
a large part in the accurate passing
of their five. Smith at center made
most of the baskets, scoring six goals,
three in each half, but he got the ball
on passes from Blosser and Hollings
worth, who had dribbled into position.
In spite of the superiority of the
Theta Chi passing game, the ball was
rushed back and forth on the floor and
the score was less even than it would
have been if El Toro had had one man
who could shoot baskets. Clifford did
the best work, making three goals
during the game, and Boren caged a
fancy shot from the side of the floor
soon after he entered the contest iii
the first half.
Long Shots Go Wild
In the second half Clifford got reck
less in his desire to score for El Toro
and catch up with the Theta Chi team,
and he made several attempts at field
goals from the middle of the floor, all
of them going wild.
Neither team took advantage of get
ting the ball off the backboard and
following a long shot up with another
from under the basket. Several
chances to score thus escaped both
teams, each set of forwards allowing
their opposing guards to gather in the
ball from the backboard and heave it
to the opposite end of the court.
Steffan and Dana Fuller did the
scoring for Delta Kappa Epsilon In
their game with Phi Gamma Delta
which the former won 14-1. At the
start the teams seemed evenly
matched but the lack of practice of the
Phi Gamma Delta team was soon evi
dent. The Delta Kappa Epsilon for
wards raced back and forth on the
floor, being loose most of the game.
Only when they entered the foul zone
did they meet any resistance. Hunt,
Dills, and Chase took turns guarding
the Phi Gamma Delta goal but Steffan
and Fuller got by them every time and
by some clever and fast passing scored
easily.
Forwards Are Sluggish
Neither Bonner nor Colvin showed
any speed with the ball and Muir at
forward failed to get loose and run
down the floor. The whole team was
sluggish and covered ground slowly
when compared to the fast Delta Kap
pa Epsilon team. The Delta Kappa
Epsilon players blocked all attempts
of Phi Gamma Delta at the basket.
Only one point was scored against
them, a single marker on a free throw
by Chase, thus preventing a white
wash.
The games on tonight's schedule
are: Breakers and Alpha Delta Phi,
5 p. m.; Encina Hall, first floor, and
Japanese Club, 5:40 p. m.; Encina
Hall, second floor, and Beta Theta Pi,
7:15 p. m.; Encina Hall, third floor,
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 8 p. m.
Friday's schedule as formerly an
nounced has been changed. A mistake
was made in the arrangement so that
the same teams were set to meet
twice. As corrected, the schedule is:
El Campo and Encina floor, fourth
floor, 5 p. m.; El Cuadro and Theta Xi,
5:40 p. m. This correction will mean
a rearrangement of several later
games. The revised schedule will be
announced later.
In the four intramural basketball
games played yesterday in Encina
Gymnasium, Sigma Chi defeated En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 19-4; Los Arcos
won from Sequoia Hall, second floor,
19-17; Theta Chi beat El Toro 20-9, and
Delta Kappa Epsilon took their contest
from Phi Gamma Delta 14-1.
Sigma Chi Has One-Sided Win
The Sigma Chi-Encina contest which
opened the play for the afternoon was
one-sided from the start, the Sigma
Chi players displaying a brand of bas
ketball which kept the ball in their
possession until they could work it
down to the basket and make a shot.
For the first few minutes some dif
ficulty was experienced in working the
ball within striking distance of the
goal, but Swan and Mahan both tired
before the half ended and the Sigma
Chi forwards had little opposition from
then on. Swan played a hard game,
but was unable to guard his basket
and at the same time help out the
passing game of the Encina forwards.
Besides weak guarding, the Encina
team had practically no aerial attack
and the ball went wild or into the
hands of the Sigma Chi players time
after time.
Shaw Shows Up Well
Shaw played a good game at forward
for Sigma Chi, scoring three field goals
and one free throw. Cleaveland, his
mate at forward, paired off well with
him and by accurate passes and shots
caged three goals himself. Tremaine
and Parker did the rest of the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Fox blocked the Encina forwards
from his goal and prevented any close
shots at the basket. In the first period,
Yates slipped one in for Encina and
in the last half, Wells succeeded in
scoring on a long shot. None of the
Encina men could yet loose from their
opponents, and only once or twice se
lured openinps for shots at the basket.
Spectacular Shots Are Feature
During the first half of the Los
Arcos-Sequoia Hall game, the former
looked like a sure winner, piling up a
good lead in the first few minutes. Sev
eral of the shots were spectacular. The
first score was made by Smith, who
caged a long shot from the side of the
floor. A minute later Hamilton scored
on a shot from under the basket. A
third basket was registered by Hender
son, who took advantage of the jump
Los Arcos had on Sequoia and dribbled
his way from mid-floor through an
opening right up to the basket.
Before the half was over, Blacker
also registered twice and Hamilton
scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los

opened the play for the afternoon was
one-sided from the start, the Sigma
Chi players displaying a brand of bas
ketball which kept the ball in their
possession until they could work it
down to the basket and make a shot.
For the first few minutes some dif
ficulty was experienced in working the
ball within striking distance of the
goal, but Swan and Mahan both tired
before the half ended and the Sigma
Chi forwards had little opposition from
then on. Swan played a hard game,
but was unable to guard his basket
and at the same time help out the
passing game of the Encina forwards.
Besides weak guarding, the Encina
team had practically no aerial attack
and the ball went wild or into the
hands of the Sigma Chi players time
after time.
Shaw Shows Up Well
Shaw played a good game at forward
for Sigma Chi, scoring three field goals
and one free throw. Cleaveland, his
mate at forward, paired off well with
him and by accurate passes and shots
caged three goals himself. Tremaine
and Parker did the rest of the scoring
for Sigma Chi.
Fox blocked the Encina forwards
from his goal and prevented any close
shots at the basket. In the first period,
Yates slipped one in for Encina and
in the last half, Wells succeeded in
scoring on a long shot. None of the
Encina men could yet loose from their
opponents, and only once or twice se
lured openinps for shots at the basket.
Spectacular Shots Are Feature
During the first half of the Los
Arcos-Sequoia Hall game, the former
looked like a sure winner, piling up a
good lead in the first few minutes. Sev
eral of the shots were spectacular. The
first score was made by Smith, who
caged a long shot from the side of the
floor. A minute later Hamilton scored
on a shot from under the basket. A
third basket was registered by Hender
son, who took advantage of the jump
Los Arcos had on Sequoia and dribbled
his way from mid-floor through an
opening right up to the basket.
Before the half was over, Blacker
also registered twice and Hamilton
scored again, living Los Arcos the
lead 12-7. In the second half, the Los
Arcos players tired and showed lack
of practice and condition. The result
was that Brown ran up four basnets
in a row for Sequoia and Cole added
one more to the score, coming within
an ace of tying the count.
But by this time. Smith had caged
another shot, and Blacker and Gomes
another one each.
Smith and Hamilton were the out
standing players for Los Arcos, keep
ing up a good passing game when they
were unable to work the ball down to
the basket. Brown was high point
scorer for Sequoia, making twelve of
their seventeen points. Brazil failed
to score a single field goal but it was
due to his passes to Brown that Brown
was able to run the score as high as
he did.
Theta Chi Easy Victors
Theta Chi met little difficulty in
defeating El Toro 20-9. The game was
rough and hard fought by both teams,
but when the Theta Chi forward line
got the ball it was able to work it
down under the El Toro basket before
shooting. Hollingsworth and Blosser,
both members of the 130-lb. team, took
a large part in the accurate passing
of their five. Smith at center made
most of the baskets, scoring six goals,
three in each half, but he got the ball
on passes from Blosser and Hollings
worth, who had dribbled into position.
In spite of the superiority of the
Theta Chi passing game, the ball was
rushed back and forth on the floor and
the score was less even than it would
have been if El Toro had had one man
who could shoot baskets. Clifford did
the best work, making three goals
during the game, and Boren caged a
fancy shot from the side of the floor
soon after he entered the contest iii
the first half.
Long Shots Go Wild
In the second half Clifford got reck
less in his desire to score for El Toro
and catch up with the Theta Chi team,
and he made several attempts at field
goals from the middle of the floor, all
of them going wild.
Neither team took advantage of get
ting the ball off the backboard and
following a long shot up with another
from under the basket. Several
chances to score thus escaped both
teams, each set of forwards allowing
their opposing guards to gather in the
ball from the backboard and heave it
to the opposite end of the court.
Steffan and Dana Fuller did the
scoring for Delta Kappa Epsilon In
their game with Phi Gamma Delta
which the former won 14-1. At the
start the teams seemed evenly
matched but the lack of practice of the
Phi Gamma Delta team was soon evi
dent. The Delta Kappa Epsilon for
wards raced back and forth on the
floor, being loose most of the game.
Only when they entered the foul zone
did they meet any resistance. Hunt,
Dills, and Chase took turns guarding
the Phi Gamma Delta goal but Steffan
and Fuller got by them every time and
by some clever and fast passing scored
easily.
Forwards Are Sluggish
Neither Bonner nor Colvin showed
any speed with the ball and Muir at
forward failed to get loose and run
down the floor. The whole team was
sluggish and covered ground slowly
when compared to the fast Delta Kap
pa Epsilon team. The Delta Kappa
Epsilon players blocked all attempts
of Phi Gamma Delta at the basket.
Only one point was scored against
them, a single marker on a free throw
by Chase, thus preventing a white
wash.
The games on tonight's schedule
are: Breakers and Alpha Delta Phi,
5 p. m.; Encina Hall, first floor, and
Japanese Club, 5:40 p. m.; Encina
Hall, second floor, and Beta Theta Pi,
7:15 p. m.; Encina Hall, third floor,

Friday's schedule as formerly an
nounced has been changed. A mistake
was made in the arrangement so that
the same teams were set to meet
twice. As corrected, the schedule is:
El Campo and Encina floor, fourth
floor, 5 p. m.; El Cuadro and Theta Xi,
5:40 p. m. This correction will mean
a rearrangement of several later
games. The revised schedule will be
announced later.
