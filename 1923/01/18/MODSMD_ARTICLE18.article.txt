# STANFORD TO PLAY WEEK-END SERIES WITH NEVADA HERE
## 
### 
Nevada will meet the Stanord basket
ball varsity Friday and Saturday on the
Pavilion court with hopes of blotting
out two defeats handed out by the Cali
fornia squad at Berkeley earlier in the
week. Coach Courtwright of the Sage
brushers has a light, fast aggregation,
and with two days' rest should have his
squad in the best of shape to meet the
Cardinals tomorrow night.
Although the Bruin five had little
trouble in running up a good score in the
games against the Nevada team last Mon
day and Tuesday, the Sagebrushers are
said to have a strong defense with a par
tially developed offense. Up until the
St. Ignatius game, although playing an
air-tight defense, the Cardinal team has
shown nothing startling in the way of
offense. If, however, Kerr's players con-j
tinue to exhibit the brand of basketball
displayed in the second half of Tues
day's game, it will be hard for any de
fense to hold them in check.
In the past, Nevada was noted for ex
ceptionally strong basketball teams. This
year. "Rabbit" Bradshaw was lost by
the graduation route, while Reed dropped
from school. Scranton, a football player,
is one of the few veterans that Court
wright has had with which to build up a
team this year, the Sagebrush squad hav
ing plenty of guards, but few forwards
of ability.
In the California games, "Spud" Har
rison at standing guard bore the brunt
of the defense for the Nevada quintet
and easily stood out as the star of the
team. Scranton plays the running guard
position, while Coach Courtwright has
his choice between Randale and Ander
son for the center job. Clay and Fred
ericks are slated to start at forward
against Stanford with Goodale as sub
stitute.
From the way that the Stanford offense
went through the St. Ignatius five in the
second half Tuesday, it would appear
that the Cardinal quintet had "arrived"
to stay. Better condition than shown
in any previous game also aided them
in keeping up a faster pace. Anderson
and Janssen, at the present, are the only
ones who seem to be having trouble in
getting into condition. Janssen, in addi
tion to having a weak ankle to bother
him, has a bad cold and it is hardly prob
able that Kerr will use him at all to
morrow night.
The Nevada-Stanford game will start
promptly at 8 o'clock, being preceded by
a bout between the 130-pound team and
a local bay weight quintet.
