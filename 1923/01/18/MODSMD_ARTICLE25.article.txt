# CENTRALIZED AUTHORITY

For those members of the student body who
are interested in the athletic situation at Stanford
there is an article of considerable interest, entitled
"One Executive in Athletics," in the last issue
of the Stanford Pictorial. The editor of the Pic
torial publishes an interview with Dr. Wilbur, in
which new light is thrown upon the Board of
Athletic Control and its duties. The most sig
nificant fact given in this interesting page is that
hereafter the burden of executive duty will lie
in the hands of the Director of Athletics. Dr. W.
H. Barrow is "now to athletics what Dr. Wilbur
is to the University."
Although this announcement comes as a sur
prise to many people, it is nothing new. As Dr.
Wilbur declared in his interview, the Board of
Control was only intended in the first place to be
a policy-making, advisory body. At the time of
its institution, the Board was supposed to func
tion only in the capacities which have recently
been outlined for it. Unusual circumstances, how
ever, have prevented the original plan from work
ing. It was not until Dr. Barrow assumed the
reins that the president felt that the first plans
could be effectively carried out, and as a conse
quence the destiny of Stanford athletics will be
somewhat influenced by the part that the new
executive plays.
In past years there has centered around the
Board of Control all the surviving interest of the
days when athletics pretty much ran themselves
at Stanford. The Board has gone in for athletics
in a big way, has hired competent staffs, built a
stadium, and proposes to build a dormitory. At
this interesting point it ceases to function as an
executive body and the work of nine members is
now turned over to a central authority.
i Henceforth, with most of the responsibility on
the shoulders of one man. policies should be well
defined and clear-cut. There can be no "buck
passing," no clash between factions on vital
issues, no quarrels on principles. It is part of the
new director's task to clear up matters which have
been hazy, to give people interested in Stanford
athletics some idea of the principles on which
these activities are based, and at the same time
to bring students, alumni, and faculty together
on a common ground of co-opdration.
It cannot be doubted but that such a task is the
logical job for one man and not for nine. But it
will not be possible for that one man to get to
first base without sympathy and co-operation. He
will not have had his chance to put Stanford ath
letics solidly on its feet until he has been given a
reasonable chance. Under existing circumstances,
Dr. Barrow cannot make a single move without
stepping on somebody's toes. If the owners of
those toes would consult Dr. Barrow perhaps a
large portion of athletic wrinkles could be ironed
out before the vear is over.

It cannot be doubted but that such a task is the
logical job for one man and not for nine. But it
will not be possible for that one man to get to
first base without sympathy and co-operation. He
will not have had his chance to put Stanford ath
letics solidly on its feet until he has been given a
reasonable chance. Under existing circumstances,
Dr. Barrow cannot make a single move without
stepping on somebody's toes. If the owners of
those toes would consult Dr. Barrow perhaps a
large portion of athletic wrinkles could be ironed
out before the vear is over.
For those members of the student body who
are interested in the athletic situation at Stanford
there is an article of considerable interest, entitled
"One Executive in Athletics," in the last issue
of the Stanford Pictorial. The editor of the Pic
torial publishes an interview with Dr. Wilbur, in
which new light is thrown upon the Board of
Athletic Control and its duties. The most sig
nificant fact given in this interesting page is that
hereafter the burden of executive duty will lie
in the hands of the Director of Athletics. Dr. W.
H. Barrow is "now to athletics what Dr. Wilbur
is to the University."
Although this announcement comes as a sur
prise to many people, it is nothing new. As Dr.
Wilbur declared in his interview, the Board of
Control was only intended in the first place to be
a policy-making, advisory body. At the time of
its institution, the Board was supposed to func
tion only in the capacities which have recently
been outlined for it. Unusual circumstances, how
ever, have prevented the original plan from work
ing. It was not until Dr. Barrow assumed the
reins that the president felt that the first plans
could be effectively carried out, and as a conse
quence the destiny of Stanford athletics will be
somewhat influenced by the part that the new
executive plays.
In past years there has centered around the
Board of Control all the surviving interest of the
days when athletics pretty much ran themselves
at Stanford. The Board has gone in for athletics
in a big way, has hired competent staffs, built a
stadium, and proposes to build a dormitory. At
this interesting point it ceases to function as an
executive body and the work of nine members is
now turned over to a central authority.
i Henceforth, with most of the responsibility on
the shoulders of one man. policies should be well
defined and clear-cut. There can be no "buck
passing," no clash between factions on vital
issues, no quarrels on principles. It is part of the
new director's task to clear up matters which have
been hazy, to give people interested in Stanford
athletics some idea of the principles on which
these activities are based, and at the same time
to bring students, alumni, and faculty together
on a common ground of co-opdration.

will not be possible for that one man to get to
