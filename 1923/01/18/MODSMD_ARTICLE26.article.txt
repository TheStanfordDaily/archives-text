# WHERE DO WE STAND?

The following quotation from an editorial ap
pearing in a recent issue of the New York Times
ought to give many undergraduates a royal ban
banquet of thought.
"The point of view of the student body has
changed. Even in the Western state universities
a college course has come to be regarded largely
as affording primarily an* opportunity for an en
joyable and leisurely residence and for social ad
vantages. College authorities are compelled to
resort to strange sumptuary regulations. The old
codes which forbade the keeping of dog or gun in
the student's room are replaced by prohibitions
upon the student's bringing his own automobile
within the classic shades. The lone commence
ment 'prom' has been enlarged into a series of

house parties and hops which the collegiate rulers
have had to restrict and even police. The ocean
of frivolity has gained advantage on the shore
of the curriculum.
"Perhaps a reaction long overdue may shortly
manifest itself. To be most efficacious it ought
to originate among the students themselves, and
no one who knows the pervasive but latent
idealism of our college boys can doubt that, once
the movement started, it would spread rapidly."
Where do we stand? Could not Stanford stu
dents accept this challenge in a typical Stanford
way in an effort to put themselves and sister uni
versities on a plane above deserved criticism?
