"What would you do, Miss Tame, if you were in my

"Point them towards the door and give them a good
start."

Mother: Edna, your collar looks tight.
Daughter: Yes, but Mother, he really isn't!

A MORT!
There is no use in trying to live today,
Life's the bunk!
I think I'll blow my addled brains away,
Or suicide in some sad way.
Pass on, cruel world, where'er you may:
My life's junk.
* * *
I tried to pass on yesterday,
Failed, someway! ,
I almost blew my brains away,
Then thought upon my life's past way.
I'm sure that when I pass away:
There's Hell to pay!

Homer Cayenne, '26, is with us again. His line of

UPON FINDING A NAIL IN ONE'S SHOE ON THE

Ouch! Damned nail, thou art three inches long
And filled with fiendish punishment.
Thou hast the sharpness of a devil's prong
Providing Satan with his daily nourishment.
Ouch! One hour at most, and out you go!
My Contracts class shall weep, but see me not.
I'll spend the hour a-raining blow on blow
Till you are but a dull metallic spot.
