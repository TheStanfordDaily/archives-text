Stanford's varsity baseball team will
meet strong opposition in the first
game of the season, Saturday. The
contest is slated with a team of for
mer college stars managed by "Wab
bles" Stafford, former second
man of the Cardinal nine. Stafford
calls his ball tossers "My Darlings"
so probably this name will stick to
his contingent.
No woman shall in the future be
allowed to leave Thursday morning as
semblies before their close, according
to a ruling passed by the Women's
Conference last night. It was also
recommended that each house send
all of its freshmen and as many others
as possible to the assemblies.
"Ric" Templeton, '15, has been rec
commended by the Executive Commit
tee to fill the position of track coach
and assistant football coach at Stan
ford. The Advisory Board has con
firmed the recommendation. Temple
ton made his football numerals and
was twice chosen as varsity substitute.
In 1915 he was a member of the var
sity track squad and was the chief
factor in the scant win over California.
He won the high jump, placed third
in the high hurdles, and after the
Bears figured that they had won the
meet, he jumped into third place in
the broad jump and swung the score
to the Cardinal's favor. He was se
lected to captain the 1916 Stanford
tracksters.
No more blue books or examination
blanks can be bought at the Book
store, it was announced today. The
whole supply has been taken over by
the University and will be passed out
for examinations only.
Unless more women join the Wo
men's Clubhouse, it will be closed.
Only seventy-three members have
joined this semester, and the club
must count on twice that number to
merely meet its current running ex
penses. Membership has greatly de
creased during the past year, there
having been 206 members last spring.
