## UNIVERSITY OF OREGON TO ADOPT SEMESTER SYSTEM 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGONâ€”By a
vote of 29 to 25, the faculty of the
University of Oregon has sanctioned a
change from the three-term to the two
semester plan, to take effect in Sep
tember of this year. The plan was sup
ported by the departments of Educa
tion and English, and its main oppon
ents were professors of the sciences,
who held that their courses were ar
ranged for the three-quarter system,
and that the change could not be
brought about without considerable
labor and expense to the department.
It was also pointed out that the new
system would give athletes an extra
month to make up their studies after
the close of the schedule.
