# TWO TRIANGULAR REGATTAS FOR COLUMBIA OARSMEN
## 
### 
Two triangular races, one with Yale
and Penn and the other the traditional
Childs Cup with Princeton and Penn,
feature the Columbia University row
ing schedule this year. A dual meet
with Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology and the Intercollegiates at
Poughkeepsie complete the Columbia
card for the year. The opening of prac
tice has been deferred until later than
usual, as the coaches maintain that
eligibility is more important than
work on the rowing-machine at this
stage of the game.
