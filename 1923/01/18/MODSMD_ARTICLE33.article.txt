# MICHIGAN GIRL BUMS WAY TO MINNESOTA GAME
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGANâ€”Rid
ing the "blinds" in zero weather, go
ing without sleep for 35 hours, and
at last being apprehended as a com
mon "bum" tells the story of a loyal
Michigan girl student's trip to see her
team battle Minnesota. Hor girlish
wiles, combined with the charms of
a sheepskin slicker, knickers, and a
pair of bearskin mittens, won out over
the native honesty of the conductor,
and she was allowed to finish the trip
in the caboose of the freight train.
Michigan alumni in the Twin Cities
banded together to purchase her a re
turn ticket, and her trip was made per
fect by a decisive victory for Michi
gan. She refused to divulge the name
of her sorority.
