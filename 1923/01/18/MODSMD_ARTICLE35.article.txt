KANSAS UNIVERSITY — "Marry
'em early and treat 'em rough" may
have been the motto of our grand
mothers, but Kansas co-eds have de
cided by vote that 23 is the proper
span of years which should elapse
before a fair young thing launches her
ship upon the sea of life —with nil
anchor to it.
Twenty-six appeared to one girl as
the right age. Her reason was that
she had attained that number of year<.
One sweet damsel murmured that the
marriageable age was any time you
got a chance. A questionnaire con
ducted by a student magazine at the
University of Wisconsin disclosed the
fact that most Wisconsin women plan
to marry after the age of 26.
