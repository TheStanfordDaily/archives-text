# UPTON SINCLAIR IN TEARS OVER MODERN UNIVERSITIES
## 
### 
Upton Sinclair in his new book,
"The Goose Trap," charges the Uni
versity of Minnesota with maintaining
a "spy system" and a black list against
liberal instructors, and moans that
academic freedom is entirely lacking
in the institution. Besides the Univer
sity of Minnesota, the University of
Pensylvania and Wharton School of
Finance are scored.
