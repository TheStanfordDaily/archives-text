# Leaders in Intramural Basket Race Play Good Brand of Ball
## 
### 
With all but six games played in the
second round of the intramural basket
hall tournament, a comparison of the
brand of game the different teams are
playing can be attempted. So far eight
teams have won two games each and lost
none, five teams have won one game each
and lost none, seven teams livtve won
none and lost one, and seven teams have
lost two games each. Eleven teams have
split even, winning one and losing one.
The teams winning two games are:
Alpha Kappa Lambda, Delta Chi, Se
quoia Hall, lirst floor, Delta Tau Delta,
Sigma Nu, Sigma Chi, Theta Chi. Delta
Kappa Epsilon.
El Capitan, Zeta Psi, Theta Chi. Alpha
Sigma Phi, Kappa Alpha, Sequoia Hall,
second floor, Encina Hall, fifth floor,
have all lost two games each. However,
two defeats does not necessarily put any
team out of the running for its league
title, nor do two victories give the league
championship to any team. In League J,
each team will play seven games, and
provided the wins and losses are divided
up four victories can win the league title.
In the remaining five leagues, each team
will play five games and the possessor
of three victories can take the champion
ship if the defeats do not fall to the
same teams consistently.

tories given the preference in case of a j

The leading teams, especially those
which have won two games, show a
marked superiority over their oppon
ents in all aspects of the game. Most
of the present leaders use good team- j
work, have a fast and accurate passing
game, follow up their shots at the bas
ket well, and have a good stiff de
fensive system of guarding. The teams
which have lost are in most cases*
poorly organized and without much
practice or conditioning. Basket shobt
ing is poor and the games are rough
and full of fouls.
It is not too late for teams which
have lost two games to revive their
hopes by a little practice and come
back strong in the remaining games
to be played.

The leading teams, especially those
which have won two games, show a
marked superiority over their oppon
ents in all aspects of the game. Most
of the present leaders use good team- j
work, have a fast and accurate passing
game, follow up their shots at the bas
ket well, and have a good stiff de
fensive system of guarding. The teams
which have lost are in most cases*
poorly organized and without much
practice or conditioning. Basket shobt
ing is poor and the games are rough
and full of fouls.
It is not too late for teams which
have lost two games to revive their
hopes by a little practice and come
back strong in the remaining games
to be played.
With all but six games played in the
second round of the intramural basket
hall tournament, a comparison of the
brand of game the different teams are
playing can be attempted. So far eight
teams have won two games each and lost
none, five teams have won one game each
and lost none, seven teams livtve won
none and lost one, and seven teams have
lost two games each. Eleven teams have
split even, winning one and losing one.
The teams winning two games are:
Alpha Kappa Lambda, Delta Chi, Se
quoia Hall, lirst floor, Delta Tau Delta,
Sigma Nu, Sigma Chi, Theta Chi. Delta
Kappa Epsilon.
El Capitan, Zeta Psi, Theta Chi. Alpha
Sigma Phi, Kappa Alpha, Sequoia Hall,
second floor, Encina Hall, fifth floor,
have all lost two games each. However,
two defeats does not necessarily put any
team out of the running for its league
title, nor do two victories give the league
championship to any team. In League J,
each team will play seven games, and
provided the wins and losses are divided
up four victories can win the league title.
In the remaining five leagues, each team
will play five games and the possessor
of three victories can take the champion
ship if the defeats do not fall to the
same teams consistently.
