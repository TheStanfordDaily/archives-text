# BENTINCK RECEIVES LETTERS PRAISING SELECTION OF "HE"
## 
### 
Several letters have been received this
week by Director Richard Bcntinck from
friends in New York, Carinel, and San
Francisco, commending the choice by
Masuers Society of "Hhe Who Gets
Slapped," for presentation here on Janu
ary 26. Among these are notes received
yesterday from Louis Wolheim, who is
playing as "Yank Smith," "Hairy Ape,"
in the play of that name by Eugene
O'Neill, and Miss Helen Westley, who
played Zinida, one of the leading char
acters of "He Who Gets Slapped" in the
original Theater Guild production.
These letters, while they express some
surprise at the choice of a play so pro
nouncedly different from the ordinary col
lege dramatic offering, are warm in their
praise of the play itself, and the spirit
shown in attempting its presentation is
regarded as a distinct advance in amateur
theatrical standards.
Wolheim's letter expresses the hope
that Bentinck will render a true version
of "He Who Gets Slapped." The letter
follows:
"Your putting on 'He' strikes me as
being great stuff. I hope that you will
stage it in the way it should be staged;
I guess you know of the 'accident' in the
Theater Guild presentation that changed
it from the real drama it was meant to
be into a very sweet little 'Broadway
success.'
"I am glad that you have chosen the
play, >and more than glad that you are
there to give it the production that it de
serves —you can do it, I know.
"My best wishes go with you in making
'He' what it should have been here—
which does not mean, of course, that I
do not wish you the financial success as
well."
Helen Westley, the New York actress,
who played Zinida, the part of the lion
tamer, to be played by Edythe Baylis in
the Masquers' presentation, sent the fol
lowing congratulatory note to Bentinck:
"They tell me that you are putting 'He'
through his paces again. I am delighted
to hear it; I can't tell you how much I
enjoyed the play while I was working
in it. My every wish for a successful
production. Truly yours,
"HELEN WESTLEY."

original Theater Guild production.
These letters, while they express some
surprise at the choice of a play so pro
nouncedly different from the ordinary col
lege dramatic offering, are warm in their
praise of the play itself, and the spirit
shown in attempting its presentation is
regarded as a distinct advance in amateur
theatrical standards.
Wolheim's letter expresses the hope
that Bentinck will render a true version
of "He Who Gets Slapped." The letter
follows:
"Your putting on 'He' strikes me as
being great stuff. I hope that you will
stage it in the way it should be staged;
I guess you know of the 'accident' in the
Theater Guild presentation that changed
it from the real drama it was meant to
be into a very sweet little 'Broadway
success.'
"I am glad that you have chosen the
play, >and more than glad that you are
there to give it the production that it de
serves —you can do it, I know.
"My best wishes go with you in making
'He' what it should have been here—
which does not mean, of course, that I
do not wish you the financial success as
well."
Helen Westley, the New York actress,
who played Zinida, the part of the lion
tamer, to be played by Edythe Baylis in
the Masquers' presentation, sent the fol
lowing congratulatory note to Bentinck:
"They tell me that you are putting 'He'
through his paces again. I am delighted
to hear it; I can't tell you how much I
enjoyed the play while I was working
in it. My every wish for a successful
production. Truly yours,
"HELEN WESTLEY."
