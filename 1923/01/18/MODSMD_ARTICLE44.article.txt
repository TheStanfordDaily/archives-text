# RIFLE CLUB PREPARES FOR SPRING PRACTICE
## 
### 
Organization for spring shooting will
be carried out by Rifle Club when it '
; meets this evening in Room 214. Several I
matches must be shot off soon so imme
diate action is necessary.
Practice will begin as soon as possible
in the indoor small-calibre range located
in the basement of the Administration
'building. Outdoor shooting with the
thirty-calibre rifle will commence as soon
ias weather conditions permit.
The federal government furnishes arms,
ammunition, and equipment to all Rifle
Clubs throughout the United States, and
especially encourages shooting practice
in colleges. Those students who make ex
ceptionally high scores are sent to the
national rifle matches at Camp Perry,
Ohio.
Several members of last year's team
are not back in college this quarter, so
all men interested in shooting are asked
to be present this evening. Men who
have had experience are especially in
vited, for California has sent the club a
rather caustic challenge and they are out
for the Golden Bear's pelt.
