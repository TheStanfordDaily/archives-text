# DEMPSEY NOT TO FIGHT FOR LESS THAN HALF MILLION
## 
### (By United Press 
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â€”Jack Demp
sey will not consider drawing on a
glove for any kind of real contest for
less than $500,000. When he starts
talking terms with Tex Rickard he
probably may ask more.
Dempsey and Kearns are to be here
next week to discuss the subject with
Rickard and they have already made
up their minds on what they are going
to demand.
