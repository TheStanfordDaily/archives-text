# STANFORD SCHOLARSHIP STANDARDIS DISCUSSED IN FEBRUARY REVIEW
## 
### 
Prompted by the disqualification of
eighty-five students last quarter, many
of them athletes, several angles of dis
cussion on Stanford's scholarship require
ments will appear in the February Illus
trated Review on sale the first of Febru
ary.
Professor C. B. Whittier of the Law
department and chairman of the Scholar
ship Committee, writes on "Stanford's
Scholarship Standards." He outlines
what they are and answers certain perti
nent questions which have arisen the
past few weeks in the controversy. Are
these standards unreasonable? he asks
and answers. Should the "human fac
tor" be permitted to interfere when deal
ing with deficient students? Should there
be separate standards for judging ath
letes and other students engaged in extra
curricula activities? How does the
Scholarship Committee regard such ac
tivities ?
Closely associated with this discussion
is Coach Harry Maloney's article on how
Stanford athletic teams have been de
veloped in the past. Does athletic mate
rial come directly from high schools and
prep institutions, or are men developed
into athletes after registration here?
What is the proportion of each? In dis
cussing the number of athletes who have
been made here at Stanford, Maloney
cites the examples of "Dink" and "Ric"
Templeton, and members of the more re
cent rugby teams.
College athletics are useful if they can
withstand the "adversities of prosperity,"
President Wilbur believes. The speech
which he delivered at the Y. M. C. A.
banquet at the St. Francis hotel in San
Francisco last month also appears in the
next Review. President Wilbur believes
that every University man should spend
two hours each day in some form of ath
letics. Abuse of this balance between
participation in athletics and actual aca
demic work has been the issue of con
troversies in the past, he says.
Of a different nature is Garrett El
more's story of the basketball season, in
cluding all games played to the end of
January, which also appears in the
February issue.
