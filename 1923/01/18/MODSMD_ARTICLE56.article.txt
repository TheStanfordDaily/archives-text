# David Snedden Publishes Book on Civic Education
## 
### 
Dr. David Snedden, '96, formerly a
professor in the Education department
at Stanford, has. recently published a
book, "Civic Education," which is on the
new book shelf at the Library this week.
Dr. Snedden is now a professor of edu
cational sociology and vocational educa
tion of the Teachers' College of Colum
bia University. At one time he was com
missioner of education in Massachusetts.
"Civic Education" is a study of socio
logical foundations and courses. It is
designed to aid educators who are seri
ously trying to find and to develop more
effective means of civic education.
Snedden bases his discussions on his
conviction that all aims must be derived
from a study of needs of contemporary
society. With this idea, he supplements
his suggestions and discussions with sam
ple studies of group cases in certain
specified environments. He diagnoses
each case, then tells what the individuals
are likely to do with their lives as he
has found from study and experience,
and, finally, lie proposes courses that
should be most suitable and beneficial
for each group.
America needs more and better edu
cation for citizenship, Snedden says in
his introduction. He does not think the
time has yet arrived to make such edu
cation universally prescriptive in sec
ondary schools, but he urges the greater
development of elective offerings that
will range from service projects to prob
lems of contemporary politics.
Snedden says that it is just as pos
sible to use specific terminology in an
education class as in applied sciences and
he demands thorough systematic study
and research.
