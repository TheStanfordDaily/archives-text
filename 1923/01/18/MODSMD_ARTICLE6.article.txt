HARRISON, Ark., Jan. 18—Mob law
spread in Northern Arkansas today.
Striking railroad employes have been
flogged at Leslie and other points
along the Missouri and North Arkan
sas railroad following outbreaks here
in which E. C. Gregor was lynched
and twenty persons were beaten and
deported.
The entire community was heavily
armed ready to enforce decrees of the
"Citizens' Committee" and "Citizens'
Court," set up by the mob of business
men and farmers who amassed here
Monday to prevent paralysis of train
service on the railroad. Shotguns were
boldly carried through the streets and
revolvers slung from leather holsters
hung at the sides of others.
