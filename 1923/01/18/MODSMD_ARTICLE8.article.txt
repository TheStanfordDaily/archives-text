# EDUCATION COST IS GREAT PROBLEM OF MODERN CHINA
## Rapid Unity Impossible Without Railroads or Schools; Republic Needs Assistance 
### 
"America owes a debt of assistance
to China, whose ancient wealth caused
Columbus to stumble upon the New
World," said Dr. Charles K. Edmunds,
educator and man of science, in sum
ming up fundamental needs in the de
velopment of the new China at a well
attended illustrated lecture in the Lit
j tie Theater yesterday afternoon.
Most Chinse Illiterate
"We do not expect rapid unity in a
nation which 'lacks common trans
portation facilities; how then can we
: expect improvement where the people
lack even an ability to read and
; write? The Chinese have plenty of
backbone, and the student is the
; brainstem. Her republican government
lis only possible through education,
i wherein lies the greatest financial
problem which the Chinese Republic
faces today."
Many Resources Untouched
Dr. Edmunds contrasted the effects
' of old and new learning upon the coun
-1 try, indicating untouched resources
which can be tapped by the applica
tion of modern natural science. He
named railroads, bridges, highways,
1 waterpower, and development of agri-
I culture as the main essentials to
stamping out the devastating famines
j which occur almost annually.
"Poverty of the people is the out
standing impression one receives in
China," declared the lecturer. "Their
small margin of livelihood makes one
| drought fatal, and it is fundamental
to any other development that the
people be taught improved methods of
agriculture. A lack of dairy products,
j too, can be remedied by utilizing
' northern grazing lands. The Christian
I school is now trying to teach this sort
of applied science through experiment
J stations."
Personal Experiences Cited
Much of the lecturer's talk was de-
I voted to a relation of personal ex
-1 periences and observations in little
known regions of the interior. He
! cited instances of remarkable primi
i tive engineering, describing a group
of brine and natural gas wells, some
being 3,000 feet in depth, which are
dug and worked entirely by hand.
Other pieces of work that Dr. Ed
munds explained in detail were the
great 1500-mile wall of China, the fam
ous Grand Canal, 700 miles long, which
antedates the Christian era; and the
! crude but effective dykes along rivers
, and the bay of Hangchow, where a
: phenomenal flood-tide rushes in with
; a volume estimated by Dr. Edmunds at
! one and a half million tons per min
! ute.
Cinnamon River Picturesque
The most picturesque region of his
! explorations is the Cinnamon river,
I according to the speaker. "Limestone
I pinnacles along each side form pal
| lisades that make the Rhine and the
j Hudson fade into insignificance," he
commented. "The traveler, however,
must bring his own ferry-boat, for
; there are no bridges. His 'boat' is a
pig-skin, which he blows full of air,
â–  climbs aboard, and thus floats across
the stream."
