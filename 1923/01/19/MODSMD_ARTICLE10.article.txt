# KERR'S FIVE CONCEDED EDGE IN TWO-GAME COURT SERIES WITH SAGEBRUSH QUINTET
## Games Will Give the First Definite Comparison of Strength of Cardinals and Bears 
### 
Tonight when the referee's whistle announces the start of the Nevada-
Stanford contest on the Pavilion court, the Cardinal quintet will be a decided
favorite over the Sagebrushers. With two overwhelming defeats at the
hands of the Blue and Gold squad at Berkeley on Monday and Tuesday, Coach

Courtwright's proteges, on the other hand, will
enter the game determined to wipe out the past
week's record.
The Nevada series will give the first definite
comparison that can be obtained between the
Cardinals and the California squad. Coach Wight
started his second team against the Sagebrushers
011 the plea that his first five were not in condi
tion to stand a full game yet, and even at that,
the Bruins had but little trouble in taking both
games of the series. O. A. C. also handed out
defeats to the Nevada five earlier in the season.
This game O. A. C. squad lost to the St. Ignatius
team of San Francisco which was beaten by the
Cardinals last Tuesday, 25 to 19.
From the showing in the California series, the
Nevada five can be analyzed as a team with a
strong defensive but a comparatively weak of
fensive. The loss of "Rabbit" Bradsliaw and
Reed was a big factor in breaking up a formid
able scoring combination and this year, Court
wright has had a hard time in building up his
squad.

"Spud" Harrison at standing guard is at present Courtwright's most able
man, while Scranton, playing the other guard, can be counted upon to make
his presence in the game known. In these two men, Rogers and McHose may
find a stumbling block to their offensive. Scranton also.plays football and

has been a source of trouble to Stan
ford teams in the past two years on
the gridiron.
With the making of a strong de
fensive fairly well formed, Coach Andy
Kerr has been devoting most of his
time lately to the offensive side of the
game. The floor work of the Rogers-
MtTlose-Jannsen combination in the
last game was a big improvement over
anything shown previously. Their
passing is still weak but they are be
ginning to be able to locate each other
better than at the start of the season.
Following up his idea of a fifteen-man
team. Kerr has been using Steele, Paul
Pigott, and Austin in the combination
also to a good advantage and all three
players will probably see service in to
night's game.
The games tonight and tomorrow
night will start promptly at 8 o'clock.
I The probable lineup to start tonight
is as follows:
Stanford— Nevada—
Rogers F Clay
McHose F Fredericks
Janssen C Randale
: Anderson G Scranton
Oliva G Harrison


"NIP" McHOSE
