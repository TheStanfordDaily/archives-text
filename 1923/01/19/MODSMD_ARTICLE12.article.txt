# BREAKERS, JAPANESE, BETAS, S.A.E.'s WIN IN CAGE GAMES
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
After yesterday's four games in the
intramural basketball tournament,
Beta Theta Pi tied with Delta Kappa
Epsilon for flrst place in League 1,
Alpha Delta Phi dropped to the .500
mark, the Japanese Club advanced to
the same point, and the Encina Hall
flrst and second floor teams added a
second game to their lost column.
In League 2, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
took the lead by winning their second
game of the tournament from the En
cina Hall third floor team which in
turn dropped to last place in the
league with two defeats chalked
against it.
Pollard and Campbell Missed as
Breakers Beat Alpha Delta Phi
When the # Alpha Delta Phi team
took the floor yesterday afternoon they
were without the services of Pollard
and Campbell, both strong factors in
their first victory over Encina Hall
second floor last week.
Several short, fast passes from Low
enstein and Coverly to Peavy running
in under the basket netted goals and
the Breakers piled up a lead of eight
points over their opponents in the first
half. Lowenstein made two long shots
from mid-floor in the second half when
the Alpha Delta Phi defense stiffened.
Peavy also registered two tallies in
the final period and two more by Har
low, dribbling into position from his
guard position, completed the scoring.
Alpha Delta Phi never seriously
threatened the Breakers' goal but the
latter took no chances and played a

consistently hard game every minute.
Alpha Delta Phi had nearly as good
a brand of teamwork as the Breakers
but they were unable to hang onto the
ball while forcing their way through
the opposing defense. Either their
floor work was too fast or the guarding
too close to permit accurate basket
shooting and a number of apparently
easy shots were missed.
Clever Dribbling by Japanese
Club Defeats Encina Hall Team
The Japanese Club showed clever
dribbling and guarding in winning
from Encina Hall first floor 11-4. The
game started with both sides fighting
for the ball. The larger Encina men
seemed to have the edge in guarding
but the Japanese players were much
faster and much more clever with
their passing and shooting.
The score at the half stood 5-4 for
the Japanese, a foul by Murata early
in the game, giving them the lead.
Williston and Robinson, Encina for
ward line, each placed a shot through
the basket and Murata and Mizota
evened uf> the mount for their team.
Hayashi guarded the larger Encina
men well throughout the game, pre
venting a single score during the last
half. Without him the Japanese might
have hit a snag, since it was hard for
them to keep their hands on the ball
and yet keep it away from the Encina
players.
During the last period, Murata tal
lied twice more from the floor and
Mizota once. Several close shots were
missed when the opposing guards took
the ball away from the little forwards.
Alabaster Cages Five Shots as
Betas Defeat Encina Team 17-15
Beta Theta Pi started scoring with
a rush in their game with Encina Hall
second floor team but was outplayed
in the last half and barely won 17-15.
After Alabaster had raged five nice
shots from the floor early in the game
on passes from Mertz and Proctor, the
Beta Theta Pi second team went in.
No scoring was done by either team
from then until the half with the ex
ception of one basket by Fortyne, En
cina guard.
In the second half with the Beta
Theta Pi second team still on the floor,
Encina opened up and Fortyne scored
three baskets, Pearce one, and Newton
one before Alabaster and his first team
re-entered the game. The score was
within two points of a tie when Proc
tor made the last points for his team
and gave Beta Theta Pi a sufficient
lead to win.
But during the last two minutes of
play with the score 17-5, the Beta
Theta Pi players were worried and ex
cept for careful handling of the ball
might have been scored on. Fortyne
made several attempts to add to his
total and attempted long shots from
mid-floor which went wide by the bar
est margin, one rolling around the rim
just before the final whistle blew.
Geyer and Newton aided Fortyne in
getting the ball into position for a
shot.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon Wins
Easily From Encina
Sigma Alpha Epsilon easily took (
their game from Encina Hall third
floor team IS-9. At half time the score
stood 14-4 for Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and content with that lead their for
wards eased up. Mathews was high
point scorer, making three baskets in
the first half for Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Gibbon and Doughty made two each,
Bugby and Teague one ecah.
For several minutes, Scheidecker
and Jackson, Encina guards, halted
the advance of their opponents, but
before the half Mathews, Gibbon, and
Teague had all solved the blockade
and broke through at will. The guards
were able to hurry the shots sufficient
ly to keep down the score.

Encina Hall fourth floor, 5 p. m.;
