# BREAKERS, JAPANESE, BETAS, S.A.E.'s WIN IN CAGE GAMES
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
After yesterday's four games in the
intramural basketball tournament,
Beta Theta Pi tied with Delta Kappa
Epsilon for flrst place in League 1,
Alpha Delta Phi dropped to the .500
mark, the Japanese Club advanced to
the same point, and the Encina Hall
flrst and second floor teams added a
second game to their lost column.
In League 2, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
took the lead by winning their second
game of the tournament from the En
cina Hall third floor team which in
turn dropped to last place in the
league with two defeats chalked
against it.
Pollard and Campbell Missed as
Breakers Beat Alpha Delta Phi
When the # Alpha Delta Phi team
took the floor yesterday afternoon they
were without the services of Pollard
and Campbell, both strong factors in
their first victory over Encina Hall
second floor last week.
Several short, fast passes from Low
enstein and Coverly to Peavy running
in under the basket netted goals and
the Breakers piled up a lead of eight
points over their opponents in the first
half. Lowenstein made two long shots
from mid-floor in the second half when
the Alpha Delta Phi defense stiffened.
Peavy also registered two tallies in
the final period and two more by Har
low, dribbling into position from his
guard position, completed the scoring.
Alpha Delta Phi never seriously
threatened the Breakers' goal but the
latter took no chances and played a

consistently hard game every minute.
Alpha Delta Phi had nearly as good
a brand of teamwork as the Breakers
but they were unable to hang onto the
ball while forcing their way through
the opposing defense. Either their
floor work was too fast or the guarding
too close to permit accurate basket
shooting and a number of apparently
easy shots were missed.
Clever Dribbling by Japanese
Club Defeats Encina Hall Team
The Japanese Club showed clever
dribbling and guarding in winning
from Encina Hall first floor 11-4. The
game started with both sides fighting
for the ball. The larger Encina men
seemed to have the edge in guarding
but the Japanese players were much
faster and much more clever with
their passing and shooting.
The score at the half stood 5-4 for
the Japanese, a foul by Murata early
in the game, giving them the lead.
Williston and Robinson, Encina for
ward line, each placed a shot through
the basket and Murata and Mizota
evened uf> the mount for their team.
Hayashi guarded the larger Encina
men well throughout the game, pre
venting a single score during the last
half. Without him the Japanese might
have hit a snag, since it was hard for
them to keep their hands on the ball
and yet keep it away from the Encina
players.
During the last period, Murata tal
lied twice more from the floor and
Mizota once. Several close shots were
