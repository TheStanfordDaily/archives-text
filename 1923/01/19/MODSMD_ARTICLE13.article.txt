# Peggy is Not Superstitious But--Are You?
## 
### 
Of all signs and omens, which is the
most powerful?
According to cast members of "He
Who Gets Slapped," coming Masquers
production, that question will be an
swered during the coming week.
Peggy Richardson will answer it.
Wednesday afternoon a black cat —a
cat that would make glad the heart of
any witch—followed Peggy home. Clear
up to the Delta Gamma house and
through the front door it went.
Peggy isn't superstitious, but
So potent a sign of good luck is not
to be ignored.
J hat night at rehearsal—horrors—
someone whistled jn the dressing-room
and as every Thespian knows, that would
jinx the luckiest man in the world.
Peggy isn't superstitious, but—
1 hursday morning on her way to an
eight o'clock Peggy stumbled over a
horseshoe—the only horseshoe outside of
the corporation yards and Museum.
Peggy isn't superstitious, but-
Final ly at rehearsal that night Peggy
walked under a ladder.
So the score is even up—two to two.
Gallons of choc malts, a hat, two bits,
a dollar and a doughnut have been
wagered by cast members on the relative
potency of these good and bad omens.
Will they affect'the success of "He Who
Gets Slapped" on January 26?
But Peggy is not superstitious.
