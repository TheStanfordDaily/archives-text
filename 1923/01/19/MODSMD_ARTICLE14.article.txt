# VARSITY BASEBALL SQUAD DECISIVELY DEFEATS FRESHMEN
## 
### 
In the first brush of the 1923 base
ball season, held on the freshman field
yesterday afternoon, the Varsity, demon
strated by a 10 to 0 score that it was
properly superior to its 1926 understudies.
Even with the aid of two varsity twirlers
and Coach Wolters himself, the fresh
men were unable to hold down the
Varsity or pile up any points in the run
column. A good brand of ball was of
fered, considering the soggy condition
oi the turf, but the 1926 team, at first
appearance, does not compare favorably
with the championship freshman aggre
gation of last year.
Coach Wolters started Morrison in the
box for the Varsity and delegated Solo
mon, star pitcher of the 1925 team, to do
mound duty for the Babes, as the pitch
ers on the yearling squad are not as yet
sufficiently rounded into condition. A
bunt converted into a hit by ee Aydelette
was the only incident of the freshman
half of the first frame, the other men
being easy outs. Woodward opened the
Varsity season with a single, and was
advanced to third by Roberts' bunt.
Peavy scorcd Woodward with a single
over second, and advanced when Mc-
Candless got a life on an error at first
base. DefTenbach put a safety through
deep third, scoring Peavy. Acheson
walked and Mulchay scored McCandless
and advanced both runners with a sacri
fice, allowing them to score on Fuller's
hit over second. Morrison went out at
first, ending the inning.
With a five-run lead tucked away, the
Varsity might have slowed down, hut
they didn't. The second frame was one
two-threc, but in the third two errors by
the Babe shortstop rqixed in with two
passes to first, a sacrifice hit. and a stolen
base, produced another brace of tallies
without the aid of a single safe blow.
The fourth brought a pair of singles, a
fielder's choice, which left both men safe,
and a dropped third strike, giving the
Varsity two more counts. The last
marker came in the sixth inning, when
Patterson utilized the Babe generosity
and negotiated the complete circut on
three errors and a stolen base.
The yearlings toiled along through the
whole game playing good ball, but lack
ing the punch at critical moments. Five
hits were credited to five members of
their team, but each came in a separate
inning and the Varsity defense was too
tight to give the first-year men any
breaks. With the exception of two dou
ble plays executed by the Varsity, the
game was just ordinary early-season
baseball and showed nothing of the spec
tacular. Better base running on the part
of the Dinks would not have altered the
score, but would have improved their
showing a trifle. Just now the team is
good raw material, but there are plenty
of rough spots for Coach Wolters to
smooth out.
Substitutions were numerous, and Wol
ters gave most members of both squads
a chance to show their wares. Each
pitcher worked only two innings, and the
coach himself took the mound for the
1926 outfit in the latter stages of the
game. In fact, the thrill of the after
noon came when Wolters held a pro
longed and pungent conversation from
the box with Umpire Denny, who, ac
cording to the ex-major leaguer, was so
blind that he didn't know the ball was
thrown until it smacked into the catcher's
mitt. Denny held his ground and award
ed four bases on balls to the men who
faced Wolters, though he unbent suffi
ciently to call the third strike on four
other batsmen. Teague and Clark also
took a turn on the slab, and both seemed
to have their shoots working in the old
baffling way.
The game started with the following
line-ups:

the box with Umpire Denny, who, ac
cording to the ex-major leaguer, was so
blind that he didn't know the ball was

ed four bases on balls to the men who

In the first brush of the 1923 base
ball season, held on the freshman field
yesterday afternoon, the Varsity, demon
strated by a 10 to 0 score that it was
properly superior to its 1926 understudies.
Even with the aid of two varsity twirlers
and Coach Wolters himself, the fresh
men were unable to hold down the
Varsity or pile up any points in the run
column. A good brand of ball was of
fered, considering the soggy condition
oi the turf, but the 1926 team, at first
appearance, does not compare favorably
with the championship freshman aggre
gation of last year.
Coach Wolters started Morrison in the
box for the Varsity and delegated Solo
mon, star pitcher of the 1925 team, to do
mound duty for the Babes, as the pitch
ers on the yearling squad are not as yet
sufficiently rounded into condition. A
bunt converted into a hit by ee Aydelette
was the only incident of the freshman
half of the first frame, the other men
being easy outs. Woodward opened the
Varsity season with a single, and was
advanced to third by Roberts' bunt.
Peavy scorcd Woodward with a single
over second, and advanced when Mc-
Candless got a life on an error at first
base. DefTenbach put a safety through
deep third, scoring Peavy. Acheson
walked and Mulchay scored McCandless
and advanced both runners with a sacri
fice, allowing them to score on Fuller's
hit over second. Morrison went out at
first, ending the inning.
With a five-run lead tucked away, the
Varsity might have slowed down, hut
they didn't. The second frame was one
two-threc, but in the third two errors by
the Babe shortstop rqixed in with two
passes to first, a sacrifice hit. and a stolen
base, produced another brace of tallies
without the aid of a single safe blow.
The fourth brought a pair of singles, a
fielder's choice, which left both men safe,
and a dropped third strike, giving the
Varsity two more counts. The last
marker came in the sixth inning, when
Patterson utilized the Babe generosity
and negotiated the complete circut on
three errors and a stolen base.
The yearlings toiled along through the
whole game playing good ball, but lack
ing the punch at critical moments. Five
hits were credited to five members of
their team, but each came in a separate
inning and the Varsity defense was too
tight to give the first-year men any
breaks. With the exception of two dou
ble plays executed by the Varsity, the
game was just ordinary early-season
baseball and showed nothing of the spec
tacular. Better base running on the part
of the Dinks would not have altered the
score, but would have improved their
showing a trifle. Just now the team is
good raw material, but there are plenty
of rough spots for Coach Wolters to
smooth out.
Substitutions were numerous, and Wol
ters gave most members of both squads
a chance to show their wares. Each
pitcher worked only two innings, and the
coach himself took the mound for the
1926 outfit in the latter stages of the
game. In fact, the thrill of the after
