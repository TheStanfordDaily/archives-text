# VARSITY BASEBALL SQUAD DECISIVELY DEFEATS FRESHMEN
## 
### 
In the first brush of the 1923 base
ball season, held on the freshman field
yesterday afternoon, the Varsity, demon
strated by a 10 to 0 score that it was
properly superior to its 1926 understudies.
Even with the aid of two varsity twirlers
and Coach Wolters himself, the fresh
men were unable to hold down the
Varsity or pile up any points in the run
column. A good brand of ball was of
fered, considering the soggy condition
oi the turf, but the 1926 team, at first
appearance, does not compare favorably
with the championship freshman aggre

Coach Wolters started Morrison in the
box for the Varsity and delegated Solo
mon, star pitcher of the 1925 team, to do

bunt converted into a hit by ee Aydelette
was the only incident of the freshman
half of the first frame, the other men
being easy outs. Woodward opened the
Varsity season with a single, and was
advanced to third by Roberts' bunt.
Peavy scorcd Woodward with a single
over second, and advanced when Mc-
Candless got a life on an error at first
base. DefTenbach put a safety through
deep third, scoring Peavy. Acheson
walked and Mulchay scored McCandless
and advanced both runners with a sacri
fice, allowing them to score on Fuller's
hit over second. Morrison went out at
first, ending the inning.
With a five-run lead tucked away, the
Varsity might have slowed down, hut
they didn't. The second frame was one
two-threc, but in the third two errors by
the Babe shortstop rqixed in with two
passes to first, a sacrifice hit. and a stolen
base, produced another brace of tallies
without the aid of a single safe blow.
The fourth brought a pair of singles, a
fielder's choice, which left both men safe,
and a dropped third strike, giving the
Varsity two more counts. The last
marker came in the sixth inning, when
Patterson utilized the Babe generosity
and negotiated the complete circut on
three errors and a stolen base.
The yearlings toiled along through the
