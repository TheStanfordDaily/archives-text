# DR. JORDAN TO BE GUEST TONIGHT AT BIRTHDAY DINNER
## Seventy-Second Anniversary Of Chancellor Emeritus to Be Observed by "Family" 
### 
The seventy-second birthday of Dr.
Jordan, first president of Stanford and
; now Chancellor Emeritus of the Uni
: versity, will l>c celebrated this evening
-1 with a "Stanford family" dinner at the
I Stanford Union.
President Wilbur will preside at the
: dinner, and Dr. O. L. Elliott, who was
| one of the first men called to Stanford
by Dr. Jordan when the University
opened its doors in 1891, will voice the
i tribute of all Stanford people to Dr.
j Jordan; the Chancellor will be called on
I for an informal talk, recalling the early
days of the University and the growth
of the institution in influence and pres-
I tige during the thirty years of its cx
j istence.
The dinner will be altogether a "family
- affair," only members of the faculty,
I trustees and immediate relatives of Dr.
Jordan attending.
For a number of years it has been Mrs.
Jordan's custom to have the members of
the "Old Guard" of the faculty for a
dinner at the Jordan residence to cele
brate his birthday. Two years ago, on
Dr. Jordan's seventieth birthday, the "Old
Guard" dinner was held at the president's
house, with President and Mrs. Wilbur
as host and hostess, and afterwards the
campus community gathered to congratu
late Dr. Jordan on reaching the Biblical
three score years and ten.
