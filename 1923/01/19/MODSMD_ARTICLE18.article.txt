# Cast of Ram's Head Play Will Be Selected Monday
## 
### 
Final choice of the cast and chorus
! for the Ram's Head Show will not be
made until Monday, according to an an
nouncement made by Director Arnold
| Bayley today. While some of the places
have been tentatively filled, nothing defi
nite has been decided upon, as yet, and
| the large size of the cast makes decision
doubly difficult.
Music scores for the play were scledocf
at a meeting held yesterday, and the first'
! act will be in complete form bv Monday
night, when first rehearsals of the play
will begin.
The book for the play is receiving final
polishing and retouching from the au
thors, Phil Newill and Mike Ely, and.
according to those who claim authority
011 such subjects, it will be an entirely
new idea for Ram's Head plays.
The burlesque idea has been abandoned
to a considerable extent, yet enough re
tained to liven up the conversation with
a background of foolishness 'hat will
furnish critics with something to think
iabout for some time to come.
