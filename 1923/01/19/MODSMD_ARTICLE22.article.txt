# HOW REAL IS THE ROUGH?

"Dirty cords, a wretched flannel shirt, no tie, a
nondescript hat or cap, dilapidated shoes, a slouch, a
grudge against co-eds, and a bellowing 'Hello.'
Please classify."
Were the above paragraph to appear in a local
publication, the answers enclosed in letters with Palo
Alto and Stanford University postmarks would be
pretty much alike. The answer is—a Stanford man's
idea of himself.
Let the Stanford man put himself in the observer's
shoes—let him look ten years into the future —let
him get his mind out of the cramped position of its
present environment —and then go over the results
•of his personal invoice. If his cords are dirty, it will
be because he has not enough money to pay the
laundress. If his shoes are dilapidated, it will be
because he can't afford a new pair. If he bellows a
"Hello" to a stranger, Agnews will get on the job.
If he has a grudge against a co-ed, she will probably
be his wife. So much for the point of view.
Tradition has 110 equal if it is spontaneous and has
a wide appeal. It will be strong and will have a
strong influence if those affected by it abide by its
rules because they want to do so. Otherwise, it is
-only one of the too numerous restraints any society
may have.
If a man says "Hello" because he wishes to do so,
all well and good. If he speaks to a stranger only
because tradition tells him to do so. a false note will
creep into his voice and the stranger will dislike it.
If a man cannot speak to another without being arti
ficial about it, tradition should feel pleased if such an
individual speaks only when he feels like it.
If a man wants to wear a white collar, it is his own
business. The much talked-of Stanford democracy
is not one if it insists upon standardization of dress.
It is individual action and originality that Stanford
teaches its students. The true Stanford lays down
no laws and forces nobody through a common mold
with the aid of tradition.
The rough, if he but stops to analyze his thoughts
and his habits, finds that but a mere handful of these
arc his own. He is only one of a crowd, doing as the
crowd decrees.
Stanford might profit by a cleaning of her ward
robe. It certainly would do her no harm if the cloak
of tradition were taken off the same hook with the
skirts of democracy so that both might have room
without mutual disarrangement.

laundress. If his shoes are dilapidated, it will be
because he can't afford a new pair. If he bellows a
"Hello" to a stranger, Agnews will get on the job.
If he has a grudge against a co-ed, she will probably
be his wife. So much for the point of view.
Tradition has 110 equal if it is spontaneous and has
a wide appeal. It will be strong and will have a
strong influence if those affected by it abide by its
rules because they want to do so. Otherwise, it is
-only one of the too numerous restraints any society
may have.
If a man says "Hello" because he wishes to do so,
all well and good. If he speaks to a stranger only
because tradition tells him to do so. a false note will
creep into his voice and the stranger will dislike it.
If a man cannot speak to another without being arti
ficial about it, tradition should feel pleased if such an
individual speaks only when he feels like it.
If a man wants to wear a white collar, it is his own
business. The much talked-of Stanford democracy
is not one if it insists upon standardization of dress.
It is individual action and originality that Stanford
teaches its students. The true Stanford lays down
no laws and forces nobody through a common mold
with the aid of tradition.
The rough, if he but stops to analyze his thoughts
and his habits, finds that but a mere handful of these
arc his own. He is only one of a crowd, doing as the
crowd decrees.
Stanford might profit by a cleaning of her ward
robe. It certainly would do her no harm if the cloak
of tradition were taken off the same hook with the
skirts of democracy so that both might have room
without mutual disarrangement.
"Dirty cords, a wretched flannel shirt, no tie, a
nondescript hat or cap, dilapidated shoes, a slouch, a
grudge against co-eds, and a bellowing 'Hello.'
Please classify."
Were the above paragraph to appear in a local
publication, the answers enclosed in letters with Palo
Alto and Stanford University postmarks would be
pretty much alike. The answer is—a Stanford man's
idea of himself.
Let the Stanford man put himself in the observer's
shoes—let him look ten years into the future —let
him get his mind out of the cramped position of its
present environment —and then go over the results
•of his personal invoice. If his cords are dirty, it will
be because he has not enough money to pay the
laundress. If his shoes are dilapidated, it will be
because he can't afford a new pair. If he bellows a
"Hello" to a stranger, Agnews will get on the job.
If he has a grudge against a co-ed, she will probably
be his wife. So much for the point of view.
