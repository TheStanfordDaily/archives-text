# THE 						PROPOSED MERGER
## 
### 
The Stanford Cardinal, published under the aus
pices of the English Club, and the Stanford Pictorial,
published by the Press Club, will soon be one maga
zine, published by the two organizations, if present
plans are carried out. There can be no doubt alwut
the wisdom of this plan. It is made necessary, Ixith
by advertising difficulties and by editorial limitations.
And it has been hastened bv a lack of co-operation
between the Pictorial and Cardinal staffs. P*)th have
for at least a year regarded each other as utterly
superfluous. But it has been evident that there is
enough good material published in each to justify
the continuation of one publication.
The combination marks another step in Stanford
journalismâ€”we hope for the better. Press Club and

English Club may do much toward directing and
encouraging literary and editorial talent on the
campus by affecting the proposed agreement.
If the combination is made, however, it will be
necessary to insure the future against any journalistic
wild-catting. There is little to prevent a disappointed
candidate for the editorship of a local magazine from
starting a publication of his own. It has been done
in the past and might easily be done again. There
certainly should be a constitutional amendment to
provide against such a fiasco until the growth of the
student body will permit further expansion.
