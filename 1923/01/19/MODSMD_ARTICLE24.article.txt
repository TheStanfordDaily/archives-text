It is rumored that the latest in college dances will
appear for the first time last week in the dance to be
given exclusively for those having the price of admission
$1 at the Clubhouse Saturday night. The name of the
dance is "The Nervous Breakdown," and is a knockout.

I don't mind carving when asked out, but the gravy
never DOES match the wall-paper!
* * *
"I am fond," remarked Reggie the Rough, pensively
dodging a ripe tomato hurled from over the footlights,
"I am fond of wine, women, and song. Especially the
first three."
* * *
THE PARTY DRESS
A whispered scream rent the rented atmosphere of the
little house behind the hedge just off the sidewalk.
"Mother, help, help!" cried the cryer, spasmodically and
continuously.
"What, dear?" cried her mother calmly, shifting her
gum over to the side where the hollow tooth was.
* * *
"My party dress, it's gone, lost! All is lost," came
the muffled sobs from the girl.
"Quick!" cried the mother, shifting her gum over to
the side where the gold tooth was. "Where is that
mosquito netting we had last summer? Get it, immedi
ately, if not sooner."
She did so.
* * *
"Tear it in two —that's right. Get me a pin, and that
two-inch strip of ribbon left over from your last scarf,"
directed the mother.
Working rapidly, the fond mother soon had the new
dress ready, just as the girl's partner arrived in papa's
car. She was going to the dance, after all She kissed
her mamma goodby, swallowed her gum in the excite
ment, and was whirled away.
"My, how nice you look," floated back to fond mamma
from the partner as the car disappeared.
* * *
The hotel where the hop was to be given was lit up
as it had never been before. So were most of the guests.
About nine o'clock the musicians got mad and started
venting their wrath through various instruments. Only
sons and lonely daughters started tripping lightly about
over each other's feet. A bathing suit salesman came
into the hotel, looked and rushed out to send
a wire to his firm. It was to the effect that' bathing
suits were selling like wildfire in Palmolivia.
* * *
The elevator boy came down, opened the door, looked
out, slammed the door, and went back up in high.
"I wonder," he said, "why they are undressing in the
lobby."
The musicians got mad and started up again
* * *
In the faint light of breaking day the partner stopped
papa's car in front of the little house behind the side
walk. Escorting her to the door, he dashed back to the
car and off. The perfectly wonderful party was over.

"I am fond," remarked Reggie the Rough, pensively
dodging a ripe tomato hurled from over the footlights,
"I am fond of wine, women, and song. Especially the
first three."

THE PARTY DRESS
A whispered scream rent the rented atmosphere of the
little house behind the hedge just off the sidewalk.
"Mother, help, help!" cried the cryer, spasmodically and
continuously.
"What, dear?" cried her mother calmly, shifting her
gum over to the side where the hollow tooth was.
* * *
"My party dress, it's gone, lost! All is lost," came
the muffled sobs from the girl.
"Quick!" cried the mother, shifting her gum over to
the side where the gold tooth was. "Where is that
mosquito netting we had last summer? Get it, immedi
ately, if not sooner."
She did so.
* * *
"Tear it in two —that's right. Get me a pin, and that
two-inch strip of ribbon left over from your last scarf,"
directed the mother.
Working rapidly, the fond mother soon had the new
dress ready, just as the girl's partner arrived in papa's
car. She was going to the dance, after all She kissed
her mamma goodby, swallowed her gum in the excite
ment, and was whirled away.
"My, how nice you look," floated back to fond mamma
from the partner as the car disappeared.

The hotel where the hop was to be given was lit up
as it had never been before. So were most of the guests.
About nine o'clock the musicians got mad and started
venting their wrath through various instruments. Only
sons and lonely daughters started tripping lightly about
over each other's feet. A bathing suit salesman came
into the hotel, looked and rushed out to send
a wire to his firm. It was to the effect that' bathing
suits were selling like wildfire in Palmolivia.
* * *
The elevator boy came down, opened the door, looked
out, slammed the door, and went back up in high.
"I wonder," he said, "why they are undressing in the
lobby."
The musicians got mad and started up again
* * *
In the faint light of breaking day the partner stopped
papa's car in front of the little house behind the side
walk. Escorting her to the door, he dashed back to the
car and off. The perfectly wonderful party was over.
