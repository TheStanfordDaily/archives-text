"Governor Stanford," the lirst locomo
tive operated on the Central Pacific, has
recently been placed in the Stanford
Museum. In order to get the engine into
the building, a hole big enough for its
passage had to be cut into the brick and
cement wall. Since 1893, when it was
brought on the Southern Pacific tracks
from the Midwinter Fair at San Fran
cisco, the old engine has been hidden
away in a wooden shack to the rear of
the Museum.
Scholarship, student government, the
undemocratic tendency at Stanford, fra
ternities. athletics, and the junior college
idea are the important subjects dealt with
in the annual report of President Wilbur'.
He devotes considerable attention to the
development of junior colleges in Cali
fornia, which he calls the most far-reach
ing change in the educational system of
the state, and which he prophesies will do
much toward lifting the status of Cali
fornia in education, not only in secondary,
but also in University work.
A dime fund has been started to pur
chase a carving table for the Union. This
table, similar to those on exhibition at
Larkin's, will contain the carved initials
of Stanford generations present and fu
ture. When one is used up, it will be
hung on the Union walls and another
bought to take its place.
The Stanford Band of forty-fiv% men
will make a ten-day tour of the southern
part of the state this summer. During
the spring vacation, the band has been
invited to give a series of concerts in
Nevada.
Baseball season opens officially on the
Stanford diamond tomorrow afternoon,
when the Cardinal varsity crosses bats
with a speedy team of college all-stars
brought to the campus by "Wabbles"
Stafford, former Stanford second base
man.
