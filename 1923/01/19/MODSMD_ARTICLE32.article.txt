# LIGHTWEIGHT TEAM TO MEET SAN MATEO HI IN PRELIMINARY GAME
## 
### 
The fast Cardinal lightweight basket
hall team will play their third game of
the season against the San Mateo High
School five at 7 o'clock tonight in the
Pavilion, as a preliminary to the Stan
ford-Nevada game.
"Bud" Young's 130-pounders are brainy
and aggressive; they have defeated the
Palo Alto and Mountain View High
Schools, 18-5 and 37-15, respectively. The
San Mateo quintet have also rung up a
victory against the Palo Alto court ar
tists, and according to D. C. JiJertrand,
lightweight manager, they will have a
strong team on the floor against the light
weights this evening.
Hobro and Meyers will probably play
the forward positions, with Shaw at cen
ter and Thompson and Young doing the
guarding.
