## Babe Quintet Due to Score Another Win in Preliminary Brush With Prep Cage Men 
### Don Liebendorfer 
( oacli "Husky" Hunt's freshman
court quintet is scheduled to meet the
Sacramento High School aggregation
tomorrow night in the Pavilion in the
preliminary to the Stanford Varsity-
Nevada game. The preliminary will be
called at 7 o'clock.
It begins to look as though the
babes have the material for a fast
team. They have improved with every
game and seem due to strike their top
form within q, week or so. Every regu
lar on the squad is a fighter and with
the addition of a little experience some
of them should be welcome to Kerr
next year.
Mitchell, who has been holding down
the running guard job so satisfactorily,
has a lease on his position. He is the
fastest man on the team when he has
the ball and his dribbling and passing
j are valuable factors in the team's de
fense and offense. McDermont, his run
ning mate at standing guard, is not
flashy, but a consistent and hard-work
i ing player who seldom lets a man get
away from him.
Morrison may not be able to play
tomorrow night. He has been on the
injured list with a sprained ankle
since the Lowell game. Carter, the big
J lanky blonde, who has been taking his
place at center, has been improving
and segms to be getting a little self
confidence.
Nevers and Frazier have proved
themselves to be the best forward
combination. Nevers has at last found
the basket and his ability to pile up
points together with his floor work is
a valuable asset to the team. Frazier
is not sure of his shots for the hoop
but his defenseive and passing game
have won him a regular berth.
The yearling five has won three or
four starts and should make it four
out of five tomorrow night in spite of
the fact that the Capital City preps
{bring a good reputation with them.
