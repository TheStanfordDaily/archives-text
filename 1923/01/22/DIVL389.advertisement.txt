Andy Smith is sure of a place as foot
ball coach at California for the next four
or five years. The executive committee
of that institution has decided to cancel
Smith's present contract and sign him
under a new one.

the U. C. authorities feared that they
might lose Smith, as he has already
turned down several offers from Eastern
