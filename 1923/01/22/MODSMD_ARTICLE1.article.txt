## FRENCH REVISE PLAN OF RUHR OCCUPATION 
### (By United Press 
PARIS, Jan. 22. —Marshal Focli and j
the French cabinet today decided upon |
new measures "of a military and eco
nomic nature" to meet the strike of
German miners and railroad workers J
in the Ruhr.
At the same time, the French com-1
mander at Essen released Herr j
Ahrens, state mine director, whose re-j
turn was hailed tumultuously by strik-'
ing miners; troops were withdrawn
from the vicinity of the state mines
and from the Reichsbank at Essen,
and the French pledged themselves to
maintain only a small watch at rail
road stations, this concession causing 1
German railroad workers at South
Dortmund to return to work.
These preliminary concessions were
not considered indicative of the
French attitude in general, however,
and it is understood severe measures
are planned.
LONDON, Jan. 22. —Germany is on I
the eve of instituting military con-'
scription, which the Versailles treaty
forbids, according to the Daily Mail's
Mayence correspondent.
