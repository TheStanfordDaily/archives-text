# FRESHMEN PILE UP BIG SCORE IN SACRAMENTO
## 
### Don Liebendorfer 
After the first ten minutes of the
| game with Sacramento High School
; Saturday night, the Cardinal freshman
quintet played good basketball and
i easily defeated the Capitol City lads
| 37-11.
Either the shock from the sight of the
| preps in their "bathing girl" outfits or
the fact that Nevers was not in the fracas
seemed to hold the babes spellbound for
j half of the first period.
The high school lads registered three
i field baskets before Hunt's team discov
-1 ered there was a game in progress and
' when they finally remembered about the
game they forgot about the basket.
] That 6-0 score against the Card babes
seemed to get on Frazier's narves and lie
started taking a hand in affairs. He sunk
two pretty ones in rapid succession and
from then until the end of the game, the
preps were the second best team on the
floor.
Enter Ernie Nevers, whose floor work
had been greatly missed. Mitchell was
so glad to see the big forward in the
I game that he caged a neat one from sheer
jov.
Soon after, lie found the hoop again,
as did Frazier, Nevers, and Carter. The
boys made their last field
goal of the game just before the end of
the first half, which ended with the score
at 18-8.
The second half was a repetition of the
latter part of the first. Carter and 'Fra
zier did most of the scoring with Nevers
and Mitchell each getting loose to drop
| in a field goal.
The preppeTs showed little defensive
I and less offensive strength and could reg
! ister but three points, all on free throws.
Frazier, with seven field goals, was the
; high point man. He was all over the
court, breaking up the high school pass
| ing game and finding little trouble in
j getting loose to toss in baskets whenever
he felt like it.
Carter accounted for four field goals
and three free ones. He played in hard
luck most of the first half, his shots
rolling around the rim of the hoop and
dropping out almost every 'time. The
big fellow showed new life, however, and
played a brand of floor game that he has
never exhibited before.
Nevers contented himself with defen
sive work and feeding to Frazier and
Carter. In addition, he managed to chalk
up six points on two field goals and as
many free ones. McDermot kept the babes'
goal clear after the first few minutes
and played his usual steady game..
"Mugs" Mitchell, who was elected cap
tain of the team Friday afternoon after
practice, was half the show, as usual.
Resides accounting for three field goals,
he was the backbone of the team on the
offensive, charging through and breaking
up the high school team work time after
time.
He has played good defensive ball in
every game, but his playing last night
proves that he is going to be a valuable
asset in the scoring department.
Hunt used thirteen men in Saturday
night's fracas. With two minutes to
play, he sent in five new men to replace
the already patched line-up.
