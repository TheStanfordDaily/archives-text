El Campo Defeats Encina Despite
Absence of Young and Hobro
El Campo without the services of
three of its best men found consider
able difficulty in defeating, 8-5, the

j Encina fourth floor team. Hobro and
Penny packer, each of whom made
three baskets in their first game of
the tournament, did not play, Hobro
playing on the 130-poond team instead.
Young, who also was much needed by
El Campo, was not able to play for the
same reason.
With this loss. El Campo was even
ly matched with the Encina team and
neither one was able to make any
headway against the other during the
first half. The score at half time stood
2-2, Otis scoring once for Encina and
Bertrand for El Campo.
With the opening of the second half,
both teams made a rush for the ball
but El Campo had the better endur
ance and soon managed to break
through the defense made by Encina.
Three baskets were made in quick suc
cession, Hill, Hosepian, and McKee
each contributing one.
In spite of the lack of support he
received from his teammates, Otis of
Encina was the individual star, guard
ing, blocking, and dribbling well, be
sides making all the points for his
team.
Robison and Eggleston Outshoot
Mulchay and El Cuadro Wins 21-12
El Cuadro piled up a large lead
early in their game with Theta Xi and
held it throughout the game to the
21-13 finish. In the middle of the sec
ond half it was seriously threatened
when the Theta Xi players who had
been trailing 15-6 at the half got their
eyes on the basket and brought the
score up to 15-12.
El Cuadro was by far the better
team and, except for a few minutes in
the second half when they eased up
and allowed Theta Xi to nearly tie the
count, they had the game their own
way, playing with fast, long passes
which got them under the basket be
fore Theta Xi could get up a good
defense.
Robison made two pretty one-hand
shots from the side of the floor, and
at center usually got the jump.
Muchay was the whole team for
Theta Xi, covering the floor and doing
most of the shooting. The five baskets
he made came after fast floor work
and clever dribbling through all five
of El Cuadro's hoopers.

three of its best men found consider
able difficulty in defeating, 8-5, the

j Encina fourth floor team. Hobro and
Penny packer, each of whom made
three baskets in their first game of
the tournament, did not play, Hobro
playing on the 130-poond team instead.
Young, who also was much needed by
El Campo, was not able to play for the
same reason.
With this loss. El Campo was even
ly matched with the Encina team and
neither one was able to make any
headway against the other during the
first half. The score at half time stood
2-2, Otis scoring once for Encina and
Bertrand for El Campo.
With the opening of the second half,
both teams made a rush for the ball
but El Campo had the better endur
ance and soon managed to break
through the defense made by Encina.
Three baskets were made in quick suc
cession, Hill, Hosepian, and McKee
each contributing one.
In spite of the lack of support he
received from his teammates, Otis of
Encina was the individual star, guard
ing, blocking, and dribbling well, be
sides making all the points for his
team.
Robison and Eggleston Outshoot
Mulchay and El Cuadro Wins 21-12
El Cuadro piled up a large lead
early in their game with Theta Xi and
held it throughout the game to the
21-13 finish. In the middle of the sec
ond half it was seriously threatened
when the Theta Xi players who had
been trailing 15-6 at the half got their
eyes on the basket and brought the
score up to 15-12.
El Cuadro was by far the better
team and, except for a few minutes in
the second half when they eased up
and allowed Theta Xi to nearly tie the
count, they had the game their own
way, playing with fast, long passes
which got them under the basket be
fore Theta Xi could get up a good
defense.
Robison made two pretty one-hand
shots from the side of the floor, and
at center usually got the jump.
Muchay was the whole team for
Theta Xi, covering the floor and doing
most of the shooting. The five baskets
he made came after fast floor work
and clever dribbling through all five
of El Cuadro's hoopers.
