# MASQUER'S DRAMA MAY BE OFFERED IN SAN FRANCISCO
## Production of "He Who Gets Slapped" Under Auspices of Stage Guild Planned 
### 
Plans for a second presentation of "He
Who Gets Slapped" in San Francisco,
under the auspices of the San Francisco
Stage Guild, on Saturday evening, Janu
ary 27, the night following the staging
of the play in the Assembly Hall, are
being considered by Masqeurs' Society.
Whether or not the San Francisco pro
duction will be possible will be announced
tomorrow, according to Director Richard
Bentinck.
The Stage Guild is particularly inter
ested in "He Who Gets Slapped," be
cause of the national reputation the
drama has achieved among followers of
the theater, and because the Masquers
offering will be the first appearance of
Andreyev's piece on the Pacific Coast.
As members of the Stage Guild have ex
pressed general interest in the presen
tation, the Stanford players may under
take the off-campus production provid
ing that arrangements can be made sat
sfactory to the society and the University
authorities.
If the San Francisco production is ar
ranged, "He Who Gets Slapped" will
be the first Stanford play to be presented
off the campus. The unusual quality of
the drama, which is believed by many to
be one of the most noteworthy ever of
fered, led to the attempt to afford patrons
of the drama the opportunity to witness
Andreyev's product.
The San Francisco Stage Guild is an
organization formed of players and oth
ers interested in the stage. It corresponds
in many respccts to the New York The
ater Guild, which gave the first produc
tion of "He Who Gets Slapped" in the
United States.
The San Francisco Stage Guild is the
organization whose company produced
"Enter Madame," under the auspices of
the Palo Alio Community players in the
Assembly hall last quarter. This presen
tation of '"Enter Madame." a drama built
around the character of a temperamental
prima donna, was termed by Palo Alto
critics as the finest dramatic offering ever
given at Stanford or Palo Alto.
The San Francisco Stage Guild is plan
ning to give some dramatic piece on Feb
ruary 2 in the Assembly hall. This per
formance may be in the nature of an ex
change offering for "He Who Gels
Slapped."
