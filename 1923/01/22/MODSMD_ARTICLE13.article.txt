# STANFORD SOCCER ELEVENS WIN TWO CONTESTS, TIE ONE
## 
### 
Two victories and one tie resulted
Saturday when the Stanford soccer
teams played three outside elevens.
Trafalgar, ihe Sons of Saint George,
were defeated by the varsity 5 to 0
on their San Mateo field.
The freshman ball-kickers outplayed
the San Mateo high school boys by a
score of 3 to 0.
The game between the Vikings and
the second varsity finished an even
1 to 1.
The win of the varsity over
Trafalgar, large as it is for a soccer
contest, does not indicate the true
character of the game, as the Trafal
gar club tvks much stronger than that
which came up against the varsity
last quarter.
The principal addition to their
strength is Bill Welsh, age 53, who
played in the international champion
ships twenty years ago in Scotland.
Welsh, at center forward, caused the
varsity men a great deal of trouble;
in spite of his age he played a very
active game, and his long-cultivated
strength and skill went far toward
evening up the differences between the
two elevens.
A muddy, slippery field and a heavy
ball slowed up the game. Nevertheless,
the game was a good exhibition of
teamwork.

With one or two exceptions the
line-up Saturday was the same as the
one which placed Stanford at the top
of the University Club Soccer League
last year.
Howe, the varsity's rangy center
half, was very effective in tiring and
slowing up the club's dangerous center
forward. Welsh, the skillful veteran,
remarked after the game that Howe
was the best center half whom he had
seen play in the last seven years, and
expressed the belief that with a few
seasons of practice Howe would be
come the best in that position on the
Pacific Coast.
The only changes in the line-up of
last Saturday's game was the placing
of Richard Johnson and Donald Clark
together as fullbacks.
The freshman squad showed much
better stuff against San Mateo than in
the game last week with Palo Alto
high school, when they were beaten
1 to 0.
During the first half the yearlings
appeared frightened. They were un
able to play together effefctively and
were only capable of holding the high
school even.
In hte second half Coach Maloney
shifted Shone from left half to center
forward, and the resulting change in
the combination gave the frosh the
needed punch.
All three goals were kicked during
the last part of the second half. Best
work for the freshmen was done by
Franklin at center half. Shone at cen
ter forward, and Campbell and Pol
lard, fullbacks. Shone made the three
scores for the Babes.
The game on the Stanford soccer
field between the second varsity and
the Vikings was also slowed up by a
muddy field. As the second team has
not played together individual ability
of the men accounted for the even
showing against the formidable Vik
ings. Compared to the varsity contest
the game was slow and characterized
by poor passing on both sides.
As the second varsity had only ten
men on hand they were forced to play
the entire game with ten against the
Viking's eleven.
The following men played for the
second varsity: John, goal; Rogers,
Tucker, fullbacks; Acheson, Smith and
Snow, fullbacks; Hall, Hoover, Hamil
ton and Burnie, forwards.

1 to 0.
During the first half the yearlings
appeared frightened. They were un
able to play together effefctively and
were only capable of holding the high
school even.
In hte second half Coach Maloney
shifted Shone from left half to center
forward, and the resulting change in
the combination gave the frosh the
needed punch.
All three goals were kicked during
the last part of the second half. Best
work for the freshmen was done by
Franklin at center half. Shone at cen
ter forward, and Campbell and Pol
lard, fullbacks. Shone made the three
scores for the Babes.
The game on the Stanford soccer
field between the second varsity and
the Vikings was also slowed up by a
muddy field. As the second team has
not played together individual ability
of the men accounted for the even
showing against the formidable Vik
ings. Compared to the varsity contest
the game was slow and characterized
by poor passing on both sides.
As the second varsity had only ten
men on hand they were forced to play
the entire game with ten against the
Viking's eleven.
The following men played for the
second varsity: John, goal; Rogers,
Tucker, fullbacks; Acheson, Smith and
Snow, fullbacks; Hall, Hoover, Hamil
ton and Burnie, forwards.
Two victories and one tie resulted
Saturday when the Stanford soccer
teams played three outside elevens.
Trafalgar, ihe Sons of Saint George,
were defeated by the varsity 5 to 0
on their San Mateo field.
The freshman ball-kickers outplayed
the San Mateo high school boys by a
score of 3 to 0.
The game between the Vikings and
the second varsity finished an even
1 to 1.
The win of the varsity over
Trafalgar, large as it is for a soccer
contest, does not indicate the true
character of the game, as the Trafal
gar club tvks much stronger than that
which came up against the varsity
last quarter.
The principal addition to their
strength is Bill Welsh, age 53, who
played in the international champion
ships twenty years ago in Scotland.
Welsh, at center forward, caused the
varsity men a great deal of trouble;
in spite of his age he played a very
active game, and his long-cultivated
strength and skill went far toward
evening up the differences between the
two elevens.
A muddy, slippery field and a heavy
ball slowed up the game. Nevertheless,
the game was a good exhibition of
teamwork.

With one or two exceptions the
line-up Saturday was the same as the
one which placed Stanford at the top
of the University Club Soccer League
last year.
Howe, the varsity's rangy center
half, was very effective in tiring and
slowing up the club's dangerous center
forward. Welsh, the skillful veteran,
remarked after the game that Howe
was the best center half whom he had
seen play in the last seven years, and
expressed the belief that with a few
seasons of practice Howe would be
come the best in that position on the
Pacific Coast.
The only changes in the line-up of
last Saturday's game was the placing
of Richard Johnson and Donald Clark
together as fullbacks.
The freshman squad showed much
better stuff against San Mateo than in
the game last week with Palo Alto
high school, when they were beaten
1 to 0.
