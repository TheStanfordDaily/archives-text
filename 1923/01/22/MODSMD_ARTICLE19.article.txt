# LACK OF RESPECT FOR LAW MENACE SAYS KLEINSMID
## Chief Agencies of Education Must Raise Standards, Says President of U.S.C. 
### 
There is evidence of a growing lack of
respect toward law and order in the
American home, and this influence ex
tends vastly beyond the home in the
schools, church, state, street, and shop.
This was the warning Dr. Rufus B. von
KleinSmid, president of the University
of Southern California, gave today in ad
dressing the assembly on "Agencies of
Education for Civic Responsibilities."
Education Agencies Must Improve
Considering the home, the schools, the
church, the press, and the moving picture
industry as the chief agencies of educa
tion, Dr. won KleinSmid advocated an im
provement 'in our standards for each of
these institutions.
Dr. von KleinSmid called attention to
the fact that before the war only 6 per
cent of our school population were en
rolled in high schools, while now every
institution of learning is crowded to ca
pacity.
Real Thought Needed in Schools
j "The United States stands ninth in the
illiteracy percentage," continued Dr. von
KleinSmid, "but I am not as much con
cerned about every man, woman and
i child being in school as I am with what
they do in school after they get there.
We want the men and women coming out
of our schools to THINK.
The products of the moving picture in
dustry reaches from ten to twenty mil
| lion people a week, and should be brought
I to a standard of high educational value.
! "There is a great field between drippy
goodness and salacious badness to be
| depicted by motion pictures," said Dr.
i von KleinSmid.
"The press has been giving us what we
want, say the editors, when asked why
the standard of journalism is not im
j proved.
"When you go out into the world to
| help in the great problem of reconstcuc
tion I hope you will have backbone
j enough to see that we get a little more
of what we ought to have," Dr. von
i Kleinsmid continued.
"We are now facing the greatest gen
! eration of all history, standing in the
presence of the greatest opportunities ever
I vouchsafed to man," Dr. von KleinSmid
| quoted from a recent speaker at U. S.C.
