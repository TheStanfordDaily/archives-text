# AMERICAN EDUCATION
## 
### 
To the Continental an education means a chance
to take his choice at his leisure of a world of knowl
edge—to delve deeply or to skim lightly over as his
fancy chooses. To him an education is not a means
of worldly advancement nor the best of available
routes to fame. To him knowledge for its own. sake
is enough. To make a practical use of it is not as a
general rule a part of his scheme of life.
The Continental makes his money first and then
uses it to attain knowledge. The American en
deavors to gain knowledge first in order that he may
then make money. The result of America's inverted
method may readily be seen.
Instead of acquiring even a smattering of knowl
edge along lines of art, science, or philosophy, the
average American student of today takes the least
circuitous route to financial success. Knowledge that
leads to the profitable cultivation, of' the American
dollar seems to be the general tuend in higher edu
cation in this generation. The American student
does not make money in order to enjoy knowledge,
nor does he acquire the proper kind of knowledge to
enable him to enjoy money. From the first he uses
money's means to gain money's ends. The Conti
nental's system is reversed.
There are, of course, American students of law,
medicine, and the arts. American scientists have no
superiors. But yet, when the proportion of people
in America who receive university educations is con
sidered, the result is not very encouraging. . There
are too many dollars and not enough thoughts. And
the realization that national history is based 011
thought and not on money, and that the future de
pends upon mental dexterity rather than upon finan
cial jugglery, automatically puts an emphatic border
around the handwriting on the wall.
