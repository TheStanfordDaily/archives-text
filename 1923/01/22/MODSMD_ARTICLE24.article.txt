# A 						CAUSE OF TROUBLE

### 
Of all questionable documents, the constitution of
the A. S. U. is the most questionable. What it is
and what it is meant to govern are the only two
things in the entire paper that are even defined
clearly. As to how it is supposed to function, it is
left to manipulation and the exercise of undergradu
ate judgment, at times a rather doubtful procedure
as to advisability.
For example, take one of the student handbooks,
which contains a copy of the constitution and look
over the page on elections. If ever in your legal ex
perience you have been confronted by a more mean
ingless series of inane sentences such as characterize
this particular page, it is to be admitted that your ex
perience has been unfortunate.
From start to finish, the constitution is a patched
up job. As a matter of fact, it was adopted as a
make-shift and the coming of the war gave this col
lege generation the idea that the constitution was
one of long standing. It is time that this legal farce
is re-vamped and made useful for the student body
as a whole rather than as a topic for Executive Com
mittee debate. It is antedated, out of place, and un
satisfactory. Let us have one that means something.
