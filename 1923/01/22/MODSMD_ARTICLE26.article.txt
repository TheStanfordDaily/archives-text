Minor vs. Miner
JONES, JOHN J.
A is a minor, hired by B, who is a miner, to work in
B's mine. Ais therefore a miner as well as a minor. B,
however, according to Justice Eyethot, can not back out
of his contract with A, but A, because he is a minor,
can back out of his contract with B. However, A is
also a miner as well as a minor (ex nudo pacto non
oritur actio). Now if B can not break the contract,
because he is a miner, why should A, who is also a
miner, although a minor miner, be allowed to break it?
Causa qua supra; case dismissed; judgment for jury.

Minor vs. Miner
JONES, JOHN J.
A is a minor, hired by B, who is a miner, to work in
B's mine. Ais therefore a miner as well as a minor. B,
however, according to Justice Eyethot, can not back out
of his contract with A, but A, because he is a minor,
can back out of his contract with B. However, A is
also a miner as well as a minor (ex nudo pacto non
oritur actio). Now if B can not break the contract,
because he is a miner, why should A, who is also a
miner, although a minor miner, be allowed to break it?
Causa qua supra; case dismissed; judgment for jury.
