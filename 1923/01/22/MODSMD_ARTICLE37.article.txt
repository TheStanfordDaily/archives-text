# Tuesday Dead Line for Any Schedule Changes
## 
### 
Students desiring to drop subjects or
to take up new ones will be given until
tomorrow to do so, according to an
announcement today by O. L. Elliott,
University Registrar. Pink cards will
be used up to this date, and all blanks
should be filled in. After Tuesday, no
changes in study lists can be made except
by formal committee action.
Undergraduate study lists are to be
considered as fixed at the end of the first
three weeks of every quarter, according
to the latest Information bulletin. "After
this period, petitions to drop or take up
courses are granted only for extraordi
nary reasons, and, where the taking up
of new subjects is involved, only on pay
ment of a $2 fee for each course.
"If petitions are accepted but presented
after the close of the quarter, they will
lie granted only on payment of a special
fee of $4 for each course. During the
last four weeks of the quarter, no courses
may be officially removed from the stu
dent's study list for any reason whatever;
but if failure to complete a course satis
factorily is due to illness or other un
avoidable circumstance, application may
be made to the Committee on Scholarship
for such relief as shall seem equitable."
