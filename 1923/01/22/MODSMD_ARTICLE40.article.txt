characterized the entire game.

was the only player who scored con
sistently, tallying 8 points. Shaw

completely up to standard in the of
fensive.
The San Mateo team was light and
fast, and by close guarding they were
able to keep the light-weight lead
down, 4-2, in the first quarter.

tied the score regularly, but by playing
a smashing game the lightweight ag
gregation was able to stem the tide
and keep an 8-to-5 lead up to the end
of the first half.

than the preceding period. By taking
advantage of San Mateo's ragged pass
ing, the 130's managed to score an
additional 7 points.
Both teams failed to dribble to any
advantage, preferring the passing
game.
