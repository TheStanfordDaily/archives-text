# Sport of Grandfathers Takes Campus by Storm, Says Horseshoe Athlete
## 
### 
Back to the days of our grand
fathers!
Have you seen anything on the cam
pus lately which reminded you of
them? Of course, the horseshoe tourna
ments which have lately become the
vogue. Everyone is throwing them;
students, professors, and, in a few
cases, the Chinese cooks are out for
proficiency in the sport of black
smiths.
"It's a good thing for Stanford to
have visitors see the innocent sport
of horseshoes instead of the deadly
game of jungle chess they expect from
college students," remarked one advo
cate of the game when interviewed on
the merits of the sport. "Besides, it de
velops accuracy, judgment, and skill.
The game is taking like wildfire; new
ly purchased Mah Jong sets are rust
ing in idleness; bridge tables are de
serted; horseshoes is the sport of the
hour. And, above all," concluded this
able defender of the game, "the numer
ous horseshoe tournaments prove to
the casual visitor one unescapable
fact —Stanford is no one-horse institu
tion!"
