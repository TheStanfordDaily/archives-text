The horse-drawn vehicle has at last
gone by the boards. For thirty-one years
it has struggled against the automobile
for existence, and now Jasper W. Paul
sen, the last.of the "old guard" has closed
his livery stable in Palo Alto and moved
to Mayfield.
Paulsen was the first liveryman in Palo
Alto and the last to give up the business
which played such an important part in
Stanford's early history. Frequent ref
erence to him is found in the under
graduate literature of that day.
Paulsen's bus, called the "Marguerite,"
was drawn by four horses, the regular
transportation rate for students being 10
cents, while 15 cents was charged for all
others. Considerable agitation was
aroused when the fee was later raised to
25 cents for everyone. The fare for
riding in individual carriages was once
50 cents —but it was soon abandoned.
The busses from Encina were always
heavily loaded, students crowding the in
side and decorating the exterior just as
they do the campus trolley cars today.
Elegant, rubber-tired carriages ®with
wicker bodies were employed extensively
by Stanford "queeners," who chose to
drive leisurely in the hills. The experi
enced students in time came to learn that
on such excursions speed was not re
quired and hence the "admirable char
acteristic" of each horse.

Instead of taxi service, there were sev
eral carry-alls. "Uncle John," a ven
erable old man with a long beard, was
skillful in hitting the Circle in Palo Alto
at just the proper speed so that the stu
dents would fly out of the carriage and
on to the train without mishap.
These carriages also served as "rub
berneck" wagons. Uncle John had a tre
mendous imaginative mind, and as a re
sult Stanford is still struggling to live
down the reputation of huge wealth
which he gave her visitors. He informed
those who did not intend entering Encitia
that a piano had been placed in each
man's room, while the rest of the hall's
furnishings matched up to the pianos in
elegance. The squirrel holes in the
ground were dug by Senator and Mrs.
Stanford, who, Uncle John claimed, were
quite solicitous as to the welfare and
comfort of these little rodents. Uncle
John died ten years ago with the repu
tation of being one of the biggest and
best prevaricators of all time.
The trolley line was installed at Stan
ford in 1905, just when automobiles were

beginning to enjoy a wider use. Because
the Stanfords were lovers of horses, they
stoutly protested against the admission of
autos to the campus. When a certain
member of the faculty bought a car,
however, and was told that he could not
bring it on the campus, he retaliated by
declaring that lie would drive his machine
up Palm Drive on a certain day and at
a certain time. His "bluff" was not
called and the first move in breaking
down the prohibition against machines
was made.
The present parallel road to Palm
Drive was originally built for the use of
automobiles, while vegetable, laundry,
and other horse-drawn vehicles were al
lowed to peacefully perambulate down
Palm Drive. Visitors to the campus in
autos were compelled to approach the
University by the "back door."
Bicycles were common means of con
veyance in those days. One or two
"swell" undergraduates rode horses,
while one ingenious student drove a two
horse, high-wheeled vehicle in the inner
Quad one day.
Paulsen in his new livery at Mayfield
will still engage in "horse swapping," an
industry in which he has always been
quite adept.
He was the first in Palo
Alto to the First Million for Stanford.
