# Physical Training Is Required Only In Lower Division
## 
### 
Hereafter the of three!
hours p*'r week physical training will,
apply only to Lower students.
Heretofore all undergraduates have
been to three hours t-iich
week fo r their first six quarters at Stan
ford to this required physical training,
l '.it only Exceptions being in the case of
1i transfer students, who might partially
fulfill the requirements by offering equiv
\ alent training in other colleges or uni
\ versities, and students registered in the
I Military department, who were permitted
'to substitute work in that department
for regular physical training.
The new ruling adopted by the
| Academic Council restricts this require-;
ment hereafter to Lower Division stu
dents. Whether or not they have had
| six quarters of physical training here or
elsewhere, students in the Upper Divi
j sion are exempt from required physical
j training.
The new regulation goes into effect at
! once and men and women who have been '
| required to register for physical train-,
j ing and who think they are exempt by
the new regulation should consult with
j Miss Bunting or Dr. Barrows to arrange
! for dropping it.
The new ruling reads as follows:
"All undergraduates enrolled in the
Lower Division, except those registered
| in the Military department, shall be re
quired to devote three schedule hours per
week for a maximum of six quarters to

work in physical training. Students must
register in regular classes for the above
work and satisfactory attention to it will
be required."
