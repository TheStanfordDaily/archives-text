# CARDINAL SQUAD DOWNS NEVADA IN TWO GAMES
## Stanford – Sagebrush Contests Slow With Heavy Defensive Work by Both Teams; Bob Janssen Stars 
### 
Playing rather ragged basketball, the Cardinal varsity quintet captured two
games from the University of Nevada team last Friday and Saturday. In the
first match, Kerr's squad won by a score of 18 to 12 while the second bout was
taken by a 17-to-10 score.
With both teams playing a strong defensive game, the floor work in both
games was slowed up to an extent. On Stanford's part, there were many
long shots that fell quite short of their mark while an occasional bad pass
ruined an opportunity for a score. The Cardinal defense was practically
impenetrable and the Nevada forwards were forced to content themselves

wjth shots from the center of the court.
Sagebrushers Show Fight
The Sagebrushers may be credited
with playing the cleanest basketball
exhibited by any Stanford opponent
this season. The fight put up by them
was quite creditable and the Cardinals
earned all of their markers in both
contests.
In the opening of the first game, the
Stanford squad was checked to an ex
tent by Nevada's defense and Captain
"Lefty" Rogers changed his of
fense by resorting to long shots. Here
Bob Janssen was the only one to show
up well, the tall lanky center dropping
in three goals before he was replaced
by Steele. Only a few shots were taken
by the Nevada five with no success and
the score at half time showed Stanford
to be leading 7 to 1.
A change of tactics was employed by
both teams in the second half to the
extent that both teams were able to
chalk up several field goals. Personal
fouls on the part of the Cardinal
players also added to the score of the
Sagebrushers but not enough to over
come the lead of the first half.
Janssen Stars
hi the second game, Courtwright's
five was able to obtain only two field
goals, these coming in the first half of
the contest. Bob Janssen again dupli
cated his feat of the night before by
dropping the casaba through the hoop
for six counts while Rogers, McHose,
and Oliva each contributed a basket.
The play in this game was fairl?
slow with the ball continually chang
ing hands in the middle of the floor.
Toward the end of the game. Coach
Andy Kerr began running in a string
of •substitutes, using twelve men
throughout the contest. The, follow ing

In the opening of the first game, the
Stanford squad was checked to an ex
tent by Nevada's defense and Captain
"Lefty" Rogers changed his of
fense by resorting to long shots. Here
Bob Janssen was the only one to show
up well, the tall lanky center dropping
in three goals before he was replaced
by Steele. Only a few shots were taken
by the Nevada five with no success and
the score at half time showed Stanford
to be leading 7 to 1.
A change of tactics was employed by
both teams in the second half to the
extent that both teams were able to
chalk up several field goals. Personal
fouls on the part of the Cardinal
players also added to the score of the
Sagebrushers but not enough to over
come the lead of the first half.
Janssen Stars
hi the second game, Courtwright's
five was able to obtain only two field
goals, these coming in the first half of
the contest. Bob Janssen again dupli
cated his feat of the night before by
dropping the casaba through the hoop
for six counts while Rogers, McHose,
and Oliva each contributed a basket.
The play in this game was fairl?

Playing rather ragged basketball, the Cardinal varsity quintet captured two
games from the University of Nevada team last Friday and Saturday. In the
first match, Kerr's squad won by a score of 18 to 12 while the second bout was
taken by a 17-to-10 score.
With both teams playing a strong defensive game, the floor work in both
games was slowed up to an extent. On Stanford's part, there were many
long shots that fell quite short of their mark while an occasional bad pass
ruined an opportunity for a score. The Cardinal defense was practically
impenetrable and the Nevada forwards were forced to content themselves

wjth shots from the center of the court.
