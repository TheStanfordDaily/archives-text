Common
Sense
in Car
Buying
The time when the American
people speculated in motor
cars has passed. Now cars
are bought strictly on their
investment value.
That's why Hupmobile sales
have increased so tremen
dously in this city, in this
state, and throughout the
United States.
Fourteen years of good Hup
mobiles —fourteen years of
continual development in en
gineering and in low cost pro
duction —tell you why the
Hupmobile is a great car.
The service given by the au
thorized Hupmobile dealers
listed here, is as good as the
car. Telephone the dealer
nearest you for a demonstra
tion.
