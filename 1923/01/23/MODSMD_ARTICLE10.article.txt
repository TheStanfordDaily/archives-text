# SEATS GO ON SALE FOR MASQUERS' PLAY
## "He Who Gets Slapped" Not To Be Presented in San Francisco 
### 
Seats for "He Who Gets Slapped," to be staged by Masquers' Society Friday
evening in the Assembly Hall, went on sale this afternoon at the Administra
tion building and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
Approval of the policy of Masquers' in selecting for its annual production a
serious play from the modern school of playwrights continues to be voiced
by off-campus people interested in Stanford dramatics.
Charles K. Field, '95, editor of the Sunset Magazine and a man who keeps
in touch with all Stanford affairs, has sent a telegram to Director Richard

Bentinck commending the choice of
"He Who Gets Slapped."
Field's telegram follows:
"Am glad the students are giving
"He Who Gets Slapped" and I hope
to see the performance. 1 see no
reason why Stanford's serious dra

matic effort should be limited to
classics and I like the leap into the
modern stream when the water is not
muddy.—CHARLES K. FIELD."
Among the personal notes received by
I Bentinck are those from Miss Helen
! Wesley, who took the part of Zinida, the

i lion tamer, to be played by Edvthe Bay
lis Friday evening, and from Louis Wol
heim, who is playing "Yank Smith,", the
"hairy ape," of Eugene O'Neil's drama
j of that name.
Because the San Francisco Stage Guild
is unable to secure a theater for Satur
day night, "He Who Gets Slapped" will
ibe presented only once by Masquers.
Considerable interest has been ex
pressed by members and followers of the
; Guild and plans had been made to give
the play at least once in San Francisco.
Several members of the Stage Guild
are expected to attend the performance
of Andreyev's drama, since this will be
the first time it has been produced in the
j West.
Costuming for "He Who Gets
Slapped" is in charge of Chrysella
Dunker, '22. As the cast is large and
I the individuals are members of a cir
; cus trope, there is more than usual
complexity to the problem. All cos
tumes have been ordered and are ex
pected to arrive in time for-tomorrow's
rehearsal.

Approval of the policy of Masquers' in selecting for its annual production a
serious play from the modern school of playwrights continues to be voiced
by off-campus people interested in Stanford dramatics.
Charles K. Field, '95, editor of the Sunset Magazine and a man who keeps
in touch with all Stanford affairs, has sent a telegram to Director Richard

Bentinck commending the choice of
"He Who Gets Slapped."
Field's telegram follows:
"Am glad the students are giving
"He Who Gets Slapped" and I hope
to see the performance. 1 see no
reason why Stanford's serious dra

matic effort should be limited to
classics and I like the leap into the
modern stream when the water is not
muddy.—CHARLES K. FIELD."
Among the personal notes received by
I Bentinck are those from Miss Helen
! Wesley, who took the part of Zinida, the

i lion tamer, to be played by Edvthe Bay
lis Friday evening, and from Louis Wol
heim, who is playing "Yank Smith,", the
"hairy ape," of Eugene O'Neil's drama
j of that name.
Because the San Francisco Stage Guild
is unable to secure a theater for Satur
day night, "He Who Gets Slapped" will
ibe presented only once by Masquers.
Considerable interest has been ex
pressed by members and followers of the
; Guild and plans had been made to give
the play at least once in San Francisco.
Several members of the Stage Guild
are expected to attend the performance
of Andreyev's drama, since this will be
the first time it has been produced in the
j West.
Costuming for "He Who Gets
Slapped" is in charge of Chrysella
Dunker, '22. As the cast is large and
I the individuals are members of a cir
; cus trope, there is more than usual
complexity to the problem. All cos
tumes have been ordered and are ex
pected to arrive in time for-tomorrow's
rehearsal.
