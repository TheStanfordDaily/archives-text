# CARDINAL AND SANTA CLARA QUINTETS MEET TOMORROW
## 
### 
Santa Clara will attempt to stop the
Cardinal basketball squad's string of vic
tories in a game tomorrow night on the
Pavilion court. Only two preliminary
games remain on Stanford's schedule, the
Pacific Coast Conference bouts beginning
with the U. S. C. series here on February
2 and 3.

Two veterans, Vukota and Logan, arc
playing with the Missionites this season.
Vukota distinguished himself with the
Livermore cowboy team a few years ago.
Caesar Manelli, called in the past the
"patriarch of Santa Clara athletics," and
one who has played many a game against
a Cardinal Varsity, will be missing this
year, as will Ferrario at guard.
Nothing is known of the Mission team
this year, the only measure of comparison
being their game with the University of
California, in which they were defeated
by a score of 37 to 21. Jf scores mean
anything, they should be able to put for

ward one of the best offensives shown
by any Cardinal opponent this season.
Nevada at their best were able to only
run up twelve points on the Bruin squad
with the second squad playing most of
the time for the Blue and Gold.

The showing of Bob Janssen in the
Nevada series was a bit of encourage
ment to the Stanford rooters. The tall
center is playing a better game than at
his best last season, his shooting being
a big improvement over his past records.
So far. Janssen's only trouble has been
his condition, and if he is able to round
into form by the California series, he will
be a source of much trouble to the Blue
and Gold guards.

"Nip" McHose and Captain "Lefty"
Rogers did not play up to form in the
scoring line throughout the Sagebrush
series. Rogers did good work on the de
fense, but could not contribute his usual
string of field goals in either game.
