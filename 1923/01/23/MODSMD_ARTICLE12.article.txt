# Chi Psi Defeats Sigma Nu in Third Round of Cage Contests
## 
### 
Chi Psi defeated Sigma Nu 8-5 in
one of the biggest upsets in the intra
mural basketball tournament of the
season yesterday afternoon.
Phi Kappa Sigma took its game from
Alpha Sigma Phi 10-3, Delta Tau Delta
won from Kappa Alpha 19-10, and
Sigma Chi defeated El Toro 18-10i in
the other games of the day.
Bragg's Absence Keenly Felt by
Sigma Nu When Losing to Chi Psi
The Sigma Nu team played without
the services of Bragg who was a large
factor in the scoring machine which
worked so effectively in the first two
games the team won. In the first round
of the tournament Bragg scored three
field goals against Kappa Alpha and
in the second game tallied five times
from the floor. Aydelotte. who played
well in the first game, scoring eight
field goals, was able to get only two
in the second game and, without Bragg
to feed the ball to him, was able to
tally only once last night by the field
route. Quinn made the other basket
for Sigma Nu.
At half time the score stood 5-4 for
Sigma Nll, Cook and McCandless hav
ing scored a basket each for Chi Psi.
But during the final period Sigma Nu
was unable to gather a single point
while Wilcox shot two goals from the
floor for Chi Psi. The game was close
ly contested throughout and neither
side had a safe margin over the other
at any time during the game. McCand
less played a fast, game for Chi Psi,
helping the score with a field goal

besides some clever guarding and good
floor work. Both G. Hayes and W.
Hayes played a close-guarding game,
keeping Aydelotte covered every time
lie attempted to get under the basket
for a shot.
Phi Kappa Sigma Holds Alpha
Sigma Phi at Bay and Wins 10-3
Phi Kappa Sigma lived up to form
by defeating Alpha Sigma Phi 10-3.
The Phi Kappa Sigma team won one
of its two starts by defeating the
strong Chi Psi team 15-5 but lost the
other to Delta Tau Delta by a score
of 9-8. Last night they were unable to
pile up a large score but with the aid
of four free throws and three field
goals were able to defeat the Alpha
Sigma Phi players of whom Campbell
was the only one to enter the scoring
column.
Coen was high point scorer for Phi
Kappa Sigma, making eight of the
ten points for his team in spite of
the fact that he played a guard posi
tion. His speedy floor work enabled
him to advance the ball down the floor
to the basket and yet get back to his
position to ward off any attempts of
the opposition to get to his basket,
Campbell played a consistent game
at center for Alpha Sigma Phi, having
made at least one field goal in each
of his three games. Close guarding
kept the score down and numerous
fouls called on the players of both
teams slowed up the gafaie consider
ably.
Mixon and De Back Cage Seven
Shots in Delta Tau Delta Win
Mixon and De Back were material
factors in helping Delta Tau Delta de
feat Kappa Alpha 19-10 last night.
Mixon scored three times from the
floor on running shots from his guard
position. De Back added four tallies
on passes to him under the basket.
Meyers, who broke loose several times
in the previous two games he played
in, was unable to make many shots at
the basket with De Back always under
the basket waiting for the ball.
Beeson was the outstanding player
on the Kappa Alpha team. In the first
game he played he made all the points
and in second made half of them. In
spite of his good work he has been
unable to pile up enough points by
himself to give his team a victory and
as a result Kappa Alpha lost its third
straight game last night.
The Sigma Chi aggregation out-1
classed El Toro in defeating them 18-'
10 and with a slightly greater degree
of accuracy should have doubled the j
score. However, the game was not won !
until the final whistle blew. The El
Toro players didn't know when they j
were beaten and would not admit it j
until the game was officially ended.
At half time the score stood 10-6
for Sigma Chi but El Toro fought hard
and managed to keep pace with their
opponents until the end of the final
period..Both teams had plenty of en
durance and the El Toro men espe
cially seemed to gain more speed as
the game progressed until the last few
minutes was almost a track meet up
and down the floor. With three min
utes to go three baskets would have
tied the count, but the discouraging
factor of a basket by Sigma Chi at
this juncture made the fight useless.
Boren played a racing game for El
Toro, making three shots at the hoop
good and missing a number of others
when hurried by the Sigma Chi guards.
Crever kept up a good passing game
and fed the ball to Boren but neither
of them could find the basket often

enough to tie the count.
Tremaine and Parker starred for
Sigma Chi, each making four field
goals. Parker caged two of his shots
from mid-floor after some spectacular
dribbling and snap shots at the basket.
