Bragg's Absence Keenly Felt by
Sigma Nu When Losing to Chi Psi
The Sigma Nu team played without
the services of Bragg who was a large
factor in the scoring machine which
worked so effectively in the first two
games the team won. In the first round
of the tournament Bragg scored three
field goals against Kappa Alpha and
in the second game tallied five times
from the floor. Aydelotte. who played
well in the first game, scoring eight
field goals, was able to get only two
in the second game and, without Bragg
to feed the ball to him, was able to
tally only once last night by the field
route. Quinn made the other basket
for Sigma Nu.
At half time the score stood 5-4 for
Sigma Nll, Cook and McCandless hav
ing scored a basket each for Chi Psi.
But during the final period Sigma Nu
was unable to gather a single point
while Wilcox shot two goals from the
floor for Chi Psi. The game was close
ly contested throughout and neither
side had a safe margin over the other
at any time during the game. McCand
less played a fast, game for Chi Psi,
helping the score with a field goal

besides some clever guarding and good
floor work. Both G. Hayes and W.
Hayes played a close-guarding game,
keeping Aydelotte covered every time
lie attempted to get under the basket
for a shot.
Phi Kappa Sigma Holds Alpha
Sigma Phi at Bay and Wins 10-3
Phi Kappa Sigma lived up to form
by defeating Alpha Sigma Phi 10-3.
The Phi Kappa Sigma team won one
of its two starts by defeating the
strong Chi Psi team 15-5 but lost the
other to Delta Tau Delta by a score
of 9-8. Last night they were unable to
pile up a large score but with the aid
of four free throws and three field
goals were able to defeat the Alpha
Sigma Phi players of whom Campbell
was the only one to enter the scoring
column.
Coen was high point scorer for Phi
Kappa Sigma, making eight of the
ten points for his team in spite of
the fact that he played a guard posi
tion. His speedy floor work enabled
him to advance the ball down the floor
to the basket and yet get back to his
position to ward off any attempts of
the opposition to get to his basket,
Campbell played a consistent game
at center for Alpha Sigma Phi, having
made at least one field goal in each
of his three games. Close guarding
kept the score down and numerous
fouls called on the players of both
teams slowed up the gafaie consider
ably.
