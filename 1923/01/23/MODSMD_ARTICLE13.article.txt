# Merger Effected Between Cardinal, Pictorial Staffs
## 
### 
Consolidation of the Stanford Cardi
nal, the English Club publication, and
the Stanford Pictorial, issued by the
Press Club, into one magazine to be pub
ished monthly by both organizations, was
completed last evening when the con
tract agreement was signed by repre- 1
sentatives of the clubs. Announcement
of the consolidation is contained in the
January issue of the Cardinal, on sale i
today.
According to the terms of the agree
ment, the new magazine, as yet unnamed,
will be issued by a staff composed of
both English and Press club members. l
The editor for the magazine will be •
chosen by the staff, which met last even
ing for the first time.
English Club representatives on the
staff are: Molly Windish, Robert Binck-i
ley, Milton Rosenfield, Harold Davis, and
Elizabeth Spilman. The Press Club will
be represented by Harry Borba, editor of
Pictorial; Paul Clyde, Tom Irwin, Phil
Newill, and Kenneth Stewart!
The primary reason for the merger of
the two is financial, according to the
Cardinal announcement. The advertising
field is overcrowded, the article states;
every year has brought financial difficul-j
ties to at least one student publication.
From the editorial field, too, the field was ■
overcrowded, and it is hoped that the
standard of literary contributions pub- 1
lished will be considerably raised by the
cutting down of space to be filled.
The Cardinal has been a purely literary i
magazine, publishing poetry, fiction, and.
essays; while the Pictorial has been a
"student magazine of opinion," featuring
articles on local conditions and institu
tions, athletic reviews, and so on. Both
fields will be combined in the new maga- i
zine.
