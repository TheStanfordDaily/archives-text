"Journalism is one of the agencies
| through which we are going to recon
| struct the American Nation in coming
years. In journalism you can do a work
| that you can do in no other profession
i if you bring to the American people a
I new inspiration and something of en
couragement to help them on their way,"
was the message given by Dr. Rufus von
KlcinSmid, speaking to the members of
the American Journalists' Association last
night. A dinner was given in his honor
by Professor and Mrs. Everett Smith, at
| which the members of the association
! were guests.
"The ideals of our democracy and a
realization of the value of our American
I institutions will come from the press. At
present after reading the papers we have
a bad taste in our mouths and a bad
atmosphere of thought that leaves us on
the lower levels of human reaction. Edi
torials tell us in pessimistic fashion that
things aren't as they ought to be, but
what we need is somebody to tell us how
to make them as they ought to be. This
i is the American prophet of today, and I
hope his name is Legion," continued Dr.
von KlcinSmid.
Dr. von KlcinSmid said that the young
people of today when choosing a pro
| fession always consider what they are
going to get out of it instead of what
they are going to bring to that profession
in order to build it up beyond its ability
to serve today. No one has any business
' to go into a profession unless lie can con
i tribute something to its betterment.
"There is nothing quite so important
in the life of our great Nation today as
the public press, and an opportunity pre
-1 sents itself to us to mold the life of
j the American people."
