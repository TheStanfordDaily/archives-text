# THE 						COMBUSTION POINT
## 
### 
The time of the college year is approaching when
in the absence of fall sports and many other distract
ing elements which influence the daily life of under
graduates certain students turn their eyes toward the
freshman problem. Some look to see what may be
done to improve the lot of the freshman, to help him
along. Others, and many of them, look to see what
may be done for their own amusement. And still
others, the bystanders, take neither negative nor posi
tive action, merely waiting to see which way the wind
is blowing.
For that class of undergraduates which seeks in
formation as to the direction of the air currents, we
need only refer to a resolution adopted by the Sopho
more Class early last fall, in which it was specifically
stated that freshman discipline, as applied by second
year men, would not be tolerated. So far as has been
possible, considering the fact that such a body as a
college class is a difficult group to control, this reso
lution has been effective. At worst iits intentions
were excellent and at best its execution and effect
have been highly commendable.

But now that the average undergraduate's atten
tion has been removed from the close application to
football and to fall activities, the tendency to go in
for intramural tubbing is likely to crop up. The real
test of the resolution adopted by the Sophomore
Class may now be made. If it may be said at the
end of this year that the resolution has enjoyed fair
success, then it will be the duty of the Freshman
Class to take over this responsibility for next year
and to enlarge and improve upon the original scheme.
If it is not a success, then it will be the duty of the
Freshman Class to take such measures as seem logi
cal to guarantee against another failure. Meanwhile,
the upperclassmen might well spend their time in de
vising means for a system which will take the place
of hazing—one which will accomplish the desired
purposes and at the same time be devoid of unde
sirable features.
