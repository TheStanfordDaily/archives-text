# A 						NEW THOUGHT

### 
President von KleinSmid left a thought with those
who attended the meeting of a group of people in
terested in local journalism last nightâ€”a thought
that might well be passed on. In speaking of the
predominance of crime reports in metropolitan jour
nals, Dr. von KleinSmid remarked that the "loss of
eleven million older brothers, fathers, and husbands
during the war'' was good reason for the increase of
crime in the world. Many knew before that crime
had increased, but few knew why. Those who have
given the matter thought agree that this is a new
and interesting light on the subject.
