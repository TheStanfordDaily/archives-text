# THE 						LAST CARDINAL
## 
### 
The last issue of the Stanford Cardinal appeared
on the campus today. Tn it dies the distinctively lit
erary post-war magazine and with it the Sequoia
and such parts of it as have been retained from sev
eral years ago become Stanford publication history.
The campus cannot but regard the passing of the
Cardinal with regret. But it is to be remembered
that with the Cardinal, the Pictorial also is passing
into magazine heaven. It now remains for the staffs
of the two magazines to co-operate under the pro
posed merger and to build on the ruins of compe
tition and past mistakes a Stanford publication that
will be read with interest by all undergraduates, that
will appeal to alumni, faculty, and high school stu
dents, that will relieve the advertising field, and that
will contain no "filler." Upon the spirit shown by
Press Club and English Club largely depend the
future of the new magazine and the trend of Stanford
journalism.
