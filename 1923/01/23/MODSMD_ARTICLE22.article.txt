MAH JONGG vs. PAH JONGG
(Three Rounds to a Decision)
Round One —Mah Jongg slips from corner while Pah
Jongg is already on the floor bamboozling the referee.
Mah Jongg pungs him in the chow. Pah Jongg discards.
On the count of nine Pah Jongg bounces off back wall,
loosens a tile, and throws it with irrelevancy through
skylight, holing out in one. East wind breaks in at
broken skylight, blows out Mah Jongg. Referee starts
to count him out. On count of seven referee knocks off
for chow, but recovers and runs twenty yards for over
coat. Time, 2 flat, 1 pays double.
ROUND TWO
Both advance center stage, swing nasty left and right
bowers to head. Referee forgets to draw; is left out of
picture. Both decide to arbitrate.
Pah Jongg: Pung?
Mah Jongg: Ning po chin king chi li hong kong fu
chu!
Pah Jongg: Well, chow, then.
Mah Jongg: Kung.
Pah Jongg: I did.
Referee (triumphant): MAH JONGG!
Mah Jongg: What?
Referee: This chocolate ain't hot.
Pah Jongg: No, it's peppermint.
Both: What, no soap?
Neither: Foul!
Gong: Clang.
THIRD ROUND—ON THE HOUSE
Bell rings. After the toss-up, Mah Jongg goes to
answer it. Time out while referee stacks the deck. Pah
Jongg stokes the hold. Mah Jongg dopes the dice. After
a sharp exchange of blows, North wind and South wind
crash East wall and bring down the house. Pah Jongg
wins by a lockout.
Referee: Hey!
Pah Jongg: Huh?
Referee: What happened?

The Egyptologist and the Crocodile
An Egyptologist sat in a vat
And mourned, and mourned, and mourned.
A crocodile sat on a bank below
Shedding crocodile tears in a steady flow;
He wept when he saw that a man could grow
So corned. And corned. And corned.
The Egyptologist felt of his belt,
And groaned, and groaned, and groaned.
The crocodile could not endure this long,
So asked him politely what had gone wrong.
The scientist harshly replied v Get along!"
And moaned, and moaned, and moaned.
v
The Egyptologist dried up his eyes
And boiled! and boiled! and boiled!
The crocodile quite neglected his date
As he heard the scientist fiercely relate
The -tale of the cans that were opened too late
And spoiled, and spoiled, and spoiled.
"As Egyptologists all make their haul,
I thought, and thought, and thought,
That the tomb of Hotapek Atah the Third
(he said, and the crocodile eagerly heard)
Would be filled with the shekels by bushel and herd
I sought—and sought—and sought."
V
The Egyptologist sat in his vat
And mourned, and mourned, and mourned,
"I discovered no shekels, found only corn beef
(said he) "which I ate and began all my grief;
I found they were cans that Egypt's great chief
Had corned. But corned when corned.
