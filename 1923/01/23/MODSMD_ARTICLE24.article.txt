New players have made the Stanford
varsity baseball team a formidable
looking aggregation this season. The
main reason for defeats in the last few
years and for a decided lack of pep on
the part of the varsity men, has been
the lack of competition for positions.
This year there are at least two men
for each of the nine berths and the
coach is going to give every candidate
a fair chance.
This is the tale of a wandering let
ter or rather a plebian bill which
started on November 27 from the gro
cery store of Fuller and Company in
Palo Alto, and strolled into the Daily
Palo Alto office this morning after a
journey of over 4000 miles. It was still
looking for C. E. Hobbs, '19, on ac
count of $2.60 due the company by
the class of 1919. It is suggested that
a delegation of sophomores call and
receive the treasured bill.
Rumor has it that Art Wilcox is a
baseball catcher of considerable abil
ity. If this is the case, he can be used
easily on the Stanford varsity.
David P. Barrows, dean of the U.
C. faculties, has qualified in the recent
army examination at Fort Monroe and
will be given a commission as major
in the officers' reserve corps. Dr. Bar
rows spoke at Stanford last semester
on his return from Belgium.
