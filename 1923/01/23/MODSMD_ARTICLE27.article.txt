# U.S.C. LOOKS FORWARD TO BOXING SEASON
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA—
With basketball looking a bit sad, the
most popular item of the sport sea
son this year will in all probability be
boxing. Two students at the university
will handle the team, and the new
material which has so far shown up is
causing them great glee. It is expected
that the champions from last year will
have to use plenty of steam in order to
hold their berths.
"Cyclone" Fairbanks, intercollegiate
champion of two years ago, will head
the 145-pounders and Harold Galloway,
the dusky 135-pound representative,
will be remembered from last year.
