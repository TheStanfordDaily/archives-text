A San Francisco correspondent was
heard to remark in the Press box dur
ing the Nevada game Friday night, "If
Fred Anderson is not an All-Coast guard
this year, I would like to see the selec
tions." Anderson's work so far this sea
son has justified the remark. He has
been invaluable on the defense and of
fense and is helping the fans to forget
the loss of Dich Richmond.
