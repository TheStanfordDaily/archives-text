Janssen and Steele have been drawing
most of the assignments to the center
position. "Bob" has the edge with his
experience and a better eye for the bas
ket. The team seems to run better with
him at ccnter, but so far he has been
unable to go the full distance. Steele
is a corner and one of the hardest fighters
on the squad.
