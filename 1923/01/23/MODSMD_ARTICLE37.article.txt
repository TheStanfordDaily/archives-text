goggle-eyed juniors stopped in transit to

Hurt Lapp took fourteen rustic sopho
more tryoutees for positions as assistant
yell leaders through the fundamental
rudiments of cheer leading last night in
Encina Gymnasium. The exercise was
quite strenuous and, as one remarked
afterward, "I exercised more there in
fifteen minutes than I did all last week
in the gym."
