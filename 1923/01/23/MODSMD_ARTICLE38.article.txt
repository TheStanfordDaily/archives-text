# COLLEGIENNES FORCE WAY INTO COLLEGE BARBER SHOP
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
The sanctum sanctorium is invaded,
the holy of holies is holy no longer,
the once famed exchange for raw-ther
good stories is gone. The bold co-ed
has invaded the refuge—the he-male
barber shop is no more.
Two adventurous California maidens
recently bought a "bob" in the barber
shop in Stephens hall at the univer
sity. Reporters came in bunches, but
the barbers kept on clipping. What a
boon! Imagine the lowly snake invit
ing his beloved Into the luxurious
depths of a barber chair to have her
snow-white neck shaved, the while in
dulging in a stream of small talk
through the lather, in the next chair.
Next!
