# CONCRETE WORK ON TOYON AND ENCINA NEARLY FINISHED
## 
### 
Two of the new University building
projects, the Encina dining hall and
Toyon hall, have now reached that stage
of the construction where something of
their appearance when completed can be
discerned.
All of the reinforced concrete work in
the Encina dining hall, save the floors,
has been poured. The base of the ar
cades is being faced with stone from the
•old gymnasium, which was destroyed in
the earthquake of 1906.
The rest of the arcades and the ex
terior of the dining hall proper will be
surfaced with plaster, like that on the
Union, which will blend with the color
of the stone in Encina.
The ceilings of the dining hall and the
roofs of the arcades will be beamed, and
the redwood trusses have been built and
are being put into place. The interior
will be wainscoted to a height of about
four feet with brick or oak panels. Above
this will be plaster. The kitchen equip
ment will be of the most modern type.
The contract for it has been let to a San
Francisco firm.
At Toyon the first and second floors
have been poured and the forms for the
second floor walls are in place. This,
•when poured, will complete the concrete
work on the wings. The center, how
ever, will be three stories high. There
will be access to the towers on Toyon,
unlike those on the Union. Both Toyon
and the Board of Athletic Control dormi
tory. of which the foundations have been
completed, will be finished with plaster
of a color to match Encina.
The raw material for the concrete,
and finally the concrete itself, is handled
with the utmost efficiency throughout.
One interesting feat is the pouring of a
concrete circular staircase to the second
floor of Toyon. A concrete core was
first cast and the staircase was in turn
built around this. Artificial stone col
umns and capitals are being manufac
tured on the spot daily. They are cast
in plaster of paris forms which have the
stone cutter's tool marks already made.
The damp sand and concrete of the
proper color is tamped down about a
metal core which is later withdrawn and
replaced with reinforced concrete.
