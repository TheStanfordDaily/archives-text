# Women's Organizations Will Bring Vocational Speakers to Stanford
## 
### 
A Vocational Conference for women
is being planned for the second week
of April, under the management of a
joint committee.
The purpose of the conference is to
bring to the campus speakers who will
present practical applications to the
vocations in which women are most
interested. The success of the plan de
pends on the full cooperation of the
women on the campus, first, in think
ing over the matter and deciding on
the vocation in which they are espe
cially interested, and second, in at
tending the conference itself and the
preliminary conferences to be held
during February and early March.
These preliminary conferences are
to consist of a presentation of the
work of the departments in the Uni
versity in which women are interested,
with reference to the particular voca
tion to which the work can be applied.
Members of the various departments
will speak.
