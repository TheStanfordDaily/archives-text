# BASKETBALL AT U.S.C. GETS BAD SET-BACK
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIAâ€”Coaches at the Univer
sity of Southern California seem to
model their optimism upon "Gloomy
Gus" Henderson. When Charlie Bone,
star guard of the Trojan quintet,
snapped two small bones in his ankle
during practice the other day, Coach
Les Turner turned as white as the
injured player and remarked, "We
didn't a whole lot of chance in
basketball this year, but with my star
guard out of the game we ought to
begin looking for a soft place to land
in the Pacific Coast Conference sched
ule." Bone's position will be taken by
Gordon Campbell.
