### 
An exhibition of work done by the 1
Navajo and Hopi Indians is now on dis- !
play at the Stanford Art Gallery. In
cluded in this exhibition are a collection'
of sketches and paintings showing the;
picturesque Indian country and the In -1
dians themselves. These pictures are the
work of Theodore Wores, James Swin-j
nerton and Pedro J. Lemos.
Interesting features of this display are
the woven ceremonial plaques, done in a
seemingly endless variety of well-planned
designs. These, as well as the blankets,.
jewelry, and ceremonial dolls, are part j
of a unique collection belonging to Mr.;
and Mrs. Swinnerton. The jewelry rep
resents some of the finest specimens of
Indian craftsmanship.
The pottery shown was obtained by j
Mr. Lemos during his trip last summer
through the Navajo country. In this
group will be found the Rain God, an im
portant deity in a" land where much de
pends on the crops and the rainfall. "A;
Rain God Maker" is well depicted in one
of Mr. Lemos' sketches, showing an In
dian potter busy at work making the
little images. The paintings by Mr.
Wores, who is a recognized leader in por
traiture. show various types of Indian |
life, and are exceptionally well handled.!
"To some people." says Mr. Lemos, di-j
rector of the gallery, "on first acquaint- j
ance, this primitive type of art may seem
crude and lacking in the attributes nec
essary for beauty. A more careful study
reveals a fine sense of composition, har
mony, balance, rythm, color, and every
thing necessary for good design.
"The craftsmanship of the designs in
the weavings, carvings, silversmithing is
expressive of the Indian's joy in his work,
which is the true condition necessary for
an artistic production."
The exhibition will continue for one
month. The gallery is open to the public
daily, without charge, from 10 to 5
o'clock.
