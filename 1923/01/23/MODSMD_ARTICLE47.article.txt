# Skull and Snakes, Cap and Gown to Dine at Roth Home
## 
### 
Comptroller and Mrs. A. E. Roth
will entertain the members of Cap
and Gown and Skull and Snakes at
dinner in their home this evening. Mrs.
Roth is a member of Cap and Gown
and Mr. Roth took active part in Skull
and Snakes activities when he was in
the University, so they are making
this dinner a sort of "get-together" of
these two representative Stanford so
cieties.
