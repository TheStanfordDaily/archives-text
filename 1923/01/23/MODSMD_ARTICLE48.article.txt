# Maloney Puts Boxers and Wrestlers Through Paces For Davis Farm Tourney
## 
### 
j
, Harry Maloney is putting his boxing
and wrestling proteges through their
final paces in preparation for the boxing
and wrestling meet with the Davis Farm
j fighters and grapplers, which will be held
jnext Saturday at Davis.. A return match
I will be held at Stanford on February 27.
■ The men to make the trip have not been
j definitely decided upon as yet, but Coach
Hosepian expects to pick the wrestlers
on Thursday and Maloney and Jimmie
Ross will decide definitely upon the
| boxers tomorrow. Yesterday Maloney
! put the boxers through full-time three
i round bouts in preparation for Satur
! day night. Hosepian put the wrestlers
j through a light workout also.
All weights will be represented in the
Stanford team. Seven boxers and either
five or seven wrestlers will make the trip.
The boxers who have the best chance of
going at present are: 115-pound class,
Hard; 125-pound class, Paine; 135-pound
class. Hall; 145-pound class, Adams; 158-
pound class, Irwin; 175-pound class, Mc-
Kee; heavy-weight class, Van Hook.
Maloney will not use the two experienced
boxers, Ross and Lane, in the Davis
matches, as he is ging to give an oppor
| tunity for the new men to show their
| wares. Ross and Lane will be two of the
i mainstays in the California meet, he said
yesterday. All of the men named are
new at the game and it will take a regl
bout to give an idea of what they are
capable of doing. Van Hook weighs only
169 pounds, which puts him in the 175-
pound class, but Maloney considers him
good enough to go in with the heavy
weights.
Among the wrestlers in the heavy
weight class, Fullerton seems to have the
best chance. Three men are fighting it
out in the 175-pound class. They are
Brown, Whitney, and Doughty. None of
these men have had past experience, but
all are showing up good. With a little
more experience. Doughty will make a
valuable man. Woodhead is the best bet
in the 158-pound class. He is new at
wrestling at Stanford, but has had a lot
of experience before coming here.
The 145-pounders seem to be about the
j weakest. Becker was going good but he
! hurt his knee last quarter and is not out
:at present. Gage is the probable choice.
Sievers and Quinn are best in the 135-
| pound class. Both are of about the same
: caliber and the one who shows up best
in the next few days will be taken to
; Davis. Pallett look good in the 125-
pound division. He is a soph, but has
! shown up exceptionally well this year
j and appears almost certain of represent
ing his weight. Ballow, a new man, also
| looks good.
Sturm, a varsity wrestler for two years,
will represent the 115-pound class. He
was good last year, but according to
i Hosepian, is going better than ever this
| season.

! put the boxers through full-time three
i round bouts in preparation for Satur
! day night. Hosepian put the wrestlers
j through a light workout also.
All weights will be represented in the
Stanford team. Seven boxers and either
five or seven wrestlers will make the trip.
The boxers who have the best chance of
going at present are: 115-pound class,
Hard; 125-pound class, Paine; 135-pound
class. Hall; 145-pound class, Adams; 158-
pound class, Irwin; 175-pound class, Mc-
Kee; heavy-weight class, Van Hook.
Maloney will not use the two experienced
boxers, Ross and Lane, in the Davis
matches, as he is ging to give an oppor
| tunity for the new men to show their
| wares. Ross and Lane will be two of the
i mainstays in the California meet, he said
yesterday. All of the men named are
new at the game and it will take a regl
bout to give an idea of what they are
capable of doing. Van Hook weighs only
169 pounds, which puts him in the 175-
pound class, but Maloney considers him
good enough to go in with the heavy
weights.
Among the wrestlers in the heavy
weight class, Fullerton seems to have the
best chance. Three men are fighting it
out in the 175-pound class. They are
Brown, Whitney, and Doughty. None of
these men have had past experience, but
all are showing up good. With a little
more experience. Doughty will make a
valuable man. Woodhead is the best bet
in the 158-pound class. He is new at
wrestling at Stanford, but has had a lot
of experience before coming here.
The 145-pounders seem to be about the
j weakest. Becker was going good but he
! hurt his knee last quarter and is not out
:at present. Gage is the probable choice.
Sievers and Quinn are best in the 135-
| pound class. Both are of about the same
: caliber and the one who shows up best
in the next few days will be taken to
; Davis. Pallett look good in the 125-
pound division. He is a soph, but has
! shown up exceptionally well this year
j and appears almost certain of represent
ing his weight. Ballow, a new man, also
| looks good.
Sturm, a varsity wrestler for two years,
will represent the 115-pound class. He
was good last year, but according to
i Hosepian, is going better than ever this
| season.
j
, Harry Maloney is putting his boxing
and wrestling proteges through their
final paces in preparation for the boxing
and wrestling meet with the Davis Farm
j fighters and grapplers, which will be held
jnext Saturday at Davis.. A return match
I will be held at Stanford on February 27.
■ The men to make the trip have not been
j definitely decided upon as yet, but Coach
Hosepian expects to pick the wrestlers
on Thursday and Maloney and Jimmie
Ross will decide definitely upon the
