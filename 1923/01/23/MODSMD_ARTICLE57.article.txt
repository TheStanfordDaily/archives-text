### 
The first Lens and Plate lecture 011 the
A, B, C of Photography, which was not
held last Tuesday on account of the bas
ketball game, will be held tonight in the
dark room at 7:15. This lecture will be
for members only.
The talk will be on the care and chem
istry of the dark room, and will be ao
companied by demonstrations. It will
deal with the mixing and use of develop
ing, printing, toning, and intensifying so
lutions, and with the care of dark-room
equipment. As it is necessary to give the
lecture in the dark room, limited space
makes an open meeting impossible. Ken
neth Ritchie, '21, president of the society,
and a graduate student in chemistry, is
giving the series.
