This record becomes all the more remarkable when it is realized that THE JC
DIAL is not exclusively a fiction magazine. Short stories form but a part *
of the material in each issue. The poetry, essays, criticism, and reproduC' Nj
tions of the fine arts published by THE DIAL are equally distinctive. The K
editorial policy of THE DIAL is directed towards achieving distinction in
all lines. THE DIAL'S better known contributors include the most dis- W
tinguished writers of Europe and America. A new name will shortly be
added to this notable list of contributors—
Gerhart Hauptmann jS
whose latest novel will be published in the spring issues of THE DIAL.
