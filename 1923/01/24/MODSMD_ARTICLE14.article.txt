# SPIRIT OF "HE WHO GETS SLAPPED" MELODRAMATIC
## 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
Melodrama —that one word charac
terizes, as near as any one word can,
the nature of the play to be given by
Masquers Friday night. It is, how
ever, melodrama without the heavy
doses of "hokum" that used to make —
and still make —the "ten-twent'-thirt' "
shows such flat failures in that re
spect.
"He Who Gets Slapped,'* set in the
circus atmosphere, with colorful cos
tumes, beautiful girls, and the gaudy
trappings of the sawdust ring, has its
contrasts of sombre tone, which are in
turn relieved by many light scenes be
tween the clowns and other perform
ers. Director Richard Bentinck is
more enthusiastic over the play itself
and the rehearsals, as they have gone
so far, than he has been over any
previous campus production since he
took over the dramatic reins. Re
garding the nature of the plot, lie says,
"It contains passages which are unex
celled as examples of the art of play
writing. It is famous for its gripping
qualities—it holds all who see or read
it, due to the skill of the author and
the humaness of the play."
As a result of the intense interest
aroused in San Francisco by the stag
ing of this production for Jhe first
time on the Pacific Coast, "He Who

I Gets Slapped" will be read at Paul
I Elder's bookshop next Saturday. So
many San Franciscans who will not
be able to see the play for some time
to come have urged a reading of the
plot that Elder deemed it advisable
to have an open reading Saturday to
give a large number a chance to get
acquainted with Andreyev's novel style
and melodramatic force.
It is Andreyev's unusual style that
has attracted the most favorable at
tention. This play is a typical example
of the Russian production that has late
ly been taken up by Eastern theaters.
"Chauve Souris," under Serge Baileff,
I of the Moscow Art Theater, has re
cently been imported to New York by
Morris Gest, who is well-known for
his skill at choosing plays the general
public will appreciate. Other offerings
of a similar nature are given the east
ern theatergoers.
All four acts of "He Who Gets
Slapped" will be put together this eve
ning for the first time, when the ini
tial dress rehearsal will be held. The
final rehearsal, in full costume and
make-up. will be staged tomorrow eve
ning. Up until now, in order that those
cast members appearing in but one or
two acts might not be kept any longer
than necessary, the acts have not been
rehearsed in order.

ever, melodrama without the heavy
doses of "hokum" that used to make —
and still make —the "ten-twent'-thirt' "
shows such flat failures in that re
spect.
"He Who Gets Slapped,'* set in the
circus atmosphere, with colorful cos
tumes, beautiful girls, and the gaudy
trappings of the sawdust ring, has its
contrasts of sombre tone, which are in
turn relieved by many light scenes be
tween the clowns and other perform
ers. Director Richard Bentinck is
more enthusiastic over the play itself
and the rehearsals, as they have gone
so far, than he has been over any
previous campus production since he
took over the dramatic reins. Re
garding the nature of the plot, lie says,
"It contains passages which are unex
celled as examples of the art of play
writing. It is famous for its gripping
qualities—it holds all who see or read
it, due to the skill of the author and
the humaness of the play."
As a result of the intense interest
aroused in San Francisco by the stag
ing of this production for Jhe first
time on the Pacific Coast, "He Who

I Gets Slapped" will be read at Paul
I Elder's bookshop next Saturday. So
many San Franciscans who will not
be able to see the play for some time
to come have urged a reading of the
plot that Elder deemed it advisable
to have an open reading Saturday to
give a large number a chance to get
acquainted with Andreyev's novel style
and melodramatic force.
It is Andreyev's unusual style that
has attracted the most favorable at
tention. This play is a typical example
of the Russian production that has late
ly been taken up by Eastern theaters.
"Chauve Souris," under Serge Baileff,
I of the Moscow Art Theater, has re
cently been imported to New York by
Morris Gest, who is well-known for
his skill at choosing plays the general
public will appreciate. Other offerings
of a similar nature are given the east
ern theatergoers.
All four acts of "He Who Gets
Slapped" will be put together this eve
ning for the first time, when the ini
tial dress rehearsal will be held. The
final rehearsal, in full costume and
make-up. will be staged tomorrow eve
ning. Up until now, in order that those
cast members appearing in but one or
two acts might not be kept any longer
than necessary, the acts have not been
rehearsed in order.
Melodrama —that one word charac
terizes, as near as any one word can,
the nature of the play to be given by
Masquers Friday night. It is, how
ever, melodrama without the heavy
doses of "hokum" that used to make —
and still make —the "ten-twent'-thirt' "
shows such flat failures in that re
spect.
