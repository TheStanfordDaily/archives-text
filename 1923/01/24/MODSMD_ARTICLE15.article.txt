##

Editorial and managerial tryoutees for
the 1925 Quad had a "seven-to-eight" in
the Delta Delta Delta house last night.
I he purpose of the gathering, which was
sponsored by Carl Shoup and Charles
White, editor and manager, respectively
of the 1924 Quad, was to get the tryoutees |
on the two branches of the organization
acquainted with each other, since they
do not meet on duty, the editor and man- 1
ager forming laison between them.
After 8 o'clock several speakers from
outside the staff addressed the tryoutees.
Helen Whitney, chairman of the Quad;
board, and Junior Collins, president of
the Junior Class, told what they knew
of the progress the 1924 Quad was mak- i
ing. Phil Landis, president of the A. S.
S. U., and W. R. Gage, president of the
Advertising Club, spoke on the qualifi
cations and ideals the manager and edi-1
tor of a year book should have. Ross
Fisher, editor of the 1922 Quad, gave
some good advice from his experience,
and Alumni Secretary J. E. McDowell,
who is also manager of the Illustrated
Review, finished up with some reminis
cences of Quads and periodicals of the \
past.
