# FRESHMEN WILL MEET PIEDMONT QUINTET THIS EVENING
## 
### 
The Cardinal freshman quintet meets
Piedmont High School tonight in the
Pavilion in the final preliminary game
before the first battle of the California
series Saturday night.
Tonight's game will give Hunt his last
chance to see his squad in action before
the beginning of the three-game series
with the Blue and Gold Cubs. The Babes
have gone through a successful year,
having met defeat but once early in the
season at the hands of the fast San Jose
High School aggregation.
The steady improvement they have
shown seems to indicate that instead of
being a setup for the Bruin babes they
will have an even chance of winning if
they play the brand of basketball they
have exhibited lately.
Hunt's team has been a powerful de
fensive machine since the first game
against Fremont High School, but it was
not until after the defeat by San Jose
High School that the yearling forwards
began to find the basket. In the Lowell
game, three days after the San Jose
scuffle, they showed a reversal of form
and have been playing better basketball
since.
The game tonight will probably give
Hunt a chance to pick his line-up for Sat
urday night. There seems to be but one
position on the squad where there is any
doubt as to the best man. Carter and
Morrison have been dividing the work
at center and both will undoubtedly see
action some time during the series. There
is still a question as to which will start
the first game.
On the basis of work early in the sea
son, Morrison has the edge. His floor
work was better and he was surer of
his shots for the basket than Carter. Since
Morrison hurt his ankle in the Lowell
game. Carter has stepped in and played
almost all of every game and has shown
great improvement. Their work tonight
may decide which will be in the center of
the court when the whistle opens the
series.
The Piedmont game will be the pre
liminary to the Stanford Var.sity-Santa
Clara game, and will begin at 7 o'clock.
