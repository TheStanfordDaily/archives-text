# VARSITY QUINTET PLAYS FRIARS TONIGHT
## Joe "Sneeze" Aurreocochea Has Strong Offensive Squad To Combat Stanford Five 
### 
Coach Joe "Sneeze" Aurreocochea
will send the best that Santa Clara
has to offer against the Stanford Var
sity tonight in an effort to wipe out
the defeat handed the Missionites by
the Blue and Gold squad last Satur
day. Last year in the opening game of
the season, the Santa Clara quintet
sprang a surprise on the Cardinals and
all but won the bout, the final score
being 23 to 22.
Captain Johnnie Logan, who hurt his
ankle in the California contest Satur
day, is said to be all right now and
Aurreocochea will be able to have his
regular lineup working against Kerr's
five. John Vukota, the ex-cowboy from
Livermore and incidentally the man
whose dribbling and shooting caused
the 1922 varsity so much trouble, will
start the game at forward. Vukota
with Johnnie Logan at center form the
nucleus of the Santa Clara offense.
Logan's brother Jimmy has also been
showing up well this year and will be
used at forward in tonight's match.
In the guarding department, Aurreo
cochea is playing new men this year.
Toso at running guard is a dangerous
man within shooting distance of the
basket but has been troubled with a
bum leg lately and may not appear
against the Cardinals. In case he is
not used, Malley will play in his place.
"Moose" Fawke of football fame will
start for Aurreocochea's squad at the
other guard position.
Santa Clara's strong point is of
fensive while Stanford boasts a strong
defense. This does not nepessarily
mean that either team is lacking in
the other department of play. So far,
however, the Cardinal squad has
shown little in the way of offense with
the exception of the individual work
of one or two players. Kerr has been
working chiefly on offense during the
past two weeks and the results Fhould
show in the Santa Clara game.
In tonight's game, Kerr will send
his regular lineup against the Misson
team, Rogers and McHose playing at
forward with Oliva and Anderson tak
ing care of the guarding end. Bob
Janssen will be in his regular job at
center. Oliva hurt his leg in the see
ing on the bench most of the time in
ing on hte bench most of the time in
practice this week but will be able to
be in the fight tonight.
