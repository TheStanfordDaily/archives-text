# THE 						COMMON MOLD
## 
### 
Each year large numbers of freshmen enter Stan
ford at a receptive time of life. They may be gullible,
unsophisticated, "sissy," selfish, self-important, or
the reverse of any or all of these. They may be well
in a particular direction of growth. They may have
ideas and ideals of their own. But after all, they
are freshmen and as such are sensistive to the touch
of every hand. They will react in accordance with
the agencies with which they come in contact, and
with the principles to which these agencies adhere!
If these agencies, in purpose and execution, are
fundamentally sound, then the results may be de
sirable. The reverse of this is an obvious conclusion.
What makes Stanford a distinctive institution?
Obviously the production of men with the Stanford
type of mind. How are such men made? Largely
through environment, association with men made
and in the making, and through exchange of thought
and performance of deed.
Now enters the question, are all Stanford men
alike? Stanford is known as the source of a type
of men who are like nobody else —men with individu
ality, initiative, leadership, originality, force, and
strength of character. A Stanford man is not called
one because he was a member of the Stanford student
body, but because in the course of his years as a
member of that group he was given opportunity to
develop personality—to be himself.
Stanford has done much in the past by sending
great minds into the outside w'orld—each produced
in a period of three years. Why not produce a fourth
more or else make the same number a fourth more
valuable by increasing this period of development
to four years? By this it is meant that during the
freshman year at Stanford there is no intellectual
growth. The freshman is halted on the threshold of
the University and is held there by tradition until
he becomes a sophomore. At that point he begins to
function as an active undergraduate. Every fresh
man must pass through a common mold before he
may be placed on a plane of comparative equality
with the rest of the student body. He must mark
time for a full year because it is the custom for fresh
men to do so before he may enter upon his too-short
period of mental expansion.
The University loses every year one-fourth of its
potential power because its students deprive each
new class of the privilege of individual action. The
process of development is deferred one year for no
other reason than that first laid down—that in order
lo qualify as a Stanford man each candidate must
pass through the community mold bearing the stamp
of traditional standardization. Later, we learn that
it was not standardization that developed our best
alumni, but the remaining influences and
most remotely removed from that menace to individ
uality. Personality, ability to think, qualities of
leadership arc born not of conformity to standard,
but of development of self through selective associ
ations. Where then lies the justification for fresh
men discipline, particularly when extended over a
quarter of a college career?

and performance of deed.
Now enters the question, are all Stanford men
alike? Stanford is known as the source of a type
of men who are like nobody else —men with individu
ality, initiative, leadership, originality, force, and
strength of character. A Stanford man is not called
one because he was a member of the Stanford student
body, but because in the course of his years as a
member of that group he was given opportunity to
develop personality—to be himself.
Stanford has done much in the past by sending
great minds into the outside w'orld—each produced
in a period of three years. Why not produce a fourth
more or else make the same number a fourth more
valuable by increasing this period of development
to four years? By this it is meant that during the
freshman year at Stanford there is no intellectual
growth. The freshman is halted on the threshold of
the University and is held there by tradition until
he becomes a sophomore. At that point he begins to
function as an active undergraduate. Every fresh
man must pass through a common mold before he
may be placed on a plane of comparative equality
with the rest of the student body. He must mark
time for a full year because it is the custom for fresh
men to do so before he may enter upon his too-short
period of mental expansion.
The University loses every year one-fourth of its
potential power because its students deprive each
new class of the privilege of individual action. The
process of development is deferred one year for no
other reason than that first laid down—that in order
lo qualify as a Stanford man each candidate must
pass through the community mold bearing the stamp
of traditional standardization. Later, we learn that
it was not standardization that developed our best
alumni, but the remaining influences and
most remotely removed from that menace to individ
uality. Personality, ability to think, qualities of
leadership arc born not of conformity to standard,
but of development of self through selective associ
ations. Where then lies the justification for fresh
men discipline, particularly when extended over a
quarter of a college career?
Each year large numbers of freshmen enter Stan
ford at a receptive time of life. They may be gullible,
unsophisticated, "sissy," selfish, self-important, or
the reverse of any or all of these. They may be well
in a particular direction of growth. They may have
ideas and ideals of their own. But after all, they
are freshmen and as such are sensistive to the touch
of every hand. They will react in accordance with
the agencies with which they come in contact, and
with the principles to which these agencies adhere!
If these agencies, in purpose and execution, are
fundamentally sound, then the results may be de
sirable. The reverse of this is an obvious conclusion.
What makes Stanford a distinctive institution?
Obviously the production of men with the Stanford
type of mind. How are such men made? Largely
through environment, association with men made
and in the making, and through exchange of thought
and performance of deed.
