# IMMEDIATE ACTION

### 
Tt is typically Stanford to decide that something is
to he done and then to do it without incessant debate
and pow-wow. A week ago a merger between the
Stanford Pictorial and the Stanford Cardinal was
proposed. Today it is no longer a proposal. It is
a merger.
True, the new publication has neither name nor
editor. Rut the combination has been effected, an
agreement has been reached, and the publication
committee has been appointed. It should be a com
paratively easy matter to complete the work.

Clearing the local field of journalism of one of its
many publications can be received by the advertisers
with nothing else than acclaim. The competition
hereafter need not be so keen, the duplication of edi
torial matter need not recur, and the approach of
advertising managers to business men need not be
so frequent and insistent. The entire field, both
financially and editorially, has been greatly cleared.
It now remains for the new publication to justify
its existence by maintaining editorial standards com
prised of the best in both of the departing Pictorial
and Cardinal. The worst may easily be obviated.
The most objectionable editorial matter in the past
has been printed because of the dearth of more suit
able material.
