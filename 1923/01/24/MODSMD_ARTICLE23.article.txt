The law of contracts will not hold,
When one contracts a bloomin' ro!d,
I kissed her, for I knew not what
A cold she had, which I've now got.

"Why did Bubley jump out of the four-story window?"
asked Smith of Smith.
"Taking things too literally. The doctor wrote him a
prescription and told him to follow'it out—it blew out
of the window!"

EGG—Sactly!
A patient hen sat all the day
Upon twelve eggs, hid in the hay;
They hatched out ducks which swam away.
Poor hen!
She didn't know her eggs.

I hate to study for an ex
My poor mentality to vex
Pursuing after knowledge;
I'd like to wring the scrawny necks
Of sundry over-studious wrecks
Who clutter up the college.
They boost the average of the class
And make it hard for me to pass
Without excessive study.
They make me out a silly ass
Intended to subsist on grass
—My thoughts of them are bloody.
As room-mates, though, they are ideal,
Despite their laughter's silver peal
At my amusing dumbness.
Especially so, when I can steal
Their math.; I then can always feel
A pleasant mental numbness.
And never have a thought of how
Through Calc tomorrow I must plow
To sooth my math, professor;
And that is why I do allow
Their absence from a dangling bough—
My work grows less and lesser.

The longer the editorials, the fewer the Cabbages.
May the Editor'sjtypewriter ever keep its strength.
