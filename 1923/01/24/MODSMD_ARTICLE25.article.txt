Women are economical to the ex
treme in their dress, according to
the statement of a certain professor
in the Economics department this
morning while lecturing on markets
and marketing. "But they go about
it in an entirely different manner than
their lesser halves. Whe a man at
tempts to economize he cuts down on
the quality of the article he is buying.
But a woman fights out her problem
on a diverse line. When she seeks to
economize on a skirt, she does not cut
down on the quality of the goods
which go into the skirt, she cuts down
on the quantityâ€”hence the narrow
and short ." And then the profes
sor blushed and changed the subject.
Stanford's basketball team faces one
of its strongest opponents in this
year's schedule Saturday night, when
it plays the formidable Santa Clara
five on the latter's court.
Stanford has received an invitation
to send a relay team to the twenty
third annual intercollegiate Relay
Carnival held by the University of
Pensylvania in Philadelphia, April 27
and 28. This is one of the most import
ant athletic events held in the United
States, but owing to the time set for
the meet, there will be no Stanford
team represented.
Ail-American and All-Collegian selec
tion in the low hurdles as announced
by the Amateur Athletic Union gave
"Feg" Murray, *16, double honors.
Norman Ross, ex-'2O, left the cam
pus yesterday and sails from San Fran
cisco today for Honolulu, where he
will take part in the Mid-Pacific swim
ming carnival ynder the colors of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco.
