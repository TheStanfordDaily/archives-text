## MINNESOTA TRAINS BIRD FOR "TREASURE ISLAND" 
### 
UNIVERSITY OP MINNESOTAâ€”
"Hells Bells, Bucket of Blood, Pieces
of Eight" squawks the Garrick Club
parrot in "Treasure Island," which is
I the coming presentation of the stu
dents of the University of Minnesota.
The belligerent attitude of the parrot
is making the cast consider a rubber
' tip on the beak and the pulling of the
parrot's front teeth, lets the buckets
of blood furnished by the nine mur
ders in the play be something other
than red paint. As to the parrot's
histrionic ability, it is rumored that
a professor of the University Public
Speaking department is tutoring him
on the sly.
