# Alpha Delta Phi Wins Battle Against Delta Kappa Epsilon
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi, after battling Delta
Kappa Epsilon on even terms for half
the game yesterday, opened the second
half of their contest with a strong
attack and won the game 9-3. In the
other three games of the day, Tlieta
Chi defeated Sequoia Hall, second
floor, team 14-10; Breakers won from
Phi Gamma Delta 19-(5; and Los Arcos
took their game from Encina Hall,
fifth floor, 25-2.
Steffan and Woodward Fail to
Win for Delta Kappa Epsilon
Delta Kappa Epsilon, with Steffan
and Woodward going strong on the
forward line, started out against Alpha
Delta Phi with a rush that promised
them victory. But after Woodward
made one field goal and Steiifan shot
a free throw, they were stopped. Den
nis made one field goal for the only
points Alpha Delta Phi counted in the
first half and Delta Kappa Epsilon led
at the end of the period 3-2.
But the Delta Kappa Epsilon for
wards could not get started in the
second half and what few times Stef
fan did get free for shots at the bas
ket he was hurried by the Alpha Delta
Phi guards and missed.
Dennis, however, caged another goal
in the final period and Fairchild and
Hall each scored once. Campbell, cen
ter, played a roving guard position for
Alpha Delta Phi and fed the ball to
Dennis and Fairchild under the bas
ket. Poor teamwork between Dennis
and Fairchild when close up to the
basket prevented any larger score.
Delta Kappa Epsilon played a hard
game but the men could not make
their shots count and were unable
to break away from their opponents.
Theta Chi Meets Stiff Opposition
In Game With Sequoia Second Team
Theta Chi had considerable diffi
culty in defeating Sequoia Hall second
floor team 14-0 last night, in spite of
the fact that they had won from El
Toro 20-9 and from Los Arcos 11-2
while Sequoia Hall second floor team
had lost both its games.
The half ended with the score 8-8,
Brown having made six points for Se
quoia while Hollingsworth and Smith
made four each for Theta Chi. The
Theta Chi team, although heavier, was
unable to get through the Sequoia
guards and at the same time hold the
forwards in check until the last part of
the final period. Hollingsworth and
Smith each contributed another goal
during that time and with two free
throws by Blosser gave their team
sufficient lead to win. Blosser, who has
been playing on the 130-pound team,
â– was unable to cage a single goal
against Sequoia. Brown played a fast,
hard game and succeeded in getting
two baskets from lite floor in spite of'
the heavier Theta Chi guards.
Hamilton and Blacker Are High
Scorers as Los Arcos Wins Game
Los Arcos wasted little time in
breaking into the scoring column in
their game against Encina Hall, fifth
floor, which they won by the decisive
score of 25-2. The Encina team failed
to score a single point until five min
utes before the end of the game when
a lucky shot from under the basket by
Green gave them their only score. At
half time the score stood at i3-0 for
Los Arcos and the pace was not;
abated in the final minutes.
After Encina scored its only points,
Los Arcos sent in a whole new team.
The game was played from then on on
even terms and both teams rushed the
ball back and forth from one goal to
the other without a score.

Hamilton scored four field goals for
Los Arcos. Blacker also shot four bas
kets as well as five free throws. Smith
who led his teammates In the scoring
column in previous games, played his
same consistent game but made only
two baskets.
Peavy Shoots From All Angles in
Breakers-Phi Gamma Delta Game
Breakers found the basket nine
times in defeating Phi Gamma Delta
19-6 in a rough game. The teamwork
of the Breakers' players and their
last charging game kept the ball in
their possession most of the time and,
by accurate passes to him under the
basket, Peavy was able to tally four
times before the half ended. He scored
once more before the end of the game
( and Loewenstein and Harlow each
scored twice.
Peavy was the mainstay of the
Breakers team, covering the whole
floor and fighting hard for the ball on
every occasion. Time after time when
the Phi Gamma Delta players held the
ball, Peavy or Harlow would knock
the ball out of their grip and race
down the floor with it. None of the
Phi Gamma Delta players showed
much basketball ability. Chase was
the only one to get by the Breakers'
guards when he broke through for two
baskets in the last half.
