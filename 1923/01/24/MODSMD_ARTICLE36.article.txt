# WHISKERINO CONTEST AT UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADAâ€”The
Junior class at the University of Ne
vada has announced its intention of
holding a three weeks "Whiskerino"
contest, to begin some time this week.
If the plan is carried through, Gillettes
will be formally abolished and the
campus men will go unshaven for
twenty-one days. At the end of the
period a '49 dance will be staged and
prizes awarded to the winners. It is
rumored that the Nevada co-eds will
not shave either.
