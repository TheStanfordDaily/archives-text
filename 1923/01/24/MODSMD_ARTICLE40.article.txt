# Judges for Annual Tri-State Debate Will Be Selected by New Method
## 
### 
Judges for the tri-state debate with
the universities of Oregon and Wash
ington will be selected by the univer
sity where the debate is to be held.
Previously it has been the custom for
one university to select a group of
judges and submit their names to the
other universities for their approval.
Under this plan each university is
placed on its honor to select fair and
competent judges, and the inconven
ience of submitting lists for approval
has been eliminated.
According to J. G. Emerson, faculty
debating adviser, the Stanford debat
ers are finding that the question of
light wines and beers is very interest
ing. An amazing mass of material has
been gone over and the facts sifted.
"The debate should be valuable, as a
sitting down of the propaganda and
bringing to light the really dominant
issues,'' says Emerson.
The debate is to be held with the
universities of Oregon and Washing
ton on March 2. Stanford's negative
team, Thomas Bailey, '23, and John
Hall, '25, will make the trip to Oregon.
Claude Minard, '23, and Robert Lewis,
'23, will defend the affirmative against
Washington in the assembly hall, on
the campus.
The question for the debate is, "Re
solved, that the federal government
should permit the manufacture and
sale of light wines and beer."
