tional history since ths advent of the '
Dominican and Jesuit missionaries in
1700, Dr. C. D. Tenney of Palo Alto, in 1
his lecture to the Cosmopolitan Club on
Monday evening, gave an account of his 1
part in establishing a university near Tien
Tsien and his efforts to maintain it. '
He found that the Chinese students are j 1
second to none in natural ability, and 1 1
members of his first graduating class '■
have been premiers, secretaries and cabi- '
net officers of the republic.
During the Boxer Rebellion Dr. Ten- I
ney was forced to disband the university,
and it was not reopened until Yung Shiah ;
Kai had become Viceroy of the Metro
politan Province. Dr. Tenney estab
lished middle schools in each prefecture ;
of the province at the request of Yung
Shiah Kai, but it was not until 190(j ;
that schools became extensively oper-j
ative in the country.
In 1906 Dr. Tenney returned to Amer-!
ica in charge of a large body of Chinese |
students, whom he superintended in this
country for two years until the govern- j
ment at Washington asked him to go j
back to China with the American
Legation at Peking.
"Socialism, Communism, and even
Bolshevism have penetrated the student
bodies of the Chinese colleges of today, j
while in the old regime they respected,
revered and obeyed their teachers,"!
stated Dr. Tenney. "At present, the
northern provinces are under the control |
of military dictators, and conditions are
very discouraging," he concluded.
