# Fatty Arbuckle's Return To Filmdom Is Subject For Nestoria Discussion
## 
### 
Whether or not Will Hays, film direc
tor, is justified in reinstating Fatty Ar
buckle to the screen, will be the subject
for one of two debates scheduled for the
next meeting of Nestoria tomorrow night.
The other will be: Resolved, That France
was justified in her invasion of the Ruhr.
Will Hays' attitude has caused much
discussion throughout the country as to
the merits of the question. During the
Christmas holidays, Arbuckle was re
sponsible for the statement that the spirit
of Christianity is not in existence today.
He said that people are lacking in for
giveness, and that he who commits a
wrong is usually looked upon thereafter
as a social outcast.
