SACRAMENTO, Cal., Jan. 24.—With
conservation of California's fish and
game the object of the legislation,
three bills designed to assure the
state's hunters and stream followers
bounteous sport for years to come are
being prepared and will be introduced
in either the assembly or senate with
in the next few days, the United Press
was informed today.
They are:
A bill limiting each hunter to one
deer each season.
A bill prohibiting the use of dogs
in hunting deer.
A bill increasing the hunting or fish
ing license to a figure at least double
the $1 now charged.
The only moa«ure expected to re
ceive much opposition is the one pre
venting the use of dogs by deer hunt
ers. Members of the legislature are
being flooded letters from sports
men opposed to the bill. Cattle owners
are heartily in favor of it, declaring
that the dogs used in hunting often
attack their cattle.
