# BIG MEET WILL BE HELD AT BERKELEY
## Change Made Because of Big Game Held at Stanford for Two Consecutive Years 
### 
The annual Stanford-California track
meet will be held at Berkeley April 21
instead of at Stanford, according to
an announcement made yesterday by
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher.
The change was made following an
agreement between the two institu
tions that in the future the Big Game
and the Big Meet will not be held on
the same campus. The Big Game has
been held at Stanford for the past two
years and this year's Big Meet will
make the second consecutive one to
be held on the Berkeley campus.
"The new arrangement is only just,
and in view of the fact that the new
track in the Stadium will probably not
be completed by April 21, it will be
better for Stanford," says Track Coach
"Dink" Templeton.
The track and bleachers at the
Berkeley oval will undergo improve
ments before the Big Meet, according
to Fletcher. The bleachers have been
Condemned and were unsafe for the
crowd at the meet last year but they
will be reinforced in the near future.
The change in the arrangements for
the varsity meet will have no effect on
the Stanford-California freshman meet
which will be held at Stanford. Should
the new California stadium be uncom
pleted for the 1923 Big Game, the Big
Meet next year will again be held at
Berkeley.
