# HISTORY OF CHILE TRACED IN LECTURE BY M.G. HUIDOBRO
## 
### 
The discovery, conquest, colonization, and
finally the independence and development
of Chile, were the topics discussed by Dr.
Marcus G. Huidohro, Chilean Consul-
General, stationed at San Francisco, in
his illustrated lecture given in the Little
Theater Tuesday evening.
North American independence, the
French Revolution, the English consti
tutional government, and the invasion of
Spain by Napoleon, were the deciding
factors in the revolt of the Spanish col
onies.
Matters came to a head in Chile when
a group of men gathered together to or
ganize a form of democratic government
and if necessary fight for Chilean inde
pendence, and on September 18, 1810, ev
ery man in Chile was decreed to be free
and equal. The theory that it is impos
sible to have a real democratic govern
ment unless the people are well educated
was put into effect in 1812, when
L'institutio Nationale, the famous col
lege, was established in Santiago.
In 1543 there were 500 public schools
in Chile, but now since the passage of
the compulsory education law there are
3500 public primary schools with a ca
pacity of from 500 to 600 students each.
The government pays all expenses of
education, so that it costs nothing to get
a degree in any profession in a Chilean
university.
"We believed that the progress of a
nation is dependent on its trade, and that
trade is largely dependent on the facili
ties of transportation, so our govern
mcnt-owned railroad system, which is
about 7000 miles long, is one of the most
rapid, cheap and efficient systems known,"
stated Dr. Huidobro. Improvements are
continuously being carried on in Chile,
the latest being the supplying of electric
power to all the railroads, the contract
for which the Westinghouse Electric
Company of New York got for $9,000,000.
