# Excavation Work on U.C. Stadium Proceeds Rapidly
## 
### 
Work on the California memorial
stadium in Strawberry canyon is now
under way. The sides of the hills are
being dug away in the low places to
form the bowl, and a culvert is being
built to carry the waters of Straw
berry creek directly under the sta
dium. It is expected that all excava
tion will be done in 100 days. Con
tracts will be let soon for the concrete
work.
The work of beautifying the stadium
with shrubbery, lawns, and flowers
will begin before actual construction
work ceases. Authorities believe the
bowl will be finished for hte 1923 Big
Game.
