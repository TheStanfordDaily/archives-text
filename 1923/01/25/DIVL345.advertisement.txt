OPAZEL
FOR ALL SKIN BLEMISHES
Guy Otis Brewster, A. 8,, M. D.
OPAZEL is not a cosmetic;
neither is it a "patent medicine."
It does not cover up skin blem
ishes, but removes them. It does
not treat the surface of the skin;
it penetrates to the depths of
the pores and rejuvenates and
rebuilds it.
OPAZEL is a new discovery in
chemistry—a skin tAiic and
stimulant. It acts directly on
the ducts, glands and underlying
structure of the skin, improving
ami regulating the circulation of
blood and lymph, and the func
tioning of sweat ducts and oil
glands.
In thisjnanner OPAZEL removes
the cause of red and roughened
complexions, dry and greasy
skin, acne, eczema, blackheads,
erythema and other skin trou
bles.
And when the cause is removed,
and the delicate process of circu
lation and elimination are pro
perly regulated, skin affections
disappear, the velvet smooth
ness and pink and white com
plexion of youth return, the
broken down tissues are rebuilt
and wrinkles are eradicated.
OPAZEL was discovered by Dr.
Guy Otis Brewster, a prominent
New York specialist, and is the
result of years of constant re
search and experiment. Dr.
Brewster's private practice was
one of the most exclusive and
remunerative in New York; his
offices in Park avenue were vis
ited daily by members of wealthy
and distingushed families whose
names are nationally familiar.
But as soon as Dr. Brewster had
perfected OPAZEL. and proved
conclusively that it was scien
tifically .correct and would pro
duce corrective and reconstruc
tive changes in the human skin
that were heretofore considered
impossible, he relinquished his
practice in order that he might
devote his entire time and en
ergy to spreading the good news
of OPAZEL and doing all that
lay in his power to bring per
manent relief to the thousands
whose lives are saddened by dis
figuring and distressing skin af
fections.
You will enjoy using OPAZEL.
It resembles an especially
smooth and delightful face
cream. And you yill not have
to wait for its results to show.
In a very short time you will
notice a marked improvement
and the regular use of OPAZEL.
will work, a magical change.
You will seem to have an en
tirely new skin —a skin of youth
and health and radiant beauty.
If your skin is imperfect or un
attractive, do not neglect it. You
are entitled to a beautiful skin,
and you can have it. Remember,
too, that little imperfections
may, if not Attended to, develop
into serious and disfiguring skin
affections. Many a woman's life
has been spoiled by skin affec
tions that OPAZEL would have
eliminated.
OPAZEL is positively guaran
teed to do everything for your

OPAZEL
FOR ALL SKIN BLEMISHES
Guy Otis Brewster, A. 8,, M. D.
OPAZEL is not a cosmetic;
neither is it a "patent medicine."
It does not cover up skin blem
ishes, but removes them. It does
not treat the surface of the skin;
it penetrates to the depths of
the pores and rejuvenates and
rebuilds it.
OPAZEL is a new discovery in
chemistry—a skin tAiic and
stimulant. It acts directly on
the ducts, glands and underlying
structure of the skin, improving
ami regulating the circulation of
blood and lymph, and the func
tioning of sweat ducts and oil
glands.
In thisjnanner OPAZEL removes
the cause of red and roughened
complexions, dry and greasy
skin, acne, eczema, blackheads,
erythema and other skin trou
bles.
And when the cause is removed,
and the delicate process of circu
lation and elimination are pro
perly regulated, skin affections
disappear, the velvet smooth
ness and pink and white com
plexion of youth return, the
broken down tissues are rebuilt
and wrinkles are eradicated.
OPAZEL was discovered by Dr.
Guy Otis Brewster, a prominent
New York specialist, and is the
result of years of constant re
search and experiment. Dr.
Brewster's private practice was
one of the most exclusive and
remunerative in New York; his
offices in Park avenue were vis
ited daily by members of wealthy
and distingushed families whose
names are nationally familiar.
But as soon as Dr. Brewster had
perfected OPAZEL. and proved
conclusively that it was scien
tifically .correct and would pro
duce corrective and reconstruc
tive changes in the human skin
that were heretofore considered
impossible, he relinquished his
practice in order that he might
devote his entire time and en
ergy to spreading the good news
of OPAZEL and doing all that
lay in his power to bring per
manent relief to the thousands
whose lives are saddened by dis
figuring and distressing skin af
fections.
You will enjoy using OPAZEL.
It resembles an especially
smooth and delightful face
cream. And you yill not have
to wait for its results to show.
In a very short time you will
notice a marked improvement
and the regular use of OPAZEL.
will work, a magical change.
You will seem to have an en
tirely new skin —a skin of youth
and health and radiant beauty.
If your skin is imperfect or un
attractive, do not neglect it. You
are entitled to a beautiful skin,
and you can have it. Remember,
too, that little imperfections
may, if not Attended to, develop
into serious and disfiguring skin
affections. Many a woman's life
has been spoiled by skin affec
tions that OPAZEL would have
eliminated.
OPAZEL is positively guaran
teed to do everything for your
skin that is stated in this col
umn. If you are not thoroughly
satisfied with it, we will return
your money without question.
