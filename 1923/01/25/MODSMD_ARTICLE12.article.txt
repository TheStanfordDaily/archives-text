# Rough's Smoking Briar Almost Causes Panic; Firemen Are Slighted
## 
### 
This is the story of one of the great
est near-fires in Stanford's history. It
is a narrative of how frightened stu
dents stood almost paralyzed in their
tracks, sniffing at blue air round about
then It also tells how the Stanford fire
department rushed to the scene with high
expectations of thoroughly watersoaking
everything, only to be foiled.
Students remarked about the peculiar
color of the air in the English building
yeestrday afternoon. A few with keener
smelling apparatuses put their noses to
the trail and finally surmised that a fire
was brewing. Everyone who happened
to be near that corner of the Quad at the
time also started to investigate. Yes, a
blue haze floated in the air.
Fire! Fire! Someone turned in an
alarm and the Stanford fire department,
with bell clanging, tore down Lasuen.
Hose was attached to the hydrant in front
of the Libraryâ€”and then the query,
"Where is it?"
A particular Stanford man went home
last night angered and in great wrath.
A perfectly good overcoat had been just
about ruined. Why did they have to grab
it and tub it in all that dirty water just
off the Quad? And, above all, why did
he have to be so careless as to leave his
lighted pipe in one of the overcoat's
pockets when he went to class?
