# ROBINS DEFINES TRAITS NECESSARY FOR LEADERSHIP
## Social Progress Depends on Advancement of Slowest Elements in Society 
### 
Leadership, Raymond Robins believes,
is a composite of physical soundness, in
tellectual integrity and a moral will that
directs the mind and body.
"If you would make a dent in the
world," Robins said in the University
assembly this morning, "tie up to some
great cause and devote all your energies
to it. Brilliant people resent being tied
to slow ones, but behind the leaders of
our society are the hidden workers—the
garden variety of common people—who
make it possible for the great men to
shine.
Progress Depends on Slowest
"Civilization advances only so fast as
its slowest elements. If we keep men
■working for less than a living wage and
herd them in miserable tenements, our
asylums and penitentiaries will even the
score.
"Institutions of democracy," the
speaker continued, "live only when in
carnate in living men. Words in law
books mean nothing unless they are a
part of every individual in society." To
illustrate this point, Robins described the
recent Herrin massacre; the blame for
that occurrence rested with the coal op
erators rather than the miners. Law
lessness at the top is reflected in lawless
ness at the bottom.
Great Causes Lift Believer
Great enthusiasms, Robins believes, are
only for those who suffer for great prin
ciples. A great cause will lift its believer
from mediocrity to the plane of the
world's great leaders. Lincoln was given
as an example of the leader who kept
his feet on the •ground even though his
! head was among the stars.
Robins described his trying journey
into the Yukon twenty-five years ago,
when the dangers of the northern trail
ta: ght him the meaning of co-operation
and brotherhood. Among his compan
ions were "hot stove miners," who hov
ered around their stoves and mined with
their mouths; needless to say these men
did not come out of the north with any
of the yellow metal. Robins character
ized a portion of the student body as be
; longing to the class of "hot stove
minersthey leave Stanford with a
diploma but no real education. One gets
| out of anything only so much as he puts
i in.
Robins' talk was primarily an inspira
tion to the dumbbells. He believes that
the brilliant young person often gets
heady and blows up, leaving the sl6w,
untalented man to finish the job. It is
the things on the inside of a man rather
than any externals that determine his
true power, and consequently his capacity
for leadership.
