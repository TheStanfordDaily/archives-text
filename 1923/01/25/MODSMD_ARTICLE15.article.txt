from Encina Hall second floor 13-6;
Encina Hall third floor defeated En
cina Hall fourth floor 21-19, and Beta ,

Resort to Long Shots
Both El Cuadro and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fought hard for an opening in
the other's defense at the start of the
game, which promised to be tight.
Neither team attempted many close
shots in the early part of the game,
and the forwards resorted to long
tries from the middle and side of the
floor. In this the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
forwards were superior and Mathews
and Doughty caged pretty shots, giv
ing their team a good lead.
Eggleston and Burkhard got the ball
under the Sigma Alpha Epsilon basket
several times and took a number of
tries for a goal before the ball was
knocked out on the court. But the ball
refused to roll in and El Cuadro was
unable to make a single point during
the first half.
In spite of a ten-point lead for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, both teams fought on
equal terms, El Cuadro managing to]
break into the scoring column four 1
times during the final period.
Mathews Stars for S. A. E.
Mathews was the all-around man on
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon team, cover- ,
iug the floor well, getting free from
his guard, and shooting baskets from
all positions. Gibbons also played a
hard game on the floor, but was not
as good at shooting, making only two
baskets where he had chances for sev

eral more.
Burkhard was the fastest man on
the El Cuadro team, making shot after
shot at the basket from mid-floor and
from inside the foul line, each one
missing by the narrowest margin.
Thompson guarded the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon forwards as well as he could
alone, none of his teammates falling
back to their goal to aid him in block
ing the rush of their opponents down
the floor. •
El Cuadro had a better and more
accurate passing game than Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, but their defense could
not compare with the five-man com
bination employed by their opponents.
El Campo Plays Fast Game
The El Campo-Theta Xi game,
which the former won easily, 10-0, was
one of the fastest contests of the day,
despite its one-sidedness. Hobro, for
ward on the 130-pound team, started
the scoring for El Campo with three
good shots from the sidelines. Young,
his teammate on the 130-pound team,
also scored, caging two shots from
mid-floor in the final period.
El Campo missed a few easy shots,
but Theta Xi was playing in hard
luck when shot after shot went wide,
Lawrence and Mulchay missing five
attempts for points from free throws.
Mulchay, who played the best game
for his team in its two previous starts,
was unable to do much with his dribble
last night and had very few shots at
the basket. Lawrence was all over the
floor and in every play, being by far
the most dangerous man on the Theta
Xi team.
El Campo had a strong three-man
defense which worked to perfection.
This, combined with a good, fast pass
ing game, enabled them to hold the
ball most of the game. Ilobro, Young,
and Penepacker worked a speedy of
fense, but the passing was too swift
for them at times.
Encina First Floor Fail to Appear
The lieta Theta Pi team was cred
ited with a victory over Encina Hall
first floor when the Encina men failed
to show up.
Encina Hall third and fourth floor
teams fought to a near deadlock, En-;
cina Hall third floor finally winning
21-19. During the first half, Sewell
broke loose three times for Encina
third and Jackson scored twice. Sew
ell continued to score in the final half,!
and Otis and Clark piled up six bas
kets for Encina fourth before they
were stopped. Sewell was the high
scorer for Encina third, making eleven
points, while Clark made the same
number for Encina fourth, Otis help
ing him with four more. Neither team
showed much defensive strength and
their offensives moved in spurts.
Japanese Show Superior Speed
The Japanese Club took their second
tournament game lasfcnight when they
defeated Encina Hall second floor 13-6.
The Encina men were much the larger,
but the Japanese with their superior
speed and passing were able to get
free and make enough shots good to
win the game.
Sano led the victors with three field
goals and Murata, Mizota, and Sera
each tallied once. The fc Japanese Club
team worked well together and showed
the advantages of considerable prac
tice individually and collectively. Ham
ilton was the only one of the Encina
men to score twice. The game was
ragged with much aimless shooting
and passing, especially on the part of
the Encina men.

Resort to Long Shots
Both El Cuadro and Sigma Alpha
Epsilon fought hard for an opening in
the other's defense at the start of the
game, which promised to be tight.
Neither team attempted many close
shots in the early part of the game,
and the forwards resorted to long
tries from the middle and side of the
floor. In this the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
forwards were superior and Mathews
and Doughty caged pretty shots, giv
ing their team a good lead.
Eggleston and Burkhard got the ball
under the Sigma Alpha Epsilon basket
several times and took a number of
tries for a goal before the ball was
knocked out on the court. But the ball
refused to roll in and El Cuadro was
unable to make a single point during
the first half.
In spite of a ten-point lead for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, both teams fought on
equal terms, El Cuadro managing to]
break into the scoring column four 1
times during the final period.
Mathews Stars for S. A. E.
Mathews was the all-around man on
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon team, cover- ,
iug the floor well, getting free from
his guard, and shooting baskets from
all positions. Gibbons also played a
hard game on the floor, but was not
as good at shooting, making only two
baskets where he had chances for sev

eral more.
Burkhard was the fastest man on
the El Cuadro team, making shot after
shot at the basket from mid-floor and
from inside the foul line, each one
missing by the narrowest margin.
Thompson guarded the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon forwards as well as he could
alone, none of his teammates falling
back to their goal to aid him in block
ing the rush of their opponents down
the floor. •
El Cuadro had a better and more
accurate passing game than Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, but their defense could
not compare with the five-man com
bination employed by their opponents.
El Campo Plays Fast Game
The El Campo-Theta Xi game,
which the former won easily, 10-0, was
one of the fastest contests of the day,
despite its one-sidedness. Hobro, for
ward on the 130-pound team, started
the scoring for El Campo with three
good shots from the sidelines. Young,
his teammate on the 130-pound team,
also scored, caging two shots from
mid-floor in the final period.
El Campo missed a few easy shots,
but Theta Xi was playing in hard
luck when shot after shot went wide,
Lawrence and Mulchay missing five
attempts for points from free throws.
Mulchay, who played the best game
for his team in its two previous starts,
was unable to do much with his dribble
last night and had very few shots at
the basket. Lawrence was all over the
floor and in every play, being by far
the most dangerous man on the Theta
Xi team.
El Campo had a strong three-man
defense which worked to perfection.
This, combined with a good, fast pass

the first half.
In spite of a ten-point lead for Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, both teams fought on
equal terms, El Cuadro managing to]
break into the scoring column four 1
times during the final period.
Mathews Stars for S. A. E.
Mathews was the all-around man on
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon team, cover- ,
iug the floor well, getting free from
his guard, and shooting baskets from
all positions. Gibbons also played a
hard game on the floor, but was not
as good at shooting, making only two
baskets where he had chances for sev

eral more.
Burkhard was the fastest man on
the El Cuadro team, making shot after
shot at the basket from mid-floor and
from inside the foul line, each one
missing by the narrowest margin.
Thompson guarded the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon forwards as well as he could
alone, none of his teammates falling
back to their goal to aid him in block
ing the rush of their opponents down
the floor. •
El Cuadro had a better and more
accurate passing game than Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, but their defense could
not compare with the five-man com
bination employed by their opponents.
El Campo Plays Fast Game
The El Campo-Theta Xi game,
which the former won easily, 10-0, was
one of the fastest contests of the day,
despite its one-sidedness. Hobro, for
ward on the 130-pound team, started
the scoring for El Campo with three
good shots from the sidelines. Young,
his teammate on the 130-pound team,
also scored, caging two shots from
mid-floor in the final period.
El Campo missed a few easy shots,
but Theta Xi was playing in hard
luck when shot after shot went wide,
Lawrence and Mulchay missing five
attempts for points from free throws.
Mulchay, who played the best game
for his team in its two previous starts,
was unable to do much with his dribble
last night and had very few shots at
the basket. Lawrence was all over the
floor and in every play, being by far
the most dangerous man on the Theta
Xi team.
El Campo had a strong three-man
defense which worked to perfection.
This, combined with a good, fast pass
ing game, enabled them to hold the
ball most of the game. Ilobro, Young,
and Penepacker worked a speedy of
fense, but the passing was too swift
for them at times.
Encina First Floor Fail to Appear
The lieta Theta Pi team was cred
ited with a victory over Encina Hall
first floor when the Encina men failed
to show up.
Encina Hall third and fourth floor
teams fought to a near deadlock, En-;
cina Hall third floor finally winning
21-19. During the first half, Sewell
broke loose three times for Encina
third and Jackson scored twice. Sew
ell continued to score in the final half,!
and Otis and Clark piled up six bas
kets for Encina fourth before they
were stopped. Sewell was the high
scorer for Encina third, making eleven
points, while Clark made the same
number for Encina fourth, Otis help
ing him with four more. Neither team
showed much defensive strength and
their offensives moved in spurts.
Japanese Show Superior Speed
The Japanese Club took their second
tournament game lasfcnight when they
defeated Encina Hall second floor 13-6.
The Encina men were much the larger,
but the Japanese with their superior
speed and passing were able to get
free and make enough shots good to
win the game.
Sano led the victors with three field
goals and Murata, Mizota, and Sera
each tallied once. The fc Japanese Club
team worked well together and showed
the advantages of considerable prac
tice individually and collectively. Ham
ilton was the only one of the Encina
men to score twice. The game was
ragged with much aimless shooting
and passing, especially on the part of
the Encina men.

Resort to Long Shots
Both El Cuadro and Sigma Alpha

the other's defense at the start of the
game, which promised to be tight.
Neither team attempted many close
shots in the early part of the game,
and the forwards resorted to long
tries from the middle and side of the
floor. In this the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
forwards were superior and Mathews
and Doughty caged pretty shots, giv
ing their team a good lead.
Eggleston and Burkhard got the ball
under the Sigma Alpha Epsilon basket
several times and took a number of
tries for a goal before the ball was
