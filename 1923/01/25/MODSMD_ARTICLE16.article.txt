# ANDY KERR'S QUINTET HANDS OUT DEFEAT TO MISSIONITES; FRESHMEN LOSE TO PIEDMONT
## Poor Basketball Is Exhibited In Varsity Game; Hunt's Proteges Are Completely Outclassed 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
If the 1926 court quintet knows any
j basketball there was no evidence of it
last night when the fast Piedmont'
High School team handed the Babes
[ a 28-13 lacing. It was the second de- j
feat Hunt's team has suffered this sea
! son.
Game Is Fast and Rough
The game was fast and rough, three
men being disqualified 011 four person
al fouls. Nevers was the first to go in
the early part of the second quarter,
and the yearlings, trailing at the
wrong end of a 10-3 score when he left,
went to pieces. The score at half time
was 18-8.
The Piedmont team was by far the
1 fastest and best balanced high school
j aggregation seen on the Pavilion court
; this season. Robie, the little blonde
I forward, was the individual star of the
game. He found slight trouble in sink
ing the ball from almost any angle,
and accounted for sixteen of his
team's twenty-eight points. Davies, the
long, lanky prep center, made three
field goals and, together with Brock
and Donant, kept his goal clear.
Piedmont Takes Lead Early
The high school players were in
command of the situation from the
opening whistle. Baskets by Davies,
Robie, and Pfisters gave them a 10-3
lead in the first quarter, and the fresh
men never appeared dangerous.
The game was the worst exhibition
of basketball on the part of the 1926
I quintet that has been seen this year.
Nevers and Frazier were so well cov
ered that their shots for the hoop
were few and inaccurate. Frazier sunk
two field baskets while Nevers con
verted four free throws out of nine
attempts.
Freshmen Lack Usual Form
Carter, who started at center, could
j not hang onto the ball, and had hard
luck trying for the'basket. Morrison
relieved him in the second quarter
and showed the effects of his long lay
off.
McDermott was the only man on
the team who played up to usual form.
I He, guarded his man well and the
preps got few shots under the basket.
Mitchell was not up to his usual game
and failed to cover Robie, with the
i result that the little fellow ran wild.
The freshman captain could not work
his dribbling game against the high
j school guards and failed to register a
' point.
'26 Game Must Improve to Win
With the first Bruin Cub game
scheduled for Saturday night the pros
pects for the Cardinal freshmen do not
look very promising. Their defensive
game will have to improve greatly and
the forwards will have to start find
ing the basket. Incidentally, Ernie
Nevers must take things a bit easy or
he will be watching the game from
the bench after the first few minutes.
The big fellow is over-eager to get at
the man with the ball and those per
sonal fouls usually call for two free
! shots.

'26 Game Must Improve to Win
With the first Bruin Cub game
scheduled for Saturday night the pros
pects for the Cardinal freshmen do not
look very promising. Their defensive
game will have to improve greatly and
the forwards will have to start find
ing the basket. Incidentally, Ernie
Nevers must take things a bit easy or
he will be watching the game from
the bench after the first few minutes.
The big fellow is over-eager to get at
the man with the ball and those per

If the 1926 court quintet knows any
j basketball there was no evidence of it
last night when the fast Piedmont'
High School team handed the Babes
[ a 28-13 lacing. It was the second de- j
feat Hunt's team has suffered this sea
! son.
Game Is Fast and Rough
The game was fast and rough, three
men being disqualified 011 four person
al fouls. Nevers was the first to go in
the early part of the second quarter,
and the yearlings, trailing at the
wrong end of a 10-3 score when he left,
went to pieces. The score at half time
was 18-8.
The Piedmont team was by far the
1 fastest and best balanced high school
j aggregation seen on the Pavilion court
; this season. Robie, the little blonde
I forward, was the individual star of the
game. He found slight trouble in sink
ing the ball from almost any angle,
and accounted for sixteen of his
team's twenty-eight points. Davies, the
long, lanky prep center, made three
field goals and, together with Brock
and Donant, kept his goal clear.
Piedmont Takes Lead Early
The high school players were in
command of the situation from the
opening whistle. Baskets by Davies,
Robie, and Pfisters gave them a 10-3
lead in the first quarter, and the fresh
men never appeared dangerous.
The game was the worst exhibition
of basketball on the part of the 1926
I quintet that has been seen this year.
Nevers and Frazier were so well cov
ered that their shots for the hoop
were few and inaccurate. Frazier sunk
two field baskets while Nevers con
verted four free throws out of nine
attempts.
Freshmen Lack Usual Form
Carter, who started at center, could
j not hang onto the ball, and had hard
luck trying for the'basket. Morrison
relieved him in the second quarter
and showed the effects of his long lay
off.
McDermott was the only man on
the team who played up to usual form.
I He, guarded his man well and the
preps got few shots under the basket.
Mitchell was not up to his usual game
and failed to cover Robie, with the
i result that the little fellow ran wild.
The freshman captain could not work
his dribbling game against the high
j school guards and failed to register a
' point.
