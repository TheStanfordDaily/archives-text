# Don't Fight With Wooden Legs
## 
### (By United Press 
YONKERS, N. Y—For using his
wooden leg for a weapon in a free-for
all fight, Jacob Jones was sentenced
to four months in the workhouse.

In a game void of much real basket
ball, the Stanford varsity defeated
Santa Clara last night in the Pavilion,
22 to 16. At the end of the half-time
period, the Cardinal quintet were at
the large end of a 13 to 8 score.
Game Close at Start
The game at the start gave predic
tions of being a close contest. Neither
side was able to gain a definite lead
durnig the first ten minutes, most of
the points being scored from free
throws. The first markers of the game
were scored by Captain "Lefty" Rog
ers when lie dropped in a free throw,
followed shortly by a field goal. With
the exception of two field goals by the
Logan brothers, the Missionites* of
fense did not show much during this
period. In fact they did not show much
in any department of the game unless
it was fight.
Fumbles Detract From Game
Personal fouls were numerous. Wild
passes and fumbles ajso detracted
from making the game all that it
might have been. Stanford again did
not show much in the offensive line.
In the defensive department, they did
all that could be asked. Fumbles and
slow passes proved costly to the Card
inal offense, while six or eight easy
points were lost by shots being un
necessarily hurried.
Aurreocochea's Squad Improves
In the second half Aurreocochea's
squad played the Cardinal squad prac
tically even, making eight points to
Stanford's nine. Jimmie Logan did
most of the scoring from the floor for
Santa Clara while Vukota proved
steadier than Rogers in dropping in
free throws in this period.
Dave Oliva, at standing guard, played
probably the best game for Stanford, and
quick thinking on his part saved the
Cardinal team on several occasions in
the last half. Several times he had his
hands full in taking the ball off the back
board, but short shots by the Mission
forwards were few and far between.
Stanford followed the ball better, in the
second half, and, lead by McHose and
Janssen, was able to chalk up two field
goals in this manner.
