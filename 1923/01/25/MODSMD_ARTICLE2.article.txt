### (By United Press 
MAYENCE, Jan. 25. —French troops,
with orders to shoot to kill in case of
further disorder, took over command
of Mayence from local German police
today, following attacks upon French
officers during the early morning.
German crowds, infuriated by prison
sentences passed upon Herr Schultius,
Dusseldorf finance director, and Herr
Raiffsiesen, mine director, man-han
dled French soldiers and officers, in
vaded a hotel where the latter were
billeted, dragged an orchestra to the
street and forced the musicians to
play Deutschland über Alles.
Local police did not interfere and
the French general commanding the
area issued a proclamation, taking
over command of the city and direct
ing his troops to shoot when neces
sary. Colonials patrolled the streets
and kept crowds from gathering.
Jubilation among Germans in the
Ruhr followed announcement of the
outcome of the trial of Fritz Thyssen
and the other industrialists yesterday.
The Germans feel that the French in
imposing fines instead of prison sen
tences, showed weakness.
Important French troop movements
apparently aimed at absolute isolation
of the Ruhr, were under way through
out the night and this morning. Heavy
gun caissons rumbled through the
streets of towns that mark the limits
of the newly occupied zone.
