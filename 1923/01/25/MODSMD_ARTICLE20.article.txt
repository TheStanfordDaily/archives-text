# SOMETHING WORTH SEEING

### 
Those members of the student body who in the
past have attended campus dramatic productions
have usually gone either because they have had per
sonal interests in the cast or because the play has
been highly touted. Masquers Society is staging
"He Who Gets Slapped" tomorrow night in an effort
to enlarge the average attendance. There are
reasons.
In the first place, this production by Leoned
'Andreyev is new and startling in its line. It is dis
tinctly unique and because of its merits has enjoyed
success wherever it has been promoted.
In the second place, the cast is one of the best that
has appeared on the local stage in several dramatic
seasons. It has been expertly coached and has
achieved perfection in rehearsal.
File campus a whole has stood aloof from local
dramatic productions because, it has been said, that
student stage talent and choice of plays have been
below the most desirable plane of excellence. It
•seems that a campus tradition prevails that student
plays must of necessity be amateurish. Such is not
the case.
However, if the student body as a whole would
like to have definite proof of these assertions given,
they have but to attend "He Who Gets Slapped" to
morrow night to learn the truth. The campus may
well expect the best dramatic production of several
seasons in this performance. It may at the same time
definitely test the assertion that local dramatics have
been placed on a higher plane. Stanford students
may not expect to see good shows if they do not sup
port them. On the other hand, those interested in
dramatics may not expect to receive support if they
fail to produce the goods as advertised. This time
the goods are there; and when the curtain rolls up
the students will be.
