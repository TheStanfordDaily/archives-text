# AN INTERPRETATION OF SACRIFICE
## 
### 
who rests on his laurels, whether he
be the most popular person who ever engaged in stu
dent activity at Stanford, would be a good addition
to the undergraduate ranks of some less respected
university. The individual who thinks that he is
giving something to Stanford and wants recognition
for it has a poor sense of values. The Stanford stu
dent who gives up study hours for activity in some
other field of endeavor, whether it be for the good
of Stanford or not, need take no great credit to him
self. All that any man or woman can do is not too
much.
There are certain undergraduates engaged in ac
tively who speak of their "sacrifice" for the good
of Stanford as if they were the originators of the
saying, "It is better to give than to receive." They
set themselves tip as examples of sacrifice and expect
to have showers of bouquets fall about them. They
are in the >vrong pew.
When it comes to a point where a Stanford student
gives up all his time to working for Stanford he is
only giving as much as he is receiving. And if he
spends only half his time thus, which few do, he is
still indebted to his University. He does not sacri
fice. lie merely returns in such small measure as he
can the favors that have been given him.
No athlete sacrifices himself on the altar of Uni
versity benefits. Were it not for the fact that he re
ceives recognition and that lie likes athletics, he
would probably not be found near a gymnasium. No
member of a dramatic organization need think that
he is sacrificing his own interests for the good of
Stanford activities. Stanford owes him nothing.
The books do not balance in favor of the under
graduate under any circumstances. No campus actor
may be expected to appear on the local stage to play
to an empty house, particularly if his name is to be

withheld, and his interests arc to be taken from dra
matics. Human beings are not so constructed. No
campus journalist will spend his time on his particu
lar line of work if his own personality does not enter
somewhere. His work is to him a pleasure, not a
duty to be performed for the good of Stanford. Such
benefits as the University may derive from under
gradutes "sacrifice" arc only incidental.
It is true that there are exceptions to this rule, but
it is also true that the personal equation may not be
removed from student .activity without limiting its
membership to the point of practical extinction. This
"sacrifice" propaganda is bosh. It may be a very
sweet-smelling rose, but it certainly comes to our
view under a different name.
