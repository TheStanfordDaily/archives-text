John Galsworthy's "Justice," one of
the most eminently successful of mod
ern plays, will be given a Stanford pre
sentation March 2, when English Club
and Masquers combine in what will
undoubtedly be the biggest production
of the year. John Barrymore starred
in this play for over a year and a half
in New York, where it proved to be
the greatest sensation the dramatic
world has had for many years.
Playing ragged baseball, the Stan
ford varsity went down to defeat be
fore the fast Agnews State Hospital
nine yesterday afternoon on the var
sity diamond. The score at the end
of seven innings stood at G to 2 for
the visitors.
Stanford's first ice hockey game
with California will take place on Feb
ruary 9. Practice will be started at
once and will be greatly facilitated
through the courtesy of John Talt,
owner of the San Francisco skating
rink, who has agreed to pay the trans
portation and equipment expenses of
Stanford men in their practice. He has
offered the free use of his rink to
them.
Edwin Lamarre, an English organist
of wide repute, who gave recitals in
Festival hall during the Panama-Pa
cific Exposition, will give a program
in the Memorial Church tomorrow
morning. At the present time, Lemarre
has been playing the exposition organ,
which has been installed in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium.
Contracts for the construction of
the President's house on the crest of
Lagunita Hill were let to Taylor and

Exposition fame, who designed Mull
gardt's Tower and the Court of Ages,

liminary estimates submitted to the
Board of Trustees.
