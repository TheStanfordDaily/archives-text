### 
UNIVERSITY QF.CALIFORNIA. â€”
Certain members of the faculty have
granted interviews to the Daily California
concerning hazing of freshman for viola
tion of University of California tradi
tions. The following opinions have been
voiced:
"Traditions and customs play an im
portant part in student life and should be
observed by all members of the fresh
man class," declared Professor C. F.
Gross of the Marine Engineering de
partment. "Hazing is a form of disci
pline taken by the students and if fresh
men refuse to obey traditions, they should
be disciplined."
Professor C. H. Raymond of the Eng
lish department says, "When freshmen
enter the University, they are entering
into a new world. They must forget the
customs of their high school and acquaint
themselves with new conditions."
Professor Edmund O'Neill of the
Chemistry department states, "Hazing is
brutal and in many cases has been car
ried to extremes. Persuasion without
pressure would he a more effective means
of making freshmen observe traditions."
