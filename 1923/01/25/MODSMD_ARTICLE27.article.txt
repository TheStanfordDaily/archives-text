### 
Albert Bigelow Paine, known for his
biographies of Mark Twain and others,
has recently published "In One Man's
Life," described as chapters from the
personal and business careers of Theo
dore N. Vail. This volume is now on
the new book shelf in the Library.
The book is a story of a man and his
period, and a record of performance with
a somewhat inclusive background. It has
been said, "Bell created the telephone
and Vail created the business."
Vail was interested in international
communication from the time that he
helped in reforming railroad mail to the
hearing of the 'new voide,' and early
telephone finances. The era of his
greatest work began in 1907, when he
was made president of the American Tele
phone and Telegraph Company. In 1909
he took over the Western Union and re
organized both companies together.
By 1914 people were using telephones
to talk across the continent. In 1915,
when Vail celebrated his seventieth birth
day, telephones went to war, later, under
government control. Vail retired in 1919
to the positio# of chairman of the board,
but he died early in 1920.
