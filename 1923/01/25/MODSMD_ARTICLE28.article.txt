## 
### 
Dean Mary Yost and Mrs. David Starr
Jordan have signed articles in the initial
edition of "Who's Who Among the
Women of California," a volume devoted
to representative women of California,
which is on the new book shelf at the
Library this week.
This publication, which will be put out
annually, contains a series of essays and
articles written by well-known women
dealing with certain phases of their
work, which take up the greater part of
the book. Among other of the women
contributors arc Aurelia H. Reinhardt,
president of Mills College, and Kathleen
Norris, the authoress.
Authoritative reviews describe women's
work in all their fields of civic, social,
athletic, art, music, and literary circles.
Portraits and plates illustrate historical
events and accomplishments. Names and
addresses of 60,000 women are compiled
alphabetically, and lists of women's clubs
in California are similarly arranged.
