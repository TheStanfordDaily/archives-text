# GALOSH IS WASHINGTON VANE OF SOCIAL STATUS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTONâ€”
Last Thursday afternoon the remain
ing four Washington co-eds who had
not already bought galoshes plodded
down town through torrents of rain to j
purchase some. Hence, when Friday
morning dawned bright and clear,
2804 women deplored the sunshine.
The sorrow was not fatal, however, as
Jupiter Pluvius is sure to come J
through in a few days.
