# OREGON STUDENTS OPPOSE NEW SEMESTER PLAN
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGONâ€”The
concensus of opinion in the student
body opposes the change from the
quarter to the semester system, re
cently passed by the University of
Oregon faculty. The chief defense of

the semester plan seems to be that it
would do away with one period of
registration, while its opponents claim
that it would not only render worth
less the work of instructors in arrang
ing courses durnig the past three
years, but would also bring serious
hardships on the students who are
working their way through college.
