# TRAFFIC COP NEEDED TO STEM CO-ED RUSH
## 
### 
Following closely upon the installation
of a speed cop on the campus, it seems
that the next foothold of the law will be
a traffic officer at the back door of the
English building. Every morning be
tween classes great mobs of pedestrians
are congested in the lone entry fran
tically trying to go both ways at once.
The ingoing stream of knowledge
seekers having possession of the stop
warning in the shape of a door usually
have the advantage, but when they once
lose it there is no stopping the desperate
co-eds who have classes on the other side
of the Quad. It is rumored that an am
bulance will be stationed at the foot of
the Econ steps to carry off the crushed
and maimed traffic cops if the proposed
order should go into effect.
