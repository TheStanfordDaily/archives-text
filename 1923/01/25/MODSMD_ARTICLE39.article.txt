# Enthusiastic Onlooker Carries Field-Glasses To Basketball Contest
## 
### 
It is hard luck to go late to a basket
ball game and be forccd to sit in the
last row in the balcony. But at least one
Stanford man knows how to overcome
the difficulties of having to "take a back
seat."
Last night at the Stanford-Santa
Clara contest a "rough" in the top row
of the balcony gazed intently through a
pair of field glasses. Was he watching
the two quintets struggle for the ma
jority of points? No, for it was only
during the intermission between the quar
ters and halves that he peered through
the glasses at the section reserved for
the Stanford women.
Which, perhaps, explains the reason
why so many men who don't have field
glasses always say, "Hurry up, Bud, we
want to go to the game early and get
a frutit seat."
