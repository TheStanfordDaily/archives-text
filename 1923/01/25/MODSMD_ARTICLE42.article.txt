## 
### 
Senior committee, football and bas
ketball sweaters, proposed smoker and
jolly-ups, and the election on Febru
ary 14th were the topics discussed at
the Senior Class meeting held yester
day noon in Room 214.
The president reported that sweat
ers with numerals could be obtained
at the gymnasium for $3.00 by mem
bers of the class football and basket
ball teams.

The class voted to continue the
Senior Committee throughout the
whole year. Lou Minsky, chairman of
the committee, made his report on its
past and future activities, contending I
that its work was a factor in preserv- !
ing the traditions and forming student
opinion on the campus.
The committee was appointed by the
class president from representative
members of the Senior Class, to in
vestigate important matters relating
to college life and student affairs and
to present recommendations to the
Executive Committee and the Men's
and Women's Councils for remedying
any evils that may exist. Last quarter
the maintenance of the honor system
was the problem on which the commit
tee worked. In 1919 the Executive
Committee passed a resolution that
no signs for advertising purposes
should be posted on the telephone
posts and trees on the campus. This
edict has not been observed, and it
will be the work of the Senior Com
mittee to enforce it from now on, by
requesting all offending organizations
to cease breaking the rule.
President Myron Reed reported that
a committee had been formed to make
plans for a smoker for the men, and,
in order not to discriminate against
the women, several jolly-ups had been
placed on the calendar. The election
of class officers will be held on Febru
ary 14th, and it was requested that
serious thought be given to the choice
of those who are to lead the class in
its last lap at Stanford.
