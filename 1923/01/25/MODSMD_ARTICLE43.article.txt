# Intense Melodrama Played When Currents Get Frisky
## 
### 
A low, reverberating, pulsating sound
penetrated the chilled morning air. Oc-1
cupants of the room at lirst laughed real
merrily. Then there came again thai
same weird noise, as if some child w?re
playing, were sick, were dying. A burst
of icy air was puffed in through a win-i
dow. And still, that sanr? insistent sound
from the hallv.ay-
Men and women in the room slunk i
down deep in their seats, their teeth;
chattering. What caused this? Fright?
Or was it ?
One of the windows in Room 225 oi j
the Economics building had been'

smashed in yesterday morning and all
attempts to thr.-.st back the incoming cold
air were futile. The wind circled and
shrieked and moaned in the hallway. Hie
temperature of the room became Arctic
in its effect. "Public Finance for today
is di'missed."
