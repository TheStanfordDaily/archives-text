# MASQUERS LEADS FURNISH CHANCES FOR FINE ACTING
## Three New Additions to Cast Are Named; Bentinck Says Rehearsals Going Off Well 
### 
What may be considered as the three
leading parts of "He Who Gets Slapped,"
the Masquers drama to be presented in
the Assembly hall tomorrow night, are
taken by' campus actors, who are well
known to local dramatics.
Edythe Baylis, '24, takes the part of
Zinida in Andreyev's gripping drama of
circus life. She was acclaimed star of
the Junior Opera last spring, and had an
important part in "You Never Can Tell,"
the sophomore play of a year ago. The
role of Zinida in the present production
gives Miss Baylis full opportunity for
emotional acting and delicate shades of
characterization.
Peggy Richardson Has Co-Lead
Peggy Richardson, '24, will have her
first opportunity to show the campns
dramatic world what she can do with a
leading part. Heretofore her experience
has been restricted to chorus work. To
morrow night, however, the role of Con
suelo, the circus rider, will give her a
good chance to show her value in a pre
miere role.
Cohen Is Experienced Actor
A. D. Cohen, '21, who will handle the
title role of "He," has had experience on
the Stanford stage extending back sev
eral years. He had the lead in "Trc
lawney of the Wells," th English Club
production given two years ago. Cohen
is peculiarly adapted for his part in to-
performance, as he is a student
of Russian language and literature, and
has thus been able to catch the spirit of
the role much quicker than would other
wise have been the case. This summer
he gained experience by playing in one
of San Francisco's stock companies.
Ward Has "Heavy" Part
Direct contrast is furnished by Delmar
Daves, '26, remembered for his work as
"Tilly" in the Football Show last No
vember, and Murray Ward, who takes
the part of Baron Regnald. Daves has
the role of Count Mancitii, the out-at-the
heels, effeminate Italian; while Ward is
cast in the typical "heavy" part—the ob
noxious villain, referred to often as the
"Spider."
Three new additions to the cast were
announced last night. Dorothy Williams,
lola, Williams. and Kathleen Evans will
take the parts of Yvette, Yvonne, and
Babette, ballet girls. This brings the
number of ballet girls up to six, and adds
color and beauty to the eircus scenes.'
Bentinck Enthusiastic
Director Bentinck is enthusiastic over
the progress of the rehearsals, and the
show itself, contrary to his usual atti
tude the night before a performance.
"As rehearsals progress," says Bentinck,
"I feel more and more that Stanford's
offering of "He Who Gets Slapped" will
be one of the most striking performances
ever seen on a college stage."<
Tickets for good seats are still on sale,
according to John 1). Richer, business
manager, and the sale will be continued
Friday night at the box office as usual.
Final dress rehearsal is being held to
night.

"Tilly" in the Football Show last No
vember, and Murray Ward, who takes
the part of Baron Regnald. Daves has
the role of Count Mancitii, the out-at-the
heels, effeminate Italian; while Ward is
cast in the typical "heavy" part—the ob
noxious villain, referred to often as the
"Spider."
Three new additions to the cast were
announced last night. Dorothy Williams,
lola, Williams. and Kathleen Evans will
take the parts of Yvette, Yvonne, and
Babette, ballet girls. This brings the
number of ballet girls up to six, and adds
color and beauty to the eircus scenes.'
Bentinck Enthusiastic
Director Bentinck is enthusiastic over
the progress of the rehearsals, and the
show itself, contrary to his usual atti
tude the night before a performance.
"As rehearsals progress," says Bentinck,
"I feel more and more that Stanford's
offering of "He Who Gets Slapped" will
be one of the most striking performances
ever seen on a college stage."<
Tickets for good seats are still on sale,
according to John 1). Richer, business
manager, and the sale will be continued
Friday night at the box office as usual.
Final dress rehearsal is being held to
night.
What may be considered as the three
leading parts of "He Who Gets Slapped,"
the Masquers drama to be presented in
the Assembly hall tomorrow night, are
taken by' campus actors, who are well
known to local dramatics.
Edythe Baylis, '24, takes the part of
Zinida in Andreyev's gripping drama of
circus life. She was acclaimed star of
the Junior Opera last spring, and had an
important part in "You Never Can Tell,"
the sophomore play of a year ago. The
role of Zinida in the present production
gives Miss Baylis full opportunity for
emotional acting and delicate shades of
characterization.
Peggy Richardson Has Co-Lead
Peggy Richardson, '24, will have her
first opportunity to show the campns
dramatic world what she can do with a
leading part. Heretofore her experience
has been restricted to chorus work. To
morrow night, however, the role of Con
suelo, the circus rider, will give her a
good chance to show her value in a pre
miere role.
Cohen Is Experienced Actor
A. D. Cohen, '21, who will handle the
title role of "He," has had experience on
the Stanford stage extending back sev
eral years. He had the lead in "Trc
lawney of the Wells," th English Club
production given two years ago. Cohen
is peculiarly adapted for his part in to-
performance, as he is a student
of Russian language and literature, and
has thus been able to catch the spirit of
the role much quicker than would other
wise have been the case. This summer
he gained experience by playing in one
of San Francisco's stock companies.
Ward Has "Heavy" Part
Direct contrast is furnished by Delmar
Daves, '26, remembered for his work as
"Tilly" in the Football Show last No
vember, and Murray Ward, who takes
the part of Baron Regnald. Daves has
the role of Count Mancitii, the out-at-the
heels, effeminate Italian; while Ward is
cast in the typical "heavy" part—the ob
noxious villain, referred to often as the
