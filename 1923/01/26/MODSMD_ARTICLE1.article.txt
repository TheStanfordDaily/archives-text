## FRANCE ORDERS RUHR SEALED, AS PUNISHMENT 
### (By United Press 
ESSEN, Jan. 26. —France today or
dered her steel ring around the Ruhr
hermetically sealed as punishment for
outbreaks of violence against French
troops in various parts of the occupied
zone yesterday and lastMiight.
The blockade line ran through Dort
mund, Castrop, and Recklinghausen In
an arc of bayonets past which no coal
was permitted to move. Troops were
moved up to reinforce the customs
line; guards were placed on railway
lines; all night long French cavalry
clattered through the streets of Essen;
troop movements were partly shielded
by censorship; everything was quiet
at dawn.
No fuel whatever is to be permitted
to pass from the mines of the Ruhr
valley to German sources outside, ac
cording to French reports.
Simultaneously with this reported
restriction, French guns, tanks, and
machine guns struck warlike attitudes
about Essen and Dusseldorf cities
whose people showed signs of physical
resistance to the Invasion.
From passive sabotage the Ruhr
mood turned Thursday to petty vio
lence, scarcely restrained. French cav
alry was forced to charge a crowd at
Dusseldorf and two Germans were
trampled. At Essen last night there
was a succession of rows between
overheated civilians and French pa
trols, in which stones were hurled by
the former. Bloodshed was averted
only by the restraint shown by the
troops.
LONDON, Jan. 26. —Great Britain
regards the Ruhr situation as serious
and Premier Bonar Law, for one, is
understood to favor immediate with
drawal of British troops from the
Rhine. .
