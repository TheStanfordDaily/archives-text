# SEQUOIA DROPS CONTEST TO PHI KAPPA PSI TEAM
## 
### 
Sequoia Hall first floor team dropped
into a triple tie for first place in
League 3 last night when they lost to
Phi Kappa P*i 19-14. El Tigre defeated
Kappa Sigma 18-10; Theta Delta Chi
won from Delta ITpsilon 15-14, and Phi
Delta Theta beat Zeta Psi 15-7 in the
other intramural contests of the day.
Timmons Is Held in Check and
Sequoia Loses to Phi Kappa Psi
The Sequoia men took the floor last
night with everything to lose and
much to gain. From comparative
scores they had the edge on their op
ponents, having defeated El Tigre 10-4
after El Tigre had won from Phi
Kappa Psi 17-14. But the improvement
of some of the intramural teams has
been rapid since the first game, and
Phi Kappa Psi showed the best brand
of team play they have yet displayed.
The two teams fought neck and neck
during the first half, the score ending
at the end of the period 11-11. Se
quoia made one more field goal than
Phi Kappa Psi during that time but
Wittenburg showed ability at shooting
fouls and evened up the count by mak

ing three out of four free throws.
The second period started with the
same speed as the first but Sequoia
began to slacken pace and with it
came more frequent fouling. Witten
burg continued to sink his free throws
and totaled four before the end of the
game. McAllister shot a field goal for
Phi Kappa Psi while he and Heater
hold Timmons in check and Sequoia
tallied only once during the whole of
the second half.
Timmons was again the star for Se
quoia, making three field goals and
covering the floor with his usual dex
terity. Williard, at center, followed
closely with two field goals and two
free shots. Knox led in the scoring
for Phi Kappa Psi, caging three bas
kets in the first half.
Woodhead Outshoots Middleton
In El Tigre-Kappa Sigma Game
El Tigre got the jump on the Kappa
Sigma players and piled up a fourteen
point lead in the first, half which their
opponents failed to equal in the whole
game. Woodhead was the best shot
with five baskets to his credit and
Butterfield chalked up three. Both men
handled the ball well, dribbling clev
erly around their guards and getting
under the basket for their shots. The
pair together worked a fast offense
which was not easily stopped.
Hey and Eskew tried to break up
the El Tigre passes but were unable
to hold the forward line in check. Mid
dleton showed the best basketball for
Kappa Sigma, scoring three baskets
from the floor while Eskew accounted
for the ermaining score by two other
baskets. The whole Kappa Sigma team
showed little improvement over last
week and lack of practice was evident
in their passing as well as their shoot
ing.
Theta Delta Chi Wins First
Game From Delta Upsilon.
Theta Delta Chi won their first game
of the tournament last night when
they defeated Delta Upsilon 15-14 in a
close contest. By their victory they
tied up the six teams of League 3, the
first three teams tied for first place
with two games won and one lost and
the last three tied for fourth place
with one game won and two lost.
Barham was responsible for most of
the scores of the Theta Delta Chi
team, making five baskets and one
free throw. Lacey nearly equaled him
by making four goals for Delta Up
silon. The two teams were evenly
matched and neither one had a large
lead at any time during the game.
Phi Delta Theta Defeats Zeta Psi;
Driscoll and O'Hara Shoot Well
Phi Delta Theta had little trouble
in taking their game from Zeta Psi
15-7 although the Zeta Psi defense and
offense were much improved over their
two earlier games. However, their im
provement was not sufficient to stop
Driscoll and P. O'Hara who penetrated
the Zeta Psi defense at wlil, only to
miss easy shots when under the bas
ket. Logan followed in fairly well and
managed to shoot three goals after
getting the ball off the backboard.
Solomon was the big gun on the Zeta
Psi team and rushed the ball down to
the basket at a fast clip. His dribbling
was good but he fumbled several times
when under the basket or failed to
pass to his man coming in from the
opposite side of the court.
The games to be played this after
noon are: Alpha Tau Omega and El
Capitan, 5 p. m.; Delta Chi and Alpha
Kappa Lambda, 5:40 p. m.
