Timmons Is Held in Check and
Sequoia Loses to Phi Kappa Psi
The Sequoia men took the floor last
night with everything to lose and
much to gain. From comparative
scores they had the edge on their op
ponents, having defeated El Tigre 10-4
after El Tigre had won from Phi
Kappa Psi 17-14. But the improvement
of some of the intramural teams has
been rapid since the first game, and
Phi Kappa Psi showed the best brand
of team play they have yet displayed.
The two teams fought neck and neck
during the first half, the score ending
at the end of the period 11-11. Se
quoia made one more field goal than
Phi Kappa Psi during that time but
Wittenburg showed ability at shooting
fouls and evened up the count by mak

ing three out of four free throws.
The second period started with the
same speed as the first but Sequoia
began to slacken pace and with it
came more frequent fouling. Witten
burg continued to sink his free throws
and totaled four before the end of the
game. McAllister shot a field goal for
Phi Kappa Psi while he and Heater
hold Timmons in check and Sequoia
tallied only once during the whole of
the second half.
Timmons was again the star for Se
quoia, making three field goals and
covering the floor with his usual dex
terity. Williard, at center, followed
closely with two field goals and two
free shots. Knox led in the scoring
for Phi Kappa Psi, caging three bas
kets in the first half.
