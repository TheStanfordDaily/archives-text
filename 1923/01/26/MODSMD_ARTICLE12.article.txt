# PROFESSOR COOPER WILL LECTURE ON POST-WAR GERMANY
## 
### 
"Five Months in Germany"—a per
sonal observation of economic changes
since the war —will be described by
Professor W. A. Cooper, head of the
Department of Germanic Languages,
next Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre at 7:30.
The downward course of the mark,
comparative figures in the high cost
of living, and what this means to the
German people will be especially em
phasized by the lecturer. During his
visit, which also included Holland and
Switzerland, Professor Cooper studied
the war's disastrous effects upon the
middle classes.
In speaking of this subject recently,
Mr. Cooper said, "Germany's financial
collapse most affected this intermedi
ate group through investments and
professions. Surprisingly enough, doc
tors and lawyers are some of those
hardest hit in this crisis; their fixed
fees were not increased with the de
preciaton of the mark."
Professor Cooper visited several
places of national interest in his tour,
among them, Weimar, the capital city
of the German free state of Thuringia,
where the new constitution was adopt
ed; Heidelberg, the university at
Bonn, where the lecturer studied in
his university days; Marbach, the
birthplace of Schiller; and Oberam
mergau, where the Passion Play was
presented this summer.
