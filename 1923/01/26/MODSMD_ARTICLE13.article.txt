# RAYMOND ROBINS TO GIVE LAST OF SERIES OF LECTURES SUNDAY
## 
### 
Raymond Robins will give the last two
of his series of lectures Sunday before
ending his short stay on the campus. The
first of these will be given at 11 o'clock
in the Memorial Church in place of the
regular Sunday morning sermon, while
the second will be given in the evening
at 7:30 in the Assembly hall.
The subject of Mr. Robins' address in
the Memorial Church will be "Outlaw
ing War, the Next Step in Civilization."
In his evening lecture Mr. Robins will
speak on "Democracy's Only Hope."
Because of limited time, these two lec
tures had to be crowded into Sunday and
one had to be given at the regular ser
vice in the church. This one will not be
in the nature of a sermon, but of the
same type as Mr. Robins' other addresses.
Mr. Robins is the only layman besides
President Rinehart of Mills College who
has ever spoken from the pulpit at a
regular service. Opportunity for asking
questions on any of Mr. Robins' lectures
will be afforded after his last appearance
Sunday evening.
