# Palo Alto Soccerites Tie Freshman Team 1-1
## 
### 
Palo Alto High School soccer play
ers held the freshman eleven to a 1-1
tie on the varsity soccer field yester
day afternoon. As the field was in bad
condition from the rains, the game was
very ragged and of little consequence.
Team work was difficult on the
heavy field. The two scores were made
by bunched play about the goals. Al
though the passing was poor on both
teams, the men received some valu
able individual practice. Shone, the
Babes' center forward, played a con
sistently good game, showing more
fight, than any of his teammates ex
hibited.
Coach Maloney ran in many substi
tutes. giving nearly all his first year
squad a trial. A game will probably
be scheduled next week to give the
teams more practice and to decide the
qustion of superiority on a good field.
