# ANDREYEV COMBINES DRAMATIC POWER AND GAIETY IN "HE"
## Masquers' Presentation of Russian Drama Will Be First in West; Curtain Rises at 8:15 Tonight 
### 
Dramatic power to the nth degree
will be on hand tonight when the cam
pus assembles to see Masquers' pro
duction, "He Who Gets Slapped," pre
sented in the Assembly Hall. The cur
tain will rise at 8:15.
To those who desire a play with real 1
punch instead of Fifth Avenue polish. :
and gripping, life-like lines instead of
idle Broadway chatter, the show to
night should prove entirely satisfac
tory. In additon, it will probably prove
so even to those who are not so sure !
they care for a drama of actual life 1
rather than one of artificial life. An- 1
dreyev has succeeded in injecting
dramatic vigor into a topic which, al
though familiar, probably could get
along without any stimulus at that.
But the stimulus helps immensely.
Revealing the plot before the cur
tain goes up is one of the two surest
ways to miss getting the full force of
the drama. (The other way is by not
attending). It is enough beforehand
to state that "He" carries sufficient
punch, particularly in the fourth act,
to lift at least a portion of the audi
ence right out of their seats. There is
a rumor that a secret betting pool is
being formed among those who have
seen rehearsals, as to how many
shriekfs and gasps will waft through
the Assembly atmosphere when a cur
tain moment in act four arrives. So
far the wagering is fairly conserva
tive, twenty shrieks and thirty-five
gasps being the largest number offered
on even money.

The campus is awaiting with inter
est the showing of Edythe Baylis,
Peggy Richardson, and A. D. Cohan in
three of the leading parts. These are
the roles which call for the most emo
| tional acting, the most careful dis
j crimination between effectiveness and
burlesque. From all this, however, it
must not be supposed the play is one
long line of "heavy" stuff, with much
! sighing and weeping and declamation.
Andreyev has cleverly arranged the
moments in his plot so that gayety and
seriousness come at the right intervals
to complement and enforce each other.
The atmosphere of the circus offers
plenty of opportunity for any comedy
that should be inserted.
Lighting effects unlike anything ever
seen on the campus stage will be an
other feature of tonight's offering. Di
rector Richard Bentinck has adopted the
modern trend of stage illumination, leav
ing out entirely the traditional footlights,
and depending most upon a series of col
ored spots hung overhead. The one man
who is most responsible for the success
or failure of the novel lighting scheme is
Ernest Greppin, who has furnished the
largest part, not only of the actual labor
required, but also of the involved techni
cal ideas necessary to the arrangement.
Greppin's lighting effects remove the usual
glare that makes the faces on the stage
appear pasty and lifeless, and throws
shadows at various angles that cause
the whole scene to appear more true to
life, and, incidentally, easier to the eyes.
