# Athletic Board Denies Warner Contract Story
## 
### 
Emphatic denial of the assertion which
appeared in a San Francisco newspaper
this morning to the effect that Glenn
Warner has been given a contract for
$14,000 a year as head coach at Stanford,
his assistants to be paid from this
amonnt, was made today bv a member of
the Board of Athletic Control.
' Warner was appointed for a five
year term, but he was not given a con
tract. He is at perfect liberty to resign
at any time, and the University has a
1 ike privilege to force his resignation if
necessary. But neither Warner nor the
University will do it." No mention has
ever been made as to his salary.
