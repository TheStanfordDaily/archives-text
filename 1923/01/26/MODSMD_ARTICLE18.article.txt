# GOVERNMENT RESTS ON LIVING FAITH OF PEOPLE—ROBINS

### 
"Bolshevism in Russia was caused by
the death of the people's faith in their
old institutions," was the sentiment ex
pressed by Raymond Robins in his lec
jture on "Bolshevism" in Memorial
Church last night.
"There is no nation in Europe that
, can meet the challenge of Russia today
: because the mass support is insecure,"
continued Mr. Robins. "The United
; States can meet the challenge because
i the institutions of the United States are
! well grounded in the faith of the Ameri
can people. We actually believe in them.
IWe believe that all our hopes can be
realized within the Constitution and the
law. The stability of our constitutional
government rests upon the fact that it
, has never been a class government. An
other factor contributing to the stability
j of our goverftment is the institution of
religion. In Europe men and women
are divorced from sympathy with the
! church because it has been used to serve
class interests instead of those of the
| people. Our economic institutions are
sound also. We believe in the capital
system, that is, production for profit,
while in Europe the economic institution
is largely a feudal survival. Com
munism wasn't a success in Russia be
■ cause it didn't produce. We actually pro
duce. We preserve the power and au
thority of the producing economic in
telligence," continued Mr. Robins.
