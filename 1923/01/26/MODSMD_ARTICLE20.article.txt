# COMPULSION OR CO-OPERATION?

Democratic Stanford will never admit that "Might
makes right." No Stanford undergraduate will ad
mit that what lie has achieved during his college
career has been due to any principle of force. No
member of the faculty favors any system of educa
tion which necessitates the cramming of information
down students' necks. Like the much-discussed
horse which was lead to water but refused to drink,
Stanford people may be forced against their will to
conform to tradition, but the reasons for the exist
ence of tradition are thus defeated.
It appears that at the University of California cer
tain student leaders favor freshman hazing. At
least, they are quoted in newspapers to that effect.
This is something of a surprise coming from the
largest university in the United States, when almost
all but cow colleges have dropped freshman disci
pline, particularly forcible forms of it, as antiquated
and unbecoming a modern educational age. Stan
ford dropped it long ago. But so far as that is con
cerned, the United States dropped liquor not long
ago with something of a Miraculous Pitcher effect.
The custom of hazing was dropped, but it was re
silient enough to keep on bouncing. The time has
come to bat it out of the lot.
Freshmen come to Stanford enthusiastic and
eager. They are filled with curiosities and ambi
tions. They want to become a part of this great,
new institution of which they are logically supposed
to be a small element. Within a week the eagerness
is diverted into other channels. The enthusiasm is
squelched. The freshman is relegated to the lowest
possible social order and there he stays while he re
mains a freshman. lie is not a part of the University-
He is apart from it. He simply isn't in.
The ordinary freshman if taken in hand the first
few days may be helped in a hundred ways without
the use of force. He need not be embittered by com
pulsion to get results. He needs only a little advice,
a little whole-hearted association with upperclassmen
who are sensible enough to leave "seniority" at home-
The freshman should be accepted with reservations,
not rejected without reservation. He should be given
a chance before he is condemned. Co-operation may
certainly replace compulsion in this department of
undergraduate life.
There are, on the other hand, freshmen who arc
pampered until they get an inflated opinion of them
selves. They think they own the earth. That, too,
is the undergraduates' fault. If a freshman athlete
becomes insufferable because he thinks the University
can't get along without him, he is pampered still
more, and sophomores and upperclassmen turn in
disgust to some lesser light who has not offended,
but is their "meat" because he is a freshman. The
much-rushed, over-popular fly-by-night is never the
goat until he gets a grade card with fifteen hours of
minus on it. Thus the guilty party flunks out and
the guiltless party is the goat in the meantime. The
same system of co-operation and upperclass advice
and assistance can produce the desired results in the
case of both extremes. The present supposedly non T
existent tradition of freshman discipline is certainly
ripe, evidently over-ripe. It will be a pity if it has
not given way to a substitute before the vear is out.
