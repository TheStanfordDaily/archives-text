# THE
						BASIS OF SCHOLARSHIP AWARDS
## 
### 
It is the custom of many universities to award
scholarships to students who have been exceptionally
capable in their class work. Some scholarships have
been extended to other fields, but most of them are
based purely on academic records. Such is by
necessity the chief factor to be considered in the
allotment of awards.
Other factors should l>e considered, however. It
is an open question whether or not the man who

makes an "A" average should be given preference
over one who makes a "D-plus" average, providing
the latter has done a large amount of outside work
and the former has done nothing but study. He is
indeed a poor student who has nothing to do but to
pore over his books who fails to make at least a
near "A" average. It is difficult to see why any
great distinction should be accorded him for his
achievement if he has done nothing else. The man
who works for all or a part of the money which sends
him through college, and who at the same time main
tains or betters a "B" average certainly should have
at least an equal chance for a scholarship. And,
moreover, it is likely that he will be the party most
in need of it.
