# CARD GRAPPLERS AND BOXERS LEAVE TODAY TO MEET DAVIS FARM
## 
### 
Thirteen Stanford boxers and
wrestlers will leave at 7:32 this eve
ning for Sacramento where they will
meet the Davis Farm representatives
in the first boxing and wrestling tour
ney of the year tomorrow night. Ma
loney is taking a well-balanced team
and he thinks prospects are good for
the Cards to bring home a victory.
The wrestlers to make the trip were
announced yesterday. Sturm will be
the representative in the 125-pound
class. He has made his letter in wres
tling for the past two years and seems
to be one of Stanford's best bets. The
135-pound class will be taken care of
by Hosepian who has wen his letter
for three years. He has been coaching
the wrestlers in the different classes
this year. Severs will wrestle in the
145-pound class. Tomorrow night will
be his first public match.
Woodhead will take care of the 158-
pound class. He has had much experi
ence, although, like Severs, this is
his first appearance for the Cardinal.
In the 175-pound class Nicholsen will
be seen. Fullerton is the heavyweight
representative; he understands the
wrestling game and is a valuable man
for the team.
Van Hook is the heavyweight boxer.
He has had experience and can take
more punishment than anyone else on
the team. This is his first match for
Stanford, as it is also the first match
for the other members of the team.
McKee is the 175-pound representative.
Irwin is the 158-pound boxer. His foot
work is good and he has a dangerous
punch. The 145-pound class will be
handled by Adams. Paine is the 125-
pound representative and Hard is the
choice in the 115-pound class. All three
of these men are fast and accurate
hitters.
Maloney expects most of the bouts
and matches at Davis to be evenly
fought. The Davis lads are strong and
in good physical condition. Both
wrestling and boxing are popular at
Davis and the coaches there have a
large number from which to select
their teams.
The Cards wiH return sometime
Sunday. Next week Maloney will start
training the team for the return match
which will take place February 27 in
the Stanford gymnasium.
