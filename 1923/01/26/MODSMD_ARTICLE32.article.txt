# WEIGHT TEAM WILL MEET CALIFORNIA QINTET TONIGHT
## 
### 
After chalking up three victories
against Peninsula high schools by
overwhelming scores and with four
weeks of strenuous practice, Stanford's
130-pound basketball team will be in
excellent condition to meet the fast
and experienced California 130-pound
quintet on the Berkeley floor tonight.
Both Young and Bertrand have been
working hard improving the team's
offensive and defensive work; the
lightweights have been a bit weak in
their passing, but it is believed that
this week's practice will have ironed
out any such deficiency. In the of
fenseive the i3o's are everything that
could be asked, and their opponents'
low scores in recent games prove that
they do not lack defensive strength.
'"Bud" Young, a veteran of last
year's champion 130-pound team, has
starred at the running guard berth all
season. Not only can "Bud" play guard
to good advantage, but he can drop
the ball through the hoop when the
occasion demands; his experience and
aggressiveness have made him the
most capable, all-around player on the
squad.
Meyer, a forward on last year's five,
has been a consistent scorer in all the
games thus far. He is fast and elusive
and gets most of his shots under the
goal. Meyers showed up well in the
San Mateo game, scoring eight of the
fifteen winning points.
