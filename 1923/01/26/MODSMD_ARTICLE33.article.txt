# AMERICAN LEGION TO PLAY SOCCER SUNDAY
## 
### 
At 3 o'clock next Sunday afternoon,
the American Legion soccer team will
meet the Sons of St. George on the
Palo Alto Community Grounds. Due
to the game with California scheduled
for Saturday at San Mateo, Trafalgar
was forced to postpone her game with
the American Legion to the following
day. According to Coach Harry Ma
loney, director of minor sports, the
Trafalgar aggregation is a team
and the American Legion eleven will
have to keep hustling if they want to
win. The American Legion team is
composed of Stanford Alumni who
fought in the World War and several
of whom were formerly on the var
sity. The Alumni line-up includes such
stars as Jimmie Quinby, "Pnk" Mc-
Gilvrey, "Bige" Clark, Jimmie Adams,
and "Lon" Price.
