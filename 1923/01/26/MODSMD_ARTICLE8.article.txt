# FIRST YEAR FIVE TO PLAY CUBS SATURDAY
## Varsity Meets St. Mary's In Final Preliminary Game 
### 
As the final preliminary game be
fore starting the Pacific Coast Con
ference schedule, Kerr's basketball
varsity will meet the Saint Mary's
squad tomorrow in the Pavilion. The
game will be played contrary to the
usual arrangement, starting at 7:15
and preceding the California-Stanford
freshman game.
Saint Mary's in the old days turned
out basketball teams that were among
the best on the Coast and frequently
the Saints finished first in the old
California-Nevada Intercollegiate Bas
ketball League. About three years ago,
however, the Oakland school suffered
a slump in all branches of athletics I
and although baseball and football are;
back in their former rating, the bas
ketball teams from across the bay
have not afforded much competition
in the last three years.
Word comes from St. Mary's this j
year that Coach Madigan is building up
a team that will again place the Saints >
at the top in Coast basketball. With a
practically new team, Madigan has j
worked up an offense with Lawless and
Lester as a nucleus in which he bases
most of his sterngth. Although Lester
is the only veteran on the squad, the ma
jority of the players have had the ex
perience of playing together on the St.
Mary's prep school five.
Lester and Lawless are both forwards
with the reputation of being good shots,
while Coach Madigan has a good man
in Paynter at center. Conlon will be
used at running guard and Nelson, a
veteran on the Saints' football team, will
probably sta#t the game at the other
guard position. For reserves, Madigan
will have Loregan, Lane, and Murdock
to rely upon.
The Stanford game will be the first
intercollegiate game for St. Mary's this!
year, and it is in this game that they J
plan to establish their comeback. At the j
same time Coach Andy Kerr has his j
mind set upon going through the pre- i
liminary season without a defeat. Both j
teams are in the best shape, and al- j
though the game tomorrow night is
scheduled as a preliminary to the fresh
man contest, it gives promise of draw- i
ing considerable interest.
Tonight at Los Angeles the University
of California squad opens its Pacific!
Coast Conference schedule against the i
Trojans. Nothing is known of the j
strength of the U. S. C. team, with the |
exception of tHe usual gloomy rumors j
issuing from the south. Next Friday and ,
Saturday, the Cardinal squad will play;
the southerners here in a two-game series.

With the first game of the Stanford-'
I California freshman basketball series,
scheduled for tomorrow night, the annual
i wail goes up, "Its the worst team in
years, Stanfprd hasn't a chance." The!
team is not the worst in years, and the i
: Cardinal babes have a chance to win, re- 1
! mote as it may seem.
Without a doubt, the early season rec-:
i ord of the Babes is far from impressive.!
This is the way it reads: Freshmen 19,'
Fremont High School 14; Freshmen 7, j
San Jose High School 14; Freshmen 42, 1
Lowell High School 12; Freshmen 22,;
Li'vermore High School 13; Freshmen'
: 37, Sacramento High School 11; Fresh
men 13, Piedmont High School 28.
Two defeats in six games with high
; school teams seems to indicate that the j
yearlings have not an exceptional team.
They haven't. They are an "in and out"!
aggregation. In the last half of the i
: Sacramento game they played good bas
i ketball. Their playing in the Piedmont
! game couldn't have been much worse.
The Piedmont lads had an exceptional
team for a high school and the Babes
j would have been pushed to win from
i them by playing their best brand of bas
ketball. When Hunt's team took that
14-7 lacing from San Jose High School
something went wrong again. They
coudn't find the basket nor could they
stop the scoring of their opponents.
In parts of the Sacramento and Liver
more games, the freshmen looked like
a basketball team, while in other parts
they looked like five individuals possess
ing no knowledge of the game. If the
law of percentage means anything, they
should be due for some of the breaks
tomorrow night.
Report*; of the Bruin cubs indicate that!
they have a strong aggregation. They j
have failed to taste defeat this year and,
! Hunt's team will have to travel at top j
| speed to break that string of victories.
The Card babes will line up about as ;
follows tomorrow night: Nevers and
Frazier forwards, Carter or Morrison
i center, and McDermot and Captain
Mitchell guards.
That forward combination is a hard
I nne to stop when both men are in good j
form. Nevers is big and fast and plays:
the best floor game of any man on the
squad. At times he can be counted on j
to score frequently, while sometimes he'
-is unable to find the hoop at all. Frazier
jis a surer man on baskets and should
: cause the Cub guards a great deal of!
; trouble.
Hunt could easily decide his choice for:
the center job by a toss of the coin.!
I Both Carter and Morrison have had their |
j share of work in the preliminary games
land neither has a lease on the job. Car
[ter has shown improvement in the last
i few games, while Morrison has been
| out with a bad ankle, but seems to have
a slight edge.
j McDermot at standing guard and
Mitchell at running guard form a pow
erful defensive combination which the
Blue and Gold freshmen may be unable
to solve. McDermot is a steady, con
| sistent. and hard working man, and can
be counted on at all times. Mitchell is !
fast and handles the ball well. He had,
!an off-night against Piedmont and is
: due to come back strong tomorrow night.
The freshman game will be the main!
i battle of the evening and will .start at
8:15 o'clock.

With the first game of the Stanford-'
I California freshman basketball series,
scheduled for tomorrow night, the annual
i wail goes up, "Its the worst team in
years, Stanfprd hasn't a chance." The!
team is not the worst in years, and the i
: Cardinal babes have a chance to win, re- 1
! mote as it may seem.
Without a doubt, the early season rec-:
i ord of the Babes is far from impressive.!
This is the way it reads: Freshmen 19,'
Fremont High School 14; Freshmen 7, j
San Jose High School 14; Freshmen 42, 1
Lowell High School 12; Freshmen 22,;
Li'vermore High School 13; Freshmen'
: 37, Sacramento High School 11; Fresh
men 13, Piedmont High School 28.
Two defeats in six games with high
; school teams seems to indicate that the j
yearlings have not an exceptional team.
They haven't. They are an "in and out"!
aggregation. In the last half of the i
: Sacramento game they played good bas
i ketball. Their playing in the Piedmont
! game couldn't have been much worse.
The Piedmont lads had an exceptional
team for a high school and the Babes
j would have been pushed to win from
i them by playing their best brand of bas
ketball. When Hunt's team took that
14-7 lacing from San Jose High School
something went wrong again. They
coudn't find the basket nor could they
stop the scoring of their opponents.
In parts of the Sacramento and Liver
more games, the freshmen looked like
a basketball team, while in other parts
they looked like five individuals possess
ing no knowledge of the game. If the
law of percentage means anything, they
should be due for some of the breaks
tomorrow night.
Report*; of the Bruin cubs indicate that!
they have a strong aggregation. They j
have failed to taste defeat this year and,
! Hunt's team will have to travel at top j
| speed to break that string of victories.
The Card babes will line up about as ;
follows tomorrow night: Nevers and
Frazier forwards, Carter or Morrison
i center, and McDermot and Captain
Mitchell guards.
That forward combination is a hard
I nne to stop when both men are in good j
form. Nevers is big and fast and plays:
the best floor game of any man on the
squad. At times he can be counted on j
to score frequently, while sometimes he'
-is unable to find the hoop at all. Frazier
jis a surer man on baskets and should
: cause the Cub guards a great deal of!
; trouble.
Hunt could easily decide his choice for:
the center job by a toss of the coin.!
I Both Carter and Morrison have had their |
j share of work in the preliminary games
land neither has a lease on the job. Car
[ter has shown improvement in the last
i few games, while Morrison has been
| out with a bad ankle, but seems to have
a slight edge.
j McDermot at standing guard and
Mitchell at running guard form a pow
erful defensive combination which the
Blue and Gold freshmen may be unable
to solve. McDermot is a steady, con
| sistent. and hard working man, and can
be counted on at all times. Mitchell is !
fast and handles the ball well. He had,
!an off-night against Piedmont and is
: due to come back strong tomorrow night.
The freshman game will be the main!
i battle of the evening and will .start at
8:15 o'clock.
As the final preliminary game be
fore starting the Pacific Coast Con
ference schedule, Kerr's basketball
varsity will meet the Saint Mary's
squad tomorrow in the Pavilion. The
game will be played contrary to the
usual arrangement, starting at 7:15
and preceding the California-Stanford
freshman game.
Saint Mary's in the old days turned
out basketball teams that were among
the best on the Coast and frequently
the Saints finished first in the old
California-Nevada Intercollegiate Bas
ketball League. About three years ago,
however, the Oakland school suffered
a slump in all branches of athletics I
and although baseball and football are;
back in their former rating, the bas
ketball teams from across the bay
have not afforded much competition
in the last three years.

a team that will again place the Saints >
at the top in Coast basketball. With a
practically new team, Madigan has j

I California freshman basketball series,
scheduled for tomorrow night, the annual
i wail goes up, "Its the worst team in
years, Stanfprd hasn't a chance." The!
team is not the worst in years, and the i
: Cardinal babes have a chance to win, re- 1
! mote as it may seem.
Without a doubt, the early season rec-:
i ord of the Babes is far from impressive.!
This is the way it reads: Freshmen 19,'
Fremont High School 14; Freshmen 7, j
San Jose High School 14; Freshmen 42, 1
Lowell High School 12; Freshmen 22,;
Li'vermore High School 13; Freshmen'
: 37, Sacramento High School 11; Fresh
men 13, Piedmont High School 28.
Two defeats in six games with high
; school teams seems to indicate that the j
yearlings have not an exceptional team.
They haven't. They are an "in and out"!
aggregation. In the last half of the i
: Sacramento game they played good bas
i ketball. Their playing in the Piedmont
! game couldn't have been much worse.
The Piedmont lads had an exceptional
team for a high school and the Babes
j would have been pushed to win from
i them by playing their best brand of bas
ketball. When Hunt's team took that
14-7 lacing from San Jose High School
something went wrong again. They
coudn't find the basket nor could they
stop the scoring of their opponents.
In parts of the Sacramento and Liver
more games, the freshmen looked like
a basketball team, while in other parts
they looked like five individuals possess
ing no knowledge of the game. If the
law of percentage means anything, they
should be due for some of the breaks
tomorrow night.
Report*; of the Bruin cubs indicate that!
they have a strong aggregation. They j
have failed to taste defeat this year and,
! Hunt's team will have to travel at top j
| speed to break that string of victories.
The Card babes will line up about as ;
follows tomorrow night: Nevers and
Frazier forwards, Carter or Morrison
i center, and McDermot and Captain
Mitchell guards.
That forward combination is a hard
I nne to stop when both men are in good j
form. Nevers is big and fast and plays:
the best floor game of any man on the
squad. At times he can be counted on j
to score frequently, while sometimes he'
-is unable to find the hoop at all. Frazier
jis a surer man on baskets and should
: cause the Cub guards a great deal of!
; trouble.
Hunt could easily decide his choice for:
the center job by a toss of the coin.!
I Both Carter and Morrison have had their |
j share of work in the preliminary games
land neither has a lease on the job. Car
[ter has shown improvement in the last
i few games, while Morrison has been
| out with a bad ankle, but seems to have
a slight edge.
j McDermot at standing guard and
Mitchell at running guard form a pow
erful defensive combination which the
Blue and Gold freshmen may be unable
to solve. McDermot is a steady, con
| sistent. and hard working man, and can
be counted on at all times. Mitchell is !
fast and handles the ball well. He had,
!an off-night against Piedmont and is
: due to come back strong tomorrow night.
The freshman game will be the main!
i battle of the evening and will .start at
8:15 o'clock.
As the final preliminary game be
fore starting the Pacific Coast Con
ference schedule, Kerr's basketball
varsity will meet the Saint Mary's
squad tomorrow in the Pavilion. The
game will be played contrary to the
usual arrangement, starting at 7:15
and preceding the California-Stanford
freshman game.
Saint Mary's in the old days turned
out basketball teams that were among
the best on the Coast and frequently
the Saints finished first in the old
California-Nevada Intercollegiate Bas
ketball League. About three years ago,
however, the Oakland school suffered
a slump in all branches of athletics I
and although baseball and football are;
back in their former rating, the bas
ketball teams from across the bay
have not afforded much competition
in the last three years.
Word comes from St. Mary's this j
year that Coach Madigan is building up
a team that will again place the Saints >
at the top in Coast basketball. With a
practically new team, Madigan has j
worked up an offense with Lawless and
Lester as a nucleus in which he bases
most of his sterngth. Although Lester
is the only veteran on the squad, the ma
jority of the players have had the ex
perience of playing together on the St.
Mary's prep school five.
Lester and Lawless are both forwards
with the reputation of being good shots,
while Coach Madigan has a good man
in Paynter at center. Conlon will be
used at running guard and Nelson, a
veteran on the Saints' football team, will
probably sta#t the game at the other
guard position. For reserves, Madigan
will have Loregan, Lane, and Murdock
to rely upon.
The Stanford game will be the first
intercollegiate game for St. Mary's this!
year, and it is in this game that they J
plan to establish their comeback. At the j
same time Coach Andy Kerr has his j
mind set upon going through the pre- i
liminary season without a defeat. Both j
teams are in the best shape, and al- j
though the game tomorrow night is
scheduled as a preliminary to the fresh
man contest, it gives promise of draw- i
ing considerable interest.
Tonight at Los Angeles the University
of California squad opens its Pacific!

Trojans. Nothing is known of the j
strength of the U. S. C. team, with the |
exception of tHe usual gloomy rumors j
issuing from the south. Next Friday and ,
Saturday, the Cardinal squad will play;
the southerners here in a two-game series.
