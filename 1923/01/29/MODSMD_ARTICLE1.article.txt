## INSURGENT INCENDIARIES DESTROY IRISH MAIL TRAINS 
### (By United Press 
DUBLIN, Jan. 29. â€”Blazing mail
trains, fired by insurgent incendiaries,
were sent, one after another, smashing
into a great heap of wreckage across
the Wexford-Dublin line at Inniscorthy
as part of a great rebel activity that
developed over the week-end. Attacks
Sunday on Governor General Healy's
residence were part of the demonstra
tion against the Free State.
The Dublin mail was held up in
County Wexford and set on fire, after
which the attackers tore up rails at
the foot of a decline and sent the train
down to destruction. Two other trains
were captured and sent hurtling down
into the blazing wreckage.
