# ROBINS DISCUSSES OUTLAWRY OF WAR BY PUBLIC OPINION
## Raymond Robins Compares Needs of U.S. and Foreign Nations in Final Lecture 
### 
Outlawery of war as the next step in
civilization was discussed by Raymond
! Robins in his address at Memorial
Church Sunday morning.
"War must be outlawed and made a
[ crime under international code. This is
the one effective method in the 'war
against war.' Gladly as we supported the
limitation of armaments conference, no
limitation of armaments to any effective
degree is possible so long as war is the
legal method of settling all questions of
justice and right between the nations of j
the world."
Robins said that war pan be ended by,
first, "a campaign of education to change j
the mind and conscience of the peoples '
of the world in\relation to war. We
must work until we cease to think of war
as a honorable profession, as a path to
glory and power and national greatness.
And, secondly, we must create an irre
sistible public opinion demanding the es
tablishment of an international court with
jurisdiction to try and give judgment
on all questions of international justice
between nations.
"The greatest unused political and
social power for human welfare today is
the unorganized good will of everyday
man. The will to end the war in the
common mind must be made articulate
and no sovereign responsible government
will dare to oppose this demand of sov
ereign will.
"All agencies for education, religion,
and the relief of human need have suf
fered loss from the poverty and high
taxation resulting from the war. We
cannot continue our program for the lib
eration of life from ignorance and in
dustrial slavery under the system of so
ciety. Let us outlaw war, reduce tax
ation. and use our surplus for productive
industry in education, religion and in
dustrial betterments, and have done with
war-breeding armaments."
