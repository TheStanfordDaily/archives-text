# CARDINAL FRESHMEN LOSE TO BEAR CUBS AFTER A HARD FICHT
## Two Quintets Battle on Even Terms Until Last Minutes; Final Score Is 20 to 17 
### 
By Donald Liebendorfer
And now, ladies and gentlemen, doff
your hats to one of the hardest fight
ing teams that ever wore the Cardinal
numerals —the 1926 basketball aggre
gation.
Led by Ernie Nevers and Captain
"Mugs" Mitchell, the babes played the
Blue and Gold yearlings to a stand
still in the Pavilion Saturday night
and the Bear Cubs were lucky to come
out on the long end of a 20-17 score.
Sympathy Wasted
Most of the cash customers expected
the Cardinal freshmen to be buried
under an avalanche of baskets and
many went for the sole purpose of
sympathizing with them.
Their sympathy wasn't needed for |
there was no avalanche.
Not only did Hunt's aggregation ex
hibit a world of fight, but every man
who got into the fracas played his best
game of the year. Never did more than
I
five points separate the two teams,
j Carter, who started at center for the
j Cardinal babes, opened hostilities be-;
fore the game had gone a minute by !
! sinking one from under the basket.
Slow Start
Both teams were slow in getting
under way and the score remained at
2-0 for several minutes.
When the Card yearlings discovered
that the cubs were not particularly
dangerous, and the Blue and Gold I
youngsters discovered that they were j
on the short end of the score, the fun 1
began.
The guards were bearing down on
their men and the game developed
into a battle between Nevers and
Butts, star cub forward.
Score at Half
Butts was not holding his own on
the floor game, but he made up for
this by his consistent accuracy in find
ing the hoop. He sunk a pretty one
just as the half ended and the score
was 13-10 with the cubs in the lead.
The Cardinal f reshmen got a big
when they came on the floor for
the second half and showed their ap
preciation by jumping into the lead in
the first three minutes. Frazier caged j
one from side court and Carter fol
lowed suit a few seconds later from
under the basket.
In the meantime. Butts had con-
verted a free throw into a point and
the count stood knotted at 14-14. That
looked encouraging, especially when
Nevers gave his team the lead with
a free throw a minute later.
Three Goals Shot in Final
At this point, the cub forwards got
into action. Butts and Levitt accounted
for three field baskets while the Card
babes could tally but a single point.
Carter brought their total to 17 and it
looked as if Hunt's team was due for
a rally, but the timer's gun ended
hostilities.
Ernie Nevers was the outstanding
player of the game. He scored seven
points and was easily the best all
around man on either team.
"Mugs" Mitchell played well on the
defensive and fed to the forwards con
sistently. Carter played his best game
of the year at center, scoring six
points. Frazier accounted for the other
four points.
McDermont, at standing guard, was
the only man to play the whole game
and he kept the babes' goal clear most
of the time.
Butts at forward and Carver, stand
ing guard, did the best work for the
cubs.
Three points just about represents
the difference between the two teams
but as to whether the better team got
the edge Saturday night is hard to
say. That will be decided when they
tangle at Berkeley in the second game,
two weeks hence.

the count stood knotted at 14-14. That
looked encouraging, especially when
Nevers gave his team the lead with
a free throw a minute later.
Three Goals Shot in Final
At this point, the cub forwards got
into action. Butts and Levitt accounted
for three field baskets while the Card
babes could tally but a single point.
Carter brought their total to 17 and it
looked as if Hunt's team was due for
a rally, but the timer's gun ended
hostilities.
Ernie Nevers was the outstanding
player of the game. He scored seven
points and was easily the best all
around man on either team.
"Mugs" Mitchell played well on the
defensive and fed to the forwards con
sistently. Carter played his best game
of the year at center, scoring six
points. Frazier accounted for the other
four points.
McDermont, at standing guard, was
the only man to play the whole game
and he kept the babes' goal clear most
of the time.
Butts at forward and Carver, stand
ing guard, did the best work for the
cubs.
Three points just about represents
the difference between the two teams
but as to whether the better team got
the edge Saturday night is hard to
say. That will be decided when they
tangle at Berkeley in the second game,
two weeks hence.
