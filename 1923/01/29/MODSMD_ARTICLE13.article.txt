# Dramatic Situations Hold Audience in Performance of "He Who Gets Slapped"
## 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
The big battle is now on between
those who like to go to a show and
sleep and those who want to see some
thing when they do go.
The former are declaring in no un
certain terms that "He Who Gets
Slapped," presented by Masquers So
ciety Friday evening in the Assem
bly Hall, was a "queer" show, and not
the kind that a bunch of collegiate
amateurs should try at all.
The latter are glad that the show
was "queer"—it was something differ
ent, at least, from the ordinary stand
ardized, labeled Broadway farce that
the campus has been surfeited with
for some time.
Furthermore, judging from the atti
tude of the majority of the audience,
they were interested from start to
finish. The tenseness of the dramatic
situations of the play made itself felt
all over the hall, and the sound of a
pin whistling through the air as it
dropped could have been heard in
many places.
The show was a success —decidedly
so. It is quite true that that kind of a
drama can not be, and was not, han
dled as well as it should be to bring
out its full force. But what kind of a
play can campus actors handle abso
lutely perfectly? Nobody expects it.
It does not seem a rash statement
to say that Andreyev's drama was pre
sented as well as any other kind of a
play could have been. Looking back
over some of the farces that have been
given in the past few years, the ob
server can see that the majority of
them were far less successful presenta
tions than "He."
The fact that Saturday night's per

jformance did hold the audience with
; intense interest, and that it did, there
fore, "go over," is due primarily to
one man—A. D. Cohan, playing the
title role. This can be said without
slighting any other member of the
cast, for the construction of the play
was such that its success hung upon
the success of Cohan. He gave his
part the full force it demanded, and
whenever the show started to drag, he
pulled it out of the rut and gave it a
fresh start.
Cohan's performance was by far the
best individual showing made on the
campus stage this season, and anyone
who surpasses it will have to do very
well indeed. His part called for a
dramatic presentation of emotions
without crossing the danger line of
burlesque, and ,he fulfilled the re- ,
quirements with a certainty that left
no doubt as to who was chiefly re
sponsible for the success of the show.
Next in order of effectiveness was
Delmer Daves, who imparted to the
role of Count Mancini an air that was
far from stereotyped. He made the
Italian "nobleman" a mixture of vil
lainy and comic relief that was wel
come when the heavy parts of the play
began to predominate too much. Indi
viduality was the chief asset of his
performance.
Edythe Baylis, as Zinida, had the
hardest part in the play to put across;
but she played her role with an earn
estness that was convincing. She was
especially effective in her facial ex
| pressions and her movements about
the stage, and was not afraid to put
into her part all the emotion it re
quired.
