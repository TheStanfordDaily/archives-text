# Dramatic Situations Hold Audience in Performance of "He Who Gets Slapped"
## 
### Carl Shoup, '24 
The big battle is now on between
those who like to go to a show and
sleep and those who want to see some
thing when they do go.
The former are declaring in no un
certain terms that "He Who Gets
Slapped," presented by Masquers So
ciety Friday evening in the Assem
bly Hall, was a "queer" show, and not
the kind that a bunch of collegiate
amateurs should try at all.
The latter are glad that the show
was "queer"—it was something differ
ent, at least, from the ordinary stand
ardized, labeled Broadway farce that
the campus has been surfeited with
for some time.
Furthermore, judging from the atti
tude of the majority of the audience,
they were interested from start to
finish. The tenseness of the dramatic
situations of the play made itself felt
all over the hall, and the sound of a
pin whistling through the air as it
dropped could have been heard in
many places.
The show was a success —decidedly
so. It is quite true that that kind of a
drama can not be, and was not, han
dled as well as it should be to bring
out its full force. But what kind of a
play can campus actors handle abso
lutely perfectly? Nobody expects it.
It does not seem a rash statement
to say that Andreyev's drama was pre
sented as well as any other kind of a
play could have been. Looking back
over some of the farces that have been
given in the past few years, the ob
server can see that the majority of
them were far less successful presenta
tions than "He."
The fact that Saturday night's per

jformance did hold the audience with
; intense interest, and that it did, there
fore, "go over," is due primarily to
one man—A. D. Cohan, playing the
title role. This can be said without
slighting any other member of the
cast, for the construction of the play
was such that its success hung upon
the success of Cohan. He gave his
part the full force it demanded, and
whenever the show started to drag, he
pulled it out of the rut and gave it a
fresh start.
Cohan's performance was by far the
best individual showing made on the
campus stage this season, and anyone
who surpasses it will have to do very
well indeed. His part called for a
dramatic presentation of emotions
without crossing the danger line of
burlesque, and ,he fulfilled the re- ,
quirements with a certainty that left
no doubt as to who was chiefly re
sponsible for the success of the show.
Next in order of effectiveness was
Delmer Daves, who imparted to the
role of Count Mancini an air that was
far from stereotyped. He made the
Italian "nobleman" a mixture of vil
lainy and comic relief that was wel
come when the heavy parts of the play
began to predominate too much. Indi
viduality was the chief asset of his
performance.
Edythe Baylis, as Zinida, had the
hardest part in the play to put across;
but she played her role with an earn
estness that was convincing. She was
especially effective in her facial ex
| pressions and her movements about
the stage, and was not afraid to put
into her part all the emotion it re
quired.
Consuelo, "The Equestrian Tango
Queen," played by Peggy Richard
son, had the merit of appearing con
sistent throughout, although there was
not the quality of real acting present
to such a marked degree as in the
other leads. The fact that it was a
difficult task to keep the role of Con
suelo, that of the young circus girl,
all through the four acts, made the
consistency of the performance the
more commendable.
Stoddard Atwood made a likeable cir
cus manager. Those who have been more
closely connected with circuscs can tell
us better whether or not Atwood was
hard-boiled enough. Murray Ward, as
Baron Regnard, had to stand still and
look hard most of the time, and he did
the same effectively enough. Charles
Benedict had the bearing necessary to the
impetuous lover of Consuelo. Charles
Cross, as Jackson, the chief clown, han-i
died his part acceptably.
Tilly and Polly, the musical clowns,
played by Charles Parks and Alexander,
had a good deal to do with giving the,
proper circus atmosphere. The rest of
the characters had little or nothing to do, J
and usually whenever they were called
on, did not come through very well.
For "He Who Gets Slapped," the ham
mer can knock most resoundingly on
minor points and minor characters. The
four leads, the stage setting, and the gen
eral groupings were good enough; but
without picking individual flaws, it can
be said that the secondary leads, as
named, and the long list of minor char
acters, were not up to average. Then
there are complaints to make about the
curtain sticking—a little incident which
will mar any show—the person off-stage
who evokes a titter from the audience
at a crucial moment by dropping what
sounds like a tray of chinaware; and the
modern but rather ineffective lighting. .
The lighting scheme was the result of
much hard work on the part of those
concerned, but it was not sufficient, es
pecially for those back of the first fifteen
rows. Much of the facial expressions
of the actors were thus lost. It was
very good indeed for those sitting close
up to where the footlights used to be,
but the play should not be judged solely
from the viewpoint of those in the first
few rows.
An innovation which helped immensely
to put across some of the heavier dia
logues and monologues was the the pres
ence of music off-stage. The tone of the
violin sounding as a counter to the
speaking parts turned out to be an effec
tive experiment.
The usual word is in order for the
stage setting. As long as Chrysella Dun
ker. Clyde Coakley. William Lucas. Ern
est Greppin. and Stoddard Atwood con
tinue to design and put across the set-;
tings, Stanford can well boast of as
good presentations in this line as anyj
university can show.

play could have been. Looking back
over some of the farces that have been
given in the past few years, the ob
server can see that the majority of
them were far less successful presenta
tions than "He."
The fact that Saturday night's per

jformance did hold the audience with
; intense interest, and that it did, there
fore, "go over," is due primarily to
one man—A. D. Cohan, playing the
title role. This can be said without
slighting any other member of the
cast, for the construction of the play
was such that its success hung upon
the success of Cohan. He gave his
part the full force it demanded, and
whenever the show started to drag, he
pulled it out of the rut and gave it a
fresh start.
Cohan's performance was by far the
best individual showing made on the
campus stage this season, and anyone
who surpasses it will have to do very
well indeed. His part called for a
dramatic presentation of emotions
without crossing the danger line of
burlesque, and ,he fulfilled the re- ,
quirements with a certainty that left
no doubt as to who was chiefly re
sponsible for the success of the show.
Next in order of effectiveness was
Delmer Daves, who imparted to the
role of Count Mancini an air that was
far from stereotyped. He made the
Italian "nobleman" a mixture of vil
lainy and comic relief that was wel
come when the heavy parts of the play
began to predominate too much. Indi
viduality was the chief asset of his
performance.
Edythe Baylis, as Zinida, had the
hardest part in the play to put across;
but she played her role with an earn
estness that was convincing. She was
especially effective in her facial ex
| pressions and her movements about
the stage, and was not afraid to put
into her part all the emotion it re
quired.
Consuelo, "The Equestrian Tango
Queen," played by Peggy Richard
son, had the merit of appearing con
sistent throughout, although there was
not the quality of real acting present
to such a marked degree as in the
other leads. The fact that it was a
difficult task to keep the role of Con
suelo, that of the young circus girl,
all through the four acts, made the
consistency of the performance the
more commendable.
Stoddard Atwood made a likeable cir
cus manager. Those who have been more
closely connected with circuscs can tell
us better whether or not Atwood was
hard-boiled enough. Murray Ward, as
Baron Regnard, had to stand still and
look hard most of the time, and he did
the same effectively enough. Charles
Benedict had the bearing necessary to the
impetuous lover of Consuelo. Charles
Cross, as Jackson, the chief clown, han-i
died his part acceptably.
Tilly and Polly, the musical clowns,
played by Charles Parks and Alexander,
had a good deal to do with giving the,
proper circus atmosphere. The rest of
the characters had little or nothing to do, J
and usually whenever they were called
on, did not come through very well.
For "He Who Gets Slapped," the ham
mer can knock most resoundingly on
minor points and minor characters. The
four leads, the stage setting, and the gen
eral groupings were good enough; but
without picking individual flaws, it can
be said that the secondary leads, as
named, and the long list of minor char
acters, were not up to average. Then
there are complaints to make about the
curtain sticking—a little incident which
will mar any show—the person off-stage
who evokes a titter from the audience
at a crucial moment by dropping what
sounds like a tray of chinaware; and the
modern but rather ineffective lighting. .
The lighting scheme was the result of
much hard work on the part of those
concerned, but it was not sufficient, es
pecially for those back of the first fifteen
rows. Much of the facial expressions
of the actors were thus lost. It was
very good indeed for those sitting close
up to where the footlights used to be,
but the play should not be judged solely
from the viewpoint of those in the first
few rows.
An innovation which helped immensely
to put across some of the heavier dia
logues and monologues was the the pres
ence of music off-stage. The tone of the
violin sounding as a counter to the
speaking parts turned out to be an effec
tive experiment.
The usual word is in order for the
stage setting. As long as Chrysella Dun
ker. Clyde Coakley. William Lucas. Ern
est Greppin. and Stoddard Atwood con
tinue to design and put across the set-;
tings, Stanford can well boast of as
good presentations in this line as anyj
university can show.
The big battle is now on between
those who like to go to a show and
sleep and those who want to see some
thing when they do go.
The former are declaring in no un
certain terms that "He Who Gets
Slapped," presented by Masquers So
ciety Friday evening in the Assem
bly Hall, was a "queer" show, and not
the kind that a bunch of collegiate
amateurs should try at all.
The latter are glad that the show
was "queer"—it was something differ
ent, at least, from the ordinary stand
ardized, labeled Broadway farce that
the campus has been surfeited with
for some time.
Furthermore, judging from the atti
tude of the majority of the audience,
they were interested from start to
finish. The tenseness of the dramatic
situations of the play made itself felt
all over the hall, and the sound of a
pin whistling through the air as it
dropped could have been heard in
many places.
The show was a success —decidedly
so. It is quite true that that kind of a
drama can not be, and was not, han
dled as well as it should be to bring
out its full force. But what kind of a
play can campus actors handle abso
lutely perfectly? Nobody expects it.

come when the heavy parts of the play
began to predominate too much. Indi
viduality was the chief asset of his
performance.
Edythe Baylis, as Zinida, had the
hardest part in the play to put across;
but she played her role with an earn
estness that was convincing. She was
especially effective in her facial ex
| pressions and her movements about
the stage, and was not afraid to put
into her part all the emotion it re
quired.
Consuelo, "The Equestrian Tango
Queen," played by Peggy Richard
son, had the merit of appearing con
sistent throughout, although there was
not the quality of real acting present
to such a marked degree as in the
other leads. The fact that it was a
difficult task to keep the role of Con
suelo, that of the young circus girl,
all through the four acts, made the
consistency of the performance the
more commendable.
Stoddard Atwood made a likeable cir
cus manager. Those who have been more
closely connected with circuscs can tell
us better whether or not Atwood was
hard-boiled enough. Murray Ward, as
Baron Regnard, had to stand still and
look hard most of the time, and he did
the same effectively enough. Charles
Benedict had the bearing necessary to the
impetuous lover of Consuelo. Charles
Cross, as Jackson, the chief clown, han-i
died his part acceptably.
Tilly and Polly, the musical clowns,
played by Charles Parks and Alexander,
had a good deal to do with giving the,
proper circus atmosphere. The rest of
the characters had little or nothing to do, J
and usually whenever they were called
on, did not come through very well.
For "He Who Gets Slapped," the ham
mer can knock most resoundingly on
minor points and minor characters. The
four leads, the stage setting, and the gen
eral groupings were good enough; but
without picking individual flaws, it can
be said that the secondary leads, as
named, and the long list of minor char
acters, were not up to average. Then
there are complaints to make about the
curtain sticking—a little incident which
will mar any show—the person off-stage
who evokes a titter from the audience
at a crucial moment by dropping what
sounds like a tray of chinaware; and the
modern but rather ineffective lighting. .
The lighting scheme was the result of
much hard work on the part of those
concerned, but it was not sufficient, es
pecially for those back of the first fifteen
rows. Much of the facial expressions
of the actors were thus lost. It was
very good indeed for those sitting close
up to where the footlights used to be,
but the play should not be judged solely
from the viewpoint of those in the first
few rows.
An innovation which helped immensely
to put across some of the heavier dia
logues and monologues was the the pres
ence of music off-stage. The tone of the
violin sounding as a counter to the
speaking parts turned out to be an effec
tive experiment.
The usual word is in order for the
stage setting. As long as Chrysella Dun
ker. Clyde Coakley. William Lucas. Ern
est Greppin. and Stoddard Atwood con
tinue to design and put across the set-;
tings, Stanford can well boast of as
good presentations in this line as anyj
university can show.
The big battle is now on between
those who like to go to a show and
sleep and those who want to see some
thing when they do go.
The former are declaring in no un
certain terms that "He Who Gets
Slapped," presented by Masquers So
ciety Friday evening in the Assem
bly Hall, was a "queer" show, and not
the kind that a bunch of collegiate
amateurs should try at all.
The latter are glad that the show
was "queer"—it was something differ
ent, at least, from the ordinary stand
ardized, labeled Broadway farce that
the campus has been surfeited with
for some time.
Furthermore, judging from the atti
tude of the majority of the audience,
they were interested from start to
finish. The tenseness of the dramatic
situations of the play made itself felt
all over the hall, and the sound of a
pin whistling through the air as it
dropped could have been heard in
many places.
The show was a success —decidedly
so. It is quite true that that kind of a
drama can not be, and was not, han
dled as well as it should be to bring
out its full force. But what kind of a
play can campus actors handle abso
lutely perfectly? Nobody expects it.
It does not seem a rash statement
to say that Andreyev's drama was pre
sented as well as any other kind of a
play could have been. Looking back
over some of the farces that have been
given in the past few years, the ob
server can see that the majority of
them were far less successful presenta
tions than "He."
The fact that Saturday night's per

jformance did hold the audience with
; intense interest, and that it did, there
fore, "go over," is due primarily to
one man—A. D. Cohan, playing the
title role. This can be said without
slighting any other member of the
cast, for the construction of the play
was such that its success hung upon
the success of Cohan. He gave his
part the full force it demanded, and
whenever the show started to drag, he
pulled it out of the rut and gave it a
fresh start.
Cohan's performance was by far the
best individual showing made on the
campus stage this season, and anyone
who surpasses it will have to do very
well indeed. His part called for a
dramatic presentation of emotions
without crossing the danger line of
burlesque, and ,he fulfilled the re- ,
quirements with a certainty that left
no doubt as to who was chiefly re
sponsible for the success of the show.
Next in order of effectiveness was
Delmer Daves, who imparted to the
role of Count Mancini an air that was
far from stereotyped. He made the
Italian "nobleman" a mixture of vil
lainy and comic relief that was wel
come when the heavy parts of the play
began to predominate too much. Indi
viduality was the chief asset of his
performance.
