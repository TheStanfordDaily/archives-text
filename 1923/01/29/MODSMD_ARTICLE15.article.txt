# LIGHTWEIGHT CAGERS VICTORIOUS IN FIRST CONTEST WITH BEARS
## California 130-Pound Squad Is Outclassed by "Bud". Young's Stanford Quintet 
### 
When the Stanford lightweight basket
ball team woke up in the second half,
! and realized that to win games they must
; shoot baskets, they had little trouble
sweeping the California 130-pound quintet
before their superior team work and win
ning the first game of the championship
I series, 21 to 9, at Berkeley Friday.
The referee must have worn blisters
; on both lips blowing the whistle to call
personal fouls on members of the two
teams.
Personal fouls of the contest totaled
more than twenty. Seven of the Cali
fornia's points and seven of Stanford's
were due to free trials. The California
quintet shot only one field goal during
the game.
It was not until the third quarter was
| well under way that the Stanford team
j began to go steadily ahead of their Blue
: and Gold opponents.
The first half was a toss-up between
| the two fives; both were fighting hard,
but could not locate the goal often
enough to take a consistent lead.
Two-thirds of the time the ball re
mained in Stanford territory, but the
players failed to put it through the hoop.
Young and Captain Meyers both tallied
a field goal in this period. Young con
verted three personal fouls, ending the
half 7 to 6 in favor of the Cardinal
quintet.
The lightweights' teamwork began to
take on real championship form in the
| third stanza and the Young-Meyer-Shaw
! keystone scored regularly.
Fighting hard, the California team at
tempted come-back after come-back, only
I to have the ball returned to the Stanford
I goal under a perfect defensive combi
nation. Stanford's passing improved with
the game, while the California men fum
bled freely, giving the Cardinal five nu
merous opportunities to score.
California became more erratic as the
: score went against them. The Blue and
' Gold forwards failed repeatedly to pene
trat the Cardinal defense, and only by a
chance shot and a free try at goal did
! they garner three extra points in the sec
: ond half.
"Bud" Young, fast Stanford guard,
found the hoop at regular intervals in
the third and fourth quarters. He was
high point man with 13. Six points were
from field goals, and the remaining seven
came as a result of free trials. Young
formed the nucleus of the Cardinal of
; fensive, besides playing his position of
running guard on the defensive.
Captain Meyers was next highest with
a total of six points. Meyers played his
usual steady game, taking part mainly
in the offensive.
Shaw was responsible for the remain
: ing two digits. He played a smashing
game, devoting himself more to the de
fensive, but figuring strongly in the of
| fensive drives of the Younger-Mever-
Shaw trio.

When the Stanford lightweight basket
ball team woke up in the second half,
! and realized that to win games they must
; shoot baskets, they had little trouble
sweeping the California 130-pound quintet
before their superior team work and win
ning the first game of the championship
I series, 21 to 9, at Berkeley Friday.
The referee must have worn blisters
; on both lips blowing the whistle to call
personal fouls on members of the two
teams.
Personal fouls of the contest totaled
more than twenty. Seven of the Cali
fornia's points and seven of Stanford's
were due to free trials. The California
quintet shot only one field goal during
the game.
It was not until the third quarter was
| well under way that the Stanford team
j began to go steadily ahead of their Blue
: and Gold opponents.
The first half was a toss-up between
| the two fives; both were fighting hard,
but could not locate the goal often
enough to take a consistent lead.
Two-thirds of the time the ball re
mained in Stanford territory, but the
players failed to put it through the hoop.
Young and Captain Meyers both tallied
a field goal in this period. Young con
verted three personal fouls, ending the
half 7 to 6 in favor of the Cardinal
quintet.
The lightweights' teamwork began to
take on real championship form in the
| third stanza and the Young-Meyer-Shaw
! keystone scored regularly.
Fighting hard, the California team at
tempted come-back after come-back, only
I to have the ball returned to the Stanford
I goal under a perfect defensive combi
nation. Stanford's passing improved with
the game, while the California men fum
bled freely, giving the Cardinal five nu
merous opportunities to score.
California became more erratic as the
: score went against them. The Blue and
' Gold forwards failed repeatedly to pene
trat the Cardinal defense, and only by a
chance shot and a free try at goal did
! they garner three extra points in the sec
: ond half.
"Bud" Young, fast Stanford guard,
found the hoop at regular intervals in
the third and fourth quarters. He was
high point man with 13. Six points were
from field goals, and the remaining seven
came as a result of free trials. Young
formed the nucleus of the Cardinal of
; fensive, besides playing his position of
running guard on the defensive.
Captain Meyers was next highest with
a total of six points. Meyers played his
usual steady game, taking part mainly
in the offensive.
Shaw was responsible for the remain
: ing two digits. He played a smashing
game, devoting himself more to the de
fensive, but figuring strongly in the of
| fensive drives of the Younger-Mever-
Shaw trio.
