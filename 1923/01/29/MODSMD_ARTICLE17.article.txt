# ST. MARY'S SQUAD PROVES NO MATCH FOR KERR'S TEAM
## Cardinal Quintet Has Little Difficulty in Running Up Large Score Against Saints 
### 
St. Mary's offered but little opposi
tion to the Cardinal quintet last Sat
urday night in a game played prelim
inary to the Stanford-California fresh
men contest. The final score of the
game was 35 to 13.
Contrary to the reports of having a
strong aggregation, the Saints had
probably the weakest team that has
been seen on the Pavilion floor this
year.
Stanford Takes Lead at Start
From the opening of the contest, the
Stanford forwards started with an of
fense that put away all doubt as to
the outcome of the game. Anderson
and "Nip" McHose both registered
twice with field goals and, aided by
personal fouls made by the Saints, the
Cardinal five ran the count up to 18
while Madigan's men were garnering
7 in the first half.
The Cardinal offense during the first
half showed great promise. The short
passing game was resorted to most of
the time, the Cardinal forwards work
ing the ball very effectively under the
basket for short shots that counted.
The Stanford five also bad opportun
ity to experiment in varying their at
tack and several times during the
game they changed their style of
game, both defensive and offensive.
Working more on offense and using
the greater part of the time a four
man defense instead of the usual five
man combination, the Cardinal guard
ing game was not as airtight as it
might have been. In the second half,
although the score kept piling up for
Stanford, the game slowed up and
toward the end of the contest, Coach
Andy Kerr sent in five new men to
finish the game.
Personal Fouls Numerous
Personal fouls on the part of the
Saints were numerous. Coach Madi
gan's squad previous to the game was
said to be made up chiefly of football
players. That they knew more about
football than basketball was well evi
denced by their play in Saturday's
gume. For Saint Mary's, Lawless ac
counted for seven of their thirteen
points, while Lester, Conlin, and
Grant each registered a field goal.
"Nip" McHose had a regular field
day Saturday, making nineteen points,
twelve of them being by the field goal
route. Rogers, although he played a
good defensive game, was not up to
par in his floor work, and on two oc
casions he missed easy tries at the
basket.
Fred Anderson came next to Mc-
Hose in chalking up points by drop
ping in three field goals. The sum
