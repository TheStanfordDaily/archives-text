# VIKINGS DEFEATED BY FIRST VARSITY SOCCER ELEVEN 2-1
## 
### 
The Viking Club of San Francisco was
defeated 2 to 1 by the varsity socccr
fcleven on the campus field Saturday aft
ernoon in the third set of games of the
University Club Soccer League this year.
Playing a better type of game than
they exhibited when they met the Stan
ford team last quarter, the Vikings forced
the varsity to work all ninety minutes
for their victory.
Although the varsity men plainly out
fought the poorer-conditioned Vikings
and carried the ball to their goal terri
tory frequently, they were unable to drop
it in but twice. The forwards, who
passed consistently well throughout the
contest, failed to direct but a few fast,
well-aimed shots at the goal.
One of the chief difficulties was in
Peterson, the Vikings' heavy left full
back, who although he had little of the
rugged conditioning the Stanford men
possessed, proved a persistent obstacle.
Peterson messed up every other offensive
play, sending the leather back to the
halfbacks.
The Stanford eleven showed up best
in its defensive play. Captain A1 Masters,,
the veteran goal guard, with his fullbacks,
Donald Clark, one of the most depend
able and sturdy men, on the right side,
and Richard Johnson, a recent addition
to the team regulars, on the left side,
had plenty of opportunity to keep warm
defending the Stanford cage.
The first goal was shot for the varsity
in the first half by Ta'am. The Vikings
came down the field a short time later
and in a massed play about the goal suc
ceeded in getting a fast shot through.
! The deciding score was made by Quigley,
the varsity inside left, after a series of
j good passes by Dwight and Green, in
l the early part of the second half.
During the entire second period
Walthers, Howe, and Swayne backed up
the forward line and regularly returned
the ball after it had been lost to Peter
son, the Viking fullback.
The Vikings, most of whom played
soccer in the old countries, play a differ
ent style of game than Maloney's men.
With most of the Vikings, who are un
able to practice during the week, soccer
is simply a recreation. They are con
tented with an easier game, marked with
many long shots and little rushed play,
than the University men, who are in su
perior condition and "rearing to win."
