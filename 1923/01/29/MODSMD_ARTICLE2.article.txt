### (By United Press 
LONDON, Jan. 29. —The entire oc
cupied Rhineland today joined in the
sabotage against French occupation of

While the latter district was almost
completely cut off from the outside
world by telephone, telegraph, water
ways and railroad strikes, walkouts
by German rail workers spread to
Cologne, Treves, Aix La Chapelle and
Coblenz.

by a strike of communications oper
atives last night. Central offces of the
telephone and telegraph exchanges
were closed.

was meager. Apparently a strict cen
sorship, combined with sporadic tele
graph and telephone strikes, made
transmission of dispatches next to im
possible.
French forces along the Rhine and

the German sabotage. The occupied
section is expected to have reached a
