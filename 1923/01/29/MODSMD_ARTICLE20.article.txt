# THE 						RESULTS OF A COMPROMISE
## 
### 
The Stanford Spectator is now the combined
literary publication and magazine of student opinion
on the Campus. It is the result of the combination
of the Stanford Pictorial and the Stanford Cardinal,
both of which have been of great value to the
undergraduate body, but neither of which could do
its best work while so much competition remained
in the field. With English Club and Press Club
working on a competitive basis the best as well as
the less desirable work of campus contributors was
spread wholesale inside the covers of both maga
zines. Nothing but the best should appear here
after.
Ed Landels, a member of both English Club and
Press Club, a Stanford student who has kept in
close touch with the activities of both societies and
has done much to further the interests of both the
departed magazines, will be the first editor. The
task of building a substantial publication on the
foundations so recently vacated is his. To be
frank, he has a big job on his hands.
The Campus will watch with interest for the
first number.
