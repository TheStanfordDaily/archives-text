# A 						WORD TO COLLEGE WITS
## 
### 
'Stanford last year took second place among all
the colleges and universities in the United States
in Judge's College \\ its Contest. It was not the
â€¢Stanford Chaparral that took the honors, but Stan
ford University as a whole. Although the major
I>art of the material was submitted by Hammer and
Coffin members, many other Stanford students were
represented. This year should be no exception to
the rule.

If Cornell succeeds in taking the cup again this
year, she will have won its peranent possession. If
all the local college wits would only get together
before March 1 and turn in their "bits." Stanford
would have a fair chance of copping this cup for
the West. Here is a chance to prove to the East
that people living beyond the Rocky Mountains
occasionally have funny thoughts of their own.
