						HERITAGE OF REVENGE
## 
### 
When the average man has been the butt of a
practical joke, he is not satisfied until he has played
it on another. If he has been clouted on the nose,
he is not likely to turn the other side of it, but may
be expected to return the attention. Real satisfac
tion can be afforded only When the author of the
joke or the giver of the blow has been repaid with
bis own coin. It is not the practice of most people
to take revenge on Peter to pay Paul. They cannot
distort logic in any way to fit such a situation.
Yet, college sophomores, having just finished with
a period in which they received undue physical at
tention, never think of revenging themselves on the
juniors, who were to blame. That's against tradi
tion. And so every freshman class at the end of its
year hands down a heritage of revenge acquired in
terms of physical violence, which can be paid only
in like terms. Such a system is cumulative. And
if it were logically sound, the yearly interest added
to the principal would eventually justify a whole
sale killing of freshmen.
This system is dying by inches. More and more
men each year see the futility of passing on revenge,
and with their own failure to take advantage of
their questionable opportunities, the principal les
>ens. If this were to keep up, nothing would need
be said. But while the seeds of this system still
remain, the cure will be postponed. It requires only
a little co-operation for an even smaller time to
bury this unnecessary "heirloom.
May nothing delay the funeral rites.
