Whoever it was that garbled the letter sent out
by the coach of the Occidental College football
team with reference to the change from the Trojans
to the Cards in next year's schedule, is quite gifted.
This manner of twisting facts to give negative im
pressions is one much cultivated in southern sec
tions, one which is to be hoped will not be emulated

and even if properly written is subject to misinter
pretation. The printed message is often dubious
enough without intentionally adding questionable
complications.
But no doubt this example is merely an excep
tion. While there is life there is sometimes hope.
