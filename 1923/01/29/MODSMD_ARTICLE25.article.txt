Have you ever gone up to the city for a quiet evening
at the theater and had it develop into an evening that
wasn't so quiet after all and by gosh you looked at your
watch —both of then\ —and then at the time table —all
three of them, or maybe more —and doggoned if you
didn't have just five minutes to get the last train home.
And you looked at the time table again to make sure
and yessir the last train in black figures was 11:45 and
if you didn't catch that you'd have to stay all night in
the great metropolis and since this hadn't been such a
quiet evening after all you weren't quite sure you had
enough jack left to gather in a room. So you spent a
precious nickel on a furious five-mile an hour ride on
the trolley to Third and Townsend and when you got
there by gum the train was just pulling out in a cloud
of dust and you were out of luck. And then you swore
and faced a night of discomfort, wondering where you
were going to spend it. And you tried to remember the
phone number of the only people you knew in the city
but somehow or other your memory wasn't very good
and you gave it up. And so you sat down on the
benches in the station firmly resolved to sit there till
the next morning. And you had sat there a while and
some busy-body from behind the desk came and kicked
you out and you were out in the cold world. After
awhile —having spent the intervening time wandering
about wishing it weren't such a long walk to Palo Alto
you took out your watch and it was 2:30 and then you
took out your time table and looked at it again—just
one of them this time —to find out what time the first
train back to civilization left the next morning. And
your eye rested on an astounding fact —to-wit, that the
first train was at 2:15 and the second at 4:30. And you
looked at your watch again and it said 2:31. And then
you realized that you had been a dumbell and had missed
the justly celebrated Milk Train. What did you do
then?

my intelligence.
Flapper: What a shoe string to start on.
