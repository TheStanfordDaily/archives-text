The power house whistle in the
future will blow once every night at 5.
o'clock. Heretofore it has been used
only at noon, Saturday, and for fires.
It was discovered at a recent fire in a
professor's home that the whistle re
fused to work because it was not used
often enough. Consequently, a decision
has been made to blow it every night.
Stanford's basketball team went
down before the Santa Clara varsity
Saturday night by a score of 41 to 30.
The play was fast and hard through
out. The Mission five had the advan
tage in weight but was unable to func
tion properly during the first half, the
Cards leading at that time, 15 to 14.
Slamming out one of the longest hits
ever made on the Stanford diamond, a
home run over center field, "Swede"
Risberg won the baseball game for
Cliff Ireland from the Stanford varsity
Saturday afternoon. A good club op
posed the Cardinals, and with Ireland
on second keeping both teams on edge
throughout the game with his ready
wit, the full nine innings sped by in
the record time of one hour and thirty
minutes.
Fifty-two women have signed up for
basketball this semester which is the
largest number taking part in this
sport for years.
Nine men comprise the U. S. C.
basketball squad which arrived this
morning on the Yale from Los An
geles. Tonight, the Southerners meet
California at Berkeley; Wednesday,
they play Stanford.
By mistake, several copies of the
Illustrated Review addressed to sub
scribers were sold on the Quad this
morning, and as a result the Review
does not know to whom the magazines
were sent. The supply of copies ran
out before noon owing to the brisk
sale.
