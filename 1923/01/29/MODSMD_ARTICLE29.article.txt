# Idaho 28, W.S.C. 19
## 
### 
The University of Idaho evened up
accounts with Washington State in
the second game of their two-game
series at Moscow last Saturday night
by the score of 28 to 19.
The play was fast and rough. W. S.
C. was consistently outpassed, out
guarded, and outplayed, except for a
short-lived rally in the second half.
