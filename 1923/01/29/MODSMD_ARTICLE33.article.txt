Dear Sir: Everybody has heard the
Board of Athletic Control is going to
build a half-million dollar dormitory on
a long-time basis from the receipts of
athletic contests. Yet few know how
this feat is to be accomplished. All that
is apparent is the fact that our athletic
budget for the time is badly crimped and
that the future will eventually see a de
crease in income when the price of Big
Game tickets are forced down. It is not
to be doubted that the Board has enough
foresight to make futude budgets safe,
but unless some assurance of this is
given thp students by getting away from
present penny-pinching, outward appear
ances will certainly not be favorable. If
we have so much money, who don't we
send the tennis team East with it instead
of bleeding the students for a couple of
thousand dollars by holding the spring
carnival Why not get more baseball
equipment ? Why not give a crew a
chance? And, finally, if times are so
hard, when payments are not being
made, what will they be like when we
start to feed the bankers two or three
years from now?
