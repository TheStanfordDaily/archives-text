# DELTA CHI TAKES LEAD IN LEAGUE FOUR CAGE SERIES
## Alpha Tau Omega Wins From El Capitan; New Round Starts Today 
### 
Delta Chi defeated Alpha Kappa
Lambda, 18-6, and Alpha Tau Omega
won from El Capitan, 12-5, Friday night
in the last two games in the third round
of the intramural basketball tournament.
The fourth round will start today, be
concluded by the end of the week, and
the final round will be played next week,
the finals to follow immediately.
The struggle between Delta Chi and
Alpha Kappa Lambda was for the su
premacy in League 4. Both teams had
won two games each and had not been
defeated. But the battle was far from
close, the Delta Chi men showing a much
superior brand of basketball, which kept
them in the lead from the start.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda team lacked
confidence in each other and plainly
showed the lack of practice.
Tritle played a fast game for Delta
Chi, being responsible for eight of the
twelve points his team made. Every
other man on the team made on basket,
but Tritle was the one forward man
who could shoot accurately, and make
most of his throws good.

Alpha Tau Omega was slow in getting
started and in the early minutes of play
missed several easy shots at the basket.
Neill finally caged one and continued to
loop the ball in intermittently through
out the game, getting five baskets from
the floor before the end.
Phelps and Stratton played a hard
game and usually got hold of the ball
whenever it got loose, but failed to shoot
accurately.
The Alpha Tau Omega five worked
well together and showed a great im
provement over their first two games.
They were far speedier than their op
ponents and were able to snatch the ball
out of the air and carry it down the
floor before El Capitan had a chance to
get up a defense. Walker was the best
man on El Capitan, dribbling to every
corner of the court, though he was cov
ered so well that he could get loose only
a few times.

Hall, fourth floor, 5:40 p.m.: El Campo
and El Cuadro, 7:15 p.m.; Sequoia Hall,
first floor, and Kappa Sigma, 8 p m.
Tomorrow's games are: El Tigre and
Delta Upsilon, 5 p.m.; Theta Delta Chi
and Phi Kappa Psi, 5:40 p.m.; Phi Delta
Theta and El Capitan, 7:15 p.m.; Alpha
Tau Omega and Alpha Lambda, 8 p. m.
Delta Chi defeated Alpha Kappa
Lambda, 18-6, and Alpha Tau Omega
won from El Capitan, 12-5, Friday night
in the last two games in the third round
of the intramural basketball tournament.
The fourth round will start today, be
concluded by the end of the week, and
the final round will be played next week,
the finals to follow immediately.
The struggle between Delta Chi and
Alpha Kappa Lambda was for the su
premacy in League 4. Both teams had
won two games each and had not been
defeated. But the battle was far from
close, the Delta Chi men showing a much
superior brand of basketball, which kept
them in the lead from the start.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda team lacked
confidence in each other and plainly
showed the lack of practice.
Tritle played a fast game for Delta
Chi, being responsible for eight of the
twelve points his team made. Every
other man on the team made on basket,
but Tritle was the one forward man
who could shoot accurately, and make
most of his throws good.
Neill Scores Five Times As
A. T. O. Wins From El Capitan
Alpha Tau Omega was slow in getting
started and in the early minutes of play
missed several easy shots at the basket.
Neill finally caged one and continued to
loop the ball in intermittently through
out the game, getting five baskets from
the floor before the end.
Phelps and Stratton played a hard
game and usually got hold of the ball
whenever it got loose, but failed to shoot
accurately.
The Alpha Tau Omega five worked
well together and showed a great im
provement over their first two games.
They were far speedier than their op
ponents and were able to snatch the ball
out of the air and carry it down the
floor before El Capitan had a chance to
get up a defense. Walker was the best
man on El Capitan, dribbling to every
corner of the court, though he was cov
ered so well that he could get loose only
a few times.

tournament will start today and be fin
