# BEAR 145-POUNDERS TAKE EASY CONTEST FROM CARDINAL TEAM
## 
### 
Remarkable team work and experience
enabled the California 145-pound quintet
to defeat the Stanford light-heavyweight
basketball team, 26 to 13, in the Harmon
gymnasium at Berkeley last Friday eve
ning.
California swept the less aggressive
Cardinal team before a clock-work offen
sive combination in the first half of the
game. Kay of California found the
hoop repeatedly, as did his team mates,
Sears and Doll. Two field goals by Stef
fan and Cornell gave the Stanford five
the short end of a 14 to 4 score in the
first period. Few fouls were chalked up
against either team.
More confident in the second half, the
Stanford players found the basket more
often, but they failed to check the offen
sive drives of the Kay. Sears and Doll
trio. The Cardinal defense was poor and
their team work shaky, yet they fought
the California team till the final whistle.
Fouls were more prevalent during the
last stanza. The Stanford men began
to play rougher in attempts to offset an
increased score, but numerous fumbles
gave the Berkeley team added oppor
tunities to sweep the ball back to their
territory.
Kay and Sears of California were the
outstanding players. Both played a
smashing offensive game and with Doll
made up the main cog of the Berkeley
team. Kay accounted for ten points and
Sears for eight of the California score.
Steffan, Cornell, and Paul O'Hara
showed up best for the Stanford aggre
gation. Steffan and Cornell both found
the basket regularly, but were poorly
supported in the defensive.
The California quintet had five weeks
of practice and a southern trip advantage
over the Cardinals. Four veterans from
the 1922 team gave them an edge in ex
perience and team work.
When Stanford meets the Blue and
Gold team in a return game February 9.
in the Pavilion, the Cardinal quintet
should be in better condition to put up a
stiffer and more efficient opposition.
The teams lined up as follows:
California (26) Stanford (13)
Sears F Steffan
Scott F Cornell
Doll C Summy
Kay G Colgan
Williams G P. O'Hara
