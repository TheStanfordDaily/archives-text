# UNDERSTANDING OF RELIGION IS ONLY HOPE OF DEMOCRACY

"If I could present the most valuable
gift that I know of, I would give you the
understanding of religion in the hearts
of individuals and in the service of the
world.
"You cannot make a civilization with
out the spirit of God a moving and vital
power within men and women." This
was the statement of Raymond Robins in
his final lecture, "Democracy's Only
Hope," last night in the Assembly Hall.
Beginning with the basic question, "Is
Religion of any consequence?" Robins
analyzed the moral ailments of the world
today as he found them in America, Aus
tralia, Russia, and Germany.
"We found in Illinois that the future
of our ward rested upon 22,000 children,
that a childs first need is food of a good
quality. Then their parents need a liv
ing wage, so a group of men managed to
have labor laws passed.
"But we still found that family savings
were being wasted. The only cure for
this kind of self-indulgence and social
waste is simple Christianity."
Australia was cited by the lecturer as
the home of efficient labor laws, but un
fortunately also the harbor of more
drunken men and women than almost
any place in the world.
"Australia has the gambling habit,"
said Robins. "The trouble with gam
bling is that it educates the get-some
thing-for-nothing attitude â€” which leads
to a parasitic frame of mind."
"The situation in Russia is more re
lated to the question of religion than any
other thing," the speaker asserted. "Rus
sia lacks moral and spiritual power, the
anchor of religion. The reason for this
revolt against the church was found," he
said, "in the words of a Bolshevik guard,
'We believe in God, but we hate the
church; it spied and informed upon us
in the old days.' "
Germany is the conclusive example of
moral failure, according to Robins.
"Germany's success in the first part of
the war was not due to a vice, but to a
virtue of her social order. Efficiency
carried her on, but in the end the words
of the Galilean peasant held true, 'All
those who take the sword shall perish
with the sword.' If it were not for this,
the Germans would be masters of the
world todav."
