# PROFESSOR SMITH GIVEN $10,000 BY FORMER STUDENTS
## Gift Is Made at Campfire; "J.P." Will Continue to Smoke on Geology Corner 
### 
"J. P." can smoke his double-wrap
ped Bulls 011 the Geology corner until
he's a hundred years old.
He has been duly initiated into the
order of eternal youth, and admon
ished never to quit "talking things
over with the boys" on the Geology
corner at Stanford.
One hundred Stanford men, "G. M."
majors who were at one time or an
other members of the student fold of
Professor J. P. Smith, decided to pre
sent him with "a small token of es
teem."

Presented at Campfire
The sum of ten thousand dollars was
the result. It was prese»ted to Profes
sor Smith at a campfire last Friday in
the ccftirt of the Geology building, as
the head of geology and mining ma
jors, with one of his famous hand
made cigarettes in his mouth,
"talking things over" —as he is accus-,
tomed to do between classes.
Professor Tolman opened the meet
ing with a short review of Professor
Smith's achievements. Then he said: j
Future Students Will Know Him
"Dr. Smith now devotes his time to
research and teaching and up to the
time of his retirement at the age of
65, the future Stanford students will 1
have opportunity to know him and
learn from him. In order, however, to'
make it possible for Dr. Smith to con-!
tinue in after years to study and ad- i
vise his students, it was thought that ,
a fund should be raised.

"J. P. will not get old at 75 or 85,;
and in order to make it possible for
him to still smoke cigarettes at the,
ripe old age of 100 and give fatherly
admonition while so doing, a purse of
$10,000 was raised and is now pre
sented to him by his old students."
After the old grads of the Geology
department had done their worst with
Dr. Smith's past career, Professor
Tolman declared "J. P." proved worthy
of any honor that could be conferred
and duly initiated him into the order
of eternal youth.
In his outline of Dr. £ 'tiith's life, I
Professor Tolman said: "Dr. Smith is
recognized as the greatest authority
on ammonites, not only in America but
in the world; he is a great teacher, as
shown especially in the enthusiasm
that he has created among his old
students, but, greatest of all, he is a
great man.
