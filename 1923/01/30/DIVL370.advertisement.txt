A DISTINCTLY new tendency is apparent in architectural
thought and design today. Architects are designing in
masses — the great silhouette, the profile of" the building has
become of far greater importance than its detail.
There is a new vigor and ruggedness even in buildings which arc conven
tionally classic in their detail. Masses mount upward, supporting the tower,
accentuating iti height. The new architecture is tending toward great struc
tures rather than multiplicity of detail.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organization,
will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture of the future.
