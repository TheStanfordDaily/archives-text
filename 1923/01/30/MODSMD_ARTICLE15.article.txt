# BASEBALL VARSITY WILL PLAY SPEEDY JEFFERSON CLUB
## Jefferson Semi-Pro Team of San Francisco First Outside Nine of Year to Play Cards 
### 
Stanford's baseball varsity will open
its preliminary season Saturday after
noon, when it encounters the Jeffer
son Club nine, a fast semi-pro aggrega
tion from San Francisco. The game
will be played on the varsity diamond.
The Cards so far this season have
had a hard time getting in any real
intensive practice. When the playing
field has not been so completely de
luged with water as it is at present,
Harry Wolter's forty cohorts have
been limbering up with a light prac
tice.
There was nothing spectacular in
the varsity's tussle with the freshman
nine a week ago last Friday, but it
was better than ordinary early-season
baseball. The varsity won 10 to 0, and
the men were not only able to find
the ball and pelt it for good lengthy
distances, but they also exhibited an
air-tight defense. This year's varsity
has big possibilities and the jinx that
has been following Stanford basbeall
for so many years may be hoodwinked.
The Jefferson Club has a strong
line-up and should prove a hard op
ponent for the varsity. At present the
team is participating in the Midwinter
League of San Francisco and ranks
high among the leading semi-pro clubs.
In recent years, the aggregation has
tangled with California, St. Mary's,
and Santa Clara. The contest in which
the JeiTersonians held the Bears to a
4-to-3 score in ten innings of speedy
ball was one of the best games played
at Berkeley last year. The club is
also well-known in both San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties, having
crossed bats with several teams in
each county.
A1 Schumacher, who twirled against
California last year, will probably
take the mound for the visitors Satur
day. Schumacher will join Little Rock
in the Southern Association later this
season. Ray Beck will catch.
Coach Wolter has not selected the
Cardinal battery yet, but it is prob
able that Solomon and Huneke will
start.
Coach Wolter wants all varsity men to
report regularly Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, whether it rains or not.
