### (By United Press 
BERLIN, Jan. 30. —"Guerilla warfare
without weapons"—German's name for
the passive sabotage of the Ruhr —met
French coercion in the occupied area
at every turn today.
The invaders extended the zone of
martial law until virtually the entire
Ruhr and most of the Rhineland was
under military rule. Noers, Homberg,
and seven other cities were declared
in a state of siege.
Wholesale expulsion of German of
ficials was under way. More than forty
burgomasters and local authorities
were sent under guard to unoccupied
territory.
Antagonism of the populace in
creased with each new aggressive act
of the invaders. Telegraphers and
telephone workers struck or mixed up
French lines of communication so that
they were useless. Correspondents of
Berlin sent bitter dispatches to their
offices. The French warned them to
use milder language. They refused,
whereupon the troops cut all wire com
munications with Berlin isolating the
Ruhr.
Roundabout reports reaching Berlin
today following extension of the stage
of siege told of the most stringent
measures being introduced in the oc
cupied zones. These were said to in
clude control of all newspapers and a
ban against certain German and
Rhineland dailies because of their anti-
French sentiments. Such newspapers
were forbidden to be brought into the
occupied area.
The Cuno government renewed to
day its protests to Paris against the
wholesale arrests of German officials.
The French explained they are ex
pelling all authorities who refuse to
recognize the law of the invaders, but
are not otherwise punishing them.
Two hundred delegates of miners
and associated workers met at Bochum
and denounced the French.
It was decided to continue resistance
to the end, regardless of threats.
