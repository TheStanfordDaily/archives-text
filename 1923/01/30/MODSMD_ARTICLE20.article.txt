# Weather Prophet Is Offended at Unusual Antics of Elements
## 
### 
Native Calii'ornians were hard pressed
for a few moments yesterday explaining
a light snow-fall which astounded the
campus and the weather man. The
latter was particularly displeased with
the unexpected downpour as he had just
finished posting a bulletin that the
weather would he warmer soon with light
northwest winds.
The campus was favored with but a
few moments of snow, but the surround
ing hills were deeply bedded with the
un-Californian element. Soon cars were
dashing up the hills, and returning laden
with snowball material. Students walk
ing along plunged in thought were sud
denly plunged into still deeper thought
by the whizz-bâ€”bang of a frozen snow
ball tearing through the California atmos
phere and coming into contact with faces
and heads.
It was estimated at a late hour last
night that 2,654 students had made com- j
ments un the unusual weather; 1,590
wished they were back east where they
could have their ice-skating and tobog-j
ganing; 869 planned trips to the snow; 1
20 went; 18 wished they had not gone.
Further vital statistics could not be
learned.
