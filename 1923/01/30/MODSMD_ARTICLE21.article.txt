Young and Hobro Are Unable to
Outshoot El Cuadro Forwards
With Young and Hobro, members
of the 130-pound team, playing on the
El Campo team, El Cuadro seemed set
for a defeat at the beginning of the
contest, especially since one of their
guards was absent. But the El Campo
forwards were unable to locate the
hoope at any time during the game al
though they had the ball in El Cuadro
territory most of the time.
Hobro and Schoen worked the ball
down to the El Cuadro goal but could
not get free for many shots at the
basket. And it was not until Bertrand
entered the game at center for El
Campo that a counter was made. The
El Cuadro forwards were better on
basket shooting than when defeated
last week by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and they made the most of shots
at the basket, Robison sinking the only
one scored during the first half.
After the intermission with the score
at 2-2, Young opened up for El Campo
and scored two goals from his running
guard position. At the same time Eg
gleston and Robison each scored a
basket and evened up the count. Kelley
caged the winning basket for El Cuad
ro.
The game was fast and clean, only
uui 11 x/
three fouls being called during the
whole game and none of them entering
into the scoring. The Robison-Burk
hard-Eggleston combination handled
the ball well for El Cuadro and by
their close guarding and fast floor
work were able to keep the El Campo
shooters in check.
Kappa Sigma Wins Easily
From Sequoia Hall Team
When the Kappa Sigma players de
feated Sequoia Hall first floor team
21-10, they handed them their second
successive defeat. The Kappa Sigma
team showed the best basketball they
have displayed to date and at no time
were in danger of losing. Middleton,
who has been the only man on the
team to pile up any points in previous
games, was unable to find the rim dur
ing the first of the game and didn't
cage a shot until the end. In the last
minute of play he got the ball three
times and succeeded in looping it
through the hoop for six points. Hey
played a good all-around game for
Kappa Sigma with close guarding and
good fl|oor work which enabled him to
add two more baskets to his team's
score.
Timmons was high point scorer for
Sequoia as in theic other games. He
got free several times and made three
pretty baskets, two by Cooper increas
ing the Sequoia total.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon team got
credit for another win yesterday when
the Encina Hall, fourth floor, team
forfeited. Sigma Alpha Epsilon now
leads the teams in League 2 with four
victories and no defeats.
Theta Xi won their first game of the
tournament last night by defeating
Encina Hall, third floor, team 8-2. The
game was slow and a poor exhibition
of basket shooting. Dice was the only
Encina man to find the rim of the
hoop. Four of the Theta Xi players
found the basket once apiece, but none
of the men displayed a superior brand
of play. Mulchay was again unable to
live up to expectations and recorded
only one tally.

Young and Hobro Are Unable to
Outshoot El Cuadro Forwards
With Young and Hobro, members
of the 130-pound team, playing on the
El Campo team, El Cuadro seemed set
for a defeat at the beginning of the
contest, especially since one of their
guards was absent. But the El Campo
forwards were unable to locate the
hoope at any time during the game al
though they had the ball in El Cuadro
territory most of the time.
Hobro and Schoen worked the ball
down to the El Cuadro goal but could
not get free for many shots at the
basket. And it was not until Bertrand
entered the game at center for El
Campo that a counter was made. The
El Cuadro forwards were better on
basket shooting than when defeated
last week by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and they made the most of shots
at the basket, Robison sinking the only
one scored during the first half.
After the intermission with the score
at 2-2, Young opened up for El Campo
and scored two goals from his running
guard position. At the same time Eg
gleston and Robison each scored a
basket and evened up the count. Kelley
caged the winning basket for El Cuad
ro.
The game was fast and clean, only
uui 11 x/
three fouls being called during the
whole game and none of them entering
into the scoring. The Robison-Burk
hard-Eggleston combination handled
the ball well for El Cuadro and by
their close guarding and fast floor
work were able to keep the El Campo
shooters in check.
