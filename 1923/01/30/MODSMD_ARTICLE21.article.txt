Young and Hobro Are Unable to
Outshoot El Cuadro Forwards
With Young and Hobro, members
of the 130-pound team, playing on the
El Campo team, El Cuadro seemed set
for a defeat at the beginning of the
contest, especially since one of their
guards was absent. But the El Campo
forwards were unable to locate the
hoope at any time during the game al
though they had the ball in El Cuadro
territory most of the time.
Hobro and Schoen worked the ball
down to the El Cuadro goal but could
not get free for many shots at the
basket. And it was not until Bertrand
entered the game at center for El
Campo that a counter was made. The
El Cuadro forwards were better on
basket shooting than when defeated
last week by Sigma Alpha Epsilon
and they made the most of shots
at the basket, Robison sinking the only
one scored during the first half.
After the intermission with the score
at 2-2, Young opened up for El Campo
and scored two goals from his running
guard position. At the same time Eg
gleston and Robison each scored a
basket and evened up the count. Kelley
caged the winning basket for El Cuad
ro.
The game was fast and clean, only
