the Civic Auditorium of San Francisco.
Professor A. B. Clark of the Graphic
Art department discussed the paintings
before twenty or more students and a
number of other Stanford and Palo Alto
people.
A large number of the pictures reflect
the modern impressionistic and post-im
pressionistic tendency which has been
studied by the graphic art students the
last week.. Included in the exhibition at
Polk hall were paintings of Gauguin,
Courbet. Renoir, and Cezanne.
