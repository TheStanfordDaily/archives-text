# All Ye Weary Ones Take Heed! Women Scribes to Sell Crullers Thursday
## 
### 
At last a relief with a guarantee! Did
you ever feel down in the mud along
about the middle of the morning just
when some infernal ex beckons you the
next hour? Just as if you couldn't budge
another inch? How many times have
you vainly wished for some rich appe
tizing morsel for that empty feeling—
something different, that really satisfies?
Here is something worth heeding—
steaming hot, sugar-coated delectable
crullers will be peddled by the journalistic
chcfettees of Theta Sigma Phi Thursday
morning in front of the Women's Club
house. The women scribes have demon
strated many times that they can cook
better than they can write.
