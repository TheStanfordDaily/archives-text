Publicity started in the south following Occi-
announcement that they were to play Stan
ford next year on October 20 lead to a minor but
unnecessary unpleasantness which was settled only
today when a letter of explanation was received by
the Daily Palo Alto from President Remsen D.
Bird of Occidental College. A complete record
accompanied the letter.
Coach Pipal's letter to Coach Henderson was
greatly misinterpreted by the press. Pipal explained
that he could not play U. S. C, after he had met
•Stanford because his men would not be in shape.
On October 20 his team will be at the height of its
training, while Stanford will be only in mid-season
form. The U. S. C.-Occidental game has always
been played later in the season, giving the Trojans
the full advantage of their strength. Thus by
scheduling an early-season game Occidental has a
chance to play on a fairly even basis. This, inci
dentally, is the type of game Stanford wants at
that stage of her season.
Caustic remarks made at the time of the announce
ment of Occidental's change from U. S. C. to Stan
ford can now only emphasize the fine attitude shown
by Occidental and at the same time reflect in a nega
tive light upon the misinterpreter of the facts.
The Daily wishes to thank President Bird for
taking the trouble to investigate the matter and to
bring the facts to public attention. Stanford is not
only glad but proud to include on her football sched
ule a college with so keen a sense of sportsmanship.
Relations between Stanford and Occidental should
henceforth be on a friendly and firm basis.
