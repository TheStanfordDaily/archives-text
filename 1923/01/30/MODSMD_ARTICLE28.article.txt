### 
There is no necessity for going to the extremes
of dancing reform on the Campus so far as appear
ances are concerned. It is only environment after
all that determines whether or not a dance is ques
tionable. But when it comes to off-campus dancing,
fine distinctions must sometimes be drawn in order
to conform to house rules.
Numbers of visitors at the Community House in
Palo Alto have come away somewhat taken aback by
the conduct of students on the dance floor. Al
though none of the dancing recently seen there has
been very bad, it has at any rate been distasteful to
some people. Inasmuch as Community House au
thorities are under no obligations to campus pat
ronage, Stanford students who go there should be
guided by the rules which are rightfully enforced by
the people in charge. The Community House has
been of real service to many undergraduates and
will continue to be in the future if Stanford people
will be good enough to conduct themselves accord
ing to its few but good regulations.
