# NEW GRADUATE MANAGER
## 
### 
Tn Paul Davis Stanford has a new graduate man
ager who will be well able to fill the place. He is
neither new to the game nor in any way out of
touch with athletic affairs. For more than a year
he lias been a member of Fletcher's staff and has
largely on his own initiative built up a system of
handling crowds at games that has been equaled
by 110 other coast university.
Davis will be able to step in where Fletcher leaves
off next September and there assume the reins of
responsibility without a hitch in athletic affairs.
Between now and the time when his appointment
takes effect he will be in a position to get the benefit
of experience. From outward appearances, 110
change in personnel should be apparent.
Stanford will never be able to keep another Bill
Fletcher for two years. Members of the Board of
Athletic Control have declared him to be a "Ten
thousand dollar man in a too-small job" and have not
exaggerated. Fletcher became manager when the
finances of the board were in a bad state and leaves
them in September in the best possible shape. He
has systematized and organized until routine work
is now the rule rather than the exception. Stanford
will long feci the benefits of his pioneer work in
his department.
