"Mere Man" could not know the
sting of a woman's tongue nor the
heights to which her ire may rise
when he attempted to question in bold
type her appropriateness as a part of
the Stanford family, in an article
which appeared in the Illustrated Re
view yesterday under the title, "What
About the Women Folks?" No bomb
ever started a bigger conflagration; no
hornets, rudely disturbed from a state
of domestic bliss, ever retaliated with
a sharper sting than did "the female
of the species" in this case.
The gasoline launch used by
"Husky" Guerena, crew coach, has
been painted cardinal.
All the men out for varsity practice
will be put through practice on the
Redwood estuary and the freshmen
will remain on Lagunita for the pres
ent.
Stanford meets the University of
Southern California basketball five for
the second time this season tomorrow
night in Encina gymnasium. The first
game which was played at the Los
Angeles Athletic Club on Stanford's
southern invasion, resulted in a 43-to
-28 victory for the Cards. California
won from U. S. C. last night at Berke
ley, 42-18.
Dedication of dances, an innovation
in the history of Stanford social func
tions, will be one of the features of
the University's first military ball to
be given by the R. O. T. C. February
17. Each dance will be dedicated to a
member of the corps in accordance
with a custom carried out at all sim
ilar affairs in the army.
