# "THE DAYS OF A MAN" IS GIVEN TO LIBRARY

### 
"The Days of a Man," Dr. David
Starr Jordan's autobiography, is a re
cent gift to the University library from
Caspar W. Hodgson, '96, of the World
Book Company, who published the sets.
This autobiography contains "Mem
ories of a naturalist, teacher, and
minor prophet of democracy." Dr.
Jordan says that he has lived three
lives more or less independentlyâ€”
that of the naturalist and explorer for
the love of it, that of the teacher also
for the love of it, and that of the
minor prophet from a sense of duty.
The viewpoint from which the book
is written is objective in nature. It is
the story of what one man did and saw
in the world about him. It is a record
of friendships, essentially, for, as Dr.
Jordan says, he seldom mentions any
one of whom he must speak disparag
ingly.
The period covered in the story ex
tends from 1851 to 1921. Dr. Jordan
takes up his ancestry briefly, and de
scribes his early life, his family's com
ing West, the Jordan farm, and his
boyish interests and education. He
tells with a good deal of detail, and
includes many anecdotes, of the found
ing of Stanford, and his travels and
studies in Europe, the Orient, Austra
lia. and the South Sea Islands.
Three hundred and ninety sets in
two volumes were published of this
autograpuhed de luxe edition. This set
is number sixty-six.
