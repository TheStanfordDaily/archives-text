# Card Light-Heavyweights Win From Palo Alto High
## 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound basketball team
defeated the Palo Altlo High School
quintet, 10 to 5, in a practice game in
the Pavilion, at 8:30 last night. The
game lasted but thirty minutes, and was
scheduled to give the 145 pounders an
opportunity to have some sort of work
out in the form of a game.
The team needs practice beyond a
doubt. It began the game strongly in the
lirst liali", but slowed down in the second,
scoring but two points in this period.
"Ted" Steffan, forward, will bear close
watching in the future. He is about
three-fourths of the Cardinal offensive
and a strong defensive player. He scored
eight of the ten points last night. Steffan
misses a great many easy shots by not
allowing himself sufficient time to aim,
but with two weeks of practice before
the next game with California, his ac
curacy should improve a great deal. In
the Berkeley game recently, the Blue and
Gold guards failed to locate him. but he
missed the hoop so often that his elu
siveness added little to the Stanford
scorc.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has been showing
the squad a few of the ropes, and is try
ing hard to develop a real basketball team
before February 9, when the light-heavies
meet the California quintet in a return
game.
