# Intramural Basketball Teams Show Material Improvement In Third Round Contests
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
In reviewing the third week of play!
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment, the most striking feature is the
great improvement shown by most of
the teams. League leaders have been
dropped from their high positions by
teams considered weak, and squads
which dropped their first or their first
and second games have come back
with a vengeance. In none of the six
leagues has the race been definitely
settled and in every league there are
more than two closely competing
teams.
The scores during the second week
of the tournament were considerably
lower and closer than in the early
games, indicating closer guarding by
all teams, more teamwork, and a ten
dency toward equality. In most cases,
except where two unevenly matched
teams were again opponents, there
were no outstanding stars, every man
doing his share for the victory of his
squad. A few teams have developed'
one man to do all their shooting for
them, but the work of the other play
ers ultimately leads to passes to their
star basket shooter who breaks away
for his shots.
As the games have become more
even and hotly contested, the players
have put all they had into the game.
A number of the games have been
rough beyond all necessity, nothing
less than indoor football. Fouls both!
technical and personal have been
called but the game continues to be
rough. Players who are tired out are
most prone to holding and rough play
ing. To avoid being put out of the
game on fouls, as has happened in one
or two instances, the players should
either condition themselves to meet
the opposition or else be satsified to
let their men get away from them
when they can no longer keep up with
them.
Beta Theta Pi leads the eight teams!
in League 1, having won all three j
games played so far. One team, En-1
cina Hall first floor, forfeited to them j
and the other two games were won
against weak teams, so no real test
has been given them as yet. Alpha
Delta Phi has won two games and lost:
one, one of their victories being
against Delta Kappa Epsilon with
whom they are tied for second place.;
The Breakers and the Japanese are
also tied for second place with Alpha
Delta Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon, |
all four teams having won two and
lost one game.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Campo
are tied for first place in League 2.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon shows the great
er strength, having defeated El Cuadro
which was supposedly the strongest
team in the league. El Cuadro must
est team in the league. El Cuadro
now defeat the winner of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon-El Campo game in order j
to tie for first place in the league.
In League 3, Sequoia Hall, first
floor, is tied with Phi Kappa Psi and
El Tigre for first place, each having
won two games and lost one. The
Sequoia team was in the lead until it
lost a close game to Phi Kappa Psi
last week. With three games out of
five played by all the teams, the three,
leaders will have to fight it out for j
the supremacy in the league. Teams j
which have dropped three games are
practically out of the running and most
of those which have lost two games i
cannot hope for ultimate victory.
Delta Chi leads the teams in League
4 with three wins and no defeats but
three other teams are running a close
second with only one loss each. Alpha

! Kappa Lambda, Phi Delta Theta, and
Alpha Tau Omega are still in the race
for honors and a victory for any one
of them over Delta Chi will give that
team first place.
Delta Tau Delta holds the top of
League 5 alone, but three other teams
follow closely behind. Delta Tau Delta
has won three games. Sigma Nu, Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Chi Psi have each
won two and lost one. A defeat by any
one of these teams topples Delta Tau
Delta from the top of the heap.
Theta Chi and Sigma Chi have un
disputed possession of the leadership
of League 6. Both teams have won
three games each, and are about even
according to comparative scores. Sig
ma Chi defeated Sequoia Hall, second
floor, 11-7, and Theta Chi beat them
14-10. The Sigma Chi team took their
game from El Toro 18-10 and Theta
Chi won 20-9. Los Arcos is the nearest
rival, having won two games and lost
one. Theta Chi beat them 11-2.
Twelve high point scorers in the six
leagues are:
1. Aydelotte—Sigma Nu.„ 27

In reviewing the third week of play!
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment, the most striking feature is the
great improvement shown by most of
the teams. League leaders have been
dropped from their high positions by
teams considered weak, and squads
which dropped their first or their first
and second games have come back
with a vengeance. In none of the six
leagues has the race been definitely
settled and in every league there are
more than two closely competing
teams.
The scores during the second week
of the tournament were considerably
lower and closer than in the early
games, indicating closer guarding by
all teams, more teamwork, and a ten
dency toward equality. In most cases,
except where two unevenly matched
teams were again opponents, there
were no outstanding stars, every man
doing his share for the victory of his
squad. A few teams have developed'
one man to do all their shooting for
them, but the work of the other play
ers ultimately leads to passes to their
star basket shooter who breaks away
for his shots.
As the games have become more
even and hotly contested, the players
have put all they had into the game.
A number of the games have been
rough beyond all necessity, nothing
less than indoor football. Fouls both!
technical and personal have been
called but the game continues to be
rough. Players who are tired out are
most prone to holding and rough play
ing. To avoid being put out of the
game on fouls, as has happened in one
or two instances, the players should
either condition themselves to meet
the opposition or else be satsified to
let their men get away from them
when they can no longer keep up with
them.
Beta Theta Pi leads the eight teams!
in League 1, having won all three j
games played so far. One team, En-1
cina Hall first floor, forfeited to them j
and the other two games were won
against weak teams, so no real test
has been given them as yet. Alpha
Delta Phi has won two games and lost:
one, one of their victories being
against Delta Kappa Epsilon with
whom they are tied for second place.;
The Breakers and the Japanese are
also tied for second place with Alpha
Delta Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon, |
all four teams having won two and
lost one game.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Campo
are tied for first place in League 2.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon shows the great
er strength, having defeated El Cuadro
which was supposedly the strongest
team in the league. El Cuadro must
est team in the league. El Cuadro
now defeat the winner of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon-El Campo game in order j
to tie for first place in the league.
In League 3, Sequoia Hall, first
floor, is tied with Phi Kappa Psi and
El Tigre for first place, each having
won two games and lost one. The
Sequoia team was in the lead until it
lost a close game to Phi Kappa Psi
last week. With three games out of
five played by all the teams, the three,
leaders will have to fight it out for j
the supremacy in the league. Teams j
which have dropped three games are
practically out of the running and most
of those which have lost two games i
cannot hope for ultimate victory.
Delta Chi leads the teams in League
4 with three wins and no defeats but
three other teams are running a close
second with only one loss each. Alpha

! Kappa Lambda, Phi Delta Theta, and
Alpha Tau Omega are still in the race
for honors and a victory for any one
of them over Delta Chi will give that
team first place.
Delta Tau Delta holds the top of
League 5 alone, but three other teams
follow closely behind. Delta Tau Delta
has won three games. Sigma Nu, Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Chi Psi have each
won two and lost one. A defeat by any
one of these teams topples Delta Tau
Delta from the top of the heap.
Theta Chi and Sigma Chi have un
disputed possession of the leadership
of League 6. Both teams have won
three games each, and are about even
according to comparative scores. Sig
ma Chi defeated Sequoia Hall, second
floor, 11-7, and Theta Chi beat them
14-10. The Sigma Chi team took their
game from El Toro 18-10 and Theta
Chi won 20-9. Los Arcos is the nearest
rival, having won two games and lost
one. Theta Chi beat them 11-2.

also tied for second place with Alpha
Delta Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon, |
all four teams having won two and
lost one game.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Campo
are tied for first place in League 2.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon shows the great
er strength, having defeated El Cuadro
which was supposedly the strongest
team in the league. El Cuadro must
est team in the league. El Cuadro
now defeat the winner of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon-El Campo game in order j
to tie for first place in the league.
In League 3, Sequoia Hall, first
floor, is tied with Phi Kappa Psi and
El Tigre for first place, each having
won two games and lost one. The
Sequoia team was in the lead until it
lost a close game to Phi Kappa Psi
last week. With three games out of
five played by all the teams, the three,
leaders will have to fight it out for j
the supremacy in the league. Teams j
which have dropped three games are
practically out of the running and most
of those which have lost two games i
cannot hope for ultimate victory.
Delta Chi leads the teams in League
4 with three wins and no defeats but
three other teams are running a close
second with only one loss each. Alpha

! Kappa Lambda, Phi Delta Theta, and
Alpha Tau Omega are still in the race
for honors and a victory for any one
of them over Delta Chi will give that
team first place.
Delta Tau Delta holds the top of
League 5 alone, but three other teams
follow closely behind. Delta Tau Delta
has won three games. Sigma Nu, Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Chi Psi have each
won two and lost one. A defeat by any
one of these teams topples Delta Tau
Delta from the top of the heap.
Theta Chi and Sigma Chi have un
disputed possession of the leadership
of League 6. Both teams have won
three games each, and are about even
according to comparative scores. Sig
ma Chi defeated Sequoia Hall, second
floor, 11-7, and Theta Chi beat them
14-10. The Sigma Chi team took their
game from El Toro 18-10 and Theta
Chi won 20-9. Los Arcos is the nearest
rival, having won two games and lost
one. Theta Chi beat them 11-2.

In reviewing the third week of play!
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment, the most striking feature is the
great improvement shown by most of
the teams. League leaders have been
dropped from their high positions by
teams considered weak, and squads
which dropped their first or their first
and second games have come back
with a vengeance. In none of the six
leagues has the race been definitely
settled and in every league there are
more than two closely competing
teams.
The scores during the second week
of the tournament were considerably
lower and closer than in the early
games, indicating closer guarding by
all teams, more teamwork, and a ten
dency toward equality. In most cases,
except where two unevenly matched
teams were again opponents, there
were no outstanding stars, every man
doing his share for the victory of his
squad. A few teams have developed'
one man to do all their shooting for
them, but the work of the other play
ers ultimately leads to passes to their
star basket shooter who breaks away
for his shots.
As the games have become more
even and hotly contested, the players
have put all they had into the game.
A number of the games have been
rough beyond all necessity, nothing
less than indoor football. Fouls both!
technical and personal have been
called but the game continues to be
rough. Players who are tired out are
most prone to holding and rough play
ing. To avoid being put out of the
game on fouls, as has happened in one
or two instances, the players should
either condition themselves to meet
the opposition or else be satsified to
let their men get away from them
when they can no longer keep up with
them.
Beta Theta Pi leads the eight teams!
in League 1, having won all three j
games played so far. One team, En-1
cina Hall first floor, forfeited to them j
and the other two games were won
against weak teams, so no real test
has been given them as yet. Alpha
Delta Phi has won two games and lost:
one, one of their victories being
against Delta Kappa Epsilon with
whom they are tied for second place.;

In reviewing the third week of play!
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment, the most striking feature is the
great improvement shown by most of
the teams. League leaders have been
dropped from their high positions by
teams considered weak, and squads
which dropped their first or their first
and second games have come back
with a vengeance. In none of the six
leagues has the race been definitely
settled and in every league there are
more than two closely competing
teams.
The scores during the second week
of the tournament were considerably
lower and closer than in the early
games, indicating closer guarding by
all teams, more teamwork, and a ten
dency toward equality. In most cases,
except where two unevenly matched
teams were again opponents, there
were no outstanding stars, every man
doing his share for the victory of his
squad. A few teams have developed'
one man to do all their shooting for
them, but the work of the other play
ers ultimately leads to passes to their
star basket shooter who breaks away
for his shots.
As the games have become more
even and hotly contested, the players
have put all they had into the game.
A number of the games have been
rough beyond all necessity, nothing
less than indoor football. Fouls both!
technical and personal have been
called but the game continues to be
rough. Players who are tired out are
most prone to holding and rough play
ing. To avoid being put out of the
game on fouls, as has happened in one
or two instances, the players should
either condition themselves to meet
the opposition or else be satsified to
let their men get away from them
when they can no longer keep up with
them.
Beta Theta Pi leads the eight teams!
in League 1, having won all three j
games played so far. One team, En-1
cina Hall first floor, forfeited to them j
and the other two games were won
against weak teams, so no real test
has been given them as yet. Alpha
Delta Phi has won two games and lost:
one, one of their victories being
against Delta Kappa Epsilon with
whom they are tied for second place.;
The Breakers and the Japanese are
also tied for second place with Alpha
Delta Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon, |
all four teams having won two and
lost one game.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Campo
are tied for first place in League 2.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon shows the great
er strength, having defeated El Cuadro
which was supposedly the strongest
team in the league. El Cuadro must
est team in the league. El Cuadro
now defeat the winner of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon-El Campo game in order j
to tie for first place in the league.
In League 3, Sequoia Hall, first
floor, is tied with Phi Kappa Psi and
El Tigre for first place, each having
won two games and lost one. The
Sequoia team was in the lead until it
lost a close game to Phi Kappa Psi
last week. With three games out of
five played by all the teams, the three,
leaders will have to fight it out for j
the supremacy in the league. Teams j
which have dropped three games are
practically out of the running and most
of those which have lost two games i
cannot hope for ultimate victory.
Delta Chi leads the teams in League
4 with three wins and no defeats but
three other teams are running a close
second with only one loss each. Alpha

! Kappa Lambda, Phi Delta Theta, and
Alpha Tau Omega are still in the race
for honors and a victory for any one
of them over Delta Chi will give that
team first place.
Delta Tau Delta holds the top of
League 5 alone, but three other teams
follow closely behind. Delta Tau Delta
has won three games. Sigma Nu, Phi
Kappa Sigma, and Chi Psi have each
won two and lost one. A defeat by any
one of these teams topples Delta Tau
Delta from the top of the heap.
Theta Chi and Sigma Chi have un
disputed possession of the leadership
of League 6. Both teams have won
three games each, and are about even
according to comparative scores. Sig
ma Chi defeated Sequoia Hall, second
floor, 11-7, and Theta Chi beat them
14-10. The Sigma Chi team took their
game from El Toro 18-10 and Theta
Chi won 20-9. Los Arcos is the nearest
rival, having won two games and lost
one. Theta Chi beat them 11-2.
Twelve high point scorers in the six
leagues are:
1. Aydelotte—Sigma Nu.„ 27
2. Timmons —Sequoia first 26
3. Barham —Theta Delta Chi 21
4. Peavy—Breakers 21
5. Blacker —Los Arcos 20
6. Middleton —Kappa Sigma 19
7. Driscoll —Phi Delta Theta 19
8. Alabaster —Beta Theta Pi 18
