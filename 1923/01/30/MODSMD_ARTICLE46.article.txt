## AUTOMOBILE SECTION "How High Is Up? Also How Low Is Down?" Is San Franciscan's Query 
### EDITED BY JACK GRAVES 
Equally absurd seems the question pro
posed by Frederick 112. Jackson of San
Francisco, writing in the Chronicle,
"How much is straight out?" His ar
ticle continues: "But these questions
are asked several thousand times a day
right here in San Francisco by harrassed
automobile drivers, who, by headwork or
quick use of the brakes, narrowly avoid
accidents after wrong signals for turns
have been given by careless or ignorant
motorists.

"When the man ahead holds his left
arm upward at a 45 degree angle the
driver following him naturally presumes
that a right-hand turn has been signaled.
But when the motorist who lias given
the signal suddenly swerves into a left
hand turn â€”well, very often his ancestry
is cursed even to the seventh generation.
"Equally liable to execration and a
sudden smash-up is the man who care
lessly, lazily, holds his left arm down at
a 45 degree angle, which means that he
is slowing down or stopping, and who
then turns to the left.
"How high is up, and how low is
I down?"
