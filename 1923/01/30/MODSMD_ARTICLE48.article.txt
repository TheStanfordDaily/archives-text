# PUBLICITY GOES TO ANCIENTS' HEADS; CHALLENGE TO RACE
## 
### 
Following the printing of a news item
in last week's automobile section re-
I ferring to the speed that some machines
! of more or less ancient vintage can make,
' the following challenge was received:
"The speed drivers of the 'Yellow Peril,'
lso known as the Isota Fraschini Milano,
and the 'White Ghost,' also known as the
Premier 4-40, do hereby challenge any
driver to a test of speed, the Daily Palo
Alto providing the trophy, under the fol
lowing conditions: (1) Cars entered
must have equal displacement and

weight; (2) direction of race to be side
ways, forward, backward, up and down,
or upside down; (3) cars must qualify
by emitting as much noise and smoke as
those belonging to said drivers."
The editor of the automobile section
will supply a suitable trophy providing
the contestants will make the other ar
rangements for a five-mile race, and that
the average speed be not less than fifty
miles per hour, which is twelve miles per
hour less than the winning car in the
San Francisco race mentioned last week.
