"A few chapters from an expense book
will explain Germany's financial situation
more graphically than theorizing," was a
recent statement of Mr. Cooper's. "The :
cost and conditions of living in Germany
are difficult to appreciate unless experi
enced. People who have invested in
bonds and mortgages originally worth
$1000 might possibly be able to sell them
now for 17 cents."

the middle class of Germans was of espe
cial interest to Professor Cooper, and he
intends to limit his talk to this particular
