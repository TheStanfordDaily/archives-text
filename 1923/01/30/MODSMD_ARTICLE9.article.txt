# Ram's Head Rehearsals Move to Assembly Hall
## 
### 
Rehearsing for the Ram's Head Show,
to be given on February 16, has com
menced in earnest this week, both for the
cast and the chorus. The Assembly hall
stage is now available for the work, as
the Masquers' Play is off the boards.
The principals are working from 4 til!
6 each afternoon. According to Director
Rayley, the public is due for a surprise
when some of the new members of the
cast get in their work before the foot
lights.
Bayley has developed and is teaching
the first-act steps to the chorus this week.
By the end of the week he hopes to be
able to take up the second act.
