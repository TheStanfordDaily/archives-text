### Howard Bissell, '24 
Phi Kappa Psi by defeating Theta
Delta Chi 16-11 and El Tigre by de
feating Delta Upsilon 25-9 yesterday
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment tied for first place in League 4
and practically eliminated Sequoia
Hall, first floor, team from the race.
In the other games scheduled, Alpha
Tau Omega forfeited their game to
Alpha Kappa Lambda and Phi Delta
Theta won from El Capitan 21-8.
Theta Delta Chi Holds Phi Kappa
Psi at Bay for One Half Only
Phi Kappa Psi and Theta Delta Chi
fought on even terras during the first
half of their game and emerged at the
intermission with the score 7-6 in
favor of Theta Delta Chi. Barham car
ried the ball down the floor and shot
it through the hoop twice for scores
and Trago made the other basket for
Theta Delta Chi. A free throw gave
them the one-point advantage over the
Phi Kappa Psi team which had tallied
three times on baskets by Newlin and
McAllister.
The Theta Delta Chi team lost its
pep and effectiveness durng thÂ« last
half of the game and Barham was the
only one to cage a shot. All of the Phi
Kappa Psi men located the hoop in
the final period and increased the lead
over Theta Delta Chi to five points,
the final score being 16-11.
Barham was the best man Theta
Delta Chi put on the floor, making
three baskets and one free throw. Had
he been able to continue his clever
dribblng through the Phi Kappa Psi
defense in the second half or had an
equal at forward to relieve him of
part of his job the Theta Delta Chi
team would have run the score up
closer to that of their opponents. Mc-
Allister showed up to the best advan
tage for Phi Kappa Psi, with three
field goals and some fine defensive
work as guard. Newlin continued his
scoring streak with two goals from the
floor.
Butterfield in Good Form as
El Tigre Trims Delta Upsilon
El Tigre showed its real form last
night when it completely outclassed
Delta Upsilon 25-9 in a fast but un
contested game. At no time did the
Delta Upsilon forwards get dangerous
and the El Tigre players had the ball
in their possession most of the game.
Butterfield led the field in scoring
with five baskets to his credit. Every
other player scored one basket and
Coda and Kennedy caged all the free
throws, thus giving El Tigre their
maximum of points. Black made three
baskets for Delta Upsilon and Miller
the other one scored by their team.
The El Tigre team by its defeat of
the Phi Kappa Psi team earlier in the
tournament now stands out as the
probable winner in League 3 in spite
of one loss received from the Sequoia
Hall, first floor, team. The one game
yet to be played should be won easily
if the form displayed last night is re-
tained. The quintet played well as a
team and showed individual ability as
well. The floor work was noticeably
good and the basket shooting of But
terfield was accurate from all parts of
the floor. The best work done by the
Delta Upsilon forwards came early in
the second half when Green and Black
paired off and rushed the ball down to
the basket, making two successful
goals.
Phi Delta Theta Cage Machine
Works to Perfection and Wins
With the exception of Wren at
standing guard for Phi Delta Theta,
the rest of the players scored at least
two field goals and showed a well or
ganized offensive attack with plenty
of teamwork and a minimum of indi
vidual performance. With such a ma
chine, Phi Delta Theta had no trouble
in downing El Capitan 21-8. Logan and
Merrill led in the attack with three
baskets apiece. Both men showed a
clever brand of dribbling and resorted
to the pass instead of the long shot
as the weaker teams are inclined to
do. This pair with Fletcher formed a
forward line which penetrated the El
Capitan defense at all times. They
scored frequently and consistently and
were stopped at no time. The Phi Delta
Theta defense was as good as the of
fense and Walker was the only one of
the El Capitan players to break
through it. His two baskets accounted
for all of his team's score by the floor
route. White increased the total by
three free throws.
Alpha Tau Omega Forfeits
To Alpha Kappa Lambda Team
In the last game scheduled for last
night, Alpha Tau Omega forfeited to
Alpha Kappa Lambda. This eliminates
Alpha Tau Omega from the race for
honors in League 4 since they now
have two victories and two defeats.
Alpha Kappa Lambda and Phi Kappa
Psi are now tied for second place with
three wins and one loss after their
games of yesterday. Delta Chi still
leads the league with three victories;
but a defeat by Zeta Psi today will put
the three leaders in a triple tie.
Today's games as scheduled are:
Delta Chi and Zeta Psi, 5 p. m.; Phi;
Kappa Sigma and Kappa Alpha, 5:40
p. m.; Delta Tau Delta and Sigma Nu,
7:15 p. m.; Chi Psi and Alpha Sigma
Phi, 8 p. m.
The games on the schedule for to
morrow are: Sigma Chi and Los Ar
cos, 5 p. m.; Encina Hall, fifth floor,
and Theta Chi, 5:40 p. m.; Sequoia
Hall, second floor, and El Toro, 7:15
