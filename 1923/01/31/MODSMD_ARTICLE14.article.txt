In a little cubby hole, James Delkins
started the Encina Haberdashery on the
first floor of Encina hall over a year
and a half ago. Into this place, which
seeed to have been forgotten and re
discovered by accident, was piled a stock
of shirts, cuff links, stationery, B.V.D.'s,
pajamas, and dozens of other sundry ar
ticles that a Stanford man has use for
in emergency.
Many students wondered how an entire j
haberdashery could, he crowded into a
space ten feet square. They may stop
any time now.
The new Encina Haberdashery, after
eighteen months of stunted growth, has j
blossomed out into larger quarters. A
brightly illuminated showcase, display
window, a private office, and a greater
number of shelves now makes Delkin's!
shop lill a regular sized room.
