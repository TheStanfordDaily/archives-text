# "GERMANY OF TODAY IS LIKE ECONOMIC EARTHQUAKE"
## Speaker Describes Financial Havoc Created by Marks' Depreciation; Prohibitive Prices and Taxation 
### 
"The hand wagon, Germany's new
mode of transportation, suggests the
survivor trudging along in the debris of
an economic earthquake . . . the aft
ermath of war. Endless lines of them
are seen everywhere in the country, and
all but high-born ladies and gentlemen
use them." In these words Professor
William Cooper typified the change from
post-war Germany in his talk last night
on "Five Months in Germany."
Although the German people are seri
ously crippled by a meteoric tumble of
the mark equal to that of the Austrian
crown, they manage to make a neat ap
pearanc in patched clothes, and they clean
up the "back yards" of their cities, ac- 1
cording to the observations of the lec- j
turer. Those richer classes that tour- i
ists now see in cafes and at the opera'
are not the prewar intellectual types, but
factory workers, who sit in the best
seats at "Lohengrin" and eat sandwiches
during intermissions, he declared.
As a whole, the financial situation is a 1
desperate one, which will create havoc
with German trade when the mark begins i
to rise in value, the lecturer believes.
''The enormous taxes can be met only be
cause those of the preceding year are
paid with this year's much depreciated i
marks," said Professor Cooper.
Tn giving examples of tax rates he
quoted a number of actual cases: a stock j
company for manufacturing machinery
was required to pay, on il irtecn million
marks profit, more than nineteen million
marks in taxes; and the municipal busi
ness license tax ranges from 6 3-4 per
cent on 30.000 marks t.i 50 per cent on
500,000 marks, which is now the equiva
lent of $15.
What lias caused this financial col
lapse? "Government propaganda lays
the blame upon reparations payments,"
said the speaker. "Rather, it is the over
working of the government printing press
in attempting to pay in paper marks.
There is an evident flight of capital to
foreign countries, for the proof is ioun-.l
in new laws prohibiting such a pro
cedure."
Food, fuel, and clothing are sold at
almost prohibitive prices in Germany
this winter, Professor Cooper estimated.
'"Those people most in want are the mid
dle class— the doctors, lawyers, writers,
and small investors," he said. "These
people, who before the war lived in com
fort and even luxury, are now living
o i an annual income that will not buy
a pair of shoes."

marks," said Professor Cooper.
Tn giving examples of tax rates he
quoted a number of actual cases: a stock j
company for manufacturing machinery
was required to pay, on il irtecn million
marks profit, more than nineteen million
marks in taxes; and the municipal busi
ness license tax ranges from 6 3-4 per
cent on 30.000 marks t.i 50 per cent on
500,000 marks, which is now the equiva
lent of $15.
What lias caused this financial col
lapse? "Government propaganda lays
the blame upon reparations payments,"
said the speaker. "Rather, it is the over
working of the government printing press
in attempting to pay in paper marks.
There is an evident flight of capital to
foreign countries, for the proof is ioun-.l
in new laws prohibiting such a pro
cedure."
Food, fuel, and clothing are sold at
almost prohibitive prices in Germany
this winter, Professor Cooper estimated.
'"Those people most in want are the mid
dle class— the doctors, lawyers, writers,
and small investors," he said. "These
people, who before the war lived in com
fort and even luxury, are now living
o i an annual income that will not buy
a pair of shoes."
"The hand wagon, Germany's new
mode of transportation, suggests the
survivor trudging along in the debris of
an economic earthquake . . . the aft
ermath of war. Endless lines of them
are seen everywhere in the country, and
all but high-born ladies and gentlemen
use them." In these words Professor
William Cooper typified the change from
post-war Germany in his talk last night
on "Five Months in Germany."
Although the German people are seri
ously crippled by a meteoric tumble of
the mark equal to that of the Austrian
crown, they manage to make a neat ap
pearanc in patched clothes, and they clean
up the "back yards" of their cities, ac- 1
cording to the observations of the lec- j
turer. Those richer classes that tour- i
ists now see in cafes and at the opera'
are not the prewar intellectual types, but
factory workers, who sit in the best
seats at "Lohengrin" and eat sandwiches
during intermissions, he declared.
As a whole, the financial situation is a 1
desperate one, which will create havoc
with German trade when the mark begins i
to rise in value, the lecturer believes.
''The enormous taxes can be met only be
cause those of the preceding year are
paid with this year's much depreciated i
marks," said Professor Cooper.
