# CARDS TO MEET TROJANS FRIDAY ON LOCAL COURT
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference basketball
will open at Stanford Friday, when the
Cardinal varsity meets the Trojan live
in the Pavilion. U. S. C. will play a
two-game scries with Stanford here,
while next week Kerr will take his squad
south for a return scries with the Tro
jans.
Probably the biggest upset of the Coast
Conference schedule this year was the
defeat of the University of California
team by the U. S. C. quintet last Satur
day. After losing the first game of the
series by an overwhelming score and
showing very little basketball, the Tro
jans came back the second night and
held the Blue and Gold forwards to a
low score, while they ran up a large
count against the Bruin guards.
From the looks of the roster of the
squad, U. S. C. has turned most of their
football stars into basketball players.
Campbell, Calland, Pliytliian, and Ander
son are some of the boys of gridiron
fame who are cavorting around on the
basketball court for Coach Les Turner.
Should Stanford take both games from
the University crowd, she will be leading

the southern confcrence teams, while if
the series is split between the two teams,
there will be a triple ti between U. S. C.,
Stanford, and California. In the north
ern section of the conference there is a
big mixup in the standings, and at pres
ent all of the leaders have lost at least
one game.
Early in the season, Idaho, the winner
of the 1922 schedule, looked to be the
possible winner again this year with a big
squad of veterans back. Three teams
have beaten them so far. however, so
they are practically out of the running.
Oregon O. A. C. and the University of
Washington all have top-notch teams,
with Oregon standing out as the best
offensive five in the Northwest.
Stanford's basketball stock took a big
jump Monday night when Dudley Dc
Groot appeared on the floor in a uni
form. The big guard is still limping to
some extent, but is wearing a special
brace to support his knee. Kerr has been
letting him take it easy this week and
it will probably be a week or more be
fore lie gets settled down to the grind
of getting into condition.
