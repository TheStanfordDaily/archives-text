# LIGHTWEIGHT SQUAD PLAYS PRELIMINARY CAGE GAME TONIGHT
## 
### 
It is uncertain, to date, who the
Stanford 130-pound Stanford team will
play in the preliminary game to the
Freshman-Berkeley High School con
test in the Pavilion tonight. A game
has been lined up with the San Fran
cisco Poleteehnic High School Quintet,
and if this tilt falls through, the light
weights will meet the Palo Alto High
School five. At any event there will be
a game for the Stanford 130>'s at 7:00
o'clock sharp.
The squad will be greatly handi
capped by the loss of Captain Meyers
who sprained his ankle in scrimmage
Monday night. Meyers will be greatly
missed. "Bud" Young will take his
place as forward, and Shultzberg will
play Young's position at guard.
If the lightweights hook up with the
Palo Alto High aggregation, they have
the dope all on their side. They de
feated the town squad early in the
season by a score of 18-5, and should
be able to repeat the performance. It
is possible that the high school quintet
has become stronger, however, because
Monday night they put a scare into the
145-pound team by holding them to a
10-5 score.
The lightweights have been unde
feated this season,and have won all of
their contests by overwhelming scores
that left no doubt as to their superi
ority. In their game with California
the 130's exhibited strong defensive
and offensive teamwork, and had little
difficulty in penetrating the Berkeley
formations for a 21-9 score.
The Stanford team will no doubt
start the game with Young and Mey
ers, forwards; Shaw, center; Blosser
and Schultzberg, guards.
