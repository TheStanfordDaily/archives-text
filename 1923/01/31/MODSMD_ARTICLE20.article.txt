# Arbuckle's Reinstatement To Films Is Nestoria Topic
## 
### 
"Was Will Hays justified in reinstat
ing Fatty Arbuckle to the screen?"
"Nestoria will debate this subject at
its meeting tomorrow night in Room 12
of the Law building. This debate, post
poned from the last meeting gives prom
ise of interest, due to the stand taken by
Hays, and the resultant wave of thought
over the country that followed his de
cision.
Another interesting turn, is the stand
taken by Fatty Arbuckle, who believes
that some of our social customs are tin
just. Arbuckle says that the American
people have forgotten the spirit of for
giveness.
