# SANTA CLARA HIGH SCHOOL DEFEATS CARDINALS
## Ragged Play Features Downfall of 145-Pound Squad; Missionites Lead Locals Throughout Entire Game 
### 
Santa Clara's Prep School quintet
had no difficulty in outplaying the
Card 145-pounders in the Pavilion last
night and winning a ragged game 15
to 11.
The closest the light-heavies came
to catching up with the aggressive
Saints was in the third quarter when
they brought the score to 13-11 in the
visitors' favor.
The Stanford team failed to pene
trate the Santa Clara five-man defense.
Their passing was ragged, and uncer
tain, and the men on both teams han
dled the ball as if it were just out
of the fire. The first period ended
6 to 3 in favor of the Santa Clara
Preps.
Things livened up a bit when "Ted"
Steffan entered the game, but Santa
Clara also increased their efficiency
with the result that they maintained a
consistent lead to the end.
The second half was as ragged as
the first if not worst, but the players
found the hoop oftener. In the third
stanza things livened up a. bit, but it
was too late for the 145-pounders to
step in and win.
The light-heavyweights will have to
improve considerably if they expect to
make a showing against the California
squad February 9.
