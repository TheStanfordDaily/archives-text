# BERKELEY HIGH PLAYS BABES TONIGHT
## Prep Team Formerly Coached By Hunt Brings Second of Four Straight Victories 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
If the 1926 court team succeeds in
downing Berkeley High School quintet
tonight, the babes will turn a trick that
no freshman team has been able to do for
the past four years.
The lads from across the bay have
been bad medicine for yearling basketball
teams in the past and from their early
season record are bringing a strong ag
gregation to do battle with Hunt's
proteges.
Right here is where the Husky One's
squad of fighters enters into the story.
It is hard to predict how that team will
go in any game. After trimming the fast
Sacramento High School team 37-11, the
babes stood around while the Piedmont
High School five tacked a 28-13 defeat
on them the next week. And then, with
the California game but three days
away, the freshmen took a brace and put
up the battle of their lives against Coach
Price's Bear Cubs, only losing out in the
last few seconds of a thrilling contest by
three points.
It looked like the Cardinal babes were
over the hump in the California game,
but it looked the same way in the Sac
ramento game. If they are "right" to
night, they should find little difficulty in
sending the Berkeley preps home on the
short end of the score. If they are off
form, the preppers will probably bring
their string of victories over Cardinal
freshman teams to five.
Hunt sent his charges against the var
sity last night, and the yearlings looked
like a real basketball team. Kerr's squad
finally came, out on top, but by the small
est of margins. Nevers ran wild, playing
his usual fast floor game and sinking
several pretty field baskets. Frazier
showed signs of returning to his old time
game and looked better than lie has in
two weeks. Harris, the big fellow who
has gotten into one or two games at the
standing guard job showed up well and
probably earned himself the right to get
into the fracas tonight.
The Berkeley-Freshman game is the
main event tonight and will begin at 8:15.
