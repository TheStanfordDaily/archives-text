# THE 						PRACTICE SEASON CLOSES
## 
### 
Andy Kerr's quintet has gone through the pre
liminary season undefeated except by the 1921
Varsity, which doesn't count. The team has
shown constant, though sometimes slow, improve
ment and may now be counted as one of the chief
contenders for basketball honors in this section.
The College of the Pacific, Santa Clara, Nevada,
St. Mary's, and the Olympic Club have all been
taken into camp by a comfortable margin. Al
though California has beaten these same teams
by larger scores, the comparative strength of the
Cards and the Bears is no longer discouraging to
Stanford rooters. Moreover, the fact that the
Trojan five was able to defeat the Californians in
their second game shows that the Cards' ancient
rival is not invincible.
Nothing could do more to bring the student
body out of its present slump than a court win
from California. The Bears have been holding
the gonfalon long enough, and it is now time for
Stanford to trade the transbay team a sack for
the aforesaid trophy. Perhaps we speak of the
improbable, but the odds do not seem very great.
And, after all, there's no law against hoping,
which is a blessing, inasmuch as the Card rooter
these days hasn't much else to do.
