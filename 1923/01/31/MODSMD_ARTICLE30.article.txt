# SCHOLARSHIP HONORS
## 
### 
Some of us become prominent in the University
because we are the fortunate possessors of ath
letic ability. Some of us win approval on the
stage. College journalism is the chosen field of
others. Just managing things for the improvement
of all concerned suits the special talents of still
others. All of these must devote a certain amount
of time to their studies or fall by the way. But
there should be, ami there are, some students who
wish to devote their extra time and energies to their
University work. They may lie the stuff that schol
ars and investigators are made of. They have intel
lectual talents above the average man, and, what is
more, above the average student. Their greatest
possible contribution to the work of the world lies
in the cultivation and serious use of these talents.
They are not always given the recognition they de
serve. Opprobrious epithets like "grind and "dig
sometimes seem to be their chief share in college re
nown. It is fitting and proper that the University
should suitably recognize their achievements. To
do this, scholastic honors were originated.
When one finishes the Lower Division he may be
the recipient of Lower Division honors. Substan
tially one-tenth of those who successfully complete
the first two years receive these honors.
Each year thirty students are selected from the
Upper Division on the basis of high attainment, and
designated as Stanford Scholars. A minimum grade
point average of 2.40 is a condition of getting into
this group.
Finally, the A. B. degree is granted "with great
distinction" to the upper twentieth of the graduating
class, the same grade point average being required
as in the case of Stanford Scholars. The A. B. de
gree point average of 2:00, or 15. is required.
In the selection of Stanford Scholars and in the
award of graduation honors, special recommendation
from the student's major department, based on gen
uine accomplishment in the major subject, is con
sidered. The student may also improve his chance
for graduation honors by taking a comprehensive ex
amination in his major work and passing it with
excellence. The aim is to make depth in a single
line count as well as general good work in many
lines.

It is worth an extra push on one's attention to
work to receive one of these recognitions of high
attainment. Nor are they without value in the eyes
of possible employers after graduation. If one has
a fighting chance for a degree "with distinction" he
should learn the conditions of award and then "get
busy."

lectual talents above the average man, and, what is
more, above the average student. Their greatest
possible contribution to the work of the world lies
in the cultivation and serious use of these talents.
They are not always given the recognition they de
serve. Opprobrious epithets like "grind and "dig
sometimes seem to be their chief share in college re
nown. It is fitting and proper that the University
should suitably recognize their achievements. To
do this, scholastic honors were originated.
When one finishes the Lower Division he may be
the recipient of Lower Division honors. Substan
tially one-tenth of those who successfully complete
the first two years receive these honors.
Each year thirty students are selected from the
Upper Division on the basis of high attainment, and
designated as Stanford Scholars. A minimum grade
point average of 2.40 is a condition of getting into
this group.
Finally, the A. B. degree is granted "with great
distinction" to the upper twentieth of the graduating
class, the same grade point average being required
as in the case of Stanford Scholars. The A. B. de
gree point average of 2:00, or 15. is required.
In the selection of Stanford Scholars and in the
award of graduation honors, special recommendation
from the student's major department, based on gen
uine accomplishment in the major subject, is con
sidered. The student may also improve his chance
for graduation honors by taking a comprehensive ex
amination in his major work and passing it with
excellence. The aim is to make depth in a single
line count as well as general good work in many
lines.

It is worth an extra push on one's attention to
work to receive one of these recognitions of high
attainment. Nor are they without value in the eyes
of possible employers after graduation. If one has
a fighting chance for a degree "with distinction" he
should learn the conditions of award and then "get
busy."
Some of us become prominent in the University
because we are the fortunate possessors of ath
letic ability. Some of us win approval on the
stage. College journalism is the chosen field of
others. Just managing things for the improvement
of all concerned suits the special talents of still
others. All of these must devote a certain amount
of time to their studies or fall by the way. But
there should be, ami there are, some students who
wish to devote their extra time and energies to their
University work. They may lie the stuff that schol
ars and investigators are made of. They have intel
lectual talents above the average man, and, what is
more, above the average student. Their greatest
possible contribution to the work of the world lies
in the cultivation and serious use of these talents.
