Editor, Cabbages,
Djer Sir: —
Having noted your request for Cabbage contributors
with a great deal of contribution, I rush to offer you the
benefit of my discretion and experience. I have often
been a landscape and truck gardener for many years,
and know cabbages heart and soul. Allow me to assure
you that your next Tuesday column will be the best of
the year. I have already oiled my typewriter, but the
type of jokes I plan to grant you makes it foolish to
clean it. Yours for the noble vegetable,
Phinneas A. Rosenbloom.

P. S. Please don't use my right name. It confuses me.

Homer Cayenne claims that if the five-man defense
is developed much further, the referee will have toss
a coin to decide who wins the game.

One of the shine-parlors down in Paly has changed
hands. Due to the employment of a southpaw bootblack,
the Shinola is now applied with the left hand instead
of the right. Casper can short-change equally well with
both hands.

CABBAGES BOOK REVIEW: "Roller Skating
Through the Andes," by Rollo Wheeler. A smooth,
sinitous tale of traffic conditions in Hollywood, adroitly
censored.
"Pickwick Papers" anonymous. An intense, gripping
time-table between Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Portland. The "Limited" —through in a nght.

Cabbages begs leave to offer a condensed course in
the World's Literature, graded from the primary up.
Beginners should read "Babbitt" as a preliminary exer
cise and then tackle "Gargoyles." After that has been
thoroughly digested it will be best to proceed with
"Jurgen," which is not to be trifled with or taken
lightly. Senior students may learn how much they
don't know by a steady perusal of "Santazius Mallare"
and a Master's Degree goes with a successful examina
tion on "Batouala." New courses will be added upon
the discretion of Ben Hecht.
