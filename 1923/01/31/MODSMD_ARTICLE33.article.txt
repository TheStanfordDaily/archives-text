Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—lt seems that somebody
else has been thinking about the new
dormitory which athletic receipts are
to build. Much of the objection to this
scheme has been because of a mis
taken idea as to the method of financ
ing. As I understand it, the program
is this:
At the present time the Board is
paying $7500 annually on the basket
ball pavilion and is paying about $4500
interest on the loan. Thus the interest
each year becomes less, which means
that the available money will be more.
At the same time about $50,000 a year
is being paid on the Stadium. It has
been arranged for the Board to make
no payments on the dormitory for two
or three years, at which time the Sta
dium will be paid for and the $50,000
coming in each year may be devoted
to the payment of installments on the
new hall. At the rate of $50,000 a year,
the Board's new building should be
paid for within 16 or 18 years. Mean
while, the money spent on the Pavilion
will be less and less. Some people say,
to the contrary, the financing is quite
possible.
There is another side to the matter,
however. We join in the long loud cry
of the moralsts that amateur athletics
must be kept clean. They must not be
commercialized. The only excuse given
for charging admittance to amateur
games is that the sport must not only
pay for itself, but it must be promoted.
And now, instead of paying the costs
of athletics or advancing amateur
sports, the proceeds are diverted into
distinctly different channels. The stu
dent body pays $35,000 every year in
incidental fees directly into the Board
of Control budget. This is to pay
partly for admittance to games, partly
for gymnasium expenses, partly for
salaries. lit is just so much of an ad
dition to tuition. Too bad that the
Board couldn't have reduced tuition a
little by assuming ths $35,000 with the
$50,000i now to be used for other pur
poses.
The water polo team wants to make
a trip. The Board can't spare the
money. Like the children in Mobile,
the hunger for dormitories must be
fed.
The baseball team wants to go
south. It doesn't pay its own way and
so it probably won't go.
The students are still paying a dollar
each per quarter toward the Pavilion.
Another dollar added to tuition. If the
Board would pay this debt off in two
years, as it could with the $50,000, it
wouldn't have to pay the $4500 interest
every year. It could save thousands
of dollars right there. And at the same
time, the small but important sum of a
dollar per quarter could be knocked off
the students' expense accounts.
The best tennis team Stanford has
ever had was sent East last year. Who
sent. it. Not the Board. The students
held a spring Carnival, which is in
itself occasionally frowned upon and
once more the Board got out from
under. This will be repeated in the
spring.
Plans were made last year whereby
certain student activities were to be
subsidized by the Board of Control.
All such hopes are gone a-glimmering.
Additions are to be made to the gym
nasium offices. Ho, hum. We wonder
whose budget will be pared to meet
this expense. Some expenses come and
some may go, but the dormitories will
go on forever.
Which, after all, was the real reason
this viewpoint was written. It appears
that the contract for the dormitory in
question has been let, but this cry
from the wilderness is sounded in the
hope that the Board won't get Wool-
ideas and start up a chain of
dormitories. In other words, it ought
not to happen again and if it were
possible to stop the present proceed
ings, Stanford athletics should be ac
corded that small courtesy. They fur
nish the money but they don't get the
proper amount back.
As a last word, it is possible that
the dormitory was started with the
idea of curtailing the sudden expan
sion of athletics at Stanford. If such
was the case, it is to be admitted that
there may be some cause, but it would
have been better to have looked into
the future when gate receipts will drop
by the lowering of the price of Big
Game tickets by public demand and
the fabled annual $50,000 will have
dwindled to a measly $35,000.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—lt seems that somebody
else has been thinking about the new
dormitory which athletic receipts are
to build. Much of the objection to this
scheme has been because of a mis
taken idea as to the method of financ
ing. As I understand it, the program
is this:
At the present time the Board is
paying $7500 annually on the basket
ball pavilion and is paying about $4500
interest on the loan. Thus the interest
each year becomes less, which means
that the available money will be more.
At the same time about $50,000 a year
is being paid on the Stadium. It has
been arranged for the Board to make
no payments on the dormitory for two
or three years, at which time the Sta
dium will be paid for and the $50,000
coming in each year may be devoted
to the payment of installments on the
new hall. At the rate of $50,000 a year,
the Board's new building should be
paid for within 16 or 18 years. Mean
while, the money spent on the Pavilion
will be less and less. Some people say,
to the contrary, the financing is quite
possible.
There is another side to the matter,
however. We join in the long loud cry
of the moralsts that amateur athletics
must be kept clean. They must not be
commercialized. The only excuse given
for charging admittance to amateur
games is that the sport must not only
pay for itself, but it must be promoted.
And now, instead of paying the costs
of athletics or advancing amateur
sports, the proceeds are diverted into
distinctly different channels. The stu
dent body pays $35,000 every year in
incidental fees directly into the Board
of Control budget. This is to pay
partly for admittance to games, partly
for gymnasium expenses, partly for
salaries. lit is just so much of an ad
dition to tuition. Too bad that the
Board couldn't have reduced tuition a
little by assuming ths $35,000 with the
$50,000i now to be used for other pur
poses.
The water polo team wants to make
a trip. The Board can't spare the
money. Like the children in Mobile,
the hunger for dormitories must be
fed.
The baseball team wants to go
south. It doesn't pay its own way and
so it probably won't go.
The students are still paying a dollar
each per quarter toward the Pavilion.
Another dollar added to tuition. If the
Board would pay this debt off in two
years, as it could with the $50,000, it
wouldn't have to pay the $4500 interest
every year. It could save thousands
of dollars right there. And at the same
time, the small but important sum of a
dollar per quarter could be knocked off
the students' expense accounts.
The best tennis team Stanford has
ever had was sent East last year. Who
sent. it. Not the Board. The students
held a spring Carnival, which is in
itself occasionally frowned upon and
once more the Board got out from
under. This will be repeated in the
spring.
Plans were made last year whereby
certain student activities were to be
subsidized by the Board of Control.
All such hopes are gone a-glimmering.
Additions are to be made to the gym
nasium offices. Ho, hum. We wonder
whose budget will be pared to meet
this expense. Some expenses come and
some may go, but the dormitories will
go on forever.
Which, after all, was the real reason
this viewpoint was written. It appears
that the contract for the dormitory in
question has been let, but this cry
from the wilderness is sounded in the
hope that the Board won't get Wool-
ideas and start up a chain of
dormitories. In other words, it ought
not to happen again and if it were
possible to stop the present proceed
ings, Stanford athletics should be ac
corded that small courtesy. They fur
nish the money but they don't get the
proper amount back.
As a last word, it is possible that
the dormitory was started with the
idea of curtailing the sudden expan
sion of athletics at Stanford. If such
was the case, it is to be admitted that
there may be some cause, but it would

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—lt seems that somebody
else has been thinking about the new
dormitory which athletic receipts are
to build. Much of the objection to this
scheme has been because of a mis
taken idea as to the method of financ
ing. As I understand it, the program
is this:
At the present time the Board is
paying $7500 annually on the basket
ball pavilion and is paying about $4500
interest on the loan. Thus the interest
each year becomes less, which means
that the available money will be more.
At the same time about $50,000 a year
is being paid on the Stadium. It has
been arranged for the Board to make
no payments on the dormitory for two
or three years, at which time the Sta
dium will be paid for and the $50,000
coming in each year may be devoted
to the payment of installments on the
new hall. At the rate of $50,000 a year,
the Board's new building should be
paid for within 16 or 18 years. Mean
while, the money spent on the Pavilion
will be less and less. Some people say,
to the contrary, the financing is quite
possible.
There is another side to the matter,
however. We join in the long loud cry
of the moralsts that amateur athletics
must be kept clean. They must not be
commercialized. The only excuse given
for charging admittance to amateur
games is that the sport must not only
pay for itself, but it must be promoted.
And now, instead of paying the costs
of athletics or advancing amateur
sports, the proceeds are diverted into
distinctly different channels. The stu
dent body pays $35,000 every year in
incidental fees directly into the Board
of Control budget. This is to pay
partly for admittance to games, partly
for gymnasium expenses, partly for
salaries. lit is just so much of an ad
dition to tuition. Too bad that the
Board couldn't have reduced tuition a
little by assuming ths $35,000 with the
$50,000i now to be used for other pur
poses.
The water polo team wants to make
a trip. The Board can't spare the
money. Like the children in Mobile,
the hunger for dormitories must be
fed.
The baseball team wants to go
south. It doesn't pay its own way and
so it probably won't go.
The students are still paying a dollar
each per quarter toward the Pavilion.
Another dollar added to tuition. If the
Board would pay this debt off in two
years, as it could with the $50,000, it
wouldn't have to pay the $4500 interest
every year. It could save thousands
of dollars right there. And at the same
time, the small but important sum of a
dollar per quarter could be knocked off
the students' expense accounts.
The best tennis team Stanford has
ever had was sent East last year. Who
sent. it. Not the Board. The students
held a spring Carnival, which is in
itself occasionally frowned upon and
once more the Board got out from
under. This will be repeated in the
spring.
Plans were made last year whereby
certain student activities were to be
subsidized by the Board of Control.
All such hopes are gone a-glimmering.
Additions are to be made to the gym
nasium offices. Ho, hum. We wonder
whose budget will be pared to meet
this expense. Some expenses come and
some may go, but the dormitories will
go on forever.
Which, after all, was the real reason
this viewpoint was written. It appears
that the contract for the dormitory in
question has been let, but this cry
from the wilderness is sounded in the
hope that the Board won't get Wool-
ideas and start up a chain of
dormitories. In other words, it ought
not to happen again and if it were
possible to stop the present proceed
ings, Stanford athletics should be ac
corded that small courtesy. They fur
nish the money but they don't get the
proper amount back.
As a last word, it is possible that
the dormitory was started with the
idea of curtailing the sudden expan
sion of athletics at Stanford. If such
was the case, it is to be admitted that
there may be some cause, but it would
have been better to have looked into
the future when gate receipts will drop

Game tickets by public demand and
the fabled annual $50,000 will have
dwindled to a measly $35,000.
