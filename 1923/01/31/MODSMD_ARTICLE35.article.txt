and social service fields, will speak at
Stanford the first five days of March.
Robins is coming at the invitations of
the Y. M. C. A.and Y. W. C. A. of the
University.
With both teams putting their strong
est line-up on the floor, Stanford and the
University of Southern California basket
ball fives meet tonight in Encina gym
nasium. U. S. C. is anxious to get re
venge on the varsity for the 43 to 29
defeat administered earlier in the year,
while Stanford is anxious to keep the
slate clean for the series.
Tan bark brought from Redwood is
being worked into the track so as to give
it the right amount of spring. The use of
tan bark is something new, sawdust hav
ing been employed heretofore.
With crys of "Heaven help us," and
question of pertinent and sarcastic tone
that run the whole gamut of the subject
co-education, the "eternal feminine" as
sumes the austere role of an eternal ques
tioner. She has risen to besiege "Mere
Man" behind his stronghold of anonymity
in the last Illustrated Review, with flying
darts that are the telling results of femi
nine ire aroused to the nth degree. The
article attempted to question her appro
priateness as a part of the Stanford fam
ily.
Freshmen crew candidates will be di
vided into three eights, and one crew will
be taken to Redwood Monday. The men
have been working out so far this season
without being given any preference. The
eights chosen Monday will give the first
chance to judge the candidates who are
showing up well for places in the 1920
shell for the California race.
