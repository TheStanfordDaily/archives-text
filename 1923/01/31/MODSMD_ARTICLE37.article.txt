# U.C. PLANS SEVERAL NEW DORMITORY UNITS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. â€”
The land just north of the Greek Thea

ter has been chosen as the site of the
first dormitory on the campus. Later
two units will be constructed to the
west of the Greek Theater, and if
those do not prove sufficient to take
care of the situation, more units will
be added east of the Greek Theater,
Finances and plans for these build
ings will probably be arranged in time
to start excavations for the foundation
of the first unit before the end of the
spring semester.
