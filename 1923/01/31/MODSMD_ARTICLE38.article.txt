# EDUCATION BOARD POSTPONES CHANGES
## 
### 
"By recent action of the State Board
of Education, the requirement of thirty
one and one-half quarter hours of edu
cation, has been postponed until Septem
ber 15, 1923, and the old ruling which re
quired twenty-two and one-half hours
will hold for all qualifying for the
teachers certificate, not later than this
summer quarter. A letter from Superin
tendent Wood, just received, states that
the State Board of Education will waive
also, the requirement of a teachers course
in citizenship until September 15, but that
the courses in secondary education, junior
high school, and California school sys
tems and school law, will all be required
as part of the twenty-two and one-half
hours.
"The Faculty of the School of Educa
tion have changed the requirement of two
teaching majors, or one teaching major
and two minors, so that students may now
be certificated on completion of one
teaching major and one teaching minor,
who must complete two teaching minors
with the exception of education majors,
outside of the Department of Education."
ELLWOOD P. CUBBERLEY,
Dean of the School of Education.
