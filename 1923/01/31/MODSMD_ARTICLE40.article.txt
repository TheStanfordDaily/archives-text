# Adam vs. Adam's Rib; Wordy Forensic Clash On Boards Wednesday
## 
### 
Who was the head of the house,
Adam or Eve? This moot question,
which has been discussed more or less
heatedly in every household since the
beginning of time, will perhaps be set
tled this evening when Wrangler
and Euphronia freshmen are to clash
in a wordy argument at the Little
Theater.
The subject: Resolved, That profes
sional coaches should be abolished at
Stanford, promises to be the starting
point for a forensic clash that would
jar loose the proverbial eye-tooth of a
hen.
Rumors from the rival camps would
have it that everything from false
teeth to rats and hair-pins will be emit
ted from the theater during the course
of the struggle.
It is understood that the Wrangler
debaters have declared they will nei
ther try to vamp the judges, nor make
faces at the Euphronia debaters during
the argument. Euphronians base their
stand on the story of how Eve seduced
Adam into partaking of the dangerous
fruit, and thus causing themselves to
be thrust bodily from the garden.
"'None of them there seducers for us,"
was the statement issued to the press.
