# World May Have to Use Alcohol for Motor Fuel
## 
### 
The estimate of the gasoline that will
have to be produced for use as fuel in
internal combustion motors in 1923 is
5,670,000.000 gallons. At that rate the
end of the world's supply of available
mineral oil is not far off. What will be
used when the crude oil is exhausted?
Most scientists are inclined to think the
world will turn to alcohol and point to
the fact that as long as the sun shines
plants will grow, and alcohol can be
manufactured.
It is worth while in this connection to
note that the government of Brazil has
recommended the production of 14,000.-
(KX) gallons of alcohol in 1923 for the use
of South American automobiles. Alco
hol can be used as a motor fuel with
practically no changes in the engine..
