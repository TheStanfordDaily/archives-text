# WIERD TALES OF NA VAJOS TO BE SUBJECT OF TALK
## 
### 
Weird stories of Navajo life and cus
toms, startling disclosures of the mode
of existence of the wildest of these sav
ages, and anecdotes of the native tribes
to but few white people, will be
features of a talk to be given by Mrs.
John Weatherill in the Palo Alto Wom
en's Clubhouse Friday evening at 8
o'clock.
Mrs. Weatherill, for the past forty
years, has exercised an enormous in
fluence over the Indian tribes that dwell
in the desert country which joins the
three states of Arizona, New Mexico,
and Utah. She was adopted by the
Navajos because of their belief that she
wielded a mysterious power over the
scattered bands of savages. Ever since
then she has been official adviser to that
wild and desperate group of savages, and
has settled disputes, not only between
them and the government, but between
members of the tribe.
Mrs. Weatherill's talk will deal chiefly
with the most startling and curious in
cidents which it has been her fortune tb
observe. An example of the uniqueness
of her experiences among the Indians is
the reproductions which she has of the
long-looked-for, but elusive, sand-paint
ings. These masterpieces of Indian art
are regarded by the savages as being
valuable for medical purposes, casting a
charm over the evil spirits of sickness
They are traced in the sand in the morn
ing, and by sundown must be destroyed.

No copy of them is ever supposed to
exist.
However, an old Indian was persuaded
by Mrs. Weatherill to make crayon copies
of these examples of Indian art and
patience, with the result that Mrs.
Weatherill now has over seventy differ
ent reproductions. Had this been dis
covered by the other members of the
tribe, the old Indian would have been
m danger of his life; but the experiment
was successful and the long-hidden sand
paintings have now been brought to light.
Another curious incident experienced
by Mrs. Weatherill was the action of the
natives when being instructed in Biblical
history. On hearing the story of the
Ark, the whole tribe took up their tents
and moved sixty miles away to the top
of the highest mountain in the vicinity,
and it was only after much persuasion
that they were convinced they could de
scend to the lower land without danger
of being submerged.
Mrs. Weatherill is now visting in Palo
Alto, and this talk Friday evening will
be the only opportunity to hear her re
late her experiences with the Navajos.
Tickets, which are 50 cents apiece, are on
sale at Crandall's, Thoits', and the Se
quoia Bookshop. The proceeds will go
to the fund being established by the
Palo Alto Club, of which Mrs. Theodore
Hoov» r is president, for bringing to
Palo Alto children famous artists from
all parts of the state for lectures and
informal talks.

No copy of them is ever supposed to
exist.
However, an old Indian was persuaded
by Mrs. Weatherill to make crayon copies
of these examples of Indian art and
patience, with the result that Mrs.
Weatherill now has over seventy differ
ent reproductions. Had this been dis
covered by the other members of the
tribe, the old Indian would have been
m danger of his life; but the experiment
was successful and the long-hidden sand
paintings have now been brought to light.
Another curious incident experienced
by Mrs. Weatherill was the action of the
natives when being instructed in Biblical
history. On hearing the story of the
Ark, the whole tribe took up their tents
and moved sixty miles away to the top
of the highest mountain in the vicinity,
and it was only after much persuasion
that they were convinced they could de
scend to the lower land without danger
of being submerged.
Mrs. Weatherill is now visting in Palo
Alto, and this talk Friday evening will
be the only opportunity to hear her re
late her experiences with the Navajos.
Tickets, which are 50 cents apiece, are on
sale at Crandall's, Thoits', and the Se
quoia Bookshop. The proceeds will go
to the fund being established by the
Palo Alto Club, of which Mrs. Theodore
Hoov» r is president, for bringing to
Palo Alto children famous artists from
all parts of the state for lectures and
informal talks.
Weird stories of Navajo life and cus
toms, startling disclosures of the mode
of existence of the wildest of these sav
ages, and anecdotes of the native tribes
to but few white people, will be
features of a talk to be given by Mrs.
John Weatherill in the Palo Alto Wom
en's Clubhouse Friday evening at 8
o'clock.
Mrs. Weatherill, for the past forty
years, has exercised an enormous in
fluence over the Indian tribes that dwell
in the desert country which joins the
three states of Arizona, New Mexico,
and Utah. She was adopted by the
Navajos because of their belief that she
wielded a mysterious power over the
scattered bands of savages. Ever since
then she has been official adviser to that
wild and desperate group of savages, and
has settled disputes, not only between
them and the government, but between
members of the tribe.
Mrs. Weatherill's talk will deal chiefly
with the most startling and curious in
cidents which it has been her fortune tb
observe. An example of the uniqueness
of her experiences among the Indians is
the reproductions which she has of the
long-looked-for, but elusive, sand-paint
ings. These masterpieces of Indian art
are regarded by the savages as being
valuable for medical purposes, casting a
charm over the evil spirits of sickness
They are traced in the sand in the morn
ing, and by sundown must be destroyed.

No copy of them is ever supposed to
exist.
