## 
### 
Miss Winofred Maitland, principal of
the Wellington Training College, of Wel
lington, New Zealand, has been spending
the past week at Stanford, studying meth
ods of training students in the University
for educational work.
Miss Maitland, who arrived on the
'..'Tahiti," is now on professional leave,
and made this University her first stop
on a trip which will take her to all the
principal universities and colleges of this
country and Europe.
While here, Miss Maitland has studied
the methods of the Department of Educa
tion, and has also been especially inter
ested in the mental tests being conducted
by Professor Lewis F. Terman, of the
Psychology department. This work was
the chief reason for her visit to this
University. She has also made investiga
tions in regard to individual and psycho
logical clinics, and other practical work
in connection with the subject.
From Stanford Miss Maitland will
visit the University of California, and

then go on to Los Angeles, Denver, Chi
cago, New York, Boston, Washington,
and Toronto, visiting the various institu
tions in each city. She will return to
New Zealand by way of Europe and the
Suez Canal, thus completely circling the
globe on her trip.
Miss Maitland described the Welling
ton Training College as a school of some
450 children, where students come to do
their training work. At the same time
they also take work in the University of
New Zealand. Speaking of the educa
tional system in New Zealand, she ex
plained that it is centralized under the
Minister of Education, who is a member
of Parliament. Under him is the De
partment of Education and nine district
boards. All expenses for education are
appropriated by Parliament.
When asked her impressions of Stan
ford, Miss Maitland said: "Your Uni
versity is very beautiful. You are indeed
fortunate and privileged to attend such
an institution."
