# FRESHMEN TO MEET SAN MATEO SOCCER TEAM AGAIN TODAY
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's freshman soc
cer team will tackle the eleven of the
San Mateo High School in a practice
game today at 4:15 on the varsity soccer
field. The babes secured a victory from
the upper peninsula boys in a game at
San Mateo two weeks ago.
Although Maloney has been too busy
with his boxers, wrestlers, fencers, and
varsity soccer men to give much time
to the tirst-year soccerites the last week,
he is now spending a part of every after
noon reorganizing and instructing his
men. Shone, one of the babes' chief as
sets, was changed from center halfback
to center forward. He has now picked
up the duties of his new position and
ought to figure in the scoring. Miron
has been changed from inside left to in
side right, where Maloney believes he
will be more effective. The line-up for
tomorrow's game follows:
Goal, Newlin; left fullback, Campbell;
right fullback, Pollard; center half,
Franklin; right half, Pond; left half,
Whitehead ;outside right, Shilock; out
side left, Espy; inside right, Miron; in
side left, Ashley; center forward, Shone.
