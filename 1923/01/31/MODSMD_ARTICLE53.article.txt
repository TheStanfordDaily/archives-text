# MINOR SPORTS RECORDS SHOW CARD VICTORIES
## 
### 
According to the report recently issued
by Coach Harry Maloney Stanford's suc
cess in minor spurts from 1912 to 1922
has been phenomenal. The statement also
includes Rugby, dating back to 1906 when
it was regarded as a major sport. In the
fourteen games with California, Stan
ford won 8 and tied 3. Rugby was aban
doned in 1914 and although resumed as
a minor sport in 1919, after the winter
quarter a year ago, it was again dropped
from the list of Stanford sports. As a
/result of the decision of the Athletic
Board, it is once more to be revived.
Will it again reach its former promi
nence ?
In the records of the swimming meets
between Stanford and California, from
1916 to 1922, Stanford has been the vic
tor in four out of seven, winning in 1917
and also, in the past three years straight.
The recent annual scores were far from
close. In 1920, the Card varsity stood
on the heavy end of a 56 to 22 score;
again, in 1921, they won 51 to 17; while
in 1922, the score stood 27 to oin favor
of Stanford.
In Soccer from 1912 to 1922, Stanford
won 15 games and tied 5 out of the total
of 25 games played with the Blue and
Gold aggregations. During the war
period, in 1919 and 1920, the absence of
Stanford's coach in the service caused
the Cards to win only one out of the four
games played. However, since 1921,
Stanford has won or tied all of the Cali
fornia contests.
Since 1916, Stanford has shown up well
in boxing, having won 3 and tied 2 bouts.
California has won but 2. The wrestling
bouts have not proved so successful. The
Stanford aggregation tied the score in
1918 and won in 1919. California has
accounted for the rest. Stanford has
proved it had a corner on fencing, hav
ing won in the 1921 and 1922 bouts from
California's best. In the water polo
meets, the scores have stood in favor of
Brandsten's men for the past three years.
Coach Maloney, director of minor sports,
is to be credited with much of the success
of the Stanford teams in the past and his
able management will no doubt account
for continued Cardinal victories in the
future.

1916 to 1922, Stanford has been the vic
tor in four out of seven, winning in 1917
and also, in the past three years straight.
The recent annual scores were far from
close. In 1920, the Card varsity stood
on the heavy end of a 56 to 22 score;
again, in 1921, they won 51 to 17; while
in 1922, the score stood 27 to oin favor
of Stanford.
In Soccer from 1912 to 1922, Stanford
won 15 games and tied 5 out of the total
of 25 games played with the Blue and
Gold aggregations. During the war
period, in 1919 and 1920, the absence of
Stanford's coach in the service caused
the Cards to win only one out of the four
games played. However, since 1921,
Stanford has won or tied all of the Cali
fornia contests.
Since 1916, Stanford has shown up well
in boxing, having won 3 and tied 2 bouts.
California has won but 2. The wrestling
bouts have not proved so successful. The
Stanford aggregation tied the score in
1918 and won in 1919. California has
accounted for the rest. Stanford has
proved it had a corner on fencing, hav
ing won in the 1921 and 1922 bouts from
California's best. In the water polo
meets, the scores have stood in favor of
Brandsten's men for the past three years.
Coach Maloney, director of minor sports,
is to be credited with much of the success
of the Stanford teams in the past and his
able management will no doubt account
for continued Cardinal victories in the
future.
According to the report recently issued
by Coach Harry Maloney Stanford's suc
cess in minor spurts from 1912 to 1922
has been phenomenal. The statement also
includes Rugby, dating back to 1906 when
it was regarded as a major sport. In the
fourteen games with California, Stan
ford won 8 and tied 3. Rugby was aban
doned in 1914 and although resumed as
a minor sport in 1919, after the winter
quarter a year ago, it was again dropped
from the list of Stanford sports. As a
/result of the decision of the Athletic
Board, it is once more to be revived.
Will it again reach its former promi
nence ?
