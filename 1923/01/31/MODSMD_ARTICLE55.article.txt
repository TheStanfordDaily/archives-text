### A. Thorpe, '26 
Ceremonial dolls which are included
in the exhibition of work done by the
Navajo and Hopi Indians, now on dis
play at the Stanford Art Gallery, show
the costumes and odd color schemes
actually used by the Indians in their
ceremonial dances. The jewelry shown
in the exhibition is also indicative of
the history of these peoples.
"The costumes made by the Indians
for the ceremonial dolls show the In
dian's natural good taste for color
harmony," said Mr. Lemos, Director
of the Art Gallery. The jewelry in
cluded in the exhibition is all the work
of the Navajo Indians except one
bracelet which was made by the Hopi
Indians.
Some of the necklaces have designs
that are Egyptian in character. Jew
elry craftsmanship of the Indians is
perfect in design and as such is ex
pressive of the pleasure they take in
their work. A great variety of buttons
is also included in the collection. It
has been said that money to an In
dian represents only that which can
be hammered into jewelry or some
thing that can be exchanged for jew
elry.
Arrows are used in the designs on
the wristlet and shows the ideal of
fitness that is remarkable. The wrist
let is peculiarly an Indian ornament
because it was first made to protect
the wrist when shooting arrows.
The Indian Exhibit will be enlarged
at the beginning of February, when
the adjacent room will also be filled
with Indian material. The Gallery is
open to the public daily wthout
charge, from 10 to 5 o'clock.
