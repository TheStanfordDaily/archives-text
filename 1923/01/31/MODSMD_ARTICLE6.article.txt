## 
### (By United Press 
LONDON, "Jan. 31. â€”Ismet Pasha,
head of Turkey's delegation to Lau
sanne, today took advantage of a new
rift in the entente to ignore Great
Britain's ultimatum and ask for more
time to consider the treaty submitted
by the allies.
A surprise move by France by which
she notified the Angora government
4hat the dead line set by Marquis Cur
on for Turkey's reply need not be con
sidered final as far as the French
were concerned, gave the Ottoman
delegate a loophole whereby he avoid
ed a flat answer to the European ne
gotiators.
