# RAM'S HEAD SHOW REHEARSALS GIVE NOVICE NEW IDEAS
## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Perhaps nothing is more astonishing to t
the uninitiated than the sights that greet j
the eye at rehearsals for a new play.
Those who have not seen "behind the!
scenes" have, some way, an idea that j
there should be no "hitch or trouble of;
any kind; that the actors should take j
their places with absolute precision and
perfection, and that nothing should pos
sibly occur to mar the swing of pro
duction.
And how different is the real thing!
Afternoon Rehearsal Seems Strange
A glimpse of the afternoon rehearsal
of the cast for Ram's Head show will
serve to explain what is meant.
The afternoon is given over to the j
"principals" of "leads;" the chorus takes
the stage at night. The Assembly hall
is bare, half-warmed, and dim except
for the flare of lights on the stage.
There are grouped the actors, seemingly
paying little attention to the director,
seated in his chair in the tin footlight j
trough. He is reading from the manu-|
script, and telling the villain when to |
come in and where to go. The villain, |
apparently, is uninterested in what he is,
saying, but twiddles his thumbs and 1
stares vacantly into space.
Practice Follows Instructions
Instructions are given to other actors;
who appear from the stage drapes when I
they are called, and immediately disap
pear when directions are well under way.
This goes on for some time, and then the
director calls out, "Now we will try
that."
The uninitiated smile. Now watch
them become iuddled, and forget what
they have been told!
The scene is'gone through.; there is
not a mistake made! The director
smiles, says that is nice, and the actors
wander off to stare again at the ceiling
Imagination Necessary
The actors themselves require no lit
tle foresight and imagination to take
them from present surroundings and cast
the glamour over them that the play
demands.
Over there, watching the stage man
ager busily fitting up the "set" for the
first act, is "Elsinore," we are told by
the director. We look, and behold an
unshaven youth in his shirtsleeves drag
ging at a cigarette! Yea, verily, the
imagination must be strong for the art
of casting the actors in a play! "Elsi
nore," indeed! And we feel'more un
initiated than ever.
These sights and scenes soon lose their
strangeness; there seems to be a method
in it all, and you know that the carpenter
will have done his hammering long be
fore the show is ready; that the actors
will have ceased to look at the ceiling
on the "Big Night"; that the "Stocktons"
and "Elsinores" will be shaved and prop
erly attired; yet, after all, you know that
the stage is somehow different from any
thing else you have run across, and that
the first rehearsal you ever attended was
what impressed it on you more than the
actual production of the play.

nore," indeed! And we feel'more un
initiated than ever.
These sights and scenes soon lose their
strangeness; there seems to be a method
in it all, and you know that the carpenter
will have done his hammering long be
fore the show is ready; that the actors
will have ceased to look at the ceiling
on the "Big Night"; that the "Stocktons"
and "Elsinores" will be shaved and prop
erly attired; yet, after all, you know that
the stage is somehow different from any
thing else you have run across, and that
the first rehearsal you ever attended was
what impressed it on you more than the
actual production of the play.
Perhaps nothing is more astonishing to t
the uninitiated than the sights that greet j
the eye at rehearsals for a new play.
Those who have not seen "behind the!
scenes" have, some way, an idea that j
there should be no "hitch or trouble of;
any kind; that the actors should take j
their places with absolute precision and
perfection, and that nothing should pos
sibly occur to mar the swing of pro
duction.
And how different is the real thing!
Afternoon Rehearsal Seems Strange
A glimpse of the afternoon rehearsal
of the cast for Ram's Head show will
serve to explain what is meant.
The afternoon is given over to the j
"principals" of "leads;" the chorus takes
the stage at night. The Assembly hall
is bare, half-warmed, and dim except
for the flare of lights on the stage.
There are grouped the actors, seemingly
paying little attention to the director,
seated in his chair in the tin footlight j
trough. He is reading from the manu-|
script, and telling the villain when to |
come in and where to go. The villain, |
apparently, is uninterested in what he is,
saying, but twiddles his thumbs and 1
stares vacantly into space.
Practice Follows Instructions
Instructions are given to other actors;
who appear from the stage drapes when I
they are called, and immediately disap
pear when directions are well under way.
This goes on for some time, and then the
director calls out, "Now we will try
that."
The uninitiated smile. Now watch
them become iuddled, and forget what
they have been told!
The scene is'gone through.; there is
not a mistake made! The director
smiles, says that is nice, and the actors
wander off to stare again at the ceiling
Imagination Necessary
The actors themselves require no lit
tle foresight and imagination to take
them from present surroundings and cast
the glamour over them that the play
demands.
Over there, watching the stage man
ager busily fitting up the "set" for the
first act, is "Elsinore," we are told by
the director. We look, and behold an
unshaven youth in his shirtsleeves drag
ging at a cigarette! Yea, verily, the
imagination must be strong for the art
of casting the actors in a play! "Elsi
nore," indeed! And we feel'more un
initiated than ever.
