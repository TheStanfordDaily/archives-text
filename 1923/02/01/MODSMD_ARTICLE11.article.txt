# BASEBALL VARSITY CLASHES WITH FAST CLUBMEN SATURDAY
## 
### 
After a forced vacation due to un
favorable weather conditions, Coach
Harry Wolter's baseball varsity again
took to the field yesterday afternoon.j
The men went through a light batting
and fielding practice in preparation
for the game Saturday afternoon with
the Jefferson Club nine of San Fran- i
cisco on the varsity diamond.
The clubmen have the reputation of
being one of the fastest semi-pro
nines in the city and should press the
varsity hard. The club has no connec
tion with the Bank of California, al
though several of its players are em-:
ployed there.
Wolter has not had much chance as
yet to fully size up the array of talent
that has been reporting, but he
watched every player closely yester-1
day and will try to choose today a
nine to open against the Jeffersonians.;
Fred Solomon, Jim Teague, and
George Follansbee, who twirled for
the freshmen last year, are possibili
ties for the varsity pitching staff, along
with Jim Clark and A1 Lowenstein
who helped out last season. Wolter be
lieves that he will start Solomon in
the box for the varsity Saturday.
Jim Lawson, A1 Huneke, and Frank
Fuller will probably be this year's
catchers.
Captain Peavy, Woodward, Hecken
dorf, Roberts, Mulchay, and Patterson
are the leading candidates for posi- j
tions in the infield, while Bill Mc- j
Candless and '.Dick Lawson have |
shown up well in the outer gardens.
