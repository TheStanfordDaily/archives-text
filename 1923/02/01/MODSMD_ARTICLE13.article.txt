## Delta Chi, Delta Tau Delta Remain Undefeated, Taknig Fourth Straight Contest 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Chi Psi succeeded in defeating
Alpha Sigma Phi 9-8 last night in a
game which was undecided until Mc-
Candless made a point from a free
throw just before the whistle blew.
Delta Chi won their fourth straight
contest by defeating Zeta Psi 9-2, Phi
Kappa Sigma won from Kappa Alpha
by the decisive score of 28-8, and Delta
Tau Delta retained their lead in
League 5 by winning from their close
rivals, Sigma Nu, 16-9, in the other
games played in the intramural bas
ketball tournament yesterday.
Chi Psi Wins Close Game
Chi Psi and Alpha Sigma Phi en
gaged in the closest game of the day,
although it was not the most interest
ing. At no time was either team in the
lead by more than two points, and
the last half neither side led by more
than one point except for short inter
vals. The Chi Psi players showed a
more masterful brand of play than the
Alpha Sigma Phi team. Their han
dling of the ball was clever and their
passing sure most of the time. The
teamwork was noticeably better than
that of their opponents, but they were
no better at basket shooting.
McCandless by his jumping at cen
ter and his good foul shooting was a
large factor in the Chi Psi victory.
Wilcox at forward was the only one
to score from the field twice, and his
score should have been doubled had
he had a better eye on the basket.
Ferguson was the whole team for
Alpha Sigma Phi. His fast floor work,
his clever dribbling, and his passing
easily distinguished him from his
teammates, none of wjiom showed any
basketball. With better guarding by
Chi Psi the Alpha Sigma Phi players
would not have been able to run up
the score as high as they did; but
Cavanaugh and Cook played too far
from the backboard and played for
the man instead of the ball, thus let
ting the Alpha Sigma Phi forwards
slip past them several times.
Tritle and Suffern Star
Delta Chi was held scoreless during
the whole of the first half of their
game with Zeta Psi, and their oppon
ents were able to score but one field
goal, which was the only marker they
