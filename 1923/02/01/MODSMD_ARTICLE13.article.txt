# ALPHA SIGMA PHI DEFEATED BY CHI PSI BASKET TEAM
## Delta Chi, Delta Tau Delta Remain Undefeated, Taknig Fourth Straight Contest 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Chi Psi succeeded in defeating
Alpha Sigma Phi 9-8 last night in a
game which was undecided until Mc-
Candless made a point from a free
throw just before the whistle blew.
Delta Chi won their fourth straight
contest by defeating Zeta Psi 9-2, Phi
Kappa Sigma won from Kappa Alpha
by the decisive score of 28-8, and Delta
Tau Delta retained their lead in
League 5 by winning from their close
rivals, Sigma Nu, 16-9, in the other
games played in the intramural bas
ketball tournament yesterday.
Chi Psi Wins Close Game
Chi Psi and Alpha Sigma Phi en
gaged in the closest game of the day,
although it was not the most interest
ing. At no time was either team in the
lead by more than two points, and
the last half neither side led by more
than one point except for short inter
vals. The Chi Psi players showed a
more masterful brand of play than the
Alpha Sigma Phi team. Their han
dling of the ball was clever and their
passing sure most of the time. The
teamwork was noticeably better than
that of their opponents, but they were
no better at basket shooting.
McCandless by his jumping at cen
ter and his good foul shooting was a
large factor in the Chi Psi victory.
Wilcox at forward was the only one
to score from the field twice, and his
score should have been doubled had
he had a better eye on the basket.
Ferguson was the whole team for
Alpha Sigma Phi. His fast floor work,
his clever dribbling, and his passing
easily distinguished him from his
teammates, none of wjiom showed any
basketball. With better guarding by
Chi Psi the Alpha Sigma Phi players
would not have been able to run up
the score as high as they did; but
Cavanaugh and Cook played too far
from the backboard and played for
the man instead of the ball, thus let
ting the Alpha Sigma Phi forwards
slip past them several times.
Tritle and Suffern Star
Delta Chi was held scoreless during
the whole of the first half of their
game with Zeta Psi, and their oppon
ents were able to score but one field
goal, which was the only marker they
made during the entire thirty minutes
of play. Cravens kept the Delta Chi
forwards at bay half of the game and
Hood did equally well for his team
with one exception, when Solomon
broke through.
After half time the Delta Chi men
got limbered yp and Coplen caged two
shots from the floor while Tritle and
Suffern each tallied once. Both Tritle
game and together worked the ball
bame and together worked the ball
down the floor to the basket in a clever
fashion. Solomon again was the bright
spot in the Zeta Psi game, dribbling
his way around the floor with ability.
Mixon Shoots Eight Fouls
By defeating Sigma Nu last night,
Delta Tau Delta won their fourth
game of the tournament and placed a
larger gap between their opponents
and themselves, in the rivalry for lead- j
ership in League 5. Although the Delta ;
Tau Delta forwards were better than j
the Sigma Nu players by only one field
goal, they succeeded in winning 16-9 .
because of Mixon's good foul shooting. I
De Back was the most accurate in '
shooting from the floor, having two i
goals to his credit. Aydelotte dupli- 1
cated his feat for Sigma Nu, but
Mixon sunk eight fouls to three for j
Bragg and kept his team in the lead
throughout.
The game was hotly contested, and
both teams showed some of the best i
play displayed to date. Aydelotte and
Bragg, who lost their stride last week, j
seemed in good form last night and
were the material factors in giving the
Delta Tau Delta players such stiff com
petition. De Back kept the Sigma Nu
guards busy and several times he
broke through their defense for close
shots at the basket. His fast floor work
forced the Sigma Nu players to foul
considerably and Thede was forced out
of the game in the second half.
Phi Kaps Overwhelm K. A.'s
Phi Kappa Sigma met little opposi
tion in the Kappa Alpha outfit and eas
ily won by a score of 28-8. Thomas
had a scoring bee all of his own and,
besides five points made in the first
half, made six field goals during the
final period. His fast spurts at the
basket kept the Kappa Alpha guards
and forwards so busy that they had no
time to get organized. Beeson, who has
been able to break through the defense
6f most other teams was stopped last
night and registered only one basket.
Mowers was more lucky and tossed
three shots through the hoop.
Today's games are: Sigma Chi and
Los Arcos, 5 p. m.; Encina Hall, fifth
floor, and Theta Chi, 5:40 p. m.; Se
quoia Hall, second floor, and El Toro,
7:15 p. m.; Delta Kappa Epsilon and

the whole of the first half of their
game with Zeta Psi, and their oppon
ents were able to score but one field
goal, which was the only marker they
made during the entire thirty minutes
of play. Cravens kept the Delta Chi
forwards at bay half of the game and
Hood did equally well for his team
with one exception, when Solomon
broke through.
After half time the Delta Chi men
got limbered yp and Coplen caged two
shots from the floor while Tritle and
Suffern each tallied once. Both Tritle
game and together worked the ball
bame and together worked the ball
down the floor to the basket in a clever
fashion. Solomon again was the bright
spot in the Zeta Psi game, dribbling
his way around the floor with ability.
Mixon Shoots Eight Fouls
By defeating Sigma Nu last night,
Delta Tau Delta won their fourth
game of the tournament and placed a
larger gap between their opponents
and themselves, in the rivalry for lead- j
ership in League 5. Although the Delta ;
Tau Delta forwards were better than j
the Sigma Nu players by only one field
goal, they succeeded in winning 16-9 .
because of Mixon's good foul shooting. I
De Back was the most accurate in '
shooting from the floor, having two i
goals to his credit. Aydelotte dupli- 1
cated his feat for Sigma Nu, but
Mixon sunk eight fouls to three for j
Bragg and kept his team in the lead
throughout.
The game was hotly contested, and
both teams showed some of the best i
play displayed to date. Aydelotte and
Bragg, who lost their stride last week, j
seemed in good form last night and
were the material factors in giving the
Delta Tau Delta players such stiff com
petition. De Back kept the Sigma Nu
guards busy and several times he
broke through their defense for close
shots at the basket. His fast floor work
forced the Sigma Nu players to foul
considerably and Thede was forced out
of the game in the second half.
Phi Kaps Overwhelm K. A.'s
Phi Kappa Sigma met little opposi
tion in the Kappa Alpha outfit and eas
ily won by a score of 28-8. Thomas
had a scoring bee all of his own and,
besides five points made in the first
half, made six field goals during the
final period. His fast spurts at the
basket kept the Kappa Alpha guards
and forwards so busy that they had no
time to get organized. Beeson, who has
been able to break through the defense
6f most other teams was stopped last
night and registered only one basket.
Mowers was more lucky and tossed
three shots through the hoop.
Today's games are: Sigma Chi and
Los Arcos, 5 p. m.; Encina Hall, fifth
floor, and Theta Chi, 5:40 p. m.; Se
quoia Hall, second floor, and El Toro,

Chi Psi succeeded in defeating
Alpha Sigma Phi 9-8 last night in a
game which was undecided until Mc-
Candless made a point from a free
throw just before the whistle blew.
Delta Chi won their fourth straight
contest by defeating Zeta Psi 9-2, Phi
Kappa Sigma won from Kappa Alpha
by the decisive score of 28-8, and Delta
Tau Delta retained their lead in
League 5 by winning from their close
rivals, Sigma Nu, 16-9, in the other
games played in the intramural bas
ketball tournament yesterday.
Chi Psi Wins Close Game
Chi Psi and Alpha Sigma Phi en
gaged in the closest game of the day,
although it was not the most interest
ing. At no time was either team in the
lead by more than two points, and
the last half neither side led by more
than one point except for short inter
vals. The Chi Psi players showed a
more masterful brand of play than the
Alpha Sigma Phi team. Their han
dling of the ball was clever and their
passing sure most of the time. The
teamwork was noticeably better than
that of their opponents, but they were
no better at basket shooting.
McCandless by his jumping at cen
ter and his good foul shooting was a
large factor in the Chi Psi victory.
Wilcox at forward was the only one
to score from the field twice, and his
score should have been doubled had
he had a better eye on the basket.
Ferguson was the whole team for
Alpha Sigma Phi. His fast floor work,
his clever dribbling, and his passing
easily distinguished him from his
teammates, none of wjiom showed any
basketball. With better guarding by
Chi Psi the Alpha Sigma Phi players
would not have been able to run up
the score as high as they did; but
Cavanaugh and Cook played too far
from the backboard and played for
the man instead of the ball, thus let
ting the Alpha Sigma Phi forwards
slip past them several times.

ily won by a score of 28-8. Thomas
had a scoring bee all of his own and,
besides five points made in the first
half, made six field goals during the
final period. His fast spurts at the
basket kept the Kappa Alpha guards
and forwards so busy that they had no
time to get organized. Beeson, who has
been able to break through the defense
6f most other teams was stopped last
night and registered only one basket.
Mowers was more lucky and tossed
three shots through the hoop.

Chi Psi succeeded in defeating
Alpha Sigma Phi 9-8 last night in a
game which was undecided until Mc-
Candless made a point from a free
throw just before the whistle blew.
Delta Chi won their fourth straight
contest by defeating Zeta Psi 9-2, Phi
Kappa Sigma won from Kappa Alpha
by the decisive score of 28-8, and Delta
Tau Delta retained their lead in
League 5 by winning from their close
rivals, Sigma Nu, 16-9, in the other
games played in the intramural bas
ketball tournament yesterday.
Chi Psi Wins Close Game
Chi Psi and Alpha Sigma Phi en
gaged in the closest game of the day,
although it was not the most interest
ing. At no time was either team in the
lead by more than two points, and
the last half neither side led by more
than one point except for short inter
vals. The Chi Psi players showed a
more masterful brand of play than the
Alpha Sigma Phi team. Their han
dling of the ball was clever and their
passing sure most of the time. The
teamwork was noticeably better than
that of their opponents, but they were
no better at basket shooting.
McCandless by his jumping at cen
ter and his good foul shooting was a
large factor in the Chi Psi victory.
Wilcox at forward was the only one
to score from the field twice, and his
score should have been doubled had
he had a better eye on the basket.
Ferguson was the whole team for
Alpha Sigma Phi. His fast floor work,
his clever dribbling, and his passing
easily distinguished him from his
teammates, none of wjiom showed any
basketball. With better guarding by
Chi Psi the Alpha Sigma Phi players
would not have been able to run up
the score as high as they did; but
Cavanaugh and Cook played too far
from the backboard and played for
the man instead of the ball, thus let
ting the Alpha Sigma Phi forwards
slip past them several times.
Tritle and Suffern Star
Delta Chi was held scoreless during
the whole of the first half of their
game with Zeta Psi, and their oppon
ents were able to score but one field
goal, which was the only marker they
made during the entire thirty minutes
of play. Cravens kept the Delta Chi
forwards at bay half of the game and
Hood did equally well for his team
with one exception, when Solomon
broke through.
After half time the Delta Chi men
got limbered yp and Coplen caged two
shots from the floor while Tritle and
Suffern each tallied once. Both Tritle
game and together worked the ball
bame and together worked the ball
down the floor to the basket in a clever
fashion. Solomon again was the bright
spot in the Zeta Psi game, dribbling
his way around the floor with ability.
Mixon Shoots Eight Fouls
By defeating Sigma Nu last night,
Delta Tau Delta won their fourth
game of the tournament and placed a
larger gap between their opponents
and themselves, in the rivalry for lead- j
ership in League 5. Although the Delta ;
Tau Delta forwards were better than j
the Sigma Nu players by only one field
goal, they succeeded in winning 16-9 .
because of Mixon's good foul shooting. I
De Back was the most accurate in '
shooting from the floor, having two i
goals to his credit. Aydelotte dupli- 1
cated his feat for Sigma Nu, but
Mixon sunk eight fouls to three for j
Bragg and kept his team in the lead
throughout.
The game was hotly contested, and
both teams showed some of the best i
play displayed to date. Aydelotte and
Bragg, who lost their stride last week, j
seemed in good form last night and
were the material factors in giving the
Delta Tau Delta players such stiff com
petition. De Back kept the Sigma Nu
guards busy and several times he
broke through their defense for close
shots at the basket. His fast floor work
forced the Sigma Nu players to foul
considerably and Thede was forced out
of the game in the second half.
