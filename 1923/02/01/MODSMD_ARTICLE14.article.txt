# FRESHMEN HELD TO SCORELESS TIE BY SAN MATEO ELEVEN
## 
### B.P. Beckwith, '26 
The freshman soccer team was held
to a scoreless tie by the San Mateo
High aggregation on the campus field
late yesterday afternoon. San Mateo
showed a decided improvement since
their last game with the freshmen,
when they were outplayed 3-0. Both
teams were evenly matched. A muddy
field was the cause of many slips and
falls and much poor passing.
The passing and dribbling was very
ragged, and although they showed
good teamwork at times, they were
unable to work in close enough for
goal shots more than on two or three
occasions during the game. The ball
remained in the middle of the field
most of the time. Stanford came close
to scoring in the second half when
Schoen, center forward, kicked the
leather less than a foot over the San
Mateo goal. However the Stanford goal
posts were touched twice and the
game was in danger when San Mateo
was awarded a penalty kick which,
nevertheless, was not scored.
The freshmen will meet the Unione
Sportiva Italiana next Saturday after
noon in San Francisco and should
show some decided improvement after
this week's practice.

Stanford — San Mateo—
