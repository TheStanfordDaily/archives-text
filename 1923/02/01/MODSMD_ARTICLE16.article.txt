## 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Stanford's freshman basketball team I
defeated the Berkeley High School j
five 22-19 last night in the last two
minutes of a fast and hard-fought I
game. It was the first basketball vic
tory a Cardinal freshman team has
won from the trans-bay school in four
years.
Nevers' Substitute Makes Good
Eddie Frank, the miniature forward
who stepped into the game in Nevers'
place when the big fellow was ruled
out on four personal fouls, ran wild
in the last few minutes, sinking two
pretty field goals and helping to put
the game on ice..
Both teams were slow in opening up

Dougery, who made eleven of the
preps' nineteen points, started finding

hoop brought back memories of Robie
and the Piedmont game. Dougery tal
lied three field goals, all from different
angles, while the babes could make
but a single point on a free throw by
Ernie Nevers. Nevers was having his
share of hard luck. His shots from the
field looked good on almost every at
tempt, but the leather sphere wouldn't
drop through the hoop. The quarter j
ended with the yearlings trailing on ,
tli;} wrong end of a 6-1 score.
Freshmen Get Under Way
Morrison replaced Carter at center j
with the beginning of the second j
quarter and the babes began to get!
under way. Dougery dropped one in to
start things off right but Nevers
brought the score to 8-3 by making a
pair of free throws good. Morrison
tipped one in from under the basket,
8-5. Nevers' hard luck deserted him
and he found the basket twice from
near the center of the floor. That put
the yearlings in the lead by one point.
Frazier dropped one in and the half ■
ended with the Cardinal babes leading I
11-8.
The going was rather slow in the ■
third quarter. Nevers made three
points on free throws and Dougery
accounted for as many with a field
