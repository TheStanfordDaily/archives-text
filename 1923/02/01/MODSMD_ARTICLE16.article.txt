# YEARLING QUINTET DEFEATS BERKELEY HIGH SCHOOL FIVE
## 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Stanford's freshman basketball team I
defeated the Berkeley High School j
five 22-19 last night in the last two
minutes of a fast and hard-fought I
game. It was the first basketball vic
tory a Cardinal freshman team has
won from the trans-bay school in four
years.
Nevers' Substitute Makes Good
Eddie Frank, the miniature forward
who stepped into the game in Nevers'
place when the big fellow was ruled
out on four personal fouls, ran wild
in the last few minutes, sinking two
pretty field goals and helping to put
the game on ice..
Both teams were slow in opening up
at the beginning of the game. The bat
tle was three minutes old before J.
Dougery, who made eleven of the
preps' nineteen points, started finding
the basket. His ability to locate the
hoop brought back memories of Robie
and the Piedmont game. Dougery tal
lied three field goals, all from different
angles, while the babes could make
but a single point on a free throw by
Ernie Nevers. Nevers was having his
share of hard luck. His shots from the
field looked good on almost every at
tempt, but the leather sphere wouldn't
drop through the hoop. The quarter j
ended with the yearlings trailing on ,
tli;} wrong end of a 6-1 score.
Freshmen Get Under Way
Morrison replaced Carter at center j
with the beginning of the second j
quarter and the babes began to get!
under way. Dougery dropped one in to
start things off right but Nevers
brought the score to 8-3 by making a
pair of free throws good. Morrison
tipped one in from under the basket,
8-5. Nevers' hard luck deserted him
and he found the basket twice from
near the center of the floor. That put
the yearlings in the lead by one point.
Frazier dropped one in and the half ■
ended with the Cardinal babes leading I
11-8.
The going was rather slow in the ■
third quarter. Nevers made three
points on free throws and Dougery
accounted for as many with a field
goal and a free one. At the end of
; the third quarter, the babes were lead
ing 14-11. Dougery had accounted for
every point the preps had accumu
i lated.
Lead See-Saws
Both teams took on new life at the
opening of the final quarter. Nevers
went out on four personals and Mor
rison followed him a minute later for
a similar reason. Frank and Carter
went in. Lindquist brought the high
school total to thirteen with two free
throws. The babes led by one point,,
but Frank found the hoop a minute
later and the lead was increased to
three points. Baskets by Lindquist and
Frank in the next two minutes still
gave the yearlings the best of an 18-15
score. Then the preps ran wild for
several minutes, Lein and R. Dougery j
putting them in the lead with two,
field baskets.
With less than two minutes to play,
the Berkeley lads were leading, 19-18.
Frazier got loose and sunk a pretty
one and the babes were again clinging
to a one-point lead. Just to make j
things safe, as the timer reached for
his gun, Captain Mitchell got the ball
on side-court and the game ended as |
he arched it through the hoop.
Dougery Stars for Berkeley
For Berkeley, J. Dougery was easily
the outstanding player. He made
eleven of his team's nineteen points, I
and played a good floor game. As
usual, Nevers was the life of the fresh- j
man team while lie was in. Harris, the j
big fellow who went in at standing
guard in the last few minutes, looks
like the goods and should develop into
a valuable defensive man.

brought the score to 8-3 by making a
pair of free throws good. Morrison
tipped one in from under the basket,
8-5. Nevers' hard luck deserted him
and he found the basket twice from
near the center of the floor. That put
the yearlings in the lead by one point.
Frazier dropped one in and the half ■
ended with the Cardinal babes leading I
11-8.
The going was rather slow in the ■
third quarter. Nevers made three
points on free throws and Dougery
accounted for as many with a field
goal and a free one. At the end of
; the third quarter, the babes were lead
ing 14-11. Dougery had accounted for
every point the preps had accumu
i lated.
Lead See-Saws
Both teams took on new life at the
opening of the final quarter. Nevers
went out on four personals and Mor
rison followed him a minute later for
a similar reason. Frank and Carter
went in. Lindquist brought the high
school total to thirteen with two free
throws. The babes led by one point,,
but Frank found the hoop a minute
later and the lead was increased to
three points. Baskets by Lindquist and
Frank in the next two minutes still
gave the yearlings the best of an 18-15
score. Then the preps ran wild for
several minutes, Lein and R. Dougery j
putting them in the lead with two,
field baskets.
With less than two minutes to play,
the Berkeley lads were leading, 19-18.
Frazier got loose and sunk a pretty
one and the babes were again clinging
to a one-point lead. Just to make j
things safe, as the timer reached for
his gun, Captain Mitchell got the ball
on side-court and the game ended as |
he arched it through the hoop.
Dougery Stars for Berkeley
For Berkeley, J. Dougery was easily
the outstanding player. He made
eleven of his team's nineteen points, I
and played a good floor game. As
usual, Nevers was the life of the fresh- j
man team while lie was in. Harris, the j
big fellow who went in at standing
guard in the last few minutes, looks
like the goods and should develop into
a valuable defensive man.
Stanford's freshman basketball team I
defeated the Berkeley High School j
five 22-19 last night in the last two
minutes of a fast and hard-fought I
game. It was the first basketball vic
tory a Cardinal freshman team has
won from the trans-bay school in four
years.
Nevers' Substitute Makes Good
Eddie Frank, the miniature forward
who stepped into the game in Nevers'
place when the big fellow was ruled
out on four personal fouls, ran wild
in the last few minutes, sinking two
pretty field goals and helping to put
the game on ice..
Both teams were slow in opening up
at the beginning of the game. The bat
tle was three minutes old before J.
Dougery, who made eleven of the
preps' nineteen points, started finding
the basket. His ability to locate the
hoop brought back memories of Robie
and the Piedmont game. Dougery tal
lied three field goals, all from different
angles, while the babes could make
but a single point on a free throw by
Ernie Nevers. Nevers was having his
share of hard luck. His shots from the
field looked good on almost every at
tempt, but the leather sphere wouldn't
drop through the hoop. The quarter j
ended with the yearlings trailing on ,
tli;} wrong end of a 6-1 score.
