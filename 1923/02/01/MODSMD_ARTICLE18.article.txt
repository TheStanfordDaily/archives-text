# Fatty's Reinstatement to Screen Is Nestoria Topic
## 
### 
Whether Will Hays was justified in
the reinstatement of Fatty Arbuckle to
the screen, will be the subject of debate
at a meeting of Nestoria tonight in Room
12 of the Law building. It is thought
by those in charge of the program for
the evening that several new facts will
be brought forth in the discussion.
The question as to the merits of Ar
buckle's reinstatement has a nation-wide
interest. It has recently been said that
no other non-religious subject has ever
been the cause of so many sermons.
