## 
### (By United Press 
CHICAGO, Feb. 1. â€”City, county, and
state officials co-operated today to
stamp out the drug evil which threat
ened to sweep into ranks of Chicago
high school students.
The campaign against the dope was
begun yesterday by the fairy tale of
George Roth, 18, high school student,
who told police and educators he shot
himself because he could not over
come his craving for drugs.
The story, however, resulted in the
most drastic drive against drugs in
the history of the city.
