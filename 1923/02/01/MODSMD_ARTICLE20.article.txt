# TURNER'S TROJAN SQUAD WILL PLAY VARSITY FRIDAY
## Southerners, Credited With One Victory Over Bears, To Give Cardinals Fight 
### 
Coach Les Turner and his Trojan
squad of basketball players will invade
the Stanford campus tomorrow to give
the Cardinal team their first taste of
Coast Conference competition this sea
son.
At the start of the court season,
wails were heard coming up from
the south of the discouraging pros
pects for a team at the University of
Southern California. Coach Turner
predicted little hope for the South
erners this year. With their first game
against the University of Californa
squad last Friday, it began to look as
though he had made the right predic
tions. But it was an altogether differ
ent story that was to be told 011 the
following night.
Trojans Reverse Form
After playing a "dub" game in the
first of the Blue and Gold series, the
Trojans came back on the second
night and exhibited a dazzling form
that was a revelation to everyone, in
cluding the. Bruin ( five. In fact it was
so much of a revelation that the Cali
fornia players are still wondering
what happened.
With the prospects of being able to
represent the southern half of the
Conference against the northern win
ner, the Cardinal five will find stiff
opposition facing them when they line
up against the Trojans tomorrow. Com
parative scores cannot offer much in
estimating the outcome of the game,
since Stanford plays an altogether, dif
ferent style of basketball than any of
the teams that the Trojans have
played.
Cardinal Defense Is Stumbling Block
Stanford's defense is going to prove
a big stumbling block for the south
erners in the coming series. The Card
inal's opponents in the preliminary
schedule were able to score only an
average of three field goals to a game
and the majority of them have been
from long shots.
Gordon Campbell, one of the stellar
lights of "Gloomy Gus" Henderson's
football team, has been doing the most
consistent work for the Trojans on
the basketball court so far this year.
Campbell, playing at running guard,
with Wayahan and Captain Kenneth
White at the forward positions, ac
counted for most of the points in the
recent California series, and this com
bination will have to break up tomor
row night.
