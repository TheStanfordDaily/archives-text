# LIGHTWEIGHT FIVE EASY VICTORS OVER PALO ALTO QUINTET
## 
### David Meikeljohn, '26 
Strong offensive team work in the first
and fourth quarters enabled "Bud"
Young's 130-pound basketball team to
swamp the Falo Alto High School's
weight team, 21 to 6, in a rough pre
liminary game in the Pavilion last night.
A total of twenty-five personal fouls
was accounted for by both teams. Stan
ford converted six and Palo Alto four
of the penalties.
Lightweights Pile Up Lead
In the first quarter the lightweights
piled up a 12 to 4 lead without any
noticeable exertion. "Bud" Young was
missing from the line-up, but the team
played fairly well without his aid. "Dick"
Shaw, 130-pound center, shot three field
goals and a free trial in this period.
Blosser, lightweight guard, was responsi
ble for three points as a result of free
throws. Stanford's team work was.
ragged at times, and their passing a bit
faulty.
Young took Hollingsworth's place at
forward in the third stanza, but his pres
ence had no visible effect on the light
weights' team work during the quarter.
Both squads fumbled freely, and missed
many easy shots.
Better Playing in Fourth Quarter
Tn the last part of the fourth quarter,
the lightweights began to look more like
a regular quintet. They kept the ball in
Stanford territory throughout most of
the period, and added eight additional
points to their lead by getting together
in a real offensive combination.
"Dick" Shaw was high point man with
nine. Shaw played an excellent offensive
game, and was the nucleus of the team
in the first half.
Blosser Stars
Blosser was really the star player of
the evening. He broke up the Palo Alto
offensive consistently, and scored four
points via the penalty route.
"Bud" Young played a good offensive
game, starting in the third quarter, and
scoring four of the winning digits.
Schultzberg deserves a great deal of
credit for his aggressiveness in holding
down his standing guard position.
The game with Redwood City High
I School, scheduled for Friday, has been
■ indefinitely postponed, as the 145-pound-
ers have been picked to play the game
preliminary to the Stanford-U. S. C.
conference fracas.
