# GIVING THE YELL-LEADER A JOB
## 
### 
Executive Committee has been asked on several
occasions to take up the matter of appointing- yell
leaders and as a result last night formed a plan to
be submitted to Quadrangle Club and Skull and
Snakes.
The new plan provides for the appointment of the
veil-leader by a committee comprised of an equal
number of men from the two organizations. By this
method, the election of yell-leader will be taken out
of the hands of ixilitics. It will lay the responsibility
for the appointment of an important officer at the
door of a committee who will be unable to show
favoritism. Instead of rushing the polls on a basis
of political affiliation or popularity, the students may
expect to see a committee take action on the matter
and further expect to see such action taken on a
basis of abilities of the several candidates.
Undergraduate enthusiasm must come back and
one of the best means of performing such a task is
through the appointment of a veil-leader who has
an enthusiastic following. The first yell-leader who
gets good student support will be in a position to
turn the trick. I lis position may then be made one
of the most important of student body offices and
will draw the best talent into competition. This first
move along the lines should start the ball rolling in
the right direction.
