# AN AWARDS ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
In order to put student activities on a higher plane
Stanford students have arranged for an Awards
Assembly to be held twice each college year, at which
times letters, medals, and all other major awards
will be given the winners. In this way student
leaders and those most active in student affairs will
be brought in touch with the rest of the undergradu
ate body. At the same time a greater interest in
major activities will be promoted, a matter of no
small concern, because of the fact that the busiest of
undergraduates may then be relieved of some of their
work. It is because the burden of responsibility rests
011 the shoulders of so few that student interest has
lagged recently. It is not the fault of the few, who
must struggle along as best they may, but to the
students who think that "somebody else is always
trying to run things." The sooner every student
takes some part in undergraduate affairs, the sooner
those now overburdened with activity will be able to
step out from under to give others a chance. The
Awards Assembly should give this move the proper
start.
