SIX YEARS AGO, TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW
With both teams putting their strongest line-ups on
the floor, Stanford and the University of Southern Guata
mala's croquet sixes meet on the floor of the new
$600,000,089.76 Croquet Pavilion tonight in the deciding
battle of the four-year series. U. S. G. is anxious to get
revenge on the Card team for the 3.1416-0.984 defeat
handed them last year on the former's coprt.

Tan bark brought from Redwood is now on exhibition
in the Museum. Old-timers say it used to be used on
the track before that sport was abandoned in favor of
the now annual airplane meets. John McGluke, '43,
however, claims he had a friend that died of it once.
♦ * *
Cries of "Throw 'em Out!" were scattered plentifully
through the February issue of the Stanford Hash, the
new magazine which is appearing for the first time.
The Hash is a combination of the bewhiskered "Spec
tator," the "Chaparral," the "Illustrated Review," the
"Daily Palo Alto," the Razz Sheets, Inc., and the Union
menu. It is expected that the "Hash" will give a broader
scope to University expression, and will considerably
help the business manager in securing ads and a com
fortable old age.

Crew will be renewed next year again, for the first
time since 1920, it was decided at a meeting of the
First National Board of Athletic Control yes
terday noon. The finances have been so improved with
the income from the new eating halls and dormitories
that the Board has decided to mortgage their income
for twenty years in advance to build a new crew house
and manufacture some shells.

"He Who Gets Slapped," a new Russian drama by
Andreyev, will be presented for the first time in the
new Stanford theater by the Prompters' Society. This
show was given twenty years ago, according to some
of the faculty members who played in it at that time,
and was such a decided success that a suitable oppor
tunity to present it has been eagerly awaited ever since.
Horace "Tough" McNoodle, business manager, says that
tickets will only be $5.50 and $6.00 this time, in con
formity with the recent "down with prices" movement
that has recently swept the campus again. "He" is not
a comedy, nor yet is it a tragedy, according to its
friends.

Toughs' Day went off with customary formalities yes
terday. The full-dress parade, starting from the Gamma
Kappa Eta house at Longtitude 120, Latitude 45,
marched down the Row carrying banners proclaiming,
"Dear Me! Dear Me! What Can All the Trouble Be!"
and "We're Nice and Tough, But Never Rough—Come
On, Now, Boys, Let's Quit That Stuff!" A special ban
quet for the co-eds and faculty members was held in the
New Union Cafeteria, or "Toughs' Roost," which was
decorated nicely in chinz draperies with humming-bird
motifs hung around the room. Reginald Cliquot, who
was elected Chairman of Toughs' D a y> made the dedica
tion speech, which was followed by hymns and a general
benediction from the manager of the cafeteria.

The third big formal of the week was held in the
Dance Pavilion yesterday evening from 7to S. Only 450
couples were present, the light attendance being due to
the competition furnished by the sudden apparance of
a good movie in Palo Alto, for the first time since Ru
dolph Valentino, Jr., appeared here a month ago in "The
Young Rajah's Grandson." The combination Whitmer-
Grinstead 99-piece orchestra furnished some of the
music.

"He Who Gets Slapped," a new Russian drama by
Andreyev, will be presented for the first time in the
new Stanford theater by the Prompters' Society. This
show was given twenty years ago, according to some
of the faculty members who played in it at that time,
and was such a decided success that a suitable oppor
tunity to present it has been eagerly awaited ever since.
Horace "Tough" McNoodle, business manager, says that
tickets will only be $5.50 and $6.00 this time, in con
formity with the recent "down with prices" movement
that has recently swept the campus again. "He" is not
a comedy, nor yet is it a tragedy, according to its
friends.

Toughs' Day went off with customary formalities yes

marched down the Row carrying banners proclaiming,
"Dear Me! Dear Me! What Can All the Trouble Be!"
and "We're Nice and Tough, But Never Rough—Come
On, Now, Boys, Let's Quit That Stuff!" A special ban
quet for the co-eds and faculty members was held in the
New Union Cafeteria, or "Toughs' Roost," which was
decorated nicely in chinz draperies with humming-bird

benediction from the manager of the cafeteria.

The third big formal of the week was held in the
Dance Pavilion yesterday evening from 7to S. Only 450
couples were present, the light attendance being due to
the competition furnished by the sudden apparance of
a good movie in Palo Alto, for the first time since Ru
dolph Valentino, Jr., appeared here a month ago in "The
Young Rajah's Grandson." The combination Whitmer-
Grinstead 99-piece orchestra furnished some of the
music.

Cries of "Throw 'em Out!" were scattered plentifully

new magazine which is appearing for the first time.
The Hash is a combination of the bewhiskered "Spec

"Daily Palo Alto," the Razz Sheets, Inc., and the Union
menu. It is expected that the "Hash" will give a broader
scope to University expression, and will considerably
