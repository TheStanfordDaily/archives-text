# ILLINOIS QUARANTINE BOOSTS PHONE BUSINESS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOISâ€”Two
fraternity houses at the University of
Illinois are at present quarantined be
cause of infectious disease, and the
quarantine is being felt at the local
telephone exchange about as much as
at the houses themselves. It is a sober
fact that the Bell company has added
four extra operators to handle the
calls, and a less authentic rumor that
the house freshmen are kept busy
pouring ice-water over the steaming
instrument.
