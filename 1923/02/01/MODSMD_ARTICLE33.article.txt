UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTONâ€”
The periodical Hashimura Togo gram
mar is cropping up at the University
of Washington which has on file a let
ter from the Philippine Islands stating
that the writer desires to "articulate"
with the University and inquiring as to
"what step shall I do next?" A Filipino

"he was sickly and his thinking power
was poisoned." He thinks he can
"tuckle the works" this fall.
