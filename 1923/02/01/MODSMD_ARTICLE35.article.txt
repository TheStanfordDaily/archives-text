# HOLYOKE COLLEGE BANS KNICKERS IN CLASS
## 
### 
Dean Florence Purrington of Mount
Holyoke College recently ruled that
"knickers" must not be worn in the
college class rooms. Many of the stu
dents had been wearing the "knickers
throughout the day. The college au
tohrities do not condemn wearing of
knickerbockers by women, but con
sider them inappropriate as classroom
costumes.
