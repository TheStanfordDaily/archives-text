# ENTRANTS FORTENNIS TOURNAMENT TO MEET ON VARSITY COURTS
## 
### 
Everyone who has signed up for the
first round of the University Cham
pionship tennis tournament should re
port to the varsity courts between
1:30 and 2 tomorrow, according to Nel
son Nowell, tennis manager.
Those who have entered the tourna
ment will meet their opponents at this
time and arrange for playing their
matches.
It is intended to run off the first
round of the tournament as promptly
as possible. In order to do this Nowell
says that everyone in the first round
will have to be at the varsity courts
tomorrow between 1:30 and 2:00 p. m.
This plan, of having all of the en
trants report at one time, is expected
to speed up the playing off of the
tournament. Previously there has been
difficulty because the players were
unable to get in touch with their op
ponents to arrange a convenient time
for their match.
Over sixty men have entered the
tournament. It is open to all players in
the University whether they have had
varsity or freshman experience or not.
Some fast tennis is expected before
the touriaament is completed. Dick
Hinckley, captan of the Stanford var
sity, has entered the tournament. He
will have plenty of competition, how
ever. Ted Mertz of last year's varsity
squad and Norm De Bach will prob
ably make a strong bid for first honors.
There are several freshmen who
have been showing a lot of class in
practice lately and they may show up
well in the tournament. Paul Fair
child and Harry Coffin are both ex
pected to give the old-timers a hard
fight. Fairchild took a set from Phil
Neer. '22, last year's varsity captain,
in a practice match the other day.
