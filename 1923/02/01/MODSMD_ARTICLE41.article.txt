# SCENES COMPLETE FOR "ROLLO'S WILD OAT"
## 
### 
Everett Glass, director of "Rollo's
Wild Oat," to be given by the Greek
Theater Players on Friday evening in
the Assembly hall under the auspices
of the Palo Alto Community Players,
arrived on the campus Tuesday to con
clude arrangements for the presentation.
Glass was pleased with the scenes and the
lighting work, which is being completed
for the production by Chrysella Dunker.
"Rollo's Wild Oat" has been playing in
its initial Pacific Coast run in Oakland
and Berkeley. The cast consists largely
of professional players, many of whom
appeared in the "Enter Madame" presen
tation, given by the San Francisco Stage
Guild in the Assembly hall last Decem
ber.
The play is concerned with the efforts
of Rollo's grandfather to prevent Rollo
from making a fool of himself by ap
pearing as "Hamlet" in a production of
Shakespeare's great drama, which Rollo
has undertaken with the use of his own
tnonev. Rollo falls in love with his
leading lady, who, though she is a pro
fessional actress, is also incapable of
carrying her part.
The light farce flows from the comic
situations arising from the queer predica
ments which Rollo unhappily develops for
himself. The comedy, which received en
thusiastic praise in an Oakland paper,
is particularly rich in clever dialogue.
Seats may be purchased at Crandall's
in Palo Alto at $1 and $1.25.
Dues for the ensuing year of the Palo
Alto Community Players are now pay
able. Payment will carry with it a re
duction of 25 cents on tickets to "Rollo's
