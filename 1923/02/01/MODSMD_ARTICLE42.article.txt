## 
### 
When the R. O. T. C. entrain for the
summer camp fliey will be bound for Del
Monte instead of Seattle, according to
word received by Major Collins from
headquarters of the ninth corps area.
For the last several years the camps
have been held at Camp Lewis, but this
ear Gigling Reservation, about five miles
northeast of Del Monte on the sea coast,
which has been in disuse for some time,
will be reconditioned and used for sum
mer training camps. Beside the Stanford
unit, the University of Utah, Colorado
Agricultural College, and Oregon Agri
cultural College, which were at Camp
Lewis, will be represented. There will
be R. O. T. C. units from the Cavalry,
Infantry, Engineers, and Field Artillery
branches of the service, as well as a
National Guard camp, and a Citizens'
Military training camp.
The Cavalry unit, which encamped at
Gigling Reservation last year, had the
use of the Del Monte polo grounds, and
it is hoped that the polo teams at camp
this summer may have the same priv
ilege. Stanford will have an opportunity
to play the Colorado and Utah teams
with which they were not successful in
scheduling games this winter on account
of the too great distances separating the
universities.
Practically the whole Stanford first
team will be at camp, including the two
Barbys, Laub, and Vanderburgh, the cap
tain. Easly will probably be the only
man missing.
