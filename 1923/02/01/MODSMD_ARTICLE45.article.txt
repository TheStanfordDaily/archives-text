# ENCINA NOTICE PROVES COUE STATEMENT TRUE
## 
### 
"Every day in every way, the Encina
notices are getting better and better!"
We should chalk one up for the brilliant
author of this appealing little master
piece: "Will the gent who has the
plate used for serving cookies at the
Encina dance Saturday night, PLEASE
return it It is a matter of life
and death for the loser. Save me from
destruction. THANKS." A glance at
the notices and we realize that Coue was
right.
