# STANFORD PROFESSORS WRITE PHYSICS TEXT
## 
### 
Professors D. L. Webster and E. R.
Drew of the Stanford Physics depart
ment, in co-operation with H. W. Far
well, professor of Physics at Columbia
University, have completed a college text
book on physics, which will be published
this spring by the Century Company of
New York.
The subject matter of tlje text as well
as the method of presentation differs
from the usual plan. More attention is
paid to the discoveries of the last twenty
years on the structure of atoms, the na
ture of electricity, and radian energy. An
effort has been made to collect the prob
lems from practical situations and to dis
uss the principles of physics from a prac
tical standpoint.
