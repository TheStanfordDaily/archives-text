## 
### 
i
Chapparal has almost twice as many
j jokes in the last issue of College Humor
J as any other college* comic in the coun
| try, according to Northcutt Ely, editor
i of the local comic.
A compilation was made of the total
| number of contributions run in College
Humor, which clips from all the college
comics in North America. Counting
jokes alone, Chaparral had seventy-seven
clippings to thirty-two from the Uni
versity of Wisconsin Octopus, the near
est competitor. Including cuts, the
Chaparral's total was seventy-eight, the
Octopus again following in order with
forty clippings.
Another Hammer and Coffin publica
tion of Washington Sun-Dodger, was
third, with a total of thirty-five.
