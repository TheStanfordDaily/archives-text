### (By United Press 
NEW YORK, Feb. 2. â€”Nobody knows
now and nobody around here seems to
t are much about William H. Dempsey,
the date of his next act, his partner,
or how much he gets.
When everyone was trying to figure
why Tex Rickard withdrew from the
list of bidders for the next' heavy
weight championship fight, William
Muldoon, the czar of the boxing com
mission, stepped out and announced
that he was the reason.
Muldoon said he had advised Rick
ard to help stop all the foolish million
dollar talk going on about the next
title bout, and that Rickard had agreed
to do his part.
