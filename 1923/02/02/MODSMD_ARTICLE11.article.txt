# ODDITIES OF NAVAJO INDIANS IS TOPIC OF SPEECH TONIGHT
## 
### 
The oddities of life and customs
among the desert tribes of the Navajo
Indians will be the subject of a talk to
be given tonight by Mrs. John Weatherill
in the Palo Alto Woman's Club House
at 8 o'clock.
Mrs. Weatherill has been in close con
tact with the Navajo tribes for more
than forty years, and during that time
has held an influential place in their re
gard. She was early adopted by the
Navajos, who came to look upon her as
a chief endowed with mystic powers.
Disputes between the tribes, and between
the Indians and the government have
been settled many times by Mrs.
Weatherill.
In her talk tonight, Mrs. Weatherill
will not dwell on any one point, but will
cover as much of the field of her experi
ence as the time will allow. Rather
than make the talk an "educational lec
ture," Mrs. Weatherill plans to relate
interesting anecdotes regarding the In
dians by way of illustrating their pe
culiar manners and customs.
Tickets, which arc 50 cents, are now
on sale at Crandall's, Thoits', and the
Sequoia Bookshop. The talk is being
given under the auspices of the Palo Art
Club, of which Mrs. Theodore Hoover
is president.
