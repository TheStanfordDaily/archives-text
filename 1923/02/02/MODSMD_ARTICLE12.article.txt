# Alumni Societies Asked To Celebrate Founder's Day
## 
### 
Notices are now being sent out by
the office of the Alumni Secretary to
the various Stanford Alumni associa
tions throughout the country asking
them to make plans for the celebra
tion of Founder's Day, March 9. Most
of the forty-nine associations will prob
ably hold a luncheon or dinner. It is
likely that in many cases prominent
alumni and faculty members will
speak.
