# THETA CHI, SIGMA CHI VICTORS IN LEAGUE 6
## 
### 
Sigma Chi met unexpected opposi-1
tion in an intramural basketball game
last night and Los Arcos came within
a point of tying the contest which
Sigma Chi managed to win 9-8. Theta
Chi completely outclassed Encina Hall
fifth floor team 30>-0, Sequoia Hall sec- j
ond floor team defeated El Toro 11-8,
and Delta Kappa Epsilon won a slow
game from Encina Hall first floor 15-8,
in the three other contests played yes
terday.
Sigma Chi Barely Noses Out
Los Arcos After Hard Fight
The Sigma Chi players took the
floor yesterday afternoon against Los
Arcos, fully expecting to win by a
sizeable margin Tremaine and Camp
bell started the scoring and at half
time had piled up a fair lead over Los
Arcos, leading 7-1. But in the second
half the Los Arcos forwards broke
loose a number of times and the Sigma
Chi men resorted to holding. Blacker
had his eye on the basket and shot
five free throws in succession, giving
Los Arcos a good start in the scoring j
column. At the same time the Sigma
Chi foul shooters missed the hoop and
a field goal by Haley put Los Arcos
within a point of their opponents.
Theta Chi Whitewashes Encina
Hall in Runaway Contest 30-0
Theta Chi easily won from Encina
Hall fifth floor 30-0 and thereby kept
pace with Sigma Chi, each having a
record of four victories and no de
feats. In the final league game next
week Sigma Chi and Theta Chi meet

to decide the title in League 6. Com
parative scores give Theta Chi the
advantage and if they can produce the
same team and the same brand of bas
ketball next week they should be able
to win.
The game last night was so one
sided that the only interest it held was
in watching the scoring machine of
Theta Chi roll up the points. Smith led
in the scoring with four field goals
and two free throws, and Green made
four baskets from the floor. Smith was
the outstanding star of the game, re
ceiving able support from Rollings
worth and Green.
Sequoia Hall Downs El Toro;
Delta Kappa Epsilon Also Wins
Sequoia Hall, second floor, won their
first game when they downed El Toro
11-8 in one of the cleanest games of
the tournament. The first half was fast
and close, Sequoia emerging with a
one-point lead. After half time the
teams continued on even terms until
Brown caged two pretty shots for Se
quoia and gave them sufficient score
to win. The passing was accurate and
the dribbling good. Brown made the
best record for Sequoia with four
shots from the floor and one free
throw. Crever made a good showing
for El Toro and with a little team
work to aid him would have scored
more baskets.
Delta Kappa Epsilon was consider
ably surprised by the Encina team and
was held during the first half to an
8-8 score. When they realized that they
had real opposition they put some pep
into their play and scored four field
goals, at the same time holding the
Encina forwards at bay. Steffan was
the whole scoring machine for Delta
Kappa Epsilon, making four field shots
and three free throws. Robinson was
the mainstay of the Encina defense
and shared in the scores made by his
team.
Today's games are: Phi Gamma
Delta and Japanese Club, in Pavilion,
5 p. m.; Breakers and Encina Hall,
second floor, in Pavilion, 5:40 p. m.;
Alpha Delta Phi and Beta Theta Pi,
in Encina Gym, 5 p. m.
This is the end of the fourth round
of the tournament. The fifth and final
round will be played off next week and
the inter-league games will be run off
the following week.

same team and the same brand of bas
ketball next week they should be able
to win.
The game last night was so one
sided that the only interest it held was
in watching the scoring machine of
Theta Chi roll up the points. Smith led
in the scoring with four field goals
and two free throws, and Green made
four baskets from the floor. Smith was
the outstanding star of the game, re
ceiving able support from Rollings
worth and Green.
Sequoia Hall Downs El Toro;
Delta Kappa Epsilon Also Wins
Sequoia Hall, second floor, won their
first game when they downed El Toro
11-8 in one of the cleanest games of
the tournament. The first half was fast
and close, Sequoia emerging with a
one-point lead. After half time the
teams continued on even terms until
Brown caged two pretty shots for Se
quoia and gave them sufficient score
to win. The passing was accurate and
the dribbling good. Brown made the
best record for Sequoia with four
shots from the floor and one free
throw. Crever made a good showing
for El Toro and with a little team
work to aid him would have scored
more baskets.
Delta Kappa Epsilon was consider
ably surprised by the Encina team and
was held during the first half to an
8-8 score. When they realized that they
had real opposition they put some pep
into their play and scored four field
goals, at the same time holding the
Encina forwards at bay. Steffan was
the whole scoring machine for Delta
Kappa Epsilon, making four field shots
and three free throws. Robinson was
the mainstay of the Encina defense
and shared in the scores made by his
team.
Today's games are: Phi Gamma
Delta and Japanese Club, in Pavilion,
5 p. m.; Breakers and Encina Hall,
second floor, in Pavilion, 5:40 p. m.;
Alpha Delta Phi and Beta Theta Pi,
in Encina Gym, 5 p. m.
This is the end of the fourth round
of the tournament. The fifth and final
round will be played off next week and
the inter-league games will be run off
the following week.

Sigma Chi Barely Noses Out
Los Arcos After Hard Fight
The Sigma Chi players took the
floor yesterday afternoon against Los
Arcos, fully expecting to win by a
sizeable margin Tremaine and Camp
bell started the scoring and at half
time had piled up a fair lead over Los
Arcos, leading 7-1. But in the second
half the Los Arcos forwards broke
loose a number of times and the Sigma
Chi men resorted to holding. Blacker
had his eye on the basket and shot
five free throws in succession, giving
Los Arcos a good start in the scoring j
column. At the same time the Sigma
Chi foul shooters missed the hoop and
a field goal by Haley put Los Arcos
within a point of their opponents.
Theta Chi Whitewashes Encina
Hall in Runaway Contest 30-0
Theta Chi easily won from Encina
Hall fifth floor 30-0 and thereby kept
pace with Sigma Chi, each having a
record of four victories and no de
feats. In the final league game next
week Sigma Chi and Theta Chi meet

to decide the title in League 6. Com

advantage and if they can produce the
