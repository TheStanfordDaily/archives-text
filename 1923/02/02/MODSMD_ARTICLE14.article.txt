# FRESHMAN FIVE TO MEET OAKLANDERS
## 
### 
Oakland High School, reputed to have
one of the strongest basketball teams
around the bay, will furnish the opposi
j tion for the 1926 quintet tomorrow night
|in the Pavilion. The game will be
played as a preliminary to the Stanford
Varsity-University of Southern Cali
fornia tussle.
The Oakland lads have gone through
a hard preliminary season without losing
«a game and are on edge for the battle
tomorrow night.
The babes may be due to play good
basketball and again may not. Although
they tacked a defeat on to the Berkeley
High School five Wednesday, a trick
that no freshman team has done for the
past four years, they did not play the
high brand of basketball that they
| showed in the California game.
Coach Hunt has been putting the squad
through some stiff work—two teams
scrimmaging last night for more than
half an hour.
Morrison is coming back strong after
his long lay-off. due to an injured ankle.
He has recovered his eye for the basket
and has always been a willing mixer.
Hunt may start him tomorrow night.
At the forward jobs, it's the same old
story—Nevers and Frazier. These two
boys arc working together better in ev
ery game and have leases on their re
spective positions. Captain Mitchell is
sure to start at the running guard posi
tion unless an injury to his ankle, which
he got last night in practice, proves to
be serious. McDermot will probably
start at standing guard, although this
big fellow, Harris, will probably get into
the fray, as he has been showing up well
in practice.
