## 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound basketball team
will play tbe preliminary contest to the
Stanford-U. S. C. game against Lowell
High School at 7 o'clock tonight in the
Pavilion.
The Lowell High quintet was easily
defeated early in the season by the Stan
ford freshmen basketball team. The
high school five played very poorly in
this game, and unless they have improved
a great deal recently, the 145-pound team
ought to have little difficulty in running
up a winning score.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has been coach
ing the light-heavyweight team during
the last week, and although they were
defeated by the Santa Slara Preps Tues
day night, 15 to 11. the squad has shown
considerable improvement as the result
of Hunt's work.
Cornell and Steffan seem to be the
logical pair for the forward positions
this evening. This couple have per
formed comparatively well recently,
forming the main cog of the light
heavyweight offensive.
Grace will start at the center position,
and the two O'Hara brothers wil do the
guarding.
