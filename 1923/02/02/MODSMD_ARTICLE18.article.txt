# CARDS-TROJANS IN TWO GAME SERIES
## STANFORD QUINTET HAS REAL BATTLE IN FIRST P.C.C. CONTEST Trojans Fresh From Victory Over U. C. Promise Stiff Opposition For Kerr's Varsity Squad 
### 
In Les Turner's Trojan five, the Cardinals will face the stiffest competition
so far this season when the two teams meet tonight on the Pavilion court.
The game will start at 8:15.
Fresh from their victory over Wight's University of California squad, the
Southerners arrived on the campus today in the best of shape for the two
game series here. Although far from being the crucial series of the year, the
outcome of the two contests will give the fans a good line on the possible
results of the southern schedule of the Pacific Coast Conference.
At the present only two games of the schedule have been played, U. S. C.
and California dividing thse. Should Stanford take both of the games with

the Trojans, she will have an advan
tage over the ether teams no matter
what the outcome may be of the Cali
fornia-U. S. C. series to be played at
Berkeley Monday and Tuesday. *
Nothing is really known of the
strength of the southern team with the
exception that they handed the Blue
and Gold their first defeat of the sea
son and in that game, their star guard.
Bone, did not play. The squad is made
up mostly of men from Coach Hender
son's football squad and includes men
such as Gordon Campbell, "Swede"
Anderson, Hawkins, Pythian, and CaÂ»-
land.
Kenneth White, captain and forward
on the team, together with Gordon
Campbell have been accounting for
most of the baskets this season in the
south with Hawkins and Tony Waya
han contributing their share. John
Hawkins is playing center while
"Swede" Anderson at standing guard
has been a tower of defense for the
Trojans. Campbell is ordinarily a for
ward but when Charley Bone was in
jured, he worked into the running
guard position like a veteran.
Kerr, with all of his first string
men in the best of shape and plenty
of reliable substitutes, has nothing to
fear in the series which starts tonight. /
For nearly every position, he has three
players in reserve which assures him
of fresh men throughout the contest.
Playing the same style of defense
that was shown in the preliminary
schedule, it is safe to predict that the
Trojans will find it hard going in their
attempts to run up a score against the
Cardinal five. Dave Oliva and Fred
Anderson will start the game at their
regular guard positions and it is pos
sible that Dud DeGroot may be able
to get in the game a short time at hta
old place.
At the center job, Bob Janssen with
an edge over Gurdon Steele in experi
-1 ence, will start while Captain "Deity"
Rogers and "Nip" McHose will form
the brunt of the offense. Summy, Aus
tin, Hooper, and Shipkey will be used
as reserves and may see service in the-
U. S. C. series.
