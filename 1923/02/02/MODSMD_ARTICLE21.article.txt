# JEFFERSON CLUB TO FURNISH OPPOSITION FOR VARSITY NINE
## 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Right off the plate, the Stanford
baseball varsity is ready to give the
Jefferson Club nine of San Francisco
a surprise in the way of diamond fod
der when the teams clash in the first
game of the preliminary season to
morrow afternoon. Play will start at
3 o'clock on the varsity field.
The Jeffersonians are hard meat for
any team to tackle in its first game,
but Coach Wolter's men have planned
their course and don't intend to budge
from it. The old traditional jinx that
has followed Cardinal baseball for so
many years will be forcibly shown the
way out.
The clubmen have considerable of a
reputation in semi-pro baseball circles
of the Peninsula. At present, they are
participating in the Midwinter League
of San Francisco and are one of the
top-notchers. Their play against the
varsities of California, Santa Clara,
and St. Mary's in past years has al
ways been speedy.
Now add to the advantages of a good
fielding and hitting bunch, a star
heaver! A1 Schumacher twirled su
perb ball against the Bears last year,
holding them to five hits, and only
losing out 4-3 in ten innings of play.
Schumacher will join Little Rock in
the Southern Association later in the
season. And behind the bat for the San
Franciscans, there will be Ray Beck,
one of the best catchers in semi-pro
baseball.
As a fielding team, Stanford has an
efficient combination, but as to hitting
no one knows for the men haven't had
much of a chance as yet to show their
stuff. They went through an intensive
workout yesterday afternoon. Wolter
has made no attempt at selecting a
nine to take the field against the club
men, so it is probable that every
member of the squad will be given a
chance.
Aydelotte will probably start things
for the varsity tomorrow, with Lowen
stein, Clark, anH Solomon on deck.
Huneke and Fuller will both get a
chance to wear the mask.
The old veterans have the advantage
for tries in the infield positions. Cap
tain Peavy, Woodward, Patterson, Rob
erts, Muchay, and Heckendorf will all
participate. Parker, May, Deffenbach,
McCandless, and Carver should do a
good deal of globe trotting in the outer
gardens if the Jefferson willow busters
perform as they have in the past.
Students wlil be admitted to the
game on presentation of student body
cards.

baseball varsity is ready to give the
Jefferson Club nine of San Francisco
a surprise in the way of diamond fod
der when the teams clash in the first
game of the preliminary season to
morrow afternoon. Play will start at
3 o'clock on the varsity field.
The Jeffersonians are hard meat for
any team to tackle in its first game,
but Coach Wolter's men have planned
their course and don't intend to budge
from it. The old traditional jinx that
has followed Cardinal baseball for so
many years will be forcibly shown the
way out.
The clubmen have considerable of a
reputation in semi-pro baseball circles
of the Peninsula. At present, they are
participating in the Midwinter League
of San Francisco and are one of the
top-notchers. Their play against the
varsities of California, Santa Clara,
and St. Mary's in past years has al
ways been speedy.
Now add to the advantages of a good
fielding and hitting bunch, a star
heaver! A1 Schumacher twirled su
perb ball against the Bears last year,
holding them to five hits, and only
losing out 4-3 in ten innings of play.
Schumacher will join Little Rock in
the Southern Association later in the
season. And behind the bat for the San
Franciscans, there will be Ray Beck,
one of the best catchers in semi-pro
baseball.
As a fielding team, Stanford has an
efficient combination, but as to hitting
no one knows for the men haven't had
much of a chance as yet to show their
stuff. They went through an intensive
workout yesterday afternoon. Wolter
has made no attempt at selecting a
nine to take the field against the club
men, so it is probable that every
member of the squad will be given a
chance.
Aydelotte will probably start things
for the varsity tomorrow, with Lowen
stein, Clark, anH Solomon on deck.
Huneke and Fuller will both get a
chance to wear the mask.
The old veterans have the advantage
for tries in the infield positions. Cap
tain Peavy, Woodward, Patterson, Rob
erts, Muchay, and Heckendorf will all
participate. Parker, May, Deffenbach,
McCandless, and Carver should do a
good deal of globe trotting in the outer
gardens if the Jefferson willow busters
perform as they have in the past.
Students wlil be admitted to the
game on presentation of student body
cards.
