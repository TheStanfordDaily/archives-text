# A 						HOT TIME IN THE FUTURE

"That makes two in a row you've stolen from me,"
declared the Devil, impaling Saint Peter with his
piercing eyes. "You know confounded well I've
had an empty bake oven for more than a week. That
pair would have fitted it perfectly. Besides, you
wouldn't let me roast that last professor for more
than a thousand years. He was only fairly warm,
really just beginning to brown nicely, when you gave
him a drink and sent him with a requisition to the
wing and harp department." And the Devil stabbed
his spear-headed tail fully an inch into the gold
mesh carpet.
Saint Peter smiled craftily. "No use talking, you
haven't turned out a good roast for aeons," he as
serted. "Why should 1 make you a gift of a fairly
good fellow, who, after all, was only guilty of man
slaughter, with the market the way it is these days?
Nobody's' been buying since the war. They're all
using their last year's wings and restringing their
harps. If a fellow's any good at all, I'm going to
keep him. There's plenty of bad ones coming in
off and on."
A resounding knock at the door sent the Devil
to his feet, lie started forward but did an unex
pected back-flip. Savagely jerking his tail loose
from the floor, he admitted the newcomer. The
Devil was in a very bad frame of mind. Exhaling
a huge volume of Stygian smoke, he addressed the
Stranger.
Devil—Who are you?
Stranger—l am Richard Doe.
Devil—What was your occupation?
Stranger—l was a sophomore at Stanford Uni
versity.
Devil—Hah! Bacon! Had some of your ilk
some years ago. They will serve up well after a
few centuries' grilling.
Saint Peter' —Richard Doe, do you care anything
for your University ?
iStranger—l certainly do!
Saint Peter—Have you ever done anything to
injure it?
Stranger—Never!
Saint Peter—Fine! Why didn't you come up
sooner? We need more like you here.
Stranger—l was busy disciplining freshmen. The
last one was a Tartar and sent me up here.
Devil (excitedly)— Hell's Bells! Did you say
you watered freshmen?
Stranger—Among other things, yes.
Devil (wildly)— Holy Hooch! Why you gin
mill, water puts out fires!
Saint Peter —Fiend! I thought you never did
anything to injure the University?
Stranger—l didn't. I made it what it is. I
watered and paddled all the cocky frosh who
queened my girls. I man-handled those who
wouldn't carry my trunk upstairs. I took conceit
out of them by making them do all the dirty work.
Being so much older and wiser, I had to do these
things. I was a maker of Stanford men. I was
all-wise and all-mighty. I had been to college for
a year. I was a Sophomore!
Devil (gloats)— Hah! None have escaped me
yet!
Saint Peter —Did not the University forbid this?
Stranger—Yes. But the authorities were stupid
old fogies who forgot all about their college days
and had a chronic case of reformitis.
Saint Peter—You declare that you did nothing
to injure the University. Yet you admit that you
broke the rules. You blame the authorities. Hence
forth, you are not to be known as Richard Doe. In
your new home you shall be Alibi Arthur.
Devil (in an ecstasy of delight)— He's mine! No
water-cart can get bv me. Ah, my poor ovens are
parching even now!
Stranger—Spare me! The upperclassmen told
me to do it.
Saint Peter —To Hell with you!
FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
Stanford opens her conference court season to
night against the Trojan five. The southerners seem
to be a hard team to dope because of their erratic
showing against California. Yet, their win over the
Bears in their second game shows that they are
potential victors against the toughest of opposition.
The Cards will have no easy time of it tonight, but
will have a fairly even chance.

Saint Peter —To Hell with you!
FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
Stanford opens her conference court season to
night against the Trojan five. The southerners seem
to be a hard team to dope because of their erratic
showing against California. Yet, their win over the
Bears in their second game shows that they are
potential victors against the toughest of opposition.
The Cards will have no easy time of it tonight, but
will have a fairly even chance.
"That makes two in a row you've stolen from me,"
declared the Devil, impaling Saint Peter with his
piercing eyes. "You know confounded well I've
had an empty bake oven for more than a week. That
pair would have fitted it perfectly. Besides, you
wouldn't let me roast that last professor for more
than a thousand years. He was only fairly warm,
really just beginning to brown nicely, when you gave
him a drink and sent him with a requisition to the
wing and harp department." And the Devil stabbed
his spear-headed tail fully an inch into the gold
mesh carpet.
Saint Peter smiled craftily. "No use talking, you
haven't turned out a good roast for aeons," he as
serted. "Why should 1 make you a gift of a fairly
good fellow, who, after all, was only guilty of man
slaughter, with the market the way it is these days?
Nobody's' been buying since the war. They're all
using their last year's wings and restringing their
harps. If a fellow's any good at all, I'm going to
keep him. There's plenty of bad ones coming in
off and on."
A resounding knock at the door sent the Devil
to his feet, lie started forward but did an unex
pected back-flip. Savagely jerking his tail loose
from the floor, he admitted the newcomer. The
Devil was in a very bad frame of mind. Exhaling
a huge volume of Stygian smoke, he addressed the
Stranger.
Devil—Who are you?
Stranger—l am Richard Doe.
Devil—What was your occupation?
Stranger—l was a sophomore at Stanford Uni
versity.
Devil—Hah! Bacon! Had some of your ilk
some years ago. They will serve up well after a
few centuries' grilling.
Saint Peter' —Richard Doe, do you care anything
for your University ?
iStranger—l certainly do!
Saint Peter—Have you ever done anything to
injure it?
Stranger—Never!
Saint Peter—Fine! Why didn't you come up
sooner? We need more like you here.
Stranger—l was busy disciplining freshmen. The
last one was a Tartar and sent me up here.
Devil (excitedly)— Hell's Bells! Did you say
you watered freshmen?
Stranger—Among other things, yes.
Devil (wildly)— Holy Hooch! Why you gin
mill, water puts out fires!
Saint Peter —Fiend! I thought you never did
anything to injure the University?
Stranger—l didn't. I made it what it is. I
watered and paddled all the cocky frosh who
queened my girls. I man-handled those who
wouldn't carry my trunk upstairs. I took conceit
out of them by making them do all the dirty work.
Being so much older and wiser, I had to do these
things. I was a maker of Stanford men. I was
all-wise and all-mighty. I had been to college for
a year. I was a Sophomore!
Devil (gloats)— Hah! None have escaped me
yet!
Saint Peter —Did not the University forbid this?
Stranger—Yes. But the authorities were stupid
old fogies who forgot all about their college days
and had a chronic case of reformitis.
Saint Peter—You declare that you did nothing
to injure the University. Yet you admit that you
broke the rules. You blame the authorities. Hence
forth, you are not to be known as Richard Doe. In
your new home you shall be Alibi Arthur.
Devil (in an ecstasy of delight)— He's mine! No
water-cart can get bv me. Ah, my poor ovens are
parching even now!
Stranger—Spare me! The upperclassmen told
me to do it.
