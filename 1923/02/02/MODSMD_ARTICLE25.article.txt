ODE ON A SYLLABUS SHEET
Oh, fluttering thing of dirty white,
Must I study thee again tonight?
Your skeleton form of crude design,
I grab each day from Prof benign.
Who thinks he does us all a favor •
By such a dish of studious flavor.
The wrong side holes and technical booth
Stare in my face as the prof still hoots.
By yards and reams of dope on beams
I wonder, sheet, if he ever dreams
That I cast thee away, along with the fish net
Where skeletons should be, into the closet.
