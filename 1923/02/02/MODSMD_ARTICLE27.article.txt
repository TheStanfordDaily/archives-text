February 2, 1917
Stanford's long cherished ideal of
democracy has passed. In its place
has risen a new aristocracy, a new
nobility. If you doubt it, glance at the
long lines of names in the "Bawl Out"
which appeared today. There are
seven kings roaming around the cam
pus, unhonored and unsung, one Earl,
two Squires, and two unclassified
Nobles. These form the nucleus of
the aristocracy.
A Japanese rugby team has been or
ganized at Stanford for the first time,
and will compete with Oriental fifteens
from other colleges and organizations.
A challenge sent to the Chinese rugby
team of California was accepted.
Twenty-one men, eighteen of them
from Stanford, will leave San Fran
cisco Sunday for France for service
in the American Ambulance Corps.
The "Friends of France" society in
which some of the wealthiest men in
the West hold membership, is spon
soring the trip, paying the men's ex
penses while there.
A student almost lost his eyesight
today while performing an experiment
in the Chemistry laboratory. The ex
plosion was caused by water getting
into a flask of hot concentrated sul
phuric acid.
Three baseball games are on tomor
row afternoon's sport calendar. The
varsity crosses willows with the fast
Olympic Club team, the freshmen en
counter Palo Alto High School, and a
combined team of peanut league play
ers meets Manzanita high.
Stanford's varsity basketball five
faces one of the hardest parts of Its
schedule in the games arranged for
the coming week. Tomorrow night, the
men go to San Francisco to meet St.
Ignatius, while on Monday and Tues
day nights, they play the strong
Washington State quintet.
