Edtior Daily Palo Alto:
Letters which have appeared recently
in the D. P. A. suggest to me that the
following observations may he of gen
eral interest at this time.
The published financial reports cov
ering the operation of tlfe Board of Ath
letic Control show that football is the
only sport which results in a net gain,
and the funds available for other sports
depend upon this source. Last autumn
the revenues from football were less
than were anticipated, and this will ne
cessitate very careful and economical
management during the balance of the
year. There is no connection between
the present and immediate need for
economy and the dormitory project, since
no payments on the latter have been
made or are due.
The Stadium is not yet paid for, and
large sums must be set aside for this
purpose during the next three years.
The payments on the dormitory, when
they begin, will be smaller than those
now being made on the Stadium.
The construction of the Stadium has
increased the income account substan
tially. Since the Stadium itself is a
gift, this increase in income is clear gain
above what it would have been if our
alumni had not been so generous. A
portion only of this increase in income
is to be devoted to the dormitory.
The present overcrowded condition of
the dormitories is a serious handicap in
many ways to the students who occupy
them. Is there any more immediate
need, athletic or otherwise, than adequate
dormitory facilities?
