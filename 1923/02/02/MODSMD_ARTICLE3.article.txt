## 
### (By United Press 
MEXICO CITY, Feb. 2â€”Soldiers,
guarding the street railway system
here, were reinforced today following
fighting between Yaqui troops and
trolley strikers in which ten men were
killed and thirty wounded yesterday.
Radicals among the strikers started
the trouble when they shot into a trol
ley car in front of Labor Union head
quarters. The Yaqui guard, reinforced
by federal troops, answered the fire,
killing several, and then charged into
the labor hall where hand-to-hand
fighting resulted, both the soldiers and
strikers firing point blank.
