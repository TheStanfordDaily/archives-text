# PROFESSOR PAYSON TREAT LECTURES AT WRANGLERS' MEETING
## 
### 
"The great objection to the textbook
system in college is that it is difficult to
secure books which are not colored with
the views of the author," was the opin
ion expressed by Professor Payson J.
Treat, head of the History department,
in discussing "The Relative Value of
Recitations and Lectures" before
Wranglers Society in the clubhouse last
night.
Professor Treat advocated the lecture
system in college because it leads to a
more accurate grasp of the subject, as
only a limited amount of reading can be
done and will be done by the student
while the professor specializes in his
particular field and has something to
bring to the student which the latter
could not otherwise obtain.
Answering the objection that many
students haven't the ability to take proper
notes, Professor Treat said "The time
must come in the life of every student
when he passes from high school to col
lege methods. Some college students
are not averse to thinking. The time
has gone by when you take them by the
hand and lead them to the trough of
learning."
Discussion groups arc not feasible, be
lieves Professor Treat. Students will
ask questions after class if they desire
to find out any additional information.
