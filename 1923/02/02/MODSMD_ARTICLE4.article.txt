# PREMIER HUGHES OF AUSTRALIA RESIGNS
## 
### (By United Press 
MELBOURNE, Feb. 2. â€” Premier
Hughes, of Australia, has resigned.
S. M. Bruce, secretary of the treas
ury in the Hughes' coalition cabinet
of December 27, 1921, was invited to
form a ministry.
Hughes was in much the same posi
tino as Lloyd George found himself in
last year; he headed a coalition that
had thrived on patriotism in war time,
but which was steadily weakened by
development of party spirit in politics
within the last two years.
