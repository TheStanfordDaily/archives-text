â€”you can sell them
for thousands
Why is a used book unJike a used
car? Because the more you use it,
the more you can sell it for.
Books make brains, and the world
pays high for brain power.
The bulging dome on the library is
worth emulating. It marks the way
to bulging pockets.
Don't take our word for it. Ask
some of the old grads, the men
who have gone out before you to
tsell their books.
Some have sold them for more than
others. Why? Just ask.
But, you may say, books are not
' the only thing. You're right.
Still, they help.
