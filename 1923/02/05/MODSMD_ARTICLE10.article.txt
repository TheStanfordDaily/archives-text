Individual performance rather than}
j concentrated teamwork, won a ragged
basketball game for the Cardinal 145-
pounders against Lowell High School's
; light-heavyweight team, 19 to 7, last
Friday night. The game was played
preliminary to the Varsity-U. S. C. con-1
test.
Using a five-man defense to good j
advantage, the weight team kept the |
Lowell High School score down to one!
point in the first stanza.
Two field goals by Steffen in rapid
succession, followed by another shot
by Grace, gave the 145's a lead which
; Lowell never headed.
Cornell converted a foul, making the
: score 7-0, until Van Horn, the visitors'
forward, dropped a free throw through
! the hoop, ending the quarter 7-1 in
favor of Stanford.
In the second quarter Grace started
things out with a long shot from the
side of the court. Here the scoring
stopped, however, until Cornell shot a
i foul in the last few minutes of the
I period.
Ted Steffen was a wizard on the j
â€¢ floor, and the Lowell guard had a
difficult time covering him; neverthe
less Steffen missed many easy goals ;
by hurrying his shots when there was
j plenty of time to shoot carefully.
Passing was poor, and teamwork was
lacking on both squads. Only Van
Horn, of Lowell, exhibited any ability |
for the visitors in the offensive. The |
prep forward shot the only points
j scored by Lowell in the first half.
Cornell ran wild in the second half;
he began the period with a field goal,
and increased the score two points
immediately afterward with a pair of
free throws. Stanford tallied again
when Logan found the basket along
toward the middle of the third quar
ter. Cornell converted three fouls, and
: the game ended, 10 to 7, in favor of the
| Card quintet.
