some of the numbers. Elizabeth Peirce,

Sonata.
A dramatic reading from J. M.

a musical accompaniment composed
by Dr. True.
Schubert Club itself is to sing two
groups of numbers of three selections
each. One of these groups is of mod
ern and the other of classical numbers.
Miss Marjorie McDonald, '24, club ac
companist, will play all the accom
paniments for the program.
This concert replaces the regular
Tuesday evening lecture.
