# "Rollo's Wild Oat" Is One of Longest Real Comic Successes
## 
### Allan Charles, '25 
Three and a half hours is unusually ,
long for a comedy.
"Rollo's Wild Oat," the farce by Clare
Kummer given Friday evening in the
Assembly Hall by the Greek Theater
Players succeeded in keeping an audi
ence in continual laughing apprecia-1
tion from the rise of the curtain at
8:30 to its fall at 11:55.
The only time when sounds of
amusement quieted down was when
the comic situation of Rollo's return
from the interrupted performance of
"Hamlet," his one wild oat, to hear the
supposed dying words of his grand
father, was overpowered by a sense of
the pathetic, ably impressed by Cor
rigan.
The most striking characteristic of
Sam Hume's engaging presentation
was that the entire cast from the
masculine and feminine leads to the
household servant were almost above
criticism. The parts, which bubble
with humanness were taken by pro
fessional actors and actresses whose
ages fitted them properly into their
places.
Because this same cast has played
together in "Rollo's Wild Oat" sev
eral times previous to the Friday pre
sentation, and therefore had the
chance to profit by experience and to
study out the parts carefully, there
was much of the finish and smoothness :
in the production which the usual ama-

I teur play lacks.
The comedy was a little too long,
bu the fresh humor, the reality of
characterization and the admirable
acting maintained the audience's at-
S tention.
Several of the best comic scenes
were quite dramatic. Of first mention
is the actual offering of "Hamlet" by
Rollo, and Rollo's dressing-room scene
preceding the showing of "Hamlet."
Lloyd Corrigan, as Rollo Webster,
displayed many of the attractive "em
barassments" of Booth Tarkington's
favorite young men mingled with
something of the appearance of Clar
ence Kelland's Mark Tidd. The part
was difficult, one which could easily
be overdone, but Corrigan played it
with engaging spontaneity.
Lois Austin, who played Goldie Mac-
Duff, the Ophelia of Rollo's "Hamlet,"
is an actress whom Stanford audiences
would like to see often. She was a girl
of charming qualities, yet very unaf
fected and sincere.
The audience seemed as disappoint
ed as did Rollo when she replied "Oh.
no" to his request that she "Sing it
again"—the little song "about roses"
introduced in the first scene. Harold
Minger, as Hewston, Rollo's man.
whose crushed ambition likewise was
to play "Hamlet," presented a very
real picture of a smitten spirit.
The hopeless despair of his life a^.
it came from his hollow, deep voice
and his slow, dejected walk made him
too pathetic a figure to laugh at con
tinually.
Mr. Stein, a theatrical manager,
played by Louis Karp, was one of the
audience's obvious favorites.
Rollo's pretty sister, as played by
Phyllis Blake, was exquisitely roman
tic and appealing. Her eager desire to
play some kind of a part in Rollo's
play could not be put off by her un
appreciative brother.
Horatio Webster, Rollo's grand
father; Aunt Lane, Rollo's aunt; Bella,
the Websters' housemaid; and the four
of the profession, including George
Lucas, the expressive lover of Rollo's
sister, were all effectively portrayed.
The stage settings and the lighting,
which were in charge of Chrysella
Dunker, were pleasing. The scenes
were simple and artistically done. The
four changes of scene were made quite
rapidly for the Assembly Hall stage.

Lucas, the expressive lover of Rollo's
sister, were all effectively portrayed.
The stage settings and the lighting,
which were in charge of Chrysella
Dunker, were pleasing. The scenes
were simple and artistically done. The
four changes of scene were made quite
rapidly for the Assembly Hall stage.
Three and a half hours is unusually ,
long for a comedy.
"Rollo's Wild Oat," the farce by Clare
Kummer given Friday evening in the
Assembly Hall by the Greek Theater
Players succeeded in keeping an audi
ence in continual laughing apprecia-1
tion from the rise of the curtain at
8:30 to its fall at 11:55.
The only time when sounds of
amusement quieted down was when
the comic situation of Rollo's return
from the interrupted performance of
"Hamlet," his one wild oat, to hear the
supposed dying words of his grand
father, was overpowered by a sense of
the pathetic, ably impressed by Cor
rigan.
The most striking characteristic of
Sam Hume's engaging presentation
was that the entire cast from the
masculine and feminine leads to the
household servant were almost above
criticism. The parts, which bubble
with humanness were taken by pro
fessional actors and actresses whose
ages fitted them properly into their
places.
Because this same cast has played
together in "Rollo's Wild Oat" sev
eral times previous to the Friday pre
sentation, and therefore had the
chance to profit by experience and to
study out the parts carefully, there
was much of the finish and smoothness :
in the production which the usual ama-

I teur play lacks.
The comedy was a little too long,
bu the fresh humor, the reality of
characterization and the admirable
acting maintained the audience's at-
S tention.
Several of the best comic scenes
were quite dramatic. Of first mention
is the actual offering of "Hamlet" by
Rollo, and Rollo's dressing-room scene
preceding the showing of "Hamlet."
Lloyd Corrigan, as Rollo Webster,
displayed many of the attractive "em
barassments" of Booth Tarkington's
favorite young men mingled with
something of the appearance of Clar
ence Kelland's Mark Tidd. The part
was difficult, one which could easily
be overdone, but Corrigan played it
with engaging spontaneity.
Lois Austin, who played Goldie Mac-
Duff, the Ophelia of Rollo's "Hamlet,"
is an actress whom Stanford audiences
would like to see often. She was a girl
of charming qualities, yet very unaf
fected and sincere.
The audience seemed as disappoint
ed as did Rollo when she replied "Oh.
no" to his request that she "Sing it
again"—the little song "about roses"
introduced in the first scene. Harold
Minger, as Hewston, Rollo's man.
whose crushed ambition likewise was
to play "Hamlet," presented a very
real picture of a smitten spirit.
The hopeless despair of his life a^.
it came from his hollow, deep voice
and his slow, dejected walk made him
too pathetic a figure to laugh at con
tinually.
Mr. Stein, a theatrical manager,
played by Louis Karp, was one of the
audience's obvious favorites.
Rollo's pretty sister, as played by
Phyllis Blake, was exquisitely roman
tic and appealing. Her eager desire to
play some kind of a part in Rollo's
play could not be put off by her un
appreciative brother.
Horatio Webster, Rollo's grand
father; Aunt Lane, Rollo's aunt; Bella,
the Websters' housemaid; and the four
of the profession, including George
Lucas, the expressive lover of Rollo's
sister, were all effectively portrayed.
