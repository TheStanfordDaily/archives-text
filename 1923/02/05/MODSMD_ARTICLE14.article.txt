# TROPHY FOR CLASS CHAMPION IN EIGHT SPORTS IS PLANNED
## Point System Will Be Used in Competition; Scheme Up to Executive Committee 
### 
Hereafter, if the Executive Commit
tee of the Associated Students ap
proves the plan, the class athletic
championship in a comprehensive
schedule of sports running through the
year will be decided annually and the
numerals of the winning class and the
runner-up will be inscribed on a per
manent trophy cup.
Point System Used
The four class presidents and the
staff of coaches with Dr. Barrow and
Charles W. Davis, Director of Intra
mural Sports, have worked out a plan
of inter-class contests in football, bas
ketball, baseball, soccer, swimming,
track, cross country running, and ten
nis, with a system of point scoring.
The class with the largest total at
the end of the year will be declared
champion and, with that winning the
second largest total, will have its name
inscribed on the permanent trophy
cup.
Class Sport Manager Needed
A committee composed of Director
Davis, Track Coach R. L. Templeton,
and Myron E. Reed, senior class presi
dent, will present the scheme to the
executive committee for its approval.
Each class will be expected to select
a class manager, the four to form a
committee to determine questions of
eligibility and such matters in confer
ence with the gymnasium staff and
coaches.
The schedule of inter-class competi
tion will be under the general super
vision of Director Davis.
First Award This Year
It is hoped that the four classes will
contribute a part of the money needed
to provide a cup for the permanent
trophy.
The first award will be made at the
end of the present year, the seniors
already having a start on the other
classes through having won both foot
ball and basketball.
Points will probably be counted, first
place, five, second, three, third, two,
and fourth, one.
The new plan will not supplant the
present system of intramural sports
between living groups.
