# REVISING THE CONSTITUTION
## 
### 
Since the present A. S. S. U. constitution went
into effect those who have been guided by it have
spent half their time interpreting and the other half
amending. As a group of laws guiding the action of
undergraduate executives, it cannot be doubted that
the document is a great success. But no constitution
that may be expected to stand long can be so inclusive,
detailed and specific as the one we now have. A con
stitution may imply and should imply, it may be
specific in some respects and should be, but it can
never be effective if it contains all such details as
rightfully belong in the by-laws. It is unweildy,
complicated, and hampers the free action which a
democracy should have.
Realizing this the Executive Committee has drawn
up a new constitution embodying the desirable prin
ciples of the old one and providing for needed addi
tions and reorganizations. Much of the detail work
is left to the by-laws. It would be no more absurd
for some of the present contents to remain in the con
stitution than it would be for traffic laws to be pro
vided for in detail in the state constitution.
The new constitution will be printed in the Daily
Palo Alto beginning Wednesday until the mid-year
election, a week later. The various innovations will
be discussed and view-points regarding proposed
changes will lie printed on the editorial page.
It is the duty of every Stanford student interested
in the administration of student affairs to read this
new constitution carefully and to make such sug
gestions concerning it as he thinks proper. The con
stitution of a student democracy must not only be
for and by the students, but of the students. And
this number must be a majority.
