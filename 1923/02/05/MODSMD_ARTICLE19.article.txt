# POTENTIAL CHAMPIONS

Andy Kerr's five threw a couple of bombs Friday
and Saturday nights that not only threw the Trojans
into a fit of surprise, but literally astounded the Stan
ford rooters. At least fifty per cent of the Stan
ford people present at Friday's game thought that the
Cards had only a fighting chance for victory. When
the score stood at 19-3 at the end of the first half,
they went into a daze from which they failed to re
cover until the series was over.
Kerr and Jimmy Da vies have developed a team
that with plenty of practice could defeat any team
on the coast. The outcome of the California series
will depend upon whether or not the Cards have
reached the height of their season. At the highest
point of efficiency under the present system, the
Cards are potential champions in any league.
Kerr's quintet is probably the lightest on the coast.
Big men are usually a requisite in basketball. Yet
the Trojans, huge in size, fell before the offensive
of forwards diminutive by comparison. And their
size did not help them greatly in solving the air-tight
defense the Stanford quintet has perfected. In Kerr,
Davies, and the Card players, Stanford has some
thing of which to be proud.
