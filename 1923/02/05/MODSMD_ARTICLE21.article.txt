# BASEBALL STARTS
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolters started in his baseball sea
son Saturday afternoon with a win. For a team to
taste victory in its first game is not only a pleasant
feeling, but a psychological advantage. And each
victory added means additional strength in confi
dence and team-play.
Wolters has been a Stanford baseball coach before
and is familiar with the problems of the situation.
His season was a success when he coached in 1916
and this one has already assumed like appearance.
Stanford needs a baseball victory to restore this
major sport to its former popularity.
