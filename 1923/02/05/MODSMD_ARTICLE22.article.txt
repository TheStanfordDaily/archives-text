# CABBAGES and THINGS H.M. '24
## 
### 
That Contributor's number tomorrow is already
becoming overcrowded. Cabbages is delighted at the
number of saps there are outside the columnists who
write for this sheet. "Sapient Sapiens," (Latin for
"Long live the Saps") quotes an ancient writer. Which
merely goes to show that even in the olden days a sap
was appreciated. Rally 'round, turn in the sappiest stuff
you have, and maybe Wednesday we'll have a SAP
NUMBER and run the best of the contributions then.
Remember, address Box 1304.

EDITORIAL
It is high time English authorities, whoever they are,
should take up the important duty of seeing that well
known phrases are eliminated from common use-age and
writage.
There is one expression that is an insult: This invidi
ous collection of verbiage is "On sober second thought."
Our ministers use it. Authors uso it. And everyone is
using it, thereby insulting his readers and hearers.
For it implies that our first thought is intoxicated!
Otherwise our second thoughts could not be called sober.
Many of our readers do not drink at all and their
thoughts are sober, mighty sober.
Let our English profs take up this matter and thus
eliminate these insults from our language.

Ferdie Meat, the cracked quarter-miler, has found
that the best way to break the tape in the six-sixty is
to drop out for a couple of laps, then jump in behind the
leader and trip him up with a rubber band as he comes
into the stretch. To break the tape successfully, grab
the thing as you go by and pull.

Oliver Anthill, Stanford '06, champion corn field event
man, writes that athletes of today are not like they
used to be. In his day, says Anthill, he won the broad
jump at thirty feet, and placed third in the shot by
tying the shot to his ankle before heaving. He then
put the shot, at the same time putting himself out
thirty feet.

A dramatized cemetery plot was awarded Cornelius
Choke for his remarkable work in the hop-skip-and-jump.
Choke hit six l'eet flat, and the owners of the feet were
unanimous in their cheers.
