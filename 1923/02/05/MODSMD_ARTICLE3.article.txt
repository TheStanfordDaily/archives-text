# ALLIED DIPLOMATS SEEK A MEANS TO AVOID WAR

LAUSANNE, Feb. 5. (United Press).
—Aliled diplomats sought a means to
avoid war in the Near East today, fol
lowing collapse of the Lausanne confer
ence.
Isast Fasha, Turk delegate, also at
tempted peaceful maneuvers, seeking to
avoid responsibility for the breakdown
that followed his refusal to sign the peace
treaty presented by the allies.
Marquis Curzon, head of the British
delegation, went to Paris last night, quit
ting the parley after the allies and Amer
ican Observer Child had pleaded vainly
with the Turks to sign.
The French and Italians remained here.
Today, after apparently fruitless ef
forts to secure renewal of the parley, the
French delegation followed the example
of the British and withdrew. The Italian
delegation, headed by Garroni, was ex
pected to depart Tuesday.
Isasst Pasha issued a statement, saying
the Mudania armistice pact will remain
in effect "until Lausanne ends." He pre
tends not to recognize that the British
withdrawal is tantamount to collapse of
the confcrence.
There are three possibilities, according
to well-informed British sources:
I—The Turks may still sign; Ameri
can Ambassador Child is endeavoring to
persuade them to, and the allies have left
secretaries at Lausanne in case Ismet
Pasha decides to do so.
2—Further negotiations may take place
elsewhere.
3—Turkish hotheads may force war.
LONDON, Feb. s.—British air forces
will bomb Angora, capital of Turkey, if
the Turks attack Mosul, it was under
stood today as plans of the war office and
the cabinet in the Near-East crisis were
partially disclosed.
