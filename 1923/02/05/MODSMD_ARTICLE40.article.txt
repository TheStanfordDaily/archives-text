# CALIFORNIA PLANS TO CREATE CREW INTEREST
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.
â€”Organization of a new University boat
ing club for the purpose of stimulating
interest in crew was the decision of sev
enty men who recently gathered at a sign
up rally.
The primary object of such an enter
prise is to create more interest among
the students, so that the annual race will
be in the same class with the big game.
A publicity campaign will be started on
the campus in the near future and a drive
for funds to erect a clubhouse will be
conducted.
