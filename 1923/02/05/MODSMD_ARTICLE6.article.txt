# VARSITY BASEBALL NINE TAKES FIRST GAME OF SEASON
## Cards Hit at Opportune Times And Win 13-3 Diamond Bout from Jefferson Club 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Five runs in the first inning were
sufficient for a win in the initial base
ball game of the preliminary season
Saturday afternoon. But the Cards
didn't think so and kept right on going
so that in the ninth frame, the score
read: Stanford, 13; Jeffersons, 3. The
contest was played on the varsity dia

May, together with two walks netting
five runs. In the second inning, the
Cards were still going strong, Hecken
dorf reaching third on Peavy's pelt
into right field and coming over the
rubber on Woodward's sacrifice.
Schumacher had Stanford tamed in
the next inning, but in the fifth, had
to go through another five-run torture.
Heckendorf led off with a single and
came home on Roberts' beautiful dou
ble—his second hit of the day. Captain
Peavy connected with a pretty drive
over first nad then stole second. Some
one got excited in the outer gardens
and dropped Woodward's fly which
let in two more runs. Then McCand

that "Bud" did. and it worked so well
that Woodward came home. A wild
