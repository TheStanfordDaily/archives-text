# VARSITY BASEBALL NINE TAKES FIRST GAME OF SEASON
## Cards Hit at Opportune Times And Win 13-3 Diamond Bout from Jefferson Club 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Five runs in the first inning were
sufficient for a win in the initial base
ball game of the preliminary season
Saturday afternoon. But the Cards
didn't think so and kept right on going
so that in the ninth frame, the score
read: Stanford, 13; Jeffersons, 3. The
contest was played on the varsity dia
mond.
Jeffersons Lose Pep
The Jeffersons Club invaded the
campus with the reputation of being
one of the strongest semi-pro aggre
gations in San Francisco. Either the
clubmen were off form or the varsity
is a mean hitting and fielding bunch
this year.
Stanford garnered ten hits to the
Jeffersons' six, and all of them were
timely and counted for scores.
Both teams had a tendency to err
but the Cards played the more con
sistent and brilliant game.
Jim Clark started the box for the
varsity and pitched good ball, sending
three men back to the bench via the
strikeout route. A1 Loewenstein re
lieved him in the sixth canto. Schu
macher, heaving for the Jeffersons,
probably had an off day for the Cards
found him easily right at the start.
Five Cross Pan in First
Stanford started off with a ven
geance in the first stanza, singles by
Roberts, Woodward, McCandless, and
May, together with two walks netting
five runs. In the second inning, the
Cards were still going strong, Hecken
dorf reaching third on Peavy's pelt
into right field and coming over the
rubber on Woodward's sacrifice.
Schumacher had Stanford tamed in
the next inning, but in the fifth, had
to go through another five-run torture.
Heckendorf led off with a single and
came home on Roberts' beautiful dou
ble—his second hit of the day. Captain
Peavy connected with a pretty drive
over first nad then stole second. Some
one got excited in the outer gardens
and dropped Woodward's fly which
let in two more runs. Then McCand
less tried the same kind of a stunt
that "Bud" did. and it worked so well
that Woodward came home. A wild
throw to first let McCandless in with
the fifth tally of the inning.
Jeffersons Score on Error
For the next two innings, Stanford
was blanked, while the San Francis
cans awoke from their stupor in the
fifth and broke into the scoring column
with a run. Schumacher was safe on
first through an error of the Cards'
first sacker, and advanced to second
on Toney's single. Huneke overthrew
third in an attempt to snag off Schu
macher and the score was made.
Stanford showed up just twice as
well in the seventh episode as did the
Jeffersonians, making two runs and
two hits. Carver, who substituted for
McCandless, twinned into left field,
and came home on Parker's drive over
second. Fuller, who had taken
Huneke's place blieind the bat, walked,
Heckendorf was safe on first through
an error, and the bases were loaded.
"Shorty" Roberts sacrificed, and Stan
ford's last score for the day was regis
tered.
The Jeffersons added their second
marker of the afternoon in the seventh
on two hits and an error. Another
count was annexed in the following
inning on a single and a bad over
throw.
Cards Swing Mighty Sticks
Coach Wolter's face now has a big
grin on it. He already knew that his
men could field but he was rather ap
prehensive about their batting abili
ties. The way they pelted the old
horsehide Saturday right at the proper
time relieved this doubt.
Stanford tackles the Ambrose Tailor
nine of Oakland on the varsity dia
mond Wednesday afternoon. The Bay
Region men have always been strong
and the Cards expect a real battle.
The Varsity-Jefferson Club started
with the following line-ups:
Varsity— Jeffersons —
Clark p Schumacher
Huneke c Beck
Woodward IB Toney
Peavy 2b Goleman
