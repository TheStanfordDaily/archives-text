# VARSITY OUTPLAYS BARBARIAN SOCCER TEAM; FRESHMEN TIE
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity eleven outclassed
the Barbarian Club team 4-1 last Sat
urday afternoon on the field at Eleventh
and Mission, San Francisco, in one of
the deciding games of the Inter-club
Soccer League series.
The Barbarians were second in the
League standing and the closest rivals of
the Stanford varsity for the University
and Club championship.
The Cards now have a lead of two
games and eight goals over their nearest
competitor and should experience little
difficulty in winning the league cham
cas,, sinking one basket and covering his
man in good shape.
In their best game of the season the
freshmen soccerites held the more ex
to a 1-1 tic at the Golden Gate Stadium
perienced Unione Sportiva Italiana team
on the same afternoon.
The shifting of Devlin to outside left
Street to outside right, and Whitehead to
left half, benefited the freshmen offensive
and enabled them to keep the ball in their
opponents' territory much of the time.
The varsity had little trouble in defeat
ing the Barbarians, although the Cards
did not get going well until after the
Barbs had scored their first and only goal.
Soon after this Ta'am kicked a goal for
Stanford and Franklin followed with an
other before the end of the half, making
the score 2-1 in favor of Stanford
The second half was much faster and
was marked by rushes from goal to
goal. The Barbs, however were unable
to scorc again while Ta'am added two
more for Stanford.
Charley Paict, center forward, start
ed for the Barbarians. His speedy foot
work enabled him to break up many of
the varsity's plays and he showed plenty
of wind and endurance. The Barbs did
not follow up as well as the Stanford men
and lost the benefits of several strong
rushes because they did not go in soon
enough.
