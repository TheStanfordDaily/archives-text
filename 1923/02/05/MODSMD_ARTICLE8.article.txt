# CARDS TAKE LEAD IN SOUTHERN HALF OF P.C.C. SCHEDULE
## Trojans Easily Beaten in Two Games; Football Tactics Used 
### 
Stanford, by virtue of her two victories over the University of Southern
California basketball squad last Friday and Saturday, now leads the southern
half of the Pacific Coast Conference.
As football players, the Trojan squad lived up to their reputation. The two
games here last week were probably the roughest ever seen on the Pavilion
floor. In the first contest, the Cardinal five came through with an offense that
completely bewildered the visitors and won easily by a score of 29 to 14. The
second game, which was probably the rougher of the two, also went to Stan
ford, 23 to 12.
Being football players the Trojans outweighed the Cardinals by a good
margin. Led by Gordon Campbell, Henderson's star backfield man, the
Southerners started out in the first game to teach Kerr's players something
of the gridiron sport but while they were doing it, they evidently forgot that
they were supposed to play basketball for the Cardinal five had little trouble

I in running up a large score and at the
same time holding the visitors to one
fiel dgoal.
Someone made a mistake when they
said that the Cardinal team did not
have an offense, in fact a very big mis
take. Not only were the Stanford for
wards shooting well but their ability
to work the ball under the basket
where it counted for points dazzled the
Trojans as well as the fans. "Nip"
McHose was the main strength in the
Cardinal offense and size and weight
was no handicap to liim when it came
to dribbling past the husky "Swede"
Anderson.
Gordon Campbell gave the Stanford
quintet their first score by a personal foul,
followed by four quick consecutive field
goals by McHose and Janssen. From
then on, the outcome of the game was
never in doubt, Kerr's five leading at half
time by a score of 19 to 3. In the sec
ond half, the Trojan defense stiffened
and the game slowed up to an extent. Up
until the last few minutes of the first
game, the U. S. C. team was practically
shut out, Charley Bone saving them by
a long shot from the side lines after Kerr
had replaced his first five by substitutes.
The second contest can be rated
more easily as a football game than a
basketball contest. Unnecessary rough
ness on the part of the Trojans was
in evidence throughout the game and
in the second half, Referee Sam Moyer
sent both Campbell and "Swede" An
derson to the bench for too many per
sonal fouls.
Although the Trojans played a better
offensive game than exhibited the night
before, the contest was marred from a
spectators viewpoint by rough play. In
this, being the lighter team, the Cardinals
had the worst of the deal. In spite this,
however, Stanford had little trouble in
running up a large score and at half time,
was leading 13 to 2. The play in the sec
ond half was far from an improvement
over that seen in the first half and in all,
twelve personal fouls were made in this
period.
"Nip" McHose was the star per
former for both nights. In the first
game, the diminutive forward ac-
counted for nineteen points of the
Cardinal score while on the second
night, lie was responsible for eighteen
of Stanford's twenty-three points.
Charley Bone, through his dribbling,
and work on the foul line, was easily
the best man that the Trojans boasted.

basketball contest. Unnecessary rough
ness on the part of the Trojans was
in evidence throughout the game and
in the second half, Referee Sam Moyer
sent both Campbell and "Swede" An
derson to the bench for too many per
sonal fouls.
Although the Trojans played a better
offensive game than exhibited the night
before, the contest was marred from a
spectators viewpoint by rough play. In
this, being the lighter team, the Cardinals
had the worst of the deal. In spite this,
however, Stanford had little trouble in
running up a large score and at half time,
was leading 13 to 2. The play in the sec
ond half was far from an improvement
over that seen in the first half and in all,
twelve personal fouls were made in this
period.
"Nip" McHose was the star per
former for both nights. In the first
game, the diminutive forward ac-
counted for nineteen points of the
Cardinal score while on the second
night, lie was responsible for eighteen
of Stanford's twenty-three points.
Charley Bone, through his dribbling,
and work on the foul line, was easily
the best man that the Trojans boasted.

Stanford, by virtue of her two victories over the University of Southern
California basketball squad last Friday and Saturday, now leads the southern
half of the Pacific Coast Conference.
As football players, the Trojan squad lived up to their reputation. The two
games here last week were probably the roughest ever seen on the Pavilion
floor. In the first contest, the Cardinal five came through with an offense that
completely bewildered the visitors and won easily by a score of 29 to 14. The
second game, which was probably the rougher of the two, also went to Stan
ford, 23 to 12.
Being football players the Trojans outweighed the Cardinals by a good
margin. Led by Gordon Campbell, Henderson's star backfield man, the
Southerners started out in the first game to teach Kerr's players something
of the gridiron sport but while they were doing it, they evidently forgot that
they were supposed to play basketball for the Cardinal five had little trouble

I in running up a large score and at the
same time holding the visitors to one
fiel dgoal.
Someone made a mistake when they
said that the Cardinal team did not
have an offense, in fact a very big mis
take. Not only were the Stanford for
wards shooting well but their ability
to work the ball under the basket
where it counted for points dazzled the
Trojans as well as the fans. "Nip"
McHose was the main strength in the
Cardinal offense and size and weight
was no handicap to liim when it came
to dribbling past the husky "Swede"
Anderson.
Gordon Campbell gave the Stanford
quintet their first score by a personal foul,
followed by four quick consecutive field
goals by McHose and Janssen. From
then on, the outcome of the game was
never in doubt, Kerr's five leading at half
time by a score of 19 to 3. In the sec
ond half, the Trojan defense stiffened
and the game slowed up to an extent. Up
until the last few minutes of the first
game, the U. S. C. team was practically
shut out, Charley Bone saving them by
a long shot from the side lines after Kerr
had replaced his first five by substitutes.

Stanford, by virtue of her two victories over the University of Southern
California basketball squad last Friday and Saturday, now leads the southern
half of the Pacific Coast Conference.
As football players, the Trojan squad lived up to their reputation. The two
games here last week were probably the roughest ever seen on the Pavilion
floor. In the first contest, the Cardinal five came through with an offense that
completely bewildered the visitors and won easily by a score of 29 to 14. The
second game, which was probably the rougher of the two, also went to Stan
ford, 23 to 12.
Being football players the Trojans outweighed the Cardinals by a good
margin. Led by Gordon Campbell, Henderson's star backfield man, the
Southerners started out in the first game to teach Kerr's players something
of the gridiron sport but while they were doing it, they evidently forgot that
they were supposed to play basketball for the Cardinal five had little trouble

I in running up a large score and at the
same time holding the visitors to one
fiel dgoal.
Someone made a mistake when they
said that the Cardinal team did not
have an offense, in fact a very big mis
take. Not only were the Stanford for
wards shooting well but their ability
to work the ball under the basket
where it counted for points dazzled the
Trojans as well as the fans. "Nip"
McHose was the main strength in the
Cardinal offense and size and weight
was no handicap to liim when it came
to dribbling past the husky "Swede"
Anderson.
Gordon Campbell gave the Stanford
quintet their first score by a personal foul,
followed by four quick consecutive field
goals by McHose and Janssen. From
then on, the outcome of the game was
never in doubt, Kerr's five leading at half
time by a score of 19 to 3. In the sec
ond half, the Trojan defense stiffened
and the game slowed up to an extent. Up
until the last few minutes of the first
game, the U. S. C. team was practically
shut out, Charley Bone saving them by
a long shot from the side lines after Kerr
had replaced his first five by substitutes.
The second contest can be rated
more easily as a football game than a
basketball contest. Unnecessary rough
ness on the part of the Trojans was
in evidence throughout the game and
in the second half, Referee Sam Moyer
sent both Campbell and "Swede" An
derson to the bench for too many per
sonal fouls.
Although the Trojans played a better
offensive game than exhibited the night
before, the contest was marred from a
spectators viewpoint by rough play. In
this, being the lighter team, the Cardinals
had the worst of the deal. In spite this,
however, Stanford had little trouble in
running up a large score and at half time,
was leading 13 to 2. The play in the sec
ond half was far from an improvement
over that seen in the first half and in all,
twelve personal fouls were made in this
period.
"Nip" McHose was the star per
former for both nights. In the first
game, the diminutive forward ac-
counted for nineteen points of the
Cardinal score while on the second
night, lie was responsible for eighteen
of Stanford's twenty-three points.
Charley Bone, through his dribbling,
and work on the foul line, was easily
the best man that the Trojans boasted.
