# ONE POINT WINS FOR FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM
## 
### 
Two free throws by Frazier in the last
two minutes won a 26-25 victory for the
freshman basketball team in a hard
fought game against Oakland High
School in the Pavilion Saturday night.
The preps came to the Farm wi& a
clear record and played bang-up basket
ball during the entire game.
Sibbet, their captain and forward, was
easily the outstanding star of the eve
ning. In addition to leading the scor
ing column with four field goals and five
free ones—a total of thirteen points, he
played a good floor game and was val
uable on the defensive.
Frazier and Mitchell did the best play
ing for the 1926 aggregation, although
Nevers was high point man with four
field goals and two free ones. Frazier
contributed two field goals and four free
baskets and covered the floor well. Mit
chell showed signs of returning to his old
game after a slump in the Berkeley fra
pionship for the third successive year.
Nevers failed to pass at critical times,
preferring to try for long shots, which
might have led to trouble if Carter had
not caged three in the second half.
As usual, the yearlings were slow in
opening up. The game was two minutes
old before Mitchell dropped one in from
under the hoop.
Friend, the long, lanky prep ccnter,
