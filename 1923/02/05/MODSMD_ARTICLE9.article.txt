# ONE POINT WINS FOR FRESHMAN CAGE TEAM
## 
### 
Two free throws by Frazier in the last
two minutes won a 26-25 victory for the
freshman basketball team in a hard
fought game against Oakland High
School in the Pavilion Saturday night.
The preps came to the Farm wi& a
clear record and played bang-up basket
ball during the entire game.
Sibbet, their captain and forward, was
easily the outstanding star of the eve
ning. In addition to leading the scor
ing column with four field goals and five
free ones—a total of thirteen points, he
played a good floor game and was val
uable on the defensive.
Frazier and Mitchell did the best play
ing for the 1926 aggregation, although
Nevers was high point man with four
field goals and two free ones. Frazier
contributed two field goals and four free
baskets and covered the floor well. Mit
chell showed signs of returning to his old
game after a slump in the Berkeley fra
pionship for the third successive year.
Nevers failed to pass at critical times,
preferring to try for long shots, which
might have led to trouble if Carter had
not caged three in the second half.
As usual, the yearlings were slow in
opening up. The game was two minutes
old before Mitchell dropped one in from
under the hoop.
Friend, the long, lanky prep ccnter,
sunk a pretty one a mintue later. Nevers
gave the babes a three point lead on a
free throw and a field goal, and fra
zier added two more. Two free throws by
Sibbet and a field goal by Conner cut the
lead down to one point.
Nevers and Frazier each sunk another
one and the score stood 11-6. Barrett and
Sibbet accounted for five more points and
Nevers converted a free one.
Here the half ended with the yearlings
leading 12-11.
At the beginning of the second half,
things began to happe nin rapid order.
Carter tipped one in under the basket and
Friend did the same for the preps a few
seconds later, Sibbet tying the score with
a free one. Carter had found his eye and
dropped in pretty one soon after, but
Sibbet agjjin tied the count at 16-16. Two
free ones by Frazier and a field goal by
Nevers gave the babes a four point lead.
Sibbet ran wild again and put the Oak
land lads in the lead with two from the
field and a free one. The freshmen
couldn't find the hoop and it began to
look like a victory for the high school
team when Barrett increased the lead to
three points.
Carter again stepped to the front, bring
| ing the babes' total to 22, lacking one
point of tying the score. Barrett got an
other one and Nevers found the hoop a
moment later.
Still the preps lead 25-24.
At this point Frazier stepped into the
limelight, sinking two free ones and put
ting the game on ice just as the timer
reached for his gun.

Two free throws by Frazier in the last
two minutes won a 26-25 victory for the
freshman basketball team in a hard
fought game against Oakland High
School in the Pavilion Saturday night.
The preps came to the Farm wi& a
clear record and played bang-up basket
ball during the entire game.
Sibbet, their captain and forward, was
easily the outstanding star of the eve
ning. In addition to leading the scor
ing column with four field goals and five
free ones—a total of thirteen points, he
played a good floor game and was val
uable on the defensive.
Frazier and Mitchell did the best play
ing for the 1926 aggregation, although
Nevers was high point man with four
field goals and two free ones. Frazier
contributed two field goals and four free
baskets and covered the floor well. Mit
chell showed signs of returning to his old
game after a slump in the Berkeley fra
pionship for the third successive year.
Nevers failed to pass at critical times,
preferring to try for long shots, which
might have led to trouble if Carter had
not caged three in the second half.
As usual, the yearlings were slow in
opening up. The game was two minutes
old before Mitchell dropped one in from
under the hoop.
Friend, the long, lanky prep ccnter,
sunk a pretty one a mintue later. Nevers
gave the babes a three point lead on a
free throw and a field goal, and fra
zier added two more. Two free throws by
Sibbet and a field goal by Conner cut the
lead down to one point.
Nevers and Frazier each sunk another
one and the score stood 11-6. Barrett and
Sibbet accounted for five more points and
Nevers converted a free one.
Here the half ended with the yearlings
leading 12-11.
At the beginning of the second half,
things began to happe nin rapid order.
Carter tipped one in under the basket and
Friend did the same for the preps a few
seconds later, Sibbet tying the score with
a free one. Carter had found his eye and
dropped in pretty one soon after, but
Sibbet agjjin tied the count at 16-16. Two
free ones by Frazier and a field goal by
Nevers gave the babes a four point lead.
Sibbet ran wild again and put the Oak
land lads in the lead with two from the
field and a free one. The freshmen
couldn't find the hoop and it began to
look like a victory for the high school
team when Barrett increased the lead to
three points.
Carter again stepped to the front, bring
| ing the babes' total to 22, lacking one
point of tying the score. Barrett got an
other one and Nevers found the hoop a
moment later.
Still the preps lead 25-24.
At this point Frazier stepped into the
limelight, sinking two free ones and put
ting the game on ice just as the timer
reached for his gun.
