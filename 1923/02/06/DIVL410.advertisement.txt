FROM A GIRL
Dear Jack, you said you want
ed me
To be your Valenti(m)e,
And so I've tried just ever so
To put myself In rhyme.
My heart's not with me in the
task.
I don't know what to say:
Please tell me where my
heart IS,
If perchance it's flown your .
way.
I simply just must have my
heart
To give me inspiration,
Or else a box of candy
With a college education.
