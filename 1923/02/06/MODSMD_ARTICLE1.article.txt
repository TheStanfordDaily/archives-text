## ARISTOCRACY ROUTED BY DANCER AT YALE PROM 
### (By United Press 
NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb. 6â€”The
little Miss Ritzes from uptown New
York and the ultra-exclusive Miss
Vans, of aristocratic Connecticut, were
out-Ritzed and out-Van'ed today by the
little Broadway dancer they didn't
want to allow at the Yale junior prom,
classiest of eastern collegiate dances.
Ula Sharon, premier danseuse of the
Greenwich Village Follies, got there
at 3 a. m., more dazzling than a sun
rise, and was the hit of the ball.
