# BASEBALL VARSITY 10 MIX WITH FAST AMBROSE TAILORS
## Oakland Squad Has Quintet of Coast Leaguers on Roster; Game Scheduled Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's baseball nine will go up
against professional league talent to
morrow when the Ambrose Tailor ag
gregation from Oakland invades the
campus to hang up a supposedly easy
win. The game is called for 3 p. m.
on the varsity diamond.
Tailors Have Good Team
The Tailors have been playing good
steady ball this year in the Tribune
League of the East Bay Region and
have gained a notorious reputation for
putting a flashy and speedy line-up on
the field. They might just as well be
named the Oakland Club of the Pa
cific Coast League for five of the regu
lars are on the Oakland roster. Kohler,
who will catch, was probably the best
backstop in the Coast League last
year, Coach Wolter thinks. He will be
on hand tomorrow together with eight
others who have played the national
pastime long enough to know how to
field, and who do not stop short of
murdering the ball when once their
sticks have a good chance of connect
ing with it.
The varsity has a tough boat to
row! But, just the same, starting out
the season with a victory is pretty
nice, the men think, and, rather than
spoil everything, they hope to keep
right on tomorrow. They were certain
ly surprised at the ease with which
the victory came over the Jefferson
Club team last Saturday. The men
played pretty clean ball—Coach Wol
ter had expected as much of them —
but the way they managed the clubs —•
that was the best part of all. They
were able to hit when men were on
the bases, which helped a lot in piling
up a total of thirteen scores.
Pitchers Inexperienced
The big problem this year, however,
is buliding up a reliable and winning
pitching staff. The rest of the team is
good but can't go far in winning ball
games if the twirlers fail to come*
through in the pinches. Jim Clark, a
veteran from last year's staff, held the
touted Jefferson slabsters to six meas
ly hits, and in one comparatively tight
pinch, pulled himself together and
wiggled out easily. The rest of the
staff haven't had as much experience,
but they have a lot of twirling tech
nique stored up in their arms just the
same.
Jim Aydelott, a star heaver from last
year's freshman squad, is slated for
mound duty tomorrow, while A1
Huneke will function behind the bat.
