# "WHERE ARE MY SHOULDER STRAPS; WHO HAS ROUGE?"

"Mine lias no shoulder straps.''
"Where are my shoes?"
"Who has my rouge ?"
These remarks were not those made
by a group of women getting ready for
the morning eight-o'clock; nay, they were
not made by females at all!
But the costumes arrived yesterday for
the Ram's Head Show, and there was a
mad scramble to get red-haired cast
members into red-haired wigs, and red
wigs with the proper dresses, and the
correct shoes (not forgetting size, either
my dear!) for the different members
of the cast and chorus.
A little touch of rouge will make the
whole world grin—if it is not properly
applied. So says Arnold Bayley, direc
tor of the show, and he spent all yester
day afternoon applying it properly to
the cheeks of the "female" members of
the cast.
Finally the whole company was ready,
and lined up on the stage for their pub
licity pictures. In the background the
chorus—sturdy gallants in dress suits
escorting bobbed-haired flappers attired
in scintillating evening dress.
And in the foreground strides a gal
lant knight, arm in arm with a most
modern young man, and surrounded by
haughty dames, and lovely maidens, and
a burly gentleman in riding breeches.
All these and more stop a moment in
front of the camera, start at the flare
of the flashlight, and then pass into the
wings, only to come back a moment or
two later shorn of their trappings, play
ing their accustomed parts of students
once more.
