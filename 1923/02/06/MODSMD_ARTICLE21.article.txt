# CHEMISTRY HEAD LEAVES SOON ON NATIONWIDE TOUR
## Dr. E.C. Franklin Will Give Thirty Lectures in Field Which He Has Developed 
### 
Dr. Edward C. Franklin, professor of
organic chemistry at Stanford and re
| cently elected president of the Ameri
can Chemical Society, will leave the
campus tiie middle of March for a tour
of the country during which he will
give more than thirty lectures in the
field of chemical research which he
has developed, the ammonia system
of compounds. These lectures he il
lustrates by experimental demonstra
tions.
To Make Yale Presentation
In the course of his trip he will at
tend the meeting of the American.
Chemical Society at Yale University,
April 2-5, at which he will preside a*
president and assist in the dedication,
of Yale's Sterling Laboratories, the
two million dollar chemical laboratory
building which has been presented to
Yale. The building will be turned over
to Dr. Franklin in his capacity as pres
ident of the American Chemical So
ciety and by him formally presented
to Yale. Dr. Franklin will return to
Stanford in the latter part of May.
The series of lectures will be before
local sections of the American Chem
ical Society and largely on university
campuses. The trip is the outcome of
a movement started by Erie Billings,
a chemist with the Eastman Kodak
Company, who last year at the meeting
of the American Chemical Society in
Pittsburgh proposed that Dr. Franklin
be requested to make it, with the re
sult that the various sections of the
country arranged the itinerary.
Lecture Schedule
His first lecture will be before the
Southern California section in Los
Angeles on March 16. From there he

meetings in New York state, coming
westward and making his last sched

There is a possibility that he may go
to Seattle and Portland before he re
turns to Stanford.
Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, director of the
Stanford Food Research Institute and
chairman of the California section of
the American Chemical Society, will
