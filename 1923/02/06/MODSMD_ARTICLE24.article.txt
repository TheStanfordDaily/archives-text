The student body seems to he going- the Execu
tive Committee one better in the matter of drives.
First, the Committee succeeds in getting financial
appeals limited to one each quarter, and now the
students are cutting down their response to this lim
ited number. Hard lines for the organizations cam
paigning. The returns from the first drive under
the new system was not promising for the success of
this modified community chest idea. The second
campaign began yesterday; its success or failure will
show the practicality of the plan. Both the organi
zations campaigning, the Y. W. C. A.and the Y. M.
C. A., are doing constructive and worth while work
for a certain portion of the student body. Whether
or not you have personally benefited by their work,
your social vision should be sufficiently broad to
enable you to see the value of the organizations to
the community. No one wants to return to the old
free-for-all system of conducting drives ; so dig down
and make the one-drive-a-quarter plan a success.
