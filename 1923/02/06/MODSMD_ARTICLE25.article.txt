# CLASS CHAMPIONSHIPS
## 
### 
Executive Committee will tonight hear the plan
proposed by athletic authorities providing - for the in
stitution of a point system and the awarding of a
class trophy for championships in interclass games.
This is a further development of an effectively com
prehensive scheme in interclass competition worked
out by gymnasium officers earlier in the year.
Development of class spirit is an assential to col
lege spirit. Eastern undergraduate bodies have lit
tle of college spirit, but the class spirit they develop
during - their college careers carries them through
their alumni days in a united body. Competition be
tween classes in athletics, in other activities, and in
scholarship should be fostered continually. Clean
undergraduate rivalry is an education in itself that
will be found of great value in community life else
where.
The return of interclass competition in athletics
has been viewed with satisfaction by the students and
has already had a beneficial effect upon the under
graduate body. Factional feeling has been forgotten
in a new and cleaner rivalry. Constructive compe
tition has become the order.
This new development should contain few faults
in the eyes of Executive Committee, upon whom the
institution of the plan depends. If it is recommended
by responsible gymnasium officials, there is no ap
parent reason why it should not be given student
sanction.
