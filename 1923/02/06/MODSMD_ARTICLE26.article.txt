# FACULTY ADMISSION CHARGES
## 
### 
Although members of the faculty have in the past
been granted the privilege of buying season tickets
for the same price as alumni, no provision has been
made whereby they may be admitted at reduced
rates to conference games. A price is charged that
is often prohibitive to members of the faculty who
would really like to attend such athletic contests. It"
they take time to see a game, they want it to be one
of the best, and it is the conference games to which
they look for such entertainment.
The California game would not have to be in
cluded in this revision if it were made, for it is to tha
football game with the Bruins that the Board of Ath
letic Control looks for its biggest source of income.
The Big Game is a special occasion, an athletic treat,
to which all but students during their four under
graduate years should pa)' a little more than would
ordinarily be charged.
This is made merely as a suggestion to the athletic
authorities, who will undoubtedly give the matter
fair consideration if it is called to their attention.
