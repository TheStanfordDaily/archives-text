And now the contemporaries of the editors of Cab
bages have a chance to show their stuff. We are aware
that there are them on the campus what does not like
Cabbages; we are aware that there are them what
does; and both of them have contributed to this issue.
We now step to both sides and let them do their tricks.

Dear Ed:
The following fragment of scintillating verse is sub
mitted for the delectation of your already stupefied
senses. May it speak for itself. —Mr. S. Green.
Of Samuel Green, that man so mean,
I'll sing a song to you.
Of features grim, of nose so slim,
Of drinking habits, too.
His height was tall, his mind so small.
That thru a knot-hole he could crawl.
His teeth were long and loose.
They waggled out and in,
His beak-like nose projected far
Beyond his ingrown chin.
His hair was red, his eyes were black,
His breath smelled strong of apple-jack.
He had a horse, he had a dog,
He had a cat and cow,
And finally had a little wife, with whom
He'd often row.
The sun's bright beams he'd dodge,
He loved the moonlight chill,
For even down, within the ground,
He had his moonshine still.
Sincerely yours,
Wotta Blank, '23.

Basket Team Defeats Cage Five
Hog Wallow Institute of Technograpy today defeated
the Pink Sweater team of Phoenix by a score of 0-0.
The game was close, the referee making many of the
baskets from the sidelines.
The last half was rough, being merely a continuation
of the general fight commenced at the first of the
game. One of the prettiest shots of the game was that
made by the Phoenix coach with a forty-four from the
bench. He dropped the opposing center with one
cartridge.
Captain D. Feat of the Pink Sweaters hurt his head
during the game; the referee also slipped and fell on
his, but no damage being done; the game then con
tinued. —Clipped from the Phoenix Journal.

of the general fight commenced at the first of the
game. One of the prettiest shots of the game was that
made by the Phoenix coach with a forty-four from the
bench. He dropped the opposing center with one
cartridge.
Captain D. Feat of the Pink Sweaters hurt his head
during the game; the referee also slipped and fell on
his, but no damage being done; the game then con
tinued. —Clipped from the Phoenix Journal.

And now the contemporaries of the editors of Cab
bages have a chance to show their stuff. We are aware
that there are them on the campus what does not like
Cabbages; we are aware that there are them what
does; and both of them have contributed to this issue.
We now step to both sides and let them do their tricks.

Dear Ed:
The following fragment of scintillating verse is sub
mitted for the delectation of your already stupefied
senses. May it speak for itself. —Mr. S. Green.
Of Samuel Green, that man so mean,
I'll sing a song to you.
Of features grim, of nose so slim,
Of drinking habits, too.
His height was tall, his mind so small.
That thru a knot-hole he could crawl.
His teeth were long and loose.
They waggled out and in,
His beak-like nose projected far
Beyond his ingrown chin.
His hair was red, his eyes were black,
His breath smelled strong of apple-jack.
He had a horse, he had a dog,
He had a cat and cow,
And finally had a little wife, with whom
He'd often row.
The sun's bright beams he'd dodge,
He loved the moonlight chill,
For even down, within the ground,
He had his moonshine still.
Sincerely yours,
Wotta Blank, '23.

Basket Team Defeats Cage Five
Hog Wallow Institute of Technograpy today defeated
the Pink Sweater team of Phoenix by a score of 0-0.
The game was close, the referee making many of the
baskets from the sidelines.
The last half was rough, being merely a continuation
of the general fight commenced at the first of the
game. One of the prettiest shots of the game was that
made by the Phoenix coach with a forty-four from the
bench. He dropped the opposing center with one
cartridge.
Captain D. Feat of the Pink Sweaters hurt his head
during the game; the referee also slipped and fell on
his, but no damage being done; the game then con
tinued. —Clipped from the Phoenix Journal.
