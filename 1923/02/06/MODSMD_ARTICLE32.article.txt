## TROJANS DEFEAT CALIFORNIA BEARS 
### 
Southern California's basketball
quintet defeated the University of
California team by a score of 24 to 21
in the Harmon gymnasium last night.
The result of the game was in doubt
until the final minute of play, but the
Trojans led for the greater part of the
contest.
The Bear attack seemed to be dis
organized by the offense offered by the
Southerners. The California passing
lacked accuracy while the Trojans
made every toss count.
The score at the end of the first half
was 11 to 11.
With the score standing at 21 to 20
against them and only a little more
than a minute left, Campbell and Bone
each threw goals and the game was on
ice for U. S. C.
Talt. and Thompson were the only
two units of the California team who
functioned properly, Bone and Camp
bell starred for the Trojans.
U. S. C. and California were even up
on the series played in the south over
a week ago and this gives the Trojans
a lead on the scheduled four-game
series with the Bears.
