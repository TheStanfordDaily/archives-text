# TOURNEY TO DECIDE MEN TO WRESTLE AND BOX FOR CARDINALS
## 
### 
Now that the Davis Farm boxing and
wrestling tourney is over, all boxing
and wrestling aspirants are working out
in preparation for the eliminations
which will be held in a few weeks to
determine the men to represent Stanford
on the mat and in the ring this season.
Instead of picking a team directly,
Coach Harry Maloney will hold a
tournament, much like the interclass af
fair of last quarter, in which a course
of elimination will be followed and the
winners in each weight in the tourney
will be named on the varsity team.
The Cardinals meet Davis Farm in a
return match on March 1 in the gym
nasium. This meet will be followed by
the tangle with California, which will
take place March 9. Maloney expects
to have the tourney decide the team prior
to the Davis Farm meet, but it is pos
sible that the same men will participate
in the return match that went to Davis
last month. As there are still
weeks before the return match no
strenuous work is being done.
Last Friday night some of the mem
bers of the boxing, wrestling, and fenc
ing classes put on an exhibition at a
smoker in Palo Alto, held by the Im
provement Order of Redman, a fraternal
order.
