# Managerial Positions Are Now Open on D.P.A. Staff
## 
### 
Applications for positions on the mana
gerial staff of the Daily Palo Alto will
he received between 12:45 and 2 o'clock
Wednesday, February 7, at the Press
Building by William R. Gage, manager.
A place on the managerial staff affords
opportunity for a sophomore or fresh
man to participate in an important activ
ity, and at the same time to gain prac
tical business experience.
The advertising staff has two func
tions. There are men who do merchandis
ing work, that is, study the local market,
and the merchants' commodities, and then
prepare advertising copy, which is sold
by a group of space salesmen. The mer
chandising service is a comparatively new
function for college papers, but is an
established department on the metropoli
tan dailies.
Positions on either branch of the staff
are open to underclassmen. Those who
have had prep school experience or who
are going into this type of work should
try out now in order to be in line for pro
motions at the end of the year.
