## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA. —No more physical haz
ing of freshmen is to be permitted at the
University of Southern California accord
ing to a recent faculty decision of the
institution. The immediate cause of this
action was when P. A. Banks, a fresh
man in the College of Pharmacy, fired a
pistol at Philip Johnston, engineering
junior, when the latter attempted to take
him into custody along with the other
freshmen of the. University. January 17
was "Traditions Day" at U. S. C. and
upperclassmen and sophomores united to
seize every freshman appearing on the
campus.
The yearlings were forced to don track
sir'ts in the training quarters and then roll
in the mud of the athletic field while the
upperclassmen sprinkled them with a fire
hose. Banks threatened to shoot the man
that touched him, and when Johnston
tripped him up he made good. The bullet
lodged in Johnston's toe.
Officers from the University Police
Station took Banks to jail, where he later
received a two-day sentence on the charge
of assault with a deadly weapon. John
ston was taken to the receiving hospital,
but his injury was not serious.
The faculty committee summarily dis
charged the underclassman, but decided
also that no physical violence would be
permitted in future "hazing" of Trojan
freshmen.
