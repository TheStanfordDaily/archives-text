Plans for the automobile show in
San Francisco, and the accompanying
display of "old-timers," brings to mind
some of the rules of the road in vogue
twenty-five years ago.
The type of ordinances framed by
big cities in 1898, covering the regula
tion of automobiles, included:
Speed limit is eight miles an hour.
An alarm bell must be carried on
each car.
Cars must have brakes that will stop
the machine within ten feet.
"Automobiler" was the official term
given to the motorist.
Some of the early automobiles had
three control levers. There was one

"to steer with," one "to go fast," and
the third "to stop short." Usually
when the driver was called on to act
quickly he pulled the wrong lever.
