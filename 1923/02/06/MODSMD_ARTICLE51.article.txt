# Farmers Lose on Horse Feed, But Nevertheless Will Buy Automobiles
## 
### 
The statistician has it that because of
the use of automobiles, trucks and trac
tors, which have largely supplanted the
use of horses, American farmers are
losing approximately $30,000,000 a year
on horse feed,
D< spite this, the United States Bureau
!of Commerce reports that the farmers
will have about $2,000,000,000 more from
I their crops this year than they did last
year. It is not to be concluded, of
course, that all this money will be spent
for commodities. Much of it will be
used to pay off debts contracted during
the past two years. The farmers, how-
I ever, have not bought automobiles for
about three years, and manufacturers
are preparing to meet the demand from
| them.
Motor trucks especially are usfed to
great extent in some farming regions.
According to figures of the Bureau of
Census, more motor trucks are used on
the farms in the Northwest Central
states than any other section of the
county. The Dakotas, lowa, Missouri,
Kansas, and Nebraska alone have 33,000
trucks on farms.
