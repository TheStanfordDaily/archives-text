# PHI DELIA THETA OVERCOMES LEAD AND TAKES GAME
## El Tigre Trims Theta Delta Chi, Phi Kappa Psi Beats Kappa Sigma in League 3 
### 
Phi Delta Theta came from behind j
and won 15-8 from Alpha Kappa
Lambda last night in a game marked
by many futile attempts to poke the
ball through the hoop. Phi Kappa t'si
won from Kappa Sigma 13-3, El Tigre
took their contest from Theta Delta
Chi 10-3, and Delta Upsilon defeated
Sequoia Hall, first floor, team 12-2, in
I the remaining contests of the day.
O'Hara Cages Four Shots
In the first half of the Phi Delta
Theta-Alpha Kappa Lambda contest,
little real basketball was exhibited and
neither team made even a fair per
centage of the open shots they had at
the basket. At half time Phi Delta
Theta was trailing 6-4, but at the be
ginning of the final period, Paul
O'Hara got his eye on the hoop and
caged four pretty shots from the floor,
one after another, his last one being a
fancy one-hand shot over his head
from the foul line. With such shooting, 1
■the Alpha Kappa Lambda players were
unable to keep up and although they
had several openings for shots failed I
to tally once during the last half.
Paul O'Hara was by far the best
player, covering the floor well, fight
nig hard for the ball, and covering his
man constantly, besides looping some
clever shots through the hoop. Logan
also helped Phi Delta Theta turn ap
parent defeat into victory with his
floor work which was fast enough to
enable him to get the ball away from
Alpha Kappa Lambda at times when
they might have tallied. Sloan showed
the most form for Alpha Kappa
Lambda, guarding his basket carefully j
besides making two field goals.
Butterfield Shoots Well
Butterfield again shot El Tigre
through to a victory, this time over
Theta Delta Chi, when he made three
goals from the floor and scored a free
throw. His fast passing and clever
dribbling from his guard position
down to the basket gave him frequent
openings for shots and his accurate
shooting enabled him to take advan
tage of the opportunities. El Tigre
was far superior to Theta Delta Chi
and won easily in spite of the fact that;
the score was only 3-0i in their favor
at half time. The El Tigre teamwork
was too much for the Theta Delta Chi
guards and Barham was the only man
to put up much of a defense. His shoot
ing accounted for the only field goal
and the only free throw made by Theta
Delta Chi.
Phi Psi, El Tigre, in Tie
Phi Kappa Psi by winning 13-3 from
Kappa Sigma remains tied with El
Tigre for first place in League 3 and
will have to play off an extra game :
after this week in order to decide the
winner. Wittenburg was responsible
for most of Phi Kappa Psi's points, j
