# NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S HANDWRITING GHOST NEVER TRIED THIS
## 
### 
The handwriting on the wall has
now gone out of vogue, but signatures
can still be made to endure as long
as a book's binding holds together,
without any danger of the ink fading.
This is the plan now being carried
out in reproducing, for the special
Junior edition of the 1924 Quad, the
signatures of every *24 man or woman
who has signed up for the class edi
tion of the year-book. Special ink,
pens, and paper are provided at the
A. S. S. U. office, upstairs in the
Administration building, so that each
signature will have the same space to \
flourish in, and the best quality of
reproduction will be assured.
Friday afternoon is the last time at
which those who are eligible to sign
may do so. The roll is open for signing
every afternoon this week, from 1 to 6.
It is urged that all who can do so, sign
tomorrow, in order to avoid the rush <
at the last minute.
