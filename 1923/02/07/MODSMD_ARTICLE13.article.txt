# FIRST CONCERT OF YEAR IS PRESENTED BY SCHUBERT CLUB
## 
### Miriam Hilton, '25 
Professional ease and harmonious
voice blending were distinctive fea
tures in a well-balanced program pre
sented by the Schubert Club and solo
ists before a large audience in the
Little Theater last evening.
In contrast to many amateur chor
uses, the participants reflected the
spirit of the selections and sang most
of the numbers without scores. Direc
tor Latham True is to be congratulated
upon this successful performance. As
sisting artists, Elizabeth Peirce, violin
ist; Kurt von Grundzinski, Russian
baritone, and Mrs. Latham True, read
er, provided three variations in musi
cal presentation which were well re
ceived.
Nevin Played
Of the first three numbers, by the
Schubert Club, one carries away mem- j
ories of the billowy, floating rhythm in
Mendelssohn's "On Music's Wings;"
and of the closing selections, Nevin's
"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod," with
obligato by Mrs. Ruth May Friend, was
rich in tone-harmonies. The blending
soprano and alto voices of the old
Welsh air, "All Through the Night,"
were equally pleasing, while Brahms'
humming lullabye, "The Little Dust
man," was another favorite.
Brahms' Sonata in D minor, Op. 108
—the violin solo by Miss Peirce —was
rendered with a smooth assurance that
made possible a perfect enjoyment of
the music. The adagio movement, in
its quiet temo, was well done, while
the contrast of Miss Peirce's encore
selection from the negro theme, "The
Canebrake," by Samuel Gardner, was
particularly attractive.
Mrs. True Sings
Mr. von Grundski's first three num
bers, "Ave Maria" by Luzzi, Schubert's
"Die Stadt," and "Why?" by Tschai
kowsky (the latter sung in Russian)
were a change to a more serious mood.
