last night by defeating Alpha Tau

tured first honors in League 5 by win
ning from Chi Psi 10-7. Sigma Chi
took a game from Tlieta Chi, 12-8,
thereby giving Theta Chi their first
defeat of the tournament and winning
the championship of League fi. Zeta
Psi won their first league contest when
they won from El Capitan 26-13 and
broke the tie for cellar position in
League 4. Sigma Nu forfeited to Phi
Kappa Sigma.
Delta Chi Wins But Fails
To Show Championship Form
Delta Chi failed to show much cham
pionship form and was pushed hard
in putting the game and the league
title on ice. In spite of the fact that
the score stood 5-1 at the end of the
half in their favor, the game was not
definitely decided until the last min
utes of play when Tritle and Suffern
each caged a shot from the floor.
Alpha Tau Omega deserved a larger
score but a run of bad luck on shots
prevented it. Suffern and Tritle car
ried the ball down the floor for Delta
Chi and tossed it through the hoop
from all angles, getting all the breaks
on fancy shots. Neill outplayed any of
his opponents, covering the floor with
speed and apparent ease. His hard
playing and clever dribbling kept the
Delta Chi score down.
Mixon and Hays Compete for
Honors From Foul Line
Delta Tau Delta ad Chi Psi dis
played some of the fastest basketball
yet shown in the tournament. Clever
passing and still more clever guard
ing kept the Delta Tau Delta players
in the lead. Numerous fouls were
called and Mixon and Hays competed
Mixon did the stellar work for Delta

Tau Delta, being resposnible for five of
his team's ten points. The Hays broth-
ers played good games for Chi Psi but
were unable to sink their long shots
from the middle of the floor. After the
half nearly all of the shots by both
teams were long ones.
Shaw Is Material Aid
In Sigma Chi Win
Sigma Chi won a hard game from
Theta Chi 12-8 by displaying a superior
passing game and greater ability in
handling the ball. Cleaveland made
three baskets for Sigma Chi but his
long shots in the second half spoiled
several chances for his team which
might have increased the score had
he resorted to passing.
Shaw was the outstanding star. His
fast floor work, his quick handling of
the ball and clever dribbling were im
' port ant factors in the Sigma Chi at
tack. Parker, who followed up Shaw's
shots at the basket, made two goals.
Hollingsworth was the best individual
player on the Theta Chi team.
Solomon Fights Hard and
Brings Victory to Zeta Psi
Zeta Psi won their first league game
last night when they moved out of
the cellar position by defeating El
Capitan which dropped to last place
as a result. Solomon kept up his hard
fighting game and worked his way to
the basket where he caged four field
goals. Hazeltine tallied twice and
paired off well with Solomon on the
forward line. White was the whole
I scoring machine for El Capitan, mak
ing four goals during the contest. With
â€¢ better guarding to hold down the op
position, White would have made a
formidable score but Gage and Evans
were no match for Solomon who
broke through them with ease.
