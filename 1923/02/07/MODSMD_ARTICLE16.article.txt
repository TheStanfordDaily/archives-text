## 
### 
Students and faculty in classes in
Jordan Hall were startled one after
noon recently by resounding footsteps
like unto those of a mighty army
charging across the tile flooring. In
vestigation proved, however, that it
was none other than the class in Ele
mentary Botany which, upon hearing
that a real live snake was in the Zo
ology laboratory, rose with one accord
and dashed frantically to see the ani
mal. But, be it known, the snake's
days were numbered; already were the
Zoology students whetting their mur
derous weapons.
