# STANFORD DIAMOND NINE CLASHES WITH OAKLANDERS TODAY
## 
### 
{ Stanford's baseball nine is sched
uled to clash with the Ambrose Tailor
j professional aggregation from Oakland
on the varsity field this afternoon at
' 3 o'clock. Jim Aydelott, a twirler from
the babe squad last year, is to take
i the mound for the Cards with A1
jHuneke on the receiving end.
The main cog of the professional
line-up is a fellow named Koliler, who
is considered by baseball authorities
l to be one of the best catchers in the
! Pacific Coast League. Along with him
are four other Coast League players
and a team which looks mighty dan
gerous. The Tailors have been partici
pating in the Tribune League of the
East Bay Region this season with
great success, their play being fast and
consistent.
Jeffersons Give Hope
The varsity showed its stuff in the
first game of the preliminary season
last Saturday when it sent the Jeffer
son Club of San Francisco back to the
Foggy City on the short end of a top
heavy 13-3 score. The result was a
big surprise. It proved that Stanford
can really hit —something which had
been undecided before.
If the Cards play the same consist
ent ball in the field as they did against
the clubmen, and they were able to
fathom the ins-and-outs of professional
heaving, another win might be chalked
up today. The men want to upset an
old Stanford tradition this year by
going through the season with a clean
| slate. The Ambrose Tailor game this
afternoon —the second of the season —
j is one of those crucial contests.
