# CARDS CARRY FIGHT INTO TROJAN COURT; TEN LEAVE TONIGHT
## Dope Points to Victory for Stanford; Can Split Series And Still Cinch Gonfalon 
### 
Tonight, Andy Kerr and a squad of
ten Cardinal basketball players will
leave for Los Angeles for a return
series with the University of Southern
California. The results of this series
will have quite a bearing upon the
standing of the southern half of tho
Pacific Coast Conference.
With California being able to only
divide their series with the Trojans,
dopesters have taken quite a different
aspect upon coming games. At the
time, Stanford has a big advantage
over the Blue and Gold in the fact that,
she can split the series with both
U. S. C. and California and still be
southern champions. If the Cardinals
take both of the games from the Tro
jans this week, they only have to win
one of their four games from the
Bruins in order to come out on top in
the final rating.
Trojans Stronger at Home
With the Trojans playing on their
own floor, Kerr's Varsity has two hard
games ahead of them Friday and Sat
urday. However, the U. S. C. squad has
had a tough schedule this year and
will have had only two days' rest be
tween the four northern games just
completed, which should be to the
Cardinals' advantage.
Last night, Kerr gave his first string
players a rest and tonight they will
be put through a light scrimmage be
fore taking the train south so they
should be in the best of shape. Kerr
was very lucky in the last series as
all of the players with the exception
of Harry Shipkey came through both
games with hardly a scratch. Shipkey,
who broke his nose during the first
few minutes he was in last Friday's,
game, is wearing a nose guard in prac
tice and will be in shape to make the
trip south.
DeGroot to Be in Shape
Dud DeGroot is getting into shape
in short order and although he wilL
have a hard time in displacing Oliva.
at standing guard, is a valuable man
to have on the bench. It is quite likely
that Kerr will use him to a good ad
vantage in the Trojan series due to
i his weight.
In the first game Friday, the regular
five of McHose and Rogers at forward,
Janssen at center, and Oliva and An
i derson at guards, will be sent iu
| against the U. S C. five. For reserves,
i Kerr will have along Steele. Shipkey,
Hooper, DeGroot, ano Austin.

games with hardly a scratch. Shipkey,
who broke his nose during the first
few minutes he was in last Friday's,
game, is wearing a nose guard in prac
tice and will be in shape to make the
trip south.
DeGroot to Be in Shape
Dud DeGroot is getting into shape
in short order and although he wilL
have a hard time in displacing Oliva.

to have on the bench. It is quite likely
that Kerr will use him to a good ad
vantage in the Trojan series due to
i his weight.
In the first game Friday, the regular
five of McHose and Rogers at forward,
Janssen at center, and Oliva and An

Tonight, Andy Kerr and a squad of
ten Cardinal basketball players will
leave for Los Angeles for a return
series with the University of Southern
California. The results of this series
will have quite a bearing upon the
standing of the southern half of tho
Pacific Coast Conference.
With California being able to only
divide their series with the Trojans,
dopesters have taken quite a different
aspect upon coming games. At the
time, Stanford has a big advantage
over the Blue and Gold in the fact that,
she can split the series with both
U. S. C. and California and still be
southern champions. If the Cardinals
take both of the games from the Tro
jans this week, they only have to win
one of their four games from the
Bruins in order to come out on top in
the final rating.
Trojans Stronger at Home
With the Trojans playing on their
own floor, Kerr's Varsity has two hard
games ahead of them Friday and Sat
urday. However, the U. S. C. squad has
had a tough schedule this year and
will have had only two days' rest be
tween the four northern games just
completed, which should be to the
Cardinals' advantage.
Last night, Kerr gave his first string
players a rest and tonight they will
be put through a light scrimmage be
fore taking the train south so they
should be in the best of shape. Kerr
was very lucky in the last series as
all of the players with the exception
of Harry Shipkey came through both
games with hardly a scratch. Shipkey,
who broke his nose during the first
few minutes he was in last Friday's,
game, is wearing a nose guard in prac
tice and will be in shape to make the
trip south.
