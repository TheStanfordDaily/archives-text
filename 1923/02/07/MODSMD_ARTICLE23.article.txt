# CARD FENCERS TO MEET CALIFORNIA MARCH 16
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney has secured
the postponement of the fencing bouts
between Stanford and California from
March 1 to March 16. He pointed
out that after the Stanford-California
soccer game on February 22, he
would concentrate on the thirty-five
or forty fencers, from whom he would
ultimately select his team. Sandretto,
Gardiner, Richardson, and Aguerre
vere are the outstanding fencers hut
others have also shown up well. The
class will continue its intensive drill
until after February 22 when the
elimination bouts to determine the
Stanford team will begin.
