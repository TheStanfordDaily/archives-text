# THE 						NEXT EDITOR
## 
### 
Kenneth N. Stewart becomes today editor-elect
of the Daily Palo Alto. He has been a member of
the staff for three years and is now the ranking
member in seniority, position, and ability. Stewart
has occupied every position on the editorial staff and
is thoroughly acquainted with the organization of
all departments. Because of his familiarity with the
news field, he should set a standard hard to equal.
The editor-elect has kept in close touch with
lUniversity problems and will be in a position because
of his first-hand knowledge to treat all matters of
general interest editorially. He has made a close
study of subjects of undergraduate interest and will
no doubt give the students views on these matters
that will be a real benefit.
The election today was another example of the
trend of the Daily away from political methods.
Elections for the last two years have been solely on
the merit of candidates. Political affiliations have
meant nothing. If the Daily is to make its proper
progress with a growing student body as its support,
it must continue to keep clear of party manipula
tion. The editor elected solely on his merits should
logically be unhampered in his editorial policy.
The present editorial board will make its final
bow on February 15 on the date of the general mid
year elections. Stewart will then leave his present
position as managing editor to assume his new
responsibility.
