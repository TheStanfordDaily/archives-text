# THE 						POINT SYSTEM
## 
### 
Provision is made in the proposed student body
constitution running in the Daily for the first time
today for the establishment of a point system in
tended to regulate participation in undergraduate
activities. This system has worked with varying
degrees of success in a large number of universities
and if broadly applied should have a beneficial effect
upon student life at Stanford.
The system, briefly, is this. A record is kept of
every student and a check is kept on his extra
curricular activity on this record. For example,
participation in a certain branch of athletics will
count a certain number of i>oints, depending upon
the amount of time expended. Further points will
be added for other work. A definite limit is set 011
the total number of points any one student may be
carrying at a given time.
P>y this means it will be possible to keep individual
students from occupying leading position in two
activities at once, particularly if they are paid posi
tions. It will keep a man from being manager of
one student magazine while he serves as editor of
another. It will keep responsible positions distrib
uted among a larger number of people, thus guaran
teeing better service in the long run and opening up
the field of undergraduate activity to those who are
now crowded out because of the competition of men
who have already put their names before the public.
Tt is essential to the welfare of student activity
that its various branches be supported by as many
of its logical adherents as possible. While students
hold to the opinion that somebody higher up is
running things, the "higher-up" will continue to do
so until a wedge in the shape of the point system
is driven in. When the undergraduate body as a
whole feels that every activity is TTS activity and
not that of a small and self-perpetuating group, the
general atmosphere of student life must certainly
assume a more healthy tinge.
The ixiint system, however, should be taken with
its grain of salt. Tt cannot suddenly be set up in
our midst as if it were a new shoe for the student
body to wear. It must first be tried in its broadest
possible application with all changes to be made
from that point. It should begin in the form of a
germ and gradually work up to its highest point of
efficiency. If the student body adopts this practice,
those who are interested should now begin to give
the matter serious thought.

the amount of time expended. Further points will
be added for other work. A definite limit is set 011
the total number of points any one student may be
carrying at a given time.
P>y this means it will be possible to keep individual
students from occupying leading position in two
activities at once, particularly if they are paid posi
tions. It will keep a man from being manager of
one student magazine while he serves as editor of
another. It will keep responsible positions distrib
uted among a larger number of people, thus guaran
teeing better service in the long run and opening up
the field of undergraduate activity to those who are
now crowded out because of the competition of men
who have already put their names before the public.
Tt is essential to the welfare of student activity
that its various branches be supported by as many
of its logical adherents as possible. While students
hold to the opinion that somebody higher up is
running things, the "higher-up" will continue to do
so until a wedge in the shape of the point system
is driven in. When the undergraduate body as a
whole feels that every activity is TTS activity and
not that of a small and self-perpetuating group, the
general atmosphere of student life must certainly
assume a more healthy tinge.
The ixiint system, however, should be taken with
its grain of salt. Tt cannot suddenly be set up in
our midst as if it were a new shoe for the student
body to wear. It must first be tried in its broadest
possible application with all changes to be made
from that point. It should begin in the form of a
germ and gradually work up to its highest point of
efficiency. If the student body adopts this practice,
those who are interested should now begin to give
the matter serious thought.
