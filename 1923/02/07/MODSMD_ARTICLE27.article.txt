Reg: Roughly speaking, how many are registered at
the University of California?
Yegg: Cripes, dey got one hell of a mob over dere.
And the drinks were 011 Aunt Agatha.

Now, Fantazius Mallare, you are doubtless aware
That your name's being bandied about;
The types you parade in your opening tirade
Are taken from life, without doubt.
But oh, Mr. Hecht, don't you think I'm correct
When I say that you're just a bit crude?
For the words you employ may offend the "polloi"
If they chance to be wrongly construed.

There was a man in our town
And he was wondrous wise
But gosh, he was a goofy bird,
A pest without disguise.
There were some men in our town
Who knew not half so much
And they all thought this wise old skate
Was funny as a crutch.
That's usually the way of men
We always hate to see
A duke who's favored by the gods
And knows much more than we.

PROFESSIONAL JEALOUSY
Among those who contribute I wish to distribute
Three rousing and vigorous cheers
Your efforts are splendid; our knees they are bended
But why not be funny, my dears?
Homer Cayenne, '26.

The response to the invitation of H. M., '24, Cabbage
mechanic-general, has gladdened the hearts of those
most intimately concerned. Two hundred and fifty
pounds of material were taken to the Daily Palo Alto
Times after Cabbages had satisfied its screaming needs.
In order to acknowledge the efforts of the most profuse
contributors, Cabbages prints the following table of
contributions by living groups:
