Hopes for a winning crew were
lessened today with the announcement
that unless conditions are changed at
Redwood, workouts for the varsity and
freshman crews can be held but two
weeks out of every month. During the
summer dredges were at work on the
bay and as a result mud has been
pushed back into the Redwood estuary
to such an extent that when the tide
is low there is no water for the shells.

Herbert Hoover, '95, chairman of
the American Commission for the Re
lief of Belgium, gave his first public
address in the United States since
hostilities broke out in Europe, before
the State Chamber of Commerce in
New York Monday. He urged that
America do its share in providing
$6,000,000 a month to be used in aiding
the helpless Belgians.
* * •
Exercise books to take the place of
the regular Stanford "Blue Book"
which has been used in several class
es,, have been secured and are now
on sale at the Bookstore. They are the
same size as the examination book —
twenty-two pages—but are brown in
stead of blue.
