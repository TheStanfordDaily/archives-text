## OREGON DEAN DEPLORES SERFDOM OF STUDENTS 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGONâ€”The
high mortality rate of students as a
result of over-organization is deplored
by Dean Colin V. Dyment in a com
munication to the Oregon "Emerald."
Dean Dyment says that most of the
students are mere serfs, under abso
lute bondage of a system over which
they have no control from breakfast
until 11 p.m. No time is left for "schol
arly pursuits" and about 13 per cent
of the total are forced to leave school.
