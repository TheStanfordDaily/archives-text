# STANFORD PEACOCKS NOT DISTURBED BY SNOWY ATMOSPHERE
## 
### 
Cold winter nights don't bother a
peacock. According to employes of the
Stanford Nursery even on the frostiest
evenings the Stanford peacock refuses
to accept the shelter of a barn, but
prefers a perch on the limb of a tall
gum tree.
There are eight peacocks living
about the nursery and cactus gardens.
Eight years ago they were brought
here from one of the Stanford estates
near Sacramento. Since then they have
eked a living from gardens and occa
sionally have succeeded in raising a
few young ones.
Several of the birds have been seized
and deprived of their feathers, but
this has not happened often because of
the ability of the peacock to rise
quickly from the ground and elude his
pursuers.
