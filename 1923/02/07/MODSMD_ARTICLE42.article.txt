# W.A.A. PREPARES FOR MEETING OF WESTERN SECTION NEXT APRIL
## 
### 
Plans for the program for the April
conference of the Western Section of
the Women's Athletic Association,
which will be held at Stanford, were
outlined by the W. A. A. Board at a
meeting last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
The April convention will prepare
the Western Section for the national
W. A. A. conference that will take
place next year at the University of
California.
Formal papers will be read and a
round-table discussion held at the busi
ness meetings of the spring confer
ence. There will be reports on the
standardization of swimming*, events
and interclass-intercollegiate competi
tion.
The W. A. A. Board voted against
giving a pageant this spring under the
direction of Cap and Gown. According
to the opinions expressed by the mem
bers of the Board, the pageant was
started as a W. A. A. activity, the
Women's Physical Education Depart
ment had not planned this year's pro
gram so that it would be able to direct
a pageant, and a spring fete is too
big an enterprise to attempt every
year.
W. A. A. Board decided that in the
future four women must go on the
week-end hikes in order to give the
hikers points toward the block "S"
sweaters. The women who went on
the past week-end hikes, when there
were less than four women, will be
given W. A. A. points regardless of the
new ruling.
