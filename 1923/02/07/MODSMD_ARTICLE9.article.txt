# BABE PRELIMINARY SEASON ENDS WITH TONIGHT'S CONTEST
## 
### 
San Mateo High School is scheduled
to meet the 1926 court quintet tonight
at 7:30 in the Pavilion, in the babes'
last preliminary game before the second
tilt with the Bruin Cubs Saturday night.
Hunt has been putting his team
through some hard work-outs this week
and tonight's game will be the last
chance Cardinal rooters will have to
see the yearlings in action before the
second battle with Nibs Price's aggrega
tion. The freshmen scrimmaged the 145-
pound team last night and did not make
a very crcditable showing.
Substitutes Weak
The babes' main weakness lies in their
lack of capable substitutes. The only
position where Hunt can make a change
during a game without weakening his
machine is at center. Carter and Mor
rison have both been playing good bas
ketball and neither has much of an edge
on the position. With either Nevers or
Frazier out of the running, the scoring
combination amounts to practically noth
ing. Nevers' floor work and Frazier's
shooting have been large factors in the
teamwork. Barnett, Peery, and Frank
have showed flashes of good basketball,
but none of them fits into the machine
like the two regular forwards.
Harris Only Guard Sub
With the big fellow. Harris, out of the
running on account of a bad knee, there
are no substitutes for the defensive posi
tions. McDermont has been taking care
of all the work at the standing guard
job. while "Mugs" Mitchell has had
things all his own way at the running
guard position. These two men are hard
fighters, but both lack the experience to
keep a fast forward from getting past
them.
Carter went to the hospital last night
with an injured toe, which will probably
keep him out of the game tonight. He
will be in shape for the game Saturday
night. Nevers and Mitchell are both suf
fering from slight colds, but will be
ready to start tonight.
With Carter out, Morrison will un
doubtedly start at center, with Frazier
and Nevers at the forward posts. Mitch
ell and McDermont, at guards, will
round out the team.
