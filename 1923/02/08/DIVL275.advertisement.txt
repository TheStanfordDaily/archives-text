Somewhere Lives a Man
I Am Looking For and He
Is Looking For Me
I want a man who worked his
way through college by selling
books, aluminum ware, brushes,
bonds, maps, views or other spe
cialties; a clean-cut, congenial
fellow who has been trained in
the science and art of selling
merchandise direct to the con
sumer; has had experience in
hiring and training college men
to sell specialties; has made a
record; a worker who believes in
knowing his merchandise; a man
who has made and saved money;
a man who has ambition backed
up by a burning desire and a
willingness to pay the price of
success; where the reward is
only limited by the limitations of
the man himself. If you are the
man. write me a personal letter,
giving me full details of your
past experience and tell me why
you think you are the right man.
