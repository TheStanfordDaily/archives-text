# EL CAMPO LOSES LEAGUE TITLE TO S.A.E. QUINTET
## Los Arcos Trims El Toro in Easy Contest; Alpha Sigma Phi and Sequoia Victors 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon defeated El
Campo 11-8 last night in one of the
fastest of the intramural games yet
played and thereby won the title to
League 2. Alpha Sigma Phi won from
Kappa Alpha 6-2; Sequoia Hall, sec
ond floor, took their game from En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 24-13, and Los
Arcos easily trimmed El Toro 30-13,
in the other games played yesterday.
El Campo went into the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon contest determined to
win and thus draw their opponents

their league. Mathews opened the
game with a clean shot after a pretty
dribble through both of the El Campo
guards, but Hobro followed suit for
El Campo and Penepacker and Ho
sepian both tallied before the half,
giving their team a 6-3 lead. A shot
by Gibbons and another by Teague
in the middle of the final period put
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon players
ahead. The scoring ended with another
shot by Teague, the El Campo for
wards failing to register once during
the last half. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
far from top-notch form and El Campo
outplayed them on the floor except for
a few minutes in the middle of the
second period. Gibbon did not take
the active and useful part in the game
he did in previous contests.
Mathews and Teague worked at for
ward well and broke through time and
again but failed to score oftener by
the barest margins. Strong played his
guard position with ability and took
the ball off the backboard with sure
ness and ease. Hobro was the out
standing man on the El Campo team.
His dribbling and fast floor work kept
the ball in motion and if Penepacker
had passed the ball instead of taking
long shots the pair might have rolled
up a larger score. Steinburg covered
the opposing forwards well and with
one or two exceptions prevented any
open shots.
Los Arcos met little or no opposition
in trimming El Toro. The team worked
