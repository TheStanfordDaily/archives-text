# EL CAMPO LOSES LEAGUE TITLE TO S.A.E. QUINTET
## Los Arcos Trims El Toro in Easy Contest; Alpha Sigma Phi and Sequoia Victors 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon defeated El
Campo 11-8 last night in one of the
fastest of the intramural games yet
played and thereby won the title to
League 2. Alpha Sigma Phi won from
Kappa Alpha 6-2; Sequoia Hall, sec
ond floor, took their game from En
cina Hall, fifth floor, 24-13, and Los
Arcos easily trimmed El Toro 30-13,
in the other games played yesterday.
El Campo went into the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon contest determined to
win and thus draw their opponents
into a triple tie for first place in
their league. Mathews opened the
game with a clean shot after a pretty
dribble through both of the El Campo
guards, but Hobro followed suit for
El Campo and Penepacker and Ho
sepian both tallied before the half,
giving their team a 6-3 lead. A shot
by Gibbons and another by Teague
in the middle of the final period put
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon players
ahead. The scoring ended with another
shot by Teague, the El Campo for
wards failing to register once during
the last half. Sigma Alpha Epsilon was
far from top-notch form and El Campo
outplayed them on the floor except for
a few minutes in the middle of the
second period. Gibbon did not take
the active and useful part in the game
he did in previous contests.
Mathews and Teague worked at for
ward well and broke through time and
again but failed to score oftener by
the barest margins. Strong played his
guard position with ability and took
the ball off the backboard with sure
ness and ease. Hobro was the out
standing man on the El Campo team.
His dribbling and fast floor work kept
the ball in motion and if Penepacker
had passed the ball instead of taking
long shots the pair might have rolled
up a larger score. Steinburg covered
the opposing forwards well and with
one or two exceptions prevented any
open shots.
Los Arcos met little or no opposition
in trimming El Toro. The team worked
with the same speed and precision
shown in previous games, the same
ability which threatened to defeat
Sigma Chi last week. Hamilton was
high scorer with sixteen points to his
credit, Blacker following with ten.
Hamilton's work at forward was fast
and accurate and his weight and
strength gave him power to break
through his opponents' defense and
get under the basket. Clifford led El
Toro in scoring with seven points, his
floor work enabling him to get free
from his opponent for shots.
Sequoia Hall, second floor, took a
ragged contest from Encina Hall, fifth
floor, 24-13. Brown continued his clever
basket shooting and registered six tal
lies from the floor. Morrison scored
three times. The pair were responsi
ble for all the real basketball dis
played by Sequoia, keeping up a much
faster passing game than their team
mates. Middleton, playing forward for
Encina, furnished all the opposition
Sequoia met. His hard fighting and
general speed kept the ball away from
his own basket and enabled him to
tally five times.
Alpha Sigma Phi won their first
tournament contest from Kappa Alpha
last night by a score of 6-2. The game
was slow, only one basket being
scored in the whole first half and that
credited to Kappa Alpha. Alpha Sigma
Phi showed some signs of life in the
second half and tallied from the floor
twice, Campbell getting one basket
and Lewis another. Beeson and Mow
ers were so well watched by Alpha
Sigma Phi guards that they failed to
score.
