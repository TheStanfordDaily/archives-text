# IN MEMORIAM

"Died, this thirty-first day of January, nineteen
hundred and twenty-three in the year of our Lord,
Freshman Discipline. Here lies the bones of this
child of Tradition, mourned for its worth by its
parents. Rest in pieces."
This inscription may be carved on the scroll at the
head of a figurative tombstone to be erected at the
head of the grave of an enemy killed in action.
iFreshman Discipline is dead. Enamoured of a life
of action, his restless impulses carried him to dan
gerous fields and there 011 the battleground the old
warrior who has served his time and other people's
purposes died with his boots on.
Tt is the custom of civilized people to speak with
respect of the dead. All the good that was ever
attributed to a person who has passed 011 accom
panies his soul up or down in the form of oral
music. Kindly words are spoken in hushed whis
pers. But this old warrior, grim, unrelenting, and a
believer in the proposition that "Might makes right"
has left word with his only friend that he is not to
be mourned. He has passed on and that is an end to
him.
It is well that he adopted such a policy. It would
be difficult indeed to speak kindly words of one who
has wrought untold havoc with the mailed fist where
he might have worn gloves; of one who has de
manded the most and has given the least; of one
who has for years defeated the very purposes of the
institution which gave him birth and nourished him
through life. Freshman Discipline is dead, never to
return. May the tears shed over his grave wash his
sins awav.
