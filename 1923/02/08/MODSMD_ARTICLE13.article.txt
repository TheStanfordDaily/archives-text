The majority of the sophomore class now backs
the proposal to get at the freshman problem in a
new and saner way. In assuming this attitude
the second-year men have shouldered a real respon
sibility which can reflect nothing but credit upon
them. They are starting out upon a basis which has
within the last twenty-four hours had its effective
ness demonstrated. They have received the full force
of an old but overlooked principle in its broadest
aspect. In the few hours which elapsed between the
signing of the two documents and in the few min
utes of the climax at the last meeting, both the
sophomores and their one-time accuser received a
liberal education. It was worth-while.
Out of respect to the dead, as indicated in the
leading editorial, this final indictment is made of
freshman discipline as one of the last words on that
subject for the present. The following sums up the
chief {Kiints which officially damned it long ago:
It strips its victims of initiative and individuality,
thus working at cross purposes with the ideals of the
University. It is not in keeping with the democratic
spirit of American colleges. It sponsors a belief in
the right of force; creates enemies; embitters and
sours certain types of men; makes tools and fools of
others; it breds revenge and mimicry. It requires a
sacrifice of time and energy which might well be
devoted to something more constructive. It sets up
false standards of excellence by setting a minimum
and maximum on freshmen effort along constructive
lines. It permits of irresponsible hazing by parties
who parade under the guise of "authorized" com
mittees often only to satisfy personal grudges and
dislikes. It is a menace to physical and mental
health. And lastly it is unjust because it gives the
freshman no chance to acquire by friendly means
what he has had in the past to acquire by com
pulsion.
Measures taken these last few days to bring
hazing to an end were not the result of a vengeful
spirit. They were taken dispassionately, without

malice, without personal prejudice. Individuals and
groups entered into the matter only as means to an
end. The timely entrance of a combination of logic
and the personal equation seems to have definitely
settled the matter to the satisfaction of both parties
chiefly interested. All eyes may now be turned to
the substitute and other problems.
