### 
ANOTHER VIEWPOINT DAY
. Editor, Cabbages Column: Heinous Sir: I wish to
protest vigorously against the barbarious treatment fos
tered on the students last night by the publication of
the whole A. S. S. U. constitution. I personally know
five men, honest students, who are now in the Hospital
for the Blind simply because they tried to read the
whole thing through. Sir, this must stop! The first
thing we know, we shall be forced to read the Women's
Council rules and regulations of the Scholarship Com
mittee; and that will be too much.
Are you going to stop this, or will I have to?
Oscar Blumph.

Head, Cabbages.
Dear Head:
Who says this school isn't run by politicians? I don't!
ft is! There is a definite and organized attempt on the
part of some political ring here to stifle the freedom of
independent nomination, and control our alma mater by
crooked means. I refer particularly to the nomination
box placed outside the Romanic Languages building. It
is so small and inadequate that a good guy hasn't got a
chance. I tried to nominate Percival Adelbert McGug
genheimer von Wootzelfeltzer yesterday, and the danged
box was so small I couldn't get the whole nomination in.
If a powerful minority is in this way to be allowed to
override the wishes of the majority, and install them
selves in the throne of power, I, sir, shall leave the
University! That ultimatum is final!
Sinecurely,
Louis McLug.

Dear General:
I don't want to appear cross and ugly, or too particu
ir, but I thought you wouldn't mind publishing this,
and if I'm wrong, I trust someone will let me know. I
am only a freshman, and so yesterday as I was coming
home from an evening with the South Dakota Club
(surely, sir, an innocent enough pursuit!), I was waylaid
by a gang of twenty sophs, who of course "jumped my
frame," as the quaint saying goes, and relieved me of
my watch and spare change. Now I don't object to any
thing like that, for I realize I am only a freshman; but
the ruffians did not stop there! No! They took my
registration card!
Do you realize, sir, what that means Just as I was
going to frame it, too, and Tiang it up in my room above
the picture of my dead uncle, who was also a freshman
once. Without my card, I have no excuse for pulling
trolleys; for .cutting corners; for losing bills (payable);
and a host of other harmless joys that are vouchsafed
to the true college, registered-in-bond undergraduate.
I am wroth. But of course, I know I'm only a freshman,
so if I'm wrong, I hope someone will surely let me know.
Hopefully,
(Unsigned).

Dear Sir:
I see by the papers where the local trolley line may
pull up its tracks. I hereby apply for a job on the
gang that does it. No pecuniary reimbursement re
quired.

five men, honest students, who are now in the Hospital
for the Blind simply because they tried to read the
whole thing through. Sir, this must stop! The first
thing we know, we shall be forced to read the Women's
Council rules and regulations of the Scholarship Com
mittee; and that will be too much.
Are you going to stop this, or will I have to?

Dear Head:
Who says this school isn't run by politicians? I don't!
ft is! There is a definite and organized attempt on the
part of some political ring here to stifle the freedom of
independent nomination, and control our alma mater by
crooked means. I refer particularly to the nomination
box placed outside the Romanic Languages building. It
is so small and inadequate that a good guy hasn't got a
chance. I tried to nominate Percival Adelbert McGug
genheimer von Wootzelfeltzer yesterday, and the danged
box was so small I couldn't get the whole nomination in.
If a powerful minority is in this way to be allowed to
override the wishes of the majority, and install them
selves in the throne of power, I, sir, shall leave the
University! That ultimatum is final!
Sinecurely,
Louis McLug.

Dear General:
I don't want to appear cross and ugly, or too particu
ir, but I thought you wouldn't mind publishing this,
and if I'm wrong, I trust someone will let me know. I
am only a freshman, and so yesterday as I was coming
home from an evening with the South Dakota Club
(surely, sir, an innocent enough pursuit!), I was waylaid
by a gang of twenty sophs, who of course "jumped my
frame," as the quaint saying goes, and relieved me of
my watch and spare change. Now I don't object to any
thing like that, for I realize I am only a freshman; but
the ruffians did not stop there! No! They took my
registration card!
Do you realize, sir, what that means Just as I was
going to frame it, too, and Tiang it up in my room above
the picture of my dead uncle, who was also a freshman
once. Without my card, I have no excuse for pulling
trolleys; for .cutting corners; for losing bills (payable);
and a host of other harmless joys that are vouchsafed
to the true college, registered-in-bond undergraduate.
I am wroth. But of course, I know I'm only a freshman,
so if I'm wrong, I hope someone will surely let me know.
Hopefully,
(Unsigned).

Dear Sir:
I see by the papers where the local trolley line may
pull up its tracks. I hereby apply for a job on the
gang that does it. No pecuniary reimbursement re
quired.
