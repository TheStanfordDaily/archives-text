Early season predictions as to the suc
cess of a play are mostly merely that
and nothing more, but it is safe to say
that Ram's Head this year is offering
something new in the line of burlesque
to the campus and is going to get away
with it. Most of the inanities of the
usual campus shows are lacking, and in
addition there is a plot to the present
production which does not dwindle out,
but furnishes a meaty basis on which
the show may run.

Futuristic settings are again in order.
There may be some doubt in the mind
of those geologically inclined as to the
validity of the rocks, or, commonly
speaking, stones, which are used in the
first act of "Knightie Knight," yet in
England, maybe, they have stones of
pink, blue, green, and yellow hues; and
besides, what do we care about the color
of the stage bricks as long as they are
artistic? And we may be sure that they
will be that!

The lighting control of the Assembly
Hall stage and auditorium is a novelty to
those who go "behind the scenes" the
first time. A large panel about six feet
square, profusely sprinkled with bare
and vicious-looking switches, controls the
lighting. Above are the dimmers, and
squarely in the center of the board a
telephone to communicate instructions.
Altogether, it is a complicated device,
and rightfully understood by no one but
its manager, Stoddard Atwood.
