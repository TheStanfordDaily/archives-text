# PALO ALTO ART CLUB EXHIBIT OPENS TODAY
## 
### 
After being closed for several months,
while the new $40,000 additions were be
ing completed, the Palo Alto Public Li
brary reopened its doors today. The
construction, which was provided for
by a bond issue last year, adds several
new wings, including one for stacks, an
ornamental court, attractive lighting fea
tures, and interior decoration.
The original section of the library will
contain fiction. The juvenile shelves are
provided for in the new west wing, while
the east wing will contain books for ref
erence and research. Among other ad
ditions are rooms for art exhibitions and
for the Red Cross.
The library will be open until 9 p. m.
for general inspection. Although no
formal program is planned, the librarian
urges that people refrain from borrow
ing books until Friday, and make their
visits solely for the purpose of viewing
the new building.
