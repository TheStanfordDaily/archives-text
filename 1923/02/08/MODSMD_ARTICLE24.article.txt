## 
### 
The Cardinal light-heavyweights are
scheduled to clash with the fast U. C.
145-pound team in the Pavilion tomor
row night to decide the winner of the
1923 series. The game will start prompt
ly at 8 o'clock after the 130-pound con
test.
California has an edge on the Stan
ford five if the first game between the |
two which the Cards lost, 23 to 16, lias!
any bearing on the matter. The Stan
ford squad has been practicing faith
fully during the intervening two weeks
under the supervision of Coach "Husky"
Hunt, however, and have shown decided
improvement in the defense. They lack!
a smooth-working offense, depending too i
much on the work of individual playcs.
Steffan and Cornell have been the ir
dividual stars this season, outplaying
their teammates in every game. They
function together well, and should provt I
a stumbling block for the Bear aggre- :
gation if their form is at all up to
standard.
California has a quintet composed of
four veteraps from last year's team.
They have been practicing regularly
from the beginning of the season, and in I
this respect they have the advantage over
the Cards, whose practice has been little
until recently. A trip to Los Angeles
and Fresno gave the Bruins a schedule;
of games in which they proved victorious
with the exception of the contest ivith
Fresno State College.
