# Ram's Head Rehearsals Take on Businesslike Atmosphere by Degrees
## 
### 
Rehearsal for "Knightic Knight," the
Ram's Head production, which will flare
across the boards of the campus stage
on February 16, have assumed a more
connected aspect and a more business
like tone with the start of the week
bcf ore-production.
Not that rehearsals have not been
serious and business-like from the be
ginning, but the addition of a stage set
ting and the fact that the lines and ac
tions are well in hand, lends a sense of
connectedness to the plot that has been
lacking up to now.
Work on act three commenced yester
day, and will be the piece de resistance
for the remainder of the week. Next
week will be devoted to hanging the com
pleted show together in all its component
partsâ€”casts, chorus, and orchestra.
Practice on the songs of the various
leads was also taken up at yesterday's
rehearsal. Predictions as to the success
of songs are mostly futile, but according
to comment of those who have heard
"Just Susie," by Myron Higby, and
"Gone," by Lewis Alabaster, the campus
will have two new tunes that will stick
for some little time.
