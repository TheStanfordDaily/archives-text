# Weekly Informal Track Meet Scheduled Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's track men will hold their
weekly informal meet tomorrow after
noon at 4.
These informal meets are held every
Friday in order to uncover new ma
terial for the varsity, and to give the
track men practice in competition.
All of the regular events are run off,
except that some of the distances are
shortened. The mile is changed into
a 3-lap event and the 2-mile becomes
six laps. A 660-yard and a 350-yard
are run in place of a half mile and a
quarter, and the hurdles are 70 yards
for the highs and 120 yards for the
lows.
