# AMBROSE TAILOR NINE CLEANS VARSITY, 8-4
## 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Ambrose the Tailor, of Oakland,
doesn't play Mali-Jongg. He does play
baseball, though, and he certainly
knows his stuff. So well did his men
do their cleaning and pressing in one
inning yesterday on the varsity field,
that Stanford had nothing else to do
but take the short end of a final 8-4
score, The sixth canto turned into a
big celebration for the Ambrose pro
fessionals, ten men climbing on the
gravy train for five straight trips
around the diamond.
The Oaklanders knew how to use
their sticks to the best possible ad
vantage, for they garnered twelve
timely hits and of this number two
were home runs, three were triples,
and one was a two-base pelt.
The varsity did almost as well, con
necting safely with the horsehide nine
times, but some erratic fielding and
weak'pitching at one stage of the con
test lost the game. Patterson was the
Cards' best batsman, making two
singles and a double in four trips to
the plate. Carver in centerfield dis
tinguished himself by extraordinary
fielding.
Five men on the Tailors' lineup are
signed with the Oakland Coast Leag
uers this season. Kohler, who was said
to have been one" of the best backstops
on the Coast last year, led the vis
itors' attack. On one occasion he se
cured a homer which cleared the
bases.
Jim Aydelott started on the mound
for the varsity and had comparatively
clear sailing until the sixth, when he
struck rough water and was almost
drowned under a deluge of hits and
runs. Teague relieved him and did a
| little better in quelling the Oaklanders'
j batting spree.
Things were all in the varsity's fa
for for the first five innings, the Cardi
nals leading 3-1 and outhitting the Am
brosians seven to two. Stanford's first
score came in the second on singles
by McCandless and Caryer, and a
sacrifice hit by Aydelott. Captain
Peavy got a hit in the third and came
home on Patterson's double into deep
center. Patterson crossed the rubber
himself on an error by the visitors'
catcher. McCandless singled, but died
on second.
Starasinch connected for a double in
the second frame and was forced over
the plate with a run for the Tailors,
when Aydelott temporarily lost con
trol and hit two batsmen, walking a
j third.
But the sixth was when the real
catastrophe occurred. Brubacher was
safe on the keystone bag by fielders'
choice and scored when Bowher
tripled. Starasinch,- with a mean hit
ting eye, singled, and Bowher came
home. Starasinch trotted across the
platter ahead of Kohler, who pushed
the sphere far beyond the head of the
Cardinal center-fielder. McNamara,
heaving for the Tailors, thought he
would also enjoy the festivities, so he
singled and knocked in another run.
That made the score 6-3 for the Am
brosians, and the Cards were rather
dazed when the inning was at.last
over.

Ambrose the Tailor, of Oakland,
doesn't play Mali-Jongg. He does play
baseball, though, and he certainly
knows his stuff. So well did his men
do their cleaning and pressing in one
inning yesterday on the varsity field,
that Stanford had nothing else to do
but take the short end of a final 8-4
score, The sixth canto turned into a
big celebration for the Ambrose pro
fessionals, ten men climbing on the
gravy train for five straight trips
around the diamond.
The Oaklanders knew how to use
their sticks to the best possible ad
vantage, for they garnered twelve
timely hits and of this number two
were home runs, three were triples,
and one was a two-base pelt.
The varsity did almost as well, con
necting safely with the horsehide nine
times, but some erratic fielding and
weak'pitching at one stage of the con
test lost the game. Patterson was the
Cards' best batsman, making two
singles and a double in four trips to
the plate. Carver in centerfield dis
tinguished himself by extraordinary
fielding.
Five men on the Tailors' lineup are
signed with the Oakland Coast Leag
uers this season. Kohler, who was said
to have been one" of the best backstops
on the Coast last year, led the vis
itors' attack. On one occasion he se
cured a homer which cleared the
bases.
Jim Aydelott started on the mound
for the varsity and had comparatively
clear sailing until the sixth, when he
struck rough water and was almost
drowned under a deluge of hits and
runs. Teague relieved him and did a
| little better in quelling the Oaklanders'
j batting spree.
Things were all in the varsity's fa
for for the first five innings, the Cardi
nals leading 3-1 and outhitting the Am
brosians seven to two. Stanford's first
score came in the second on singles
by McCandless and Caryer, and a
sacrifice hit by Aydelott. Captain
Peavy got a hit in the third and came
home on Patterson's double into deep
center. Patterson crossed the rubber
himself on an error by the visitors'
catcher. McCandless singled, but died
on second.
Starasinch connected for a double in
the second frame and was forced over
the plate with a run for the Tailors,
when Aydelott temporarily lost con
trol and hit two batsmen, walking a
j third.
But the sixth was when the real
catastrophe occurred. Brubacher was
safe on the keystone bag by fielders'
choice and scored when Bowher
tripled. Starasinch,- with a mean hit
ting eye, singled, and Bowher came
home. Starasinch trotted across the
platter ahead of Kohler, who pushed
the sphere far beyond the head of the
Cardinal center-fielder. McNamara,
heaving for the Tailors, thought he
would also enjoy the festivities, so he
singled and knocked in another run.
That made the score 6-3 for the Am
brosians, and the Cards were rather
dazed when the inning was at.last
over.
