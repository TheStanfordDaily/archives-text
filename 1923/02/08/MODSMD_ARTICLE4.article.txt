Ambrose the Tailor, of Oakland,
doesn't play Mali-Jongg. He does play
baseball, though, and he certainly
knows his stuff. So well did his men

score, The sixth canto turned into a
big celebration for the Ambrose pro
fessionals, ten men climbing on the
gravy train for five straight trips
around the diamond.
The Oaklanders knew how to use
their sticks to the best possible ad

times, but some erratic fielding and
weak'pitching at one stage of the con
test lost the game. Patterson was the
Cards' best batsman, making two
singles and a double in four trips to
the plate. Carver in centerfield dis
tinguished himself by extraordinary
fielding.
Five men on the Tailors' lineup are
signed with the Oakland Coast Leag
uers this season. Kohler, who was said
to have been one" of the best backstops
on the Coast last year, led the vis

cured a homer which cleared the
bases.
Jim Aydelott started on the mound
for the varsity and had comparatively
clear sailing until the sixth, when he
struck rough water and was almost
drowned under a deluge of hits and
