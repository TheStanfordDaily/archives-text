Led by Captain Wally O'Connor, the
freshman swimming team copped first
honors in the interclass meet yesterday
afternoon when they scored thirty-eight
points, a margin of nine over the juniors,
who came second with twenty-nine.
O'Connor was the star of the day, tak
ing first in the 50-yard and 220-yard
free style events, second in the 66 2-3-
yard backstroke, and helping the fresh
man relay team to take second place in
the relay. O'Connor swam these races
with but little rest between each, and
had he not been so exhausted after the
backstroke, he would have entered the
100-yard free style. This is his first
quarter here.
The juniors lost their chance to win
the meet when Schmeider was dis
qualified in the relay. This was the
closest race of the day. Allen, swim
ming first for the freshmen, was in
the lead at the end of his hundred
feet. The first-year men maintained the
lead for the first two laps with the
juniors second and the sophomores
third. Meyers, who swam third for the
1925 team, overcame most of this lead
during his distance, and "Dutch" Mc-
Callister beat out O'Connor for first
place in the last lap.
Most of the other races were won with
i considerable distance separating the vic
j tor from the second-place man. O'Con
nor led both the 50-yard and 220-yard
free style throughout, and in the 220 fir.-
! ished a good twenty feet ahead of Lang
ley. who came second. Charlie Fletcher
| was pushed hard by O'Connor in the
' 66 2-3-yard backstroke, but he had a lead
of several feet at the finish.
Myers led the field in the 100-yard free
; style for the first part of the distance,
I but Wright overtook him and won by
about four yards. Eric Kraemer won
| the 662-3-yard breaststroke, with
i Schmeider coming second.
Al White had little trouble in tak
ing first place in the diving. The na
tional champion made almost perfect
dives at each attempt and was ahead
of Gibbons, who came second, by a
large margin. Hawley captured first
in the plunge when he went 69 feet.
Johnson came second with a plunge
of 62 feet.
