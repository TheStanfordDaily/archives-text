## 
### 
We, the undersigned members of Encina Club, do hereby admit responsi
bility for freshman discipline such as has been fostered in Eniina Hall since
October, 1922.
We hereby willingly agree to lend such influence as we can to the
institution of senior control and to a senior sponsor system to take the place
of the disciplinary methods which we now declare it our purpose to abandon
and to combat in the future.

Editorial Note: In signing this agreement, it was understood between
the sophomores and the prosecuting parties, that existing rules with regard to
penalty for freshman discipline were not to be enforced in this case. The charges
hare been dropped in '.he belief that in the long run more cooperation may be
secured by cooperative methods than would have been the case had heavy penalties
been added to publicity. The sophomore members of Encina Club are, here doing
the University a real service and have proved by their assumption of responsibility
that they are of the timber that makes ivliat is called the "Stanford Man."
