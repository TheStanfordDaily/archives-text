when you have read the story, you may sec for yourself why it is considered the big

Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
party and the story was unoffieiallj
outlined. It was resolved that no im
mediate action should be taken.
The leader of the group in questior
also received a call that evening anc
the matter was discussed rather free
Iy. At this time a new element was
introduced when it was suggested thai
the punishment due the seven sopho
mores be distributed over the whole
group who had been responsible foi
the expedition in question. The pro
posed change was taken up with the
chairman of the men's council and the
president of the University, both oi
whom agreed that the matter should
be left to the responsible group for
consideration. Council action was to
be taken on the evening of February
7.
On the night of February 6 the
sophomores met and some of them
heard for the first time of the new
developments. Like the over-used
night, it was a dark and stormy ses
sion. The new trend, incidentally was
explained and the reasons charges
were being pressed were given by the
writer of this college tale. His re
marks were not hailed with very great
acclaim. Plentiful measures of criti
cism, sophomoric rebukes, and even
bits of praise were hurled at the head
of the accuser, who desired a signed
statement, addressed to the Encina
house committee, admitting guilt for
organized discipline. If this proved
impossible, he declared it his intention
to make an example of the seven
sophomores.
"Dig Stick Policy," was the cry.
It was too true. The tables were
turned. Six days before, the same
students were using identical tactics
without legal sanction on students who
had not even an alternative.
It was declared by the plaintiff that
senior control through the sponsor sys
tem must supplant sophomore control.
The charges were to be pressed, he said,
in order to guarantee against a return
to such methods in the future.
The defendants agreed with the
plaintiff that sophomore control was
wrong, but declared that this task had
been delegated to them by tradition and
that they had had no way out because
of upperclass influences. There "was
plenty of truth in what they said, yet
here was the chance to make an example
that would put an end to hazing, both
organized and unorganized. The plaintiff
made it plain that there was nothing to
be done except either to sign the docu
ment presented or else let the seven take
the consequencs. His plans of three
years' making had no loophole in them.
So far as he was concerned the matter
was settled.
Some willingly, some under protest,
some defiantly, and all soberly, forty-six
sophomores brought the meeting to a
close by affixing their signatures to a
document that will have a definite in
fluence for good on Stanford's future.
Within five minutes the Encina house
committee was in session. What took
place in that meeting will always be a
matter of speculation, but out of it came
the plaintiff determined to use the same
principles for which he had fought for
three years—co-operation in place of
compulsion. He determined to drop the
charges—to give the sophomores a
chance to make good—to put their com
bined constructive effort behind an in
evitable and more desirable substitute. Tf.
in doing this, he failed, then the example
could be construed in no other way than
that co-operation with freshmen will fail.
Tf he pressed the charges, he would be
applying the methods which he himself
had condemned. The sophomores prob
ably would not be willing to co-operate
in putting across a new system because
they had facer! compulsion in signing
the famous and publicly unseen docu
ment. But in agreeing to get behind a
substitute system when that force was
removed, they would automatically stamp
present methods as basically wrong.
This story written up to this point was
presented last night to the defendants,
now defendants no longer, for their
action.

Here is what took place at that meet
ing.
The sophomores met and had the fresh
ammunition exploded under their noses
with the effect that they are now solidly
behind a plan which they but a few mo
ments before had questioned. They
signed their names to a document which
appears on this page. At the end of the
meeting the plaintiff drew the first docu
ment from his pocket and lit a match
to it. Thus vanished in a flash of fire
and a puff of smoke the last element of
force. The first step had been taken on
a co-operative principle.
An hour later the plaintiff received a
telephone call informing him that the
Sequoia sophomores had taken a similar
action at a meeting called by a Sequoia
representative who was present at the
Encina session.
Moral: "The mills of the gods grind
slow, but grind exceeding fine."

Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
party and the story was unoffieiallj
outlined. It was resolved that no im
mediate action should be taken.
The leader of the group in questior
also received a call that evening anc
the matter was discussed rather free
Iy. At this time a new element was
introduced when it was suggested thai
the punishment due the seven sopho
mores be distributed over the whole
group who had been responsible foi
the expedition in question. The pro
posed change was taken up with the
chairman of the men's council and the
president of the University, both oi
whom agreed that the matter should
be left to the responsible group for
consideration. Council action was to
be taken on the evening of February
7.
On the night of February 6 the
sophomores met and some of them
heard for the first time of the new
developments. Like the over-used
night, it was a dark and stormy ses
sion. The new trend, incidentally was
explained and the reasons charges
were being pressed were given by the
writer of this college tale. His re
marks were not hailed with very great
acclaim. Plentiful measures of criti
cism, sophomoric rebukes, and even
bits of praise were hurled at the head
of the accuser, who desired a signed
statement, addressed to the Encina
house committee, admitting guilt for
organized discipline. If this proved
impossible, he declared it his intention
to make an example of the seven
sophomores.
"Dig Stick Policy," was the cry.
It was too true. The tables were
turned. Six days before, the same
students were using identical tactics
without legal sanction on students who
had not even an alternative.
It was declared by the plaintiff that
senior control through the sponsor sys
tem must supplant sophomore control.
The charges were to be pressed, he said,
in order to guarantee against a return
to such methods in the future.
The defendants agreed with the
plaintiff that sophomore control was
wrong, but declared that this task had
been delegated to them by tradition and
that they had had no way out because
of upperclass influences. There "was
plenty of truth in what they said, yet
here was the chance to make an example
that would put an end to hazing, both
organized and unorganized. The plaintiff
made it plain that there was nothing to
be done except either to sign the docu
ment presented or else let the seven take
the consequencs. His plans of three
years' making had no loophole in them.
So far as he was concerned the matter
was settled.
Some willingly, some under protest,
some defiantly, and all soberly, forty-six
sophomores brought the meeting to a
close by affixing their signatures to a
document that will have a definite in
fluence for good on Stanford's future.
Within five minutes the Encina house
committee was in session. What took
place in that meeting will always be a
matter of speculation, but out of it came
the plaintiff determined to use the same
principles for which he had fought for
three years—co-operation in place of
compulsion. He determined to drop the
charges—to give the sophomores a
chance to make good—to put their com
bined constructive effort behind an in
evitable and more desirable substitute. Tf.
in doing this, he failed, then the example
could be construed in no other way than
that co-operation with freshmen will fail.
Tf he pressed the charges, he would be
applying the methods which he himself
had condemned. The sophomores prob
ably would not be willing to co-operate
in putting across a new system because
they had facer! compulsion in signing
the famous and publicly unseen docu
ment. But in agreeing to get behind a
substitute system when that force was
removed, they would automatically stamp
present methods as basically wrong.
This story written up to this point was
presented last night to the defendants,
now defendants no longer, for their
action.

Here is what took place at that meet
ing.
The sophomores met and had the fresh
ammunition exploded under their noses
with the effect that they are now solidly
behind a plan which they but a few mo
ments before had questioned. They
signed their names to a document which
appears on this page. At the end of the
meeting the plaintiff drew the first docu
ment from his pocket and lit a match
to it. Thus vanished in a flash of fire
and a puff of smoke the last element of
force. The first step had been taken on
a co-operative principle.
An hour later the plaintiff received a
telephone call informing him that the
Sequoia sophomores had taken a similar
action at a meeting called by a Sequoia
representative who was present at the
Encina session.

Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
party and the story was unoffieiallj
outlined. It was resolved that no im
mediate action should be taken.
The leader of the group in questior
also received a call that evening anc
the matter was discussed rather free
Iy. At this time a new element was
introduced when it was suggested thai
the punishment due the seven sopho
mores be distributed over the whole
group who had been responsible foi
the expedition in question. The pro
posed change was taken up with the
chairman of the men's council and the
president of the University, both oi
whom agreed that the matter should
be left to the responsible group for
consideration. Council action was to
be taken on the evening of February
7.
On the night of February 6 the
sophomores met and some of them
heard for the first time of the new
developments. Like the over-used
night, it was a dark and stormy ses
sion. The new trend, incidentally was
explained and the reasons charges
were being pressed were given by the
writer of this college tale. His re
marks were not hailed with very great
acclaim. Plentiful measures of criti
cism, sophomoric rebukes, and even
bits of praise were hurled at the head
of the accuser, who desired a signed
statement, addressed to the Encina
house committee, admitting guilt for
organized discipline. If this proved
impossible, he declared it his intention
to make an example of the seven
sophomores.
"Dig Stick Policy," was the cry.
It was too true. The tables were
turned. Six days before, the same
students were using identical tactics
without legal sanction on students who
had not even an alternative.
It was declared by the plaintiff that
senior control through the sponsor sys
tem must supplant sophomore control.
The charges were to be pressed, he said,
in order to guarantee against a return
to such methods in the future.
The defendants agreed with the
plaintiff that sophomore control was
wrong, but declared that this task had
been delegated to them by tradition and
that they had had no way out because
of upperclass influences. There "was
plenty of truth in what they said, yet
here was the chance to make an example
that would put an end to hazing, both
organized and unorganized. The plaintiff
made it plain that there was nothing to
be done except either to sign the docu
ment presented or else let the seven take
the consequencs. His plans of three
years' making had no loophole in them.
So far as he was concerned the matter
was settled.
Some willingly, some under protest,
some defiantly, and all soberly, forty-six
sophomores brought the meeting to a
close by affixing their signatures to a
document that will have a definite in
fluence for good on Stanford's future.
Within five minutes the Encina house
committee was in session. What took
place in that meeting will always be a
matter of speculation, but out of it came
the plaintiff determined to use the same
principles for which he had fought for
three years—co-operation in place of
compulsion. He determined to drop the
charges—to give the sophomores a
chance to make good—to put their com
bined constructive effort behind an in
evitable and more desirable substitute. Tf.
in doing this, he failed, then the example
could be construed in no other way than
that co-operation with freshmen will fail.
Tf he pressed the charges, he would be
applying the methods which he himself
had condemned. The sophomores prob
ably would not be willing to co-operate
in putting across a new system because
they had facer! compulsion in signing
the famous and publicly unseen docu
ment. But in agreeing to get behind a
substitute system when that force was
removed, they would automatically stamp
present methods as basically wrong.
This story written up to this point was
presented last night to the defendants,
now defendants no longer, for their
action.

Here is what took place at that meet
ing.
The sophomores met and had the fresh
ammunition exploded under their noses
with the effect that they are now solidly
behind a plan which they but a few mo
ments before had questioned. They
signed their names to a document which
appears on this page. At the end of the
meeting the plaintiff drew the first docu
ment from his pocket and lit a match
to it. Thus vanished in a flash of fire
and a puff of smoke the last element of
force. The first step had been taken on
a co-operative principle.
An hour later the plaintiff received a
telephone call informing him that the
Sequoia sophomores had taken a similar
action at a meeting called by a Sequoia
representative who was present at the
Encina session.
Moral: "The mills of the gods grind
slow, but grind exceeding fine."

merely the story of an eye witness to the last hazing party Stanford will sec. And
when you have read the story, you may sec for yourself why it is considered the big
local nezvs of the day.
Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
party and the story was unoffieiallj
outlined. It was resolved that no im
mediate action should be taken.
The leader of the group in questior
also received a call that evening anc
the matter was discussed rather free
Iy. At this time a new element was
introduced when it was suggested thai
the punishment due the seven sopho
mores be distributed over the whole
group who had been responsible foi
the expedition in question. The pro
posed change was taken up with the
chairman of the men's council and the
president of the University, both oi
whom agreed that the matter should
be left to the responsible group for
consideration. Council action was to
be taken on the evening of February
7.
On the night of February 6 the
sophomores met and some of them
heard for the first time of the new
developments. Like the over-used
night, it was a dark and stormy ses
sion. The new trend, incidentally was
explained and the reasons charges
were being pressed were given by the
writer of this college tale. His re
marks were not hailed with very great
acclaim. Plentiful measures of criti
cism, sophomoric rebukes, and even
bits of praise were hurled at the head
of the accuser, who desired a signed
statement, addressed to the Encina
house committee, admitting guilt for
organized discipline. If this proved
impossible, he declared it his intention
to make an example of the seven
sophomores.
"Dig Stick Policy," was the cry.
It was too true. The tables were
turned. Six days before, the same
students were using identical tactics
without legal sanction on students who
had not even an alternative.
It was declared by the plaintiff that
senior control through the sponsor sys
tem must supplant sophomore control.
The charges were to be pressed, he said,
in order to guarantee against a return
to such methods in the future.
The defendants agreed with the
plaintiff that sophomore control was
wrong, but declared that this task had
been delegated to them by tradition and
that they had had no way out because
of upperclass influences. There "was
plenty of truth in what they said, yet
here was the chance to make an example
that would put an end to hazing, both
organized and unorganized. The plaintiff
made it plain that there was nothing to
be done except either to sign the docu
ment presented or else let the seven take
the consequencs. His plans of three
years' making had no loophole in them.
So far as he was concerned the matter
was settled.
Some willingly, some under protest,
some defiantly, and all soberly, forty-six
sophomores brought the meeting to a
close by affixing their signatures to a
document that will have a definite in
fluence for good on Stanford's future.
Within five minutes the Encina house
committee was in session. What took
place in that meeting will always be a
matter of speculation, but out of it came
the plaintiff determined to use the same
principles for which he had fought for
three years—co-operation in place of
compulsion. He determined to drop the
charges—to give the sophomores a
chance to make good—to put their com
bined constructive effort behind an in
evitable and more desirable substitute. Tf.
in doing this, he failed, then the example
could be construed in no other way than
that co-operation with freshmen will fail.
Tf he pressed the charges, he would be
applying the methods which he himself
had condemned. The sophomores prob
ably would not be willing to co-operate
in putting across a new system because
they had facer! compulsion in signing
the famous and publicly unseen docu
ment. But in agreeing to get behind a
substitute system when that force was
removed, they would automatically stamp
present methods as basically wrong.
This story written up to this point was
presented last night to the defendants,
now defendants no longer, for their
action.

Here is what took place at that meet
ing.
The sophomores met and had the fresh
ammunition exploded under their noses
with the effect that they are now solidly
behind a plan which they but a few mo
ments before had questioned. They
signed their names to a document which
appears on this page. At the end of the
meeting the plaintiff drew the first docu
ment from his pocket and lit a match
to it. Thus vanished in a flash of fire
and a puff of smoke the last element of
force. The first step had been taken on
a co-operative principle.
An hour later the plaintiff received a
telephone call informing him that the
Sequoia sophomores had taken a similar
action at a meeting called by a Sequoia
representative who was present at the
Encina session.
Moral: "The mills of the gods grind
slow, but grind exceeding fine."

when you have read the story, you may sec for yourself why it is considered the big
local nezvs of the day.
Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
party and the story was unoffieiallj
outlined. It was resolved that no im
mediate action should be taken.
The leader of the group in questior
also received a call that evening anc
the matter was discussed rather free
Iy. At this time a new element was
introduced when it was suggested thai
the punishment due the seven sopho
mores be distributed over the whole
group who had been responsible foi
the expedition in question. The pro
posed change was taken up with the
chairman of the men's council and the
president of the University, both oi
whom agreed that the matter should
be left to the responsible group for
consideration. Council action was to
be taken on the evening of February
7.
On the night of February 6 the
sophomores met and some of them
heard for the first time of the new
developments. Like the over-used
night, it was a dark and stormy ses
sion. The new trend, incidentally was
explained and the reasons charges
were being pressed were given by the
writer of this college tale. His re
marks were not hailed with very great
acclaim. Plentiful measures of criti
cism, sophomoric rebukes, and even
bits of praise were hurled at the head
of the accuser, who desired a signed
statement, addressed to the Encina
house committee, admitting guilt for
organized discipline. If this proved
impossible, he declared it his intention
to make an example of the seven
sophomores.
"Dig Stick Policy," was the cry.
It was too true. The tables were
turned. Six days before, the same
students were using identical tactics
without legal sanction on students who
had not even an alternative.
It was declared by the plaintiff that
senior control through the sponsor sys
tem must supplant sophomore control.
The charges were to be pressed, he said,
in order to guarantee against a return
to such methods in the future.
The defendants agreed with the
plaintiff that sophomore control was
wrong, but declared that this task had
been delegated to them by tradition and
that they had had no way out because
of upperclass influences. There "was
plenty of truth in what they said, yet
here was the chance to make an example
that would put an end to hazing, both
organized and unorganized. The plaintiff
made it plain that there was nothing to
be done except either to sign the docu
ment presented or else let the seven take
the consequencs. His plans of three
years' making had no loophole in them.
So far as he was concerned the matter
was settled.
Some willingly, some under protest,
some defiantly, and all soberly, forty-six
sophomores brought the meeting to a
close by affixing their signatures to a
document that will have a definite in
fluence for good on Stanford's future.
Within five minutes the Encina house
committee was in session. What took
place in that meeting will always be a
matter of speculation, but out of it came
the plaintiff determined to use the same
principles for which he had fought for
three years—co-operation in place of
compulsion. He determined to drop the
charges—to give the sophomores a
chance to make good—to put their com
bined constructive effort behind an in
evitable and more desirable substitute. Tf.
in doing this, he failed, then the example
could be construed in no other way than
that co-operation with freshmen will fail.
Tf he pressed the charges, he would be
applying the methods which he himself
had condemned. The sophomores prob
ably would not be willing to co-operate
in putting across a new system because
they had facer! compulsion in signing
the famous and publicly unseen docu
ment. But in agreeing to get behind a
substitute system when that force was
removed, they would automatically stamp
present methods as basically wrong.
This story written up to this point was
presented last night to the defendants,
now defendants no longer, for their
action.

Here is what took place at that meet
ing.
The sophomores met and had the fresh
ammunition exploded under their noses
with the effect that they are now solidly
behind a plan which they but a few mo
ments before had questioned. They
signed their names to a document which
appears on this page. At the end of the
meeting the plaintiff drew the first docu
ment from his pocket and lit a match
to it. Thus vanished in a flash of fire
and a puff of smoke the last element of
force. The first step had been taken on
a co-operative principle.
An hour later the plaintiff received a
telephone call informing him that the
Sequoia sophomores had taken a similar
action at a meeting called by a Sequoia
representative who was present at the
Encina session.

slow, but grind exceeding fine."
