(This is neither a ncics story nor an editorial. It is not intended as an expose.
It is a review of a recent revolutionary trend toward evolution in freshman discipline.
Personal prejudice and positive convictions motivate no line here printed. It is
merely the story of an eye witness to the last hazing party Stanford will sec. And
when you have read the story, you may sec for yourself why it is considered the big
local nezvs of the day.
Embittered by freshman discipline in his first year at Stanford, the ztriter has
put forth every possible effort since that time to stamp out the practice, lie has
openly declared to the classes of 1923, 1924, and 1925 that if ever he caught anybody
with the goods, they might 'as zvell take off the "s" and add "night" in its place.
On the evening of January 31, the trap, baited for three years was sprung. The
existence and location of the trap was obvious. But emboldened by past successes
and rapt in the contemplation of a traditional system of which they ivere the lucky,
victims, seven sophomores on that night had at once the honor and the misfortune
to get caught red-handed. It is this story and its consequent developments that is
told belozv.)
Four of us learned on the night of January 31 that the sophomore class,
as represented in Encina Hall, had held a meeting at which it was arranged
to conduct spanking expeditions with freshmen as hosts on Wednesday and
Friday nights. The time was to be between one and three o'clock.
Posting ourselves in front of Encina at the cold and absorbing hour of
1:00, we waited. At 1:30, a light on the third floor winked out. A door
slammed. A moment later, a light flashed on a floor farther down. Mumbled
conversation. Lights off. At 1:55 a light came on in a first floor room —
right under our noses. Masked men. Conversation.
"Get out of bed, 6 . Put on your bathrobe and get a towel. All
right, you, get your noses back under the covers and leave the door open.
Come on, C !" The victim was blindfolded with his own towel.
Lights off. The door closed.
Repeat this paragraph eight times and you will have learned what we saw
in the next ten minutes. The hazers and the hazed began to assemble around
the basement door of the East wing. Crouched in the bushes near the
entrance, we watched with considerable interest the clandestine procedure.
Freshmen, faces swathed in their own towels, shivering in pajamas never
intended for the night air of January, were led one at a time up and down the
paved road by sophomores, now unmasked. A brilliant moon revealed every
move. Had we wished, we could have stretched forth our hands and touched
the erstwhile strollers.

"Why are you out here, Freshman?"
"Dunno," sullenly.
"Well, I don't know either, but 1
guess you've been off the boat. Wear
your dink?"
"Yes."
"Been smokin' cigarettes?"
"No."
"Queen on the Quad?"
"Naw!"
"Decorate for the dance?"
"Yeah."
"Been cocky?"
"Oh, I don't know," wearily. "I just!
know you've got me."
The group assembled. The freshmen
were formed in a poorly aligned col
umn of two's and aided by sophomores
at the business end of formidable pad
dles trailed off in the moonlight to
ward the Row, passing between the
new eating clubs and Toyon Hall.
Waiting until the party had gone a
hundred yards, we set a hot pace in
pursuit.
"Some of the boys due for a surprise
t'night, I see," remarked the night
watchman of the new hall, peering at
us from his door as we passed. He
grinned.
"Yes," was the reply, "some of the
boys are due for a surprise."
The group ahead seemed to have
sensed our approach. They edged off :
the road, but continued now and then ;
to do their-delcgated-by-tradition duty
by making the local welkins ring with
an occasional "Thwack!"
The group left the road entirely and
started off across the mud flat south
of Toyon—walked about fifty yards
and stopped. The sophomores saw us
plainly then, for we were only a few
yards away. They gathered in a group
to one side as if the freshmen were
merely out to give them a voluntary
entertainment In the form of an in
terpretive dance in the moonlight.
"Take off your towels, Frosh!'
Bewildered, the freshmen obeyed.,
wondering what was coming next.
"All right, Frosh, the party's over, i
Take a look at these fellows and see
who your friends are. Don't forgot
'em. And hereafter, if you haven't
enough nerve to fight for your rights,
keep your doors locked and don't open
'em to sophomores. They haven't got

the crust to break 'em down."
Still dazed and only half-compre
hending, the freshmen did as bidden,
meanwhile ineffectually trying to keep
on their bedroom slippers in ankle
deep mud. One of them fell on his
hands and knees in a chill. They slow
ly wandered back toward Encina.
"Now, Sophomores, the evening's en
tertainment is over. Report to the
men's council in the morning and tell
them the whole story. We have the
goods on you and there's no use try
ing to hedge. It'll go easier with you if
one of us does not have to press the
charges."
We walked away. The last hazing
party at Stanford University was at
an end.
That night the dumfounded sopho
mores woke the leader of their group
and told him the whole sad story. They
resolved to have him act as inter
mediary between them and the men's
council. He acted, chiefly as investi
gator. The chairman of the men's
I council was called upon by one of our
