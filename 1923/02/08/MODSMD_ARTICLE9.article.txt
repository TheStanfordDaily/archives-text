# FRESHMAN QUINTET WHIPS SAN MATEO IN RAGGED CONTEST
## 
### 
San Mateo High School went down
to defeat before the 1926 basketball
team last night to the tune of 30-9 in
a ragged and uninteresting game.
The preps failed to show strength
on either the offense or defense and
the babes had things pretty much
their own way throughout. Hunt gave
every man on his squad a chance to
play and made several experiments in
using them at different positions.
Morrison at center was the high
point man, with six field baskets. He
played good basketball and had no
trouble locating the hoop. Nevers
played his usual fast floor game and
accounted for ten points. Mitchell was
suffering from a slight cold and was
a little off his game.
The yearlings started filling the bas
ket early in the game and were lead
ing 10-0 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was slow, the high
school team scoring two free ones
while the babes were adding four
points to their total.
Morrison got under way at the be
ginning of the second half and sunk
four field baskets in succession while
the preps were piling up five points. In
the last quarter, Nevers and Carter did
most of the scoring, aided by one long
shot from Morrison, who took Mitch
ell's place.
Last night's fracas was the last pre
liminary for the babes before the sec
ond game with the Bruin Cubs.
