# IDLE LIFE GIVEN CHEER BY CAST OF KNIGHTIE KNIGHT
## Lines for Play Are Learned Though the Concatenation Has Not Been Completed 
### Henry Mack, '24 
"Nothing to do and all day to do it
in."
So says the chorus at the opening of
Knightie Knight, but watching re
hearsals leads to the conclusion that
there is a great deal to do and that
the chorus is busy doing it.
Last night the principals and chorus
worked together on the songs for the
first time. The big problem facing Di
rector Arnold Bayley now as the week
before production approaches is hang
ing the different parts of the show
together. Lines are well in hand, and
the action for most of the scenes plot
ted out, but the relation of orchestra,
cast, and chorus into a synchronous
whole is yet to be accomplished.
Again the futuristic tone in scenery,
this time planned by Ted Van Deusen,
'24. The set for the first act stands
virtually completed, with the red, yel
low, and blue rocks of the Sorcerer's
cavern striking the eyo from all parts
of the theater. Working with Van
Deusen in the actual execution of the
sets is Clyde Coakley, and his crew of
stage hands. Stoddard Atwood is busy
completing the touches on the lighting
system.
Songs for the play are numerous
and catchy. Noteworthy in itself is the
number and cleverness of the talk
songs. In the line of fox-trots the num
ber is limited but the music for all of
them is well-written.
Music for the play will be under the
direction of Alabaster, who is well
known in campus music circles.
A touch of the Revue is added to
the play in the third act, with the pre
sentation of the song, "Together,
Dear." Director Bayley refuses to di
vulge further information as to its
nature, merely cryptically stating
"Wait." And, as further information
could not be secured, wait it is.
The opening of the first act is guar
anteed to lift the audience out of the
trance occasioned by a glance at the
settings, shake them a bit, and drop
them back ready to be amused in any
harmless way the authors may have
devised. This is said of every play
that ever crossed the footlights of the
campus stage, but this opening is dif
ferent. And again the veil of secrecy
is dropped, and the watchword is
"Wait!"
