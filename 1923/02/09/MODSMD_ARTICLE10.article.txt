# FRESHMAN FIVE TO MEET BRUIN COBS TOMORROW NIGHT
## Second Yearling Game Will Be Played in Harmon Gym; Hunt May Shift Line-Up 
### 
Two weeks ago, the Stanford fresli
j man basketball team surprised even its
most optimistic supporters by playing
the California freshmen to a standstill,
only losing out in the last few minutes
J l>y a 20-17 score. Tomorrow night,
| when the two teams meet for the secoild
game in Harmon gymnasium, the Card
| babes may have another surprise in store
for "Nibs" Price's team as well as the
I Stanford rooters.
Coach Hunt's live is due to play good
basketball tomorrow night, but then
; it is a hard matter to predict what that
| aggregation is going to do in any game.
! They seem to lie a "week-end" team, as
they have never failed to play good bas
j ketball on Friday or Saturday and have
seldom failed to play just as poorly in
, their Wednesday games. Point number
jone in their favor.
In their three games since the first
; tussle with the Bruin Cubs, the yearlings
have looked more like a basketball team,
although they played a ragged game'
against San Mateo High School Wed
nesday night. They upset a four-year
precedent by tacking a 22-19 defeat on
Berkeley High School and had to play
good basketball to do it. Although the
freshmen were able to win by but one
point from Oakland High School, they
again worked well in this game.
Hunt had his team scrimmaging the
145-pound aggregation last night, and
i with a new scoring combination, the
babes looked like a more formidable ma
i chine. Nevers and Morrison were fill
j irig the forward positions, with Carter
lat center, Mitchell at running , and
; Frazier at standing guard. These two
forwards work well together and should
cause no end of trouble for the Blue and
: Gold babe guards. Morrison's height and
! long reach seem to be exactly what the
team needs under the basket.
Carter is coming through in fine style
' at the center job and is finding the hoop
j regularly. His floor game is improving
J rapidly, too. Mitchell has almost com-
Jpletely recovered from his cold and
| should be in shape for his best game of
the season. Frazier is a man that should
j prove hard for the Cub forwards to lose
J under the hoop. He has always been a
| good defensive forward and ought to fit
into the machine nicely at standing guard.
The guards will have their jobs cut
out for them in holding Butts and
Holmes, star California freshman for
wards, down. Butts accounted for ten
of the Cubs' twenty points in the first
game and Holmes scored four. Either
|of these men arc dangerous, as are
