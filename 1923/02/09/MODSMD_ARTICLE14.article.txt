# BETA THETA PI TAKES FIFTH STRAIGHT GAME
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi came to life in the sec
ond half of their game with Breakers
j last night and took the contest, 21-12,
j after trailing during the first period,
i Delta Kappa Epsilon defeated the Japan
jese Club, 18-9, without much difficulty in
the other game played yesterday. Two
games were forfeited, Phi Gamma Delta
and Alpha Delta Phi failing to appear
! for their games with Encina Hall, first
I and second floor teams, respectively. ,
Beta Theta Pi had no easy time win
ning last night from the Breakers, who
held them well during the whole of the
first half and led them by one point at
the end of the period. Three field goals
by Lowenstein from the middle of the
court gave the Breakers the advantage
early in the game and the Beta Theta Pi
players failed to get up enough con
j sistcnt speed to tally. Two baskets by
Granger from the running guard posi
tion just after the start of the second
I period broke the ice for Beta Theta Pi
; and some clever teamwork and cutting
1 in by Proctor and Alabaster increased the
score by four more goals. The Breakers'
• forwards showed some good dribbling,
! but their guarding became weak after
■ the half and the Beta Theta Pi front line
! had little difficulty in breaking through
' to the basket.
" J Besides Lowenstein, who showed some
pretty work in the first half, Peavy and
• Masters were the best passers and drib
-1 biers the Breakers had. Alabaster did
> some fast dodging to get away from his
5 guard and was always free when the
ball arrived. Dole played the backboard

carefully and snared almost all the sliots
which bounded from it. Proctor did not
perfom so well at center as he has at
forward, and Mannoccir was missed in
his old position.
Delta Kappa Epsilon easily defeated
the Japanese Club, 18-9, in the Pavilion
last night in a game which was slow, but
marked with some pretty spurts of team
play and accurate passing. StefTan did
the best work for Delta Kappa Epsilon,
directing the plays and keeping his team
mates on their toes. D. L. Fuller tallied
three times from the floor and he and
Steffan made a good forward pair, fully
able to get the ball under the basket.
Mizota and Murata each scored two
field goals for the Japanese Club and
were responsible for most of the ag
gressiveness displayed by their team. By
winning this game, Delta Kappa Epsilon
advanced to second place in League 1,
Japanese Club and Breakers, who were
tied with them, both losing their games.
This puts Delta Kappa Epsilon within
a game of Beta Theta Pi.
At the close of the league contests
Wednesday, the six league winners will
be divided by lot into two yeagues of
three teams each. Each team will then
play two games and the winners of the
leagues will meet in a grand final to be
played in the Pavilion. League winners
will receive a metal plaque with their
name and league engraved on it; the
interlcague victor will be awarded a
large felt banner. The tournament will
be concluded by the end of next week
or shortly thereafter.

the end of the period. Three field goals
by Lowenstein from the middle of the
court gave the Breakers the advantage
early in the game and the Beta Theta Pi
players failed to get up enough con
j sistcnt speed to tally. Two baskets by
Granger from the running guard posi
tion just after the start of the second
I period broke the ice for Beta Theta Pi
; and some clever teamwork and cutting
1 in by Proctor and Alabaster increased the
score by four more goals. The Breakers'
• forwards showed some good dribbling,
! but their guarding became weak after
■ the half and the Beta Theta Pi front line
! had little difficulty in breaking through
' to the basket.
" J Besides Lowenstein, who showed some
pretty work in the first half, Peavy and
• Masters were the best passers and drib
-1 biers the Breakers had. Alabaster did
> some fast dodging to get away from his
5 guard and was always free when the
ball arrived. Dole played the backboard

carefully and snared almost all the sliots
which bounded from it. Proctor did not
perfom so well at center as he has at
forward, and Mannoccir was missed in
his old position.
Delta Kappa Epsilon easily defeated
the Japanese Club, 18-9, in the Pavilion
last night in a game which was slow, but
marked with some pretty spurts of team
play and accurate passing. StefTan did
the best work for Delta Kappa Epsilon,
directing the plays and keeping his team
mates on their toes. D. L. Fuller tallied
three times from the floor and he and
Steffan made a good forward pair, fully
able to get the ball under the basket.
Mizota and Murata each scored two
field goals for the Japanese Club and
were responsible for most of the ag
gressiveness displayed by their team. By
winning this game, Delta Kappa Epsilon
advanced to second place in League 1,
Japanese Club and Breakers, who were
tied with them, both losing their games.
This puts Delta Kappa Epsilon within
a game of Beta Theta Pi.
