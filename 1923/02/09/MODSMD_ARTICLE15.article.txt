# CARDINAL VARSITY OPENS SERIES WITH TROJANS TONIGHT
## U.S.C. Will Give Strong Opposition To Stanford in Los Angeles On Their Home Court 
### 
Tonight down in Los Angeles, the
Stanford varsity will open their return
series vyith the University of Southern
California.
Playing on a strange floor, the odd*
are against the Cardinal squad, but these
odds should be even up by the fact that
the Trojans have had a hard schedule
to play during the last two weeks, while
the Stanford varsity has had things
rather easy.
Although it will mean little more than
a moral victory for U. S. C. to win the
series starting tonight, it will give Stan
ford a very decided advantage to conn
back with the long end of the score
for both contests. With California
credited with two defeats in four .names
played, the Blue and Gold squad wilt
have an uphill fight next week when the
series that will decide the winning of
the southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference championship begins.
Coach Les Turner will probably start
his regular squad of football players
against Kerr's five tonight, but it is
doubtful whether they will get away with
as much rough work as was evidenced
here. Charley Bone will be the gentle
man that will bear watching by the Stan
ford guards. Bone made practically all
of the points registered by U. S. C.
against Stanford on the Pavilion court.
Coach Andy Kerr will use defensive
tactics for part of the first game until
the players are accustomed to the south
erners' floor and then with McHosc and
Rogers leading, the Cardinal five will
show what they know in the way of of
fensive basketball. "Nip" McHose has
been troubled by poison oak this week,
but under the care of Trainer Denny,
he should be able to show his usual form.
Fred Anderson is fast making the
fans forget about Dick Richmond. Al
though not as flashy a player as Rich
mond, Anderson is the fastest man on
the Cardinal varsity. Aside from being
an accurate shot and a good dribbler,
his defensive work has been one of the
chief factors in holding down the score
of Stanford opponents this year. It is
quite likely that if Bone starts looping
them in Kerr will detail Anderson to
look after the little Trojan.
Janssen starts tonight at center, and
if he continues to improve as he has m
the last three or four games, he can be
counted upon for several points. Oliva
will open the game at standing guard,
with Dudley DeGroot ready to relieve
him.

chief factors in holding down the score
of Stanford opponents this year. It is
quite likely that if Bone starts looping
them in Kerr will detail Anderson to
look after the little Trojan.
Janssen starts tonight at center, and
if he continues to improve as he has m
the last three or four games, he can be
counted upon for several points. Oliva
will open the game at standing guard,
with Dudley DeGroot ready to relieve
him.
Tonight down in Los Angeles, the
Stanford varsity will open their return
series vyith the University of Southern
California.
Playing on a strange floor, the odd*
are against the Cardinal squad, but these
odds should be even up by the fact that
the Trojans have had a hard schedule
to play during the last two weeks, while
the Stanford varsity has had things
rather easy.
Although it will mean little more than
a moral victory for U. S. C. to win the
series starting tonight, it will give Stan
ford a very decided advantage to conn
back with the long end of the score
for both contests. With California
credited with two defeats in four .names
played, the Blue and Gold squad wilt
have an uphill fight next week when the
series that will decide the winning of
the southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference championship begins.
Coach Les Turner will probably start
his regular squad of football players
against Kerr's five tonight, but it is
doubtful whether they will get away with
as much rough work as was evidenced
here. Charley Bone will be the gentle
man that will bear watching by the Stan
ford guards. Bone made practically all
of the points registered by U. S. C.
against Stanford on the Pavilion court.
Coach Andy Kerr will use defensive
tactics for part of the first game until
the players are accustomed to the south
erners' floor and then with McHosc and
Rogers leading, the Cardinal five will
show what they know in the way of of
fensive basketball. "Nip" McHose has
been troubled by poison oak this week,
but under the care of Trainer Denny,
he should be able to show his usual form.
Fred Anderson is fast making the
fans forget about Dick Richmond. Al
though not as flashy a player as Rich
mond, Anderson is the fastest man on
the Cardinal varsity. Aside from being
an accurate shot and a good dribbler,
his defensive work has been one of the
chief factors in holding down the score
of Stanford opponents this year. It is
quite likely that if Bone starts looping
them in Kerr will detail Anderson to
look after the little Trojan.
Janssen starts tonight at center, and
if he continues to improve as he has m
the last three or four games, he can be
counted upon for several points. Oliva
will open the game at standing guard,
with Dudley DeGroot ready to relieve
him.
