# BASEBALL VARSITY MEETS BANK NINES
## 
### 
Two semi-pro bank nines from San
Francisco will invade the campus to
morrow and Monday for tussles with
the Stanford baseball varsity. The
French-Americans, reputed to be the
stronger of the visiting teams, will en
gage the Cardinal tomorrow afternoon
on the varsity field, while the Federal
Reserve Bank slabstcrs will take a lead
ing role in the Lincoln's birthday pro
gram. Both games will begin at 3
o'clock.
The Federal Reserve Bankers were
turned back by the Cards, 8-2, in a pre
liminary season game last year. Stan
ford used three twirlers and they were
masters of the situation at all times.
The Reserve men have not been out in
uniform long this year, but they are an
exceedingly promising bunch.
Solomon and Clark are slated for
mound duty in the game tomorrow, while
Huneke and Fuller are both going to
get a chance to wear the mask. The
Monday contest will see A1 Loewenstein
in the box for the Cards with Aydelotte
and Teague in reserve.
Although the two visiting teams do
not have the reputation of the Ambrose
Tailors of Oakland, who hung a defeat
on the Cards last Wednesday, 8-4, their
nines are to be respected. The varsity
had a wonderful chance of copping the
tilt with the Ambrose professionals, for
they led, 3-1, and outhit the visitors
seven swats to two during the first five
innings. And then in one frame the
Tailors spurted and took a two-run lead.
Stanford connected safely for nine
bingles—but the hits didn't come when
they could do the most good.
Many encounters are crowded on the
boards for the next two weeks, and the
Cards intend to find themselves a little
bit better in every clash, so that they
will be playing speedy and consistent
ball when the real season opens.
Admission to both the Banker games
will be by student body cards.
