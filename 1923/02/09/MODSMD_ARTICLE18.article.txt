# HAYWARD WILL OPEN FRESHMAN BASEBALL SCHEDULE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Weather conditions permitting, the
1926 baseball team will open the sea
son tomorrow afternoon at 2:30i with
Hayward High School. The semi
marine condition of the diamond has
forced the Babes to call off a half dozen
engagements, but Coach "Husky"
Hunt looked at the moon over his left
shoulder last night and is expecting
his luck to change. Once the ice is
broken there will be two games each
week to engage the attention of the
Dink liorse-hide specialists.
The line-up which is to oppose Hay
ward tomorrow is as unsettled as the
weather. Very little practice has been
held during the past two weeks, and
Hunt has scarcely been able to observe
his charges, due to his basketball
duties. Oviatt, Ditzler and Johnson
will furnish the selection of a twiMer,
although none of them have had the
chance to work the kinks out of the
old pitching arm. Kohler will probably
be on the receiving end of the balls
and strikes, and there the outlook
becomes less definite. A tentative
group of infielders includes Lucas at
shortstop, Draper at first, Lovelace at
second and Green at the hot corner of
the square. The outfield will be picked
from Meiklejohn, Sherrill, Aydelott
and Smith, with practically every man
on the squad having just as good a
chance.
According to Coach Hunt, the infield
combination is an unusually fine col
lection of individual players for a
freshman team. Their fielding is bril
liant, but so far none of the boys have
gotten an eye on the ball. Meiklejohn
seems to be one of the strongest hit
ters on the club, but a few games will
give a better basis for comparison. At
present the Babes, individually and
, collectively, are in the dark horse
class.
