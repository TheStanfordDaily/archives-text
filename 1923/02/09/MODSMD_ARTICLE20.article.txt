# "THEY SAY"
## 
### 
Next to "I told you so," "They say" is about the
worst combination of words one can enclose in quo
tation marks. "They say" the undergraduate may
look for testimony against faculty attitude and pro
cedure and vice versa. To "They say" the student
may often attribute either his popularity or its re
verse. To "They say" most of the harm and little
of the good done about the University owe their ex
istence. It is an opening in any discussion, an intro
duction that may preface slander, scandal or just
plain prevarication. "They say" means nothing
more than that nobody knows who said it.
There are only two ways to avoid the use of this
introduction. One is not to say anything, which,
although it gets us nowhere, at least does not set us
back five yards for being off-side. The other is to
get facts from sourcesâ€”to know. How much more
pleasant undergraduate life would be if actual facts
could supplant second-hand opinion in discussion
among both individuals and groups.
Misunderstandings and factional feelings would
melt away and at the same time students would be
thinking for themselves, an ultimate necessity if
undergraduate life is to assume deeper and broader
aspects.
