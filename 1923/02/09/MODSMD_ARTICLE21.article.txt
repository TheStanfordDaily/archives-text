# IN THE SOUTH
## 
### 
Interest is now centered on Andy Kerr and his
court team, who play the Trojan quintet for the third
time this season in Los Angeles tonight. Kerr and
Davis have put a team on the floor that seems to be
able to cope with the best the state has had to offer
thus far this season. If the Cards come through
this week-end series undefeated, it will look as if
Stanford rooters are due for a change of atmos
phere in the way of long-needed serpentine.
The Stanford five has been consistent in its grad
ual improvement from the start of the schedule.
New men and new methods were used with a degree
of care and caution that stamps Kerr's system as
effective and sound. He makes his game fit the
men. They are not chosen to fit the game. Such a
system cannot help but be an eventual and consistent
winner.
