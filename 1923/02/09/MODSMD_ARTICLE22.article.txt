# ANOTHER WORD ON CARS
## 
### 
An editorial entitled "Autos Not on the Cur
riculum," appearing in a recent issue of the New
York Evening Post, might be of interest to local
people. The facts given here might well apply
locally.
"The traditional picture of the undergraduate as
an irresponsible youth bent solely upon having a
good time in the noisiest way possible is made more
fantastic than ever by the attitude of the Princeton
Senior Council upon student-owned automobiles.
Last year the faculty suggested to parents that the
possession of a motor car was of no visible benefit to
a student's scholastic standing. This year the same
course has been taken by the student governing
body. It will be a narrow-minded and obstinate
parent who in the face of this double testimony and
appeal allows his son to have a car at Princeton. In
deed, it would not be going too far to say that a stu
dent who defies the public opinion of the university
as thus expressed has no cause for complaint if he
is told that he may not return next fall. Puritanical
regulations such as formerly prevailed at universities
are utterly out of place, but when any practice can
be shown to be subversive of the purposes for which
a university exists, it would be an abuse of personal
liberty not to put it under ban."
Princeton is but one of many universities in which
action outlined alx">ve has been taken. It is a matter
of no little concern whether or not Stanford decides
to be among the last to follow this lead. It is a mat
ter which requires immediate thought and ultimate
action.
