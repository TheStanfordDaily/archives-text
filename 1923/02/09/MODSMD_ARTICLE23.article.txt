ALMANAC NUMBER
That Contributor's Number was such a success that
we have decided to have an Almanac Number. Why we
should decide to have an Almanac Number after a suc
cessful Contributor's Number we are not quite certain,
but nevertheless the recent spell of unusual weather
has decided it.
• • •
No almanac is complete without weather. So we are
going to have that right here and get it over with:
WEATHER
The weather today was fair and warmer. Indications
for tomorrow are not certain, but Pop Harris is feeling
the return of the rheumatics in his legs and it looks like
rain. However, predictions as to that will be posted
tomorrow for certain.
• • •
NO ALMANAC is complete without a record. Here
is ours:
RECORD
(Brunswick type)
No. of checks written during January 845
ISfo. of checks returned 845
No. of bills payable 356
Paid 1
Should have been 355
Letters written asking for more money for books 32
Answers received, negative 32
Affirmative
(Note: The last blank is left blank for a purpose. It
will keep the baby quiet for hours figuring out the
answer while mamma shovels the coal into the cellar.)
* * *
Do you suffer from loss of sleep, headache, toothache,
appendicitis, dandruff, or bad eyesight? A bottle of
Hazard Hare Tonic will put you on speaking terms with
Nature again. Why suffer alone; let us help you!
* • *
FAMOUS FACTS
There are 900,006,000 feet of twine manufactured in
New York yearly. This is enough string, if braided to
gether into an inch hemp rope, to hang every reformer
in the country.
• * *
Mark Antony had flat feet.
• • *
So do policemen.

ALMANAC NUMBER
That Contributor's Number was such a success that
we have decided to have an Almanac Number. Why we
should decide to have an Almanac Number after a suc
cessful Contributor's Number we are not quite certain,
but nevertheless the recent spell of unusual weather
has decided it.

No almanac is complete without weather. So we are
going to have that right here and get it over with:
WEATHER
The weather today was fair and warmer. Indications
for tomorrow are not certain, but Pop Harris is feeling
the return of the rheumatics in his legs and it looks like
rain. However, predictions as to that will be posted
tomorrow for certain.

NO ALMANAC is complete without a record. Here
is ours:
RECORD
(Brunswick type)
No. of checks written during January 845
ISfo. of checks returned 845
No. of bills payable 356
Paid 1
Should have been 355
Letters written asking for more money for books 32
Answers received, negative 32
Affirmative
(Note: The last blank is left blank for a purpose. It
will keep the baby quiet for hours figuring out the
answer while mamma shovels the coal into the cellar.)

Do you suffer from loss of sleep, headache, toothache,
appendicitis, dandruff, or bad eyesight? A bottle of

Nature again. Why suffer alone; let us help you!

FAMOUS FACTS
There are 900,006,000 feet of twine manufactured in
New York yearly. This is enough string, if braided to
gether into an inch hemp rope, to hang every reformer
in the country.
