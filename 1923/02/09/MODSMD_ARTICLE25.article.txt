Basketball fans who have seen both
the Stanford and California varsities
in action are divided as to the out
come of the opening game tomorrow
night at Harmon gymnasium. A close
fight is expected, however, and judg
ing from their respective showings
against Washington State, both teams
should "be on their toes.
• ♦ •
An intercollegiate agreement for
spring sports will be dr*wn up with
California tonight. The agreement will
be for one quarter only and will in
clude all the spring sports. When re
lations with California were broken
off in 1914, all intercollegiate agree
ments were discarded, and since then
the committees have met annually be
fore the spring sports season to sign
an agreement for one semester.

"Sporting news is the final triumph
of the newspaper," Chester Rowell,
editor of the Fresno Republican, said
in a talk last night in the Union under
auspices of the Press Club. "In ac
curacy and thoroughness there is no
news in existence that approaches the
sporting news," he continued, and
added that "When the people demand
the same accuracy in other news they
will get it."
• * *
Many weird things appear in the
new "Bawl-Out" which went on sale
today. The largest person in the Uni
versity is a girl—her name is Biggar.
Her influence is counteracted by one
Talboy. The militarists are represented
by two Gunns and one Cannon. Pike
and Sturgeon appear in the aquarium,
and denizens of the air consist of
Dickey birds, two Crowes, and two
mere Byrds.

Will Irwin, '99, war correspondent
at front, has been awarded the
palm for war-reporting by the London
Daily Mail. It is a noteworthy event
for an American to receive this honor.

Some of the best baseball of the
present season will be dished up to
Cardinal fans tomorrow afternoon,
when the varsity and freshman nines
play in a double-header against St.
Mary's and San Jose High School.
