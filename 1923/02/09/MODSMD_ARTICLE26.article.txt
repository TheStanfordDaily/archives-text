# Pedestrians May Come Into Own if Red Peril On Campus Is Banished
## 
### 
There is a good chance of history
repeating itself if Stanford has to go
back to the days of "Uncle John" and
Jasper Paulsen and use busses and
carry-alls as means of transportation.
The road to Paly is a long one espe
cially when one has to hoof it, so there
might be a big chance for some wide
awake young man to install a jitney
service on the campus in the near
future.
The Red Peril may go. It makes no
difference whether one pays six cents
and rides inside like a gentleman or
chooses to ride on the back step F.
O. B. â€”for both methods may be ban
ished.
The removal of the tracks of the
Peninsula Railway in Palo Alto and
probably also on the campus, loomed
as a possibility yesterday when the
City Council of that city demanded
that the company repair its tracks on
University avenue and Waverley
street.
F. E. Chapin, manager of the com
pany, has consulted with the Depart
ment of Public Works in regard to the
matter, and reports that the estimated
cost of the work would be $302,000, a
greater sum than the company can
now secure. When Paul Shoup, presi
dent of the Peninsula Railway, re
turns from the East, a counter pro
posal will be made or the question will
be considered for the removal of the
tracks.
