# Shoeless Stanford Man Treads Market Street To Horror of Natives
## 
### 
Something new under the sun!
A Stanford student, meticulously
dressed, but wearing heavy wool socks
in place of the customary shoes,
strides down Market Street and into
a restaurant. Apparently unaware of
the stares he draws, he seats himself
at a table, and carelessly orders a re
past. Having satisfied his hunger, he
swings aboard a car, and rides to the
Southern Pacific station, where he
climbs aboard the train to Stanford.
No, no, he is perfectly sober. His
gait is absolutely straight. The ex
planation? It is this: Having played
a game of soccer in shoes too small
for him, he finds at the end of the
contest that he is unable to put his
footgear back on. Consequently his
only recourse is to the wool socks,
tvhich he luckily has on hand â€”or
should it be said, on foot?
