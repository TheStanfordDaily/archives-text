# LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHTS MEET BEAR QUINTET IN CHAMPION CLASH
## 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound quintet will play
their second game of the championship
series against the fast and experienced
Bear quintet promptly at 7 o'clock to
night in the Pavilion.
Although the Bruins have defeated the
Card squad once during the season, the
Stanford team is expected to put up a
stronger opposition in tonight's game.
As a result of training under Coach
"Husky" Hunt, the squad now begins to
look more like a real aggregation of
basketball players than they did earlier
in January. The Cards entered the first
California contest with scarcely any
previous practice and played their first
game of the schedule against the Berke
ley five.
California's men are more or less ex
perienced players, while the Stanford
five is composed of practically new mem
bers, playing together for the first time.
Steffan and Cornell will start at the
forward berths, Grace at center, and
Paul O'Hara and Eggleston at guards.
