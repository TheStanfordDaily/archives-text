# BABE NINE SWAMPS HAYWARD, 11 TO 0
## 
### William Wright 
After a two-weeks' baseball starva
tion on account of rainy weather the
babe baseball team sharpened their
teeth on nine scared men from Hay
ward High School Saturday afternoon
and sent them home with an 11-to-0
score to explain.
The Hayward outfit displayed the
most promising brand of frightfulness
since the invasion of Belgium, and the
Stanford coaching staff discovered that
the 1926 brand of baseball is just
about up to standard.
The babes are a systematic bunch of
fielders, they hit well, and they think
fast. And, judging from the single
example of the pitching staff which
was on exhibition, they have that as
well.
So far as the game goes, it wasn't
such a much. Ditzler fanned thirteen
Hayward hopefuls, which was unlucky
enough for the prep schoolers, and is
sued three safe blows just to keep the
dink infield on edge.
The bright moment of the afternoon
for the visiting nine came with a dou
ble play which cut the Cardinal scor
ing down to three tallies for that in
ning.
Outside of that the high men went to
bat and came away, caught the ball
and threw it, and comported them
selves with the listless demeanor na
tural in a team which is a work-out for
a better bunch, and knows it.
The yearlings, however, were work
ing away with marked success. Love
lace drew a base on balls to open the
season, and, with two away, Lee Ayde
lott bumped him along with a hard-hit
ball which bounced off the Hayward
pitcher's shin for a single. Smith
strolled up to the plate and scored
Aydelott with another single, but died
on first. Two runs in the first â€”enough
to win, but the frosh were starved.
After standing behind the plate
while three Hayward men fanned out,
Kohler, the babe catcher, waved his
night-stick at one of the enemy offer
ings in the second period and hoisted
the ball beyond left field for the long
est hit of the day. He stopped on third
until Ditzler dropped a bunt along the
first base line and then worked the
squeeze to perfection, Ditzler beating
the throw to first.
A base on balls to Lovelace and
safeties by Lucas, Draper, and Green
put the babes three runs further from
defeat. Seven to nothing at the end of
the second.
In the fourth Draper, who played a
great game at first, made a trip around
the sacks as a guest of the Hayward
team. After this the babes fooled along
until their last time at bat, when they
added three units to their total on the
strengh of four safe blows and a flock
of errors. Hayward went out one-two
three in the ninth.
