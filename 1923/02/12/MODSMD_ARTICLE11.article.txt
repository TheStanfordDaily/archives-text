# SEAT SALE TOMORROW FOR KNIGHTIE-KNIGHT
## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Seat drawings for Knightie Knight,
the 1923 Ram's Head offering, will be
held in the Administration building
tomorrow at 1 p. m. The prices will
be $1.40 and $1.10.
Knightie Knight is not, as the name
might imply, a bedroom farce. It is
not even a straight burlesque, as many
of the past Ram's Head shows have
been, but it is a successful attempt to
combine straight comedy of situation
with the grotesque and fanciful. In
parts the revue is closely approached;
yet the show never oversteps that
boundary.
In keeping with the change in gen
eral character of the production is the
change in song types. The foxtrot is
the exception rather than the rule, yet
there are enough catchy syncopations
to relieve the atmosphere when occa
sion demands it. The ballad type of
song is introduced most extensively,
for example, "Sir Gavador," sung by
Chet, Hess, and "Inn of the Golden
Horn," sung by a double quartet of
i "knights."

The latter song, according to predic
tions of those who have heard it, is
due to be what is technically called a
knockout.
Those who have ever seen an Eng
lish foxhunt will thrill again to the
call of the bugle, the tramp of the
horses, the barking of hounds, and the
shouts of the riders, just as Act Two
comes to a close. The whole perform
ance is reproduced with deadly ac
curacy on the limited space afforded
by the campus stage, and it is rumored
that a trained fox has been secured at
great expense for the scene. Although
the latter rumor could not be con
firmed, yet is was not denied, which
makes it a perfectly good rumor.
The futuristic and the mysterious s
have been combined in the opening of
the show. The first five minutes are
especially devised to Avaken the audi
ence from the trance occasioned by
paying the admission price, and tc
leave them in a proper frame of mind
for the surprises to come. Of which, by
the way, there are a number.
