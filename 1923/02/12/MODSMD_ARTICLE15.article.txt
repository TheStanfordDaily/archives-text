# STUDENTS' STAND ON HAZING PRAISED BY UNIVERSITY TRUSTEE
## 
### 
The following letter from W. Mayo
Newhall, member of the Board of Trus
tees was received by President Wilbur,
who turned it over to the Daily Palo
Alto:
February 9, 1923.
My Dear Dr. Wilbur:
My attention was directed this morn
ing to an article in the San Francisco
Chronicle, concerning the attitude of a
very respectable number of upperclass
men toward the practice of hazing fresh
men. This attitude toward the discon
tinuance cannot be too highly commended.
That the abolition of hazing should have
been taken up by the students them
selves, and in the spirit of student con
trol is also to be highly commended.
I will not at this time enter into any
discussion of the pros and cons of the
practice of hazing. I do not hesitate,
however, to express myself as a non
supporter of that practice.
I am expressing these opinions, not in
the spirit of paternalism as a trustee of
the University, but I am rather express
ing them as an old University man, who
in the sometime long ago, was thor
oughly familiar with student life, and in
having kept in touch with student life
ever since.
It would be a gratification to feel that
the practice of liazing was abolished at
Stanford by the students themselves.
This stand will, I believe, in the eyes
of the college world, insure to the benefit,
advantage, and dignity of Stanford Uni
versity.
Very sincerely,
(Signed) W. MAYO NEWHALL.
