# WHY THE TIME WAS RIGHT
## 
### 
The agreements made by the sophomores of En
cina and Sequoia, followed by the resolutions of the
freshman class intended to abolish compulsory
methods and to tide over the needs of the present
situation came at a time when a new system was
ripe for introduction.
With a freshman dormitory a mere matter of
months in the future, the present problem was pretty
much settled, anyway, but an effective substitute to
meet the coming situation needed to get a start at
once in order that it might be on its feet next year.
The chief value of the sponsor system lies in the
fact that by personal touch the freshman is given a
broader view and is given a chance effectively to ap
ply ideas which he brings with him. It is the best
possible method of diverting freshman energy into
the proper channels instead of having it expended
in fighting and hating a system of force.
When the entire freshman class is housed under
one roof, the point of view of the freshman as a type
cannot help but be greatly changed. He knows that
he must live with this organization for a full year,
and the friends that he makes here are to be the
ones with whom he is to work throughout his col
lege career. He is at once given a chance to stand
on his own feet and to develop according to the
measures of his environment. Here will start true
class spirit and constructive work toward weaving
the fabric of undergraduate life.
It is at that point that the introduction of the
sponsor system will have its greatest effect in broad
ening the point of view and assuring a desirable con
tinuity of student thought and action. Here by the
proper methods of advising and co-operating, the
upperclass sponsors will be able to wield a powerful
influence for good. They may by advisory means
not only direct but lead. Upon the personnel of the
sponsors will depend in a large measure the effective
ness of the new method.
The Mentor system, which is in itself nothing
more than advisory tutoring, should work hand in
glove with the sponsor system and help to solve
many of the scholarship problems which now con
front undergraduates. To carelessness and igno
rance of the methods of study as freshmen most of
those who have been disqualified in the past may
point with assurance as the original cause of trouble.
They dropped so far behind in their first quarters
that they were unable to make good as sophomores
and juniors.
Undergraduates and gymnasium officials are now
working out a method of keeping in touch with ath
letes through the offices of the Physical Director and
the Graduate Manager. With the development of
the Sponsor and Mentor systems, this check will
prove to be of additional value, for it may immedi
ately refer freshman athletes who are low in scholar
ship back to both their instructors and their spon
sors. And if freshmen are thus cared for, it will
be only a matter of a year or two when the whole
system will depend upon that one class, for fresh
man athletes who make good in their first year sel
dom fall into scholastic error in later quarters.
It has been held in these columns that certain
changes should be made in the scholastic point sys
tem because it works hardships in individual cases.
It is still the belief of undergraduates that such is
the case, but the fundamental trouble does not lie in
faculty administration but in undergraduate methods
and their lack of system. Given a little time under
the new regime, we may readily see where we stand
and will thus be able to propose such changes as
seem necessary to bring disqualification to its mini
mum. We may never achieve perfection, but we
may at least come so close to it that consequent
arguments will be of the hair-splitting type.
Stanford undergraduate life now hangs in the
balance with a choice of two ways to land; on its
back in retrogression; or on its feet in progress.
Surely, any action which comes from within the un
dergraduate body will be one calculated to put Stan
ford solidlv on its feet.
