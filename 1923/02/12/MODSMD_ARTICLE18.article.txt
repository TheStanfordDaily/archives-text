NUMBER PLEASE?
This, gentle readers, is the Unknown Number. Num

wonder. But Thunder, a blunder is nothing to wonder

EDITORIAL.
Have you a telephone voice? Do people like to hear
you talk over the phone? Or do you get that tired
feeling in your voice that makes them glad to hang up?

Sorry, "Ever Green," shorter contributions are wanted

STANFORD'S U. S. C. VICTORIES
CHEER CAL TEAM, SAYS WRITER
San Fran, Cal.: Jesse Jacks, prominent sporting writer
for the S. F. Bull, today stated in an interview that the
Cal team was highly pleased with the moral victory
they had won by having Stanford defeat U. S. C.
When asked for details, he refused them in a lengthy
statement to the press, in which he said that nothing
had pleased Cal more than the moral victory which had
resulted when the Stanford team defeated U. S. C.
However, as he had said that before, nothing much was
gained by the statement but Cal students are sure that
Cal won a moral victory by having Stanford defeat
U. S. C.
(Editor's note: These signed articles by prominent
sporting writers are invlauable to the sporting world.
Nothing could be fairer than the above and it is a well
known fact that there is no more unprejudiced body of
men in the world than the sport writers for some of our
nearby papers. Keep it up, Jesse, the home folks are
behind you!)
