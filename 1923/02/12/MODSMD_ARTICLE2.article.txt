# FRESHMEN VICTORS OVER LOWELL HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMERS
## 
### 
Defeating Lowell High School by a
52 to 16 score the freshmen swimmers
won their first dual meet of the season
last Saturday morning in the Encina pool.
The dinks started out by winning the re
lay in fast time and allowed the San
Francisco swimmers only one first place
in all the remaining events.
Captain Wally O'Connor was the big
man of the day, winning the 50, 100 and
220 yard events without much visible ef
fort. His time in the 220 yard swim was
2:45 1-5, more than six seconds under
the Stanford-California freshmen record
for that distance. O'Connor also swam
on the winning relay team.
The diving was a close contest between
Smith and King, both freshmen. In the
judges' decision Smith was awarded first
place by a fraction of a point. These
two men have been working all year un
der Coach Brandsten's tutelege and ac
cording to him should have no trouble in
taking two places in the California meet.
Lowell took her only first place when
Hanley succeeded in nosing Hablutzel out
at the finish of the 100-yard breast stroke
by a scant few inches. Hablutzel led for
the first two lengths.
Stanford took three places in the 100-
vard swim. Captain O'Connor took it
easy and t won in 1 :05 time. Carlsmith
and Allen came in second and third re
spectively.
Next Saturday the freshmen paddlers
will meet Oakland high school here.
