California won the opening game of
the intercollegiate basketball series
with Stanford Saturday night at Har
mon gym, Berkeley, by a 20-14 score.
The Bears maintained a lead from the
start. During the first half both teams
seemed to be playing under a strain
and as a result the passing was loose.
The score at half-time was 10-8 for
the Blue and Gold.
Displaying the best baseball seen on
the varsity diamond this season, Stan
ford defeated St. Mary's Saturday by
a l-0i score. The freshmen took the
San Jose High School delegation into
camp by the same count in the first
game of the double-header.
"There is no Japanese immigration
problem on this coast," declared Pro
fessor P. J. Treat in his lecture in the
Union Sunday night. "The whole prob
lem of race immigration to this coun
try from Japan was settled in 1907,
when President Roosevelt entered into
a gentleman's agreement with the
island country."
Stanford's ice hockey team held its
last practice game yesterday in pre
paration for the big game with Cali
fornia Friday evening at Tait's Winter
Garden Ice Palace in San Francisco.
This will be the first struggle of its
kind ever engaged in by the Cardinal
and Blue and Gold.
Varsity swimmers exceeded even
Coach Brandsten's expectations last
Saturday when they defeated the
speedy Piedmont Club team from Oak
land by the score of 44-32. Fast times
were made in nearly all the events.
The visitors were hampered by the
cold, fresh water to which they were
unaccustomed, but expected to win
without any trouble.
Pine Cottage, the historic relic of
the old days of the Stanford ranch, has
been removed to make way for the
new Library. Pine Cottage was one
of the earliest buildings on the estate,
being erected as the Frenchman's Ken
nels. Later, when the present Quad
was under construction, it was used
as the architect's headquarters.
