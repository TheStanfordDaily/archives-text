Dear Sir: An announcement of a
meeting of Phi Lambda Upsilon to be
held Tuesday evening at 7:15 in the
Union was written out in the Daily Palo
! Alto office and handed to one of the peo
ple working there at 2:15 Monday after
noon. It did not get into the paper that
evening. The process was repeated Tues
, day at about the same time. Again no
results. As a consequence, we had no
meeting.
Evidently there is room for improve
i ment here. Why not have a box in the
office with paper and pencil handy, in
which announcements can be placed, and
collected later by a responsible person?
!As it is now no one holds himself re
! sponsible for the fate of these items. This
occasion is not the first on which one of
our announcements fell by the wayside.
Yours sincerely,
W. E. S.
Editorial Note: It shall be done. But
remember that the deadline for copy is 1
o'clock. Service after that hour cannot
;be expected to be of the best, for re
| aponsibility for the day is over. It will
; help us in many ways if students realize
that any copy turned in after the early
morning hours always serves to retard
j our press time.
