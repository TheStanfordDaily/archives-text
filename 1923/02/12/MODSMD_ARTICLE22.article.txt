Dear Sir: I think that the thanks of
! the alumni body should be extended to the
'sophomore ckiss for their sensible action
i in going on record as against this hazing
| custom in the future.
I look back with very great pleasure
to five years spent at Stanford from 1597
to 1902, when we had no college rushes
at all nor any hazing cxcept in very mild
form. The trouble with hazing in a mild
form is that it leads to a more unre-
I
j stricted practice. In any event there can
be no question that during the period I
mention the University included in its
undergraduate body some of the best men
that have ever attended Stanford. This
condition existed without permitting of
jcollcge rushes or of hazing of the char
| acter that has been permitted in recent
years and which has come to the attention
...
! of a number of the alumni with consid
erable surprise and equal apprehension.
Let us hope that that character of
treatment of the University students will
! no longer be tolerated on the campus.
(Signed) FRANK ENGLISH.
