Dear Sir: I have read with great
pleasure the newspaper accounts of the
| student action relating to the matter of
; freshman discipline. My observations in
and about the University recently have
convinced me that this was a very per
nicious and unjustifiable custom. I wish
:to congratulate the students upon their
very efficient and successful efforts in ef
fecting a discontinuance of the practice
through co-operative methods.
