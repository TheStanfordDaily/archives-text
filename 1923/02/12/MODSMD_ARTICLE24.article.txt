# Frisky Person Seeks Religion; Gets Boot
## 
### 
The service was being conducted
in the usual manner. A frisky-look
ing personage came down the cen
ter aisle. He continued to the front
and seemed undecided as to where
to locate himself for the morning.
The ushers came to his aid, but
the individual had contrary notions
and dashed hither and thither
among the pews. He was finally
trapped and captured although he
put up a mean fight. He was unable
to explain in his foreign tongue
that he wanted religion, so he
braced his feet, and was dragged
shamefully up the aisle to the front
doors and thrown out.
It is not uncommon for the clique
of airedales, mongrels, and com
mon curs to matriculate and attend
eight o'clocks regularly. But when
they decide to round off a college
education by going to church â€”well,
Jack, a spirited fox-terrier, tried it
in the Memorial Church yesterday
morning. The ushers couldn't ap
preciate his intentions so he was
thrust bodily out into the some
what cold world.
