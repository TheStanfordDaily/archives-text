# EL CUADRO, THETA XI WIN HOOP CONTESTS
## 
### 
El Cuadro defeated the Encina Hall,
third floor, team 14-12 and Theta XI
won from Encina Hall, fourth floor,
team, 9-3, Friday night in the last two
games in the fifth round of the intra
mural basketball tournament.
Sewell's Shooting Forces El
Cuadro to Play Hard to Win
The El Cuadro team with its two
star forwards missing had to keep
alert during the whole game in order
to win from Encina. At no time were
they headed, but the score was so
close throughout the contest that a
basket by the opposition would have
tied the count. With the exception of
Sewell on the Encina team no one
showed particular basketball ability.
The ball was rushed from one end
of the floor to the other and many
futile shots were made under each
basket. But neither side could produce
the man to loop the ball through the
hoop when right under the goal.
Dribbling was not clever enough to
get the ball [>ast the guards and
neither team had much of a passing
game. Several pretty shots from the
side of the floor made the contest in
teresting.
Burkhard started the scoring with a
long shot for El Cuadro. Sewell fol
lowed with two for Encina and the
score mounted up, Sewell making all
but one basket for his team while
Burkhard and Kelley did the shooting
for El Cuadro. Burkhard, by his guard
ing, passing, and shooting, kept his

team in the lead. Kelley scored often
on shots passed to him as he stood
under the goal.
Mulchay and Follansbee Show
Speedy Dribbling for Theta Xi
Theta Xi cinched their game with
Encina Hall, fourth floor, team by
making three field goals in the second
half after trailing during part of the
game. The contest was close but little
fast play was shown.
Mulchay and Follansbee made all of
the Theta Xi points, each caging two
shots. Their speed on the forward line
enabled them to get past their oppon
ents' defense and several more shots
would have been chalked up had they
not been hurried.
Blacker and Otis entered the scor
ing column for Encina, the latter being
responsible for the field goal.

making three field goals in the second
half after trailing during part of the
game. The contest was close but little
fast play was shown.
Mulchay and Follansbee made all of
the Theta Xi points, each caging two
shots. Their speed on the forward line
enabled them to get past their oppon
ents' defense and several more shots
would have been chalked up had they
not been hurried.
Blacker and Otis entered the scor
ing column for Encina, the latter being
responsible for the field goal.

third floor, team 14-12 and Theta XI
won from Encina Hall, fourth floor,
team, 9-3, Friday night in the last two
games in the fifth round of the intra
mural basketball tournament.
Sewell's Shooting Forces El
Cuadro to Play Hard to Win
The El Cuadro team with its two
star forwards missing had to keep
alert during the whole game in order
to win from Encina. At no time were
they headed, but the score was so
close throughout the contest that a
basket by the opposition would have
tied the count. With the exception of
Sewell on the Encina team no one
showed particular basketball ability.
The ball was rushed from one end
of the floor to the other and many
futile shots were made under each
basket. But neither side could produce
the man to loop the ball through the
hoop when right under the goal.
Dribbling was not clever enough to
get the ball [>ast the guards and
neither team had much of a passing
game. Several pretty shots from the
side of the floor made the contest in
teresting.
Burkhard started the scoring with a
long shot for El Cuadro. Sewell fol
lowed with two for Encina and the
score mounted up, Sewell making all
but one basket for his team while
Burkhard and Kelley did the shooting
for El Cuadro. Burkhard, by his guard
ing, passing, and shooting, kept his

team in the lead. Kelley scored often
on shots passed to him as he stood
under the goal.
