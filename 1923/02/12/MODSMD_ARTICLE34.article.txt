lighting spirit marked the come-back of
the Stanford 145-pound basketball team
when they defeated the highly-touted
1 California quintet, 18 to 17, in the Pa
vilion last Friday night.
Ted Steffen, Card forward, ran wild
in both periods and chalked up thirteen
points for his team. The Berkeley guards
had difficulty in locating him.
Fumbles were missing through the con
test. Both teams used a passing' game
and five-man defense to good advantage.
The first half was all Stanford's,
j Steffen gave the light heavies an early
lead after shooting two field goals in
rapid succession. Grace, Stanford guard,
broke up the Berkeley offensive con
sistently.
The Berkeley forwards attempted long
; shots after a failure to penetrate the
Cardinal defense, but did not profit by
I their trials.
Four additional points by Steffen, and
a field goal by Cornell put Stanford
j ahead in the first half. 12 to 6.
Tn the second half the Card 145's in
creased their lead to seventeen, and there
the scoring ceased until Steffen shot a
foul goal in the last few remaining
: minutes.
Tn the third quarter California gradu
j ally increased their score from 8 to 16.
The two teams are tied for honors
with a game cach. and will clash again
Saturday to decide the winner of the
| series. Tt is uncertain to date where the
game will be played.
