# CARD NINE DOWNED BY BANKERS, 9-1
## 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Stanford's baseball varsity made a
run on the French-American Bank of
San Francisco Saturday afternoon on
the varsity field, and might have come
away with the prize of all diamonds.
But the Bankers awoke with wrathful
vengeance after seven innings of nip
•and-tuck play, routed their rivals, and
chalked up the win themselves.
The Cards outslugged the visitors
seven pelts to five, but ragged field
work and inopportune hitting gave
them the light end of a final 9-1 score.
The San Franciscans proved their
aptitude in the principles of exchange
for things were pretty nearly even for
seven innings. Though Stanford had
made six hits to the Bankers' three,
both had broken into the scoring col
umn with but a single run. Solomon
was going great on the mound for the
varsity and had struck out five men.
He was more than holding his own
against the great Bill Bahr, who will
heave for the Portland Coast Leaguers
this season.
Then something happened. The cause
is somewhat of a mystery. The Bank
ers found Solly for three bingles, and
the Stanford infield joined in the fes
tivities with a nice contribution of
four errors. The Cards were mighty
glad when the last two spasms were
over.
Here's how it all happened—
Two men were down. Irilarry walked
and stole second, going to third on
Heckendorf's error. Harrigan reached
first, made a theft of the second bag,
and followed his predecessor over the
plate on Muchay's faux pas. Marko
witz was safe on the keytsone sack.
Baldocchi connected with the pellet
for a double which resulted in another
run. He trotted over the rubber him
self on Fuller's foozle.
The ninth inning started with the
score 5-1 against the Cards. Jim Clark,
who had supplanted Solomon on the
mound, had a hard time getting
started. He walked Bahr; Clark was
safe on first through a fielder's choice;
none were down.
Ravoni singled, Irilarry doubled, and
then —the inevitable error. Two more
markers were chalked up for the vis
itors. Markowitz poled out a one-base
pelt, and crossed the platted on Be
chelli's two-bagger. The next three
were easy outs but the damage was
done.
Stanford made one run during the
game. That happened in the first stan
za when Woodward opened with a
single, and advanced to third on Bahr's
overthrow to first. Heckendorf came
up to the plate,-and drove "Bud" in
with a single.
Stanford is scheduled to meet the
Federal Reserve Bankers of San Fran
cisco on the varsity field this after
noon at 3 o'clock.
