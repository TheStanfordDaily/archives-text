# CARDINAL FIVE IS DOUBLE VICTOR IN SOUTH; NOW LEADS RACE FOR PACIFIC COAST CHAMPIONSHIP
## Squad Wins First Game From U.S.C. by 17 to 13 and Takes Second Tilt After Extra Periods 
### 
In the words of Harry B. Smith, sporting editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle, day by day in every way, the chances of the Stanford basketball
varsity of winning the Pacific Coast Conference championship grow brighter
and brighter.
Friday and Saturday in Los Angeles, the Cardinal five made a clean sweep
of their series with the University of Southern California and now the Blue
and Gold quintet from the University of California remains as the only
obstacle for Coach Andy Kerr's players to face.
On a strange court and playing in adverse conditions, the Stanford teams
lived up to its reputation of being one of the scrappiest fives that has worn
the Cardinal jerseys for some time, nosing out the Trojans in the last few
minutes in the first game and carrying the last game to four extra five-minute
periods in order to establish its superiority.
In the first game in Los Angeles, playing an uphill game, the Stanford
five captured the contest by a 17-to-13 score. In the second game, the struggle
ended in a tie with each team being credited with eighteen points. After

playing twenty extra minutes, the
Cardinal quintet triumphed over the j
U. S. C. aggregation by a score of 24 ;
to 21.
In both games, the Trojans were
leading at half time, the Southerners
exhibiting a stronger defensive game
than was shown at Stanford a week
before. McHose on account of his work J
in the first series was a marked man
in the opening game of the southern j
series and was closely guarded
throughout this contest, most of his
markers coming by way of the free
throw route.
In this game, Bob Janssen, Fred
Anderson, and McHose formed the of
fensive for the Cardinal squad while
the Trojans, although they scored four
field goals, seemed to lack an offensive
punch. Charley Bone, who had previ
ously shown himself to be a dangerous
player at all angles of the court, was
given but little chance at the basket
by the Stanford guards and the best
that he could contribute to the U. S. C.
score was one field goal.
The second game of the series was
probably one of the closest that has
been played in Pacific Coast Confer
ence basketball for many a year.
Neither team held a definite lead at
any stage of the contest. At half time,|
the Trojans were leading by one point
only to have the score tied at the end
of the game.
In the first extra five minutes played
in order to break the tie, neither team
scored and another five minutes had
to be played. In this, the Trojans
caged a field goal only to have the
count again tied by the Cardinals be
fore the time was up, and again an
other period was called for.
The third extra period went much
the same as the first with neither
team being able to score the extra
point which would decide the game.
With about a minute left to play in
the fourth and last extra period of
play, a foul was called on Steele who
had taken Janssen's place at center
which gave the Southern team a lead
of one point. It was then that the
Cardinal offense came to life. Steele
managed to poke in a basket in a
scramble with the Trojan guards un
der the goal and then, aided by some
clever passing by Rogers, Nip McHose
dropped in another counter just as the
timer's gun ended the game.
