ball team lost the second and deciding
game, the Cardinal freshman basket
five in Harmon Gym Saturday night by

the Card yearlings were able to score
but two field baskets, one by Carter
and one by Nevers, both in the first

Frazier scored five points for the
Stanford freshmen, on free throws,
out of six attempts. His two free ones
