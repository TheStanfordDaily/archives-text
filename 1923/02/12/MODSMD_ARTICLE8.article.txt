# CUB FIVE DEFEATS HUNT'S TEAM 29-9
## Butts Stars for California Freshmen; Hunt's Quintet Completely Outclassed 
### Don Liebendorfer 
Outclassed, out-fought, and out
played in every department of the
game, the Cardinal breshman basket
ball team lost the second and deciding
game, the Cardinal freshman basket
five in Harmon Gym Saturday night by
the score of 29-9.
After the first ten minutes, the out
come of the fracas was never in doubt.
Davis and Carver, Cub guards, had
Nevers and Frazier completely at their
mercy, while Butts and Holmes played
circles around McDermont and Mitch
ell. So tight was the Cub defense that
the Card yearlings were able to score
but two field baskets, one by Carter
and one by Nevers, both in the first
half.
Butts, star California freshman for
ward, scored twenty of the Cubs'
twenty-nine points on nine field
and a pair of free ones.
The Card babes seemed unable to
fathom the Cub style of offense and
the guards were drawn out of the way
almost every time to give Butts an
opportunity from side-court.
Frazier scored five points for the
Stanford freshmen, on free throws,
out of six attempts. His two free ones
were the only points his team made in
the second half.
For a very short time at the opening
of the game, it looked as if the spec
tators were to be treated to another
battle royal such as the teams put up
in the first fracas, two weeks ago.
Davis, Cub running guard, who was
easily the fastest man on the floor,
opened hostilities by sinking one. Nev
ers evened things with a pretty shot
from the center of the floor. Both
teams were fighting hard for the ball,
and the guards were doing effective
work.
At this time, Butts started stuffing
the basket, and by the end of the
game, he had filled it to overflowing.
He broke the tie by sneaking one past
McDermont.
Prazier made a free one and the
Card babes trailed 6-3. Butts again
eluded his guard and sunk another one
under the hoop, 8-3. Carver, Cub stand
ing guard, dribbled the full length of
the court and made it 10-3.
Frazier added a point for Hunt's
team and Butts came through with
another one. That made the score 12-4.
Carter got the Cardinal yearlings' last
field goal, from under the basket, 12-6.
Just for variety's sake, Butts added
a pair of free ones and the half ended
with the California freshmen on the
heavy end of a 14-6 score.
.With the beginning of the second
half, the Cubs had things pretty much
their own way, outplaying the Card
inal babes man for man, and feeding
Butts, who lost few opportunities to
boost the score.
The star California forward caged
a pretty one to start the half off, and
Frazier sunk two free ones, 16-8. He
brought the score to 20-8 by sinking
two more in rapid succession. Higgins
tipped one in from under the basket,
and Gibson, who substituted for
Holmes, got a free one. Butts and
Davis each caged one, bringing the
count to 27-8. Frazier added the last
point to the Card babes' total on a
free one and Butts scored a pretty
shot just as the game ended.
