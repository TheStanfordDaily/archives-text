# OLYMPIC CLUB GIVES VARSITY SOCCERITES SERIES' FIRST DEFEAT
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity suffered its
first defeat of the season to the Olympic
Club team on the varsity field Saturday
afternoon by the score of 3 to 2. Coach
Maloney's eleven retains its hold on first
place, however, and appears to have the
inside track toward the league cham
pionship.
Both teams set a fast pace most of the
time. The final minutes of play were
marked by the desperate efforts on the
part of the Cards to even the score, and
on three occasions they missed goals by
scant inches.
The Olympic Club opened up with a
strong offensive, which gave them the
first score of the game, after three min
utes of play. The varsity evened the
score, however, when Quigley shot the
ball into the net a few minutes later.
The remainder of the half was score
less and was marked by listless play on
both sides. The varsity appeared to be
unable to develop the all-round class and
teamwork which has carried it to many
victories this year. Several times the
Cardinals came close to scoring and
twice the ball skimmed over the Olympic
Club goal.
The Olympic Club opened the second
period with another clever offensive and
temporarily outplayed the Stanford team.
Loney, Olympic full, centered the ball
immediately in front of the Stanford
goal and Balmain kicked it in. Another
goal was scored by Balmaine a few min
utes later.
The varsity came to life when Clark
scored a goal after a sudden flourish on
the part of the Cardinal forwards, seven
minutes before the end of the game.
Stanford staged a spectacular come
back in the last few minutes and in their
turn outclassed the visiting aggregation.
With only a few minutes to go, the
forwards carried the ball down to the
Olympic Club goal four successive times.
Once it was kicked over the goal,
again it hit the goalpost and in the last
minute of play it was booted about by
two Stanford forwards and two Olympic
Club players within a few feet of the
goal that meant much to Stanford hopes.
The whistle cut short this rally before it
was successful.
The Winged "O" players have more
teamwork and aggressiveness than any
other eleven encountered by the Cards
this year. They had added several star
players since their defeat by Stanford
last quarter. The Cardinal forwards
were erratic and did not show their usual
speed and accuracy.
Rice, inside left, scored the Olympic
Club's first goal, and Balmain, center
forward, their second and third. Bill
Shakespeare, center half, helped to worry
the Card. The line-up was:
