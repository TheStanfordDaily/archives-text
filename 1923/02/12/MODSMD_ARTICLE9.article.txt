# OLYMPIC CLUB GIVES VARSITY SOCCERITES SERIES' FIRST DEFEAT
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity suffered its
first defeat of the season to the Olympic
Club team on the varsity field Saturday
afternoon by the score of 3 to 2. Coach
Maloney's eleven retains its hold on first
place, however, and appears to have the
inside track toward the league cham
pionship.
Both teams set a fast pace most of the
time. The final minutes of play were
marked by the desperate efforts on the
part of the Cards to even the score, and
on three occasions they missed goals by
scant inches.
The Olympic Club opened up with a
strong offensive, which gave them the
first score of the game, after three min
utes of play. The varsity evened the
score, however, when Quigley shot the
ball into the net a few minutes later.
The remainder of the half was score
less and was marked by listless play on
both sides. The varsity appeared to be
unable to develop the all-round class and
teamwork which has carried it to many
victories this year. Several times the
Cardinals came close to scoring and
twice the ball skimmed over the Olympic
Club goal.
