# VARSITY QUINTET WILL MEET BRUINS TOMORROW NIGHT
## Cardinal Varsity Favorite in First Game of Series; Bears Have Erratic Team 
### 
Stanford's basketball varsity will
meet the University of California tomor
row night in Harmon gymnasium at
Berkeley in the first game of a series
that will decide the winner of the south
ern half of the Pacific Coast Conference
and the right to meet the northwestern
Half of the Conference.
So far this season the Californians
have shown that they have one of the
most erratic quintets of many years and
while at times they have exhibited bril
li.int basketball, they have been given
many setbacks by teams that have lost
to the Cardinal squad.
In two of their games witli the Uni
versity of Southern California, they
practically overwhelmed the Trojans and
left no doubt in the minds of the spec
tators as to their supremacy. In the
ether games, their play was poor. So
poor, in fact, that it was hard to believe
that it was the same combination that
had won on previous nights.
The Cardinal squad returned yester
day from the south, after two trying
games with the Trojans and although
none of the players suffered injuries in
the series, they need rest badly. Coach
Andy Kerr is probably the worse off for
the trip and yesterday afternoon he was
confined to his home with a slight attack
of "flu." Only a light practice was
given the squad last night and this aft
ernoon. they will spend most of thefr
time in warming up and running through
a light signal practice.
Stanford has to win only two of the
four games with the University of Cali
fornia, while the Blue and Gold will
have to make a clean sweep of the series
if they expect to make the trip north
tliis year. In the north, the standing's
are fairly even with the University of
Washington leading at present. Many
upsets have taken place and thfe Oregon
Aggies and the University of Washing
ton squads have both lost more than one
game.
At the first of the year, it looked as
though the University of Idaho, cham
pions of 1922, would repeat again this
year. However, a disastrous trip put
them out of the running. The Vandals,
nevertheless, are going to have a big
say as to who the winner of the north
ern half of the Conference will be, as
shown by their easy defeat of the Uni
versity of Washington squad last Sat
urday at Moscow.
