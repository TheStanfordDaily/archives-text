The Phi Kappa Psi-El Tigre contest
to decide the victor in League 3 will be
played Thursday in Encina Gym at
5 p. m.
The referees for these games will be
C. M. Douglas and D. A. Garner, an out
side man being engaged for the final
contest.
In the only game played yesterday, the
Breakers defeated the Japanese Club,
20-6. With the same offensive and de
fensive strength that forced the Beta
Theta Pi team to the limit last week, the
Breakers had little difficulty in breaking
through the Japanese Club guards to the
basket. Peavy led the attack and made
five field goals in the first half, increas
ing his total by tw<* more in the final
period. Lowenstcin, his running mate at
forward, shot two goals from the floor,
but the most effective combination was
the pass to Peavy under the basket.
The Breakers showed a good brand of
basketball and displayed plenty of team
work and a fast passing game. Masters
and Coverly at guard prevented the
Japanese Club forwards from getting
close to the hoop and Sano was the only
one on his team to score from the floor,
slipping two goals in by some fast work.
