# Thirty-Six Granted Awards at Assembly
## Wilbur Stresses Participation Of Freshmen in Activities 
### 
"If Stanford would win games of the future, we must develop the latent
ability of the incoming freshmen each year and develop it promptly. You
men will determine the athletic future of the University by your treatment of
the incoming classes —by helping to make men rather than sheep of them."
These words of Dr. Wilbur, voicing the modern idea of a freshman's relation-
I ship to student activities, were the substance of his speech which followed

Daves, '20, and A. D. Cohan, 21.

| international connection, this prize,
> awarded annually in the debate between
Stanford and California, by Baron de
Coubertin, is the debating classic of the
! year,' said Mr. Owens. "Mr. Miller is
the first Stanford man to win this debate
since 1918."
Edward Landels, '23, received a de
• hating fob for his work in the contest

i In discussing student activities, Dr.
> Wilbur spoke as an alumnus, rather than
• as president, "Every student ought to
have a margin of capacity. Outside ac
l tivities require a great deal of time—
. add to this the problem of men and
. women who must work their way
r through collcge, and even with this
( margin, there is no time left to waste.
We expect from an educated man or
. woman one who makes his time count.
[ 1 have an ideal for this institution which
r is shared by every alumnus; namely,
, that it shall be a place where young men
, j and women can come and he full-fledged
. citizens."
