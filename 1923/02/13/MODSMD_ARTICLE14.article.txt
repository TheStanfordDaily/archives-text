# RADIO CLUB LECTURE TO BE GIVEN TONIGHT
## 
### 
Gerald M. Best will talk to campus
radio fans in Room 334 of the Geology
building tonight at 7 :30, under the aus
pices of the Stanford Radio Club. His
lecture was first announced for last Tues
day; some lantern slides that had been
ordered were not ready in time, how
ever.
Best has not stated the exact subject
of his talk, but it is understood that he
will describe several radio devices and
give his audience detailed accounts of
recent achievements in radio art and
engineering.
