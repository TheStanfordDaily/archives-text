ALASKA AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE—Reports from the ice-floes in
dicate that the basketball team at the
Alaska Agricultural College is made
up of three brothers representing one
hearth-stone and a pair of twins from
another fireside. Every once in a while
some family steps out and monopolizes
the athletic world, leaving little or
nothing to those unfortunate beings
who sprang from other family trees.
And this strange circumstance is the
best example of clannish spirit since
Tim and Mike Callahan gathered in
the Princeton and Yale football cap
taincies in the same year. Family dif
ferences must be forgotten, however,
as the team has defeated every other
aggregation in the Alaskan interior.
Alaska Aggie is further north than any
other college in the world.
