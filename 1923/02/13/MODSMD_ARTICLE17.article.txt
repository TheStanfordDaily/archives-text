# A 						GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE

When freshmen are all housed together in one
dormitory, when the sponsor system is in effect, and
the proposed dormitory system is functioning ac
cording to the most optimistic predictions, who is
going to take the place of freshmen in living groups?
Sophomore discipline. Sophomore duties. Did
you ever hear of either? This is only a hazard, a
guess in passing. There is no more reason for
sophomore discipline than there is for freshman dis
cipline. But a feeling ingrained in college men that
underclassmen should perform the more or less un
pleasant domestic duties may give rise to a new and
wholly unexpected system. If any such storm cloud
is approaching from the horizon of the future, it
should be included in the perspective of the present.
If any such system is likely to creep into existence
unheralded and unwanted as that which has just
passed from the campus, students should begin to
think of it now —to suggest measures that will keep
Stanford clear of such problems. We don't want it.
And if there is a concentration and continuity of
student sentiment in that regard, the problem will be
largely solved before it is encountered.
