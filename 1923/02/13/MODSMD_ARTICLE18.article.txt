# FROLIC FIENDS
## 
### 
Dances in mad succession; car rides in untold
numbers; city trips without end: queening- without
regard for time, place, or girl : card parties and dice
games to the limit; liquor, lounge and limousine
combined in a grand galaxy of pleasure that has no
thought of the future. Who but a well-known East
ern editorial writer said that the "ocean of frivolity
had gained advantage on the shores of the curricu
lum." He was right. The tide is up.
The rubber sole is replacing the football cleat;
fifty-two cards in a deck are wasting the fifty-two
weeks of the year; the dance has entered into com
petition with the gymnasium; and San Francisco
offers more attractions than the campus. Student
activity is as inclusive and as wide-spread as ever
before. But it is not the kind that Stanford needs.
"Society," in its narrowest sense, is with us.
To whom does this apply? To the students in
general. What awful orgies have brought on this
attack? None in particular and all in general. No
names need be mentioned. The trend is as plain as
the nose on one's face. The bun-duster and the tea
hound are increasing in numbers. Fingers point to
ward Stanford as a "finishing school." Let us re
verse the order of march.
This is an old, misshapen, down-at-the-heels shoe.
Tt has never seen |>olish and needs none. It may and
ought to cause bunions and blisters. It's that kind
of a shoe. But if it fits you, wear it.
