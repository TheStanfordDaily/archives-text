(With apologies to one of the dead parents).
"Waffle, waffle," sighed the wind, mournfully through
the window,
Like a lonesome bird before the storm.
The table gleamed white like a marble slab.
There was something on the Slab . . .
Was it ... a fourth dimension?
A pipe-fitter's handkerchief?
A piece of burlap that had been fried?
. . . I moved away: the table was round and green.
Ah . . . there was that Thing again;
The orange chintz curtains flapped, dismally,
Like a widow's weeds.
"Waffle," moaned the wind through the window.
"Waffle," it whispered.

MARY
Oh, what a queen was Mary,
What a wonderful girl was she,
I queened her one night,
By the lake held her tight,
And she snuggled up to me.
I thought that I'd play with Mary,
And not let her play with me,
But there lies the joke,
For I've poison oak.
All over my face, you see!
