# DIAMOND DUST
## 
### 
Just when the varsity diamond was
beginning to get in good workable
condition so that the men could play
around without getting water-soaked
and mud-bespattered, it rained again.
The condition of the field was so bad
yesterday afternoon, that the sched
uled game with the Federal Reserve
Bankers of San Francisco had to be
called off.

The relative strength of Stanford's
and California's nines might have been
compared for the first time this year
if the Cards could have clashed with
%
Kenealy's Seals tomorrow as per
schedule. Kenealy's went over to
Berkeley and tried their stuff on the
Bruins. When the dust had cleared
away in the ninth, however, they found
themselves buried under an avalanche
of hits and runs. Stanford might have
accomplished the same trick —but the
diamond will be too wet tomorrow,
Graduate Manager Bill Fletcher thinks,
so the game has been postponed.
♦ * *
The Seals nosed out the Cards last
year, 4-3, in an eleven-inning nip-and
tuck fight. The score stood at 1-all up
to the eighth when the Cards rallied
and took a 3-1 lead. The Seals came
back in their half of the ninth and
deadlocked the count again. Nothing
happened in the tenth, but in the elev
enth, the San Franciscans managed to
squeeze across the winning tally.
The past three games that the var
sity has played—the Jefferson Club,
Ambrose Tailors, and French-Ameri
can Bank —may be said to constitute
the Cards' preliminary season. The real
baseball program for the year will
start this coming Saturday when the
Olympic Club will send its Winged-0
slabsters down from the Foggy City.
The following week, Cliff Ireland and
his crew of Independents will visit the
J Farm for the thirty-first time. Cliff
has always received a ready welcome
and his brilliant side-line talk has
given him a reputation that cannot be
surpassed. On March 3, the series with
St. Mary's will begin. Then there will
be games in rapid succession with the
Saints, Santa Clara, U. S. C., and
California.
Coach Wolter started a different
lineup in the game with the French-
Americans last Saturday. Mulcliay,
Follansbee, Lawson, and Edwards all
got a chance to show their wares. Wol
ter was pretty much peeved at the
way his men acted in the last two
frames of that game, for he considered
they should have won. Eight runs were
marked up for the Bankers in two
innings, and most of them were due
to the slippery paws of the Stanford
infield.

around without getting water-soaked
and mud-bespattered, it rained again.
The condition of the field was so bad
yesterday afternoon, that the sched
uled game with the Federal Reserve
Bankers of San Francisco had to be
called off.

The relative strength of Stanford's
and California's nines might have been
compared for the first time this year
if the Cards could have clashed with
%
Kenealy's Seals tomorrow as per
schedule. Kenealy's went over to
Berkeley and tried their stuff on the
Bruins. When the dust had cleared
away in the ninth, however, they found
themselves buried under an avalanche
of hits and runs. Stanford might have
accomplished the same trick —but the
diamond will be too wet tomorrow,
Graduate Manager Bill Fletcher thinks,
so the game has been postponed.

The Seals nosed out the Cards last
year, 4-3, in an eleven-inning nip-and
tuck fight. The score stood at 1-all up
to the eighth when the Cards rallied
and took a 3-1 lead. The Seals came
back in their half of the ninth and
deadlocked the count again. Nothing
happened in the tenth, but in the elev
enth, the San Franciscans managed to
squeeze across the winning tally.
The past three games that the var
sity has played—the Jefferson Club,
Ambrose Tailors, and French-Ameri
can Bank —may be said to constitute
the Cards' preliminary season. The real
baseball program for the year will
start this coming Saturday when the
Olympic Club will send its Winged-0
slabsters down from the Foggy City.
The following week, Cliff Ireland and
his crew of Independents will visit the
J Farm for the thirty-first time. Cliff
has always received a ready welcome
and his brilliant side-line talk has
given him a reputation that cannot be
surpassed. On March 3, the series with
St. Mary's will begin. Then there will
be games in rapid succession with the
Saints, Santa Clara, U. S. C., and
California.
Coach Wolter started a different
lineup in the game with the French-
Americans last Saturday. Mulcliay,
Follansbee, Lawson, and Edwards all
got a chance to show their wares. Wol
ter was pretty much peeved at the
way his men acted in the last two
frames of that game, for he considered
they should have won. Eight runs were
marked up for the Bankers in two
innings, and most of them were due
to the slippery paws of the Stanford
infield.
Just when the varsity diamond was
beginning to get in good workable
condition so that the men could play
around without getting water-soaked
and mud-bespattered, it rained again.
