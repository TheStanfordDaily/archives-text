# "Knightie Knight" Will Follow On Heels of Fridag Afternoon
## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Friday night is Knightie Knight.
By that time Director Bayley will have completed the tying of the show
into a synchronous whole, and knights and ladies, hero, villain, grandma, and
even the spoiled child, Angeline, will be ready for their introduction to the
campus theatrical world.
And by that time Clyde Coakley and his group of fellow artists, or, as they
are technically known, stage hands, will have completed the settings for all
three acts, and they will be ready for the gaze of the assembled throng.
Speculation is rife as to which song will be the "hit." "Inn of the Golden
Horn," by Malaby; "Just Susie," by Higby, and "Tally Ho," also written by
Malaby, are the three from which the winner is supposed to emerge. The
three songs are typical of the different types in the show. "Inn of the Golden
Horn" is sung by a double quartet, and is by far the most finished piece of
music in the show. "Just Susie" is typical of the clever fox-trot with catchy

lyric, and, as sung by Gene Trago,
ought to get over even better than his
"Late Again" of the Football Show.
"Tally Ho" closes the second act, and
is the lively number which spices the
fox hunt scene.
Although it is rather early in the
game to comment on the plot, yet be it
said that, while being perfectly harm
less, it has plenty of action to keep the
characters moving, and the audience
interested in their moves.
The story is built around the awak
ening of Sir Gavador, medieval knight,
in a modern English society atmos

. phere, and the three acts carry him
through the lives of many people
which he affects strangely, as would
be expected of a chivalrous gentleman
of the age of King Arthur.
The villain is circumvented by his
aid; the hero attains his beloved
through his chivalrous deeds; even
the spoiled child is tolerated by the
knight.
And when all is said and done, the
original statement stands unchal
lenged.
Friday night is Knightie Knight.
