## AUTOMOBILE SECTION SAN FRANCISCO SHOW WILL OPEN SATURDAY 
### EDITED BY JACK GRAVES 
San Francisco's seventh annual Pa
cific Automobile Show will open in the
Exposition Auditorium Saturday night.
Those in charge promise that it will
be second In size and importance only
to the recently held New York and
Chicago shows.
Every large automobile dealer in
California has signified his intention
of exhibiting, and a small army of men
is working day and night to get the
displayes and decorations ready for
the opening.
Motor cars, motor trucks, and motor
accessories of every description will
be there. The newest models of the
eastern factories, which were last on
displays and decorations ready for
brought direct to San Francisco. Prices
will range from just a few hundred
dollars for the more popular types of
cars to the thousands that will be
asked for some of the aristocrats of
the motor world.
The auditorium will be decorated to
represent the interior of a Chinese
temple, and a suitable color scheme
and designs will have been worked
out; impassive Buddhas will gaze un
smilingly on the mechanical toys of
the present day.
