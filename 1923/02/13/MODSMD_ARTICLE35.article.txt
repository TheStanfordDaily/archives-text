# Yellow Peril Strays From Straight and Narrow Path
## 
### 
The yellow match-box careened and
cavorted from one side to the other.
Its journey was a perilous one. The
occupants remembered the peculiar
antics of Toonerville's world-famous
trolley, wondered if this was one of
its relations, and hoped for the best.
Suddenly, the car took a beautiful
broad jump—it literally sprang into
the air. When it came down it was off
the rails.
Bewildered, the passengers gathered
themselves together and meandered
up the aisle to the front entrance. The
Red Peril's little sister —the Yellow
Peril —had jumped the tracks at Uni
versity Junction!
The accident happened late yester
day afternoon and it was some time
before the car was put back on the
rails and in running order again. Mean
while, students bound to and from the
campus had to transfer from one car
to the other at the junction point.
