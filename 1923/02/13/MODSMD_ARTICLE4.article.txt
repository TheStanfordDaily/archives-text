# Card and Bear Weight Quintets to Play for Championship Tomorrow
## 
### 
California and Stanford light-heavy
weight basketball teams meet in the
Harmon Gym, preliminary to the Var
sity-U. C. contest tomorrow night, to
decide the winner of the light-heavy
weight series.
The team that beat the Bears 18 to
17 in the Pavilion last Friday night
was a vastly improved aggregation
from the half-organized group that lost
to the Bruins two weeks prior.
Under the able tutelage of Coach
"Husky" Hunt the Stanford men have
developed a strong defensive and of
fensive.
Steffen proved in the last game that
he could put the ball through the hoop
when the occasion arose. His shooting
was certainly much more accurate in
the game Friday night than any he has
displayed in recent contests.
Grace, who caused the Berkeley for
wards so much trouble during the last
game, has the makings of a good de
fensive player. Grace and O'Hara both
functioned according to Hoyle in the
first half of the last game.
With two able centers, Logan and
Pigott available, the light-heavies
have little to worry about in filling
the pivot position.
Perhaps their only handicap will be
the lack of efficient substitutes to re
place the first string men when the
latter show signs of slowing down.
Substitutes seem to be California's
chief asset. By replacing men in the
second half of last Friday's game, the
Bears were able to come back strong,
and catch up on the large lead the
Cards had rolled up in the first period.
Substitutes might prove a deciding
factor in tmorrow's contest.
