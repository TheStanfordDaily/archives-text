# WAR COLLECTION HAS NEW GERMAN LEAFLETS
## 
### 
A classified collection of a thousand
handbills and leaflets that appeared in
Germany and in the streets of Berlin
on November 9, 1918, has recently
come into the Hoover War Library.
A complete story of German inter
nal affairs from 1918-1922, including
the history of the Kapp rebellion in
the spring of 1920', can be gathered
from some carefully chosen and sorted
street propaganda that appeared dur
ing this later period and which is in
cluded in this collection.
All the political parties in Germany,
socialistic, bolshevistic, and lower
class groups, published numerous bills
for distribution at the first rumor of
an armistice. In the series, there are
leaflets recruiting men for the new
Germany army, announcing national
assemblies, and discussing peace terms
and the disposal of territory that the
Allies wished to take from Germany.
Examples of the economic, ecclesi
astical, and educational publicity that
was scattered everywhere are given.
