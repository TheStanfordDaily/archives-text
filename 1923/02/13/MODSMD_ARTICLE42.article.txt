# News Writing Class Makes Visit to Chronicle Plant
## 
### 
Members of Professor Everett Smith's
news writing class made a tour of inspec
tion of the San Francisco Chronicle's
plant Saturday afternoon at the invita
tion of the heads of the newspaper.
The group was shown through the com
posing room, stereotyping department,
and the pressroom so that they could view
the multiple operations involved in pub
lishing a metropolitan newspaper.
Begbie Fowler, '06, business manager
and assistant publisher of the Chronicle,
was editor of the Daily Palo Alto while
a student at Stanford.
