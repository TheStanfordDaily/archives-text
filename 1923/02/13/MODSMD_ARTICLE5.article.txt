# Herman Knoche, '99, Gives Research Work to Library
## 
### 
Herman Knoche, '99, who received his
B. A. degree in botany, has given a copy
of his publication, "Flora Balearica," to
the Library. This book, in two volumes,
is a botanical catalogue of flora of the
Balearic islands, which are in the Medi
terranean sea. Knoche is now connected
with the botanical gardens in Montpellier,
France.
A set of two volumes that originally
belonged to the private library of Glad
stone, the great English statesman of
the last century, has been purchased by
the Library from an English second
hand dealer. The book, "Nichoils* Re
flections," or recollections of the reign
of George Third, contains Gladstone's
engraved bookplate.
