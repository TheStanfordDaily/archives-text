# W.L. SCHWARTZ WILL EXPLAIN SATSUMA ART
## 
### 
Genuine Satsuma potteryâ€”the se
crets of its manufacture, and its rela
tion to the philosophy of Japan
I through the ancient tea ceremonial
i will be explained by William L.
i Schwartz, instructor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages, in an
i illustrated lecture this evening at 7:30
I in the Little Theater.
"Satsuma has never been properly
| understood by critics," says Mr.
Schwartz. "In feudal days the province
of Satsuma enforced strict secrecy re
garding all activities within its bor
ders, and in later times the peculiar
dialect of pottery workers 011 that
island has increased the difficulty of
appreciating their art."
Mr. Schwartz will describe briefly
the history and development of this
pottery manufacture, but he intends to
devote most of his talk to present-day
examples of Satsuma ware, much of
which is mere imitation of the true
! article.
Real Satsuma, according to Mr.
Schwartz, embodies the Japanese
artistic philosophy of life. If the clay
is not technically perfect, coarse deco
ration is employed, but when it is of a
superior quality, it is ornamented with
intricate designs which make the ob
ject a work of art.
Sixty naturally-colored slides pictur
ing various phases of the pottery
work, and examples of fine Satsuma
; tea sets, such as vases and incense
burners, will be shown on the screen.
Some of them belong to Mr. Schwartz's
| private collection, and have been ex
hibited in several museums.
