# TEAM IS IN GOOD SHAPE FOR HARD KNIGHTIE KNIGHT
## Team-Work and Record Time Is Expected from Ram's Headers by All Supporters 
### CARL SHOUP, '24 
With all the Ram's Head athletes in
good condition, and the track in fine
shape, the campus is preparing to see
some fast time Friday night, when the
"Knightie Knight" team hooks up with
the General Circumstances squad in the
big annual winter indoor track and field
match in the Assembly hall.
Coach Arnold Bayley says that the
whole squad is tuned up to do its best,
and judging from the practice events
that have been run off so far, this is en
tirely true, without a grain of falsehood
in it. The chorus team did some good
stepping last night in a couple of the
long-distance events. Besides showing
a good stride and excellent judgment at
the finish, everyone demonstrated a
sound wind that enabled them to come
into the last lap without a falter.
It is in the sprints that the most ex
citement is looked for, however. Fox
does the ten-yard dash in four flat (feet).
The take-off seems to bother him the
most, but the coach plans to have a pack
of trained bloodhounds on hand to assist
him in starting. (Eastern coaches please
copy.) Some of the rushes off-stage are
due to be spectacular in their speed, and
extra-ply tape is being ordered for the
finish line.
Through the field events the Cardinal
should show up to the best advantage.
Chet Hess will carry a majority of the
weights around with him all evening.
The scene-shifter are due to come
through with some good lifting, and
have been conditioning on a careful diet
for the past two weeks in order to put
forth the supreme effort Friday night.
Each event will be run off in its ac
customed place, according to the Dra
matic Track Council. Records are
looked for in every event except the
hammer throwing, which it is trusted
will not be very prevalent. No outside
competition from the spectators is re
quested in this matter, as usually the
nervous knees of the new cast members
do all the knocking that is required.
The judges' stand tickcts went on sale
yesterday at a minimum of $1.40. There
are, however, still plenty of good seats
available close to the finish line for those
who wish to get them. Timekeepers,
hurdle-setters, announcers and other offi
cials will be selected later.
Coach Bayley is adhering strictly to
the rule of secret practice, which has
proven so successful in the other ath
letic events of the year.

into the last lap without a falter.
It is in the sprints that the most ex
citement is looked for, however. Fox
does the ten-yard dash in four flat (feet).
The take-off seems to bother him the
most, but the coach plans to have a pack
of trained bloodhounds on hand to assist
him in starting. (Eastern coaches please
copy.) Some of the rushes off-stage are
due to be spectacular in their speed, and
extra-ply tape is being ordered for the
finish line.
Through the field events the Cardinal
should show up to the best advantage.
Chet Hess will carry a majority of the
weights around with him all evening.
The scene-shifter are due to come
through with some good lifting, and
have been conditioning on a careful diet
for the past two weeks in order to put
forth the supreme effort Friday night.
Each event will be run off in its ac
customed place, according to the Dra
matic Track Council. Records are
looked for in every event except the
hammer throwing, which it is trusted
will not be very prevalent. No outside
competition from the spectators is re
quested in this matter, as usually the
nervous knees of the new cast members
do all the knocking that is required.
The judges' stand tickcts went on sale
yesterday at a minimum of $1.40. There
are, however, still plenty of good seats
available close to the finish line for those
who wish to get them. Timekeepers,
hurdle-setters, announcers and other offi
cials will be selected later.
Coach Bayley is adhering strictly to
the rule of secret practice, which has
proven so successful in the other ath
letic events of the year.
With all the Ram's Head athletes in
good condition, and the track in fine
shape, the campus is preparing to see
some fast time Friday night, when the
"Knightie Knight" team hooks up with
the General Circumstances squad in the
big annual winter indoor track and field
match in the Assembly hall.
Coach Arnold Bayley says that the
whole squad is tuned up to do its best,
and judging from the practice events
that have been run off so far, this is en
tirely true, without a grain of falsehood
in it. The chorus team did some good
stepping last night in a couple of the
long-distance events. Besides showing
a good stride and excellent judgment at
the finish, everyone demonstrated a
sound wind that enabled them to come
into the last lap without a falter.
