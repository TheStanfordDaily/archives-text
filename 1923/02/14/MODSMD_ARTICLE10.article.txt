Praise of the active student body for

and an explanation of the new campaign
is contained in a letter issued today by
President Wilbur. The letter follows:
"1 he attitude of the active student
body of the University has been a con
stant source of inspiration and stimulus
to the alumni. We realize that the stu
dent is ordinarily not in a position to
contribute large sums to the endowment
fund. Our particular desire is to have
the co-operation, even in a small way, of
all of those who bear the name of Stan
ford in the effort to obtain additional
endowment. We want to give every
student a chance to be a part of this first
movement on behalf of Stanford.
