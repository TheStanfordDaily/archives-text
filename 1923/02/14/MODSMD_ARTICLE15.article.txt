## 
### 
Why Paris should set the styles for
American women no one knows. And
furthermore no one has seemed to
care, for usually the French are quite
successful In their commercial sense'
of beauty. The vogue for pale, wan
cheeks enlivened by scarlet lips on 1
fair mademoiselle, has passed. The
change has reached the Coast already !
and Stanford women have been quick
to recognize it. Note what one may see
on any promenading week-end day.
Rouge is applied in light, flesh tdYies
and little net veils are being worn
half way over the face. The veils are
small affairs attached to the hat, and
extend just below the eyes. Browns |
and blacks are the most popular colors,,
the browns ranging from tannish flesh
to deep tones.
