# BETAS, DEKES AND ENCINA FIRSTS WIN
## Intramural League Play Is Nearing Close, Alabaster Stars for Beta Theta Pi 
### 
Beta Theta Pi defeated Phi Gamma
Delta 18-6 last night and advanced to
the final contest with Delta Kappa
Epsilon tomorrow night without a de
feat. Delta Kappa Epsilon was also a
victor yesterday, winning from Encina
Hall, second floor, 19-1. Encina Hall,
first floor, team took their game from
Breakers 9-4 and the Japanese Club
won by forfeit from Alpha Delta Phi
in the other games scheduled for last
night.
The Beta Theta Pi-Phi Gamma Delta
contest showed up particularly the
strong teamwork and offensive
strength of the Beta Theta Pi team.
Alabaster at forward caged four field
goals during the game and Granger
made two more while the pair manoeu
vered the ball around the court and
looked for an opening to the basket.
Proctor snared two goals from his
running guard position, playing in
much better form than last week when
he jumped at ccnter. Few fouls were
called and the game progressed much
faster than the score might indicate.
Both teams showed considerable
speed but the Beta Theta Pi players
had possession of the ball most of the
game. Their dribbling and passing
showed the results of careful practice
and serious efforts and the men gave
a finished exhibition of basketball
which marked them as ready for their
final league game today. The Phi
Gamma Delta players put up a good
fight but were never able to head their
opponents who swept all before them.
Delta Kappa Epsilon showed a su
perior brand of teamwork in their
game "with Encina Hall, second floor,
team and easily defeated them 19-1.
The game was more even than the
score would indicate and the Encina
men threatened the Delta Kappa Ep
silon goal time after time, but no one
of their forwads was able to make the
throws count. The ball was rushed
back and forth on the court during
most of the first half but just before
the whistle F. L. Fuller and Steffen
successfully worked out an offensive
play byAtfiich they could get the ball
under thebasket and tally. In less
than two minutes, Fuller had rung up
five field goals on passes from Steffen
who followed him up.
The game was not particularly fast
but a rush by Delta Kappa Epsilon
usually resulted in a goal. Steindorf at
standing guard put u pthe best game
for Encnia, his close guarding of the
basket preventing many shots and
hurrying most of the attempts for
counters.
Encina Hall, first floor, team sur
prised the Breakers last night and de
feated them 9-4. The Breakers' players
fought hard but, without the services
of Peavy and Masters who formed a
strong part of the attack in former
games, they were unable to compete
with the Encina team which outplayed
them throughout the game. .Harlow
was the only one on the Breakers'
team to tally, his two goals accounting
for all of their score. Stillman and
Blacker worked well together for En
cina and, by a fair display of team
work, dribbled and passed the ball into
position to make three field goals. Grif
fln kept Loewenstein well guarded and
prevented him from scoring a single
shot from the floor.
Both Alpha Delta Phi and the Jap
anese Club are out of the running in
League 1 so the game forfeited to the
Japanese Club yesterday had no effect
on the league standing.

work, dribbled and passed the ball into
position to make three field goals. Grif
fln kept Loewenstein well guarded and
prevented him from scoring a single
shot from the floor.
Both Alpha Delta Phi and the Jap
anese Club are out of the running in
League 1 so the game forfeited to the
Japanese Club yesterday had no effect
on the league standing.
Today's games will finish the league
schedules. They are: Delta Kappa Ep
silon and Beta Theta Pi, 5 p. m.; Phi
Gamma Delta and Alpha Delta Phi,
5:40 p. m.; Encina Hall, first floor,
and Encina Hall, second floor, 8 p. m.
Beta Theta Pi defeated Phi Gamma
Delta 18-6 last night and advanced to
the final contest with Delta Kappa
Epsilon tomorrow night without a de
feat. Delta Kappa Epsilon was also a
victor yesterday, winning from Encina
Hall, second floor, 19-1. Encina Hall,
first floor, team took their game from
Breakers 9-4 and the Japanese Club
won by forfeit from Alpha Delta Phi
in the other games scheduled for last
night.
The Beta Theta Pi-Phi Gamma Delta
contest showed up particularly the
strong teamwork and offensive
strength of the Beta Theta Pi team.
Alabaster at forward caged four field
goals during the game and Granger
made two more while the pair manoeu
vered the ball around the court and
looked for an opening to the basket.
Proctor snared two goals from his
running guard position, playing in
much better form than last week when
he jumped at ccnter. Few fouls were
called and the game progressed much
faster than the score might indicate.
Both teams showed considerable
speed but the Beta Theta Pi players
had possession of the ball most of the
game. Their dribbling and passing
showed the results of careful practice
and serious efforts and the men gave
a finished exhibition of basketball
which marked them as ready for their
final league game today. The Phi
Gamma Delta players put up a good
fight but were never able to head their
opponents who swept all before them.
Delta Kappa Epsilon showed a su
perior brand of teamwork in their
game "with Encina Hall, second floor,
team and easily defeated them 19-1.
The game was more even than the
score would indicate and the Encina
men threatened the Delta Kappa Ep
silon goal time after time, but no one
of their forwads was able to make the
throws count. The ball was rushed
back and forth on the court during
most of the first half but just before
the whistle F. L. Fuller and Steffen
successfully worked out an offensive
play byAtfiich they could get the ball
under thebasket and tally. In less
than two minutes, Fuller had rung up
five field goals on passes from Steffen
who followed him up.
The game was not particularly fast
but a rush by Delta Kappa Epsilon
usually resulted in a goal. Steindorf at
standing guard put u pthe best game
for Encnia, his close guarding of the
basket preventing many shots and
hurrying most of the attempts for
counters.
Encina Hall, first floor, team sur
prised the Breakers last night and de
feated them 9-4. The Breakers' players
fought hard but, without the services
of Peavy and Masters who formed a
strong part of the attack in former
games, they were unable to compete
with the Encina team which outplayed
them throughout the game. .Harlow
was the only one on the Breakers'
team to tally, his two goals accounting
for all of their score. Stillman and
Blacker worked well together for En
cina and, by a fair display of team
work, dribbled and passed the ball into
position to make three field goals. Grif
