# STANFORD-BEARS TANGLE TONIGHT AT HARMON GYM
## Californians, If Right, Will Give Cards a Good Battle; Coach Andy Kerr Has 'Flu' 
### 
California's varsity quintet will have
to play their best brand of basketball
tonight at Harmon gymnasium if they
expect to carry away the first game
of the Blue and Gold-Cardinal series.
From comparative scores and the
rating of the two teams at present,
the dope favors the Stanford aggrega
tion over the California five in their
first contest, but dope does not usually
mean anything. Stanford has had a
hard schedule during the past two
weeks and the playing of practically
three halves last Saturday night was
asking quite a bit of the endurance of
a team.
California, on the other hand, with
the exception of the Olympic Club
game last Friday, has had some time
in which to rest up for tonight's strug
gle.
The biggest possible loss that the
Cardinals will have against the Bruins
will be Coach Andy Kerr. Following
the return of the team from its south
ern invasion, Kerr has been confined
in bed with an attack of "flu" and it
is very doubtful whether the doctors
will allow him to accompany the team
to Berkeley tonight. Dudley DeGroot is
the only member of the regular squad
that will be missing at Berkeley, the
husky standing guard being in the hos
pital at present with a bad cold. Jimmy
Davies, captain of the 1922 Cardinal
varsity, will handle the team in the
absence of Coach Andy Kerr.
The Blue and Gold squad this sea
son has been very eccentric. At times,
they play like topnotchers while on
other occasions, they appear com
pletely disorganized. If they play in
the latter condition tonight, the Card
inal squad should have little trouble
in disposing of their opponents. If they
are at their best, it is only a matter of
whether the Cardinal defense is
stronger than the Bruin offense.
Comparative scores of the teams
this year show that when right, the
Blue and Gold quintet has a powerful
offense but their defense is not so
good. Teams that the Stanford five
have held to a low score, have been
able to run up a fairly large count
against Coach Wight's team. On the
other hand, the entire California of
fense seems to be built around O'Neill
at center and Talt at forward with
Talt accounting for most of the points.
If the Cardinal guards can stop these
two men, they practically have the
game won.
Nip McHose will be relied upon to
do most of the scoring for Stanford
with Janssen and Fred Anderson con
tributing their allotment. Melrose was
closely guarded in the Trojans series
last week and although he was given
little opportunity, what chances he did
get proved disastrous to the U. S. C.
squad.
Coach Earl Wight will probably
start Talt and Houvenin at forward
against the Cardinals tonight with
O'Neill at center. Thompson and Cap
tain LeHane will play the guard posi
tions. Wight is fortunate ni having a
good number of substitutes and such
players as Douhitt, Belasco, and Kin
caid to fill in are a big asset to the
squad.
