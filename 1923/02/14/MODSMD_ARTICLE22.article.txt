						BOW IN CLOSING

### 
Tomorrow Ken Stewart, by virtue of unanimous
election, becomes editor of the Daily. The present
editorial regime has served its time and soberly
watches the office boy file Volume 62 with the other
sixty-one. Another editor has been goose enough to
sing his own swan-song.
People frequently want to know what the editorial
policy of the Daily is. The Daily has none. It can't
have one. If it did, there would be no use for an
editor, for he is the person who decides what the
stand of the student newspaper shall be on student
body issues. There is seldom any continuity in the
editorial regime in a college publication and for this
reason, the Daily, as such, has no definite ideals.
But the editorial board for the past half-year has
had what it called its "policies."
It has been the desire of the outgoing regime
above all else, not to mold student opinion, but to
crystallize it—to get students to TIIINK. The un
dergraduate body does not realize its power, does
not consider its potential influence. Taken as a
whole, it has been dormant, depending upon what
we choose to call "leaders" for their expressions of
opinion and their constructive thinking. If the stu
dent body should suddenly awake to its possibilities
with every member of it actively at work on its prob
lems, the burdens of responsibility now resting on
an overworked few would be distributed to the ulti
mate benefit of all concerned. We would far more
rapidly approach that undergraduate Utopia for
which many strive but none will ever reach.
In a lesser way, the present editorial board has
stood for the abolition of freshman discipline, the
reorganization of underclass rushes, the distribution
of activities over a greater group and the centraliza
tion of organizations. It has at times used sledge
hammer methods, admittedly cheap from a journal
istic standpoint, but necessary to get an audience.
The immediate result has been animosity and bitter
ness, but the ultimate result has usually been
THOUGHT.
The outgoing regime has asked for less emphasis
of social activity, which is closely connected with
the abolition of the student-owned automobile. It
has urged the adoption of more careful methods of
bringing men to Stanford and more co-operative
methods in keeping them here. And finally, it has
tried to look a little way into the future to suggest
ways of meeting problems that must be encountered
there; the new housing system, the freshman dormi
tory, and the effect of present situations, if not im
proved, upon college generations in that time.
A half-year is an infinitely small time for one
group which directs the policies of a paper to accom
plish much. Hence, gun-powder and dynamite have
brought on accusations of "Hearst methods." A
campaign of gradual education is not possible in
eighty days. And, after all, it will be the good things
that will live, if there are any. If not, all will be
forgotten.
In its last editorial, the outgoing board wants to
make one last plea. It wants the average student to
believe that the only real Stanford men and women
are those who were themselves while they were in
college; to look upon the undergraduate who does
things because other people did them as a mimic, not
as a typical Stanfordite. It is the individual who
does his own thinking, who follows the dictates of
his own conscience, who has the courage of his con
victions, and who gets up and frankly fights for
what he thinks is right in the face of odds, who is
the Stanford man undergraduates seek to be. It will
prove to be a fruitless pursuit for those who chase
the wraith of Stanfordism at the end of a Rainbow
of Tradition. That which glitters there is not gold.
The gold is in the man himself.
Here the editor takes his coat off the hook and
meets Stewart coming in the door to hang his coat
in the same place. And as the ex-editor clatters
down the stairs, he mumbles to himself, "If 'Stew'
docs no more than to say what he thinks, he will be
the best editor who ever draped his coat over that
thirtv-year-old nail."
