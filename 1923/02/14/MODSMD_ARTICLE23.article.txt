# CABBAGES AND THINGS H.M. '24

With the breathless amusements of the present day,
the student of the present iB apt to take no notice of
the times when the Powell Street Cowboys wore chain
mail. It is with a serious purpose, then, that Cabbages
offers a Jim Crow section for the Dark Ages.
THE OLDEN TIMES
Published on Feb. 29 by Les Temps, Berlin, Gy.
"The Romans were struck with the long beards of the J
Franks and called them Lombards."—6ooo years ago. i
Whereupon our poet strings his lyre and starts lying.
Hear now of the Franks, the barbarous Franks,
Who rejoiced in their whiskers and wine;
They had wonderful beards, they were bottomless tanks,
But the Romans considered them swine.
They insulted the Franks, the long-suffering Franks,
So the Franks planned the downfall of Rome —
And they soaked in cement every beard in their ranks,
And they galloped away from home.
The long-whiskered Franks, the cement-whiskered Franks
Went about smiting Rome on the head —
And the women and kids piled the Romans in banks
Who'd been struck with their beards and were dead!
• * *
Those ancient Huns were sons-of-guns—
They had no savoire-faire;
They took our lives and stole our wives
When they went on a tear.
• * ♦
Queen Isabella has hocked another diamond. It. is
rumoured that C. Columbus is the lucky guy.
* * *
In the dull Middle Ages they had no Pantages,
The Orplieum yet was a dream;
There was 110 Midnight Frolic, no dread Lip-stick Colic,
But hear how they let off their steam.
They went on long journeys, they held bloody tourneys,
Which they fought with large axes —not cards.
And when they got tired, they went out and fired
The homes of unpopular bards.

Elaine, the Lily Maid of Astolat,
Fell hard for Launcelot, who left her flat,
And so the dead, oared by the dumb, came up
To Camelot, where Launce, the dirty pup,
Crawled underneath the Table Round, where once he'd
sat.
There's that!

THE MIDDLE AGES—BETWEEN MARRIAGE AND
DIVORCE.

Elaine, the Lily Maid of Astolat,
Fell hard for Launcelot, who left her flat,
And so the dead, oared by the dumb, came up
To Camelot, where Launce, the dirty pup,
Crawled underneath the Table Round, where once he'd
sat.
There's that!

THE MIDDLE AGES—BETWEEN MARRIAGE AND
DIVORCE.
With the breathless amusements of the present day,
the student of the present iB apt to take no notice of
the times when the Powell Street Cowboys wore chain
mail. It is with a serious purpose, then, that Cabbages
offers a Jim Crow section for the Dark Ages.
THE OLDEN TIMES
Published on Feb. 29 by Les Temps, Berlin, Gy.
"The Romans were struck with the long beards of the J
Franks and called them Lombards."—6ooo years ago. i
Whereupon our poet strings his lyre and starts lying.
Hear now of the Franks, the barbarous Franks,
Who rejoiced in their whiskers and wine;
They had wonderful beards, they were bottomless tanks,
But the Romans considered them swine.
They insulted the Franks, the long-suffering Franks,
So the Franks planned the downfall of Rome —
And they soaked in cement every beard in their ranks,
And they galloped away from home.
The long-whiskered Franks, the cement-whiskered Franks
Went about smiting Rome on the head —
And the women and kids piled the Romans in banks
Who'd been struck with their beards and were dead!

Those ancient Huns were sons-of-guns—
They had no savoire-faire;
They took our lives and stole our wives
When they went on a tear.

Queen Isabella has hocked another diamond. It. is
rumoured that C. Columbus is the lucky guy.

In the dull Middle Ages they had no Pantages,
The Orplieum yet was a dream;
There was 110 Midnight Frolic, no dread Lip-stick Colic,
But hear how they let off their steam.
They went on long journeys, they held bloody tourneys,
Which they fought with large axes —not cards.
And when they got tired, they went out and fired
The homes of unpopular bards.
