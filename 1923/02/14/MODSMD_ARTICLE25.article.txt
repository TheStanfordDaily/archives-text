February 14, 1917

Two burglars entered the Alpha Phi
house at 2:45 this morning and got
away with money and jewelry. They
made their entrance by cutting a hole
in the screen of the back porch and
climbing through it. Two rooms were
raided before anyone became aware
of the fact, but when one of the men
entered the room of the house mother,
she screamed, and the burglar rushed
for the door and downstairs.

English Club and Masquers, in ven
turing to put Galsworthy's "Justice"
on the Assembly Hall stage, are giving
this play its second production in
America, and its first amateur produc
tion anywhere. "Justice" fooled New
York's most eminent dramatic authori
ties. Six theatrical managers refused
to book the play, but the seventh dared
to produce it, and a phenomenally suc
cessful season's run resulted.

Following frequent warnings, the
Men's Student Council today an
nounced the suspension of a senior
student and a junior student, both for
indefinite periods, for objectionable
conduct at campus dances while under
the influence of liquor.
