Ernst Brandsten is being sought by the
| Olympic Club. (S. F. papers.) What is
Stanford's answer to this? Are the stu
dents once again going to circulate peti
tions asking the powers that be to retain
a competent man?
Right now we shall have to decide
whether Student Government in the Stan
ford Democracy takes a live and active
part in Stanford affairs, or whether we
act as we have done on previous occa
sions, agreeing without any real knowl
edg of the decisions of other local bodies.
Ernst Brandsten has made his decision.
He says,"I believe I can do more to
promote and encourage water sports by
developing college men than by coaching
seasoned stars," but
We hesitate for a moment. Ernst
Brandsten has reached the end of the rope
at Stanford. He has been successful in
producing teams of such caliber that the
present swimming budget of $1100 will
not even suflice to provide local competi
tion. We actually give less than 3 per
cent of the incidental fees for one quarter
towards keeping swimming alive here at
Stanford for a year.
Perhaps you have seen Ernst Brand
sten performing his daily duties. He does
everything possible to see that swimming
gets the most out of what little money is
available. It seems to me that if we can
finance $450,000 dormitories that surely
we can make some provision for keeping
the pool and equipment in repairs. Under
the present system, Ernst Brandsten per
forms all these duties himself in order
not to cut down the swimming budget.
He needs money to send a water polo
team, of proven caliber, to Chicago. Al
bert White has to make a trip to New
York this spring to defend his title.
The swimming team should tour the
south during the spring vacation in prep
aration for the dual meet with California.
A trip to Sweden this summer and the
possibility of Stanford men being mem
bers of the U. S. Olympic team of 1924
will materialize if financial backing is
forthcoming.
The Olympic Club merely asks Ernst
Brandsten to name his price. Mr. Brand
sten issues his ultimatum at this point.
Unless the Board of Athletic Control can
guarantee more financial support to
aquatic teams it may be, in the future,
Mr. Ernst M. Brandsten of the Olympic
Club.
Yours truly,
Fremont R. Schm eider. *24.

Ernst Brandsten is being sought by the
| Olympic Club. (S. F. papers.) What is
Stanford's answer to this? Are the stu
dents once again going to circulate peti
tions asking the powers that be to retain
a competent man?
Right now we shall have to decide
whether Student Government in the Stan
ford Democracy takes a live and active
part in Stanford affairs, or whether we
act as we have done on previous occa
sions, agreeing without any real knowl
edg of the decisions of other local bodies.
Ernst Brandsten has made his decision.
He says,"I believe I can do more to
promote and encourage water sports by
developing college men than by coaching
seasoned stars," but
We hesitate for a moment. Ernst
Brandsten has reached the end of the rope
at Stanford. He has been successful in
producing teams of such caliber that the
present swimming budget of $1100 will
not even suflice to provide local competi
tion. We actually give less than 3 per
cent of the incidental fees for one quarter
towards keeping swimming alive here at
Stanford for a year.
Perhaps you have seen Ernst Brand
sten performing his daily duties. He does
everything possible to see that swimming
gets the most out of what little money is
available. It seems to me that if we can
finance $450,000 dormitories that surely
we can make some provision for keeping
the pool and equipment in repairs. Under
the present system, Ernst Brandsten per
forms all these duties himself in order
not to cut down the swimming budget.
He needs money to send a water polo
team, of proven caliber, to Chicago. Al

York this spring to defend his title.
