# CUSHING DISCUSSES LAWYERS' OBLIGATIONS
## 
### 
"A lawyer should be a chap who
knows more about any subject than
anybody except the man who knows
about it," said O. K. Cushing, promi
nent member of th i San Francisco bar
and lecturer in the faculty of the Stan
ford Law School, in his lecture on
"The Ethical Obligations of a Law
yer" in the Law building yesterday
afternoon. "If you wish to be a suc
cessful lawyer, you must be a student
of all things as long as you are a
1 awyer. The lawyer owes it to his
CiH/mt to be widely educated so that
wht:Â«n he is asked for advice on a spe
cial subject, he will be able to give it."
iy,ir. Cushing declared that the un
popularity of the bar with the people
was due chiefly to the fact that too
many lawyers think too much of their
profession as a money-making proposi
tion. If lawyers wish to rectify this

impression, they must go into their
profession with the purpose of serv
ing the science of law, their clients,
and the state.
Mr. Cushing will give a second lec
ture Thursday afternoon at 3:15 in
Room 12 of the Law building.
