# PROFESSORS MAKING STUDY OF LAGUNITA SPECIES OF SHRIMP

### 
An exhaustive comparison of the
fairy shrimp, which exists in great num
bers in Lake Lagunita, and the brine
shrimp, which lives in salt water, found
in large numbers along the bay from
Redwood City to San Mateo, is being
carried on by Professor Harold Heath
of the Zoology department and Profes
sor E. G. Martin of the Physiology de
partment. The fairy and brine shrimp
are from half to three-quarters of an
inch in length and look so much alike
that they have been thought to be identi
cal.
About fifty years ago a European bi
ologist claimed that the brine shrimp
could live in fresh water and live with'
the fairy shrimp if the water it lived in
was very gradually changed from salt
to fresh. His experiments and conclu
sions have been accepted by biologists,
although they have not been tested.
Heath and Martin doubt that the brine
shrimp can exist in fresh water. They
are now carrying on a very careful study
of both types.
One distinctive difference, which has
not been so far recorded, as far as can
be determined, discovered by Heath and
Martin, is that the fairy shrimp produces
one generation a year, while the brine
shrimp produces twelve. The young of
both kinds of shrimps are protected by
brown embryo sacks. All that is left
when the water goes out of Lake Lagu
nita are these round shells or sacks
which are deposited in the lake bottom.
In the spring as soon as the level of the
water reaches them, the shrimps hatch
almost at once. Thus the age of all the
fresh-water shrimps remains the same.
One generation of the salt-water shrips
is produced each month.
The result of these experiments so
far indicate that the brine shrimp could
not live in fresh water, as hitherto sup
posed.
