# Phone to Europe Possible Says Radio Club Speaker
## 
### 
America can now phone to Europe.
Gerald M. Best, talking to the Radio
Club last night, told how engineers of
the Bell system used a common desk
telephone to transmit speech from New
York to a similar phone in London on
January 25. The experiment was en
tirely satisfactory and its proved the
practicability of interconnection between
the regular long-distance telephone sys
tem of the country and high power
radio stations. It is therefore probable
that the telephone subscribers anywhere
in America will soon be able to talk to
business associates or relatives in Eu
rope and other remote parts of the
world.
A bank of newly developed powerful
vacuum tubes was used in the New York
"Radio Central" station for the test.
Part of the outer wall of this type of
tube is made of metal instead of the
usual glass, and it is designed so that
the positive electrode, or "plate," can be
cooled by water in about the same way
that the cylinders of an automobile
motor are cooled.
The lecturer also explained how five
telephone conversations and twelve tele
graph messages can all be carried at one
time by a single pair of wires, using
vacuum tube circuits, without confusion
of voices or signals.
Lantern slides were used to illustrate
the apparatus and circuits described.
The Radio Club expects to be able to
announce a lecture early in March to
be given by one of the most noted radio
engineers in the United States.
