# POTENTIAL SISTERS AT WISCONSIN PAY THE BILL
## 
### 
A complete reversal of the policy of
sorority rushing will be followed next
fall at University of Wisconsin, if
present plans are approved by the
faculty and the various sororities in
volved. Rushees will pay a part of
the expenses, school work will not be
impaired, hasty decisions will not be
made, and men shall not be used to
aid in rushing, if the new plan is
adopted.
