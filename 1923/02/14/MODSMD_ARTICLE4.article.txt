# SCHWARTZ RELATES POTTERY TO PROGRESS
## Japan Has Gone Before All of Other Nations Developing Ceramic Art, Says Speaker 
### 
"Pottery represents progress and a
high civilization," said William L.
Schwartz, instructor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages, in an
illustrated lecture on Potters and Pot
tery of Satsuma that he gave last eve
ning in the Little Theater.
"Japan has gone ahead of the other
nations in the production of pottery.
In that country pottery takes the place
of jewelry.
"The history, development, and char
acteristics of Satsuma pottery are
closely associated with the tea-cere
monial. In Japan serving tea is an art,
and men go to school to learn how to
become skilled in this profession. They
study this art for a year or two and
get a diploma in tea-service. Two
things were demanded of the potters'
wares by the tea-clubs —the highest
artistic quality and pertinent simplici
ty.
"The tea-ceremonial originated dur
ing the turbulence and violence of the
formation of the feudal system. The
Japanese, who were engaged in many
battles, felt the need of some kind of
tranquil relaxation to offset the strain
of the numerous wars. The feudal
prince began the habit of drinking tea
with his friends, and part of the pur
pose of the tea-service was to admire
the pottery. The essential principles of
the tea-ceremonial were, purity, peace
fulness, reverence, and detachment
from worldly cares."
Mr. Schwartz gave a brief history of
the ancient potters of Satsuma. He ex
plained that a prince of the clan of
Satsuma invaded Koera and brought
back to Japan twenty families of pot
ters. The men who make the Satsuma
pottery today are descendants of those
Koreans. The pottery was decorated
with metallic enamels, and simplicity
and natural accident —such as the
print of the fingers on the unbaked
clay, were other characteristics of the
designs. Crests of the noble families
were sometimes used to decorate the
pottery. Works of perfection or gold
ornamented pieces of pottery were
only given to nobles, princely families
of Satsuma, or the rulers of Japan.
Later on, yellow pottery was invented
for daily use instead of the expensive
ware.
"The feudal lords were rivals for the
most perfect and beautiful pieces of
pottery. Men were sent out to learn
secrets of the art from other provinces.
Some of the Satsuma potters went to
other fields to accomplish improve
ments in their works.
"On account of their excellent work
manship some of the Koreans were al
lowed to wear swords. That is, they
were naturalized and were placed on
a level with the Japanese. On the
whole the potters were not very well
treated. In 1875 when they were given
their freedom, they hastened to join
other professions. Most of them ex
pressed a preference for politics."
Mr. Schwartz said that modern pot
ters had become skilled in making
incised decorations. He also mentioned
the fact that much of the commercial
pottery was poorly-potted ware with
an elaborate design.
About sixty slides of various kinds
of Satsuma ware illustrated the lec
ture. Some of the slides were pictures
of pottery in Mr. Schwartz's private
collection that have been exhibited in
several museums.

"The history, development, and char
acteristics of Satsuma pottery are
closely associated with the tea-cere
monial. In Japan serving tea is an art,
and men go to school to learn how to
become skilled in this profession. They
study this art for a year or two and
get a diploma in tea-service. Two
things were demanded of the potters'
wares by the tea-clubs —the highest
artistic quality and pertinent simplici
ty.
"The tea-ceremonial originated dur
ing the turbulence and violence of the
formation of the feudal system. The
Japanese, who were engaged in many
battles, felt the need of some kind of
tranquil relaxation to offset the strain
of the numerous wars. The feudal
prince began the habit of drinking tea
with his friends, and part of the pur
pose of the tea-service was to admire
the pottery. The essential principles of
the tea-ceremonial were, purity, peace
fulness, reverence, and detachment
from worldly cares."
Mr. Schwartz gave a brief history of
the ancient potters of Satsuma. He ex
plained that a prince of the clan of
Satsuma invaded Koera and brought
back to Japan twenty families of pot
ters. The men who make the Satsuma
pottery today are descendants of those
Koreans. The pottery was decorated
with metallic enamels, and simplicity
and natural accident —such as the
print of the fingers on the unbaked
clay, were other characteristics of the
designs. Crests of the noble families
were sometimes used to decorate the
pottery. Works of perfection or gold
ornamented pieces of pottery were
only given to nobles, princely families
of Satsuma, or the rulers of Japan.
Later on, yellow pottery was invented
for daily use instead of the expensive
ware.
"The feudal lords were rivals for the
most perfect and beautiful pieces of
pottery. Men were sent out to learn
secrets of the art from other provinces.
Some of the Satsuma potters went to
other fields to accomplish improve
ments in their works.
"On account of their excellent work
manship some of the Koreans were al
lowed to wear swords. That is, they
were naturalized and were placed on
a level with the Japanese. On the
whole the potters were not very well
treated. In 1875 when they were given
their freedom, they hastened to join
other professions. Most of them ex
pressed a preference for politics."
Mr. Schwartz said that modern pot
ters had become skilled in making
incised decorations. He also mentioned
the fact that much of the commercial
pottery was poorly-potted ware with
an elaborate design.
About sixty slides of various kinds
of Satsuma ware illustrated the lec
ture. Some of the slides were pictures
of pottery in Mr. Schwartz's private
collection that have been exhibited in
several museums.
"Pottery represents progress and a
high civilization," said William L.
Schwartz, instructor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages, in an
illustrated lecture on Potters and Pot
tery of Satsuma that he gave last eve
ning in the Little Theater.
"Japan has gone ahead of the other
nations in the production of pottery.
In that country pottery takes the place
of jewelry.
