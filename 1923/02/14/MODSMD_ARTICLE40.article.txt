# Sophomores Recommend Numerals for Boxers
## 
### 
The sophomore class will send a
recommendation to the Executive Com
mittee that the four sophomores who
either won or tied their bouts in the
interclass boxing tourned be given the j
numerals "1925" such as are usually
given to men who participate in inter
class competition in major sports, ac- j

cording to the decision made in the
class meeting yesterday.
John Hall, '25, reported that a profit
of about $240 was made on the sopho
more cotillion. Lloyd Davies, '25, re
ported a loss of $6 on the sophomore
play, due chiefly to the weather.
Charles Beardsley, retiring class pres
ident, brought up the subject of aboli
tion of hazing and asked that the men
of the class of *25 back the senior
sponsor system.
