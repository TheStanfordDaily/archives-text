OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE â€”With the bruises of last season
hardly healed, the Oregon Aggie foot
ball squad is already at work under
Coach Rutherford, getting a start for
the 1923 campaign. Line and back
field candidates meet once a week on
separate afternoons, with one after
noon additional when they practice to
gether. Skull practice fills odd mo
ments, and Coach Rutherford says that
the boys are working as hard as if the
Big Game were only a week off.
