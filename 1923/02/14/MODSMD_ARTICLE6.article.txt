# RECORD BALLOTING FEATURES ELECTION
## 
### DON LIEBENDORFER, '24 
Incomplete returns which were
available at 3 o'clock this afternoon
indicate that a fairly heavy vote was
cast in the mid-year election this
morning. According to "Peg" Glenn,
chairman of the election board, about
20 per cent of the women and a.
slightly larger per cent of the men
voted.
As was expected, greatest interest
seemed to center around the race for
junior representative on the Execu
tive Committee, president of the
senior class, and president of the
junior class. Of the six candidates
for tlie 1924 Executive Committee po
sition, none seemed to be piling up a
large enough vote to win. A second
election will undoubtedly be neces
sary to decide the contest.
A1 Masters held a slight lead over
his opponent in the race for president

of the class of 1923, but early results
indicated that the vole would be
close. Charlie White had a more sub
stantial lead in the contest for the
presidency of the junior class, but
later returns may reverse the ad
vantage.
The new constitution and the senior
sponsor system seemed certain to be
adopted by large majorities. Few
dissenting votes were cast against
either.
Results of the contest between Tom
Irwin and Charles Fletcher for the
Board of Athletic Control were not
available, but latest reports point to
Fletcher's victory.
The write-in vote which was so
heavy in the election last spring, was
not in evidence today, most of the
class officers being elected on a white
ballot.
