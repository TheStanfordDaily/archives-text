# PROFESSOR ROGERS LIVES AFTER THREE THOUSAND VOLT JAR
## 
### 
Professor Frederick J. Rogers of the
Stanford Physics department, while
working in his laboratory at the Uni
versity just before noon today, passed
3,000 volts of electricity through his
body through some inadvertency and
suffered no greater permanent injury, ap
parently than some cuts under his eye,
where his broken glasses lacerated his
cheek. Three thousand volts is the
amount of electricity used in electrocu
tion, and Professor Rogers' escape from
instant death is not fully explained. He
was unconscious for a quarter of an
hour, but according to Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, who was caled from Palo Alto
immediately, he will be all right again
as soon as the cuts heal.
Professor Rogers was experimenting
with some apparatus he had himself just
rigged up for the purpose. He was work
ing with a 3,000-volt transformer, one
end of which was grounded through a
110-direct current line. The galvano
meter with which he was working was
connected with the other end of the
transformer. He placed his eye against
the miscroscope of the galvanometer; his
feet on the ground completed the circuit
and the current at 3,000 volts passed
along the frames of his glasses, appar
ently, and down through his body.
In the convulsion of the shock his
head was jerked down against his in
strument, smashing the lenses of his
glasses and cutting his cheek.
