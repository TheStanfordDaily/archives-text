## 
### 
Professor F. A. Golder of the Stan
ford History Department, now working
as special commissioner in Europe for
the Hoover War Library, is the author
of the first volume of the research
series of the American Geographical
Society, which has just been pub
lished. The series is planned to present
interesting scientific work in the field
of geography.
Professor Golder's volume is "Ber
ing's Voyages, An Account of the Ef
forts of the Russians to Determine the
Relation of Asia and America,"and a
second volume which he will write on
the general topic. Volume I contains
the log books and official reports of
Admiral Bering's first and second ex
peditions in 1725-30 and 1733-42, under
direction of the Russian government.
The book is largely made up of trans
lations of the original manuscripts
which were in many cases immensely
difficult to translate.
