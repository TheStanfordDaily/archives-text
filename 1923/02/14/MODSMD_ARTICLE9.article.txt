tablished relations with the Menlo
Park Country Club, Stanford will pit
an eight-man team against Menlo Park
golfers on the Country Club links. Sat
urday afternoon at 1:30. Due to the
lack of satisfactory arrangements with
a nearby golf club, the Stanford team
has had no opportunity for team prac
tice and must rely on the individual
success of the members in getting
their form back again. No definite se
