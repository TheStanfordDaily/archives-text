Ever pick up a sheet of writing paper so invitingly
beautiful to the eye and the touch, that it seemed
to say to your fingers, You must write on me!"?
Symphony Lawn is just such a paper. It comes in
three exquisite finishes and several smart tints. Sheets
and envelopes in the newest shapes. Also correspondence
cards to match. May we show you Symphony Lawn?
