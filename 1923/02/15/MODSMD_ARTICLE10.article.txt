# CAST, CHORUS OF KNIGHTIE-KNIGHT GOES THROUGH DRESS REHEARSAL
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D. C., Feb. 15.â€”Con
siderable flurry in political circles was
caused here yesterday when it was
learned that the dramatic bloc, headed
by Senators Newill, Ely, and Bayley,
were going through with their deter
mination to stage "Knightie Knight"
tomorrow night, despite the fact that
President Harding, who will be un
able to attend because of sickness,
specially requested postponement of
the show until he could see it.
"We feel," said a senator who does
not wish his name to be divulged, al
though he is known to be a representa
tive of the powerful Ram's Head or
ganization, "that, as we are only giving
one performance of 'Knightie Knight,'
it would be obviously unjust to think
of postponing the engagement, Hard
ing or no Harding."
According to Senator Blumph, who
has no connection with Ram's Head,

but is said to be "in" on the "know,"
tomorrow night's performance will bo
one of the best, and certainly the most
unusual. Ram's Head productions ever
given. Blumph would not reveal the
details of the plot (or conspiracy, as
the senator characteristically dubbed
it), but hinted that the reference to
"Knightie" in the title did not mean
"Nightie" at all, but really meant
"Knightie." This does away with all
talk of suppression which the Purity
bloc has been stirring up lately in an
endeavor to attract credit to them
selves.
On the other hand, it is significant
that none of those concerned will deny
the reports going abroad to the effort
that some of the lines had to be cut
out to satisfy the Senate Committee
on Other People's Business. All this is
mere political gossip, however, which
has not much direct bearing on tire
situation.


Ladies and gentlemen of the chorus do their daily dozen
