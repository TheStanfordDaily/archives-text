# Bears Win 26-23 in Spite of Card Rally; Absence of McHose and Janssen Weakens Team
## 
### 
Weakened by the absence of McHose and Janssen from the line-up during
half the game, the Stanford Varsity lost the first battle of the series with the
Blue and Gold five in Harmon Gymnasium last night by a 26-23 score. The
Bruins led at half time, 17-10.
The Cards plainly showed the effects of the gruelling southern trip. With
the exception of flashes in the early part of the first half and the last-minute
rally, they did not display the punch which has carried them through a hard
preliminary season without a defeat.
Two last-minute shifts in the Bruin line-up strengthened Wight's team
greatly. Huovenin started in Douthit's place at forward, with Kincaid taking

Captain Le Hane's position at standing
guard.
"Nip" McHose sunk the first basket
of the game in the first two minutes.
Talt caged two free ones and the count
was tied. Janssen's field goal from
under the hoop a few seconds later put
the Cards in the lead again. Three
pretty shots in rapid succession by
Thompson, O'Neil, and Huovenin put
the Bears on the long end of an 8-4
score.
With Talt, Houvenin, and Thomp
son doing the scoring, the Bruins
brought their total to 17 at half time.
Baskets by Janssen, Anderson, and
Steele, who went in at center, gave
Stanford six more points before the
half ended.
With McHose and Janssen out dur
ing the last of the first and the first
of the second half, the Cardinal of
fense was crippled. Janssen went, in at
the beginning of the final period and
McHose returned to the game in the
middle of the second half.
Things began to happen rapidly
when the little forward returned to
the fray. "Lefty" Rogers had already
added to the Card total with a field
goal and a pair of free ones. Steele,
who had again taken Janssen's place,
caged one, as did "Nip." Rogers added
two more points on a pretty field goal
and McHose dropped three free throws
out of five attempts.
All this happened while the Card
defense held the Blue and Gold scor
ing combination to nine points on
three field goals and as many free
tosses.
McHose was the outstanding player
for the Cardinal five, scoring seven
points. Rogers accounted for six on
two field goals and as many free ones.
Johnn : e Talt's ability to convert free
throws into points was largely re
spensible for the Blue and Gold vic
tory. In addition to making eight out
of ten trys, he found the hoop for two
goals from the field.
In the absence of Andy Kerr, who is
confined to his bed with the influenza,
Jimmie Davies handled the team last
night.
The second game of the series will
be played in the Pavilion Saturday
night.

the fray. "Lefty" Rogers had already
added to the Card total with a field
goal and a pair of free ones. Steele,
who had again taken Janssen's place,
caged one, as did "Nip." Rogers added
two more points on a pretty field goal
and McHose dropped three free throws
out of five attempts.
All this happened while the Card
defense held the Blue and Gold scor
ing combination to nine points on
three field goals and as many free
tosses.
McHose was the outstanding player
for the Cardinal five, scoring seven
points. Rogers accounted for six on
two field goals and as many free ones.
Johnn : e Talt's ability to convert free
throws into points was largely re
spensible for the Blue and Gold vic
tory. In addition to making eight out
of ten trys, he found the hoop for two
goals from the field.
In the absence of Andy Kerr, who is
confined to his bed with the influenza,
Jimmie Davies handled the team last
night.
The second game of the series will
be played in the Pavilion Saturday
night.
The line-ups:
Stanford— California-
Rogers (6) F Houvenin (4)
McHose (7) F Talt (12)
Janssen (4) C O'Neill (2)
Anderson (2) G Thompson (4)
Oliva G Kincaid
Substitutions: Stanford —Austin for
McHose; Steele (4) for Janssen; Mc-
Burney for Anderson. Califronia —Kyte
(4) for O'Neill; Belasco for Thomp
son; LeHane for Kincaid.
Weakened by the absence of McHose and Janssen from the line-up during
half the game, the Stanford Varsity lost the first battle of the series with the
Blue and Gold five in Harmon Gymnasium last night by a 26-23 score. The
Bruins led at half time, 17-10.
The Cards plainly showed the effects of the gruelling southern trip. With
the exception of flashes in the early part of the first half and the last-minute
rally, they did not display the punch which has carried them through a hard
preliminary season without a defeat.
Two last-minute shifts in the Bruin line-up strengthened Wight's team
greatly. Huovenin started in Douthit's place at forward, with Kincaid taking

Captain Le Hane's position at standing
guard.
"Nip" McHose sunk the first basket
of the game in the first two minutes.
Talt caged two free ones and the count
was tied. Janssen's field goal from
under the hoop a few seconds later put
the Cards in the lead again. Three
pretty shots in rapid succession by
Thompson, O'Neil, and Huovenin put
the Bears on the long end of an 8-4
score.
With Talt, Houvenin, and Thomp
son doing the scoring, the Bruins
brought their total to 17 at half time.
Baskets by Janssen, Anderson, and
Steele, who went in at center, gave
Stanford six more points before the
half ended.
With McHose and Janssen out dur
ing the last of the first and the first
of the second half, the Cardinal of
fense was crippled. Janssen went, in at
the beginning of the final period and
McHose returned to the game in the
middle of the second half.
Things began to happen rapidly
when the little forward returned to
the fray. "Lefty" Rogers had already
added to the Card total with a field
goal and a pair of free ones. Steele,
who had again taken Janssen's place,
caged one, as did "Nip." Rogers added
two more points on a pretty field goal
