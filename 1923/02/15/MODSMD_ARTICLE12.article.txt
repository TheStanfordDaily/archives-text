# BABE SWIMMERS TO MEET NEPTUNE CLUB IN MATCH TONIGHT
## 
### 
Freshman paddlers will meet the
Neptune Club of San Francisco tonight
at 8:15 in the Olympic Club pool in a
combined swimming meet and water
polo game. The clubmen are reported
to be a strong aggregation and have
several fast men in many of the events.
However, the first year waterdogs are
confident of taking the measure of the
city salmon in the same way that they
won the interclass meet and defeated
Lowell High School last Saturday.
With Captain O'Connor on deck they
feel assured of at least three firsts.
O'Connor will probably swim the 50,
100, and 220 yard events and may also
be entered in the back stroke.
Smith, King, and Brown are all in
good form for diving, and at least two
places ought to be expected in this
department. These three all placed
against Lowell last week.
Hablutzel in the breast stroke and
Canfield in the back stroke are looked
upon to give a tough race to any man
the Sons of Neptune may send against
them.
The water polo team will be the
same one that defeated the sdpho
mores in the first round of the inter
class water polo matches Tuesday.
Oakland High School has called off
the swimming meet which was sched
uled for this Saturday, so the swim
tonight will be the only water event
of the week besides the interclass
water polo game between the fresh
men and juniors tomorrow afternoon.
