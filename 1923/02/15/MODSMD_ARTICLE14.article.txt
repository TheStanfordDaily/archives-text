# PROFESSOR RECOVERS FROM "ELECTROCUTION"
## 
### 
Professor Frederick J. Rogers of the
Stanford Physics department, who was
injured while working in his laboratory
yesterday, is rapidly recovering and he
will probably be able to return to his
work again Monday. Professor Rogers
was not injured except for cuts around
the eyes. He is suffering from severe
physical shock.
Professor Rogers probably owes his
life to the prompt action of Charles
Meyer. '23, who pulled the switch turn
ing off the electrical current and then
administered prompt lirst aid measures.
Meyer is a mechanical engineering major
and a member of Encina Club.
