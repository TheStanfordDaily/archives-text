# DARTMOUTH STUDENTS VOTE FOR LONGER CHAPEL SERVICE
## 
### 
DARTMOUTH â€”The results of a re
cent straw vote held by the Daily
Dartmouth showed that the students
favor the retention of compulsory
chapel with fewer requirements and
longer services. The students also
voiced their opinion in favor of start
ing classes at eight-thirty instead of
eight, during the period from Thanks
giving to Easter. The college authori
ties granted the requests of the stu
dents as expressed in the vote and, in
the case of the time for starting
classes, granted the change before the
vote was taken.
