# A
						WORD AS TO POLICY
## 
### 
To inform more than to reform, to entertain more
than to constrain—these will be in the main the
objects of the Daily Palo Alto for the remainder
of the college year.
The present editors intend to commit themselves
to no hard and fast policy on matters of student in
terest. They do not consider consistency of method
necessary. They will be satisfied if the Daily Palo
Alto continues to be a readable and reliable news
paper, respected as a real element in student life,
exerting - at the same time an influence toward sane,
independent thinking and good fellowship.
The very nature of the editor's work places him
in a position which requires a more thorough knowl
edge of a greater variety of campus activity than
that of the average student. It requires that he have
certain ideas upon the significance of the trend of
student affairs. To repress those ideas merely be
cause he fears they will create disfavor in some
quarters would be a concession to self-respect that
no thinking editor is willing to make.
But Stanford lias been going to the dogs for more
than three decades. For centuries the world has been
traveling in more or less the same general direction.
Yet most of us still eat three meals a day, go broke
on the tenth of the month, and have about the same
troubles and joys as former generations. These are
the "good old days" of tomorrow.
Let us not, then, become too agitated. George
Jean Nathan, trafficker in epigrams, says: "Indig
nation is the dissipator of thought. No man can
think clearly with his fists clenched."
Let each of us do his particular work to the best
112 his ability. Let us be frank, without being dog
matic, in our relations with one another. And, above
all, let us not take ourselves too seriously the while.
