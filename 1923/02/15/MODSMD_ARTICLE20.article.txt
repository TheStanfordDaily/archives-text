# THE 						RETIRING EDITOR
## 
### 
As we gaze at the figurative nail in the sanctum
wall from which Tom Irwin's coat has just been re
moved, we reflect that the last few months have been
for the Daily Palo Alto the most active in its
history. His personality and his convictions have
probably made the editorial columns more widely
read than ever before. -
Whatever disagreement with his methods and his
purposes may exist, it would have been insincere for
Irwin to write in any other manner than he did—
and insincerity is an accusation that no person who
•knows the retiring editor will make against him.
Tom Irwin has been one of the most energetic and
courageous editors the campus has known, and
Volume 62 of the Daily Palo Alto will not soon be
forgotten.
