# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
For the benefit of our contributors and our modest
non-contributors, Cabbages submits for your edification
the following clipping, which was extracted from
"Screenland" by means of a hair-pin loaned by the Girl
Reporter.
PLANT YOUR OWN
CABBAGE: Cabbage is more easily grown in the
home environment than most people believe. If planted
on the first of April and not allowed out after six in the
evening until they reach the age of discretion they
should thrive well. Fertilized with a four-year course
in Zoology and Entomology, they should mature into
perfect specimens.
* * *
That sounds so familiar that we are almost tempted to
think that it was re-written from the Cabbage column
of last year.
* * *
We have lots of trouble that way. Even Abraham
Lincoln used our jokes, and yet they called him "Honest
Abe."
» * *
Cabbages received a telegram last month:
Editor Cabbages:
Our people are starving. Send us cabbages and never
mind the corned beef. Allah will bless you.
Ahmed von Tarzan, Sheik.
We instantly dispatched an entire edition.
* * *
The average collegiate sense of humor is like a bass
drum —it functions only when struck by a large blunt
instrument. In order to have a well-rounded education,
the needle-point joke should also be appreciated—and,
like delirium tremens, it must be SEEN to be appre
ciated. Here is a working model with complete box
score which should enable even a Phi Betsey to ac
cumulate the point of the most sub-tile quip:
MIKE: Where did ya get that black eye?
IKE: I was passing the Flapper house and I ran into
a door.
MIKE: Whom?
Now follow closely. A pun is the lowest form of all
wit. This joke is in Cabbages. Therefore this joke is a
pun. Where is the pun? Aha! "a door" sounds remark
ably like "adore." Hence, Mike is anxious to learn
which Flapper Ike ran in to adore. Cabbages is anxious
to learn the same thing. It seems that the boxing team
is overlooking some very promising material.
# * *
Here's a test case. Can you fathom the patriarchial
wheeze about the father who told his two boys to name
their cattle ranch "focus"? Why? Because a focus is
a place where the sun's rays meet.
* * #
Cabbages just received another telegram: *

corned beef. Allah may forgive you.

ciated. Here is a working model with complete box
score which should enable even a Phi Betsey to ac
cumulate the point of the most sub-tile quip:
MIKE: Where did ya get that black eye?
IKE: I was passing the Flapper house and I ran into
a door.
MIKE: Whom?
Now follow closely. A pun is the lowest form of all
wit. This joke is in Cabbages. Therefore this joke is a
pun. Where is the pun? Aha! "a door" sounds remark
ably like "adore." Hence, Mike is anxious to learn
which Flapper Ike ran in to adore. Cabbages is anxious
to learn the same thing. It seems that the boxing team
is overlooking some very promising material.

Here's a test case. Can you fathom the patriarchial
wheeze about the father who told his two boys to name
their cattle ranch "focus"? Why? Because a focus is
a place where the sun's rays meet.

Editor Cabbages:
Our people have'starved. We should have asked for
corned beef. Allah may forgive you.
Ahmed von Tarzan, Sheik.
For the benefit of our contributors and our modest
non-contributors, Cabbages submits for your edification
the following clipping, which was extracted from
"Screenland" by means of a hair-pin loaned by the Girl
Reporter.
PLANT YOUR OWN
CABBAGE: Cabbage is more easily grown in the
home environment than most people believe. If planted
on the first of April and not allowed out after six in the
evening until they reach the age of discretion they
should thrive well. Fertilized with a four-year course
in Zoology and Entomology, they should mature into
perfect specimens.
* * *
That sounds so familiar that we are almost tempted to
think that it was re-written from the Cabbage column
of last year.
* * *
We have lots of trouble that way. Even Abraham
Lincoln used our jokes, and yet they called him "Honest
Abe."

Cabbages received a telegram last month:
Editor Cabbages:
Our people are starving. Send us cabbages and never
mind the corned beef. Allah will bless you.
Ahmed von Tarzan, Sheik.
We instantly dispatched an entire edition.

The average collegiate sense of humor is like a bass
drum —it functions only when struck by a large blunt
instrument. In order to have a well-rounded education,
the needle-point joke should also be appreciated—and,
like delirium tremens, it must be SEEN to be appre
ciated. Here is a working model with complete box
score which should enable even a Phi Betsey to ac
