# Well, Why Is One?

Once there was a writer whose play
was accepted. After the star had re
arranged the lines to suit himself, when
the scenic director had twisted the set
tings, after the house manager had in
troduced a few "Mike and Ikes" to please
the gallery gods, and when the director
had made a new plot for the piece, the
show was produced.
It was a success. The patrons and the
box office were pleased, and the author
was satisfied. Everybody greedily read
the reviews—an indulgence local writers
seem seldom to allow themselves.
Did the critic tell the world that every
actor in the play was a Booth? Did he
marvel that the sets, the lighting and
the other technical details appeared to
be arranged by a Craig or a Jones? Was
the playwright eulogised as a new Shake
speare ?
Or did he say that the acting was all
putrid, the mechanical effects inexcusa
ble, and the play horrible?
Neither. He gave credit where it was
due. He offered, in his quiet way, sug
gestions which might improve the ve
hicle. And he did not do this by de
crying how Mary Smith licked her lips
after kissing John Darling, or by de
scribing his horror when a light flood
went out when a fuse blew, or regretting
the clumsiness of a villain who acci
dentally tripped on a rug.
Yet it is such picayunish trivia the local
talent seem to pounce upon as points of
vital interest. It should be needless to
point out, besides, that the amateur pro
ductions staged here are necessarily
more prone to small errors than profes
sional performances. And what profes
sional effort does not deserve an allow
ance of a few per cent from perfect?
Come now, precocious George Jean
Nathans and your playmates, the bright
little Ruthie Hales, your acuteness is
nothing to write a scare-head over.
Many people see all those obvious little
shortcomings and many other, and more
important ones, besides, and write not
so much as one line about it!
Why is a critic? Ask the publicity
department. Ask the editor haunted by
white space! Ask the space writer. Ask
the critic. Ask, perhaps, some dramatic
expert.
CLAUDIUS BALL.

Or did he say that the acting was all
putrid, the mechanical effects inexcusa
ble, and the play horrible?
Neither. He gave credit where it was
due. He offered, in his quiet way, sug
gestions which might improve the ve
hicle. And he did not do this by de
crying how Mary Smith licked her lips
after kissing John Darling, or by de
scribing his horror when a light flood
went out when a fuse blew, or regretting
the clumsiness of a villain who acci
dentally tripped on a rug.
Yet it is such picayunish trivia the local
talent seem to pounce upon as points of
vital interest. It should be needless to
point out, besides, that the amateur pro
ductions staged here are necessarily
more prone to small errors than profes
sional performances. And what profes
sional effort does not deserve an allow
ance of a few per cent from perfect?
Come now, precocious George Jean
Nathans and your playmates, the bright
little Ruthie Hales, your acuteness is
nothing to write a scare-head over.
Many people see all those obvious little
shortcomings and many other, and more
important ones, besides, and write not
so much as one line about it!
Why is a critic? Ask the publicity
department. Ask the editor haunted by
white space! Ask the space writer. Ask
the critic. Ask, perhaps, some dramatic
expert.
