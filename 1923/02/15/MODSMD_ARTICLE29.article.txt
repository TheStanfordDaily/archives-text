# The 						Freudian Wish and Its Place in Ethics
## 
### EDWIN B. HOLT 
(Henry Holt & Co.)

It is, perhaps, rather unusual to re
view a book already several years old.
But since I believe a large majority of
undergraduates are unfamiliar with this
work, I take the liberty of remarking
upon it.
The idea has gone abroad that the
term, "Freudian," is synonymous with
"sexual," and to read Freud's own works
is to fairly plunge into the licentious and
the illicit. This belief, so alluring U\
some and so disconcerting others, is.
as ill-founded as it is widespread. It is l
true that certain of Freud's theories are
vitally concerned with sex. But it is
always from a scientific, rather than a
prurient, point of view that he discusses
such topics.

| This little book 1 ot only one
of the best malyses of
the Freudian me< have seen,
but it is also (at lore impor
tant) an applicati< mechanisms
to the problem good con-
I duct. Assuming hanisms to
be real, although not fully understood,
iwe are given a highly common sense,
j non-technical, and logical key to ethical
theory. It will not, necessarily, be dis
couraging to any of the beliefs that one
now holds, but it cannot fail to interest
in its explanation of the mechanisms of
„.such feliefs and of conduct.
1 And, incidentally, there is nothing in
I the book that could possibly annoy the
most prudish—a fact that will cause
some people to read it, but more, I fear,
1 to pass it by.
