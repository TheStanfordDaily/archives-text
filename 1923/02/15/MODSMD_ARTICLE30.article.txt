# PUBLIC IGNORANCE OF ARTS IS SCORED BY C.H. WALKER

"Ign ntlwrntial men on the
subj re leplorable, ami lack of
knowl ie part of university
graduates, who become people of wealth
and power in the world, are a reiit
menace to the arts," stated C. Howard
Walker, well-known Boston architect,
anil meml>er of the public education
council, who spoke on "Appreciation of
the Fine Arts" yesterday afternoon.
"In the last century material progress
and scientific research have been so
great that they have taken up the entire
highway of learning. The arts are un
fortunately separated from the people,
ami are considered an occult, effeminate
occupation."
Actual investigation reveals the fact
that nearly *X) per cent of university
graduates have no real appreciation of
the arts, unless they acquired the taste
at home, according to the speaker.
"We would not burden universities
with post graduate art courses," he said.
"But an arrangement could Ik- made
wherein the connection of the arts with
other courses of learning could l>e made
clear. Art i< recreativeâ€”a final glori
fication i>f the senses of m#u in visual
things It is connected with literature,
grammar, physics, and chemistry. Even
engineering does not escape, if the en
gineer has i vision which will make him
truly successful."
Well-meaning legislators are some of
the worst offenders in artistic taste, in
the experience of Walker. He related
a personal experience in connection with
the Lincoln Memorial at Washington
a bit of unrecorded history, which might
have cost the nation the loss of one ot the
beauties of the national capitol, if a
Senator had had his way.
"What we are trying to do is to call
the attention of the public to the neces
sity of art education," the lecturer con
cluded. "For the arts, when once felt,
become beloved to those who know
them."
