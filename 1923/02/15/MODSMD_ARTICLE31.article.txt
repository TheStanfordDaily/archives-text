# Stanford Professors Write Engineers' Text
## 
### 
Two new textbooks on engineering
by Stanford professors, "Descriptive
Geometry" by L. E. Cutter and J. C. L.
Fish's "Engineering Economics" have
been recently received here. Professor
Cutter's book presents the field of de
scriptive geometry In a new light one
which aims to teach the subject prac
tically, the way it is used by the
draftsman and designer in their work.
Despite the fact that there are many
texts alread> written on the subject of
descriptive geometry, this one was
undertaken in order that the method
of choosing new projection planes
might be emphasized rather than the j
method of rotation which had previ
ously been used in applying the funda-1
mental principles of descriptive geome-!
try.
Professor Fish's book is the outcome j
of his course in Engineering Econo-!
uiics which he originated in 1912. So 1
far as is known, Stanford was the tlrst j
college to have a course of this sort, j
though many other schools adopted it
following its success at Stanford.
Professor Fish wroto an earlier text
to accompany the course, but the pres
ent edition, while retaining the origt
na Ititle, has been entirely rewritten
and enlarged.
Both books are published by the Mc-
Graw-Hill Company.
