# OLYMPIC CLUBMEN PLAY VARSITY NINE SATURDAY
## 
### 
The Olympic Club slabsters of San
Francisco have always been renowned
as a baseball agßregatiou of superior
type. Each year they have been able
to sluk and tleld their way to a suc
cessful season. This year is no excep
tion.
Stanford's diamond men will go up
against really tough opposition Satur
day afternoon on the varsity held
when they will try to stop the Olym
pians. And reports from the Golden
Gate indicate that they will have a
hard time doing it.
Ludolph, Winged-0 twirier, will be
on hand to show that he can heave
just as well as he did last year. The
Cards haven't forgotten how this lanky
specimen treated them at that time
wheu he pitched a wonder game, and
held them to a no-hit, no-run contest.
Stanford's best sticksters tried their
clubs on Ludolph's elusive pill but
simply could not make things meet.
And in addition to all this good work,
the Olympian bagged seven strikeouts.
The club lineup is practically intact
this year and with the advantage of
having played together before, to
gether with the merits of the indi
vidual players, the O. C. nine should
give the Cards a whirlwind exhibition
of the national game.

Coach Welter's men have something
up their sleeve. The game Saturday
will be an exhibition all rinht. but not
one entirely partial to the San Fran
ciscans, they say. Though the varsity
has gone through the season so far
with a record which isn't enviable,
they have shown that they have the
makings of a real ball team. They were
at their the Ambrose Tailor
game, and they were going great
against the French-American Bankers
last Saturday until the last two innings
when they got overly excited, erred,
and spoiled the game.
"They don't hit at the right time and
they make too many errors." This is
what most of the tans think about
their team, and the reason why it has
been stopped this year.
Wolter believes that his men will
lose their tendency to foozle from now
on, and will get together and play
more consistent ball. And he knows
that they can hit, for they have al
ready demonstrated as much. When
the men get the idea that they can
pelt the old horsehlde when hits are
most needed, then Stanford's baseball
varsity will forge to the front and
bring home laurels consistently.
Wolter anticipates a real battle Sat
urday. The game will begin at 3
o'clock.

makings of a real ball team. They were
at their the Ambrose Tailor
game, and they were going great
against the French-American Bankers
last Saturday until the last two innings
when they got overly excited, erred,
and spoiled the game.
"They don't hit at the right time and
they make too many errors." This is
what most of the tans think about
their team, and the reason why it has
been stopped this year.
Wolter believes that his men will
lose their tendency to foozle from now
on, and will get together and play
more consistent ball. And he knows
that they can hit, for they have al
ready demonstrated as much. When
the men get the idea that they can
pelt the old horsehlde when hits are
most needed, then Stanford's baseball
varsity will forge to the front and
bring home laurels consistently.
Wolter anticipates a real battle Sat
urday. The game will begin at 3
o'clock.
The Olympic Club slabsters of San
Francisco have always been renowned
as a baseball agßregatiou of superior
type. Each year they have been able
to sluk and tleld their way to a suc
cessful season. This year is no excep
tion.
Stanford's diamond men will go up
against really tough opposition Satur
day afternoon on the varsity held
when they will try to stop the Olym
pians. And reports from the Golden
Gate indicate that they will have a
hard time doing it.
Ludolph, Winged-0 twirier, will be
on hand to show that he can heave
just as well as he did last year. The
Cards haven't forgotten how this lanky
specimen treated them at that time
wheu he pitched a wonder game, and
held them to a no-hit, no-run contest.
Stanford's best sticksters tried their
clubs on Ludolph's elusive pill but
simply could not make things meet.
And in addition to all this good work,
the Olympian bagged seven strikeouts.
The club lineup is practically intact
this year and with the advantage of
having played together before, to
gether with the merits of the indi
vidual players, the O. C. nine should
give the Cards a whirlwind exhibition
of the national game.

Coach Welter's men have something
up their sleeve. The game Saturday
will be an exhibition all rinht. but not
one entirely partial to the San Fran
ciscans, they say. Though the varsity
has gone through the season so far
with a record which isn't enviable,
they have shown that they have the
makings of a real ball team. They were
at their the Ambrose Tailor
game, and they were going great
against the French-American Bankers
