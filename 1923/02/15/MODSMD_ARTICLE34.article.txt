# Two Judges Announced for Annual Tri-State Debate
## 
### 
Two judges for the annual tri-state
debate to bo held with the universities
of Oregon and Washington, have al
ready agreed to serve at the debate.
According to Debating Adviser J. G.
Emerson, this is the result of the new
system which is being tried for the
first time in this debate. The univer
sity where the debate is to be held
chooses all the judges, under this sys
tem. This eliminates the disputes
which characterized the old system of
having one university propose a list
from which the other could select
three Judges.
The men who have already agreed
to judge the debate are Professor Ar
nold Perstein of the University of
California, and Robert Newton Lynch,
vice president of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce.
