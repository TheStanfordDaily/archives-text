desk in front, she writvs her notes
with her toes.

complishment because she is armless.
She carries her equipment in a bag
fastened to her dress. Out of this she
can take anything she wants from a
book to an eraser. She can hold a book
close enough to do her reading and
turn the pages at ease. All her actions
are graceful.
She is said to be an attractive young
woman; she has a pleasant smile, and
is Industrious in spite of her handicap.
She usually wears a long cape about
the campus.
