# Ogden Defeats Fairchild in Third Round Tennis Play
## 
### 
"Tubby" Ogden defeated Paul Fair
child in the third round of the Lindley
Murray Tennis Tournament, 6-2, 8-6.
Ogden had but little trouble in winning
the first set, but in the second Fair
child took a brace and forced Ogden
to a deuce set. Ogden and Fairchild
are both likely candidates for this
year's freshman team. Ogden has had
more experience in tournament play
than Fairchild.
Only three other matches in the
third round have been played, and two
of these were won by default. Miller
defaulted to Hinckley, Hess defaulted
to Williard, and Overfeldt defeated
Benson.
