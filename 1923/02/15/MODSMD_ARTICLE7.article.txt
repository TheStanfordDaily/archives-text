# LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT FIVE TAKES SERIES
## 
### 
By fighting for every point in the
second half, the Stanford light-heavy
weight team was able to forge ahead
of an overwhelming California lead,
and win the championship of the an
nuel series, 33 to 31, from the Cali
fornia weight team in Harmon Gym
last night.
Scoring was frequent throughout the
game. At the end of the first half the
Bruins had piled up an 18-11 lead and
showed signs of increasing it at the
beginning of the second.
The Cards had trouble in mobilizing
their offensive in the first period, and
seemed to lack the confidence dis
played by the Berkeley five. Steffen
and Cornell failed to locate the hoop
often enough to keep within distance
of the California lead while Kay and
Doll of the Bears found the basket re
peatedly.
The entire Bear defense and offense
looked stronger in the first half than
that of the Cardinal squad.
In the second half the Stanford
team came back with aggressiveness
and by systematic teamwork were able
to slowly catch up on the Bruni quin
tet. The Stanford defense tightened
and only comparatively few shots were
allowed, while the Steffen-Pigott-Cor
nell combination penetrated the
enemy's territory at will.
For the second time this year all
worked as a unit, and in the final half
the five-man defense worked effective
ly-
Ted Steffen showed his usual flashes
of offensive ability. Cornell, Steffen,
and Pigott were the three outstanding
scores on the Stanford quintet.
At center, Pigott easily outjumped
his opponent, Doll, and fed to the Card
forwards at almost every leap.

Stanford — California —
StefTen F Kay
Cornell F Carson
Pigott C Doll
Grace G Sears
