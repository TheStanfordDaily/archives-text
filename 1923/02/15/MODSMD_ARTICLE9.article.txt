# BABE NINE DEFEATS U.C. DENTAL COLLEGE
## 
### 
Hitting freely and fielding loosely, the
Stanford 1926 baseball team chalked up
a win over the University of California
Dental College yesterday afternoon by
an 8 to 4 count. Ditzler, who started
on the mound for the Babes, was not up
to his form in the Hayward game, and
issued six hits as against three strike
outs. He kept the hits widely scattered,
however, and had the game well under
control. Nevers replaced him in the
eighth and allowed one safe blowâ€”a
double which chased in two runs.
Boyle, twirling for the Dentists,
whiffed eight freshmen, but was still
more lavish with bingles. Twelve clouts,
including thre<j doubles, went to nourish
the '26 batting average and three passes
to first put runs on the paths. Meikle
john had a big day at the plate with a
pair of singles and a two-ply slam, and
Kohler hit safely twice. Draper and
Lovelace were responsible for the other
two doubles marked up by the freshmen.
The frosh started out in the second
inning and brought home four earned
runs with no trouble at all. Dickey
opened up with a safe jolt, and Meikle
jolin. Kohler, Ditzler, and Lucas fol
lowed suit. Lovelace went out, pitcher
to first, on a squeeze play, and Draper
emptied the sacks with a long double.
Both teams scored in the fourth. Cowan
and Cuneo bumped Ditzler for singles
and then pulled a double steal, which
left them in position to score a moment
later on Radebaugh's bingle. In the
Stanford half of the inning a pass and
an error put Kohler and Ditzler on the
paths and a well-timed double by Love
lace took them off.
Two walks, two Stanford errors and
a hot two-bagger by Wahlan brought
two more runs to the tooth-snatchers in
the semi-final stanza. Not to be out
done, Meiklejohn contributed another
punch, which left him panting on second,
and Kohler and Nevers turned in a
brace of singles which, combined with
an error on the dentist left field, gave
the yearlings two more runs and a de
cisive victory.
