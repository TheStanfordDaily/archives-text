# "KNIGHTIE KNIGHT" IS CAMPUS STAGE OFFERING TONIGHT
## Vivid Colorful Costumes and Sparkling Lines Distinguish Ram's Head Annual Show 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
What that illustrious Connecticut
Yankee and when he took a 1400-year
step backwards and landed in the
court of King Arthur is well-known.
But how would a knight from the age
of chivalry get along in modern so
ciety? Sir Gavador will offer practical
demonstrations when the Ram's Head
book unfolds the story of "Knightie
Knight" this evening. And Sir Gava
dor starts his adventures at 8:15.
Stereotype is put in the discard in
both the opening and ending of the
play by means of "extras" who are
not genuine members of the cast. The
stranger from out of the past returns
to ancient history in the weird manner
in which he had appeared.
Clever songs of catchy syncopation
will be supplied in the usual Ram's
Head profusion. But the feature of the
show is the excellence of semi-classi
cal numbers which bring some of the
scenes to a par with a Junior Opera.
A double-quartet composed of mem
bers of the Glee Club puts across har
mony in Malaby's drinking song, "Inn
of the Golden Horn," that will be a
fitting opening of the second act which
depicts the glamor of the English fox
hunt. A pleasure-loving company of
hunters arrayed in colorful riding cos
tumes joins in on "Tally-Ho" in the
best chorus ensemble of the produc
tion.
"Sir Gavador" is another operatic se
lection by Malaby which has a sure-hit
accompaniment in the burlesque antics
of the principals. William Fitzhugh,
'26, as the Squire, is guaranteed to
cause a continual uproar. He is a mai'-
velous di^mbell —a persecuted, hen
pecked husband, who always smiles.
And Dave Mannoccir, as his wife, em
ploys mannerisms that will make the
audience smile —nay, even break out
in mirth. 1
The last act has a masquerade that
provides plenty of humorous incidents,
and is especially distinguished by the
well-timed appearance of the cupid
chorus. Campus snakes will get lots of
information on a banned product when
the cleverly related history of "King
Chicago" is sung. Furthermore the ex
ponents of Julian Eltinge have a num
ber all their own that ought score
heavily.
Stage Settings Unique
New ideas in stage settings will add
their necessary touch to the wander
ings of the chivalrous Sir Gavador.
The first act is more futuristic in tone
than the second and third, and recalls
the Ram's Head of a year ago. With
the futuristic trend of the first act, is
combined, the mysterious opening,
which makes it the best set act of the
play.
The second act diminishes the cu
bist tone; the conventional peeps
through in many touches. In the third
act comes still a new tone; suggestion
rather than portrayal "puts over" the
effect desired. The entire three acts
were designed by Ted Van Deusen,
and executed by Clyde Coakley.
For the past two years the skillful
blending of lighting effects has been a
feature of all campus shows. For "He"
the footlights were omitted; for pre
vious shows a novelty was introduced
in some way. "Knightie Knight" pre
sents the happiest combination that
has yet been seen. The lighting is ef
fective, yet it is not so effective as to
be startling, detracting attention from
the play and players.
The campus should go to the pro
duction tonight ready to laugh; but
the laugh will be on the audience if
they expect a straight burlesque. The
Ram's Head show this year is a direct
departure from the usual; the classi
cal rubs shoulders with the comic;
and throughout runs a well-written
plot.
Tickets will be available tonight at
the box office, and there are yet good
seats left. After the play there will be
a dance in the Woman's Clubhouse.

mony in Malaby's drinking song, "Inn
of the Golden Horn," that will be a
fitting opening of the second act which
depicts the glamor of the English fox
hunt. A pleasure-loving company of
hunters arrayed in colorful riding cos
tumes joins in on "Tally-Ho" in the
best chorus ensemble of the produc
tion.
"Sir Gavador" is another operatic se
lection by Malaby which has a sure-hit
accompaniment in the burlesque antics
of the principals. William Fitzhugh,
'26, as the Squire, is guaranteed to
cause a continual uproar. He is a mai'-
velous di^mbell —a persecuted, hen
pecked husband, who always smiles.
And Dave Mannoccir, as his wife, em
ploys mannerisms that will make the
audience smile —nay, even break out
in mirth. 1
The last act has a masquerade that
provides plenty of humorous incidents,
and is especially distinguished by the
well-timed appearance of the cupid
chorus. Campus snakes will get lots of
information on a banned product when
the cleverly related history of "King
Chicago" is sung. Furthermore the ex
ponents of Julian Eltinge have a num
ber all their own that ought score
heavily.
Stage Settings Unique
New ideas in stage settings will add
their necessary touch to the wander
ings of the chivalrous Sir Gavador.
The first act is more futuristic in tone
than the second and third, and recalls
the Ram's Head of a year ago. With
the futuristic trend of the first act, is
combined, the mysterious opening,
which makes it the best set act of the
play.
The second act diminishes the cu
bist tone; the conventional peeps
through in many touches. In the third
act comes still a new tone; suggestion
rather than portrayal "puts over" the
effect desired. The entire three acts
were designed by Ted Van Deusen,
and executed by Clyde Coakley.
For the past two years the skillful
blending of lighting effects has been a
feature of all campus shows. For "He"
the footlights were omitted; for pre
vious shows a novelty was introduced
in some way. "Knightie Knight" pre
sents the happiest combination that
has yet been seen. The lighting is ef
fective, yet it is not so effective as to
be startling, detracting attention from
the play and players.
The campus should go to the pro
duction tonight ready to laugh; but
the laugh will be on the audience if
they expect a straight burlesque. The
Ram's Head show this year is a direct
departure from the usual; the classi
cal rubs shoulders with the comic;
and throughout runs a well-written
plot.
Tickets will be available tonight at
the box office, and there are yet good
seats left. After the play there will be
a dance in the Woman's Clubhouse.
What that illustrious Connecticut
Yankee and when he took a 1400-year
step backwards and landed in the
court of King Arthur is well-known.
But how would a knight from the age
of chivalry get along in modern so
ciety? Sir Gavador will offer practical
demonstrations when the Ram's Head
book unfolds the story of "Knightie
Knight" this evening. And Sir Gava
dor starts his adventures at 8:15.
Stereotype is put in the discard in
both the opening and ending of the
play by means of "extras" who are
not genuine members of the cast. The
stranger from out of the past returns
to ancient history in the weird manner
in which he had appeared.
Clever songs of catchy syncopation
will be supplied in the usual Ram's
Head profusion. But the feature of the
show is the excellence of semi-classi
cal numbers which bring some of the
scenes to a par with a Junior Opera.
