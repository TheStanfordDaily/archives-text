# "KNIGHTIE KNIGHT" IS CAMPUS STAGE OFFERING TONIGHT
## Vivid Colorful Costumes and Sparkling Lines Distinguish Ram's Head Annual Show 
### Robert Edwards, '24 
What that illustrious Connecticut
Yankee and when he took a 1400-year
step backwards and landed in the
court of King Arthur is well-known.
But how would a knight from the age
of chivalry get along in modern so
ciety? Sir Gavador will offer practical
demonstrations when the Ram's Head
book unfolds the story of "Knightie
Knight" this evening. And Sir Gava
dor starts his adventures at 8:15.
Stereotype is put in the discard in
both the opening and ending of the
play by means of "extras" who are
not genuine members of the cast. The
stranger from out of the past returns
to ancient history in the weird manner
in which he had appeared.
Clever songs of catchy syncopation
will be supplied in the usual Ram's
Head profusion. But the feature of the
show is the excellence of semi-classi
cal numbers which bring some of the
scenes to a par with a Junior Opera.
A double-quartet composed of mem
bers of the Glee Club puts across har
mony in Malaby's drinking song, "Inn
of the Golden Horn," that will be a
fitting opening of the second act which
depicts the glamor of the English fox
hunt. A pleasure-loving company of
hunters arrayed in colorful riding cos
tumes joins in on "Tally-Ho" in the
best chorus ensemble of the produc
tion.
"Sir Gavador" is another operatic se
lection by Malaby which has a sure-hit
accompaniment in the burlesque antics
of the principals. William Fitzhugh,
'26, as the Squire, is guaranteed to
cause a continual uproar. He is a mai'-
velous di^mbell —a persecuted, hen
pecked husband, who always smiles.
And Dave Mannoccir, as his wife, em
ploys mannerisms that will make the
audience smile —nay, even break out
in mirth. 1
