# CARDS, BEARS MEET TOMORROW NIGHT IN SECOND TITLE GAME
## Stanford Quintet Conceded Edge on Home Court; McHose and Bob Janssen Will Be in Shape 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
It was a grim squad of basketball
players that reported to Jimmie
Davies in the Pavilion yesterday after
noon. They weren't discouraged but
they did look a bit tired and over
worked and very determined.
As for the tired look, a good rest
tonight and tomorrow will do won
ders; but as for the determination,
that will undoubtedly still be with
them when they face the Blue and
Gold quintet in the second game of
the series in the Pavilion tomorrow
night.
The Pavilion doors will be opened
at 6:30 p. m. The faculty section and
the women's rooting section will be
reserved until 7:30.
In spite of the 26-23 defeat Coach
Wight's team handed the Cardinal five
Wednesday night, "Lefty" Rogers and
his men will go into tomorrow night's
fray on their home court with the odds
in their favor. The game will not be
a walk-away for either team. By win
ning from the Conference leaders, the
Bruins have regained some of their
confidence and with their altered line
up should put up a hard fight. With
Kincaid in Captain LeHane's place at
standing guard and Houvenin taking
Douthit's forward position, Coach
Wight's men played their best game
of the season Wednesday. The Cali

fornia coach is also blessed with a
wealth of substitutes. Kyte, who filled
O'Neill's shoes when the latter was
knocked out Wednesday, is a valuable
man and seems to fit into the Blue
and Gold machine perfectly. Belasco
is always ready to step into the fray
in "Dutch" Thompson's place without
materially weakening the team.
With a badly-needed rest, the Stan
ford varsity should play a better game
of basketball tomorrow night than
they did Wednesday. Contrary to re
ports, "Nip" McHose has not a cracked
rib and the shifty little forward will
be in there when the whistle blows.
"Lefty" Rogers showed signs of re
turning to his old form and can prob
ably be counted on to do some scor
ing. Steele's playing has improved so
greatly in the last few games that he
can relieve Janssen most any time
without breaking up the scoring com
bination. "Bob" can always be counted
on to play a good defensive game and
his shots for the basket are finding
their mark regularly.
Dave Oliva proved a stumbling block
for the Bears' offensive in the first game
and should cause them more trouble to
morrow night after a two days' rest.
Dave looks more like Fred Adams in
every game he plays. He has an un
canny ability of knowing where the ball
