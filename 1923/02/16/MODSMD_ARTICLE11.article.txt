# ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN FOR LAST OF FIRST MILLION BEGINS AMONG FRESHMAN STUDENTS ON MONDAY
## 
### 
Stanford students who did not sub
scribe in the initial drive for the First
Million for Stanford, will be given an
opportunity to lead off in the cam
paign for the last quarter of the mil
lion to be contributed by Stanford
undergraduates and alumni.
The campaign on the campus will
start next week under the general
direction of Phil Landis, '23, president
of the Associated Students, and Har
old Anderson, '23.
It was originally intended to raise
only $700,000 of the First Million for
Stanford from students and alumni,
filling out the sum with the $300,000
appropriation of the General Educa
tion Board. The ready response of the
students and alumni, however, indi
cated the feasibility of raising the en
tire million from Stanford's Sons and
daughters, leaving the $300,000 for one
of the new buildings.
An explanation of the new drive, and
praise of the active student body, are
contained in a letter from Lyman
Pierce, who is in charge of the Stan
ford endowment campaign. The letter
follows:
"When last year, the student body
at Stanford subscribed more than
$125,000 the news went through the
college world like a flash. This was
the first movement of its kind on the

Coast. Within a few weeks it Was
being incorporated into the programs
of numerous western institutions.
"The effect upon the alumni has
been probably the most helpful single
element in the success of the First
Million campaign, and it was this loy
alty of the student body which did
more than anything else in deciding
the policy to raise an entire million
from Stanford men and women. It is
accepted as feasible that the entire
million can be raised among students
and alumni, claiming the $300,000
from the General Election Board and
in addition providing a fund of at
least a quarter of a million dollars
which can be used for one of the
buildings if desired.
"It was significant that the student
body took the initiative in the First
Million campaign and set a standard
which insured the success of that un
dertaking. It is still more significant
that the campus leaders now wish to
offer the opportunity to the new mem
bers of the student body and to those
who, for one reason and another, did
not subscribe to the first part of the
undertaking, to lead off in the rais
ing of the first part of the $250,000
required to complete a clean million
from stud«rits and alumni.
"This campus campaign was the
acid test of the value of that intangi
ble thing which is known as college
loyalty. When young men and young
women who Wefe obliged to figure
closely on their resources determined
that they would give amounts rang
ing from $100 up to $1,000, it was an
act which not only rolled up a splen
did result collectively, but it forever
put at rest any question about wheth
er life at Stanford was a mere surface
thing or whether its roots went pretty
deep.
"This movement of the student is
not something which is initiated from
without. There are a few conspicuous
colleges which are distinguished for
the loyalty of their own men and wo
men. Among these colleges, Stanford
has taken a conspicuous place."

closely on their resources determined
that they would give amounts rang
ing from $100 up to $1,000, it was an
act which not only rolled up a splen
did result collectively, but it forever
put at rest any question about wheth
er life at Stanford was a mere surface
thing or whether its roots went pretty
deep.
"This movement of the student is
not something which is initiated from
without. There are a few conspicuous
colleges which are distinguished for
the loyalty of their own men and wo
men. Among these colleges, Stanford
has taken a conspicuous place."
Stanford students who did not sub
scribe in the initial drive for the First
Million for Stanford, will be given an
opportunity to lead off in the cam
paign for the last quarter of the mil
lion to be contributed by Stanford
undergraduates and alumni.
The campaign on the campus will
start next week under the general
direction of Phil Landis, '23, president
of the Associated Students, and Har
old Anderson, '23.
It was originally intended to raise
only $700,000 of the First Million for
Stanford from students and alumni,
filling out the sum with the $300,000
appropriation of the General Educa
tion Board. The ready response of the
students and alumni, however, indi
cated the feasibility of raising the en
tire million from Stanford's Sons and
daughters, leaving the $300,000 for one
of the new buildings.
An explanation of the new drive, and
praise of the active student body, are
contained in a letter from Lyman
Pierce, who is in charge of the Stan
ford endowment campaign. The letter
follows:
"When last year, the student body
at Stanford subscribed more than
$125,000 the news went through the
college world like a flash. This was
the first movement of its kind on the

Coast. Within a few weeks it Was
being incorporated into the programs
of numerous western institutions.
"The effect upon the alumni has
been probably the most helpful single
element in the success of the First
Million campaign, and it was this loy
alty of the student body which did
more than anything else in deciding
the policy to raise an entire million
from Stanford men and women. It is
accepted as feasible that the entire
million can be raised among students
and alumni, claiming the $300,000
from the General Election Board and
in addition providing a fund of at
least a quarter of a million dollars
which can be used for one of the
buildings if desired.
"It was significant that the student
body took the initiative in the First
Million campaign and set a standard
which insured the success of that un
dertaking. It is still more significant
that the campus leaders now wish to
offer the opportunity to the new mem
bers of the student body and to those
who, for one reason and another, did
not subscribe to the first part of the
undertaking, to lead off in the rais
ing of the first part of the $250,000
required to complete a clean million
from stud«rits and alumni.
"This campus campaign was the
acid test of the value of that intangi
ble thing which is known as college
loyalty. When young men and young
women who Wefe obliged to figure
closely on their resources determined
that they would give amounts rang
ing from $100 up to $1,000, it was an
