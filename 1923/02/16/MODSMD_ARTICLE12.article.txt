last few minutes of tlwir final league
contest and won from Delta Kappa
Epsilon 15-11. This victory gives Beta

Delta Tau Delta showed a clever
brand of floorwork and dribbling in
their contest with Delta Chi and were
nevpr in danger of defeat.
In the first half De Bach tallied
from the floor twice and counted a
total of twelve points to three for

Delta Chi before time was called. Suf
fern and Tritle were unable to get
through the defense of Delta Tau
Delta and failed to make a single
field goal until the second period. Dur
ing the last half Delta Chi outplayed
Delta Tau Delta. De Bach and Mixon
were the mainstays of the Delta Tau
Delta offense as were Tritle and Suf
fern for Delta Chi.
Beta Theta Pi entered their contest
with Delta Kappa Epsilon with every
thing to lose and as a result none of
the players got over their nervousness
until the last three minutes of play
when Tibbe caged two goals from
hard positions, giving his team the
lead.
The Delta Kappa Epsilon players
showed a surprising strength of at
tack and carried the ball into Beta
Theta Pi territory during most of the
game. Steffen and D. L. Fuller played
well at the forward positions.
Phi Kappa Psi got the jump on El
Tigre and accumulated eight points to
two for El Tigre in the first few min
utes. Three pretty shots by Stillman,
Woodhead. and Butterfield evened up
the count. Phi Kappa Psi led at the
half 12-8. From then on they had
things own way. Newlin snared

five shots while his mate at forward
counted twice. Knox tallied three
times on follow-up shots. Stillman got
loose under the basket time after
time and with better teamwork by his
teammates could have tallied oftener.
Woodhead played a fast floor game for
El Tigre.
