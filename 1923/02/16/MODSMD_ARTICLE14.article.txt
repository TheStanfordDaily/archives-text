ernoon with either Santa Cruz High

The Dinks put up some real baseball
in a practice game with the second var
sity yesterday afternoon. The contest
went into an extra inning, when Lucas
connected with a single through second
base, stole second, and came home on a
wild pitch. Deffebach, trying to pull the
game out of the fire for the older men
in the last of the inning, poled out an
attenuated hit which looked like Pab?
Ruth at his best, but he found the ball
at the home plate before he could reach
there. Nevers,' Green, and Kohler ran
him between third and home for some
time and then saved the day for the
fighting babes by tagging him out. A
final score of 1 to 0 sent the Dinks home
happy.
