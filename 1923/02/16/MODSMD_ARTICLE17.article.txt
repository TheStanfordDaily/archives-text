# BASEBALL VARSITY 10 MEET OLYMPIC TEAM TOMORROW
## Clubmen Are Speedy Bunch; Former Blue and Gold Star Will Heave Against Cards 
### Bradley Riter 
Back in ancient times, Mercury ram
paged about with midget wings attached
Ito his heels. When the Olympiads began
;to be held and the speed god had uc
! parted to the mount, the wings were
j oassed on down to posterity. Today,
, tliey repose on the hoofs of the athletes
I who tight under the Olympic Club colors.
The San Francisco Olympians deserve
these historic appendages, for they have
: proved themselves a scrappy and speedy
bunch. Their baseball team this year,
an excellent example along this line, will
j cross bats with Stanford's nine tomor
row afternoon op the varsity field, and
j 'he mix-up promises to be the hardest
j fought game on the local lot so far this
. season.
The visitors have one of the best com
binations in these parts. A winning
j heaver from the California varsity of
last year, coupled with a Coas£ Leaguer,
I r.nd some brilliant semi-pro players, ex
plain their present position in the buse
j ball world.
Morrow Will Pitch
Morrow will be remembered as the
I gentleman who held the Card slabsters
| to four hits in the deciding game of the
j Stanford-California series las*t spring,
and reports from the Golden Gate .ire
to the effect that he can sling just as
moan and elusive pellet as ever. Captain
Peavy was the only Stanford man to
find the ball last year to any degree of
accuracy, getting three hits out of four
times up. If the other varsity men to
morrow do anything like Claude did last
j spring—a complete rout might be in qr-
I der. But. of course, this is only a
| possibility.
Then there is a fellow named Burns,
iand veterans of last year's varsity
haven't forgotten him. He was the stal
wart first sacker who broke up the
Olympic-Stanford clash by driving out
a mean hit, the direct cause of three
runs crossing the platter—and Stanford's
defeat. Burns has always been an op-'
portune hitter, and it wouldn't be sur
prising if he does something real 801-1
sheviky with the stick tomorrow.
Other Stars on Lineup
Fans remember Toomey—well, "Crip'
of California, will be the Olympics' back-j
stop, and word has it that he's a good
one. Kelly belongs to the family of;
Kellys so renowned in baseball worldom.
This particular gentleman on the family
tree is an expert fly chaser and, like his!
big brothers, is a good stickster.
Starisinich, a hard name to pronounce,
and a much more difficult man to stop,
is slated for duty on the second sack,
while Harrigan will do the shortstop- j
ping. Both of these men played against
Stanford in the French-American game
last Saturday and did some good field- :
ing.
Cards Slipping Fast
With such an array of talent, |
might be inclined to think that Stanford
was due for a good drubbing, but this;
is hardly possible. Before the seas:> <!
progresses much further, someone will
have a pretty difficult time keeping th.
laurels out of the Cards' possession.
Coach Wolter thinks he has a promising j
bunch and he maintains that his men are
improving and becoming more consistent i
in their play day by day. He had rather
doubted this before, but now he knows j
it. Just last Saturday, they outsluggecl
the Bankers, but slippery fingers lost i
them the game.
