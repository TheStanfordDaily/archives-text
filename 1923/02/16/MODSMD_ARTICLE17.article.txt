Back in ancient times, Mercury ram
paged about with midget wings attached
Ito his heels. When the Olympiads began
;to be held and the speed god had uc
! parted to the mount, the wings were
j oassed on down to posterity. Today,

last year, coupled with a Coas£ Leaguer,

plain their present position in the buse

Peavy was the only Stanford man to
find the ball last year to any degree of
accuracy, getting three hits out of four
times up. If the other varsity men to
morrow do anything like Claude did last
j spring—a complete rout might be in qr-
I der. But. of course, this is only a
| possibility.
Then there is a fellow named Burns,
iand veterans of last year's varsity
haven't forgotten him. He was the stal
wart first sacker who broke up the
Olympic-Stanford clash by driving out
