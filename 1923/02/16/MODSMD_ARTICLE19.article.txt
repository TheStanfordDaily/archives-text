# George Green Is Signed By San Francisco Seals
## 
### 
George Green, '22, captain of last year's
baseball varsity, has been signed by the
San Francisco Coast Leaguers and will
report at Boycs Springs for practice.
Green was recommended by Johnny
Couch, former Stanford heaver, now
with the Cincinnati Reds. Green will
be taken in hand by Sam Agnew and
Archie Yelle, two experienced Seal
backstops, and taught some of the finer
points of the receiving job.
