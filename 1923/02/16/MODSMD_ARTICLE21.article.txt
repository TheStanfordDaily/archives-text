# APPEAL TO NEW STUDENTS
## 
### 
All who entered Stanford this year probably do
not know that the greatest factor in inducing alumni
and the general public to contribute to the First Mil
lion for Stanford drive last spring was the generous
response which came from the students themselves.
Monday a continuation drive will be opened to
allow those new men and women to subscribe to the
endowment fund. It is a significant fact that stu
dents least able to contribute are frequently the first
to come forward, and such an appeal as this may not
serve to loosen the strings of the purses nearest
overflowing. Their owners will learn some day that
we take the most pride in the things that we know
have been built up by our own efforts.
It is not without some swelling- of the chest that
we point out to visitors the construction activity on
the campus and Stanford's national reputation. If
you are one who says, "We did that," let it be the
truth.
