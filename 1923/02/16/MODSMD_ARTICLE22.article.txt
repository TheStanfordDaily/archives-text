# A 						WEEK-END TASK
## 
### 
Final proof of the willingness on the part of liv
ing groups to co-operate with Fire Marshal Lamb
in his efforts to eliminate the fire hazard on the
campus will come next week. At that time repre
sentatives of the National and Pacific Coast boards
of underwriters will make a detailed inspection of
the campus.

With only a few exceptions, Lamb's requests for
aid in cleaning up have been readily complied with,
and as- a result the insurance premium at Stanford
has been reduced to a surprising extent. This week
end will furnish an opportunity for the tardy ones
to make the record perfect.
