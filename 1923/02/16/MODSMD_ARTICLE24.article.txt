IT'S A GOOD IDEA to try the other fellow's
job once in a while. If more journalists would ven

sonalities in dramatic criticism. If more fireside

peanut politicians would sit down before a type
writer once in a while, there would be fewer attempts
to dictate editorial policies.
But, perhaps, it is those very tendencies that make
campus life interesting.
