DOES GREEK MEET BARB?

There is an indelible barrrier between the fraternity
and non-fraternity men in colleges and universities, ac
cording to "Town and Gown," a recently published book
of college life which deals with this question in an
episode titled "When Greek Meets Barb."
This attitude on the part of some fraternity members
and non-fraternity students is as foolish as it is futile.
Fortunately, the great majority of students, both frater
nity and non-fraternity, are level-headed and broad
minded men and women who pay no serious regard to
affiliation or lack of it on the part of their friends and
associates. Regardless of the fraternity situation, a
student who has ability will have no trouble in succeed
ing in university life.
These fair-minded students realize that a fraternity
is, in fact, only a social club —a convenient place to
stay; and that membership in one of these organizations
adds no real prestige to a student and lack of affiliation
detracts none from the real worth and standing of an
individual. A clear understanding of the true condition
will lead the few who nurture bitterness or assume
"airs" to cast aside these characteristics as being un
worthy of a university student.— (The Daily Texan.)
