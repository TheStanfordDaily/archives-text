# OHIO STATE STUDENTS JUGGLE SCHEDULE FOR HOSE
## 
### 
Proof that politicians are not the
only ones who are familiar with the
power of bribes is shown in the regis
trar's office the first few days of col
lege.
One desperate lad at Ohio State
promised the woman who arranged his
courses a pair of silk hose if she
would change his schedule, while an
other produced a $5 bill. Needless to
say, the gifts were not accepted and
the donors were turned away with
schedules unchanged.
