### 
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY —When
recently asked the question "What ten
books would you choose to take with
you if you were destined to spend the
rest of your life on a desert island?"
eight members of the Princeton fac
ulty made out lists which included
Shakespeare in every case. Homer's
"Odyssey" was included in every list
but one, and six professors selected
the Bible. The "Outline of History"
and Kipling's Collected Verse were
among the modern books chosen,
which were in a distinct minority.
