"Cake of soap."
"I'll pung that!"
"Three aces and a wild deuce —•
HOT water!"
"Oh, WORD! And I've got a bob
tailed flush!"
So runs the new language of the
California co-ed. Since Pan-Hellenic
rose up in wrath and decreed that
bridge players must work in three
eight-hour shifts, Stephens hall has
been steadily taking on a mixed
character of Hong Kong and Ed

throned the finesse, the trump and
the dummy. "Poker? Why not?"
say the Berkeley queens. Echo an
swers, "Why not?"
"Cake of soap."
"I'll pung that!"
"Three aces and a wild deuce —•
HOT water!"
