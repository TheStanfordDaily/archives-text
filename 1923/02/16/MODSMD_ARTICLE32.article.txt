# Gordon Davis and Seib Have Many Experiences While Touring in Orient
## 
### 
Chinese stage hands who speak no
English, dash behind the scenes. Gor
don Davis, '18, and Les Seib, '22, rush
after them and try to understand their
jabbering lingo.
Davis, who is on leave of absence
from his position in the University as
dramatic coach, is acting and direct
ing for the T. Daniel Frawley Com
pany now touring the Orient. Seib is
taking leads in various plays pro
duced. The company has already
played Honolulu, Hilo, Peking, Shang
hai, Yokohama, and Manila. It is now
in Calcutta and will go next to Bom
bay. After stops in Burma, the players
will return to America via China,
Japan, and the Philippines.
"The Gold Diggers" was produced
in Yokohama. Davis writes that he
secured the most wonderful embroi
deries and throws of the rarest Ori
ental stuff with which to dress the
stage, and also magnificent vases and
ornaments. The stage looked wonder
ful and the place was packed.
"We play to an entirely white shirt
front audience," Davis says. "After
one performance at Kobe, the ball
room was cleared and a big dance was
held at which all the elite were pres
ent —English and American with a
few Japanese in formal reception
clothes, together with some Japanese
girls, very smart and attractive in
their native dress and who danced
cleverly in the little sandals they
wore. They were quite at home and
European except for their dinner
dress."
Davis also writes of dinner in a
restaurant by th\3 beach where, after
leaving their sandals at the door, they
followed a narrow passageway, crossed
a garden and came finally into a small
Japanese room with a sliding panel
for a door. "We sprawled in our stock
ing feet with our coats off while a
Japanese girl brought the food. The
main and only dish was a filet of beef,
cooked over hot coals sunken in the
table upon which we ate. It was de
licious and we shoveled and poked it
into our mouths with chop sticks. We
drank hot saki, tea, and beer."
Davis says that he has collected a
great deal of material from the Ori
ental stage for use in his course at the
University.

one performance at Kobe, the ball
room was cleared and a big dance was
held at which all the elite were pres
ent —English and American with a
few Japanese in formal reception
clothes, together with some Japanese
girls, very smart and attractive in
their native dress and who danced
cleverly in the little sandals they
wore. They were quite at home and
European except for their dinner
dress."
Davis also writes of dinner in a
restaurant by th\3 beach where, after
leaving their sandals at the door, they
followed a narrow passageway, crossed
a garden and came finally into a small
Japanese room with a sliding panel
for a door. "We sprawled in our stock
ing feet with our coats off while a
Japanese girl brought the food. The
main and only dish was a filet of beef,
cooked over hot coals sunken in the
table upon which we ate. It was de
licious and we shoveled and poked it
into our mouths with chop sticks. We
drank hot saki, tea, and beer."
Davis says that he has collected a
great deal of material from the Ori
ental stage for use in his course at the
University.
