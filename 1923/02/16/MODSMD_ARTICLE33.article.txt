Stanford golfers will meet the Menlo
Country Club team Saturday afternoon
at 1 :30 on the club links in the first
match of the quarter. The Stanford
men have had little practice this spring
due to weather conditions and the lack
of golf privileges on any nearby links.
Arrangements are now being made for
practice on the Menlo course.
The team to compete Saturday will
consist of eight men. Thcv are: Put
nam, Miller. Hirschman, Hovey, Chase,
Hines, Ditzler, and Van Keuren.
