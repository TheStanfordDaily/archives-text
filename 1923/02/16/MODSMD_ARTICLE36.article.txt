# BUSINESS NOW PREFERRED AT HARVARD AS VOCATION
## 
### 
Business is now preferred as a voca
tion at Harvard. Students are going
into business after graduation to the
neglect of the professions such as law,
education, and the ministry. Dr. Low
ell, president of Harvard, urges that
younger students enter college and fit
themselves for citizens as well as to
make a living.
