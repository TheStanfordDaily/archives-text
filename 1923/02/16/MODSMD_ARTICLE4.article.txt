# Historic Hermit Mine To Be Reconstructed By Stanford Students
## 
### 
After lying idle since the death of
the Stanford hermit, the old Hermit
Mine, located one mile east of Sears
ville lake, will be unwatered and re
timbered by Stanford mining students
this spring vacation. The mine "will
serve as a model and will furnish
working samples for geology and min
ing classes.
The work is being financed by an
anonymous donor. The University is
furnishing supplies and has hauled
materials to the mine. Charles Mer
rill, graduate student in mining, is in
charge of the work.
Operations were started during the
Christmas vacation, when $SOO was
expended. About forty feet a day was
unwatered from the 1293-foot shaft,
but dne to later rains the shaft waa
soon filled again. The work was done
by L. A. Creglow, '22, Gene Davis, '20,
and Charles Merrill. Professors W. F.
Deitrick and Theodore Hoover assist
ed in superintending the work and
procuring the supplies.
The minerals are lead, silver, and
xinc, associated with limestone. The
silver assays $90 to the ton, but as
thw vein is but one inch in width, it is
thought that it would not pay to de
velop it.
Until a few years ago, the shaft was
unknown for it had been stopped up
with timbers. Professor Hoover dis
covered its depth when a sounding
line lowered into the water which
covered (he timbers, by chance fell
through a small space between the
jammed timbers and went to the bot
tom of the shaft.
A dump near the mine indicates
that mining operations had been car
ried on at some earlier date. A drift
had been commenced half way up the
side of the shaft but only for a few
feet.
