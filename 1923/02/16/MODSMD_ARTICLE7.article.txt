# OREGON BANS FLOWERS CONCLUSIVELY

### 
UNIVERSITY OF OREGONâ€”After
two weeks of acrimonious debate the
Pan-Hellenic Council voted 9 to 2

at the time of a formal dance given
by a women's organization. The small
but clamorous minority immediately
issued an unofficial ultimatum that
flowers are still expected at fraternity
dances.
