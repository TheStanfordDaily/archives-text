# Basketball Score Too Close for Comfort; Big Thrills Shake Rooters
## 
### Aileen Hicks, '26 
Stanford and California mix like
tobasco sauce and ice cream, and the
tobasco sauce was certainly evident
in the glorious tussle the wild-eyed
| basketball fans witnessed on Satur
i day night. There was one thing about
that game—no one, in his most peace
ful moments, could accuse the strug
gle of being devoid of thrills. Eighteen
I to seventeen is a. nerve-racking score.
Twelve to six at half time might have
looked suspicious to the California
| aggregation, but they forgot that it
1 takes something like a six-point lead
Ito get the old Cardinal started. W«
didn't. "And they were wrong and
we were right, and we certainly
showed some fight that night" (to a
familiar tune).

When Oliva shot that pretty field
; goal from the middle of the court, the
tide turned in our favor. The roaring
of the surf in a Iveavy sea was mild
j compared to the uproar which ensued
] when we made the score 16-15. Ain't
it a grand and glorious feelin'? The
; uproariously rooting feminine fans al
i most fell off the bleachers in the ex
! citement. If they had, it probably
wouldn't have bothered them much
except that they might hav« missed
a minute or two of the game.

"Nip" assumed a prayerful expres
. sion when caging the fouls. "Oh,
Lord! Let it go in!" Who says prayers
aren't answered? Games like the Sat
urday battle convert more people to
the cause of religion than camp meet
ings.

Dr. Jordan was given an ovation
fit for a king when he arrived in the
Pavilion about an hour before the
game.

Anderson hit the floor for a row of
slides during a large f>art of the
game. A foul was called on him when
he was biting the dust near the end
of the game. The irony of fate!

"To Hell with the Gold and Blue"
was the burden of everyone's song
after the party on Cal. So say we all!
We'll get you yet! You bet!
