# Final Rally Led By McCandless, Peavy Defeats Olympic Club 7-6
## 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
And so it came to pass that in the |
beginning of the ninth chapter, great
things did happen. McCandless, who
did enter the "Farm" from Inglewood,
did right, mightily and merrily swat
the sphere. And Peavy, not wishing
to be outdone, did aptly join in the
festivities and do likewise. At this
time, two gods of Olympus foozled
and three runs did cross the platter,
and Stanford won, and the Olympic
Club from the far-famed metropolis of
San Francisco did board thfe train
that night with the bacon on some
one else's doorstep. And in the land
of the Cards that samt? evening great
things did happen, and all was merri
ment, and shouting, and great revelry
did prevail.
Cards Rally and Win
Coming from behind in its half of
the ninth inning Saturday afternoon,
Stanford's varsity made two hits and
with the aid of a couple of wild
throws, chalked up three tallies and
won the most spectacular game
played on the local lot this season.
The final count was, Stanford 7;
Olympic Club 6. No men had been
retired on the Cardinal's side when
the winning run crossed the plate.
McCandless, first man up for Stan
ford in the last frame, singled. The
Olympics' third sacker made a wild
throw to the initial sack, and Mac
continued his Journey around to third.
Captain Peavy poled out a hot one
through first, scoring McCandless.

Patterson was safe on fielder's choice.
Starasicinch recovered the ball and
heaved it to third in an attempt to
snag off Peavy who was doing some
lusty globe trotting. The ball went
wild, Peavy crossed the rubber—and |
the score was tied. Patterson reposed
safely on third.
None were down and the bleachers
awoke and howled for the winning
tally. "Lefty" May went in as a pinch
hitter for Sotomon and was getting
already to biff the ball when the
Winged-0 twirler made a wild pitch,
and Patterson came home with the
' final marker for the day and the run
that turned what seemed to be almost
, certain defeat into well-earned vic
: torv.
Teague Works Well
Jim Teague started on the mound
for the varsity and did some fine
twirling, allowing but two hits in five
innings, and bagging three strikeouts.
Coach Wolter thought the Winged-0
sticksters were beginning to find
Teague's stuff, so he substituted Solo
mon in the sixth to avert disaster if
such should be forthcoming. Soly
worked almost as well, only two hits
being gathered from his offerings.
Four runs were made, however,
through erratic fielding support.
Morrow, who did the heaving for
the visitors, held the Cards to four
hits in the final game of the Stanford-
