## STANFORD SCORING COMBINA TION OVERCOMES CALIFORNIA LEAD IN FINAL PERIOD AND EVENS SERIES Two Baskets By Fred Anderson Put Cardinals In Lead; Oliva, McHose Start Scoring 
### Don Liebendorfer 
Free throws were trumps in the Pa
vilion Saturday night. Johnnie Talt
held eleven of them, but Nip McHose
played the ace in the last few minutes
and the Cardinal varsity won the second
game of the series, 18-17.
Contrary to Hoyle, it was a small slam
for the Cards—very small in fact—but
just big enough to give them a firmer
hold on the championship of the southern
division of the Pacific Coast Conference.
The Bruins didn't even have simple hon
ors. "Lefty" Rogers and his gang had
them all.
As for suit—Andy Kerr's team had
plenty of it, although they didn't start
gathering in the tricks until the second
half. Some of the dubious Stanford
supporters were afraid that t|ie red
shirts had concealed their cards too long
but that timely rally in the final period
did the work.
Card Defense Strong
The game was the hardest fought, and
in places the roughest game seen on a

Stanford court in several years. Neither
team took any chances and botli had
the five-man defense down to a science.
The Stanford defense was by far the
more deadly in the second half. By turn
ing the Bear offense back without a held
basket in the second period, the Cards
proved to the satisfaction of all their
supporters that they are of champion
ship class.
As in the first battle of the series,
"Nip" McHose broke the ice in the first
two minutes. Johnnie Talt tried to con
tinue some of the tactics he used in the
game last Wednesday, but Sam Moyer
gave the ball to "Nip" and the flashy lit
tle forward counted the first point. And
then the real fun began. After the ball
went up in center the play see-sawed
from one end of the court to the other.
The forwards could scarcely get within
speaking distance of the hoop and were
forced to try repeated long shots.
O'Neill's attempt from the center of
the court bounded from the backboard
into "Lefty" Rogers' hands and the Stan
ford skipper dribbled the length of the
court, only to be stopped by Kincaid
I under California's basket. The Bruins
carried the pellet down to the Cardinal
| goal, where Bob Jansscn's overanxiety ,
| to get his hands on it cost the Cards two
! free throws. Talt made one of them
and the count was knotted at 1-1.
Bears Take Lead
At this point, the Blue and Gold scor
j ing machine swung into action. O'Neill
sunk a pretty one from side-court. Talt
made his second personal foul and "Nip"
missed. Huovenin took the ball down
the court, shot, caught the ball on the
rebound, and gave the Bears a 5-1 lead
with a difficult shot. McHose sunk a
! free one a minute later and the score
stood 5-2.
After "Nip" and Anderson had missed
I hard shots by inches, Dave Oliva com
mitted a personal and Talt added two
more points for California. "Lefty"
' Rogers offset this a moment later with
a long shot from side-court and the
scoreboard said 7-4. Stanford took time
out and on the next play Talt was called
for his third personal foul. "Nip"
missed and Talt sunk another free one
when Bob Tanssen was caught with his
i second personal foul. Steele substituted
for the big center, who went out to take
a rest.
McHo§e scored the last points in the
[first half for the Stanford five on two
| free throws and the count was 8-6. The
little forward missed two long shots by)
small margins and gave Talt another
point on a personal foul a minute later, j
O'Neill caged his second pretty one from
the side of the court and the Cards'
trailed, 11-6. A personal on Anderson
gave Talt a chance for another free one!
and he made it as the half ended with
Coach Wight's team on the long end of
a 12-6 score.
"Nip" started the fireworks in the;
second half with a beautiful shot from
the side-court near the center of the
floor. Dave Oliva added two more on
the next play with the longest shot of ;
the game. As the Cardinal forwards;
were all busy entertaining the Bruin
guards, the big guard calmly tossed one'
in from the center of the court at a diffi-j
cult angle. Things began to look bad 1
for California and the Bruins called;
time out, Coach Wight sending Kyte in
for Huovenin. McHose came within j
one point of tying the score on a free j
one and Anderson put the Cards in the
lead with a pretty one under the h00p.,!
13-12. "Andy" still wasn't satisfied and
increased the lead to three points a min-j
ute later.
The Bruins were fast going to pieces
and called time out again. Kincaid was
guilty of another personal foul and
"Nip" made it 17-12. Talt added two|
points on a personal on Oliva. Wight j
sent Huovenin back into the game for
Belasco and Captain LeHane for Kin-1
caid. Korr sent Janssen in to relieve j
Steele. Huovenin got in just in time
to give the Cardinals their last point of J

the game on a free throto by McHose;
18-14.
Talt made a free one on a personal
and another on a technical. Stanford
rooters were imploring the timer to end
the game. The Bruin forward had an
opportunity to tie the score when An
derson fouled LeHane under the Stan
ford basket. He missed one and it was
18-17. There was a minute to go. The
ball was under the Stanford hoop with
ten men fighting desperately for it. The
timer raised the gun ns O'Neill's one
handed shot missed by inches. Kyte
missed a long one and the game was
over.
Johnnie Talt. with eleven free throws
out of thirteen attempts was the high
point man of the game. "Nip" McHose
followed him closely with a field goal
and eight free ones. Talt was so closely
watched that he did not get a chance
to score from the field.
There was little to choose between the
playing of Janssen and Steele at center
for Kerr's team. Both played great de
fensive basketball and covered the floor
in fine style. Anderson showed that he
has completely recovered from the south
ern trip by guarding well at all times
and sinking a pair of field goals. Oliva
was bad medicine for the Bruin scoring
combination and did not allow a goal
from under the basket. Rogers played
his usual fast floor game and sunk one
field basket.
Kincaid at standing guard and O'Neill
at center did good work for California.
