# IN MEMORIAM
## 
### 
The Dramatic Council passed away quietly Fri
day afternoon. Except in the immediate family, the
demise was accompanied by no great mourning.
Death was due to an overdose of artistic tempera
ment, complicated by internal disorders which were
difficult to diagnose. Interment will be made by
Executive Committee.
Insinuations' and counter-insinuations dropped
during the joint meeting of English Club, Executive
Committee, representatives and the Dramatic Coun
cil, which preceded the abolition of the latter body,
showed that inability to work co-operatively rather
than any intentional wrong has been the greatest
drawback to efficiency in the management of campus
productions.
The campus as a whole does not care a great deal
about the inner workings of whatever organization
controls the presentation of plays, it is interested
in getting satisfaction when it pays good prices for
seats in the Assembly hall, it is evident that satis
faction has not been forthcoming recently, and a few
more performances like the last two will see our
Thespians playing to empty seats.
The new plan will give almost absolute control to
the dramatic coach. He will be given power to se
lect aides with whom lie will be able to work har
moniously. For those who object to turning over to
a faculty member the final word in a student enter
prise, it is pointed out that nobody has ever doubted
the wisdom of giving the football coach absolute
authority over the players in his charge.
Experience has shown that it is also necessary at
times to have some kind of check upon coaches
whose ambitious ideas tax the coffers of the organi
zation presenting the play. Under the proposed sys
tem, actual handling of accounts will be in the hands
of a student dramatic manager, who will examine
the treasury and the money-getting possibilities of
each play. He will then limit the amount to be spent
upon lighting, costuming and the other elements
behind the curtain which run up the bills.
There is nothing final or unalterable about the
proposals made to Executive Committee, but last
week's teapot tempest proved that friction was re
tarding efficiency in the presentation of Stanford
shows. The creation of a dramatic council was
hailed at the time as a great triumph for co-operative
management. In theory there are many beautiful
defenses for its existence. There is as yet no proof
that there will not be difficulties to be encountered
under the new system.
Let it be hoped that the experimentation will not
have to be made at further expense to Stanford
audiences.
