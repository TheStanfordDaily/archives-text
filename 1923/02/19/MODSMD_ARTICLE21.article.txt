It is a popular pastime, indulged in by not a few
of us, to smile cynically at the mention of "Stanford
spirit" and at collegiate rah-rahism. But we defy
any man or woman on the campus to sit calmly
through a game like that of Saturday night. There
was no time for an analysis of the psychological rea
sons which caused the men on the floor to fight like
demons. There was no time for philosophical re
flections upon the sentimentality connected with
college spirit.
It was more than the desire to play good basket
ball which made those men fight as they did. It was
more than a reasonable interest in watching a good
athletic contest which caused the Pavilion crowd to
tear its hair and shout itself hoarse.
I'hat game was an intoxicant for those who have
I>eeu watching our teams go down to defeat before
C alifornia time after time—and there is no hangover.
If you are still inclined to sneer at the reality of
Stanford spirit—go to Berkeley Wednesday night.
