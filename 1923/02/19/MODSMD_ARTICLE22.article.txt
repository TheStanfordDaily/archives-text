# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
On with the new! And let no man say that this
Cabbage column can't keep up with the best of them
when it comes to the latest trend in literature. No
gosh-durned cynic can out-cynic us, by gravy; we can
make cold remarks about the world (which we have
viewed largely through the type-cluttered pages of
iconoclastic books; but no matter, that!) as well as
the next. Here goes! Under the cover of our initials
we shall put out —
THE CYNIC'S NUMBER
First requisite of the cynic's art is general disability
in everything. The fool who can't excel in anything
can at least criticize.
* * *
The next seems to be to put your remarks in short
elliptical sentences.
* * *
The third is to write over the heads of your readers.
The only way Cabbages could do this would be to hire
a second-story office.

"Humor," says Mark Twain, "is an unexpected sur
prise," What a laugh a murdered man must get!

Once there was a Child who was fond of Grapes. In
the company of other Children this Child one day went
to a Wild Grape Vine where the Fruit grew high above
the ground. All of the Boys rushed for the luscious
Fruit, our Child among them. Time after Time he
tried to reach some of the Fruit, but each time some
•stronger urchin pulled him back and himself appropri
ated the Grapes. When all the Grapes were in the
mouths and hands of the others, the Child sat back and
mocked them for fighting so over the Fruit.
"Do you not know,"he scoffed, "that those grapes are
not worth the picking? I am sure that they are sour."
But the other Urchins only laughed and kept their
grapes. They were modern Children and had often
read Aesop's fables!

But we have said enough about cynicism. After we
have showed that Cabbages is capable of all that high
brow stuff, we ain't agoin' to do it any more. We be
lieve that our readers like the simple stuff.
