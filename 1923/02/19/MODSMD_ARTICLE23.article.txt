# WITH TEMERITY

"The Devil enters the prompter's box and the play is
ready to start."
I am a very gentle person: three sips of a very mild
claret stimulates me profoundly; so I have never dared
take anything stronger. All this week I have been
wondering what would come of the recent hazing scan
dal. Of course I was pleased to lind that someone had
held an idea for —how long was it? —three years, and
more than that I was delighted to find that somehow
he had vindicated himself for having the idea. But
all the italics, the legal phraseology, the list of names,
and the talk about traps rather frightened me. They
were large gestures made melodramatically.
Then I thought perhaps I was a fool to think so, when
I ought to applaud. But if one is timid, one must re
main calm.
So many things have been tried. Once there was
faculty supervision; then there was a, Men's Council —
and I wonder how many of us realize what a dismal
mess that would be but for the presence of one of the
finest men I've ever met at its head —and now there is
to be something done by the seniors. Really, it's very
difficult to keep straight who should do what nowadays.
For my part I have never seen why the frosh
shouldn't discipline themselves. The problem of disci
pline is the problem of finding sensible men, and they
never come in classes. I should like to see the sensible
ones among the frosh do what they thought ought to
be done to their own classmates.
On the whole I'm very glad I'm timid. Nothing is
more disastrous than to be bitten by an idea; so I have
no special pleas to make for anything or for anybody.
In fact I must admit I am suspicious of people with
ideas: they are so excitable. And then they never do
any good. How long have frosh been disciplined? I
remember reading the other day of one at Harvard who
was paddled by a night watchman along about 1646,
which would make the time nearly three hundred years.
And still there are sophomores, juniors, seniors, and
faculty members who seem just as stupid.
