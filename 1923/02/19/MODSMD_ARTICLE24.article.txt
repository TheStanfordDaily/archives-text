# KNIGHTIE KNIGHT ALMOST ARRIVES IN SPITE OF ALL
## 
### Hal Rorke, '24 
It seems too bad that both practiced
playwrights and experienced coaches
should run out at the same time.
"Knightie Knight" was built upon
sound enough ideas to justify the word
"Lurlesque" being printed on the pro
gram cover, but like the vocal efforts
of the leading lover, it never quite ar
rived.
The chorus failed to box its oppon
ent and amateurism won the inside
track in the first act. Except for occa
sional spurts during action in which
the Glendunning family featured, the
show never quite caught up until the
second act, when things moved with
something of the usual roar.
The second act was unusually blest.
With "Susie," and "The Inn of the
Golden Horn," easily the most engag
ing numbers in the show, it here
gathered enough momentum to carry
through the rest of the evening, with
the help of the unusually good music
in the third act.
The ending, however, seemed un
justly cruel. Why the pest, which al
most succeeded in annoying the char
acters as much as the audience, was
not locked up in an enchanted cavern
along with the man whose idea it was
to create an ingenue out of a boxer

and a soloist out of a mustache, in
stead of a decent sort of a knight
with a good voice being confined, is
more than we could detect unaided
by opera-glasses.
With almost no exceptions, the old
stagers were the outstanding actors,
saving one or two tyros whose natural
equipment helped them qualify. It was
the usual chorus. There is no doubt
that the musical program was more
skilfully presented than the dramatic
part of the offering.
However, it's all fun. Ram's Head
has another title to print on the pro
gram and thirteen new and interested
members to add to the roll. And who
can deny that it was all very amusing,
whether the laughs came in the right
places or not.
One more show which has lived,
triumphed, and danced away. To the
man who writes the epitaph for
"Knightte Knight's" monument we
suggest the analogy to the following
verse:
What a queer bird the frog are.
When he stand, he sit —almost.
When he hop, he fly—almost.
He aint got no sense hardly
He ain't got no tail hardly, neither,
j When he sit, he sot on what he ain't
got—ALMOST!
