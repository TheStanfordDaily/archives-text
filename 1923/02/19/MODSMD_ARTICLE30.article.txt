Can Stanford maintain its present
academic standards and still hope for
j success in intercollegiate athletics? This
question was put to a number of men
who are qualified to speak on the prob
lem, and the opinions they advanced
are collected in an article by Ed Landels.
President Wilbur, Dr. T. M. Williams,
president of the Board of Athletic Con
trol ; Dud DeGroot, Harry Maloney, and
Professor A. M. Cathcart offered some
suggestions which, if followed, it is
thought will aid materially in the ad
justment between athletics and studies
here at Stanford.
Holbrook Blinn, who has been playing
at the Alcazar in San Francisco in "The
Good Bad Man," is a Stanford man and
was the first stage director the Univer
sity ever had. He was also one of the

on the campus being edited and managed
by him. The success and failure of that
publication is told by Garrett Elmore.
The discovery of an interesting tribe
of pigmy Indians in South America, who
stand but two and a half feet high, is
related in an illustrated article by J. C.

Spectator. Urban and several other
geologists composed the second party of
white men to ever visit these people.
Tom Irwin discusses freshmen disci
pline and advances a reason for his re
cent action which helped to bring aboli
tion. Why Stanford's basketball varsity
has been winning so consistently forms

usually attractive.
