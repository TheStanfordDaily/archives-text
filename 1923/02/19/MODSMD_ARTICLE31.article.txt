# Small Crowd Present at First Basketball Rally Before Game With Bears
## 
### 
If numbers are necessary to a success
ful rally, then the gathering in front of
the New Union last Friday night to give
the Stanford Varsity basketball team a
"liig" send off for the California game
was a dismal failure.
With Eddie Lamb's fire truck No. 1,
and a motley collection of cow bells, re
volvers, alarm clocks, and whistles, Yell
Leader Lou Minsky and a determined
one hundred or less students did every
thing in their power to give the rally the
lacking punch.
"We of the team are not predicting
what will happen tomorrow night, but
we expect you all there backing us," said
Captain "Lefty" Rogers in addressing
the crowd. "Keep your eyes on the
scoreboard, it never lies, and give us
your undivided support until that final
gun is fired."
Following Captain Rogers' speech,
"Nip" McHose, "Bob" Janssen, and
Dave Oliva gave short talks.
