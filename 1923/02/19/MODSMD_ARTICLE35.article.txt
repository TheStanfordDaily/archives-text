# BILL BLACK MAKES VAULT OF TWELVE FEET NINE INCHES
## 
### 
With a vault of 12 feet 9 inches, Bill
Black won the pole vault in the informal!
varsity and freshman track meet Satur
day morning on the Stanford track, j
Last year at this time Bill was doing
well if he cleared 12 feet. With such
a start for this season he should comej
through with some exceptional work.
The pole vault is one event in which
Stanford will give California plenty of
competition. "Red" Norris is still vault
ing for California, but he will have to I
do some good vaulting to go higher than
Bill Black. Besides Black, Stanford lias!
Phil Scofield and Guy Dennis, both of!
whom can do 12 feet. Scofield cleared
12 feet in the competition Saturday and
when he gains a little more confidence]
he will be able to go higher.
Van Judah stepped 440 yards in 51:3.
Shermund of last year's freshmen took
second and Williamson came in third.
Blink followed the bunch most of the.
way around and then he uncorked a;
pretty sprint at the end, but he did not
have quite enough to overtake the
leaders.
Bill Kemnitzer cleared six feet in the ;
high jump.
