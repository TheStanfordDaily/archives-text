# BABE NINE BURIES WILLIAM WARRENS UNDER 6-0 SCORE
## 
### William Wright, '25 
The 1926 baseball team registered
its second shut-out of the season Sat
urday morning, when William Warren
School went the wrong way by a 6-0
score. The hard-working Ditzler
pitched his usual brilliant ball, strik
ing out twelve of the Manly Boys and
allowing not a single free pass to
first. Two singles and one two-ply
wallop were the only concessions he
made to the baseball ability of the
military, and these came at times
which were distinctly unfavorable to
a score.
Bradshaw, the William Warren
shorstop, gave the babes the only bad
moment of the morning when he
opened the fifth era with a hot single.
With an efficiency remarkable in one
so young, he stole second and third
and then spoiled it by allowing Ditz
ler to pick him off the last way-sta
tion with a pretty throw to Green.
Bradshaw was also responsible for
the other Warren single.
The freshmen put on an agile ex
hibition of base-running, with a totai
of ten stolen bases. Combined with
six one-base blows and a ponderous
triple by Green, the margin of superi
ority was most apparent.
Singles by Lovelace, Draper, and
Meiklejohn aided by three stolen
sacks and a passed ball sent Green
and Draper across the rubber in the
initial round, though Green was cut
off at the plate in an attempted
squeeze play. Three hits brought
three more tallies in the third frame.
Green opened up with a triple and
came in on Draper's infield out to
deep short. Meiklejohn singled, stole
second, and completed the circuit on
Kohler's bingle. Kohler stole second
as a matter of course and came home
standing up when Bradshaw foozled
a drive by Lucas.
The final freshman counter came
over in the sixth division, when Lucas
walked, made third on a mis-cue by
the Warren twirler, and registered
when Bradshaw made another mis
take on Ditzler's wallop.
