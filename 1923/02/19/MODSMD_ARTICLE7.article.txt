# UGLIEST TEXAS MAN WILL WIN NEW BEAUTY CONTEST
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF TEXASâ€”lnspired
by a recent women's beauty contest,
in which eight of the most beautiful
Texas ladies were selected by Flo
Zeigfield, the Texas "Cactus" will hold
a contest for the men on the campus.
Beauty will be outside, as it is to be a
carnival of ugliness with the most
outrageous arrangement of features
taking first prize. Bud Fisher, creator
of Mutt and Jeff, will do the judging
at the risk of nightmares, and the
Cactus staff has generously decided to
avoid charges of favoritism by re
maining out of the contest.
