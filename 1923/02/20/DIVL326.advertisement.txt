"NICE LOOKING CHAP"
THE CONDUCTOR SAID
when he took my ticket.
He had seen Jack help
me and my box of Wil
son's aboard the train.
Pointing his puncher at
the candy he smiled
wise as you please, and
said, "But will he keep
it up?"
I allowed him his little
joke, hut I smiled to my
self, too, and thought,
"Never you worry about
Jack."
