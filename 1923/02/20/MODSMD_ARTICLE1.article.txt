"Cow" Oliva, the big fellow who has
caused the Bruin scoring machine so
much trouble in the first two games of
the series, is confined to the hospital
with a cold and a slight fever, but re
ports indicate that he is getting along
well, and will be in shape for the third
battle tomorrow night.

Billy Kerr, who brings the title of
interscholastic champion of the mile
to college with him, is in the hospital
with a bad case of "flu," which might
hamper his running when he is able
to take up the training routine once
more. ✓

There may be a forward on the
Pacific Coast who plays the floor bet
ter than Captain "Lefty" Rogers. If
there is, he hasn't been seen on the
Pavilion court. "Lefty" is in every
play and is a valuable cog in both
the defense and offense of the Cardi
nal quintet.

Saint Mary's Prep will try to break
the Babe winning streak on the Fresh
man diamond Wednesday afternoon.
The shortage of twirlers forces Coach
Hunt to allow as how they may do it.

Bill Black has been attaining some
high altitudes in the pole vault lately.
He cleared 12 feet 9 inches the other
day and just barely missed clearing
13 feet 1 inch. That's not bad.

Harry Borba told the world at large,
in the San Francisco Call last night,
that Fred Anderson was largely re
sponsible for the Cardinal victory in
the second game of the California
series. And Harry wasn't far wrong at
that. Any man that can keep Johnnie
Talt from sinking a single field basket
and at the same time drop in a couple
himself, deserves loud cheers. And
Fred got them.
Ditzler has been the iron man for
the freshmen. Tod Oviatt has been out
of the game with a bad ankle and
Ernie Nevers still has a tendency to
dribble a baseball, so Ditzler has borne
practically the entire pitching burden
for the first-year boys. The scores
prove that he has borne a mean bur-,
den.

Phil Scofield is another one of Tem
pleton's pole vaulters. He cleared 12 '■
feet Saturday and when he gains a;
little more confidence he should go!
higher.

"Cliff" Ireland will bring joy and
Ireland's Independents to the campus
on Washington's Birthday. The Irish
men tangled with the Cal Varsity not
long ago, and it came out before long
that "Cliff" has lost neither his batting
eye nor his classic blarney.
* * *
"Cliff" has the habit of giving the
opposing team a laughing jag and then
starting an Irish marathon around the
paths. He kidded the Cards out of a
couple of games last season.

Woodhead, in the 158-pound class,
looks like one of the best wrestlers
who has come to Stanford for some
time. Woodhead won his match in the
Davis Farm meet with little difficulty
and should meet with little opposition
tonight. He will be seen in action for
the first time this evening, but he has
had a lot of experience and under
stands the game thoroughly, so he is
by no means a green wrestler.
