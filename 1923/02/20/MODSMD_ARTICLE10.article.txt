# TRYOUTS IN THREE MINOR SPORTS TO BE HELD TONIGHT
## Aspirants for Places on Boxing, Wrestling, and Fencing Teams to Tangle at 7:30 
### 
Tryouts for places on the Stanford
boxing, wrestling, and fencing teams will
be held at 7:30 this evening in the gym
nasium. From the winners in each event
the teams to compete with California in
their different sports will be selected.
A boxing ring has been erected in the
center of the gymnasium floor and the
fencing and wrestling rings will be
placed on each side of this ring. Matches
and bouts will be going on in all the
rings at once, so spectators are insured
of action every minute.
The officials will be as follows: Box
ing—Judges, Dink Tenipleton and Fred
Frehc; referee. H. W. Maloney; an
nouncer. Eddie Lamb; timekeepers, Andy
Kerr and Harry Wolters. Wrestling—
Judges, Vaughn Hosepian and V. Mal
colm. Fencing—Judges, P. Sandretto
and K. Gardner; recorder. E. McGaffery.
Two bouts are scheduled for the 115-
pound class. J. Hard and L. Cannon
are slated for the first and L. Bell and
H. C. Smith will meet in the other.
Hard seems to have the best of things
in this class, as he was selected to fight |
at the recent Davis Farm meet. Cannon
is also a fighter worth considering. E.
Armbruster and F. Tyroler are the 125-
pound fighters. Tyroler has a wicked
wallop and is certain to give Armbruster
a good fight.
Two fast boys were entered in the
135-pound class, Giles and Jimmie Ross,
but Hall hurt his hand yesterday and
will be unable to box. However, Roos'
seems to have the edge on Hall, as he
has won his boxing letter for the past
two years and seems to be going strong
at present. Lane and Adams, and Pene
packcr and Avilla are entered in the 145-
pound class. Johnnie Lane seems to
have the edge here, as he is a letter man
on the team and has had more experi
ence than his other opponents. Trwin
and Stoddard will put on the middle
weight bout.
In the 168-175-pound class McKee and
Van Hook are slated to fight. Both of |
these men are fast and powerful, and j
this bout should be the best of the even
ing because they are evenly matched
McKee lost his match in the Davis Farm
meet after an extra round, while Van
Hook was fighting out of his class that
evening, and also lost after a hard fight.
Robinson and Gifford.will fight in the
heavy-weight class. Both of these lads
are of about the same ability and an even
fight is expected. F. Sturm and L.
Meyer will contend for the 125-pound
wrestling title. Of these two Sturm
seems to have the advantage because of
his past experience. Two matches will
be held in the 135-pound class. L. Dobson
and C. Faggot will stage one and E.
Pallette and J. Quinn will stage the
other. Little can be said about the out
come of these matches, because none of
these men have had any experience
wrestling here. Hosepian, the intercol
legiate 135-pound champion, will prob
ably be selected to represent Stanford
in the 135-pound class.
In the 148-pound class Sievers and
Clendenin will grapple. Clendcnin seems
to have the edge because of his showing
in practice. Woodhead and Jenkins will
wrestle in the 158-pound class. Wood
head is the better of these two if per
formances and experience can be con
sidered prophetic. Whitney and Nichol
son will wrestle in the 175-pound class.
The fencers who will take part tonight
are Richardson, Aguerrevere, Long.
Smith, Monaco, Wallace, Bugge, and
Argall. The two first named have had
the most experience and should give a
fast exhibition of fencing.
