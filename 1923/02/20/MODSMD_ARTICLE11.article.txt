Delta Tau Delta and Phi Kappa Psi
were evenly matched during the first half j
of their game yesterday, the advantage >
finally going to Delta Tau Delta, who!
led. 4-3, at the intermission. A large |
number of fouls were called on both
sides, but neither team had any man
who could shoot from the foul line with
any degree of accuracy. Mixon. who
has made the free throws for Delta Tau
Delta in other games, was off form and
his running mate at forward, De Back,
was too strong on the long shots.
Kolberg played a pood game, making
one counter in the first half and getting
credit for two others in the final period
when he bounced the ball through the
hoop on follow-up shots. Meyers and
Collett worked hard and presented a

stiff defense to the Phi Kappa Psi team,
which was penetrated for only two field
goals, although several more shots
missed the hoop by inches. Newlin and
Wittenburg showed a brilliant class of
teamwork in passing the ball down to
the basket, but their speed was too much
for even themselves, and their shooting
lacked the accuracy shown in other con
-1 tests.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon threw a scare
into the Beta Theta Pi team by emerg
ing from the half with an 8-6 lead over
| their opponents. But the Beta Theta
Pi players got together in the final pe
riod and showed some of the fastest
passing and cutting-in displayed at any
of the intramural court contests. Ala
baster and Granger played the edges of
the floor well and dribbled and passed
their way to the basket with ease, once
they discovered the key to the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon defense, which had proved
nearly impregnable in the first half.
After Alabaster evened things up at
the start of the final period by a pretty
shot from the side of the floor, Mannoc
j cir and Granger tore into the basket and
j caged two goals apiece before the whistle
blew. Mathews played a good game for
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, but was too close
ly guarded to enter the scoring column
on floor shots. Strong and Leh at guard
' held off the Beta Theta Pi forwards
for the first half, but were unable to
i j stop the onslaught of the second period.

number of fouls were called on both
sides, but neither team had any man
who could shoot from the foul line with
any degree of accuracy. Mixon. who
has made the free throws for Delta Tau
Delta in other games, was off form and

was too strong on the long shots.
Kolberg played a pood game, making
one counter in the first half and getting
credit for two others in the final period

hoop on follow-up shots. Meyers and
Collett worked hard and presented a

stiff defense to the Phi Kappa Psi team,
which was penetrated for only two field
goals, although several more shots
missed the hoop by inches. Newlin and
Wittenburg showed a brilliant class of
teamwork in passing the ball down to
the basket, but their speed was too much
for even themselves, and their shooting
lacked the accuracy shown in other con

Sigma Alpha Epsilon threw a scare

Pi players got together in the final pe

passing and cutting-in displayed at any
of the intramural court contests. Ala

the floor well and dribbled and passed
their way to the basket with ease, once
they discovered the key to the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon defense, which had proved
nearly impregnable in the first half.
