# Professor Cottrell Talks On City Manager Plan
## 
### 
Prof. E. A. Cottrell of the Political
Science department gave a talk in
Venice last week campaigning for the
i city-manager form of municipal gov
ernment. He has given several such
talks to the voters in the city.
In the city-manager form the people
: elect by popular vote on a non-partisan
ballot a small council which is re
sponsible for all legislation and for the
work of the city. The work of the city
is organized into five departments. The
i council hires, supervises, and controls
with right to remove a city-manager
whom they place in charge of these
five departments.
The city manager is a well-paid, full
time, non-political central executive
who, in turn, appoints, supervises, and
removes the heads of the work depart
ments. The rank and file of the ad
-1 ministration are under civil service.
