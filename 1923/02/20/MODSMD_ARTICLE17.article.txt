# ENDOWMENT DRIVE MAKES POSSIBLE MANY PROMOTIONS
## Twenty-Two Members of the University Faculty Given Increase in Pay and Rank 
### 
The President's Office today an
-1 nounced the promotion of twenty-two
members of the Stanford faculty which
have been approved by the Board of
Trustees upon recommendation of the
Advisory Board of the Academic Coun
cil. These promotions in rank, with ac
companying salary increases, as well as
a number of other salary increases with
out change in academic title, have been
made possible by the progress of the
Endowment Campaign, which has al
ready placed considerable additional
funds at the disposal of the University.
Nearly half the whole number of re
cent promotions are in the medical fac
ulty, and these have been brought by the
success of the "Medical Million" en
dowment campaign in San Francisco
and the bay cities on behalf of the Stan
ford Medical School. The medical fac
ulty did not share in the benefits of the
original endowment campaign, since the
General Education Board offered its
$300,000 toward a million dollar endow
ment for the purpose of salary increases
outside the professional schools.
