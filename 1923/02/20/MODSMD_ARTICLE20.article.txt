# INCONSISTENCY SOMEWHERE
## 
### 
Now, rather than final examination week, is the
time to check up on our athletes and try to learn
whether the beginning - of the spring quarter is going
to throw Stanford into the dejection precipitated
last month by the announcement that fourteen ath
letes had been taken to the edge of the campus and
dropped off.
It is significant that the great majority of athletes
whom we lose Hunk out or get behind in counts dur
ing the quarter in which they take part in a major
sport. Well-meaning faculty members have pointed
out that being a good athlete and a good student
are not inconsistent. They have asked us to look
to England, where there seems to be no difficulty in
correlating scholarship and sports. But they forget
the intensity which is an inevitable part of the
average American's makeup.
The administration's jxDlicy of building stadiums
and hiring coaches seems to indtcate that they wish
to build up winning teams. But out of what?
Perhaps it is no more reasonable to ask that the
professor make special dispensation for the athlete
than it is to insist that the coach place a man on his
team merely because he has made Phi Beta Kappa.
But, then, how many Phi Beta Kappa's spend any
time on the athletic fields? With the training, prac
tice and concentration which the American system
places upon a sport, the potential "graduated with
distinction" would become "disqualified for further
registration."
This is admittedly a plea for special consideration
this quarter only for those men who have been spend
ing night and day hours on the court —and it is a
plea that will perhaps fall upon unheeding ears. It
will merely be considered the illogical pattering of
an immature mind which has overlooked the real
purpose of a college education. But, while the ad
ministration admits by its every action that the de
velopment of athletics is a real part of its program,
it does not force those of us who are not members
of teams to maintain any standards of athletic
ability.
Such discrimination is unfair to the rest of the
students, it is argued. There are few of us directly
affected who would not prefer to give those men a
certain handicap in order to be behind winning
teamss.
Supporters of the theory that the athlete can keep
up in his studies while engaged in a major sport point
gleefully to examples of the proper co-ordination of
the two. Let us point out the fact that the captain
of last fall's football team has just returned from the
hospital and that his presence there may be attributed
indirectly to the strain placed upon him last quarter
necessary in avoiding inglorious departure with so
many of his teammates.
It may be the fault of the American attitude to
ward athletics and their method in conducting them
—but while that condition exists, let us take it into
consideration.

Now, rather than final examination week, is the
time to check up on our athletes and try to learn
whether the beginning - of the spring quarter is going
to throw Stanford into the dejection precipitated
last month by the announcement that fourteen ath
letes had been taken to the edge of the campus and
dropped off.
It is significant that the great majority of athletes
whom we lose Hunk out or get behind in counts dur
ing the quarter in which they take part in a major
sport. Well-meaning faculty members have pointed
out that being a good athlete and a good student
are not inconsistent. They have asked us to look
to England, where there seems to be no difficulty in
correlating scholarship and sports. But they forget
the intensity which is an inevitable part of the
average American's makeup.
The administration's jxDlicy of building stadiums
and hiring coaches seems to indtcate that they wish
to build up winning teams. But out of what?
Perhaps it is no more reasonable to ask that the
professor make special dispensation for the athlete
than it is to insist that the coach place a man on his
team merely because he has made Phi Beta Kappa.
But, then, how many Phi Beta Kappa's spend any
time on the athletic fields? With the training, prac
tice and concentration which the American system
places upon a sport, the potential "graduated with
distinction" would become "disqualified for further
registration."
This is admittedly a plea for special consideration
this quarter only for those men who have been spend
ing night and day hours on the court —and it is a
plea that will perhaps fall upon unheeding ears. It
will merely be considered the illogical pattering of
an immature mind which has overlooked the real
purpose of a college education. But, while the ad
ministration admits by its every action that the de
velopment of athletics is a real part of its program,
it does not force those of us who are not members
of teams to maintain any standards of athletic
ability.
Such discrimination is unfair to the rest of the
students, it is argued. There are few of us directly
affected who would not prefer to give those men a
certain handicap in order to be behind winning
teamss.
Supporters of the theory that the athlete can keep
up in his studies while engaged in a major sport point
gleefully to examples of the proper co-ordination of
the two. Let us point out the fact that the captain
of last fall's football team has just returned from the
hospital and that his presence there may be attributed
indirectly to the strain placed upon him last quarter
necessary in avoiding inglorious departure with so
many of his teammates.
It may be the fault of the American attitude to
ward athletics and their method in conducting them
—but while that condition exists, let us take it into
consideration.
