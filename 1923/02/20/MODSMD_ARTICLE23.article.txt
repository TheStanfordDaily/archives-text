When you're getting a salary of twenty a week,
And you're tired as Hell at night,
And you look at the world with your tongue in your
cheek,
Cause it isn't looking right,
You don't give a darn whether school keeps or not,
But you're too tired to fight,
And the weather's too cold, or else it's too hot,
—That's boredom.
When you haven't a salary, but clip off coupons,
Which buy you each desire,
And th« biggest worry is "Now, what's on,"
To keep us from playing with fire,"
And you don't give a darn whether school keeps or not,
There's nothing you rightly admire;
The weather's too cold, or else it's too hot,
—That's ennui!
—Alict B. G., '23.
* * *
Now, Alice, watch your step on thes« highbrow con
tributions. The point to the above is just a trifle
obscure!

First Devil: New candidate, Sir. California rooter,
he says. We owe him a lot for his work on earth. What
shall we give him as a reward?
The Boss Devil: Give him Hell.

Cabbages hates to remark on a rival publication—"one
of our obnoxious contemporaries," as Judge says—but
perhaps the organ of the college across the bay now
feels not so proud of the statement which appeared in
the sheet of Thursday last, which said that the "B. and
G. captain will tonight lead his team to victory on the
Stanford court." —C. D., '24.

No. 1: Pa still bootlegging?
No. 2: No, he quit that.
No. 2: What's he doing?
No. 2: Five years.
* * *
Waiter, have you corn on the ear?
Nossir, that's a wart!
Use Idaho in a sentence.
Idaho lot rather answer some other question.

Idaho lot rather have something else to thing about
than the fact that it is one month till finals, too, P. K. R.

A Wit and a Dullard once met on a narrow Bridge
over a swift and dark Stream. Meeting in the middle,
each stared at each other for a moment. The Wit was
sure that his Line would get him safely by, and he
commenced with it upon the other, trying to make him
return to the Bank. The Dullard only stared, and then
pushed the other over into the stream.
"Now if you'll throw me part of your Line," called
the Dullard from the Bank, "I'll pull you out." But the
Wit flowed on downward with the deep and dark
Stream.

Cabbages hates to remark on a rival publication—"one

the sheet of Thursday last, which said that the "B. and
G. captain will tonight lead his team to victory on the
Stanford court." —C. D., '24.

A Wit and a Dullard once met on a narrow Bridge
over a swift and dark Stream. Meeting in the middle,
each stared at each other for a moment. The Wit was
sure that his Line would get him safely by, and he
commenced with it upon the other, trying to make him
return to the Bank. The Dullard only stared, and then
pushed the other over into the stream.
"Now if you'll throw me part of your Line," called
the Dullard from the Bank, "I'll pull you out." But the
Wit flowed on downward with the deep and dark
Stream.

When you're getting a salary of twenty a week,
And you're tired as Hell at night,
And you look at the world with your tongue in your
cheek,
Cause it isn't looking right,
You don't give a darn whether school keeps or not,
But you're too tired to fight,
And the weather's too cold, or else it's too hot,
—That's boredom.
When you haven't a salary, but clip off coupons,
Which buy you each desire,
And th« biggest worry is "Now, what's on,"
To keep us from playing with fire,"
And you don't give a darn whether school keeps or not,
There's nothing you rightly admire;
The weather's too cold, or else it's too hot,
—That's ennui!
