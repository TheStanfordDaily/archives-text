THE STANFORD SPARKLE
The joke is pn a lot of the students and faculty mem
bers on the Stanford campus and they are smiling today
at their simplicity in "jumping to conclusions" and
reading what they know wasn't in announcements of a
San Francisco newspaper regarding "the Stanford Spar
kle," a new dance "invented by a girl student to supplant
th« wicked 'Chicago'." This new dance, it was an
nounced, would be explained and illustrated in the
Sunday issue of the paper.
There was a very considerable interest in the identity
of the girl student who had devised this new dance. The
Sunday paper had it all. The "Stanford Sparkle," it
was disclosed, was introduced a few nights ago at a
San Francisco hotel by "its inventor, Miss Dorothy Wise,
a pretty senior student." She believes, so the stock
says, that it will supplant the "Chicago." The "Chicago,"
the paper says, has been forbidden in public dance halls
—"yet in spite of this prohibition, the college students
still are dancing it." In Berkeley, we are told, they
dance the Chicago in ice cream parlors and tea shops.
"College students don't dance improperly because they
want to be extreme," Miss Wise is quoted as saying:
"It is just because the dance is new and they are fond
of dancing."
But who the heck is this Miss Wise. Never heard of
her at Stanford. Senior student, too. Oh, yes! "Miss
Wise is a senior student at St. Brigid's, where she is to
be graduated in June."
Oh, not a senior student at Stanford? Well, why does
she call it the Stanford Sparkle, then? Here it is—•
"and perfected the Sparkle for its introduction at the
ball of Stanford Parlor, Native Sons of the Golden West,
last week." Sure! Now we see!
"Although it gets its nam« from the branch of the
association and not from the University, it is not im
probable that Stanford students will adopt the dance
at their gatherings because of its name, as an offset
to the Chicago, and a defiance to the California students
to produce a dance they can call their own without
having to draw on their own city."
Won't that be exciting! The colleges dancing defiance
at each other in ice cream parlors and tea shops and
simultaneously avoiding the Chicago, which up to now,
in spite of the real lmrmlessness of their intentions, they
have just been forced to dance, because it is new and
they love dancing.— (The Palo Alto Times.)
