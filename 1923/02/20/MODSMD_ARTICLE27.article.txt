# Support Means Success
## 
### 
The Stanford basketball team faced
the California series after having come
through a grilling preliminary season
undefeated. The past two games have
been a terrific nervous and physical
strain on the team which, coupled with
their hard schedule, has certainly had its
effect. Success in this crucial game
Wednesday night at Berkeley means an
early termination of the series with Cali
fornia and a rest of a few more days
before the team will have to go north to
play the winners of the northern section
of the Pacific Coast Conference. That
which is essential to give the boys the
necessary push to put the game over is
the active support of the Stanford stu
dent body. Every real Stanford man
should go to this game. Let's show them
we appreciate what they are doing by
giving our support in every way we can.
We at home can do little more than keep
a good thought in mind for their suc
cess—while the more fortunate of our
number will be trying to lift the roof of
Harmon Gym.
