Mr. Hal Rorke, '24 —
I think Ram's Head cast and chorus
agree with each other. I believe the
Squire agrees with Drusilla, and Gava
dor with Florin and I, in this instance,
agree with Monty—Mr. Rorke, you are
"full of chivalry."
Frankly, your criticism of Knightie
Knight was quite worthy of your most
versatile Corona, and we are glad you
have informed your gullible and en
thusiastic admirers that the result of
our sincere efforts to cheer you up,
Mr. Rorke, and to entertain those less
cynical, were not deserving of the
plaudits of a Julian Eltinge.
We know what the show was like,
and knew it at the time of presenta
tion, but we were consoled in the
thought that there were about 1800
people watching us who were bigger
fools because they paid $1.40 to see
us.
After spending six hours a day, and
pulling straight "D's" during three
weeks of rehearsals, we all read with
pleasure your hearty commendations.
In behalf of th« cast and chorus of
"Knightie Knight," I offer you our
most grateful thanks.
My only alibi is that that dammed
ballet skirt always has been a jinx!
—Patty Ann.
