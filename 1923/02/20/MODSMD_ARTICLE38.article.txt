is turning to this style more and" more,
and automobile dealers predict that it
will take the place of the open car as
the average family's "necessity."

and designs also take up a good por- ]
tion of the floor space. A large number
of truck exhibits are also included.
These are located in the basement, the
whole floor being devoted to passenger
cars. On the second floor there is an

"California" tops bears out the present
trends of motor car buying.
