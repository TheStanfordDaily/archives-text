## AUTOMOBILE SECTION San Francisco's Auto Show Will Remain Open Until Saturday Night 
### EDITED BY JACK GRAVES 
The seventh annual Pacific Automo- i
bile Show opened in the San Francisco
exposition auditorium last Saturday
afternoon, to run for one week. At
tendance to date has set a record for
automobile shows west of Chicago.
The predominance of closed models
is especially worthy of note. The public
is turning to this style more and" more,
and automobile dealers predict that it
will take the place of the open car as
the average family's "necessity."
Snappy sport cars in glaring colors
and designs also take up a good por- ]
tion of the floor space. A large number
of truck exhibits are also included.
These are located in the basement, the
whole floor being devoted to passenger
cars. On the second floor there is an
array of accessory and kindred ex
hibits. A big display of special or
"California" tops bears out the present
trends of motor car buying.
