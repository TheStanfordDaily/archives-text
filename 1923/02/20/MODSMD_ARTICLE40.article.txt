# LOVE RUNS SECOND AT OHIO STATE
## 
### 
In comparison to Michigan students,
who in a recent "heart's desire" ques
tionnaire, expressed their chief want
as love, two out of every three of
some 100 Ohio State students, inter
viewed at random on the campus,
make love play second fiddle to "a de
cent Thanksgiving vacation" so that
they might partake of turkey at the
parental fireside. Have they girls back
home?
Like their Michigan brethren, how
ever, they gave high places to friends,
success, and millions. High-priced mo
tor cars of all makes vied with each
other for prominence with some.
Others gave children, dogs, satisfac
tory husbands or wives, and perpetual
youth, about equal prominence.
