.
Five fellowships for graduate work in
the iield of food research for the year
1922-23 are being offered by the Food
Research Institute of Stanford.
The Institute is organized as an in
tegral part of Stanford University, with
the status of a department for the pur
pose of directing research and recom
mending degrees. It was founded in
1921 by the Carnegie Corporation of
New York in conjunction with the Trus
tees of Stanford. The Institute grew
out of a suggestion offered by Mr. Her
bert Hoover, and its location here was
due partly to the fact that this Uni
versity possesses, in the Hoover War
Library, a large and unique collection
of documentary material relating to the
food problems and other economic as
pects of the Great War.
In accordance with a decision of the
directors, most of the research work is
concerned for the present with wheat
and wheat products, and the economic
problems related to these commodities.
Economic developments in Europe, par
ticularly in respect to agriculture and
food consumption, are being followed
with special reference to their bearing
upon the demand for wheat imports.
