# New Head Light to Throw Beam Around Road Curves
## 
### 
An automatic light that will illuminate
the road on rounding curves in advance
of the car has been perfected by two
San Francisco inventors, J. E. Echlin
and E. C. Echlin, and is being manu
factured by them under the trade name
of "Safe-Lite."
The safe-lite is a small headlight
mounted on the radiator spout, and turns
automatically with the steering wheel,
illuminating the turns equally as well as
the straight road. It is legal in every
state.
