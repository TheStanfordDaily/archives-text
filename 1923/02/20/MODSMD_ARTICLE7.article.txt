# Chappie's Original Naughty Joke Hit By Censor's Stamp
## 
### 
Monday was Chaparral's sale day.
Rows upon rows of virgin white Chap
pies lay stacked on the tables in the
Press building, ready, nay, anxious to
be taken to the Quad and sold to eager
students.
But alack! There among the exchange
clippings the wandering eye of the editor
caught at a joke, stared, blinked rapidly,
and clouded with anger. For it was a
Naughty Joke!
And so Chappy did not go £>n sale
Monday, nay, nor yet on Tuesday, either.
And among the exchange clippings the
blighting hand of the Old Boy's rubber
stamp fell with heavy hand, and now
there is naught but a black smear where
once Chappy's Original Naughty Joke
had flaunted.
But rumor has it that there will be a
mad scramble Wednesday for copies
where the censor's hand fell lightly, and
perchance the Naughty Joke shows
through.
