# TOUTS FEATURED BY CLOSE MATCHES AND BOXING BOUTS
## Woodhead Is Only Wrestler to Secure Fall; Bugge Is First In Fencing With Four Wins 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
"It will be harder to pick the box
ing and wrestling teams now than it
was before the tryouts," said Coach
Harry Maloney after the final bout last
night in Encina gymnasium. This sen
tence describes almost every boxing
bout and wrestling match, because the
judges were unable to decide the win
ner of most of them and they had to
be declared draws.
Coach Maloney allowed but one bout
to go more than the three rounds, be
cause he feared that the men who were
fighting so evenly were not in good
enough condition to put up a good
fight in the extra round. Most of the
wrestling matches went the full six
minutes allowed without either man
securing a fall. The match between
Woodhead and Jenkins in the 158-
pound class was the only exception.
Woodhead won this easily in 2:30 with
a head scissors.
Teams Unpicked
The men to gain places on the teams
were not decided upon last night be
cause of the closeness of the matches.
However, Maloney will announce the
boxing team and Hosepian will an
nounce the wrestling team sometime
this week. The fencing team wlil prob
ably be announced the latter part of
the week also.
The first boxing bout of the evening
was between Hard and Bell, both 115-
pounders. Hard started things out with
a rush and had the upper hand all the
way through the bout, although Bell
landed several good blows. Hard was
given the decision. The other 115-
pound bout between McAllister and
Cannon was hotly contested and went
a fourth round before the winner was
decided, McAllister then being given
the decision. The first three rounds
were even with both men landing fre
quent blows. They started out fast but
the bout slowed down a little as they
became groggier. McAllister was in
the best condition for the extra round
and landed enough blows to the head
to win for him.
Armbruster Wins
Armbruster, a 125-pound fighter, was
given the decision over Tyroler. who is
a welterweight. The first round was
slow with Tyroler pushing Armbrus
ter into the ropes a number of times.
Armbruster got in a blow below the
belt in the next round and was knock
ing Tyroler all over the mat when
Maloney stopped the bout to give him
a rest. He couldn't come back enough
to stop Armbruster, who was driving
him to the floor, when the bout was
stopped.
Penepacker and Adams put on one
of the best bouts of the evening. These
fighters were evenly matched and both
fought on the offensive. No decision
was given in this bout. Irwin and Stod
dard, middleweights, also fought to a
draw. All three rounds were even with
Irwin landing the greater number of
punches.
No Decision for Heavies
Van Hook and McKee, in the light
heavyweight class, staged another
close bout. The fight was slowed up
considerably by a great number of
clinches but on the whole it was very
good. Van Hook landed a few wallops
and followed with a few
through Van Hook's guard, and then
this process was repeated. No decision
was given. Gifford and Robinson in the
\ VVIIUHUI.U J 4/
i heavyweight class put on a free-for-all
slugging contest, and both men were
covered with blood at the end of the
third round. No decision was given.
In the 125-pound wrestling Meyers
won a decision from Pallete after their
match had gone the time limit. Both
of the 145-pound matches went the
time limit without a fall being secured.
Dobson won from Quinn in the first
one and Sievers won from Clendinin
in the second. In the 175-pound class
Nicholson and Whitney grappled to
draw, each man being 011 the offensive
an equal amount of time.
The next meet will be March 2 when
Davis farm meets Stanford in a re
turn boxing and wrestling tourney in
the gymnasium here.
