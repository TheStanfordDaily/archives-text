"War is no means for civilized people
to use in settling their difficulties. This
is the big lesson I learned from my
; work in the famine districts of Russian,"
: said Myrle Robin Lampson, '22, in dis
| cussing the present conditions of that
j country and relating his experiences as
! a relief worker for the Society of
j Friends, in the Little Theater last'night.
"Seven armies had pased through the
j territory where 1 was stationed," said
i Lampson, "and all of tehm took horses,
cattle, and food away from the peasants.
They cut down the telegraph and tele
phone wires and completely devastated
the country.
"Today there are between seven and
eight million peopel who are unable to
take care of themselves. The harvest
for winter will be enough to sustain 50
per cent of the people, but the relief
workers will have to help the other half
of the population.
"During the fall of 1921 there were
districts where no rain fell, and the
drouth caused the famine. The terri
tory was absolutely devoid of food. Peo
pel in the cities sat, in their homes anc
waited for relief or death. The peasants
, sold everything they could part with.
Their homes were almost without furni
i ture or linens. There were no cattle of
any sort with which to do the farming."
i Mr. Lampson expalined how the
Quakers carried on their relief service.
| Sections of the country, Lampson said,
were divided into eighteen districts, each
of which had a committee to help with
the work. The Society of Friends de
pended on these committees for the list
|of people's names that needed their aid
'and for estimates of food. There were
'so many illiterate people among the
Russians that it was often a difficult
'matter to find two or three who could
i write and do the bookkeeping. Few
schools had been established in this coun
try, and only about five or six per cent
of the people were ducated.
Long lists of names of people who
needed help were sent into the Quakers.
A certain per cent of these people were
fed ,and the relief workrs had to turn
a deaf ear to all other requests, because
there was only so much food in the ware
house. Eighteen per cent of the Russians
died before aid could reach them.
"The Russian people were very grate
ful," continued Lampson. "Govern
ment officials, priests, and others who
could write sent us letters of apprecia
tion. The government did all it could
to help its citizens. Carloads of grain
were sent into the famine-stricken dis
tricts.
"On my arrival in Russia I passed
through Moscow. The city was in a
destitute condition. Boulevards were
and there was nothing +hit
could be called a sidewalk. On retim
ing to America, I again passed through
Moscow, and this time I hardly recog
nized the place. The streets were paved,
there were thirty-three street car Knrs
and many new automobiles, most of
which were Fords. Wrecked and ruined
buildings were being repaired; new
houses were being built. And so I am
very hopeful for Russia. T have not
drawn a happy picture of this country,
but it is a hopeful one."
