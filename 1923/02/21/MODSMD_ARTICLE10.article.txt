"War is no means for civilized people
to use in settling their difficulties. This
is the big lesson I learned from my
; work in the famine districts of Russian,"
: said Myrle Robin Lampson, '22, in dis
| cussing the present conditions of that
j country and relating his experiences as
! a relief worker for the Society of
j Friends, in the Little Theater last'night.
"Seven armies had pased through the

i ture or linens. There were no cattle of
any sort with which to do the farming."

were divided into eighteen districts, each
of which had a committee to help with
the work. The Society of Friends de

'and for estimates of food. There were

Russians that it was often a difficult
'matter to find two or three who could

schools had been established in this coun
try, and only about five or six per cent
