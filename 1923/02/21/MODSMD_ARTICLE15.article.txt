# CARDINAL FIVE 10 MEET BRUIN QUINTET TONIGHT
## Stanford Team Will Be Champion of Southern Division By Taking One of Next Two Contests 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
It's make or break for the California
basketball varsity when the Card and
Bear fives meet for the third game of
the series in Harmon Gymnasium to
night. Coach Wight's team must win
both of the remaining games to even
tie with the Cardinal quintet for the
honor of representing the southern
schools in the struggle for the Pacific
Coast Conference title. Should the
Stanford varsity win either game, the
Bruins will be eliminated.
It is a difficult proposition to give
the edge to either team in tonight's
battle. California will be playing on a
familiar court with the knowledge that
one more defeat will end their chances
for the Coast title. Stanford will be
handicapped some by playing on a
strange court, but knowing what a win
tonight will mean should put a world
of fight into Kerr's team.
As for early season scores, they seem
to mean absolutely nothing in the
present series. Both teams won easily
from Nevada, St. Mary's, and Santa
Clara and comparative scores seemed

to indicate that California was the
stronger team. Right here is where
the upsets began. The Cards downed
the Olympic Club tive and the Winged
"O" team hung a defeat on the Bears.
Then Stanford made a clean sweep of
the four-game series with the Univer
sity of Southern California and the
Bruins won two out of four from the
southern team.
That clearly gave Stanford the edge;
and then that heart breaking 2G-23 de
feat at Berkeley last Wednesday, that
turned the odds in favor of the Blue
and Gold! With the Cardinals' 18-17
victory in the second game, no one
knows who is on the long end of the
odds, and nobody seems to care.
It is doubtful that the score tonight
will be as close as it was in the last
game but it is certain that both teams
will be fighting just as hard.
Andy Kerr has not been working his
team very hard this week. Light work
outs last night and Monday seems to
have put new life into the over-worked
Cards. In a long, hard preliminary sea
son such as the Stanford Varsity ha*
gone through, it is very easy for a
team to go state and that is what Kerr
is guarding against. Coach Wight is
undoubtedly doing the same thing this
week.
With Oliva's return from the hos
pital yesterday afternoon, all the first,
string men are in good shape. The big
guard seems to be feeling fine and he
was having no trouble sinking those
long ones from the center of the floor.
He caged one of thees in the last game
and may be counted on to repeat to
night. One basket may be the deciding
factor. Fred Anderson's smashed finger
doesn't seem to be bothering him much
and he should give Johnnie Talt all the>
entertainment he can take care of.
"Lefty" and "Nip" have been find
ing the basket regularly for the past
two nights and if both of those boys
have their eyes on the hoop, Kincaid,
LeHane, Belasco, Thompson, et al,
should have their hands full.
Bob Janssen took a rest Monday
night and came back strong last night,
sinking them from all angles. He and
Steele will both probably see action
tonight.
If the Cardinal defense can hold
O'Neill, Houvenin, and Talt. down and
give Talt less chances at. free throws,
Stanford should come out on top.
The 310 tickets alloted to the Stan
ford rooting section were sold in less
than an hour yesterday and no tickets
were available on the Berkeley cam
pus after 2:30. So it is certain that
about 2500 basketball fans should be
treated to a rare battle in Harmon
Gymnasium tonight.

guard seems to be feeling fine and he
was having no trouble sinking those
long ones from the center of the floor.
He caged one of thees in the last game
and may be counted on to repeat to
night. One basket may be the deciding
factor. Fred Anderson's smashed finger
doesn't seem to be bothering him much
and he should give Johnnie Talt all the>
entertainment he can take care of.
"Lefty" and "Nip" have been find
ing the basket regularly for the past
two nights and if both of those boys
have their eyes on the hoop, Kincaid,
LeHane, Belasco, Thompson, et al,
should have their hands full.
Bob Janssen took a rest Monday
night and came back strong last night,
sinking them from all angles. He and
Steele will both probably see action
tonight.
If the Cardinal defense can hold
O'Neill, Houvenin, and Talt. down and
give Talt less chances at. free throws,
Stanford should come out on top.
The 310 tickets alloted to the Stan
ford rooting section were sold in less
than an hour yesterday and no tickets
were available on the Berkeley cam
pus after 2:30. So it is certain that
about 2500 basketball fans should be
treated to a rare battle in Harmon
Gymnasium tonight.
It's make or break for the California
basketball varsity when the Card and
Bear fives meet for the third game of
the series in Harmon Gymnasium to
night. Coach Wight's team must win
both of the remaining games to even
tie with the Cardinal quintet for the
honor of representing the southern
schools in the struggle for the Pacific
Coast Conference title. Should the
Stanford varsity win either game, the
Bruins will be eliminated.
It is a difficult proposition to give
the edge to either team in tonight's
battle. California will be playing on a
familiar court with the knowledge that
one more defeat will end their chances
for the Coast title. Stanford will be
handicapped some by playing on a
strange court, but knowing what a win
tonight will mean should put a world
of fight into Kerr's team.
As for early season scores, they seem
to mean absolutely nothing in the
present series. Both teams won easily
from Nevada, St. Mary's, and Santa
Clara and comparative scores seemed

to indicate that California was the
stronger team. Right here is where
the upsets began. The Cards downed
the Olympic Club tive and the Winged
"O" team hung a defeat on the Bears.
Then Stanford made a clean sweep of
the four-game series with the Univer
sity of Southern California and the
Bruins won two out of four from the
southern team.
That clearly gave Stanford the edge;
and then that heart breaking 2G-23 de
feat at Berkeley last Wednesday, that
turned the odds in favor of the Blue
and Gold! With the Cardinals' 18-17
victory in the second game, no one
knows who is on the long end of the
odds, and nobody seems to care.
It is doubtful that the score tonight
will be as close as it was in the last
game but it is certain that both teams
will be fighting just as hard.
Andy Kerr has not been working his
team very hard this week. Light work
outs last night and Monday seems to
have put new life into the over-worked
Cards. In a long, hard preliminary sea
son such as the Stanford Varsity ha*
gone through, it is very easy for a
team to go state and that is what Kerr
is guarding against. Coach Wight is
undoubtedly doing the same thing this
week.
With Oliva's return from the hos
pital yesterday afternoon, all the first,
string men are in good shape. The big
guard seems to be feeling fine and he
was having no trouble sinking those
long ones from the center of the floor.
