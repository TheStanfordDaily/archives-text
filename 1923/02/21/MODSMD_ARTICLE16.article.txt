# 1924 AND 1925 TIE BLOOMER HOOP TILT
## 
### 
The women's junior and sophomore
sextets broke even, 15-15, in the second
game of the interclass series yesterday
afternoon.
At half-time the sophomores had the
lead, 13 to 10. Marie Hull, junior for
ward in the last half, caged four shots
that pushed the junior score one point
ahead of the sophomores. Mabel Me-
Canse passed the ball through the hoop
from the foul-line, and the junior
claimed 15 tallies. Then the sophomore
centers rallied, rushed the ball down to
their forward, Doris Harter, who made
a basket and evened the scorc.
Eunice Biddle, Alice Roth, and Kath
leen Evans, junior centers, were largely
responsible for the success of the junior
court six during the last half. The fast
teamwork of these three players kept
the ball in the juniors' territory and also
blocked the sophomores' efforts to pass
the ball to their forwards.
The junior guards, Violet Knowles and
Josephine Franklin, put up a good tight
to keep the sophomore forwards from
scoring and in the last half allowed them
to make only one basket from the field.
Grace Judd made the best record at
forward position. She caged ten of the
sophomores' 15 points.
