Article of War." Wherewith the plea
of guilty to violation of the Sixty-first
Article of War was accepted and the
prisoner was sentenced to fifty-seven

five days' pay.
In other words, James Muir, who
was the victim of a mock court-martial
held by the students of the class in

of the charge of desertion, and plead
guilty to being A. W. O. L.
W. R. Wilson presided over the
court, J. P. Price was the defense

brought out by the prosecution re

sweetheart in Philadelphia.
