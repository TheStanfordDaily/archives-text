# DOWN WITH DANCES!

And now they are frowning and shaking their
heads in distress because there are too many dances
during the week on the campus. Something must
be done alxnit it!
Perhaps we don't spend every minute of our time
on the campus in study or in worrying about under
graduate problems. That is one of the reasons that
we hear so much talk about college days being the
"happiest days in life.'' A few minutes of irresponsi
bility every day won't do anyone any harm as long
as we remain fairly intelligent beings, and we shall
enjoy ourselves much more.
Those students aiming at Phi Beta Kappa will
not be greatly perturbed by any dances given on the
campus. There is, as yet, no regulation compelling
attendance.
And as for the cry thai the ballroom is replac" g
the gymnasium, there are two answers. First, danc
ing is a harmless exercise—and has even been said
to have a certain value. Second, the men with real
ability in athletic lines are out on the fields and are
•interested enough in their sport to govern their
activities accordingly.
Of course, there are those who carry the pastime
to extremes, but that is the sort who will find some
kind of diversion whatever rulings may be passed.
And there are worse evils than dancing.
There are those who enjoy dancing, strange as it
may seem, and if there is any action city parties will
become more frequent.
These frowning ones would live a life of misery
indeed if they were to attend almost any other uni
versity, where dancing is not limited to hours of
■darkness, but furnishes entertainment while break
fast is being served as well.
While we're about it, let's compel the civic au
thorities of Palo Alto to exclude students from the
movies during the week.
