The recent strategy on the part of the Kampus Kar
Line magnates in stationing extra conductors upon their
perambulating pagodas to foil the exploits of thrifty
roughs has been checkmated by the Surgical Union,
Disston Post. The saw-bones obtained an injunction
alleging restraint of trade, and contended that the
Stanford man has a perfect right to break any number
of legs he chooses. The traction authorities instantly
gave over the point, and even painted the protruding
splinters with lock-jaw germs as an evidence of good
faith.
* * *
The S. P. made lots of money off the bird who came
up to San Francisco every time he took a chew of
tobacco. He said Los Angeles wasn't worth spitting on.
* * *
Another hombre made the same trip whenever he had
a cold in his head. He said L. A. was nothing to be
sneezed at.
* * *
Did you ever see a conductor do any conducting?
No, be deducts.
Have you ever observed a ball in a high-ball?
No, but it packs a mean bat.
Are there any Congress gaiters in Congress?
No, only freebooters and bootleggers.
Then is there ever any milk on the milk-train?
No, only the cream of the University.
* * *
Should a bond salesman's brief case be called a market
basket? Or a lawyer's—a suit-case?
* * *
It's tough for the man who hangs his hat
Near the tracks of the traction line;
For never a wink can he hope to blink
Or in sleep through the night recline.
Ah, the dear old bed brings no slumber at all
It's a place where we toss and swear—
Rectangular wheels issue clangorous peals
For the company's "on the square."
♦ * *
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any pulmonary trouble?
DOCTORED: Well, once I fell out of an upper berth.
* * *
Among things that are is the student car
Which invites both flunk-outs and booze —
And if plenty of talk could make us walk,
We'd be terribly hard on our shoes.
♦ * *
Tomorrow's the birthday of Washington,
The first one to give 'em the axe—
That old patriot was right on the spot
Anil so is the income tax.
* * *
Washington always let George do it.
—WAMBA.

The S. P. made lots of money off the bird who came

Did you ever see a conductor do any conducting?
No, be deducts.
Have you ever observed a ball in a high-ball?
No, but it packs a mean bat.
Are there any Congress gaiters in Congress?
No, only freebooters and bootleggers.
Then is there ever any milk on the milk-train?

It's tough for the man who hangs his hat
Near the tracks of the traction line;
For never a wink can he hope to blink
Or in sleep through the night recline.

The first one to give 'em the axe—

perambulating pagodas to foil the exploits of thrifty
roughs has been checkmated by the Surgical Union,

alleging restraint of trade, and contended that the
Stanford man has a perfect right to break any number
of legs he chooses. The traction authorities instantly
gave over the point, and even painted the protruding
splinters with lock-jaw germs as an evidence of good
faith.
