Some years ago an individual with a knack for terse
phrases said, "College bred is a four-year loaf," and his
expression has been a Godsend to the army of scoffers
that is ever ready to scratch at something with their
poisonous finger-nails. But is it? The college man of
today has hardly the spare time of the laboring man,
but more nearly approaches the example of his elder
brother, who is a captain of finance and devotes prac
tically his whole time to it.
The five-o'clock whistle for the undergraduate means
that he can leave compulsory physical training, eat a
necessary meal, and do some necessary study for his
compulsory classes the next day, while the day laborer
or the business man who is not of executive caliber can
beat his wife until the next working day with no thought
of bread-winning.
The sum and substance of the matter is that the
college man, in most cases, receives his crust (or bottle)
of rye from another source, and that is sufficient grounds
in some mentalities for the assumption that he is a
lily-fingered aristocrat who shudders at the reminiscent
odor of garlic on a motorman's mustache.
The basis, then, for the semi-contemptuous idea of the
college man which is still found in not so remote quar
ters, is that he is not self-supporting, and no considera
tion is taken of the fact that he is doiwg, without imme
diate payment, a volume of work which would easily
avert the pangs of starvation if diverted into a channel
which bore mature fruit in the present instead of super
confections in the future.
Two man-sized jobs represent two men —why expect
one man to handle them, especially when the man is in
the formative period? There are instances in plenty of
one man carrying these two jobs, supporting himself
and studying—there are other instances of men not even
doing one justifiably. Hence, if the first type does not
bring toleration, why should the second be allowed to
cause adverse comment? There are thousands of men
between the two extremes, and their achievements
amply justify the system.—W. L. W.
