Dear Patty Ann Murphy:
So your play was another of those
"people be damned" propositions. Well
old dear, if you depend upon the same
audience for support uext time, and if
I am to understand that to be the at
titude you and the society assume,
tlhire will be two less at your show,
unless someone else escorts my lady.
For in all of my career I have at
tempted to avoid the part of the fool.
In fact, if we are to hit our "hard
worked dad" for shekels to see a play,
we do not wish to be givÂ«n the im
pression that we were never even con
sidered; otherwise take your art to
those more foolish than College men
and women who will stand for such.
And as a bit of professional advice, if
you do put something over on some
one, why add insult to injury?
Selwyn J. Sternberg, '24.
