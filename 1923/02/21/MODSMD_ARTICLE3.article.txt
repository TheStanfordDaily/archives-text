# Six-Bit Dance Slated For Next Saturday in The Women's Clubhouse
## 
### 
For the first time in several years, a
dance will be given in the Women's
Clubhouse next Saturday at a price un
der a dollar. About three years ago
the "six-bit" dance died a painless death
with the introduction of the seventy-five
cent jolly-up. Those in charge of cam
pus dances rightly thought that if it was
worth three-quarters of a dollar to bring
one person, it was worth a quarter more
to bring your own partner.
But due to the fact that the movie
show next Saturday is a completely un
tried experiment, members of the Ex
ecutive Committee decided to also in
vestigate the possibilities of making a
less expensive dance a success, in spite
of the high cost of music.
