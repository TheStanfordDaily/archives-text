# The 						Aisle Seat
## PANCHO IS NOT POLISHED BUT HE'S A GENTLEMAN 
### 
Prospective college graduates in
search of a profession should take a
look at "The Bad Man" at the Alcazar
Theater. If Porter Emerson Brown,
who wrote it, and Holbrook Blinn, who
does most of the acting in it, are any
where near right, then this Mexican
bandit business offers exceptional op
portunities—a larg-e income assured
with no government tax.
Pancho Lopez, who is in reality Hol
brook Blinn, ex-'94, is a gentleman at
heart, despite the fact that he is the
I cut-up of the border country. With
much damn-ing, some hell-ing, and a
great amount of broken English, Pan
[ cho puts in an exciting day at the Gil
bert ranch on the American side of
the line.
After he has finished, the angle is
taken out of the inevitable triangle,
the loan-shark villryun, with high, black
Stetson and coat to match, is foiled
—and all the deserving people presum
ably live happily ever after.
The bandit is late in arriving and
doesn't put in an appearance until the
close of the first act. He is worth wait
ing for, since Blinn dominates the last
two acts completely. Imperturbable, jo
vial, but determined, Pancho proceeds
to fix things to his liking —all because
the owner of the ranch is an old friend
of his.
While the audience is waiting for
Pancho, Charles Sheldon, who plays
Henry Smith, a hothouse flower trans
planted from the cold of Bangor, Me.,
to the sweltering heat of the border,
does a half dozen laps around the
stage in his wheel chair. He takes all
the corners carefully and has no punc
tures. When he isn't busy with his
vehicle Sheldon yells "gol-dern fool"
repeatedly in a voice loud enough for
everyone to hear —because the ranch

venture Is apparently a failure. But
that is before the good Pancho arrives
on the scene
Porter Emerson Browne, who lived in
Arizona for many years, has produced
a notable play in "The Bad Man."
notable if only for th\j fact that he
hasn't a single carramba! or sacra
mento! in all three acts. His three
Mexican aides, Pedro, Venustiano, and
Alverado correspond roughly to our
Lasuen, Salvatierra, and Alvarado.
Blinn s performance, according to
the critics, is ART spelled with capital
| letters. Certainly, Blinn does well
enough with the English-Mexican, con
sidering the fact that when he was at
Stanford he got a very, very low grade
in Spanish.

After he has finished, the angle is
taken out of the inevitable triangle,
the loan-shark villryun, with high, black
Stetson and coat to match, is foiled
—and all the deserving people presum
ably live happily ever after.
The bandit is late in arriving and
doesn't put in an appearance until the
close of the first act. He is worth wait
ing for, since Blinn dominates the last
two acts completely. Imperturbable, jo
vial, but determined, Pancho proceeds
to fix things to his liking —all because
the owner of the ranch is an old friend
of his.
While the audience is waiting for
Pancho, Charles Sheldon, who plays
Henry Smith, a hothouse flower trans
planted from the cold of Bangor, Me.,
to the sweltering heat of the border,
does a half dozen laps around the
stage in his wheel chair. He takes all
the corners carefully and has no punc
tures. When he isn't busy with his
vehicle Sheldon yells "gol-dern fool"
repeatedly in a voice loud enough for
everyone to hear —because the ranch

venture Is apparently a failure. But
that is before the good Pancho arrives
on the scene
Porter Emerson Browne, who lived in
Arizona for many years, has produced
a notable play in "The Bad Man."
notable if only for th\j fact that he
hasn't a single carramba! or sacra
mento! in all three acts. His three
Mexican aides, Pedro, Venustiano, and
Alverado correspond roughly to our
Lasuen, Salvatierra, and Alvarado.
Blinn s performance, according to
the critics, is ART spelled with capital
| letters. Certainly, Blinn does well
enough with the English-Mexican, con
sidering the fact that when he was at
Stanford he got a very, very low grade
in Spanish.
Prospective college graduates in
search of a profession should take a
look at "The Bad Man" at the Alcazar
Theater. If Porter Emerson Brown,
who wrote it, and Holbrook Blinn, who
does most of the acting in it, are any
where near right, then this Mexican
bandit business offers exceptional op
portunities—a larg-e income assured
with no government tax.
Pancho Lopez, who is in reality Hol
brook Blinn, ex-'94, is a gentleman at
heart, despite the fact that he is the
I cut-up of the border country. With
much damn-ing, some hell-ing, and a
great amount of broken English, Pan
[ cho puts in an exciting day at the Gil
bert ranch on the American side of
the line.
