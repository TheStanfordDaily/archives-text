# BETA AND DELTA TAU GAME PRECEDES VARSITY FRIDAY
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi won the basketball
championship in League B last night
by defeating Sigma Chi by the one
sided score of 29-13 in a fast but
rough contest. The final game for the
University intramural championship'
will be played Friday night in a pre-,
liminary game to the Stanford-Cali-,
t'ornia varsity contest between Delta '
Tau Delta, the winners in League A, j
and Beta Theta Pi.
The Beta Theta Pi players showed
an offensive strength from the first of
the game and they never let up until
the final whistle when they had piled i
up a total of twenty-nine points. Con- !
trary to their usual style, the Beta j
Theta Pi players stepped into the lead
in the first few minutes of play and at
the half had garnered thirteen points
to nine for Sigma Chi. The Sigma Chi
men were unable to put up a stiff j
enough defense to stop their oppon-1

ents' attack. Their teamwork, too, was
inaccurate and several times poor
passes were intercepted by the Beta
Theta Pi forwards and carried down
to the basket for a goal. Alabaster led
in the scoring for Beta Theta Pi with
four field goals and five free throws.
Granger and Tibbe shot three double
counters each.
The teamwork of the Beta Theta Pi
forward line was exceptionally clever
and fast short passes enabled the play
ers to get the ball down to the basket
and shoot the goal. All of the Beta
Theta Pi players had their eyes on the
hoop and the ball seemed to go
through at every shot, few close ones
being missed. Sigma Chi, however, had
more trouble in finding the rim and
Shaw was the only one to hit it from
all angles, three goals going to his
credit.
