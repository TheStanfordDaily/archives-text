# Heads or Tails May Win Basketball Championship
## 
### 
The little game of odd or even may
have a lot to do with the Southern Con
ference basketball championship should
the present four-game series turn out to
be a tie. If a fifth game is made neces
sary, the two teams will match the pen
nies to see whether it shal lbe played at
Berkeley or Stanford. No neutral Hoor
can be obtained, so the lucky team in the
game of chance will have the advantage
in the game of reality by being on its
own floor with a preponderance of root
ers. Contrary to current rumors, this
more or less mythical fifth contest will
be played next week instead of Saturday.
