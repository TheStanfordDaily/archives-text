Stanford has had a flock of good
sprinters in the past few years and
maybe she will have another one this
year if Marsh Hale keeps moving.

"Nip" McHose has been the high
point man for the Cards in both the
California games. He only got one field
basket in the second game but those
eight free ones he sunk did a lot to
offset Johnnie Talt's scores.

The Stanford Water Polo team's
prospects for a successful outcome of
their Chicago trip were given a boost
last Thursday when the freshmen beat
the Neptune Club of San Francisco by
an 18-1 score. The California varsity
had previously won from this same
team by only ten points and, inasmuch
as the Bears also consider themselves
likely contenders for the national'
championship, the comparative scores
seem to give a decided edge to the
Stanford varsity.

Al Masters showed some fancy
guarding at the goal in the soccer
game with the American Legion outfit
Saturday. Several of his stops drew
applause from the few spectators who
watched the contest. Only once did
the ball get past him and that was on
a miss-kick by one of the Stanford
backs which was quickly converted
into a goal by the watchful Legion
forward.

Quigley, Ta'am, and "Porky"
Dwight were a clever outfit on the
Stanford forward line, passing and
kicking their way to uie American Le
gion goal several times during the con
test. Their ability to keep the ball near
the Legion goal until an opening could
be made was an important factor in
the Cardinal victory.

The Varsity is still rubbing its eyes
after that ninth inning in the Olympic
Club game, and it is rumored that the
Club will take it on the Pantages cir
cuit. At that, two healthy hits in the
final spasm would bother more experi
enced teams than the Winged "O."
The "O" they tried to hand Stanford
in that inning certainly had wings!

"Bill" Richardson, star freshman 880
man, is expected to show his heels to
all his competitors this yvar if he con
tinues running in the form he has dis
played of late. Last Saturday morning
in an informal meet "Bill" broke the
tape ahead of several varsity half
milers in 2 minutes and 2 3-5 seconds.

Steele's improvement at the center
position has been the revelation of the
1922 hoop season on the Farm. His
playing has made it possible for Kerr
to give Bob Janssen a much-needed
rest. Janssen is the better offensive
man of the two, but Steele outshines
him on the defensive.
