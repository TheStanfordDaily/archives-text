# FOUR-LEGGED MONGREL AFTER ALL TRACK RECORDS
## 
### 
Rex, four-legged companion of Delta
Upsilon fraternity, is out after all
track records from the fifty to four- J
forty. Training by chasing Stutzes, |
Packards and accasionally lesser four- j

wheeled fry, Rex was able to set a
record of 9:2 in the hundred last year
when he jogged in ahead of Eddie
Sudden and Morris Kirksey on the
campus oval. Later in the season a
Hudson super-six was defeated by the
D. U. dog. The machine's time was 9:2
for the century.
