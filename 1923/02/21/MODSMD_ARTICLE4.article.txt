# IRELAND INVADES CAMPUS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Faith an' it's "Erin go bragh" on the
Farm tomorrow, even if it is Wash
ington's Birthday, and the spalpeens
inhabiting Stanford baseball uniforms
will have to get up early in the morn
ing or else take a fine large trimming
from Cliff Ireland's Independents, who
will make their thirty-first invasion of
the red, red sod. The real baseballers
flock to Cliff like Airedales to a dog
fight, and Cliff brings all his darlings
to Stanford every year about this time
just to show the college boys that
there are a few angles of the national
pastime which never happened to
strike them before.
Cliff has been playing baseball since
Cleopatras' slave fanned Mark Antony,
and he has had quite a number of days
to pinch-hit for Coue. He played on
the old San Francisco Reliance club,
before the Coast league was ever
thought of, and has been a central
figure in Coast baseball circles ever
since. Last year his line-up of Pacific
Coast leaguers took the Cardinals
down three notches within the space
of three games, and still sent the fans
away so pleased that many of them
thought the home team had won.
Ireland Still Spry
Although Cliff is steadily growing
older, he is pretty spry for his age and
his gray hairs are apt to be contagious
to the other team. He pounded the
Cardinal pitchers fairly consistently
last year, placing the ball neatly at the
feet of a Stanford infiekler, but in a
game with California ten days ago he
astounded himself and the bleachers
by laying out two neat hits. He always
insists that he is "spottnig" the other
team one man, but Cliff Ireland is
Ireland's Independents, and will remain
so even after they push him out to
second base in a wheel chair.
He has plenty of youngsters, though,
who are glad enough to do eight-ninths
of the work in making the Sinn Fein
ers a winning ball club. He carries
eight men who are, or were, toilers
