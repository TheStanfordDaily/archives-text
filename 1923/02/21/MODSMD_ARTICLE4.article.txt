# IRELAND INVADES CAMPUS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Faith an' it's "Erin go bragh" on the
Farm tomorrow, even if it is Wash
ington's Birthday, and the spalpeens
inhabiting Stanford baseball uniforms
will have to get up early in the morn
ing or else take a fine large trimming
from Cliff Ireland's Independents, who
will make their thirty-first invasion of
the red, red sod. The real baseballers
flock to Cliff like Airedales to a dog
fight, and Cliff brings all his darlings
to Stanford every year about this time
just to show the college boys that
there are a few angles of the national
pastime which never happened to
strike them before.
Cliff has been playing baseball since
Cleopatras' slave fanned Mark Antony,
and he has had quite a number of days
to pinch-hit for Coue. He played on
the old San Francisco Reliance club,
before the Coast league was ever
thought of, and has been a central
figure in Coast baseball circles ever
since. Last year his line-up of Pacific
Coast leaguers took the Cardinals
down three notches within the space
of three games, and still sent the fans
away so pleased that many of them
thought the home team had won.
Ireland Still Spry
Although Cliff is steadily growing
older, he is pretty spry for his age and
his gray hairs are apt to be contagious
to the other team. He pounded the
Cardinal pitchers fairly consistently
last year, placing the ball neatly at the
feet of a Stanford infiekler, but in a
game with California ten days ago he
astounded himself and the bleachers
by laying out two neat hits. He always
insists that he is "spottnig" the other
team one man, but Cliff Ireland is
Ireland's Independents, and will remain
so even after they push him out to
second base in a wheel chair.
He has plenty of youngsters, though,
who are glad enough to do eight-ninths
of the work in making the Sinn Fein
ers a winning ball club. He carries
eight men who are, or were, toilers
for the San Francisco Seals, and brings
his traveling strength up to twenty
with ex-Stanford and California stars,
Coast leaguers in general, and a sprink
ling from the Winter leagues and mis
cellaneous diamond experts. All is fish
that comes to his net, provided they
have extraordinary baseball talent, and
his 1923 galaxy is right up to the mark
set in former years.
Ratner May Catch
Ratner, one of the heaviest sluggers
on last year's Varsity, is competing
with Ritchie of Seattle. Anfinson who
has been with the Seals, and Burmeis
ter, for the position behind the plate,
and in consideration of the fact that
he is a Stanford man it is quite pos
sible that Cliff will delegate him to
don the armour tomorrow. Among the
outfielders is Radebaugh, who played
with California in the last series.
George Kelly, who rules second to
little Mr. Ruth in of Swat,
will not be present in person, but his
family will be represented by two
brothers, Ren and Newt. Newt inherits
the family prowess with the bludgeon,
and will be remembered as the man
who bounced a ball over the left field
fence of the Cardinal lot last year. The
funny part of that was that Cliff com
plained because he had told him not to
bunt.
Ellison of the Seals will be found
on first base while his team is in the
field, and his batting record indicates
that the Cards may wake up and find
him almost anywhere if he chances to
get a good cut at the ball.
Manouck to Pitch
Manouck has been in and out of the
Coast league for the last few years,
and will be back on the slab to try to
get the Stanford goat as he did last
year. The Cards are a nice-hitting club,
thoughâ€”wait and see. Stalker and
"Dutch" Rock are the other familiar
names on Cliff's line-up.
Cliff will start passing out his funny
remarks at 2:30 on Thursday, and will

! come back for more Saturday after
noon at three o'clock sharp. Coach
Wolters will send the regular list into
battle, drawing on Clark or Lowen
stein for mound duty and Patterson or
Fuller for the heavy work. All the
omadhauns, leprechauns, pixies, and
fairies in Ireland will be on hand to
see that Cliff gets a square deal.
