# Y.W.C.A. Dress-Up Party Is Given at Clubhouse
## 
### 
Numbers of little girls and boys
romped about the Women's Clubhouse
yesterday evening at the Y. W. C. A.
dress-up party. The Sheik, Count Leo
Tolstoy, a cave-lady, and "Susie" were
present in all their glory, besides clowns,
dancers, Spanish ladies, old maids,
farmers, and various other costumes, for
which no names have ever been invented.
The most generally worn costume was
a "Time to Retire," and which gave
ample freedom for dancing, although its
warmth was hardly adequate to the
weather.
The dance music was funrished by
Margaret Carlsmith, Rose Trautz, and
Muriel Saxon. After the dancing, re
freshments were served downstairs.
