# Spud Pursues Mud-Hen And Occasions Disaster For Lagunita Canoeists
## 
### 
To the two fundamental causes for
upturned canoes in Lagunita has been
added a third —Spud, a dog, as he is
styled. The story is brief and to the
point, or rather, to the water.
Spud was being treated to a canoe
ride about the lake. To his great de
light, he beheld a mud-hen a few
points to the starboard. Forgetting the
| character of his surroundings, Spud
| sprang for the elusive hen.
Did he catch it? It's doubtful, for
Spud, his boat-mates, and the mud-hen
all went under after their own fashion
—for a short time. And another up
turned canoe floated about on the
placid surface of Lagunita.
