# CLIFF IRELAND'S NINE TAKES GAME FROM VARSITY 3-2
## Thirty-First Annual Series Opens With Erratic Play; Ireland Connects for Hit 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Cliff Ireland and his diamond men
turned out to be just one run better
than the Cardinal varsity yesterday af
ternoon, and turned the Stanford base
ballers back with the short end of a
3-2 score. The Cards played an in-and
out game, with plenty of flashes of big
league stuff and just a few too many
gobs of bonehead fielding and base
running. Roy Carver distinguished him
self with two circus catches out in
center field and a neat single which
scored the second Stanford tally.
Second to the perennial Cliff, Gene
Valla and Herb Manouk garnered the
laurels for the Irishmen. Valla justi
fied the praises of San Francisco sport
writers by playing a flawless center
field game and laying out one of the
Irelands' seven hits. Manouk hurled
good ball for five innings, and turned
in the only extra base hit of the game
when he clicked out a screaming triple
between center and left.
Cards Score in First
After holding the Irelands scoreless,
the Stanford team stepped out like a
winning aggregation in the first time
at bat. "Shorty" Roberts led off with
a blow through second, and advanced
one base on Woodward's bunt. Hecken
dorf made a timely single which ne
gotiated "Shorty" over the pan, and
Stanford was in the lead.
In the second, however, Valla lined
a single over third, took second on a
ing was ended by a fast double play,
Clark to Peavv to Woodward.
Lose Chance in Second
Stanford lost the chance of a life
time in the second. Manouk planted
the ball on McCandless* person and
gave Peavy a base on balls. Patterson
then lifted a short hit to center field,
and McCandless, after reaching third,
turned arounfl and dashed madly back
to second under the impression that
Valla had made the catch. Peavy was
at second by that time, and in the
ensuing confusion both men were
tagged out and the outlook was quite
different.
The Independents rolled up three
hits for only one run in the fifth spasm.
Manouk made a dramatic exit from
the game with a manly wallop beyond
the outfield, which took him three
quarters of the way around the dia
mond. The Cardinal outfielders then
moved almost into the diamond to
cross Cliff, but Cliff contemptuously
gestured with his bat and planted the
ball just short of Carver's frantic grab,
for a pretty Texas leaguer. Manouk
galloped over the plate and into the
showers, leaving Koenig, of the St.
Paul Millers, to finish the game. Cliff
made second safely on Montague's
bingle. but was forced out at the semi
final corner on an infield roller by
Kearns. Carver ended the inning by
snagging a fly from Joe Kelly which
seemed good for another triple.
Cards Split in Eighth
The Cards put up their final spurt in
the eighth. Dick Lawson, batting for
Clark, whiffed, and Roberts made his
second single to right field. Woodward
scorched a hit down the third base line,
and Heckendorf advanced both run
ners with an infield out. Carver came
through in the pinch and dumped a
Texas leaguer in center field, which
eased "Shorty" over the hump. Valla,
however, whipped a perfect throw to
the plate and Woodward, with the
tying run. was cut down by a five-foot
margin. Peavy chopped out a single
in the ninth with two away, but Pat
terson popped to short and the game
ended.
Cliff entertained the spectators with
his usual caustic remarks, and had
three severe fainting-fits over flashy
grabs by Carver and Roberts. He will
be back on Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock to try and repeat, and will
make his final 1923 bow on the coming
Tuesday.

then lifted a short hit to center field,
and McCandless, after reaching third,
turned arounfl and dashed madly back
to second under the impression that
Valla had made the catch. Peavy was
at second by that time, and in the
ensuing confusion both men were
tagged out and the outlook was quite
different.
The Independents rolled up three
hits for only one run in the fifth spasm.
Manouk made a dramatic exit from
the game with a manly wallop beyond
the outfield, which took him three
quarters of the way around the dia
mond. The Cardinal outfielders then
moved almost into the diamond to
cross Cliff, but Cliff contemptuously
gestured with his bat and planted the
ball just short of Carver's frantic grab,
for a pretty Texas leaguer. Manouk
galloped over the plate and into the
showers, leaving Koenig, of the St.
Paul Millers, to finish the game. Cliff
made second safely on Montague's
bingle. but was forced out at the semi
final corner on an infield roller by
Kearns. Carver ended the inning by
snagging a fly from Joe Kelly which
seemed good for another triple.
Cards Split in Eighth
The Cards put up their final spurt in
the eighth. Dick Lawson, batting for
Clark, whiffed, and Roberts made his
second single to right field. Woodward
scorched a hit down the third base line,
and Heckendorf advanced both run
ners with an infield out. Carver came
through in the pinch and dumped a
Texas leaguer in center field, which
eased "Shorty" over the hump. Valla,
however, whipped a perfect throw to
the plate and Woodward, with the
tying run. was cut down by a five-foot
margin. Peavy chopped out a single
in the ninth with two away, but Pat
terson popped to short and the game
ended.
Cliff entertained the spectators with
his usual caustic remarks, and had
three severe fainting-fits over flashy
grabs by Carver and Roberts. He will
be back on Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock to try and repeat, and will
make his final 1923 bow on the coming
Tuesday.
Cliff Ireland and his diamond men
turned out to be just one run better
than the Cardinal varsity yesterday af
ternoon, and turned the Stanford base
ballers back with the short end of a
3-2 score. The Cards played an in-and
out game, with plenty of flashes of big
league stuff and just a few too many
gobs of bonehead fielding and base
running. Roy Carver distinguished him
self with two circus catches out in
center field and a neat single which
scored the second Stanford tally.
Second to the perennial Cliff, Gene
Valla and Herb Manouk garnered the
laurels for the Irishmen. Valla justi
fied the praises of San Francisco sport
writers by playing a flawless center
field game and laying out one of the
Irelands' seven hits. Manouk hurled
good ball for five innings, and turned
in the only extra base hit of the game
when he clicked out a screaming triple
between center and left.
Cards Score in First
After holding the Irelands scoreless,
the Stanford team stepped out like a
winning aggregation in the first time
at bat. "Shorty" Roberts led off with
a blow through second, and advanced
one base on Woodward's bunt. Hecken
dorf made a timely single which ne
gotiated "Shorty" over the pan, and
Stanford was in the lead.
In the second, however, Valla lined
a single over third, took second on a
ing was ended by a fast double play,
Clark to Peavv to Woodward.
Lose Chance in Second
Stanford lost the chance of a life
time in the second. Manouk planted
the ball on McCandless* person and
gave Peavy a base on balls. Patterson
then lifted a short hit to center field,
and McCandless, after reaching third,
turned arounfl and dashed madly back
