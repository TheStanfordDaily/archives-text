# CARD VARSITY AND BABE SOCCERITES WIN FROM BEARS
## Stanford Takes Final Game of Season by 3-1 Margin; Squads Slow in Starting 
### 
Stanford won the final soccer game
of the season yesterday afternoon from
the California eleven by a score of 3-1,
on the Berkeley football field. The
Babes defeated the Bruin Cubs in a
preliminary contest.
During the first half of the varsity
gam\3, the Stanford forwards did not
work together and their single goal
came when Howe put the bull in the
i cage on a penalty kick. The California
men made their one count in the first
half on a kick which hit the top of the
1 cage, bounded back into the field, and
was then kicked into the net.
In the second period the Stanford
forwards worked with machine-like
precision and scored two goals on di
rect and well-calculated rushes down
the field. Ta'am and Dwight played
good ball. The Blue and Gold put their
strongest lineup on the field.
