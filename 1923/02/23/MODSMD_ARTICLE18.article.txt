# GETTING STANFORD'S JONAH

### 
This is no time to talk of moral victories. Stanford
was outplayed and lost in Harmon gymnasium
Wednesday night. Andy Kerr is probably silghtly
better fitted than we are to tell the players them
selves what is the matter with them, but it does seem
that California teams have the happy faculty of buf
faloing our men. If there is anything in the psy
chology of autosuggestion, let's test it tonight by
going to that game firm in the conviction that Stan
ford is going to win. It will not have to be the
usual sentimental attitude, for Stanford really has a
basketball team capable of outplaying any opponent.
The thing to combat is the feeling that California
will win simply because she has done so repeatedly
in the experience of the present college generation.
