# VARSITY WATER POLO SEVEN TO MIX WITH TEAM OF ALL-STARS
## 
### 
What chance will the Stanford water
polo seven have in the national cham
pionships in Chicago next month? This
question will be decided tomorrow after
noon when the varsity meets the San
Francisco Insurrectos in Encina Pool at
2:30.
Although Stanford has one of the
leading teams on the Coast, the aggre
gation of veterans which will face the
Cardinal tomorrow is considered by
authorities to be the equal of any of the
Eastern teams who will participate at
Chicago. The backs, Resleure, Gardiner,
and Smith, are of championship caliber,
and should be a hard combination for
the Cards to break. The forwards arc
fast and clever.
Against this array of stars, Coach
Ernie Brandsten will send his full
strength. This means that he will use
the men who will make the trip to Chi
cago, with the exception of Austin, who
is still playing basketball. O'Connor, a
freshman, will play sprint, while Fletcher
is a veteran, and is expected to give a
good account of himself in the struggle.
Meyers is playing his first year on the
varsity, but is showing excellent form.
McCallister, Schmieder, and Captain
Lacey, who is working out his third year
on the varsity, will play the back posi
tions. Collett will start at goal.
The remainder of the schedule for the
Stanford team includes a game on March
2 with an all-star San Francisco beach
team, and a meet with California on
March 9 in the Olympic Club tank.
