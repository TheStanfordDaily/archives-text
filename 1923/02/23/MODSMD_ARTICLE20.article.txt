Yesterday was more than Washington's birthday.
It marked Cliff Ireland's annual visit to the campus.
Ireland, the inimitable, always has a number of
recognized star baseball players in his line-up. These
men are the attractions that excite admiration. From
the sublime to the ridiculous is a short jump. Ireland
himself is the bathos.
Ireland is not ridiculous from a ]>oint of compar
ison. He can still cavort around second base in a
manner to excite admiration. Ireland is the ridicu
lous because it is part of his mental makeup.
Ireland is elderly in years. He is youthful in na
ture. For thirty years he has been bringing a base
ball team to Stanford to provide competition for the
Cardinal varsity. For thirty years he has brought
fun to the faithful who grace the stands because they
know he does bring fun.
