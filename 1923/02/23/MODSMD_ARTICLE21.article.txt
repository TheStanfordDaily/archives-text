# "DO" RATHER THAN "DON'T"

In "Old Man Dare's Talks to College Men," a
book which is on the whole rather cheaply written
and puerile, Dr. I loward Dement has dropped a sug
gestion that merits some attention. He says:
"Among other things, he had made very clear to
us that he didn't especially blame underclassmen for
being damn fools; lie said quite frankly that he had
been one himself. But lie did blame all college stu
dents, not for what they did that was off-color, but
for the insufferable number of essential things they
failed to do. 'I don't ask you not to do this or that,'
he said; 'you will probably be asses enough to do it
no matter what I say. I don't ask you never to touch
a drop; I don't ask you not to raise hell like
hoodlums; T don't ask you, in short, not to do any
thing. If your own inbred ideas of what is decent
and right won't direct you, nothing from me will
induce you to he decent and gentlemanly and clean.
But I am full of wrath at the thought of the things
you don't do: the things for the doing of which you
really came to college in the first place:' "
Which leads to the observation that practically
anything we do at college is worth while in building
up a basis of experience for future life—and some
«if the most foolish things may help the most. But
it is the man who sits around and does nothing who
will Ix* at a loss when it comes time to worry about
keeping the pantry full.
