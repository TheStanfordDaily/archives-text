How much better life would be if we all agreed that
nobody under twenty-five had any brains. Some of us
know this, and some of us don't; but think of the strain
that we all subject ourselves to, trying to live up to
something we haven't got.
Some time soon, when the present furor for intelli
gence tests and the "new" psychology has died away,
somebody will become famous for remarking the striking
parallelism between the evolutionary development of the
powers of mind and the powers of body. It is really
remarkable how ipany college men have nothing but a
perfectly regular, precise animal equipment. They can
never be polite without being obviously so; not having
acquired the fundamentals of a mental machinery, they
not only have no ideas but also, and what is, worse,
cannot recognize one apart from its sentimental back
ground; and they seem to be most commended as
"typical" when they register absolute blanks. This is
precisely what would be expected if a monkey or an
anthropoid ape were suddenly endowed with conscious
ness. —
There are three quite distinct classes of them. I
suppose the most intelligent being a student body can
boast is the man with prejudices. These are those who
take their ideas either too literally or else not literally
enough. They head everything from newspapers to
college fraternities. The damage they do on the young
minds they influence can never be calculated. They are
in the first flush of the last century's ideas: they believe
or disbelieve literally in the. Bible, fraternities, hazing,
athletics, studying, art, politics, and so on; and they
never hold two ideas, and those perhaps contradictory,
at once.
Inferior to, and more common than the man with
prejudices, is the man whose mentality, after grasping
all the standard generalities of the race, has gone to
sleep. This man is untouchable by logic, and knows
no laws but the fine ones that are meaningless; and even
to those he is faithless. This man is usually stupidly
handsome, and is fond of taking co-eds home from
dances.
Below these two is a third man, and may Heaven
help him! He is the one whose conversation can be
predicted twelve minutes beforehand, whose mind can
not grasp the possibility of trees being pink when he
has seen them nothing but green, and who changes the
subject whenever it shows signs of being worth while.
He has but one name for all conversation, and he works
that early and late.
And they are all studying quite hard for the profes
sions and will undoubtedly all get degrees and be
respectable citizens some day.
