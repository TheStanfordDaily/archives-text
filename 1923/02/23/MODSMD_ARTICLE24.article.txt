# What Wickedness!

Some of the off-campus publicity
| given the "censoring" of one of Chap
i py's exchange clippings has implied that
the eagle eye of some censor fell upon
I the piece, that the magazine was yanked
from the protesting hands of the staff,
and that the all-powerful censor then
proceeded to blot out the joke. One of
the city papers even decided that it had
been necessary to run the completed
j copies through the presy again to ink
out the item, and that Clwppy wouldn't
be on sale till Monday.
It grieves me not to be able to claim
! the inventive faculty which would be
necessary in order to accomplish the
running of bound copies of the maga
zine through the press, but I blotted the
joke out myself with my little rubber
I stamp.
As a matter of fact, the item was part
j of a batch of holdover copy and the lirst
time I saw the offender was when the
issue was being carried up from the
press room to be distributed. I held up
! distribution long enough to run through
j the edition and smear that joke. Such
j entertaining specks of smut of the vint
age of the 1899 are verboten in the col
umns of Chappy, and the joke would
| have gone out of the magazine because
lof age if it hadn't on account of ra'nk
! ness.
...
The intimation that a faculty censor
! did the job is a brain-child of one of our
numerous imaginative off-campus cor
respondents, apparently. Neither Chap
arral nor any other Hammer and Coffin
publications submits to external censor
i ship, and any surplus ink on its pages
|is there at the direction of the editor
! and no one else.
