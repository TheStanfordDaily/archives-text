; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA â€”
Plans ami specifications for the main
| concrete super-structure of the Univer
sity of California Stadium are being
prepared and will be completed soon.
The work on the stadium has been
rushed during the past week, and plans
have been made to hold off the water
from any storm that may come. A
I slide of 100 cubic yards of earth oc
curred last week, so that work on the
| stadium was somewhat hindered. It is
expected that concrete work on the
tunnels will be finished by the end of
the week in order that the main con
struction of the stadium can be started.
