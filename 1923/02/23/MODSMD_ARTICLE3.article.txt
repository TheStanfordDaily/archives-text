An interesting example of the
Malthusian theory of population
was brought forth Wednesday after
noon when three carloads of thor
oughbred Holstein cattle arrived at
the Palo Alto Stock Farm from a
point in Wisconsin. The shipment
started with seventy-five inhabit
ants, but when the animals filed out
of the cars the astounded attend
ants counted eighty. The Farm
would seem to be striking it rich.
The new arrivals were so weakened
by adverse conditions that they
were scarcely able to withstand the
force of the far-famed California
sunshine.
