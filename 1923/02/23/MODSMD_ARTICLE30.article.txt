# Sophomore Women to Play Senior Basket Six Monday
## 
### 
The women's senior sextette will
meet the sophomore court six in the
third game of the interclass series
on Monday.
At present, the senior squad is the
only one that has won a victory in
the interclass tilts, having defeated
the freshmen by one point. The sopho
mores tied with the juniors, 15-15.
In the preliminary games the sen
iors won by close margins, defeating
the sophomores by a 20-19 score. The
1926 women made the same showing in
the practice contests that the juniors
did . Each squad won, tied, and lost a
game.
Senior and sophomore sextettes have
star forwards. Hazel Churchman, sen
ior forward, and Grace Judd, playing
for the 1926 team, can cage shots from
the field and shoot from the foul-line
with accuracy.
Polly Learnard and Ruth Stucky,
sophomore girls, do consistent team
work and know how to cover the for
wards.
The centers on the teams haven't
shown the same amount of skill in
teamwork and quick passing as. the wo
men who play near the goals. Success
for either squad in Monday's tilt will
depend upon the ability of the centers
to keep the ball in the forwards' terri
tory.
