# BABE NINE LOSES IO SAINT MARY'S PREPS
## 
### 
Fourteen hits, half of them for extra
bases, gave the 1926 baseball team a taste
of defeat at the hands of St. Mary's
Prep Wednesday afternoon by a 12-10
score. Coach Hunt tried hard to avoid
using Ditzler, as he has been working
too much of late, but after Nevers and
Draper met with ill success on the
mound, Hunt was forced to send him in
or submit to a lop-sided score. Ditzler
allowed one hit and struck out five men
in the two innings left to him.
A double and a triple in the first bout
gave St. Mary's a two-run lead, but the
Babes came back in their half and crowd
ed three runs over on a single, a double,
and a bevy of errors. St. Mary's pro
duced another brace of two-baggers and
a single, which turned out to be good for
two more counters, but the yearlings
manufactured three synthetic tallies and
took the lead, 6-4.
That was all for the x Cardinal men for
;r few innings, but the St. Mary's boys
kept right on going. A hit and a walk
placed two men on the paths in the next
frame, and Sutherland tried to bunt, but
the bunt screeched through third base
for a clean single. Tobin came along
with a twin-sack clout which sponged
the bases, and St. Mary's led, 7-6.
Tobin figured again two innings later,
when lie scored Sutherland on a sacri
fice fly. The play was pretty well mixed
up, and Umpire Seay neglected to drive
Tobin off the bases, so the latter im
proved his opportunity and rang up an
other fare at the plate for St. Mary's.
Seay then noticed his oversight and the
transbay men lost the score. Two runs
came in during this inning, however.
At this point Hunt yanked Nevers,
whose arm was tiring, and sent "Paddy"
Draper over from first base to do the
flinging. Draper got by well indeed for
a first baseman, but in his second inning
he allowed a double and two singles,
which yielded two runs. Stanford was
able to equal these scores with the help
of a walk drawn by Lovelace and a po
tent triple by A1 Lucas. Aydelott also
drew a blow in this inning, but died in
an attempt to steal third.
With the advent of Ditzler in the
eighth inning, things took on a different
aspect. The first St. Mary's man to face
him hit safely, and that was all. A base
on balls, followed by poor support on the
part of the yearlings, brought in the
twelfth and final tally. Stanford's ninth
and tenth counters came in the semi-final
inning, on singles by Lovelace and Lucas
and a St. Mary's bobble.
Ditzler had a "surprise ball," which he
worked on the visitors to perfection.
Immediately upon reaching the box, he
spun around and laid the ball over the
plate with no wind-up at all. The bats
men, without exception, swung wildly at
it and fanned out ingloriously. Duffy
Seay had some difficulty in convincing
the argumentative Irishmen that the ball
was legal.

Fourteen hits, half of them for extra
bases, gave the 1926 baseball team a taste
of defeat at the hands of St. Mary's
Prep Wednesday afternoon by a 12-10
score. Coach Hunt tried hard to avoid
using Ditzler, as he has been working
too much of late, but after Nevers and
Draper met with ill success on the
mound, Hunt was forced to send him in
or submit to a lop-sided score. Ditzler
allowed one hit and struck out five men
in the two innings left to him.
A double and a triple in the first bout
gave St. Mary's a two-run lead, but the
Babes came back in their half and crowd
ed three runs over on a single, a double,
and a bevy of errors. St. Mary's pro
duced another brace of two-baggers and
a single, which turned out to be good for
two more counters, but the yearlings
manufactured three synthetic tallies and
took the lead, 6-4.
That was all for the x Cardinal men for
;r few innings, but the St. Mary's boys
kept right on going. A hit and a walk
placed two men on the paths in the next
frame, and Sutherland tried to bunt, but
the bunt screeched through third base
for a clean single. Tobin came along
with a twin-sack clout which sponged
the bases, and St. Mary's led, 7-6.
Tobin figured again two innings later,
when lie scored Sutherland on a sacri
fice fly. The play was pretty well mixed
up, and Umpire Seay neglected to drive
Tobin off the bases, so the latter im
proved his opportunity and rang up an
other fare at the plate for St. Mary's.
Seay then noticed his oversight and the
transbay men lost the score. Two runs
came in during this inning, however.
At this point Hunt yanked Nevers,
whose arm was tiring, and sent "Paddy"
Draper over from first base to do the
flinging. Draper got by well indeed for
a first baseman, but in his second inning
he allowed a double and two singles,
which yielded two runs. Stanford was
able to equal these scores with the help
of a walk drawn by Lovelace and a po
tent triple by A1 Lucas. Aydelott also
drew a blow in this inning, but died in
an attempt to steal third.
With the advent of Ditzler in the
eighth inning, things took on a different
aspect. The first St. Mary's man to face
him hit safely, and that was all. A base
on balls, followed by poor support on the
part of the yearlings, brought in the
twelfth and final tally. Stanford's ninth
and tenth counters came in the semi-final
inning, on singles by Lovelace and Lucas
and a St. Mary's bobble.
Ditzler had a "surprise ball," which he
worked on the visitors to perfection.
Immediately upon reaching the box, he
spun around and laid the ball over the
plate with no wind-up at all. The bats
men, without exception, swung wildly at
it and fanned out ingloriously. Duffy
Seay had some difficulty in convincing
