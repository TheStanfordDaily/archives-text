### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Stanford failed to stage that cus- K.vte, and Douhit brought the Bears
tomary come-back in the second half within one point, of tying the count.

of the game Wednesday night, and the
Bruin quintet triumphed 30-20 at Har
mon Gym in the third game of the
series. The Bears led 19-17 at half
time.
The going was fast and furious in
the first period but the Cardinal de
fense went to pieces in the second
half, and Talt, Douhit, and Kyte scored
from all angles.
Running true to t'9rm, "Nip" McHose
put the Cards in the lead in the first
two minutes by sinking a pair of field
baskets and a free one. The little fel
low piled them in so fast that the
California defense was caught napping.
Johnnie Talt then started taking a
hand in the proceedings. He caged one
under the basket and added two more
points when Rogers fouled Hovetiin,
tying the score a minute later when
Janssen committed a personal.
The Cardinals again took the lead
when Anderson sunk a pretty one from
side court and Janssen dropped one in
under the hoop. McHose added another
digit on a foul and "Lefty" Rogers put
Stanford on the long end of a 12-5
score with a pretty shot from the cen
ter of the court.
California Tightens
The California defense tightened
when O'Neill replaced Houvenin at
center and baskets by the lanky fellow,

Talt dropped in a pretty one, giving
the Bruins a lead which they never lost
during the rest of the game. Douhit
caged another pretty one and Cali
fornia led 15-12.
Anderson shot his second basket
from side court and "Nip" tied the
count at 15-15 with a free throw. Bas
kets by O'Neill and Douhit gave Cali
fornia a four-point lead which McHose
cut in with a pair of free ones as the
half ended.
The Bruin defensive looked to be too
strong for the Cardinals in the first
half. Both teams were opening up more
than in either of the first two games
and were scoring repeatedly on long
shots.
Long Shots Count
Douhit started the second period by
sinking one from the center of the
floor and Talt followed suit a minute
later. The Card defense couldn't stop
the long shots and Talt brought the
score to 25-17 when he caged one from
near the middle of the court. "Nip"
shot a free one but O'Neill again got
the range and the scoreboard read,
27-18. Kyte scored the Bruins' last field
basket and it was 29-18.
Kerr sent in a flock of substitutes
with four minutes left to play and
Oliva, Anderson, McHose, and Rogers
went out to rest. When Andy sent his
passed ball and completed the circuit
when Woodward foozled a low throw
by Roberts on Richie's grounder, j
Cliff's men went out in front in the
third, when Montague opened with a
single and went the rest of the way
on a general blow-up by the Stanford
infield. By way of redemption the scor
regulars back in, Coach Wight shoved
Captain LeHane and four other "subs"
into the fray.
Steele got the last field basket of
the game and the score was 29-20. I
Johnnie Talt sunk a free one just be
fore the timer's gun ended the fracas. 1
Talt High Man
Talt, with four field?goals and as :
many free ones, was high point man.
McHose followed him closely with
three from the field and four free
tosses. Douhit scored four and O'Neill
three field baskets.
On the defensive, Kincaid for Cali- j
fornia and Oliva for Stanford played j
havoc with the forwards. "Lefty" Rog
ers played his usual fast floor game
and sunk a field basket.
The two teams meet for the fourth
game of the series in the Pavilion to- |
night at 8 o'clock. The Bears' decisive j
victory Wednesday stamps them as
the favorites, but the Cardinals always !
have to be reckoned with on their own
court.
The Bruins will probably line up
with O'Neill at center, Douhit and Talt
at forward, and Kincaid and Kyte at
guard tonight. Kerr will probably start
his regulars, Janssen, McHose, and
Rogers, and Anderson and Oliva.
A win for the Bears will tie them
with Stanford for the right to repre
sent the southern colleges in the strug
gle for the Pacific Coast Conference
title, while a victory for Stanford will
eliminate Coach Wight's team.

mon Gym in the third game of the
series. The Bears led 19-17 at half
time.
The going was fast and furious in
the first period but the Cardinal de
fense went to pieces in the second
half, and Talt, Douhit, and Kyte scored
from all angles.
Running true to t'9rm, "Nip" McHose
put the Cards in the lead in the first
two minutes by sinking a pair of field
baskets and a free one. The little fel
low piled them in so fast that the
California defense was caught napping.
Johnnie Talt then started taking a
hand in the proceedings. He caged one
under the basket and added two more
points when Rogers fouled Hovetiin,
tying the score a minute later when
Janssen committed a personal.

when Anderson sunk a pretty one from
side court and Janssen dropped one in
under the hoop. McHose added another
digit on a foul and "Lefty" Rogers put

than in either of the first two games
and were scoring repeatedly on long
shots.
Long Shots Count
Douhit started the second period by
sinking one from the center of the
floor and Talt followed suit a minute
later. The Card defense couldn't stop

regulars back in, Coach Wight shoved
Captain LeHane and four other "subs"
into the fray.
Steele got the last field basket of
the game and the score was 29-20. I
Johnnie Talt sunk a free one just be

Talt High Man
Talt, with four field?goals and as :
many free ones, was high point man.
McHose followed him closely with
three from the field and four free
tosses. Douhit scored four and O'Neill
three field baskets.
On the defensive, Kincaid for Cali- j
fornia and Oliva for Stanford played j
havoc with the forwards. "Lefty" Rog
ers played his usual fast floor game
and sunk a field basket.
The two teams meet for the fourth
game of the series in the Pavilion to- |
night at 8 o'clock. The Bears' decisive j
victory Wednesday stamps them as
the favorites, but the Cardinals always !
have to be reckoned with on their own
court.
The Bruins will probably line up
with O'Neill at center, Douhit and Talt
at forward, and Kincaid and Kyte at
guard tonight. Kerr will probably start
his regulars, Janssen, McHose, and
Rogers, and Anderson and Oliva.
A win for the Bears will tie them
with Stanford for the right to repre
sent the southern colleges in the strug
gle for the Pacific Coast Conference
title, while a victory for Stanford will
eliminate Coach Wight's team.
Stanford failed to stage that cus- K.vte, and Douhit brought the Bears

of the game Wednesday night, and the
Bruin quintet triumphed 30-20 at Har
mon Gym in the third game of the
series. The Bears led 19-17 at half
time.
The going was fast and furious in
the first period but the Cardinal de
fense went to pieces in the second
half, and Talt, Douhit, and Kyte scored
from all angles.
Running true to t'9rm, "Nip" McHose
put the Cards in the lead in the first
two minutes by sinking a pair of field
baskets and a free one. The little fel
low piled them in so fast that the
California defense was caught napping.
Johnnie Talt then started taking a
hand in the proceedings. He caged one
under the basket and added two more
points when Rogers fouled Hovetiin,
tying the score a minute later when
Janssen committed a personal.
The Cardinals again took the lead
when Anderson sunk a pretty one from
side court and Janssen dropped one in
under the hoop. McHose added another
digit on a foul and "Lefty" Rogers put
Stanford on the long end of a 12-5
score with a pretty shot from the cen
ter of the court.
California Tightens
The California defense tightened
when O'Neill replaced Houvenin at
center and baskets by the lanky fellow,

Talt dropped in a pretty one, giving
the Bruins a lead which they never lost
during the rest of the game. Douhit
caged another pretty one and Cali
fornia led 15-12.
Anderson shot his second basket
from side court and "Nip" tied the
count at 15-15 with a free throw. Bas
kets by O'Neill and Douhit gave Cali
fornia a four-point lead which McHose
cut in with a pair of free ones as the
half ended.
The Bruin defensive looked to be too
strong for the Cardinals in the first
half. Both teams were opening up more
than in either of the first two games
and were scoring repeatedly on long
shots.
Long Shots Count
Douhit started the second period by
sinking one from the center of the
floor and Talt followed suit a minute
later. The Card defense couldn't stop
the long shots and Talt brought the
score to 25-17 when he caged one from
near the middle of the court. "Nip"
shot a free one but O'Neill again got
the range and the scoreboard read,
27-18. Kyte scored the Bruins' last field
basket and it was 29-18.
Kerr sent in a flock of substitutes
with four minutes left to play and
Oliva, Anderson, McHose, and Rogers
went out to rest. When Andy sent his
passed ball and completed the circuit
when Woodward foozled a low throw
by Roberts on Richie's grounder, j
Cliff's men went out in front in the
third, when Montague opened with a
single and went the rest of the way
on a general blow-up by the Stanford
infield. By way of redemption the scor
regulars back in, Coach Wight shoved
Captain LeHane and four other "subs"
