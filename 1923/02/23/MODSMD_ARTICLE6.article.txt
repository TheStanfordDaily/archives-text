tomary come-back in the second half within one point, of tying the count.

of the game Wednesday night, and the
Bruin quintet triumphed 30-20 at Har
mon Gym in the third game of the
series. The Bears led 19-17 at half
time.
The going was fast and furious in
the first period but the Cardinal de
fense went to pieces in the second
half, and Talt, Douhit, and Kyte scored
from all angles.
Running true to t'9rm, "Nip" McHose
put the Cards in the lead in the first
two minutes by sinking a pair of field
baskets and a free one. The little fel
low piled them in so fast that the
California defense was caught napping.
Johnnie Talt then started taking a
hand in the proceedings. He caged one
under the basket and added two more
points when Rogers fouled Hovetiin,
tying the score a minute later when
Janssen committed a personal.
The Cardinals again took the lead
when Anderson sunk a pretty one from
side court and Janssen dropped one in
under the hoop. McHose added another
digit on a foul and "Lefty" Rogers put
Stanford on the long end of a 12-5
score with a pretty shot from the cen
ter of the court.
California Tightens
The California defense tightened
when O'Neill replaced Houvenin at
center and baskets by the lanky fellow,

Talt dropped in a pretty one, giving
the Bruins a lead which they never lost
during the rest of the game. Douhit
caged another pretty one and Cali
fornia led 15-12.
Anderson shot his second basket
from side court and "Nip" tied the
count at 15-15 with a free throw. Bas
kets by O'Neill and Douhit gave Cali
fornia a four-point lead which McHose
cut in with a pair of free ones as the
half ended.
The Bruin defensive looked to be too
strong for the Cardinals in the first
half. Both teams were opening up more
than in either of the first two games
and were scoring repeatedly on long
shots.
Long Shots Count
Douhit started the second period by
sinking one from the center of the
floor and Talt followed suit a minute
later. The Card defense couldn't stop
the long shots and Talt brought the
score to 25-17 when he caged one from
near the middle of the court. "Nip"
shot a free one but O'Neill again got
the range and the scoreboard read,
27-18. Kyte scored the Bruins' last field
basket and it was 29-18.
Kerr sent in a flock of substitutes
with four minutes left to play and
Oliva, Anderson, McHose, and Rogers
went out to rest. When Andy sent his
