UNIVERSITY OF OREGON—Ac
cording to interviews with a score of
Oregon college women, the Oregon
ians are not spending much time wor
rying about husbands. Contrary to the
worldly view of such things, their at
titude seems to be "Plenty of time
for that later."
But they do have ideas on the sub
ject. Again the general attitude is
proven at fault, for not one of the
Oregon collegiennes made wealth a
requirement to her marital happiness.
"Personality" and "intellect" rated
highest among the things that a good
husband must hav«.
Most of the women wanted them
at least fairly good looking and one
insisted that he must have his hair
cut at least once a month. "Mascu
line" men will be at a premium, and
they should be "dominant but not dom
inating" in the home. Irritable men
will have to remain unmarried, and
the eccentric ones will have no small
difficulty in finding mates.
