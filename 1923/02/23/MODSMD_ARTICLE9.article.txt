# Invasion of Campus Motorist Paradise Promised for Future
## 
### 
Some night in the near future, those I
who drive cars may have occasion to be
surprised. The casual, conservative mo
torist who travels at a rate termed "sane
and sensible" by the courts and the speed]
cop fraternity, might enjoy the festivities
from the sidelines. But the speed demon
will probably dash into the trap and be
come one of the active participants.
The entire Santa Clara police squad
will be the guests of Stanford before
many more moons have passed. Student
motorists will then get the surprise of
their lives if they try to do any Ralph de
Palma stuff along Palm drive.
Fred Frehe, deputy sheriff, was in
earnest when lie made this statement yes
terday in the Corporation Yards. He be
lieves that there is a way to catch stu
dents who make a practice of trying to
establish world records on Palm drive.
And he intends making a "big haul" some
time when the motorists least expect it.
"When students arc arrested for
speeding, they usually offer the cxcuse
that they were driving within the law
Several say that their speedometers were
broken. Only one who I can remember
actually confessed that he had violated
the speed limit.
"Most of the student arrests arc made
comparatively early in the evening—
about 7:30 or 8 o'clock," Frehe said.
"Friday evening is the best time, for it
is then that students who are through

with their work for the week are so in
sistent on getting 'to a place somewhere
off the campus* that they push down ex
tra hard on the accelerator."
Closed cars hold the records for ar
rests, few undignified Ford cut-downs
being included in the machines called.
What proved to be most surprising,
though, was Frehe's statement that few
cars driven by "queeners" were ever ar
rested on tile charge of traveling too fast.
And yet when everything is taken into
consideration, there really isn't much
cause for surprise, for—well, queeners
will be queeners.
"Students who arc arrested, usually
travel at a rate just a little above that
allowed by law. More are taken into
custody for traveling at forty miles an
hour than at any other speed."
In the future it is going to go hard
with those who park their cars in front
of the chains which block off the re
stricted areas by the Quad, according to
Fiehe. Machines have been tagged re
peatedly, but the owners have taken the
matter as a huge joke. The deputy mar
shal is particularly insistent that cars be
not parked in these places for the reason
that in case of fire, the fire trucks would
have to make an unnecessary detour.
And again, he says that the machines are
usually so close together that students
on their way to the Library often have
to detour themselves.

though, was Frehe's statement that few
cars driven by "queeners" were ever ar
rested on tile charge of traveling too fast.
And yet when everything is taken into
consideration, there really isn't much
cause for surprise, for—well, queeners
will be queeners.
"Students who arc arrested, usually
travel at a rate just a little above that
allowed by law. More are taken into
custody for traveling at forty miles an
hour than at any other speed."
In the future it is going to go hard
with those who park their cars in front
of the chains which block off the re
stricted areas by the Quad, according to
Fiehe. Machines have been tagged re
peatedly, but the owners have taken the
matter as a huge joke. The deputy mar
shal is particularly insistent that cars be
not parked in these places for the reason
that in case of fire, the fire trucks would
have to make an unnecessary detour.
And again, he says that the machines are
usually so close together that students
on their way to the Library often have
to detour themselves.
Some night in the near future, those I
who drive cars may have occasion to be
surprised. The casual, conservative mo
torist who travels at a rate termed "sane
and sensible" by the courts and the speed]
cop fraternity, might enjoy the festivities
from the sidelines. But the speed demon
will probably dash into the trap and be
come one of the active participants.
The entire Santa Clara police squad
will be the guests of Stanford before
many more moons have passed. Student
motorists will then get the surprise of
their lives if they try to do any Ralph de
Palma stuff along Palm drive.
Fred Frehe, deputy sheriff, was in
earnest when lie made this statement yes
terday in the Corporation Yards. He be
lieves that there is a way to catch stu
dents who make a practice of trying to
establish world records on Palm drive.
And he intends making a "big haul" some
time when the motorists least expect it.
"When students arc arrested for
speeding, they usually offer the cxcuse
that they were driving within the law
Several say that their speedometers were
broken. Only one who I can remember
actually confessed that he had violated
the speed limit.
"Most of the student arrests arc made
comparatively early in the evening—
about 7:30 or 8 o'clock," Frehe said.
"Friday evening is the best time, for it
is then that students who are through

with their work for the week are so in
sistent on getting 'to a place somewhere
off the campus* that they push down ex
tra hard on the accelerator."
Closed cars hold the records for ar
rests, few undignified Ford cut-downs
being included in the machines called.
What proved to be most surprising,
though, was Frehe's statement that few
