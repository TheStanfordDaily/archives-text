Spring's Loveliest Taffetas
are at Roos Bros, now i
High grade Taffeta Dresses in navy blue, new browns
and black. "Mostly navy." Clever little frocks that
go in for basques, full skirts bouffantly circular, wide
berthas, deep tucks, cascading ruffles, wee tucks, with
picot edge and metal threads. Touches of Oriental
color give bits of Spring's "joie de vivre."
