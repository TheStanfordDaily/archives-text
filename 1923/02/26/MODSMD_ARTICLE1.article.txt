# BRUIN FIVE WINS FOURTH BATTLE OF CARDINAL SERIES
## Stanford Quintet Loses by 33-17 Score; Bears Will Play for Conference Title 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
California 33, Stanford 17.
When one basketball team defeats
another by a margin of sixteen points,
alibis are usually in order, especially
when the defeated team was given the
edge on the basis of early season
scores. And yet, an aggregation that
puts up a fight like the Cardinals did
in the Pavilion Friday night neither
in the Pavilion Saturday night neither
asks for nor needs any help from old
man Alibi.
The Stanford quintet met a good
team, in fact one of the best that has
been seen on the Pacific Coast since
the 1921 Card varsity brought the Con
ference title to the Farm. It is no dis
grace to lose to a team like that.
After the first ten minutes of the
game, the outcome was hever in doubt.
The Bruins were putting up a defense
that the Cardinal scoring machine
could not penetrate, and they were
sinking the leather pellet from all
angles and positions.
Although California's victory Fri
day night ties the two teams in the
Conference standing, each being cred
ited with five victories and three de
feats, the Bears will go north without
playing the extra game, according to
Graduate Manager W. D. Fletcher.
Stanford's withdrawal from the race
will give Coach Wight's team a sorely
needed rest.
O'Neill scored first for California
Friday night on a lucky shot from the
edge of the penalty zone. After tight
guarding by Kincaid and Kyte had
kept McHose and Rogers from the
Bruin basket. Janssen got loose and
sank a pretty one from side court. Both
teams were fighting hard for the ball
but the forwards were having trouble
in locating the hoop. The score was
still 2-2 after seven minutes and Stan
ford took time out. The Cards took the
lead for the first and only time of the
fracas two minutes later when "Nip"!
McHose sunk one from the center of
the floor.
The Bear scoring combination then
got into action and baskets by Kyte,
Talt, and two by Douthit gave Cali-j
fornia a 10-4 lead. "Nip" added a point
on a free throw but Kyte made one
from under the hoop with two men on I
him and it was 12-5. Kincaid made his
third personal foul and McHose added
two more. Anderson brought the crowd
to its feet by a pretty shot from side
court, and the score stood 12-9 with
four minutes to play in the first half.:
A great deal happened in those four,
minutes.
Talt caged a free one. Then three
shots in rapid succession by O'Neill,
Kyte, and Douthit brought the Bruins'
total to nineteen as the helf ended.
"Lefty" Rogers started the second
half by caging a long one from side
court. Talt came back with a field goal
and a pair of free ones and the score
board said 23-11. "Nip" dribbled around
Kincaid and brought the Cardinal total
to thirteen. On the next play Kincaid
committed his fourth personal foul and
was taken from the game. Captain Le-
Hane substituted for him. McHose
made one of the free throws. O'Neill
made a long one and Douthit sunk two
of them. 29-14.
Glicrease, who substituted for Talt,
and Kyte each scored from the field
and McHose dropped in three free ones
in the last four minutes.
The Bears played safe at all times
after they had piled up a lead. When
Kincaid, Kyte, or LeHane held the ball,
they were "booed" for stalling. It didn't
' look like stalling. It was good basket
| ball, for almost every time Douthit or
! Kyte would get loose, dribble down the
floor and score on a long shot.
Stanford showed the effects of a long
and strenuous season in Friday night's
game. Six men on the squad have
borne the brunt of the entire prelimin
ary season. The California team has
had a wealth of good substitutes, so
good, in fact, that Douthit, who starred
in the last two games, had been warm
ing the bench previously.
"Nip" McHose was high point man
of the game, sinking two field baskets
and seven out of twelve free ones for
a total of eleven digits. Douthit with
five and Kyte with four field goals
followed closely.
The playing of Rogers, McHose, and
Anderson, who played with an injured

leg, kept the Bears from piling op a
still bigger lead. The Cardinal skipper
played the floor in a sensational man
ner as did Anderson and McHose.
Kyte and Douthit were the outstanding
players for California.
