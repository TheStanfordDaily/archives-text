### 
Beta Theta Pi won the University \
nitramural basketball championship by |
defeating Delta Tau Delta, 11-7, Friday
night in a game preliminary to the j
Stanford-California varsity contest. Al
though Delta Tau Delta scored first
on a freÂ« throw, the Beta Theta Pi
players came back with a free throw,
a basket, and another free throw be
fore the end of the half.
The game was slow in getting start
intramural basketball championship by
show the form they had displayed in
preceding contests.
Both teams presented an almost air
tight defense at the start, but with the
beginning of the second period the
forwards were able to break through
more frequently for shots at the bas
ket. Dole put up a strong game at
standing guard for Beta Theta Pi and
always seemed to get the ball from
the man coming in or from the back
board. Collett did equally good guard

ing for Delta Tau Delta.
After the men got warmed up the
game became faster but on a number
of rushes to the goal the players were
too fast for their own dribbling. Mixon
played a fast floor same for Delta Tau
Delta and was responsible for the
rushes down th*> court which resulted
in goals. Alabaster and Granger did
some pretty dribbling and passing for
Beta Theta Pi, although the teamwork
was a little weak.
Between the halves, plaques were
presented to the winners of the six
intramural leagues by Dean Culver,
Representatives of Beta Theta Pi,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi Kappa Psi,
Delta Chi, Delta Tau Delta, and Sigma
Chi received them for their teams. At
the close of the game a large banner
was presented to the Beta Theta Pi
players as they left the floor. The con
test was refereed by "Rabbit" Brad
shaw.
