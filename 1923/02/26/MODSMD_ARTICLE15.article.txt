## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club will partici
pate in the first intercollegiate glee club
contest ever staged on the Pacific
Coast in the Los Angeles Philharmonic
Auditorium April 2. Organizations from
eight California universities, including
Stanford, U. S. C., U. C. Southern
Branch, Redlands, Occidental, and Po
mona will take part. It is planned that
within the next few years the winner
on the Coast will go East and partici
pate in the sectional contest there.
Glee clubs of California universities
during the past few months organized
the Intercollegiate Glee Club Associa
tion. Each club is represented on its
Board of Directors. The Los Angeles
City Club, an organization for the sup
port of the highest community ideals
and interests, has co-operated with the
association to make this first concert a
success both musically and financially. |
All competing clubs will sing the
prize number, "The Hunter's Song,"
by Mendelssohn, under the direction of
one of the best-known musical leaders
in Los Angeles. The decision of the
j contest will depend mainly on the
rendition of this song. In addition,
each club will also sing two other
numbers, one of which wlil be of
j a lighter vein.
The glee club association on the
Coast is similar to one in the East
which has been in existence for sev
eral years and has proved a success.
Thousands have been turned away !
every year from Carnegie Hall, New
York City, where the contests have
been held.
Universities and colleges in the
Middle West have also organized a
similar association. The winner of the
j contest in Chicago will go to New York
to participate in this year's contest on
March 3.
The Stanford Glee Club will leave
the campus on March 23 for Los An
geles, and will stop off at Carmel,
Salinas, Santa Barbara, and several
other cities for concerts.
The club will sing in its first campus
concert of the year in the Assembly
Hall March IG, and at this time stu
dents will be given an opportunity to
judge Stanford's representative in the
Los Angeles competition.
Arnold Bayley, '23, president of the
Stanford organization, reports a more
active interest than usual in the club
this year. Sixty were present at. the
recent initiation of thirty-six new mem
bers in the Stanford Union.
