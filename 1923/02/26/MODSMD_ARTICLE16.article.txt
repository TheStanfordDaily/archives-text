# BIRD-HOUSES WILL BE PLACED IN ARBORETUM
## 
### 
A number of bird-houses arc being |
placed in different sections of the arbor
itum by members of Professor Snyder'*
bird class for purposes of observation.
Records will be kept as to what part;- of
the arboritum the birds prefer in taking
up new lodgings, and as to whether they
desire to live near the ground or high
in the trees.
Because fires several years ago cleared
out much of the underbrush, the number
of birds has been decreased considerably.
In former days the aboritum was quite
a game refuge and was known to con
tain many different broods of birds, in
cluding some rare species. The thickets
now left in the arboritum are quite thick
ly inhabited.
