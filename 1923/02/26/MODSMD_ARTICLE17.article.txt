Stanford has captured many tennis
laurels in the past few years and this
trip would he one step above anything
that has yet been attempted by Card
inal tennis players.
Two years ago Stanford's tennis
team of Jimmy Davies and Phil Ne«r
were Bent back to the national inter
collegiate matches where Neer suc
ceeded in annexing the national singles
title. At the same time he was elected
president of the National Intercollegi
ate Tennis Association.
Last year the Stanford tennis team
again took the eastern trip to defend
the laurels which they had won the
year before. Neer was able to win the
intercollegiate doubles crown of the
United States for Stanford. Neer was
again elected president of the inter
collegiate tennis body.
Davies and Neer are not ineligible
for Pacific Coast collegiate competition
but they are eligible to play in the
Eastern tourneys. Davies' game seems
to be going better than viver and he
may improve this year on all his rec
ords. Last season he won the San
Francisco singles from Wallace Hates
of the University of California and in
the Ojai tournaments he captured the
California state intercollegiate single?
title. Phil Neer is not at the University
this quarter but he will return with the
opening of the spring term.
Dick Hinckley, who captains the
Stanford team this year, and Ted Mertz
have been working hard since the be
ginning of the year. According to
Davies, who is watching their work,
they will be fifty per cent stronger
than last year. They may also be given
an opportunity to take the eastern trip
this year in order to gain experience
in tournament play on grass courts.
While the team is in the East it will
enter the national intercollegiate sin
gles and doubles tournaments, and
Neer and Davies will have an oppor
tunity to defend the honors which they
have won during the past two years.
