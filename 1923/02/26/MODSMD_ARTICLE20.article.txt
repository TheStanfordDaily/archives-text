# PROVINCIALISM
## 
### 
Among the most popular attacks made upon col
lege students is that of provincialism. We are ac
cused of living- a thoroughly exclusive, self-centered
life in total ignorance of what is going on in the rest
of the world We are told that we don't form the habit
of connecting the significance of what we learn and
do at college with events and movements outside our
immediate sphere. Oitr prospects for winning the
conference basketball title overshadowed every other
topic of conversation of the last few weeks. At that,
there is a certain sanity in dealing with things im
mediately within our power to affect, but we can at
least acquire a basis of knowledge for use when the
scope of our activity broadens.
Stanford, more than many other universities, is
open to such criticism because of its size, location
and natural self-sufficiency.
For those who want to overcome that provincial
ism, the National Student I r orum provides an excel
lent medium. There exists in Europe today a well
defined youth movement —a movement on the part
of the students in directions of social and political
activity. In order that American students may be
come acquainted with the idealism and the awaken
ing sense of responsibility of the students of Europe,
the National Student Forum has brought six of the
student leaders to America. The Stanford Student
Forum has succeeded in bringing three of these men
■here this week.
