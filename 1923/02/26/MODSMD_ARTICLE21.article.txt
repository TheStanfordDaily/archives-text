# KEY DOWN!
## 
### 
An hour in any ot' the campus living groups almost
any night would lead the outsider to believe that the
student body was one vast bundle of nerves, strained
to the point of breaking at the sound of a shoe
dropped on the floor above. Orders to "key down"
in varying degrees of insistence issue from all quar
ters upon the slightest provocation.
As long as the objection to extraneous noises re
mains verbal, all is well. For the offender can come
hack with an appropriate retort, of a nature that can
not be reproduced here, and go about his business or
pleasure as before.
But when some poor overwrought student becomes
so annoyed that he must resort to other means—it is
time to remind him that his life will be an unpleasant
■one indeed if he expects to go through the world
commanding silence and respect at the mere utter
ance of a lusty "key down."
There is such a deal of inconsistency about it all.
There is one group in the Union that becomes indig
nant to the point of absurdity whenever sounds of
an incoming party reach its ears in the late hours of
the night. Yet that same group can get together every
evening and argue with increasing heat, oratory and
vehemence over some scholastic matter or can arise
in the early hours of a Saturday and run about the
halls shouting cheery "good mornings" and slam
ming doors. Perhaps they have the defense that they
arc spending their time in a more worth while man
ner. Does that make their racket more pleasant to
the car? It's all in the point of view.
It would be ideal if all the rest of the world wanted
quiet at just the time we did or if there were certain
hours when hilarity was welcomed by all. But since
that isn't the case, it's mighty good practice to train
our oversensitive nerves to a certain callousness.
Some day we may have to go home from a busy day
at the office to three or four squealing babies —and
infanticide is not encouraged in America.
