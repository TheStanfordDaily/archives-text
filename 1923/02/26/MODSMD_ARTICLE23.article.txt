A NARROW ESCAPE
The night was peaceful and still. Nature's beacons,
the stars, had come out, and winked at me as I strolled
down the tracks of the S. P. toward Menlo. Off to the
right a dog howled furiously; off to the left car after
car whizzed past in a blaze of light, bearing their occu
pants to dinners, and dances, and weddings, and —well,
you know where people go as well as I do.
Ahead of me I heard the whistle of a train. Looking
up, I saw the glimmer of the headlight; the Iron monster
was rushing down upon me, dragging its train of cars.
Suddenly my eye lit upon a beam lying across the track,
squarely in front of the approaching train. It tried to
move it. . . it wouldn't budge. I exerted all my power
. . . still I couldn't remove the beam before the train got
there.
I dashed off to one side, leaving the beam lying there
. . . my safety. . . I saw, in my mind, the wreck. . . the
cars with their precious humans crumpel in a heap.
The train came nearer. .. It struck the beam.. .
passed on without a scratch. . . miraculous? Well, not
exactly: it was a moonbeam! —P. K. R.

the stars, had come out, and winked at me as I strolled
down the tracks of the S. P. toward Menlo. Off to the
right a dog howled furiously; off to the left car after
car whizzed past in a blaze of light, bearing their occu
pants to dinners, and dances, and weddings, and —well,
you know where people go as well as I do.
Ahead of me I heard the whistle of a train. Looking
up, I saw the glimmer of the headlight; the Iron monster
was rushing down upon me, dragging its train of cars.
Suddenly my eye lit upon a beam lying across the track,
squarely in front of the approaching train. It tried to
move it. . . it wouldn't budge. I exerted all my power
. . . still I couldn't remove the beam before the train got
there.
I dashed off to one side, leaving the beam lying there
. . . my safety. . . I saw, in my mind, the wreck. . . the
cars with their precious humans crumpel in a heap.
The train came nearer. .. It struck the beam.. .
passed on without a scratch. . . miraculous? Well, not
exactly: it was a moonbeam! —P. K. R.

A NARROW ESCAPE
The night was peaceful and still. Nature's beacons,
the stars, had come out, and winked at me as I strolled
down the tracks of the S. P. toward Menlo. Off to the
right a dog howled furiously; off to the left car after
car whizzed past in a blaze of light, bearing their occu
pants to dinners, and dances, and weddings, and —well,
you know where people go as well as I do.
Ahead of me I heard the whistle of a train. Looking
up, I saw the glimmer of the headlight; the Iron monster
was rushing down upon me, dragging its train of cars.
Suddenly my eye lit upon a beam lying across the track,
squarely in front of the approaching train. It tried to
move it. . . it wouldn't budge. I exerted all my power
. . . still I couldn't remove the beam before the train got
there.
I dashed off to one side, leaving the beam lying there
. . . my safety. . . I saw, in my mind, the wreck. . . the
cars with their precious humans crumpel in a heap.
