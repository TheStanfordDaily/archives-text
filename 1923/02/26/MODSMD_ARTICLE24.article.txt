CENSOR AND CENSORED
It's hard to tell who gets the most fun out of it and it's
harder still to tell who gets any good out of it. We
refer to the squabble between the censor and the cen
sored. The censor, happy in the smug security of his
own self-righteousness, swings his ax at the censored,
who blithely dodges the ax, thumbs his nose and sets
the whole mob laughing at the ax-wielder. Nothing has
been accomplished, but the multitudes have been enter
tained and a good time has been had by all.
For instance, there is the apparently irrepressible feud
on the University of California between "The Laughing
Horse" coteries and the regents, supported by a number
of women's organizations and clubs. Every new out
break of the row is good for half a column or more in
the San Francisco papers—good reading, too. The latest
bout seems to have been won by the outragers of de
cency. Charles Vildrac, French playwright and author
of "S. S. Tenacity," recently banned from Wheeler Hall,
has his little say through the gay "Laughing Horse."
And because Vildrac is French and doesn't care what
happens to him now anyhow, he waxes trenchantly ironi
cal at the expense of the regents. When he is done
with them the regents are nothing more than very
stupid, very foul-minded hypocrites. And Vildrac is
very happy; one can hear his sardonic merriment back
of the laughter of the laughing horse.
But the regents will probably be up and about their
business as usual tomorrow. And the various clubs and
associations will survive their chastisement and be out
sharpening the good old ax in a few days for the next
victim. The public waits.
Meanwhile, however, art suffers. Whether it suffers
more from censoring of the puritanical or from the out
bursts of the writers who adore shocking these same
puritans, it is hard to say. Certainly the flames of
rebellion are fanned to new fury by these same censors.
Writers who never cared much about the risque or the
overly virile are impelled to try it out a bit "just to see
what the old fogies will do." The "old fogies" react
true to type and the experimental young writer has be
come all of a sudden a martyr to Art. He has a
following and represents a Cause. Thus more impure
work is turned out, not for the sake of presenting life,
truth, beauty or reality, but merely to confound the
censor.
Again public decency is outraged; again there is an
outburst of indignation; again the rebel, having less to
lose, thumbs his nose at the puritan, gets the crowd on
his side, and goes off to write more garbage.
And in the meantime, as the funny pictures say, Art
in her garret or studio, goes 011 in her own way, quite
oblivious of the commotion around her effigy.— (Palo
