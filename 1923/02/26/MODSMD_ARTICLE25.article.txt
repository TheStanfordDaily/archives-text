Editor, Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: It is with a small amount
of amusement and a great deal of disgust
that I have viewed the discussion ap
pearing on page two of your sheet, re
garding the merits and drawbacks of the
recent Ram's Head show.
In the first place, the so-called criticism
which was relegated to a place of minor
prominence in Monday's Daily was not
diat at all. It was a poor attempt by a
very immature young man to give the
campus something which should at the
same time be funny and cutting; the
result was ghastly, to say the least. In
the first place, he failed in the very es
sence of dramatic criticism: he forgot
to mention the show more than once or
twice; he said nothing of the work of
the characters; his exposition of the plot
was as puerile as it was laughable.
Perhaps the show did not come up to
the dramatic tastes of Mr. Rorke; but
because of that the whole campus should
not have to suffer the wave of discus
sion that has followed his vicious and, at
the same time child-like, attack on the
efforts of a considerable number of
people.
What your paper needs, dear editor,
and what the paper of the last and la
mented Mr. Irwin needed, is a less criti
cal attitude in general and a return, if
possible with the limited talents of which
your staff at present boasts, to the simple
i style of presenting news in readable form.
I Leave out the half-baked criticisms, the
j sorry attempts at mimic cynicism, and
| give the campus news that is not hoary
| with age and crippled with typographical
errors. !
In accord with the latest innovation in
your sheet, 1 am not going to step out
in the open places of public gaze, but
will merely sign myself,
Your sincere admirer,
A. B. Z., '28.
P. S.—Nor is my desire to burst forth
under a tile "Ho, Hum," or similar in
anity. You have not the privilege of soil
ing this letter by smearing it in your
sheet.

zmirratit the "smearing.")
Editor, Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: It is with a small amount
of amusement and a great deal of disgust
that I have viewed the discussion ap
pearing on page two of your sheet, re
garding the merits and drawbacks of the
recent Ram's Head show.
In the first place, the so-called criticism
which was relegated to a place of minor
prominence in Monday's Daily was not
diat at all. It was a poor attempt by a
very immature young man to give the
campus something which should at the
same time be funny and cutting; the
result was ghastly, to say the least. In
the first place, he failed in the very es
sence of dramatic criticism: he forgot
to mention the show more than once or
twice; he said nothing of the work of
the characters; his exposition of the plot
was as puerile as it was laughable.
Perhaps the show did not come up to
the dramatic tastes of Mr. Rorke; but
because of that the whole campus should
not have to suffer the wave of discus
sion that has followed his vicious and, at
the same time child-like, attack on the
efforts of a considerable number of
people.
What your paper needs, dear editor,
and what the paper of the last and la
mented Mr. Irwin needed, is a less criti
cal attitude in general and a return, if
possible with the limited talents of which
your staff at present boasts, to the simple
i style of presenting news in readable form.
I Leave out the half-baked criticisms, the
j sorry attempts at mimic cynicism, and
| give the campus news that is not hoary
| with age and crippled with typographical
errors. !
In accord with the latest innovation in
your sheet, 1 am not going to step out
in the open places of public gaze, but
will merely sign myself,
Your sincere admirer,
A. B. Z., '28.
