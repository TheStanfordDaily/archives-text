# That Joke Again
## 
### 
Editor I). P. A.
It is unfortunate that the editor of
Chaparral has found himself in the po
sition of "explainer" or "apologizer" for
lines which/were printed in that magazine
and which were subsequently "smeared."
It is unfortunate, also, that the news
of this episode should be printed in news
papers other than the campus daily.
However, it is particularly unfortunate
that the editor of Chaparral should have
to admit that he had put out a magazine,
the copy in which be had not read until
the book was bound and ready for dis
tribution.
Further, it is unfortunate that the edi
tor should have "smeared" the alleged
joke so lightly that, in the words of an
acquaintance. "I didn't even have to hold
the page to the light to read it."
I am glad that neither Chaparral nor
Hammer and Coffin submits to external
censorship and that "any surplus ink on
its pages is there at the direction of the
editor and no one else." However —to
repeat —it is unfortunate that the present
editor could not have been careful
enough to prevent the printing of the
"joke" in question, and the subsequent
discussions concerning it.
If the editor expects to keep the name
of his fair publication out of the col
umns of outside newspapers, lie would
do wise to exercise a little more care in
clipping from his exchanges. As for off
campus correspondents, he will lind them
willing enough to co-operate with him.
