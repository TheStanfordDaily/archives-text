# SHEEP WILL CELEBRATE ANNIVERSARY OF ARRIVAL
## 
### 
The eleventh anniversary of the com
ing of Stanford's flock of sheep will soon
be here, according to Sam Mac Donald,
caretaker of the athletic grounds. The
first of the woolly "animated lawn
mowers" appeared on the campus in the
spring of 1912, when the athletic board,
hoping to save expense in the upkeep of
the grounds, purchased fifteen head as an
experiment.
The sheep proved so efficient in keep
ing the grass down, and thereby saving
labor on the grounds, that their number
was soon increased. When more fields
and lawns were available for "mowing,"
a sherpherd and some dogs were secured
and the size of the flock was doubled.
The shepherd, William McCollough,
has been with the flock many years.
"Billy," as he is known to Stanford peo
ple who have lived here since the early
days of the University, came here in
the late Ws, He drove a milk wagon

around the campus and so became ac
quainted with many families here, in
Menlo Park, and in Palo Alto. Oc
casionally a limousine may be seen to
come to a stop beside the flock while an
it grazes on the lawns, and some old
alumnus climbs out and talks over the
good old days with "Billy."
Four black sheep dogs assist "Billy"
in guiding his fold around the pastures
of the "Farm" and prevent them from
straying into the paths of student "cut
downs" and "coups." The dogs have
been here nearly as long as the sheep,
and know the flock almost as well as
does "Billy."
In former days the flock was more in
timately associated with athletics than
it is now. It got its daily "workouts" on
the old rugby, baseball, and soccer turfs,
and under the goalposts was relieved of
its wool, which was then stored in a
room of the old training house. Several
times each year a few of the young
ones were "sacrificed" at athletic barbe
cues.
In late years the sheep have been seen
more upon the campus, due to the in
crease of territory over which they can
range. Once every year on Stanford
Labor Day, when men and women give
Convalescent Home its annual "spring
cleaning," a few of the lambs are slaugh
tered and roasted in open pits on the
grounds of the old Stanford home.
The flock was large in the war-time,
when the grazing territory was even
more extensive than it is now. For sev
eral years 500 bead of the nibblers were
kept on the job. About 250 head are
kept in stock now.
The yield of. wool is not very great,
but with its sale and the sale of the
lambs each year, the flock is able to earn
more than its mere "board and keep."
An average age of four years is main
tained. Each year some of the oldest
ones and some of the lambs are sold.
Middleagcd sheep seem to prove best
adapted to steady "mowing."

but with its sale and the sale of the
lambs each year, the flock is able to earn
more than its mere "board and keep."
An average age of four years is main
tained. Each year some of the oldest
ones and some of the lambs are sold.
Middleagcd sheep seem to prove best
adapted to steady "mowing."
The eleventh anniversary of the com
ing of Stanford's flock of sheep will soon
be here, according to Sam Mac Donald,
caretaker of the athletic grounds. The
first of the woolly "animated lawn
mowers" appeared on the campus in the
spring of 1912, when the athletic board,
hoping to save expense in the upkeep of
the grounds, purchased fifteen head as an
experiment.
The sheep proved so efficient in keep
ing the grass down, and thereby saving
labor on the grounds, that their number
was soon increased. When more fields
and lawns were available for "mowing,"
a sherpherd and some dogs were secured
and the size of the flock was doubled.
The shepherd, William McCollough,
has been with the flock many years.
"Billy," as he is known to Stanford peo
ple who have lived here since the early
days of the University, came here in
the late Ws, He drove a milk wagon

around the campus and so became ac
quainted with many families here, in
Menlo Park, and in Palo Alto. Oc
casionally a limousine may be seen to
come to a stop beside the flock while an
it grazes on the lawns, and some old
alumnus climbs out and talks over the
good old days with "Billy."
Four black sheep dogs assist "Billy"
in guiding his fold around the pastures
of the "Farm" and prevent them from
straying into the paths of student "cut
downs" and "coups." The dogs have
been here nearly as long as the sheep,
and know the flock almost as well as
does "Billy."
In former days the flock was more in
timately associated with athletics than
it is now. It got its daily "workouts" on
the old rugby, baseball, and soccer turfs,
and under the goalposts was relieved of
its wool, which was then stored in a
room of the old training house. Several
times each year a few of the young
ones were "sacrificed" at athletic barbe
cues.
In late years the sheep have been seen
more upon the campus, due to the in
crease of territory over which they can
range. Once every year on Stanford
Labor Day, when men and women give
Convalescent Home its annual "spring
cleaning," a few of the lambs are slaugh
tered and roasted in open pits on the
grounds of the old Stanford home.
The flock was large in the war-time,
when the grazing territory was even
more extensive than it is now. For sev
eral years 500 bead of the nibblers were
kept on the job. About 250 head are
kept in stock now.
The yield of. wool is not very great,
but with its sale and the sale of the
lambs each year, the flock is able to earn
more than its mere "board and keep."
An average age of four years is main
tained. Each year some of the oldest
