# STANFORD TRACKMEN MAKE FAST TIMES IN INFORMAL MEET
## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton sent his track pro
teges through their last weekly informal
meet of the quarter Saturday morning
on the Stanford track.
The Cardinal tracksters are fast round
ing into shape and both the varsity and
freshman teams should he in good con
dition for the opening of the season on
March 14. The Irish Marathon and the
holdover show arc scheduled for next
Saturday, and a week later comes the
interclass meet.
Williamson and Van Judah ran a dead
heat in the quarter-mile event in 51 :1
seconds. Judah uncorked a sprint as he
came down the straightaway, and nearly
breasted the tape ahead of Williamson.
Harold Boles of the freshman team
ran the 120 high hurdles in 15:1 seconds,
beating both Falk and Leistner to the
finish line.
In the pole vault Guy Dennis won with
a vault of 12 feet. Dennis seems to be
getting his old form back and lie should
be clearing 12 feet 6 inches before long.
