# FIRST INTERCLASS BASEBALL GAME IS SCHEDULED MARCH 1
## 
### 
With the first interclass baseball game
scheduled for Thursday, the freshmen
j would seem to have the best chance for
j winning the fourth interclass sport. No
other class save the sophomores have had
any practice whatsoever, and the upper
| classes cannot expect to step in and take
j the baseball title without any preparation
as the seniors copped the basketball.
All men who have not made a varsity
"S" in baseball will be eligible for par
ticipation in the interclass games. The
j freshmen, thereforme, will use the same
team which will go up against Califor
nia, and which has been practicing for
lover a month. Each team will play each
J other, the games following closely after
| March 1.
Class managers which have been ap
pointed so far arc Eckhoff, freshmen;
'Gertmenian, sophomores,- and Pollard,
; seniors. Seniors will use the field by the
j faculty clubhouse, the juniors the field
back of the track, the sophomores the
I field where the bonfire was built, and the
| freshmen will practice, as usual, on their
regular field.
Facilities for practice and games are
adequate. Equipment can he obtained
by signing up for it at the Encina store.
Men will he allowed to transfer from
gym classes to baseball and receive
credit.
Baseball is the fourth of the seven
sports to be taken up under the new
system of interclass athletics. No class
is far enough ahead in the race for the
numerals on the trophy this year, but
that baseball could materially change the
standing.
