## 
### 
Proving to lie in a class by themselves,
Stanford's water polo varsity succeeded
in trimming a team of San Francisco
all stars, 3-1, Saturday afternoon in En
cina pool. The visitors fought hard, but
could not cope with the baffling defense
and brilliant passing of the Cardinal
seven. Half-time found Stanford lead
ing, 1-0.
With more accurate goal-shooting, and
an equal passing and guarding game, the
Stanford paddlers should prove an im
portant factor in the national senior
championships at Chicago in April. Had
the Stanford forwards been able to find
the Gfoal with more accuracy Saturday, a
much higher score would have been
rolled up. As it was, the varsity had
to rely on their passing game, which was
sparkling at all stages of the contest.
Fletcher accounted for two of Stan
ford's points, one from a penalty throw.
The other point was scored by O'Con
nor. Brevick made the lone tally for
the visitors.
The Stanford men dribbled cleverly,
keeping the ball tfith apparent east. They
were able to keep the sphere at their op
ponents' end of the tank for tre major
portion of the game. Coach Brandsten's
men should have but little trouble with
their remaining games on the coasts,
which will be with an all-star beach
team, and the California varsity.
The line-ups follow: San Francisco
AlllStars, Luster, Bond, and Brevick,
forwards; Gardner, Resleur, and Smith,
