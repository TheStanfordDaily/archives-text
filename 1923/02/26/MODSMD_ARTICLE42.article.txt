# FRESHMEN NINE WINS FROM RICHMOND 9-0
## 
### 
The Card first-year nine chalked up
their third shutout of the season when
they blanked the Richmond High School
team, 9 to 0, in a slow, uninteresting
game on the freshman field last Satur
day afternoon.
The Babes weren't playing up to true
form Saturday. They allowed the lanky
Richmond pitcher to save his arm for
five innings before they pounded his slow
curve ball beyond reach of the Richmond
infield.
Only the consistent hurling of Tod
Oviatt kept Richmond from scoring in
the first few frames. Oviatt kept the
hits well scattered until the seventh in
ning, when the Preps put three men on
bases after a walk, an error and a hit.
Good fielding by Lucas and Lovelace
pulled the Babes out of what began to
look like a tight hole.
The "flu" and low scholarship were the
causes of many shifts in the freshman
line-up. McDermont was substituted for
Johnny Kohlcr behind the mask. Barney
Dickey was put in left field, and George
Lane played the right field gardens due
to the absence of Aydelotte in center.
This had quite a noticeable effect on the
usual confidence displayed by the squad.
The pitching of Oviatt last Saturday
makes it possible for Coach "Husky"
Hunt to rely on him to spell Ditzler and
Nevers occasionally. McDermont looked
like a veteran behind the plate, and the
work of this pair begins to assure a
comparatively strong battery for future
contests.
