### 
Repair work has been recently com

small bungalow located on the San Fran
ciscito Creek, a half-mile cast of Sears
ville Lake. The house, which was built
by the zoology faculty and student in
1916, is a large one-room building con

furniture.
The Zoology Club went 'on a picnic
to the station on Washington's birthday
and had supper in the house.
