# IRELANDS DEFEAT VARSITY NINE IN FOURTEEN INNINGS
## Lowenstein Yields Four Hits in Fifth Additional Frame; Independent Attack Strong 
### William Wright, '25 
Cliff Ireland beat the Varsity again
Saturday, 6 to 4, but it necessitated
five innings of overtime and a batting
attack which beat anything seen here
this season. Two triples and a double i
intermingled with twelve one-base \
blows, ought to win any tight game; j
and the game Saturday was so tight !
that it squeaked. The Cardinals were
not far behind, with twelve bingles,
but they failed to come at the most
opportune moments. This is the second j
game Cliff has taken out of the three
game series.
The Irelands went down without a
murmur in the opening round, and
Stanford wasted two hits when the last'
two men were unable to come through I
with Mulachy and Heckendorf on third j
and second. In the next tilt the Cards
scored. McCandless singled over sec- J
ond and took the bag when Peavy was
safe on Ireland's bobble. Patterson 1
drew a walk, filling the paths. Reppy (
then uncorked a wild heave which
eased McCandless across the rubber,!
but Peavy stopped between third and
home to think things out and was
lopped off at the plate by j. narrow
margin. Patterson was left on third, the
next two men being easy outs.
"This is going to be a short inning
—we'll break a world's record," said
Cliff, as he trotted out for the third
bout. Whereupon Woodward bingled j
over short and rode to third on Heck
endorf's blow, the latter taking sec
ond on the throw-in. Carver annexed
the third hit of the inning, and drove
Woodward over the pan. Deffebach
popped to Ratner, but McCandless
bounced a hit over Montague's head
and Heckendorf and Carper rang in at
the plate. Roberts, who had gone in
for Peavy, drew a pass, but was forced
at second by Patterson. Teague for
once in his life whiffed and ended the
inning. Stanford 4, Irelands 0.
The Cards were through and the
Independents hadn't started yet. They
did, though, in the fourth episode.,
Koenig led off by beating out a slow
roller to Roberts. Reppy, who felt his
game slipping away from him, assault
ed one of Teague's shoots for a total
of three bases, Koenig trotting across
the Holy of Holies. Ireland reached
first on an error by Heckendorf, scor
ing Reppy. Montague went out, Rob
erts to Woodward. Valla, with two
men out, soaked another three-ply wal
lop to right, but expired on third when
Stalker weakly trundled the ball to
Teague.
Teague was weakening, and walked
Burmeister, who was cut down in a
double killing on Reams' grounder,
Mulchay to Roberts to Woodward. Rat
ner was hit by a pitched ball and
scored when Koenig and Reppy singled
in rapid succession. "Cliff" ended the
scoring by flying to McCandless.
The Irelands tied the score up in
the eighth. Kearns lifted a blow into
short left field, which dropped for a
hit when Mulchay and Deffenbach
staged the Gaston-Alphonse act. Rat
ner bunted him to second and Mulchay
perpetrated a boot which left him on
third and allowed Koenig to reach the
initial station. Reppy was hit by Solo
mon, who had replaced Teague. Wtih
the bases packed and one down,
"Cliff" poked a slow one at Hecken
dorf, who threw to the plate and forced
Kearns out. Montague then singled,
scoring Koenig.
With the exception of the twelfth,
when the Irelands went down one-two
three, both teams put men on the
paths in each of the extra innings; but
although the bases were filled twice
the necessary punch was lacking. In
the fourteenth, Lowenstein displaced
Solomon on the mound and the trouble
began. Koenig lined a single to left,
but was retired at second on an at
tempted sa«rifice by Reppy, who was
safe on the fielder's choice. "Cliff"
flied out to center. Montague singled
to center, Valla got a scratch hit into
deep short, and Stalker doubled. Ire
lands 6, Stanford 4.
"Take this string, they might tie it
up," said "Cliff," bu the Cards were
beaten. Woodward stopped a pitched
ball with his elbow, but two flies and
a strike-out closed the afternoon with
the home team lagging.
Koenig, of the St. Paul American
Association team, clicked out five safe
blows In seven trips to the plate, and
Kearns connected for three out of six.
McCandless, with a double and two
singles out of six tries, led the Card
inal attack, and also managed five high
ones out in center field.

popped to Ratner, but McCandless
bounced a hit over Montague's head
and Heckendorf and Carper rang in at
the plate. Roberts, who had gone in
for Peavy, drew a pass, but was forced
at second by Patterson. Teague for
once in his life whiffed and ended the
inning. Stanford 4, Irelands 0.
The Cards were through and the
Independents hadn't started yet. They
did, though, in the fourth episode.,
Koenig led off by beating out a slow
roller to Roberts. Reppy, who felt his
game slipping away from him, assault
ed one of Teague's shoots for a total
of three bases, Koenig trotting across
the Holy of Holies. Ireland reached
first on an error by Heckendorf, scor
ing Reppy. Montague went out, Rob
erts to Woodward. Valla, with two
men out, soaked another three-ply wal
lop to right, but expired on third when
Stalker weakly trundled the ball to
Teague.
Teague was weakening, and walked
Burmeister, who was cut down in a
double killing on Reams' grounder,
Mulchay to Roberts to Woodward. Rat
ner was hit by a pitched ball and
scored when Koenig and Reppy singled
in rapid succession. "Cliff" ended the
scoring by flying to McCandless.
The Irelands tied the score up in
the eighth. Kearns lifted a blow into
short left field, which dropped for a
hit when Mulchay and Deffenbach
staged the Gaston-Alphonse act. Rat
ner bunted him to second and Mulchay
perpetrated a boot which left him on
third and allowed Koenig to reach the
initial station. Reppy was hit by Solo
mon, who had replaced Teague. Wtih
the bases packed and one down,
"Cliff" poked a slow one at Hecken
dorf, who threw to the plate and forced
Kearns out. Montague then singled,
scoring Koenig.
With the exception of the twelfth,
when the Irelands went down one-two
three, both teams put men on the
paths in each of the extra innings; but
although the bases were filled twice
the necessary punch was lacking. In
the fourteenth, Lowenstein displaced
Solomon on the mound and the trouble
began. Koenig lined a single to left,
but was retired at second on an at
tempted sa«rifice by Reppy, who was
safe on the fielder's choice. "Cliff"
flied out to center. Montague singled
to center, Valla got a scratch hit into
deep short, and Stalker doubled. Ire
lands 6, Stanford 4.
"Take this string, they might tie it
up," said "Cliff," bu the Cards were
beaten. Woodward stopped a pitched
ball with his elbow, but two flies and
a strike-out closed the afternoon with
the home team lagging.
Koenig, of the St. Paul American
Association team, clicked out five safe
blows In seven trips to the plate, and
Kearns connected for three out of six.
McCandless, with a double and two
singles out of six tries, led the Card
inal attack, and also managed five high
ones out in center field.

Cliff Ireland beat the Varsity again
Saturday, 6 to 4, but it necessitated
five innings of overtime and a batting
attack which beat anything seen here
this season. Two triples and a double i
intermingled with twelve one-base \
blows, ought to win any tight game; j
and the game Saturday was so tight !
that it squeaked. The Cardinals were
not far behind, with twelve bingles,
but they failed to come at the most
opportune moments. This is the second j
game Cliff has taken out of the three
game series.
The Irelands went down without a
murmur in the opening round, and
Stanford wasted two hits when the last'
two men were unable to come through I
with Mulachy and Heckendorf on third j
and second. In the next tilt the Cards
scored. McCandless singled over sec- J
ond and took the bag when Peavy was
safe on Ireland's bobble. Patterson 1
drew a walk, filling the paths. Reppy (
then uncorked a wild heave which
eased McCandless across the rubber,!
but Peavy stopped between third and
home to think things out and was
lopped off at the plate by j. narrow
margin. Patterson was left on third, the
next two men being easy outs.
"This is going to be a short inning
—we'll break a world's record," said
Cliff, as he trotted out for the third
bout. Whereupon Woodward bingled j
over short and rode to third on Heck
endorf's blow, the latter taking sec
ond on the throw-in. Carver annexed

Cliff Ireland beat the Varsity again
Saturday, 6 to 4, but it necessitated
five innings of overtime and a batting
attack which beat anything seen here
this season. Two triples and a double i
intermingled with twelve one-base \
blows, ought to win any tight game; j
and the game Saturday was so tight !
that it squeaked. The Cardinals were
not far behind, with twelve bingles,
but they failed to come at the most
opportune moments. This is the second j
game Cliff has taken out of the three
game series.
The Irelands went down without a
murmur in the opening round, and
Stanford wasted two hits when the last'
two men were unable to come through I
with Mulachy and Heckendorf on third j
and second. In the next tilt the Cards
scored. McCandless singled over sec- J
ond and took the bag when Peavy was
safe on Ireland's bobble. Patterson 1
drew a walk, filling the paths. Reppy (
then uncorked a wild heave which
eased McCandless across the rubber,!
but Peavy stopped between third and
home to think things out and was
lopped off at the plate by j. narrow
margin. Patterson was left on third, the
next two men being easy outs.
"This is going to be a short inning
—we'll break a world's record," said
Cliff, as he trotted out for the third
bout. Whereupon Woodward bingled j
over short and rode to third on Heck
endorf's blow, the latter taking sec
ond on the throw-in. Carver annexed
the third hit of the inning, and drove
Woodward over the pan. Deffebach
popped to Ratner, but McCandless
bounced a hit over Montague's head
and Heckendorf and Carper rang in at
the plate. Roberts, who had gone in
for Peavy, drew a pass, but was forced
at second by Patterson. Teague for
once in his life whiffed and ended the
inning. Stanford 4, Irelands 0.
The Cards were through and the
Independents hadn't started yet. They
did, though, in the fourth episode.,
Koenig led off by beating out a slow
roller to Roberts. Reppy, who felt his
game slipping away from him, assault
ed one of Teague's shoots for a total
of three bases, Koenig trotting across
the Holy of Holies. Ireland reached
first on an error by Heckendorf, scor
ing Reppy. Montague went out, Rob
erts to Woodward. Valla, with two
men out, soaked another three-ply wal
lop to right, but expired on third when
Stalker weakly trundled the ball to
Teague.
Teague was weakening, and walked
Burmeister, who was cut down in a
double killing on Reams' grounder,
Mulchay to Roberts to Woodward. Rat
ner was hit by a pitched ball and
scored when Koenig and Reppy singled
in rapid succession. "Cliff" ended the
scoring by flying to McCandless.
The Irelands tied the score up in
the eighth. Kearns lifted a blow into
short left field, which dropped for a
hit when Mulchay and Deffenbach
staged the Gaston-Alphonse act. Rat
ner bunted him to second and Mulchay
perpetrated a boot which left him on
third and allowed Koenig to reach the
initial station. Reppy was hit by Solo
mon, who had replaced Teague. Wtih

Cliff Ireland beat the Varsity again
Saturday, 6 to 4, but it necessitated
five innings of overtime and a batting
attack which beat anything seen here
this season. Two triples and a double i
intermingled with twelve one-base \
blows, ought to win any tight game; j
and the game Saturday was so tight !
that it squeaked. The Cardinals were
not far behind, with twelve bingles,
but they failed to come at the most
opportune moments. This is the second j
game Cliff has taken out of the three
game series.
The Irelands went down without a
murmur in the opening round, and
Stanford wasted two hits when the last'
two men were unable to come through I
with Mulachy and Heckendorf on third j
and second. In the next tilt the Cards
scored. McCandless singled over sec- J
ond and took the bag when Peavy was
safe on Ireland's bobble. Patterson 1
drew a walk, filling the paths. Reppy (
then uncorked a wild heave which
eased McCandless across the rubber,!
but Peavy stopped between third and
home to think things out and was
lopped off at the plate by j. narrow
margin. Patterson was left on third, the
next two men being easy outs.
"This is going to be a short inning
—we'll break a world's record," said
Cliff, as he trotted out for the third
bout. Whereupon Woodward bingled j
over short and rode to third on Heck
endorf's blow, the latter taking sec
ond on the throw-in. Carver annexed
the third hit of the inning, and drove
Woodward over the pan. Deffebach
popped to Ratner, but McCandless
bounced a hit over Montague's head
and Heckendorf and Carper rang in at
the plate. Roberts, who had gone in
for Peavy, drew a pass, but was forced
at second by Patterson. Teague for
once in his life whiffed and ended the
inning. Stanford 4, Irelands 0.
The Cards were through and the
Independents hadn't started yet. They
did, though, in the fourth episode.,
Koenig led off by beating out a slow
roller to Roberts. Reppy, who felt his
game slipping away from him, assault
ed one of Teague's shoots for a total
of three bases, Koenig trotting across
the Holy of Holies. Ireland reached
first on an error by Heckendorf, scor
ing Reppy. Montague went out, Rob
erts to Woodward. Valla, with two
men out, soaked another three-ply wal
lop to right, but expired on third when
Stalker weakly trundled the ball to
Teague.
Teague was weakening, and walked
Burmeister, who was cut down in a
double killing on Reams' grounder,
Mulchay to Roberts to Woodward. Rat
ner was hit by a pitched ball and
scored when Koenig and Reppy singled
in rapid succession. "Cliff" ended the
scoring by flying to McCandless.
The Irelands tied the score up in
the eighth. Kearns lifted a blow into
short left field, which dropped for a
hit when Mulchay and Deffenbach
staged the Gaston-Alphonse act. Rat
ner bunted him to second and Mulchay
perpetrated a boot which left him on
third and allowed Koenig to reach the
initial station. Reppy was hit by Solo
mon, who had replaced Teague. Wtih
the bases packed and one down,
"Cliff" poked a slow one at Hecken
dorf, who threw to the plate and forced
Kearns out. Montague then singled,
scoring Koenig.
With the exception of the twelfth,
when the Irelands went down one-two
three, both teams put men on the
paths in each of the extra innings; but
although the bases were filled twice
the necessary punch was lacking. In
the fourteenth, Lowenstein displaced
Solomon on the mound and the trouble
began. Koenig lined a single to left,
but was retired at second on an at
tempted sa«rifice by Reppy, who was
safe on the fielder's choice. "Cliff"
flied out to center. Montague singled
to center, Valla got a scratch hit into
deep short, and Stalker doubled. Ire
lands 6, Stanford 4.
"Take this string, they might tie it
up," said "Cliff," bu the Cards were
beaten. Woodward stopped a pitched
ball with his elbow, but two flies and
a strike-out closed the afternoon with
the home team lagging.
Koenig, of the St. Paul American
Association team, clicked out five safe
blows In seven trips to the plate, and
Kearns connected for three out of six.
McCandless, with a double and two
singles out of six tries, led the Card
inal attack, and also managed five high
ones out in center field.
