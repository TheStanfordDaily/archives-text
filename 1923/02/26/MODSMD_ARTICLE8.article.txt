# IRELANDS DEFEAT VARSITY NINE IN FOURTEEN INNINGS
## Lowenstein Yields Four Hits in Fifth Additional Frame; Independent Attack Strong 
### William Wright, '25 
Cliff Ireland beat the Varsity again
Saturday, 6 to 4, but it necessitated
five innings of overtime and a batting
attack which beat anything seen here
this season. Two triples and a double i
intermingled with twelve one-base \
blows, ought to win any tight game; j
and the game Saturday was so tight !
that it squeaked. The Cardinals were
not far behind, with twelve bingles,
but they failed to come at the most
opportune moments. This is the second j
game Cliff has taken out of the three
game series.
The Irelands went down without a
murmur in the opening round, and
Stanford wasted two hits when the last'
two men were unable to come through I
with Mulachy and Heckendorf on third j
and second. In the next tilt the Cards
scored. McCandless singled over sec- J
ond and took the bag when Peavy was
safe on Ireland's bobble. Patterson 1
drew a walk, filling the paths. Reppy (
then uncorked a wild heave which
eased McCandless across the rubber,!
but Peavy stopped between third and
home to think things out and was
lopped off at the plate by j. narrow
margin. Patterson was left on third, the
next two men being easy outs.
"This is going to be a short inning
—we'll break a world's record," said
Cliff, as he trotted out for the third
bout. Whereupon Woodward bingled j
over short and rode to third on Heck
endorf's blow, the latter taking sec
ond on the throw-in. Carver annexed
the third hit of the inning, and drove
Woodward over the pan. Deffebach
popped to Ratner, but McCandless
bounced a hit over Montague's head
and Heckendorf and Carper rang in at
the plate. Roberts, who had gone in
for Peavy, drew a pass, but was forced
at second by Patterson. Teague for
once in his life whiffed and ended the
inning. Stanford 4, Irelands 0.
The Cards were through and the
Independents hadn't started yet. They
did, though, in the fourth episode.,
Koenig led off by beating out a slow
roller to Roberts. Reppy, who felt his
game slipping away from him, assault
ed one of Teague's shoots for a total
of three bases, Koenig trotting across
