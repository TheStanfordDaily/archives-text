My Cousin Jane
Came to Visit
and I took her to Wilson's
for refreshments. "Helen,"
she whispered, "See that
perfectly wonderful man at
the candy counter. I wish
he were buying candy for
US!"
By merest chance, that
"wonderful man" was
Jack. He got a glimpse of
me and hurried over to our
table. Jack was buying the
box of Wilson's to take to
ME but of course he let
US have it to enjoy at the
matinee.
