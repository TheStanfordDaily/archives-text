# CARD NINE PLAYS INDEPENDENT TEAM HERE TOMORROW
## Cliff Ireland to Make Last Appearance in Third Game Against Stanford Varsity 
### 
Cliff Ireland, accompanied by half a!
score of ball players and his endless sup
ply of wit will invade the campus to
morrow afternoon for the third game of
the series with the Stanford varsity.
Cliff seems to have taken the Card;
nine's goat into custody for safe keep
ing. He has succeeded in hanging the!
Indian sign on Coach YVolter's team
twice within the last week and stands a i
pretty good chance of repeating again ;
tomorrow if the Cards play the same ;
listless brand of ball. Last Thursday!
the Independents won out by a 3-2 score !
in a game which Stanford should have
won easily. Saturday, the Cardinal i
sticekrs piled up a four-run lead in the j
early innings, but lost it on bad baseball!
and timely hitting by Cliff's aggregation.)
The game went fourteen innings, the In-1
dependents finally winning by a two-run !
margin.
Ireland will probably without the ser-j
vices of several of his l>est men tomor-1
row. Gene Valla, who played center field, !
will Ik- needed at the Seals' training camp j
as will Bert Ellison, who held down the
initial sack for Cliff in the game last
Wednesday.
Poor base running and errors at criti
cal times have been responsible for most
of the Cards' hard luck in the last few
games. The infield has showed flashes
of high-class baseball, but at times has !
performed miserably. The outfielders I
have been performing satisfactorily, with j
Carver making big league catches in I
nearly every game.
In the two games with Ireland's team,
the Card hatters have gathered enough
hits to win several ball games, but they j
don't seem able to deliver when hits
mean runs. The pitchers have been a
trifle erratic, but should settle down as j
the season advances.
Clark will probably get the call for
mound duty tomorrow and if he is right i
should prove a puzzle to Cliff's batters. 1
Cliff would like nothing better than to j
make a clean sweep of the Stanfordj
series, and the Cards would like to turn '
him back with a decisive defeat tomor- J
row, so the battle should be a good one. j
The game is scheduled to begin at 3 :30.
