# Ten Ton Trucks Will No Longer Use Palm Drive for a Race Track
## 
### 
A troop of girls dressed in knickers,
riding trousers, and flannel shirts,
dashed through the gates at the en
trance of Palm Drive and took the side
path that pleads through the grounds
to the convalescent home. The Univer
sity gardener paused in his work nf
scraping up dead leaves long enough
to watch them disappear from view.
Then he turned to the guard stationed
at the gate and said: "Those your boys
Ed?" "Yep," answered Ed, with a
smile, "and they're sure nice boys, too.
They don't carry guns and sling-shots
to pepper the squirrels and quail with."
However, the watchman at the end
of Palm Drive does not stand there
with his flag from 8 a. m. until 5 p. m.
to chase away small boys whose hunt
ing instincts have been aroused by the
possession of a new air gun. His main
purpose at the present time is to stop
all wayward and hurried trucks who
would use the drive for a speedway
and send them down the side road
which turns off the highway further
along towards San Jose. The one and
only exception to this being Ed. Lamb
in one of his fire wagons or other
University-owned truck.
Contrary to current rumors this

latest addition to the staff of campus
protectors is not in cahoots with the
speed cop and the threatened Santa
Clara county police invasion. He minds
his own business and lets the demon
of the law take care of himself. How
i ever he says he has noticed that most
of the young Tommy Miltons slow
down when they see him on the job,
so perhaps the cop is not doing such
a rushing business after all.
Life as a solitary watchman is not
without its throbs, either, according to
the one in question. During the course
of a day many thrilling skids and
would-be collisions can be observed
from such an advantageous point as
the junction of the two drives. A traf
fic cop would find interesting work on
Sundays at this crossroad.
Most of the Palo Alto and Univer
sity truck drivers are well trained by
this time, according to Ed, and take
the side road without having to be
flagged every trip. Business is there
fore not so brisk but that, the Farm's
outguard cannot enjoy a few moments'
conversation with the more sociable of
the passersby. His friends are becom
ing more numerous day by day for
"Hello Ed" is the only introduction
needed.
