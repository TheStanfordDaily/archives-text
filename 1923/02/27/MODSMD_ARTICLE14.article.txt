# IRELAND MAKES FINAL APPEARANCE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Cliff Ireland, the genial patriarch of
baseball who will make his final 1923
appearance at Stanford tomorrow af
ternoon, has visited the Farm for
thirty-one consecutive years, and has
an ambition to complete two decades
before he hangs his glove over the fire
place and lets the younger men go to
it. Cliff still scuttles about the diamond
with lots of fire, although he some
times lets one of the fast ones slip
through him just to encourage the
other team.
When sounded upon the lively ball,
Cliff opined that it only offset the re
cent legislation against spit-ball pitch
ing. He didn't seem to worry much
one way or the other.
It has always been something of a
puzzle as to how he managed to gather
and hold together a conglomerate
bunch of major and minor league play
i ers. sand-lot stars, and ex-college tal
; ent. Cliff says that they all play simply
for the fun of the game (which is a
plenty, with Cliff taking part) and that
applications begin to come in some
time about September or October of
j the preceding year. So it's really no
problem at all. though any other man
but Cliff might find it so.
According to Ireland, Milton Teague
of the Varsity and Toomey of this
year's California Varsity are the slick
est college twirlers he has ever en
j countered. Teague's underhand deliv
ery appeals to him especially.
