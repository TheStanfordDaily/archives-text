# SOPHOMORE WOMEN DEFEATED BY 1923 BASKETBALL SEXTET
## 
### 
Three senior centers and a forward
were largely responsible for (he big
gest end of the 21-8 score which the
senior women's sextette piled up
against the sophomores in yesterday's
game.
By consistent teamwork and swift
passing the senior centers, Joyce Rob
son, Virginia Burks, and Marjorie Mc-
Donald, blocked their rivlas' attempts
to pass the ball to their forwards. Most
of the contest was fought out in the
sehiors' territory. Hazel Churchman,
forward for the senior court six, caged
17 of the seniors' 21 points.
At the intermission the score stood
6-4 in favor of the senior women. Mary
Learnard started the second half by
making a field goal for the seniors.
Then the sophomore centers rallied
and rushed the ball to their forward,
who scored a field goal. The seniors
allowed their opponents only one more
goal; that was made in the final two
minutes.
