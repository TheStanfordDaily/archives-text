## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney put his boxers
through a stiff workout yesterday in
preparation for the Davis Farm return
matches which will be held in the gym
nasium at 7 :30 next Friday evening. The
team he selected will be as follows: 115-
pound class, Hard; 125-pound class,
Armbruster; 135-pound class, Hoss; 145-
pound class, Lane; 158-pound class,
Irwin; 175-pound class, Van Hook;
heavyweight class, Robinson.
Most of these men took part in the last
Davis Farm meet. However, the team it
considerably strengthened by the addi
tion of Jimmie Ross and Johnnie Lanr.
Both of these men have had past experi
ence on the boxing team and should lia»«r
little difficulty in winning their matchrs
at Davis. Robinson and Armbruster are
the other men who did not box in the
last meet. The team this tims is a little
better balanced than it was before, and
Stanford should give the Davis men
more competition than before.
