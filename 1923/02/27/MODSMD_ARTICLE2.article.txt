"The prevalence of provincialism is 1
a characteristic in all countries. People
cannot see beyond their national hori
zon and a thing foreign is a thing to
be avoided. The Cosmopolitan Club
motto, 'Above all nations is humanity,'
is a universal maxim," said Professor
Ishihashi, of the Japanese History de
partment and first president and char
ter member of the Cosmopolitan Club.
Mr. Parks, the assistant librarian,
gave a brief resume of Cosmopolitan
Club history and of the early stages of
activity in the Stanford chapter. There
are 54 chapters of the Cosmopolitan
Club with ovÂ«r one thousand members !
scattered over the country.
Professor Emeritus J. M. Stillman
expressed the belief that it was a
profitable thing for foreign students to ,
get together as good acquaintance
would give a common meeting ground.
Dr. Jordan emphasized the import
ance of principles of internationalism.
He told of the activities of a student j
from Cornell University, where the j
second chapter of the Cosmopolitan ,
Club was established, in organizing j
international societies in Germany,
France, and Russia, and of the service
rendered him by the organization in
Paris when he was lecturing there
against militarism.
Jasmine tea and rice cakes were
served to the guests, who were fur
ther diverted by a game of Spanish
hieroglyphics before adjournment.
