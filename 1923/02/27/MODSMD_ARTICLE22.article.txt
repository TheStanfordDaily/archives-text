# THE
						BASKETBALL SEASON
## 
### 
The basketball season is ended. Rather high hopes,
recently squashed, together with Stanford's unusual
withdrawal from the conference fight, have left a
certain dull taste and disfavor among some students.
Behind the withdrawal were two reasons. Should
Captain Rogers and his crew have been able to take
the fifth game from California, Stanford would have
gone north to battle for the Coast title, but her team
would still have been second to that of the Bears,
on the three out of five dual competition basis be
tween U. C. and the Cardinal. Our position would
have been accepted by percentage rating, but ques
tionable, nevertheless.
Secondly, a fifth game with California, and the
subsequent trip into the mrthland would have taken
the players away from classes for two weeks at a
very crucial time of the quarter, just before final ex
aminations. The scholarship casualties have already
been too high this season, among athletes, and it is
known that some of the men cannot well afford the
absence. The chances were too great to risk for a
questionable conference championship, though they
would have been taken had Stanford been able to
beat the Bears in the match Friday last.
Summing up the season, we note:
The Stanford team, rated at first as a weak sister,
came up strong, fought stubbornly through the last
series though outfoxed by a stronger veteran outfit,
and finished tied with California for the title in the
southern division. Incidentally, it shows much
promise for next year.
1 he Stanford rooting, to use a mild word, was in
glorious. The booing at the last game showed poor
spirit and lack of understanding of basketball, par
ticularly that directed at the apparent stalling of the
California guards in handling the ball. Their stall
play was perfectly legitimate, used for the purpose of
getting Stanford men out and California men in po
sition, and it is merely a play which the Bears picked
up from Stanford two years ago, when "Swede"
Righter and Jim Davies used it so successfully
against them.
Our rooting was childlike and our singing an
atrocity. \V here are those deep, husky voices which
used to bellow forth a volume that would raise the
roof from ten basketball pavilions? Time was when
a handful of Stanford rooters would go to Berkeley
and put the whole state institution to shame. Vic
tory or no victory, the rooters could be counted on.
Now a small group of Californians come down and
beat us at home. Our trouble is 50 per cent in
organization, and 50 per cent in either attitude or
knowledge of the student rooter. The matter can be
corrected, and that without great difficulty. Let's
have it clone when we go behind the track and base
ball teams this spring.
