# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
Seems like we just WILL get angry with one another
about things. Last night Cabbages was almost boiled
by the proximity of hot words laid around it. Ram's
Head show was in for another panning, and the old
Cabbage column was so close to the fire it almost
melted our type.
Then ye editor of Knockers and Diggers was raked
gently over the glowing coal by somebody who had more
glowing coal than our janitor can seem to afford.
* * *
Cabbages is sorry that we are a "sheet." We shudder
at the vileness of the epithet! B-r-r-r! Call us ANY
THING, dear, appreciative public, but not that! My
Gawd, never!
• * •
. SPRING
It is now the lovely springtime, and I'll tell you how
I know,
There's no heat in grate or furnace, cold the radiator's
steel,
Even colder than is usual, when we're under winter's
heel.
And the cold I've had all winter, in my head, is break
ing down,
Yes, it's breaking down my system, and it's finally
got ME down.
In the trees the saps are running (as are those upon
the Quad)
And the birds are all returning to upset the seeded
sod,
Where the seeds are newly planted, in the hopes of
new-grown grass.
Any guy who bleats of Springtime now is just an
awful ass.

It is now the lovely springtime, and I'll tell you how
I know,
There's no heat in grate or furnace, cold the radiator's

Even colder than is usual, when we're under winter's

And the cold I've had all winter, in my head, is break

Yes, it's breaking down my system, and it's finally

Seems like we just WILL get angry with one another
about things. Last night Cabbages was almost boiled
by the proximity of hot words laid around it. Ram's
Head show was in for another panning, and the old
Cabbage column was so close to the fire it almost
melted our type.
Then ye editor of Knockers and Diggers was raked
gently over the glowing coal by somebody who had more
glowing coal than our janitor can seem to afford.
* * *
Cabbages is sorry that we are a "sheet." We shudder
at the vileness of the epithet! B-r-r-r! Call us ANY
THING, dear, appreciative public, but not that! My
Gawd, never!

. SPRING
It is now the lovely springtime, and I'll tell you how
I know,
There's no heat in grate or furnace, cold the radiator's
steel,
Even colder than is usual, when we're under winter's
heel.
And the cold I've had all winter, in my head, is break
ing down,
Yes, it's breaking down my system, and it's finally
got ME down.
In the trees the saps are running (as are those upon
the Quad)
And the birds are all returning to upset the seeded
sod,
Where the seeds are newly planted, in the hopes of
new-grown grass.
Any guy who bleats of Springtime now is just an
awful ass.
