(Students zvlio wish their communica
tions printed are warned against letting
discussions in these columns resolve
themselves into repetitions of scathing
personalities. There seems to be a frantic
effort on the part of both sides to have
the "last word." The Daily Palo Alto
reserves the right to cut discussions short
when they reach that stage. â€”T HE

It is indeed unfortunate that off
campus correspondents (who are willing
enough to co-operate) allow such per
verted versions of trivial campus doings
to be published broadcast.
After so much fuss over such a very
small matter, I believe that the campus
at least (let the off-campus correspon
dents tell the world) should now how
that joke escaped the Old Boy's eagle

Mr. Lewis, who preceded Mr. Ely as
editor of Chaparral, "blue penciled" the
exchanges after proofs were returned
from the proof readers. This particular
galley reached the proof room while
Lewis was still in office, but was never
returned to him. Ely swings his "blue
pencil" before copy goes to the proof
room, consequently he was not aware
that this holdover copy was being used
without having been read by either him
self or Lewis.
