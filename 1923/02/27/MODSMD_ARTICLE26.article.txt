# PAINTINGS INCLUDED IN INDIAN EXHIBITS
## 
### 
Four paintings of Indian life by Theo
dore Wores are included in the collection
of Indian Arts and Crafts, now at the
Stanford Art Gallery.
The corn harvest in Taos is shown
very idealistically, and yet is a very true
representation of the important place
the harvest has in their lives. The corn
is black and the people practically exist
011 it, although the bread is quite taste
less.
The painting of an old Indian woman
shows a rug in construction, and the
contrast of the older Navajo rugs and
the modern blankets is easily seen from
the examples in the collection. One very
old Navajo blanket made by the younger
wife of the chief of the Anasazi Hogan
people of long age. was given to the col
lection by Mr. William Horabin of Palo
Alto.
Several Navajo Indian women's girdles
are included in the collection, and they
are very colorful, especially so when
worn on the sombre garments of the
tribe. A Moqui Indian spindle, with
which the wool is spun to weave the
blankets, is also shown in the case.
