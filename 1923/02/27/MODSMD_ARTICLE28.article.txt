# AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT MAKES EXPERIMENTS HERE

### 
Experimentation in crossing fruit j
trees for the purpose of developing
superior varieties is being carried out
on a twenty-acre plot of University
property near the Stanford Nursery by
William F. Wight, '99, representative
of the United States Department of
Agriculture. About 600 hybrid trees,
mostly almonds, pears, peaches, plums,
prunes, and apricots, have been planted
to date, and are under the careful at
tention of Wight.
Wight commenced the work about
one year ago. At present only a part
of the twenty-acre field available for
the experimentation has been utilized.
The securing of a new variety of fruit,
which combines the good qualities and
eliminates the undesired qualities of
the present types, necessitates several
years of painstaking work, Wight says.
After the variety has been developed,
and the particular qualities of flavor,
size, juciness, and firmness are estab
lished, further experimentation must
be made to see if the new species will
stand the strain of shipping and will
be accepted on the market.
With the almonds, Wight is attempt
ing to develop a variety which has not
only a soft shell and a kernel of good
quality, but one which has the hardi
ness to resist extremes of weather and
the property of blooming later than
most of the present varieties, making
it less likely to lose its blossoms from
early spring storms. Wight has already
secured 150 hybrids of almonds in his
experimentation to find a better spe
cies.
Iti speaking of the object of his work,
Wight says that in the case of the
apricots he hopes to obtain a variety
which has the fine fruit qualities of
the Blenheim apricot together with the

propensity of ripening over a longer
period. The chief difficulties of apricot
growers arise from having auch a short
ripening season.
As the most popular varieties of
pears are the most easily damaged by
blight, Wight is trying to find a pear
that has the resistance of the poorer
trees along with the attractive quali
ties of the better kinds. Blight is one
of the hardest problems the pear-raiser
has now to deal with; a fine fruit not
susceptible so easily to this disease
would be of great value to the industry,
Wight explains.
A series of crosses which will ulti
mately give a hybrid prune that has
the good flavor and drying qualities of
the French prune, together with the
larger size of others and the earlier
ripening properties of still others, is
being attempted by the scientist.
Other aims of Wight are to obtain a
successful cross between the Missis
sippi Valley plum and the European
plum, and to find a variety of peach
better suited to the needs of the can
ning industry.
One of the most difficult tasks the
plant breeder has to perform is the
artificial pollinization of the trees.
Each one of the thousands of blossoms
must be worked on individually. The
stamens must at the proper time be
taken out by hand, and later on each
blossom must be given a little pollen
from the desired other species.
Wight, who took his M. A. degree
here in 1900, has been since then con
tinually in the service of the Depart
ment of Agriculture. Among the inter
esting assignments which the depart
ment has given him, Wight mentioned
a trip through the highlands of Peru
and Bolivia in search for the original
species of the white potato.

being attempted by the scientist.
Other aims of Wight are to obtain a
successful cross between the Missis
sippi Valley plum and the European
plum, and to find a variety of peach
better suited to the needs of the can
ning industry.
One of the most difficult tasks the
plant breeder has to perform is the
artificial pollinization of the trees.
Each one of the thousands of blossoms
must be worked on individually. The
stamens must at the proper time be
taken out by hand, and later on each
blossom must be given a little pollen
from the desired other species.
Wight, who took his M. A. degree
here in 1900, has been since then con
tinually in the service of the Depart
ment of Agriculture. Among the inter
esting assignments which the depart
ment has given him, Wight mentioned
a trip through the highlands of Peru
and Bolivia in search for the original
species of the white potato.
Experimentation in crossing fruit j
trees for the purpose of developing
superior varieties is being carried out
on a twenty-acre plot of University
property near the Stanford Nursery by
William F. Wight, '99, representative
of the United States Department of
Agriculture. About 600 hybrid trees,
mostly almonds, pears, peaches, plums,
prunes, and apricots, have been planted
to date, and are under the careful at
tention of Wight.
Wight commenced the work about
one year ago. At present only a part
of the twenty-acre field available for
the experimentation has been utilized.
The securing of a new variety of fruit,
which combines the good qualities and
eliminates the undesired qualities of
the present types, necessitates several
years of painstaking work, Wight says.
After the variety has been developed,
and the particular qualities of flavor,
size, juciness, and firmness are estab
lished, further experimentation must
be made to see if the new species will
stand the strain of shipping and will
be accepted on the market.
With the almonds, Wight is attempt
ing to develop a variety which has not
only a soft shell and a kernel of good
quality, but one which has the hardi
ness to resist extremes of weather and
the property of blooming later than
most of the present varieties, making
it less likely to lose its blossoms from
early spring storms. Wight has already
secured 150 hybrids of almonds in his
experimentation to find a better spe
cies.
Iti speaking of the object of his work,
Wight says that in the case of the
apricots he hopes to obtain a variety
which has the fine fruit qualities of
the Blenheim apricot together with the

propensity of ripening over a longer
period. The chief difficulties of apricot
growers arise from having auch a short
ripening season.
As the most popular varieties of
pears are the most easily damaged by
blight, Wight is trying to find a pear
that has the resistance of the poorer
trees along with the attractive quali
ties of the better kinds. Blight is one
of the hardest problems the pear-raiser
has now to deal with; a fine fruit not
susceptible so easily to this disease
would be of great value to the industry,
Wight explains.
A series of crosses which will ulti
mately give a hybrid prune that has
the good flavor and drying qualities of
the French prune, together with the
larger size of others and the earlier
ripening properties of still others, is
being attempted by the scientist.
