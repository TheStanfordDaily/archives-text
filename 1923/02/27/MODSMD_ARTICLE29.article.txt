# BABE NINE TO MEET OAKLAND HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
After defeating Richmond High
School with a patched-up team last Sat
urday, the freshman nine will be able to
use something approaching its real
strength against Oakland High tomorrow
afternoon at 3 :30 on the freshman dia
mond. Although no dope has crossed
the bay regarding the strength of the
preparatory men. they usually have a
strong line-up and the Babes will have
an opportunity to show what they have
in them.
Tod Oviatt will probably be selected
for duty on the slab, as Ditzler is in bed
with the "flu." and Krnie Nevers is
nursing a sore arm. Oviatt hurt his
ankle again Saturday in sliding into sec
ond base, but the injury was slight and
he will be able to work if Hunt calls on
him. Kohler will be stationed behind the
plate.
