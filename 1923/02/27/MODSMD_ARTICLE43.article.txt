Guy Dennis seems to be getting back
his old form in the pole vault. He won
the event in the informal meet Sat
urday at 12 feet and he had plenty of
reserve to carry himself higher if he

Harry Maloney has been up against
a pretty stiff proposition in selecting
the members of the boxing team. In
several of the weights two men are
evenly matched. Some of these are:
Van Hook and McKee in the light
heavyweight class; Irwin and Stoddard
in the middleweight class, and Adams
and Penepacker in the 145-pound class.

A baseball game in which Cliff Ire
land figures is just one continuous
round fo pleasure, as the boy said
about the doughnut. Cliff probably
stands second only to Nick Altrock as
a baseball comedian, and there is
never anything but good-natured
wrangling between the two teams.

"Here's where I have to be careful,"
said Cliff, sitting down on first base
after making his annual bingle. Reach
ing second on Montague's single he
stared about him in bewilderment and
inquired "What base is this?"

Stanford must be reckoned with in
the national senior water-polo cham
pionships at Chicago in April. Already
holding the national junior title, the
Card seven is one of the leading con
tenders for the national title.

Vaughn Hosepian, intercollegiate
135-pound wrestling champion, will be
seen on the mat for Stanford again
this year. Hosepian is in better shape
than ever, as he has been working out
all year in the capacity of wrestling
instructor.

Cliff calmly watched Carver gallop
miles and miles after a fly ball last
Saturday, but when the Stanford field
er caught it, it was too much for him.
"What's his first name." he yelled.
"It know his last one —it's James."
