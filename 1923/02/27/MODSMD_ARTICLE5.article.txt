# Women Ban Love Letters In Alabama University
## 
### 
Dixie love letters with a "thrill guar
anteed" and certain to initiate you into
the ways of southern love-making, have
been tabooed by the Women's Council
of the University of Alabama. The
Council decided that such a plan was
not proper as a means of raising funds
to erect a sorority house.
The plan leaded cut when the local
mails became clogged with replies to ad
vertisements for a series of heart-palpi
tating epistles to run to the end of the
college year for the sum of $5. The
checks of enthusiastic subscribers were
returned with the statement that such
love letters would give the outside world
a wrong impression of Alabama girls.
