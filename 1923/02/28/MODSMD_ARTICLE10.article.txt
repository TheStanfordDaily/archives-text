# DR. CHARLES CLARK GIVES LECTURE ON "ITALY OF TODAY"
## Lecturer Sketches Biography Of Mussolini and Discusses Some of Italian Problems 
### 
"The spirit in which the tens of
thousands of young Italian lads gave
their lives to hold the Po river against
the Austrian advance is typical of the
determination of modern Italy to main
tain the best civilization," said Dr.
Charles Upson Clark in an illustrated
lecture that was given last evening in
the Little Theater.
"Mussolini, the prime minister of
Italy, is making a sincere effort to
carry out some much-needed reforms.
But the difficulties in the path of a
reformer are many," declared Dr.
Clark.
"When I was in Italy I knew a clerk
in the Treasury Department. This man
had to take paper and pencil to divide
273 by 3 by the process of long divi
sion. And with the aid of paper and
pencil the clerk made a mistake. The
governmental departments at Rome
are clogged with this kind of em
ployes.
Mussolini is in favor of giving the
railways back to the private owners,
and he is discharging 50,000 govern
mental employes. The United States is
three times as large as Italy. What
would happen in this country if our
government discharged 150,000 men?
"Another problem that the Italian
government has to meet is taxation.
Compared with Italy, we don't have a
ghost of an idea about taxation. In
that country there is a tax stamp on
every fifty-cent bill. Every time a man
makes out a twenty dollar check he is
taxed five cents. If he makes out a
hundred dollar check, he is taxed
twenty cents."
