# DR. CHARLES CLARK GIVES LECTURE ON "ITALY OF TODAY"
## Lecturer Sketches Biography Of Mussolini and Discusses Some of Italian Problems 
### 
"The spirit in which the tens of
thousands of young Italian lads gave
their lives to hold the Po river against
the Austrian advance is typical of the
determination of modern Italy to main
tain the best civilization," said Dr.
Charles Upson Clark in an illustrated
lecture that was given last evening in
the Little Theater.
"Mussolini, the prime minister of
Italy, is making a sincere effort to
carry out some much-needed reforms.
But the difficulties in the path of a
reformer are many," declared Dr.
Clark.
"When I was in Italy I knew a clerk
in the Treasury Department. This man
had to take paper and pencil to divide
273 by 3 by the process of long divi
sion. And with the aid of paper and
pencil the clerk made a mistake. The
governmental departments at Rome
are clogged with this kind of em
ployes.
Mussolini is in favor of giving the
railways back to the private owners,
and he is discharging 50,000 govern
mental employes. The United States is
three times as large as Italy. What
would happen in this country if our
government discharged 150,000 men?
"Another problem that the Italian
government has to meet is taxation.
Compared with Italy, we don't have a
ghost of an idea about taxation. In
that country there is a tax stamp on
every fifty-cent bill. Every time a man
makes out a twenty dollar check he is
taxed five cents. If he makes out a
hundred dollar check, he is taxed
twenty cents."
Dr. Clark gave a short biography of
Mussolini. According to the speaker,
the present prime-minister is the son
of a blacksmith, who was prominent
in the political affairs of his village.
Mussolini had a thirst for education.
When he was a young man he taught
school. The Socialists of the commun
ity begged him to run for the Italian
Parliament. Mussolini consented but
was defeated in the election. Angered
by the outcome of the election, he
chopped up the ballot-box. The Italian
government promptly banished him,
and Mussolini went to France, where
he studied in the universities and re
ceived a degree in French literature.
Later he worked on a socialist paper
in Switzerland but the editorials that
he wrote were too searching to please
the Swiss government, and Mussolini
had to leave the country. Then he went
to Italy and joined the staff of the So
cialist paper called the Avanti.
When the war started, Mussolini
broke with the Socialist party and was
in favor of joining the Allies. He es
tablished a newspaper of his own
which he called The Italian People.
Later he enlisted in the army, and af
ter being severely wounded, he was
sent back home.
Mussolini was responsible for the
plan of organizing the ex-service men,
called the Fascisti, into a party that
opposed the Bolshevik Socialists.
"The prime minister has the co
operation of all the people who really
wish reform," said Dr. Clark. "His ene
mies are the Socialists and those who
object to the new methods of taxa
tion."
In speaking about the Italians, Dr.
Clark said, "There are a good many
misconceptions about the Italian peo
ple. A friend of mine once said to me,

'Clark, why are you so enthusiastic
about the Italians? They are robbers.'
"Time after time when I was in
Italy a merchant called me back to
give me change that 1 had forgotten.
My wife gave a servant a pair of shoes
and told him to take them to the shoe
maker's to have rubber heels put on
them. A little while later the man re
turned and said, 'The robber shoe
maker wanted to charge sixteen cents
to put the rubber heels on the shoes.
I'll put them on myself'."
After the lecture motion pictures of
i the beautiful scenery in Sicily and
Italy and also of the winter sports at
â–  Cortina were shown.
Dr. Clark was director of the Ameri
can School of Classical Studies in
Rome for four years. During the war
he was with the Italian troops for
| three months.
