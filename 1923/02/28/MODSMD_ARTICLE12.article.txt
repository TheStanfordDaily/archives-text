# COLLEGIENNES CONFIDENTIAL WHILE ACQUIRING BEAUTY
## 
### 
At the top of the stairs on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse there's
a sign on a door that reads, "Stanford
Women's Beauty Parlor." And behind
this door there's a neat room, decorated
in blue and white, that's fitted out with
all the accessories of a beauty dispensary.
Besides giving manicures and marcels,
the owner of the campus beauty shop,
Miss Nell Gorman, meets a good many
women, and knows quite a bit about col
lege people.
"College girls aren't as vain as older
women," says Miss Gorman. "The add
that reads 'Keep That School-Girl Com
plexion' expresses the situation exactly.
It's in later life that a woman decides
that she wants to look like she did in
college."
According to Miss Gorman, the beauty
parlor is the place where otie can hear
a good deal of confidential chatter.
"Give me an extra good marcel," says

the excited young thing. "I'm queening
a man I've never been out with before.
And you know Bill has been going with
Georgia all winter, and she is going to
be at the dance tonight. Bet 1 get the
cold shoulder from her."
Sometimes the young women aren't
in such a happy frame of mind.
"You know Dick and 1 had a fight
last night," says the down-hearted col
lege miss. "He thinks I broke a date
with him 011 purpose, and when I tried
to explain, he wouldn't even listen to
me. Aren't men funny?"
Miss Gorman says that as far as she
knows only one man has been in the
beauty parlor. One day a Stanford man
came in and said, "Do you think I'd look
good with a marcel ?"
"No," replied the proprietor, "I don't
think you would."
Whereupon the young man banged the
door and fled down the stairs.
