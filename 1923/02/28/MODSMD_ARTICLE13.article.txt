# FRESHMEN, SOPHOMORES PLAY BALL TOMORROW
## 
### 
All the old traditional rivalry will be
given a chance to air itself tomorrow
when sophomore meets freshman 011
the freshman baseball field tomorrow
at 3:30 in the first game of the inter
class series. It will be a baseball "con
test" at any rate.
The freshmen probably have the
smoothest-working team of any of the
four classes. Since all men who have
not won a varsity "S" in baseball are
eligible for the class teams, the whole
regular first string, which have been
practicing under the coaching of
"Husky" Hunt for a month, will be
able to play. Hunt has not announced
the line-up as yet, but the freshmen
have shown class so far this season,
and with their start, should be able to
make a good bid for numerals on the
trophy in baseball.
The four athletic managers will
journey to San Francisco tomorrow
to buy the trophy. According to Di
rector C. W. Davis, about $100 will be
spent on it, and it will be placed in
the library and will bear the numerals
of the class making most points in the
seven sports each year. It has not been
decided whether a plaque or cup will
be bought.
About fifteen men have been turning
out to practice for the 1925 team, and
this number includes several men on
the regular varsity line-up. The line-up
has not been definitely decided, but
according to Manager Gertmenian, the

following will play: Hadley, catcher;
Johnson, pitcher; J. Aydelott, Ist base,
and Roberts, McKechnie, Wilston, L.
Aydelott, Acherson. Jimmie Aydelott
will also probably try his arm at
pitching for a couple of innings.
Manager Gertmenian has asked that
all sophomores be out to root for the
1925 team.
Manager Eckhoff has asked that all
freshmen be out to root for the 1926
team.
