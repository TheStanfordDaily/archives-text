# Fauna and Flora of Mud Lakes Now Being Gathered
## 
### 
Materials arc being gathered from the
j Helvitio Lakes, better known as the Mud
I Lakes, located about one-half a mile be
yond Strawberry Rend, to be used in
laboratory work by zoology and botany
classes. According to Professors Heath
and McMurphy, who have used the lake
for procuring samples, there is an un
usual wealth of small animal and plant
life there.
The fauna is distinctive, differing from
that in Lagunita, Searsville, and Felt
Lake. The fresh-water shrimps found at
tlie Helvetio Lakes are twice the size of
the shrimps of the same species which
live in Lagunita. Large numbers of
salamanders inhabit the Mud Lakes,
while few arc ever found around
Lagunita.
