# English, the Stage, Are Vocational Meeting Topics

"The chief professional value of the
study of English is that it will serve as
a background for many other fields of
work," said Miss Edith Mirrielees of
the English department in her talk on
the vocational opportunities for Eng
lish majors at> the meeting of the voca
tional conference yesterday afternoon.
Miss Mirrielees brought out the fact
that anyone who intends to write must
expect to spend at least four years of
full time work practicing before he can
expect to get anything published. Miss
Mirrielees recommended that prospec
tive authors should take as many read
ing courses as possible while in the Uni
versity in order to familiarize them
selves with the best styles.
Other vocations into which English
training will lead one were mentioned
by Miss Mirrielees, among them journal
ism, revision of manuscripts, and the
reading and appraising of manuscripts
for magazines.
"Acting, outside of semi-professional
work, such as is to be found in com
munity theaters, is a poor opening," said
Richard Bentinck, in discussing the stage
as a vocation. "The difficulty is that
most managers require experience. A
good way to acquire this is to play in a
stock company for a year."
According to Mr. Bentinck, now that
new ideas in the matter of stage settings
and the production of plays have reached
America from Europe, there arc more
positions for people with college train
ing.
Women can find work as costume de
signers. The position of scenic artist
is one requiring a more specialized train
ing, however. Mr. Bentinck said that
most colleges do not give training such
as will fit their graduates for the stage.
This situation is improving, though.
