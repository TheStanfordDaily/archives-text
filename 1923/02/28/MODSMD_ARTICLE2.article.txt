## 
### 
The junior women won an easy vie- j
tory, 44-4, from the freshman basket
ball team in the game played yesterday
afternoon on the Roble field. Most of
the fight centered around the junior
goal. Eunice Biddle, Kathleen Evans, I
and Grace Strobel, junior centers, kept
the hall out of the freshmen's territory. 1
The freshman forwards didn't even
have a chance to show what they
could do.
Alice Roth and Mabel McCanse each
caged 22 points for the junior sextette. ,
The freshmen made only one field goal
during the contest.
At half-time the score had reached
20-2 in favor of the juniors. In the last
half the freshman women made one J
field goal, while the junior forwards
caged 24 shots.
Fast, steady teamwork on the part
of junior centers kept the ball from
the freshmen's end of the court.
