# CONTROL OF COLLEGE ATHLETICS
## 
### 
Because of the similarity of conditions existing
at Stanford and at Princeton, the following editorial,
clipped verbatim from the "Daily Princetonian" is
particularly timely:
"The symposium on 'The Control of College At
letics,' of which the first two articles have already
appeared in the Alumni Weekly, promises indeed to
'prove valuable in clearing up much of the prevailing
confusion concerning the control of college sports
and the reasons for such control.' Most of our
'Princeton thought on the subject has been dissipated
in committee room argument, and it is quite impos
sible definitely to state the guiding principles of our
•Board of Athletic Control. Its actions are for the
most part well advised, but much cricticism is ac
corded it and due to the fact that few alumni and
undergraduates know exactly what is the Board's
attitude toward athletics as a whole.
"It would be a very good idea if the Board should
issue, after the completion of the IVeekly's series, a
statement, drawn up in the light of these preceding
opinions, setting forth Princeton's official conception
of the place of athletics in our university scheme, —
their relation to the curriculum, their financial man
agement, their proper regulation and the extent to
which undergraduate and alumni interest shall op
crate therein, their avowed and their actual purposes
and values.
Professor Kennedy's promise that 'the central
problem of the control of college athletics is to cor
relate them to the high intellectual purposes of the
college in as subordinate a position as possible with
out loss of real value,' can certainly be adopted to
begin with. There need be no debate over the prime
•function of the university as an intellectual one so
long as the high values of extra-curricular activity
«ire recognized and safeguarded as fully as possible
in their secondary position.
"The strife will arise when the Board faces the
question Dr. Spaeth has put, as to the financial status
of sport. Are we justified in regarding receipts as
legitimate income, and if legitimate, are we bound
t© apply all of this income to athletic purposes ? Dr.
Spaeth says we are not so bound. He says that if
gate receipts are legitimate, their administration
should be subject to the authority of the financial
administration of the University, thus assigning to
the Board of Trustees full responsibility for certain
apparent discrepancies between scholastic and ath
letic finance. He further suggests that, having as
sumed this responsibility, the Trustees will be at
liberty to consider the athletic budget in direct and
reciprocal relation to the rest of the University's
finance—tuition, fees, room rentals, salaries, and
upkeep.
"It would certainly be well to vest the Trustees
with this responsibility for athletic finance. Placed
under a single head, the now divergent interests of
athletics and intellectual pursuits would synchronize
at once. But it would be a grave mistake to mix the
accounts of the two interests—paying professors'
salaries with gate receipts. The benefits of Trustee
control of athletics, without an undesirable com
mercializing of sport, would best be realized by keep
ing the athletic budget entirely separate; running
athletics at cost; applying the surplus of a fat year
to relieve the expense to undergraduates in the next,
or to expanding some backward branch of athletics ;
and, of course, limiting the seppe of athletics to pro
portions appropriate to their secondary position in
the university scheme."
Naturally, the composition of the Stanford Board
<»112 Athletic Control, with its student representation,
is more satisfactory than the Princeton organization.
The main interest in the editorial quoted is in the
arguments advanced regarding the disposition of
receipts from athletic contests.
