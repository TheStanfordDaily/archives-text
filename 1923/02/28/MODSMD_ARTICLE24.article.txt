SPRING SPORTS
Among the most prominent of Spring Sports we notice
Bennie Bandoline. He is out on the lake every day,
paddling around in his pink canoe. Never a care in the
world, has Bennie. Nothing to do all day, but bask in
the sunshine. College is. a wonderful place without
lessons.
Wow! Here comes the inside dope on WOMEN'S
BASKETBALL. Sh-h-h-h! Don't tell a sole, but one of
the Daily reporters sneaked over the other day and
watched a game. The Cabbage column publishes the
exclusive news:
* * *
Jumping-center: Listen, Susie, I'll powder my nose
when I'm going to tip the ball to you. •
Side-center: Ouch, get off my toe, you—you—fright!
Forward: Oh, I beg your pardon, I didn't mean to be
rough.
Forward No. 2: Get the mud off that ball if you want
me to make a basket with it.
Guard: Time out. I tore my hair net.
Referee: Are my ear puffs still even?

CONFESSIONS OF A CO-ED
By Mildred D.
I am an all-around American girl. I like sports. They
always show me a good time. I am fond of study; I
specialize in painting. My favorite pastime is cooking;
it's such a hot life. In tennis I'm a shark. I can
always win a love game.

"This has been a slow month," remarked the calendar.
"Only twenty-eight dates."
