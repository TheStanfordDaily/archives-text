# EGGS
## 
### 
Some time ago (I have the exact date and time writ
ten down somewhere) it became necessary for me to
subsist for a period of some days on the lowly article of
diet known as the egg. Now of eggs I am very fond.
What can match the delicate gold of its uliginous in
terior; and what the cloudy whiteness of its more
emulsionated exterior? '
Although, as I said, I am very fond of eggs, I must
confess to one peculiarity: I do not like them raw.
This is unusual, to be sure; I know it and have firmly
resolved to suffer for my idiocyncrasy, hiding it as best
I can by admitting fervently that I like them cooked.
Cookirg is an art, improper attention to which causes
vitality to wilt, and complexions to be destroyed. This
is particularly true of eggs (the cooking of which is
an art I mean to say.) To breathe upon them, however
heavily; or to mix them with live coals of a beautiful
dark color is not to cook them. Some day I shall write
a book on the cooking of eggs. Don't laugh, I really
shall.
Well, not too long ago, as I was saying when inter
rupted, 1 was forced to live on eggs. To the cafeteria
I hied myself, thinking golden thoughts surrounded by
cloudy whiteness.
I got my eggs (I think there were two), but to my
surprise they were not cooked. Someone had merely
held them over a hot fire (probably in a soup ladle) for
a few moments.
Th f s is meant as a surprise to me, I thought. But I
am sorry to say it was more than a surprise to my
stomach, which resolutely refused to perform what all
good stomachs should. So I ordered eggs again. This
time, I said, I will surprise them; so I had them
poached. Did I say I had them poached. I mean to say
I meant to have them poached.
What I got was one slice of soggy bread originally
burned to death on one side and then dipped into boiling
water to revive it, on the top of which rolled playfully
two oblate pellets of the consistency of golf balls. I
know what I am talking about, because I do not play
golf.
Then I understood. It was a game: you know, like
poker for example. You bet so much, or so much de
pending on how much you want to lose. Well I will fox
them, I said —to myself of course.
Then I explained the whole process of cooking eggs
to the gentleman at the window (who understood the
game very well and entered into the spirit of it
thoroughly, smiling pleasantly the while), just to let
him know I knew all about it. This time I lost as usual,
getting what I took to be some patent preparation which
someone thought people should eat instead of eggs. But
I enjoyed the game very much myself, and paid my
losses cheerfully. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed it so
much that, the next day, I went up to the main dining
room and played it all over again with many winks and
nods meant to inform the waiter, who was very anxious
not to miss anything, that I was getting fully as much
amusement out of the sport as he was.
This is all very well, but I am about to die on account
of not getting my eggs. When I am buried (which will
be soon I expect) I only request that they will bury
with me the egg-cooking machine I advised them to
install in the cafeteria when they came to me for my
help on how to build an efficient eating establishment.
