RED BULLDOGS
(Columbia)
"Stick up your hands. You're under
arrest anything you say may be
used against you."
The backwoods Black Maria ap
proached and hauled the criminals off
to jail, leaving Sergeant Murray
O'Fallon of the Northwestern Mounted
Police center stage as the curtain fell.
Which, of course, was the retribu
tion. Not even the rather famous
Williard Mack, author, director, and
star of "Red Bulldogs," would dare
have a story of the Mounted Police
without a retribution. The Mounted,
you know, never fails to gets its man.
However much Mack sticks to tradi
tion in this one respect, he atones for
it by cutting loose in others. He does
n't, for instance, have himself track
the criminal relentlessly through the
Larren wastes for months and months.
Nor does he rescue the heroine just as
the bad man is about to dispose of her.
And the saving on ammunition is ter
rific, only two shots being fired dur
ing the whole three hours.
The high lights of the play, act by
act, are:
ACT I. Th« bootlegger in Canada.
He hides it in the "brush" and delivers
the goods on a hand car.
ACT 11. "But Pop, I love him and
I'm going to marry him anyway." The
shot in the dark. The hunt is on.
ACT 111. The trapdoor in an aban
doned homesteader's cabin, and
"My God, Murray O'Fallon, haven't
you a heart?" sobs Sady Shade (Phyl
lis Connard) as the sergeant is about
to clamp the bracelets on the misun
derstood hero.
"I'm afraid not," answers O'Fallon
(Williard Mack), "I traded it in for
this red coat fourteen years ago."
ACT IV. . . . And then the retribu
tion.
The play naturally is dominated by
Sergeant O'Fallon, the "Erin Go
Braugh" gentleman who does his
drinking with buttermilk. Instead of
being a raucous hod-carrying Irishman,
Mack (or more completely, McLaugh
lin) tones his brogue and actions down
to a point where they are forceful
rather than boisterous.
If you don't care for Mack in any of
his triple capacities, you might be in
terested in the villain —who is as like
able a villain as has appeared for sev
eral months.
Clark Marshall, as Louie Dufuchet,
is adept enough to keep you wonder
ing even in the third act whether he is
really a bad man or only a poor boot
legger trying hard to get along.

proached and hauled the criminals off
to jail, leaving Sergeant Murray
O'Fallon of the Northwestern Mounted
Police center stage as the curtain fell.
Which, of course, was the retribu
tion. Not even the rather famous
Williard Mack, author, director, and
star of "Red Bulldogs," would dare
have a story of the Mounted Police
without a retribution. The Mounted,
you know, never fails to gets its man.
However much Mack sticks to tradi
tion in this one respect, he atones for
it by cutting loose in others. He does
n't, for instance, have himself track
the criminal relentlessly through the
Larren wastes for months and months.
Nor does he rescue the heroine just as
the bad man is about to dispose of her.
And the saving on ammunition is ter
rific, only two shots being fired dur
ing the whole three hours.
The high lights of the play, act by
act, are:
ACT I. Th« bootlegger in Canada.
He hides it in the "brush" and delivers
the goods on a hand car.
ACT 11. "But Pop, I love him and
I'm going to marry him anyway." The
shot in the dark. The hunt is on.
ACT 111. The trapdoor in an aban
doned homesteader's cabin, and
"My God, Murray O'Fallon, haven't
you a heart?" sobs Sady Shade (Phyl
lis Connard) as the sergeant is about
to clamp the bracelets on the misun
derstood hero.
"I'm afraid not," answers O'Fallon
(Williard Mack), "I traded it in for
this red coat fourteen years ago."
ACT IV. . . . And then the retribu
tion.
The play naturally is dominated by
Sergeant O'Fallon, the "Erin Go
Braugh" gentleman who does his
drinking with buttermilk. Instead of
being a raucous hod-carrying Irishman,
Mack (or more completely, McLaugh
lin) tones his brogue and actions down
to a point where they are forceful
rather than boisterous.
If you don't care for Mack in any of
his triple capacities, you might be in
terested in the villain —who is as like
able a villain as has appeared for sev
eral months.
Clark Marshall, as Louie Dufuchet,
is adept enough to keep you wonder
ing even in the third act whether he is
really a bad man or only a poor boot
legger trying hard to get along.
