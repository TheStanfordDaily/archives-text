# FRESHMAN-JUNIOR WATER-POLO SEVENS MEET IN TITLE BOUT
## 
### 
Freshman and junior water-polo teams
meet this afternoon in Encina pool at
4:30 for the interclass championship.
In the preliminary games, the juniors
overwhelmed the seniors, 8-2, and the
freshmen tamed the sophomores in a
tight contest, 3-2. In spite of the greater
experience of some of the players on
the junior team, the freshmen enter as
favorites, inasmuch as they have been
playing together as a team since the be
ginning of the year.
But whichever class wins, it looks like
a tough battle. For to offset the first
year men's better teamwork the juniors
have on their team such stars of the var
sity as Fletcher, Schmeider, and Collette.
Both teams are aggressive, and fight
from first to last.
The probable line-ups are:
Freshmen — O'Connor, Allen, and
Mack (captain), forwards; Langley,
Lewis, and McGattigan or. Schumacker,
backs; and Cole in goal. Juniors —•
Fletcher, Wright, and Herschmann, for
wards; Schmeider, Greppin, and Cross,
backs; and Collette in goal.
