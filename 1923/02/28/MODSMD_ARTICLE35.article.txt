Boles, a freshman hurdler, has
shown excellent form in topping the
high sticks in the few meets which
"Dink" Templeton has staged of late.
Lane Falk has to push himself to the
limit in order to come out in front of
the freshman who travels the high
hurdles in 15:2 with ease.

Coach Hunt has been deprived of
Ditzler's services, but managed to win
his last game in spite of it. "Fritz" is
sick in bed, and deserves a good rest.

Due to the muddy condition of the
fields, the Stanford polo squad has sus
pended hard practice for the present.
As the other coast teams—San Mateo
and Del Monte, are busily engaged at
present, the polo men plan to ease up
until the last of the quarter.

The win of Stanford's watpr-polo
varsity last Saturday over the all-star
team from San Francisco leads to the
prediction of another successful season
in the tank. The All-Stars are con

sidered one of the strongest teams on
the Coast.

Plans are under way to have a fresh
man boxing and wrestling team this
year. California has asked that Stan
ford have representatives in all
weights to meet their hopefuls, and
Maloney will try to send men in every
class.

Charley Daley, who skippers the
Junior Marathon team, says his men
are out for blood, and that they do not
intend to let the seniors win again.

With the soccer season ended, the
members of the team have only to
collect the numerous medals they have
won. The fifteen best men get gold
soccer footballs; the team gets one
leg on a perpetual trophy, and also
another leg on the trophy up for com
petition between California and Stan
ford. The best player gets an individu
al medal.

Cliff repeats himself only under one
circumstance. Whenever he sends a
player to the showers he says,"A hot
one and then a cold one —do you know
how to take "em?"
