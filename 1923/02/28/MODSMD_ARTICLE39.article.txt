# REHEARSALS FOR ENGLISH CLUB DRAMA START TODAY
## 
### 
Rehearsing for "Will Shakespeare," i
the four-act drama to be presented by
the English Club on April 6, was com
menced Monday night when the cast
came together for the first time and
read through the first act under the
direction of Richard Bentinck. Re
hearsals will be held from now until
the week of examinations.
Helen Whitney, '24, will play Mary
Fitten, "the dark lady of the sonnets,"
one of the female leads. Mrs. Wallis,
who was to have the part, will instead
play "Queen Elizabeth," one of the
most difficult characters to be por
trayed.
Helen Whitney, since her first ap
pearance in the Class of 1924's pre
sentation, "You Can Never Tell," has
been steadily engaged in dramatic
work on the campus. Miss Whitney's
reputation for fine dramatic interpreta
tion was established after acting last
year in "If I Were King." Other plays
which she has appeared in the last
two years are "The Football Frothies
of '22," "Tea for Three," and "The
Heart of Pierrot." â€¢
Director Richard Bentinck, who has
had varied dramatic experience abroad,
in New York and in Carmel, has been
asked by the English Club to play
"Will Shakespeare," the title role.
Miriam Hilton, '25, who carries one
of the three leading roles as Anne, the
wife of Will Shakespeare, will appear
for the first time before a college
audience. Miss Hilton has had experi
ence in many branches of dramatic art
at Washington and Portland high
schools, and in the opinion of Bentinck
gives indications of having the ability
to do some fine acting.

] Queen Elizabeth will be played by
Mrs. L. B. Wallis, who played stock
leads in Boston several years ago. Mrs.
Wallis worked with May Young in the
"Outrage of Mrs. Palmer." While in
Boston she studied two seasons with
the dramatic teacher, Miss T. U. Ir
! vine. Mrs. Wallis also attended Emer-
I
son College of Boston and worked
under Richard Bennet.
Henslowe, one of the principals, is
played by Harold Davis, '23. Davis was
in the cast of "Charm School" and
played Falstaff in the recent Theater
Workshop "King Henry IV." Before
coming to Stanford Davis was promi
nent in college dramatics at the Uni
versity of Utah. Davis was a member
of a university stock company which
produced plays off the campus, and a
member of a dramatic society there.
The Child will be portrayed by Dor
othy Kinkead, '26. who is rehearsing
for her first play. Because of her spe
cial fitness, permission was obtained
for hereto enter the cast in spite of the
ruling that women may not take part
in dramatic presentations during their
first year.
A. T. Steele, who appeared in Mas
quer's "Trelawney of the Wells," ren
dering a very creditable character in
terpertation, will be the landlord in
"Will Shakespeare." Steele has not
been associated with recent dramatic
programs.
Kit Marlowe, one of the principal
figures of Dane's drama, will be taken
by Matthew Tobriner, '24. Tobriner
has worked in Theater Workshop pre
sentation and played the Daffodil in
the English Club's "Yellow Jackett."
