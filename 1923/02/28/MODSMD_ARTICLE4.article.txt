# Cords Yield to Tuxedos And Basketball Bows to Military Ball Friday Night
## 
### 
Tuxedos, evening gowns, and parade
uniforms will replace the usual attire
of flannel trousers and gym suits in
the Pavilion Friday night. The crowd
will be there as before and the ball
will still be the center of attraction.
However it will be the Military Ball
> instead of basketball this time which
causes all the excitement.
Work on the decoration of the build
ing was begun this afternoon by the
R. O. T. C. students. The programs
will probably be given out either to
morrow or Friday at the Bookstore.
Tickets for this dance will remain on
; sale until Friday afternoon or until ex
hausted.
