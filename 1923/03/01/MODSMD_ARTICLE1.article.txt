# STANFORD DEBATE TEAM IS PREPARED FOR NORTHERNERS
## Argument Will Be Valuable Digest of Propaganda on Prohibition, Says Adviser 
### 
Stanford's tri-state debate teams are
ready to meet the speakers from the
universities of Oregon and Washington
tomorrow evening. The Stanford arguers
have been working for eight weeks on
the question, "Resolved, That the manu
facture and sale of light wines and beer
should be legalized in the United States,"
and they are well prepared.
Two debates will be held, one with the
University of Oregon at Eugene, and the
other with the University of Washing
ton in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock.
Stanford will argue against the proposed
change in the prohibition regulations in
the north and favor of the proposal here.
Claude Minard, '23, and Robert Lewis,
'23, form the Stanford affirmative team
which will debate in the Little Theater.
The Stanford negative team, com
posed of Thomas Bailey, '24, and Emmet
McCaffery, '24, left for Eugene on the
Shasta Limited yesterday.
The debate should be valuable as a
digest of the propaganda for and against
the liquor question, according to Debat
ing Adviser J. G. Emerson. Agitation
for light wines and beer is being carried
on all over the country by societies op
posed to the prohibition amendment.
Nevada has recenely passed a law re
pealing state aid to federal prohibition,
over the Governor's veto.
All of the Stanford men who will take;
the floor in this debate, except Minard, j
have had previous varsity debating ex- j
pcrience. Minard has participated in in-;
tersocicty debates, but this will be his
first appearance in an intercollegiate
argument.
