Illustrated descriptions and discussions!
of the flora of Australasia by Professor
Douglas Houghton Campbell, head of the i
Department of Botany, are being pub-;
lished in the American Journal of Bot- i
any. Number One, the flora of Queens-;
land and New South Wales, appeared in'
the last issue of the publication.
Dr. Campbell's work is the result of I
study made on several trips to Australia:
and islands of the South Seas. The flora, j
which includes very unusual types not
found elsewhere, is compared and con
trasted by Campbell to plant life on
other continents. Interesting illustra- j
tions of Dr. Campbell's, such as a pho
tograph of the Australian fern tree, are
included in this first article.
