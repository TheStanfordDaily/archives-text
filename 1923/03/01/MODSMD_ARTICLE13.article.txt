# STANFORD POLO FIVE TO PLAY ARMY TEAM
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team will play the
30th Infantry from the San Francisco
Presidio at 10 Saturday morning on the
new field near the highway.
Each team has won a game from the
other by a score of 6-5 in both cases, the
victory being gained in additional periods
of play. As the teams are so evenly
matched, the score is likely to be very
close.
