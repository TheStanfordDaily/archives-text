# "Strategy Map" Shows Efficiency Of Stanford Fire Department
## 
### 
The scream of a siren in the black-1
ness of night! The roar of a powerful
unmuffled motor and the crackle of
flame! The romantic side of fire-fight
ing, which is its primary and most
powreful appeal.
The business side occupies just
about a dozen times as much time and
energy and receives little if any atten
tion from the layman. A properly or
ganized unit of fire prevention and
fighting should be as scientifically and
carefully calculated as an important
military offensive. Under the control of |
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb, the University |
Fire Department has nothing to fear
on that score.
Leaving the machinery and equip
ment to be treated in another article,
this one will be concerned with Lamb's
"fire-fighting strategy" map. On the
wall of the Marshal's office in the fire
house is a map measuring 6 by 3 feet,
which takes in the Campus proper
from San Francisquito creek almost
to Mayfield, and from the Children's
Convalescent Home to the Lathrop
residence and San Juan Hill. Vari
colored pins in this map serve to indi
cate everything that the most curious
fireman could wish to know. A pin
shows the location of every hydrant,
and tells whether it is connected with
the Searsville lines or the domestic
water systems. The Chief can distin
guish nt a glance just how many
streams of water he can concentrate

on any given building, and no building
on the campus is more than 300 feet
from a hydrant. When a hydrant is
"dead," or blocked up for any reason,
the pin is removed from the map until
repairs have been made.
Every building is marked by a pin
whose color indicates the nature of
occupants or contents. Buildings for
women only; buildings for men, for
families, for storage and commercial
purposes, and high tension electric
current are shown, and a glance at the
map will make clear the extent to
which human life is involved in con
nection with an alarm of fire. Two red
pins on the map indicate buildings
where fires have recently occurred,
and a white flag is placed over any
building which allows any complaint
as to "hazard condition." The flag is
taken away when the cause for danger
has been cleaned up.
In addition to the reservoir on San
Juan Hill, the domestic water system
includes a coupft l of man-holes by
which the swimming tanks at Encina
and Roble gymnasiums can be con
verted into water resources for fire
fighting. The Military Reservation
(marked by red, white, and blue pins)
is protected chiefly by the manhole at
Encina gym. The new building units
now under construction will be pro
tected by a dual system of domestic
and Searsville hydrants, so that one
can furnish water if the other Bliould,
by any chance, fail.
