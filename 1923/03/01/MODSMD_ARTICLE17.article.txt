# WATER POLO TITLE WON BY FRESHMEN
## 
### Walter Campbell, '26 
Outguessing and outplaying their op- \
poncnts, the freshman water-polo team
defeated the juniors yesterday in Encina
pool for the interclaSs championship, 3-0.
This victory gives the freshman class a
leg on the interclass trophy, and gives
each member of the victorious team a'
silver medal.
The game, though not very fast, was:
a nip-and-tuck affair for the major por- j
tion of the first half At first it seemed j
to be anybody's game. The ball was re
peatedly dribbled or passed from one end i
of the tank to the other, only to be lost
to the backs of the opposing team. How- j
ever, a few minutes before the end of the;
half, the first-year men broke through;
on a clean shot by Allen.
During the second half, the junior i
backs strove desperately to keep the ball |
from their goal, but the freshmen scored i
twice more, on shots by O'Connor and |
Mack. The '24 men tried hard to score j
a few points on their own account, but j
were unable to break through the strong j
defense offered by the babes.
As a team, the freshmen functioned 1
well together throughout the entire con
test. Their passing and teamwork were, j
in all but a few instances, dazzling to
the juniors. The outstanding players!
for the '26 men were O'Connor and
Mack, at forwards and Cole at goal.
For the juniors, Fletcher and Collett j
of the varsity played fast, heady games, i
