# VIEWS OF YOUTH OF EUROPE DISCUSSED AT FORUM MEETING
## 
### 
The principal phase of the youth
movement in Germany and Czecho-Sla
vakia were outlined by Karl Joachim
Friedrich of Heidelberg and Antonin
Palecek of Prague last night at the first
meeting of the National Student Forum.
"In all constructive movements in Ger
many you will find that the leaders are
drawn from the youth movement."
Friedrich asserted. "These men, who
got a taste of the rottenness of the old
civilization in the war, are now forming
the nucleus of the new nation.
"These educational tendencies are
without any political aspect," Friedrich
said. "The separation of the school from
politics reverts to the old German atti
tude of not caring to meddle in politics,
but in general it is the surest course to
follow."
,"Jt is chiefly prejudice that the student
movement in Czecho-Slovakia is directed
against." Palecek said in describing the
cousin of tjie German movement.
The last meeting of the Student Forum
at which the foreign students will speak
will be held in the Assembly hall this
evening at 7:30.
