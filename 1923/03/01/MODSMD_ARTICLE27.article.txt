# LIMITS TO LIBERTY

Jt ought not to be necessary for Dr. Barrow to
issue a warning against breaking into the Gym
nasium and the swimming pool at times when those
places are not open for general use.
The warning is not made through any desire on
the part,, of the Administration to restrict the liber
ties and pleasures of the students, but merely from
necessity conserving equipment and safeguarding
life.
University students are accustomed to having
special leniency granted them and because of that
are inclined to take advantage of every opportunity
to get around regulations governing other people.
Dr. Barrow has called attention to the fact that in
tends only forcing the same laws regarding enter
ing property as are in effect for other citizens.
Imagine the result should most of us spend a day
in a community unfamiliar with collegiate ways,
conducting ourselves as we do around the campus
or even in Palo Alto. About the second time we
jumped on the back of a street car. tore down a
Coca-Cola sign from a cigar store, passed a worth
less check, whistled and shouted in the movies, or
did the thousand and one other things for which a
student is forgiven in his own community, we should
find ourselves behind bars or paying a substantial
tine.
The other day someone cited the English method
of dealing with law-breakers as advisable for adop
tion at Stanford. The odd part of it is, that sug
gestion came from a student who objected to Uni
versity interference with his actions.
We get away with more open violation of laws
and customs than practically any other group of in
dividuals. To encourage such violation on the
grounds of intellectual superiority or the realization
pf individual independence would be a revolutionary
doctrine. So, on that score, let nothing be said.
But it behooves those who appreciate the exten
sion of liberties granted college students, to pay
some attention to a warning such as Dr. Barrow has
issued. Let's not take advantage of a good thing.
