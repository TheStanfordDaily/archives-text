# EAVESDROPPING
## 
### 
The eavesdropper is regarded with contempt. We
have little sympathy with one who gets information
by snooping. The dictaphone performs the act far
more artistically. Yes; and we are afraid to have
sprue of what we say overheardâ€”mayhap repeated.
A natural, and oftentimes very practical, fear.
I Jut many of us would surely profit by eavesdrop
ping. Not the gum-shoe kind; not the morbidly
curious sort, but the natural overhearing of conver
sations not particularly meant for, nor yet denied to,
our cars. Not an undue amount of inquisitive audi
tory attention to the impersonal talk of others would
add appreciably to our store of understanding, our
knowledge of what others arc thinking.
( all this the conversation selfish, in which we par
take of the mental possessions of others, giving noth
ing in return but a discreet yet forced silence. Not
much to give. Hut by selection we may retain a
great deal for ourselves.
Eavesdropping need not be contemptible.
