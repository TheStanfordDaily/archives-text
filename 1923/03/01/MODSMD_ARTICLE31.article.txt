## COLLEGIATES CONFIDENTIAL WHILE ACQUIRING BEAUTY (An exclusive interview) 
### Angus McAnguish 
Above the marble-plated door that leads into the ex
clusive barber and tonsorial dispensary, there's a sign
that reads: "Stanford Men's Beauty Parlor; Does Your
Money Bother You? Let Us Relieve You." And behind
the sign that's on the door there's a neat cash register
and a row of chairs.
Besides giving haircuts and hairtonics, the owner of
this campus beauty shop, Mr. Oscar Blumph, meets a
good many men, and knows quite a bit (of scandal)
about college people.
"College men aren't as vain as older men," says
Blumph. The ad that reads "Ask the Man that Owns
One" does not seem to bother the college man when he
lacks a haircut. It is only when he gets older and
can't get one if he does want it, that he decides he wants
to look like he did in college."
According to Blumph, the tonsorial tabernacle is the
place where one can hear a good deal of confidential
bushwah, and, occasionally, chatter.
"Give me an -extra good neck shave," says an excited
young thing. I'm queening a girl I've never been out
with before, and I don't want her to —er —feel I'm rough.
And you know, Hortense has been going with Buck all
winter, ever since the first frost, and he is going to tbe
dance. Bet he tries to trip me up because my pants are
too long."
Sometimes the young men aren't in such a happy
frame of mind.
"You know, Petunia and I had a fight last night," says
the down-hearted college lad. "She thought I said her
father was an old egg, and I didn't say he was old at all.
When I tried to explain, she wouldn't even listen to me.
Aren't girls funny?"
Blumph says as far as he knows, only one girl
has been in the tonsorial tabernacle. One day a Stanford
lass came in and said, "D'yuh think I'd look good with
my hair bobbed?"
"No," replied the proprietor, "I don't think even that
could help any."
Whereupon the young lady banged the door and fled
downstairs.
