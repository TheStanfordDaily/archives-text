## STANFORD'S FORFEITURE 
### 
The old argument of commercialism in athletics is
ever with us. Consequently it is a significant disprove
ment of that contention when we have at hand an inci
dent such as the recent action of Stanford in forfeiting
the fifth basketball game to the Varsity.
The act, of course, was one of good sportsmanship. It
serves as another illustration of the type of relations
existent between Stanford and California. Stanford has
already lost the series to the Varsity. Therefore she
gracefully admitted that California had the better team.
This has been of importance to the Varsity in that it
has been able to concentrate on the coming northern
series instead of having to go through the strain of an
other Stanford contest. The University and the team
recognize this and appreciate the forfeiture.
To the public another phase of Stanford's action is
more significant. The playing of a fifth game, presum
ably on a neutral court, would have been a great draw
ing card under the close competitive circumstances.
Both universities would have made a considerable sum
of money on a purely competitive basis without regard
for the financial end of it. The facts of the case prove
this by concrete example.
For years, more or less authentic instances of the so
called commercialism in athletics have been circulated
throughout the country. As such accusations are gener
ally made highly sensational, the public receives a wrong
impression more often than it does a correct one. The
unfortunate consequences to athletics are obvious. There
fore the action of Stanford carries significant weight. To
those who know athletics, it is but an instance of true
conditions; to the uneducated public it is a conclusive
refutation of much of the current propaganda.—(The
Daily California!!.)
