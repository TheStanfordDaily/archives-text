# Leveling Democracy
## UPSTREAM 
### Ludwig Lewisholm 
If any book can stimulate undergradu
ate students to a train of constructive
thought, the foremost one of the year
is "Upstream," by Ludwig Lewisohn. It
is listed in the publisher's catalogue as an
autobiography. This may be a sub-title
discouraging to students ploughing
through assigned reading and required
texts. But if the title page is once
passed, the track beyond is stimulating
as well as readable.
The book details the personality-de
stroying methods of Democracy and
Americanization. It is a too true de
lineation of our smug pseudo-culture, our
money-chasing scheme of life.
Lewisohn's discussion on the Business
of Education should be forcibly read to
every matriculating freshman. He might
then comprehend dimly the real scope of
education. He might realize that a uni
versity is not primarily a place to learn
how to build bridges, cure disease and
teach French, but a place to help one
to be.
"If I understand this ethos rightly,"
says Lewisohn, after years of professor
ship, "it holds that the aim and end of
life is happiness in terms of blameless
prosperity. American youth has no re
bellion or curiosities or yearnings. Their
inner lives are supremely poverty-strick
en. Whatever feeble spark of person
ality might smoulder here and there is
smothered out by the morals and beliefs
of the mass-life."
There is a strain of bitterness and
pessimism in the delicately balanced and
colorful prose. But we are forced to
admit that the picture he draws of me
chanical, unemotional America is funda
mentally accurate. Materialism is devas
tating America. What is the remedy?
