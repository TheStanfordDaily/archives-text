# Roble Rambles Right On Regardless of Rumors

"Five Hundred at Stanford Are
Poisoned; One 111; Two Go To
Class!"
Such, if at all, might be the
headline appearing in city papers
this evening, it' credence were
given to rumors of the big poison
ing scene supposed to be enacted
at Roble Hall last night. However,
like the big strychnine scene from
Hamlet, there was apparently
something rotten in Denmark.
Conspiracy, foul play, or what
ever you call it when the plot
thickens to the right consistency,
appears to the casual eye to have
had a lot to do with the events
which were blamed onto a few in
nocent apricots at Roble last night.
Mayor McSwiney, when called
on a special wire at an early hour
this morning, did not say that he
believed the whole thing to be a
subterfuge on the part of thirty
young ladies to get out of going
to Thursday classes; however,
there are those who believe he
was only spoofing, and blame his
answer on the heat rather than
the humidity.
Dr. T. M. Williams, who was
called into consultation when the
committee of thirty declared for
ptomaine, has announced that the
cases are far from serious; how
ever, there were some marked ab
sences, and a few unmarked, in
classes this morning; the major
ity seems to agree that there
really was something to the agita
tion against peaches.
None of the women have been
sent home or to hospitals; and
none of the cases threatens any
serious developments.
