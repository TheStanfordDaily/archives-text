# Lagunita Has Frigid Lure for Swimmers
## 
### 
Spring sports have now come into
their own on Every after
noon at almost any hour canoers, queen
ers, swimmers, and freezers can be seen
going through their paces. On Saturdays
and Sundays the banks of the lake take
on the appearance of a regular summer
resort, while the waiting list for canoes
is nearly as long as the bawl-out.
Some of the more hardy of the ath
letes, male and female, try swimming
and diving at odd intervals, but the
swir/ming intervals are very short and
the divers enter the water as close to
shore as possible due to the arctic-like
condition of the liquid.
Since the weather man has forecasted
a clear sky and a large moon during the
next few evenings, it is rumored that
the night hawks are due to have their
day.
