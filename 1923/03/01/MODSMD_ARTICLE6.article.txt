# BABE NINE DEFEATS OAKLAND HIGH. 6-0
## 
### Bill Wright, '25 
The Stanford 1926 baseball team ad
ministered a 6 to 0 defeat to the Oakland
High School yesterday afternoon on the
freshman diamond, largely because it
was the first game of the year for the
Oaklanders. This fact overbalanced sev
eral colossal instances of sleep-walking
on the part of the babes and allowed
| them to give Ernie Nevers the victory
he deserved.
Nevers established a freshman record
for the year of sixteen strikeouts, issued
no bases on balls, and permitted but two
hits, one of which was of the scratch
variety. Wallace drove a ball into deep
second base which Smith fielded cleanly
but could not complete, and in the ninth
inning Quayle, the diminutive Oakland
shortstop, smacked out a clean triple be
tween left and center. Outside of these
the high school men were turned back.
The six Stanford runs came in pairs.
Smith drew a pass to open the game,
stoe second, and made the rest of the
trip when Green boosted the ball over left
field for three sacks. He scored a mo
ment later when Hughes pitched a "sky
ball" over the catcher's head. Meikle
john, who had walked and stolen, took
third on the same heave, but the hext
three men went out and left him stranded.
In the second column, the first two
men were easy outs. Nevers then poked
one to Quayle, who made an overthrow
of first, which took the big fellow around
to second. He reached third when Smith
singled and stole second. Green then
placed a hit just behind the inner de
fense and both men crossed the rubber.
Oakland almost had a chance in the
fifth. Geiser fanned and Wallace got his
lucky hit. Andrews then bounced one to
Nevers, and the babes turned it into a
double play via Smith and Draper. A
Stanford rally went glimmering in the
next, when Sherrill was safe on an error
and mistakenly took second base on a
pop fly to the infield.
The final brace of Stanford counters
fame in the seventh episode. Dickey
walked and gained second on Nevers'
Texas leaguer to center. "Barney" then
gathered up his heels and stole third,
leaving Nevers to follow him to the key
stone sack. With two runners in scoring
position the next two batsmen went in
the hole, but Meiklejohn came through
with a scratch single which carried them |
over the hump. Meiklejohn was forced
at second on McDermont's grounder.
Kohler hit safely to open the eighth,
and stole second. Murphy fanned and
Lucas laid out a single to center field.
With a score in plain sight, Kohler made
a pass at third base and then scuttled
madly through the pitcher's box, missing
the inconvenient but essential process of
tagging third by a generous twenty feet
The Oakland team very excusably went
into a trance, but came out of it in
plenty of time to slaughter the score
that might have been. Lucas caught
some of the spirit and tried to steal third,
but failed by a considerable margin. Oh,
wellâ€”the babes had the game won, any
how.
The only incident after this was
Quayle's triple in the ninth, which came
with two out and didn't mean anything.
The game showed just one thing very
clearly, and that was that the 1926 team
will have to stop easing up with a com

fortable lead tucked away, or there will
be plenty of trouble when the hard teams
begin to show up. For two innings or so
the dinks go after it, but three or four
runs tend to make them take things too
easy.
