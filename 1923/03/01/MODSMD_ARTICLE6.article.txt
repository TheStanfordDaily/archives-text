# BABE NINE DEFEATS OAKLAND HIGH. 6-0
## 
### Bill Wright, '25 
The Stanford 1926 baseball team ad
ministered a 6 to 0 defeat to the Oakland
High School yesterday afternoon on the
freshman diamond, largely because it
was the first game of the year for the
Oaklanders. This fact overbalanced sev
eral colossal instances of sleep-walking
on the part of the babes and allowed
| them to give Ernie Nevers the victory
he deserved.
Nevers established a freshman record
for the year of sixteen strikeouts, issued
no bases on balls, and permitted but two
hits, one of which was of the scratch
variety. Wallace drove a ball into deep
second base which Smith fielded cleanly
but could not complete, and in the ninth
inning Quayle, the diminutive Oakland
shortstop, smacked out a clean triple be
tween left and center. Outside of these
the high school men were turned back.
The six Stanford runs came in pairs.
Smith drew a pass to open the game,
stoe second, and made the rest of the
trip when Green boosted the ball over left
field for three sacks. He scored a mo
ment later when Hughes pitched a "sky
ball" over the catcher's head. Meikle
john, who had walked and stolen, took
third on the same heave, but the hext
three men went out and left him stranded.
In the second column, the first two
men were easy outs. Nevers then poked
one to Quayle, who made an overthrow
of first, which took the big fellow around
to second. He reached third when Smith
singled and stole second. Green then
placed a hit just behind the inner de
fense and both men crossed the rubber.
Oakland almost had a chance in the
fifth. Geiser fanned and Wallace got his
lucky hit. Andrews then bounced one to
Nevers, and the babes turned it into a
double play via Smith and Draper. A
Stanford rally went glimmering in the
next, when Sherrill was safe on an error
and mistakenly took second base on a
pop fly to the infield.
The final brace of Stanford counters
fame in the seventh episode. Dickey
walked and gained second on Nevers'
Texas leaguer to center. "Barney" then
gathered up his heels and stole third,
