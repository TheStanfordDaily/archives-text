# Professor E.A. Cottrell Returns From Convention
## 
### 
Professor E. A. Cottrell of the Politi
cal Science department returned yester
day from Santa Cruz, where he attended
the American Convention of California
Association of Commercial Secretaries.
Monday morning was devoted to state
matters, principally of the California
highways. Mr. H. N. Toy, chairman of
the State Highway Commission, spoke
to the members. He explained the fu
ture program of highway development,
and made a plea for a gasoline tax of
2 cents per gallon.
The program of the new highway com
mission is to build essential trunk lines.
The main entrances to the state will be
completed first and then attention will
be paid to scenic highways. It has been
shown by statistics that the highways
were not systematic before, for of the
$68,000,000 invested in hard surface roads
only $20,000,000 were for through high
ways.
Professor Cottrell spoke Tuesday on
the question of the state survey of agri
culture and industrial conditions.
He explained to the secretaries the
need of a survey as a means of fact in
formation. Statistics would be an aid to
state publicity and would put questions
on a fact basis instead of the tvpe of
publicity pamphlets now in use."
