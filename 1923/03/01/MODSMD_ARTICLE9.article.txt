# CARDINAL NINE BEATS CLIFF IRELAND'S TEAM
## 
### 
Cliff Ireland made his farewell bow of
the season on the Farm yesterday after
noon after the Stanford varsity nine had
treated his Independents to a 12-8 beat
ing in the weirdest ball game seen on the
local diamond this year.
Hard hitting and erratic fielding fea
tured the contest. Clark, who started on
the mound for the Card nine, was hit
freely, as was Manauk of the Inde
pendents, but flashes of fast fielding
helped Clark in the pinches.
Captain Claude Peavy, with a four-ply
swat and a double, and "Bus" Mc-
Candless, wfth a pair of doubles and a
single, were the heavy stickers for the
Cardinals. In the fifth inning, Peavy
sent a hot one to the right field fence
with the bases full and four runs count
ed. In the next inning, with the bases
choked the Card skipper doubled, send
ing Heckendorf, McCandless, and Carver
in.
Coach Wolter's team started the fire
works in the second frame and got away
to a two-run lead. Deffebach was safe
when Anfinson dropped the ball on the
third strike. McCandless doubled and
Deffebach went to third, scoring a min
ute later on Peavy's sacrifice fly to right
field. Clark scored McCandless with a
pretty single over second base.
The Independents came back in their
half of the third and evened the count
on a single, a triple, and an error. The
Cards took another two-run advantage
in their part of the third. With one out,

I Carver was safe on a fielder's choice.
Deffebach fanned and Carver stole sec
ond, scoring on McCandless' double.
Peavy was safe at first and McCandless
a third on Ratner's error. Anfinson
made a bad return to Manauk and Mc-
Candless counted.
Cliff's gang tallied one in each of the
next two frames and the count was
knotted at 4-4. Then Claude Peavy got
into action in the last of the fifth. With
the bases loaded, he drove a fast one to
right field, which would have been a
single or a double in any man's league.
Koenig let it go through and four runs
trickled across home plate.
The Irelands came within one run of
tying the score again in the sixth when
Armstrong bounced one over the left
field fence, sending Manauk and Monta
gue across ahead of him. One run didn't
look like enough of a lead to the Cardi
nals, so they stepped in and garnered
three more in their half of the sixth.
Heckendorf walked and went to third on
Carver's two-base hit. Deffebach
grounded out. McCandless walked and
the bases were again full, with Peavy
swinging the willow. This time his best
contribution was a long double to center
which was just lengthy enough to score j
Heckendorf, Carver, and McCandless..
Cliff's last run came in the first of the
eighth, when Armstrong doubled and
scored on McCandless' error. "Shorty"
Roberts had a little track meet all of his
own and incidentally scored the Cards'
last run in the last of the seventh. The
diminuitive shortstop singled to right and
Koenig juggled the ball. "Shorty"
reached third before the right fielder had
the ball back in his possession and start
ed for home. Koenig cut loose but An
finson let the pill go between his legs and
Roberts scored.
Cardinal rooters learned one thing at
the ball game yesterday, and that was
the fact that the varsity stickers can
contribute base hits when they are need
ed. They got thirteen safeties, six of
them for extra bases.
The score: R. H. E.
