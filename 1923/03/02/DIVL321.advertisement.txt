I The New Spring Hats
Add Character to Style
NAMES that have been associated for
generations with the art of fine Hat
making, both at home and abroad,
are worthily represented in our extensive
Spring display of Hats for Men and
j ! | Young Men.
Our customers are thus assured, not
only of correctness and quality, but also
of those slight but important modifica
tions which enable us to select for each
individual exactly the sort of Hat that is
most becoming to his type.

Nowhere else has the art of correct
fitting been more highly developed than j
in the Roos Stores, and nowhere else are
the values more worthy of serious con
sideration.
