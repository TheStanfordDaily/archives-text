# CARDINAL NINE TO CROSS BATS WITH ST. MARY'S VARSITY
## Stanford Has Even Chance to Win; Squad Can Hit Well And Field Work Improving 
### 
Stanford's varsity nine will encoun
ter its first college competition of the ;
season when the St. Mary's diamond
team invades the campus tomorrow
afternoon.
The Saints have a habit of turning
out some of the fastest college teams
In this section of the country and from
their early season record, this year's
squad is no exception. The Cards are
still smarting from the two defeats
handed them by the Phoenix lads last 1
year, and will be up and going for re- j
venge tomorrow. St. Mary's won last
year by scores of 9-5 and 4-1.
Cards Have Even Chances
In spite of the apparent strength of
the Oaklanders, the Cardinals should
I
stand an even chance of winning to-1
morrow. If Wolter's nine plays the
brand of ball it is capable of playing,
it will not be easy pickings for any col-!
lege or semi-professional team in the \
state.
The Cards still have a bad habit of
making boots at critical times, but l
they will undoubtedly get over this as
the season progresses. The box score j
of the last game which they won from
Ireland's Independents shows that they |
amassed a total of nine errors but
that is not so bad as it looks. Most of I
th<em were not costly.
Stanford Can Hit Well
Any bunch of hitters that can gather
thirteen safe hits off pitchers like;
Manauk and Reppe should make trou
ble for any moundsman. With Roberts, !
McCandless, Peavy, Carver, and Heck- i
endorf hitting in mid-season form, the
varsity nine presents a genuine "mur
derers' row."
Patterson, who has been out of the
game for a week with a bad finger may
be in shape tomorrow, and if he is, he I
will take his place behind the plate.
He has been playing bang-up ball,
handling the pitchers well, and has
been getting his share of the bingles. j
If Patterson is unable to play, Fuller
or Huneke will probably substitute.
The choice for mound duty lies be
tween Teague, Solomon, and Lowen
stein, with the odds in favor of Teague.!
The little fellow has been pitching
good ball and his underhand delivery
seems to be a puzzle to opposing
stickers.
The best infield combination seems
to include Woodward at first, Peavy at
second, Heckendorf at third, .and Rob-;
erts at short. This aggregation shows
(lashes of brilliant baseball at times,
and is steadily developing into a
smooth-working, fast machine.
Deffebach, Carver, and McCandless
seem to have the first call on the out
field positions. All of these men have
been gathering in the long ones satis
factorily and each has been doing well
wtih the stick.
The game is scheduled to begin at
3 o'clock.

still smarting from the two defeats
handed them by the Phoenix lads last 1
year, and will be up and going for re- j
venge tomorrow. St. Mary's won last
year by scores of 9-5 and 4-1.
Cards Have Even Chances
In spite of the apparent strength of
the Oaklanders, the Cardinals should
I
stand an even chance of winning to-1
morrow. If Wolter's nine plays the
brand of ball it is capable of playing,
it will not be easy pickings for any col-!
lege or semi-professional team in the \
state.
The Cards still have a bad habit of
making boots at critical times, but l
they will undoubtedly get over this as
the season progresses. The box score j
of the last game which they won from
Ireland's Independents shows that they |
amassed a total of nine errors but
that is not so bad as it looks. Most of I
th<em were not costly.
Stanford Can Hit Well
Any bunch of hitters that can gather
thirteen safe hits off pitchers like;
Manauk and Reppe should make trou
ble for any moundsman. With Roberts, !
McCandless, Peavy, Carver, and Heck- i
endorf hitting in mid-season form, the
varsity nine presents a genuine "mur
derers' row."
Patterson, who has been out of the
game for a week with a bad finger may
be in shape tomorrow, and if he is, he I
will take his place behind the plate.
He has been playing bang-up ball,
handling the pitchers well, and has
been getting his share of the bingles. j
If Patterson is unable to play, Fuller
or Huneke will probably substitute.
The choice for mound duty lies be
tween Teague, Solomon, and Lowen
stein, with the odds in favor of Teague.!
The little fellow has been pitching
good ball and his underhand delivery
seems to be a puzzle to opposing
stickers.
The best infield combination seems
to include Woodward at first, Peavy at
second, Heckendorf at third, .and Rob-;
erts at short. This aggregation shows
(lashes of brilliant baseball at times,
and is steadily developing into a
smooth-working, fast machine.
Deffebach, Carver, and McCandless
seem to have the first call on the out
field positions. All of these men have
been gathering in the long ones satis
factorily and each has been doing well
wtih the stick.
The game is scheduled to begin at
3 o'clock.
Stanford's varsity nine will encoun
ter its first college competition of the ;
season when the St. Mary's diamond
team invades the campus tomorrow
afternoon.
The Saints have a habit of turning
out some of the fastest college teams
In this section of the country and from
their early season record, this year's
squad is no exception. The Cards are

venge tomorrow. St. Mary's won last
