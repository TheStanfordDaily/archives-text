# FRESHMAN DIAMOND TEAM TO MIX WITH FAST OAKLAND NINE
## 
### 
With the memory of yesterday's]
sophomore-freshman tilt staring them j
in the face, the 1926 baseballers will go j
up against the Oakland Technical High
School tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 with
a resolution to turn over a new leaf. It
is fortunate that the babes enjoyed their
off-day while pitted against a Stanford
team, for the kind of baseball played
yesterday would enable almost any vis
iting team to run themselves exhausted
around the base lines.
Ditzler is now attending classes and
there is a bare possibility that he will
be strong enough to do his stuff on the
mound. Oviatt worked against the
sophomores yesterday, so Hunt's choice
of a twirler will lie between Nevers and
Ditzler. Kohler will in all probability
be found behind the plate.
The Varsity-St. Mary's game tomor
row afternoon brings up a surprise. Ne
gotiations had been made for a game
with St. Mary's Prep, and the babes took
a 12 to 10 trimming. It then came out
that the team was the St. Mary's sec
ond varsity instead of the Preps, and
Coach Hunt feels quite a bit better 1 over
the defeat.
