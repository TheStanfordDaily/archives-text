# SOPHOMORES DEFEAT FRESHMEN BY 15-2 IN BASEBALL GAME
## 
### 
The sophomores annihilated the fresh
men in the first game of the interclass
baseball series yesterday afternoon, 15-2.
After the sophomores were at bat the
j first time, the game developed into a
friendly contest between their sluggers
|as to who should garner the most runs.
The 1926 nine started the first inning
all right by gathering in one run, but
'25 came back with three runs in their
l half that destroyed the first-year men's
morale for the rest of the game. Law
son knocked out a homer with Roberts
jon base for the first two scorers, and Mc
| Candless brought in the third a moment
later on Teague's two-bagger.
In the second inning, Roberts got a
homer, but the bases were clear.
McCandless made his run in the third
!on Follansbee's hit. Roberts and Law
son both scored again in the fourth.
Teague made his run in the fifth, and the
| score was 8-1. ,
The freshmen had a good chance to
| score in the sixth, when with one out,
I they got men to third and second. Ayde
| lotte came through, however, struck out
the next man, and the third was out on
a pop fly. In the second half, Roberts
and McCandless both scored again.
Lovelace made the only run for the
freshmen in the seventh. He walked,
stole second and third, and got home on
I Lucas' hit. This inning, Mulchay and
Aydelotte made their runs. Total to
date, 12-2.
In the eighth, Solomon, Follansbee and
Hadley, who had replaced Wilston be
hind the plate, made their runs. In their
half of the ninth the freshmen were un
able to see the ball, and the game ended,
15-2.
Oviat, who started pitching for the
freshmen, with a little support, would
probably have been able to hold the
score down, but the infield and outlield
seemed unacquainted wit hthe feeling of
a ball in their gloves and dropped it
every time it came near.
