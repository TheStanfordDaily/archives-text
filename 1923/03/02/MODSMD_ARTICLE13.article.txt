# Tales of University Nursery Are Recounted By Irish Watchman
## 
### 
"Here comes a truckload of bamboos.
There is going to be a dance some place
on the campus tonight," pipes out one
of the members of the "Five Hundred."
It's true that nearly everybody has
some idea about where the bamboos arc
going, but very few people know where
they come from. These boxed plants
that are used for decorations at dances,
teas, and receptions come from the Uni
versity nursery, a tenacre plot of ground
that can he reached by wandering just
a little down a crooked path that leads
from the cactus garden, or by climbing
over a fence that's not very far from
the back of the Medical buildings.
Rose bushes, yellow jonquils, tall dark
pines, straight popiars, low white shacks,
vine-covered roofs, and straggling paths
make the nursery look like an Trish ham
let. And the man who lives in one of
the small houses on these grounds is
named Patrick Murphy.
Murphy says that in the early "eighties"
the land that surrounds the nursery was
a large vineyard. Between 500 and 600
men ploughed the fields, worked in the
winery, and prepared the wine for ship
ping to France. The dairy-barn on the
Stanford Farm was part of the winery.
The nursery is forty years old. At
present there arc three gardeners who
take care of the grounds for experimental
work and treat the flowers and plants
that are used for social affairs on the

campus. Besides these three men, there
are two Chinese who have worked on
the place for about forty years.
With the exception of one new struc
ture, all the shacks and greenhouses arc
as old as the University nursery. There
are trees from almost every country in
Europe and Asia that were planted in
the nursery when it was first started.
"I've been here for three years," said
Murphy. "I've been all over the continent,
too. I was in Alaska during the gold
rush. Many's the day I've shoveled for
gold in the stream with my boss stand
ing iti back, watching to see that none
of the men picked up any of the gold. Tt
was a penitentiary offense to stoop to
pick up anything while you were work
ing. Said T to myself, 'The next nugget
that comes along I'm going to have for
a souvenir.' So I dropped a piece of
tobacco in the stream and hauled it out
along with a piece of gold. Then the
boss came over to me and said, 'Hey,
Murphy, what arc you picking up?'
"You know the gold from every stream
is different—little lighter, darker, or yel
lower, and T had several pieces in my
pocket from some other streams. So I
pulled them all out—the piece from this
stream with them. Then said T, 'Ts this
any of your gold ?'
"Course he asked my pardon and
walked away. Next day T quit. Plenty
of work up there in that country, and
men were scarce."

Murphy, what arc you picking up?'
"You know the gold from every stream
is different—little lighter, darker, or yel
lower, and T had several pieces in my
pocket from some other streams. So I
pulled them all out—the piece from this
stream with them. Then said T, 'Ts this
any of your gold ?'
"Course he asked my pardon and
walked away. Next day T quit. Plenty
of work up there in that country, and
men were scarce."
"Here comes a truckload of bamboos.
There is going to be a dance some place
on the campus tonight," pipes out one
of the members of the "Five Hundred."
It's true that nearly everybody has
some idea about where the bamboos arc
going, but very few people know where
they come from. These boxed plants
that are used for decorations at dances,
teas, and receptions come from the Uni
versity nursery, a tenacre plot of ground
that can he reached by wandering just
a little down a crooked path that leads
from the cactus garden, or by climbing
over a fence that's not very far from
the back of the Medical buildings.
Rose bushes, yellow jonquils, tall dark
pines, straight popiars, low white shacks,
vine-covered roofs, and straggling paths
make the nursery look like an Trish ham
let. And the man who lives in one of
the small houses on these grounds is
named Patrick Murphy.
Murphy says that in the early "eighties"
the land that surrounds the nursery was
a large vineyard. Between 500 and 600
men ploughed the fields, worked in the
winery, and prepared the wine for ship
ping to France. The dairy-barn on the
Stanford Farm was part of the winery.
The nursery is forty years old. At
present there arc three gardeners who
take care of the grounds for experimental
work and treat the flowers and plants
that are used for social affairs on the

campus. Besides these three men, there
are two Chinese who have worked on
the place for about forty years.
With the exception of one new struc
ture, all the shacks and greenhouses arc
as old as the University nursery. There
are trees from almost every country in
Europe and Asia that were planted in
the nursery when it was first started.
"I've been here for three years," said
Murphy. "I've been all over the continent,
too. I was in Alaska during the gold
rush. Many's the day I've shoveled for
gold in the stream with my boss stand
ing iti back, watching to see that none
of the men picked up any of the gold. Tt
was a penitentiary offense to stoop to
pick up anything while you were work
ing. Said T to myself, 'The next nugget
that comes along I'm going to have for
a souvenir.' So I dropped a piece of
tobacco in the stream and hauled it out
along with a piece of gold. Then the
boss came over to me and said, 'Hey,
Murphy, what arc you picking up?'
