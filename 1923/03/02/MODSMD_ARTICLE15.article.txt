# MARATHON TEAMS ARE READY TO START RUN
## Fast Laps and Close Races Are Expected in Meet Saturday on Oval 
### 
Four class teams have been chosen! 1
and are ready to start on the long six-; 1
mile relay grind around the Stanford !
oval tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 in the j
annual Irish marathon. There are
twenty-four men on each team and |
several alternates. All of the men whoj
will run have been timed at better!
than sixty seconds in the quarter mile.! ;
Although the seniors seem to have i
the edge on the dope, either the jun-!
iors or the sophomores may prove to j
be the best combination. Neither of
these classes have as many varsity |
quarter milers on their squads as the'
seniors, however, but they are depend-1
ing on the general high average of'
their teams to put them in the running.
The '23 class has won the marathon,
for the last two years and they are
anxious to record another win. Two of
the seniors' fastest men, Van Judali j
and Williamson, will run their laps in j
the early part of the race, and it re-,
mains to be seen whether the lower,
classes can overcome the lead which
the seniors will surely have after the j
first few laps have been run off.
The freshmen are not accorded much i
opportunity of winning. The team is;
weak in the quarter mile, although!
they have a number of men who will!
negotiate speedy laps. \
Every man who expects to run in;
the marathon should be in a suit and
on the track by 1:15. This is necessary
in order that the teams may have their
pictures taken and obtain their num
bers before the start of the holdover
show.
A number of novelty races, including
a three-legged race, 100 yards back-;
wards, a quarter-mile walk, and a pig j
race are scheduled to take place after
the marathon. Prizes of $2.50 in mer-
j chandise have been offered by Wide
i man's, Roos Bros., and Frazer's ill
Palo Alto, for the winners of the nov
elty races.
The men who record the best varsity
and non-varsity laps in the marathon
will win Quadrangle Club awards. The
afternoon's activities will be run off
under the auspices of the Quadrangle
Club and the twenty-five cent entrance
fee will go to this organization.
