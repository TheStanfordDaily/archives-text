### 
Stanford's boxing and wrestling
teams are ready for the return match
es with Davis Farm tonight in Bncina
Gymnasium. The mat mix-ups will
start promptly at 7:30 and will be fol
lowed by the boxing bouts. The men
are all in good condition and Maloney
expects that they will give a much
better account of themselves than
when they last met the farmers.
The upset in the dope for Stanford
came when Chang, the 115-pound
wrestler, was announced ineligible.
Meyers, the other 115-pound grappler.
is overweight and no one else can bt>
found to represent Stanford in this
class, so the coaches have agreed to
eliminate the 115-pound match, as it is
not required by the conference rules.
The 125-pouiul class? wlil be taken
care of by Sturm, a letter man in
wrestling. Kramer will be his oppon
ent. When these two met before, thft
Davis man won a fall. Sturm expects
to turn the tables tonight, however-
One of the best matches of the eve
ning is expected to .be between Hose
pian of Stanford and Harper of Davis.
Hosepian was able to secure a fall in
the first Davis match over this man.
Hosepian is Pacific intercollegiato
champion and has a thorough knowl
edge of wrestling which will give him.
a considerable advantage.
Sievers will represent Stanford in
the 145-pound class against W. GUl
dings, the Davis grappler. Sievers is
one of Stanford's best bets and is sure
to give a good account of himself.
Woodhead and S. Giddings will put on
a close contest in the 158-pound class.
In the last meet these two men went
the time limit, neither man securing a
fall.
Nickolson of Stanford and Kershaw
of the visitors will grapple in the 175-
pound class. In lhe last match Nickol
son threw Kessler in a little more
than two minutes. In the heavyweight
class Whitney of Stanford and Healey
of Davis will meet.
In the 115-pound boxing event the
Cards will be represented by Hard
and Davis by Barnard. These men are
evenly matched and should put on a
fast exhibition. Barnard was given the
decision in the first meet.
Armbruster will uphold the Cardi
nal against Miller of Davis in the
125-pound class. This is his first bout
for Stanford.
One of the best bouts will take place
when the 135-pounders meet, and a
grudge of long standing will be settled.
Last year Jimmie Ross of Stanford got
a decision from Gerson of Davis. Ger
son has been training continually since
then to defeat Ross and he will have
his chance tonight.
Ross is going great this year, how
ever, and is easily capable of giving
the Aggie man the surprise of his life, j
Jimmie has been helping Maloney train
the new men all year and is in the
pink of condition.
Johnnie Lane should give Banta a
good trouncing in the 145-pound class.
Lane is the other experienced man on
the team besides Ross, and he, like
Jimmie, is going stronger than ever
this season.
Jake Irwin will meet Johnson in the
158-pound bout. Irwin is one of the
cleverest boxers 011 the Stanford team
and came through with a win in the
last meet with Davis without a great
deal of trouble.
Van Hook of Stanford and Hagen of
Davis will be seen in the light heavy
weight division. These two boxers met
in the last meet, although on that oc
casion they were both in the heavy
weight class. Hagen secured a decision
over Hook, but the Stanford boxer put
up a hard fight and lost only in the
last round when the farmer got
through his guard for a few blows. Van
Hook has been working hard ever
since and hopes to even matters with
the Davis man tonight. Van Hook can
stand more punishment than anyone
else on the team, which is a big point
in his favor.
Robinson will fight Healey of Davis
in the heavyweight division. Robinson
!is fighting his first match for the
Cards tonight, and will do his best to
start with a win. Little is known of
the comparative merits of these two
men and so nothing can be said of how

they stack up with each other.
A1 Williams, who has been instruct
ing wrestling at the Olympic Club, will
refree the grappling contests, while
Jim Richardson, who is connected with
Spaulding's in San Francisco, will
referee the bouts. W. D. Plowden and
: Mart Blackburn will be the judges, Joe
Murphy will time for Stanford, Jimmie
Broz will be the recorder, while Tucker
will do the announcing.

a decision from Gerson of Davis. Ger

the new men all year and is in the
pink of condition.
