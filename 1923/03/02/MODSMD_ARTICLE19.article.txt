### 
Stanford's boxing and wrestling
teams are ready for the return match
es with Davis Farm tonight in Bncina
Gymnasium. The mat mix-ups will
start promptly at 7:30 and will be fol
lowed by the boxing bouts. The men
are all in good condition and Maloney
expects that they will give a much
better account of themselves than
when they last met the farmers.
The upset in the dope for Stanford
came when Chang, the 115-pound
wrestler, was announced ineligible.
Meyers, the other 115-pound grappler.
is overweight and no one else can bt>
found to represent Stanford in this
class, so the coaches have agreed to
eliminate the 115-pound match, as it is
not required by the conference rules.
The 125-pouiul class? wlil be taken
care of by Sturm, a letter man in
wrestling. Kramer will be his oppon
ent. When these two met before, thft
Davis man won a fall. Sturm expects
to turn the tables tonight, however-
One of the best matches of the eve
ning is expected to .be between Hose
pian of Stanford and Harper of Davis.
Hosepian was able to secure a fall in
the first Davis match over this man.
Hosepian is Pacific intercollegiato
champion and has a thorough knowl
edge of wrestling which will give him.
a considerable advantage.
Sievers will represent Stanford in
the 145-pound class against W. GUl
dings, the Davis grappler. Sievers is
one of Stanford's best bets and is sure
to give a good account of himself.
