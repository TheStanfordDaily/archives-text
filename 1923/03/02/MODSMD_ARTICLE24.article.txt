# A 						TRADITION WITH MERIT
## 
### 
The Irish Marathon and the Holdover Show have
become one of the annual traditions to which old
students invariably look forward. It is an after
noon of genuine entertainment, combined with one
of the most desirable features of college athletics —
the participation by a large number of students in
competitive sport.
The Marathon enables men whom natural ability
or use of time prevents from becoming members of
varsity teams to take part in a contest with their
fellow-students which makes no unusual demands.
Several times in the past the Marathon has been the
means of discovering runners capable of intercol
legiate competition who have been prevented by lack
of self-confidence or other reasons from going out
for the teams.
In addition, it has been a means of fostering
healthy class rivalry and enabling men to become
better acquainted with each other.
The Holdover Show, in addition to its purely
entertaining features, can and has proved a valuable
element in pointing out and correcting errors in the
manipulation of student affairs through the always
effective media of burlesque and satire.
Tomorrow afternoon's program is a distinctive
Stanford enterprise, and is one which will not be a
waste of time for any students who attend, if it
maintains the standard held in the past.
