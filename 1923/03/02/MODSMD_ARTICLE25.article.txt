# PRINCIPLE AND PREJUDICE
## 
### 
Individuals have died because they held the ad
herence to certain principles above the value of life.
Some have suffered worse than death. All were
convinced of the Tightness of their conceptions of
truth; many probably never questioned the source
of their motives. Freedom of the press and speech
were principals for which men struggled and en
dured.
A definition says that a principle is "a general
truth or proposition; a settled law or rule of action,
especially of right action." Consider a young
egotist: Says he,"I do not take out popular women,
because I believe them disinterested in men as indi
viduals, and only out for the best time possible."
Our tender cynic may regard this paralogy as a
"general truth." If he does, he is avoiding his Active
women crcaturcs because of what he believes a
principle. But may not the warp of his mental
fabric be mere prejudice?
Is it not probable that this young man's sad ex
periences with one or two members have brought
him to an unfortunate conclusion about a whole
group? If so, then he unwittingly confuses prin
ciple and prejudice. And lack of representative con
tact has done it.
It should prove interesting to check on ourselves,
discovering, if we could, in what instances we are
retaining prejudices, instead of principles.
