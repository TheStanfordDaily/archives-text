# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
Spring—it's here! Euphemistically speaking, sprig
has cub! The atmosphere grows warmer, amusements
become more diversified, the co-eds become good-looking.
Cabbages is always ready to congratulate, and what
better opportunity has ever presented itself. Congratu
lations, Spring! Congratulations, campus! Congratu
lations, co-eds!
♦ * *
Our idea of a total and comprehensive dumb-bell is the
bird who thinks Kratzenheimer can't run the Irish
Marathon.
* » *
We gladly hail the blithesome time of Spring
With birds and flowers and leaves and everything
The balmy warmth of fragrance-laden breezes
Turns hacking coughs into mere harmless sneezes.
Instead of finding snow up on the mountains
We find ourselves besprayed by deathless fountains
Of Love and Languor! Sleep and Cupid ride us.
A fervent snore! Or chosen maid beside us,
There is the Rose but "Study" is the Sting!

They were walking back from Lagunita on a late eve
ning in February—this present February. The chimes
tolled out from the majestic rustic clock-tower behind
the Stanford Quad. Suppressing an oath (you've heard
it before) the dainty damsel remarked:
"Oh, that's half-past ten and I'm locked out—that just
makes me wild!"
Whereupon the man in attendance, being an individual
who listened attentively to every conversation, retorted:
"Let's go back up to the lake!"
Ad there, in a manner of speaking, was that.

"I'm going on a still hunt," said the detective, preen
ing' his mustache. A day or two later he showed up
with a red nose, and when questioned said that he was
groping about in a cellar and ran into something.
* * *
A cocky little birdie with a vagrant roving -eye
Came up to me and hailed me with a look of do-or-die,
And asked me if the Stanford Quad was what it used to be
And why the old traditions lost their popularity.
I hauled off and I spoke to him and said "Now looky here—
We rave of lost traditions and we drope a silent tear,
The world do move, in spite of what Tradition says or does
The Quad ain't what it used tobbande —and boy, it never was!"
* * *
Well soaks I mean jokes I mean folks let's have a few
beers I mean tears I mean cheers! —WAMBA.

Kelly: Clancy's broke. He hasn't the price of a drink.
Harrigan: How do you know?
Kelly: He's not drinking!

The score was very even, according to the score
keeper. It was a tie.
* * *
Say, is she dumb? I offered her a Camel and she
thought I wanted to take her for a ride on the desert.
* * *
She thinks a tennis racket is a noise on a tennis court.
And she devoutly believes that O. Henry was the old
fashioned slang equivalent for the modern O. Hell!
♦ * *
Millie: What's a second story man?
Til I Ie: Search me, unless it's a novelist working on
his second serial.
* * *
An optimist may be a guy who changes his socks from
one foot to another so that his big toe won't stick out.
but we wager that a pessimist would say, "Let 'er stick."

Frosh: Haven't you some hair renewer for my mus
tache?
Barber: I think it's hair originator you want.
♦ * ♦
There's only one objection to a University Women's
orchestra. None of the women will play second fiddle.
* * •
We praised the blush on Beautie's cheek,
Last eve with words that tell,
The blush this morn, O wondrous freak.
Is here on our lapel.
• • *
Editor: This cartoon isn't shaded enough.
Cartoonist: Yes, but just wait till you see the joke
that goes with it.—P. K. R.
Cabbages is sorry to announce that the joke failed to
get by the censors.

become more diversified, the co-eds become good-looking.

We gladly hail the blithesome time of Spring
With birds and flowers and leaves and everything
The balmy warmth of fragrance-laden breezes
Turns hacking coughs into mere harmless sneezes.
Instead of finding snow up on the mountains

Of Love and Languor! Sleep and Cupid ride us.
A fervent snore! Or chosen maid beside us,

tolled out from the majestic rustic clock-tower behind

makes me wild!"
