Imagine a three-quarter-inch chan
nel bar steel bumper nosing up
against the rear of your car and
pushing with remorseless determina
tion. Imagine the tire-rack folding
up like an accordion and crunching
into the gas tank, which, pierced to

the pavement. Imagine the repair
bill.

car parked in the middle of the road
against the safety chains when there
happens to be an alarm of fire on the
Quad. Marshal Ed Lamb has in
structed his drivers to shove such ob
structionists off the road, and in an
encounter with a Seagrave fire truck
weighing plenty of tons the average
tinfoil coupe is bound to finish a poor
second. According to Lamb, a date
with a fire is too pressing to permit of
any detours on the way to the theater
of atcion.
