# Dr. Jordan Speaks on "What Is a University?"
## 
### 
"Hie business of a university is to
teach people to think and to think with
j enthusiasm," said Dr. Jordan, speaking
lon "What Is a University?" last night
at an informal gathering at his home.
Dr. Jordan traced university history in
the United States from the time Harvard
'was a single-story building on a small
plot of ground in the town square until
the present time. He believed that stan
dardization and sinecures are the great
est evils in the college curriculum, and
that advanced work is far more beneficial
j than elementary.
Dr. Jordan pointed out the difference
in educational methods at Oxford and
Cambridge and in German and Scotch
universities. Deploring the lack of cen
tralization in English universities, he ad
vocated their adoption of the American
fashion of bringing professors and stu
dents close together. This would pro
mote college spirit, the lack of which is
noticeable in all European universities.
"The university is greater than the
sum of all its parts," concluded Dr.
Jordan.
"The muddle in the Far East" will be
Dr. Jordan s subjects next Thursday
evening.
