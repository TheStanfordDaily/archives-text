# Old Boy Is Merry Over Contributions To Next Chaparral
## 
### 
The Old Boy was dusty yesterday.
Covered from head to foot with ancient
cobwebs, he stopped his wild pacing of
the sanctum floor long enough to poke
his head out the window, and splutter
forth a few grunts concerning the next
Chappie. In spite of his assumed air of
depression and gloom, a twinkle ap
peared in the left lamp of the Old Boy.
After a few preliminary splutters, he
said that the next issue of Chappie will
be the Pre-Historic Number, and will
go on sale about March 12. At this point,
with a mysterious wink, he disappeared,
only to return a few moments later,
bearing in his hand a long list. Again,
he was reduced to sheer joy. He pro
claimed in loud declamatory sentences
that it was the list of the alumni con
tributors to the Pre-Historic issue. In
cluded were such famous names as Bris
tow Adams, Wallace Irwin, Charles
Field, "Feg" Murray, Tom Kleckner,
and a host of others.
