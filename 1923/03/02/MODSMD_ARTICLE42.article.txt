# Force of Public Opinion Discussed by Legislator

### 
"The legislature follows public opin
ion; it does not lead it," said Senator
Herbert C. Jones, '02, of the California
state Legislature, discussing legislative
problems before the Law Association
last night in the Little Theater. "Laws
are a result of the pressure of public
opinion, and the best legislator is the
one who can best guess what the public
wants. Universities .and schools have
more influence on public opinion than
anything else," he declared.
"There is an increasing tendency to
ward paternalism in modern government
legislation," Senator Jones continued,
"which is shown in the growing sphere
of government regulation and control."
Legitimate subjects for state legislation,
according to the speaker, are those which
the state can handle better than private
enterprise.
"The state today educates the young
men and women of the state along almost
every conceivable line. It licenses and
regulates almost every occupation and
profession," Senator Jones concluded.
