### 
Ereshman soccer players will meet the
Clan McDonald team in the final game
of the present season tomorrow after
noon on the varsity field. The game will
start at 3 o'clock.
The freshmen have gradually increased
their playing ability throughout the sea
son and now present their strongest line
up. The game tomorrow should show
the first-year men in their best form and
display the Stanford team as a smooth
working machine.
