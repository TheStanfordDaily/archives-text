# STANFORD TRI-STATE DEBATERS TO ARGUE PROHIBITION TONIGHT
## Cardinal Team Meets Washington Forensic Speakers On Campus And Oregonians At Eugene 
### 
Stanford's tri-state debaters will reach
the culmination of eight weeks' work
when they present their arguments on the
campus and at Eugene, Oregon tonight.
The Stanford speakers are primed and
ready to meet their opponents from the
Universities of Oregon and Washington.
Stanford will argue the negative side
of the question, "Resolved, That the
manufacture and sale of light wines and
beer should be legalized in the United
States," against the University of Ore
gon in the north. The Cardinal de
baters will support the normative side
of the same question against the Uni
versity of Washington in the Little
Theater this evening at 8 o'clock.
Claude Minard, '23, and Robert
Lewis, '23, compose Stanford's affirma
tive team. Lewis was a member of the
victorious triangular debate squad which
won from the University of Southern
California last fall, and is a member of
Nestoria Debating Society. Minard is
also a member of Nestoria. and liS s par
ticipated in intersociety debates. This
will be his first appearance in an inter
collegiate contest, however.

The members of Stanford's negative
team are Emmet McCaffery, '24, and
Thomas Bailey, '24. McCaffery,a Nes
torian, was a member of last year's tri
state team, but was forced to withdraw
on account of illness. Bailey was an
alternate on the triangular debate team
last fall. ,
The Washington sycakers who will
argue on the campus are Claude Wood
worth and Wendell Edhury.
Dean Kirkwood of the Stanford I.aw
School will preside over the debate. The
judges will be Professor Arnold Per
stein of the University of California,
Judge J. R. Welch of the Superior Court
in San Jose, and Robert Newton Lynch,
vice-president and general manager of
the San Francisco Chamber of Com
merce. Admission will be free.
According to Debating Adviser J. G.
Emerson, the debate should be valuable
as a digest of the propaganda for and
against prohibition. Agitation for light
wines and beer is being carried on all
over the country, and Nevada recently
has passed a statute repealing state aid
to federal prohibition.
