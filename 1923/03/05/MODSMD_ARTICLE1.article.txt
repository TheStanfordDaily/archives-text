# DAVIS AND STANFORD SPLIT MAT, RING MEET
## Cardinal Boxers Show Good Form; Invaders Exhibit Better Wrestling 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's boxers won
four out of seven bouts, while his I
wrestlers won but two matches in the
return meet with the California Aggies
held last Friday evening in Encina
gymnasium. The tables were complete
ly turned in this meet, as the Aggies j
won the boxing and lost the wrestling
in the first tourney.
Cardinal Captain Wins
Vaughn Hosepian, Stanford's wres
tling captain and coach, pinned Harper
on the mat in two minutes. Hosepian
took the offensive at the start in the
fastest match of the evening. He
worked fast, using a great variety of
holds. The fall was secured with a
combination body scissors and half nel-|
son.
Bill Giddings secured a fall over
Siever's downfall. Sterling Giddings
was given the decision over Woodhead
of Stanford in the 158-pound class. The
wrestlers were evenly matched, and
the bout was hard-fought during the
entire nine minutes.
Nickolson Wins Bout
Nickolson of Stanford threw Kress
ler in five minutes and forty seconds. J
Nickolson was easily the best, and
after the start of the match the win- i
ner was never in doubt. In the heavy-1
weight class, Whitney lost to Healey'
of the Aggies. The Davis grappler was
much heavier than the Cardinal man j
and Whitney could do little but try to
keep from benig pinned to the mat. He
put up a good fight, but the superior
weight and strength of the Aggie man
were too much for him, and the fall
was secured in four and a half min
utes.
Inaba won the 115-pound wrestling
bout from Sturm of Stanford, after
he had succeeded in staying on top
the greatest part of the match. Sturm's
only hold seemed to be a lieadlock,
and he could not secure a fall with it.
The 125-pound match went to Urqui
ola of the Aggies. Meyers, the Card
grappler, remained on the defensive
until the last two minutes. Then he se
cured a body scissors and arm hold 1
on Urquiola, and might have thrown
him had the match lasted a minute
longer.
Knockouts Feature Boxing
Mihle of California Aggies put Hard j
out by the knockout route in the mid
die of the second round in the first
boxing match of the evening. Hard,
could not keep his feet, and in the first
canto he was on the floor most of the
time. He took the count of seven once
and again the count of nine before the
round was over. Mihle knew more
about boxnig than did his oppnent,
and Hard could scarcely land a blow.
Armbruster of Stanford sent Miller
to the showers before the first round
was over. Miller started in with all the
confidence in the world, as he had de
feated the California 125-pound boxers
the week before. Armbruster let Miller
drive him against the ropes, and then
the Stanford boxer was back at Miller
like a rock hurled from a sling. He
landed about three good blows and
Miller was tired of boxing for the eve
ning, preferring to sleep on the canvas.
The big upset came in the 135-pound
class. Two years ago Jimmie Ross se
cured a decision from Gerson, and ever
since then the Aggie boxer has been
waiting for a chance to get even. He
had it last night, and followed up his
advantage, with the result that Ross
was easily outpointed. The Stanford
captain, although out of condition, held
Gerson for the first round. The latter
evened things up the second canto,
and then in the final round knocked
Ross all over the ring.
Lane Outpoints Opponent
Johnny Lane outpointed Johnson of
the California Aggies in their three
round fracas. Lane had things all his
own way throughout the bout. He
landed four wallops to every one of
Johnson's in the first round. Johnson
fought into clinches in the next two
rounds, but Lane got in a few lefts
and knocked him to the floor in the
third period.
In the middleweight class, Jake Ir
win gave an excellent exhibition of
boxing, and was given the decision
over Barth. Irwin didn't hurry matters,
but watched his chances and every
time Barth came in, stopped his pro
gress with a well-directed blow. Barth
started his swings miles away, and Ir
win had little difficulty In avoiding
most of them. The Davis boxer took a
lot of punishment in the first two
rounds and was able to give little op
position in the final period. From his
work Friday, Irwin showed himself to
be one of Maloney's best boxers.
In the last bout of the evening Van
Hook started out well, landing the
first few blows. Then Hagen got going
and held the Stanford boxer off during
the rest of the round. In the second
period Van Hook landed two blows to
the head, but Hagen sent him a hay
maker to the jaw. Van Hook failed to
keep his guard up, and every time he
came in the Aggie boxer landed a left
to the jaw. He sent Van Hook to the
floor once. The latter jumped up to
continue the fight, rather dazed. Hagen
landed five or six hard blows to the
face, knocking Van Hook to the floor
again. The bout was stopped at this
point.

in the first tourney.
Cardinal Captain Wins
Vaughn Hosepian, Stanford's wres
tling captain and coach, pinned Harper
on the mat in two minutes. Hosepian
took the offensive at the start in the
fastest match of the evening. He
worked fast, using a great variety of
holds. The fall was secured with a
combination body scissors and half nel-|
son.
Bill Giddings secured a fall over
Siever's downfall. Sterling Giddings
was given the decision over Woodhead
of Stanford in the 158-pound class. The
wrestlers were evenly matched, and
the bout was hard-fought during the
entire nine minutes.
Nickolson Wins Bout
Nickolson of Stanford threw Kress
ler in five minutes and forty seconds. J
Nickolson was easily the best, and
after the start of the match the win- i
ner was never in doubt. In the heavy-1
weight class, Whitney lost to Healey'
of the Aggies. The Davis grappler was
much heavier than the Cardinal man j
and Whitney could do little but try to
keep from benig pinned to the mat. He
put up a good fight, but the superior
weight and strength of the Aggie man
were too much for him, and the fall
was secured in four and a half min
utes.
Inaba won the 115-pound wrestling
bout from Sturm of Stanford, after
he had succeeded in staying on top
the greatest part of the match. Sturm's
only hold seemed to be a lieadlock,
and he could not secure a fall with it.
The 125-pound match went to Urqui
ola of the Aggies. Meyers, the Card
grappler, remained on the defensive
until the last two minutes. Then he se
cured a body scissors and arm hold 1
on Urquiola, and might have thrown
him had the match lasted a minute
longer.
Knockouts Feature Boxing
Mihle of California Aggies put Hard j
out by the knockout route in the mid
die of the second round in the first
boxing match of the evening. Hard,
could not keep his feet, and in the first
canto he was on the floor most of the
time. He took the count of seven once
and again the count of nine before the
round was over. Mihle knew more
about boxnig than did his oppnent,
and Hard could scarcely land a blow.
Armbruster of Stanford sent Miller
to the showers before the first round
was over. Miller started in with all the
confidence in the world, as he had de
feated the California 125-pound boxers
the week before. Armbruster let Miller
drive him against the ropes, and then
the Stanford boxer was back at Miller
like a rock hurled from a sling. He
landed about three good blows and
Miller was tired of boxing for the eve
ning, preferring to sleep on the canvas.
The big upset came in the 135-pound
class. Two years ago Jimmie Ross se
cured a decision from Gerson, and ever
since then the Aggie boxer has been
waiting for a chance to get even. He
had it last night, and followed up his
advantage, with the result that Ross
was easily outpointed. The Stanford
captain, although out of condition, held
Gerson for the first round. The latter
evened things up the second canto,
and then in the final round knocked
Ross all over the ring.
Lane Outpoints Opponent
Johnny Lane outpointed Johnson of
the California Aggies in their three
round fracas. Lane had things all his
own way throughout the bout. He
landed four wallops to every one of
Johnson's in the first round. Johnson
fought into clinches in the next two
rounds, but Lane got in a few lefts
and knocked him to the floor in the
third period.
In the middleweight class, Jake Ir
win gave an excellent exhibition of
boxing, and was given the decision
over Barth. Irwin didn't hurry matters,
but watched his chances and every
time Barth came in, stopped his pro
gress with a well-directed blow. Barth
started his swings miles away, and Ir
win had little difficulty In avoiding
most of them. The Davis boxer took a
lot of punishment in the first two
rounds and was able to give little op
position in the final period. From his
work Friday, Irwin showed himself to
be one of Maloney's best boxers.
In the last bout of the evening Van
Hook started out well, landing the
first few blows. Then Hagen got going
and held the Stanford boxer off during
the rest of the round. In the second
period Van Hook landed two blows to
the head, but Hagen sent him a hay
maker to the jaw. Van Hook failed to
keep his guard up, and every time he
came in the Aggie boxer landed a left
to the jaw. He sent Van Hook to the
floor once. The latter jumped up to
continue the fight, rather dazed. Hagen
landed five or six hard blows to the
face, knocking Van Hook to the floor
again. The bout was stopped at this
point.
Coach Harry Maloney's boxers won
four out of seven bouts, while his I
wrestlers won but two matches in the

son.
Bill Giddings secured a fall over
Siever's downfall. Sterling Giddings
was given the decision over Woodhead
of Stanford in the 158-pound class. The
wrestlers were evenly matched, and
the bout was hard-fought during the
entire nine minutes.
Nickolson Wins Bout
Nickolson of Stanford threw Kress
ler in five minutes and forty seconds. J
Nickolson was easily the best, and
after the start of the match the win- i
ner was never in doubt. In the heavy-1
weight class, Whitney lost to Healey'
of the Aggies. The Davis grappler was
much heavier than the Cardinal man j
and Whitney could do little but try to
keep from benig pinned to the mat. He
put up a good fight, but the superior
weight and strength of the Aggie man
were too much for him, and the fall
was secured in four and a half min
utes.
Inaba won the 115-pound wrestling
bout from Sturm of Stanford, after
he had succeeded in staying on top
the greatest part of the match. Sturm's
only hold seemed to be a lieadlock,
and he could not secure a fall with it.
The 125-pound match went to Urqui
ola of the Aggies. Meyers, the Card
grappler, remained on the defensive
until the last two minutes. Then he se
cured a body scissors and arm hold 1
on Urquiola, and might have thrown
him had the match lasted a minute
longer.
Knockouts Feature Boxing
Mihle of California Aggies put Hard j
out by the knockout route in the mid
die of the second round in the first
boxing match of the evening. Hard,
could not keep his feet, and in the first
canto he was on the floor most of the
time. He took the count of seven once
and again the count of nine before the
round was over. Mihle knew more
about boxnig than did his oppnent,
and Hard could scarcely land a blow.
Armbruster of Stanford sent Miller
to the showers before the first round
was over. Miller started in with all the
confidence in the world, as he had de
feated the California 125-pound boxers
the week before. Armbruster let Miller
drive him against the ropes, and then
the Stanford boxer was back at Miller
like a rock hurled from a sling. He
landed about three good blows and
Miller was tired of boxing for the eve
ning, preferring to sleep on the canvas.
The big upset came in the 135-pound
class. Two years ago Jimmie Ross se
cured a decision from Gerson, and ever
since then the Aggie boxer has been
waiting for a chance to get even. He
had it last night, and followed up his
advantage, with the result that Ross
was easily outpointed. The Stanford
captain, although out of condition, held
Gerson for the first round. The latter
evened things up the second canto,
and then in the final round knocked
Ross all over the ring.
Lane Outpoints Opponent
Johnny Lane outpointed Johnson of
the California Aggies in their three
round fracas. Lane had things all his
own way throughout the bout. He
landed four wallops to every one of
Johnson's in the first round. Johnson
fought into clinches in the next two
rounds, but Lane got in a few lefts
and knocked him to the floor in the
third period.
In the middleweight class, Jake Ir
win gave an excellent exhibition of
boxing, and was given the decision
over Barth. Irwin didn't hurry matters,
but watched his chances and every
time Barth came in, stopped his pro
gress with a well-directed blow. Barth
started his swings miles away, and Ir
win had little difficulty In avoiding
most of them. The Davis boxer took a
lot of punishment in the first two
rounds and was able to give little op
position in the final period. From his
work Friday, Irwin showed himself to
be one of Maloney's best boxers.
In the last bout of the evening Van
Hook started out well, landing the
first few blows. Then Hagen got going
and held the Stanford boxer off during
the rest of the round. In the second
period Van Hook landed two blows to
the head, but Hagen sent him a hay
maker to the jaw. Van Hook failed to
keep his guard up, and every time he
came in the Aggie boxer landed a left
to the jaw. He sent Van Hook to the
floor once. The latter jumped up to
continue the fight, rather dazed. Hagen
landed five or six hard blows to the
face, knocking Van Hook to the floor
again. The bout was stopped at this
point.
Coach Harry Maloney's boxers won
four out of seven bouts, while his I
wrestlers won but two matches in the
return meet with the California Aggies
held last Friday evening in Encina
gymnasium. The tables were complete
ly turned in this meet, as the Aggies j
won the boxing and lost the wrestling
in the first tourney.
Cardinal Captain Wins
Vaughn Hosepian, Stanford's wres
tling captain and coach, pinned Harper
on the mat in two minutes. Hosepian
took the offensive at the start in the
fastest match of the evening. He
worked fast, using a great variety of
holds. The fall was secured with a
combination body scissors and half nel-|
son.
Bill Giddings secured a fall over
Siever's downfall. Sterling Giddings

of Stanford in the 158-pound class. The
