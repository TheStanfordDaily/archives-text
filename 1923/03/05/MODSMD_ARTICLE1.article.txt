### 
Coach Harry Maloney's boxers won

wrestlers won but two matches in the
return meet with the California Aggies

gymnasium. The tables were complete
ly turned in this meet, as the Aggies j

Cardinal Captain Wins
Vaughn Hosepian, Stanford's wres
tling captain and coach, pinned Harper
on the mat in two minutes. Hosepian
took the offensive at the start in the
fastest match of the evening. He
worked fast, using a great variety of
holds. The fall was secured with a
combination body scissors and half nel-|
son.
Bill Giddings secured a fall over
Siever's downfall. Sterling Giddings
was given the decision over Woodhead
of Stanford in the 158-pound class. The
wrestlers were evenly matched, and
the bout was hard-fought during the
entire nine minutes.
Nickolson Wins Bout
Nickolson of Stanford threw Kress
ler in five minutes and forty seconds. J
Nickolson was easily the best, and
after the start of the match the win- i
ner was never in doubt. In the heavy-1
weight class, Whitney lost to Healey'
of the Aggies. The Davis grappler was
much heavier than the Cardinal man j
and Whitney could do little but try to
keep from benig pinned to the mat. He
put up a good fight, but the superior
weight and strength of the Aggie man
were too much for him, and the fall
was secured in four and a half min
utes.
Inaba won the 115-pound wrestling
bout from Sturm of Stanford, after
he had succeeded in staying on top
the greatest part of the match. Sturm's
only hold seemed to be a lieadlock,
and he could not secure a fall with it.
The 125-pound match went to Urqui
ola of the Aggies. Meyers, the Card
grappler, remained on the defensive
until the last two minutes. Then he se
cured a body scissors and arm hold 1
on Urquiola, and might have thrown
him had the match lasted a minute
longer.
