# Flower Committee Duties Will Be Transferred to Juniors Founders' Day
## 
### 
The privilege of placing flowers on the
Stanford mausoleum is to be officially
transferred from the Senior Class to the
Junior Class as part of the Founders'
Day ceremonies this year, according to
the announcement made at the Senior
Class meeting Friday.
In the past, the transference of this
right has always taken place during
Senior Week. This arrangement was
found unsatisfactory, however, because
many juniors were not present, and be
cause so few students were on campus
that the tradition received very little
publicity. It is also thought that the
ceremony of putting flowers on the Stan
ford tomb is one that should be more
closely associated with Founders' Day.
Past senior classes have performed
this duty through the senior flower com
mittee, consisting of two representative
seniors, a man and a woman. Grace
Brown, '23, and William Rlack, '23, who
were recently chosen as the members of
this committee, will give up their places
Friday.
