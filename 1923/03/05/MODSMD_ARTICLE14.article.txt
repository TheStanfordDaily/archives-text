# CARDINAL TRI-STATE DEBATE TEAMS WIN IN BOTH CONTESTS
## Squad Speaking At Eugene Secures Unanimous Decision; Affirmative is Upheld by 2-1 Victory Here 
### 
Stanford won the 1923 tri-state debating championship Friday night by scor
ing a double victory over the Universities of Oregon and Washington—a feat
the Cardinal has been unable to accomplish for a long time.
Stanford's negative team, composed of Claude Minard, '23, and Robert Lewis.
'23, arguing in the Little Theater, succeeded in proving to the judges that the
manufacture and sale of light wines and beer should be legalized in the United
States. They were handed a 2-1 decision over their Washington opponents.
Emmet McCaffery, '24, and Thomas Bailey, '24, overpowered the forensic
speakers of Oregon so completely at Eugene on the same nieht. thai iliev

secured the votes of all three judges.
Sentiment Against Light Liquors
The outcome of the contest shows
that the prohibition issue is still
blurred and one which is just as de
batable as ever. A comparison of the
decisions, however, shows a slight pre
ponderance of sentiment against the
manufacture and sale of even light
liquors.
Minard, in an agressive and well
finished speech, opened Stanford's af
firmative argument on the campus by
contending that bone-dry legislation
was ineffective. He told of the enor
mous amount of liquor being smuggled
into the United States, and said that
it was impossible to prevent such traf
fic because of the long boundaries and
coast lines. "Such legislation cannot, be
enforced because of the lack of sym
pathy with it," Minard asserted. He
advocated a plan which included the
complete abandonment of all saloons.
Claude Woodworth, Washington's
first speaker on the negative, main
tained that there was no distinction
between light wines and hard liquors,
saying that the present prohibition law
would be enforceable in time. 4
Lewis Hammers Prohibitoin
"Prohibition was a wrong step in the
yght direction," Lewis, Stanford's
second speaker, said. "If public senti
ment in all states favored it, there
would be no problem. It is the senti
ment of the people that makes enforce
ment possible, and this is lacking
now." If light wines and beer should
be allowed, the consumption of hard
liquors would be greatly decreased,
Lewis believed.
Wendell Edberg, second speaker for
the northerners, denied that legaliza
tion would reduce hard liquor con
sumption. "There is no reason for
changing the present law, merely be
cause it is being violated," he said.
"Speed laws are violated, yet there i»
no great agitation for change." Edberg
claimed that wines and beer were
harmful because of their effect on
length of life, basing his contention on
Life Insurance statistics and the belief
of physicians. "Beer serves no medici
nal purpose which cannot be met in
other ways," he said.
Minard Answers Arguments
Woodworth, in opening the rebuttal
argument for Washington, declared
| that the desirability of prohibition de
pends on the particular group of public
opinion that favors it. Minard an
swered him by saying, "If prohibition
