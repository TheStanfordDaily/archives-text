# COLORS AND MUSIC GIVE GALA EFFECT TO MILITARY BALL
## 
### James Muir, '25 
Patriotic colors and a snappy ten
piece orchestra carried the Military
Ball "over the top" Friday evening.
Even the roughs were over the top
when it came to looking on from the
balcony. A huge flag and an almost
solid ceiling of red, white, and blue
streamers formed a covering for the
dancers that was not conducive to
good sight-seeing from above.
Crowd About Right Size
About two hundred couples were on
the floor of the pavilion. This crowd
was not so large as to limit dancing to
standing still and plunging from close
formation. However, Manager R. W.
Faville pronounced the dance a nan
cial success. The blue and red colored
lights gave a weird effect, and the
low-hung flag and streamers greatly
increased the acoustics of the buliding.
Something new in the way of dance
entertainment was introduced by the
four little girls from the Granada Thea
tre. After the third dance of the pro
gram, the floor was cleared and the
entertainers put on "The Dance of the
Gypsies." Despite clever costumes and
good rhythm of motion this number
was not as good as the "Dance of the
Wooden Soldiers," which followed the
fourth terpsichorian round. Both got a
good cheer from the audience, how
ever, and a second encore was called (
for each time, but not delivered. Rich
ard Malaby presided at the piano for
these two acts.
The programs were liand-painted.
and not too elaborate. A picture of a
wooden soldier was designed on the
cover, and the interior contained
spaces for twelve dance numbers. Only
ten of these were played, for the first
two were extras, serving as chasers
for the main mixture.
Punch and mint candies were served
as refreshments to give the dancers a
chance to get out from under and see
who was there. This was another inno
vation of the manager which future
Military Ball chairmen will have to
take into consideration.
Grinstead's ten-piece orchestra fur
nished music of a type that is seldom
heard on the campus. The old favorites
were delivered with an element of
newness which gave even the flag a
flutter or two. The only thing wrong
was the way they didn't play, for the
intermissions were dead enough to
warrant the installation of a double
action orchestra as is customary in
some Eastern universities.
Headed by Richard Faville, the com
mittee was made up of Glenn Barnes,
decorations; Sidney Cole, programs,
and Ray Tremaine, music. All other
members of the Military department
helped in the decoration of the pa
vilion.
