# Comptroller Roth Plans Endowment Drive in Reno
## 
### 
i Comptroller Roth is planning a three
day trip to Reno, Neva !a. in the interest
'of the endowment campaign. Ren > was
not canv .ssed during ti:e drive last ycar v
and Roth feels tha* he should be able tc
j secure some money from the Nevada
; metropolis. He will speak before thr
Stanford Alumni Association there, ariÂ«J
will organize a committee to reach the
rest of the people who arc interested n*
Stanford.
On Saturday Roth made two speeches
in Hollister. The occasion there was the
"Older Boys' Conference," which was
conducted by the Y. M. C. A. One of
| the talks, given at noon, was for the hoys
'and delegates from other counties. The
address in the evening was for the dele
gates and men of the town.
Roth is having the young oak trees
which were formerly between the Library
and the Art Gallery, moved to other
parts of the campus. This is being done
because the University is planning on
erecting a building between the Library
and Art Gallery at some future date. If
the trees were allowed to grow they
would become too large to move, and
would have to be destroyed when the
building is finally ready to be erected.
