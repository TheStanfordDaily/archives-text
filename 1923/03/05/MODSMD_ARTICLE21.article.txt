"Poor old 'Dink'," sympathized a lot of the know
ing ones when Glenn Ilartranft and A1 Smith last
quarter left the University and, of course, were lost
to the 1923 track team along with the twenty or
twenty-five points they were morally certain of tak
ing in the Big Meet with California: Templeton had
built up what seemed to be one of the strongost track
and field squads in the United States, only to have
the most powerful members removed just as it was
about to get into stride.
But the youthful coach spent no time crying over
misfortune. He turned his whole attention to the
material on hand, with the result that right now he
has on the oval an outfit materially stronger than
most students believe it to be. Make 110 mistake
about this —barring unreasonable breaks, Stanford
has a chance to come through against the Bears in
the spring meet.
Both California and Stanford this season have un
balanced teams. Coach Christie has unusual strength
in the field, and with the exception of a couple of
two-milers, not so much 011 the track. Templeton's
plight is the exact reverse. The possibility then is
that while California may get most of the points in
jumps and weights, Stanford may do likewise in the
races, with the ultimate result depending again on
the relay. It will not be long before some of the
various "experts" in these parts discover the above
situation for one of the city dailies. It may be pos
sible to gather a total of fifty-five points 011 the
track.
Of course, there can be no Stanford victory with
out unusual "come through" performances on the
part of Cardinal athletes. But Templeton, in the
short period of his coaching career, particularly in
the dual meets, has a startling record of just such
showings on the part of his men. Last spring, in the
writer's opinion, "Dink" outfoxed his older rival at
California in every doubtful point of the Big Meet.
In almost half the events his athletes beat men until
that time recognized as definitely superior.
Templeton's handling and development of the
present track squad will be followed closely by all
students interested in that event we have all heard
about—a serpentine. Captain Falk's men certainly
deserve full student backing from the start. An
even battle after the tremendous setback of the early
season would stamp Templeton as, what we all be
lieve he is, one of the greatest coaches in the game
today; and it would mark the greatest comeback in
Stanford sport history.

ing in the Big Meet with California: Templeton had
built up what seemed to be one of the strongost track
and field squads in the United States, only to have
the most powerful members removed just as it was
about to get into stride.
But the youthful coach spent no time crying over
misfortune. He turned his whole attention to the
material on hand, with the result that right now he
has on the oval an outfit materially stronger than
most students believe it to be. Make 110 mistake
about this —barring unreasonable breaks, Stanford
has a chance to come through against the Bears in
the spring meet.
Both California and Stanford this season have un
balanced teams. Coach Christie has unusual strength
in the field, and with the exception of a couple of
two-milers, not so much 011 the track. Templeton's
plight is the exact reverse. The possibility then is
that while California may get most of the points in
jumps and weights, Stanford may do likewise in the
races, with the ultimate result depending again on
the relay. It will not be long before some of the
various "experts" in these parts discover the above
situation for one of the city dailies. It may be pos
sible to gather a total of fifty-five points 011 the
track.
Of course, there can be no Stanford victory with
out unusual "come through" performances on the
part of Cardinal athletes. But Templeton, in the
short period of his coaching career, particularly in
the dual meets, has a startling record of just such
showings on the part of his men. Last spring, in the
writer's opinion, "Dink" outfoxed his older rival at
California in every doubtful point of the Big Meet.
In almost half the events his athletes beat men until
that time recognized as definitely superior.
Templeton's handling and development of the
present track squad will be followed closely by all
students interested in that event we have all heard
about—a serpentine. Captain Falk's men certainly
deserve full student backing from the start. An
even battle after the tremendous setback of the early
season would stamp Templeton as, what we all be
lieve he is, one of the greatest coaches in the game
today; and it would mark the greatest comeback in
Stanford sport history.
"Poor old 'Dink'," sympathized a lot of the know
ing ones when Glenn Ilartranft and A1 Smith last
quarter left the University and, of course, were lost
to the 1923 track team along with the twenty or
twenty-five points they were morally certain of tak
