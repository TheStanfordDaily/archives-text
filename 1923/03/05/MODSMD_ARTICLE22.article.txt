# CONGRATULATIONS
## 
### 
The entire student body should approve of the
broad and sensible basis on which Quadrangle Club
selected its last announced set of new members. This
organization now is made up in quite proper fashion
of men from athletic and non-athletic fields, with
members quite representative of the student body in
personality, activity, and living group affiliation.
Students are willing to accq)t the leadership of
an organization which is truly representative, and
which is sane and intelligent. In the writer's opin
ion, there has been no society with this standard at
Stanford during his sojourn here. Quadrangle Club
is progressing in the right direction, and it is now
practically what its founders hoped it would be, a
real cross-section of all student activity, including
principal leaders.
Students will always listen readily to what a club
of this sort has to say.
