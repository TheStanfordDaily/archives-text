He: Why don't you love me? Just because I go to
Stanford and you to California. . . .
She: Don't! (Shudders slightly.) The S. P. is going
to raise the fare again, I hear.
He: Yes, it's not fair to raise the fare, for I can't go
see my lady fair so often.
Sings:
It isn't fair, to raise the fare,
'Cause over there, in Berkeley fair,
Now this I swear, my laidy fair,
Can't wonder where, I am, so there!
She: Yes, Horace, I think it's wrong, too.
He: Think? Why, girls can't think. Especially co-eds.
Chorus: (Echo effect, off stake) No, girl's can't think.
Especially co-eds!
She: I think you're horrid. So there!
Sings:
You men are awful brutes,
Yes, really, you're galoots.
You think the women love you,
When they marry you, you do.
He: .Sings:
But if you do not love us, why marry us at all?
I wouldn't, if I didn't love, nay, marry not at all!
She:
But if you hate to work as much as me.
You'd marry any minute, same as me.
He: Well, that's that. My voice is getting kinda
tired. I'm glad that the song writer didn't put any
more songs in this act. Oh, by the way, will you marry
me?
She: Yes.
He: All right. Then we won't have Act Two after
all. Manager pull the curtain,

She: Don't! (Shudders slightly.) The S. P. is going
to raise the fare again, I hear.
He: Yes, it's not fair to raise the fare, for I can't go
see my lady fair so often.
Sings:
It isn't fair, to raise the fare,
'Cause over there, in Berkeley fair,
Now this I swear, my laidy fair,
Can't wonder where, I am, so there!
She: Yes, Horace, I think it's wrong, too.
He: Think? Why, girls can't think. Especially co-eds.
Chorus: (Echo effect, off stake) No, girl's can't think.
Especially co-eds!
She: I think you're horrid. So there!
Sings:
You men are awful brutes,
Yes, really, you're galoots.
You think the women love you,
When they marry you, you do.
He: .Sings:
But if you do not love us, why marry us at all?
I wouldn't, if I didn't love, nay, marry not at all!
She:
But if you hate to work as much as me.
You'd marry any minute, same as me.
He: Well, that's that. My voice is getting kinda
tired. I'm glad that the song writer didn't put any
more songs in this act. Oh, by the way, will you marry
me?
She: Yes.
He: All right. Then we won't have Act Two after
all. Manager pull the curtain,
CURTAIN FALLS.
