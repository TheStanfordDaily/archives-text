# A 						CHAMPION!

What a blank world this is. Dear me, dear me. I
weep, blankly with the face of a saint, with the face of
an idiot, and the world favors me with a polite stare,
blanker than the fact of the saint, or the idiot. With a
dear friend of mine, who objects to the presence of
revellers at unseemly hours, I cry, "This must cease!"
I am led to this explositon of verbose rhetoric simply
because some people will not read this paper. I warn
them: their time is at hand. In the near future let them
be prepared to find themselves confronted by an
agonized simpleton who will frantically wave printer's
ink in their faces. That will be me. And although I am
timid enough (even my enemies will testify to this) I
can cause quite a sensation when prodded (my friends
know this).
Of the dignity of the editor-in-chief I say nothing; of
the serenity of the feature editor 1 say nothing; of the
depth of the managing editor I make no mention. I
likewise omit my wounded vanity (let no one think this
small) as being distinctly out of place. I appeal merely
to the financial sense of the subscribers (tell them what
I say). If they will not read, let them not take the
paper. We (see how I intrude myself) will take our
brains hence. As a wholly dis-interested party, I stand
ready to defend everything in this paper from anybody.
I say this because those whose business it is to do
nothing but defend it have to be tactful.
To finish up the business, and to paraphrase a remark
Junius made of the gentlemanly Duke of Grafton, " 'Tis
not so much they never peruse our pages from design,
as that they never do so by accident."
