# HOLDOVER TRAVESTY BY SOPHOMORES IS ENORMOUS SUCCESS
## 
### Hal Rorke, '24 
In three years there has been no bet- |
; ter Holdover Show than the travesty
presented by eight sophomores before the
! Irish Marathon spectators last Saturday
afternoon.
The artistic few who delicately revolt
at anything as coarse as the guffawing of
■a*crowd of roughs at caustic ridicule,
11 admonish to admire the vigorous thor
oughness and the demolishing enthusiasm
of the lampooning. Which ever of the
holdovers wrote the skit, he went the
whole hog and bolted the sausage as
| well.
With no astonishingly adroit sledging
of the satiric bludgeon, the playwright
| knocked the University's policy of "Kul
tur über Alles—particularly athletics 1"
j into tiny fragments and then threw the
I dust to "Die Luft der Frehiet Weht."
After the manner of popular cartoonists,
the author represented me University as
a ship, the guiding of which was in the
! hands of Captain Committeeman C. B.
| Witless, who hired the crew, and Ship's
Doctor O. L. Hellyet, whose office it was
indicated, consisted of supplying data for
disqualifying the best sailors.

After rejecting athletes, shipping book
worms and warning the men of might
j already aboard that scholastic laggards
had the deep-six in store for them, the
captain sets sail. He tries to avoid Ath
letic Island. Just before he is forced to
land there the captain throws the athletic
part of the crew overboard, drown,
however, for U. S. C. takes the swimmer
in after publicly refusing him entrance.
The field events in the subsequent meet
ion Athletic Island are unfortunately won
by Stanford's rivals, but the meet is
finally tied when the Cardinal student
i spurts out before all the field in a super
human effort after an examination book.
The cast made a great deal of fun out
of the whole thing, and as a result got
by in excellent shape. Saving only the !
Ship's Doctor, the whole cast will prob
ably be able to continue enjoying further
j burlesques. As for the Ship's Doctor—j
he is quite as good an actor as the stu
j dent body boasts. His performance was
j so good, in fact, that he will probably
. have to spend all of his ingenuity in the
future in contriving not to meet the
: gentleman lie mimiced, for even such a
person has some human characteristics.

With no astonishingly adroit sledging
of the satiric bludgeon, the playwright

j into tiny fragments and then threw the

After the manner of popular cartoonists,
the author represented me University as
a ship, the guiding of which was in the
! hands of Captain Committeeman C. B.
| Witless, who hired the crew, and Ship's
Doctor O. L. Hellyet, whose office it was
indicated, consisted of supplying data for
disqualifying the best sailors.

After rejecting athletes, shipping book
worms and warning the men of might
j already aboard that scholastic laggards
had the deep-six in store for them, the
captain sets sail. He tries to avoid Ath
letic Island. Just before he is forced to
land there the captain throws the athletic
part of the crew overboard, drown,
however, for U. S. C. takes the swimmer
in after publicly refusing him entrance.
The field events in the subsequent meet
ion Athletic Island are unfortunately won
by Stanford's rivals, but the meet is
finally tied when the Cardinal student
i spurts out before all the field in a super
human effort after an examination book.
The cast made a great deal of fun out
of the whole thing, and as a result got
by in excellent shape. Saving only the !
Ship's Doctor, the whole cast will prob
ably be able to continue enjoying further
j burlesques. As for the Ship's Doctor—j
he is quite as good an actor as the stu
j dent body boasts. His performance was
j so good, in fact, that he will probably
. have to spend all of his ingenuity in the
future in contriving not to meet the
: gentleman lie mimiced, for even such a
person has some human characteristics.
In three years there has been no bet- |
; ter Holdover Show than the travesty
presented by eight sophomores before the
! Irish Marathon spectators last Saturday
afternoon.
The artistic few who delicately revolt
at anything as coarse as the guffawing of
■a*crowd of roughs at caustic ridicule,
11 admonish to admire the vigorous thor
oughness and the demolishing enthusiasm
of the lampooning. Which ever of the
holdovers wrote the skit, he went the
whole hog and bolted the sausage as
| well.
