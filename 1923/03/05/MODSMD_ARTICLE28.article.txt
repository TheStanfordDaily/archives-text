# OFF DAY FOR BABE NINE LETS OAKLAND TECH WIN BY 8-7
## 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Oakland Technical High School 1
trounced the babes last Saturday by the j
close scorc of 8-7, and it's hard to say;
whether it was because Oakland was so j
good or the freshmen were so rotten. I
The intramural champions would look|
like the New York Giants when up ;
against the kind of baseball the kid
Cards smeared out, and Coach "Husky"
Hunt is wondering where his charges
learned all their dirty work.
It may seem unfair to criticize a team ;
harshly for losing a game by a one
fun margin, but the near approach to
victory does not mean that victory was j
deserved. The 1926 defense was so weak
that Oakland earned only four tallies,
the others coming as free-will offerings.
On the other hand, the offense was so
immaterial that four out of the seven
Stanford scores were sent over the plate
largely by the efforts of the visiting
team.
The yearlings put on a very fair ex
hibition of Japanese juggling. They
trea'ted the ball as if it were an influenza
germ. They made eight errors of com
mission and a good many more of omis
sion. They have played three games this i
week, and it may be that they are a trifle !
tired out.
Nevers fanned an even dozen, issued ,
ten hits, walked two and hit two. A
home run beyond a fielder who was play
ing out of position and two doubles in
succession aided the Oaklanders con- â€¢
siderably, especially as Green's three-ply j
wallop was the only extrabase act the
babes were able to put on.
One run in the second and two in the |

third gave the babes a lead which they
held until the fourth, when Oakland got
, two hits which coincided with a Stan-
I ford riot of errors for three tallies. One !
| had been scored in the preceding frame.
1 hree markers in the sixth and one in
I the seventh put the Tech men out in
1 front by 8-3, but the first-year team had
i enough come-back tQ stay out of the (
, run-away class. A walk, an error, a
| single and a triple were good for three
1 runs in the seventh epoch, and three hits
pushed over a solitary score in the
jeighth.
Lovelace, the first m,Mi up in the final
inning, was safe on an error and it
looked encouraging for a moment.
Green sent a screaming drive down to
short which looked like a sure-enough
hit, but Murray gathered it in on the
fly and doubled Lovelace off second.
Draper then whiffed for the fifth time,
and the game was over.
