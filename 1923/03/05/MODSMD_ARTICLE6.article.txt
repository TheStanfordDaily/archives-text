# VARSITY NINE IS BEATEN BY SAINT MARY'S TEAM, 10-1
## 
### 
Eleven base hits and ten runs are i
usually enough to win any ball game, j
They were plenty to give the St.
Mary's nine a victory over the Stan- j
ford vaisity Saturday, for Lindblom
held the Cards to five scattered hits |
and a single tally.
Both Pitchers Ineffective
Teague, who started on the mound I
for Stanford, was wild and ineffective, j
and Clark, who took over the burden !
in the eighth, was little better. Five j
errors in the infield didn't help much.:
Teague allowed seven hits, walked six
men, and hit one, for a total of six I
runs in the first seven innings. Clark 1
walked two, and allowed four hits and !
as many runs in the last two frames.
Two walks, a hit batsman, and a
pair of singles gave the Phoenix men j
a four-run start in the opening canto.!
The Cards also looked dangerous in
the first. The first two men got passes
and Mulchay singled, filling the bases,
but Carver popped to the first base
man. Deffebach brought in the only
run of the game for Wolter's team
when his long fly to right let Roberts
scamper across the plate. Woodward
was caught at third, and not another j
red shirt got past second base in the !
next eight frames.
Fast Fielding Checks Saints
Fast work in the field prevented the
Saints from scoring again until the
fifth, when a walk and two doubles ac
counted for anotlier tally. A single, a j
triple, and an error by Woodward gave :
Madigan's team another in the sev- 1
enth.
The St. Mary's stickers took a liking
to Clark's delivery as soon as he went
in. He walked the first man in the
eighth. A double by Gardiner advanced
the runner to third, and he scored a
moment later on a sacrifice fly to cen
ter.
Three More in Ninth
The Saints were hard to satisfy, and
they piled on three more tallies in the
first of the ninth. Kardoza got life
when Roberts muffed his grounder.
Grant doubled and Kardoza went to
third. Meuter singled, scoring Kardoza
and Grant, but was out trying to
stretch his hit to a double. Lindblom
singled, going to second on Roberts'
second boot of the inning. Rooney was
safe on a fielder's choice and.Paynter
walked, loading the sacks. Lindblom
scored the last run of the game on
White's fly to right.
Harrington, Grant, and Meuter were |
the heavy hitters. Harrington got two !
singles and a double out of five trips j
to the plate, and scored three runs.
Grant garnered two doubles and a !
single out of five, scoring one run,!
while Meuter got a single, a triple, and !
a walk in five attempts.
The Phoenix team played airtight
ball in the field, only one error being i
chalked up against them. This was on
a bad throw to first by Lindblom in the
opening frame.
Deffebach Does Flashy Fielding
Deffebach did some flashy fielding
in left, but couldn't seem to find Lind
i blom's hooks. "Lefty" Heckendorf is
just recovering from an attack of in
fluenza and Mulehay took his place at
; the difficult corner. Mulcliay is not at
J home at third, as he is naturally a
shortstop, but he played good ball in
the field and got one of the Cards' five
hits. H-e made but one boble which
| came in the secohd when he juggled
Meuter's hot grounder.

and Mulchay singled, filling the bases,
but Carver popped to the first base
man. Deffebach brought in the only
run of the game for Wolter's team
when his long fly to right let Roberts
scamper across the plate. Woodward
was caught at third, and not another j
red shirt got past second base in the !
next eight frames.
Fast Fielding Checks Saints
Fast work in the field prevented the
Saints from scoring again until the
fifth, when a walk and two doubles ac
counted for anotlier tally. A single, a j
triple, and an error by Woodward gave :
Madigan's team another in the sev- 1
enth.
The St. Mary's stickers took a liking
to Clark's delivery as soon as he went
in. He walked the first man in the
eighth. A double by Gardiner advanced
the runner to third, and he scored a
moment later on a sacrifice fly to cen
ter.
Three More in Ninth
The Saints were hard to satisfy, and
they piled on three more tallies in the
first of the ninth. Kardoza got life
when Roberts muffed his grounder.
Grant doubled and Kardoza went to
third. Meuter singled, scoring Kardoza
and Grant, but was out trying to
stretch his hit to a double. Lindblom
singled, going to second on Roberts'
second boot of the inning. Rooney was
safe on a fielder's choice and.Paynter
walked, loading the sacks. Lindblom
scored the last run of the game on
White's fly to right.
Harrington, Grant, and Meuter were |
the heavy hitters. Harrington got two !
singles and a double out of five trips j
to the plate, and scored three runs.
Grant garnered two doubles and a !
single out of five, scoring one run,!
while Meuter got a single, a triple, and !
a walk in five attempts.
The Phoenix team played airtight
ball in the field, only one error being i
chalked up against them. This was on
a bad throw to first by Lindblom in the
opening frame.
Deffebach Does Flashy Fielding
Deffebach did some flashy fielding
in left, but couldn't seem to find Lind
i blom's hooks. "Lefty" Heckendorf is
just recovering from an attack of in
fluenza and Mulehay took his place at
; the difficult corner. Mulcliay is not at
J home at third, as he is naturally a
shortstop, but he played good ball in
the field and got one of the Cards' five
hits. H-e made but one boble which
| came in the secohd when he juggled
Meuter's hot grounder.

Both Pitchers Ineffective
Teague, who started on the mound I
for Stanford, was wild and ineffective, j
and Clark, who took over the burden !
in the eighth, was little better. Five j
errors in the infield didn't help much.:
Teague allowed seven hits, walked six
men, and hit one, for a total of six I
runs in the first seven innings. Clark 1
walked two, and allowed four hits and !
as many runs in the last two frames.
Two walks, a hit batsman, and a
