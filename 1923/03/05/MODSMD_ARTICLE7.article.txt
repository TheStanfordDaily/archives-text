# WALNUT TREE CAUSES HAY FEVER IN SPRING
## 
### 
That walnut pollen is a cause of hay
fever has been discovered by Professor
Harvey of the Department of Botany in
the University of California,
The spring type of the disease is very
troublesome in the Sacramento valley,
where it was noted that the native Cali
fornia black walnut was much used as
a street tree, and that the disease dis
appeared soon after the closc of the
flowering period.
Since this evidence pointed to the wal
nut tree as probably the chief offender,
samples of the pollen were gathered and
biological tests were made. In each case
the results were positive.
The* treatment of numerous hay-fever
is now under way and the
serums prepared from the black walnut
are most used.
