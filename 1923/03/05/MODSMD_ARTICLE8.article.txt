In the above order the four class
I teams finished the annual Irish Mara
j thon last Saturday afternoon on the
varsity track field.
Van Judah, who turned in. the best
varsity and senior time of 51 fiat, gave
| the senior team a lead in the second
j lap which was never headed. He pass
j ed the junior runner on the 220-yard
I curve. •
Richardson Wins Non-Varsity Prize
Bill Richardson, freshman marathon
I captain, tied with Charley Daley and
Roy Williamson with a time of 51 3-5,
■ but as both Daly and Williamson are
varsity runners, Richardson is conced
ed holder of the best non-varsity and
freshman time for the meet.
The freshmen pulled the surprise of
the afternoon when they ran a con
sistent second to the senior team
throughout the twenty-four laps.
Ralph Shermund made the fastest
sophomore time, running his lap in 52
flat.
Few Changes in Order of Classes
The juniors took the lead at the
start of the race with the freshmen
and seniors close behind. After Van
i Judah had passed the second junior
j runner, the order remained the same
i to the end of the race, freshmen sec-
I ond, sophomores third, and juniors
| fourth.
In the twenty-third round the sen
j iors lapped the juniors. This, however,
did not prevent Harvey Coverley from
I running his lap in 52 flat or slow
Charley Daley below 51 3-5 in the
twenty-fourth lap. The other teams had
practically finished when Daly's turn
came in the final heat.
Snedden Gets Greased Pig
"Don" Snedden, '23, who has a repu
tation as a diver on the varsity swim
ming team, got away on a perfect
start in the greased pig chase. With a
flying tackle which was a close re
semblance to a "jack-nife," he was
able to down the vaselined pork under
an avalanche of opposing class con-
testants before the squealer was aware
that recess had begun.
Lane Falk, '23, and "Al" Forster, '23,
galloped the three-legged race in 15
seconds flat, leaving the other runners
behind in a scurry for the two-dollar
prize. This is the second year that Falk
has been a member of the winning
combination.
"Dick" Macintosh, '24, reaped first
honors in the 100 dash backwards in
the fast time of 15 3-5.
Berry Proves Fast Walker
Lowell Berry, '24, crossed the tape
: ahead of his competitors in the 440-
yard walk after an eager aspirant had
been disqualified for his attempt to
make a dash of the event.
The chicken chase furnished thrills
for rooster and competitors alike. One
rooster was bent on giving the after
noon's stunts a good send-off by lead
ing the hen snatchers in a race about
the bleachers. "Al" Forster used foot
ball tactics on a young fryer, and
caught it on a forward pass, thereby
figuring twice in the honors of the day.
