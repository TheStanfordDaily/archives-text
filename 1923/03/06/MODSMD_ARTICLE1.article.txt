# CARD VARSITY TO MEET SANTA CLARA NINE TOMORROW
## Coach Wolter's Team Ready For Second College Game; Missionites Are Erratic 
### 
Stanford and Santa Clara varsity
nines tangle tomorrow afternoon in
the second intercollegiate game of the
season on the local field.
The Red and White team has not
had a very successful season, having
played erratic ball in almost every
game. In their last three games, the
Saints have been guilty of a total of
twenty-three errors. They lost to a
team of recruits from the Seattle Coast j
League Club by a score of 11-1. j,
Cardinals Guilty of Errors
The Cardinals have not been doing
much better. They seem to be an in
and-out aggregation, playing good base
ball in one game and falling down mis
erably in the next. They lost their
first college game of the year to St.
Mary's last Saturday by a 10-1 score.!
Erratic fielding and inability to hit
Lindblom, Phoenix pitcher, kept Wol-!
ter's team behind all the way.
Pitchers Need Experience
The Card pitchers have not steadied I
down yet and their inexperience has |
been the cause of much of the trouble.
Teague had an off day against Madi
gan's team, as did Clark. These two
men are the most reliable on the pitch
nig staff and should give good accounts
of themselves later in the season.
There is no reason for erratic play- i
ing in the infield. Woodward, Peavy,
Heckendorf, and Roberts are experi
enced players and will probably work
together better as the season advances, j
Woodward has not been playing as
good ball in the field as he did last !
year, and Roberts still has a tendency
to muff grounders occasionally. Peavy i
and Heckendorf have not been guilty
of so many errors.
Deffebach, Carver, and McCandless
have been playing consistently in the
outer gardens and have been hitting
the ball at a good clip.
Solomon Favored for Mound
The choice of a pitcher for tomor
row's game seems to lie between Solo
mon, Lowenstein, and Clark, with the
odds in favor of "Soly" if he has re
covered sufficiently from an attack of 1
influenza which has kept him out of a
suit for nearly a week.
The game is slated to begin at 3
o'clock.

Pitchers Need Experience
The Card pitchers have not steadied I
down yet and their inexperience has |
been the cause of much of the trouble.
Teague had an off day against Madi
gan's team, as did Clark. These two
men are the most reliable on the pitch
nig staff and should give good accounts
of themselves later in the season.
There is no reason for erratic play- i
ing in the infield. Woodward, Peavy,
Heckendorf, and Roberts are experi
enced players and will probably work
together better as the season advances, j
Woodward has not been playing as
good ball in the field as he did last !
year, and Roberts still has a tendency
to muff grounders occasionally. Peavy i
and Heckendorf have not been guilty
of so many errors.
Deffebach, Carver, and McCandless
have been playing consistently in the
outer gardens and have been hitting
the ball at a good clip.
Solomon Favored for Mound
The choice of a pitcher for tomor
row's game seems to lie between Solo
mon, Lowenstein, and Clark, with the
odds in favor of "Soly" if he has re
covered sufficiently from an attack of 1
influenza which has kept him out of a
suit for nearly a week.
The game is slated to begin at 3
o'clock.
