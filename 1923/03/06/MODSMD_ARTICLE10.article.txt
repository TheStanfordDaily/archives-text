quarter. His class will meet on Tues
day and Thursday at 11 o'clock and
will receive 1 unit of credit. It will be
open to those who pass the fall quar
ter or who have a knowledge
of elementary physiology.
Stanford this quarter discontinued
the custom of offering credit towards
a degree for any of the work in physi
cal education.
These new courses which will be of
fered will be of a character which will
count towards a degree.
"While it has been deemed best to
discontinue giving University credit
towards graduation for physical exer
cise and participation in games," said
Dr. Barrow in making the announce
ment of the new courses, "it has been
felt for some time that the department
of physical education should offer some
, courses of a serious enough nature and
requiring enough work of academic
caliber to warrant academic credit."
It is the intention of the Depart
ment of Physical Education to add to
: this program as opportunity offers in
the future. It is hoped to add a class
in soccer next fall and in other sports
and games whenever possible.
