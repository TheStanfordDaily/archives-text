# FRESHMEN DEFEATED BY JUNIOR NINE IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
The freshmen found themselves on
the short end of a tally again in the
second game of the interclass baseball
season yesterday afternoon, when they
were vanquished by the juniors by an
8-3 score. The first year men's defeat
was due to wild pitches and errors at
unfortunate times. Both juniors and
freshmen made five errors, while the
freshmen made five hits to hte juniors'
tour.
The 1926 men drew first blood.
Dickey, second man at bat, got a walk,
stole second, was advanced to third
on Meiklejohn's single, and came home
when Green got to the first sack on an
error.
It took 1924 until the end of the
second to get started. Huneke got to
second on an error. Hawkins got to
first on an error, advancing Huneke to
third, and later stole second. Collins
got to first on a third error, and
Huneke and Hawkins crossed the
plate. Here the freshmen tightened up,
and the next three men were put out
safely, Collins scoring in the mean
time.
The juniors made three runs in the
third. May reached first on a sacrifice
