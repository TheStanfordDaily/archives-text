# BYRON COMINGS LECTURES ON OLD TOLTEC TEMPLES
## Professor of Archaeology Describes Civilization Older Than Tutankhamen 
### 
Professor Byron Cummings of the
American Archaeology Institute in his
lecture delivered in the Little Theater
last night described the structures of the
ancient Toltec civilization of Mexico
and showed stcreopticon views of the
temple of Cuicuilco, uncovered recently
near Mexico City.
"The civilization represented by the
ruins of the ancient temple has been es
timated as existent from 2,000 to 7,000
years ago." said Professor Cummings.
"It has arisen, developed, decayed and
fallen amidst the ashes of volcanic ac
tion before the breath of life animated
the Pharaohs of Egypt.
"Americans, as well as others, have
sought subjects for archaeologic study
and observation in Egypt and ancient
Greece and have left the magnificent re
mains in the Mexican valley untouched
until recently," Professor Cummings
continued.
"We know that there have been three
distinct periods of advance in civiliza
tion in America. The Aztec era was the
latest. The Toltec was the first, and has
been buried underneath a depth of lava
from near-by volcanic mountains.
"Cuicuilco was a large temple used as
a place of worship for the natives who
danced in various manners on the dif
ferent terraces of the structure. The
name is of Indian root and means a place
fcr dancing and singing. The temple is
cone shaped and is constructed similar to
all of the early structures of advancing
civilizations.
"We have something in America as
great as that of the Nile and yet we
have neglected it for the discoveries in
Egypt. It is up to us to see that our
own inheritance is not lost or forgotten,"
Professor Cummings concluded.
Besides the views of Cuicuilco, Pro
fessor Cummings showed pictures of
other relics of Mexico unearthed by re
search workers. Some of the mounds
have turned out to be such temples as
the Temple of the Sun, Temple of the
Moon, and Pyramid dedicated to the
God of Air.
Professor Cummings was formerly a
professor of Latin at the University of
Arizona, but recently changed to the De
partment of Archaeology. He has be
come one of the leading figures in
archaeological study as the result of re
search work in Arizona and Utah, and
has also done valuable work by his ex
cavations of the Cuicuilco temple near
Mexico City.

"The civilization represented by the
ruins of the ancient temple has been es
timated as existent from 2,000 to 7,000
years ago." said Professor Cummings.
"It has arisen, developed, decayed and
fallen amidst the ashes of volcanic ac
tion before the breath of life animated
the Pharaohs of Egypt.
"Americans, as well as others, have
sought subjects for archaeologic study
and observation in Egypt and ancient
Greece and have left the magnificent re
mains in the Mexican valley untouched
until recently," Professor Cummings
continued.
"We know that there have been three
distinct periods of advance in civiliza
tion in America. The Aztec era was the
latest. The Toltec was the first, and has
been buried underneath a depth of lava
from near-by volcanic mountains.
"Cuicuilco was a large temple used as
a place of worship for the natives who
danced in various manners on the dif
ferent terraces of the structure. The
name is of Indian root and means a place
fcr dancing and singing. The temple is
cone shaped and is constructed similar to
all of the early structures of advancing
civilizations.
"We have something in America as
great as that of the Nile and yet we
have neglected it for the discoveries in
Egypt. It is up to us to see that our
own inheritance is not lost or forgotten,"
Professor Cummings concluded.
Besides the views of Cuicuilco, Pro
fessor Cummings showed pictures of
other relics of Mexico unearthed by re
search workers. Some of the mounds
have turned out to be such temples as
the Temple of the Sun, Temple of the
Moon, and Pyramid dedicated to the
God of Air.
Professor Cummings was formerly a
professor of Latin at the University of
Arizona, but recently changed to the De
partment of Archaeology. He has be
come one of the leading figures in
archaeological study as the result of re
search work in Arizona and Utah, and
has also done valuable work by his ex
cavations of the Cuicuilco temple near
Mexico City.
