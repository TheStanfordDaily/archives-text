# JUNIOR WOMEN WIN CHAMPIONSHIP OF BASKETBALL SERIES
## 
### 
By defeating the senior basketball j
team, 23-10, yesterday afternoon, the
junior women won the 1923 interclass |
basketball championship.
Josephine and Gcraldine Franklin,
junior guards, played a type of defensive
gatnc that held the senior forwards to
only five field goals.
The junior centers, Grace Strobel, Eu
nice Diddle, and Violet Knowles, were
faster than their opponents and they kept
the ball at their end of the court most
of the time.
Alice Roth, playing forward for the
1924 sextet, caged twenty of the juniors'
twenty-three points. The forwards ex
celled the guards in speed and team
work.
At half-time the score had reached
13-6 in favor of the junior team. After
the intermission the senior centers, Mar
jorie McDonald, Virginia Burks, and
Joyce Robson, played a faster game and
kept the ball near the senior goal. But
the junior guards succeeded in blocking
their rivals' efforts to score. The senior
forwards managed to make only two
baskets in the last half.
In their first contest of the basketball
season, the junior women tied the score
with the sophomores, 15-15. The out
come of the junior-freshman tilt was a
44-4 score.
Although the sophomore-freshman
game that was to be played today is the
last contest on the basketball program,
both of the teams have been disquali
fied for the interclass championship. The
.1926 sextet lost to the junior and senior
squads, and the sophomore women tied
the score with the juniors and were de
feated by the senior sextet.
The last basketball games of the year
will be played on Saturday, March 10,
when the four class teams from Mills
meet their corresponding Stanford op
ponents on the Roble turf.
