Seniors Have Edge
Last year the class of 1924 won by
dint of the performance of Hartranft
and Sudden who garnered approxi
mately twenty points between them

the accumulation of a number of sec
ond and third places by some other
class.
Sprints Will Be Close
In the sprints Haie is probably out
of the running because of a pulled
muscle. Gaspar, '26, and Clark, '23,
