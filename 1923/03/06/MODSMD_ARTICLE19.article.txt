# HAYDN'S "CREATION," ORATORIO, WILL BE PRESENTED FRIDAY
## 
### 
Haydn's famous oratorio, "Creation,"
will be presented under the direction of
Warren D. Allen by the University choir,
assisted by the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra and soloists, next Fri
day evening in the Memorial Church,
at 7:45.
Assisting soloists arc Mrs. Lorna
Lachmund, soprano, who will sing the
part of Gabriel and Eve; Hugh J. Wil
liams, tenor, as Uriel; and George H.
Madison, basso, who will represent
Raphael and Adam.
Members of Alfred Hertz's symphony
orchestra have been securcd for the per
formance, which has been produced at
Stanford but once before, in 1919.
"Creation," which is proclaimed, with
"The Seasons," as Haydn's greatest
music, was first produced at Vienna in
1798, where it was a tremendous success.
Since that time it has ranked with Han
del's "Messiah" as the finest of oratorios.
In the first two parts of the oratorio,
the angels Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel
narrate the incidents of creation; and
the third part pictures the felicity of
Adam and Eve in Paradise.
The orchestral descriptions of chaos —
the asvfulness of that time when "the
earth was without form and vo : d and
darkness was over the face of the deep"
—is vividly pictured, as is the musical
interpretation of the making of the
firmament.
Curios interludes representing move
ments of various creatures were criti
cized vigorously when the work first ap
peared by a few men who objected to
the "realistic" orchestral imitation of
animals.
One of the gems of the oratorio, ac
cording to musical authorities is "In
Native Worth." a concluding number,
which portrays the creation of Adam
and Eve.
