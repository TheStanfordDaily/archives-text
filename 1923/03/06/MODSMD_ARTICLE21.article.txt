"For beauty I am not a star.
There are others more handsome by far;
But my face, I don't mind it,
I ' #
For I am behind it.
' It's the folks out in front that 1 jar."
The above lines are by Woodrow Wilson, ap
parently without excuse.
A. Bonar Law, Premier of England,, holds the
distinction of being- the ugliest man in Parlia
ment, and is proud of it. In the popular elements
of personality (the "power that compels," etc.),
lie must be wholly lacking, for people, even mem
bers of Parliament, will not listen to his speeches.
Still they are said to read them always for the
meat they contain.
The good fellowship elements of personality are
too often the sole basis of college men's judgment
of one another. Honor societies often pick too
many men on this basis, with the result that in
really important enterprises they sometimes lack
the power to put over a real worth while project,
as past methods have shown. Good fellows in
stead of good executives are often put in office.
A "rough," "gawky," "goofy," "stubborn," or
otherwise wrong freshman may be ignored by
group after group until some intelligent senior
puts him on the right track, after which he often
puts earlier critics to shame. Fortunately this last
possibility is less in evidence here than at many
universities, because of the broad organization of
Stanford living groups.
Students with ideas, strength, willingness, and
interest, are needed in activity. Many of us will
do well to judge people more on power to accom
plish something. Men with this quality in the
long run usually do not prove such bad fellows.
Good fellowship, as such, is over emphasized in
college.
