A well meaning soul once asked a centiped how
it managed to keep step with itself. "Why, I have
never thought anything about it," the centiped an
swered. But immediately thereafter the insect did
begin to think alxmt it—and became so perplexed
that it was unable to walk at all!
According to certain critics, the student body is in
an analogous position in regard to the number of
undergraduate organizations. The official director
lists fifty-fonr clubs and societies; more than a score
additional groups *xist unofficially. "Over-organi
zation" is the diagnosis of the critics who express
grave concern over the approaching disintegration
of the student body, due to the presence of these
numerous small groups.
As a matter of fact, these clubs and societies are
unifying forces. The same names are found in the
membership of several different organizations. This
duplication of membership not only prevents the
drawing of sharp lines of distinction between the per
sonnel of groups, but it has a broadening influence
on the individual student. In an undergraduate body
as large as Stanford's unless there is some counter
acting force there are likely to arise small cliques
based on unsocial ideas. The free exercise of the
"joiner" impulse in the organization of recognized
clubs and societies forestalls these objectionable
cliques.
Then, too, where there are so many undergradu
ate organizations no one of them is apt to claim the
undivided attention of its members. The loyalty of
the student to the University is in this way unen
dangered. After all, it is not the number, but the
aims of the organizations that is the important con
sideration.
