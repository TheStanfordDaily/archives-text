A CO-ED'S DIARY
(Editor's Note: Many diaries have been published,
most of them purporting to be the revelations of the
inner soul of the writer, usually a woman. In a great
many cases these have been found to be written for
publication. It has always been the aim of the editors
of this department to place before their readers the real
thing, and at last a great human document has been
secured. The writer is a rather prominent member of
the freshman class, and her opinions of campus life as
seen from the inside should be a series of startling
revelations. She does not write her diary for publica
tion, but in the interests of our readers we have secured
the cooperatioh of a friend of hers, who will supply a
copy of the diary entries each day. Tliu3 for the first
time a sincere account of life as it is lived by a freshman
girl will be made public. The only catch in the matter is
that she may read this column and recognize her own
work. If so, heaven help us all. However, it is said that
freshman women do not read the Daily, so we will pro
ceed.) :

Oh, diary! I have just been looking back over the
happenings of last fall, and this quarter has been far
more interesting than last, even if a lot of the nice boys
did flunk out. I am just beginning to realize what a
little goose of a freshman I was when I came here, but
if I do say it myself, I have improved a lot. I guess
Ed thinks ho, too —he has asked me to go to the Military
Ball. I guess I will go. I ought to refuse him for asking
me only a week ahead, but I know Rosalie is dying to
go with him, so I will show her that even if she has
done pretty well for two years here, a freshman can
beat her at her own game. I hear that she only gets by
now because she lets some of the men pet her some
times.

Another rushing dinner at the Phi Rho house last
night. They are really awfully nice girls, but one can
see that they make such an effort out of their rushing—
as if they could buy girls like me with a good line and
some nice parties.
Janet told me that some of the houses had dinner at
five o'clock during basketball season on the nights of
games so they could get to the pavilion in time to get
the front row. I wonder if they are going to have the
front row reserved at the track meets this spring.

How in the world can I go to the Holdover Show
Saturday without being too conspicuous? They say that
last year it was a scream and almost beyond words in
spots. I am dying to see it, and I hope it is nice and
spicy and everything, but if the Phi Rhos see me there
I know what they will think.
Janet is such a gossip. (I hope 1 don't turn out to be
one.) She knows all the interesting things about all the
interesting people on the campus. We sat up until after
twelve last night talking.

Why did Jones quit running his still.
Oh, he had trouble brewing at home.

Why does Kafloofus keep six stenographers in that
small office? He only has work for one.
Well, that one does the work and the others have
something on him.

Census Taker (To old maid): , And how old are you?
Spinster (Coyly): I've seen twenty-eight summers.
Census Taker: Yes, and how long have you been
blind?
