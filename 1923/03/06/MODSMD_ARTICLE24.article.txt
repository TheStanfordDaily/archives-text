It is so difficult to possess a thing alone in this
world. When you are young everything you have be
longs to your parents, and what they do give you for
yours is usually fought over by all your brothers and
sisters and then given to "little sister" to play with, or
else handed over first to one and then another.
When you grow older your sister swipes your ties, or
comb, or sweater, or belt (it used to be your brother
until woman came into HER OWN). And then when
you are at college, your roommates own everything in
common with you, a modern bolshevistic, socialistic,
nostrumistic state where even your personal letters have
little more secrecy than the freshman poster hung on
the wall.
The gold Dad gave you for your education, also. What
the University doesn't get in tuition the co-eds do in
candies, cushions, and canoes. And when you marry
one of these pretty, alluring, gold-rimmed blondettes,
everything is our or hers, nothing yours. She plans and
you plan. Your plans are rejected as no good and hers
are accepted as hers. But if yours are good they are
accepted as ours. When the first-born needs discipline
he is your boy. She opens letters but lets you pay the
bills, and when you can't buy her a new hat she wonders
why you are so extravagant with our money.
Man can't hang onto a single thing in this world long
enough to call it his own. When his wife leaves him
she takes all her fortune with her, although you earned
it all. She Avill maintain, if she doesn't leave you', she
would have been a comfortable old maid but for you. If
she doesn't buy everything within reach, she preserves
our fortune intact for a rainy day and won't let you
dispose of a single cent of it until it passes through the
bank of the Leg of Nations and is entered 011 the books
of our budget record.
But even in a time of release you can't pass it alone.
If you loaf, you are told to move into the crowd; if you
spend some of your time with a taxi driver he makes
your fortune "ours."
And even when dead, if any tear should slip past
the censor to the grave, the mourners say what a good
man our husband, brother, father, was, and think they
will obtain a rich reward in heaven. If he goes below,
his bones are his own as far as the world is concerned.
No mourners lament. He was a (sincere, honest, or
brave) man —spoken of in qualified praise. But even
the bleached framework, in the final analysis, is pos
sessed. There are the worms! —O. W. TRUE.

candies, cushions, and canoes. And when you marry
one of these pretty, alluring, gold-rimmed blondettes,
everything is our or hers, nothing yours. She plans and
you plan. Your plans are rejected as no good and hers
are accepted as hers. But if yours are good they are
accepted as ours. When the first-born needs discipline
he is your boy. She opens letters but lets you pay the
bills, and when you can't buy her a new hat she wonders
why you are so extravagant with our money.
Man can't hang onto a single thing in this world long
enough to call it his own. When his wife leaves him
she takes all her fortune with her, although you earned
it all. She Avill maintain, if she doesn't leave you', she
would have been a comfortable old maid but for you. If
she doesn't buy everything within reach, she preserves
our fortune intact for a rainy day and won't let you
dispose of a single cent of it until it passes through the
bank of the Leg of Nations and is entered 011 the books
of our budget record.
But even in a time of release you can't pass it alone.
If you loaf, you are told to move into the crowd; if you
spend some of your time with a taxi driver he makes
your fortune "ours."
And even when dead, if any tear should slip past
the censor to the grave, the mourners say what a good
man our husband, brother, father, was, and think they
will obtain a rich reward in heaven. If he goes below,
his bones are his own as far as the world is concerned.
No mourners lament. He was a (sincere, honest, or
brave) man —spoken of in qualified praise. But even
the bleached framework, in the final analysis, is pos
sessed. There are the worms! —O. W. TRUE.
It is so difficult to possess a thing alone in this
world. When you are young everything you have be
longs to your parents, and what they do give you for
yours is usually fought over by all your brothers and
sisters and then given to "little sister" to play with, or
else handed over first to one and then another.
When you grow older your sister swipes your ties, or
comb, or sweater, or belt (it used to be your brother
until woman came into HER OWN). And then when
you are at college, your roommates own everything in
common with you, a modern bolshevistic, socialistic,
nostrumistic state where even your personal letters have
little more secrecy than the freshman poster hung on
the wall.
The gold Dad gave you for your education, also. What
the University doesn't get in tuition the co-eds do in
candies, cushions, and canoes. And when you marry
