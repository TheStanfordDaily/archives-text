# YALE GRADUATE STEALS AUTO; GETS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE
## 
### 
YALE â€”A Yale graduate was so
anxious to do research work in crim
inal psychpathology that he stole an
automobile and got eight months in
prison. Before being freed, he revealed
his identity and said he had been sen
tenced to Sing Sing but was not able
to do much because he was not a pris
oner and his field was accordingly
limited.
