# Electrical Engineers Visit San Francisco Stations
## 
### 
Last Saturday, the Electrical En
gineering Club visited Stations A and
B of the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany in San Francisco. President De
witt C. Bertrand and a dozen of the
Electrical Engineering Majors were
conducted through the stations by em
ployes of the company and afterwards
heard talks by several of the officials
upon the electrical apparatus, giving
sidelights on the practical side of the
work. This is one of several trips to be
arranged. The Stanford Club is a
branch of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers. According to
President Bertrand, there will be an
illustrated lecture by some prominent
engineer on March 15. The subject and
speaker are to be announced later.
