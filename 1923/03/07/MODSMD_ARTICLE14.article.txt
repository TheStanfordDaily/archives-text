# MUCH LABOR YET TO BE DONE ON NEW BUILDINGS
## 
### 
In the words of "Dad" Burrows, |
night watchman at Toyon Hall and the
new Encina Dining Quarters, these
buildings will be among the finest on
I the campus. Although he is now a
' night watchman due to the injury to
I his hand sustained while working on
a motor-driven saw, "Dad" has played
a part in the work of construction ever
since the initial grading. As one of the
chief carpenters, he had the roof
beams and other accessories ready
fully ten weeks before they were
finally hoisted into place. Since then,
; he has been employed with the usual
carpentry work so he confesses to I
quite an interest in the new buildings.
According to "Dad," work has not
} progressed as rapidly as it is at first
; apparent. To the uninitiated, the con
l struction seems to go in spurts, but
this is due partly to the weather and
I partly to the fact that much of the!
! carpenter work is done weeks in ad-J
I vance. At the present time things seem
very favorable in both buildings. The
roofs of the Encina Dining Hall are 1
, ready for the tiles, great progress has
| been made In the laying on of the
' surface cement coat in the courts and

i in the East Arcade, the concrete fioor
| ing has been poured in seven out of
the eight dining halls, and the work of
plastering has begun. The ceiling of
the great central kitchen has been
plastered and the partitions of the
twenty-eight bedrooms on the second
floor have been built. Still, "Dad" pre
dicts that the dining halls will not be
finished before another three months.
At Toyon Hall, the roofs of the wings
and of the central arcade have been
built, but the third story of the two
towers and the central section are not
yet ready for the concrete. Inside, the
1 erection of the partitions between the
rooms is going on at a rapid rate, and
Ihe removal of the molding boards on
| the lower floors nearly accom
plished. According to "Dad," Toyon
Hall will probably be ready for occu
pation by the Autumn Quarter.
As "Dad" stood in the doorway of his
little office in the gathering dusk of
the evening, he looked out over the
I new additions to the Stanford build
ings. "I used to be a contractor in San
Francisco," ho said, "and I know. These
buildings are the finest I have seen in
j a long time!"
