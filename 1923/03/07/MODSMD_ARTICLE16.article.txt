# SENIOR NINE SHOWS CLASS AND JUNIORS ARE BEATEN, 10-4
## 
### 
In defeating the juniors by a score of
10-4 yesterday afternoon, the senior in
terclass baseball team showed that they
were good for either first or second place
in the final league standing. The game
yesterday was a batters' battle, both
Kelly and Campbell being found for
eight hits.
The seniors scored first. "Shorty"
Mertz, having lined out a hot one in the
first inning, stole second. Bob Con
nolly was walked, and Edwards singled,
Mertz scoring. Connolly tried to take
one too many bases, however, and was
the loser in a game of tag between sec
ond and third sacks. Stevenson was
caught out at second.
The juniors showed their first class in
the third. Collins, Chandler, and Che
dister, the first three men up, all singled,
filling the bases. Collins was caught out
in the next play when Campbell tried to
sacrifice. Hawkins' sacrifice hit was
good, however, and Chandler crossed
the plate. Dwight rapped out a long
fly into left field which enabled Chedister
to score. With the bases full and two
men down the juniors were unable to
push one across, and they were left
stranded when Kelly puled together and
struck out that necessary third.
Their other two runs were made in
the fourth, when Collins started the ball
a-rolling again. With two out, Collins
singled, and was brought home when
Chedister got a pretty hit that took him
to third. Campbell brought Chedister
in on the next play.
So far the game seemed to be in the
cooler for the juniors. But came the
seniors' half of the fourth. The first
SQven men up, Mertz, Connolly, Steven
son, Edwards, Reed, Farish, and Loomis,
all made runs on a combination of two
errors, a walk, a three-bagger, and three
two-baggers. Kelly exercised his pre
rogative of pitcher and struck out. This
enabled Campbell to pull together, and
the next two were put away in the same
manner.
The juniors didn't have a prayer of
scoring the rest of the seven innings.
Stevenson brought in a tally for the
seniors in the fifth when he started the
inning by walking, was advanced by Ed
wards and crossed the plate on Reed's
sacrifice. Kelly made the other run for
the winners. First man at bat in the
sixth, he knocked out a homer in the
direction of the Pacific ocean. This end
ed the scoring for the game.
Trainer Denny and Director Davis
were umpires, Denny calling balls and
strikes in the most approved professional
fashion.
