# AN INTERESTING MAN
## 
### 
Why was the message which Burges Johnson
brought to the campus last night so eagerly received?
Because Professor Johnson is an interesting person
ality, it is true. Perhaps more because he has es
tablished intimate contacts with men of whom we
have all heard.
We like to feel that we have something in com
mon with great men. We like to see them in their
shirtsleeves and to find out that they hate to get up
in the morning as badly as we do. It may be because
the realization that they have the same human quali
ties as you and I gives us a little more hope of gain
ing recognition. It doesn't make the dividing line
between the great and the insignificant so hard to
cross.
One of the greatest aids in securing what we want
is getting acquainted with men who are achieving
their goals. College furnishes an excellent oppor
tunity to establish contacts with men and women
whom we will later l>e proud to say we know, and
who will make us more interesting to others who
have not had that advantage. There is no disgrace
in taking upon oneself a little of reflected glory.
The man who goes through college without mak
ing his scope of friendships as wide as possible is
losing something. Making friends takes time—
time which frequently is stolen from another valu
able occupation. It remains for the student to es
tablish a happy balance.
