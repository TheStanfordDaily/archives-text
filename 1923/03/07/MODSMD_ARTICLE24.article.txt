AN EXTRACT FROM the outline of the powers
of the Board of Athletic Control in the March Illus
trated Review reads:
"The Executive Committee of the Associated Stu
dents arranges all details of competition in major
and minor sports and administers through its man
ager the moneys allotted to these activities by the
Board of Athletic Control."
We read the paragraph seven times and failed to
find the typographical error.
