### 
With acknowledgements to H. J. 8., Cabbages offers a
running account of a day with the Stanford baseball
teams and their enemies.

Coach Wolter got a Peavy-y when Old Dame Fortune
failed to Patterson so he told Roy to Carver but the lat
ter hit Woodward and the bases were Fuller. Wallace
opened a Geiser of hits down the Lane and the runners
started to Cruse toward home, but the Green players
got Weiss and yelled "Nevers!" The home team was
soon out of the Woods and had Quayle on toast after
that. Whereupon Wolter called Deffebach and told him
to Parker in right field and let Follansbee. During the
fun a dame in the bleachers fainted and they had to
Carter outside and Draper over a fence. "Oh, Shaw,"
said Coach, "did Duffy Seay that?" He was so mad he
was Boylan, so he went out to Hunt for a doctor. "I
McCarron for her, but where is Oviatt?" said somebody,
and Wolter lost all his Valla and went back to the bench.

A little bit of Heaven fell from out the sky one day—
It fell right down into my lap and drove the blues away.
A brand-new kind of Heaven, and it works to beat the
cars —
That little bit of Heaven was a bottle of Five Stars.

The gent who wanted to know if Gianduja was related
to the Admiral had a brain loose somewhere.

For the doubtful benefit of the Five Hundred, Cab
bages will explain that the above monniker is articulated

If you didn't stop yonder quip the first time it went by,
you don't know your San Francisco. We recommend that
you take the bus—"Patronize the Line that Patronizes
You" —provided that you enjoy being patronized, and
alight at Fifth and Market in an hour and five minutes,
unless the bus goes hay-wire. After that it's your own
problem.

Don't do it now—it's almost ex time. On the other
hand, we can never be sure that we'll be back next
quarter.

Well, after a few years the new Endowmcntories will
be finished and then they'll shortly become Dormiterni
ties.

"Those low Delta Eetas turned off all our heat during
rushing season and the janitor told the frosh that we
left our rooms untidy. We're going to play poker in the
ball-room the evening of our next formal. We're tired of
having them get into the wrong apartment when they
come in all smelling of grenadine sundaes."

Section Hand: What a funny looking necktie that it!
It looks like scrambled eggs.
Second Hand: Veil, vat better do yu vant for a
breakfast tie, don't it? —WAMBA.
MORE SPRING STUFF
The poets sing
Concerning Spring,
And say the bird
Is on the wing.
Upon my word
That is absurd.
Because the wing
Is on the bird! —B.V.D.

Marian: But what?
Marion: Father kicked the goal.
