# FRATERNITY
## 
### 
The most deadly things in life are the commonplaces.
Even a natural-born idiot is on his guard against the
unexpected, and so protects himself to advantage some
times. But the everyday institutions, which nobody
questions, are usually deadly. No one thinks of patroniz
ing a shop in which inferior goods are sold: principally,
I suppose, because what we buy is being consciously or
unconsciously continually tested. Social institutions
generally are not subjected to one twentieth the testing
that a suit of clothes is, for example. We operate under
an elaborate pretense that all our practices, all our cus
toms, are infallible.
This state of things is exactly what a collection of
creatures like the human race, needs. I should be the
last critic on the face of the earth to want things dif
ferently. I am not a cynic (whatever some people may
think): nothing do I prefer more than for things to
remain as they are. Desirable specimens of the human
family are produced by subjecting them to struggle. If
the millenium ever arrives (and it will not), it will find
the earth peopled by a bunch of saplieads.
It is a curious thing that the greatest objection to the
fraternity system is one which can be urged against it
only when at its most efficient state; and this objection
is that a fraternity is horribly and incurably domesticat
ing. One of the reasons why youth is sent to college is
to get him out of the narrow, confining influences of his
family. This reason is a very important one: all the
more so because very few people will admit it. Fraterni
ties, when running smoothly, ball things up by exchang
ing one father (who may know something) for several
pseudo-fathers (who may know nothing).
Some silly person will infer that I am trying to shout
down fraternities. He is a liar and a blockhead (uot to
put the matter more reasonably). I am simply presenting
to those unfortunate people who believe that fraternity
life should be synonymous to that state a minister would
like to maintain in his home on Sunday afternoon, a
simple proposition which I defy them to refute; namely
that the more discord, the more family skeletons a fra
ternity finds itself possessed of, the greater men it pro
duces. If someone would only found a fraternity (honor
ary of course) for the undesirables (with a skull and
cross-bones for a pin), I should be charmed to guarantee
it the best one going.
We will now listen to the timid gentleman with the
statistics. —DOWNING MacGALLON.

the millenium ever arrives (and it will not), it will find
the earth peopled by a bunch of saplieads.
It is a curious thing that the greatest objection to the
fraternity system is one which can be urged against it
only when at its most efficient state; and this objection
is that a fraternity is horribly and incurably domesticat
ing. One of the reasons why youth is sent to college is
to get him out of the narrow, confining influences of his
family. This reason is a very important one: all the
more so because very few people will admit it. Fraterni
ties, when running smoothly, ball things up by exchang
ing one father (who may know something) for several
pseudo-fathers (who may know nothing).
Some silly person will infer that I am trying to shout
down fraternities. He is a liar and a blockhead (uot to
put the matter more reasonably). I am simply presenting
to those unfortunate people who believe that fraternity
life should be synonymous to that state a minister would
like to maintain in his home on Sunday afternoon, a
simple proposition which I defy them to refute; namely
that the more discord, the more family skeletons a fra
ternity finds itself possessed of, the greater men it pro
duces. If someone would only found a fraternity (honor
ary of course) for the undesirables (with a skull and
cross-bones for a pin), I should be charmed to guarantee
it the best one going.
We will now listen to the timid gentleman with the

The most deadly things in life are the commonplaces.
Even a natural-born idiot is on his guard against the
unexpected, and so protects himself to advantage some
times. But the everyday institutions, which nobody
questions, are usually deadly. No one thinks of patroniz
ing a shop in which inferior goods are sold: principally,
I suppose, because what we buy is being consciously or
unconsciously continually tested. Social institutions
generally are not subjected to one twentieth the testing
that a suit of clothes is, for example. We operate under
an elaborate pretense that all our practices, all our cus
toms, are infallible.
This state of things is exactly what a collection of
creatures like the human race, needs. I should be the
last critic on the face of the earth to want things dif
ferently. I am not a cynic (whatever some people may
think): nothing do I prefer more than for things to
remain as they are. Desirable specimens of the human
family are produced by subjecting them to struggle. If
the millenium ever arrives (and it will not), it will find
the earth peopled by a bunch of saplieads.
