# MENDER OF CAMPUS SHOES GIVES CHEER FOR FRIDAY
## 
### 
Sooner or later most campus foot
wear finds itself in the shoe shop in
the Union for repairs.
The owner of the shop, who has been
on the campus for twelve years, says
that Friday is the busiest day of the
week. On this day the college snake
wants his well-worn pumps mended,
and the rough has to have the heels
of his oxfords straightened so he can
go to the dance to which some "dumb
Stanford woman" has invited him.
Women like shoes with pointed toes,
and this kind of footwear usually needs
mending at the toes. The majority of
men's shoes that are brought to the
repair shop need new soles, because
men drag their feet along the ground
and thus wear out the soles of their
shoes first. Run-down heels are as
prevalent among the feminine footwear
as the masculine.
Clumsy people have a lot of scuffs
on the toes of their shoes and also
where the heels and insteps of the
footwear have a chance to rub to
| gether.

According to the owner of the cam
pus shop, some students forget to come
hack after their shoes for a month or
two. There are a few pair of boots and
oxfords that have been standing on
the shelf for a year waiting for then
owners to claim them.
Some students come into the shop
and drawl out, "Here, fix these shoes.
I'll be back after them in a week or
so."
Other students cast a furtive look
toward the door of the repair-shop,
take off their shoes, and sit down to
wait patiently, or impatiently, until the
shoes are mended.
