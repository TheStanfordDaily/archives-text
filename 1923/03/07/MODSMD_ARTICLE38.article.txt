# PROFESSOR ESPINOSA PUBLISHES FOLK LORE
## 
### 
The first volume of "Folk Tales
From Spain," by Professor A. M. Espi
nosa of the Spanish department, is
now on the press in the Stanford Uni
versity series.
There will be four volumes including
three hundred folk .lore stories. Many
of these tales were collected in 1920
when Professor Coester was on a six
months' walking tour of Spain for that
purpose.
The vitality of the oral traditions,
more than a thousand years old, which
he found in Spain, does not seem
strange when he considers that "in
many remote regions the people ac
tually live, eat, dress, work, and think
exactly the same way as the inhabit
ants did two thousand years ago."
Folk-lore collecting has been an in
terest with him since his connection
with the University of New Mexico in
1902 where he gathered material for
a series of ten articles which were
published in the American Journal of
Folk-Lore, beginning in 1910.
