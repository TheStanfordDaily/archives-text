# Professor's Bicycle Soon To Go Into Limbo; Motors Replace Pedal Vehicles
## 
### 
Packards, Wintons, and Dodges are
gradually replacing the old-fashioned
bicycle as a means of transportation
to and from the campus. The sight of
the professor peddling to his lecture
classes on his two-wheeled steed will
soon be a distant memory. Charges of
plutocracy have been made. In a few
years, it is said, the professor's bicycle
will take its place in the museum be
side the mastodon and the dinosaur.
Frequently, students are reported to
have been picked up by professors in
shining motors.
Many have speculated as to the rea-!
sons for this sudden display. The fact j
that many of the cars were purchased
simultaneously with the publication of
certain textbooks, may throw some 1
light on this subject.
