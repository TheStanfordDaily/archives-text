# Lots of Work and Little Play for University Night Watchman
## 
### 
Senator Stanford's Farm is a quiet,
orderly community during the daytime,
with certain notable exceptions around
Big Game season —but at night? Well,
yes, it is, but there we find other excep
tions graded by both time and place, and
because of these few exceptions a night
watchman is a foregone conclusion.
The work of the night watchman is
far from spectacular as a general rule.
There are numerous routine duties con
nected with the maintenance of the Uni
versity plant, and all of these must be
attended to before the quelling of oc
casional riots may be considered. That
makes the position an endless motony
with some few high lights scattered here
and there.
A reporter for the Daily Palo Alto
made a few rounds with the chief watch
man for the purpose of learning a few
facts connected with the University night
life. His conclusion was that most of
the Stanford population lives during the
day, but that the few who extend their
education after dark have an interesting
time of it.
Starting from the headquarters at the
Fire House, the Law and the Press
moved over to the New Union, where
the Law locked all the doors and win
dows. "I have to light all these stoves
every morning at 4 o'clock," he observed
glumly. "If they aren't hot, you fellows
don't eat."
The investigation then proceeded
across the Quad, dark except for a few
lighted windows indicating night work
by various professors. The watchman
who confines himself to the Quad was
found, and a recommendation of borax
for swollen feet was made while the
usual report was being signed. Casting
a roving eye about to see that all the arc
lights were in operation, the watchman
moved along toward the Museum and
cactus gardens.
It was a damp, foggy night, with the
moon barely fighting its way through the
fog. The martyr dogs raised a yelping
chorus as we passed the medical build
ings, and the watchman switched his
flashlight back and forth carelessly. As
i we penetrated deeper into the gardens
he began to walk faster, and his conver

sation became louder and more common
place. Past these we hurried blindly,
with the flashlight focused on the path.
"You ought to hear one of the Chinese
New Year's celebrations over there in
the bunk houses," said the watchman.
"Those boys certainly whoop it up about
that time." We passed a couple who
were sauntering abstractedly along, and
the watchman again increased his pace.
It seemed as if this part of his duty was
distasteful to him. Finally we were out
of the danger zone, and he drew a breath
of relief.
We emerged upon Palm Drive just as
a roadster careened past at a high rate
of speed, cutout roaring. "Naughty
speeder," muttered the watchman—or
words to that effect. "I've bad my eye
on that fellow, and I'll keep it there.
Now we'll go up to Encina."
We sat in the front hall of Encina for
some time, waiting for the local watch
man to appear with his report. Some one
shuffled along the hall, glanced at the
chief, pulled his hat low over his eyes
and made his uncertain way out the door.
There he stayed for several minutes,
staring at us through the window, and
after a time moved off. still uncertainly.
The watchman chuckled.
We spent some time at the hall while
the custodian, who was at one time
coachman for the Stanford family, told
us stories of the old days, the graveyard
for the racing stable, and happenings in
the old cook-house. Chats with the at
tendants at the electrical sub-station, the
power house, and other all-night scenes
of action passed a little more time, and
we moved up the Row to cover the other
end of the campus.
Except for a few houses which were
giving dances, there was nothing of in
terest. "Quiet night—end of the month
—everybody broke," explained the watch
man. A deep, dark entrance into Roble
pool to adjust something about the water
supply, and an ascent to the top of the
clock tower —just to see what it looked
like—completed the evening so far as the'
reporter was concerned. "Dead night—
awful dead night," said the watchman in
parting. "Come around again some time
and maybe there'll be something I can
show you."

It was a damp, foggy night, with the
moon barely fighting its way through the
fog. The martyr dogs raised a yelping
chorus as we passed the medical build
ings, and the watchman switched his
flashlight back and forth carelessly. As
i we penetrated deeper into the gardens
he began to walk faster, and his conver

sation became louder and more common
place. Past these we hurried blindly,
with the flashlight focused on the path.
"You ought to hear one of the Chinese
New Year's celebrations over there in
the bunk houses," said the watchman.
"Those boys certainly whoop it up about
that time." We passed a couple who
were sauntering abstractedly along, and
the watchman again increased his pace.
It seemed as if this part of his duty was
distasteful to him. Finally we were out
of the danger zone, and he drew a breath
of relief.
We emerged upon Palm Drive just as
a roadster careened past at a high rate
of speed, cutout roaring. "Naughty
speeder," muttered the watchman—or
words to that effect. "I've bad my eye
on that fellow, and I'll keep it there.
Now we'll go up to Encina."
We sat in the front hall of Encina for
some time, waiting for the local watch
man to appear with his report. Some one
shuffled along the hall, glanced at the
chief, pulled his hat low over his eyes
and made his uncertain way out the door.
There he stayed for several minutes,
staring at us through the window, and
after a time moved off. still uncertainly.
The watchman chuckled.
We spent some time at the hall while
the custodian, who was at one time
coachman for the Stanford family, told
us stories of the old days, the graveyard
for the racing stable, and happenings in
the old cook-house. Chats with the at
tendants at the electrical sub-station, the
power house, and other all-night scenes
of action passed a little more time, and
we moved up the Row to cover the other
end of the campus.
Except for a few houses which were
giving dances, there was nothing of in
terest. "Quiet night—end of the month
—everybody broke," explained the watch
man. A deep, dark entrance into Roble
pool to adjust something about the water
supply, and an ascent to the top of the
clock tower —just to see what it looked
like—completed the evening so far as the'
reporter was concerned. "Dead night—
awful dead night," said the watchman in
parting. "Come around again some time
and maybe there'll be something I can
show you."
Senator Stanford's Farm is a quiet,
orderly community during the daytime,
with certain notable exceptions around
Big Game season —but at night? Well,
yes, it is, but there we find other excep
tions graded by both time and place, and
because of these few exceptions a night
watchman is a foregone conclusion.
The work of the night watchman is
far from spectacular as a general rule.
There are numerous routine duties con
nected with the maintenance of the Uni
versity plant, and all of these must be
attended to before the quelling of oc
casional riots may be considered. That
makes the position an endless motony
with some few high lights scattered here
and there.
A reporter for the Daily Palo Alto
made a few rounds with the chief watch
man for the purpose of learning a few
facts connected with the University night
life. His conclusion was that most of
the Stanford population lives during the
day, but that the few who extend their
education after dark have an interesting
time of it.
Starting from the headquarters at the
Fire House, the Law and the Press
moved over to the New Union, where
the Law locked all the doors and win
dows. "I have to light all these stoves
every morning at 4 o'clock," he observed
glumly. "If they aren't hot, you fellows
don't eat."
The investigation then proceeded
across the Quad, dark except for a few
lighted windows indicating night work
by various professors. The watchman
who confines himself to the Quad was
found, and a recommendation of borax
for swollen feet was made while the
usual report was being signed. Casting
a roving eye about to see that all the arc
lights were in operation, the watchman
moved along toward the Museum and
cactus gardens.

the old cook-house. Chats with the at
tendants at the electrical sub-station, the
power house, and other all-night scenes
of action passed a little more time, and
we moved up the Row to cover the other
end of the campus.
Except for a few houses which were
giving dances, there was nothing of in
terest. "Quiet night—end of the month
—everybody broke," explained the watch
man. A deep, dark entrance into Roble
pool to adjust something about the water
supply, and an ascent to the top of the
clock tower —just to see what it looked
like—completed the evening so far as the'
reporter was concerned. "Dead night—
awful dead night," said the watchman in
parting. "Come around again some time
and maybe there'll be something I can
show you."
