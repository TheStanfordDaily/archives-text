The lecture will be illustrated with
pictures that Professor Coester took
when he was traveling in Spain, and
this will be the first time the slides

Spain. There will be slides showing the
people, and something of their life and
customs, and pictures of typical street

i scenes.
Professor Coester's lecture will be
j in English and any one who is inter
ested is invited to attend. Refresh
ments will be served at the close of the
' program.
