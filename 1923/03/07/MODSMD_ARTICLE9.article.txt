# WORK IN LITERARY SHOP DESCRIBED BY JOHNSON
## Former Editor of Judge and Outing Cites Reminiscences of Mark Twain, O. Henry 
### 
Glimpses of the people in the "Liter
ary Shop," the motives that actuate
them, the editor, and the part he plays
in the literary market were the main
points in a lecture given in the Little
Theater last evening by Professor
Burges Johnson of Vassar, who was
formerly editor of Judge and Outing.
" 'The Literary Shop' differs from
other shops in that the thing that is
bartered is a manuscript," said Profes
sor Johnoon. "A manuscript is a piece
of work that has someone's dreams
tied up in it that are interpreted to
the world.
"Inspirations for literary creations
come to the ready mind —a mind that
has been prepared by philosophizing
along some line. Then comes a sudden
glimpse of beauty or truth and a poem
is written. The creator must be able
to give to others the flashing vision
that he has had or it is worthless to
him. It is the driving task of interpre
tation and craftsmanship of words that
explains the author's flashing glimpse
to others."
In speaking of the work of the editor
in the "Literary Shop" Professor John
son said: "The great editors are men
with imaginative minds, who can
imagine what they want their maga
zine? to be like and then try to realize
their dreams.
"An editor lias to remember the com
mercial considerations of his task or
else there would be no market for
writers. It is his job to uphold ideal
ism."
Professor Johnson told some remin
iscences of Mark Twain and O. Henry,
with whom he was personally ac
quainted. According to Professor John
son. O. Henry was a quiet, unassuming
man, who found difficulty in expressing
himself in spoken words. He wrote
more naturally than he could talk.
O. Henry's friends kept him from
writing; so he moved away from them
and lived in a room above a small
French restaurant. He liked to watch
the people who came to the cafe and
got ideas for his stories by listening in
on their table-conversations.
"O. Henry was so inarticulate that
he couldn't tell his friends that he had
enjoyed their evening visit to liii
house. Instead he would pull on their
coat lapels and say, 'You know, I w«s
downtown today and I bid in on some
neckties and got them. Here, have a
necktie!' And if they refused he would
add, 'Well, I bid on some Joss sticks,
too. Take a couple of packages.' That
was O. Henry's way of saying, 'Glad
you came! Come again'."
Professor Johnson characterized
Mark Twain as a man with a mop of
white, curly hair, who always wore a
white suit and hat. Whenever he came
into the offices of the publishing
houses he called all the small boys to
his side and told them funny stories.
