# CARDINAL-BRUIN BOXING MATCHES ARE CALLED OFF
## Dr. Barrow Issues Statement Explaining Cancellation of Annual Fistic Tourney 
### 
Stanford and California boxing teams
will not meet at Berkeley tomorrow
night.
The reason for the change in plans is j
set forth in the following statement by
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of Physical
Education at the University, who gave
it out after he had notified the University
of California authorities of Stanford's
cancellation of the bouts:
"Stanford has withdrawn from the box
ing match with California scheduled for
Friday night. This step seems wisest
under the existing conditions, but it is j
hoped that relations may be resumed an-!
other year if these conditions can be
remedied.
"Boxing is, at best, a sport that calls
for constant care to keep it above criti-1
cism and also calls for the best of feel- !
ing between the participants. During the ;
past few years a number of points have
arisen for discussion in regard to the
eligibility of contestants, the conditions
under which the bouts are to be run, and
notably, the advisability of arranging
bouts between white men and colored
men, which have from time to time ap
parently been settled only to come up
for discussion again. The athletic re
lationship of the two universities is too
valuable to warrant the continuation of
these conditions and it seems best to dis
continue boxing between the two insti-1
tutions until a definite understanding can |
be reached.
"For three years in succession Stanford
defaulted bouts in which California had
entered a colored man. Last year, prior
to the bouts, California promised that no
more colored men would be entered, but
without advising us of their change of
plan, a negro was entered at the last
moment, apparently with the expectation
that we would again default the bout.
We did not default and the bout was
won by the Stanford participant. Fol
lowing this the Graduate Manager at i
California wrote a letter apologizing for j
what had happened, claiming that the oc
currence was due to a misunderstanding
on the part of the coavh. This year
California, about a week ago, signified
its intention of entering two negroes in
the Friday bouts.
"Regardless of the fact of whether
Stanford is right or wrong in her posi
tion, such procedure and such a lack of
understanding between the authorities
controlling this sport at the two uni
versities engenders bad feeling and be
cause we must, in accordance with our
policy, continue to default these mixed
bouts the spirit of fair competition is
lacking. Until the question can be de
cided and the bouts worked out on a
basis that will be fair to all the partici
pants it seems best to discontinue boxing
between the two universities.
"We do feel that a fight between a white
man and a negro engenders race preju
dice. Although it is our desire to draw
no color line and to place all students
in both universities on an equal footing,
it seems that in this particular sport, on
account of the public feeling as well as,
in some instances, of the feeling of the
participants, mixed bouts stir up race
feeling rather than do anything to estab
lish an equal status for the colored man.
"It is highly regrettable that the men
of both teams, regardless of their color,
who have been working toward this
match during the season should not have
a chance to compete, but holding the
match under the present conditions is apt
to have a bad effect on the spirit of the
men concerned that it will take several
years to remedy, and the wise thing
would seem to be to stop before our
hitherto pleasant relations have been
strained too far."
