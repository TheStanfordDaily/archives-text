# CARDINAL-BRUIN BOXING MATCHES ARE CALLED OFF
## Dr. Barrow Issues Statement Explaining Cancellation of Annual Fistic Tourney 
### 
Stanford and California boxing teams
will not meet at Berkeley tomorrow
night.
The reason for the change in plans is j
set forth in the following statement by
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of Physical
Education at the University, who gave
it out after he had notified the University
of California authorities of Stanford's
cancellation of the bouts:
"Stanford has withdrawn from the box

Friday night. This step seems wisest
under the existing conditions, but it is j
hoped that relations may be resumed an-!
other year if these conditions can be
remedied.

entered a colored man. Last year, prior
to the bouts, California promised that no
more colored men would be entered, but
without advising us of their change of
plan, a negro was entered at the last
moment, apparently with the expectation
that we would again default the bout.
We did not default and the bout was
won by the Stanford participant. Fol
lowing this the Graduate Manager at i
California wrote a letter apologizing for j
what had happened, claiming that the oc
currence was due to a misunderstanding
on the part of the coavh. This year
California, about a week ago, signified
its intention of entering two negroes in
the Friday bouts.
