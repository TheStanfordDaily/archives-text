By winning the Stanford 1923 basket
ball championship, the junior sextet
has proved that it is the strongest of the
Cardinal class squads. The juniors piled
up the highest score against the freshmen,
44-4, in the interclass series. Alice Roth
and Mabel McCanse, forwards, can cage
shots from the held or foul line.
The junior guards, Geraldine and
Josephine Franklin play a fast, consistent
game that holds down the opposing
team's score. The speed and teamwork
of the junior centers, Eunice Biddle,
Grace Strobel, and Kathleen Evans,
were largely responsible for the victories
that the 1924 sextet won.
The senior basketball squad made the
second best showing in the interclass
tournament by winning from the fresh
! men, 21-20, and gaining a victory over
the sophomores, 21-8. Hazel Church

man, forward, is accurate in held shots.
The senior centers, Virginia Burks, Joyce
Robson, and Marjorie McDonald, excel
in keeping tie ball in their forwards'
territory.
Mills College counts its sophomore
team as the best of its class sextets. Ac
cording to the record made in the inter
class tilts, the Stanford sophomores rank
third. Grace Judd and Doris Harter
have done good work at forward posi
tion. Polly Learnard and Ruth Stucky,
guards, know how to block the forwards'
attempts to score.
Even though the freshman team lost
all three games in the interclass contest
to upperelass squads, the 1926 women
have a good chance of winning from
their Mills rivals. In their tilts with the
sophomores and seniors, the freshmen
were defeated by close scores, 22-21 and
21-20. The freshman forwards, Ruth
Yredenburgh and Jean Ward, are equally
good at jnaking field and free-throw
