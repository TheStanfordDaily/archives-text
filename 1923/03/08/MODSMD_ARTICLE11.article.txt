# INTERCLASS TRACK TEAMS READY FOR ANNUAL RUN
## 
### 
All entrants for the annual interclass
track and field meet, to be held on the
varsity oval Saturday afternoon at 1 :30,
must sign up on the track by 6 p. m.
tonight in order to take part. Most
of the athletes now practicing on the
cinderpath have turned in their names
! for the various events they intend to
[enter and a number of members of the
track classes under Coach "Dink" Tcm
pleton have also signed up.
All students in the University, whether
i varsity or freshman track men, numeral
or block "S" men, or holdovers, will be
allowed to participate. The number of
men already entered in the dashes is so
great as to require the events to be run
off in heats. The first four places will
I be counted in the meet and awards will
be made to the point-takers.
As the teams line up as present, the
! seniors, as in the Irish Marathon, seem
! to have the edge, and barring upsets,
| should win the meet by a good margin,
i "Dink's" frosh squad has been organ
! izing to utilize all possible point-winners ;
by placing men where they may take ad
vantage of any openings in the ranks,
there is a chance to give the sombreros
I a close run.
The interclass meet was won last year
by the class of 1924, but with the loss of
Hartranft, Sudden, and Clark, who would
probably be good for twenty-five points,
they stand little chance of repeating their
victory.

All entrants for the annual interclass
track and field meet, to be held on the
varsity oval Saturday afternoon at 1 :30,
must sign up on the track by 6 p. m.
tonight in order to take part. Most
of the athletes now practicing on the
cinderpath have turned in their names
! for the various events they intend to
[enter and a number of members of the
track classes under Coach "Dink" Tcm
pleton have also signed up.
All students in the University, whether
i varsity or freshman track men, numeral
or block "S" men, or holdovers, will be
allowed to participate. The number of
men already entered in the dashes is so
great as to require the events to be run
off in heats. The first four places will
I be counted in the meet and awards will
be made to the point-takers.
As the teams line up as present, the
! seniors, as in the Irish Marathon, seem
! to have the edge, and barring upsets,
| should win the meet by a good margin,
i "Dink's" frosh squad has been organ
! izing to utilize all possible point-winners ;
by placing men where they may take ad
vantage of any openings in the ranks,
there is a chance to give the sombreros
I a close run.
The interclass meet was won last year
by the class of 1924, but with the loss of
Hartranft, Sudden, and Clark, who would
probably be good for twenty-five points,
they stand little chance of repeating their
victory.

All entrants for the annual interclass
track and field meet, to be held on the
varsity oval Saturday afternoon at 1 :30,
must sign up on the track by 6 p. m.
tonight in order to take part. Most
of the athletes now practicing on the
cinderpath have turned in their names
! for the various events they intend to
[enter and a number of members of the
track classes under Coach "Dink" Tcm
pleton have also signed up.
All students in the University, whether
i varsity or freshman track men, numeral
or block "S" men, or holdovers, will be
allowed to participate. The number of
men already entered in the dashes is so
great as to require the events to be run
off in heats. The first four places will
I be counted in the meet and awards will
be made to the point-takers.
As the teams line up as present, the
! seniors, as in the Irish Marathon, seem
! to have the edge, and barring upsets,
| should win the meet by a good margin,
i "Dink's" frosh squad has been organ
! izing to utilize all possible point-winners ;
by placing men where they may take ad
vantage of any openings in the ranks,
there is a chance to give the sombreros
I a close run.
The interclass meet was won last year
by the class of 1924, but with the loss of
Hartranft, Sudden, and Clark, who would
probably be good for twenty-five points,
they stand little chance of repeating their
victory.
