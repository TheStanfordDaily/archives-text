# Chappie, Pelly, Square Off For Match of Wits
## 
### 
Since Chappie and Pclly decided to
get together and put out a combined
issue April 2, there has been a great
scurrying about in both camps in at
tempts to collect a mass of copy suffi
cient to make the others green with
envy.
Pelly is fortunate in having a much
larger number of contributors than
the Old Boy, and that gentleman
has been scratching his dome for the
last few days, trying to think of ways
and means of collecting dope in large
quantities with prodigious speed.
After much cogitation he has de
cide?!, in a fit of generosity, to offer
double credit in the competition for
the Old Boy's Mug to those whose
work appears in the combined issue.
The cup contest is at present led by
a neck-and-neck gallop between half
a dozen living groups, with the other
contestants scattered, and this com
bined issue may prove the backstretch
that will bring some league out in
front.
Contributions must come in by
wagonloads in a hurry, or they will
be too late for the printers. Contri
butionsâ€”especially art work, includ
ing a profusion of cover designs, and
copy of medium length, should be in
Chappie's hands by Tuesday.
