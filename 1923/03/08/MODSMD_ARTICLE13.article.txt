# VARSITY WATER POLO MEN TO MEET BRUINS
## Game to Be Played Tomorrow Night at Olympic Club 
### 
Stanford and California water polo
varsities will meet in the Olympic Club
tank at 8 o'clock tomorrow night. These
two teams are among the best in this
part of the country, and both are en
tered in the national senior champion
ships in Chicago to be held next month.
On one comparative score, the two
teams look about equal, but on another,
the wearers of the Cardinal are given
a decided edge. Last Monday night, the
California varsity won from the San
Francisco All-Stars, 6-4. Two weeks
before Stanford beat the same team, 3-1.
This makes the teams look equal. But
the Cardinal freshmen beat the Neptune
Athletic Club, 18-1, while the California
varsity was only able to defeat the Nep
tune team, 10-0.
But Coach Ernie Brandsten is taking
care that his men are in good condition
when the two squads hook up Friday.
Yesterday, he took the entire squad to
San Francisco in order to acquaint them
with the salt water in the Olympic Club
tank.
The team will probably line up with
Fletcher, Meyers, and MacCallistcr at
forwards; Lacey (captain), Austin, and
Graham or Schmeider at backs, and Col
lctt in goal.
Lacey at back, Fletcher at forward,
and Collett at goal should do havoc in
the ranks of the Bruins. These three
men have been starring all season for the
Cardinal.
