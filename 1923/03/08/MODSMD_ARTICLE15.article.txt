# Freshman Water-Poloists To Flay Berkeley Cubs Before Varsity Contest
## 
### 
As a preliminary to the California-
Stanford varsity water polo game, the
Cardinal freshmen will try their skill
against the Berkeley first-year men, in
the Olympic Club tank tomorrow night.
The Stanford seven, which is unusually
strong this year, should win by a com
fortable margin.
