# CARDINAL VARSITY WINS FROM SANTA CLARA NINE 13-1
## Stanford Takes Early Lead And Missionites Fail to Score After Third Inning 
### 
Santa Clara failed to show any class
here yesterday and the Stanford Var
sity nine easily treated Joe Sneeze's
team to a 13-1 trimming.
The Missionites were never danger
ous in spite of the fart that they found
Loewenstein for ten safe bingles. The
Card pitcher kept the hits well scat
tered except in the third when Santa
Clara scored her only run. A double
play prevented further damage in this
frame. v
Stanford started off with a three-run
lead in the first inning. Mulchay, first
man, flied to left. Carver singled and
stole second, coming home on "Lefty"
May's double to right. McCandless was
out, Haneberg to Logan, and May ad
vanced to third. Woodward drove a
hard one between center and left
which got through Randazzo and rolled
to the fence. By the time the Santa
Clara elder recovered the ball, May
and Woodward had both counted.
Peavy ended the inning by flying out
to first.
The Saints scored their only tally in
the third. Bedolla beat out a bunt. Vu
kota tried to follow suit and popped to
Loewenstein who doubled Bedolla off
first. Randazzo tripled to left and Fitz
patrick scored him with a single over
second. Haneberg grounded to Peavy,
who got Fitzpatriek at second.
The Cards did not count again until
the third when they piled up three
more tallies. Their half of this frame
was full of thrills. May walked and
stole second. McCandless popped to
Logan. Woodward was out, Kelly to
Logan, May going to third on tlie play.
Peavy hit an easy one to Vukota who
threw to Logan at first. The throw
beat Peavy to the bag by ten feet but
it looked to the Card skipper like
Logan missed the base. Umpire Man
auk agreed with him. Meantime, the
Santa Clara infield had trotted off.
Peavy dashed for second and May for
home, each reaching his destination in
safety. After a great deal of wrangling,
the game continued. Heckendorf
walked. Patterson singled and Peavy
