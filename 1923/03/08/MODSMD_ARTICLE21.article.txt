# JUST A HOLIDAY
## 
### 
Tomorrow is a holiday—nothing more.
To the greater part of the student Ixxly it means
a chance to go to the city or to the coast, an oppor
tunity to catch up on studies before the finals, an
occasion for loafing without any qualms of con
science.
How many will give a thought tomorrow to Sena
tor and Mrs. Stanford, in whose honor the day has
been set aside? How many will refiect upon the ideal
that prompted a mother and a father, grieved by the
loss of their only son, to establish a university that
the children of California might be their children?
Worse —how many even know the circumstances
that brought about the existence of the institution
which they are proud to call theirs? While we're
dealing in rhetorical questions, how many will pay
attention to any lamentations which might appear
here regarding the indifference of college students
on such an occasion?
We are fond of belittling the motives which acti
vate people to do things for what they call ideals.
While sharing the gifts left by Mr. and Mrs. Stan
ford, we quite shamelessly spread scandalous stories
concerning their private life, with as little foundation
as most such stories have.
Dr. Jordan knew the founders of the University.
He is familiar with the incidents of its establishment,
lie has watched and guided its development to the
position of national respect which it now holds. To
morrow morning he will tell these things to those
men and women who are interested in the history
of thfrigs about them and in the personality of people
who have been an influence in their lives, directly or
indirectly. And as usual, the audience will be com
posed largely of Palo Alto citizens and a smattering
of students who already knew these things.
Yes, just another holiday—and back to classes
Monday.
