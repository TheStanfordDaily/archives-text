# FACT OR SUPERSTITION?

The student who expresses sympathy with the
Administration in any of its various activities is im
mediately condemned by his fellows as being un
thinking or a tool. Those who have actually investi
gated the facts concerning the building of dormi
tories, the conduct of athletics and other matters
which are rankling the student mind, ever ready to
assume an injustice, are in a position to offer criti
cism. Most of the dissatisfaction expressed against
Dr. Wilbur and the Board of Athletic Control is
based upon ignorance and popular superstition that
tiie students are being exploited. Would it not be
wise to assume that the Administration knows a
little bit more about running a University than the
average student—at least until we have secured facts
which prove the contrary.
