As long as other people can write reform articles and
get by with it (see the article below, if they've printed
it), Cabbages sees no reason why it too can not go in
for making the world better and more of it. your

It does seem terrific that next winter we shall have to
wade through the same elephantine mud-puddles along
by the postoffice, and tramp through the small seas that
form there when the rain comes, just because the side
walk is uneven, and has been allowed to remain such,
so that bodies of water of great magnitude find their
resting place there whenever p cloudburst arrives. If
one should ask someone, "Why are these uneven de
pressions in the pavement allowed to remain?" One would
probably answer, "No!" It is a harrowing thought in
deed to dwell on the terrible consequences that will
occur when, thousands of years from now, rough-shod
feet going to classes will have worn those depressions
down six feet or more beneath the surface, so that in the
dead of winter some unwary student will unnoticingly
put his foot in it and his head will disappear beneath
the rippling surface of the water while bubbles slowly
arising to the surface will tell his friends that it's time
his folks collected the insurance.

(Being a reform for next winter, just about enough
time will elapse so that all hard feelings with the paving
contractors will be forgotten.)

Well, if the pavement depressions aren't filled up,
there's another New Era that can be looked forward
to
Why is it, friends, that the swinging doors of the book
store are allowed to swing both ways? The story of the
tortoise and the hare clearly illustrates the danger of this
situation. The hare, you remember, was chasing the
tortoise, who, of course, had had a substantial lead at
the start of the race. The hare was fast closing in on
his prey, when the tortoise, using the berry, espied one
of the swinging doors such as the bookstore is equipped
with. This swinging door happened to be on a drug
store, but that makes no difference. The tortoise entered
the store by pushing in the swinging door. Pausing for
a minute just inside the threshold, he waited until the
hare was just at the top step, plunging in after him.
Then the tortoise deftly stepped aside and allowed the
swinging door to swing back with all its cyclonic force.
It hit the rabbit square amidriffs. and by the time he
recovered, Christmas had come and gone. Who can say
that the same thing will not happen here? How would
you like your senior .record to look like this: "Knife
and Fork Society (1). (2); Member Big Game Rally (2);
Hit by Swinging Door (2%); No Good After That (3),
(4)."
* * *
Having accomplished two substantial reforms, it's
about time to quit. If everything was fixed just right,
nobody could have any fun any more sending in contri
butions.

one should ask someone, "Why are these uneven de
pressions in the pavement allowed to remain?" One would
probably answer, "No!" It is a harrowing thought in
deed to dwell on the terrible consequences that will
occur when, thousands of years from now, rough-shod
feet going to classes will have worn those depressions
down six feet or more beneath the surface, so that in the
dead of winter some unwary student will unnoticingly
put his foot in it and his head will disappear beneath
the rippling surface of the water while bubbles slowly
arising to the surface will tell his friends that it's time
his folks collected the insurance.

time will elapse so that all hard feelings with the paving
contractors will be forgotten.)

Well, if the pavement depressions aren't filled up,
there's another New Era that can be looked forward
to
Why is it, friends, that the swinging doors of the book
store are allowed to swing both ways? The story of the
tortoise and the hare clearly illustrates the danger of this
situation. The hare, you remember, was chasing the
tortoise, who, of course, had had a substantial lead at
the start of the race. The hare was fast closing in on
his prey, when the tortoise, using the berry, espied one
of the swinging doors such as the bookstore is equipped
with. This swinging door happened to be on a drug
store, but that makes no difference. The tortoise entered
the store by pushing in the swinging door. Pausing for
a minute just inside the threshold, he waited until the
hare was just at the top step, plunging in after him.
Then the tortoise deftly stepped aside and allowed the
swinging door to swing back with all its cyclonic force.
It hit the rabbit square amidriffs. and by the time he
recovered, Christmas had come and gone. Who can say
that the same thing will not happen here? How would
you like your senior .record to look like this: "Knife
and Fork Society (1). (2); Member Big Game Rally (2);
Hit by Swinging Door (2%); No Good After That (3),
(4)."

Having accomplished two substantial reforms, it's
about time to quit. If everything was fixed just right,
nobody could have any fun any more sending in contri
butions.

It does seem terrific that next winter we shall have to
wade through the same elephantine mud-puddles along

form there when the rain comes, just because the side

so that bodies of water of great magnitude find their
resting place there whenever p cloudburst arrives. If
