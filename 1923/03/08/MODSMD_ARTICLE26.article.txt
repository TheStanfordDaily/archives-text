# THINK OF THAT
## 
### 
In what is apparently a sentiment of pique, the cafe
teria has closed its doors during the evening. I am
really very sorry that my article on eggs should have
had the unforseen result of denying the campus its
favorite dish (however poorly cooked) during the eve
ning. It appears that there is, after all, such a thing
as the power of the press.
I really cannot say that the explanations given de
ceived me at all. An establishment so excellently
managed is always assured of a highly satisfied clientele.
Of course it cannot be expected to cater to persons
possessing any degree of what may be called stomach
refinement; it is impossible (evidently) to cook large
quantities of food well: somehow the flavor is lost, and
the result has an emaciated appearance, like a hundred
"lifers" in Sing Sing seen together at vespers.
That a certain stupid class of persons should immedi
ately rise up demanding proof of excellent management
is to be expected. There are always some people who
will not be happy under any circumstances, unless the
rest of the world is miserable: for example—but here,
I must restrain myself. If proof is desired, proof shall
be had. Only this morning, while breakfasting, I saw
proof in large quantities. First, some one came in and
spent ten minutes making expert gestures, at which I
was lost in admiration. Then, some one else came in
and made other gestures. These were answered by fur
ther gestures from a third party already there. All three
were replied to by a look of comprehension (slightly
dumb) from a fourth party. When the three had retired
the fourth person made gestures to himself. If this is
not perfect management, I should like to know what
it is!
I am really not to be fooled so easily. I know it was
my egg article that did it. lam very sorry.
