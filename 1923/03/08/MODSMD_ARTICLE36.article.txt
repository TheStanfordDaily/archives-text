## 
### 
Mrs. C. G. Allen, wife of Professor
Allen of the Romanic Languages depart
ment, talked to Roble Club Tuesday
noon on the Glee Club concert to be
given March 16. The girls were given
the opportunity of reserving a block of
seats for the performance before the
regular sale begins. Mrs. Allen made a
plea for a large audience for the club,
adding that it was not tickets sold, but
the actual number present that counted.
According to her, the Stanford Glee
Club was mentioned in the Century
Magazine, as one of the best in the
country.
"The movement of getting behind the
Glee Club should come first of all from
the students," said Mrs. Allen.
