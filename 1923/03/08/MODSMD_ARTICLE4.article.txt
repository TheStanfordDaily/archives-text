# English Club Rehearses For "Will Shakespeare"
## 
### 
Dramatization of the rather mys
terious life of Shakespeare, as imag
ined by Clemence Dane, modern
novelist and author of "Bill of Di
vorcement," a New York and Lon
dan success, is "Will Shakespeare,"
the four-act "invention" which is
being rehearsed for presentation by
the English Club 011 April 6.
"Will Shakespeare" is a modern
play. It is neither an example of
Elizabethan drama nor a historical
play; it is the modern treatment of
facts as known about the life of
Shakespeare and as imagined by
Miss Dane.
Clemence Dane has been con
cerned only with the man behind
the drama.
"I have tried to write the story
of â€¢Everyman,' and have called it
Shakespeare," is the author's ex
pression of her object.
