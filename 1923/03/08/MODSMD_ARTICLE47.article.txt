# FOUNDRY DESCRIBED IN FIRST PRIMER CLASS FOR FROSH
## 
### 
The University foundry is near the
chapel. After paying syllabus fees,
some consolation is needed, but the
desire of the investigator is strong af
ter talking Biology I, so to the foundry.
Flames shooting in the air! Sparks
flying! A pall of smoke I A deep ro&r!
Pictures often called up while in
chapel, but this time it was real! The
foundry was in full blast.
What a complicated place! A sign on
the wall warns you to "put flasks away."
It sounds like what is known as "a joint,"
but flasks are only the iron containers
in which the molds are put. The men
stamp the sand down in the flasks just
as Italians, we are told, stamp the grapes
in wine presses. When it is solidly
packed around the patterns, some pow
der, which smells like macaroons, is
sprinkled on top to prevent the mold j
from sticking, ostensibly. Then it isj
punched full of holes, so when the metal
is poured in blue flames shoot out.
Did you ever hear of brass or alumi
num sand? Well, it is kept in a place
exactly like a horse trough. Speaking
of association of ideas, the foundry is
punster's paradise.
Domestic science is vaguely analagous
to foundry work. There are ovens in
which they cook cores—cores made of
sea-sand, water and molasses. They
don't taste at all sweet, though. Cores
are put in the ends of mold patterns, so
when the metal is poured in it will not
fill out tlie whole pattern. Another in
teresting preparation which is used to
tamp the cupola spout is made £>112 flour,
sand, sawdust, and water. I don't know
how appetizing that is.
The crane is very intriguing. Four
tags are suspended from the top, on each
of which is marked "east," "west,"
"north," and "south." (Sounds like a
Mah-Jongg game.) Somebody pulls one
and the crane takes you up to the ceiling,
provided you have your feet in the ropes
and hang on grimly. Then the other
tag is pulled and you go sailing across
the room. Exhilirating? Right!
A "riddle" looks like a sieve, and
"combs" and "gates" are holes in the
mold, all of which is important, for, as
I said before, the foundry is a very
complicated place.
