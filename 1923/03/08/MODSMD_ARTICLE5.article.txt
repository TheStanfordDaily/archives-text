# BABE NINE DEFEATS SANTA CLARA PREPS
## Freshmen Overcome 4-Run Lead and Take Game, 5-4 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
boys displayed a startling and gratify
ing reversal of form against Santa
Clara preps yesterday afternoon on the
freshman diamond that took first place
by a score of 5 to 4. The tendency to
fight the ball, which has been worry
ing the babes for a week or so, has
disappeared, and the first-year men
came through with just one excusable
error chalked up against them.
The peculiar thing about the game
was that the Stanford men shoved
over five runs on six singles and two
errors. The Santa Clara team account
ed for seven blows including a home
run, triple, and two doubles, and were
able to make them count for only four
scores. The freshmen showed a strong
come-back and ability to perform well
in the pinches which did them great
credit.
The visitors the home
plate in the fourth, but went into it so
hard that they had no reserve strength
left for the rest of the fray. Mawrey
lofted a neat single out to center field
which hit a rock and bounced over
Meiklejohn's head, allowing the Prep
per to stretch his blow into a Babe
Ruth. Carson beat out a high bounder
to Green for a hit, and Suzany ad
vanced him to second on an infield out.
Martin poled the ball through center
field for a double and scored Carson.
W. O'Brien fanned, but Ryan stepped
into one of Ditzler's shoots and reach
ed third before the ball was returned
to the infielders. Martin scored on the
triple, and Ryan came down the home
stretch a moment later when Ditzler
uncorked a wild pitch.
The four-run lead seemed to take the
' fire out of the Saints, and with the ex
i ception of Kalgareff's double in the
I following frame they went hitless. An
' error, stolen base, and infield out put
I Kalgareff on third in the semi-final,
but Nevers tightened up and retired
the side.
The babes were unable to solve
1 Cotti's delivery until the fifth frame.
Lovelace and Lucas singled to open
the inning, and "Paddy" Draper eased
them along with a pretty bunt. Mc-
Dermont got a life when Mawrey jug
i gled his bounce to third, and Lovelace
crossed the plate on the same bobble,
i Lucas scored and Oviatt was safe at
first on a fielder's choice that failed
to work out. With McDermont on third,.
. Smith bunted and brought him in on
a squeeze play, Oviatt stopping on
1 third. Dickey grounded to short, end
ing the inning, with the babes one run
behind.
After two unsuccessful attempts, the
yearlings got some more action in the
eighth. Smith dropped a Texas Leaguer
just over first base and Dickey bunted
: him to the next station. Meiklejohn
popped to short, but Green drove a
â–  single to left field, Smith scoring the
! tying run. Lovelace singled to right
and the fielder allowed the ball to go
through him. Green made good with
the score which counted, and Lovelace
j stopped on third while Lucas grounded
ut and closed the inning. Nevers regis
i tered three strike-outs in the ninth, as
did Ditzler in the fifth.
The babes will meet Willows High
School Friday at 1:30 on the freshman
diamond and play a return match with
Berkeley High Saturday on the varsity
field at the same hour. Ditzler, Nevers
and Oviatt will divide the mound work.
