# BABE NINE DEFEATS SANTA CLARA PREPS
## Freshmen Overcome 4-Run Lead and Take Game, 5-4 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
boys displayed a startling and gratify
ing reversal of form against Santa
Clara preps yesterday afternoon on the
freshman diamond that took first place
by a score of 5 to 4. The tendency to
fight the ball, which has been worry
ing the babes for a week or so, has
disappeared, and the first-year men
came through with just one excusable
error chalked up against them.
The peculiar thing about the game
was that the Stanford men shoved
over five runs on six singles and two
errors. The Santa Clara team account
ed for seven blows including a home
run, triple, and two doubles, and were
able to make them count for only four
scores. The freshmen showed a strong
come-back and ability to perform well
in the pinches which did them great
credit.
The visitors the home
plate in the fourth, but went into it so
hard that they had no reserve strength
left for the rest of the fray. Mawrey
lofted a neat single out to center field
which hit a rock and bounced over
Meiklejohn's head, allowing the Prep
per to stretch his blow into a Babe
Ruth. Carson beat out a high bounder
to Green for a hit, and Suzany ad
vanced him to second on an infield out.
Martin poled the ball through center
field for a double and scored Carson.
