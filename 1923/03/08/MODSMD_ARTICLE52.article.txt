# LIBRARY NOW SHOWS SHAKESPEARE'S WORKS
## 
### 
A collection of volumes of Shake
speare's works, showing all types of
editions from the early quartos, some of
which were published in the author's
lifotimc, folios, and later edited publi
cations, is now being shown in the Li
brary in one of the display cases at the
head of the stairs.
This year is the tercentenary of the
publication of the first Shakespeare folio
in 1623. Up to that time only a few of
the separate plays had been printed in
the quarto form.
The first folio was published seven
years after the death of Shakespeare.
The publishers were William Jaggard,
his son Tsaac, William Aspley, John
Smethwick, and Edward Blount.
The collection contains several vol
umes from famous later editions put out
by noted editors. One is from the set
edited by Alexander Pope and another
is from the Oxford edition.
One of the interesting points of the
selections is the difference in the por
traits of Shakespeare which each vol
umes contains.
At present the Library owns a very
complete collection of the fifty important
editions of Shakespeare's work. Only
fifteen are lacking and several of these
have no independent importance.
