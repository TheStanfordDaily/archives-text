# Stories by Chekhov Are Now on New Book Shelf
## 
### 
A set of ten volumes of short stories
by Anton Chekhov, translated from the
Russian by Constance Garnett, is on
the new book shelf this week. Chekhov
has been called the Russian Maupas
sant. There is a great temperamental
difference in the two for Chekhov as
sumes a more kindly, good-humored
attitude toward his characters. His
work presents the modern Russian,
especially life of the educated class,
and for that reason his work is valu
able to the student. The collection in
cludes short humorous sketches,
stories of the life of the town, province,
peasant, and outlaws. It also contains
a few short farces and psychological
studies.
"The Centennial History of Illinois"
from the period 1673-1918, by Clarence
Walworth Alvord of the University of
Illinois, is now on the new book shelf
also.
The work is a complete history of
the conquest of the Mississippi valley
by the white man. It touches on the
lives and work of the men that have
been influential in its growth, from the
humanitarian, Father Marquette, to the
utterly selfish John Dodge and the
unique man of United States history,

Abraham Lincoln. The last two vol
umes differ in character from the rest
in an attempt to picture Illinois after
a hundred years of statehood and the
subsequent economic and political de
velopment.
