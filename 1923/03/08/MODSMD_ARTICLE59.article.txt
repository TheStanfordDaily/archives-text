# Professor Coester Gives Lecture to Spanish Club
## 
### 
Professor Alfred Coester of the Ro
manic Languages department gave an il
lustrated lecture on Spain last night at
the Spanish Club meeting at the Women's
Clubhouse, following an hour of danc
ing from 7 to 8.
Ihe lecture was illustrated with pic
tures taken by Professor Coester when
traveling in Spain, and included a va
riety of scenes from the different periods
of civilization.
One of the most interesting of these
was an immense bridge made of huge
granite blocks so perfectly fitted together
that no mortar was used. Much of the
architecture was characterized by the use
of arches that made the buildings similar
to the style expressed in the arches in
the University buildings.
