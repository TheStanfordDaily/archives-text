Next Thursday evening the Stanford
gymnasts will invade the California

repeating their last year's victory. "Al"
White, '24, Wayne Smith, '20, Max Hop
per, '24, Ed Miller, '23, Paul Wilbur,
'24, and Don Sneddon, '23, captain, will
make up the Stanford team.
Medals will be given to the five best
all-around gymnasts on the floor. Last
year Stanford men won second, third,
and fifth places as all-around men. The
two high point men on the Stanford
team will receive a circle "S" for their
1 showing.
California is reputed to have a strong
team this year. Silver, Stevenson, and 1
Ojer are the star Berkeley acrobats and
1 will make a strong bid for the awards.
