# R.O.T.C. IS PRAISED BY GENERAL MORTON
## Review Carried Off Well; Final Formation Monday 
### 
"I am surprised and pleased by the effi
ciency and skill shown by the Stanford
field artillery unit," said Major-General
Morton, ninth corps area commander, in
an address to the R. O. T. C. yesterday
afternoon, following the inspection. The
unit had drilled but twice in preparation
for the General's visit.
General Morton spoke briefly on the
R. O. T. C. in the ninth corps area. He
said that although the Western states far
exceeded their quota of men, they suf
fered from lack of equipment and officer
instructors because the congressional
military appropriation had not provided
for R. 0. T. C. units.
The review was carried off in perfect
form. The salute of thirteen guns was
well timed, no difficulty being experi
enced with misfires or pammed shells, as
was th case last year. It was expected
that there might be some trouble with
the draft animals in Battery "A," but
fortunately the refractious horses seemed
to realize that they were under the eyes
of a general staff officer, and behaved
well. *
There will be a final formation for the
year Monday afternoon at 1 o'clock, at
which the military department requires
all men to be present.
