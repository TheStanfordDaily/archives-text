## Dr. Jordan Will Speak; Seniors to Officiate 
### 
Stanford's unique beginning, com
pared with the foundation movements
at Yale, Harvard, and Johns Hopkins
university; and how each one has con
tributed to hte world, will be discussed
by Dr. Jordan tomorrow morning at
the Founders' Day service in the Me
morial Church at 11 o'clock.
"A university is not a place to teach
folks, but a place where they can
I teach themselves," said Dr. Jordan the
other day, in defining the true purpose
of learning. "It is not meant to teach
people opinions, facts, and mere book,
learning, but how to use books, nature,
and their own brains. ... if this is not 1
accomplished, students should be
shown the nearest way to the edge of
the campus."
Dr. Gardner will officiate at the ser
vice, and the University choir will sing
a selection from the "Creation." Fol
lowing Dr. Jordan's address, the Senior
Class is to conclude ceremonies with
the transference of flower duty to the
Junior Class at the mausoleum.
All seniors wlil meet in the vestry 1
promptly at 10:45 and juniors are to
assemble in front of the church. A spe
cial section will be reserved for them.
