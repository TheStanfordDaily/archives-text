# VARSITY WATER POLO SEVEN DEFEATS BRUINS
## Cards Overcome California Lead In Second Half and Win Right to Represent Stanford in East. 
### WALT CAMPBELL 
In a game full of thrills, the Stan
ford water-polo varsity administered a
7-to-4 defeat to the California seven
last Friday night in the Olympic Club
tank. With the second half well under
way, and trailing their more brilliant
opponents 2 to 4, the Cardinals started
a furious rally which netted five goals,
and the victory.
California staked her chance for vic
tory on excellent individual work, and
lost to the superior teamwork of the
Stanford men. California, playing the
open style of game, was helpless when
the Cardß opened up with superb pass
ing in the second half.
Bruins Take Early Lead
The first half was all California's.
Although scoring in the first few min
uter on a clean shot by Meyers, the
Stanford men went up in the air and
didn't descend until "Fish" Herrington
of California had scored three goals.
A minute before the end of the half,
however, "Jinny" Austin, fighting like
mad, Bwam the length of the pool, and
caged a pretty shot. Score at half
time: Stanford. 2; California, 3.
Stanford Comes Back Strong
Coach Ernie Brandsten must have
sent his men back into the pool with
a determination to win, for the Card
inals cut loose, and showed their heels
to the Californians.
The Bears scored for the last time
when Herrington caged the ball on a
pass from O'Brien. At this point, Stan
ford began the rally which lasted until
the end. McCallister shot a pretty goal,
Fletcher missed a chance, and McCal
lister shot again, evening up the score 1
at 4-aH.
Shortly after the whistle, Meyers
shot a fast one through that put Stan
ford in the lead, 5 to 4. McCallister
scored after some excellent work by
Lacey and Fletcher; Meyers scored
again, and the game was over.
Mitchel and Herrington Star
George Mitchel. captain and center
back of the Bruins, and "Fish" Her
rington, forward, lived up to their ad
vance notices. Mitchel was probably
the fastest man in the tank. He was
just about all of California's defense,
taking the ball away from the Cardinal
forwards time after time. Herrington
shot all four goals for California.
Cards Profit by Teamwork
The entire Stanford team played al
most flawlessly, inasmuch as the work
of Captain Lacey and Austin, at backs,
was outstanding. Although Fletcher
shot no goals, he played a consistent
passing game, often times putting his
teammates into a position to score.
McCallister and Meyers were both in
excellent form, having no trouble in
hitting the goal.
Trip East Assured
This victory assures the trip East
for the Cardinal seven to compete in
the national senior championships. On
the basis of Friday night's win, the
Stanford varsity is conceded an excel- 1
lent chance to annex the national title. !
