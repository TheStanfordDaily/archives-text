# "Bill of Divorcement" Helps Explain "Will Shakespeare"
## 
### 
The fact that "Wili Shakespeare," the
English Club presentation to he given
April 6, was written by the author of
"Hill of Divorcement," explains in part
the essentially modern character of the
drama. Clemence Dane, the young Kng
lish author, is considered by reviewers
the coming woman novelist of the pres
ent day.
"All my life T have read Shakespeare,"
said Miss Dane. "When 1 don't read
Shakespeare I am devouring detective
shockers. I read little modern fiction—
frightful confession for a novelist, isn't
it? T steep myfcelf in crime every night
before I go to bed and then I wonder
about 'Macbeth' and what sort of a
woman, after all, was the lady in the
case."

The "Rill of Divorcement" won great
praise and enjoyed long runs in both
New York and London in 1922. It was
translated for immediate production in
Warsaw, Florence and Prague soon after
the initial London showing. Miss Dane
has also written three novels: "Regi
ment of Women," "hirst the Sword,"
and "Legend."
Five years of stage experience gave
Miss Dane a thorough knowledge of the
practical side of playwriting. including
exits, entrances, and technique.
"My greatest sorrow," Miss Dane has
said, "is that every one contrasted 'Will
Shakespeare' with 'Hill ot Divorcement.'
To me there is no confliarison. The one
is my best work; the other, the ordi
nary. well-written play."
