"Standardization is the bane of higher education. The business of a higher
education is to bring out whatever is best in the character of the individuals
who are educated." This was the message given by Dr. David Starr Jordan
in his address in Memorial Church on Friday morning as a part of the
Founders' Day exercises.
"The children of California shall be my children," said Senator Stanford
after the death of his son Leland, and Stanford University rose as a monument
to this resolve. Senator Stanford visited Harvard, Yale, Cornell, and Johns
Hopkins University to Rain ideas which would help to make Stanford a great
University. He secured the best professors from these institutions, and with
an endowment of thirty million dollars Stanford University was founded.
Senator Stanford had no particular interest in a religion of creeds but hC

man to his life work. H© believed that God was good to man and his bounty
consisted in man being able to reach out and get what was his due."A.
generous education should be the birthright of every child in the country"
was the motto that Senator Stanford had plaeed on the back of the University
register. t ,
In comparing Stanford men with those from other universities. Dr. Jordan
said: "What do we want, to give to Stanford men? We want to teach them to
think, to use their minds on books, nature, and men, to know how to find out.
what they do not already know...The dominant idea in Stanford University
not that the function of the human hand is to hold up a book but it is to
serve as an agent of the human mind. Initiative and eagerness are the
dominant characteristics of the Stanford man and woman."
Dr. Jordan discussed the major professor system at Stanford and the
advantages of the present system of education over the old classical courses,
stressing the importance of volitional or vocational elements in : the present,
niethods. . ; .
"Colleges can only serve us whon they aim not to drill but to «;reate. Ability
to form opinions is the choicest privilege of the educated man," concluded pr.
Jordan.
Following the lecture, the members of the Senior and Junior classes pro
ceeded to the mausoleum, where the duties of the flower committee was
1 transferred from the Senior to the Junior class.
