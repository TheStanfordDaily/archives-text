# SOPHOMORES LOSE TO FAST SENIOR NINE
## 
### 
By a score of 11-1, tlie seniors de
feated the sophomore learn in the inter
class baseball game last Thursday after
j 110011. As can be seen by the score, the
I game was not as close as was previously
Ipredicted. After the seniors had scored
ion Johnson for six runs in the first jo
ining, Aydelott was put in the pitcher's
box and managed to bold the senior •
jgregation to live runs during the
| iii|4 eight innings. "Lefty" Rogers a
twirler for the senior team, pitched a
j consecutively good game throughout,
holding the sophomores to their single
run. The game was a very unequal bat
tic between, first, Rogers and Johnson,
and in the latter part, between Rogers
land Aydelott.
The linc-up of the two teams is as
I follows:
