# THE 						TEST OF THE FUTURE
## 
### 
Freshmen of '26 are living in an era when Stan
ford traditions are being" modeled, remodeled, and
discarded. We have seen the passing 1 of the baseball
fight, and experienced the thrill of the poster fight;
Roughs' day has been altered, and the new sen' >r
sponsor system placed into operation.
Perhaps it is with this last we are more greatly
concerned. The very fact that sophomore hazing
has been declared null and void should mean little*
or nothing to us. After all, it is action that counts,
Mas freshman hazing stopped? Are the seniors up
holding their standards?
In fairness we might ask if the freshman is doing
his bit. Our first wild thoughts on the establishing
of the new system were "Ah! now 1 shall do as I
please," and many of us strutted alx>ut without dink,
queened on the Quad and walked up the Law Steps,
and got away wiffi it.
ft was primarily the aim of the sponsor system to
avoid disciplining by the sophomores that might lead
to physical injury, not to allow first-year men to
tromp haphazardly over the path of traditions.
Therefore, it is only fitting that we should put our
shoulder to the wheel and co-operate in pushing the
new custom to the pinnacle of success, for it means
more to us, perhaps, than to other undergraduates
in the University.
Next year as, we greet the new Freshman Class let
our aim be tp instill .in the members a love for things
that are Stanford's. The usual motto of "treat 'em
rough" is a cowing one. Treat 'em rough and you
will mold Stanford men who fear to look you in the
eye, who slink off in the corner afraid that your next
word will be.one of scorn and criticism.
Is it a good thing to shove the duty from our
shoulders and place all responsibility on the seniors?
In this way we can avoid many of the pitfalls, beyond
doubt, but certainly it is not the manly thing to do;
why not take up a portion of the burden and see the
thing to a finish, '26?
