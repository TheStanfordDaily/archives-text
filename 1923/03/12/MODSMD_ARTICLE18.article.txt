Tlicre is something undcfinable about empty
Itleachers that seems to work 011 the mind and spirit
of tiie athlete to a point where it makes him lose in
terest in the contest he is playing. This is especially
true of the baseball player. That something which
is transferred to him from the stares of a full grand
stand is enough to change the routine of the most
uninteresting game. lie at once feels there is some
thing to. work for, that people are looking forward
to his next move, and nine times out of ten lie com.cs
through with the goods'
A good example of this was shown in the fresh
men game with Berkeley. Students, on their way
from the intcrclass track meet had paused to see
what the "babes" were up to. Until the arrival <>112
the crowd the score had remained 1-1. but immedi
ately after the effect of the rooters had been felt tiie
freshmen were able to stage a wonderful exhibition
of ball playing and scored six runs in one inning.
The support of the crowd was disinterested, but it
brought the '26 team to its feet long enough to make
the ball game like a track meet. One discouraging
feature was the lack of little gray dinks in the crowd.
AN EDITORIAL in the San Francisco Chronicle
daitns that "the man who is proud of what he accom
plished yesterday admits he is incapable of doing as
well today." Many freshmen came to Stanford with
more or less of a recommendation as leaders in their
respective high schools. They are justified in look
ing back with a certain pride on those achievements
â€”but arc they doing as well or better at Stanford?
