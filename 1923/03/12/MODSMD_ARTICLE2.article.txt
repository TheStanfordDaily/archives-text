Meeting but little opposition, the fresh- 1
man water polo seven won a clean-cut
6 to 0 victory over the California first
year men in a game played as a prelimi
nary to the varsity contest last Friday
nijjht. Coach Ernie Hrandsten's Cardinal
Italics outplayed their opponents at every
stage of the game.
The first score came a few minutes
after the start, wheti Captain Mack shot
through a clean hard shot. From that
time on the babes had no trouble in 10-j
rating the goal. Only wildness kept them
from running up a much higher score,
hour of the goals were shot by Mack,
while O'Connor caged two.
Mack, Allen, and O'Connor played
steady games at forwards, the latter
clearly demonstrating why he is to be
taki'n to Chicago with the varsity. Lewis
and Langley were thorns in the sides of
the liruin cubs. Hard to get around, and
lighting every minute of the game with
out a let-up, these two men kept the op
posing forwards well at bay.
Cole in goal and McGettigan and Shu
maker, who alternated at back, also
played well. Cole showed a cool head
and quickness in the water.
