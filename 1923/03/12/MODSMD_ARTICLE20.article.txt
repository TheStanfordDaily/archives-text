My dear readers, you can never know what an in
justice I'm doing you today by writing this stuff, and
stealing another's glory. But after all, what's in a name?
An onion by another name would smell as sweet.
But getting back to the point under discussion, don't
you think that patriotism is the most noble of emotions.
When you think of a hero, kissing good-bye to his wife,
and marching off to war—the thought just reduces me
to tears. Or when you think of him, thwarted in his
love, running from the house, jumping upon his horse,
and riding off in every direction —Oh! girls, I'm just
thrilled pink.
But here, I'm wandering again. As I told you before,
I always like my eggs fried hard for breakfast Any
other wal leaves such disgusting stains on one's' shirt
front. And the laundries make such a fuss about clean
ing them off. But then, my laundry-man likes eggs, too,
and it seems that he eats them every morning.
However, my laundry is perfectly managed. In the
lunch room I have dumb waiters, who stand around and
make gestures. Gestures, after all, are probably as good
a mode of talking as anything else. Perhaps it would
be an excellent idea to propose some day—that people
cease to talk so much, and confine all speech to gestures.
But alas, I fear me that this article might have some
effect. For, next to the revolver, the press is the second
in power. But power, now, that's a separate thing by
itself. —DOWNING A. GALLON.
