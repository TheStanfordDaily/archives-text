# Glee Club Will Present Same Program Friday as That Scheduled on Trip
## 
### 
Plaintive strains of "Mill's Mill Board"
have been cchoing and wailing around
the Assembly hall for the past few
w.fks. Late passersby have been struck
with the touching melody and nearly
reduced to tears. According to Arnold
Bay ley, it is the Glee Club on the last
lap of its preparations for the Home
Concert, Friday night, that is making
this harmony.
Baylcy says that the Glee Club will
attempt something new this year. The
same program that has been arranged
for the Glee Club's trip will be presented
to the campus Friday night. This means
that the more serious numbers will be
interspersed with stunts and humorous
songs. Thus, says Mayley, the happy
medium between jazz and classical music
will he struck.
Tlx tickets, at 50 cents and $1, are now
on sale at the Bookstore and at Cran
dall's in Palo Alto. The price has been
lowered this year, say reports, in order
that the "snake" can take his "sweetie"
without such sad effects to the quickly
shrinking pocketbook.
