Stanford and Mills College broke even ;
by the above scores in the interclass has- j
kctball tourney played Saturday morn-!
ing on Roble held.
The teamwork of the Stanford centers]
and forwards on the Senior Class squads j
was a big factor in their defeat of the
Mills team, which scored but one field
goal during the entire contest. Mill dis
played a poor offensive and failed to {
cover the Stanford centers, thereby al- j
lowing them to feed the ball to their
forwards, who were accuate in shooting
goals. The game was rather a slow af-j
fair. The score at half time was 11 to 1 j
in favor of Stanford. Hazel Church
man made a total of five field goals, and j
one free throw, and Joyce Robson netted
ten tallies for Stanford.
The brilliant defensive work of Jose
phine Franklin and Geraldine Franklin,
guards, was largely responsible for Stan-1
ford's win in the 'J'mior Class game.
Dorothy Grcenleaf, who made all seven j
of Mills' points, located the basket when-!
ever she got the ball, which was very I
seldom, due to the successful efforts of j
the "Twins" in keeping the sphere out
of enemy territory. Whenever the Mills
centers attempted to toss the hall to their |
forwards one of the "Twins" promptly '
blocked it arid sent it hurtling back to '
her own teammates. Alice Roth made )
six of Stanford's field goals, while Malx-1,
McCanse tossed the ball in four times j
from the field, but mised five out of six !
free throws. Mills displayed her best i
tteamwork in the center, although Mar-j
garet Brown did stellar work at the!
guard position despite the fact that she j
played practically the whole game with I
a bad knee. The score at half time was I
11 to 3 in favor of Stanford.
The Mills sophomores were out for!
quantity, and they got it. They dis- j
played excellent teamwork and speed in |
play, and the game was much faster than I
the score would indicate. Helen War
rack. the "wonder" forward from Mills,
chucked in field goals with machine-like
precision,* netting .38 points for Mills.
Her style of shooting was unguardable. j
The Stanford forwards got the ball at
number of times, but were unable to lo- i
cate the basket.
The freshman contest was the closest j
of any played in the tourney. Poor j
guarding by the Stanford freshmen in I
the first half of the game gave Mills a
big advantage, and with Anita Van
Husen's accurate shots Mills piled up 11
points at half time to 7 for Stanford. In
the second half the guarding was much
better, the frosh coming out of the deep
coma in which they had been plunged.
Jean Ward and Ruth Yrcdenbcrg were
given many more opportunities to shoot
for the basket than in the first half, but
they failed to take advantage of them.
Cecile busier played a splendid game at
guard for the Stanford freshmen.
