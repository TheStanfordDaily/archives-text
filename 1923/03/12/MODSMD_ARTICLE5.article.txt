Led by Lane Falk the seniors had
little difficulty in winning the annual
interclass track and field meet held
last Saturday afternoon on the Varsity
track field. The seniors had a thirteen
point lead over the freshmen who
came second with forty-one points.
Juniors were third, and the sopho
mores brought up the rear in the
events of the afternoon.
Falk, varsity track captain, took first
place in both the 120-yard high hurdles
and the 220-yard low hurdles. Then, to
prove his ability was not all along one
line, he entered the shot-put and jave
lin throw and succeeded in taking
fourth place in each of these events.
Bill Black made the best jump of his
career in the pole vault Saturday.
Black went over the bar at 12 feet
8 inches, and then the bar was raised
to the 13-foot mark. Bill tried once but
failed to get over. On the next attempt
he cleared the bar by several inches.
The height of the jump was measured
with a tape to determine if a new
record had been set, hut .lie tape
showed a jump of 12 feet 9 3 8 inches,
which is an inch less than 'the Stan
ford record.
Several of the freshmen showed up
well. This class should develop good
varsity material to replace Falk.
Hayes, Black, and other stars who will
leave this year.
"Looie" Gaspar took tlw 100-yard
dash in 10 2-5, and "Ted" Millar.,an
other babe, won his heat n the cen
tury, and copped first in he furlong
in 22 3-5. Boles pushed Ft lk for the
lead in the 220-yard low hurdles, and
was but a few inches behind him at
the finish. Bill Richardson '26, won
the half mile with a good sp-int in the
last hundred yards, coming up from
I fifth place.
Van Judah had little trouble in win-
I ning tin l 440-yard dash. He took the
j pole at the start and gradually in
! creased his lead throughout the race.
| His time was 51 2-5, and would prob
j ably have been better if he had been
| pushed for first place. Shermutul, a
| soph, ran a heady race and came in
second, ahead of Harvey Coverley.
Hayes, a senior, had little trouble in
j winning the two-mile run. He was
; fifteen yards ahead of Hurley, who
| cauie second. Clifford's fast pace at the
j start of the race told on him and he
! was only able to get fourth.
The juniors won the relay, covering
the distance in 1:32 2-5. Eddie Sudden
ran first for the third-year men and j
; secured and held a substantial lead,
j Sudden is not in college this quarter,
; but if is possible that he will re-enter
at the start of next quarter, and if
this is true his presence on the track
team is certain to mean several points
in the coming meets.
Bill Wright took first in the broad
jump with a leap of 21 feef. 2 inches.!
! "Lou" Minsky was unable to do better
than 20 feet, which gave him second
i place. The high jump went to William
j T. Kemnitzer with a jump of six feet.
Bill Richards won the shot-put when
i he threw the cannon ball 42 feet 4
j inches. This mark is good for this time
of the season and Richards can be
i counted on for some points in the
Big-Little meet. Fred Ludeke took sec
ond place.
Campbell and Richards couldn't get
much distance into their discus throw
ing. The best that Campbell could do
was 119 feet 1 inch, which won the!
j event. Richards tossed the plate 121
I feet, buf stepped out of the circle and
his throw was not counted. In the
javelin Harlow won first with a throw
j of 169 feet 8 inches.
