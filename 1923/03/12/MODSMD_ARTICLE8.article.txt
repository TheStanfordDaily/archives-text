# BABE NINE WINS TWO CONTESTS
## Willows and Berkeley Are Defeated by Decisive Scores, 12 to 10, 13 to 1 
### 
Two victories, one against Willows
High School, and another against
Berkeley High sent the freshman ball
stock soaring in the markets of Possi
bility last Friday and Saturday after
noons, when the babe ball tossers
overwhelmed the Prep nines 12 to 0,
and 13 to 1, respectively, on the Var
sity field.
Preps Lack Skill
The Willows High game, Friday,
was marred by the clumsiness, and ut
ter lack of self-confidence on the part
of the high school players. Errors were
numerous and only half the freshmen
runs were actually earned. It was a
one-man defensive game with "Tod"
Oviatt, freshman pitcher, heaving a
scratchy two-hit contest and a nine
man offensive, all the babes donating a
share of the winning runs.
Scoring for the freshmen began in
their half of the first inning when
Lovelace scored Smith and Dickey on
a single. Other scores followed in the
third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh
stanzas.
Oviatt Hurls Close Game
"Tod" Oviatt kept the prep squad
guessing throughout the full nine in
nings of the fracas, at no time relent
ing or overworking. He struck out
eleven men.
McDermont proved the iron man
