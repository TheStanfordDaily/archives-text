"The Creation." an oratorio by Haydn, J
which was sung by the University choir i
nnder the direction of Warren D. Alien'
University organist, in the Memorial
Church Friday night, was a fitting close
to a day set a'sidc for reverence to the |
memorj of Stanford's founders. The
University choir was assisted by the j
Mountain View Choral Society, under |
Mr. Neil Darrah and others. Accom- j
paniment was by members of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and}
Myrtle Klahn, organist.
The soloists were Mrs. Lorna Lach
mund, soprano; Mr. Hugh j. Williams,
tenor, and George H. Madison, bass, i
Mrs. Lachmund sang the roles of the
Angel Gabriel and Eve. Williams rep
resented the character of Uriel, while
Madison sang the role of Raphael and
Adam.
The oratorio, which is the outgrowth
of the sacred drama, had much of a
spiritual nature in the interpretation of
the themes*. The chorus were in part in
spired by a deep religious emotion, while
the solos were more of a description of
Biblical narrative. The orchestration
was a very outstanding feature of the
oratorio in the effective imitations of
nature.
"The Creation" brought out the con
tinuity of the feelings expressed in the
music, demonstrating the superiority of
the oratorio over a disconnected or va
ried program. The Memorial Church
was filled with an appreciative audience,
who recognized the force and beauty of
the production.
There was a variety of expressions
from those movements representing
chaos to the more quiet interpretations.
The program was inspiring and .showed
much care in the details of score.
