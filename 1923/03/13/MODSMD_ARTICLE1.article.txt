# "WILL SHAKESPEARE" TO BE PRESENTED EARLY NEXTMONTH
## Powerful Drama Deals With Real Human Experiences, Says Clemence Dane 
### 
"I have thought of him as a man who
ate his breakfast like other men," Miss
Dane, author of "Will Shakespeare," to
be given by the English Club on April
6, has said, emphasizing the fact that
her drama deals with the human ex
periences of the man behind the drama
and does not merely portray the life of
a great Elizabethan.
Henslowe's diary and Shakespeare's
sonnets have afforded the material which
the imagination of Clemence Dane has
used, together with the few facts known
about the rather mysterious life of the
great poet, in constructing the drama,
"Will Shakespeare."
"I only tried to indicate what might
have happened. I wanted to get at the
causes that produced 'Macbeth' and
'Hamlet.' I believed so thoroughly that
all great creative writing comes from ex
perience, engendered by sorrow and suf
fering that I chose Shakespeare, the
greatest writer of all, to prove my
point."
" 'Will Shakespeare' is not only one of
the most pleasing of plays; it is also one
of the most unusual which has yet ap
peared in this season of experiment and
novelty. And of all the playwrights
who have resorted to eccentric methods
Miss Dane seems to have been most suc
cessful in accomplishing her purpose.
Since she is a workman of integrity, part j
of that purpose was to disguise her play's
eccentricity. She was so successful in
this that the chorus who stand ready
to acclaim the bizarre did not even real
ize that anything bizarre had appeared."
The above, a quotation from the
Bookman, is a sample of the enthusiasm
with which reviewers are considering
the production at the National Theater,
New York, of "Will Shakespeare."
The unusual, even mystic, atmosphere
of the play has especially been lauded
in criticisms of the Winthrop Ames
presentation. The Bookman continues:
i "What more extraordinary assault on
| the convention of orthodox drama could
Ibe denied? Yet no other method could
| have invested the story of 'Will Shake
speare' with the haunting charm which
j this play has."
Criticizing the production, the Current
j Opinion says : "Clemencc Uane. the Eng
! lish dramatic author of a recent Broad
way success, 'A Bill of Divorcement,' has
I scored again in an entirely different ac
cent, with 'Will Shakespeare,' which, as
'an invention,' admirably cast and pro
duced by Winthrop Ames, has disarmed
those critics who also are Shakespearean
students. It is agreed to be a 'brilliantly
written romance' and 'a beautiful spec
tacle.' "

of that purpose was to disguise her play's
eccentricity. She was so successful in
this that the chorus who stand ready
to acclaim the bizarre did not even real
ize that anything bizarre had appeared."
The above, a quotation from the
Bookman, is a sample of the enthusiasm
with which reviewers are considering
the production at the National Theater,
New York, of "Will Shakespeare."
The unusual, even mystic, atmosphere
of the play has especially been lauded
in criticisms of the Winthrop Ames
presentation. The Bookman continues:
i "What more extraordinary assault on
| the convention of orthodox drama could
Ibe denied? Yet no other method could
| have invested the story of 'Will Shake
speare' with the haunting charm which
j this play has."
Criticizing the production, the Current
j Opinion says : "Clemencc Uane. the Eng
! lish dramatic author of a recent Broad
way success, 'A Bill of Divorcement,' has
I scored again in an entirely different ac
cent, with 'Will Shakespeare,' which, as
'an invention,' admirably cast and pro
duced by Winthrop Ames, has disarmed
those critics who also are Shakespearean
students. It is agreed to be a 'brilliantly
written romance' and 'a beautiful spec
tacle.' "
"I have thought of him as a man who
ate his breakfast like other men," Miss
Dane, author of "Will Shakespeare," to
be given by the English Club on April
6, has said, emphasizing the fact that
her drama deals with the human ex
periences of the man behind the drama
and does not merely portray the life of
a great Elizabethan.
Henslowe's diary and Shakespeare's
sonnets have afforded the material which
the imagination of Clemence Dane has
used, together with the few facts known
about the rather mysterious life of the
great poet, in constructing the drama,
"Will Shakespeare."
"I only tried to indicate what might
have happened. I wanted to get at the
causes that produced 'Macbeth' and
'Hamlet.' I believed so thoroughly that
all great creative writing comes from ex
perience, engendered by sorrow and suf
fering that I chose Shakespeare, the
greatest writer of all, to prove my
point."
" 'Will Shakespeare' is not only one of
the most pleasing of plays; it is also one
of the most unusual which has yet ap
peared in this season of experiment and
novelty. And of all the playwrights
who have resorted to eccentric methods
Miss Dane seems to have been most suc
cessful in accomplishing her purpose.
Since she is a workman of integrity, part j
of that purpose was to disguise her play's
eccentricity. She was so successful in
this that the chorus who stand ready
to acclaim the bizarre did not even real
ize that anything bizarre had appeared."
