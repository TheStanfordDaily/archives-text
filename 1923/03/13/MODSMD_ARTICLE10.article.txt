# TWENTY FIVE MEN WILL GO SOUTH FOR U.S.C. MEET
## Southern Team, Weakened by Loss of Corey, Emmons, and Richards, Still Formidable 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Twenty-five varsity track men
will leave the campus for Los
Angeles at the end of the quar- j
terly examinations March 23
and will meet the cinder path
athletes of U. S. C. on the follow
ing day in a dual meet. The track
men have been rounding slowly
into shape during the present quar
ter and will be in good condition
for the competition with the
southern university. Several week
ly meets have been held to keep
up the interest of the men and
the intensive training period will
begin at the conclusion of the dual
meet Saturday with the Olympic
Club.
From present indications, the Stan- j
ford track men will have a slight edge ;
on the U. S. C. runners, who are with- j
out the services of Corey and Emmons J
in the high Jump and pole vault, both :
able performers. While Paddock has'
been declared eligible to run in the;
coming meets U. S. C. has scheduled
with Stanford and California, the
southern university is still without
Richards, who has been declared in
eligible.
In the sprints the Stanford
squad presents its strongest front
but has really shown no outstand
ing class as yet. Hale and Camp
bell should come through with i
places if they are in condition to
compete in the south. Clark will
also run in one of the sprints. Van
Judah may enter the 100-yard dash
and Wright the 220-yard dash.
Falk will compete for Stanford in 1
the hurdles and should take both of I
the faces if he continues the form dis
played in the interclass meet Satur
day. Coverley, Shermund, and William
son will run on the relay team in all
probability with Scofield a possible
fourth, and an entry in the pole vault.
Elliott and Charles will enter two
races in the south, both running tire
mile. Elliott also will run the two-mile
and Charles the half. Daley will run
in the half-mile with Mcintosh, Dole,
or Moody, depending on the outcome
of the meet Saturday. Daley, who ran
a pretty race Thursday, was slightly
off form in his event Saturday and
should improve his pace in the meet
this week. Murphy and Hayes should
participate in the two-mile event and
stand good chances of taking a couple
of places. With good timing of the ■
various laps, both men should show to |
advantage.
The status of the pole vaulters
is most encouraging with three
men who should cop the first three
places in that event in Los An
geles. Black is steadily improving
as are Dennis and Scofield, all of
whom should make over twelve
feet regularly from now on. Kern
nitzer and Ludeke are practicing
the high jump at good heights and
with a little more definite applica
tion of their knowledge should in
crease their marks by several
inches.
Wright, who made a broad jump of
21 feet 2 inches in the interclass meet
Saturday, has been practicing for only
two weeks and should easily increase
his distance by at least a foot before j
the U. S. C. meet. Minsky has not j
been doing much jumping so far this |
season.
Harter and Campbell heave the dis
cus well and with Arthur and Richards
in the shot-put should manage to take
a place or two. Harlow and Farish
handle the javelin successfully and
have been making more than 175 feet
in practice.
The list of men from whom the
twenty-five to make the trip will prob
ably be made, are: Hale, Campbell,
Van Judah, Bob Wright. Bill Wright,
Clark, Falk, Coverley, Shermund, Wil
liamson, Scofield, Mcintosh, Moody, !
Dole, Daley, Elliott, Charles, Thayer, i
Swayne, Minsky, Murphy Hayes,
Black, Dennis, Kemnitzer, Ludeke.

From present indications, the Stan- j
ford track men will have a slight edge ;
on the U. S. C. runners, who are with- j
out the services of Corey and Emmons J
in the high Jump and pole vault, both :
able performers. While Paddock has'
been declared eligible to run in the;
coming meets U. S. C. has scheduled
with Stanford and California, the
southern university is still without
Richards, who has been declared in
eligible.
In the sprints the Stanford
squad presents its strongest front
but has really shown no outstand
ing class as yet. Hale and Camp
bell should come through with i
places if they are in condition to
compete in the south. Clark will
also run in one of the sprints. Van
Judah may enter the 100-yard dash
and Wright the 220-yard dash.
Falk will compete for Stanford in 1
the hurdles and should take both of I
the faces if he continues the form dis
played in the interclass meet Satur
day. Coverley, Shermund, and William
son will run on the relay team in all
probability with Scofield a possible
fourth, and an entry in the pole vault.
Elliott and Charles will enter two
races in the south, both running tire
mile. Elliott also will run the two-mile
and Charles the half. Daley will run
in the half-mile with Mcintosh, Dole,
or Moody, depending on the outcome
of the meet Saturday. Daley, who ran
a pretty race Thursday, was slightly
off form in his event Saturday and
should improve his pace in the meet
this week. Murphy and Hayes should
participate in the two-mile event and
stand good chances of taking a couple
of places. With good timing of the ■
various laps, both men should show to |
advantage.
The status of the pole vaulters
is most encouraging with three
men who should cop the first three
places in that event in Los An
geles. Black is steadily improving
as are Dennis and Scofield, all of
whom should make over twelve
feet regularly from now on. Kern
nitzer and Ludeke are practicing
the high jump at good heights and
with a little more definite applica
tion of their knowledge should in
crease their marks by several
inches.
Wright, who made a broad jump of
21 feet 2 inches in the interclass meet
Saturday, has been practicing for only
two weeks and should easily increase
his distance by at least a foot before j
the U. S. C. meet. Minsky has not j
been doing much jumping so far this |
season.
Harter and Campbell heave the dis
cus well and with Arthur and Richards
in the shot-put should manage to take
a place or two. Harlow and Farish
handle the javelin successfully and
have been making more than 175 feet
in practice.
The list of men from whom the
twenty-five to make the trip will prob
ably be made, are: Hale, Campbell,
Van Judah, Bob Wright. Bill Wright,
Clark, Falk, Coverley, Shermund, Wil
liamson, Scofield, Mcintosh, Moody, !
Dole, Daley, Elliott, Charles, Thayer, i
Swayne, Minsky, Murphy Hayes,
Black, Dennis, Kemnitzer, Ludeke.

Twenty-five varsity track men
will leave the campus for Los
Angeles at the end of the quar- j

athletes of U. S. C. on the follow
