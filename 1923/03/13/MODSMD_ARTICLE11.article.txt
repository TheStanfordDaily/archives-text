# SENIORS LOSE TO FRESHMAN NINE IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
The senior horseshoe and the senior'
bench-talk seemed to have lost their!
potency yesterday afternoon when I
"Husky" Hunt's freshman diamond J
squad after having been defeated by j
sophomores and juniors, both of whom
were in turn beaten by the seniors, emu- j
lated the proverbial worm, executed an }
abrupt about face, and defeated the j
seniors by a score of 5-4.
The seniors took the lead in the first |
inning. With one man down, Loomis got
a single, Farish was walked, and both I
men came home on Connolly's bingle.!
Ditslcr was able to strike the next two
men out In their half the 1926 men
got one run. Dickey was leaned, stole
second, and managed to round the horn
on Greene's single.
In the third inning the freshmen took
the lead. Nevers lined a hot onej
through shortstop that carried him to;
second base. Green came through with j
another hit that took Nevers home, and j
then stole second and third on over- j
throws in the infield. He crossed the j
plate a little later on the catcher's muff.
Reed evened the score in the fourth j
when after singling he stole second and j
third and tallied on a passed ball. Rog
ers managed to push the seniors one run
ahead in the next inning, hitting a long
fly into center field that resulted in a
homer when the freshmen muffed. In
the sixth the seniors made a pretty triple
play that pulled Rogers out of a hole.,
With no outs and a man on first and
second, Lucas knocked a fly into left
field that looked like a hit in any league;
but Loomis came steaming in like a com
pound mallet, swooped it up and tossed
it to Reed, to Piggott, before men
caught off their bases recovered from
their surprise.
Then came the seventh iuning. The
seniors were still leading, 4-3. The fresh
men were last at bat. Kohler got to sec
ou an error. Ditzlcr was caught off first.
Smith was walked. Dickey struck out.
Then with two down Ernie Nevers came
to bat, and knocked a pop fly out past
second. Whether it was the darkness
that was responsible, no one can say, but
just as every oue was preparing to con
gratulate the seniors on winning the in
terclass league, the second baseman
muffed; and two runs had already
crossed the plate.

ers managed to push the seniors one run
ahead in the next inning, hitting a long
fly into center field that resulted in a
homer when the freshmen muffed. In
the sixth the seniors made a pretty triple
play that pulled Rogers out of a hole.,
With no outs and a man on first and
second, Lucas knocked a fly into left
field that looked like a hit in any league;
but Loomis came steaming in like a com
pound mallet, swooped it up and tossed
it to Reed, to Piggott, before men
caught off their bases recovered from
their surprise.
Then came the seventh iuning. The
seniors were still leading, 4-3. The fresh
men were last at bat. Kohler got to sec
ou an error. Ditzlcr was caught off first.
Smith was walked. Dickey struck out.
Then with two down Ernie Nevers came
to bat, and knocked a pop fly out past
second. Whether it was the darkness
that was responsible, no one can say, but
just as every oue was preparing to con
gratulate the seniors on winning the in
terclass league, the second baseman
muffed; and two runs had already
crossed the plate.

Freshmen Position Seniors
Smith 2b Reed

Nevers cf . Wingard
Green 3b Milo
Lovelace rf Cravens

The senior horseshoe and the senior'
bench-talk seemed to have lost their!
potency yesterday afternoon when I
"Husky" Hunt's freshman diamond J
squad after having been defeated by j
sophomores and juniors, both of whom
were in turn beaten by the seniors, emu- j
lated the proverbial worm, executed an }
abrupt about face, and defeated the j
seniors by a score of 5-4.
The seniors took the lead in the first |
inning. With one man down, Loomis got
a single, Farish was walked, and both I
men came home on Connolly's bingle.!
Ditslcr was able to strike the next two
men out In their half the 1926 men
got one run. Dickey was leaned, stole
second, and managed to round the horn
on Greene's single.
In the third inning the freshmen took
the lead. Nevers lined a hot onej
through shortstop that carried him to;
second base. Green came through with j
another hit that took Nevers home, and j
then stole second and third on over- j
throws in the infield. He crossed the j
plate a little later on the catcher's muff.
Reed evened the score in the fourth j
when after singling he stole second and j
third and tallied on a passed ball. Rog
ers managed to push the seniors one run
ahead in the next inning, hitting a long
fly into center field that resulted in a
homer when the freshmen muffed. In
the sixth the seniors made a pretty triple
