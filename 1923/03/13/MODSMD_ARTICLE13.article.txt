# HOLT PROPHESIES RUIN OF EUROPE IF LEAGUE FAILS
## United States Is Ablest of Nations and Does Least, Says Peace Union Leader 
### 
Prophesying the probable advent of
the United States into the League of
Nations, and the miserable dissolution
of the League in case America does
not enter, Hamilton Holt, director of
the Church Peace Union, spoke in the
Assembly Hall last evening in behalf
of the international peace movements
that are being carried on abroad.
Holt says, "Europeans consider that
America is the most able of the na
tions and is doing the least. Everyone
I have talked to is agreed that Europe
is in a worse condition today than it
has been any time since the armistice.!
It is not so much in danger of war and j
revolutions as of dissolution. The wise
men believe that there a retrogression
to something like the dark ages, i
Civilization is evaporating and every
thing is reducing to a materialistic
basis. If the League of Nations hadn't 1
been standing in the breach the laati
three years there is no knowing where
we would be today."
In discussing the significance of
Article 10, which at present is keeping
.the United States out, Holt said that
he was certain that in time the United
States would get the international at
itude of the League and come into it
without forcing the other members to
strike out the Article. "When this hap
pens much more may be done to allevi
ate conditions as they are in Europe
today," says Holt.
The Reverend Mr. Henry Atkinson,
in giving an address preliminary to
Holt's talk, declares that war can be
indicted from every reasonable stand-!
point, and that is a dismal failure as a
means of settling disputes.
"Every great war in the history of:
the world and back of it some eco- j
nomic injustice. Germany hoped to
gain economic control of Europe
through its transasiatic railroad and
possession of Constantinople. The
whole world banded together to defeat j
Germany and now the whole world is j
uniting to put her on her feet. Europe
is in too bad a condition today to tell
who won the war." He promised ex- j
tinction of civilization unless a pro-,
gram is adopted to outlaw war through
public opinion and a definite body to
take the place of war in settling dis
putes is organized.

"Every great war in the history of:
the world and back of it some eco- j
nomic injustice. Germany hoped to
gain economic control of Europe
through its transasiatic railroad and
possession of Constantinople. The
whole world banded together to defeat j
Germany and now the whole world is j
uniting to put her on her feet. Europe
is in too bad a condition today to tell
who won the war." He promised ex- j
tinction of civilization unless a pro-,
gram is adopted to outlaw war through
public opinion and a definite body to
take the place of war in settling dis
putes is organized.
