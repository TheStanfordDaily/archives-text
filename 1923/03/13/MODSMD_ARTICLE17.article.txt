# CARDINAL NINE WILL MEET SANTA CLARA FOR SECOND TIME
## 
### 
Coach "Joe Sneeze's" Santa Clara
nine is scheduled to meet the Stanford
var√üity for the second time on the lo
cal lot tomorrow afternoon.
Last Wednesday, the Cards gave the
Red and White nine a 13-1 trimming
and they are going to repeat tomor
row. The Missionites failed to show
much in the last game. Their fielding
was ragged and although found
little trouble in connecting with Loew
enstein's delivery their ten hits ac
counted for but one tally.
The Cardinal nine seems to be
striking its stride. In the game with
St. Mary's Saturday, Wolter's team
led most of the way and played con
sistent ball. Madigan's team finally
came out on the long end of a 4-2
score.
Next Saturday, St. Mary's is slated
to invade the campus for the third
game with the Cards. In spite of the
fact that the Saints have won two
games, Saturday's tussle should be the
best of the series.
Wolter's team will have three tough
games during the spring vacation. The
Trojan nine from the University of
Southern California is coming north
for two games and the Olympic Club
will furnish opposition for a third.
The game tomorrow afternoon be
gins at 3 o'clock.
