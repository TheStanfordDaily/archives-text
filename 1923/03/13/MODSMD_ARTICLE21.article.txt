# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE BEGINS ON FARM APRIL 3
## Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill To Take Charge of Squad; Many Veterans to Report 
### 
After a three months' rest, the Stan
ford gridders will dig out their mole
skins again when spring football prac
tice begins on the Farm April 3.
"Pop" Warner, "Tiny" Thornhill, and
Andy Kerr will be on hand to put as
pirants through their paces. Warner Is
making the trip from the East to take
charge, and will probably arrive here
April 1. Thornhill has been spending
the winter in Los Angeles. Kerr has
finished his work with the basketball
squad and will probably help Warner
with the backfleld material.
The Card mentorß will have a line
weakened only by the loss of one vet
eran to work with. DeGroot, captain
and center of the 1922 varsity, will be
the only linesman missing. George
Baker and Bob Hunt will probably
fight it out for the vacant place. Baker
was the find of the past season, step
ping into the Washington game with
practically no experience and conduct
ing himself like a veteran. Hunt is a
20.0 pounder from the 1926 squad and
with a little experience should develop
into a good center.
At the guard jobs, Cravens and Fa
ville will be back and around this
pair, the Cardinal coaches will prob
ably build their defense. Sholes from
the freshman squad and Loomis will
also make a fight for the guard jobs.
Harry Shipkey and Bill Neill from
the varsity and "Red" Potts from the
freshman squad will probably be the
strongest contenders for the tackle
positions. Should Johnston return to
college, he will be one of the strongest
contenders. Shipkey and Johnston
were the regulars last year with Neill
to help out. All these men are sopho
mores and have plenty of time ahead
of them.
There will be a wealth of material
for the end positions. Mertz, Dole, Jim
Lawson, Janssen, and Thomas from
the varsity and McDermont and Nev
ers from the 1926 team will be on
hand.
With the loss of Art Wilcox, and
Cuddeback who has not returned to
school, the Card backfield will un
doubtedly prove the hardest problem
for the coaching staff to solve. Fred
Solomon seems the logical man to take
Cuddeback's place but just who will
fill the shoes of Wilcox is hard to say.
Cleaveland and Guy Dennis will make
strong bids for his place.
Rae Doughty will not be on hand for
spring practice but may return in the
fall quarter. Warner will have four
quarterbacks to work with Woodward
and Wheat from the varsity and Mitch
ell and Kirwan from the freshmen .
Just where Captain-elect "Scotch"
Campbell will fit in is hard to de
termine. Campbell can play quarter,
half, or full, and he will probably be
worked overtime.
Coach Warner is anxious to have a
large squad turn out for spring prac
tice April 3. Experience is not neces
sary as there are several places on the
team where new men are needed.

quarterbacks to work with Woodward
and Wheat from the varsity and Mitch
ell and Kirwan from the freshmen .
Just where Captain-elect "Scotch"
Campbell will fit in is hard to de
termine. Campbell can play quarter,
half, or full, and he will probably be
worked overtime.
Coach Warner is anxious to have a
large squad turn out for spring prac
tice April 3. Experience is not neces
sary as there are several places on the
team where new men are needed.
After a three months' rest, the Stan
ford gridders will dig out their mole
skins again when spring football prac
tice begins on the Farm April 3.
"Pop" Warner, "Tiny" Thornhill, and
Andy Kerr will be on hand to put as
pirants through their paces. Warner Is
making the trip from the East to take
charge, and will probably arrive here
April 1. Thornhill has been spending
the winter in Los Angeles. Kerr has
finished his work with the basketball
squad and will probably help Warner
with the backfleld material.
The Card mentorß will have a line
weakened only by the loss of one vet
eran to work with. DeGroot, captain
and center of the 1922 varsity, will be
the only linesman missing. George
Baker and Bob Hunt will probably
fight it out for the vacant place. Baker
was the find of the past season, step
ping into the Washington game with
practically no experience and conduct
ing himself like a veteran. Hunt is a
20.0 pounder from the 1926 squad and
with a little experience should develop
into a good center.
At the guard jobs, Cravens and Fa
ville will be back and around this
pair, the Cardinal coaches will prob
ably build their defense. Sholes from
the freshman squad and Loomis will
also make a fight for the guard jobs.
Harry Shipkey and Bill Neill from
the varsity and "Red" Potts from the
freshman squad will probably be the
strongest contenders for the tackle
positions. Should Johnston return to
college, he will be one of the strongest
contenders. Shipkey and Johnston
were the regulars last year with Neill
to help out. All these men are sopho
mores and have plenty of time ahead
of them.
There will be a wealth of material
for the end positions. Mertz, Dole, Jim
Lawson, Janssen, and Thomas from
the varsity and McDermont and Nev
ers from the 1926 team will be on
hand.
With the loss of Art Wilcox, and
Cuddeback who has not returned to
school, the Card backfield will un
doubtedly prove the hardest problem
for the coaching staff to solve. Fred
Solomon seems the logical man to take
Cuddeback's place but just who will
fill the shoes of Wilcox is hard to say.
Cleaveland and Guy Dennis will make
strong bids for his place.
Rae Doughty will not be on hand for
spring practice but may return in the
fall quarter. Warner will have four
quarterbacks to work with Woodward
and Wheat from the varsity and Mitch
ell and Kirwan from the freshmen .
Just where Captain-elect "Scotch"
Campbell will fit in is hard to de
termine. Campbell can play quarter,
half, or full, and he will probably be
