# TICKETS ON SALE FOR CAMPUS GLEE CLUB APPEARANCE
## 
### 
Tickets for the animal campus concert
by the Stanford Glee Club, to be given
Friday night in the Assembly hall, will
be on sale at the Bookstore and at Cran
dall's the rest of the week.
The program will not be as formal as
the one planned for the contest in Los
Angeles, but will include many popular
songs. The "Drinking Song" and "Tally-
Ho" from the Ram's Head Show will be
repeated. The forty singers will also
give "O Mariners, Out of the Sunlight,"
which is considered the most powerful
song the club has sung for several years.
