# IN FAIRNESS TO THE BOXERS
## 
### 
Stanford has been the subject of both condemna
tion and praise for its action in canceling the boxing
bouts with California last week. The Daily Ca'li
fomian, in commenting on the incident editorially,
referred to Stanford's.action as "unfortunate," "re
grettable," and representing a "perverted idea of
sportsmanship."
There are at least two considerations which play
a strong part in the matter. The first is just how
binding an agreement between universities may be
considered. Last year the Berkeley graduate man
ager wrote to Stanford apologizing for entering a
negro in one of the bouts after an agreement elimi
nating colored boxers had been made. It was ex
plained as a "mistake," due to the sudden illness of
une of the members of the team. It may be true that
the arrangement was made only for that year, but
the very fact that California apologized for breaking
its' Word would indicate that there had been some
basis for the elimination of negroes. That basis has
seemingly been forgotten and California now rises
in indignation and. proclaims sonorously that the
"state university does not discriminate either for or
against men of another race or color."
Which brings us to the other consideration—that
of discrimination. Boxing is a dangerous sport for
collegiate competition. It has become connected in
its history outside of colleges with the roughest ele
ment, and for that reason must be guarded closely in
•order to maintain the standard of other sports. Last
year's experience proved that participation of colored
men does not help any in keeping the sport on that
level. The existence of race prejudice cannot be de
nied, and whether or not it is justified, promoting
bouts between men of different color can do nothing
but antagonize that feeling. There is not the close
contact in other branches of athletics and the per
sonal element does not enter so strongly.
California has recommended the forfeiture by
Stanford of those bouts in which negroes are en
tered rather than the cancellation of the entire com
petition. Naturally, Cardinal boxers would resent
any such action. They would feel that California
■was entering negroes merely to win the meet un
fairly and they would be denied the opportunity of
meeting men of their own class.
There is also a purely local angle to the question
which ought to find .s'ome satisfactory solution. Men
Avho have been training and boxing all season will
denied the opportunity of securing their letters
unless some special dispensation is made. Since it is
through no fault of their own that the matches were
called off, it would seem only fair that the U. S. C.
meet, which is the next on the schedule and which
promises to be a genuine test of fistic ability, be sub
stituted as a basis for granting letters.

basis for the elimination of negroes. That basis has
seemingly been forgotten and California now rises
in indignation and. proclaims sonorously that the
"state university does not discriminate either for or
against men of another race or color."
Which brings us to the other consideration—that
of discrimination. Boxing is a dangerous sport for
collegiate competition. It has become connected in
its history outside of colleges with the roughest ele
ment, and for that reason must be guarded closely in
•order to maintain the standard of other sports. Last
year's experience proved that participation of colored
men does not help any in keeping the sport on that
level. The existence of race prejudice cannot be de
nied, and whether or not it is justified, promoting
bouts between men of different color can do nothing
but antagonize that feeling. There is not the close
contact in other branches of athletics and the per
sonal element does not enter so strongly.
California has recommended the forfeiture by
Stanford of those bouts in which negroes are en
tered rather than the cancellation of the entire com
petition. Naturally, Cardinal boxers would resent
any such action. They would feel that California
■was entering negroes merely to win the meet un
fairly and they would be denied the opportunity of
meeting men of their own class.
There is also a purely local angle to the question
which ought to find .s'ome satisfactory solution. Men
Avho have been training and boxing all season will
denied the opportunity of securing their letters
unless some special dispensation is made. Since it is
through no fault of their own that the matches were
called off, it would seem only fair that the U. S. C.
meet, which is the next on the schedule and which
promises to be a genuine test of fistic ability, be sub
stituted as a basis for granting letters.
Stanford has been the subject of both condemna
tion and praise for its action in canceling the boxing
bouts with California last week. The Daily Ca'li
fomian, in commenting on the incident editorially,
referred to Stanford's.action as "unfortunate," "re
grettable," and representing a "perverted idea of
sportsmanship."
There are at least two considerations which play
a strong part in the matter. The first is just how
binding an agreement between universities may be
considered. Last year the Berkeley graduate man
ager wrote to Stanford apologizing for entering a
negro in one of the bouts after an agreement elimi
nating colored boxers had been made. It was ex
plained as a "mistake," due to the sudden illness of
une of the members of the team. It may be true that
the arrangement was made only for that year, but
the very fact that California apologized for breaking
its' Word would indicate that there had been some
basis for the elimination of negroes. That basis has
seemingly been forgotten and California now rises
in indignation and. proclaims sonorously that the
"state university does not discriminate either for or
against men of another race or color."
