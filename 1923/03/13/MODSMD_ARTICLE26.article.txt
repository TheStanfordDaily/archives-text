SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE opens April
Until Coach Glenn Warner conies to Stanford to
assume actual control of football, the spring practice
provides the only opportunity that members of the
squad have to learn the system directly from him.
A large turnout will prove helpful to both coaches
and players, and will furnish a strong foundation for
building up a team in the fall. It has been shown
that it is going to take work to bring Stanford back
to its former level of equality with California on the
gridiron, and that work will have to continue
throughout the year. Jt cannot be done by the
coaches alone.
