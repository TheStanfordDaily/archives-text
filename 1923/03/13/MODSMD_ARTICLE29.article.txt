# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
After having rested one day on the hoe, the regular
Cabbage gardeners now assume their delightful duties
of cutting the AGE out of CABBAGE. Having been as
sured by all our well-wishing friends that the Friday
batch was worth throwing a man out of college on, we
sit down with much cheer to write the next to the last
real CABBAGES this quarter. We still have the ex
papers to fill, though.

It's gotten so these days you gotta have all kinds of
licenses to do anything on. Why, you almost gotta have
two licenses to marry on. Yep, marriage and automobile.

"Let's see," he murmured, "which side of the house do
you resemble most?"
"Sir," she answered mildly, tromping on him in rage,
"I don't resemble the side of any house."

A CO-ED'S DIARY
Sunday, March 11
Danced at Roble last night. I didn't want to show
partiality to any campus man yet so I asked Howard C.
to come down from the city. He has a darling new
Marmon roadster, and we took a ride before the dance.
I saw the most fascinating man among the roughs at the
dance. I could hardly keep away from the windows I
was so interested in him. I must find out who he is
and get him to meet me some way.
I am a perfect wreck today after such a week-end, and
I haven't even seen a book for a week. When I tell the
boys I am flunking out they say that ever so many clever
girls have flunked out of here because they were too
successful to study.

Monday, March 12
Who says it's hell to be a Freshman? The men are
much more interested in us than in the older girls. By
the time a girl has been here a year they have her all
catalogued and labeled and ready to put away on the
shelf, but the first two or three quarters can be one
thrill after another if one knows one's stuff. Believe
me, I am going to lead them all a merry chase if I don't
flunk out this quarter.
Spent another heavenly night on the lake with Mac.
He handles a canoe well.

New (at club meeting): I nominate Tom Joke for

The night was yet young—the sound of drums a long
distance away called them —they followed the beaten
paths to the meeting place—their eyes were glowing in
the darkness —dim forms were outlined against the light
of the moon —there was a rythmical swaying of the
massed forms —No. It's not the elephant dance in the
jungle to which Kala Nag took Little Toomai some
time ago—merely Stanford roughs at a campus dance.
