# AUTOMOBILE USED BY CLASS AND GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
Several classes and organizations at
Stanford have found the automobile a
more convenient and economical
means of transportation. Two of these
are the class in crime, taught by Miss
Lothrop, and the Glee Club.
In their trips to the various prisons
and asylums which they visit in the
course of the class, including San
! Jose, San Francisco, San Quentin, and
Agnew, nearly all the students have
motored.
When the Glee Club goes south to
Los Angeles this spring vacation, they
will go by automobile. The successful
| trip through the Sacramento valley
! last year was also made by auto.
