# CHAPPIE STILL OPEN TO CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMBINATION NUMBER
## 
### 
The Old Boy leaned out of the win
dow over the Daily office long enough
today to remark to the Anxious Re
porter that he was still waiting with open
arms for copy, for the combination issue
with Pelican of the transbay college.
hor those who do not know what
"copy" means, the Anxious Reporter
stated that it means jokes, riddles, draw
ings with or without hunches, puns, puz
zles, and stories with a humorous twist.
Pretty large field, the Old One claims,
and he wishes it well covered by local
Cobbs and Irwins before Saturday. Con
tributions will reach the editorial eye if
addressed to Box 15.
