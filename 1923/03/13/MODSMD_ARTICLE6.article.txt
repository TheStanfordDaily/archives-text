# BABE TRACK TEAM WILL OPEN SEASON SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Freshman track season will open
next Saturday morning at 10 o'clock
when the Babe track team meets Mo
desto and Berkeley high schools in a
dual meet on the varßity track field.
Modesto has a reputation of turning
out winning cinder path teams and al
though nothing definite is known as to
the strength of the high school this
early in the season, it is not likely
that this year will be an exception.
Berkeley high school has always had
one of the strongest prep track teams
in the San Francisco bay region. For
the last six years Berkeley has turned
out a championship squad which has
been a strong contender for State In
terscholastic honors.
The yearlingß seem to carry all the
dope on their side, however. The
freshman team this year is one of the
best balanced beams since the en
trance of the '23 track athletes three
years ago. Although a trifle weak in
the weight events the babes are
stronger in these than the high school
stars.
Perhaps most of the freshmen
squads' strength is in the 440-yard
dash, the 880, mile and two-mile. First
place in these events seems almost, in
evitable.
