# PROFESSOR WEST DECRIES WORK OF CONGRESS SESSION
## Faulty Organization Causes Failure in Last Session of Congress, Says West 
### 
"Congress, although it failed to dis
pose of the most important matters in
its program, accomplished more during
the last session than is generally be
lieved. It attempted to fulfill its prom
ises, and its partial failure was due to
faulty organization in the House and
poor rules of procedure in the Senate,
together with a failure to develop the
theory of Presidential leadership."
Thus Professor Victor J. West, head
of the Political Science department at
the University, summed up the work of
the sixty-seventh Congress in his address
on that subject given last evening in the
Stanford Little Theater.
Professor West analyzed the work of
the Congress by a comparison of the
actual accomplishments of the body as
compared with platform and campaign
promises. He recounted the party
pledges given in the Republican platform
in 1920, including the promises of
greater efficiency and economy govern
ment, a revision of taxation, the devel
opment of commerce, particularly
through the merchant marine, resump
tion of trade with foreign lands, the set
tlement of labor questions, and so on.
Analyzing the measures attempted by
Congress in fulfilling these promises, the
speaker said: "Congress made a sincere
attempt to make good the party pledges.
It succeeded only in part, failing in the
most important measures." These in
cluded a merchant marine, the failure
of the ship subsidy, a failure to secure
efficient labor legislation, and only a
partial success in other matters.
The "farm block" was blamed by Pro
fessor West as one of the chief causes of
th failure of the Republicans to accom
plish all they had planned. "The pres
ence of this bloc endangered the Repub-
lican majority, and made for a lack ofl
unity in the party. Another cause of
failure was poor organization, resulting
in an absence of responsible leaders.
The House was poorly organized for
efficient control.'' The speaker explained
the methods of organization used, in
cluding the "Committee on Committees,"
the "steering committee," denied by the
Republicans, but which undoubtedly ex
isted, according to Professor West; and
the floor leaders.
In the upper house the trouble lay in
the rules of procedure, Professor West
stated. These rules, so faulty that they
permitted of the endless filibusters which
caused the failure of several important
measures, were second only to the "farm
bloc" in impeding party action.
Another important obstacle was the
lack of presidential leadership, the
speaker said. "As things stand, nothing
can be dune without some means of con
trol. President Harding adopted the
principle of non-interference, but he was
forced to abandon this policy several
times. The theory of presidential lead
ership must be developed for efficient
action."
