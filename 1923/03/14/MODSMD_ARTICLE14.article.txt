# INTERCLASS BALL TITLE TO BE CLINCHED MONDAY
## 
### 
The winner of the sophomore-junior
game tomorrow will play the seniors
for the championship of the interclass
baseball league Monday, according to
C. W. Davis, director of interclass and
intramural athletics.
Monday afternoon, in upsetting the
dope and defeating the hitherto un-
I beaten seniors, the freshmen, although
I themselves eliminated by losses to
1 sophomore and junior teams, tied the
j league between the seniors and the
! winner of th<e game tomorrow.
Comparative scores would show that

the final game Monday will be between
1925 and 1923, for although the sopho
mores were beaten worse than the
juniors by the seniors, none of their
men on the varsity squad were play
ing, and these are eligible, and will
play Thursday if permitted to do so
by Coach Wolter. Percentages in the
league to date are as follows:
Won Lost Pet.
Seniors 2 1 .666
Juniors 1 1 .500
Sophomores 1 1 ,500
Freshmen ,1 1 .333
