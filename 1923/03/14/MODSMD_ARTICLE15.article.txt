# BENIINCK PRAISES CAST'S ABILITY IN SHAKESPEARE PLAY
## English Club Play in Final Rehearsals ; To Be Given First Week of Spring Quarter 
### 
With two weeks of rehearsing and a
cast including as its principals Richard
Bentinck, Helen Whitney, A. D. Cohan,
Miriam Hilton, Mrs. L. B. Wallis and
Matthew Tobriner for a foundation.
"Will Shakespeare," Clemence Dane's
four-act drama, is entering on its final
stage of development prior to its pres
entation on April 6, the Friday follow
ing registration.
With a cast of such talent "Will
Shakespeare" should be, with two more
weeks of rehearsing by the principals, a»
offering of finished dramatic interpre
tation. Dane's drama, though it has been
declared to be unusual, even bizarre, is
a piece which lacks stage effcct novelty
and claptrap. It is a play which re
quires tine emotional acting, and Direc
tor Bentinck believes that he has secured
a cast of unusual talent.
A. D. Cohan, who played the title role
in Masquers' "He Who Got Slapped"
will appear as Hcnslowe. the great actor,
favorite of Elizabeth, and true friend
of Shakespeare. Harold Davis, who was
cast as Henslowe. was forced to drop
the part on account of the stress of
other work.
Helen Whitney, Mary Fitton, Shake
speare's "lady of the sonnets," has bee»
ill and unable to attend the recent re
hearsals. Miss Whitney, who had been
doing very promising work as the witty,
clever, court-lover in the rehearsals last
week, will probably be able to resume
rehearsing during the vacation.
Miriam Hilton, who has had a variety
jof dramatic training, although she has
not appeared before on the campus stage,
plays opposite Bentinck as Anne, Will
Shakespeare's wife. Anne is an emo
tional, too-faithful woman, one of tliw
truest characterizations of the drama.
Bentinck believes that Miss Hilton, who
has shown an intelligent understanding
of the part in rehearsals, will be able to
give a vivid interpretation of the deli
| cate Anne. •> .
Mrs. L. 15. Wallis,. who will play
I Elizabeth, said by critics to be the finest
characterization that has been written
| of the distinguished queen, is the most
experienced member of the cast with the
exception of Bentinck. Miss Wallis has
been "seasoned". in professional
! work and has also studied dramatic art
in Boston. Mrs. Wallis has not only
shown ability as the queen, but 'has, at
times, stepped into all the important
roles, showing remarkable versatility.
Kit Marlowe, Shakespeare's rival and
friend, is played by Matthew Tobriner.
The common love of the two men for
Mary Fitton is the basis for some of the
most dramatic scenes of the play. To
briner, according to Bentinck, is abl<-
to throw himself into the role with cred
itable success.
Much of tlie success of the English
Club presentation depends upon Kichard
Bentinck. who as director and as "Will
Shakespeare, the name tfole, has the
largest share of responsibility. Bentinck'*
experience in dramatic work will makt
it possible for him to present a char
acter interpretation which would be ex
ceedingly difficult for the college ama
teur.
The last rehearsal of the entire cast
before vacation will lie held Thursday
night. During the vacation the princi
pals will rehearse continually. On April
2 rehearsals of the entire cast will re
commence.
