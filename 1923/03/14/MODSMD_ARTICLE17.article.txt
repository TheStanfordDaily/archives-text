# WHY A SYSTEM?

"[ don't know whether 1 had better leave you.
•Perhaps yon can't be trusted," with that remark
one of the professors left his class with an exami
nation the other day. A few minutes later he came
back and apologized for his words, assuring the
students that lie trusted them.
Each year about this time exhortation to remem
ber the honor system is issued. Students are also
reminded that it is part of their duty to detect any
of their fellows who are violating the "system." If
you feel that way about it, all right, but no recom
mendations to that effect will be made through
these columns.
There will be some cheating during finals this
quarter. There always is—and any beautifully
worded pleas will have no effect upon the sort of
person who offends in that manner. There are those
of us who appreciate the recognition of our intelli
gence and independence signified by the absence of
the instructor during the examination. We should
not be greatly upset if there are those who prefer to
rely upon other means in order to remain in college.
"Honor" will not be developed in a group of in
dividuals by any "system." The more rules we draw
up to be observed in the practice of taking exami
nations the quicker we defeat the very purpose of
the method.
The presence of a mentor in the room antagonizes
those who feel that they are being watched. Let
that be the reason for independent work. Those
who intend to cheat would do so anyway —so why
hamper ourselves with a "system?" Let each of us
do his work in his own way and if there are those
whose conscience compels them to act as policemen
—well, that is their business.
