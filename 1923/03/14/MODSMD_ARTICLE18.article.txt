Something- for everybody seems to have been the
motto of the Glee Club in preparing its program for
the first Stanford appearance of the year in the
Assembly hall Friday night. It is curious that when
ever the club leaves the campus for a tour it is
greeted enthusiastically at every concert. Yet when
it appears at home the greater part of the audience
lis usually composed of Palo Altans. In our home
towns we should probably consider such an event a
rare treat, but at Stanford it is taken as a matter of
fact. Support of a genuinely worthy student enter
prise may be advanced as a reason for attending the
concert Friday night, but the more effective argu
ment is the prospect of an evening of enjoyable en
tertainment.
