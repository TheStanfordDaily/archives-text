"THE ONLY SOLUTION to this artificial situ
ation is the contact in school and college between
the races," said Dr. W. E. B. Dußois yesterday aft

the introduction of the negro question into inter
collegiate contests, is of particular interest. It is
quite likely that Dr. Dußois does not favor physical
contact as a means of bringing about this "solution."
