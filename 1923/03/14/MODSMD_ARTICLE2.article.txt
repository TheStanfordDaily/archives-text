# GLEE CLUB TO SING FRIDAY NIGHT IN AUDITORIUM HERE
## 
### 
"Stanford's Glee Club is appearing
Friday night in the Assembly Hall,"
said Arnold Bayley, who is assisting
Director Allen in the presentation,
"not as a formal group of forty singers
who will go through their tricks for
the admission price, but as a body of
human beings who are trying to inter
est the campus in a varied, new, and
lively program.
"The entire program has been
chosen to please and hold the campus
audience. Lighting effects have been
secured to add to the novelty of the
evening, and several clever songs and
imitations appear on the program. 'O
Mariners Out of the Sunlight' is one
of the most effective songs being sung
today; while the other side of the pro
gram is represented by 'Bill's Bill
board* and others."
