WIRE BRIEFS
(By our Leased wire. The Least said about it, the better)
Lasitude, La—Al Edkins, who was taken seriously ill
while making a Fourth of July speech, is recovering, al
though Dr. Brown is still attending him.
• * •
Collapsible, Va.—The Rev. Theodore Sill preached a
sermon on the old text, "As a man thinketh in his heart,
so is he, unless his wife change his mind."
* * *
HOW DO YOU SAY IT?
From sunny France the message came,
"Your ill will all go fiooey,
If you will all repeat some lines,
"Invented by one Coue."
Next day I met old gouty Joe,
I said, "How do you do?"
He answered, "Gosh, I'm bully,
Since I heard of Dr. Coue."
Like measles and the flu it spread,
Consumptive Jim barked, "Wow!
I'm getting better rapidly, .
Much thanks to this man Cow."
A lady with dyspepsia
Evoked a faint "Hooray!
My system is improving,
Under this man Coue."
Then Hippo Bill (who should be dead.
From Bright's disease) boomed "Zowle!
You gotta give him credit, kid!
I mean this geezer, Cowie!"
So' day by day, in every way,
They differ as can be;
The last one told ine that the name,
Should be pronounced "Coo-e-e."
His formula may be all right,
But one who is a verser,
Knows that this fellow Coue's name,
Each day grows worser and worser.
—The Bughouse Bugle.
