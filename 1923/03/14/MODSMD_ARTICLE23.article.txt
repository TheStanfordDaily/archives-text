OFF HOURS
Even the most heavily burdened student has off hours.
It forms an interesting study to look into the various
means by which the undergraduate succeeds in disposing
of the time which he finds free to apply to his own
purposes. One is a regular attendant at all the local
theatres another consistently fritters away his leisure
moments in less edifying pursuits; a third perhaps is
alive to the importance of keeping fit, and indulges
methodically in the exercise which produces the con
comitant of a healthy mind; there is also the phenome
non of the unfathomable one who wends his way reli
giously to the library with a studious look and a feeling
of self-satisfaction. In short, each student has his own
particular way of "killing time," as it were. Two general
classes, however, present themselves at once to the
observer: Those who spend their spare time profitably
and those who do not.
In days when there was more leisure in the world, men
found time to do many things which present-day life
makes impossible. Today it is a matter of getting the
most out of very limited time; and the earlier in life
that this art —for art it is—is learned, the greater will
its value later prove. The day is almost too short for
modern conditions; and with so many hours necessarily
devoted to sleeping and eating and providing means for
sustenance, there is a plethora of opportunities to do a
great deal beyond keeping body and soul together. It
becomes, therefore, exceedingly advisable to put what
ever spare time there is to use, with careful and prudent
discrimination, so that prodigality be reduced to a mini
mum. Time is too valuable a commodity in the average
man's life that it be dissipated without thought or spent
without profitable return.
Comparatively speaking, university men have a great
deal of non-working hours. College life affords an ad
mirable training ground for developing this faculty of
putting spare time to good use. And in fact it is one of
the distinguishing marks of the truly educated man that
he knows how to utilize to the greatest advantage the
idle moments which he finds at his disposal. To allow
these golden opportunities of doing something worth
while to slip through one's fingers is to insure everlast
ing regrets. To develop the habit of idling spare time
away in aimless diversions at college is to leave a mark
on the man which throughout his life he will value only
as an incentive —advise the undergraduate not to do
likewise. Seizing upon off-hours, however, and turning
them to account for purposes of profit and improvement
forms a habit which will prove more invaluable as time
goes on.
The intelligent student with an eye to the future
makes no uncertain choice as to the direction in which
he applies his odd moments. —(The McGill Daily.)

non of the unfathomable one who wends his way reli
giously to the library with a studious look and a feeling
of self-satisfaction. In short, each student has his own
particular way of "killing time," as it were. Two general
classes, however, present themselves at once to the
observer: Those who spend their spare time profitably
and those who do not.
In days when there was more leisure in the world, men
found time to do many things which present-day life
makes impossible. Today it is a matter of getting the
most out of very limited time; and the earlier in life
that this art —for art it is—is learned, the greater will
its value later prove. The day is almost too short for
modern conditions; and with so many hours necessarily
devoted to sleeping and eating and providing means for
sustenance, there is a plethora of opportunities to do a
great deal beyond keeping body and soul together. It
becomes, therefore, exceedingly advisable to put what
ever spare time there is to use, with careful and prudent
discrimination, so that prodigality be reduced to a mini
mum. Time is too valuable a commodity in the average
man's life that it be dissipated without thought or spent
without profitable return.
Comparatively speaking, university men have a great
deal of non-working hours. College life affords an ad
mirable training ground for developing this faculty of
putting spare time to good use. And in fact it is one of
the distinguishing marks of the truly educated man that
he knows how to utilize to the greatest advantage the
idle moments which he finds at his disposal. To allow
these golden opportunities of doing something worth
while to slip through one's fingers is to insure everlast
ing regrets. To develop the habit of idling spare time
away in aimless diversions at college is to leave a mark
on the man which throughout his life he will value only
as an incentive —advise the undergraduate not to do
likewise. Seizing upon off-hours, however, and turning
them to account for purposes of profit and improvement
forms a habit which will prove more invaluable as time
goes on.
The intelligent student with an eye to the future
makes no uncertain choice as to the direction in which
he applies his odd moments. —(The McGill Daily.)
OFF HOURS
Even the most heavily burdened student has off hours.
It forms an interesting study to look into the various
means by which the undergraduate succeeds in disposing
of the time which he finds free to apply to his own
purposes. One is a regular attendant at all the local
theatres another consistently fritters away his leisure
moments in less edifying pursuits; a third perhaps is
alive to the importance of keeping fit, and indulges
methodically in the exercise which produces the con
comitant of a healthy mind; there is also the phenome
non of the unfathomable one who wends his way reli
giously to the library with a studious look and a feeling
of self-satisfaction. In short, each student has his own
