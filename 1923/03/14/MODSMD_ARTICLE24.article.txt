The following communication has
been submitted for publication by Men's
Council, with the conviction that no fur
ther action than calling the matter to i
the students' attention will be necessary:'
Men's Council,
Stanford University.
Gentlemen: I
I am sorry to report that numerous
complaints recently have been made
to this office concerning the fact that
students apparently have established
the custom of decorating their houses,
in part at least, with flowers and
shrubs which have been purloined
from gardens on the campus.
To unthinking students the stealing
of shrubs and flowers may seem a
trifling matter, but to members of the j
faculty who have spent years in de
veloping their gardens, thereby greatly
improving the appearance of the cam
pus, It is a serious and very discourag
ing matter.
One member of the faculty, whose
garden has been greatly admired by
visitors to the campus, reports that
during the last week-end heather bush
es have been so badly broken that they
will not recover for five or six years,
and over fifty daffodils have been car
ried away in one night. Last year, in
one night, practically all of the tulips
grown by an aged couple on the cam
pus were stolen and the plants injured.
I am putting the matter before your
j Council with the hope that you will be
able to create a sentiment among the
students which will eliminate this
troublesome practice .1 believe that if
the matter were called to the attention
of the seniors in the various fraternity,
sorority, and club houses, that much
might be accomplished in this way.
Thanking you for your cooperation
! in the matter,
Very truly yours,
A. E. ROTH,
Comptroller.
