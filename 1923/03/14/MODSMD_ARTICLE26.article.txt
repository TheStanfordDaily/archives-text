There ought to be some sort of point
system limiting the activities of a vaude
ville performer. Men like Fred Stone,'
who is appearing in "Tip Top" at the
Columbia this week, can do more harm
than good to their profession. It makes
us expect too much of ordinary men—j
when we see one who can combine every
circus stunt we've ever seen—almost —
and get away with all of them —almost.
Stone bursts" through the floor spec
tacularly for his first entrance and from
that time on does not take another breath.
When he's not on the stage, he's in the
wings changing to another of his freak !
costumes.
Once in a while the plot of "Tip Top"!
furnishes reason for the members
of the large cast to act as they do, but
the producers are more interested in
keeping things going than they are in
consistency. The performance is a treat
to the eye and the ear and an insult to 1
the intelligence.
