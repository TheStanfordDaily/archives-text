# VARSITY SQUAD TO MEET OLYMPICS; FRESHMEN RUN WITH BRUINS SATURDAY
## Freshmen Favored to Win From Visitors; Prospect in Field Not So Certain 
### 
Stanford's freshman track athletes
are favored to defeat Berkeley and Mo
desto high schools in their first meet
of the Beason to be held on the varsity
oval next Saturday morning at 10
o'clock.
Five places seem to be almost cer
tain firsts, while second and third
place men are plentiful.
Kill Richardson is one of the beßt
880-yard men in college, and can be
depended to run the half mile in the
neighborhood of 2 minutes flat in al
most any meet.
With Miller and Louis Gasper in the
sprints it looks as if the freshmen
should take first and second in the
century and 220. Miller and Gasper
are both capable of 10:21 and 23 sec
onds respectively in these events.
Harold Boles has been covering the
120 yard distance in the high hurdles
in 15:3 and the low sticks in 24:2. He
has run second to Lane Falk in prac
tically every practice meet, and in
some instances has broken the tape
ahead of the varsity hurdler.
Although Bill Kerr has not recov
ered completely from a recent flu spell,
he can no doubt travel the mile in
fast enough time to add five points to
the yearling score, as most high school
runners are not capable of more than
4:50 for the four laps.
A summary of the weights inakeß
the freshman prospects look gloomy
for the field events.
Thompson is high jumping around 5
feet 10 inches, and managed to place
third in this event in the interclass
meet held last Saturday. E. C. Scofield
and E. W. Lloyd are consistent in the
pole vault and should easily top their
prep opponents at 11 feet 6 inches or
over, for first and second places.
The shot-put, the discus, and javelin
are in the dark horse class. Johnny
Boone has been heaving the lead for
the babes and he seems to be the most
capable weight performer on the '26
squad up to date.
Adding possible first places gives
Stanford 30 points which are almost
certainties, and leaves the field events
open to more doubtful competition. j
During the spring vacation the babe |
track stars will compete against all of,
the Oakland high schools, on March i
24, and against a combination of the
Peninsula schools March 31. The!
meets will be run in the afternoon.
