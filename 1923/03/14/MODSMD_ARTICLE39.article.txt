Hugh Giddings, wrestling manager
of the California Aggies, has invited
Vaughn Hosepian and Roy Woodhead,
Stanford wrestlers, to take part in
uome exhibition matches at Davis on
April 28. Hosepian and Woodhead are
seriously considering the invitation
and it is possible that they will make
the trip.
In the event they wrestle at Davis
Hosepian is to meet W. Giddings, who
defeated Sievers in the 145-pound class
in the recent meet. Hosepian is a
lightweight, but feels that he will be
able to handle the farmer, although he
outweighs Hosepian fifteen pounds.
Woodhead is to meet Hugh Giddings,
who won a decision over the Stanford
wrestler here two weeks ago.
