# Olympics Strong in Track Events Especially Over the Shorter Distance Races
## 
### 
Stanford's squad of track athletes will
meet the Olympic Club Saturday at 3
o'clock on the Stanford oval in the first
outside meet of the present season.
The club team, which will arrive here
Saturday noon, is particularly strong
in the track events and should make point
for point with the varsity in the sprints
and shorter distances. The mile and
two-mile runs should go to the varsity
runners with the possibility of another
place or two being credited to them.
Lane Falk is now in good condition
and should outdistance any hurdlers the
Olympic Club can put up.
In the pole vault, the Olympic Club
is unusually weak and will be lucky to
get a single place, with Black, Dennis,
and Scofield making good heights.
In the high jump, shot put, and discus,
the Olympic Club can enter men who
should cop several places, allowing two
or three second choices to Stanford.
But in the javelin Parish and Harlow
should both make creditable showings
which will insure them of places. Wright
will have to make a good leap to win
the broad jump and will probably have
to be content with a second or third.
With the aid of a decided advantage
in the long distances and in some of the
field events, the Stanford varsity should
in the first dual meet of the season by
a comfortable margin. However, if the
Olympic Club enters Sudden or an)'
other fast sprinters, the score will more
than likely be much closer.
After the meet Saturday, twenty-five
men will be selected from about thirty
possibilities to meet U. S. C. in the dual
track meet scheduled for March 24. The
team with the coach, trainer, and man
ager will leave here next Friday and ar
rive in Los Angeles in time for the meet
on the following day.
Following the U. S. C. meet in Los
Angeles, the track squad will start train
ing in earnest for the return meet with
the Southern university here April 3.
The men will work out every day dur
ing vacation, spending about an hour
on the track and two or 'brcc more hours
in some other sport.
The meet at Los Angeles will be held
on the University's track field and will
start promptly at 2:30 p. m.
