# Spring Weather Lures Faculty Golf Bugs to Greenery of Polo Field
## 
### 
The Polo field will soon be turned into
a golf course if a few more of the Stan
ford faculty devote themselves to chas
ing the little white pellet. Passing stu
dents have exclaimed in wonder at the
remarkable "follow-through" of "Dink"
Templeton, track coach, and others have
commented upon the undoubted ability
of Charles W. Davis, director of intra
mural sports, in approaching the green.
Coach "Andy" Kerr also swings a
mean golf club, but his "course" is in the
vicinity of the old gymnasium, where he
is often to be seen practicing with mashie
and putter. Eyewitnesses declare that
he shows remarkable skill with these
clubs and those "in on the know" hint
that he is training for a three-cornered
match with "Dink" Templeton and Coach
Davis. Coupled with these reports
comes the rumor that a petition, signed
by several faculty members and campus
lights, is about to be presented to the
University authorities, urging the imme
diate laying out of a suitable golf course.
