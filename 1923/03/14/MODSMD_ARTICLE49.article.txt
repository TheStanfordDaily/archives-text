A secret that detectives failed to
fathom came out at the annual Found
ers' Day dinner Saturday night,
through Charles Field, '95, toastmaster.
"Dr. Jordan was much interested in a
cache of liquor that some of the fel
lows were supposed to have hidden,"
Field said. "But he could never find it.
I promised to tell him sometime and I
will tonight. On what is now the fifth
floor of Encina hall but which used to
be an uninhabited attic, there was a
little space in the wall. In that apace
were numerous bottles. The fellows
would carry empty bottles there and
return with full ones. That is why
there were never any empty bottles
around the campus.

A memorial plate in honor of the
late R .E. Pellissier, professor in the
Romanic Languages department, who
was killed at hte Somme the year be
fore, has been placed in the Memorial
Court at the left of the entrance.

Athree-story apartment house lo
cated on the new road being built from
the Postoffice to Lagunita, will soon
be constructed. Plans include twenty
six apartments, with outdoor sleeping
accommodations for sixteen. One of
the best features will be a large living
room downstairs to serve as a social
center for the people i nthe hous-e.

Pine Cottage, the historic relic of the
old days of the Stanford ranch, has
been removed to make way for the
new Library. Pine Cottage was one of
the earliest buildings on the estate,
being erected as the Frenchman's Ken
nels. Later, when the present Quad
was being built, it was the architect's
headquarters.
