### 
Jacques Thibaud, violinist, and Alfred
Cortot will present the last concert for
the season of the Peninsula Musical As

sembly hall.
Both musicians are French artists, who j
are touring the United States separately, !
but their routes cross and they aire giv-!
ing three joint programs, one here and 1
two in San Francisco.
Four years ago Cortot made his first!
tour of America as soloist with the
French Orchestra. Each succeeding;
year he has made short tours on his i
leaves of absence from the Paris Con-1
servatoire, where he is professor.
Thibaud's first American tour oc-1
currcd twenty years ago, when he was

23 years old. He did not revisit this
country until 1913, and during the in
terval he had gained steadily in recog
nition in the musical world.
The program is varied. There will be
one ensemble number, two movements
of a sonata by Saint-Saens. Cortot and
Thibaud will each play two groups of
solos. Thibaud will give Kreisler, Rim

Charles Hart is Thibaud's accompanist
for this tour. Both artists have made
a strong impression on American con
cert goers in their successive tours of
the United States, especially in the East,
where they have given most of their
appearances. They have not been heard
here before and the Association Com
mittee predicts the unusual combination
of the two in a double bill will evoke
exceptional enthusiasm from the audi
ence.
The scats that remain for separate sale
may be secured at Crandall's at any
time now.
