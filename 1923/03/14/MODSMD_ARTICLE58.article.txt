# TRACK AND BASEBALL PROSPECTS ANALYZED IN APRIL SPECTATOR
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton's article in
the April Spectator, which goes on sale
Monday, throws a new light on Stan
ford's track prospects for this season.
Tetnpleton discusses the new men re
placing former stars whose loss caused
the dope makers to view the Cardinal
chances against California as pretty slim.
Pictures of the cinder artists in action
illustrate Templeton's discussion.
The career of the baseball varsity thus
far this season and their prospects for
the championship are told by Garrett El
more, '23. "Drawing the Color Line" is
an editorial defense of Dr. Barrow's
action in canceling the boxing bouts with
California because of California's en
trance of two negro contestants.
Robin Lampson describes his experi
ence in central Russian, where lie worked
with the Quaker Relief for a year. Dur
ing this time the Friends fed approxi
mately 350,000 people.
A one-act play, "Foster Mother," by
Mike McNickols, and a life of Professor
J. P. Smith, by Profesor Tolman, keep
up the literary traditions of the Spec
tator's predecessors. A rotagravure sec
tion and a review of "The Good Ship
Tenacity," a play that was censored at
the University of California, are addi
tional features of the April number.
