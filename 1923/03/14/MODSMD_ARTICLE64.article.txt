# Botany Majors to Give Report on Campus Oaks
## 
### 
Marjorie Swabey and Margaret Duff,
two Botany majors, have been preparing
an official report under the direction of
Professor James McMurphy of the Bot
any department, on the condition of the
campus oaks. The report will be com
pleted in a week more of work and is to
be turned in to the Comptroller or to the
President's office. The report deals with
the diseases troubling the oaks and with
the various types of rot and fungi which
have attacked the trees. One of the
most serious rots found is the so-called
"heart-rot," which eats along the branch
es and finally destroys the inner pith of
the tree. According to Professor Mc-
Murphy, the object of this investigation
is to locate diseased trees that are a
menace to people and property and either
remove the rot or if this is impossible
to cut them down.
