# DU BOIS OUTLINES NEGRO'S PART IN AMERICAN HISTORY
## 
### 
The negro as the center of American |
history and his contribution to all
phases of American progress, were
sketched by Dr. W. E. B. Dußois yes
terday afternoon in his lecture on "The
Negro in American History" in the Lit
tle Theater.
"It has been our policy to forget the
negro as a man," Dr. Dußois said. "We
have been taught to look upon him as
an incubus to be apologized for, a lia
bility, and a mistake to be gotten rid
of as soon as possible. But the negro
came with the earliest explorers and all
through the history of America he has
been among the defenders of his coun
try."
Dr. Dußois outlined the beginning of
the slave trade and mentioned the scien
tific inventions of the negro which have
been of more importance than his man
ual labor in aiding the economic prog
ress of the nation. A machine to ex
pedite shore manufacturing, a device for
lubricating locomotives, and an appliance
still used by the General Electric Com
pany were some of these inventions.
The speaker read extracts from docu
ments testifying to the hardihood and
bravery of the negro in wars dating
from those of the colonial period to the
recent world conflict. At no time has
there ever been any doubt of the negro's
loyalty to the country that first exploited
and then ignored him.
During the reconstruction days in the
South following the Civil War, the
negro for the first time took an activc
part in the political affairs of the nation.
Dr. Dußois described briefly the work
of these black statesmen who aided the
American people to realize that democ
racy meant democracy for all men, not
alone for the white race.
"The negroes are the only people who
have made any attempt to practice the
ethical principles of Jesus," Dr. Dußois
believes. He told of the negro's patience
under mistreatment and his policy of
"turning the other cheek."
The has contributed to America
; its only native music and his rich emo
tional nature has found expression in
art and literature.
An absolute lack of contact between
the white and the black races in the
j South is the cause of the negro "prob
| lem," according to Dr. Dußois. The only
I solution to this artificial situation is the
j contact in school ami college between the
races. For, the speaker said, if one
knows a member of a race, he knows him
as an individual with specific character
istics, but one can have all kinds of
fantastic ideas about a race.
Dr. Dußois met with the Cosmopolitan
Club after the lecture tor a half-hour
forum in which pertinent phases of the
negro question were discussed.

sketched by Dr. W. E. B. Dußois yes
terday afternoon in his lecture on "The
Negro in American History" in the Lit
tle Theater.
"It has been our policy to forget the
negro as a man," Dr. Dußois said. "We
have been taught to look upon him as
an incubus to be apologized for, a lia
bility, and a mistake to be gotten rid
of as soon as possible. But the negro
came with the earliest explorers and all
through the history of America he has
been among the defenders of his coun
try."
Dr. Dußois outlined the beginning of
the slave trade and mentioned the scien
tific inventions of the negro which have
been of more importance than his man
ual labor in aiding the economic prog
ress of the nation. A machine to ex
pedite shore manufacturing, a device for
lubricating locomotives, and an appliance
still used by the General Electric Com
pany were some of these inventions.
The speaker read extracts from docu
ments testifying to the hardihood and
bravery of the negro in wars dating
from those of the colonial period to the
recent world conflict. At no time has
there ever been any doubt of the negro's
loyalty to the country that first exploited
and then ignored him.
During the reconstruction days in the
South following the Civil War, the
negro for the first time took an activc
part in the political affairs of the nation.
Dr. Dußois described briefly the work
of these black statesmen who aided the
American people to realize that democ
racy meant democracy for all men, not
alone for the white race.
"The negroes are the only people who
have made any attempt to practice the
ethical principles of Jesus," Dr. Dußois
believes. He told of the negro's patience
under mistreatment and his policy of
"turning the other cheek."
The has contributed to America
; its only native music and his rich emo
tional nature has found expression in
art and literature.
An absolute lack of contact between
the white and the black races in the
j South is the cause of the negro "prob
| lem," according to Dr. Dußois. The only
I solution to this artificial situation is the
j contact in school ami college between the
races. For, the speaker said, if one
knows a member of a race, he knows him
as an individual with specific character
istics, but one can have all kinds of
fantastic ideas about a race.
Dr. Dußois met with the Cosmopolitan
Club after the lecture tor a half-hour
forum in which pertinent phases of the
negro question were discussed.
