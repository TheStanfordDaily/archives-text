# Y.M.C.A. Will Conduct Drive For Old Clothes
## 
### 
The local Y. M. C. A. will conduct
an old clothes drive for the benefit of
needy European students during exami
nation week. Representatives will be ap
pointed in the living groups and a suit
able receptacle placed in each.
All clothes collected will be sent to
New York, where they will be cleaned
and mended and then shipped to Europe,
so totally worn out clothes are not de
sired. All suits and pairs of shoes should
be tied together in order that they may
not become mixed up with others.
F. E. Morgan, local secretary of the
Y. M. C. A., states that over 1,200 pounds
of old clothes were collected in a similar
drive two or three years ago
