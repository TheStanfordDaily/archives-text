# Card Handball Team to Play Berkeley Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's handball team will meet the
1 Berkeley squad on the San Francisco
Y. M. C. A. courts at 7:30 tonight. The
match was originally scheduled for last
Friday night, but a misunderstanding
with regard to the time caused it to be
postponed until today.
Two doubles and two singles matches
will be played. Since Stanford has been
practicing soley with tennis balls,
each kind of ball will be used for two
matches. C. D. Rutter, '24, and Tim
Colvin, '24, will compose one doubles
team, and Fred Koba, '24, and J. B.
Sansone, '23, the other. The singles will
be cared for by Whiting Welch, '26, and
A1 Loewenstein, '24.
