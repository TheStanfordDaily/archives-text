# BOTANY TRIPS PLANNED FOR SPRING VACATION
## 
### 
Professor Leroy Adams of the Bot
any Department will make a botanical
collecting trip to the foothills of the
Sierra Nevada Mountains and Profes
sor Gordon F. Ferris of Entomology
and Mrs. Ferris who is an assistant in
the Botany Department, will visit the
Santa Lucia Mountains during the
spring vacation. Both trips have as
their object the gathering of additional
specimens for the Stanford Botanical
Collection. At this time of the year,
many species not as yet in the collec
tion, bloom and it is hoped these two
expeditions will be successful in se
curing the most important of the avail
able specimens. Professor Abrams has
not completed his plans for the trip
but he will take with him several as
sistants and will leave the campus
early in the week of vacation.
