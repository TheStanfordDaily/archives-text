# NEW BUILDING GIVEN BY ATHLETIC BOARD WILL BE DORMITORY
## 
### 
Branner Hall is the name that will
be given to the new men's dormitory
that is being built by the Board of
Athletic Control out of Income from
the Stanford stadium as a gift to the
University. The name commemorates
the services to Stanford and sym
pathetic interest in student affairs of
of the late John Casper Branner, pio
neer member of the faculty, first head
of the geology department, and second
president of the University.
The footings and foundation of Bran
ner Hall were put in several months
ago in order to avoid possible inter
ference by the rains, and the work of
putting up the forms and pouring the
walls will be begun at once since the i
force of carpenters that has been at
work on these two buildings then will
be released to go ahead with the con- i
struction of Branner Hall. It is hoped
that Branner Hall will be completed
and ready for occupancy at the begin
ning of the next college year so that
all three of the new buildings will be
put into use at that time.
Branner Hall will afford rooming,
and eating Accommodations for about j
150 men and is designed as a general !
dormitory on the general plan of Se-1
quoia Hall, instead of being utilized j
as Toyon Hall will be to house four
distinct groups. In external appearance J
Branner Hall will be almost a dupli
cate of Toyon Hall although there are
some differences in detail.
Unlike Toyon Hall, Branner Hall
will be equipped at once with a dining
room and kitchen. On the first floor,
also, it will hav>e a large living room
with a fireplace, instead of the great
lobby of Toyon Hal!. This living
room will be made attractive by open
courts on two sides.
The rooms in Branner Hall will be
arranged, for the most part, in two
room suites for two men each, the
typical suite consisting of a study, a
sleeping porch and an enclosed dress
ing room adjoining the sleeping porch.
Branner Hall is being built as a
gift to the University with funds de
rived from the Stanford stadium, in
cluding about $50,000 of the original
gifts for the building of the stadium
which were made with the understand
ing that they would be later applied to
! some non-athletic university purpose
and which have since been assigned
to the building of this dormitory by the
Advisory Board of the Alumni Associa
tion, to whose discretion the disposi
tion of this fund was left.
