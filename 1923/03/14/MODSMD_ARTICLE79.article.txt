# Stanford Band Plays at Palo Alto Base Hospital
## 
### 
Stanford Band played at the Base Hos
pital near Palo Alto for an hour on
Monday afternoon to provide diversion
for several hundred tubercular patients,
whose chief joy in life is to stay in bed
and observe the scenery through their
windows. Marches, popular music and
overtures played by the band were some
thing out of the ordinary for the conva
lescents to hear and enjoy. A number
of people from Palo came out to the hos
pital to hear the music.
