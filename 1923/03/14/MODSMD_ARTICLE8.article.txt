; with the technique of his profession.
: and the young bond salesman, who has
| only ingenuousness, is successful in
the end.
Clever dialogue and startling situa
tions are the features of the plot.
There are also many opportunities for
; good songs and choruses. Several lyr
ics from one of the other plots turned
in may be used in the opera chosen.
