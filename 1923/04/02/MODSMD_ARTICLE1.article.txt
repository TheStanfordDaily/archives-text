# SEATS FOR "WILL SHAKESPEARE" ON SALE TOMORROW
## Vacation Rehearsing of Cast Principals Gives Promise Of Unusually Fine Acting 
### 
Seats for "Will Shakespeare," Clem
ence Dane's four-act drama to be pre
sented Friday evening, April 6, by the
English Club, will go on sale tomor
row at 1 p.m., in the Administration
building.
All six principals of the piece re
hearsed in the Assembly hall during
the vacation. The players recom- j
menced work Friday evening after
examinations, and have been rehears-'
ing both morning and afternoon of
each vacation day. Because of the free
dom from interruption the vacation
has afforded, the principals have been
able to make considerable headway.
Bentinck found it necessary to make
several changes in the cast during
examination week. Helen Whitney,
who was to play Mary Fitton, the
"dark lady of the sonnets," was taken
ill and obliged to give up her work in
the piece. Mrs. L. B. Wallis, who was
to appear as Queen Elizabeth, will
take over the role of Mary Fitton.
Mrs. Wallis was originally selected to
play this part, but showed such versa
tility that Bentinck found it best to
play her as the queen. Mrs. Wallis'
voice seems to adapt her naturally to
the role of Mary Fitton.
Queen Elizabeth, the characteriza
tion which has received the most gen
erous approval of critics, will be
played by Kathryn McCahan, '25. Al
though Miss McCahan was handi-1
capped by a late start, the vacation re- ■
hearsing enabled her to catch up with
the other members of the cast.
Delmer Daves, '26, will take over
Matthew Tobriner's work as Kit Mar- j
lowe, the friend and rival of Will i
Shakespeare. Tobriner was engaged
in other work which conflicted with
his rehearsing.
The other principals who have been
rehearsing in the Assembly hall dur
ing the vacation are Miriam Hilton,!
who plays Anne, the wife of Will
Shakespeare; A. D. Cohan, as Hens
lowe, the actor; and Richard Bentinck,
who takes the title role.
