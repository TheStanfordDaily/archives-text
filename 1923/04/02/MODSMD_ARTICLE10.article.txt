# CARD TRACKSTERS DEFEAT TROJANS BY 75-56 SCORE
## Southerners Invade Campus Tomorrow Afternoon For Second Meet With Locals 
### 
Charlie Paddock and Otto Anderson
annexed twenty-eight points while
their teammates were piling up as
many more, but the Cardinal track
team's superiority in the distances,
pole vault, and javelin, gave them
Beventy-five points and a victory over
the Trojan tracksters on Bovard Field,
Saturday, March 24.
"The World's Fastest Human"
scored his regulation ten points in the
100 and 220, but failed to beat his pre
vious records. Anderson won both
hurdles and the broad jump and fol
lowed Paddock to the tape in the cen
tury for a total of eighteen points.
The Cards made a clean sweep of
the 880, mile, two-mile, and javelin,
and only allowed the southerners half
a point in the pole vault.
Little Yale Martz provided the big
gest thrill of the meet in the relay.
In the first three laps the Cards had
piled up a fifteen-yard lead, and Van
Judah started on the final 440-yard
stretch well out in front of Martz. The
diminutive Trojan gained fast on the
back stretch. In the last 100 yards he
pulled up abreast of the Cardinal run
ner, and in the most sensational finish
seen on the southern track in years,
the relay ended in a dead heat.
This same Martz won the 440-yard
dash in the fast time of 0.49 4-5.
"Blink" Williamson was the Stanford
hero of this race, in spite of the fact
that he failed to place. He set such a
fast pace that Johnson, dusky U. S. C.
runner, was nosed out of second place
by Van Judah, who came in fast on
the inside lane. Martz was satisfied to
let the others set the pace until the
home stretch, when he left them five
yards to the rear.
"Dink" Templeton presented a well
balanced lineup and his team's
strength in second and third places
helped materially. U. S. C. gathered
eight first places to the Cardinals'
five, and there was one tie for first
in the high jump..
By defeating the southerners 75-56,
the Cards raised Walt Christie's Bruin
squad two points and gave the dope
sters something to thing about before
