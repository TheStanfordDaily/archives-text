ates. Princeton, the University of
Michigan, and the Carnegie Institute
of Technology have incorporated pro
fessional dramatic training such as
House would like given at Stanford.

lace Irwin, celebrates the antecedents
of some sons of Stanford gamboliers.

an editorial by Paul H. Clyde, '20,
editor of the Review. Dr. Jordan's ad

and the radio talks broadcasted on
Founders' Day are included in the
April number.
