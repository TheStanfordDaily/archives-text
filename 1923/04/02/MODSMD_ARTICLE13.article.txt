# FIRE DEPARTMENT SECURES POWERFUL SEAGRAVE ENGINE
## Board of Underwriters of Pacific Authorizes Large Reduction in Insurance Rates on Campus. 
### 
As the result of the acquisition of a
new powerful Seagrave chemical en
gine by the Stanford Fire Department,
and measures taken in the past by
University authorities to eliminate
fire hazard, the Board of Fire Under
writers of the Pacific has authorized a
20 per cent reduction in insurance
rates on all dwelling houses on the
campus. In addition to giving Stanford
University probably better fire pro
tection than that of many cities in the
United States, Comptroller Roth be
lieves that there will be an annual
saving of between $750 and $1000'.
The fire underwriters recommended
a larger pumping engine than the one
Stanford possessed in order to secure
the reduction in rates. The old engine
was capable of giving 375 gallons of
water per minute. The University be
gan an investigation and was fortun
ate in picking up a 1000-gallon-a-min
ute Seagrave.
The Seagrave Motor Company at
Columbus, Ohio, of which Julius F.
Stone, president and treasurer of
Ohio State University, is head, was
liberal in its offer to the University,
allowing full credit on the smaller en
gine which has been in service at
Stanford for the past seventeen
months. Because the "baby" Seagrave
had been taken care of in 100 per cent

fashion by Fire Marshal Ed Lamb,
Stanford was able to effect the ex
change and secure what is considered
to be "the last word in fire fighting
apparatus." The new engine is capable
of handling four two and one-half inch
streams of water and will be used
primarily for fires on the Quad and in
the halls.
In addition to the new Seagrave, &
240-gallon chemical engine is built in
the Corporation Yard shops which will
give the campus even better fire
equipment. This engine is being con
structed from a ninety horse-power
web hose truck given the University
last fall by the Seagrave Company.
Four 60-gallon chemical tanks are be
ing added to the chassis.
Ed Lamb took the new Seagrave up
to the Searsville dam last week to
clear the two outlets of silt which
had collected. The powerful engine
accomplished the work rapidly and ef
ficiently by hydraulic pressure.
Lamb is eloquent in his praise of
Stanford's new fire-fighting acquisition
and claims that there is no engine bet
ter equipped to cope with fire under
conditions as exist here at Stanford,
than a Seagrave. The machine is a
vivid Cardinal red. On each side of
the hood, "Stanford University" and a,
block "S" will be painted.

apparatus." The new engine is capable
of handling four two and one-half inch
streams of water and will be used
primarily for fires on the Quad and in
the halls.
In addition to the new Seagrave, &
240-gallon chemical engine is built in
the Corporation Yard shops which will
give the campus even better fire
equipment. This engine is being con
structed from a ninety horse-power
web hose truck given the University
last fall by the Seagrave Company.
Four 60-gallon chemical tanks are be
ing added to the chassis.
Ed Lamb took the new Seagrave up
to the Searsville dam last week to
clear the two outlets of silt which
had collected. The powerful engine
accomplished the work rapidly and ef
ficiently by hydraulic pressure.
Lamb is eloquent in his praise of
Stanford's new fire-fighting acquisition
and claims that there is no engine bet
ter equipped to cope with fire under
conditions as exist here at Stanford,
than a Seagrave. The machine is a
vivid Cardinal red. On each side of
the hood, "Stanford University" and a,
block "S" will be painted.
As the result of the acquisition of a
new powerful Seagrave chemical en
gine by the Stanford Fire Department,
and measures taken in the past by
University authorities to eliminate
fire hazard, the Board of Fire Under
writers of the Pacific has authorized a
20 per cent reduction in insurance
rates on all dwelling houses on the
campus. In addition to giving Stanford
University probably better fire pro
tection than that of many cities in the
United States, Comptroller Roth be
lieves that there will be an annual
saving of between $750 and $1000'.
The fire underwriters recommended
a larger pumping engine than the one
Stanford possessed in order to secure
the reduction in rates. The old engine
was capable of giving 375 gallons of
water per minute. The University be
gan an investigation and was fortun
ate in picking up a 1000-gallon-a-min
ute Seagrave.
The Seagrave Motor Company at
Columbus, Ohio, of which Julius F.
Stone, president and treasurer of
Ohio State University, is head, was
liberal in its offer to the University,
allowing full credit on the smaller en
gine which has been in service at
Stanford for the past seventeen
months. Because the "baby" Seagrave
had been taken care of in 100 per cent

fashion by Fire Marshal Ed Lamb,
Stanford was able to effect the ex
change and secure what is considered
to be "the last word in fire fighting
apparatus." The new engine is capable
