# BABE NINE CAPTURES TWO OUT OF THREE VACATION CONTESTS
## 
### 
The freshman baseball team won
two games and lost one on the trip
made into the southern part of the
state daring vacation. Last Thursday
the team lost to Dinuba by the one
sided score of 12-1, won from Lamoore
on Friday 19-5, and defeated Hanford
on Saturday by a score of 13-1.
The first game was played almost
immediately after examination week
and the team liad had only two prac
tices before the game. They had made
a long auto trip to Dinuba, arriving
just prior to the time for the game.
All the breaks went to the opponents,
and although the freshmen made two
or three errors, the Dinuba players
hit the ball hard and often. Ditzler
pitched the first two innings and al
lowed six hits. Every ball hit by the
Dinuba men went where the Stanford
players couldn't reach it, and the re
sult was the one-sided score. Oviatt
pitched the last seven innings, but
was not able to hold the opponents
in check much more than Ditzler. The
freshmen hit the ball twenty-seven
times, but twenty-one of those hits
sailed into the waiting hands of the
Dinuba fielders. They were nearly all
infield flies, the remainder being high
flies to the outfield. The Dinuba team
had been defeated 9-4 by the Hanford
team, which the freshmen trounced
two days later by the score of 13-1.
The freshman team took the field
against Lamoore Friday afternoon and
had little diciculty in trimming their
opponents 19-5 on good solid hitting.
Nevers, who played in the outfield,
was hitting the ball far and often. Had
it not been for a barn located in the
outfield lie would have been credited
with two home runs, but his blows hit
the building and bounded back into
the field of play. In the sixth inning
the freshmen made nine hits, six of
which were doubles. Ditzler, who had
received such a warm welcome the
day before, pitched an air-tight game,
and with perfect support behind him
was able to hold the opponents to one
lone tally.
On Saturday the team met the Han
ford aggregation and defeated them
