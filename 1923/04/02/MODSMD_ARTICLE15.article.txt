# OLD JUPITER PLUVIUS KEEPS ROUGHS FROM EARLY REGISTRATION
## 
### 
Old Jupiter Pluvius slowed up regis
tration this morning to such an ex
tent that the Registrar's office has
been rushed a.ll afternoon with stu
dents eager to exchange their tuition
money for a certificate of registration.
No figures on the number of students
enrolled are available yet, but accord
ing to C. D. Goddard, assistant regis
trar, the registration during the day
has been practically the same as on
the first day last quarter. If any rec
ords are to be smashed, he said, a
great many students will have to ap
pear in the hour before five o'clock to
boost the total.
Many students were struck with the
origjnal idea, so they thought, that if
they were at the registrar's office at
opening time they would be able to
register in a few minutes, or at least
ahead of the mob. However, the
rough who appeared at the door at 8
a. m. was badly fooled in this respect
as three lines of great length stretched
from the door of the administration
building down the steps to the road in
front of the quad.
