### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
Because the men at the University of
California copied the "side-burns" of
Rudolph Valentino, the co-eds have
adopted the head-dress worn by Mrs.
Valentino in the dances given by the
film star and his wife. Marcels and
bobs have given way to the snmpler
coiffeur, which consists of the hair
parted in the middle, and brought
straight down to the ears, where it is
coiled into buns. The dancer has made
this mode almost as famous as that
of her husband.
