# COMING THROUGH
## 
### 
At this time last year the amateur prophets were
busy predicting - how close the Stanford track team
would come to Walter Christie's assortment of stars.
The prospect was not especially encouraging; opti
mists gave California the meet by three points;
"Brick" Morse thought we might get 55, with plenty
of horseshoes.
Not so many wails are heard from the dopesters
this season. True, the Big Meet is not the "sure
thing" event it appeared to be three months ago.
But after Stanford's performance of the past two
weeks are placed side by side with those of the Bears
no one can doubt that the team built up by "Dink"
Templeton is every bit as well-balanced as Mr.
Christie's. First, second, and third place men have
been developed out of what was apparently thin air;
potential stars have sprinted into the limelight, and
those of the old guard who remained from last year
are finding themselves working overtime to keep in
the front row. This after the Cardinal machine
apparently was wrecked when its most necessary
parts jarred loose on a bump in the scholarship
grade.
All of which goes to prove that "Dink" Templeton
has an excellent chance in the next three weeks to
prove to the public what everyone down at the track
house already knowsâ€”that he is one of the greatest
"come through" coaches Stanford athletics has seen.
