# IN THE SPRING—
## 
### 
Vacation could not have come at a more welcome
time. California has been at its best during the last
week and those who spent the holidays wisely are
back on the campus full of the joy of living and the
desire to do things.
For many in the student body it has been far
from a week of idleness. While most of us were
blissfully enjoying complete freedom from eight
o'clocks, committee meetings, and quiz sections,
there were those who were busy spreading Stan
ford's fame. The name of Stanford was on every
one's lips in the southern part of the state particu
larly. Stanford people were everywhere and all
were proud of what their representatives were doing
to bring recognition from the general public.
It began with the victory of the track team over
the University of Southern California the day after
finals. In quick succession came reports of the per
formances of the boxing and wrestling teams, the
fencers and the Glee Club. In the East the swim
mers and in Arizona the polo players were bringing
honor to Stanford.
Everyone likes to be a part of an institution which
is known favorably to the public. The satisfaction
is even greater if he is one of those actively engaged
in establishing that reputation. The men who have
been representing the University during the spring
holidays have undoubtedly enjoyed doing it. At the
same time those of us who only sat by asd watched
are reaping some of the benelts of their work—and
for that we owe them some expression of appreci
ation.

When the old grads hark back to their college days
they think mostly of Stanford in the sunshine of a
California spring—they think of canoes and cool
water, of pretty women and light frocks (all "co-ed"
jokes to the contrary), of blossoms and the rest of
the poet's paraphernalia. The next three months
will be memory-creating months—they can be happy
months.
\Y hile this is the quarter filled with the most gen
uine enjoyment and which brings the full realization
of what a pleasant place Stanford is in which to
spend four years or more—it is also the quarter in

which many students lose their balance and topple
off the edge of the campus. Lake sports vie with
classes, studies and women battle for attention. The
young man's fancy flits here and there, seldom light
ing upon the pages of a textbook.
Each spring quarter brings the old students more
attractions—and he who is wise arranges his activi
ties so the enjoyment of those attractions will not
lead to the forfeiture of future springs.
