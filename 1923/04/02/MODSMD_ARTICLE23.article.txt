I've wished for women, wine, and song,
I've dreamed of castles in the air,
I've hoped that riches might be mine—
'Tis all in vain that I despair.
Of kings and queens to kiss my feet,
Of ladies fair to love, to kiss and keep,
Of palaces and land —such were my dreams —
Endless myriads of empty-headed sleep.
But all this bunko now has vanished,
And other gloom brings on this fancy—
Oh! How I wish I had a moustache,
Like the girl who sits beside me. —PLUTO.
Visitor —"When do you wear your dinks?"
Frosh—"Just about all the time. I even wear mine
over the week end."
Visitor—"l didn't ask you where, I asked you when."

One of the most thrilling contests of the evening took
place when Theda Bara's two brothers, Paul and Wheel,
tackled E. Z. Going and Harry Didit of Broomsville.
Although the Broomsville lads were credited with the
victory, Paul Bara came away with four of his opponent's
marbles which he had hidden in his pocket.

Tin, Tex. —County authorities have appointed two

Once again the weary students flock eagerly back to
Alma Mater, after ten days spent in telling the old home
folks about their wonderful college dare; once again the
weary-ing 500 come back from being nice little girls in
the old home town, to being haughty, proud co-eds in
the cradle of knowledges.
* * *
Once again it is time to put off lessons till tomorrow,
and spend the night sitting up with sick poker hands;
once again we start on the hunt for —sh-h-h-h — how are
you, Mr. Volstead? ; once again it is time . . . .
oh, hell, ain't college wonderful?
• * •
It is reported through unreliable sources (see any
S. F. paper) that California's sport writers have used up
much copy paper and valuable time figuring on some
thing (we don't know just what) since the California
and Stanford meets with U. S. C. However, what we
guess is that they are trying to do what has never been
done —square the circle, perhaps, or maybe trying to
square the track team. —I. C. S.

Worser: "Dearest, I am thrilled. Do you really mean

"You know, things aren't what they used to be," re

And other gloom brings on this fancy—
Oh! How I wish I had a moustache,
Like the girl who sits beside me. —PLUTO.
Visitor —"When do you wear your dinks?"
Frosh—"Just about all the time. I even wear mine
over the week end."
Visitor—"l didn't ask you where, I asked you when."

One of the most thrilling contests of the evening took
place when Theda Bara's two brothers, Paul and Wheel,
tackled E. Z. Going and Harry Didit of Broomsville.
Although the Broomsville lads were credited with the
victory, Paul Bara came away with four of his opponent's
marbles which he had hidden in his pocket.

Tin, Tex. —County authorities have appointed two

Once again the weary students flock eagerly back to
Alma Mater, after ten days spent in telling the old home
folks about their wonderful college dare; once again the
weary-ing 500 come back from being nice little girls in
the old home town, to being haughty, proud co-eds in
the cradle of knowledges.
* * *
Once again it is time to put off lessons till tomorrow,
and spend the night sitting up with sick poker hands;
once again we start on the hunt for —sh-h-h-h — how are
you, Mr. Volstead? ; once again it is time . . . .
oh, hell, ain't college wonderful?

It is reported through unreliable sources (see any
S. F. paper) that California's sport writers have used up
much copy paper and valuable time figuring on some
thing (we don't know just what) since the California

—PINK RASPBERRY.
I've wished for women, wine, and song,
I've dreamed of castles in the air,
I've hoped that riches might be mine—
'Tis all in vain that I despair.
Of kings and queens to kiss my feet,
Of ladies fair to love, to kiss and keep,
Of palaces and land —such were my dreams —
Endless myriads of empty-headed sleep.
