# BRILLIANT TECHNIQNE DISPLAYED IN MUSIC OF THIBAUD, CORTOT
## 
### Miriam Hilton, '25 
Playing in perfect ensemble and with
a variety of tone-color, Alfred Cortot,
pianist, and Jacques Thibaud, violinist,
gave a particularly pleasing concert in
the first number, "Sonata D minor," by
Both artists won their audience with
the lrst number, "Sonata D minor," by
Saint-Saens, in which splendid technical
skill were displayed.
One of the most unusual interpreta
tions on the program was Liszt's Second
Rhapsodie, which Cortot played in a free

style. Several Chopin Etudes and
'"Litany" by Schubert were beautifully
| executed. The latter number, a rather
sentimental composition, was tastefully
! played in a simple manner.
With tire and wonderful technique,
Thibaud's performance upon the violin
contributed a sparkle and brilliancy to
the program which is characteristic of
the French violinist. The dignity of his
"Intrada" was contrasted with the deli
cacy of several Kreisler arrangements,
although in "Liebesfreud,' an encore, lie
seemed to miss Kreisler's spontanety.
Accompanying Thibaud at the piano
was Charles Hart, whose playing was a
delightful example of what an accom
paniment should be.
