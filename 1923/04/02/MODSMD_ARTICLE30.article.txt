## 
### 
The Los Angeles Athletic Club defeat

of the Stanford fencers lost their bouts
by a one-point margin.

other in a round robin, as is usually
done, each team had six men who fenced
twice in the semi-finals, and then the
three winners on each team met in the
finals, making fifteen matches in all.
Sandretto, Gardiner, and Bugge were the
three Stanford fencers who survived the
preliminaries, but they were unable to
defeat the club men in the finals. The
other Stanford men who fenced were
Aguerrevere, Monaco, and Richardson.
