# SIXTY-SEVEN DAYS BEFORE FACULTY AX DESCENDS ONCE MORE
## 
### 
Now the pessimist comes forth with
the startling announcement that it is only
sixty-seven days to tinals. And those of
us who evaded the faculty axe by ever
so small a margin last quarter, begin to
feel ghastly queer and decidedly uncom
fortable before we have again even
started.
Life does seem one round of hard
ships, doesn't it? And especially college
life? But now that Lagunita is offering
its charms, and spring is here, and the
track season has commenced in earnest,
well, things don't seem half-bad after all.
We students who chase hurriedly from
one classroom to another like scared
jackrabbits, rarely have time to notice
the real Stanford, it seems. Or perhaps
we have become so accustomed to things
here that we notice them no more than
we would the old picture that hangs on
the northeast wall at home.
There are lots of things about Stan
ford that are still "undiscovered" by
the majority of students. But they will
surely be found when these same stu
dents become alumni. Then, when
they think about the days back on
the Quad, these things will form them
selves into tangible pictures with sig
nificant meanings—these things which
the average undergraduate it seems
cannot adequately comprehend.
But as I started out to say, this
quarter looks pretty bright in spite
of the sixty-seven days of academic
hardship the pessimist says are in
store for us. And these next ten weeks
can be made even brighter, if some
time we will but let ourselves loose
and try to "discover" some of this
stuff that is so hard to find, but which
really makes Stanford and gives it
the reputation that it now holds. Per
haps, that stuff is "atmosphere."
