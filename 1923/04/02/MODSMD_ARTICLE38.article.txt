The Old Boy is all a-flutter this
happy Registration Day. Not that he
hasn't had time to register for a few
pipe courses, but he just had to dash
right out and then right back again.
The Anxious Reporter barely had time
to get a few words from him, but
"them was momentous words." For
the Ancient One tells us that on the
fourth of the present month, this same
year, the Chaparral and the Pelican
are going to put out a JOINT ISSUE.
The Old Boy has certainly worked
for this joint issue; he claims that he
has visited every joint in between
Frisco and Jose, getting joint material.
However that may be, he seems to be
looking for something good in the way
of the next issue, and rumors coming
from the Berkeley campus are to the
same effect.
