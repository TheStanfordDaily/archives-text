# VARSITY NINE WINS ALL FOUR CONTESTS IN SPRING RECESS
## 
### Bill Wright, '25 
An unbroken string of four vic
tories rewarded the self-denial of the
Stanford Varsity baseball nine, which
devoted most of the vacation to the
national pastime. The Cards showed
a strong offensive throughout, and the
pitching staff made it plain that win
ning games was the best thing they
do. They eased up when it was pos
sible and kept tight in the pinches,
and they had the proper support. The
Cardinal varsity looks good.
Santa Clara was the first team to
sample the rejuvenated Redshirts, and
the struggle lasted for twelve innings.
Parker and Carver shared the honors
for breaking up the game, when the
former walked, took second on a bad
throw by Marque, and brought in the
winning run on Carver's long smash to
center field. Santa Clara was unable
to rise to the emergency.
Solomon went the distance for the
Cardinals and issued eight hits, but
kept them so well dispersed that the
seven timely blows gathered by his j
teammates were made to count for an !
extra run. Stanford scored twice in j
the first and registered once in the!
sixth, after which Prendergrast re- ■
placed Heinzman on the mound and
stopped the scoring until the twelfth
frame.
In the final game of the winter quar
ter the following Saturday, Saint
Mary's dropped a game to the Cards
after carrying off the first two en- j
tanglements of the series. Stanford j
held a five-run lead until the eighth
inning, when a batting rally, combined
with two errors, allowed St. Mary's to
bring the final score to 5 to 3. A dan
gerous rally in the ninth was cut short
by a double play, Woodward to Pat
terson, after a double and a single had
put two Oaklanders on the paths with
none out. Lowenstein hurled a nice
game, issuing only two bingles until
he weakened in the eighth frame.
Clark relieved him in the ninth, and
was saved by the double play after
allowing two hits and accomplishing a
strike-out.
The University of Southern Cali
fornia sent a squad up north to meet
the Cardinals on March 29 and 30,
losing both games by lop-sided scores.
The first game, a 7-to-3 Stanford vic
tory, was an even bet until the eighth
inning. With the score tied at three
all, and Parker and Woodward on the
paths, Patterson boosted out a home
run which took the fun out of it for
U. S. C. Solomon allowed nine scat
tered hits while the Cards were bring
ing in thirteen. Patterson and Carver
turned in three bingles out of four
trips to the plate.
Bases on balls played a prominent
part in the 10-to-2 landslide on Friday
afternoon. Jones, the U. S. C. twirler,
passed eight men and most of them
made the circuit. Dick Lawson sent
two men in ahead of him on a freak
home run in the fourth, and Woodward
did the same when he doubled in the
sixth. The Stanford batsmen account
ed for eleven safe blows, while Teague
was dealing out nine of the same,
Teague was all set for a shut-out until
the final frame, when he eased up and
allowed the Trojans a brace of runs
on four consecutive singles.
A game scheduled with the Olympic
Club for Saturday afternoon was
called off on account of rain.

The University of Southern Cali
fornia sent a squad up north to meet
the Cardinals on March 29 and 30,
losing both games by lop-sided scores.
The first game, a 7-to-3 Stanford vic
tory, was an even bet until the eighth
inning. With the score tied at three
all, and Parker and Woodward on the
paths, Patterson boosted out a home
run which took the fun out of it for
U. S. C. Solomon allowed nine scat
tered hits while the Cards were bring
ing in thirteen. Patterson and Carver
turned in three bingles out of four
trips to the plate.
Bases on balls played a prominent
part in the 10-to-2 landslide on Friday
afternoon. Jones, the U. S. C. twirler,
passed eight men and most of them
made the circuit. Dick Lawson sent
two men in ahead of him on a freak
home run in the fourth, and Woodward
did the same when he doubled in the
sixth. The Stanford batsmen account
ed for eleven safe blows, while Teague
was dealing out nine of the same,
Teague was all set for a shut-out until
the final frame, when he eased up and
allowed the Trojans a brace of runs
on four consecutive singles.
A game scheduled with the Olympic
Club for Saturday afternoon was
called off on account of rain.
An unbroken string of four vic
tories rewarded the self-denial of the
Stanford Varsity baseball nine, which
devoted most of the vacation to the
national pastime. The Cards showed
a strong offensive throughout, and the
pitching staff made it plain that win
ning games was the best thing they
do. They eased up when it was pos
sible and kept tight in the pinches,
and they had the proper support. The
Cardinal varsity looks good.
Santa Clara was the first team to
sample the rejuvenated Redshirts, and
the struggle lasted for twelve innings.
Parker and Carver shared the honors
for breaking up the game, when the
former walked, took second on a bad
throw by Marque, and brought in the
winning run on Carver's long smash to
center field. Santa Clara was unable
to rise to the emergency.
Solomon went the distance for the
Cardinals and issued eight hits, but
kept them so well dispersed that the
seven timely blows gathered by his j
teammates were made to count for an !
extra run. Stanford scored twice in j
the first and registered once in the!
sixth, after which Prendergrast re- ■
placed Heinzman on the mound and
stopped the scoring until the twelfth
frame.
In the final game of the winter quar
ter the following Saturday, Saint
Mary's dropped a game to the Cards
after carrying off the first two en- j
tanglements of the series. Stanford j
held a five-run lead until the eighth
inning, when a batting rally, combined
with two errors, allowed St. Mary's to
bring the final score to 5 to 3. A dan
gerous rally in the ninth was cut short
by a double play, Woodward to Pat
terson, after a double and a single had
put two Oaklanders on the paths with
none out. Lowenstein hurled a nice
game, issuing only two bingles until
he weakened in the eighth frame.
Clark relieved him in the ninth, and
was saved by the double play after
allowing two hits and accomplishing a
strike-out.
