# FEATURE, COMEDY MAKE UP PICTURE PROGRAM TONIGHT
## Second Student Movie Starts At 7 p.m.; To Be Followed By Dance in Clubhouse 
### 
Taylor Holmes in "Nothing but the
Truth,"and Bobby Vernon in "Pardon
My Glove," are the headliners in the sec
ond moving picture program to be pre
sented on the campus, in the Assembly
hall, at 7 o'clock this evening.
The feature is the story of a young
man who wagers $30,000 he can and will
tell the absolute truth for a week. He
is invited to a house party and immedi
ately gets into trouble with the girl he
loves. His complications increase as the
week of truth-telling progresses, but he
finally wins the bet.
The committee in charge is attempting
to plan light comedy programs without
running any "slapstick" or "educational'
films to fill up the time. Shristie comedies
have always proved popular, so Bobby
Vernon was booked for tonight, and a
new Buster Keaton comedy has been
scheduled for the last of Auril. Arrange
ments have been planned to take the
news film from the Eastern train as soon
as it arrives. If this proves successful,
the news will be shown here before it is
released to the leading theaters in San
Francisco.
Only three pictures will be shown this
evening: the feature, news, and comedy.
The show will start promtply at 7 o'clock.
Admission will again be 25 cents, but if
the attendance is over a thousand, the
price will be reduced for "Peggy Puts It
Over," the next movie scheduled. The
doors will open at 6:45.
Immediately following the pictures,
Whitmer's orchestra will play for the
usual registration dance in the Women's
Clubhouse. The dance will last from 9
to 12, and the regular admission price
of $1 will be charged.
