rf Expression in Architecture"
TN the hank building the architect has sought always tn express the
ideal of dignity: the engineer has expressed the ideal of stability.
Architect and engineer together have made of the American business
building a co-ordination of design, construction and equipment that
is a world criterion. Each year finds the American business building
anticipating even more remarkable developments in the near future.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organiza
tion. will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture
of the future.
