## 
### 
Advisory Coach "Pop" Warner and
Line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill arrived on
the campus this morning and with Coach
Andy Kerr are in readiness to set Stan
ford's football machine in motion to
morrow afternoon on the varsity practice
field. Practice was to have started to
day, but it was postponed due to the
track meet with U. S. C.
Many of the old varsity stars have
already signed up and several freshmen
grldders have registered on the roster.
When "Pop" was here at spring prac
tice last year, he urged that every man
report for spring practice whether he
possessed a knowledge of the game or
not. He is just as insistent in his ap
peal this year. Men who have had no
previous experience will be helped in
every way possible to learn the funda
mental rudiments of the game. Work
for the present will consist mainly in
kicking, blocking and tackling, with a
few of the more simpler plays later in
the season.
