UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA —Co-eds are substitut
ing "Royal Baking" for the expensive
face powders.
It has been estimated that the aver
age lifetime of a woman is seventy
five. The modern girl starts using cos
metics at twelve. This would leave
sixty-three years, during which time
she would spend $1,168.02 on face
powder.
On the other hand it would buy 1557
sacks of flour, which in turn would
make 2.491,776 loaves of bread. One
of the fairer sex has decided to go into
the chicken business. For $1,168.02 she
can get 1168 chickens. In one year
they will lay 11,025 eggs. These in
turn will be sold and more chickens
bought. In sixty-three years she will
have $6,863,240.08 to put toward the
U. S. C. endowment fund.
This baking powder idea is an en
tirely new experiment, and is expected
to be very uplifting. One who has al
ready tried it claims she rises every
day.
