# SLIPPING OFF
## 
### 
Many students who gathered at the Assembly hall
last evening for the second campus movie program
were distinctly disappointed. Feminine attire of the
vintage of 1915 or thereal>outs and exhibitions of
the rag as it was danced in its infancy, together with
att age-old story, are not very convincing when one
lia* been promised fairly modern productions. Oc
casional flickering of the film and other mechanical
inconveniences might be forgiven in view of the fact
that the Assembly hall was not designed primarily
as a movie palace, but the men in charge of arrang
ing the program should make some effort to secure
pictures of the latter part of the decade, especially
in view of the advance publicity which made some
claim to modernity.
The "experiment program" last quarter proved
that students do appreciate the advantages of that
form of entertainment on the campus, and their
support last evening must have been encouraging to
those promoting the shows. We cannot expect first
releases to be brought directly to the campus for the
reasonable price which is being charged, but we
ought not to have to review the classics of our high
school days.
"There was no complaint to offer for last quarter's
program. Let us hope that the shiny apples were not
all placed 011 top of the box.
