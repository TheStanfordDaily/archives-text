# JUSTIFYING THE COMICS

### 
"Those who can, do; those who can't, teach."
George Bernard Shaw's epigram might have a
direct application to several members of the Stanford
faculty. There is a jx)pular impression that the col
lege professor is a queer bird—witness any comic
section. Four years of contact with the species
usually shows that even in a college facultv the
human beings are in the majority. But it is so easy
for a few to justify the ancient wheezes that the
class must continue to suffer.
When we hear a professor insisting that the stu
dents must believe as he believes in order to pass a
course in which personal convictions are inevitable;
when we hear another publicly berate the character
of a student, whom he does not know personally,
merely upon the basis of an expressed opinion ; when
another makes the class pay for his absence by piling
work upon them at the cflose of the quarter; when
others do the hundred and one little things that prove
them to be purely mechanical information collectors
—is it much wonder that ridiculing professors is one
•of the popular indoor sports of the layman?
It is just foolish to scoff at anything and every
thing an instructor says, indiscriminately consider
ing him a single-track oddity who does not know life,
as it is to swallow unqualified any opinion he may
express as from an indisputable oracle.
A little more self-education, merely taking ad
vantage of the information which the professor can
offer in his particular line, would help to make us
truly intelligent persons.
