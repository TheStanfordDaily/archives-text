KNOW THYSELF

The greatest benefit which can be derived from a
well-rounded college education is an intellectual curi
osity sufficiently aroused to create in its possessor a
definite knowledge of his aptitude and fitness in any
particular field. An Arts College course, after all, is but
a four-year seasoning process which serves to tone down
the crudities and bring out the highlights of the raw
material subjected to it, turning it forth in a malleable
state, but certain of some useful purpose.
No man of well-balanced mentality goes forth from
the halls of his Alma Mater at the end of the conven
tional four years, sheepskin in hand, to anounce to an
indifferent world that here is a scholar, an intellect
bursting with a sense of its own omniscience and great
ness. Fortunate, rather, is the embryo alumnus who,
when the period of sequestration draws to a close, can
confide in all conscience to himself that at least he
knows his mission during life, his general fitness in
the scheme of things.
It is a fondly cherished belief of most of us that
that is what our University accomplishes. Yet an ex
ceedingly small proportion of entering students, em
barking on a rosy campus career in all the pristine
vigor of the average prep school graduate, really know
themselves. Upon what basis can they suppose that
Engineering or chemistry, for instance, is beckoning to
them as being especially adapted to such highly techni
cal callings? What reason have they to suppose that
their talents will lend themselves to such a training,
or be so endowed as to keep interest in the subject
alive? How many such vocations are really genuine?
The all too familiar sight of a wandering, homeless
outcast of a professional school, seeking admission to
the Arts College, or, in fact, to any of the departments
of the University which will grant him entrance, attests
the crime of allowing such men to venture unwarned
into specialized fields. The popular fallacy that the
Arts College is a resort for four years of luxurious ease
is gradually being allayed, with the result, it is hoped,
that progressive undergraduates will realize its value
as a period of orientation. With the growth of a sense
of responsibility, on the parts of technical school facul
ties, for the general well-being of their particular fields,
an added effort will be made to first sort out the men
best fitted to carry on, and then train them to do it. The
only logical means to this end is to limit entrance in
the professional colleges to graduate students —an ex
pedient which ultimately must come—(Cornell Sun.)
