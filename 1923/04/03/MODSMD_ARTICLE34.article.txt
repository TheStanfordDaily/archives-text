# Tribute to Scholarship
## 
### 
Editor, D. P. A.,
Campus.
I have repeatedly heard the assertion
that Stanford undergraduates as men
are totally lacking in finer qualities,
careless of appearances, unappreciative of
opportunities, disrespectful, often boorish,
delighting in nothing so much as "getting
the faculty's goat." The criticism has
always appealed to me as significant of
a failure to appreciate fully the situation
at Stanford, though the misjudgment is
not without sting. It is with pleasure
then, that I draw your attention to a
bit of evidence on the other side. I trust
one of your staff, with a large sense of
fitness, and the ability to grasp a live
situation, was present when the class in
History II greeted Professor Hulme on
his return at the end of last quarter from
his recent illness. As a mark of sym
pathy and true affection, followed by
rapt attention to every spoken word of
the hour lecture, the ovation from the
250 class members was a tribute to real
scholarship and teaching ability of
which any Stanford man could well be
proud.
Sincerely,
One Who Was Present.
