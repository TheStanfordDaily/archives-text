### 
The California Academy of Social
Sciences will meet at Stanford April 20
and 21 to discuss the program of work
for next year. A dinner will be given
April 20 when Chester H. Rowell will
speak on the "Need for Revision of the
California Constitution," and Senator
Herbert C. Jones will talk on the "Rev
enue System of California."
Mr. Rowell was for many years the
editor of the Fresno Republican, a mem
ber of the United States shipping board
in 1021, and until January 1 a member
of the California Railway Commission,
and is considered by Professor Victor J.
West as being an authority on the con
stitution. Senator Jones was a former
Stanford student. The two addresses
will be used as arguments for taking up
the subjects under discussion for topics
for study by the academy.
The California Academy of Social
Sciences was organized October 27, 1922,
at Berkeley to provide an agency for the
impartial investigation of public prob
lems and a forum for their free dis
cussion.
