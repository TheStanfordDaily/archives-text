ing soon on a new outdoor range. Work
has already started on the sub-caliber
indoor range. Members and others who
are interested should report for practice
on the indoor range either Monday from

done by vandals. Members of the club
are requested to call Fay at Sequoia
hall if they can help Saturday.

shooting at a range of two hundred,

rifles are furnished the members of the
club without cost by the National Rifle
Association.
