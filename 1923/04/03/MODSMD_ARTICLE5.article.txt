# "CHAPELICAN" WILL BREAK OUT STOCK OF HUMOR TOMORROW
## 
### 
"A word to the wise is a mouthful,"
some sage once said. Three dimes will
be all the money necessary to bring to
the- Quad tomorrow to buy the combined
issue of the "Chappie" and "Pellie"
which will be out then.
The cover on the "Chapelican" was
chosen In a competition between Cali
fornia and Stanford artists, which a Cal
ifornia artist won. The frontispiece,
however, will be the work of a Stanford
aesthete. The printing of the magazine is
being done on neutral territory, in San
Francisco, and the magazine will be half
again as large as the ordinary editions
of either publication. The odd pages
will be devoted to Stanford wit, and
the even to California attempts at humor.
The issue contains color work.
