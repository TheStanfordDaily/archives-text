stTusco " du r^"'e^°™:r s
The first two games were lost S3 and
5-0, but the Cardinals got accustomed
to the field and the horses by the
third game and captured it 3--.
The R. O. T. C. squad arrived hi
Tucson at midnight of Tuesday, March
20, practiced the following day, and
played the first game on Tuesday. The
other two were played the following
Saturday and Monday,
The Arizona team played an entire
ly different game from that in vogue
on the coast. It was marked by hard
riding, less teamwork and short
strokes, which made scoring easier
on the rough, dirt field which was
used. The Card squad, used to first
class, smooth turf fields, and long
stroking, found themselves at a dis
advantage.
Lyell Vanderbugh, '24, captain of
the Stanford team, was easily the
best player on either squad. Otto
Barby, '24, who had been down with
the "flu," improved in each game, and
looked especially good in the third
game of the series. Ralph Barby, '24,
substituted for Jerry Edwards, '23, in
the second game.
The trip was a financial success. The
audiences averaged about 2000, and
the University of Arizona cleared
about $1000 above expenses, which
will be used to buy equipment and
horses for their squad.
It is hoped to make a return trip to
play the Arizonans at the state fair
at Phoenix in October.
