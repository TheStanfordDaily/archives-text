# NEW REGISTRATION SYSTEM AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTONâ€”
Four thousand, seventy-seven students
registered the first day of registration
for the spring quarter. Practical elim
ination of long waiting lines or con
gestion resulted from a new system
of registration. Students were able to
register in from fifteen minutes to an
hour when the system was at its best.
The new method of giving appoint
ment numbers when the blanks are
given out obviates many of the long
lines of preceding quarters.
