# CARDINAL NINE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR CALIFORNIA SERIES
## Teams Meet Here Saturday Afternoon; Loewenstein Is Only Regular on Sick List 
### Bill Wright 
Sometime there will be a Big Meet or
a Big Game and there will be no one sick
on either side to inspire the eternal "IF."
Just at present the Stanford varsity base
ball team is set to tackle California at
Stanford Saturday afternoon at 2:30,
and A1 Loewenstein is in bed with the
"flu." He was counted on to occupy the
mound during the opening game, and his
disability will probably open the way to
Clark or Teague.
From the showing made against the
University of Southern California, the
Bears will catch Stanford at top form
and are apt to find a healthy bit of
trouble next Saturday. Comparative
scores for the early season give the
Berkeley boys a slight edge, but from
the orensive displayed against U. S. C.,
the Cards are not to be trusted to lose
any game. Patterson seems to have lo
cated a batting streak and Parker has
been in the midst of one for some time.
The rest of the team arc slightly less
spectacular, but they manage to click out
hits when hits are needed to win games.
The pitching staq will be at top form
after a week's rest and should be able
to take care of any problems the Cali
fornia team may create.
Woodward will be in his old position
at first base and will also contribute lib
erally with the stick, if his past perform
ances can be taken as a forecast. Rob
erts seems to have a mortgage on the
keystone sack and he as well knows what
to do with a bat. Mulchay has been at
short consistently for the past month,
and is usually a brilliant fielder. He
squares an error or two with stops of
the impossible variety, and somehow
manages to stage his errors when they
don't count for much. He would be a
valuable player on any college team.
Heckcndorf, at third, is a reliable
fielder and has been hitting with the best
of them lately. He and Parker are the
only left-handed hitters among the regu
lars. and are successful enough to justify
the custom.
Mai Parker will be out in - left field
snagging flies, and from time to time
will appear at the plate to make hits.
He is leading the Cardinal batsmen in
the batting averages, and is far enough
beyond the .400 mark to make one won
der how he got that way. He has fought
his way up to the regular team more or
less recently, and his hitting would prob
ably keep him there even if he couldn't
fieldâ€”but he can. He draws an un
usual number of free passes to first,
which helps to make the hits count.
Carver will be at his usual post in the
middle garden. He handles himself well
in the field, and has a disconcerting habit
of making long hits at the must oppor
tune moments.
Right field will be taken care of by
"Bus" McCandless or "Lefty" May, ac
cording to Coach Wolter's idea of the
desirability of another good batsman.
Although McCandless led the 1925 fresh
man team in batting, he has not yet hit
his stride, and May seems a bit more
consistent at the plate.
Clark and Teague will be on top for
the hurling, with Solomon in reserve.
Patterson, the old reliable, will do the
rest of the battery work.
