# BABE NINE TO PLAY BRUIN FRESHMEN AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball team
will meet the California first-year aggre
gation Saturday afternoon on the
| Berkeley field in the first of the annual
three-game series between the two teams.
The Stanford Babes have been play
j ing an average of two or three games a
, week since the start of the season and
have gradually worked into condition
| fit to give them a victory over the Berke
ley nine. Up to date, the play of the
freshmen has been rather ragged and in
consistent with one poor exhibition of
baseball followed by another exhibition
of clean, errorless ball. The week before
examinations, the yearling team won two
, games, one from Berkeley High and the
other from Willows. During vacation
J the team traveled south and after drop
j ping the first game to Dinuba, 12-1, came
i back and won from Lemoore, 19-15, and
Hanford, 13-1, in two well-pitched con
j tests. With Nevers and Ditzler both
1 going well in the box, the freshmen
I should have at least an even chance of
winning the game Saturday. One more
practice game has been scheduled for this
afternoon, and if the weather conditions
permit it will be played on the freshman
: field.
The game Saturday will be played at
Berkeley at the same time the Stanford
and California varsities are clashing on
! the varsity diamond here. Next week,
the varsity will play at Berkeley at the
same time the two first-year teams meet
here.
McEncany has been doing practically
all of the pitching for the California
babes and under the tutelage of Coach
"Nibs" Price he has been doing well,
holding the California Aggies' team to
four hits. Lloyd has been doing tin
catching.
The only point of comparison between
the two opposing teams can be gained
from the games each has played with
St. Mary's "Preps." The Stanford 1926
aggregation was defeated by the St.
Mary's outfit, 12-10, in a free-hitting,
neck-and-neck contest. The California
freshmen were beaten in the first of their
three-game series with the St. Mary's
team. -5. This makes the two contesting
| teams appear on about even terms.

The Stanford Babes have been play
j ing an average of two or three games a
, week since the start of the season and
have gradually worked into condition
| fit to give them a victory over the Berke
ley nine. Up to date, the play of the
freshmen has been rather ragged and in
consistent with one poor exhibition of
baseball followed by another exhibition
of clean, errorless ball. The week before
examinations, the yearling team won two
, games, one from Berkeley High and the
other from Willows. During vacation
J the team traveled south and after drop
j ping the first game to Dinuba, 12-1, came
i back and won from Lemoore, 19-15, and
Hanford, 13-1, in two well-pitched con
j tests. With Nevers and Ditzler both
1 going well in the box, the freshmen
I should have at least an even chance of
winning the game Saturday. One more
practice game has been scheduled for this
afternoon, and if the weather conditions
permit it will be played on the freshman
: field.
The game Saturday will be played at
Berkeley at the same time the Stanford
and California varsities are clashing on
! the varsity diamond here. Next week,
the varsity will play at Berkeley at the
same time the two first-year teams meet
here.
McEncany has been doing practically
all of the pitching for the California
babes and under the tutelage of Coach
"Nibs" Price he has been doing well,
holding the California Aggies' team to
four hits. Lloyd has been doing tin
catching.
The only point of comparison between
the two opposing teams can be gained
from the games each has played with
St. Mary's "Preps." The Stanford 1926
aggregation was defeated by the St.
Mary's outfit, 12-10, in a free-hitting,
neck-and-neck contest. The California
freshmen were beaten in the first of their
three-game series with the St. Mary's
team. -5. This makes the two contesting
| teams appear on about even terms.
