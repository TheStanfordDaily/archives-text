# Dress Rehearsal For English Club Play To Be Held Tonight
## 
### 
The first dress rehearsal of "Will
Shakespeare," the annual English Club
play, prior to the presentation Friday
night, will be held this evening in the
Assembly hall. Although Bentinck
hopes to cover all four acts of the
drama tonight, a second dress re
hearsal will follow tomorrow.
As the six principals of the piece
rehearsed extensively during the va
cation week, Bentinck, in the last few
days has devoted his time to the
coaching of the other players and to
smoothing over the rough parts of the
play.
Stage sets, costumes, and lighting
work necessary for the Assembly hall
presentation were completed today.
All technical work has been done by
Harvey Lytel, stage manager, Richard
Bentinck, Ernest Greppin, and mem
bers of the Theater Workshop and
Graphic Art class.
As the play is poetic and imagina
tive, the settings, which were designed
by the Graphic Art class in advanced
stage design, have been devised along
imaginative rather than purely real
istic lines. The details of costumes and
mountings have been chosen in ac
cordance with the Elizabethan period.
Stage construction was executed by

Harvey Lytel, stage manager, and
members of the Theater Workshop
class, which will also act as stage
crew for the first presentation of
"Will Shakespeare." A new skeleton
set, constructed here, will be used for
all four acts of the drama. A new sys
tem of doors, in accord with the latest
stage developments will be used for
the first time. The doors are inserted,
rather than hung on the new sets.
Lighting effects were devised by Er
nest Greppin and Thomas West. Rep
resentatives of the English Club have
assisted in all technical work as well
as handling the business matters for
the presentations.
The costumes for all players ar
rived from San Francisco today. Sev
eral garments were made here; all
were designed by members of the
Theater Workshop class. Careful re
search work, investigation of Eliza
bethan styles and construction was
done during the last week. The colors,
selected to harmonize with the stage
sets, are mostly pink, lemon, and
orange. Most of the costuming has
been done by Mary Hubbard, Dorothy
Pitts, Trma Gutch, Virginia Hender
son, Ruth Mc√üride, Ireno Campbell,
and Evelyn Huntington.
