Five thousand spectators saw the Stanford track team trounce the Univer
sity of Southern California squad for the second time this season by a 72-57
score on the local oval yesterday afternoon.
In spite of threatening clouds, the west side of the old track bleachers was
packed and every spectator got his money's worth. From the mile down to
the relay, there was a thrill in almost every event.
Paddock and Otto Anderson of the southern team were again high point
men. The "Speed Marvel" won both the sprints but the softness of the track
prevented him from making exceptional times. He won the century in 0:10
flat and the furlong in 0:21 3-5. Anderson took first in both hurdles and the
broad jump and placed second in the hundred yard dash.
The 440 was easily the best race of the day. "Blink" Williamson had the
pole and took the lead at the start. Although he failed to place, Coverley was
the hero of this race. Starting out fast, he succeeded in boxing the dusky
Johnson so well for the first hundred yards that the southerner was hopelessly
out of the running. Williamson kept his lead on the backstretch, closely
followed by Van Judah. Martz, the U. S. C. star, was third. As they rounded
the curve on to the home stretch Martz uncorked a wonderful sprint, passed

Van Judah, and pulled up beside Wil
liamson. They battled for the lead
but Martz jumped ahead in the last
twenty-five yards and won by less
than two feet. Van Judah, coming in
fast on the inside lane, almost beat
Williamson. An ordinary blanket
would have covered all three at the
finish. The time, 0:51 2-5, was good
in face of the condition of the track.
Next to the 440, the relay was the
best race of the meet. To the sur
prise of spectators, officials, and
pressmen, Paddock toed the marks for
the first lap against Shermund. That
first, lap was a weird one. Paddock
sprinted at the start and took the
lead, loafing on the first curve. On the
second curve on to the backstretch,
Shermund passed the "Speed King"
and maintained his advantage down
the backstretch to the curve, where
Paddock passed him. Shermund pulled
up in the homestretch and they fin
ished so close that it looked like a
dead heat from sQme places in the
bleachers. Johnson, running the sec
ond lap for U. S. C., finished two yards
ahead of Scofield and sent Hughes off
with a good lead which he kept down
to the home stretch. Van Judah passed
Hughes and gave "Blink" a one-yard
lead by staging a beautiful sprint in
