# BALDWIN DISCUSSES CHILDREN'S GROWTH
## 
### 
"Good mental development goes;
hand in hand with good physical de
velopment. The better the physical
conditions of a child, the better his,
mental growth will be," said Professor
Bird T. Baldwin in his illustrated lee- j
ture, last night in the Little Theater.
"Every child has six parallel and;
interrelated ages," said Professor Bald-1
win. "There is the chronological age
that is the best-known and the least I
important. There is the physical age
that can be measured by physical
growth, and the mental age that is'
measured by the intelligence tests.
The pedagogical, moral, and social
ages are the other three. The normal
child is one in which the six ages are
developed to a maximum (degree, and :
each age balances the other."
Professor Baldwin described some
of the work that is carried on at the
Children's Welfare Station at lowa
University to develop normal, superior
children. The hospitals, clinics, and
laboratories of the research station
are free to the citizens of the state.
The hospitals that have nurses in con-'
stant attendance are designed for spe
cial attention of babies. Every day, l
children come to the laboratories to
act as subjects of experiments. Babies
are measured once a month, on their
birthdays, to see if they are growing
properly.
Nutrition experts work for the
under-fed and ill-nourished children.
Food experiments are tried out first
on guinea pigs and white rats. If the
animals thrive on the food, it is given
to the children in the hospitals.
"By measuring a very young baby, I
can tell with a fair degree of accuracy
how tall he will be at six and sixteen,"
said Baldwin. "Long babies mean tall
adults. Length is an hereditary and
stable characteristic.
"Tall children reach adolescence
earlier than short ones. Boys are taller
than girls until they are eleven years
old. From the ages of eleven to thir
teen, girls are taller than boys. After
the thirteenth year, boys again surpass
girls in height.
"New York children are conceded to
be the smallest; the children of lowa
are the tallest; and the children of
California are the largest.
"Mental growth corresponds to
physical development. A child with
high mental age means an adult with
a high mental age. The superior child
develops into the superior adult."
Professor Baldwin used a number
of lantern slides to illustrate the work
that is carried on at the lowa Re
search Station. Some of the pictures
showed psychological tests that are
used in the laboratories.
