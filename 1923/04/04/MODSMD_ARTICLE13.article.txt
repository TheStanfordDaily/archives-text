# BALDWIN DISCUSSES CHILDREN'S GROWTH
## 
### 
"Good mental development goes;
hand in hand with good physical de
velopment. The better the physical
conditions of a child, the better his,
mental growth will be," said Professor
Bird T. Baldwin in his illustrated lee- j
ture, last night in the Little Theater.
"Every child has six parallel and;
interrelated ages," said Professor Bald-1
win. "There is the chronological age
that is the best-known and the least I
important. There is the physical age
that can be measured by physical
growth, and the mental age that is'
measured by the intelligence tests.
The pedagogical, moral, and social
ages are the other three. The normal
child is one in which the six ages are
developed to a maximum (degree, and :
each age balances the other."
Professor Baldwin described some
of the work that is carried on at the
Children's Welfare Station at lowa
University to develop normal, superior
children. The hospitals, clinics, and
laboratories of the research station
are free to the citizens of the state.
The hospitals that have nurses in con-'
stant attendance are designed for spe
cial attention of babies. Every day, l
children come to the laboratories to
act as subjects of experiments. Babies
are measured once a month, on their
birthdays, to see if they are growing
properly.
