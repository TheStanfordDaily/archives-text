# American Students to Attend Spanish College
## 
### 
Miss C. Gertrude Espinosa, instruc
tor in Spanish in the University of
Oregon, has organized a party to at
tend the College of the Pyrenees, held
under the management of the Inter-'
collegiate Tours, from July 16 to Au
gust 11 at Barcelona, Spain.
The courses in the College of the
Pyrenees will be of collegiate grade,
and all work will be carried on in the
Spanish language except in the case
of very elementary students. While
students may select as many courses
as they please, it has generally been
found that three lectures a day are!
all a student may carry with profit. f
Before making choice, students should
communicate with Senorita Marcial
Dorado, 604 West 115 th St., New York
City, giving evidence of their fitness
to pursue the courses desired.
The week end holidays will be uti
lized for excursions to nearby places
of interest. As all classes will be held |
in the morning, the afternoons will be
free for sightseeing, sports, and hikes
to the mountains or the shore.
