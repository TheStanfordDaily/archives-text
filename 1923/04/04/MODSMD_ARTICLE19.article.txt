# CHILD DEVELOPMENT
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover lias said that the welfare of its
children is the measure of a nation's civilization.
Professor Bird T. Baldwin's appearance at Stan
lord last evening is particularly timely in view of
the fact that California legislators are now consid
ering the establishment of a Child Research Station
in the state similar to the station at lowa State Uni
versity, of which Dr. Baldwin is director.
The work would be conducted under a leader
chosen by the regents of the University of California
and financed by a university appropriation of $50,-
OOt). It would include investigation along the lines
of laws of normal physical development, growth,
hygiene, eugenics, correction of defects, laws of
normal development, character building and causes
of delinquency, provisions for dissemination of this
information and training of citizens in its sig
nificance. .
Mrs. Josephine Rand Rogers, wife of Professor
Rogers of Stanford, is one of the instigators and firm
supporters of the movement, and she is urging stu
dents to write immediately to their members of the
Ways and Means Committee, which is now consider
ing the bill, in an effort to secure its adoption.
It seems only reasonable with the appropriation
â– of state prisons, reform schools and insane asylums
increasing at the rate of $1,OCX),000 a year, that some
provision should be made for systematic investiga
tion of the cause and scientific development of right
methods for normal progress among children.
If the bill passes, California will be the second
state in the Union to establish a Child Welfare Re
search Station. The support already given the
measure indicates that the efforts of those who have
I>een promoting it will be rewarded.
