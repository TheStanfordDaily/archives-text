# TIE IN INTERCLASS BASEBALL WILL BE SETTLED TOMORROW
## 
### 
The upper classcs will provide the
spring quarter baseball light tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o'clock, when juniors and
seniors meet for the final game in the
interclass league. The triple tie was re
duced to these two teams when the
juniors defeated the sophomores by a
score of 7-4 on Thursday, March 15.
Comparative scores would indicate that
the seniors will be victors tomorrow,
having already defeated the juniors, 10-4.
The standing in the interclass league
to date is as follows:
Class Played Won Lost Pet.
Seniors 4 3 1 .750
Juniors 5 4 1 .800
Sophomores 5 3 2 .600
Freshmen 4 13 .250
If the seniors capture the baseball title
they will stand a good chance of win
ning the interclass championship this
year. The points in the first four sports
run off arc as follows:
Seniors—Football 5, basketball 5, swim
ming 1, track 5. Total 16.
Juniors —Football 1, basketball 1, swim
ming 3, track 2. Total 7.
Sophomores—Football 3, basketball 3,
swimming 2, track 1. Total 9.
Freshmen — Football 2, basketball 2.
swimming 5, track 3. Total 12.
The freshmen have the cellar in base
ball, and the sophomores have the first
floor, so that the standing of neither of
these classcs will be changed to any great
extent by baseball. About the only way
the seniors can lose their numerals on the
interclass trophy is to take second place
in baseball and last in the other sports,
while the freshmen are taking first in
soccer and tennis. This would make a
total of 21 points for the seniors and 23
points for the freshmen.
