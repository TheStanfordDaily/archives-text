# IMITATION
## 
### 
A collegian is usually apparent wherever lie goes.
It is his clothes that most render him unique. And
being of a sort peculiar to university youths, the ap
parel identifies the apparelled. A bizarre block of
hat, a cut of coat, a style of shoe—any one of these,
or all, stamp the college stripling.
This must mean a high case of imitation. For all
seem to look much alike. In point of fact, as stu
dents know, there is much near-duplication in their
raiment. So that now there is established a fairly
definite criterion. With a few sporadic variations in
the minutiae of mode, college dress continues stably
similar in its parts.
So long as imitation confines itself to a purely
sartorial bent, it is pretty much innocuous, almost
wholly superficial. It is when actions and opinions
are aped that we approach the deadline. Not that
someone's good thought—like the kind of hat lie
wears —may not be taken over by us to our ad
vantage; hnt that an equal amount of our own inde-*
pendent thinking—like the creating of a hat style
more suited to onr own individuality—would more
mentally become us.
