# CABBAGES and THINGS

The usual eud-quarter battle between Honor Points
and the Honor System is over, with no undue number of
casualties and almost everybody unhappy. Anent the
enforcement of the giddy old Honor System, Cabbages
wishes to lodge a complaint against the yokel who
forgot the date of King Canute's death, in a history exe.
After sweating outrageously for half-au-hour, he looked
at his watch and immediately wrote 10:35. We admit
that we tried it an hour later, but our watch had stopped
and we slipped up on it.

I drove a golf ball into the air
It fell to earth—l knew not where
So I dropped another one dead to the pin
And won the hole when my putt rolled in.
* * •
It's a good system. Try it. It beats this arithmetical
golf to death. By the way—don't you love these golfers
who kill a snake every time thoy get In a bunker?
• * *
Too bad the water-polo team went to Chicago. They
could have held a big tournament in the Stadium about
this time.
* * •
"Java good vacation?"
"Yes, jew."
"Yes, where were yat?"
"Home where were you?"
"Home well I'll see yin jail."
"Yes ha ha slong."
"Ha ha slong."
* • •
Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee
Quarts of bottled jollity—
Haig, and Crow, and John Dewar
Martinis never make me sore
Just think—down Tia Juana way
You walk right up and roughly say—
"Snap out of it, boy, and wrap me up
A quart of Oil of Buttercup."
* * •
Oh the utter fascination of accomplishing natation
In the billows of the bounding old Pacific —
When you sport with Neptune's daughter in the green
and salty water
And put on a tan that really hurts terrific. . . .
There's a mystery and a glamor in the scandal and the
clamor
That attends the wicked town of Hollywood—
And the tourists from Nebraska, Illinois, or Athabasca
Would gladly be as wicked —if they could!

"Milt must have had a few drinks at the dance last
night."
"Why. I don't think so."
"But he was so unsteady on his feet."
"Yes, lie danced three Virginia reels in succession."

THE DAYS OF YORE
Now History. I've heard it said,
Repeats itself from time to time,
And so I hope, before I'm dead,
To see the days of Old Lang Syne,
Those days when honest gentlemen,
With feet on shining rail,
Could set 'em up again, again,
Or buy it by the pail.
And when these things have come to pass,
And we are free once more,
We'll lift 011 high the brimming glass,
As back in days of yore.
Those days, when upon the hill,
Old Haig & Haig held sway.
And not stuff from a hidden still
As we must drink today. —Brown Jug.

Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee
Quarts of bottled jollity—
Haig, and Crow, and John Dewar
Martinis never make me sore
Just think—down Tia Juana way
You walk right up and roughly say—
"Snap out of it, boy, and wrap me up
A quart of Oil of Buttercup."
* * •
Oh the utter fascination of accomplishing natation
In the billows of the bounding old Pacific —
When you sport with Neptune's daughter in the green
and salty water
And put on a tan that really hurts terrific. . . .
There's a mystery and a glamor in the scandal and the
clamor
That attends the wicked town of Hollywood—
And the tourists from Nebraska, Illinois, or Athabasca
Would gladly be as wicked —if they could!

THE DAYS OF YORE
Now History. I've heard it said,
Repeats itself from time to time,
And so I hope, before I'm dead,
To see the days of Old Lang Syne,
Those days when honest gentlemen,
With feet on shining rail,
Could set 'em up again, again,
Or buy it by the pail.
And when these things have come to pass,
And we are free once more,
We'll lift 011 high the brimming glass,
As back in days of yore.
Those days, when upon the hill,
Old Haig & Haig held sway.
And not stuff from a hidden still
As we must drink today. —Brown Jug.
The usual eud-quarter battle between Honor Points
and the Honor System is over, with no undue number of
casualties and almost everybody unhappy. Anent the
enforcement of the giddy old Honor System, Cabbages
wishes to lodge a complaint against the yokel who
forgot the date of King Canute's death, in a history exe.
After sweating outrageously for half-au-hour, he looked
at his watch and immediately wrote 10:35. We admit
that we tried it an hour later, but our watch had stopped
and we slipped up on it.

I drove a golf ball into the air
It fell to earth—l knew not where
So I dropped another one dead to the pin
And won the hole when my putt rolled in.

It's a good system. Try it. It beats this arithmetical
golf to death. By the way—don't you love these golfers
who kill a snake every time thoy get In a bunker?

Too bad the water-polo team went to Chicago. They
could have held a big tournament in the Stadium about
this time.

"Yes, where were yat?"
