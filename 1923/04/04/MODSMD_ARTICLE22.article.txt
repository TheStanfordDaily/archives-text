# The 						Women Once More
## 
### 
Of course the great difficulty is to get what one writes
read. This difficulty seems so great as to be insur
mountable in many cases, but since I saw a very
prominent person reading one of my er— (what would
you call them? Sketches is too bombastic; essays much
too literary; and articles too journalistic). Well, never
mind, I saw someone reading one. At last, said I to
myself, I have a public.
Having a public, I must confess to it that this futile
digression is simply by way of introduction to the
realization of one of my pet desires. E\er since I read
that article about the women, I have wanted to write
one myself. If sensations can be produced so cheaply,
by all means let us have them.
At the very outset I must admit that I know more
about women than most men. I say this to satisfy
those people who must find some untruth somewhere
in any article on any subject. The women, however,
always perverse, have recognized this superiority and
have given me a little name—a deep secret this —all
among themselves.
All clever people will be saying by this time that such
matters are not to be settled by throwing intellectual
brickbats at one another. Of course they are right.
Clever people are always right. Also, should I take this
excellent opportunity of starting an argument, I would
be very unfair to my public, which like all good publics
is very much indisposed to listen to an argument it
cannot break in upon. Therefore let me merely distill
some of the ideas of some of the clever people whom I
have encountered recently. This will cause anguish of
soul to no one, and the clever people will rejoice to see
what an impression they made on me.
In the first place (say they) this idea of a democracy
in a university or elsewhere is a startling absurdity,
never believed in less than by the people who espouse
it. Consider (they say) how ridiculous it is to assume
that each student is as good as each other student.
It is therefore inevitable (they say) that the best
students should elevate the nose in the presence of
those who are not best, in order to signify to what
group they belong. (This is also very good, I think: it
reminds one of a fraternity pin. is more noticeable, and
less expensive). It is also inevitable (they say) that
those who are not of the best should howl frequently,
like dogs unintentionally stepped on. This (they say)
is the emblfem of THEIR group.
When I think of all the geniuses in our midst (self
confessed and otherwise), I must say 1 agree heartily
with everything. I hope that hereafter the three women
whom I know on this campus will understand what I am
about when I elevate my nose in their presence.
