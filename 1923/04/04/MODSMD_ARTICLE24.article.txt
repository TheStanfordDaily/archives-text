# JOFFRE MEDAL FOR DEBATE APRIL 13 ARRIVES ON CAMPUS
## Stanford Team Is Chosen for Competition With Berkeley Debaters 
### 
The J off re Medal, which will be award
ed to the winner of the Joffre debate,
April 13, in the Assembly hall, with the
University of California, has been re
ceived and is now in the Presidents
office.
Stanford's team for the debate is com
posed of Thomas Bailey, '24, Matthew
Tobriner, '24, and Bertrand Comparet,
'24, with Bert Levit, '24, as alternate.
"French Foreign Policy" is the gen
eral topic from which the specific ques
tion will be selected two hours before the
debate. Professor Lutz of Stanford and
Professor Palm of the University of
California will jointly select the phase
of French foreign policy upon which the
debaters will argue.
The Joffre debate is an annual event
and the topic of the debate is always on
some subject connected with France. Ac
cording to Debating Adviser J. G. Em
erson, the Joffre debate is considered as
the biggest debate of the year, and it is
always well supported by both Stanford
and California students.
The debate is an individual, rather
than a team, contest and the medal is
awarded to the individual delivering the
best argument, rather than to the best
team. California had won the event for
a number of years until Knox Miller,
'23. won the medal last year. California
is hoping to comc back this year and they
are basing their hopes on Arthur Mur
phy, a senior at the Berkeley institution,
who took second to Miller in the debate
last year.
