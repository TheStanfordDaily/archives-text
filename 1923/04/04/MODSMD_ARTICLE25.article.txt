## 
### 
Old clothes of all kinds for the
needy students of Europe and the
Near East are now being called for by
the World Fellowship committee of
the Y. W. C. A. Dorothy Overfelt', '24,
chairman of the committee, has ar
ranged for the collection of garments
in each of the living groups tomor
row. and a truck will call for them
Friday noon. The Student Friendship
Fund of the World's Student Chris
tian Federation will then see to the
shipment of these clothes to the areas
where they are most needed.
According to a letter received from
Helen Ogden, secretary of the fund,
the students of Europe are in an
appalling situation. Those who fled
from Smyrna had only time enough to
save their lives. Clothes and belong
ings were left behind without a
thought. The students of Central Eu
rope are very little better off, for
money values have gone down, and
prices up. The price of a suit in
Austria in 1914 was CO crowns and
now it is 1.000,000 in Germany; in
German it was 60 marks and is now
40.000. Shoes in Hungary have gone
up from 16 crowns to 12,000. Salaries
have also gone up, but not in the
same proportion.
