OHIO STATE —Students in the eco
nomics department make periodical
surveys of the employment situation
in Columbus. So far this quarter more
than 10,000 people have been inter
viewed. The result so far from this
quarter's survey show that only one
out of seven men over 16 years of age
is working less than full time —an op
timistic improvement over recent pre
vious surveys.
