# REAR ADMIRAL SIMS TALKS TO STUDENTS IN FIRST ASSEMBLY
## Navy Chief Declares That Loyalty and Initiative are Needed For Success and Progress. 
### 
"Initiative, that force without which 110 man succeeds very far, and the
power to exercise initiative, comes only with a trained brain. The search for
men with initiative in war is the same as the search for initiative in civil
life. The man who has initiative and can use his brain is the man who is
wanted at all times," said Admiral Sims in his address this morning in the i
Assembly hall.
"A job turns up that needs to be accomplished. The man with initiative
does the job and anything else that will help his work along," said Sims.
"Just as initiative is essential to the successful man so is loyalty necessary
to successful organizations. Loyalty is not a personal matter and does not
depend on the personality of the boss. Your foreman may have a bad liver or |
A« ~U X i.l x * l- i -

$>a sharp tongue that makes his person
ality disagreeable. But your loyalty is
not due to the boss but to the or
ganization."
Admiral Sims declared that he had
! learned two things from his experi
ence in the navy, namely, how to
teach men and how to train them.
"It isn't sufficient to have knowl
( edge in your head. You must have the
: training to use it. It is a very simple
thing to teach a young fellow how to
use a 4-inch gun on a destroyer. He
may wonder why he is put through
the gun-drill day after day. But it is
training that takes this accomplish
ment out of his head and puts it into
the marrow of his backbone. He is |
then able to perform the drill no mat- 1
ter what the state of excitement is.
"Your instructors can teach you
| what to do, but it is up to you to train
I yourself in the use of this knowledge
j and make it count. Knowledge is of
! very little use without the brain to
apply it, and every one has to de
velop his own brain. All instructions
come to nothing unless you train your
brain."
Admiral Sims explained that the old
system of the navy used to be, "I
order. You obey." If a man interrupted
a command with the words,
"I thought ," the officer replied,
"You aren't supposed to think, you
are supposed to obey!"
After 1900 the regime that was used
in the navy was revolutionized, and
the navy began to be a navy. Every
ship had to be a team. It was then
that initiative and loyalty of the crew
was emphasized.
In closing, Admiral Sims said: "We
need people who will give honest,
single-minded devotion to our coun
try. Each young man and woman is
responsible for his or her part of
work for the future progress of our
country. The future is yours, and it
depends on the character with which
you approach the job."

then able to perform the drill no mat- 1
ter what the state of excitement is.
"Your instructors can teach you
| what to do, but it is up to you to train
I yourself in the use of this knowledge
j and make it count. Knowledge is of
! very little use without the brain to
apply it, and every one has to de
velop his own brain. All instructions
come to nothing unless you train your
brain."
Admiral Sims explained that the old
system of the navy used to be, "I
order. You obey." If a man interrupted
a command with the words,
"I thought ," the officer replied,
"You aren't supposed to think, you
are supposed to obey!"
After 1900 the regime that was used
in the navy was revolutionized, and
the navy began to be a navy. Every
ship had to be a team. It was then
that initiative and loyalty of the crew
was emphasized.
In closing, Admiral Sims said: "We
need people who will give honest,
single-minded devotion to our coun
try. Each young man and woman is
responsible for his or her part of
work for the future progress of our
country. The future is yours, and it
depends on the character with which
you approach the job."
"Initiative, that force without which 110 man succeeds very far, and the
power to exercise initiative, comes only with a trained brain. The search for
men with initiative in war is the same as the search for initiative in civil
life. The man who has initiative and can use his brain is the man who is
wanted at all times," said Admiral Sims in his address this morning in the i
Assembly hall.
"A job turns up that needs to be accomplished. The man with initiative
does the job and anything else that will help his work along," said Sims.
"Just as initiative is essential to the successful man so is loyalty necessary
to successful organizations. Loyalty is not a personal matter and does not
depend on the personality of the boss. Your foreman may have a bad liver or |
A« ~U X i.l x * l- i -

$>a sharp tongue that makes his person
ality disagreeable. But your loyalty is
not due to the boss but to the or
ganization."
Admiral Sims declared that he had
! learned two things from his experi
ence in the navy, namely, how to
teach men and how to train them.
"It isn't sufficient to have knowl
( edge in your head. You must have the
: training to use it. It is a very simple
thing to teach a young fellow how to
use a 4-inch gun on a destroyer. He
may wonder why he is put through
the gun-drill day after day. But it is
training that takes this accomplish
ment out of his head and puts it into
the marrow of his backbone. He is |
then able to perform the drill no mat- 1
ter what the state of excitement is.
