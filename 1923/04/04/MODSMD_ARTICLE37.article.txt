# OIL PAINTINGS BY A.C. HOWLAND WILL BE ON EXHIBITION
## 
### Allene Thorpe 
A group of oil paintings by A. C.
Howland, a well-known early Ameri
can painter, is being shown at the
Stanford Art Gallery.
The pictures include many scenes
in Connecticut and other New Eng
land states. Besides the early Ameri
can pictures there are several show
ing the quaint streets of old Quebec,
and a number painted in Brittany. An
interesting addition to the group is a
portrait of the artist painted in water
color by Winslow Homer.
Mr. Howland belonged to the first
group of artists who achieved distinc
tion at the Hudson River School. The
exhibition illustrates the high stand
ards in technique and draughtsman
ship achieved by the early American
painters.
The different effects of changing
lights are shown in the landscapes,
which are full of feeling and life, and
have an unusual combination of vari
ety and perfectly blended color. There
is a unity and spontaneity of expres
sion in the street scenes that is not
found in some of the landscapes. "At
Cernay la Ville" was the gift of the
artist to his daughter on her wedding
day, and shows much careful attention
to detail, so much so in fact that some
of the original spirit of the painting is
lost.
The artist's sense of humor is very
effectively portrayed in his group of
village characters and in the picture
showing the village parade. Some of
the characters are not even painted
on canvas, but on""cigar box lids.
The collection will be shown until
the middle of the month in the Stan
ford Art Gallery which is open to the
public daily from 10 until 5 o'clock.
