# BABE THIERS TO MEET ALL-PREP TEAM
## 
### 
Freshman track athletes are favored
to run up a heavy score against the j
All-San Francisco high school track j
team when they meet the preps on the I
Stanford Oval next Saturday morning ;
at 10 o'clock.,
After their victory over the All-
Oakland high school team, the fresh-j
men begin to look like a consistent
point-winning aggregation. By taking
all but two first places in this meet the
Babes proved to be an all-around team,
stronger in the track events, however,
than in the field.
First and second in the sprints
seems inevitable if Louis Gaspar and j
Miller run true to form. Gaspar is fa-;
vored to cross the tape ahead of Miller |
in the century, but it looks like a toss
up between the two Babe sprinters in
the furlong. Gaspar proved himself i
capable of 10 seconds fiat in the hun-'
dred and 22 flat in the 220 in there- j
cent Oakland meet, winning both races t
with a two-foot margin to spare.
Harold Boles looks like a certainty
for first place in both the hurdle j
events. Boles has only been beaten
once in the hurdles this season, tak
ing second place to the Modesto i
Junior College low hurdler in the first
meet of the season.
Bill Richardson has the 880 cinched
if he runs the half mile in his usual
time of under 2 minutes.
The mile is good for at least two j
places, either Bill Kerr, Clark Cypher, j
or Clifford figuring in the point col
umn.
The weight events remain shaky as I
usual, and only the lack of good ma- j
terial among the high schools gives j
Stanford the edge in the shot and
discus.
The pole vault and high jump have
been won by freshman jumpers at a
height of 10 feet 9 inches and 5 feet
7 inches respectively, both of which
altitudes would hardly place first
against stronger contestants.
