# LIBRARY HAS EDITION OF RARE OLD JOURNAL
## 
### 
The Library has acquired a 1923
edition, a Caxton Club publication, of
a rare old master, the journal of a
voyage made by Pierre de Charlevoix,
a Jesuit priest and explorer in 1720
to Canada, Louisiana, and St. Do
mingo.
Charlevoix was sent by the French
king, ostensibly to inspect North
American missions, but actually to
ascertain prospects of western ex
ploration by way of the upper Great
Lakes and regions about the northern
part of the Great River.
The journal is written in the form
of a series of letters dedicated to a
famous lady, his patroness, Duchess
of Lesdequieres. They contain descrip
tions of the geographical and natural
history of the northern countries, to
gether with accounts of customs, re
ligions, manners, and traditions of the
original inhabitants.
Although Charlevoix was not suc
cessful as an explorer, he gained a
distinct success as an author, and his
work has literary value and is an in
teresting account of two and a half
years in, at that time, unexplored
parts of North America.
