With the prospect of new uniforms and

minute toward making a success of their
informal dance, to be given next Satur

day night in the Basketball pavilion.,
The Executive Conmittee has granted
the organization a closed date for the
dance and as further induceuent the band
manager, Lowell Berry, has engaged Am
brose Whitmer and his seven-piece or
chestra to play.
"Nine o'clock has been agreed upon
by a conference of campus leaders as the
time for festivities to begin, and as there
will be only a limited number of admis
sions sold, it would de well to make the
nominal investment for a ticket long be
fore this time," is the advice of the
bandsmen.
