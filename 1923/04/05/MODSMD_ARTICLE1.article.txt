# THIRTY-SECOND BIG BASEBALL SERIES OPENS SATURDAY
## California Has Won Twenty And Stanford Ten of Past Contests; One Series Tied 
### Bill Wright, '25 
If there should happen to be a
startling reversal of weather condi
tions, the Stanford and California var
sity nines will meet on the Cardinal
diamond for their thirty-second an
nual "series," Saturday afternoon at
half past two. Although there has been
plenty of variety In the thirty-one his
torical contests which have gone be
fore, either Stanford or California has
always won, except for one tie in 1906,
and Coach Wolter thinks it probable
that there will be no devitation from
custom this year.
The first intercollegiate baseball
game between the two leading Pacific
Coast universities took place in 1892,
and for the first five years Stanford
swept every series. In 1897 California
finally made the grade, only to drop
back into second place the following
year. In 1899, however, the Bruins in
augurated a winning streak which kept
the Cards on the under side for eight
years.
In 1907 the Cards took the opening
match by a l-to-0 margin, when Wirt
made the trip on a hit, two bobbles,
and an infield out. Too many home
runs beat Stanford in the second game
by 3 to 0, but a ninth-inning rally
brought the championship to the
Farm in the third engagement. Owen
achieved a triple with two men on
base, and the deed was done.
Two barren years followed, but 1910
saw another championship nine. After
a bad early season the Cards took a
thirteen-inning game to start with, and
then dropped the second when the
pitching staff went stale. The third
game was 3 to 2 in Cal's favor in the
eighth, but Stanford made two manly
triples and a trio of one-base jolts in
the home stretch and brought the total
to 8 to 3 before the curtain fell.
