# THIRTY-SECOND BIG BASEBALL SERIES OPENS SATURDAY
## California Has Won Twenty And Stanford Ten of Past Contests; One Series Tied 
### Bill Wright, '25 
If there should happen to be a
startling reversal of weather condi
tions, the Stanford and California var
sity nines will meet on the Cardinal
diamond for their thirty-second an
nual "series," Saturday afternoon at
half past two. Although there has been
plenty of variety In the thirty-one his
torical contests which have gone be
fore, either Stanford or California has
always won, except for one tie in 1906,
and Coach Wolter thinks it probable
that there will be no devitation from
custom this year.
The first intercollegiate baseball
game between the two leading Pacific
Coast universities took place in 1892,
and for the first five years Stanford
swept every series. In 1897 California
finally made the grade, only to drop
back into second place the following
year. In 1899, however, the Bruins in
augurated a winning streak which kept
the Cards on the under side for eight
years.
In 1907 the Cards took the opening
match by a l-to-0 margin, when Wirt
made the trip on a hit, two bobbles,
and an infield out. Too many home
runs beat Stanford in the second game
by 3 to 0, but a ninth-inning rally
brought the championship to the
Farm in the third engagement. Owen
achieved a triple with two men on
base, and the deed was done.
Two barren years followed, but 1910
saw another championship nine. After
a bad early season the Cards took a
thirteen-inning game to start with, and
then dropped the second when the
pitching staff went stale. The third
game was 3 to 2 in Cal's favor in the
eighth, but Stanford made two manly
triples and a trio of one-base jolts in
the home stretch and brought the total
to 8 to 3 before the curtain fell.
1913 was marked by "Zeb" Terry
and another pennant. Two straight
games drove the Bruins off the dia
mond, and Terry, Workman, and Ma
ple spent the rest of the university
year in hiding from major league
scouts. Terry and Workman were
finally tracked down, and Terry is
still doing time in the Big Show.
This ended the Redshirt victories
for some little time. In 1918 they held
a five-game series, but the Cards got
off to a bad start when Ellison whiffed
nineteen of them in the opening game,
winning for his team by 8 to 7. Ellison
was wild in the second and Lilley's
double in the ninth beat California, 5
to 4. The third match went thirteen
innings, but a brace of Babe Ruths by
the Bears finally bumped Stanford, 3
' to 2. California then took the fourth
game and the series.
In 1919 Stanford copped in two
straight games. The California infield
was so erratic in the first contest that
Coach Evans ordered his men to bunt
in the second. Before long the com
bination again went skyward, and the
Cards had little opposition in taking
both games.
The 1920 series went to California,
two straight, and took the '21 matches
three in a row. Floyd Kallam, coach
of the 1925 Stanford freshmen, was
knocked out during the 1921 perform
ance and played a stellar game with
out knowing whether it was baseball
1 or track. George Green, ex-captain of
| the varsity for two years, pitched one
| of these games and caught the rest.
The 1922 series were conceded to
California without a prayer for the
Cards, but Stanford climbed over the
Bears in the first game by a 5-to-3
' score. The second game went extra
innings, btit California came out on
i top by one run, and the deciding en
gagement went to the Blue and Gold,
5 to 0. The total gives Stanford ten
| victories, California twenty, and one
1 tied series.

tions, the Stanford and California var
sity nines will meet on the Cardinal
diamond for their thirty-second an
nual "series," Saturday afternoon at
half past two. Although there has been
plenty of variety In the thirty-one his
torical contests which have gone be
fore, either Stanford or California has
always won, except for one tie in 1906,
and Coach Wolter thinks it probable
that there will be no devitation from
custom this year.
The first intercollegiate baseball
game between the two leading Pacific
Coast universities took place in 1892,
and for the first five years Stanford
swept every series. In 1897 California
finally made the grade, only to drop
back into second place the following
year. In 1899, however, the Bruins in
augurated a winning streak which kept
the Cards on the under side for eight
years.
In 1907 the Cards took the opening
match by a l-to-0 margin, when Wirt
made the trip on a hit, two bobbles,
and an infield out. Too many home
runs beat Stanford in the second game
by 3 to 0, but a ninth-inning rally
brought the championship to the
Farm in the third engagement. Owen
achieved a triple with two men on
base, and the deed was done.
Two barren years followed, but 1910
saw another championship nine. After
a bad early season the Cards took a
thirteen-inning game to start with, and
then dropped the second when the
pitching staff went stale. The third
game was 3 to 2 in Cal's favor in the
eighth, but Stanford made two manly
triples and a trio of one-base jolts in
the home stretch and brought the total
to 8 to 3 before the curtain fell.
1913 was marked by "Zeb" Terry
and another pennant. Two straight
games drove the Bruins off the dia
mond, and Terry, Workman, and Ma
ple spent the rest of the university
year in hiding from major league
scouts. Terry and Workman were
finally tracked down, and Terry is
still doing time in the Big Show.
This ended the Redshirt victories
for some little time. In 1918 they held
a five-game series, but the Cards got
off to a bad start when Ellison whiffed
nineteen of them in the opening game,
winning for his team by 8 to 7. Ellison
was wild in the second and Lilley's
double in the ninth beat California, 5
to 4. The third match went thirteen
innings, but a brace of Babe Ruths by
the Bears finally bumped Stanford, 3
' to 2. California then took the fourth
game and the series.
In 1919 Stanford copped in two
straight games. The California infield
was so erratic in the first contest that
Coach Evans ordered his men to bunt
in the second. Before long the com
bination again went skyward, and the
Cards had little opposition in taking
both games.
The 1920 series went to California,
two straight, and took the '21 matches
three in a row. Floyd Kallam, coach
of the 1925 Stanford freshmen, was
knocked out during the 1921 perform
ance and played a stellar game with
out knowing whether it was baseball
1 or track. George Green, ex-captain of
| the varsity for two years, pitched one
| of these games and caught the rest.
The 1922 series were conceded to
California without a prayer for the
Cards, but Stanford climbed over the
Bears in the first game by a 5-to-3
' score. The second game went extra
innings, btit California came out on
i top by one run, and the deciding en
gagement went to the Blue and Gold,
5 to 0. The total gives Stanford ten
| victories, California twenty, and one
1 tied series.
If there should happen to be a
startling reversal of weather condi
tions, the Stanford and California var
sity nines will meet on the Cardinal
