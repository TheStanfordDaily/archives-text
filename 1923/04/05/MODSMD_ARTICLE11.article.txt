# Dane's Drama To Portray Sixteenth Century Life; Final Rehearsal Tonight
## 
### 
With cast members clothed in lemon,
orange, pink and brown Elizabethan cos
tumes, the four acts of "Will Shake
speare" were given a complete review
last night. A second dress rehearsal will
take place tonight; the first performance
will be given in the Assembly Ilall to
morrow evening.
The vivid Elizabethan spirit of Dane's
drama was most expressive last night in
the third act. The situation became al
most melodramatic in places; the tense
moments are lightened by scenes of the
amusing side of sixteenth century life.
The eternal triangle, given a modern
touch by Miss Dane, works into the
climax of the piece. The scene is in a
sixteenth century tavern; the players are
Will Shakespeare, Mary Fitton and Kit
Marlowe. Mary Fitton, the "dark lady"
of Shakespeare's sonnets, is in the arms
of Kit Marlowe, friend and revival of
Shakespeare, author of the "Jew of
Malta."
A. T. Steele and Lewis Hitchcock, as
the Landlord and the Man, offer the most
amusing characterizations in the lighter
scenes of the tavern companions. A lit
tle "arm-waving," some good lines of
comedy and several rugged songs give
relief to the dramatic intensity of act
three.
London players visiting at Stratford af
ford one of tha most picturesque views
in Miss Dane's "invention." Among the
players are Hcnslowe, the trustworthy
actor and later friend of Will Shake
speare, and the Child, one of the most
alluring of the character roles. The
scene between the Child and Anne Hath
away, Shakespeare's unappreciated wife,
is one of the most artistic, beautiful
touches in the play.
