# Enrollment Record For Spring Quarter May Be Surpassed
## 
### 
Enrollment at Stanford seems likely to
pass the 2500 mark this quarter, a regis
tration which has not been reached in
any previous spring quarter in the his
tory of the University.
The enrollment now is 2380, as com
pared with 2248 at the same time last
year. The final total of registration last
spring was 2412; that is, 166 registered
after this date. One hundred and twenty
additional registrations will bring the en
rollment up to 2500 this quarter, and al
ready there are about 75 students who
have partly completed registration.
