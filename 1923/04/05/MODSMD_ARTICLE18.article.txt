# STUDENT ASSEMBLY WILL BE REVIVED
## 
### 
The Senior Control Committee will
attempt to revive the old student as
sembly sometime in the latter part of
next week when the first gathering for
the purpose of fostering student en
thusiasm for everything pertaining to
Stanford takes place in the Assembly
Hall. Similar programs will be given
throughout the quarter provided the first
assembly is a decided success, and stu
dents express enough enthusiasm to war
rant such a continuation.
Entertainment will be provided by the
senior class, and speakers will be an
nounced later. Warren Allen, university
organist, will co-operate with the Rally
Committee on the singing if any is con
ducted.
The committee especially urges the
leaders of every living group on the
campus to conduct a song-learning pro
gram from now till the date of the
California-Stanford track meet, stressing
the singing of the following: "Hail Alma
Mater," "The Cardinal Is Waving,"
"Writing on the Tombstone," Burial song
and the Hymn.
