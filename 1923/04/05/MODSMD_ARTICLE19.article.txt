## 
### 
The Encina Dining Halls will be fin
ished in approximately two more months
according to a statement by James No
bury, the superintendent in charge of the
construction at the new buildings. Al
though hindered by the recent rains, work
is progressing very rapidly since much
can be done inside the buildings. In the
great central kitchen and the service hall
the final plastering is being done, and
in about a week more will be finished.
The concrete foundation flooring has
been laid throughout the lower floor but
the flooring will not be completed until
all of the other work is done.
The five-foot facing of brown-colored
brick is completed in five of the six din
ing rooms on the south side, and in all
eight of the rooms there is the initial
layer of plaster. Much of the wooden
molding is also adjusted. The base
ment and the storerooms in back need
only a few weeks more work.
Sashes at present without glass are
ready to be hung at both the upstairs
and downstairs windows and the oak door
frames with their iron sills have been
adjusted in the doorways. Upstairs the
twenty-eight bedrooms arc nearly fin
ished. the final plastering and flooring
now being largely completed. The two
second floor wings separatee! by the
great central kitchen are wholly isolated
from tbe other parts of tbe building but
have closed stairways opening onto the
inner court of Encina. The bedrooms
will be available for the use of the em
ployees of the dining balls.
