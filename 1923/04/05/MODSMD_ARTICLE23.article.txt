# RICHARD BENTINCK WILL DIRECT CAST OF JUNIOR OPERA
## Tryouts to Start April 11, Opportunities Offered to Song and Lyric Writers 
### 
Richard C. Bentinck, dramatic
coach, has been appointed to direct
the 1924 Junior Opera, and Miss Mar
garet McGovern will have charge ot
the direction of the choruses. Miss
McGovern is director of physical edu
cation at Marker's School, and has
had a great deal of experience in
dancing.
Tryouts for the opera start on
Wednesday. April 11, and all students
are eligible to tryout except freshmen
women. Last year over 200 reported
for the first trials, and it is expected
that there will be a similar turnout
this year.
Those who wish to try out for the
choruses will be reviewed by Miss
McGovern, who is in charge of all the
chorus work, while the cast will be
selected separately by Director Ben
tinck.
Parts of a wide variety are included
in the opera as written by Hal Rorke
and Carl Shoup, and it should give
plenty of chance for all types of act
ing. There are quite a number of spe
cialty acts needed, and anyone who is
able to do anything along this line
should try out.
A number of lyrics and songs for the
opera have already been received by
the committee. Anyone desiring to
write either songs or lyrics should get
a copy of the song plot from John
Richer, chairman of the committee.
All songs and lyrics must be in the
hands of the committee by next Tues
day. The chance for new composers
of lyrics and songs is greater this
year than ever before, since many of
the old writers have either been gradu
etad or have retired from campus
song work.
