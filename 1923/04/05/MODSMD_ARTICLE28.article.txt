# THE 						WINDS OF FREEDOM
## 
### 
Upton Sinclair is out again. This time it is with a
hearty condemnation of the plutocratic control of
American universities, with some thirty pages de
voted to Stanford.
Most of his ''expose" concerns itself with the
founders, trustees, and faculty. One passage, how
ever, deals directly with the student body, and if
it bears a vestige of truth, there is opportunity for
remedy. If not, which seems more likely, Stanford
students can do much for themselves and for the
University by combatting the impression.
To quote directly:
"Stanford was founded for the purpose of giving
the young people of California a frer education; that
was the basis of its democratic spirit—but the inter
locking trustees have now decided to exclude all
those common people who cannot pay two hundred
and twenty-five dollars a year. So the tone of the
place is rapidly altering, and on my recent visit one
member of the senior class remarked to me, 'I have
seen such a change in my four years that I'm glad
I'm through.' Two years ago a group of students
wished to start a liberal club for free discussion. A
Chinese student writes me what happened, and I
quote from his letter, leaving his quaint English as
it stands, l>ecause the fine spirit of the writer shines
through it so clearly:
" 'Then we received discouraging advices from
outsiders, principally from faculty members. None
was willing to encourage us of such study. Oc
casionally individuals received discourtesy from their
society, because of being connected with this move
ment. For instance, I was dismissed from a position
soon after I was found out that I was an ardent stu
dent of Socialism. Another illustration, I was short
in finance once. Went to see the Dean of Man to ask
, for a loan from the University. Was at first refused
this request because I was reported to that office
being Socialistic in belief. Shortly after, a great ma
jority of us left Stanford on account of their gradu
ation, the movement died down gradually.'
"Now it is starting once more. I have a letter from
another student, who is going to try again, in spite of
warning from the older students that it may result in
his not getting his diploma. The motto of Stanford
used to be 'the wind of freedom blows,' but this senti
ment was expressed in German, and so a few years
ago the trustees dropped it. Of course we know that
talk alx:>ut 'freedom' nowadays is German propa
ganda, or else Bolshevik."

I'm through.' Two years ago a group of students
wished to start a liberal club for free discussion. A
Chinese student writes me what happened, and I
quote from his letter, leaving his quaint English as
it stands, l>ecause the fine spirit of the writer shines
through it so clearly:
" 'Then we received discouraging advices from
outsiders, principally from faculty members. None
was willing to encourage us of such study. Oc
casionally individuals received discourtesy from their
society, because of being connected with this move
ment. For instance, I was dismissed from a position
soon after I was found out that I was an ardent stu
dent of Socialism. Another illustration, I was short
in finance once. Went to see the Dean of Man to ask
, for a loan from the University. Was at first refused
this request because I was reported to that office
being Socialistic in belief. Shortly after, a great ma
jority of us left Stanford on account of their gradu
ation, the movement died down gradually.'
"Now it is starting once more. I have a letter from
another student, who is going to try again, in spite of
warning from the older students that it may result in
his not getting his diploma. The motto of Stanford
used to be 'the wind of freedom blows,' but this senti
ment was expressed in German, and so a few years
ago the trustees dropped it. Of course we know that
talk alx:>ut 'freedom' nowadays is German propa

Upton Sinclair is out again. This time it is with a
hearty condemnation of the plutocratic control of
American universities, with some thirty pages de
voted to Stanford.
Most of his ''expose" concerns itself with the
founders, trustees, and faculty. One passage, how
ever, deals directly with the student body, and if
it bears a vestige of truth, there is opportunity for
remedy. If not, which seems more likely, Stanford
students can do much for themselves and for the
University by combatting the impression.
To quote directly:
"Stanford was founded for the purpose of giving
the young people of California a frer education; that
was the basis of its democratic spirit—but the inter
locking trustees have now decided to exclude all
those common people who cannot pay two hundred
and twenty-five dollars a year. So the tone of the
place is rapidly altering, and on my recent visit one
member of the senior class remarked to me, 'I have
seen such a change in my four years that I'm glad
I'm through.' Two years ago a group of students
