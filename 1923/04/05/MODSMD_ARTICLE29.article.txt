# THEORY—AND PRACTICE
## 
### 
The new ruling's formulated by Pan-Hellenic gov
erning' women's rushing are indeed admirable—in
theory. But anyone who has come into touch with
the new women this year could not fail to realize how
far from admirable is the working out of the plan.
One judges everything to a great extent according
to his previous experiences; consequently, to anyono
who has survived the hectic rushing periods such as
prevailed under the old plan, an outline of Pan-
Hellcnic's present system seems nothing short of
ideal. But one's faith in the new plan begins to shake
upon realizing that the former intensively artificial
period of two weeks has been extended over a year
—somewhat diluted, it is true, but artificial none the
less. The result is a. strained attitude on all sides.
The sorority women find their effort* toward getting
acquainted with the freshmen "through the natural
intercourse of college activities" hampered by highly
unnatural restrictions. A freshman hesitates in mak
ing overtures of friendship toward women on the
Row because she does not wish them to think she is
bidding for their favor. If one still retains any faith
in the revised ruling as a panacea for rushing ills, it
would vanish upon listening for the hundredth time
to a group of freshman women discussing their re
spective chances (or the chances of their friends)
for "making" a house. It seems but cruelty to pro
long the suspense of these youthful students until
May.
The new system is a long step forward —but it
is only the first step. Its basic principle is wholly
desirable, but the spirit rather than the letter of its
laws must be observed. In some halycon future we
may hope for pledging on a sane, natural basis, free
from artificial red tape and the stressing of non
essentials.
