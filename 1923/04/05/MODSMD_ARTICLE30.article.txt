# CABBAGES and THINGS
## THE 						HANDY POCKET REFERENCE FOR ASSEMBLY SPEAKERS 
### 
(Prepared in case any student should feel the urge to
come back and address the old alma mater after a few
prosperous years in the business world.)
Form 1. (For oil magnates, movie owners, peanut
salesmen, etc.): Men and women of Stanford: I have
worked myself up from the bottom by my own boot
straps, and feel that my mistakes will help you. Always
be careful to work, and don't keep looking at the time
clock when the boss is around. If I had to say that any
one thing was the key to success, I would say that
it was initiative.. That, and nothing more, as Poe so
aptly put it. Try to treat the world on the square;
initiative is what makes the world go round.
• » *
Form 2. (For retired bond brokers, senators, and
street car conductors): Boys and girls: What I have to
say to you is something that undermines our whole
social fabric today. That is lack of initiative. If I had
any twenty years in the world's history to live in, I
would say, give me the next two years and make some
body else a present of the rest. For it is initiative
that does the work; all you have to do is the labor.
* * *
Form 3. (For charitable campaign collectors, cam
paign-und raisers, and other lucre lifters): Do you
know that 1,000,890,667 people would starve in the
world every day if they were not fed? Think of these
appalling figures, and you will realize why it is that the
initiative of the great open heart of the United States
is the saving force in the world today. If a little
newsboy asked you for a piece of bread, how many of
you here would bid him begone without pity? . (Sit
down, gentlemen, sit down!). If you haVe the initiative
to open your purse strings and let the money pour out
in a golden flood, that initiative, cast upon the waters,
will return to you a thousandfold asking for more.
Character is the great thing which everybody else ought
to strive for. You, yourselfes, should acquire the initi
ative.

Yell leader (at close of assembly): All right, gang,

Whoopee!

plainer?
Yioved: Not without being positively ugly.

aptly put it. Try to treat the world on the square;
initiative is what makes the world go round.

Form 2. (For retired bond brokers, senators, and
street car conductors): Boys and girls: What I have to
say to you is something that undermines our whole
social fabric today. That is lack of initiative. If I had
any twenty years in the world's history to live in, I
would say, give me the next two years and make some
body else a present of the rest. For it is initiative
that does the work; all you have to do is the labor.

Form 3. (For charitable campaign collectors, cam
paign-und raisers, and other lucre lifters): Do you
know that 1,000,890,667 people would starve in the
world every day if they were not fed? Think of these
appalling figures, and you will realize why it is that the
initiative of the great open heart of the United States
is the saving force in the world today. If a little
newsboy asked you for a piece of bread, how many of
you here would bid him begone without pity? . (Sit
down, gentlemen, sit down!). If you haVe the initiative
to open your purse strings and let the money pour out
in a golden flood, that initiative, cast upon the waters,
will return to you a thousandfold asking for more.
Character is the great thing which everybody else ought
to strive for. You, yourselfes, should acquire the initi
ative.

Form 1. (For oil magnates, movie owners, peanut
salesmen, etc.): Men and women of Stanford: I have
worked myself up from the bottom by my own boot
straps, and feel that my mistakes will help you. Always
be careful to work, and don't keep looking at the time
clock when the boss is around. If I had to say that any
one thing was the key to success, I would say that
it was initiative.. That, and nothing more, as Poe so
