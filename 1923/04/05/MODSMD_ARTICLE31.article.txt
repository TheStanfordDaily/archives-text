# EDUCATION AGAIN
## 
### 
A college education is generally held to make the art
of living less difficult. I can challenge that statement
in one particular at least. It adds another embarrass
ment to life; namely that arising from contact with
those who did not go to college.
Our predecessor of the nineteenth century seemed to
get away with it pretty easily. Some necromancy, un
known to us, enabled him to intimidate the unlearned
and unwashed most effectively. Was it his peg-topped
trousers? If it was we should put them on immediately,
for we stand sorely.in need of some devise; some sym
bol. Actually, the only way for the man who goes to
college now to assert his superiority to the untutored
is for him to state it in bald terms —an utterly uncon
vincing demonstration.
As a matter of fact our modern college student has
given up the attempt. He has had to because he has
been thrown 011 the defensive. He is satisfied if he is
able to justify his ever going to college at all.
.Everyone is familiar with Defense Number One. It
has even assumed an exact form, deviation from which
is-considered improper. "I go to college because of the
social contacts I get there and because I meet a higher
type of people there." Some prefer the mathematical
statement: "Three fourths (or is it 'nine tenths'.) of
what one gets out of college is the associations that one
forms there." The words are spoken with conviction and
feeling. (It is a strange and enthralling fact that the
man who has an idea is usually a little timorous about
expressing it; whereas the man who repeats an idea
does so with a singular affirmativeness which seems to
come from the depths of a firmly entrenched and well
thought-out belief.)
Many other plausible defenses have been developed.
One need not cramp oneself. Almost anything that
sounds good will do. Only one caution need be observed.
Be careful not to give the impression that one goes to
college to prepare oneself as a competent doctor or
lawyer or citizen. Neither should one intimate that
one came to college to "learn the nature of things and
their causes." It has become bad form. At any rate
it is impractical. It would never be believed.
