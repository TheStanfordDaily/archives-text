Dear Sir:
I wish to express through the columns
of The Daily appreciation of the concert
the Glee Club gave us in Pasadena last
week, and believe that it would be fitting
that you at Stanford know how we who
have left, feel about their work.
We had an audience'of over four hun
dred people, and a most enthusiastic one.
After the concert, the writer and others
on the committee, received more expres
sions of appreciation and of surprise re
garding the calibre of work presented
than we dared hope for. Without doubt,
the Glee Club of Stanford presents the
highest type of ensemble singing we have
heard, and in addition the "stuntsmen"
proved mighty entertaining.
The audience consisted of a good many
tourists from all parts of the world—
people of means and refinement—and it
is my opinion that this sort of advertising
for Stanford can do more good than
almost anything else. It reaches a great
many people better than a track meet or
a football game, and no doubt there will
be many future Stanford men and wo
men as a direct result of the Glee Club
activities.
Director Allen is certainly to be con
gratulated upon the result of his hard
work, and we will assure you, here in
Pasadena, of an even more enthusiastic
co-operation in the future concerts pres
ented hereabouts.
Very truly yours,
ROY F. REINEMAN, ex '15,
