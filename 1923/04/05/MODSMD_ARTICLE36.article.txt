# Skirts Head Dry Cleaning List For Women; Sweaters Second
## 
### Pink Raspberry 
When the California spring rains are
not pouring pitchforks, buckets of aqua,
irritating drizzles, and going through
other heathenish manifestations of their
power over Man, the promenade holds
sway. A bright and glittering array it
is, when Stanford's woman population
turns out en masse, garbed in multi-col
ored sweaters and pleated skirts in all
variety of shades.
Skirts lead the dry-cleaning list this
time of year, according to a representa
tive agency in Palo Alto. The roster in
cludes kilts of all shades. And although
the price of, their cleaning is about the
same, the actual prices of these skirts
as sold over the counter varies from the
most modest figure to one quite astound
ing.
Next in line, come sweaters. Stanford
men may have wondered what happened
to the orange, the celestial blue, or the
pink -or wool contraption So-and-So wore
yesterday or the day before. Well, it is
down in Paly getting cleaned. "This
trade in sport sweaters from the Stan
ford collegiennes, is unusually large, the
colors varying just as widely as the
sweaters' original cost. Several $40 and
$50 silk ones are sent to us every week
to be cleaned."
Street dresses come in a strong third

in this business of rejuvenation, and as
the lady over the counter informed me,
the trade in them is particularly good
this, time of year in spite of the sport
costume of pleated skirt and sweater. A
large number of dinner and formal
dresses are also cleaned every week.
"Lots of gloves are sent to us. There
is probably no great superabundance of
any one kind. There are just about as
many short as long ones.
"Several furs also come to us to be
cleaned. Inasmuch as furs are worn!
nearly the whole year round now, this
fact may not prove so very startling.
Only occasionally, do Stanford woman
send their hats. Styles change and it is;
i found to be often more practicable and
i advisable to purchase new ones."
"The dry cleaning bill for women's
I clothing far outshadows the figure for ;
men's. Men's suits are sponged and!
pressed two or three times, and on the j
fourth time up, are usually cleaned. Not:
many men's hats are blocked, nor are
there many wool shirts included in our
trade. Whether the 'semester shirt'
habit or the advent of spring have any- :
I thing to do with this, we do not know. I
