# W.A.A. Women Plan to Make Fifteen-Mile Hike
## 
### 
The first Women's Athletic Associa
tion hike of the spring quarter has
been set lor April 28. Doris Harter
will conduct the trip, to the limestone
caves near Searsville, covering about
fifteen miles. Each woman will take
her own lunch. All those wishing to
go should notify Doris Harter.
W. A. A. hikes will be planned for
at least every other Saturday during
the spring. All members of the parties
receive points towards their block "S"
sweaters. In order that such credit be
given, it is necessary that at least four
women attend the hikes and that they
walk at least five miles. Hazel Church
man is acting as hiking manager with
Doris Harter and Marion Leffingwell
as captains.
