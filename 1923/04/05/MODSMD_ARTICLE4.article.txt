# Chappie Combined With Pelican Gives Double Size Issue
## 
### 
With the task before them of making
thirty thousand impressions on a sixty
| eight page magazine, the publishers of
this month's Chaparral have kept the
composing and printing departments
working night and day for the last four
days in an effort to get out the issue
on time.
While double the size of an ordinary
issue of either publication, the "Pelican-
Chaparral" will sell at the usual price
1 of thirty cents.
