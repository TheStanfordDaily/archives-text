# STANFORD BAND WILL GIVE DANCE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Next Saturday night the basketball
pavilion will be the scene of the firs
Stanford band dance, which will last
from 9 to 12. A closed date has been
granted by the Executive Committee.
With the hope of collecting the price
of new instruments and uniforms, the
band members are bending every effort
toward making their first "hop" a suc
cess.
The dance will be informal and plenty
of refreshments are promised. Whit
mer's seven-piece orchestra has been en
gaged for the evening and numerous col
ored spotlights will be used. Tickets will
be sold at the door at $1.50 per couple.
