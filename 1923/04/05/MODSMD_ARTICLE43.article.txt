# FRANCIS V. KEESLING, '98, TALKS TO MASONIC CLUB
## 
### 
"Every student is a part in the univer
sity and it is his opportunity and duty to
participate in college activities," declared
Francis V. Keesling, '98, in his talk on
"Masonry in its Relation to the Public
Schools" at the meeting of the Masonic
Society in the Theta Xi house Wednes
day evening. "The thing the Masonic
movement is trying to do is to make
the public schools so attractive that peo
ple would rather go to them than to the
private schools." Keesling is a prominent
San Francisco attorney and is Past
Grand Master of the California Grand
Lodge of the Masons.
Fred Prince, '12, spoke on Stanford in
his time and the changes at present.
President Wilbur was not able to speak
at the meeting as originally planned as
he had to represent the University at a
banquet in San Francisco.
At the meeting, Charles W. Dickenson,
'25, was elected vice-president to fill the
vacancy caused by the absence of Don
Hughes.
John Riegle, Arand Horstmeyer, Leon
J. Benwell and Robert M. Moore were
chosen as new members and Otto Wyde-
as associate member.
