the home talent.
In the 115-pound class Stanford will
be represented by Simmons who has not
| been boxing here this year but completed
last season. The 125-pound class will be
taken care of by Earl Armbruster. This
I lad is the sensation of the year and this
| bout should prove to be one of the most
I interesting. Armbruster knocked his man
; out just before the bell in the second
I round at Los Angeles, but he later lost
the fight through a comeback on the
part of his opponent.
Jimmie Ross has left college so the
job of representing the Redshirts in the
lightweight division will be taken care
of by Giles Hall. Hall is a clever boxer
but he lacks the experience of Ross.

pound class and it is possible that there
will be two fights in the 125-pound class.
Armbruster is sure of fighting and if
Southern California sends another 125-
pound man here either Sapiro, McAllis
ter or Cannon will meet him.
Lane and Adams will both represent
Stanford in the 145-pound class. Lane
is the best of the two and his chances

second to Lane and is sure of giving the
fans some good boxing.
Harry Maloney, boxing coach, is try
ing to get Bill Burkhard, a welterweight,
to meet him in an exhibition bout.
Other exhibitions will be between
Irwin and Stoddard in the middleweight
class and Van Hook and Robinson in
