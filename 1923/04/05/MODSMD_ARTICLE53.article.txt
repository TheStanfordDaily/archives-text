# Hoover Library Learns of Losses in Ship Disaster
## 
### 
The extent of the losses to the Hoover
War Library, caused by the sinking of
the ship Matilde P,\.-rce at sea last month,
is now known through a letter recently
received from the director of the Library
for American studies in Italy.
The director wrote "This was by far
the largest shipment that we have sent
to you and it consisted of 28 large par
cels in all." The material included gifts
from the Senate, Chamber of Deputies,
Italian Society for Progress of Sciences,
the Casa Nazionale, Ministry of Finance
and other ministeries.
The Italian office of exchanges neg
lected to insure the shipment, and states
that this is its first loss in thirty years
of work.
