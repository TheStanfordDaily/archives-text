CHICAGO, April s.—Fighting against
overwhelming odds, and handicapped by
its long journey, the Stanford varsity
water polo team held the fast Illinois
Athletic Club seven to a 11-5 score to
night, in the finals for the national A. A.
U. water polo championship. The game,
which was hard-fought throughout, was
pronounced one of the best exhibitions
ever staged in the I. A. C. pool.
The Illinois Athletic Club, on the basis j
of its win qf last night from the Chicago
Athletic Association, was a heavy favor
ite over the college team. The West
erners were in no condition to withstand
the hard attack of the Eastern team.
The guarding of Captain Lacey at
guard and Collett in goal, were the out
standing features of the game. For
1. A. C., Captain Hebner and Wallen
were the shining lights, caging eight goals
between them.
The Stanford combination started out
well, caging two goals before their more
experienced opponents were able to solve
their type of play. But at this stage, the
athletic club team began a furious at
tack which gradually broke down the re
sistance of the Cardinal men. Toward
the end of the first half, the Illinois
seven began caging goals with regularity
From this point on the Easterners had
things pretty much their own way.
Tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock the
Stanford team and the Chicago Athletic-
Association will meet in order to decide
second place honors. Immediately fol
lowing the game, the Stanford team will
catch a train back to California.
