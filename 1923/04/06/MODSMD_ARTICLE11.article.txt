# BABE TRACKSTERS TO MEET ALL-STAR PREPS TOMORROW
## Results Will Offer the First Chances of Comparison With Bruin Cubs 
### 
Freshmen track squad men will clash
with a picked team of All-San Francisco
and All-Peninsula preps on the Stanford
Oval tomorrow morning at 10:30. This
is the third meet in which the babes have
entered as heavy favorites in all except
a few field events.
The meet Saturday will be the first
good check between the California babe
team and the Stanford aggregation. The
Bear yearlings defeated the bay city
lads by an overwhelming score, taking
first places in all but two or three events.
The strength of the Cards lies chiefly
in their second place men. No man on
the team is especially an all-around star
capable of first places in more than one
or two special events. Third and fourth
place men, while there are a few, are
noticeably lacking, and any recent de
vclopment of men to take these places
would make the freshmen team practi
cally unbeatable.
Bill Richardson has been running the
880 under two minutes consistently, and
if he manages to do so Saturday he is a
sure first place in the half-mile. Richard
son is also conceded a first in the 440.
Other men on the squad who will
score either first or second places will
probably be: Kerr, Cypher, milers;
Moles in both hurdle races, and as a
member of the relay team; Chase in the
440-yard dash, and the broad jump;
Bonne in the shotput and discus, closely
seconded in the latter event by Won
kowski; Thompson in the high jump, and
Caspar, Miller, and Fay in the 100 and
220 yard dashes.
