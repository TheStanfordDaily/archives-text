# WARNER WANTS HUSKIES; EXPERIENCE NO OJBECT
## 
### 
Come out for spring football, all you
big husky Stanford men! This is
"Pop" Warner's appeal.
"It does not matter whether a man
has had previous experience or not. If
he is husky and of good athletic
build, there is excellent opportunity
of making him into a lineman. Foot
ball is different from other sports
such as baseball, because no previous
experience is necessary."
Although it is pretty early in the
season to get any accurate line on
Stanford's future grid possibilities,
Warner is particularly pleased with
the number of men who have already

answered the call. "There are many
big fellows who have reported this
year and who didn't last, other than
those from last season's freshman
squad," he said. "This is gratifying,
for some of these men look pretty
good. There are lots of other men at
Stanford, however, whom I feel as
sured would make good players if they
would only make a try.
"Some fellows think that just be
cause they have had no previous ex
perience, they would be laughed at if
they should get into a suit. But there
are lots of men out right now who
haven't ever really nlaved foothall
either. Everyone who reports will be
given the same amount of attention,
and the practice will be private ex
cept for the few who may come over
to the practice field to watch from the
sidelines. Teams will be picked, but
the men will be chosen only as they
happen to come up. With teams we
will be able to work more effectively."
Practice this spring will be more
advanced than the simple rudiments
gone through last year, according to
Warner. "Several new plays which
proved successful with the Pitt team
last year, I intend to introduce this
spring. And Thornhill, Andy, and my
self will accomplish just as much as
we possibly can."
Warner said that he and Kerr also
had several plays "on paper" which
they wish to try, and they will put the
various teams through them to see
how they actually work. "Sort of ex
perimentation," he stated.
"But I would like to emphasize
again the necessity for every big Stan
ford man reporting," "Pop" declared
as he came back to his original point.
"Stanford will be able to accomplish
great things the coming year if all her
huskies will but sign up and get into
suits."

given the same amount of attention,
and the practice will be private ex
cept for the few who may come over
to the practice field to watch from the
sidelines. Teams will be picked, but
the men will be chosen only as they
happen to come up. With teams we
will be able to work more effectively."
Practice this spring will be more
advanced than the simple rudiments
gone through last year, according to
Warner. "Several new plays which
proved successful with the Pitt team
last year, I intend to introduce this
spring. And Thornhill, Andy, and my
self will accomplish just as much as
we possibly can."
Warner said that he and Kerr also
had several plays "on paper" which
they wish to try, and they will put the
various teams through them to see
how they actually work. "Sort of ex
perimentation," he stated.
"But I would like to emphasize
again the necessity for every big Stan
ford man reporting," "Pop" declared
as he came back to his original point.
"Stanford will be able to accomplish
great things the coming year if all her
huskies will but sign up and get into
suits."
Come out for spring football, all you
big husky Stanford men! This is
"Pop" Warner's appeal.
"It does not matter whether a man
has had previous experience or not. If
he is husky and of good athletic
build, there is excellent opportunity
of making him into a lineman. Foot
ball is different from other sports
such as baseball, because no previous
experience is necessary."
Although it is pretty early in the
season to get any accurate line on
Stanford's future grid possibilities,
Warner is particularly pleased with
the number of men who have already

answered the call. "There are many
big fellows who have reported this
year and who didn't last, other than
those from last season's freshman
squad," he said. "This is gratifying,
for some of these men look pretty
good. There are lots of other men at
Stanford, however, whom I feel as
sured would make good players if they
would only make a try.
"Some fellows think that just be
cause they have had no previous ex
perience, they would be laughed at if
they should get into a suit. But there
are lots of men out right now who
haven't ever really nlaved foothall
either. Everyone who reports will be
given the same amount of attention,
and the practice will be private ex
cept for the few who may come over
to the practice field to watch from the
sidelines. Teams will be picked, but
the men will be chosen only as they
happen to come up. With teams we
will be able to work more effectively."
