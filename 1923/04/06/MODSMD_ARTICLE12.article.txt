# WARNER WANTS HUSKIES; EXPERIENCE NO OJBECT

### 
Come out for spring football, all you
big husky Stanford men! This is
"Pop" Warner's appeal.
"It does not matter whether a man
has had previous experience or not. If
he is husky and of good athletic
build, there is excellent opportunity
of making him into a lineman. Foot
ball is different from other sports
such as baseball, because no previous
experience is necessary."
Although it is pretty early in the
season to get any accurate line on
Stanford's future grid possibilities,
Warner is particularly pleased with
the number of men who have already

answered the call. "There are many
big fellows who have reported this
year and who didn't last, other than
those from last season's freshman
squad," he said. "This is gratifying,
for some of these men look pretty
good. There are lots of other men at
Stanford, however, whom I feel as
sured would make good players if they
would only make a try.
"Some fellows think that just be
cause they have had no previous ex
perience, they would be laughed at if
they should get into a suit. But there
are lots of men out right now who
haven't ever really nlaved foothall
