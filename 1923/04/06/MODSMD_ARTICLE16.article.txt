# SWORD VARISITY FRESHMAN NINES GIVEN EDGE FOR FIRST CALIFORNIA CLASHES TOMORROW
## Captain, Coach Have World of Confidence 
### 
A decent day and a navigable dia
mond tomorrow are sure to bring about
a Cardinal victory in the annual Stan
ford-California baseball series, accord
ing to the expressed opinions of every
baseball mogul in and around the gym
nasium. If the old "inferiority com
plex" which seems to be the rule in
California games is to crop out in this
one, it will have to put on a burst of
speed in order to arrive before the
game is played.
Captain Peavy wrote for the Daily
last evening just about the most en
couraging statement that has come
from a Stanford captain in some time.
He said: "I can say for myself, the
coach, and every member of the team
that we KNOW we CAN'T lose the
baseball series. That may sound pretty
cocky but we are the most confident
bunch of birds that have swung a bat
on this campus for some time. Any
one of them will tell you the same
thing." He has also been heard to re
mark that the only thing that could
save California was rain.
"We expect to beat them. I think
we have a mighty good chance, and
I'd just as soon take a chance in the
mud as anywhere else," said Coach
Harry Wolter, and Graduate Manager
Fletcher contented himself with say
ing that he hoped to trim them right.
With a spirit like that among the
principals, it looks more than likely
that Coach Wolter's prophecy of a
"good series" will be fulfilled.
Of course the foundation for all this
confidence is the team —that's why
everyone is so confidant. Starting out
with a "seven-inning" club, the Cards
have plugged along until they can
carry a game beyond a dozen frames
and come Out on top and as fresh as
daisies. Coach Wolter has had good
material to build with, both from the
championship babe team of last year
and the fighting 1922 varsity, and he
has put mechanical and mental base
ball ability into every one of them to
an unusual degree. The errors of omis
sion which characterized the early
season have disappeared, and the team
thinks fast and plays clean baseball.
The University of Southern Califor
nia series affords the most recent and
valuable basis of comparison and
show the Cards to be four or five runs
better than the Bruins. This, of course,
is no more conclusive than any other
"dope superiority," but it continues
their recently revived custom of see
j ing Stanford teams go into California
j tussles with a slight margin over the
i Berkeleyites.
Stanford plunged into a batting
streak during the Easter recess which
brought the team batting average to
the extraordinary point of .298. If this
rally continues during the series there
can be but one result—and how many
of us have ever serpentined?
The time of the game, previously
announced as 2:30, has been changed
, to 3:30, and the contest will be played
jif the diamond can be negotiated
without water-wings. "Biff" Schaller,
former Seal outfielder, has been se
lected by Coach Zamloch as the Cali
fornia choice for umpire. Coach Wol
ter has not yet picked his man.

last evening just about the most en
couraging statement that has come
from a Stanford captain in some time.
He said: "I can say for myself, the
coach, and every member of the team
that we KNOW we CAN'T lose the
baseball series. That may sound pretty
cocky but we are the most confident
bunch of birds that have swung a bat
on this campus for some time. Any
one of them will tell you the same
thing." He has also been heard to re
mark that the only thing that could
save California was rain.
"We expect to beat them. I think
we have a mighty good chance, and
I'd just as soon take a chance in the
mud as anywhere else," said Coach
Harry Wolter, and Graduate Manager
Fletcher contented himself with say
ing that he hoped to trim them right.
With a spirit like that among the
principals, it looks more than likely
that Coach Wolter's prophecy of a
"good series" will be fulfilled.
Of course the foundation for all this
confidence is the team —that's why
everyone is so confidant. Starting out
with a "seven-inning" club, the Cards
have plugged along until they can
carry a game beyond a dozen frames
and come Out on top and as fresh as
daisies. Coach Wolter has had good
material to build with, both from the
championship babe team of last year
and the fighting 1922 varsity, and he
has put mechanical and mental base
ball ability into every one of them to
an unusual degree. The errors of omis
sion which characterized the early
season have disappeared, and the team
thinks fast and plays clean baseball.
The University of Southern Califor
nia series affords the most recent and
valuable basis of comparison and
show the Cards to be four or five runs
better than the Bruins. This, of course,
is no more conclusive than any other
"dope superiority," but it continues
their recently revived custom of see
j ing Stanford teams go into California
j tussles with a slight margin over the
i Berkeleyites.
Stanford plunged into a batting
streak during the Easter recess which
brought the team batting average to
the extraordinary point of .298. If this
rally continues during the series there
can be but one result—and how many
of us have ever serpentined?
The time of the game, previously
announced as 2:30, has been changed
, to 3:30, and the contest will be played
jif the diamond can be negotiated
without water-wings. "Biff" Schaller,
former Seal outfielder, has been se
lected by Coach Zamloch as the Cali
fornia choice for umpire. Coach Wol
ter has not yet picked his man.
A decent day and a navigable dia
mond tomorrow are sure to bring about
a Cardinal victory in the annual Stan
ford-California baseball series, accord
ing to the expressed opinions of every
baseball mogul in and around the gym
nasium. If the old "inferiority com
plex" which seems to be the rule in
California games is to crop out in this
one, it will have to put on a burst of
speed in order to arrive before the
game is played.
