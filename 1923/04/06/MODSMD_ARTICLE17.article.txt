A group of friends of the late Irene
Hardy, who was an assistant professor
of the Stanford English department in
the early days of the University, has
made a gift of something more than
$500 for the purpose of maintaining a
prize, to be known as the Irene Hardy
j Prize for English Verse, to be award
ed under the direction of the English
faculty.
The decision as to whether the prize
shall be $50 awarded every other year,
or $25 annually, as well as other con
ditions are left to the determination
of the English faculty. The English
faculty itself has established an an
nual prize of $25 for undergraduate
excellence in prose and in verse.

spiring teacher of English writing at
Stanford, and herself the author of
considerable verse, some of which ap
peared in book form. After her retire
ment from the faculty in 1901 she
made her home in Palo Alto and for
a number of years before her death
i was blind, maintaining, however, an
! active interest in literary production j
j and in Stanford affairs.
