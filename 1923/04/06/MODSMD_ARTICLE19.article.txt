# Babes Catch Top Form Just At Right Time
## 
### 
When the freshman baseball learn
stacks up against the California babe*
tomorrow afternoon on the varsity field
at Berkeley, it will have at least an even
chance to come through with a victory.
At no time since the start of the season
except last Saturday has the team
showed to better advantage.
The first vacation contest was played
last Thursday at Dinuba. The prep nine
took the long end of a 12-1 score and
while the freshmen hit as hard and often
as their opponents the ball always went
into the waiting hands of the Dinuba
fielders.
After the first game, the team got to
working as a whole and the result wa&
two victories, one from Lemoore by a
score of 19-5, and the other from Han
ford by a score of 13-1. The Hanford
outfit had previously defeated the Dinuba,
team, 9-5. At the close of this series of
games the pitchers were at their best
and the fielders were delivering the goods
without an error, besides hitting the pifl
all over the lot. At Leqjoore the team
collected a total of twenty-two hits and
at Hanford accumulated sixteen. Nev
ers let the strong Hanford aggregation
down with only three safeties and up to
the seventh inning held them hitless.
Although the weather has hindered
practice this week, the players have had
enough workouts to keep the kinks mil
of their arms and put them in condition
for th coming series with the California
babes. According to Coach "Husky''
Hunt, no California freshman team can
defeat them, if they play like they did
in the final two games of the vacation
tour. The first-year men have shown
their ability to hits as well as to field and
they will not have to play over their
heads Saturday to turn in a victory.
Nevers, Ditzler, or Oviatt will start
in the box for the 1926 men. Ditzler
will probably play in the outfield unless
called into the box, since his stick work
on the southern trip netted the team sev
eral runs. Meiklejohn and Lovelace will
play the other outfield positions. Kohler
will do the receiving. His arm is smc
and no bases were stolen on him in hi*
last two contests. Either Draper or
McDermont will cover the initial sack;
Smith or Ryan will play second basÂ«e.
and Lucas and Green will play shortstop
and third respectively.
The second of the Stanford-California
freshmen games will be played on the
Stanford diamond April 14 and the third
game of the series will take place at
Berkeley the following week.
