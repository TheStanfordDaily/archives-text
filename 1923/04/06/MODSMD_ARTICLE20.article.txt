# CALIFORNIA BABE NINE CHOSEN FROM WEALTH OF CAPABLE MATERIAL

(The Daily Californian) *
BERKELEY â€”The call for men to
represent the freshman class on the dia
mond at the beginning of the season was
answered by something like fifty con
testants. The fittest survived, as is the
case in all sports, and those who showed
no ability in the national pastime dropped
out. As a result, Coach "Nibs" Price has
carried a squad of about twenty men for
the last month.
Much difficulty has been encountered
by Coach Price in picking a first-string
nine, especially in the outfield, whnrc
every man has shown considerable ability.
Several good men turned out for po
sitions in the infield and there has come
to the front a combination that is hard
to beat. Price has an array of pitcher*
that has held its own against all comers.
The freshmen have defeated every
prep nine encountered this season, tastm* l :
defeat only three times and then by var
sity teams. Losing to the St. Mary's sec
ond team, 6-5, to the California second
team, and to the U. C. Dentals. Most
lof the games were won by fairly large
I scores.
