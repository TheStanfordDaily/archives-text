# A 						MEASURE OF INTELLIGENCE

Appreciation of humor is the saving grace of man
kind. That is why Hammer and Coffin members may
be given credit for engaging in a genuine worth
while activity. Their co-operation with the Uni
versity of California in issuing a combination
Chappie and Pelican follows closely upon many
hours of work spent in preparing copy for the Judge
College Wits contest. Should the Chappies win this
contest it may be taken as a tribute to the intelligence
of Stanford students, since a sense of humor is
claimed to be a fair measure of intelligence.
