At this time when such a determined effort is be
ing made to increase the population of the state of
California it is not amiss to inquire into the worth
of the proposition offered to the potential settlers of
the state. It seems nothing but good, superficially,
but it has disturbing - elements lying behind it.
Any addition to California's population must con
sist largely of farmers who will scatter over the
Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. This territory
is potentially and actually very rich, but it is at pres
ent suffering seriously for the first time from post
war deflation.
The Sacramento has splurged during the past five
years in rice production. During the first three years
everything went well; rice was priced around the
eight and nine cent mark and a single year's crop
was often known to pay for the land upon which it
was grown. The one thought was to increase rice
acreage, and to effect this great irrigation and recla
mation districts were promoted. Rice is now quoted
.around three cents and these projects are not thus
far sufficiently productive to justify their cost. As
sessments are coming due that tax the farmers' re
sources to the utmost and many of them are anxious
to escape from the situation by selling their lands.
The San Joaquin valley is in better shape, but is
also working under embarrassments. Raisins have
fallen from fifteen cents to six. The great co-oper
ative Sun-Maid Growers' Association is going
through a reorganization that promises trouble. No
great additions are being made to a water supply
that is not now too ample; the sub-surface water
level is steadily declining; and in some places large
acreages are tied up in water suits. The orange
growers are having grave difficulties in marketing
their product and have sometimes operated at a loss.
The problems that face a new farmer in California
are not insuperable, but they are many and they are
not being mentioned in the glowing prospectuses
sent to the potential immigrants to the state. The
one essential to success is ample capital, an essential
that cannot be over-emphasized. It is not cheering
to hear statements such as the one recently made by
one of the directors of a large colonizing scheme near
Chico, that in his experience it has usually taken five
settlers to make a home on a piece of new ground.
The first four work, invest their capital and finally
fail in their effort to improve the land to the point
of paying production, and it remains for the fifth,
building on the efforts of those before him, to
succeed.
The potential wealth of this state is greater than
most people realize, but it must not be forgotten that
it is to be reached only after a persistent struggle
by people capable of more than ordinary achieve
ment. To them California offers all that the real
estate agents and Californians, Inc., claim.
