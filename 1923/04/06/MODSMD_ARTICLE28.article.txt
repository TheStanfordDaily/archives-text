HE'S PERFECT
I don't think I could ever find the equal of such a
roommate as I have this year. Our relationships are
ideal. I never razz his woman, and he says nothing about
mine. "lie never comes in late, never types notes after
I am in bed, never borrows my tuxedo the night I want
to use it. He never has any of his friends in whom I
dislike, never opens my mail, never crabs about what
I do. Indeed there is 110 trouble between my roommate
and myself, but then, —he left college two months ago.

Who killed the freshman?
"I," said the Dean,
"I killed the freshman
With my little summons."
"I," said the "widow"
"With my two soft arms
And my perfect line.
I killed the freshman."
"I," said the Prof.
"I killed the freshman
With my long assignments
And with my hard marking."
(and the freshman apeparing mournfully before his dad
moaneth softly, "Yea, verily," for the combination of
these evils which threaten the innocent in our midst
must indeed prove fatal!)

She —What star is that?
