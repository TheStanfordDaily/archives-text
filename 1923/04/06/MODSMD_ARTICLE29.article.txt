McGoozle was a man of sense. McGoozle was a lawyer.
So it happened that McGoozle (no other) addressed the
lower House in defense of his Bill. After the address,
which was long, McGoozle took his thirst, which was
large, to the back room of Mrs. Bodleberry's boarding
house where his friends awaited him. This excellent
woman carried about under a vast intellect a small
figure covered with a large shawl. She dispensed beer at
a high price, and a kind of food at a low one, making a
profit on both.
Mr. Tosh sat with his feet on a chair. Mr. Burdle
sat the wrong way to on another chair. Both rose re
spectfully to greet McGoozle.
"And how do you find yourself now," inquired Tosh
darkly, as though Bill were a disease.
"Sir, I am always well, I hope," returns McGoozle,
pushing back the suds on a mug of beer with a spoon.
"And of the Bill, what?" asked Burdle, expectantly
pushing aside his empty mug.
"Your Bill!" added Tosh.
"What other Bill could there possibly be?" Burdle
indignant.
"Gentlemen," began McGoozle with a parliamentary
air, "you are aware of my integrity to my profession.
You could not expect that I would do other than tell
them. I did tell them. I told them teachers were a
nuisance; that my Bill for their censorship was the
only move to save the country from ruin.
"Teaching," resumed McGoozle, "is a business. As a
business it requires ability and training, particularly
moral training. When I think of the horrible sentiments
of Free-thinkers, the confounded bosh of unproved and
valueless theory that men with a pretty tongue and a
confirmed idea of their own sophistication are unloading
upon the innocent heads of the youth of this land, my
features become frozen with fright," to Tosh; "my blood
is quickened with anger," to Burdle; "and my heart,"
pounding his breast, "stops in my very bosom!"
With this novel explosion of physiological data, Mc-
Goozle turned to the door.
"Bodleberry," he shouted, "more beer!"
"And when," inquired Tosh, "does Mundle speak
against you."
"Mundle," replied McGoozle, "is a tooter! I shall tell
him so: he is a tooter! He will face me soon, and when
he does, I shall convict him of being a tooter!"
"Drat the creature," finished McGoozle, quite red in
the face. "Where is our beer?"
"Bodleberry," shouted Tosh and Burdle, "more beer.".
