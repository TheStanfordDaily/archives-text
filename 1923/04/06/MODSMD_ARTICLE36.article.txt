## 
### 
Yesterday afternoon a committee of
Tau Psi Epsilon of the University of
California met with a committee of
the Stanford Psychology Club for the
purpose of forming an intercollegiate
association, of which California would
be the Alpha chapter and Stanford the
Beta chapter. Those of the Stanford
Committee were Mary Eyre, presi
dent; Frank Fearing, secretary; and
Miss Helen Marshal.
The proposed association will in
clude as members, graduate and un
dergraduate students, and is the only
organization of its kind in the United
States to include both men and wo-J
men. Letters have been received from
a number of universities in the East
favoring this organization.
