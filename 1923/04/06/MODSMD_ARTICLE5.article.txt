# "WILL SHAKESPEARE" IS ENGLISH CLUB'S PRODUCTION TONIGHT
## Director Richard Bentinck Carries Title Role In Dane's Drama; Supporting Cast Strong. 
### ALLAN CHARLES, '25 
"Will Shakespeare," a modern imaginative treatment of the rather mysteri
ous life of the great Elizabethan dramatist, by Clemence Dane, author of
"A Bin of Divorcement," will be presented tonight at 8:15 in the Assembly
Hall by English Club. This is the first performance of the play in the West.
With Richard Bentinck, dramatic director, carrying the title role, and with
supporting players whose personnel is experienced and more mature than the
usual student cast, Dane's drama seems certain of being well interpreted. As
evidence by the rehearsal last night, vacation preparations, both in the acting
of the principals and in the technical stage arrangements, have given "Will
Shakespeare" the artistic finish of the best amateur dramatic offerings.
Much of the responsibility for an enthusiastic reception of "Will Shakes
peare" rests with Richard Bentinck. In the first, the second, and the third
acts, minor characters, such as the London players, the tavern brawlers, and
the other principals of the cast, will shoulder a good share of the burden, hut
the most difficult dramatic work of the piece will be in the fourth act, when

>the weaving together of the threads
of the "invention" is dependent on
Bentinck, assisted toward the end of
the act by Anne Hathoway, played by
Miriam Hilton, '25.
Anne, Will Shakespeare's wife, ac
quires from the first scene the sym
pathy of her audience. Her faithful
love for Will, her courageous accept
ance of disappointment, and her atti
tude toward her husband throughout,
gives the most beautiful characteriza
tion that Miss Dane has drawn. A dif
ficult, emotional role it is; but one
which contributes beauty, warmth,
and character strength.
A. D. Cohan, distinguished for his
acting in the play, "He Who Gets
Slapped," will take good care of Hens
lowe, the actor —one of the principals
and a likable character. Although
1 Cohan will not have opportunity for
any remarkable acting, he can give a
distinctive flavor to Shakespeare's
most faithful friend —that is, besides
his neglected wife, Anne Hathoway.
Queen Elizabeth is the characteriza
tion which is accepted as being most
i consistent with recognized history.
Kathryn McCahan, "25, who will ap
pear on the campus stage for the first
time, has fitted well into the part of
the famous queen.
Mary Fitton, the third member of
the eternal triangle which comes to
an intensely dramatic climax in the
third act, will be portrayed by Louise
Wallis. Mrs. Wallis is one of the most
experienced players in the English
Club cast, having played in stock in a
variety of character types aud having
studied dramatics in a Boston school.
Kit Marlowe, author of "Tambur
laine," "The Jew of Malto," "Dr.
Faustus," is pictured by Miss Dane as
• the love rival of Will Shakespeare.
Delmer Daves, '26, who will play in
this part, has profited by a well-round
ed dramatic experience.
Following the presentation tonight
in the Assembly hall, the English Club
| will give the drama at the Plaza Thea
ter in San Francisco on Monday eve
ning, April 9, and later at the theater
i of the State Teachers' College in San
j Jose.

"Will Shakespeare," a modern imaginative treatment of the rather mysteri
ous life of the great Elizabethan dramatist, by Clemence Dane, author of
"A Bin of Divorcement," will be presented tonight at 8:15 in the Assembly
Hall by English Club. This is the first performance of the play in the West.
With Richard Bentinck, dramatic director, carrying the title role, and with
supporting players whose personnel is experienced and more mature than the
usual student cast, Dane's drama seems certain of being well interpreted. As
evidence by the rehearsal last night, vacation preparations, both in the acting
of the principals and in the technical stage arrangements, have given "Will
Shakespeare" the artistic finish of the best amateur dramatic offerings.
Much of the responsibility for an enthusiastic reception of "Will Shakes
peare" rests with Richard Bentinck. In the first, the second, and the third
acts, minor characters, such as the London players, the tavern brawlers, and
the other principals of the cast, will shoulder a good share of the burden, hut
the most difficult dramatic work of the piece will be in the fourth act, when

>the weaving together of the threads
of the "invention" is dependent on
Bentinck, assisted toward the end of
the act by Anne Hathoway, played by
Miriam Hilton, '25.
Anne, Will Shakespeare's wife, ac
quires from the first scene the sym
pathy of her audience. Her faithful
love for Will, her courageous accept
ance of disappointment, and her atti
tude toward her husband throughout,
gives the most beautiful characteriza
tion that Miss Dane has drawn. A dif
ficult, emotional role it is; but one
which contributes beauty, warmth,
and character strength.
A. D. Cohan, distinguished for his
acting in the play, "He Who Gets
Slapped," will take good care of Hens
lowe, the actor —one of the principals
and a likable character. Although
1 Cohan will not have opportunity for
any remarkable acting, he can give a
distinctive flavor to Shakespeare's
most faithful friend —that is, besides
his neglected wife, Anne Hathoway.
Queen Elizabeth is the characteriza
tion which is accepted as being most
i consistent with recognized history.
Kathryn McCahan, "25, who will ap
pear on the campus stage for the first
time, has fitted well into the part of
the famous queen.
Mary Fitton, the third member of
the eternal triangle which comes to
an intensely dramatic climax in the
third act, will be portrayed by Louise
Wallis. Mrs. Wallis is one of the most
experienced players in the English
Club cast, having played in stock in a
variety of character types aud having
studied dramatics in a Boston school.
