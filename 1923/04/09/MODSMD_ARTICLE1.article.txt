# CARDS HAVE EDGE IN RETURN BOUTS WITH U.S.C. TEAM
## Stanford Should Win 125 and 145-Pound Bouts; Trojans Have Best Lightweight 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Harry Maloney's boxers will meet
the University of Southern California
squad in the return matches this eve
ning at 7:30 in Encina gymnasium. In
the bouts held in Los Angeles during
the spring vacation the Trojans were
given the decision in all of them, al
though the 125 and 145 pound bouts
went an extra round before the winner
could be decided. Tonight, with the
Cards in their own ring, and with
Stanford supporters in the majority, it
seems probable that the victory will
be chalked up on the Cardinal side of
the score sheet.
Due to the fact that Southern Cali
fornia has no entrant in the 158, 175,
and heavyweight classes it is probable
that these three matches will be for
feited to Stanford. In the first meet
between the two universities Stanford
had no entrant in the 115-pound class,
but Maloney is i* hopes of getting
Simmons, who boxed for Stanford
last year, to meet the Trojan bantam.
If Simmons does not fight the main
events will include matches in but
three classes, 125-pound, 135-pound,
and 145-pound. Exhibitions will also be
on the program between Stanford and
Southern California boxers in the 125
and 145 pound classes. The rest of
the card will be made up of exhibi
tions between Stanford men. Four
such fights will be on the program.
The most interesting contest for
fans will probably be between Arm
bruster of Stanford and Farlow of U.
S. C. in the 125-pound class. Armbrus
ter has a habit of making his man
take the count in the second round.
But in the spring vacation matches,
Farlow secured a decision in the extra
round.
The 145-pound fight will be between
Johnnie Lane and Seymour of the Tro-
jans. Lane lost the decision at Los
Angeles but the majority of the critics
gave him every round. Lane is a clever
fighter and one who never quits fight
ing until the match is over. He has
heen working hard to even up with
the Trojan for the decision he lost.
The lightweight match seems the
hardest one for Stanford to win. Giles
Hall. '25. has stepped into the shoes
of Jimmie Ross and will try to stop
Matties, one of the Trojan stars. Ross
lost the decision to Matties two weeks
ago, and although the latter lost a
decision to the California lightweight
last Friday evening, he has the edge
tonight. Hall is comparatively without
experience and although he has the
making of a good fighte'r it will take
some time for him to be considered as
valuable a man to the team as Ross.
The two exhibition bouts between
Stanford and Trojan leather-pushers
will be between Sapero of the Cards
and Fox of Southern California in the
125-pound class and Adams of Stan
ford and Hennessy of U. S. C. in the
145-pound class. Stanford is favored
to win both o fthese matches.
The other exhibitions will be be
tween Swing and McCallister in the
125-pound class; Penepacker and
Burkhard in the 145-pound class; Ir
win and Stoddard in the 158-pound
class; Van Hook and Robinson in the
175-pound class. All of these bouts
should be even and it is a toss-up who
will win them. McCallister is a fresh
man and new at the boxing game but
he has shown a great deal of fight in
preliminaries during the season and is
varsity material. Penepacker and
Burkhard are both clever boxers and
evenly matched, with odds favoring
Burkhard. Irwin and Stoddard fought
to a draw in the tryouts some time
ago. Van Hook and Robinson have
been fighting in different classes all
season and so little can be said of
their comparative strength.
Willie Ritchie has wired Harry Ma
loney that he will be on hand to
referee the assaults, and he will inci
dentally prove the same drawing card
that he has in the past. The judges
will be Sol Levinson and Joe Niderost,
both of San Francisco.
