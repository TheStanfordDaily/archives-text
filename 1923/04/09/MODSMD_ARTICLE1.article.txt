# CARDS HAVE EDGE IN RETURN BOUTS WITH U.S.C. TEAM
## Stanford Should Win 125 and 145-Pound Bouts; Trojans Have Best Lightweight 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Harry Maloney's boxers will meet
the University of Southern California
squad in the return matches this eve
ning at 7:30 in Encina gymnasium. In
the bouts held in Los Angeles during
the spring vacation the Trojans were
given the decision in all of them, al
though the 125 and 145 pound bouts
went an extra round before the winner
could be decided. Tonight, with the
Cards in their own ring, and with
Stanford supporters in the majority, it
seems probable that the victory will
be chalked up on the Cardinal side of
the score sheet.
Due to the fact that Southern Cali
fornia has no entrant in the 158, 175,
and heavyweight classes it is probable
that these three matches will be for
feited to Stanford. In the first meet
between the two universities Stanford
had no entrant in the 115-pound class,
but Maloney is i* hopes of getting
Simmons, who boxed for Stanford
last year, to meet the Trojan bantam.
If Simmons does not fight the main
events will include matches in but
three classes, 125-pound, 135-pound,
and 145-pound. Exhibitions will also be
on the program between Stanford and
Southern California boxers in the 125
and 145 pound classes. The rest of
the card will be made up of exhibi
tions between Stanford men. Four
such fights will be on the program.
The most interesting contest for
fans will probably be between Arm
bruster of Stanford and Farlow of U.
S. C. in the 125-pound class. Armbrus
ter has a habit of making his man
take the count in the second round.
But in the spring vacation matches,
Farlow secured a decision in the extra
round.
The 145-pound fight will be between
Johnnie Lane and Seymour of the Tro-
