# BABE TRACK TEAM SCORES WIN OVER PREP SCHOOL MEN
## Richardson Does 1 :58 3-5 in Half Mile on Soft Track; Final Score 95 1-3 to 51 1-3

Stanford's freshman track team con
tinued its winning streak last Saturday
morning when it defeated the combined
high school teams of San Francisco and
the peninsula, 951-3 to 51 1-3, on the
Stanford oval.
San Francisco schools totaled 381-3
points and the peninsula schools 13
points.
With the exception of high hurdles,
high jump, discus, and broad jump, the
freshmen took first place in every event.
Bill Richardson, recently elected cap
tain of the freshman track team, repeated
his past performance in the 880, taking
first place in the time of 1:583-5, on a
soaked track.
Richardson's time Saturday marks him
as one of the fastest half-milers that
have circled the Stanford oval. It is
doubtful if any runner will break the
tape ahead of him this year if he con
tinues to set an under-two-minute pace.
Equally fast times were made by Louis
Gaspar and Miller in the century and
220-yard dash. Gaspar won the hun
dred in 101-5 and took second to Miller
in the furlong in 0:22 4-5.
The prep track men, given the edge on
first places in the field events, won the
discus, broad jump, and high jump.
Special mention goes to Wideman of
Palo Alto High School, who won the
