# Dr. Jordan Emphasizes Place of Religion in College Life Today
## 
### 
"It is for the college man to think for
himself. ... I believe in the sacred in
tegrity of the human mind," declared
Dr. Jordan, in his talk on "Religion" to
the members of the Encina Club Sun
day evening. "The university, if it in
any way accomplishes its purpose, puts
the young man in a position to use his
brain, in a position to think."
According to Dr. Jordan, religion is
internal. "Religion is the reason why
. . . wisdom is knowing what one ought
to do next; virtue is doing it. Connected
with most religions, is superstition; that
is, believing what you know isn't true.
It is the duty of everyone to free him
self irom all forms of superstition."
Dr. Jordan spoke of the punishment
of heresy in medieval times and added:
"There is nothing in religion that calls
upon man to kill another for differing
with him—to hate or to make war.
Churches are associations for mutual
advantage." They are not absolutely
necessary to religion, but they often put
us in the proper frame of mind for true
religion, and nearly all of them stand
for good living.

In speaking of the value of conscience,
Dr. Jordan said, "The conscience cannot
always be trusted as to what to do—it
should be guided by wisdom. The con
science needs education."
"Love is of no consequence if there
is no aim in it. A character is built up
in the stream of the world," remarked
Dr. Jordan. "One may nearer attain per
fection by working for humanity than
by trying to avoid the world. Silent and
solitary contemplation is of not as great
efficacy as social service."
According to Dr. Jordan, there are
three kinds of prayer: that which at
tempest to change the environment; that
which aids one to help oneself; and that
aiding in one's consecration to duty. Dr.
Jordan declared: "I believe wholly in
the last." In closing, Dr. Jordan said:
"It is here and now that we are doing
our part in the vast plan. We should
love the ground we are standing on more
than any other spot. For us, the grass
here should be greener and the skies of
Palo Alto bluer than in any other place
in the world."
Dr. Jordan's next Encina talk will be
given on April 29.
