# VARSITY NINE LOSES OPENING CONTEST TO CALIFORNIA 10 TO 5
## Freshmen Drop Close Ball Game to California Babes by 5-0 Score; Make Only One Hit. 
### Bill Wright, ’25 
Verily, pride precedeth a flop!
Stanford went to bat in the first in
ning of the opening Stanford-California
game Saturday afternoon and came
away with a tidy four-run lead tucked
away. The bleachers and the team
settled down to watch chunk after
chunk of Bear meat disappear down
the ravenous throat of the Cardinal.
And then California sauntered away
with the game by a conclusive score
of 10 to 5.
The Cardinals did themselves any
thing but proud. The offensive was
lacking after the first big spurt, and
the defensive was only fair. Either the
pitching was wild and ineffective or
else the California batters are a race
of supermen. The slashing attack and
brilliant defense of the U. S. C. series
was absent, and the men of the Farm
showed a very small part of what they
have in them.
California, on the other hand, more
thail made up for an erratic defense
with a murderous batting assault and
the old, old Bruin characteristic of
working the "breaks" to the limit.
Out-hitting the Redshirts eleven to
five, they steam-rollered along irresist
ibly after the ice had been broken.
Lloyd Toomey, brother of the famous
"Crip," stood treat to Stanford for
four of their runs, and Kelley, who
succeeded him, handed out two bingles
and a lonely score in the remaining
eight innings.
Solomon started on the mound and
had little more success in working the
corners than Toomey had had. He is
sued an untimely number of free
passes, and in the fifth inning, with
the score tied at four each way, he
retired in favor of Milton Teague.
Teague was almost as wild, and the
Bruins were able to make every hit
count for more than one run.
"Shorty" Roberts thumped out a
clean single to center and advanced
when Parker laid one down along the
third base line. Carver walked. Mc-
Candless scorched a single through
third, scoring Roberts and taking sec
ond on the throw to the plate. Carver

With Nounan, "Nibs" Price's lone
hope in the hurling department, on a
pitching and batting rampage, the
Bruin Cubs captured the first of the
annual three-game series with the
Stanford freshmen Saturday on the
California diamond by a 5-to-0 score.
Nounan fast-balled the Card babes
to death, and let them down with a
single safe hit, striking out eleven of
Hunt's men. The Bear pitcher also
grabbed two hits for himself, one of
them a triple.
Nevers, who was on the mound for
Stanford for seven frames, retired to
the outfield in the eighth and collected
the only hit for his team when he
punched the ball to center field for a
single.
The Card infield was nervous in the
first inning and Nevers got off to a
bad start. The blond hurler struck out
Craviato, the Bruin lead-off man, but
Castignatto singled. Nevers cracked
Morse in the ribs, which shoved Cas
tignatto along to second. Brown knock
ed a pop fly which Smith, Stanford
Becond baseman, missed, and one run
tallied. Nevers crowded the bases by
walking Lloyd and a brace of singles
shoved over two more runs.
That ended the scoring until the
seventh, Nevers holding the Cubs to
one hit, while Nounan was disposing
of the Cards in one-two-three order.
A walk, a hit batter, combined with
Nounan's triple, gave the Bears one
more. With Nounan on third Craviato
crashed out a double, which ended the
scoring for the day, as Ditzler, playing
right field, got Craviato at third.
Hunt jerked Nevers, and Oviatt took
up the burden, pitching two hitless in
nings. The line-ups and summary:
