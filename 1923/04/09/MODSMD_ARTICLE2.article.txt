# English Club to Offer "Will Shakespeare" at Plaza Theater Tonight
## 
### 
"Will Shakespeare," the first play to
be taken off the campus since 1905, will
he presented tonight at the Plaza The
ater in San Francisco.
As the drama, in its showing in the
Assembly hall Friday evening, lasted
until 12:30 o'clock, the piece has been
cut considerably for the performance
this evening. Nearly one-half of the
fourth act has been eliminated and the
total time for the presentation has been
reduced about one hour.
Following the revision of the manu
script, the four acts were rehearsed in
their cut form yesterday afternoon. In
parts of the piece, such as the first act,
which dragged somewhat in the Friday
performance, efforts were made to quick
en the action.
The English Club, which has been the
organization instrumental in securing ofi
campus tours, has had success in its per
formances away from the Assembly hall.
"Antigone" was taken by the club to
Southern California in 1901, where it
played to large audiences in both Los
Angeles and Santa Barbara. Several
productions have been carried to the
University of California.
Special rates arc being granted tonight
to alumni. Special-rate tickets must be
obtained in advance through the Stan
ford Club of San Francisco. Alumni
may secure tickets selling for $1.25 for
SI; $1 tickets for 75 cents; and 75-cent
tickcts for 65 cents.
