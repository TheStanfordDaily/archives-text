# FINE-SPUN LINES MAR GOOD ACTING IN "SHAKESPEARE"
## Exceptional Acting and Good Sets Fail to Justify Dane's Play to Campus Audience 
### Henry Mack, '24 
Even the presence of three remark
able players, supported, for the most
part, by a good cast, and playing bo
fore sets and under lights which out
stripped the best that the Stanford
stage has yet seen, failed to justify
"Will Shakespeare" to the audience.
Pour and one-half hours is a long
time to sit still; that was the prevail
ing comment as the audience filed out
of the Assembly hall last Friday eve
ning, and it submerged the apprecia
tion of the play and the acting of it.
Or was there appreciation of the
play? That is doubtful; most of the
scenes were above and beyond the
audience for long periods of time.
They were super-romantic; they were
unreal in the fineness, the poesy of
expression. Clemence Dane wished to
sway her audience with the struggle
of a human being for expression; for
the most part, the struggle was on the
part of the listeners to catch the mean
ing of the fine-spun phrases.
With this as their vehicle, Richard
Bentinck, A. D. Cohan, and Louise
Wallis succeeded in reaching out over
the footlights and gripping their audi
ence in a way that is not often seen
on the college stage. One can but
speculate what the impression would
have been had the choice of play been
more fortunate.
Bentinck's Presentation Excellent
Richard Bentinck's first appearance
on the local stage shows that English
Club acted wisely in asking the
dramatic director to take the lead.
Will Shakespeare, stifled in the con
fines of his Stratford home, longing
for London, for fame, for life; Will
Shakespeare, entering triumphant into
court life and Queen's favor; Will
Shakespeare, torn between triumph
and the love of a beautiful woman,
and his duty to a dying son; Will
Shakespeare, finding his world in ash
es, which must be moistened with
tears, and again remolded into a
world; into all these moods and fan
cies of the world's greatest dramatist,
Bentinck led his audience. Complete,
understanding of the part he por
trayed raised it from the wordy thing
the dramatist had made it and turned
it into a living thing, to be pitied, and
laughed at, and scorned, in turn.
Mary Fitton Holds Audience
In Mary Fitton, as portrayed by Mrs.
Louise Wallis, the audience found
someone they could understand. Court
coquette or Juliet, sweetly smiling
maiden or angry woman; in favor, or
out of favor, and banished: no matter
the mood, Mrs. Wallis caught it, and
held it up for all to see. One was glad
that she was not banished until the
middle of the last act, and only sorry
that she could not have appeared as
one of the visions in the first.
It is seldom that one forgets the off
stage personality of a campus Thes-;
pian. But who ever could think of A. j
D. Cohan while watching Henslowe?
Who but Henslowe came to Stratford,
and took away Shakespeare? Who but
Henslowe was the dramatist's friend
throughout? If ability to sink one's
own personality into that of the paper
figure to be portrayed is the mark of
good acting then to A. D. Cohan, Rich
ard Bentinck, and Louise Wallis the
laurels are due.
But three people, though they may
save a play, cannot make it. And that
is why "Will Shakespeare" left so
much to be desired. Miriam Hilton and
Delmer Daves also deserve mention
for their work. Miss Hilton, as
Shakespeare's wife, presented her part
well. Some of the lines failed to regis
ter, however, because they lacked
volume. It is a question with Daves
whether he could give any other in
terpretation of Kit Marlowe than the
one seen last Friday nightâ€”which is
not saying that it was not a perfectly
good characterization. But one re
called Count Mancini in "He Who
Gets Slapped," and was inclined to
somewhat confuse the count and Kit
at times.
For the remainder of the cast, let it
be said that they were neither better
nor worse than the average campus
cast.
