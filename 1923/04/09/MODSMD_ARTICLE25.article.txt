# STANDARDIZATION—SYSTEM OR STUDENT?
## 
### 
Talk to an alumnus for any length of time and he
will begin to tell you the regrets of his college life.
Apparently if any college graduate were given the
opportunity to regain his undergraduate days, he
would conduct himself in a different manner. The
■extra-curricular student grieves over the lost oppor
tunity to amass facts and information. The Phi Beta
Kappa, though less often perhaps, is sorry because
he missed the contacts and the broadening influence
of engaging in student activity. Yet if any of these
repentant alumni were given that opportunity, they
would probably find themselves still dissatisfied in a
lesser degree upon their second graduation. That is
because there are so many uncontrollable elements
that enter into higher ducation. There is really no
universal, intelligent rule for conducting one's learn
ing process.
Enviable, however, is the man who begins his
freshman year with some definite object in view. It
does not matter much if that goal changes several
times and if the method of reaching it varies. At
least it has formed some sort of basis for action and
study—that is its justification. Philosophers can
bring forth ardent support for the pleasant surprises
that await him who wanders aimlessly through the
forests of learning, but youth is so likely to become
lost in the underbrush, that such a course can be
adopted only by the exceptionally daring and the
exceptionally fortunate.
There is one conscientious effort, however, which
every student can make. He can be an individual.
There is nothing new or startling to such a state
ment, but its frequent repetition has little effect upon
the mass, and students who feel that they must act
in a certain way on a certain occasion, talk in a par
ticular manner upon a particular subject.
Complaint conies from all quarters that colleges
tend too much toward standardization. Even the
critical attitude is standardized and it becomes heresy
to a certain type of mind to blame any of the faults
of education upon the student rather than the system
itself.
Student sentiment itself has demanded a thoroughly
standardized attitude from every man and woman
within the college walls, and one of the surest ways
of losing favor is to vary even slightly from that
attitude. Who will admit except to a close friend
that baseball bores him mightily or that he enjoys
•a poem occasionally? Nowhere is this insistent con
formity to type more evident than in respect to ath
letics. "Athletics," says Randolph Bourne. Princeton
graduate, who died shortly after completing a series
of. essays on "Youth and Life," "have become the
-nucleus of a perverted college sentiment. College
spirit has come to mean enthusiasm for the winning
of a game, and a college that has no football team is
supposed to have necessarily no college spirit. Pride
and loyalty to Alma Mater, the prestige of one's col
lege, one's own collegiate self-respect, get bound up
and dependent upon a winning season in athletics."
Witness the weeping alumni who are certain that
repeated defeats have wrung from Stanford men the
last vestige of the "Cardinal spirit." Some will per
haps read a line or two of this editorial and take it
as a further evidence of the terrible condition of
things on the campus. They will be wrathful and
perturbed to think that there is any support what
ever of the opinion that the entire value of a college
education does not center on the turf or the diamond.
They will overlook the possibility of the existence of
any other opinion. Stanford always has had and
always will have its ardent athletes and athletic fol
lowers. Stanford must have them, but they are really
admirable only so long as they maintain their attitude
because of personal convictions and not merely from
fear of breaking away from the type.
This is not intended to be an editorial upon the
value of athletics in the University. There have been
too many of those. It merely happens that the phase
of collegiate activity forms the most striking ex
ample of insistence upon conformity which comes
from the students themselves and not from any
pressure of the administration or educational system.
Another quotation from Bourne serves well as a
means of showing the way to l>ecomc a separate
entity.
"A critical attitude toward life is as bad a thing
for a boy as it is an indispensable thing for an cdu

£
cated man. The college tries to cultivate it grad
ually in its students, so that by the end of his four
years a man will have come simply not to take every
thing for granted, but to test and weigh and prove
ideas and institutions with which he comes in con
tact. Of course, the results are unfortunate when
this critical attitude conies with a sudden shock as
to be a mere disillusionment, the turning yellow of
a beautiful world; but it must come if a man is to
see wisely and understand. The college must teach
him to criticize without rancor, and see that his
cynicism, if that must come too, is purging and
cleansing and not bitter."
