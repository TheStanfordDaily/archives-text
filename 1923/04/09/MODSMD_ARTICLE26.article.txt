'Twas down behind the laboratory,
One afternoon this fall,
I took a card of matches
And drew it 'cross the wall,
And as the sulphurous flame arose
Prophetic in the air
I carefully applied it
Unto my first cigar.
Stretched supine on the grassy bank,
I gazed into the sky,
E'en then the purple wreathes of smoke
Were curling gracefully,
Oh, what was there at such a time
My happiness to mar?
Alas! A sudden qualm proclaimed
It was my first cigar.
I've stood upon a steamboat
And sailed across the Bay
Then leaned far o'er the quarter rail
And thrown myself away,
But I never knew a wretchedness
That could with that compare,
When down behind the laboratory,
I smoked my first cigar.
—Brunonian 1573.

"Is this a second-hand shop?"
"Yes."
"Well, I want one for my watch." —PKR.

Now listen here, PKR, we almost failed to stop that
one. All these sub-tile jokes of yours must from now
on be contributed on red stationery.—Doodle Mac Doodle.
