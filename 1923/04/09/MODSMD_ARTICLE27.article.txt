# A 						Crack at Upton
## 
### 
Riverside, California.
Dear Editor Stewart: Reading your
editoroial today on Upton Sinclair's ex
coriation of the commercial trend of the
modern college, and his particular slant
on the Stanford end of it, I agree with
you, although you do not say in it that
the man is either a liar or a fool.
During a space of several years before
coming to Stanford 1 thought of it as
the same "free" college as U. C. and
other state institutions. While there when
the tuition came on and was later raised
the need for the same was made appar
ent even to the most ignorant. The plaint
of the Chinese schoolboy quoted by Mr.
Sinclair comes very likely from one of
the young men recently in this country
and unduly influenced by one of the
schools of "modern socialism" that prey
on the minds of those not learned in our
idea of liberal education. All of the Chi
nese men I knew while in college were
of a sort that did not cater to that type,
and the lad referred to must have gotten
a wrong slant on the whole affair.
It is the unseeing radicals like Mr.
Sinclair with their revolutionary ideas
that make it so hard for really construc
tive work to be easily carried on today.
Every day Stanford men and women are
carrying the Luft der Freiheit to many
parts of the earth, and when coming
back to the Farm the "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht" on the emblems in the
houses levins to mean just as much as
it ever did. Also in spite of the tuition,
loss of fights, prohibition, and other nec
essary evils the old University daily
shows that it is getting better and better
in every way. Even the alumni will ad
mit it when you pin them down. Know
ing the Dean of Men I know that the
claim of losing a loan on account of the
Chinese lad's freedom of thought is all
bunk. The Cosmopolitan Club is as free
a place for speech and thought as you
could find anywhere.
I'm glad as an alumnus to see you
jump these famous dummies that seek to
run down our college without knowing
whereof they speak. As a daily reader
of the D. P. A. you have my felicitations.
Yours truly,
BILL EVANS, Ex-Ed.

Sinclair with their revolutionary ideas
that make it so hard for really construc
tive work to be easily carried on today.
Every day Stanford men and women are
carrying the Luft der Freiheit to many
parts of the earth, and when coming
back to the Farm the "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht" on the emblems in the
houses levins to mean just as much as
it ever did. Also in spite of the tuition,
loss of fights, prohibition, and other nec
essary evils the old University daily
shows that it is getting better and better
in every way. Even the alumni will ad
mit it when you pin them down. Know
ing the Dean of Men I know that the
claim of losing a loan on account of the
Chinese lad's freedom of thought is all
bunk. The Cosmopolitan Club is as free
a place for speech and thought as you
could find anywhere.
I'm glad as an alumnus to see you
jump these famous dummies that seek to
run down our college without knowing
whereof they speak. As a daily reader
of the D. P. A. you have my felicitations.
Yours truly,
BILL EVANS, Ex-Ed.
