# GLEE CLUB MAKES PLANS FOR SPRING ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Not following the practice of previous
years, the Stanford Glee Club intends to
continue its activities throughout the
spring quarter. It has been the custom
to allow the club activities to cease with
the annual tour during the spring vaca
tion, but this year according to Charles
IJ. Sortor, business manager of the club,
new activities are planned.
Negotiations are under way for sev
eral week-end tours during the term
which will include the principal towns
and cities in the northern part of the
state. A fixed date has already been
obtained with Mills College for a con
cert to be given on May 14.
It is planned to considerably enlarge
the repertoire of the club with several
new numbers which have just been re
ceived by Warren D. Allen director of
the club. These new songs are to be
learned and perfected this spring with
the end in view of making two big tours

j next year .instead of the one as before.
This trip will probably be made during
the winter quarter.
It is the desire of the officers and mem
bers to raise the Stanford Glee Club to
j such high standards and reputation that
| it will become an inducement to singers
and men of musical ability to enter the
! University.
The club tried out a new system of
patrons and patronesses this year which
has proven very successful. It is pat
terned after the plan used by the Har
vard Glee Club and provides for the
maintenance of a large list of perma
! nent patrons and patronesses. The merit
I of this system was amply proven by the
attendance of the Home Concert this
year which ran well over a thousand,
while last year's concert only brought
out about two hundred.
The annual election of officers will
take place Monday afternoon at 4:30 at
the regular meeting place of the club.
