# Sale of Grade Envelopes Benefits Children's Home
## 
### 
A total of $13.25 was cleared in the
sale of envelopes at the Registrar's office
last quarter for the benefit of the Stan
ford Convalescent Home.
In order to meet the demand of the
students for envelopes for the purpose
of mailing grade cards, the Registrar's
office decided to furnish a supply to he
sold at 5 cents apiece, the proceeds to be
donated to Convalescent Home funds.
This custom has now been established
as a permanent affair. The purchasing
of the envelopes is voluntary and merely
a matter of convenience for the students.
