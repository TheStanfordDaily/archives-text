# DR. JORDAN MAKES REPLY TO QUESTION "IS WAR ETERNAL"
## 
### 
"War will not be done away with un
til people get over the idea that every
time a person says a saucy thing the
whole world must come out and fight
him," said Dr. Jordan in discussing "Is
War Eternal?" at the conference held at
his home Thursday evening.
Dr. Jordan gave General Bernhardi's
reasons why war must be eternal. The
first is based on the theory that human
nature never changes; the second is his
torical, that there always have been
wars; the third is the biological doctrine
that strong countries will take possession
of small countries.
In regard to the second of the reasons,
Dr. Jordan said that war is a collective
wrong and every great collective wrong
dies at the time of its triumph.
"Human nature changes slowly, but
points of view change quickly," said Dr.
Jordan. He cited examples from history.
In reference to mob psychology, Dr.
Jordan gave warning, "Beware of the
band wagon. That doesn't mean that
the majority is always wrong. The ma
jority is not in the band wagon!"
"Students are in college so they can
learn to think straight and have joy in
doing it. The university is not a place
to teach a sound or unsound but
to teach people to think. At present the
world is only safe for rascality. Great
collective crimes cannot be done away
with until people have their eyes opened.'
