# Stanford Professor Gets Fund for Silkworm Study
## 
### 
The Carnegie Institution of Wash
ington, D. C. P has made a grant of
$500 to Professor Isabel McCracken
of the Department of Entomology at
Stanford for studies in the heredity
and variation in silk worms, especially
with regard to determining the effect
of environmental conditions upon the
cocoon and young silk worms.
Dr. McCracken began her studies
upon silk worms at Stanford as long
ago as 1900 and published several re
ports of the results of her research
work at that time as did Professor
Vernon Kellogg, who was head of the
department in those years and was
also making studies of silk worms. Dr.
McCracken continued her studies un
til the outbreak of the World War,
which interrupted them for a time.
After the war she resumed her investi
gations which have been financed so
far from University funds.
