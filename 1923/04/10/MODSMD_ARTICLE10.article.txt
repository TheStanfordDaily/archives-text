# STANFORD BOXERS MAKE CLEAN SWEEP OVER U.S.C.
## Giles Hall Scores Technical K.O.; Other Fighters Win Decisions on Points in Good Matches. 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Coach Harry Maloney's boxers made a clean sweep of the bouts held with
the University of Southern California fighters in Encina gymnasium last night.
The results were a complete reversal of the first tourney between the two
universities. Since Stanford was not represented in the 115-pound class and
the Trojans were not represented in the middle, light-heavy, and heavyweight
classes, these bouts were cancelled. Maloney announced that the Stanford
policy was not to accept bouts by forfeit. ,
The three fights on the program were in the 125-, 135-, and 145- pound classes, 1
and were won by Armbruster, Hall, and Lane, of Stanford, fighting in the

weights as named in order. All three
bouts were close and well fought.
Armbruster Wins in Third
Armbruster was awarded the deci
sion over Farlow in the featherweight
mix-up. The first round was pretty
even. Armbruster landed the first blow,
but Farlow returned with a right to
the head, and then the exchange was
about even for the rest of the round.
Armbruster was unable to jump back
from the ropes, as he usually does,
and this fact probably robbed him of a
knockout in the second round. The
second spasm was about like the first,
but it was in the third that Armbrus
ter got the advantage and won the
bout. He connected frequently and his
blows were powerful. Both fighters
missed a number of swings that would
have proved disastrous if they had
landed.
Giles Hall of Stanford scored a tech
nical knockout over Fox of Southern
California in two rounds. The Stan
ford fighter had things all his own way
from the start and Fox scarcely landed
a telling blow. Hall started out ag
gressively and rained rights and lefts
on Fox until he put him on the mat
for the count. Fox came back with
plenty of fire in the second round, but
Hall stopped every lead and landed a
few himself. Hall waited for Fox to
tire himself and then sent him to the
mat for the count with a right to the

g, â€”
; point of the chin. Hall, who is a sopho
; more, showed himself to be a good
successor of Jimmie Robs.
Johnnie Lane Wins
In the 145-pound bout, Johnnie Lane
of Stanford outpointed Seymour of the
Trojans in a three-round bout. Lane
won every go and had the best of
things throughout the fight. The first
j round started off with a clinch, in
which both pugilists landed a number
of head and body blows. Towards the
end of the round, Lane had Seymour
groggy and drove him to the ropes a
number of times. In the second, the
Stanford fighter landed a number of
wallops to Seymour's head after feint
ing with his left and connecting with
his right. Seymour put up a little of
fensive work in the last round and
made Lane take a few hard hits, but
the Stanford welter more than evened
up for these.
Good Exhibition Bout
Mattis, the Trojan lightweight and
i coach, put on an exhibition bout with
Adams of Stanford. The fight started
off well but the lights in the gym went
out before it had progressed far. This,
ended the first round. The next two
cantos were fairly even, with both
men conencting frequently. Mattis was
scheduled to fight the Stanford light
weight but because Hennessy, who
was to meet Adams, was injured last
Friday when the Trojans fought Cali
fornia, a change was made in the Tro
jan lineup.
As preliminaries to the regular
bouts three exhibitions were pyt on
by Stanford fighters. Maloney refereed
these bouts and no decisions were
given. Willie Richie, former -light
weight champion of the world, offici
ated over the other bouts.
The three preliminaries were be
tween Irwin and Stoddard in the mid
dleweight class; Swing and McAllister
in the featherweight, and Robinson
and Van Hook in the light-heavyweight
class. These fights were even and
neither fighter had much of an advan
tage over his opponent.
The bouts last night will practically
end the boxing season at Stanford this
year. Some of the men will take part
in exhibition fights next Friday night
at the American Legion benefit.
