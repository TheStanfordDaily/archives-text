# LONDON QUARTET TO BE HEARD AT LAST PENINSULA CONCERT
## 
### 
For the second time in two years,
Stanford will hear the London String
Quartet in a concert —the last of the
Peninsula series—Thursday evening in
the Assembly hall at 8 o'clock.
Arthur Beckwith, first violin, is the
leader on this present tour, which will
take the artists to Honolulu in a few
days. The other members of the quartet
are Thomas VV. Petre. second violin; H.
Waldo Warner, viola; and C. Warwick-
Evans, violincello.
This famous English organization won
high praise from New York musical
critics in their Eastern concerts, where
the artists played to sold-out houses.
During their latest tour, which is the
third visit to the United States, the quar
tet played in all the large cities from
coast to coast.
Although the program for Thursday
is not yet announced, "Pixy Ring," a
fairy suite written by Mr. Warner of
the quartet, will probably be included.
