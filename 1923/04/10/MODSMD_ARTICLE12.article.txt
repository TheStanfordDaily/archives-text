###

had been cut down and re-rehearsed, was
three-quarters of an hour shorter than
the performance in the Assembly hall
Friday evening.
In a review of the presentation last
night the San Francisco Examiner says,
"A good performance was given by the
Stanford players, and it was of particu
lar importance because there is likely to
j be no other opportunity to see this play,
j in which the author's emotional experi-
I ences as suggested has striven to express
Shakespeare's in the lines of some of
his sonnets."
' The English Club will take "Will
Shakespeare" to San Jose, where it will
be presented at the theater of the State
Teachers' College on the night of April
21.
