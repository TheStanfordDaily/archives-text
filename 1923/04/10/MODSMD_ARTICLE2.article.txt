# JOFFRE MEDAL WILL BE EXHIBITED IN STANFORD LIBRARY
## 
### 
The Joffre Medal to be awarded the
winner in the annual Joffre debate
with California in the Assembly hall
Friday night will be on exhibition in
the Stanford Library until Thursday
evening. It will be placed in the up
right glass case to the left at the top
of the main stairway in order that
everyone may see it before it is
awarded.
Stanford's representatives in the
Joffre contest will be: Bertrand Com
paret, '24, Mathew Tobriner, '24, and
Thomas Bailey, '24.
The general topic as announced last
December is "The French Foreign
Policy on the Continent of Europe
since the Treaty of Versailles." Two
hours before the debate begins, the
specific phase of the general question
will be announced to the rival teams.
During the twenty-nine years that
Stanford and California debaters have
argued on some aspect of French his
tory, government, or politics, this de
bate has gained a reputation of being
the greatest of Pacific Coast forensic
contests.
