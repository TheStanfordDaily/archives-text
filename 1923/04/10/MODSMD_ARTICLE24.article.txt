# "NOT NOW FEASIBLE"
## 
### 
After sonic investigation of its working in other
universities, the Executive Committee has decided
that the adoption of the point system in regulating
activity is "not now feasible," but instead is arrang
ing a card catalogue containing the extra-curricular
records of men and women at Stanford, with the
more or less vague purpose of quietly restraining any
one man from gaining the lion's share of honorary
sweetmeats.
The question arises: If the point system is not now
feasible, when will it be?
The real merit in an arrangement which prevents
any one person from engaging in more than a limited
amount of student enterprise is the protection it af
fords to the man upon whom work is thrust against
his will, and the check it furnishes to the gratification
of that "mania for being obvious" among those
whose interest lies more in the length of the senior
record in the Quad than in the performance of a
good piece of work.
The examples of men who have engaged satis
factorily in varying lines of endeavor and have still
kept sight of their real purpose in coming to college
•are plentiful, however, and some of us would not
readily see the activity and Stanford suffer from the
limiting of their work and delegating portions of it
to those of lesser ability and enthusiasm. There is
the further possibility that the time now taken on the
athletic field, behind the scenes, in the newspaper
office, at committee meetings, would be wasted rather
than devoted to the remaining interests of the man
whose limit had been reached.
Reports from other universities indicate that better
work and better students are the results of such a
system. The size of the Stanford student body makes
it impossible to judge on that basis what the effect
would be here. Experimentation seems to be the
only means of determining, and as in all experiments
some sacrifices will be necessary.
) It is evident that the "card-catalogue system"
-which has been adopted as a substitute will never be
very effective one way or the other. Why is the
point system less feasible today than at any time in
the future?
