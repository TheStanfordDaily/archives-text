# COME JOIN THE BAND
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning- the first student assembly of
the quarter will l>e held. Whether there will be oth
ers iti the future depends upon the response which
students give this meeting.
No one can deny that the manner in which Stan
ford has sung at recent rallies has been miserable.
Even the words and music to "Come Join the Band"
seem unfamiliar to the great majority and those who
have ventured into song have done it in anything
but a spirit of spontaneity.
Opportunity to learn and practice the songs will
be provided at tomorrow morning's assembly. If we
are going to sing at contests in the future, for the
love of Chopin and Beethoven and all the rest, let's
make it approach musicâ€”or else let's not try at all.
There is another advantage in attending the as
sembly. A favorite fireside pastime is grumbling be
cause students are not given an opportunity to learn
what is l>eing done by the Administration. Comp
troller Roth will explain some aspects of the hous
ing situation, and any grumbler who is sincere in his
desire to get at facts will forego the opportunity for
an extra hour's sleep, which is what a nine o'clock
assembly means to a good many.
