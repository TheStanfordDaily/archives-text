THE HIGHER LIFE

Th steeplejack Augustus Quirk to fame was quite
unknown, till he slipped from the Baptist Kirk and
never smashed a bone. For years on end he swung
aloft on chimney, spire, and spout; he polished up each
weathered croft and straightened wrinkles out. Although
he hung suspended for hours in the air, he never was
attended by more than vacant stare, until last week a
weakened truss gave way some two miles high, and
thus precipitated Gus into the Public Eye.
When passers scurried to the spot and cried with loud
alases, "Are you alive or are you not?" he said, "I've
smashed my glasses. Otherwise, I'm right as rain,
though it was quite a shock. Now I must climb up
there again and shine the weather-cock."
But our Augustus never went to finish steeple-jacking;
for he became a News Event, and fame was now not
lacking. The papers hailed him "Ironside" and "Wonder
of the Ages;" his picture crowded King Tut
from all front pages. They drew him "sound in wind and
limb" in all the comic sections. A myriad poets solemn
sent him copies of their rhymes; he ran a double-column
in the Palo Alto Times.
"When I was steeple-shining to win a weekly wage, I
caused 110 penny-lining, nor graced a newsy page," said
Gus to me today. However, now I think a bit, the guys
who do the work are never noticed till they quit."
—MALT RAISIN.
* * *
I love to have it rain—l cheer
When each wet rain-drop drops;
I love to have it rain because
It doesn't rain when it stops.
* • *
Here's to the girl
That is mine, all mine.
She drinks, and
She smokes,
And she bets and
She rides
111 autos.
And she sometimes goes out
And forgets that
She's mine, all mine.
—O. PEEL.
* * *
ODE TO A FRUIT SALAD
(Written, at the request of the headwaiter, some place
else).
'Twas springtime, and the birds did sport;
Tell, me sailor, where's the port?
The answer came back, short and sweet:
"■A dollar fifty, with receipt."
So this is Gladys? Howdedo.
I hear there's salmon in the slough.
The coach in golf just shot his tee;
Gee whiz! What fools these mortals be.
Thanks, 110, I do not care for giblet.
The verse was unheroic couplet.
I never SAW a purple cow,
Come Harold, give the girls a bow.
Man is naught but pulsing dust,
How's for another little bust?
The carp that once hit Tara's falls,
And landed 011 its head,
Has hung six weeks 011 Tara's walls;
To be polite—it's dead.
I really thing the timer's bust.
My God! This pie has got a crust!
Should auld acquaintance be forgot?
Shut up! Who's opening this pot?
—LAUNCELOT LUMP.

of the Ages;" his picture crowded King Tut
from all front pages. They drew him "sound in wind and

in the Palo Alto Times.

I love to have it rain—l cheer
When each wet rain-drop drops;
I love to have it rain because
It doesn't rain when it stops.

Here's to the girl
That is mine, all mine.
She drinks, and
She smokes,
And she bets and
She rides
111 autos.
And she sometimes goes out
And forgets that
She's mine, all mine.

ODE TO A FRUIT SALAD
(Written, at the request of the headwaiter, some place
else).
'Twas springtime, and the birds did sport;
Tell, me sailor, where's the port?
The answer came back, short and sweet:
"■A dollar fifty, with receipt."
So this is Gladys? Howdedo.
I hear there's salmon in the slough.
The coach in golf just shot his tee;
Gee whiz! What fools these mortals be.
Thanks, 110, I do not care for giblet.
The verse was unheroic couplet.
I never SAW a purple cow,
Come Harold, give the girls a bow.
Man is naught but pulsing dust,
How's for another little bust?
The carp that once hit Tara's falls,
And landed 011 its head,
Has hung six weeks 011 Tara's walls;
To be polite—it's dead.
I really thing the timer's bust.
My God! This pie has got a crust!
Should auld acquaintance be forgot?
Shut up! Who's opening this pot?
—LAUNCELOT LUMP.
THE HIGHER LIFE

Th steeplejack Augustus Quirk to fame was quite
unknown, till he slipped from the Baptist Kirk and
never smashed a bone. For years on end he swung
aloft on chimney, spire, and spout; he polished up each
weathered croft and straightened wrinkles out. Although
he hung suspended for hours in the air, he never was
attended by more than vacant stare, until last week a
weakened truss gave way some two miles high, and
thus precipitated Gus into the Public Eye.
When passers scurried to the spot and cried with loud
alases, "Are you alive or are you not?" he said, "I've
smashed my glasses. Otherwise, I'm right as rain,
though it was quite a shock. Now I must climb up
there again and shine the weather-cock."
But our Augustus never went to finish steeple-jacking;
for he became a News Event, and fame was now not
lacking. The papers hailed him "Ironside" and "Wonder
of the Ages;" his picture crowded King Tut
from all front pages. They drew him "sound in wind and
limb" in all the comic sections. A myriad poets solemn
sent him copies of their rhymes; he ran a double-column
