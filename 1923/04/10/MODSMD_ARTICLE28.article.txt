"To know McGoozle, is to convict him," went on
Mundle, who had been talking to his friends Burdle and
Tosh in the retiring room of the lower House, about the
Bill, "of being a "Victorian." His bulging forehead
glistened, and his drooping shoulders straightened as he
drew back from the table to expand with the magnifi
cence of this discovery.
Burdle was thin; Tosh was thinner.
"How true," interposed Tosh, anticipating Burdle.
Mundle, who believed everybody not of consequence
should be ignored, ignored Tosh.
"The issues of this case," went on Mundle calmly
(Mundle was always calm, heavily calm like unrefined
oil), "are broader than McGoozle."
McGoozle was a plump gentleman; so Burdle replied
immediately, "Certainly."
"They are so broad," continued Mundle insensible of
interruption, "that 1 am just beginning to see how broad
they are." Hands deep in pockets signified the depth of
this remark.
"Those who are not aware of the modern advance
ments made in psychology and education cannot be ex
pected to understand them." Mundle looked suspiciously
at Tosh, who looked suspiciously at Burdle, who looked
at the floor. Mundle warmed to the subject.
"Modern psychology has unearthed the fact that
young men are mental mechanisms fully capable of di
gesting any idea fed to them. Modern education has
taken unto itself the duty of feeding ideas systematically
to the young.
"Now an idea, by itself, is neither moral nor .im
moral; it is simply an idea, and as an idea must be
tested. It can be tested properly only by the young
mind, because the young mind is the only mind without
bias, without ideas of its own.
"To insist that youth shall be taught only what has
passed the moral censorship of the aged is to limit
progress, cripple intelligence, and restrain civilization.
Youth must be taught everything, for the more it knows
the more it will produce."
"Therefore," said Mundle, as a final logical step,
"McGoozle is not only a Victorian, but an ignoramus,
and a humbug."
Tosh and Burdle were about to compete for the
privilege of replying to this estimable discourse, when
the door opened and the call-boy (Bodleberry, Jr., with
a small figure to match his mother's, and a large crop
of red hair to match his departed father's) summoned
Mundle to the floor of the House.
"Be confident," concluded that gentleman before clos
ing the door, "that McGoozle will be squashed, and that,"
with calm emphasis, "I shall squash him."
The door closed. Burdle looked at Tosh. Tosh re
turned the compliment.
—DOWNING MacGALLON.

they are." Hands deep in pockets signified the depth of
this remark.
"Those who are not aware of the modern advance
ments made in psychology and education cannot be ex
pected to understand them." Mundle looked suspiciously
at Tosh, who looked suspiciously at Burdle, who looked
at the floor. Mundle warmed to the subject.
"Modern psychology has unearthed the fact that
young men are mental mechanisms fully capable of di
gesting any idea fed to them. Modern education has
taken unto itself the duty of feeding ideas systematically
to the young.
"Now an idea, by itself, is neither moral nor .im
moral; it is simply an idea, and as an idea must be
tested. It can be tested properly only by the young
mind, because the young mind is the only mind without
bias, without ideas of its own.
"To insist that youth shall be taught only what has
passed the moral censorship of the aged is to limit
progress, cripple intelligence, and restrain civilization.
Youth must be taught everything, for the more it knows
the more it will produce."
"Therefore," said Mundle, as a final logical step,
"McGoozle is not only a Victorian, but an ignoramus,
and a humbug."
Tosh and Burdle were about to compete for the
privilege of replying to this estimable discourse, when
the door opened and the call-boy (Bodleberry, Jr., with
a small figure to match his mother's, and a large crop
of red hair to match his departed father's) summoned
Mundle to the floor of the House.
"Be confident," concluded that gentleman before clos
ing the door, "that McGoozle will be squashed, and that,"
with calm emphasis, "I shall squash him."
The door closed. Burdle looked at Tosh. Tosh re
turned the compliment.
—DOWNING MacGALLON.

tions of a Teacher appeared in Friday's issue of the Daily.
Others zvill appear front time to time.)
"To know McGoozle, is to convict him," went on
Mundle, who had been talking to his friends Burdle and
Tosh in the retiring room of the lower House, about the
Bill, "of being a "Victorian." His bulging forehead
glistened, and his drooping shoulders straightened as he
drew back from the table to expand with the magnifi
cence of this discovery.
Burdle was thin; Tosh was thinner.
"How true," interposed Tosh, anticipating Burdle.
Mundle, who believed everybody not of consequence
should be ignored, ignored Tosh.
"The issues of this case," went on Mundle calmly
(Mundle was always calm, heavily calm like unrefined
oil), "are broader than McGoozle."
McGoozle was a plump gentleman; so Burdle replied
immediately, "Certainly."
"They are so broad," continued Mundle insensible of
interruption, "that 1 am just beginning to see how broad
they are." Hands deep in pockets signified the depth of
this remark.
