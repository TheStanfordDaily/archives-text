# STANFORD STAGE
## 
### 
What was lacking in "Will Shakes
peare?" Why did it fail to register with
the audience ?â€”for no one can say that
it did register for the most part.
It wasn't the acting; the leads arc to
be congratulated on their interpretations,
and the rest of the cast did as well as
casts can be expected to do. <
It wasn't the settings; the bursts of
applause as the curtains rolled back for
each new scene attests that.
The only thing left is the play itself.
"Will Shakespeare" definitely demon
strated that the campus is not ready for
what may be called the "highbrow" type
of play, for lack of a better name. Lines
in blank verse; long, poetical speeches;
lack of a single instance of dramatic re
lief ; and, above all, four hours of it:
that is what was the matter with "Will
Shakespeare."
"Hhe Who Gets Slapped" appealed to
most of the students. "Will Shakespeare"
appealed to very few, and they were in
terested in seeing what the leads could
do with the millstone they had tied
around their neck rather than in the play.
When He talked, he talked as a hu
man being world talk; we could laugh
with him (and fortunately were given a
chance to do so), while with Will we
were always wondering in the back of
our minds: "Hew does he get that way?
Did human ever talk so?"
The student body of n university ought
to appreciate good drama; but the fact
remains that they don t. And another
cold, hard fact that the Stanford the
ater is to face is the fact that they will
not patronize what they do not appreci
ate. Half the house last Friday was
faculty and Palo Alto people.
And the Stanford stage must soon de
cide: shall we ke:p the students ini'r
ested, of any type, or shall we gj on
with the classical drama, interesting some
third of the student body ?
It seems to me that "Will Shake
speare" was a warning; whether it will
be followed or not remains to be seen.
Nothing could be worse than to have in
terest in dramatics die out; nothing will
be more inevitable if the play type is not
changed.
Henslowe turned the phrase very
neatly in the play itself: "They want
light stuff." And that is true, no matter
how unfortunate. Watch the house for
the Junior Opera, if you think it other
wise; or recall the house for Ram's
Head Show.
Yea, verily, "they# want light stuff."
Too bad the author of "Will Shake
speare" did not apply that. And worse,
if the Stanford stage does not apply it.
Ho hum! On with the play.
