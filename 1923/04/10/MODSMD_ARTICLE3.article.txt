### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON—
Coach Enoch Bagshavf has made his
call for a spring football turnout and
more than fifty men answered the
summons. The first workout was light,
most of the burden being borne by the
coaches. Bagshaw lectured on the
theory of different parts of the game
which was followed by a practical
demonstration by the coaching staff.
Owing to the use of the stadium by
the track men it is necessary for the
spring football turnout to take place
on one of the smaller fields.
