# A.C. Howland's Paintings On Display at Art Gallery
## 
### 
A collection of reproductions of oil
paintings made by A. C. Rowland, an
early American artist, is now on dis
play at the Stanford Art Gallery to
gether with a group of the originals.
The early American mode of living
is realistically shown in one of the
original paintings. The old boots,
chairs, tables, and flag stones are in
the characteristic old colonial door
way. The '"Congregational Church in
Southampton," a twilight view of the
church behind its screen of elms,
shows good composition.
