# Do Men Dress for Women?
## 
### Max 
Masculine majority at Stanford de
clares that the women dress to please
the men. Feminine observation says
they do.
Men who have black hair and
brown eyes wear whitÂ© sweaters to
make their dark features more prom
inent. They probably don't do this to
make themselves more attractive to
the members of the Five Hundred.
No, no, no! It is for color contrast.
A good many of the Sons of the
Stanford Red who have blue eyes
wear blue shirts to deepen the color
of their eyes. But not because there
are women on the campus. Possibly
the men are trying to vamp the pro
fessors.
You may think that the fellows use
bandoline to make their hair stay in
place and to make them look like Ru
dolph Vaselino. Wrong again! Bando
line probably makes it easier for the
men to run their fingers through their
hair while they are studying.
Ever notice the collegiate angle that
most of the fellows wear their hats on
Quad? Well, that isn't because there
are any women around. Why, Robin
son Crusoe probably did the same
thing.
Stanford men pay very little atten
tion to the way they look. Just go into
Sticky's any day and sit at the foun
tain. There you will see the masculine
occupants look into the big mirror
just after every other sip of a "choc
malt."
