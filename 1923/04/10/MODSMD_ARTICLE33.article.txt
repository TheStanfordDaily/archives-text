# Foreign Trade Students Have Weird Knowledge of Geography
## 
### 
Singapore is in Greenland; the dis
tance from San Francisco to Bombay
ranges from 5000 to 20,000 miles; and
South America is directly south of
North America. These are a few of
the more startling answers made by
students in a Foreign Trade class quiz
this quarter. Professor E. G. Mears,
who gives the course, wanted to test
liis students' conception of foreign
localities and their knowledge of the
two Americas. On the whole, however,
he says, his questions were answered
fairly well.
Of the 105 who took the quiz, 09
had been to other parts of North
America other than the United States,
while 16 had visited Europe. Asia and
South America were tied for third
with four visitors each, while Oceania
claimed one. No one had as yet pene
trated the "Dark Continent."
In answer to the second question
which asked for distances between
San Francisco and Bombay, Cape
Town, Hongkong, London, Port Said,
and Valparaiso by the shortest water
routes, thirty-eight got the Hongkong
mileage right at 6000 miles. The guess
at the distance between the Bay City
and Cape Town, 9500 miles, was an
swered correctly by only thirteen stu

dents.
The present interest in the Far East
may have had something to do with
the fact that eighty-seven gave cor
rectly the capitals of China and Japan,
Peking and Tokyo respectively, while
the capital city of Uruguay, Monte
video, was answered accurately by
only twenty-six.
In a list of fourteen cities ranging
from such well-known centers as
Havre, Lima, and Zurich, to the less
familiar cities of Asuncion, Auckland,
and Batavia, Havre in France led, 88
placing it correctly. Lima in Peru was
located by 83, Zurich in Switzerland
by 67, and Johannesburg in British
South Africa by 42. More students
failed to place Singapore, a British
colony in the Strait Settlements, than
any other. It was located by only nine
students.
The last question asked for a rough
outline map of the Americas, and ac
cording to Professor Mears, "some
good pictures were turned in. The
common knowledge is that South
America is directly below North
America," Professor Mears said. "In
reality, however, a line drawn south
from Pittsburgh would not strike
South America but would run into the
Pacific Ocean."
