# BRUIN BABES CATCH TOP FORM FOR '26 CINDER OVAL MEET
## California Cubs Have Won Five Contests; Fifty Men to Make Trip 
### Sidney Garfinkel, '26 
{Sport Staff Daily Califortiian)
A few more workouts, and the Cali
fornia freshman track squad will be in
first-class shape for the meet with the
Stanford babes Saturday at Palo Alto.
Approximately fifty men will make the
trip, and they will be fifty who have
proven their worth in practice meets.
Coach Christie has welded together one
of the best freshman squads in years
and barring last-minute injuries or cinch
notices, the Stanford freshmen should
have a full afternoon's work ahead of
them, if they are to win.
The Bruin babes have engaged in five
practice meets, all of which have been
won with ease. About 500 points have
been registered by the freshmen, against
100 by their combined opponents. Mo
desto High and Junior College were able
to collect but 18 points, while the 1926
squad rolled up 106.
There is no particular event in which
the California freshmen are outstanding,
and likewise there is no apparent weak
ness in any event. Some remarkable
performances have been given in the
pre-season meets, and against the Cardi
nal babes, even better times should re
sult.
In the 100-yard dash, Barber, Blume.
and Colex usually run one-two-three,
with the first named breasting the tape
in about ten seconds. The same men
run in the 220-yard dash. Silverman is
the outstanding quarter-miler and he is
good for about 54 seconds.
One of the best races of the day should
be the 880-yard run, with Boyden of
California against RicharJson of Stan
ford. Boyden has never been pressed
this season, but he may lead Richardson
to the tape.
Orme is a crack miler who generally
wins his race, and in the two mile, Damon
has been going good. Some excellent
hurdlers will be present in Dodson and
Corley, who run in both of the stick
events. They are expected to make
Boles extend himself to his utmost, if he
is to win. The four men who run the
one-mile relay are practically unbeatable.
Bussey, Silverman, Boyden and Watkins
negotiate a fast mile between them.
In the field department, the freshmen
have some husky weight men, who are
good for a number of points. "Smoke"
Francis has been heaving the discus
around 125 feet, besides putting the shot
43 feet or so. Koblick high jumps around
5 feet 8 inches, and Willi hurls the
javelin 154 feet in competition. Watkins
is far and away the best? broad jumper on
the squad, and his leaps average around
21 feet 3 inches. Upson and Hempktr
hold up the pole-vaulting end in good
fashion.
These are the outstanding men on the
team, men who have usually won their
events, but there are many cindermen in
addition, who may account for some sec
onds and thirds.
If the Stanford team is as good as it
is supposed to be, and the California
squad performs up to pre-season indica
tions, then one of the best freshmen
track meets for a long time should result
—a meet which should be close up to the
final events.

addition, who may account for some sec
onds and thirds.
If the Stanford team is as good as it
is supposed to be, and the California
squad performs up to pre-season indica
tions, then one of the best freshmen
track meets for a long time should result
—a meet which should be close up to the
final events.
{Sport Staff Daily Califortiian)
A few more workouts, and the Cali
fornia freshman track squad will be in
first-class shape for the meet with the
Stanford babes Saturday at Palo Alto.
Approximately fifty men will make the
trip, and they will be fifty who have
proven their worth in practice meets.
Coach Christie has welded together one
of the best freshman squads in years
and barring last-minute injuries or cinch
notices, the Stanford freshmen should
have a full afternoon's work ahead of
them, if they are to win.
The Bruin babes have engaged in five
practice meets, all of which have been
won with ease. About 500 points have
been registered by the freshmen, against
100 by their combined opponents. Mo
desto High and Junior College were able
to collect but 18 points, while the 1926
squad rolled up 106.
There is no particular event in which
the California freshmen are outstanding,
and likewise there is no apparent weak
ness in any event. Some remarkable
performances have been given in the
pre-season meets, and against the Cardi
nal babes, even better times should re
sult.
In the 100-yard dash, Barber, Blume.
and Colex usually run one-two-three,
with the first named breasting the tape
in about ten seconds. The same men
run in the 220-yard dash. Silverman is
the outstanding quarter-miler and he is
good for about 54 seconds.
One of the best races of the day should
be the 880-yard run, with Boyden of
California against RicharJson of Stan
ford. Boyden has never been pressed
this season, but he may lead Richardson
to the tape.
Orme is a crack miler who generally
wins his race, and in the two mile, Damon
has been going good. Some excellent
hurdlers will be present in Dodson and
Corley, who run in both of the stick
events. They are expected to make
Boles extend himself to his utmost, if he
is to win. The four men who run the
one-mile relay are practically unbeatable.
Bussey, Silverman, Boyden and Watkins
negotiate a fast mile between them.
In the field department, the freshmen
have some husky weight men, who are
good for a number of points. "Smoke"
Francis has been heaving the discus
around 125 feet, besides putting the shot
43 feet or so. Koblick high jumps around
5 feet 8 inches, and Willi hurls the
javelin 154 feet in competition. Watkins
is far and away the best? broad jumper on
the squad, and his leaps average around
21 feet 3 inches. Upson and Hempktr
hold up the pole-vaulting end in good
fashion.
These are the outstanding men on the
team, men who have usually won their
events, but there are many cindermen in
addition, who may account for some sec
onds and thirds.
