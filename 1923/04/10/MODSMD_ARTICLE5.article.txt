# Shrieking Sirens on Motor Trucks to Add Thrills to Jolly-Up
## 
### 
Whoopee! Sheiks, shrieks, and
sirens will strut their stuff Satur
day night. Huh? on, yean,â€”it'B the
Skull and Snakes spring Jolly-Up.
Lady-laden motor trucks will take
all corners on high and two wheels.
All roughs shall appear in campus
raiment and bow ties, according to
a statement issued yesterday by the
chairman of the Jolly-Up commit
tee. Those who aren't convention
ally dressed will not be allowed to
remain and enjoy the festivities.
Refreshments will be of a decided
plebian nature. Soda pop, peanuts,
and chewing gum will satisfy the
general demand.
