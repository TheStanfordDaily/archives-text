# Eight Men to Represent Each Class in Tennis
## 
### 
Under the new interclass tennis rules
recently adopted for use in the interclass
tournament this quarter, an eight-man
team will represent each class. As yet
the class managers have not conducted
any elimination contests to determine the
eight best men in their respective classes,
but as soon as the teams are selected the
interclass series will begin. Class man
agers should see Charles W. Davis, in
tramural director, in order to arrange a
schedule of games and set a date for the
beginning of the tournament.
The results of the interclass matchcs
will he added to tilt points made so far
by the various class teams in other
sports.
