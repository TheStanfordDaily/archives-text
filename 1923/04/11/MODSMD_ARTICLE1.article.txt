Joffre debates are not co-iducted in
the form of ordinary forensics. They
are more in the nature of an individual
contest between representatives of Cali
fornia and Stanford. The medal is
awarded, not to the best team, but to
the individual who delivers the best
argument.
A general topic for the Joffre debate
was announced during December. Since
that time the Stanford representatives
have been preparing themselves on all
phases of the question. The definite sub
ject of the drhate will be chosen two
hours before the contest is to begin and
the arguers will then prepare their
speeches. The general topic of the de
bate is French fojreign policy on the
continen* since the treaty of Versailles.
Professor Palm of the University of
California and Professor Lutz of Stan
ford will jointly choose the final word
ing of the question.
