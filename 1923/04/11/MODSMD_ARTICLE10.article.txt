# INTRA MURAL BASEBALL TEAMS ADVANCE IN PLAY
## 
### 
El Cuadro. Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Delta
Theta, and Theta Xi emerged victori
ous from the first round of games
played yesterday in the intramural
baseball series. For the most part the
games were slow and uninteresting,
one side or another having a decided
advantage over its opponent.
A factor which helped decidedly to
slow up the games was the condition
of the diamonds. Most of them were
covered with uncut grass and full of
ruts and holes. The players were con
fronted with great difficulties in at
tempting to play on the diamonds pro
vided for them.

In the feature game of the day,
Theta Xi defeated El Toro, 7-3. The
contest, unlike the others, went the
entire seven frames. Hard and timely
hitting by Wingard, who scored two
runs for the winners, was a factor in
the victory of the engineers.
The other games were won by top
heavy scores, and ended long before
seven innings were completed. Phi
Kappa Psi smothered the Encina Sec
onds, 10-1; Phi Delta Theta buried
Alpha Kappa Lambda under a 21-0
score; and El Cuadro ran wild against
Alpha Sigma Phi, running up a 23-0
count.
