# LUCKY DATE CHOSEN FOR FIRST DANCE TO BE GIVEN BY QUAD
## 
### 
The hoodoo that is popularly sup
posed to hang over Friday the 13th
has been discarded for the day after
tomorrow when the 1924 Quad gives
its closed date cance at the Women's
Clubhouse.
Whitmer's orchestra will furnish the
music. Special decorative effects are
being worked out, and those in charge
promise an enjoyable evening of danc
ing. The proceeds from the affair will
go to the Endowment fund.
The 1924 Quad is the' first of the
year-book organizations to sponsor a
closed date dance, and it is probable
that the custom thus started will be
continued in the following years.
