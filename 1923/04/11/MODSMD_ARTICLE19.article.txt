A Stanford team won't yield
On California's field;
They'd rather fight and die, that's true.

When Stanf ordi downs the Gold and Bhie.
The Stanford men will tell
How California fell;
Just how the Card'nals made their score.
Now Stanford banners wave
O'er California's grave;
The Golden Bear will growl no more.
