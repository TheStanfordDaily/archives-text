# FRESHMAN TRACK MEN WILL MEET U.C. CUBS ON STANFORD OVAL
## 
### 
One of the strongest freshman track
teams in years will represent Stanford
next Saturday against the California
Cub squad on the Stanford Oval.
In her track stars lies Stanford's
strength. In the field events lies her
weakness. The Cardinal babes should
have little difficulty in taking the ma
jority of first places in the track
events of the coming meet, while on
the other hand only an upset of dope
would concede them more than one or
two firsts in the field events.
First place men are conceded to be
absolutely necessary to win a meet,
but no more so than are the second
and third places. The meet will prob
ably be decided on the merits of some
third point man. Stanford has not
what might be termed a strong collec
tion of second and third place men,
aside from runners in the hundred,
two-twenty, and the mile.
In the hurdles Boles looks to be the
only Stanford runner who will have
a chance to place. If by a chance he
fails to do so, it might prove the
turning point of the day. Boles has not
been as consistent as most of the
other stars in his hurdle events, but
he has the form and speed which,
coupled with confidence, should mean
ten points for Stanford Saturday.
