# NOT LACK OF INTEREST
## 
### 
It does not seem likely that the feeble response to
the opening sale of rooters' tickets for the Big Meet,
April 21, is an indication of lack of interest in the
contest on the part of Stanford students. Certainly
more than the 123 men and ten women who appeared
yesterday have been following the preliminary sea
son and intend to go to Berkeley next week. It is
more probable that the failure to purchase tickets is
due to the ever-present student tendency toward pro
crastination. Graduate Manager Bill Fletcher has
announced that the sale will continue this afternoon
and tomorrow afternoon in the Administration build
ing. After that students will be able to secure ad
mittance only at the price charged the general public.
