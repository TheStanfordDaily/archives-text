# DREAMS-BY-DAY
## 
### 
There is a story of a man who was an ingenious
day-dreamer. Almost hourly this man fabricated
some highly imaginative fantasy in which he was
always the hero, easily triumphant against stagger
ing odds. But Sunday he reserved for the favorite
figment of his weird fancy. This dream fascinated
him; he never tired of it. And it was always the
same, lie saw himself arriving late outside the
great church which he attended. As he looked up
at the towering steeple, a crack appeared in its
masonry—and widened. He pictured himself as
striding in before the pulpit, and calmly saying:
"There i,s a crack spreading in the steeple, and it
will fall any moment. Everyone will go out quietly."
And he saw them obey, orderly, unexcited, those
nearest the door going first. It was all done simply,
quickly, with no confusion. Then the steeple fell,
thundering down upon the seats vacated by the con
gregation. lie heard them sob, and he felt himself
lifted to the shoulders of men who cheered his name.
He was their savior.
One Sunday the dreamer stood before this church.
He looked up at the steeple and saw a crack appear
in the masonry. Striding quickly inside, he told the
people of the danger, calmly, just as he had dreamed
he would. But they did not go quietly. A panic
burst among them; many were trampled upon, and
some died. When it was over they cried the dreamer's
name. But not in gratitude. There was no crack
in the steeple. It stood sound and true. The dreamer
fled and took his life.
This is an extreme, and in itself a strongly imagi
native example. But such a thing could happen.
The tale shows how far dreams-by-day can go. Psy
chologically, it is not unsound. Most of us, how
ever, need not worry. Day-dreaming is a pleasant
■pastime; it demands so little effort. Indulged in not
to excess, it is even valuable.
