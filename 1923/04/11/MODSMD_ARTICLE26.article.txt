# Our Library

### 
Our library has become a Mecca for tourists. Daily,
our reading room swarms with sight-seers who tramp
busily up and down the aisles, only to annoy the poor
damned students who are making a futile attempt to
elevate their minds. The travelers have, no regular
hours, and no respect for the tranquility of the students'
study.
These tourists are very cosmopolitan. In their groups
one may find farmers from lowa, herring hunters from
Nova Scotia, and backwoodsmen from Eureka. The
visitors range in age from the squalling child to the
decrepit old man, who has to be guided by the more
stalwart.
In the past the University officials have sadly ne
glected these wondering people. The librarian should
provide guides and descriptive pamphlets for their
grasping intellects. Also, table space should be provided
s'o that they may enjoy the lunches they bring with
them. Receptacles should be placed under the tables,
so that the debris, which is usually so prevalent, would
disappear. At present there are several unfortunates
in the hospital who have inopportunely slipped on a
banana peel.
The presence of stray dogs seems to annoy the vis
itors. At times these dogs run out from under tables
and either bark at or bite the unsuspecting onlooker.
Something must be done to do away with this apparent
nuisance. We should either keep the dogs out of the
library or provide each person with a pair of steel shin
guards.
At times the tourists have made complaint that there
is not sufficient room for their comfort. In such cases
the students should give up their chairs and get else
where for contemplation and study. Too often the
strangers are left standing and are not given the proper
attention. What impression will they have of those
students who do not try to please them at a moment's
notice?
What a boon to the weaker members of the mob if
they could but ride to the second and third stories on
an escalator. It has also been requested that a souvenir
counter be placed near the exit, so that the people could
have appropriate remembrances without having to carry
off bulky books.
All of these improvements would help to perpetuate
and increase the interest of these knowledge seekers in
this Mecca of travelers. —W. H. R.
