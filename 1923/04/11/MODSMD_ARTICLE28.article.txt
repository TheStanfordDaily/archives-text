The Spring Sports Rally held last
flight in Encina popped, fizzled, and
died, after unsuccessful efforts had
been made by Yell Leaders Minsky,
Huneke, and Lapp to excite interest
on the campus a half hour after
the scheduled time.
Some two hundred students at
tended the noise-making campaign
prepared to yell and listen to
speeches, only to be turned away
with neither.
Coach Harry Wolter, the main
speaker of the evening, was not
able to be present and members of
the tennis aiid baseball squads were
noticeably absent; so Lou Minsky
took the burden of relating the
purpose of the rally which ended
soon after with the singing of the
Hymn.
