# Jimmie Todd To Be Starter In Big Meet At Berkeley April 21
## 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Jimmie Todd, famous University of
California quarter miler, has been
named as starter for the Big Meet at
Berkeley April 21. He will be assisted
by Olie Snedigar and Frank Foster of
the Olympic Club.
"Who is this fellow Todd?" we asked
4, Dink" Templeton.
The Card track mentor heaved the
sixteen-pound shot out some thirty-si::
feet before he answered.
"He won the 440 in the Big Meet in
1915 in fast time, and in running the
last lap of the relay overcame a fifteen- i
yard lead and broke the tape for the
Blue and Gold. The California rooters
piled down out of the bleachers for
the serpentine, as the relay was the
deciding factor in the meet.
"About this time 'Rick' (Templeton)
discovered that his one jump earlier
in the afternoon had qualified him for
the finals in the broad jump, and he
had one leap left. As it stood, a Cali
fornia man had third place with a
jump of twenty-one feet, eleven inches.:
'Rick' jumped twenty-two feet and the |
California rooters climbed back into
the bleachers."
From present indications, the Big
Meet this year will be just about as
close as was in 1915 and last year, l
and "Dink" is leaving no stones un
turned to turn the tide in favor of the
Cardinal.
He is out working hard with every
promising candidate each afternoon. I
"Dink" is the kind of coach that tells
a man what to do, how to do it, and
then shows him how. Following him
around and trying to get him to talk
is almost a hopeless job.
We found him over with the javelin
throwers, heaving the spear out with
the best of them. Three men running

a flight of hurdles claimed his atten
tion next, and he hurried over to give
a few words of advice. And so he
went from one part of the oval to the
other, finally ending up at the shot-put
ring where he challenged Boone, fresh
man weight man, and Richards, var
sity man.
And "Dink" is going to have many
more such busy days before the
timer's gun announces the start of the
mile, run April 21 on the Berkeley
field. One of the busiest of these days
is due Friday afternoon when na All-
Southern Conference team made up
o fstars from small colleges in south
ern California invades the campus for
a tilt with the Stanford varsity.
The southerners are reputed to have
a strong, well-balanced aggregation
and should push the Cards to the limit
to come out on top.
