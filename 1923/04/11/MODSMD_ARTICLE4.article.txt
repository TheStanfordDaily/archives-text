# Preliminary Tryouts For Junior Opera Will Be Held Tonight, Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tryouts for the 1924 Junior Opera
will be held this afternoon from
2 to 5 and tonight from 7 to
10 in the Assembly hall. They will be
conducted by Richard C. Bentinck, di
rector of the opera, and Miss Margaret
McGovern, in charge of the choruses.
All students of the University, with
the exception of freshman women, are
eligible to tryout for the opera. They
must, however, conform to the regula
tions limiting each student to partici
pation in only one play a quarter.
The opera this year contains a wide
variety of parts, offering opportunities
for many types of acting. Specialty
acts are particularly needed, according
to the opera committee, and anyone
having ability along this line, is urged
to tryout.
Further tryouts will be held on
Thursday, and final selection of the
cast made by the end of the week.
Rehearsals will probably begin on
Monday.
