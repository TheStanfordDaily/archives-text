# VARSITY SWIMMERS PREPARE FOR MEET WITH U.C. FRIDAY
## 
### 
Preparations are nearing completion
for the big swimming meet Friday at
2:30, when the Stanford and California
varsities tangle in Encina pool in what
should be a close and exciting contest.
Although the Cardinal mermen have a
slight edge over the Bruins, it is not
enough for them to cease to worry for
points.
The program calls for eight events,
making a total of 68 points. After a bit
of close figuring, Coach Ernie Brandsten
announced that he thought his charges
capable of annexing at least 38 of these.
This would give Stanford the meet by
a slight margin.
Although strong in some events, the
Cardinals are extremely weak in the fifty
and hundred yard swims. Third places
in these are assured, since each team can
enter but two men in each event. But
whether McCallister in the fifty, and
Austin and Wright in the hundred, will
be able to do better than this, is a de
cided question.
In the 220, with Austin, and Belcher
or Draper competing, first and third
should be won by Stanford. Fletcher
and Kramer in the breaststroke, and De-
Groot and White in the backstroke
should meet with but little opposition
from the Blue and Gold swimmers. In
the diving, with White, and Sneddon or
Gibbons competing for Stanford, lrst
and second places are practically assured.
The plunge, with Hawley, and Miller, or
Rosenbaum, should add five more points
to Stanford's score.
The relay presents an entirely different
story. Austin, McCallister, Wright, and
Herschmann or Belcher will be lucky if
they can nose the California swimmers
out. It looks like five easy points for the
Californians.
