# FRANCES R. SMITH DESCRIBES EARLY SPANISH MISSIONS
## Alumna Delivers Illustrated Lecture on Architecture of Old Churches of State 
### 
Old Spanish missions and their
architecture and history that were
closely associated with the early ro
mance of California, were discussed
by Frances Rand Smith, '97, in an il
lustrated lecture at the Little Theatre
last evening.
"Extensive walls built of block and
sandstone or adobe brick were dom
inant features of the Spanish archi
tecture," said Mrs. Smith. "There is a
great deal of fascination in the varia
tions of form, color, and simplicity of
the California mission.
Father Serra Starts Carmel Mission
"In 1770 Father Junipero Serra be
gan the mission at Carmel, and the
thatch in which Father Serra lived
still stands today. In the room that
the priest occupied there was a beau
tiful door. After he. died, a man who
had been the mission-keeper for thirty
years removed the doorway from the
building and put it in the stone church.
Every doorway in the mission church
has a different style of architecture."
Many people beliefe that Father
Serro was buried in the stone church
near the altar. According to Mrs.
Smith, the church was built after
Father Serro's death, and the priest
expressed a wish to be buried in his
own church. It is quite possible that
the priests of the mission moved the
remains of Father Serro to the stone
church after it was completed.
Weak Protection Against Indians
The Carmel mission has large but
tresses. The arches of the church were
built wide to support the burden of
the massive roof. Even though the In
dians were very docile, a stockade was
erected for protection against them.
Father Serro himself said that the
palisade was so weak that the Indians
could have broken through the defense
by pushing a board out.
Mrs. Smith gave an account of how
parts of the mission at Santa Cruz
were reconstructed. The research
workers had ninety feet of stone wall
that was supposed to have been in
back of the % church. All the records of
the mission had been lost.
Mission Later Reconstructed
"S. H. Willey, who was later a trus
tee of the University of California,
was interested in the mission and had
made extensive investigation of the
ruins," said Mrs. Smith. "Mr. Willey
made a report of his research work
and gave the ground dimensions of
the church as benig 29 feet wide and
112 feet long. A priest, Father Adams,
was also exploring the ruins of the
Santa Cruz mission, and wrote an ac
count of his investigation, giving the
same ground measurements for the
church. We assumed these dimensions
to be correct and they were used in
the reconstruction of the church.
"Later a French artist painted a
picture of the mission, but he drew
the whole thing twice as high as it
should have been. After reducing the
height of the mission as the artist
represented it in the picture, the paint
ing was used as a basis for the recon
struction work."
Mrs. Smith used a number of slides,
showing pictures and diagrams of the
missions, to illustrate her lecture.

by pushing a board out.
Mrs. Smith gave an account of how
parts of the mission at Santa Cruz
were reconstructed. The research
workers had ninety feet of stone wall
that was supposed to have been in
back of the % church. All the records of
the mission had been lost.
Mission Later Reconstructed
"S. H. Willey, who was later a trus
tee of the University of California,
was interested in the mission and had
made extensive investigation of the
ruins," said Mrs. Smith. "Mr. Willey
made a report of his research work
and gave the ground dimensions of
the church as benig 29 feet wide and
112 feet long. A priest, Father Adams,
was also exploring the ruins of the
Santa Cruz mission, and wrote an ac
count of his investigation, giving the
same ground measurements for the
church. We assumed these dimensions
to be correct and they were used in
the reconstruction of the church.
"Later a French artist painted a
picture of the mission, but he drew
the whole thing twice as high as it
should have been. After reducing the
height of the mission as the artist
represented it in the picture, the paint
ing was used as a basis for the recon
struction work."
Mrs. Smith used a number of slides,
showing pictures and diagrams of the
missions, to illustrate her lecture.
Old Spanish missions and their
architecture and history that were
closely associated with the early ro
mance of California, were discussed
by Frances Rand Smith, '97, in an il
lustrated lecture at the Little Theatre
last evening.
"Extensive walls built of block and
sandstone or adobe brick were dom
inant features of the Spanish archi
tecture," said Mrs. Smith. "There is a
great deal of fascination in the varia
tions of form, color, and simplicity of
the California mission.
Father Serra Starts Carmel Mission
"In 1770 Father Junipero Serra be
gan the mission at Carmel, and the
thatch in which Father Serra lived
still stands today. In the room that
the priest occupied there was a beau
tiful door. After he. died, a man who
had been the mission-keeper for thirty
years removed the doorway from the
building and put it in the stone church.
Every doorway in the mission church
has a different style of architecture."
Many people beliefe that Father
Serro was buried in the stone church
near the altar. According to Mrs.
Smith, the church was built after
Father Serro's death, and the priest
expressed a wish to be buried in his
own church. It is quite possible that
the priests of the mission moved the
remains of Father Serro to the stone
church after it was completed.
Weak Protection Against Indians
The Carmel mission has large but
tresses. The arches of the church were
built wide to support the burden of
the massive roof. Even though the In
dians were very docile, a stockade was
erected for protection against them.
Father Serro himself said that the
palisade was so weak that the Indians
could have broken through the defense
by pushing a board out.
