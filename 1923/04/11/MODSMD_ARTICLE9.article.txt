## 
### 
The Stanford and California freshman
swimming teams will meet Friday after
noon at 230 in Encina pool. The fresh
man events will take place between the
varsity events.
Coach Brandsten anticipates but lit
tle diculty for the Cardinal yearlings
in making a clean sweep of all the
events. Not a single first place should
be lost by the Stanford first-year men.
The 1926 swimming team shapes up as
one of the strongest freshman combi
nations in years. They are strong in
every event on the program.
O'Connor, in the 220, backstroke, and
relay; Allen and Ackerman, in the 50,
100, and relay; and Langlcy, in the 220
and plunge, should be the high point
men of the day. Other probable point
winners are Hablutzel and Flagler or
Mack in the breaststroke; Canfield or
Morrison in the backstroke; Smith, King
or Brown in the diving; and Reynolds
; or Johnston in the plunge.
