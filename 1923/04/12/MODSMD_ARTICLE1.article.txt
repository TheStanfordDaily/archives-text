# GLEE CLUB LEADS SINGING AT FIRST STUDENT ASSEMBLY
## Comptroller Roth Informs Student Body of Steady Development on Campus 
### 
"Do students realize that the Stan-!
ford campus—Bsoo acres —is the larg
est in the world?" This statement by
Comptroller A. E. Roth was one of
several illuminating facts set forth at j
the assembly this morning.
An experiment in student body sing-1
nig, led by Warren D. Allen with the 1
Glee Club, was the feature of the pro- j
gram. Words of familiar rooting songs
were flashed upon the screen and the
audience followed the Glee Club's ex
ample with a real attempt at singing.
Assisted by Grinstead's orchestra, the
club introduced "We're Sailing Up the j
Bay," a new song written by C. W. ;
Midgley, Jr., '23, and Lamar Phyfer, j
'20, which will be used at the Stanford-1
California track meet. The Glee Club I
also sang two selections, "Calf of
Gold," from "Faust," and "Bill's Bill
Board."
In answering questions which are j
most often asked about the University, j
Comptroller Roth settled such queries
as "Why is the new Encina dining hall
yellow? Where did the stone of the
University buildings come from and 1
why is not the pile of stones removed [
from the ground below Encina?"
"The stone in Encina Halls has aged
and is consequently darker in color,"
said Mr. Roth. "With time, the dining
hall will be the same shade as the
other buildings."
San Jose and a quarry on the Stan
ford property are the sources of all the ,
stone material used in Quad buildings,
according to Roth. "The stone pile j
near Encina is not removed simply
because it is too expensive to do so,"
he said. "No more buildings will be
erected for at least ten years," he de
clared. "It will require that length of
time to pay off the debt for the Nurses'
Home in San Francisco, the Union,
Toyon Hall, and Encina Dining Hall."
Branner Hall, a new dormitory, the
money for which was promised by the
Board of Athletic Control, was also
mentioned by the speaker. "No definite
statement will be made for a few days
until approved by President Wilbur,
but materials for the new hall have
already been bought, with a saving to
the University of $50,000."
Plans for a wonderful arboretum are
under way. according to Roth, and all
the land along the San Francisquito
creek will eventually be included in
the improved grounds.
"Students often ask what causes the
odor in Searsville water. Accumulat
ing silt from the mountains is the
answer," said Mr. Roth. "The only
permanently harmful effect is disJ
coloration of buildings. When a sec
ond dam can be built, it will be pos
sible to keep Lake Lagunita full all
year without the necessity of draining
it in the summer. The University
would have the added advantage of
an increased domestic water supply."
In speaking of University finances,
Mr. Roth stated that the annual in
come will probably be increased from
a profit of $1200 to $00,000 by renting
land south of the University on long
term leases. The stock farm is at
present a losing proposition, he said.
"The first student assembly was a
decided success," said Professor E. E.
Robinson this morning. "We ought to
congratulate the leaders on this plan
and to congratulate ourselves on the
way it was carried forward. There is
a unity of sentiment at Stanford, if
only it may be given an appropriate
method of expression."
