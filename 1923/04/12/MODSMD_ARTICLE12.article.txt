domestic and foreign policy has been dis
cussed. Most of the questions have been
upon phases of French political life
which were contemporary of the time of
the debate, but some questions, such as
the question of whether or not the cen
tralized form of the French government
is conducive ■to the stability of the re
public, have a more lasting interest. This
question was the topics debated in 1896.

Stanford's Joffre debaters, who will J
meet the speakers lrom the University
of California in the Assembly Hall on
the campus tomorrow evening at 8, are
well prepared to meet the Berkeleyites, I
according to debating adviser,. J. G. Emer-1
son. They have been preparing their j
arguments since last December and in!
this time the Stanford arguers have read
and digested an immense amount of
material.
The general topic of the discussion
Friday will be "French foreign policy on
the continent since the signing of the
treaty of Versailles." The definite phase
of this question upon which the debaters j
will argue tomorrow will be announced
to them two hours before the debate is
scheduled to begin.
Knox Miller, '23, won the Joffre con
test last year and this year's speakers
again hope to win the laurels for Stan
ford. The men who will represent Stan
ford are Bertrand Comparet, '24, j
Matthew Tobriner, '24, and Thomas
Bailey, '24. All of these men have had
previous varsity debating experience.
During the 29 years during which
Stanford and California have met in this
contest practically every phase of French
domestic and foreign policy has been dis
cussed. Most of the questions have been
upon phases of French political life
which were contemporary of the time of
the debate, but some questions, such as
the question of whether or not the cen
tralized form of the French government
is conducive ■to the stability of the re
public, have a more lasting interest. This
question was the topics debated in 1896.
What is now known as the Joffre de
bate was originally named the Carnot
debate, in honor of Sadi Carnot, assas
sinated president of France. In 1918 the
name of the contest was changed to the
Joffre debate in honor of Marshall Joffre.
At the time of the changing of the
name of the debate Marshall Joffre
showed his interest in the debate, and
showed himself deeply moved at the
change of the name in his honor. Last
year Joffre was in this country and he
hoped to hear the contest but he was
called east two weeks before the debate.
All of the men who competed in the argu
ment last year were given autographed
French briar pipes by the marshall.
