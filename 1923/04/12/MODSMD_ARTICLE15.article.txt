# CARDS MEET SOUTHERN TRACKSTERS TOMORROW
## Athletes From Four Colleges Will Oppose Templeton's Squad 
### 
Twenty-three track athletes, the pick of sunny southern California, arrived
on the campus today to do battle with "Dink" Templeton's squad on the local
oval tomorrow afternoon. Coached by Joe Pipal of Occidental and Harry
Chesney of Pomona, they represent four small southern colleges—Occidental,
Pomona, Southern Branch, and Cal. Tech.
The men who made the trip are: Southern Branch, Caress, Clark, and
Richardson; Occidental, Carter, Argue, Powers, Ellsworth, Spangler, Sloan.
Ridderhoff, Giffon, Fulton, and Goodenough; Pomona, Handley, Smith, Daggs,
Maxwell, Curtis, Frisbie, Morgan, Eaton, and Edwards; Cal. Tech., Gardner.
Advance reports indicate that the southerners have a strong aggregation
which is capable of giving the Cards stiff competition in their last workout

before the Big Meet next Saturday.
Argue Favored in Sprints
Cliff Argue of Occidental, ten flat
man in the hundred-yard dash, is fa
vored to lead the Stanford sprinters to
the tape. l)aggs and Smith of Pomona
are consistent 0:10 1-5 runners and
may figure in the point column. Pow
ers of Occidental is another good
sprinter.
Spangler of Occidental is considered
second only to Martz, the U.S.C. flash
in the south, as a 440 man. He has
been clocked in 0:49 4-5 this year and
should push Williamson and Judah to
the limit.
Falk is due to have his hands full
in the hurdles. Daggs of Pomona has
done 0:15 2-5 in the high sticks and
0:24 4-5 in the lows this year, with
Maxwell, his teammate, following close
behind him.
South Should Take Vault
Goodenough, the Occidental pole
vaulter, has cleared twelve feet and
with Bill Black out of the meet, may
be good for first place unless Dennis
and Scofield come through iu good
style.
Argue is the best all around man
on the squad. In addition to being the
best sprinter, he clears the bar at six
feet in the high jump and broad
jumps around twenty-two feet. He
should figure largely in the points
gathered by the southerners.
South Weak in Mile
They don't seem to grow distance
runners in the south. As was the case
with the U.S.C. team, an otherwise
strong squad is ruined by woeful weak
ness in the distances. Handley, who
won the mile here last year, has not
done better than 4:39 this year, and
With Elliott, and Thayer in
good form, he will be lucky to placp
if he doesn't beat this time.
Sloan of Occidental is the best bet
in the two-mile and as he is only good
for about 10:10, is not very dangerous
with Hayes running consistently under
ten minutes.
Cardinal stock for the Big Meet took
another jump upward yesterday when
Lynn Farish heaved the javelin 184
feet, six feet farther than he ever
threw it before yesterday afternoon.
He made three throws over the 180
mark and seems to have found him
self.
The meet tomorrow afternoon be
gins at 3:30.

feet, six feet farther than he ever
threw it before yesterday afternoon.
He made three throws over the 180
mark and seems to have found him
self.
The meet tomorrow afternoon be
gins at 3:30.
Twenty-three track athletes, the pick of sunny southern California, arrived
on the campus today to do battle with "Dink" Templeton's squad on the local
oval tomorrow afternoon. Coached by Joe Pipal of Occidental and Harry
Chesney of Pomona, they represent four small southern colleges—Occidental,
Pomona, Southern Branch, and Cal. Tech.
The men who made the trip are: Southern Branch, Caress, Clark, and
Richardson; Occidental, Carter, Argue, Powers, Ellsworth, Spangler, Sloan.
Ridderhoff, Giffon, Fulton, and Goodenough; Pomona, Handley, Smith, Daggs,
Maxwell, Curtis, Frisbie, Morgan, Eaton, and Edwards; Cal. Tech., Gardner.
Advance reports indicate that the southerners have a strong aggregation
which is capable of giving the Cards stiff competition in their last workout

before the Big Meet next Saturday.
Argue Favored in Sprints
Cliff Argue of Occidental, ten flat
man in the hundred-yard dash, is fa
vored to lead the Stanford sprinters to
the tape. l)aggs and Smith of Pomona
are consistent 0:10 1-5 runners and
may figure in the point column. Pow
ers of Occidental is another good
sprinter.
Spangler of Occidental is considered
second only to Martz, the U.S.C. flash
in the south, as a 440 man. He has
been clocked in 0:49 4-5 this year and
should push Williamson and Judah to
the limit.
Falk is due to have his hands full
in the hurdles. Daggs of Pomona has
done 0:15 2-5 in the high sticks and
0:24 4-5 in the lows this year, with
Maxwell, his teammate, following close
behind him.
South Should Take Vault
Goodenough, the Occidental pole
vaulter, has cleared twelve feet and
with Bill Black out of the meet, may
be good for first place unless Dennis
and Scofield come through iu good
style.
Argue is the best all around man
on the squad. In addition to being the
best sprinter, he clears the bar at six
feet in the high jump and broad
jumps around twenty-two feet. He
should figure largely in the points
gathered by the southerners.
South Weak in Mile
They don't seem to grow distance
runners in the south. As was the case
with the U.S.C. team, an otherwise
strong squad is ruined by woeful weak
ness in the distances. Handley, who
won the mile here last year, has not
done better than 4:39 this year, and
With Elliott, and Thayer in
good form, he will be lucky to placp
if he doesn't beat this time.
Sloan of Occidental is the best bet
in the two-mile and as he is only good
for about 10:10, is not very dangerous
with Hayes running consistently under
ten minutes.
Cardinal stock for the Big Meet took
another jump upward yesterday when
Lynn Farish heaved the javelin 184
feet, six feet farther than he ever
threw it before yesterday afternoon.
He made three throws over the 180
mark and seems to have found him
self.
