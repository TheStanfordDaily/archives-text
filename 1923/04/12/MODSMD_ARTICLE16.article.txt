# GOLF TEAM WILL MEET CALIFORNIA APRIL 20
## 
### 
After various unsuccessful attempts
to get together last quarter, the Stan
ford and California golf teams will
meet at the Burlingame Country Club
links on Friday, April 20«. The tourna
ment will be played between six-man
teams, and the Stanford team will be
selected from the present squad of
Captain Cecil Putnam, "Fritz" Ditzler;
Sidney Keuren, Charles Hovey, Lee
Miller, Paul Pigott, Reginald Hirsch
man, and Don Carlos Hines.
Through the courtesy of the Bur
lingame club the entire squad has been
given associate memberships, and op
portunities for practice will not be so
limited hereafter. The squad will go
to Burlingame Saturday morning for
practice before the California matches.
Manager Miller recently received an
invitation to compete in the Pacific
Intercollegiate Golf Tournament at
Portland in May. The golf budget,
however, is so small that the trip can
not be financed. This is doubly un
fortunate, in that no California univer
sity will be represented, and that
Stanford would have an excellent
chance of coming out on top. Ditzler,
a freshman, is one of the most promis
ing young golfers in the state, and re
cently came close to tying the ama
teur record for the Burlingame course.
Captain Putnam and Sid Van Keuren
are men of the highest college golf
caliber, and the rest of the team is
not far behind.
The team intends to attempt the
trip to Portland, somehow. Assistance
from any alumnus who is a golf en
thusiast, or any means of making the
excursion would be greatly appreci
ated.
