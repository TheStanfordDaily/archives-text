# NEVERS PUTS SPEAR 147 FEET IN FIRST PRACTICE EVENT
## 
### 
Something which promises to bol
ster up the weakness of the freshman
track team's field events cropped up
recently when Ernie Nevers threw
the javelin a distance of 147 feet in
the first practice heave of his life.
Prior to the big boy's performance,
the javelin was conceded to Califor
nia, but with practice up until the
meet, Nevers should be able to come
in with some strong opposition.
Nevers also puts the shot, but due
to his position as pitcher on the fresh
man nine he has not had consistent
workouts in this event.
The California weight men are
throwing the javelin 165 feet, and put
ting the 12-pound shot around 45 feet.
These are better distances than the
Cardinal heavers have been able to
reach, but "Dink" Templeton believes
that under the strain of stronger com
petition his men will show up better.
In the discus there are several men
who have been inconsistent in their
distances, to date. Wankowski, for
example, has twirled the discus 116
feet in practice but in meets he fails
to place at 110 feet.
