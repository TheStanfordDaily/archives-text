# LONDON QUARTET TO PLAY PRIZE MUSIC BY WALDO WARNER
## 
### 
"Pixy Ring," a prize composition
â€¢written by H. Waldo Warner, violinist
in the London String Quartet, will be
included in a concert program in the
Assembly hall this evening at 8:15,
when the famous English artists will
give a last Pacific Coast performance
before sailing for Honolulu.
Mr. Warner won a $1000 award with
this composition at the Berkshire fes
tival in 1921. At their previous con
cert two years ago, the musicians
played one number of .this fairy suite
as an encore, but the present program
includes the entire work.
Beethoven selections will be among
the classical numbers and it is said
that the quartet is equally famous for
its interpretation of this difficult com
poser and for its rendition of modern
works. In England the Beethoven
series, as played lately by these art
ists, was considered one of the musical
events of the year.
The quartet will sail in a few days
for Hawaii, where a special fund is
raised each season in order to secure
six concerts by this organization.
