# FORTUNATE WARNING
## 
### 
Nothing' but good fortune has prevented Stanford
from numerous disastrous fires. The small damage
caused yesterday by two blazes ought to serve as a
warning against the growing carelessness on the
part of students in the indiscriminate discarding of
burning cigarettes. Nowhere is less concern shown
over the probable results of such action than on a
college campus.
It is true that the efforts of the Stanford fire
department under Marshal Ed Lamb have reduced
the fire hazard considerably by cleaning up danger
ous spots on the campus and by improving the effi
ciency of the department in answering calls, but no
carefully-laid plans can reduce materially the possi
bility of a serious conflagration unless students
themselves exercise a little discretion.
