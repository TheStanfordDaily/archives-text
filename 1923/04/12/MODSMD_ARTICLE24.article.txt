# NEW STAFF MEMBERS

### 
After a tryout period of one week, ten new mem
bers have been added to the Daily Palo Alto re
portorial staff. The almost uniform ability and en
thusiasm displayed by the twenty-five tryoutees
made a fair choice particularly difficult, and it is
inevitable that there will be some who feel that
injustice has been done. In the final selection,
quality was judged before quantity, which accounts
for the absence of the names of some who deserved
appointment if hard work and time were the only
criterion.
The five men and five women who become metn
ibers of the staff today are, in alphabetical order:
Marjorie Allen, '26, of Los Angeles; Richard An
gell, '26, of Portland, Oregon; A. Grove Day, '26,
•of Philadelphia; Esther Greenacre, '26, of Greeley,
Colorado; Jack Ilardy, '26, of Los Angeles; Peggy
Lee, '26, of Stanford University; Barbara Miller,
'24, of Los Angeles; Margaret McDowell, '26, of
Ashland, Ohio; Edwin Roodhouse, '26, of Alham
bra; and Herbert Sommer, '26, of San Francisco.
The new re|x>rters will meet with the old mem
bers of the staff at the regular meeting in the Daily
