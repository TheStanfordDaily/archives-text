# THE 						VOCATIONAL CONFERENCE
## 
### 
Dean Yost, speaking informally this week to a
student committee, said that one of the biggest prob
lems discussed at a conference of some 12,000 edu
cational leaders last month was the question of pro
viding competent teachers for the next generation.
Teaching, far from being the only respectable oc
cupation open to women, must now offer real in
ducements to compete successfully with other voca
tions.
These special opportunities in the field of teach
ing will be the main topic to be discussed at the
sixth annual vocational conference which will be
held on the campus next Saturday. The speakers
are women who have themselves had an important
part in developing special activities in connection
with school work. They will bring to the college
woman who has only the narrow, conventional con
cept of teaching new ideas and ideals of the profes
sion.
The majority of women entering Stanford are be
wildered at the necessity of choosing a vocation;
they are familiar with few lines of work and do not
know how to discover new ones. For this reason
the annual vocational conferences are held to give
them a perspective on the openings in business and
professional occupations. Following the usual cus
tom, a questionnaire was circulated among the wo
men students to find the subjects in which they were
most interested; the meetings Saturday, therefore,
will be devoted to special activities connected with
school work, with banking and with business enter
prises.
