# CABBAGES and THINGS
## OUT OF THE FRYING PAN 
### 
(A Play from Life)
Scene: The dining room of the Notta Bita Eta Chap
ter, at Blase University. The sisters are gathered to
gether to discuss the chances they will be taking by
pledging some —or all —of the rushes. The house mana
ger is pulling her nightly farce-comedy entitled "Din
ner."
Maybell: But we must have them. I, for one, don't
intend paying any such board bills any longer. You
can't run a house on a shoe-string.
Annabelle: Some of those steaks you give us makes
one think you are doing it. (Maybelle is house manager;
Annabelle wishes she had the job.)
Claribelle: Oh, dears, let's not fight. Now, what
do you thing of Sally? She's a dear; such sweet ways,
and dresses so well. I love her.
Annabelle: I don't. She's affected. Sweet, indeed!
That's all sugar-coating.
Arabelle: Well, just because you never give anybody
a good word! I think Sally is a trifle affected, but
(very generously) we all are. I'm affected, and you're
affected, and we're all affected.
Annabelle: Yes, and your head's affected.
Maybelle: This isn't making our board bills any
lighter. I vote for Sally.
Floribella (Emerging from newspaper she has been
reading): So do I. Who is it?
Annabella: Well, since we're all affected (giving sis
ter Arabelle a dirty look) I guess one more won't count.
I'll vote for her too. Poor girl!
Claribelle: And the next vict —I mean, the next
rushee is Ruth. Is she acceptable?
Florabelle: I ding her. She has red hair. (Settles
back into newspaper.)
Maybelle: You creature! (Maybelle has auburn hair
herself.)
Arabelle: Now, dears! Florabelle, you know Ruth
is the one with the Speedo coupe; her father is in oil,
she says.
Florabelle (Comes out from newspaper): Why, I
know it, and I'm strong for her. I thought you were
discussing—some one else. Ho hum. I'm so inattentive.

Annabelle: I think she is horrid. . . . well, I mean.
I think she has some faults we can overcome. I don't
quite like a girl that says the reason she doesn't read
the Police Gazette is because it doesn't go well with her
red hair! But this, I think, can be easily overcome.
Florabelle: Yes, easily. Have the Police Gazette
printed 011 white paper, for instance.
Claribelle: Well, now that Ruth is settled. . . .
Florabelle: I'll say she is!
Claribelle: Order! As 1 was saying, the next rushee
is Mary. You all remember Mary. She's the little devil
who startled the house so by smoking at our first tea.
Florabelle: Startled the house? I'll say she did. Old
Mills! Can you tie that? Nothing cheaper—unless she
had pulled some Bull Durham out of her vanity bag.
Claribella: But she's doing better. It's all Turkish
with her, now.
Annabelle: Why all the talk? She's too obvious!
Arabelle (Realizing her opportunity): But, my dear,
we all are. I'm obvious, and you're obvious, and we're
all obvious.
Claribelle, Maybelle, Annabelle, and Florabelle: NO
WE'RE NOT.
Annabelle: I'm hungry. Do we have artichokes for
dinner?
Claribelle: Order. Of course not. We had them last
month. Does anyone want to say anything more about
Mary?
Florabelle: Maybelle, you'd better see that we get
her, so you can check up on her dates with Jack.
Maybelle: Oh, damn Jack! If she wants him she can
have him.
Florabelle: That's what she claims, all right.
Annabelle: Did you notice what a perfectly awful
dress that Lillie woman had on at the tea yesterday?
It had short panels, trimmed in tulle, with a row of
little red beads around the sleeves. And her hat

I think she has some faults we can overcome. I don't
quite like a girl that says the reason she doesn't read
the Police Gazette is because it doesn't go well with her
red hair! But this, I think, can be easily overcome.
Florabelle: Yes, easily. Have the Police Gazette
printed 011 white paper, for instance.
Claribelle: Well, now that Ruth is settled. . . .
Florabelle: I'll say she is!
Claribelle: Order! As 1 was saying, the next rushee
is Mary. You all remember Mary. She's the little devil
who startled the house so by smoking at our first tea.
Florabelle: Startled the house? I'll say she did. Old
Mills! Can you tie that? Nothing cheaper—unless she
had pulled some Bull Durham out of her vanity bag.
Claribella: But she's doing better. It's all Turkish
with her, now.
Annabelle: Why all the talk? She's too obvious!
Arabelle (Realizing her opportunity): But, my dear,
we all are. I'm obvious, and you're obvious, and we're
all obvious.
Claribelle, Maybelle, Annabelle, and Florabelle: NO
WE'RE NOT.
Annabelle: I'm hungry. Do we have artichokes for
dinner?
Claribelle: Order. Of course not. We had them last
month. Does anyone want to say anything more about
Mary?
Florabelle: Maybelle, you'd better see that we get
her, so you can check up on her dates with Jack.
Maybelle: Oh, damn Jack! If she wants him she can
have him.
Florabelle: That's what she claims, all right.
Annabelle: Did you notice what a perfectly awful
dress that Lillie woman had on at the tea yesterday?
It had short panels, trimmed in tulle, with a row of
little red beads around the sleeves. And her hat

Scene: The dining room of the Notta Bita Eta Chap

gether to discuss the chances they will be taking by
pledging some —or all —of the rushes. The house mana
ger is pulling her nightly farce-comedy entitled "Din

Maybell: But we must have them. I, for one, don't
intend paying any such board bills any longer. You
can't run a house on a shoe-string.
Annabelle: Some of those steaks you give us makes
one think you are doing it. (Maybelle is house manager;
Annabelle wishes she had the job.)
Claribelle: Oh, dears, let's not fight. Now, what
do you thing of Sally? She's a dear; such sweet ways,
and dresses so well. I love her.
Annabelle: I don't. She's affected. Sweet, indeed!
That's all sugar-coating.
Arabelle: Well, just because you never give anybody
a good word! I think Sally is a trifle affected, but
(very generously) we all are. I'm affected, and you're
affected, and we're all affected.
Annabelle: Yes, and your head's affected.
Maybelle: This isn't making our board bills any
lighter. I vote for Sally.
Floribella (Emerging from newspaper she has been
reading): So do I. Who is it?
Annabella: Well, since we're all affected (giving sis
ter Arabelle a dirty look) I guess one more won't count.
I'll vote for her too. Poor girl!
Claribelle: And the next vict —I mean, the next
rushee is Ruth. Is she acceptable?
Florabelle: I ding her. She has red hair. (Settles
back into newspaper.)
Maybelle: You creature! (Maybelle has auburn hair
herself.)
Arabelle: Now, dears! Florabelle, you know Ruth
is the one with the Speedo coupe; her father is in oil,
she says.
Florabelle (Comes out from newspaper): Why, I
know it, and I'm strong for her. I thought you were
discussing—some one else. Ho hum. I'm so inattentive.
