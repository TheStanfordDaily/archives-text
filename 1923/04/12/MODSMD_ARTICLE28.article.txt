# Rough's Roost
## THE 						ARTISTS AT PLAY 
### 
(What Cornell has done to solve the problem of a common
meeting place for men is set forth in the following editorial.
It resembles the local plans for converting the Cafeteria into
a Rough's Roost in every respect save one; there it is on
actuality, here, merely an idea.)
One of the most attractive features of the Coffee
House, since its inception, was the plan to decorate the
walls, in conformity with the practice laid down in
similar rooms in many other universities. Although it
appeared for a time that the scheme had been aban
doned, the Campus artists have come to the rescue
with a colorful and attractive series of masterpieces
which add enormously to the atmosphere of the place,
the importance of which can hardly be overestimated.
The Coffee House would seem to be a permanent in
stitution. It is not a competitor of the Johnny Parson
Club, nor will it be one of the Union. The numbers
who patronize it attest to its popularity. Recently, it
was even characterized as the only place at Cornell
where students ever gathered for intellectual or pseudo
intellectual conversation. Various professors have taken
to frequenting it, holding court after the manner of
Milton, of Dr. Johnson, and of Coleridge.
The true "Coffee House" atmosphere is one of «emi
darkness, of sanded floors, clay pipes, and decorated
wiills. Some of these features can well be neglected;
others it were a pity to leave uncompleted. Among
these latter are the drawings on the walls. It is gratify
ing that the artistic abilities of past undergraduates,
expressed in a characteristic and suitable form, should
continue to add to the interest, as well asito the appear
ance of the Cornell Coffee House.—Cornell Sun.
