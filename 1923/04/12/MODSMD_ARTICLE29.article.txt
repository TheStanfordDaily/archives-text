# Stanford Audience
## An Answer to "Stanford Stage" 
### 
Yes, Will Shakespeare failed to reg
ister with the audience, despite the
fact that those who played it did their
utmost in an attempt to put it over.
And to hep the players in their inter
pretations were the settings of sug
gestive grace, beauty, and pathos.
Will Shakespeare is a brilliant work
of creative imagination, combining an
atmosphere of Elizabethan days with
the action of every day life that is
very real. And to a well-modeled set
ting, by means of long poetical speech
es and blank verse, is given life, a
kind of life that is hard to under
stand. Perhaps Will Shakespeare and
his contemporaries did talk in blank
verse, and did make long poetical
speeches. Certain it is .they did not
talk in the short, "snappy" slang and
short-cut methods we use today. They
were not in frenzied haste to get any
where first. It was not the play, then,
that was at fault.
The only thing left is the audience.
Our day is a day of "movies," in
which there must be rapid action, con
spiring plots, and brilliant feats of
attainment. So now, the college stu
dent is educated to the "movie" level.
No wonder the audience questions, and
doubts; "How does he get that way?"
or, "Did human ever talk so?" No
wonder the audience could see nothing
but the surface, and wanted dramatic
relief to pull them from the depths
into which they had been drawn.
The sad thing is, that the student
body of a university ought to appreci
ate, and can appreciate, good drama.
It is not so much the fault of the audi
ence, however, as it is theNage in
which we live. The "movie" is cheap,
and is always going. The student gets
more "movie" than he does good
drama, so he forgets how to appreci
ate good drama. His tastes are culti
vated to conform to the age.
All this is merely an explanation of

why Will Shakespeare failed to regis
ter.
Annabelle Lee said that the campus
is not ready for the "highbrow" type
of play. But will it ever be ready? Not
if dramatics take the turn that Anna
belle suggests they must in order to
fill the house.
Let the student put on the light
stuff. The dramatics department will
probably not change the type of play;
nor will interest in dramatics die out.
Stanford stage has set a high ideal
of drama to follow, and it should not
lower that ideal in order to fill the
house. I am glad that Clemence Dane
did not stoop to make an Elizabethan

atmosphere, over into an atmosphere
that a full house can enjoy.
Impossible though it seem, let us
hope that some day by diligent culti
vation the audience can be brought to
a taste for good drama.

where first. It was not the play, then,
that was at fault.
The only thing left is the audience.
Our day is a day of "movies," in
which there must be rapid action, con
spiring plots, and brilliant feats of
attainment. So now, the college stu
dent is educated to the "movie" level.
No wonder the audience questions, and
doubts; "How does he get that way?"
or, "Did human ever talk so?" No
wonder the audience could see nothing
but the surface, and wanted dramatic
relief to pull them from the depths
into which they had been drawn.
The sad thing is, that the student
body of a university ought to appreci
ate, and can appreciate, good drama.
It is not so much the fault of the audi
ence, however, as it is theNage in
which we live. The "movie" is cheap,
and is always going. The student gets
more "movie" than he does good
drama, so he forgets how to appreci
ate good drama. His tastes are culti
vated to conform to the age.
All this is merely an explanation of

why Will Shakespeare failed to regis
ter.
Annabelle Lee said that the campus
is not ready for the "highbrow" type
of play. But will it ever be ready? Not
if dramatics take the turn that Anna
belle suggests they must in order to
fill the house.
Let the student put on the light
stuff. The dramatics department will
probably not change the type of play;
nor will interest in dramatics die out.
Stanford stage has set a high ideal
of drama to follow, and it should not
lower that ideal in order to fill the
house. I am glad that Clemence Dane
did not stoop to make an Elizabethan

atmosphere, over into an atmosphere
that a full house can enjoy.
Impossible though it seem, let us
hope that some day by diligent culti
vation the audience can be brought to
a taste for good drama.

Yes, Will Shakespeare failed to reg
ister with the audience, despite the
fact that those who played it did their
utmost in an attempt to put it over.
And to hep the players in their inter
pretations were the settings of sug
gestive grace, beauty, and pathos.
Will Shakespeare is a brilliant work
of creative imagination, combining an
atmosphere of Elizabethan days with
the action of every day life that is
very real. And to a well-modeled set
ting, by means of long poetical speech
es and blank verse, is given life, a
kind of life that is hard to under
stand. Perhaps Will Shakespeare and
his contemporaries did talk in blank
verse, and did make long poetical
speeches. Certain it is .they did not
talk in the short, "snappy" slang and
short-cut methods we use today. They
were not in frenzied haste to get any
where first. It was not the play, then,
that was at fault.
