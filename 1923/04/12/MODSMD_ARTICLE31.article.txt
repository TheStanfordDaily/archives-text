# ALPHA DELTA PHI DOWNS CHI PSI INTRAMURAL NINE
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi easily defeated the
Chi Psi baseball team 20-1 on the En
cina field yesterday afternoon in a
five-inning game. Sequoia Hall second
team won from the Encina Hall third
team 12-6 in a seven-inning contest.
The Alpha Delta Phi team started
their game by retiring the Chi Psi
batters in one-two-three order. But
they were not so easily disposed of
themselves and fourteen runs had ac
cumulated with only one out. However,
Ditzler, freshman hurler, appeared on
the scene in time to put a stop to the
slaughter and no more runs were
scored until the third frame when the
Alpha Delta Phi batters hammered
out three more runs, followed by an
other trio in the fourth inning.
Chi Psi scored their lone run in the
fourth inning after Ditzler got on base
when hit by a pitched ball. He stole
second and third and ran home on an
overthrow from the catcher to third.
Loomis pitched good ball and was J
unhittable for three innings, getting
nine strikeouts in that time. Dennis
crashed out a home run in the fourth
inning, the first one of the intramural
season.
The Japanese Club forfeited their
scheduled game with Delta Chi, due

to their inability to get seven men
who could play ball. The Delta Chi
team played a practice game with
Kappa Alpha on the old soccer field,
winning by a nice margin.
Sequoia Hall played a fast game of
ball and fook their game from Encina
Hall without much difficulty. The
Encina men had had little practice.
Lickey, the Encina pitcher, weakened
somewhat during the game but with
some good fielding at short and third
managed to get away with only two
runs scored against him in each of the
last two innings.
Morrison, pitching for Sequoia,
showed considerable ability, and with
the support accorded him, was able to
prevent a single score until the fifth
inning. He allowed three in the sixth
and one in the seventh but at no time
was his lead threatened.
