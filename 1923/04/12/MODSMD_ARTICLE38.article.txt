# U.C. STUDENT PERFORMS SECOND DANGEROUS STUNT
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA â€”
Elected as a charter member of the
"Safety Last Club," F. C. Klingamen,
at the university Farm, furnished the
main attraction for the university
Farm Stunt Day by standing on his
hands on the top of a two hundred
foot water tank.
Over a year ago Klingamen walked
to the edge of the Campanile on his
hands as an attraction for the stadium
drive. Standing on his hands on top
of the water tank was deemed even
more dangerous than his feat on the
Campanile because of a sheer drop of
200 feet from the top of the water
tank.
