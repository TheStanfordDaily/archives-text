BERKELEY, Cal., April 12, 1923 —
Stanford's freshman tennis team will
meet some real competition when they
play the California babes on the Uni
versity of California courts next Fri-:
day morning. The 1926 team has one
of the strongest freshman combina
tions that has been turned out for
some time.
Although the prep school teams
boasted of some of the best jtlnior
players in the bay cities, the freshman
team succeeded in taking 15 out of 19
matches played. These teams, with
one exception, were all defeated in
the absence of Bud Chandler, who was i
on the shelf with a bad leg.
Captain Bud Chandler is the most
formidable player on the 1926 squad
and at present is holder of the Bay
cities junior singles title. An infected
foot kept him out of most of the sea
son's matches but in his match against
Periolet of Polytechnic high school
last Saturday he proved to be just as
steady a player as ever.
Jack Stauf's smashing style of play
rates him second to Chandler and is
one of the best men on the squad. 1
Burke, Hyde, Jacobs, and Heber com-j
plete the combination of freshmen. All
the above-mentioned men have earned
places on the team by constant com-1
petition and are slated to play Friday
against the Cardinal babes.
