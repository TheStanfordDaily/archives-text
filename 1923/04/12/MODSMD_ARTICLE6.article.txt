# BABE BATMEN READY FOR CALIFORNIA NINE
## 
### 
The freshman ball players are
straining every nerve to get their bat
ting eyes in shape for the second fray
with the California Babes Saturday
morning on the campus. And because
there are fifteen men on the squad and
each one a possible choice for the
game Saturday, there has been 110
loafing and consequently there will be
no stiff arms or muscles at the start
of the second round of the series.
Even on Monday, when it rained,
Nevers and Oviatt worked out in the
gymnasium with Kohler catching the
shoots. Coach "Husky" Hunt is tak
ing no chances on being caught short
of pitching material and his three
hurlers, Oviatt, Nevers, and Ditzler,
are all keeping their arms limbered
up, ready to start the game against
the Bruin babes. With all three men
prepared to take the mound, the coach
is waiting until game time to an
nounce his choice of twirlers for the
day.
No practice games were scheduled
for this week. Instead Hunt decided to
put his men through a series of prac
tice sessions which would give them
a more thorough workout.
The California players have the edge
on the yearlings as far as percentages
go, but the confidence of the 1926
team is just as much intact as when it
went onto the diamond a week ago at
Berkeley. The players feel certain
that they will take the second game
of the series, particularly since it is
on their own grounds. And they expect
to hit in this contest, something they
failed to do against their opponents
last Saturday. Nevers pitched a fine
game then, especially after the first
inning. The best pitching and fielding
cannot produce a victory unless there
is some safe hitting along with it.
