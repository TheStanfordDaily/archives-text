# TWO MINOR BLAZES AFFORD TEST OF NEW FIRE FIGHTING TRUCK
## 
### 
Promptly at 3:21 yesterday after
noon a few leaves of Mr. Green's
smokeless tobacco became sprinkled
over the K. A. roof. A telephone call
to Fire Marshal Ed Lamb brought the
desired results, and the chief gaso
lined swiftly up the Row with a Pied
Piper effect. During the interim the
outraged inhabitans had been busy
with various soothing devices, and the
new six-cylinder Seagrave truck ar
rived on the scene only to find a
charred and gaping hole in the roof.
The total damage, as covered by in
surance, will not exceed $25. The sen
timental value attached to certain
brotherly rugs, Pullman-car plush bath
robes, comforters, and bed-spreads
which were ruined in smothering the
flames is beyond estimation.
Scarcely has the brigade ceased puf
fing after the strenuous exertion when
word came that an automobile was
burning over near Toyon hall. The
chief promptly accepted the challenge
and motored over with all haste. A
few dashes of chemical served to sub
due the flames which were eating into
a Haynes touring car, and the fire was
squelched after considerable damage
had been done. The top was entirely
burned away and the upholstery was
badly scorched.
Fire Marshal Lamb is at a loss to
account for the second blaze, but it is
thought that some abstracted student
tossed a cigaret into the car while it
was passing beneath his window. Anti
cigaret papers please copy.
