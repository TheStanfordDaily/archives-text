# CARD. BRUIN NINES TANGLE SATURDAY IN SECOND MATCH
## Stanford Victory a Good Bet If Pitchers Come Back to Old Form; Lineup Same 
### Bill Wright, '25 
After a decisive defeat in the open
ing game of the Stanford-California
series, the Cardinal varsity nine will
go into the second contest Saturday
with a shade less confidence and quite
a bit more determination. This shift of
mood is perhaps the best thing that
could happen to the team, and fans
about the Quad may renew their op
timism.
Without opening any inquests into
the encounter of April 7, it may be
stated that the pitching staff had a
decidedly off day. This same pitching
staff reminds one of the little girl in
the song—when they are good they
are very, very good, but when they're
bad they're horrid. Coach Wolter says
that, taken as a lump, it was the worst
game his squad has turned out this
season, and a reversal of form should
certainly take place by day after to
morrow. Wolter said last week that he
thought Stanford would win the series
by a close margin, and he still thinks
so. At any rate, it should be a Cardinal
come-back, and is certain to be well
worth watching.
Bowen Needs Watching
The teams have learned just enough
about each other to make the game
interesting. Bowen, the California left
fielder, will be watched as closely as
an ex-convict in Tiffany's. He made
four hits and a sacrifice for a perfect
batting average last week, and he
won't do it again if the Cards can
help it. Captain Hermle and Thompson
have also shown themselves to be
more than usually dangerous in a
pinch. "Shorty" Roberts especially will
be treated with great respect by the
Bruin hurlers.
Milton Teague or Fred Solomon will
start the game Saturday, with "Fat"
Clark on his toes in case the murk
becomes too dense for them. Accord
ing to the law of averages and the
proved pitching ability of these men
he should not be necessary, but he'll
be there. A1 Lowenstein is still suck
ing a clinical thermometer from time
to time, so California's "murderers'
row" will have to wait a while longer
before they can be slow-balled to
death. Both Teague and Solomon
should .have the old arm doing ten flat
this week, though the fact of a pitch
er's being "right" or not lies under no
systematic principle.
Patterson to Catch
It goes without saying that Patter
son will welcome the shoots of which
ever pitcher Coach Wolter decides on.
Pat looks better behind the plate
every time, and seemed to have caught
a mean stride in hitting until Kelley
came along and eased the team down
with five blows. You can't keep a good
man down, and Pat is due for a bingle
or so next Saturday.
Woodward will naturally be found
at first. "Bud" showed lots of good
headwork when he made Stanford's
last run as a guest of the California
| team, and is a hard man to duplicate.
