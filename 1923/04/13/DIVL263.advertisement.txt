Whether it be a 4-button, conservative Brooks model; or the new lower-waisted Norfolk, I
loosely comfortable; or a carelessly distinctive sport model for semi-dress and later (after •
3 o'clock!) for Golf and general outdooring:—a Roos Spring Suit has all those "trifles"
of selected fabrics, unusually good tailoring, and special refinements in construction which ,
make up the "perfection" of a well-fitting, becoming Suit that is thoroughly dependable,

satisfaction. Dress Up for Spring!
