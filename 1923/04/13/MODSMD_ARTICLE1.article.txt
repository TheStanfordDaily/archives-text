# CARDS, BEARS MEET IN FIVE SPORTS
## VARSITY, FRESHMEN CROSS BATS WITH BRUIN BALL TEAM Wolter's Squad Mixes With Blue and Gold Nine at 3:30; Yearlings Meet California at 10:30 CARDINAL HURLERS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE FOR HARD BATTLE 
### Bill Wright, '25 
The Stanford varsity nine will go to
bat against the Bruin baseballers to
morrow afternoon at 3 :30 with the de
termination to win or be carried off the
field. California is coming down here
with the same object, and the result
should be a game worth going miles to
see.
The first game of the series last Sat
urday was slowed up by the fact that
rainy weather made practice impossible
until the day before the contest. Charg
ing the ineffectiveness of the Cardinal
twirlers up against that condition, the
climate during the past week should put
them on their mettle. Games are apt to
be a trifle one-sided when the strong
pitching and heavy batting is done by
the same team, and it was that way last
week.
Wolter Drills Hitters
Coach Harry Wolter has been drilling
his men intensively at the bat, and the
Cardinal should be good for more than
live bits tomorrow. It can hardly be
said that buck fever was the cause of
last week's batting slump, as four of the
live hits were bounced out by sopho
mores. Practically the entire team hit
a slugging streak during the U. S. C.
series, and it is very likely to be resumed
tomorrow.
Solomon or Teague will start the game
on the hillock. Solomon has a world
of speed and some fancy hooks, and is a
hard pitcher to hit when he is going
right. Teague pitches more with his
head than with his fingers, and has a
higher batting average than most hurlcrs.
Barring an off day, either of these men
could beat California if given proper
support.
Line-Up Unchanged
The rest of the team will be unchanged
from last week. The only doubtful po
sition was around second base, and Wol
ter has announced that Captain Peavy
and Roberts will show. This affords a
steadier if less spectacular combination,
as these men will stop anything rea
sonable.
The California team seems to be shot
full of confidence. In a signed statement
early this week, Captain "Lefty" Hermle
said : "We are out to win three straight.
While we won the first game by a com
fortable margin, we are looking for a
close game Saturday. We have been de
pending on our hitting strength all sea
son to win games and if it is up to par
we will win again." It seems up to
the Stanford mound artists to keep Cali
fornia's hitting strength on a par with
the German mark."
