# BRUIN, CARD BABE TRACKSTERS MEET IN ANNUAL CINDER PATH CLASSIC ON OVAL TOMORROW
## 
### David Meiklejohn, '26 
What promises to be one of the closest meets in many years will be run off
tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 when California and Stanford freshman track
squads clash in the Little-Big Classic on the Stanford Oval.
Strong in practically every track event, but weak in the field events, the
Cardinal babes hope to upset the dope sufficiently in the latter department to
win the meet. California is granted first places in the shot-put, the discus,
broad-pump, and the pole>vault, but the Cards look forward to first places in
the remaining events with the possible exception of the javelin and high

jump, which will be close.
Cubs Strong in Weights
The Bear cubs enter the meet with
a balanced team which tends to be,
stronger in weight events, and dashes
than in the distances.
The half should be the feature event
of the afternoon. Bill Richardson of
Stanford, and Boyden of California,
both wonderful runners, will settle a
much disputed topic as to superiority.
Reports from Berkeley credit Boyden
with times under two minutes, while
Richardson has actual facts to back
him in his claim of 1:58 3-5. Captain
Richardson is expected to win; he haR
never exerted himself in the high
school meets and any extra speed he
possesses should carry him across the
tape a winner.
Hurdles to Be Close
Boles, in the hurdles, is an unknown
uuantity. His times on the average
excel those of Corley of California by
fifths of a second, hut Corley has been
clocked in the high hurdles in 15 2-6,
which is the best time Boles has made
this season.
Another close race will be the hun
dred-yard dash with Caspar running
for Stanford, and Barber for Cali
fornia. Caspar is at the height of his
form and Barber will have to travel
to win. It will be a close heat in the
two-twenty, also, with Caspar, Miller,
and Barber competing.
Cypher Out of Mile
Templeton expected his men to
place one-two-three in the mile, bnt
Clark Cypher, who usually follows
Bill Kerr to a second place, is out with
an injured foot. Two places seem al
most certain, however, Kerr and Clif
ford. Kerr has run the mile as low as
4:37 this season, while Orme, tbo
Berkeley miler, makes about 4:41.
