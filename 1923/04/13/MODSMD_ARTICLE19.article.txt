# WHAT OF THE YELL-LEADER?
## 
### 
Stanford rooting sections during the greater part
of the present year have been nothing short of dis
graceful. Repeated athletic setbacks, incompetent
yell leaders, competing influences—these are a few
of the reasons that have been given for that condi
tion. Students, displaying the human tendency to
blame someone else, have not often attributed the
poor showing to indifference* on their own part.
However, it must be admitted that even the best
yell leader cannot get results from a group that
fails to appear at rallies and jeers at his efforts.
Discarding any argument as to fitness for the
position, it cannot be denied that Veil Leader Minskv
has worked hard and has been given miserable sup
port. The students apparently considered their re
sponsibility ended after electing him to the position
last spring.
The attitude which has developed on the campus
during the last few years has reduced the position
to one of much less importance than at other uni
versities and at Stanford in the past. In an effort
to restore the former prestige of the yell leader and
to assure the election of a man who will be given
student support, Executive Committee today adopted
a plan which will go into effect immediately.
Under the new arrangement, the nominees will
not be limited to the two men chosen, often injudi
ciously, at bleacher rallies the previous year, but
will be extended to include the entire student-body.
The nominees must be approved by a rally commit
tee named by the Executive Committee, before ap
pearing for general election. The successful candi
date will then be free to choose his assistants for the
year from ten or more men passed by the rally com
mittee.
There is plenty of time between now and the
election for every student to formulate an opinion
as to the necessary qualities in a yell leader and to
pick a man who embodies those qualities. After
a wise choice has been made 011 the basis of both
personality and ability, it is to be hoped that the
rooters will stand by their own selection and give
support at athletic contests which is really worthy
of Stanford.
