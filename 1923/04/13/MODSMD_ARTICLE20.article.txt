# AN ATHLETIC FEAST
## 
### 
v This afternoon opens a busy period of sports for
both Stanford and California, which will culminate
in the Big - \feet at Berkeley a week from tomorrow.
Five contests with the traditional rivals from the
state university tomorrow ought to be sufficient in
ducement to keep every Stanford man and woman
on the campus for the week-end.
There is added attraction in the fact that for the
first time in the history of the present college
generation, the dope gives Stanford more than an
even break in the annual freshman track meet. The
first-year men from both universities have been
doing unusually good work and promise close com
petition in several events, with the almost certain
prospect of shattering a few existing freshman rec
ords.
