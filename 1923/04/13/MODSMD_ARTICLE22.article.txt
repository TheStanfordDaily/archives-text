Although it is one characteristic of a dramatic critic
to be politic, I cannot refrain from saying it is high
time intelligent people ceased calling impossible plays
highbrow. In the second paragraph of "Stanford Audi
ence" (each sentence of which contains some highly
edifying absurdity, about which I would talk at length
if opportunity offered), the author fliew wide of the
mark. What he should have said was that "Will Shakes
peare" was an imitation, not of Elizabethan days—the
idea of Shakespeare and his contemporaries "talking in
blank verse" and making "long poetical speeches" is
pure craziness—but of Elizabethan drama; and an imita
tion not only of Elizabethan drama, but of drama more
remote: of the Attic tragic poets. It is an example of
the poetic dramatic tradition that the present play will
have to be judged.
Now others of much greater genius than Clemence
Dane have tried to revive this tradition recently. Mase
fleld and Phillips have worked hard at it, and there are
few who would say they had succeeded.
I have never read anything more pathetic than that
moving line, "The only thing left is the audience." May
I suggest that it be made into some semblance of truth
by removing one word, "The only thing is the audience."
Your critic talks as though he would be highly delighted
should v Stanford stage" be presently found playing his
own pet brand of play to an empty house. Perhaps he
would; but aside from the fact that his remarks were
highly insulting to the audience on Friday last (which,
as has been observed was composed largely of faculty
members and their wives, and of Palo Altans —inciden-
tally precisely the people to appreciate good blank verse
plays), I would tell him that the instant the audience
leaves the house, the play ceases to be a play, and
becomes that peculiar hybrid, the closet-drama. And
this is, in fact, precisely what "Will Shakespeare" is.
Look at the cutting which had to be done; look at the
doubtful dramatic value of the last scene.
The interest in such revivals centers, of course, on the
acting. In this regard I can say veiy little more than
was said, and said admirably in the official review of
the play. So far as I know, there are only two import
ant dramatic styles with reference to blank verse; the
Bernhardt manner, and the Duse manner. (The ranting
style of the, Elizabethan period, from which Bernhardt
evolved hers, would have sent the audience from the
house in disgust). The acting done by Mr. Bentinok and
Mrs. Wallis was intensely interesting to me. Mr. Ben
tinck, as Shakespeare, gave body to the character and
life to otherwise impossible lines by perfect articulation
(I heard every word from the back of the house), and a
measured rhythmic intonation which he employed to
great effect by varying the tempo (instead of raising the
voice) in the more dramatic moments of the play. We
who linger on the outside to criticize and to build
"fusses" over impossible nothings, by no means appre
ciate the time and effort required to build up such a
method. We do not know what to look for, and the
good and bad fly over our unsuspecting heads indis
criminately. I call attention to this method of Mr.
Bentinck's, for, in my opinion, it is fundamentally the
Duse manner, and she has never been surpassed.
Mrs. Wallis, on the other hand, had an entirely dif
ferent method, best shown, I think, in the scene with
Shakespeare behind the wings of "Romeo and Juliet"
and in that in the tavern. Her dramatic method is
more abrupt, and depends more on contrasts. The fire
of the entrance after the last act of "Romeo and Juliet"
merging down fitfully into the calm depath of her final
lines in that scene was real acting, unfinished in some
spots, but nevertheless real acting. Her general style
on the stage seems to me to be foundd on the Bernhardt
manner.
The beautiful thing was to see the contrast between
the two principals work out in the play. If anything
could have made the play that would have.
Mr. Cohen did very clever work with a part much
mistreated by the author. He actually got entirely out
of himself and fooled me into not recognizing him.
which, also, is real acting.
But I am not writing to criticize the play, but to
criticize your critic, which is always delightful business.
The main point to his whole article is, apparently, that
undergraduates prefer going to the "movies" rather
than to "Will Shakespeare," and that they must be
educated out of this distressing state of mind.
Well, if your critic thinks that, I should like to see
him to the educating. —E. E. WALTON.

mistreated by the author. He actually got entirely out

But I am not writing to criticize the play, but to
criticize your critic, which is always delightful business.
The main point to his whole article is, apparently, that

Although it is one characteristic of a dramatic critic
to be politic, I cannot refrain from saying it is high
time intelligent people ceased calling impossible plays
highbrow. In the second paragraph of "Stanford Audi
ence" (each sentence of which contains some highly
edifying absurdity, about which I would talk at length
if opportunity offered), the author fliew wide of the
mark. What he should have said was that "Will Shakes
peare" was an imitation, not of Elizabethan days—the
idea of Shakespeare and his contemporaries "talking in
blank verse" and making "long poetical speeches" is
pure craziness—but of Elizabethan drama; and an imita
tion not only of Elizabethan drama, but of drama more
remote: of the Attic tragic poets. It is an example of
the poetic dramatic tradition that the present play will
have to be judged.
Now others of much greater genius than Clemence
Dane have tried to revive this tradition recently. Mase
fleld and Phillips have worked hard at it, and there are
few who would say they had succeeded.
I have never read anything more pathetic than that
moving line, "The only thing left is the audience." May
I suggest that it be made into some semblance of truth
by removing one word, "The only thing is the audience."
Your critic talks as though he would be highly delighted
should v Stanford stage" be presently found playing his
own pet brand of play to an empty house. Perhaps he
would; but aside from the fact that his remarks were
highly insulting to the audience on Friday last (which,
as has been observed was composed largely of faculty
members and their wives, and of Palo Altans —inciden-
tally precisely the people to appreciate good blank verse
plays), I would tell him that the instant the audience
leaves the house, the play ceases to be a play, and
becomes that peculiar hybrid, the closet-drama. And
this is, in fact, precisely what "Will Shakespeare" is.
Look at the cutting which had to be done; look at the
doubtful dramatic value of the last scene.
The interest in such revivals centers, of course, on the
acting. In this regard I can say veiy little more than
was said, and said admirably in the official review of
the play. So far as I know, there are only two import
ant dramatic styles with reference to blank verse; the
Bernhardt manner, and the Duse manner. (The ranting
style of the, Elizabethan period, from which Bernhardt
evolved hers, would have sent the audience from the
house in disgust). The acting done by Mr. Bentinok and
Mrs. Wallis was intensely interesting to me. Mr. Ben
tinck, as Shakespeare, gave body to the character and
life to otherwise impossible lines by perfect articulation
(I heard every word from the back of the house), and a
measured rhythmic intonation which he employed to
great effect by varying the tempo (instead of raising the
voice) in the more dramatic moments of the play. We
who linger on the outside to criticize and to build
"fusses" over impossible nothings, by no means appre
ciate the time and effort required to build up such a
method. We do not know what to look for, and the
good and bad fly over our unsuspecting heads indis
criminately. I call attention to this method of Mr.
Bentinck's, for, in my opinion, it is fundamentally the
Duse manner, and she has never been surpassed.
Mrs. Wallis, on the other hand, had an entirely dif
ferent method, best shown, I think, in the scene with
Shakespeare behind the wings of "Romeo and Juliet"
and in that in the tavern. Her dramatic method is
more abrupt, and depends more on contrasts. The fire
of the entrance after the last act of "Romeo and Juliet"
merging down fitfully into the calm depath of her final
lines in that scene was real acting, unfinished in some
spots, but nevertheless real acting. Her general style
on the stage seems to me to be foundd on the Bernhardt
manner.
The beautiful thing was to see the contrast between
the two principals work out in the play. If anything
could have made the play that would have.

criticize your critic, which is always delightful business.

Although it is one characteristic of a dramatic critic
to be politic, I cannot refrain from saying it is high
time intelligent people ceased calling impossible plays
highbrow. In the second paragraph of "Stanford Audi
ence" (each sentence of which contains some highly
edifying absurdity, about which I would talk at length
if opportunity offered), the author fliew wide of the
mark. What he should have said was that "Will Shakes
peare" was an imitation, not of Elizabethan days—the
idea of Shakespeare and his contemporaries "talking in
blank verse" and making "long poetical speeches" is
pure craziness—but of Elizabethan drama; and an imita
tion not only of Elizabethan drama, but of drama more
remote: of the Attic tragic poets. It is an example of
the poetic dramatic tradition that the present play will
have to be judged.
Now others of much greater genius than Clemence
Dane have tried to revive this tradition recently. Mase
fleld and Phillips have worked hard at it, and there are
few who would say they had succeeded.
I have never read anything more pathetic than that
moving line, "The only thing left is the audience." May
I suggest that it be made into some semblance of truth
by removing one word, "The only thing is the audience."
Your critic talks as though he would be highly delighted
should v Stanford stage" be presently found playing his
own pet brand of play to an empty house. Perhaps he
would; but aside from the fact that his remarks were
highly insulting to the audience on Friday last (which,
as has been observed was composed largely of faculty
members and their wives, and of Palo Altans —inciden-
tally precisely the people to appreciate good blank verse
plays), I would tell him that the instant the audience
leaves the house, the play ceases to be a play, and
becomes that peculiar hybrid, the closet-drama. And
this is, in fact, precisely what "Will Shakespeare" is.
Look at the cutting which had to be done; look at the
doubtful dramatic value of the last scene.
The interest in such revivals centers, of course, on the
acting. In this regard I can say veiy little more than
was said, and said admirably in the official review of
the play. So far as I know, there are only two import
ant dramatic styles with reference to blank verse; the
Bernhardt manner, and the Duse manner. (The ranting
style of the, Elizabethan period, from which Bernhardt
evolved hers, would have sent the audience from the
house in disgust). The acting done by Mr. Bentinok and
Mrs. Wallis was intensely interesting to me. Mr. Ben
tinck, as Shakespeare, gave body to the character and
life to otherwise impossible lines by perfect articulation
(I heard every word from the back of the house), and a
measured rhythmic intonation which he employed to
great effect by varying the tempo (instead of raising the
voice) in the more dramatic moments of the play. We
who linger on the outside to criticize and to build
"fusses" over impossible nothings, by no means appre
ciate the time and effort required to build up such a
method. We do not know what to look for, and the
good and bad fly over our unsuspecting heads indis
criminately. I call attention to this method of Mr.
Bentinck's, for, in my opinion, it is fundamentally the
Duse manner, and she has never been surpassed.
Mrs. Wallis, on the other hand, had an entirely dif
ferent method, best shown, I think, in the scene with
Shakespeare behind the wings of "Romeo and Juliet"
and in that in the tavern. Her dramatic method is
more abrupt, and depends more on contrasts. The fire
of the entrance after the last act of "Romeo and Juliet"
merging down fitfully into the calm depath of her final
lines in that scene was real acting, unfinished in some
spots, but nevertheless real acting. Her general style
on the stage seems to me to be foundd on the Bernhardt
