# BRITISH ARTISTS GIVE FINAL PERFORMANCE IN PENINSULA SERIES
## 
### Miriam Hilton, '25 
Playing in perfect ensemble, with the
voice of each instrument in harmonious
subordination, the London String Quar
tet —in the last Peninsula concert of the
season—charmed its audience last even
ing with a program which alternated
between the classical and modern school.
Mozart's four movements in B flat
were interpreted with a delicacy of feel
ing which produced varying qualities of
light and shade.
Of unusual interest was the fairy suite,
"Pixy Ring," by H. Waldo Warner,
violinist of the quartet. This composi
tion is ultra-modern in its vividly imi
tative description of midnight merry
making in the Pixie field, where the little
gnomes dance among the toadstools and
startle a mortal, who becomes "pixy
laden" in the midst of a favorite song.
In this number and"The King Dance,"
the last of the suite, the booming ac
companiment of the 'cello was particu
larly fascinating.
In the Beethoven quartet, in C, Op.
59, No. 3, the artists exhibited an un
derstanding and perfection of technique
which made the long and rather mys
teriously complicated introduction a
thing of beauty. The following menuetto
and allegro movements reached heights
which gave one a new appreciation of
Beethoven.
Frank Bridge's arrangement of "Sally
In Our Alley" and "Cherry Ripe" were
played as the first two encores, and the
third was Percy Grainger's Irish mel
ody, "Molly On the Shore."
