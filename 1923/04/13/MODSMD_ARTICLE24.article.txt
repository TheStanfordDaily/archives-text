# Dr. Jordan Gives Talk On European Conditions
## 
### 
Under the general topic, "What of the
Night?" Dr. Jordan discussed present
day European conditions at the confer
ence at his home last evening.
"The continental countries entered the
war with enthusiasm. Now, conditions
in Europe couldn't he worse and they
are steadily growing more so. England
took the war more seriously and at pres
ent is the only European country not on
the verge of disaster. America didn't
go into the war with the intention of
making anything out of it and came out
with even less."
Dr. Jordan summarized the situation
in the Ruhr, and gave political and his
torical reasons for the fighting there.
The one solution offered there is that of
free trade, which will enable the ex
change of German coal for French iron.
Due to the peculiar quality of French
ore, German coal is necessary for its
smelting.
The mandates of Asia Minor, the Bal
kan and Mesopotania are without excep
tion being exploited for commerce and
oil. The Armenians are completely ig
nored.
Dr. Jordan believes a renaissance will
come but it will l>e a long time. It is not
here yet, as many hopefully think, and
the worst is not over, he says.
