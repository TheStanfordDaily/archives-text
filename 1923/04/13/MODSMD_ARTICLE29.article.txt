# HARD HITTING NINE WILL OPPOSE CARD VARSITY TOMORROW

(Associate Sport Editor, Daily
Californian)
Ready to take another crack at the
Stanford varsity tomorrow afternoon,
the California varsity baseball athletes
have been getting in their regular daily
workouts 011 California field this week.
The Bruins, by virtue of their 10 to
5 victory of last week, are confident that
they can take another fall out of the
Cards. Just recently have the Bears de
veloped co-operation in their playing,
and it has made a decided improvement
all around, so that now they look like
a smooth running machine.
Every man on the California team,
from the top to the bottom of the bat
ting list, is a dangerous hitter. Stan
ford fans who witnessed last Saturday's
contest will testify to this. Unless the
Cardinal twirlers can serve up a fancier
assortment of curves tomorrow, a repe
tition of last week's affair is liable to
occur.
California's first six batters are
enough to give any pitcher a nightmare.
Hermle, Thompson, Douthit, Bill, Bowen,
and Gerlacb are all consistent with the
willow, with the first three named all
hitting well over .500. Gus Bowen has
the reputation of having broken up more
ball games than any other man on the
varsity. Gus also had a nice average
against the Cards last week, getting four
safeties out of four times at bat.
The Blue and Gold nine is absolutely
free from any injuries, and the same
team that played in the initial contest
will take the field tomorrow. Charlie
Erb, who has been out with a broken leg,,
is fast rounding into shape again, and
may be ready to take part tomorrow.
However, the keystone combination of
King and Bill is working nicely now.
and it is doubtful if Charlie will be used.
The California nine has respect for
the Cardinal batters, as they saw what
the latter could do along this line in the
first frame of last Saturday's encounter.
The Bear pitcher will have to deliver
some fancy twirling in order to prevent
a bunch of Cardinal runs.
Coach Carl Zamlock has a whole flock
of twirlers who are very anxious to do'
their bit, but the choice for tomorrow
is still a conjecture. Kelly had the Red
shirts eating out of his palm last week j
and may start again. Lloyd Toomey was
not able to get warmed up in the first
game, but Zamloch is confident of his
ability, and may decide to start him.
Toomey comes from the hot climate
region of Eresno, and perhaps a little
warm sunshine would benefit him.
The above named men seem to l>e the
best Bruin bets along tlie pitching line.
Nevertheless, "Bum" Bailey and Bob
Minty have been having good seasons
and could probably be used effectively.
Paul O'Neil, whose time was occupied
with basketball early in the year, has
been getting his arm into order and may
work in the box. Red Gould is also
a possibility, as is Wayne Banning.
While dope points to another Cali
fornia victory, the Bruin tossers are not
overconfident, and will go into the con
test tomorrow with the idea of taking
no unnecessary chances. They realize
the series is far from won as yet, and
believe that Stanford has a first-class
aggregation.
