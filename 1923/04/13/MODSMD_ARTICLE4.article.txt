# BABES ARE READY FOR SECOND CONTEST OF ANNUAL SERIES
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
When the California freshmen step
onto the field Saturday morning for
their second game with the Stanford
1926 ball team, they will meet an ag
gregation determined to win at any
cost. After losing the first game of the
annual three-game series to the Bear
babes at Berkeley last week, the year
lings took out their bats and got busy
getting their batting eyes in shape for
the second contest.
Nevers and Ditzler have been work
ing out every day this week, and both
have been showing top-notch speed
and control. Oviatt also has kept busy
and anyone of the three men is ready
to take his turn in the pitcher's box.
Which man Coach "Husky" Hunt will
use will not be determined xlntil game
time. The coach prefers to wait and
see how his twirlers warm up before
deciding. In all probability, Oviatt will
get the call since he pitched three in
nings of no-hit ball against the Bruin
yearlings last week. He is also in the
best form, not having taken any
chances of overworking.
Kohler Will Catch
Kohler will do the catching again
and the remainder of the line-up will
undoubtedly be the same as at the
start of the contest last week. McDer
mont or Draper will start on first base,
probably the former. Smith will play
second, Lucas will cover short, and
Green, freshman captain, will take
them around the hot corner of the dia
mond. Lovelace will be in the left
garden, Meiklejohn in center, and
either Ditzler or Nevers in right field,
depending on who gets the pitching
job.
Although it was evident last week
that the hitting of the first year men
was weak, no such evidence should
be apparent in this second game. The
team has been taking considerable
all-around batting practice this week.
The result is that the players feel
much more confident individually at
the plate and the pitchers will not be
able to complain of a lack of runs to
back them up in tomorrow's fray.
Babes' Fielding Improves
Fielding has not been skipped over
in an effort to get the batters going
at their usual pace. All the men have
taken their places in the field and
have worked as much at scooping up
