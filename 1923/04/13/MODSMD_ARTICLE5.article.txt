# STANFORD STARS TO GIVE BENEFIT SHOW
## 
### 
Harry Maloney's "Stanford Stars"
will stage a benefit show for the Palo
Alto Post 69 of the Veterans of For
eign Wars and the Fremont Post 52
of the American Legion at 8 o'clock
this evening in the De Luxe hall in
Palo Alto. The money raised from this
performance will be used to buy col
ors for the two organizations. The pro
gram will be made up of boxing,
wrestling, fencing, and tumbling.
Five boxing bouts are on the pro
gram. In the featherweight class, Mc-
Callister and Armbrusters will tangle.
Armbruster is conceded the victory
as he recently won the Intercollegiate
featherweight championship. In the
lightweight class, Hall and Sapero
will stage a three-round go. Hall has
the edge in this bout, because of his
showing in the bouts with U. S. C.
The other three bouts on the program
should be evenly contested as the men
entered have been fighting draws
all season. These bouts are Lane and
Adams in the 145-pound class, Irwin
and Stoddard in the 158-pound class,
and Robinson and Van Hook in the
175-pound class.
Two wrestling bouts are scheduled.
Meyer and Crist will grapple in the
125-pound class and Sievers and Clen
denin will meet in the 145-pound class.
The tumblers to take part in the pro
gram are A1 White, Paul Wilbur,
Wayne Smith, and Don Snedden.
