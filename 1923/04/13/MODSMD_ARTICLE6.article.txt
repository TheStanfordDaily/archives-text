# MALONEY SAYS WRESTLERS HAVE EVEN CHANCE TO WIN
## 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
The Cardinal wrestlers will meet the
University of California team tomorrow
evening in Encina Gymnasium. This
event will finish a full week-end sport
schedule on the Stanford Farm.
Wrestling Coach Vaughn Hosepian has
been giving his wrestlers a rest since
the second California Aggie meet and
they are in good condition for hard fight
against California. The wrestlers are
weakened by the loss of Wood head in
the 158-pound class and Nicholson in
the light heavyweight class. Neither of
these men are eligible this quarter.
Chances Are Even
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, and Hosepian both feel that the
chances are about even for Stanford to
win the affair. According to Amateur
Wrestling Association rules, no bantam
or heavyweight matches will be held.
This leaves but five matches, namely in
the 125, 135, 145, 158, 175 pound classes.
The loss of Nicholson means that Stan
ford will have no entrant in the 175-
pound class. Hosepian in the lightweight
class should have little difficulty in win
ning his match. He is intercollegiate
lightweight champion and is going better
than ever this year, having won all his
matches by a fall in the first few min
utes. These two bouts, then, should make
the score one all.
n the three matches left, Stanford

has a good chance of winning one of
them. Then if one of the other Redshirt
men can win his bouth, the Cardinals
will have the meet stowed safely away.
The men in these three bouts have not
been definitely decided upon, but it will
be either Sturm or Meyer in the 125-
pound class, Sievers in the 145-pound
class, and either Fueller or Gary in the
158-pound class.
Meyer in Good Shape
Meyer has a shade the best in his class.
Sturm is a letter man, but he has not
been going as w.ell this year as Meyer.
If Meyer appears'against California he
:s expected to win his match, rle put
up a game fight against Davis Farm, but
lost his bout by decision.
The other two bouts are the doubtful
ones for Stanford. Sievers has had ex
perience and won his first match with
Davis Farm. However, in the return
match with the Aggies he was unable to
throw Giddings, the Ag;?ie welter.
Woodhead's loss in the middleweight
class is likely to mean the loss of the
meet for Stanford. This man was one
of the best on the Card team and was
expected to win the middleweight bouts
against California. Fueller and Gary
have about equal chancesof l>eing chosen
for the 158-pound class. They have both
been working hard in prepaiation for
the match tomorrow night, but their
lack of experience is going to be against
them.
