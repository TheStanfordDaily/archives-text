# STANFORD VARSITY TO MEET BEARS IN TENNIS TOMORROW
## Captain Hinckley And His Mates Are Prepared For Net Battle at 9:30 
### 
Captain Richard Hinckley will lead
the Stanford varsity tennis team
against the California varsity net men,
tomorrow morning at 9:30 on the
varsity courts.
The Stanford team, composed of
Hinckley, Mertz, Deßack, and Tussing,
is strong and well-balanced. Although
losing their last matches to the Olym
pic Club, three matches to six, the
Cardinals redeemed themselves by
their aggressiveness and smooth play
ing. Another bright light was the fact
that Hinckley was able to slip over
a defeat on Bob Kinsey of the Olympic
Club, who is one of the best nationally
known tennis stars.
Hinckley in Good Form
Captain Hinckley is a seasoned
player. Two years ago, as captain of
the freshman team, he had little trou
ble in defeating his opponent in the
California freshman matches. Last
year, as a member of the varsity ten
nis team, he again beat his California
opponent in the singles. He is in fine
condition and should give Wallace
Bates of California quite a bit to
think about. Tussing, Deßack, and
Mertz are also strong players.
Bruin Squad Weil-Balanced
But what these Stanford players
will be able to do against such Cali
fornia stars as Wallace Bates, Phil
Bettens, and "Brick" Conrad, is very
doubtful, even though Stanford is
given the edge on the basis of the
Inter-Club Tennis Series. Like every
other sport in which Stanford meets
California, it is almost impossible to
predict the outcome.
