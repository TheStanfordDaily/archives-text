# STANFORD WINS JOFFRE ARGUMENT FROM CALIFORNIA
## Bertrand Comparet Awarded First Place and Medal; Tobriner Takes Second 
### 
Stanford's debaters defeated the
California team in the Joffre debate
in the Assembly hall, Friday evening.
Bertrand Comparet, '23, was awarded
first place and the Joffre medal, by
the judges, while Mathew Tobriner,
'24, was placed second.
The debaters had known for three
mnoths that the general topic of the
discussion Friday night would be some
phase of French foreign policy on the
continent since the signing of the
treaty of Versailles, but until two
hours before the argument began the
contestants did not know upon which
phase of the question they would be
required to speak. Professors Palm of
the University of California and Lutz
of Stanford, who picked the definite
subject of the debate, required each
speaker to advance a solution for the
Franco-German problem. 1
Comparet argued that the solution
of, as well as the responsibility for,
the situation on the continent lay en
tirely with Germany. His viewpoint
was entirely pro-French and he at
tempted to prove that the Germans
not only could pay but would pay,
when they finally realize that France
is serious in her demands. Comparet's
conviction evidently went with his
argument and he minced no words in
laying the blame on Germany.
Tobriner took the view that France
had not been blameless and that it
was up to her to withdraw .French
troops from the Ruhr and grant Ger
many a moratorium, during which
German industry and productive capa
city could be revived. He advocated
the application of common sense to
the conditions in Europe.
Arthur Murphy was the leading
California speaker and he was award
ed third place. His arguments were
well thought out and reasonable but
his delivery and his carriage on the
platform handicapped him. In the
opinion of one of the judges Murphy
was the winner, but the other two
judges placed Comparet first with To
briner second.
Thomas Bailey, '24, the third Stan
ford representative, placed fourth. The
judges favored the more thoughtful
and less forceful presentation of argu-
ment to Bailey's hard-hitting method
of delivery.
The Joffre debate is an annual af
fair, and this was the twenty-ninth
contest. The decision is awarded to
the individual who presents the most
effective argument, taking into con
sideration delivery and thought.
Professor A. M. Cathcart of the
Stanford Law school presided over the
debate and delivered a short introduc
tory and explanatory talk before the
debate.
The judges were: E. J. Tobin, presi
dent of the Hibernian Bank in San
Francisco; Judge John E. Richards,
Associate Justice of the District Court
of Appeals, in San Francisco, and Pro
fessor Tom Peete Cross, of the De
partment of English, University of
Chicago.
