# CALIFORNIA DOWNS CARDINAL NET MEN
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity tennis team
battled hard but unsuccessfully, and
lost to California, 3-2, last Saturday
morning on the varsity courts.
In the main event of the morning,
between Bettens, of California, and
Captain Hinckley, of Stanford, the>
Californian emerged victorious fat
straight sets, 6-4, 8-6. Bettens, former
Northwest open champion, was exhib
iting a powerbul serve and smashing
drive, but Hinckley was almost equal
to the occasion, and showed a faat
brand of tennis.
In the early stages of the two set*
between Bettens and Hinckley, the
games see-sawed. Smash followed
smash, and drive followed drive, until
it seemed that every game would have
to be won on superior condition alone,
since neither had much the better ot
the exchanges. But in the crises, Bet
ten's experience became more evident,
and he was able to pull ahead and win.
Although Hinckley plainly showed
his nervousness, his back-hand driving
was good, but not enough to win the
match.
In the other feature match. Captaim
Bates, of California, defeated Deßack*
of Stanford. 8-6, 6-3. This match wa*
of an entirely different type than the
preceding one. Both players used a
lobbing, slicing type of game, with
only an occasional drive.
For a while, during the first set, it
looked as though Deßack would defeat
the Blue and Gold captain. He deci
sively outplayed Bates, and gined a
several game lead. But Bates got
warmed up to his work and began to
pull ahead. However, it took him four
teen games to win the first set.
In the second set, Deßack fought
hard, but did not have a chance
against the placing of Bates.
Mertz sprank the unexpected in the
other singles match and literally over
whelmed Weinstein of California, 6-1,
6-1.
In the doubles, Bates and Stratford
of California heat Mertz and Hinckley,
6-4. 7-5, in a fast match; and Tussing
and Deßack, Stanford, defeated <'on
ray and Cooms, California. 6-3, 6-3.
