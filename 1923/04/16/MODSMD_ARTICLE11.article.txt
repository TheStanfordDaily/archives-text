# French Scholarship Will Be Established To Honor Kimber
## 
### 
A scholarship to commemorate the
heroism of Arthur Clifford Kimber,
'17, who was killed in action near
Verdun in September of 1918, was pro
| posed by Dr. Paul F. Cadman at the
' student assembly this morning. The
Kimber memorial will be one of a
number of graduate scholarships which
the American Field Service is estab
lishing in honor of its members who
were killed during the recent war.
The committee has agreed that the
j holder of the Kimber scholarship shall
be limited to Stanford students. ,
Arthur Clifford Kimber was the
bearer of the first officially recognized
American flag to France; he was a
; Palo Alto boy and his part in the work
of the Stanford ambulance unit is told
in "The Story of the First Flag."
The history of the American Field
Service fellowships for French uni
versities is associated intimately with
the history of advanced university
| study in this country. In 1915, partly
as an expression of opinion on the
! war and partly as a result of a convic
tion of the gain that would follow
from the influence of French culture, a
movement began to direct attention
to the opportunities for advanced study
offered by French universities. Schol
arships were established and in the
first year after the armistice, 19 stu
dents were sent to France. The com
mittee also succeeded in getting the
universities of France, which are con
trolled by the state, to open their
state degrees to foreign students, thus
, doing away with the distinction which

had formerly existed in favor of na
tive students."
In the meantime, the officers of the
American Field Service Association
were seeking a worthy means of com
memorating the death of 157 of its
members who had been killed in ser
vice. It was recognized that the move
ment already begun by the establish
ment of French fellowships furnished
the most appropriate memorial since
it would promote that understanding
between the youth of America and
France which had been the motivating
purpose in the establishment of' the
Field Service.
"It is only by the drawing together
of the youth of two countries in such
a way," Dr. Cadman said, "that the
international problem will be solved
which has baffled statesmen whose
knowledge was not based on personal
| contact."
The two groups then amalgamated
and the Society for American Field
Service Fellowships in French Uni
versities was formed. The Society is
a million; $100,000 of this has been
| seeking to raise its endowment to half
collected and $350,000 pledged. Stan
ford alumni in Los Angeles pledged
funds for two scholarships in memory
of Greayer Clover, '19, and Harold
Sayre, '19. The students of the Univer-
I sity of California have just established
scholarships for two of their men who
were killed. Professor H. R. Fair
dough of the Classical Languages de
partment is chairman of the Kimber
Scholarship fund.
