Well, we won the debate and the swimming meet
anyway.
All in all it was a disastrous week-end and not
the kind to instill that optimism for which Stanford
is famous. With the exception of one basketball
season the present college generation has never seen
Stanford triumph over California. But those of
us who are nearing the end of our stay here con
tinue to hope that some day, somehow, we shall
see such a victory. Such defeats as those of Satur
day do not inspire any great degree of confidence
but since we have been watchfully waiting for four
years, now is a poor time to change that attitude.
There is one more opportunity this year—that is
the track meet next Saturday. Will sporting writers
once more have to find alibis to explain how their
dope went wrong? Will editors have to become
Pollyannas once more and say cheerfully, "Better
luck next time, boys"? Let's hope not.
