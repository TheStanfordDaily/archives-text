College becomes a queer sort of machine when
one examines its product. The raw material enters
the same slot, and the result is delivered at but one
place; yet somewhere in the process, somewhere in
the heart of the mechanism, the material commonly
avoids some of the operations and chooses others.
So that the machine evidently does not determine
the course of the finished article that emerges in
varying states.
A boy comes from his home-town pre]) school.
He has ideals; he is impressionable; and he has a
background of rearing and instruction. College
takes him, shifts his interests, transforms his speech,
'alters his mode of living. Given responsibility, he
may develop his endowments and show unsuspected
ability. Mayhap the academic side of his under
graduate life will be subordinated. In any case, his
â– character will determine how well he does his job,
and what he himself gets out of his extra-curricular
activities. He will be tested. If susceptible, jhe will
succumb to an unfavorable environment. For the
weak individual is quickly absorbed into unfit sur
roundings. But if strong he will continue to be
himself throughout college, despite adverse influ
ences. Whichever he is, he will choose his path
through the machine.
"Wheels within wheels" have turned. Issues a
man who seems little different from the boy who
entered, four or more years before. Otherwise than
being more mature, with certain knowledge from
ljook and laboratory, he is little changed. College
has not bestowed upon him her best gifts because
he has not chosen to earn them. Comes with him
the boy who accepted responsibility, who welcomed
the opportunity to learn how to get along with his
fellows, who got things not found in text books.
He had to study, too. But he found out some things
about life that would not come to him so soon at
an office desk, later. And he found them out at a
good age. With the theory that he had learned, he
was a jump ahead.
The machine had stamped "A.8." after each of
the men's names. But it did not mean the same
for both. C. N. H.
