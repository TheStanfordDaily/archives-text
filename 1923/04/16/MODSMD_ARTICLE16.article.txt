I've often stopped to wonder
At fate's peculiar ways;
For nearly all our famous men
Were born on holidays.

CONFIDENCE
In twilight's sweetest silence
They spooned upon the beach,
For they had just been married —
The moon was in their reach.
"Dearest," she murmured, trembling,
"There's a secret you must know,
But gross deception on my part
I fear will be a blow."
"What is it, sweetheart?" whispered he,
"Fear not to let it pass."
"Since you insist," she sobbed to him,
"One eye is made of glass."
My lovebird," whispered he in turn,
Don't grieve at such a thing;
The selfsame crystal's shining forth
From your engagement ring."

A FABLE
There was once a student who came to college with
the belief that he was going to study. And he thought
to himself "I must find someone who will tell me what
to do." So he went to the college authorities but they
only looked wise and said "It is necessary to study to
remain affiliated with the University."
Then he ventured into another room in his entry to
question thereof. But they were busily playing bridge
and said nothing but, "I double, by, no trumps."
So the student gave up his search and became an im
mense success in college.

"Shay, where am I?" asked the staggering young man
as he felt a pair of arms close about him.
"In the arms of the law," answered the policeman who
had caught him.

I'm an all-around American fellow:
I've always enjoyed hunting. I've shot craps since
I Was a kid. I'm sure I'll make a successful jeweler,
because I can blow all kinds of pretty rings. I'm a star
track man. I'm so good in races that a speed cop never
has caught up with me. And I know how to make all
the women fall for me. I trip them.

"Quick! Quick! To the life-boats! The ship is sink

Milady grabbed her vanity-case; milord a package of
cigarettes.

"I'll raise you two," said the man as he lifted his eye
brows.

On evenings when I'm feeling fine, and all is going
right,
I go to see Marjorie, who is always gay and bright.
She amuses me.
Much of my time I spend with Georgia, a girl who never
smiles,
Yet besides the charm of happiness she has her share
of wiles.
She fascinates me.
Then there's Jean with flashing eyes and hair of raven
hue,
A bit of a flirt, a bit of a siren, and a bit of a coquette,
too.
She thrills me.
On evenings when I'm feeling tired and there's nothing
much to do,
I stay at home and smoke my pipe, and sometimes talk
to Sue.
She's my wife.

The Thirteenth came. Early that morning Harold
awoke, went to class, had lunch as usual, came home
after an unusually good game of chess that afternoon,
and was busily engaged in conversation at the table
that night, telling of his unusually happy day.
"This is my lucky day."he said. Then he suddenly
remembered the date. With a cry that would pierce
the heart of a Registrar, Harold fell to the floor, dead.
His luck had overcome him at last. For he hadn't been
able to remind a single soul of the date all day!
