# Education and Jobs
## 
### 
It is embezzlement to think that a college education
can get a man a job. So-called "practical courses" on
business given in so many universities will not enable
a man to command a better job merely because he has
taken them.
The real merit of a college education is that it teaches
one to think. I do not see why students insist on
measuring the results of an education in terms of
dollars and cents. The educated man has poise, he is
intelligent, he seems better for having allowed knowl
edge to pass through his mind. He is a better man
because he can think.
I am at a loss to know why it is students clamor for
"practical courses." The claim that they can get some
practical benefit from these courses is entirely un
founded in my estimation. If a man intends going into
the shoe business, he says he wants a course on shoe
manufacturing. Such education is all bunk.
An all-round college education that every man should
get includes "stuff" that will make him think. Account
ing is good and will help; a certain amount of calculus
will also train him to think; literature is also necessary.
Everyone should be able to write correctly. I once
heard a college graduate exclaim, "Say, if that guy had
took another step, he would have fell." Such English
isn't very good. â€”A. C. W.
