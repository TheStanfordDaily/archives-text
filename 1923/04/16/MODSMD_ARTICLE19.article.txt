# MOTOR-MANIA

"Come here and get us! We're out
of g-gas!"
This wasn't a cry of distress from a
Ford, but a feminine voice in a strand
ed motorboat shrieking for help on
the lake yesterday morning.
The proud owner of the motor-tug
had taken his boat out for its trial
spin through the waters of Lagunita,
and it acted very well on its first Sun
day parade; so back to the boatliouse
the young man went to get a few mem
bers of a sorority rushing party, who
were in gathing-suits, to grace his
water-chariot^
One of the fair swimmers posed non
chalantly on the bow; others draped
themselves beside the young fellow at
the wheel. Then away the boat whiz
zed through the water, to the envy of
all who were doing manual labor in
canoes.
Half-way around the lake the dash
ing racer came to a standstill, and a
feminine wail came forth for help.
Three yellow canoes full of the sif
ters and prospective sisters paddled
to the rescue, and the speed demon
of the morning was towed slowly to
the boat-house with the aid of three
hand-power canoes.
