The quality of mercy is not strained.
E. J. Bundrick, job printer at the Uni
versity Press, hung his clothes 011 a
hickory limb Saturday afternoon and
went swimming in the Palo Alto munici
pal tank. When he came up for air he
discovered that a sneak-thief had strained
$17 out of his pockets, leaving him 75
cents for a railroad ticket and his watch
to prevent him from missing his train.
The bandits seem to discriminate—they
left the Stanford locomotive in the
Museum, too.
