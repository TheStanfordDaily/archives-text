## 
### 
Do men enjoy gossip? Not much!
Ask any man on the campus, and he
will tell you they don't!
If you want any more proof, try
this: Walk down the Quad and call
to one of your masculine acquain
tances, "Hey, Bill, I've just heard some
hot stuff about ," and he will prob
ably stop you with, "Oh, run along; I
haven't time to listen to such trifles."
And ninety-nine chances out of a hun
dred he will walk away.
Go into any fraternity house or eat
ing club in time for lunch. Of course
the men are talking, but it's about
Harding's administration, or Einstein's
theory, or King Tut. There are abso
lutely no personal remarks.
Watch the roughs at a dance. Do
you suppose they are talking about
any of the people present? Not much!
Why, they are only interested in ob
serving crowd psychology!
"My dear," says one of the Five
Hundred, "I'm going out with Bob to
night. He always has all the 'low
down hop' on simply everybody. I'll
tell you all about it when I come
back."
Now, that's queer, isn't it? But you
can't depend on a woman.
Anyway, we can work this problem
of gossip out according to logic.
Women gossip over the tea-cups.
Most men don't go to teas.
Therefore most men don't gossip.
