# DR. PAUL CADMAN DENIES MILITARISTIC AMBITION IN FRENCH RUHR INVASION
## 
### 
"France has absolutely no militaristic
ambition in occupying the Ruhrâ€”state
ments to the contrary are pure propa
ganda," declared Dr. Paul Cadman this
morning when questioned as to what
France expected to gain from her seizure
of the Ruhr area.
"There is not one French party who
has any designs on German territory,
nor will the French government hold the
Ruhr one day longer than is necessary to
get security for reparations."
In reply to the query, "What can Ger
many pay?" Dr. Cadman said, "It is easy
to understand the French attitude when
one realizes that three German industrial
magnates, Krupp, Thyssen, and Hugo
Stinnes, have deliberately exported from
Germany $1,500,000,000, which is now
converted into substantial securities in
foreign banks. This group of industrials
has controlled German industry since the
war; they have exploited the country
and placed their profits abroad out of
reach.
"This is the sole reason that France
now holds the Ruhr. I do not say that
French occupation will pay, but when
these industrial kings realize that a mili
tary organization has attached their
source of wealth, they will undoubtedly
come to terms."
In Dr. Cadman's opinion, these men

alone are responsible for the deprecia
tion of the mark, for the entire German
industrial organization has been function
ing at full blast ever since the armistice.
He pointed to the fact that the mark
has always had a certain value, and that
production profit has managed to keep
ahead of currency depreciation.
Out of this situation, Dr. Cadman ex
plained, it was to the advantage of these
men to allow the mark to depreciate 10
the point of bankruptcy in order to evade
the reparations issue.
"Will the French be repaid? Only
time will tell," replied Dr. Cadman.
"Morally it does not matter, for the gov
ernment is after this small group of
money kings who are reaping enormous
profits. In her reparations agreement,
France is now demanding but one-fifth
of the original figure, which had refer
ence only to the restoration of devas
tated areas. She asks no pension for
the 800,(XX) French wounded."
The present work of rebuilding ruined
sections is at present being carried on
by the government with money bor
rowed from those French citizens who
suffered losses in the war, and in com
paring the relative financial situation of
the two countries, Cadman stated that
Germany's war tax per capita is equiva
lent to $25, whereas the French must
pay $85!
