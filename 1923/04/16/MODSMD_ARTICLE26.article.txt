# WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY PLANS GRIDIRON BANQUET
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
â€”Washington's Gridiron Banquet is to
be held on May 19. It is to be a satire
on campus life and life in general,
especially concerning the lives of
those present. Governor Hart, Presi
dent Suzzalo, and other prominent
men throughout the state on the Uni
versity of Washington faculty and on
the campus, are to be guests. Like
other Gridiron Banquets held through
out the country it does not pertain to
football in any way but rather to
"panning" the characters and idiosyn
cracies of those present.
