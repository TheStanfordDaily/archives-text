With the scheduling of the Stanford-
California intercollegiate track meet
next Saturday instead of the following
Saturday, Coaches "Ric" Templeton
and Walt Christie are busy putting
the finishing touches on the work of
their athletes. Stanford fans are try
ing to figure whether the Cardinal can
add another successive victory to their
string of four, while Californians be
lieve the Bruins are going to break the
Stanford chain. The Cards should win,
though the relay will be needed to de
cide the fray.

"Our country is at war now —and
the only way out is forward." These
were the first words of Dr. Jordan to
a group of students and faculty mem
bers who met him at the train last
night in Palo Alto as he alighted after
his return from the peace trip east.

Four veterans, four last year's fresh
men, and a member of the second var
sity have been named by Coach
"Husky" Guerna for the Stanford var
sity crew. Coaches of the Universities
of Washington and California have
also given out the names of the men
who will row in the big regatta on
the Oakland estuary next Saturday.

Four hundred and eighteen Stanford
men were enrolled for intensive war
training up to 2 o'clock this afternoon,
when the recruits were divided into
squads and companies and went
through the first military formations.

California's freshman track team
proved too strong for the Stanford
babes on the oval here last Saturday,
winning by a score of 68-54. Two Stan
ford-California records were shattered,
while one was equalled. Colglazier of
the Cardinal squad lowered the mile
time to 4:37 from 4:38 4-5. Goeppert of
the Bruins set the 440-yard record at
:50 4-5. The previous record was
:51 4-5. Calden of California equalled
the 100-yard dash record of : 10 1-5.

D. M. Smith, '19. will not have to
appear before Police Judge Lakin to
tell why he popped paper bags in a
Palo Alto movie house when the
cinema stars kissed. The Student
Council interfered, and Smith was re
leased today. However, he will not be
able to pop any more bags in the
Marquee Theater when the stars oscu
late —he will have to understand that
the orchestra is the only accompani
ment needed when movie stars get
affectionate.

Blue and Gold prospects received a

jolt yesterday when Captain Adair and
Second Baseman Hudson were sent to
the infirmary, the former with the
measles and the latter with an attack
of mumps.

The City of Piedmont recently voted
a new charter.
