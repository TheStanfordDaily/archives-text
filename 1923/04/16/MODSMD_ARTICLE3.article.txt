# CALIFORNIA HITTING BEATS CARD NINE IN THREE EXTRA INNINGS BY 9 TO 8 SCORE
## Babes Drop 4 to 2 Game and Series to Bruins in Pitchers' Battle 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Twelve innings of hot and horrible
baseball last Saturday afternoon served
to pr>v'e that California still has the
Stanford goat, and the Card varsity took
a narrow defeat by a 9 to 8 score. The
earned runs were outvoted by the errors
to a considerable extent, and California's
murderous hitting strength was the ace
that won every trick.
The Bruins slapped out a total of six
teen hits, which should be good for
fourteen runs in almost any ball game.
Teague managed to keep them fairly well
scattered, however, with the result that
the Cards made their seven bingles count
for eight runs and came very close to
taking the exhibition. California's infield,
particularly Captain Hermle, seemed to
delight in presenting the Cardinal with
free-will offerings, and this little trait
kept Stanford well in the running.
Neither team played much real baseball.
Solomon appeared on the mound dur
ing the first and a part of the second in-,
ntngs, and then sought scclusion iway
from the California batsmen. During
his brief reign he issued four hits and
a walk, which stood the Bruins to a four
run lead. Hermle's triple, which defi
nitely announced that "Solly" was not
going right, chased two markers over the
log.
The California infield went high in the
air during the second frame, and Stan
ford scampered about underneath it for
three runs. Woodward .walked, Patter
son singled, and Heckendorf walked.
Teague drove a sacrifice fly to the out
field, scoring Woodward. The Bears
then indulged in a little chucking prac
tice during which Patterson and Hecken
dorf checked in at the plate. Bill starred
with two errors in this episode.
California turned two hits and an er
ror into a brace of runs in the third,
but a Stanford double play made two
hits count for nothing in the following
stanza. The Cards nearly tied it up in
the fourth, when Heckendorf started out
by drawing a pass. Captain Peavy jolted
a hit to center field and the ball bounced
over Douthit's head. Two runs crossed
the plate before the ball came back to
the infield.
California increased her lead to two
runs in the fifth, on two singles and a
sacrifice hit. In the seventh, Roy Car
ver landed on second when King made
an overthrow of first, and scored im
mediately on May's single. The score
was knotted at seven all in the ninth
inning.
With two away, May found himself
at first base on a fielder's choice. He
forthwith stole second, and Mulchay
was put in to run for him. Lawson then
tackled the unenviable position of pinch
hitter, and came through like a million.
He pasted Kelley for a neat single over
second base, and Mulchay had plenty of
time to tie things up. Lawson went out
trying to take second on the throw-in.
The California bench-warmers re
turned from their overhasty trip to the
gymnasium, and the game went on. King
doubled for California in the tenth, but
died on second. Stanford's tenth frame
was without incident except for Hccken
dorf's base on balls.
Coach Wolter switched the line-up

Stanford's freshman ball players were
forced to take a 4-2 defeat from the Blue
and Gold first-year men Saturday, when
the Cardinal sluggers failed to slug. The
best the yearling batters could do was
to produce pop flies into the waiting
hands of the California fielders. Only
three hits were made off McEneany and
Stark, who did the pitching for the Bruin
Cubs, and only one of these was made
when there were men on the paths.
In the sixth inning, Smith, the first
man up, got a single on a grounder
through short, only to be forced by Ditz
ler. McEneany seemed a trifle wild and
walked Meiklejohn and also Lovelace,
filling the bases. This was Nevers' op
portunity to win his own ball game. He
took a couple of balls, swung wide at two
strikes and then crashed out a nice line
single to right field, sending two men
across the plate.
Earlier, in the third round, the Califor
nia batters had hammered in two runs
on a double by McEneany, a base given
Craviatto when hit by Nevers, and a
single by Lowden. Then Nevers tight
ened up some and no more scoring re
sulted until the fifth, when McEneany
scored his second run of the game after
receiving a pass and advancing around
the bases on two infield hits and two
fielders' choices.
In the last of the sixth Nevers sent
the two Stanford runs across the plate,
but no further opportunity to score came
until the ninth inning. In that frame
Lovelace got to first on an error by Tait,
Bruin third baseman, and was advanced
to second on a sacrifice hit by Green.
Nevers again came to bat with the chance
of tying up the game by a home run or
any kind of a safe hit. But he was too
anxious and Stark forced him to hit a
weak grounder to Morse and the game
was over.
Nevers pitched a good game, although J
not as tight a one as his opponents, but \
the main trouble lay with the Cardinal j
batters who failed to do anything more j
than knock out little pop flies or high flies ;
to the outfield. Nevers' line-single was
