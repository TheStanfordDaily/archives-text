# EL TIGRE LOSES TO BETA THETA PI IN ONE-SIDED CONTEST
## 
### 
The Beta Theta Pi baseball team had
little difficulty in trouncing the F.l Tigre
nine by the score of 11 to 2 in an intra
mural baseball game played yesterday
morning. Other week-end intramural re
sults were: Sequoia 7, Phia Gamma
Delta 1; El Campo 17, Kappa Alpha 10.
The Beta nine displayed a finished
brand of ball that marks them as one of
the strong contenders for the league
championship. Alabaster, on the mound,
bad good control and, aided by the work
of his ffcammates with the bat, he was
never in danger. El Tigre was unable
to hit with the frequency of the Beta's
and their fielding was none too good.
Sequoia turned the Phi G's down with
a defeat Saturday morning in' a well
played game. Prior, the Sequoia twirler,
tossed a heady game and allowed the Phi
G's but five scattered hits. He retired
ten of the Phi Gamma Delta batters by
the strikeout route and walked only one
man during the game.
El Campo ran wild with the Kappa
Alpha tossers, garnering thirteen hits,
which they turned into 17 runs through
errors on the part of the Kappa Alpha
players. Kappa Alpha started out well,
making three runs in the first. How
ever, their opponents scored a like num
lwr in their half of the first. The Kappa
Alpha got five tallies in the'second and
two in the third, while El Campo scored
six in the second and fourth and two
in the fifth.
