# STANFORD MATMEN WIN ONE, LOSE FOUR BOUTS WITH BEARS
## 
### 
California outclassed the Stanford
wrestlers Saturday, winning three of the
four matches, and being given the light
heavyweight match because Stanford had
no entry. The one bright light on the
Stanford team was Vaughn Hosepian,
wrestling coach and lightweight intercol
legiate champion. Hosepian was the only
Stanford man to win his match, and the
win Saturday makes him intercollegiate
champion for three times in succession
Bill Fletcher, graduate manager, will
send Hosepian to Portland to take part I
in the Pacific Coast amateur champion
ships, at which both college and club |
teams are entered.
Hosepian secured a fall over Cooley in,
two minutes and ten seconds, using dou
ble arm bar with both arms and a head
scissors. The Card wrestler slipped on
the mat at the start and gave Cooley the
offensive for a few seconds, but the Cali
fornia man was unable to secure a single
hold.
Kramer of California pinned Meyer of
Stanford to the mat in five minutes and
11 4-5 seconds. Both wrestlers were
about even throughout the bout with
Kramer on the offensive most of the time.
He secured a head scissors on Meyer j
and when the Stanford man tried to |
break his hold he turned enough to place |
his shoulders on the mat, giving the bout i
to the California featherweight. This j
fall was more of a fluke than anything
else.
The third bout was between Sievers of
Stanford and Stone of California. Sie- j
vers was on the defensive throughout
the whole fight and was thrown in 2
minutes 29 2-5 seconds with a double arm
bar and head scissors. Freedman of the
Bruins won the final bout with Mooney
of Stanford when he secured a fall in
2 minutes 32 2-5 seconds. Mooney
lacked the experience of the California
man and did not have a chance of win
ning at anjr stage of the bout. After a
minute of wrestling Freedman secured
an arm scissors with a double wrist lock.
The Stanford man was placed in a help
less position, but refused to give up
Freedman then showed some true sports
manship and released the painful hold,
giving Mooney another chance to win.
He secured a fall a minute later with an
arm scissors.
