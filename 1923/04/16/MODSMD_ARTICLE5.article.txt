# CARD VARSITY, FRESHMAN SWIMMERS DEFEAT BEARS
## 
### 
Following the example of the var
sity, the freshman swimming team
broke loose Friday afternoon in En
cina pool, and made a clean sweep
against the California freshman swim
mers, 59 to 9. Breaking two freshman
records and tieing another, the Stan
ford first year men forced the Baby
Bruins to content themselves with
seven third places and one second in
the eight events.
Wally O'Connor, the Card freshman
captain, was the star of the meet. He
clipped eight seconds off the former
record when he swam the 220 yards
in 2:33.2. A few minutes later he tied
the backstroke record.
The other record to fall before the
Cardinal Babes was the relay record.
The Stanford team negotiated the dis
tance in the fast time of 1:07.2.
Other high-point men were Allen,
with firsts in the fifty and hundred,
and Langley, with a first in the plunge

More than living up to the advance
dope, the Stanford varsity swimming
team easily defeated the California
varsity, 44 to 24, in Encina pool Friday
afternoon. The Card swimmers were
not content with letting their oppon
ents capture only two firsts, but broke
three Stanford-California records as
well.
The afternoon started off poorly for
Coach Ernie Brandsten's Cardinals, the
Blue and Gold swimmers winning the
relay and fifty-yard swim in rapid suc
cession. While the relay time was not
exceptional, the California team had
a wide lead over their red-suited op
ponents. Rau of California captured
the fifty-yard event in 26.4.
At this point the California activities
stopped. The next event, the 100-yard
breaststroke, was won by Fletcher of
Stanford in 1:15.2, clipping two sec
onds off the former record. Immediate
ly following this, Austin of the Stan
ford team won the 220-yard swim in
2:41.2, one and two-fifths seconds un
der the previous record.
DeGroot demonstrated his superior
ity in his favorite event, and captured
the backstroke in 1:15.4. At this point,
Austin returned to the tank and de
feated the favorite, Rau of California,
in the hundred-yard free style.
White, national diving champion,
and Sneddon, of the Cardinals, easily
captured first and second in the div
ing. White was not in his usual form,
and was hard pressed by his team
mate, Sneddon.
In the plunge for distance, Hawley
of Stanford plunged seventy-two feet,
a foot farther than the former Stan
ford-California record. The summary:
