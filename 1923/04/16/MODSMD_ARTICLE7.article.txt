# MUSEUM RAIDED; $10,000 IS STOLEN IN JEWELS, COINS
## Robber Enters by Window Saturday Night; San Jose Sheriff Aids in Search 
### 
Inventory of the contents of the
Stanford Museum by Director Pedro
Lemos, University authorities, and po
lice officials, had not been completed
sufficiently at an early hour this after
noon to make any accurate estimate of
the loss by theft last Saturday night
or early Sunday morning of rare old
Egyptian jewels, Greek and Roman
coins, and jewels belonging to Mrs.
Leland Stanford. The actual value of
the loss will probably amount to about
$10,000, it is thought, although the
sentimental value attached to the lost
articles will make an accurate esti
mate difficult.
Officials believe that the theft was
made by amateurs, and several clues
have been found to substantiate this
fact. The thieves stole only such arti
cles as could easily be melted up into
bullion.
The loss so far as known includes
several rare old Grecian and Roman
coins, a Roman necklace designed in
100 B. C., several gold bracelets and
rings, and three diamond brooches
with small miniatures of the Stanford
family. The brooches were formerly in
the possession of Dr. Wilbur until the
Memorial Room in the Museum was
opened.
It was first thought that the thieves
hid themselves in the building before
closing time Saturday afternoon, loot
ing the Museum some time during the
night, and escaping through a rear
window which was found open. This
has contradicted, however.
The burglars climbed to a ledge
about five feet above the ground to
the rear of the museum, and then,
tearing loose the wire netting on the
outside of the window, pried the win
dow up and secured entrance, it is
thought.
Three showcases were broken into.
The glass in a showcase, which con
tained the ancient Grecian and Ro
man coins, was broken, after a dia
mond cutter had proved unsuccessful
and the attempt to remove the mould
ing had also failed.
Several valuable Egyptian relics
were taken from a showcase in a sec
ond room. Here, a *three-by-six-foot
glass door was removed by means of
screwdrivers, and necklaces, rings,
breast ornaments, and other jewelry
were stolen. Gold ornaments from
mummies which were mounted on a
card were taken.
The Stanford Memorial Room was
also looted. The case which contained
jewels which belonged to Mrs. Stan
ford had been covered with wired
plate glass. Unable to remove this
glass by taking out the screws which
held down the top of the case, it is
believed that the thieves jutaped upon
the glass until they had cracked it. A
heavy blow, possibly with a heel, then
broke the glass in two corners.
The theft was not discovered until
shortly after 10 o'clock Sunday morn
ing, when the first visitors of the day
to the Museum, after having signed on
the visitors' book at the entrance,
started on a tour of the building. They
reported to attendants that three show
cases had been broken into.
Lemos was notified at once and the
doors were ordered closed, Two deputy
sheriffs from San Jose arrived shortly
before noon to assist Lemos in an
investigation of the robbery.
Stanford's collection of ancient
Egyptian relics has long been noted.
Since the King Tutankhamen discov
ery and the added interest in every
thing Egyptian, more visitors have
studied the Egyptian collection in the
Museum than at any time previous, it
has been reported. However, the po
lice authorities think that the thieves
wanted the coins and similar articles
only for their bullion worth.

It was first thought that the thieves
hid themselves in the building before
closing time Saturday afternoon, loot
ing the Museum some time during the
night, and escaping through a rear
window which was found open. This
has contradicted, however.
The burglars climbed to a ledge
about five feet above the ground to
the rear of the museum, and then,
tearing loose the wire netting on the
outside of the window, pried the win
dow up and secured entrance, it is
thought.
Three showcases were broken into.
The glass in a showcase, which con
tained the ancient Grecian and Ro
man coins, was broken, after a dia
mond cutter had proved unsuccessful
and the attempt to remove the mould
ing had also failed.
Several valuable Egyptian relics
were taken from a showcase in a sec
ond room. Here, a *three-by-six-foot
glass door was removed by means of
screwdrivers, and necklaces, rings,
breast ornaments, and other jewelry
were stolen. Gold ornaments from
mummies which were mounted on a
card were taken.
The Stanford Memorial Room was
also looted. The case which contained
jewels which belonged to Mrs. Stan
ford had been covered with wired
plate glass. Unable to remove this
glass by taking out the screws which
held down the top of the case, it is
believed that the thieves jutaped upon
the glass until they had cracked it. A
heavy blow, possibly with a heel, then
broke the glass in two corners.
The theft was not discovered until
shortly after 10 o'clock Sunday morn
ing, when the first visitors of the day
to the Museum, after having signed on
the visitors' book at the entrance,
started on a tour of the building. They
reported to attendants that three show
cases had been broken into.
Lemos was notified at once and the
doors were ordered closed, Two deputy
sheriffs from San Jose arrived shortly
before noon to assist Lemos in an
investigation of the robbery.
Stanford's collection of ancient
Egyptian relics has long been noted.
Since the King Tutankhamen discov
ery and the added interest in every
thing Egyptian, more visitors have
studied the Egyptian collection in the
Museum than at any time previous, it
has been reported. However, the po
lice authorities think that the thieves
wanted the coins and similar articles
only for their bullion worth.
Inventory of the contents of the
Stanford Museum by Director Pedro
Lemos, University authorities, and po
lice officials, had not been completed
sufficiently at an early hour this after
noon to make any accurate estimate of
the loss by theft last Saturday night
or early Sunday morning of rare old
Egyptian jewels, Greek and Roman
coins, and jewels belonging to Mrs.
Leland Stanford. The actual value of
the loss will probably amount to about
$10,000, it is thought, although the
sentimental value attached to the lost
articles will make an accurate esti
mate difficult.
Officials believe that the theft was
made by amateurs, and several clues
have been found to substantiate this
fact. The thieves stole only such arti
cles as could easily be melted up into
bullion.
The loss so far as known includes
several rare old Grecian and Roman
coins, a Roman necklace designed in
100 B. C., several gold bracelets and
rings, and three diamond brooches
with small miniatures of the Stanford
family. The brooches were formerly in
the possession of Dr. Wilbur until the
Memorial Room in the Museum was
opened.
