# BRUIN BABES CAPTURE CINDER PATH CLASSIC
## Boyden Defeats Richardson in Close Race; Sets New Record in 880. BEAR TRACKSTERS TAKE MAJORITY OF FIRST PLACE POINTS 
### David Meiklejohn, '26 
Stanford freshmen played their last
card and lost. California topped off her
brace of yearling victories for the 1922-
33 season last Saturday afternoon the
oval when the Bruin Cubs forced the
Cardinal Babe track team to swallow the
bitter pill of advance dope and defeat to
the tune of 93 1-2 to 37 1-2. The best
time to calculate victories in a Stanford-
California freshman track meet is after
the affair is done.
Four records were shattered in the
high hurdles, the mile, discus, and half
mile. Stanford men, Boles and Kerr,
were responsible for new marks in the
low hurdles and mile, respectively. Boles
traveled the high sticks in 15 1-5 seconds,
as good time as has been made anywhere
on the coast this year. Kerr raced for
four laps and lowered the existing rec
ord seven secohds, in 4:30 4-5.
A race for the lead began and all the
way down the stretch both men opened
up with a burst of speed which left the
nearest runner fifty yards behind. Rich
ardson kept even with Boyden to within
ten yards of the finish, and the Cali
fornia man won by inches in a jump for
the tape. It was estimated after the
meet that Boyden must have run more
than eight yards further in attempting to
pass the Card half-miler on the turns.
Barber, California sprinter, upset the
dope in 100-yard dash, when he tied Ed
die Sudden's record of 10 seconds flat,
defeating Gaspar of Stanford by five
yards. Gaspar finished behind Blumc,
also of California, for third place.
"Smoke" Francis, dusky Berkeley ath
lete, took nine extra trys after breaking
a discus mark by 10 feet, and succeeded
in heaving the platter 129 feet 6 inches.
None of the former performances were
equal, however, to the feature race be
tween Boyden and Richardson in the
880, which Boyden won in 1:571-5; the
fastest time that has been credited to
any runner on the Pacific Coast this year,
if not to the entire United States.
A California man paced the two run
ners for the first lap, which was run in
58 seconds. The pacer dropped behind
and Richardson took the lead, closely
followed by Boyden, who continually at
tempted to pass the Stanford runner on
the curves. At the beginning of the sec
ond lap Boyden started ahead, but Rich
ardson spurted and the two coasted the
curve together.
Stanford failed to place higher than
third in the field events, which showed
The 440 was another sensational race.
After running in third place for 350
.yards, Judah pulled out, eased down the
inside lane on the home stretch and beat
Williamson out by inches for first place.
Spangler of Occidental was forced into
third place.
Scofield surprised the Cardinal rooters
a weakness greater than had been pre
dicted.
