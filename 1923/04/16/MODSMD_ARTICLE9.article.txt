# RELAY GIVES SOUTHERN CONFERENCE TEAMS VICTORY, 74-66
## 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Some day, sporting writers and sport
enthusiasts are going to adopt an elev
enth commandment—"And thou shalt
not depend upon dope."
Old Man Dope's proverbial bucket re
ceives many upsets, but one of the great
est of these occurred on the Stanford
oval last Friday afternoon. On paper,
the All-Southern Conference track team
looked strong, but not dangerously so.
On the Cardinal track they were strong
enough to defeat the Stanford varsity
by a 74-66 score.
To the Cardinal supporters, there
just one real bright spot in the entire
meet, and that was the sprinting of
Campbell, who won the 100-yard clash
in 10 flat and the 220 in 0:22 1-5. On the
basis of past performance Argue of Po
mona was doped to win both the sprints.
In the century, Campbell pulled up in
the last few yards and won by inchex.
In the 220 he won easily and Gark nearly
beat Argue out for second place.
Campbell's performance gave the
dopesters something to think about for
the Big Meet next Saturday. Should he
and Hale both enter the sprints, the Blue
and Gold sprinters may find difficulty hi
breaking into the point column.
Daggs of Pomona ran true to form
and won both the hurdle races. Falk
placed second in the high sticks, with
Leistner and Maxwell tying for third.
In the lows, Maxwell and Leistner again
tied, this time for second place. Leistner
seems to havs completely recovered from
his attack of the influenza and showed
better form than he has at any time this
year.
The relay was the best race of the
day and the closest seen on the local ovil
this year. The southerners held a6O to
66 lead before the relay and the meet
hung in the balance. Williamson started
the last lap with a one-yard lead which
he kept down to the home stretch, where
Powers pulled up and won by inches.
by tying for first in the pole vault at 12
feet 3 inches, with Goodenough of Po
mona. Keetch of Cal. Tech. won the
two-mile in the remarkable time of
9:52 2-5.
