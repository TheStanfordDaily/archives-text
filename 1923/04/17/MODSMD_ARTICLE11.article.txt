# NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN MUSEUM ROBBERY SHOW LOWER LOSS
## 
### 
Although inventory of the Egyptian
:oins and jewels stolen from the Stan
ford Museum late Saturday night or
early Sunday morning is not yet quite
complete, indications are that the en
tire loss will be well within $5,000.
This was the announcement made late
this morning by Pedro Lemos, direc
tor of the Museum.
Immediately after the robbery, it
was thought by the director that the
stolen articles would amount in value
to at least $10,000. But when he re
placed the coins which had been scat
tered about on the floor, he found the
loss much less than first estimated.
Other than this, there have been but
few new developments.
The large number of finger prints
found are now being examined by San
Francisco criminologists. The result
of their investigation is expected to
throw a light on the criminal or crim
inals involved.
