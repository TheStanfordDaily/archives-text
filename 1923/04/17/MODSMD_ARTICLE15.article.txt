# DOPESTERS WORKING OVERTIME TO PICK TRACK MEET WINNER
## Stanford Has Edge on Cinder Path But Needs Fifteen Points in Field Events for Victory. 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
With the Big Meet but four days off, dopesters are working overtime trying
'vainly to give the edge to one team or the other. It's almost a hopeless job.
This year's track classic which is to be run off on the Berkeley oval next
Saturday, contains more elements of uncertainty than any meet in recent years.
"If§" and "mights" play the most important part in every dope sheet.
In the meantime, Walter Christie and "Dink" Templeton are putting their
charges through their paces in the rival camps just as though nothing out

of the ordinary was going to happen.
Cards Journey to Berkeley
The Cardinal squad journeyed to
Berkeley Sunday where they worked
out 011 the California track under the
watchful eye of the Stanford mentor.
All reported the track in excellent
condition when they returned to the
Farm. Light workouts were in order
on the Cardinal oval yesterday after
noon, on account of the cold and
cloudy weather.
At present, the meet seems to hinge
on the sprints and field events. If
Campbell is running like he did against
the All Southern Conference team, he
should be good for at least a first and
a second in the 100 and 220 and pos
sibly two firsts. He is just regaining
his strength after a spell in the hos
pital and looks like the best sprinter
on the Coast, barring none but Charlie
Paddock. If Hale is in good shape and
Clark comes through, the Blue and
Gold should have a lot of trouble plac
ing men in either of the dashes.
Card Sprinters Look Good
Should the Cardinal sprinters conw>
through and should Lady Luck smile
on the other Card track men, Stan
ford should get away to a substantial
early lead. This would leave the issue
