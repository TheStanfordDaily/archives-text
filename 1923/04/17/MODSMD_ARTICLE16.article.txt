times at bat. On his two other trips to

of the contest. Piggott starred with the
; bat for the Phi Delts. He knocked out
| one home run, two three-baggers, and a
1 single.

| going to be close. However, the Encina
men got started with the club and in
j the next three innings they had scored
j ten times. Errors were frequent on both
i sides.

doing the work of the*winners pitched
consistent ball and kept their hits well
scattered. Smith pitched for the Zetes.
