# STORING ASSOCIATIONS
## 
### 
In a few months the greater part of the class which
entered Stanford in the fall of 1919 will be starting
out independently in various lines of activity. A
large part of the pleasure which comes to them in
that outer world may depend upon the nature and
breadth of associations which they have formed in
their four years at Stanford.
In the rush of college life it is not often that stu
dents get together purely for the purpose of becom
ing better acquainted and enjoying casual conversa
tion. The Senior Smoker tonight is to be one of
those rare occasions when we can do away with
formal discussion of campus problems and enjoy
each other's company. It ought to be of particular
value because of the proximity of commencement and
the dissolving of the Class of 1923 as an active unit.
In addition, the first public appearance of Coach
"Pop" Warner gives added interest to the, affair.
Warner will discuss some aspects of the football
situation and will undoubtedly offer encouragement
in what Jack James terms our "psychological athletic
slump."
