# RESULT OF IGNORANCE
## 
### 
It is well for the complacency of the parents of
our students that they do not have precisely the
knowledge that the library staff does. They would
be shocked to learn just what the literary tastes of
some of our students are.
Numbers of undergraduates constantly ask for the
Burton edition of "Arabian Knights." Others want
the "Decameron," Les Contes Drolatiques," or
Havelock Ellis. Many who know from experience
that the library is a poor source of such material
patronize the side-street book shops of the city and as
a result the campus is deluged with books such as
"Jurgen," "Fantasius Mallare," as well as with the
memoirs of various ladies. One campus resident
owns a rare volume treating Hindu sex psychology,
which is in great demand at the rate of 50 cents per
week.
It is regrettable that an institution of higher learn
ing - should function as one of lowest learning. The
physical facts of sex should not be a mystery to men
arid women of university standing to the extent that
they find it necessary to satisfy their morbid curiosity
through pornographic literature. Ignorance is the
cause of this curiosity in a majority of cases, and the
persons who dispel their ignorance by such methods
are choosing very nearly the poorest possible way.
