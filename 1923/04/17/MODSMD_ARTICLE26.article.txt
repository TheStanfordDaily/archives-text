THE NEW WOMEN are to be commended for
the good sense they showed last night in voting that
the spring bidding be done next Friday rather than
next May. To continue the strain for another month
would be too hard on lx>th the new women and the
houses. The system tried this year was only an ex
periment ; it was not planned to adopt it permanently
until after a three years' trial. Less than one year
has shown that a different system will have to be
evolved.
