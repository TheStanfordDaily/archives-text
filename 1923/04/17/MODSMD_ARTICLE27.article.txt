About this time every semester those men and women
who are up to their necks in campus activities are
unanimous in their fears of "flunking" out. And this
semester is no exception to the rule.
Activities supply some of the finest opportunities for
training in various practical lines and the development
of executive ability that any young man or woman could
desire. These opportunities, however, are worse than
worthless if they are employed at the expense of schol
astic endeavor.
The harm that accrues from the sacrifice of studies to
activities is two-fold. In the first place the student con
cerned discards all thought of the main purpose for at
tending this University—the acquisition of an academic
education. Added to this is the other disadvantage
which materially damages the reputation and standing
of campus activities.
Not only does the student himself lose by failure in
courses but the branch of activity he represents is given
a black eye by being the cause of low scholarship
records. Students should arrange their time in order
to arrive at the best division of time so that neither
of these two major intersts conflicts to th detriment
of the other.
The trouble is that too many take more positions and
responsibilities than their time permits of accomplish

ment. When, then, poor grades ensue the activities are
blamed for causing students to become disqualified.
Ordinarily the adage that the "more you do the more
you can do" holds but there is a limit to all things. If
students cannot realize the importance of recognizing
this limit then some system of limitation of activities
should be installed.
The suggestion is not new. It has, however, many
possibilities. There are enough men and women in
California to accomplish the things that are done by
the student body. The whole trouble is that responsi
bilities are centered in too small a group instead of
being spread over a larger number. Perhaps some
schedule of positions or pursuits could be arranged with
a definite limit as to the number of outside student body
interests a person could pursue.
Another suggestion is that a scholarship standard
should be exacted in order that students falling below
that standard would not be allowed to participate. This
would provide an incentive toward higher scholastic
endeavor and at the same time maintain the integrity
of student activities. —Daily California!!.
