LEVITICUS THE BALLOON VENDER
or, Hop and Hope,
by
Horatio Algebra, Jr.
Perpetrator of "Ike, the Elevator Boy, or Bound to
Rise;" "Only a Multimillionaire;" "The Young Street
Waif, or Adrift in Sausalito;" "From Peanut Boy to
Plumber;" "The Young Rumrunner;" and too many
others.
CHAPTER THE ONETH
"Buy a balloon, sir?"
Our hero, a bright intelligent youth of some sixteen
summers, fifteen winters, and about ten times as many
falls, advanced assuredly toward his prospective cus
tomer. The poor but honest youth had come to the
Great City to work oft' the mortgage on the old home-

stead, knowing in his
heart of hearts that he
would some day rise high
in the world.
The man whom he ad
dressed —a tall, gaunt,
grizzled financier — was
none other than the Wolf
of Wall Street, Jason
Cufflink, head of the
Haberdashery Trust.
With an anonyed, almost
irritated gesture, he
pushed our hero into a
sewer which gaped open
conveniently, and pur
sued his way.

CHAPTER THE TWOTH
The ragged little balloon vender felt grieved at such
inconsiderate treatment. As he lay on the hard pallet
that served him as a couch at night and a chaise-lounge
in the daytime, he wept wet tears all over the pavement.
The other balloon boys crept up in a long line to com
fort him and kiss away those tears that furrowed his
cheeks. Most of them had not shaved for several months.
CHAPTER THE THREE
Leviticus stood at his stand in the busiest part of
lower Broadway, blowing up his wares for the day's
commerce. He bought his balloons for six cents and
sold them for a nickle. He never made any money; he
only kept his job because he liked to yell.
A large purple-and-green balloon was in his deft hands,
slowly filling and expanding.
Suddenly, the earth fell away beneath him. He had
blown the purple-and-green one too full! He was being
carried upward—upward through the canon of lower
Broadway!
All Manhattan lay below. To the north was Central
Park, where the telephone girls lived. There before
him was the Battery, where in his leisure moments he
had often gone to play with the little bats. Would he
ever see them again?
As he passed the offices of Cufflink & Co. on the
175 th floor of the Bootblack's Building, old Jason stuck
his head out of a window and extended his hand with
a hearty smile.
"Young man," he cried, "when you get down, stop
around and I will give you a job as my vice president.
I like a boy that can surmount all obstacles!"
"Ah!" exclaimed Leviticus, as the balloon burst with
a loud report, "I always knew I would some day rise high
in the world!"

falls, advanced assuredly toward his prospective cus
tomer. The poor but honest youth had come to the
Great City to work oft' the mortgage on the old home-

stead, knowing in his
heart of hearts that he
would some day rise high
in the world.
The man whom he ad
dressed —a tall, gaunt,
grizzled financier — was
none other than the Wolf
of Wall Street, Jason
Cufflink, head of the
Haberdashery Trust.
With an anonyed, almost
irritated gesture, he
pushed our hero into a
sewer which gaped open
conveniently, and pur
sued his way.

CHAPTER THE TWOTH
The ragged little balloon vender felt grieved at such
inconsiderate treatment. As he lay on the hard pallet
that served him as a couch at night and a chaise-lounge
in the daytime, he wept wet tears all over the pavement.
The other balloon boys crept up in a long line to com
fort him and kiss away those tears that furrowed his
cheeks. Most of them had not shaved for several months.
CHAPTER THE THREE
Leviticus stood at his stand in the busiest part of
lower Broadway, blowing up his wares for the day's
commerce. He bought his balloons for six cents and
sold them for a nickle. He never made any money; he
only kept his job because he liked to yell.
A large purple-and-green balloon was in his deft hands,
slowly filling and expanding.
Suddenly, the earth fell away beneath him. He had
blown the purple-and-green one too full! He was being
carried upward—upward through the canon of lower
Broadway!
All Manhattan lay below. To the north was Central
Park, where the telephone girls lived. There before
him was the Battery, where in his leisure moments he
had often gone to play with the little bats. Would he
ever see them again?
As he passed the offices of Cufflink & Co. on the
175 th floor of the Bootblack's Building, old Jason stuck
his head out of a window and extended his hand with
a hearty smile.
"Young man," he cried, "when you get down, stop
around and I will give you a job as my vice president.
I like a boy that can surmount all obstacles!"
"Ah!" exclaimed Leviticus, as the balloon burst with
a loud report, "I always knew I would some day rise high
in the world!"

"Buy a balloon, sir?"
Our hero, a bright intelligent youth of some sixteen
summers, fifteen winters, and about ten times as many
falls, advanced assuredly toward his prospective cus
tomer. The poor but honest youth had come to the
