# UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA MAY ADOPT AN HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF NEVADAâ€”It is
very probable that the University of
Nevada will adopt an honor system in
the near future. The "Sagebrush," a
student body newspaper, has been
carying on a campaign to determine
the attitudes of the faculty and the
students themselves. The president of
the university and the deans of the
several colleges are all in favor of
the system.
