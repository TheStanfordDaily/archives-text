# TEMPLETON, FALK WILL BE SPEAKERS AT TRACK RALLY
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton and Cap
tain Lane Falk will be the principal
speakers at the big track rally in the
Assembly hall Thursday night at 7:15.
Coach Templeton has built what be
gins to look like a winning track team
out of what formerly was regarded as
a shattered squad due to loss of sev
eral of last year's cinderpath stars.
"Dink's" topic will be on Stanford's
hopes in the Big Meet Saturday.
Captain Falk, who will speak after
Templeton, is favored to win both
hurdle races against California, which
means ten points for Stanford.
The meet 'Saturday will be Stan
ford's last chance to even up on the
string of victories which has fallen
to California this season, and the rally
committee is attempting to arouse all
the enthusiasm possible in order to
give the team a warm send-off.
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will lead the singing. Allen
made considerable of a hit at the
recent student body assembly, where
he lead the students in singing a few
of the old and new songs. He will
be assisted by the University Band
and Glee Club, which will attempt to
lend harmony to the occasion.
Learning of the words of the new
song. "We're Sailing Up the Bay," is
especially urged. The words of the
song will be found in a recent issue
of the Daily Palo Alto.
