# NEW DEVICES IMPROVE MODERN CARBURETORS
## 
### 
The modern carburetor does not re
quire much "fussing," according to car
buretor experts. The problem is to se
cure a proper mixture of air and gaso
line into a vapor which is ignited in the
cylinder by a spark. The present kind
of gasoline is extra heavy and requires
considerable heat to break it up. This
is accomplished by jacketing the mani
fold, installing "hot spots," or by apply
ing hot air from the exhaust.
The danger of clogging the carburetor
by means of dirt and water in the gaso
line is overcome by the use of the filter,
which catches the impurities in the gaso
line before it comes in contact with the
air. The filter should be cleaned every
thirty days. Various sources of trouble,
say the experts, are the valves, spark
plugs and ignition points. These should
be carefully watched.
