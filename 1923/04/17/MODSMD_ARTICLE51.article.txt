# Professor Adams Receives Russian Famine Pictures
## 
### 
Professor E. D. Adams, director of
the Hoover War Library, has just re
ceived a group of Russian famine pic
tures from the New York office. The
pictures, painted in water colors by a
Russian peasant artist, visualize the
terrible famine conditions under which
the Russian peasants of the district of
Samara have lived since the summer
of 1922.
Ten of the pictures illustrate the
living conditions as they are seen by
the sufferers themselves. The artist
has furnished graphic source material
for future historians.
