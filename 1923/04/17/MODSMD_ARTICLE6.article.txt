# NEW WOMEN VOTE TO HAVE APRIL 20 AS PLEDGING DATE
## Motion for Earlier Bidding Is Carried by Vote of 94 to 19 
### 
Freshman women decided to change
the sorority pledging date from May
15 to April 20 by a vote of 94 to 19
taken at a meeting in Roble last eve
ning.
The May pledging system was start
ed at Stanford this year, but an
amendment to the original constitu
tion made it possible for rushing to be
closed earlier than had been antici
pated.
Summons to appear before the law
yer will be sent to the women Friday
evening, and acceptance of bids will
take place on Saturday morning.
According to Miss Yoßt, it is not
surprising that the ideas and tech
nique of formal rushing were carried
over into this year's system. In spite
of genuine efforts to get the new
spirit, the old traditions had made
such headway that by the beginning
of the Bpring quarter it seemed best
to act on the question of an earlier j
bidding date.
"The significant thing about the
change is that it is an explicit ac
knowledgment that the new women j
have a right to a voice in the matter j
that concerns them so directly. They
have never been given such a privi
lege before."
In accordance with this recognition,
the new women were asked to vote on
a change of date. Following an ex
planation from Dean Yost, the decision
was made.
"I do not feel that either the failure j
to carry out the spirit of the new con- j
tract during open week, or the change j
in the bidding date, is evidence of the
failure of the new system. The sound-!
ness of the principle is not involved
either. This situation is the natural j
outcome of the effort to solve the new
problem with old methods. I think that
the future will profit greatly by the
realization that this cannot be done
satisfactorily," said Dean Yost last
night.
