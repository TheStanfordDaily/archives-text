Stanford swimmers should play an
important part in the Pacific Athletic
Association swimming meet Friday night
in the Olympic Club tank. Coach Ernie
Brandsten has entered men in each of
the six events, and is counting on them
to place in every one.
In the 150-yard open backstroke swim,
DeGroot and O'Connor of Stanford are
entered. Due to previous records, this
event is generally conceded to Smith,
of the Olympic Club. However, he
should be hard pressed by DeGroot and
O'Connor, who will probably finish in the
order named.
DeGroot Shows Up Well
In the meet last Friday against Cali
fornia, DeGroot swam the hundred-yard
breaststroke in 1:15 4-5, even though he
was not in the best of condition. O'Con
nor also made fast time, being clocked
in 1:18 4-5.
McCallister and Hirschmann of St:*n
ford have both been entered in the 100-
yard handicap swim. This event wil be
in doubt up until the las: mirute.
In the 100-yard junior free-style, Aus
tin has signified his intention of enter

in winning this event, since he swani the
distance in :59 4-5 against California last,
Friday. If Austin is hard pressed, which
is doubtful, he should better his previous
mark.
Allen and Langley are entered in the
500-yard junior free style. These men
