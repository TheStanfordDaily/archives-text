# THREE CITIZENSHIP CUSSES WILL BE REPLACED BY NEW COMBINED COURSE
## WILBUR WILL LECTURE Purpose of Course Is Service To State Rather Than For Individual Student Needs 
### 
A group of the Stanford faculty,
including President Wilbur and num
bering possibly a dozen men, each
especially qualified for the work, will
unite in giving a course next year
required of every freshman in the
University and designed specifically to
train Stanford men and women to be
good citizens whatever their particu
lar professions of callings may be. The
course will run throughout the year
and constitute about one-fourth of the
freshman's work.
Service to State Is Purpose
The purpose of this course is service
to the state rather than equipment of
the student through disciplinary or
cultural studies for his own individual
needs. In its proposed form it is the
result of Stanford's three years' ex
perience in "Problems of Citizenship"
courses which have been required of
freshmen, and has been developed
from those courses upon the sugges
tions of the professors who have been
giving them.
The chief differences between the
new scheme and the old are that in
stead of giving three rather distinct
one-term elementary courses in eco
nomics, political science, and social
science, as formerly, Stanford will now
provide a single, unified course run
ning through the year and offering the
advantages of a larger number of men
to cover a somewhat broader field.
Special Committee in Charge
A special committee of the faculty
has been placed in charge of the or
ganization and conduct of the course,
with Professor Edgar E. Robinson of
the History department named as di
rector, and other members connected
with various departments most inti
mately related to the citizenship
course, as follows: Harold Chapman
Brown, philosophy; W. G. Beach, so
cial science; E. A. Cottrell, political
science; M. R. Kirkwood, law; Victor
J. West, political science; A. C. Whita
ker, economics.
Director Robinson lias worked out a
syllabus of lectures developing the course
in logical progress, and will call upon
.specially qualified men to handle these
lectures. For these lectures the entire
freshman class will meet in one body of
about 600 members three times a week.
In addition every freshman will attend
weekly meetings of groups of about
thirty each under the guidance of in
structors, who will give their whole aft
ernoon to this phase of the work and
who, by questions and discussion, will
endeavor to lead each student not only to
a thorough understanding of the sub
ject matter of the lectures, but to a
personal application of the information
to himself in connection with his duties
as a citizen.
Freshman Class to Meet in Body
In addition, since the whole freshman
class will meet as a body in this course,
the University authorities will make use
of it to start the new student along
right paths in his college career, giving
him advice about habits and methods of
study, the use of books and of library
and other facilities, broadening his con
ception of the opportunities at the Uni
versity and of his obligations as a mem
ber of the college community.
"Our aim in giving this citizenship
course," says Professor Robinson, the
director, "is to produce an attitude of
mind that will give the/student a new
outlook on the world so far as his sense
of citizenship and his thought of his
place in the world are concerned.
Through the lectures and the group
discussions our hope is that each
student will be led to consider his indi
vidual relation to the world in which
we live, particularly the economic and
political and social fabric. Emphasis
will be laid upon the individual oppor
tunity and duty rather than upon the
forms of society as such.
"The purpose of this general course is
service to the state. In the modern day.
it is essential that the disciplined and
cultured college graduate have a concep
tion of the state and of his relation to
it, not only for his own sake, but for
the sake of the state. Here as a fresh
man in college, at the outset of his op
portunity to prepare himself for life,
the emphasis will be upon public, not
private objectives.
Not Cultural Course
"The course, then, is not primarily
cultural nor disciplinary, nor is it pri
marily intended as a foundation for fur
ther study in any of the social sciences.
It is to be considered not as preparation
for other more specialized courses, but
as an end in itself. The disciplinary
training and cultural experience are pro
vided in the various departments of the
University, which provide courses for
the particular professional needs or the
desire for breadth of knowledge and ap
preciation of the individual students.
"To achieve our object of fitting our
students to become conscientious and
intelligent citizens we propose this gen
eral survey of the society which has
come into being in the last five hundred
years, with some explanation of the his
torical and physical bases of our civili
zation. and will try to drive home to them
through questions and discussions in
small groups their opportunities and
duties as citizens in that society. Our
whole purpose and hope in this course is
to aid our students to cultivate intelli
gence and independent judgment in derd
ing with social problems.
"It is possible, also, that such an ex
perience with the subject matter of mod
ern civilization given as one piece may
place some students in a frame of mind
to use their college course more effec
tively than they might without such a
preliminary view of the organization and,
problems of the world."
