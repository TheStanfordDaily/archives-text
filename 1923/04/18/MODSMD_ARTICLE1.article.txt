# THREE CITIZENSHIP CUSSES WILL BE REPLACED BY NEW COMBINED COURSE
## WILBUR WILL LECTURE Purpose of Course Is Service To State Rather Than For Individual Student Needs 
### 
A group of the Stanford faculty,
including President Wilbur and num
bering possibly a dozen men, each
especially qualified for the work, will
unite in giving a course next year
required of every freshman in the
University and designed specifically to
train Stanford men and women to be
good citizens whatever their particu
lar professions of callings may be. The
course will run throughout the year
and constitute about one-fourth of the
freshman's work.
Service to State Is Purpose
The purpose of this course is service
to the state rather than equipment of
the student through disciplinary or
cultural studies for his own individual
needs. In its proposed form it is the
result of Stanford's three years' ex
perience in "Problems of Citizenship"
courses which have been required of
freshmen, and has been developed
from those courses upon the sugges
tions of the professors who have been
giving them.
The chief differences between the
new scheme and the old are that in
stead of giving three rather distinct
one-term elementary courses in eco
nomics, political science, and social
science, as formerly, Stanford will now
provide a single, unified course run
ning through the year and offering the
advantages of a larger number of men
to cover a somewhat broader field.
Special Committee in Charge
A special committee of the faculty
has been placed in charge of the or
ganization and conduct of the course,
with Professor Edgar E. Robinson of
the History department named as di
rector, and other members connected
with various departments most inti
mately related to the citizenship
course, as follows: Harold Chapman
Brown, philosophy; W. G. Beach, so
cial science; E. A. Cottrell, political
