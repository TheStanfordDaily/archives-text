# STUDENTS GO SLEEPLESS FOR FORTY-EIGHT HOURS IN MEDICAL TEST ON BLOOD PRESSURE
## 
### 
Tales of how they were forcibly kept
awake by a member of the Stanford
University faculty who guarded them
to prevent their falling asleep for even
a moment were told yesterday by five
red-eyed, exhausted students.
The men were A. E. Butterfield, C. V.
Barley, Y. D. Hahn, D. L. Robertson,
and J. O. Vaughn. Their captor for two
days and nights was Dr. N. W. Rake
straw of the chemistry faculty.
The five spent the two nights of their
"captivity" at the Rakestraw home, where
they were forced to run about the prem
ises or perform various antics to prevent
their falling asleep. All this, it was fur
ther revealed, was merely an episode in
the course of experiments to determine
the effect of fatigue on the chemical com
position of the blood. The men are stu
dents in the Medical department and are

serving as subjects of an experiment to
find out whether or not sleeplessness af
fects the blood chemically.
The experiment was started Friday
morning at 6, when blood tests from the
five men who were to go without sleep,
and also from the five controls, who
were to live normally during the same
period, were taken. Blood tests from
the ten were taken again Saturday morn
ing and Sunday morning at the close of
the experiment.
A repetition of the test, with the con
trols as reagents and the subjects of this
week's experiment in the role of con
trols, will be made week after next.
According to Dr. Rakestraw, who has
been examining the blood samples, no
evidences have yet been noted of chemi
cal changes in the blood because of the
forty-eight hours of sleeplessness.
