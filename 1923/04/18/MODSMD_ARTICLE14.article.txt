# LECTURER OUTLINES POLITICAL HISTORY OF SERBIAN NATION
## 
### 
"America was instrumental in the
successful establishment of Jugo
slavia and was one of the first coun
tries to recognize the new united
kingdom.
"Before the war the small nations
of Europe had very little indepen
dence. Their fate was decided by the
concerted powers of the continent, but
experience has taught the people of
the Balkan state√ü to unite and fear no
enemy from without." These were
some of the opinions set forth by
Madame Slavko Grouitch, American
wife of the former Serbian minister
to the United States, in her lecture last
evening in the Little Theater.
Sketches Serbian History
Madame Grouitch gave a brief
sketch of the history of Serbia begin
ning with the war in 300 A.D., in
which the Serbs joined the Trojan
army against the Greeks. After the
war the Greeks punished the Serbs by
driving them from their homeland into
central Europe. Four hundred years
later the exiles returned to their na
tive country, but in the fourteenth
century the Serbs were again expelled
by the Turks.
The Balkan people favored a demo
cratic government. There was no her
editary king, but a military chief was
chosen to lead the army. Every lesser
chief had a voice in making the laws.
Overthrown by Turks
In the ninth century Serbia is first
heard of as a kingdom. The weak
alliance of the Balkan nations made
them easy victims for the Turks. How
ever, it took the Ottomen two hundred
years to overthrow Serbia, and even
then the Turks did not dare to ven
ture beyond the fortified towns and
into the mountains where the Serbians
were hidden.
"In 1804 Serbia started its first war
for independence, and in 1813 was
recognized as a principality under the
suzerainty of Turkey," said Madame
Grouitch. "It was not until 1912 that
Serbia was big enough to be placed on
the map as a kingdom."
Madame Grouitch reviewed the part
that Serbia played in the outbreak of
the World War. She declared that
Serbia had not planned to make war
on Austria, but that the assassination
of the Austrian archduke followed the
act of a misguided 17-year-old school
boy.
"It was during the year of 1915 that
I first heard of Jugo-Slavia. Some
Serbians who had escaped from their
country were holding meetings in
Paris and London and were beginning
to draw up plans for the new con
federation.
"The new Balkan country started as
the 'Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats,
and Sloveness.' It corresponded to a
republic and had an elected assembly,
ministerial responsibility, and a cab
inet that stayed in power as long as it
could control a majority of votes in
the lower house.
"When America entered the war the
people of Jugo-Slavia knew that their
dream of independence would be
realized. One little boy climbed a
telegraph pole and shouted down to
an Austrian officer, 'Hey, you down
there, St. Peter is coming back with
the Americans!'"
According to Madame Grouitch
many monuments in the Balkan states
mark the presence of the American
relief workers. She commented on the
work that Professor H. R. Fairclough
of the Classical Literature department
had carried on through the Red Cross
society to aid the stricken people of
central Europe. Madame Grouitch said
that Professor Fairclough had done
much to convince the Americans that
Serbia had not forced Montenegro to
join Jugo-Slavia.
This is Madame Grouitch's second
lecture tour of the United States. Her
first one was made in 1915.
