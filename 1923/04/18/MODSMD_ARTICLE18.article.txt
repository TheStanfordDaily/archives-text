# MURPHY DECLARED TO BE INELIGIBLE FOR CARD-BEAR MEET
## BLACK DISCARDS CAST; TD ENTER SATURDAY Templeton's Squad Should Pile Up Big Lead In Track Events; Hurdles, Sprints and Half Mile Doubtful. 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Old man Fate frowned on the Stanford varsity track squad yesterday when
"Pat" Murphy, two-miler, was declared ineligible to compete in the Big Meet
at Berkeley next Saturday. Then, just by way of showing his good will, he
smiled on "Dink" Templeton's charges ,and Bill Black, pole vaulter, threw

away the cast he has been wearing on his ankle for the past two weekß,
That just about evened things. Although Murphy has not been in the best
of shape this year, he was counted on to be near the front in the long distance
event. With "Pat" out of the running, the Cardinal hopes wlil be pinned on
Hayes, French, and A1 Charles. Black still uses his crutches and is forced to
favor his weak ankle, but it is a safe bet that the big fellow will be in there

> skimming over the bar Saturday. If
his ankle does not trouble him too
much and he is in anything like his
usual form, his presence will be felt.
Entry lists published yesterday in
dicate that Walter Christie, Bruin
mentor, realizes that he can hope for
but a small margin in the track events.
Practically every man on the Blue and
Gold squad who ever ran in his life is
terial for these events.
Cardinal Strong in Track Events
And Walt is going to need every
point he can gather in the sprints,
distances, and hurdles, for the Stan
ford squad has a wealth of point ma
terial for these evetns.
The hundred-yard dash looks like a
Stanford race. With Hale, Clarke,
Campbell, and Wright entered, Farns
worth and Ryan will be lucky to figure
in the point column. As Campbell is a
little slow starting, he will not figure
in this race as he should in the fur
long. Shepard has been making good
time for California in the 220 and the
judges will probably find difficulty in
choosing between Campbell and him
at the finish. Hale and Clarke should
also figure for the Cards in this race.
Elliott Favored in Mile
In the mile, comparative times seem
to indicate that Elliott and Gurley
should finish one, two, but—there's
many a slip. Mulvaney, Denton, and
Fiske of the Bruins are to be reckoned
with. Although A1 Charles has not
been running in his best form, many
critics say that he may surprise in
the four-lap race. Hayes looks like a
winner in the two-mile, with Mulvaney,
Jensen, and Charlie Dorr, if he runs,
pushing him. A1 Charles may also
figure in this event.
Barring unlooked-for breaks, Stan
ford should get about points in
the 440. Saxby is the best man on
the California squad, but Judah and
Williamson are favored to finish in
the order named. Judah has improved
greatly this year and Williamson is
•getting stronger every day. Coverly
and Shermund of the Cards, and
Goertz of the Bears may surprise the
fans.
Hurdles Uncertain
The hurdles are probably the most
uncertain events in the meet. In the
low sticks, Van Sant, Neff, and Becker
are the best bets for the Bruins. If
Falk and Leistner are in form, they
should finish first and second, forcing
the best California man into third
place. In the highs, the prospect is
about the same. Becker has made the
best time at Berkeley this year, but
Leistner beat him last year and should
repeat Saturday. If Falk can beat both
of them, Becker may be forced to be
satisfied with third place.
First and third in the 880 looks cer
tain with the possibility of first and
second for the Cards. Elliot and Daly
will probably fight it out with Bauman
and Pearce of California for the
places. If Elliot is not forced too hard
in the mile, he and Daly should run
the Bear entries off their feet. Macin
tosh, Dole, and Moody are also pos
sible contenders for Stanford in this
race.
Cardinal Relay Should Win
The dope bucket will get the big
gest upset of the meet if the Cali
fornia relay team breaks the tape. The
best combination Christie can muster
can hardly hope to beat the Cardinal
four-man team, which will be picked
from Williamson, Judah, Scofield, Cov
erly, Daly, and Wright. Shermund,
Coverly, Williamson, and Judah, run
ning in the order named, seems to be
Templeton's logical choice.

Stanford race. With Hale, Clarke,
Campbell, and Wright entered, Farns
worth and Ryan will be lucky to figure
in the point column. As Campbell is a
little slow starting, he will not figure
in this race as he should in the fur
long. Shepard has been making good
time for California in the 220 and the
judges will probably find difficulty in
choosing between Campbell and him
at the finish. Hale and Clarke should
also figure for the Cards in this race.
Elliott Favored in Mile
In the mile, comparative times seem
to indicate that Elliott and Gurley
should finish one, two, but—there's
many a slip. Mulvaney, Denton, and
Fiske of the Bruins are to be reckoned
with. Although A1 Charles has not
been running in his best form, many
critics say that he may surprise in
the four-lap race. Hayes looks like a
winner in the two-mile, with Mulvaney,
Jensen, and Charlie Dorr, if he runs,
pushing him. A1 Charles may also
figure in this event.
Barring unlooked-for breaks, Stan
ford should get about points in
the 440. Saxby is the best man on
the California squad, but Judah and
Williamson are favored to finish in
the order named. Judah has improved
greatly this year and Williamson is
•getting stronger every day. Coverly
and Shermund of the Cards, and
Goertz of the Bears may surprise the
fans.
Hurdles Uncertain
The hurdles are probably the most
uncertain events in the meet. In the
low sticks, Van Sant, Neff, and Becker
are the best bets for the Bruins. If
Falk and Leistner are in form, they
should finish first and second, forcing
the best California man into third
place. In the highs, the prospect is
about the same. Becker has made the
best time at Berkeley this year, but
Leistner beat him last year and should
repeat Saturday. If Falk can beat both
of them, Becker may be forced to be
satisfied with third place.
First and third in the 880 looks cer
tain with the possibility of first and
second for the Cards. Elliot and Daly
will probably fight it out with Bauman
and Pearce of California for the
places. If Elliot is not forced too hard
in the mile, he and Daly should run
the Bear entries off their feet. Macin
tosh, Dole, and Moody are also pos
sible contenders for Stanford in this
race.
Cardinal Relay Should Win
The dope bucket will get the big
gest upset of the meet if the Cali
fornia relay team breaks the tape. The
best combination Christie can muster
can hardly hope to beat the Cardinal
four-man team, which will be picked
from Williamson, Judah, Scofield, Cov
erly, Daly, and Wright. Shermund,
Coverly, Williamson, and Judah, run
ning in the order named, seems to be
Templeton's logical choice.
Old man Fate frowned on the Stanford varsity track squad yesterday when
"Pat" Murphy, two-miler, was declared ineligible to compete in the Big Meet
at Berkeley next Saturday. Then, just by way of showing his good will, he
smiled on "Dink" Templeton's charges ,and Bill Black, pole vaulter, threw

away the cast he has been wearing on his ankle for the past two weekß,
That just about evened things. Although Murphy has not been in the best
of shape this year, he was counted on to be near the front in the long distance
event. With "Pat" out of the running, the Cardinal hopes wlil be pinned on
Hayes, French, and A1 Charles. Black still uses his crutches and is forced to
favor his weak ankle, but it is a safe bet that the big fellow will be in there

> skimming over the bar Saturday. If
his ankle does not trouble him too
much and he is in anything like his
usual form, his presence will be felt.

the best California man into third
place. In the highs, the prospect is
about the same. Becker has made the
best time at Berkeley this year, but
Leistner beat him last year and should
repeat Saturday. If Falk can beat both
of them, Becker may be forced to be
satisfied with third place.
First and third in the 880 looks cer
tain with the possibility of first and
second for the Cards. Elliot and Daly
will probably fight it out with Bauman
and Pearce of California for the
places. If Elliot is not forced too hard
in the mile, he and Daly should run
the Bear entries off their feet. Macin
tosh, Dole, and Moody are also pos
sible contenders for Stanford in this
race.
Cardinal Relay Should Win
The dope bucket will get the big
gest upset of the meet if the Cali
fornia relay team breaks the tape. The
best combination Christie can muster
can hardly hope to beat the Cardinal
four-man team, which will be picked
from Williamson, Judah, Scofield, Cov
erly, Daly, and Wright. Shermund,
Coverly, Williamson, and Judah, run
ning in the order named, seems to be
Templeton's logical choice.
