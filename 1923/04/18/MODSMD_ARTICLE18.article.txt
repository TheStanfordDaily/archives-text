# MURPHY DECLARED TO BE INELIGIBLE FOR CARD-BEAR MEET
## BLACK DISCARDS CAST; TD ENTER SATURDAY Templeton's Squad Should Pile Up Big Lead In Track Events; Hurdles, Sprints and Half Mile Doubtful. 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Old man Fate frowned on the Stanford varsity track squad yesterday when
"Pat" Murphy, two-miler, was declared ineligible to compete in the Big Meet
at Berkeley next Saturday. Then, just by way of showing his good will, he
smiled on "Dink" Templeton's charges ,and Bill Black, pole vaulter, threw

away the cast he has been wearing on his ankle for the past two weekß,
That just about evened things. Although Murphy has not been in the best
of shape this year, he was counted on to be near the front in the long distance
event. With "Pat" out of the running, the Cardinal hopes wlil be pinned on
Hayes, French, and A1 Charles. Black still uses his crutches and is forced to
favor his weak ankle, but it is a safe bet that the big fellow will be in there

> skimming over the bar Saturday. If
his ankle does not trouble him too
much and he is in anything like his
usual form, his presence will be felt.
Entry lists published yesterday in
dicate that Walter Christie, Bruin
mentor, realizes that he can hope for
but a small margin in the track events.
Practically every man on the Blue and
Gold squad who ever ran in his life is
terial for these events.
Cardinal Strong in Track Events
And Walt is going to need every
point he can gather in the sprints,
distances, and hurdles, for the Stan
ford squad has a wealth of point ma
terial for these evetns.
The hundred-yard dash looks like a
Stanford race. With Hale, Clarke,
Campbell, and Wright entered, Farns
worth and Ryan will be lucky to figure
in the point column. As Campbell is a
little slow starting, he will not figure
in this race as he should in the fur
long. Shepard has been making good
time for California in the 220 and the
judges will probably find difficulty in
choosing between Campbell and him
at the finish. Hale and Clarke should
also figure for the Cards in this race.
Elliott Favored in Mile
In the mile, comparative times seem
to indicate that Elliott and Gurley
should finish one, two, but—there's
many a slip. Mulvaney, Denton, and
Fiske of the Bruins are to be reckoned
with. Although A1 Charles has not
been running in his best form, many
critics say that he may surprise in
