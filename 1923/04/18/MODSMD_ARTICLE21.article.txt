# Meeting of Journalists' Association Postponed
## 
### 
Because the date conflicts with the
track rally, the meeting of the American
Journalists' Association, scheduled for
Thursday evening, at which Ben Allen,
'07, was to speak, has been postponed.
The meeting will probably be held a
week from Thursday at the Phi Delta
Theta house.
