# TALK

It would be a worthy task for some statistician to
compute the average mean of talk which floods the
campus every day. Some of it splatters on the
ground and disappears, some lights on a blade of
grass or a leaf and sparkles for a moment or two,
some forms mud puddles, some gathers into merry
little rivulets, some serves to swell the stream of
human thought running down through the centuries.
Fortunate is the man who knows what part to
play in all this talk—when to be silent and when
to contribute something; when to be serious and
when to be casual; when to be dogmatic and when
to be liberal.
Of those who dispense the greatest flow of words
on the campus there are three classes: the conven
tionalists, the radicals, and the men with ideas.
Occasionally they overlap in a happy combination.
The conventionalists, as a rule, however, begin with
lengthy discussions of athletic prospects and then
run the gamut of women, bootleggers, and smut.
At that they are more to be admired than the few
of their number who think that no conversation
should attempt more than one of these subjects.
Then there are those who deal in orthodox icono
clastu —mere Menckenisms uttered purely to appear
smart or startling. In the minority, as in any group
in society, are the men with ideas. Such men are
to be feared by the smug and the conformists, but
how refreshing is their contribution in that great
mouthing of words which goes on night and day in
such a place as this.
