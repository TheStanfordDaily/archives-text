# RALLY—OR FARCE?
## 
### 
A rally is a peculiar sort of gathering. It re
quires numbers and enthusiasm else it becomes a
dismal sort of affair. No athletic team would be
come greatly inspired, no rooting section would be
tilled with tire, by such a fiasco as the last attempted
rally. The concerted effort of an international con
gress of yell leaders couldn't get much more than a
feeble whisper out of the few who heeded the call of
Yell Leader Minsky for a little practice in songs
and yells in preparation for the Big Meet.
Naturally it will be easier to get a gang together
tomorrow night because of the proximity of the
annual meet with California. One evening is a
short time to school a couple of thousand men in
yells and songs and it is too bad that better support
hasn't been given previous rallies this year. Last
week's assembly, however, helped considerably and
proved that Stanford men and women are still able
to make their voices heard.
The part that rooting sections actually play in
"bringing victory is hard to estimate. But, whatever
its value, Saturday's contest is a University affair,
and as such, those students who take pride in Stan
ford must feel some responsibility as to its outcome.
Everyone will not be able to get out in the field and
on the track—it remains for most of us to do what
ever we can from the bleachers. And as long as
rooting sections are an integral part of intercolle
giate contests —let us see that the noise—and music
—which comes from the Stanford side of the field is
the best we are capable of producing.
A necessary preliminary to effective rooting at
the meet is attendance at the rally tomorrow —both
as a means of getting up enthusiasm and bringing
about familiarity with the songs and yells.
