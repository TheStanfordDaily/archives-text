# UNAFFECTED BY SLUMP

### 
Swimming' is one sport to which Stanford has
been able to point with pride consistently for the
past five years. The record of victories would seem
to belie the accusation that some sort of Freudian
complex* is responsible for Stanford's failure to
defeat the University of California even when doped
to win.
Men on the team do not hesitate to attribute their
successes to Coach Ernst Brandsten and a uniform
system of coaching through a period of several
yearsâ€”which augurs well for the future of other
branches of athletics to which the public attaches
greater significance.
