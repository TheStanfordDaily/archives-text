# The 						Man on the Street's Wife

"Far be it from me to state." began Mrs. Bodleberry,
tucking up a stray wisp of hair, and smoothing her
shawl, "how much learning I have picked up from the
many professors who used to eat beneath my roof."
The elderly monitor of the Muses gathered in the empty
mugs of Tosh and Burdle, who were loitering over their
afternoon beer, and departed.
"Curious creature," whispered Burdle heavily, with a
knowing look at Tosh.
"Very," returned Tosh, with the air of an authority.
Mrs. Bodleberry reappeared with two full mugs and a
disposition to eloquence. Opportunities were rare in her
house, and she was not going to let them slide by un
accosted.
"This is on the house," said she pleasantly; "and it's
nothing to what's on my mind these days. What with
McGoozle coming with his crowd to drink my beer; and
Mundle coming with his, it's a mercy there ain't been a
murder in the place. Such cold looks in the hallway,
such raisings of the voice, and such knockings of the
hands as are enough to freeze the very blood in your
veins. If there was to be a funeral tomorrow, like the
traveling parson's daughter we buried from here last
April, I'd be put out to know where to look for a steady
table to hold the flowers; they're that wobbly from being
pounded.
"And only yesterday, I was talking to one of them,
and he said the whole commotion was over teachers.
Teachers, my stars! As if I hadn't had trouble enough
with 'em already."
"But my dear woman," broke in Tosh blandly with
his best let-the-heathen-be-converted manner, "this is a
larger issue. McGoozle has a Bill to protect the rights
of the young; to preserve unharmed their native purity
of er,"
"Soul?" question Burdle.
"Yes, of soul, by all means."
Mrs. Bodleberry snorted and gathered up the empty
mugs again.
"Such rot," she remarked, "and you two old enough to
know better, and believe it. Don't tell me! If they'd
do what they're paid to do and stop, there'd be no fuss.
They ain't paid to form the morals of the next genera
tion; not that I know of. They're paid to dispense facts,
like a plumber's paid to lay pipe. Who'd ever think of
letting old Mr. Blake, even though he's prayed and laid
pipe all his life, go out telling the young what to do?
Such nonsense. Mr. Blake's sensible, and doesn't want
to, which is more than I can say of some.
"Besides," she continued, "from what I've seen of
'em, I can say as a wife and mother that when they're
not peddling facts, they're most always wrong!"
Her latter identity was instantly proved by the wild
eyed appearance of Bodleberry, Jr., in the doorway,
much out of breath, and much addicted to jerkey mo
tions of the arms.
"They're going it good!" he shouted gleefully. "Twice
they tried to hit each other, and the whole place's in a
mess. Come on over, ma!"
Mrs. Bodleberry departed for the House; the empty
mugs still in her hand. Tosh and Burdle hurried after.
In the back room, a thin line of beer wandered un
certainly over the uneven table top, and finally drizzled
off onto the floor in several loud splashes.
