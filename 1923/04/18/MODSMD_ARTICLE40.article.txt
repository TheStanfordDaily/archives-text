# Today Seventeenth Anniversary Of Disastrous Earthquake
## 
### 
On April 18, 1906, at 5:07 a. m., one
of the worst earthquakes in the history of
California shook the Stanford campus,
partially destroying many of the new
University buildings and killing two men.
Seventeen years ago today saw utter con
fusion about the Farm, with practically
no communication with the outside world
and the usual series of wild reports con
cerning local catastrophes.
According to Charlie Wooster, coach
man for the Stanford family, and now a
fixture at Encina hall, the quake was
out of a clear sky, with only one warn
ing and that of a most recondite char
acter. Wooster said that for several
days before the shudder he noticed farm
animals acting in a peculiar way; holding
their heads near the ground and appar
ently listening. This phenomenon was
not signficant at the time, but after the
shock he»recalled it and is now con
vinced of the relation.
The tremblor was first noticeable in
a slight swaying motion of the ground,
folowed by a series of jolts and coming
to a climax in a sharp twist. The twist
brought about most of the damage, as it
wrenched foundations and felled chim-;
neys all over the University property.
Almost no building escaped unhurt, and
several were completely wrecked. Dr.
Jordan estimated the damage to be about
$2,800,000, but public opinion held it to
be at least twice as gr&it. It was later
announced as less than expccted.
Junius R. Hanna, *08, of Rradford,
Pa., was caught by a falling chimney in
Encina and carried through to the base
ment. Students found him after two
hours' digging, but he died soon after.
The other casualty was Otto Gerdis, an ;
employe of the University, who was j
buried under the ruins of a huge chim-1
ney at the power house. He was dead !
when reached. There were six others
injured, but none seriously.
Possibly the most miraculous escape
of the day was in the old Roble hall,
which is now Sequoia. Four women
sleeping on the top story were carried
through to the first floor by a collapsing
chimney and escaped without a scratch.
The possible origin of the Encina "Pa
jamarino Parade" came when 300 men
staged a dramatic rush for outdoors and !
safety. They found the, doors locked, I
Wooster said, but they have never been |
locked since.
The most famous remark of the time
was made by "Doug" Ferry, '08, a bril
liant luminary of Chaparral. A large
statue of Agassiz fell thirty feet head
first from Zoology gilding, and was
buried to the chest in a concrete walk.
Ferry surveyed the scene and philosophi
cally remarked, "Well, he makes more
impression in the concrete than he did in
the abstract." ■
The incomplete Library and Gym
nasium directly across Palm Drive from
the Museum were wrecked, and have
never been rebuilt. The Memorial
Church was badly shattered and has
not been restored to the original plan.
The roof and the organ were injured,
and the mosaics were totally destroyed.
The Memorial Arch at the center front
of the outer Quad was shaken down and
the base split. This brought about re
joicing as well as grief, inasmuch as its

beauty and fitness had often been ques-
I tioned.
About half the arcade in the rear of
the Quad fell, and there still remains a
gap in the rear of the church. The
Museum sustained a severe loss. The
Egyptian collection was buried under
i debris in the cellar, and valuable col
j lections of paintings and Venetian glasses
were destroyed. Every cent of the loss
j was sustained by the University, as there
{ was no insurance upon any building.
The Daily Palo Alto issued two sin
gle-sheet special extras on the day of the
j quake, and then returned to the usual
editions. Classes were immediately sus
pended until a committee of Engineering
faculty members could inspect the build
i ings and condemn those which had been
dangerously strained. On Friday, April
; 19, it was decided useless to attempt to
' continue, and the quarter was closed.
Students of good standing received their
I credits, and doubtful members were
given special examinations.
Two professors left the campus in one
|of those new-fangled automobiles to
carry 200 telegrams to a point from
| which they could be sent. Wires were
down in both directions from Palo Alto,
and railroad communication was pre
carious. The mails were stopped.
The closing of the University year cre-
I atcd a problem. Students naturally did
! not have sufficient money for transporta
tion, and there was no way of getting
jit from home. The banks were all closed
land the University, Well-Fargo Express
l Company, and Western Union had verv
; little cash on hand. The Southern Pa
j citic finally made an arrangement to sell
j tickets upon the indorsement of a bank
official certifying a deposit in his bank.
Students made their way to Stocton and
caught trains there.
The damage to individual frame build
ings on the campus was materially less
than that suffered by University struc
tures. The Chi Psi house was torn ten
feet off its foundations, and the floors
i were ripped out. The occupants camped
| in tents until the house was rebuilt. Beta
| Theta and Delta Kappa Epsilon suf
i fered heavily, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
J was damaged to the extent of $500, and
| lost a handsome collection of steins val
! ued at $200. Fallen plaster and minor
I injuries were suffered by almost every
j building.
Instruction was resumed a few months
i later, and Wooster is of the opinion that
i very few students were frightened away.
