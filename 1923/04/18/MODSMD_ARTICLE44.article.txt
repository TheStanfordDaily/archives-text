# Treaty Of 1915 Causes Trouble In China, Says Professor Treat
## 
### 
China, economically sound, but
struggling under one of the worst
political regimes that makes a pre
tense of functioning in the world to
day, is no nearer unification than it
was six years ago. This is the opinion
of Professor Payson J. Treat, head of
the history department, set forth in
talking over the recent development
of conditions In the Far East. Rejec
tion of the terms of the 1915 treaty
cannot be enforced because of the
inefficiency of the present administra
tion, and Japan continues to keep her
hold on Dairen and Port Arthur.
Four Campaigns Going On
"At present at least four military
campaigns are going on between rival
political leaders," said Professor
Treat, "and the people who are caught
in the zones of fighting have to pay
the price."
According to Professor Treat, the
international question which has been
raised by the abrogation of the 1915
treaty between China and Japan is
causing a great deal of the difficulty.
Treaty Concerns Port Arthur
This treaty is concerned principally
with the extension of the lease of
Dairen and Port Arthur, which is
now held by Japan. The abrogation of
this agreement is based on a resolu
tion of the Chinese parliament, which
denounced the treaty as having been
secured by pressure during the presi
dency of Yuan Chi Kai. Japan has re
fused to accept China's denunciation

of the treaty. In ordinary international
relations China's next step would be
to act upon the denunciation and take
measures to expel the Japanese.
Chia Cannot Force Japan
"China cannot make the Japanese
withdraw from the country because
the Peking government is unable to
control many of the Chinese provinces
or even a small fraction of the one
and a half million soldiers under
arms," said Professor Treat, "go she
is in no position to move against the
Japanese, and, if the Japanese should
voluntarily retire from the fine port
of Dairen, it would only mean a trans
fer of this territory to General Chang,
the war-lord of Manchuria, who seems
to be preparing to send his divisions
against the generate who support
Peking.
Rights Secured by Force
"With few exceptions all rights and
privileges which Americans, Euro
peans, and Japanese enjoy in China
have been secured by force, and, if
the Japanese treaty can be success
fully abrogated on these grounds, all
other forced treaties should fall as
well a prospect which hardly can be
viewed with enthusiasm by Europeans
or Americans dealing with China.
"The solution of China's problem
must be worked out from within," de
clared Treat, "and we look forward
to great constructive service from the
young Chinese men and women who
are being educated at Stanford and
other American universities."
