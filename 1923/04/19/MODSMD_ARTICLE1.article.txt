# SPRING TRACK RALLY TO BE HELD TONIGHT IN ASSEMBLY
## TEMPLETON TO SPEAK Parade to Start Down Row At 7:15; Allen Will Lead Singing 
### 
Every description of noise-mak
ing contrivance will be permitted
at the Rally except firearms. Comp
troller Roth has asked that no fire
arms be brought into the Assembly
hall this evening and as the hall
was secured by his special permis
sion, students are asked to abide
by this ruling.

Cardinal supporters will have their
first opportunity of hearing the opin
ion of an expert on the track pros
pects for 1923 when Coach "Dink"
Templeton takes the center of the
stage in the track rally tonight at 7:15
at the Assembly hall.
Bill Sisson, '16, former intercollegi
ate champion in the broad jump, will
also give a talk on Stanford's hopes
this year. Sisson, while in college, held
a record of 24 feet. He always jumped
consistently around 23 feet, and was
considered a first place in every meet.
Sisson has been interested in every
big meet since he left the University,
and has officiated at several of the
contests.
Bill Fletcher is not certain that he
can be present, but his message is
"The Stanford competitors typify the
athlete that has been developed since
entering college. We can not depend
on stars, but it is up to the combined
efforts of the squad to win."
Fletcher was a track athlete in his
undergraduate years, competing in the
half-mile and mile.
Captain Lane Falk will be the third
principle speaker. Falk is doped to
tally ten points for the Cards in the
hurdle races Saturday. It will be the
first opportunity students have had to
hear the varsity track captain speak,
and his opinion as to the final out
come should prove interesting.
The Rally starts at 7:15. The parade
