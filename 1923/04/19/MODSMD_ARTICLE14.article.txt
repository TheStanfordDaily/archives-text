# LEAGUE NINES WIN IN FIVE SLOW GAMES
## 
### 
Five intramural baseball teams won
their games by top-heavy scores yester
day afternoon. The results of the games
were: Phi Kappa Sigma 18, Kappa
Alpha 8; El Campo 20, Theta Chi 1;
Delta Chi 17, Sequoia second 4; Alpha
Delta Phi 19, Encina third 5; S. A. E.
11, Los Arcos 3. The Delta Chi-Sequoia
game was scheduled for Tuesday, but
had to be postponed because of rain.
The Phi Kap-Kappa Alpha game
looked like a real contest for the first
three innings. At the end of the third
the score stood 4 to 3 for Kappa Alpha,
but the Phi Kaps got going in the first
half of the fourth, scoring four runs.
Neither team scored in the fifth, but
the Phi Kappa Sigma team pushed four
across in the sixth, holding their op
ponents scoreless. In the seventh the
Phi Kaps made seven more, bringing
their total to 18. The K. A. outfit tried
to scare up a rally, but the best they
could do was to score fourruns.
Wright pitched a-good game for the
Phi Kappa Sibma team and was given
good support by his teammates in the
field. Kappa Alpha seemed to be un
able to hold on to the ball and a num-
her of the Phi Kap runs were due to
their opponents' errors.
El Campo had little difficulty with
Theta Chi, scoring twenty runs in four
innings. All of the El Campo men hit
the ball hard and frequently, and when
they couldn't hit they were generally
given a free ticket to first base by Bud
Blosser, the Theta Chi moundsman.
Smith, pitching for El Campo, did not
walk a single man and allowed but three
hits during the contest.
'1 he Los Arcos team was not up to the
brand of ball it played against Phi Kap
pa Sigma last week and lost to the
S. A. E.'s by the score of 11 to 3.
Summy, the S. A. E. twirlerm, was the
bright light for his team. He allowed
five hits, walked two, and struck out ten.
Besides this he did the best work with
the bat for his team. Hamilton allowed
ten hits and his teammates bungled the
ball enough to let most of the hits turn
into runs.
1 he Alpha Delta Phi nine won from
Encina third by the score of 19 to 5.
Griffen pitched a good game for En
cina, but the other eight members of the
team were unable to hang on to the pill,
so his good pitching went for naught.
The Alpha Delts had the game on ice
after the first two innings. Loomis,
Dennis, and Widaman did the best work
in the hittiug department for the win
ners. Sewell played a good game for
the losers.
Delta Chi completely outclassed the
Sequoia players. The Delta Chi players
displayed a more finished brand of base
ball than their opponents, and Reticker
heaved a good game of ball, holding
Sequoia scoreless through the first few
innings. Coplen, Lytel, Hay. and Tritle
showed up best with the club for the
winners.
Games scheduled for today are: Sigma
Chi vs. Beta Theta Chi; Delta Upsilon
vs. Alpha Tau Omega; El Tigre vs. El
Capitan; Breakers vs. Sequoia first.
