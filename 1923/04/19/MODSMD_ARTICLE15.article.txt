# AMERICAN COLLEGE CLUB ADDRESSED BY DAVID STARR JORDAN
## 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan was one of
the speakers at the meeting of the
new American College Club, held at
the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, to
day. Dr. George Malcom Stratton,
president of the psychological board
for America, lectured. Jean Cardinal,
French tenor, accompanied by Jo
sephine Marshall Fernald, gave two
songs. Mrs. Horace Pillsbury was
chairman for the day and, with Miss
Alicia Marie Flager, chairman of the
organization, presided at tea.
The American College Club was or
ganized to develop local talent and to
study subjects pertinent to modern
life without a great outlay of money
for lecturers, many of whom are of
doubtful authority. In this way, the
club's promoters believe, California
money will be kept in California and
may be used for the upbuilding of
Western universities.
