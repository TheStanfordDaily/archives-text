# SUDDEN NOT TO ENTER TRACK MEET, THOUGH ELIGIBLE BY RULES
## ARTHUR HURLS DISCUS 133 FEET, RAISING CARD HOPES IN FIELD EVENTS 
### 
Eddie Sudden has not registered in the University and will not, in all
probability, compete against California Saturday, according to advice received
from the Registrar and a member of the faculty committee on athletics today.
It was reported yesterday afternoon that Sudden, who won the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes in the Big Meet last year, had registered. He
applied for a book yesterday but until noon he had not completed registration.
It is improbable that he will compete in the Big Meet should he register,
according to a member of the faculty committee on athletics, although be
would be technically eligible.
Big Jim Arthur gave the wiseacres something to ponder over yesterday
afternoon when he heaved the discus 133 feet in practice. The big fellow
couldn't seem to toss the platter less than 129 feet. He was loosening up
when he threw and seemed to have hit his stride.
This puts a different aspect on the discus event in Saturday's meet as few
sporting writers or fans thought of giving the Cards more than a third.
Neufeldt, of the Bears, has made the best heave on the Berkeley oval this
year. He threw 133 feet in the U. S. C. meet. Should Arthur succeed in
equalling the throw he made yesterday, he is assured of a second place, with
the possibility that he may win as Neufeldt has not been consistent. Muller

'and Berkey are the other Blue and
Gold hopes in the dißcus but neither of
them has done 130 feet this year.
Campbell and Richards may surprise
and break into the point column for
Stanford.
Templeton's squad is still a some
what doubtful quantity in the other
field events. It will be the case of in
experienced men against seasoned
tracbsters and the meet will depend
largely on the results.
Minsky Improving
In the broad jump, Treyer, Muller,
and Boren of the Bruin squad have
been favored to take nine points, but
with the showing Minsky has been
making lately, they will have to extend
themselves to keep him out of second
place. His jump of 22 feet 7 1-4 inches
in the All Southern Conference meet
last Friday only lacks a few inches of
equalling the best leap any of the
Bears have made this year. Minsky
has changed his style of jumping and
is getting more power and distance
in the past two weeks.
Muller, Treyer, and Dalton are
Christie's best bets in the high jump.
Muller has not done better than six
feet this year, which is exactly Kem
nitzer's best mark for the season. Mul
ler and Treyer are more experienced
jumpers, however, and Kemnitzer will
have to come through or accept third
place. Ludeke and Arthur are capable
of doing nearly six feet and if either
of them is at his best, there is a chance
of doing nearly six feet and if either
of them is at his best, there is a chance
for an upset.
California Strong in Javelin
California is favored to score heav
ily in the javelin, with veterans like
Sorrenti, Neufeldt, and Peterson
throwing the spear around 190 feet.
The Card entries, Eskew, Farish, and
Kelly, are all capable of doing around
185 feet. It scarcely looks probable
that Stanford will take better than a
third, with the possibility of a second
if Sorenti or Neufeldt fall down.
Witter, of the Blue and Gold squad,
seems to be sure of five points in the
shot put. From comparative distances,
it looks like a fight between Richards
of Stanford, and Lang of California for
second place, with the odds slightly in
favor of Lang. Ludeke and Arthur of
the Cards, and Neufeldt and Mathews
of the Bears may come through and
change the results materially.
The results in the pole vault rest
entirely on the condition of Bill
Black's bad ankle. If Black is in good
shape, he should win easily, as Norris
has been doing rather poorly this year.
If' Black is not in shape, it will be a
fight between the red-headed Califor
nian and Scofield for first, with Den
nis and Garner contesting for the other
place.

of Stanford, and Lang of California for
second place, with the odds slightly in
favor of Lang. Ludeke and Arthur of
the Cards, and Neufeldt and Mathews
of the Bears may come through and
change the results materially.
The results in the pole vault rest
entirely on the condition of Bill
Black's bad ankle. If Black is in good
shape, he should win easily, as Norris
has been doing rather poorly this year.
If' Black is not in shape, it will be a
fight between the red-headed Califor
nian and Scofield for first, with Den
nis and Garner contesting for the other
place.
Eddie Sudden has not registered in the University and will not, in all
probability, compete against California Saturday, according to advice received
from the Registrar and a member of the faculty committee on athletics today.
It was reported yesterday afternoon that Sudden, who won the hundred
and two-twenty yard dashes in the Big Meet last year, had registered. He
applied for a book yesterday but until noon he had not completed registration.
It is improbable that he will compete in the Big Meet should he register,
according to a member of the faculty committee on athletics, although be
would be technically eligible.
Big Jim Arthur gave the wiseacres something to ponder over yesterday
afternoon when he heaved the discus 133 feet in practice. The big fellow
couldn't seem to toss the platter less than 129 feet. He was loosening up
when he threw and seemed to have hit his stride.
This puts a different aspect on the discus event in Saturday's meet as few
sporting writers or fans thought of giving the Cards more than a third.
Neufeldt, of the Bears, has made the best heave on the Berkeley oval this
year. He threw 133 feet in the U. S. C. meet. Should Arthur succeed in
equalling the throw he made yesterday, he is assured of a second place, with
the possibility that he may win as Neufeldt has not been consistent. Muller

'and Berkey are the other Blue and
Gold hopes in the dißcus but neither of
them has done 130 feet this year.
Campbell and Richards may surprise
and break into the point column for
Stanford.
Templeton's squad is still a some
what doubtful quantity in the other
field events. It will be the case of in
experienced men against seasoned
tracbsters and the meet will depend
largely on the results.
Minsky Improving
In the broad jump, Treyer, Muller,
and Boren of the Bruin squad have
been favored to take nine points, but
with the showing Minsky has been
making lately, they will have to extend
themselves to keep him out of second
place. His jump of 22 feet 7 1-4 inches
in the All Southern Conference meet
last Friday only lacks a few inches of
equalling the best leap any of the
Bears have made this year. Minsky
has changed his style of jumping and
is getting more power and distance
in the past two weeks.
Muller, Treyer, and Dalton are
Christie's best bets in the high jump.
Muller has not done better than six
feet this year, which is exactly Kem
nitzer's best mark for the season. Mul
ler and Treyer are more experienced
jumpers, however, and Kemnitzer will
have to come through or accept third
place. Ludeke and Arthur are capable
of doing nearly six feet and if either
of them is at his best, there is a chance
of doing nearly six feet and if either
of them is at his best, there is a chance
for an upset.
California Strong in Javelin
California is favored to score heav
ily in the javelin, with veterans like
Sorrenti, Neufeldt, and Peterson
throwing the spear around 190 feet.
The Card entries, Eskew, Farish, and
Kelly, are all capable of doing around
185 feet. It scarcely looks probable
that Stanford will take better than a
third, with the possibility of a second
if Sorenti or Neufeldt fall down.
Witter, of the Blue and Gold squad,
seems to be sure of five points in the
shot put. From comparative distances,
it looks like a fight between Richards
of Stanford, and Lang of California for
second place, with the odds slightly in
favor of Lang. Ludeke and Arthur of
the Cards, and Neufeldt and Mathews
of the Bears may come through and
change the results materially.
