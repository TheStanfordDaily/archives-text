# GRIDMEN WILL MEET IN PRACTICE GAMES FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
First grid scrimmages of the spring
practice season will be held on the old
football field tomorrow afternoon be
ginning at 4:15. Six elevens will par
ticipate, each for a period of ten min
utes.
Coaches "Pop" Warner, Andy Kerr,
and "Tiny" Thornhill have been work
ing patiently with their charges for the
past two weeks, allowing them to get
acquainted wtih the ball by booting it
around, falling on it, together with a
little passing work. One of the better
teams has been used for experimentation
â€”to see how plays which look pretty
good "on paper" really work out.
Many of the men who will take part
in the workouts tomorrow have had
little previous experience. Warner wishes
there were more of this type reporting.
And there are several old varsity vet
erans and freshmen stars in suits, too.
True, this is only spring, but the tempt
ing pigskin and eighty odd men scram
bling after it, may offer some interested
students a pretty fair hour of enjoy
ment.
