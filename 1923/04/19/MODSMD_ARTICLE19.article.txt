# FRESHMEN VICTORS IN DEBATES WITH BRUINS
## 
### 
â€¢By a unanimous decision at Berke
ley, and a two-to-one vote at Stanford,
the freshman debaters defeated the
California freshmen in simultaneous
debates last night on the question,
"Resolved, that California and Stan
ford should restrict their intercollegi
ate athletic competition to contests
with each other." The Cardinal team
consisted of Stanley Weigel and Burn
ham Beckwith, arguing the negative
side at Berkeley, and Walter Odemar
and W. Leslie Goeslin upholding the
affirmative here.
The affirmative emphasized the
need for more extensive intramural
competition, and attacked the present
system of college sports. The negative
speakers upheld intercollegiate compe
tition as a wholesome recreation. The
financial difficulties of the proposed
system and the present sufficiency of
intramural sports were also stressed.
The Reverend W. B. Thorp, Profes
sor Tom Pete Cross of the University
of Chicago, and Postmaster W. H.
Kelly of Palo Alto judged the debate
at Stanford.
