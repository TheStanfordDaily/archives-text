# HOOVER LIBRARY GETS GERMAN DOCUMENTS
## 
### 
A valuable collection of German offi
cial documents and books has just come
into the Hoover War Library from Otto
Wiedfeldt, Minister from Germany at
Washington, i_>. C.
This new material is supplementary
to that secured by Professor Adams, di
rector of the Hoover Library, when he
was in Berlin last year, and by Pro
fessor Lutz, two years l ago.
Among the papers are documents con
cerning the outbreak of the war and
conduct of military operations. Propa
ganda pamphlets, leaflets bearing on
problems of peace, and documents from
the peace conference and especially from
diplomatic activities since the armistice
make up a large part of the shipment.
In a letter to Professor Adams from
Wiedfeldt he expresses the hope that
the Berlin Foreign Office will be able to
furnish additional material through the
German embassy to the Hoover collec
tion.
