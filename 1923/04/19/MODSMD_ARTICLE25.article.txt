# AS TO SUDDEN

### 
If Eddie Sudden were to be allowed to compete
Saturday it would be rather unfortunate for Stan
ford's reputation in intercollegiate sports compe
tition.
Although no technical rules of eligibility will be
violated, the public will not readily justify the last
minute entering of a man which might mean victory
in the annual meet for Stanford. It is doubtful
whether the benefit which might accrue from such
a victory after repeated defeats would offset the feel
ing of unsportsmanlike action which is bound to
arise among followers of college athletics.
When word first circulated around the campus
that Sudden intended registering this week and
would probably be able to run for the Cardinal Sat
urday, student sentiment immediately divided itself
between those who believe we ought to win at any
cost and those who felt that such action would be
contrary to the ethical standards which we have es
tablished for ourselves.
The only way that Sudden's appearance could be
justified would be for him to remain in college for
the remainder of the quarter. However, that would
come after the damage was done and outsiders would
still feel that his only purpose in coming back was
to furnish Stanford with enough additional points to
win the meet. Criticism of the conduct of collegiate
athletics and the disproportionate part they play in
student life is current throughout the country, and
Stanford as one of the leading institutions of learn
ing, cannot well afford to be the target for direct
disapproval on such a score, especially in view of
the sentiment which San Francisco sports writers
have created by the publicity given the matter.
