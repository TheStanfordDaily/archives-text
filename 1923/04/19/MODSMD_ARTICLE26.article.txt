# THE 						SPRING CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Many are wondering - why the Executive Commit
tee has seen fit to banish the spring carnival in favor
of a masquerade ball. The principal reason is that
the gymnasium will not be available, and the sug
gested plan of holding the affair on the Row did not
meet with favor.
Even if there were no such practical explanations
'of their action, the committee would have been wise
to call off the carnival for this year. Four years ago
the first carnival was held and in that time it has
won for itself the dignified name of tradition.
Those who lament the steady disappearance of
"traditions" may be consoled by the fact that the
carnival has not been abolished, but the masquerade
merely substituted for the present year.
The carnival is an effective means of raising
money when there is immediate need, but it is a
heavy drain on student time and money at a particu
larly busy and expensive time of the year. The op
portunity for ingenuity and originality in such an
affair will be increased if it is not held so often.
