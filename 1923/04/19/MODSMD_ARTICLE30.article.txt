U. C., April 19, 8 a. m.—Joe Fizzlehiermer, star pole
vaulter, will be out of the big meet with a broken
wishbone, Head Coach Goofus confided to our special
correspondent today. He said that Fizzlehiermer broke
it wishing too hard that he could pass his course in
History of Ancient Egyptian Coins.
* • •
10 a. m—"Yes, of course, Fizzleheirmer will be out
of the big meet," replied Head Coach Goofus in an
answer to a question just now. "I know I said his wish
bone wasn't cracked. It isn't. It's broken."
* * *
Stanford, April 19, 10:30 a. m.—"We are going to
spring a big surprise!" was the startling announcement
made just now by an erstwhile member of the Card
team in regard to the big meet Saturday. "We are
training a four-mile runner, and will run him in a special
event. That will mean five points, as the Blue and Gold
have not thought of that scheme and have not been
preparing any four-milers."
* * •
U. C., April 19, 11:00 a. m.—"Yes, Fizzleheirmer will
be out of the big meet, but not this year," said Head
Coach Goofus just now. "I hear the Cards are going to
surprise us with a four-mile runner. They can't run
him—he's ineligible," was the sarcastic remark of the
head coach. "It takes any man they've got so long to
run the four-mile that he couldn't possibly do that even
once during the season and still keep up his studies."
* * *
Stanford, April 19, 11:26 a. m.—"A lie!" was the suc
cint statement issued by Oscar Blumph, signboard
scorer, when asked if the Card four-miler had been de
clared ineligible. "It's a lie! Our four-miler is not in
eligible—we haven't got any."
* * *
U. C., April 19, 12:01. —"We can't help but win this
meet," confided a member of the track team a few min
utes ago to our correspondent. "We're going to change
the name of all the track events on the program to field
events, and as we are Conceded a big edge in the field
events, the outcome can hardly be uncertain."

SOULFUL PROTEST
I like a house party, I always eat hearty,
But tell me, why is it I choose,
For the room where I nap, one beneath some bright chap
Who at night's always dropping his shoes?
The day has been blissful, the evening quite kissful,
I'm happy but then get the blues.
I could kill —Heaven love me! —that darn fool above me
Who wakes me by dropping his shoes.
I've had a great day and at last hit the hay,
In darkness I lie there and muse,
When I'm scared by a clumping—a rattling bumping—
The gink upstairs dropping his shoes!
Oh house parties are great, I'm willing to state,
But why, nightly ruin my snooze?
By causing perturbance with noisy disturbance.
Above me by dropping both shoes!

We have a Lincoln roadster parked in a quiet spot on
the beach. CalMt eleven at night, make sure that there
are no lights on the car, and notice the silence. That's
the setting.
A hard-boiled motor cop rattles along on his Harley.
He sees the lightless, soundless, motionless roadster
and sticks out his lower jaw. Drawing up alongsdie he
bellows:
"Hey there —how about a light?"
A sudden flurry of activity, a subdued squeak, and a
slightly bewildered youth peers over the side.
"I'm sorry, old man—l don't smoke."

FAITH
Her well coiffed hair is never mussed.
Her vapid manner never fussed.
With baby stare just so blas6.
She looks her best d6collet6.
I
Her evening gown with color scheme
Like a maniac's vision or cubist's dream.
And shoulder straps of dainty gold
Are not much good against the cold;
But if those straps should ever bust —
Just breathe a prayer, "In God we trust."
—Log.

The frugal violet lives its life
Where sturdy oaks won't grow—
But have you seen a violet
A-blooming in the snow?
The violet springs from rocks and sand
Where lofty trees would croak —
But speaking of their span of years
Did you ever pick an oak?
-WAMBA.
• * *
All Stanford sports, from the latest reports.
Are down in a terrible slump,
And Cardinal teams are duds, it seems;
They can't quite get over the hump.
Now, the thing to do is for me and you
To go out there and yell like hell —
It'll help the bunch if they have a hunch
That the stands are wishing them well.

Harold was unlucky. Just how unlucky no one but
Harold knew. For example, when the professor had a
particularly nasty question to put, Harold always got it.
If there was a loose board in the sidewalk, Harold al
ways fell through it, just In time to serve as a warning
to others.
Harold was always getting short-changed, bumped,
sidetracked. He was the original divorced husband of
Lady Luck herself.
And so, for days in advance, Harold looked forward
to Friday the Thirteenth as one who looks forward to a
day of sentence.

I like a house party, I always eat hearty,
But tell me, why is it I choose,
For the room where I nap, one beneath some bright chap
Who at night's always dropping his shoes?
The day has been blissful, the evening quite kissful,
I'm happy but then get the blues.
I could kill —Heaven love me! —that darn fool above me
Who wakes me by dropping his shoes.
I've had a great day and at last hit the hay,
In darkness I lie there and muse,
When I'm scared by a clumping—a rattling bumping—
The gink upstairs dropping his shoes!
Oh house parties are great, I'm willing to state,
But why, nightly ruin my snooze?
By causing perturbance with noisy disturbance.
Above me by dropping both shoes!

We have a Lincoln roadster parked in a quiet spot on
the beach. CalMt eleven at night, make sure that there
are no lights on the car, and notice the silence. That's
the setting.
A hard-boiled motor cop rattles along on his Harley.
He sees the lightless, soundless, motionless roadster
and sticks out his lower jaw. Drawing up alongsdie he
bellows:
"Hey there —how about a light?"
A sudden flurry of activity, a subdued squeak, and a
slightly bewildered youth peers over the side.
"I'm sorry, old man—l don't smoke."

Her well coiffed hair is never mussed.
Her vapid manner never fussed.
With baby stare just so blas6.
She looks her best d6collet6.
I
Her evening gown with color scheme
Like a maniac's vision or cubist's dream.
And shoulder straps of dainty gold
Are not much good against the cold;
But if those straps should ever bust —
Just breathe a prayer, "In God we trust."

The frugal violet lives its life
Where sturdy oaks won't grow—
But have you seen a violet
A-blooming in the snow?
The violet springs from rocks and sand
Where lofty trees would croak —
But speaking of their span of years

All Stanford sports, from the latest reports.
Are down in a terrible slump,
And Cardinal teams are duds, it seems;
They can't quite get over the hump.
Now, the thing to do is for me and you
To go out there and yell like hell —
It'll help the bunch if they have a hunch
That the stands are wishing them well.

Harold was unlucky. Just how unlucky no one but
Harold knew. For example, when the professor had a
particularly nasty question to put, Harold always got it.
If there was a loose board in the sidewalk, Harold al
ways fell through it, just In time to serve as a warning
to others.
Harold was always getting short-changed, bumped,
sidetracked. He was the original divorced husband of
Lady Luck herself.
And so, for days in advance, Harold looked forward
to Friday the Thirteenth as one who looks forward to a
day of sentence.

made just now by an erstwhile member of the Card

The violet springs from rocks and sand

All Stanford sports, from the latest reports.
Are down in a terrible slump,
And Cardinal teams are duds, it seems;
They can't quite get over the hump.

To go out there and yell like hell —
It'll help the bunch if they have a hunch
That the stands are wishing them well.

Harold was unlucky. Just how unlucky no one but
Harold knew. For example, when the professor had a
particularly nasty question to put, Harold always got it.
If there was a loose board in the sidewalk, Harold al
ways fell through it, just In time to serve as a warning
to others.
Harold was always getting short-changed, bumped,
sidetracked. He was the original divorced husband of
Lady Luck herself.
And so, for days in advance, Harold looked forward
to Friday the Thirteenth as one who looks forward to a
day of sentence.

U. C., April 19, 8 a. m.—Joe Fizzlehiermer, star pole
vaulter, will be out of the big meet with a broken
wishbone, Head Coach Goofus confided to our special
correspondent today. He said that Fizzlehiermer broke
it wishing too hard that he could pass his course in
History of Ancient Egyptian Coins.
* • •
10 a. m—"Yes, of course, Fizzleheirmer will be out
of the big meet," replied Head Coach Goofus in an
answer to a question just now. "I know I said his wish
bone wasn't cracked. It isn't. It's broken."
* * *
Stanford, April 19, 10:30 a. m.—"We are going to
spring a big surprise!" was the startling announcement
made just now by an erstwhile member of the Card
team in regard to the big meet Saturday. "We are
training a four-mile runner, and will run him in a special
event. That will mean five points, as the Blue and Gold
have not thought of that scheme and have not been
preparing any four-milers."
* * •
U. C., April 19, 11:00 a. m.—"Yes, Fizzleheirmer will
be out of the big meet, but not this year," said Head
Coach Goofus just now. "I hear the Cards are going to
surprise us with a four-mile runner. They can't run
him—he's ineligible," was the sarcastic remark of the
head coach. "It takes any man they've got so long to
run the four-mile that he couldn't possibly do that even
once during the season and still keep up his studies."
* * *
Stanford, April 19, 11:26 a. m.—"A lie!" was the suc
cint statement issued by Oscar Blumph, signboard
scorer, when asked if the Card four-miler had been de
clared ineligible. "It's a lie! Our four-miler is not in
eligible—we haven't got any."
* * *
U. C., April 19, 12:01. —"We can't help but win this
meet," confided a member of the track team a few min
utes ago to our correspondent. "We're going to change
the name of all the track events on the program to field
events, and as we are Conceded a big edge in the field
events, the outcome can hardly be uncertain."

SOULFUL PROTEST
I like a house party, I always eat hearty,
But tell me, why is it I choose,
For the room where I nap, one beneath some bright chap
Who at night's always dropping his shoes?
The day has been blissful, the evening quite kissful,
I'm happy but then get the blues.
I could kill —Heaven love me! —that darn fool above me
Who wakes me by dropping his shoes.
I've had a great day and at last hit the hay,
In darkness I lie there and muse,
When I'm scared by a clumping—a rattling bumping—
The gink upstairs dropping his shoes!
Oh house parties are great, I'm willing to state,
But why, nightly ruin my snooze?
By causing perturbance with noisy disturbance.
Above me by dropping both shoes!

We have a Lincoln roadster parked in a quiet spot on
the beach. CalMt eleven at night, make sure that there
are no lights on the car, and notice the silence. That's
the setting.
A hard-boiled motor cop rattles along on his Harley.
He sees the lightless, soundless, motionless roadster
and sticks out his lower jaw. Drawing up alongsdie he
bellows:
"Hey there —how about a light?"
A sudden flurry of activity, a subdued squeak, and a
slightly bewildered youth peers over the side.
"I'm sorry, old man—l don't smoke."
