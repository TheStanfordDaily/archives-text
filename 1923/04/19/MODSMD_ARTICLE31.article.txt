April 11-18, 1917
For the fifth consecutive time, the
Stanford varsity triumphed over Cali
fornia in the annual track and field
meet held on the Berkeley oval last
Saturday. The Card athletes came
through in wonderful style, and even
in the field events where Stanford was
supposed to be weakest, several sur
prises were sprung. Miller provided
the first bit of enthusiasm by taking
third in the hammer, thus upsetting
the dope that the Bears would make
a clean eweep in this event. Stanford
failed to place only in the broad jump.

Ten years ago, the University of
California coaches turned out a crew
that defeated Stanford in the annual
regatta between the Cards and Bears.
From the showing of the varsities Sat
urday on the Oakland Estuary, how
ever, it will be at least ten years more
before the feat is duplicated. For the
Cardinal triumphed over the best Blue
and Gold eight of years for the ninth
consecutive time and shattered again
the hopes of the Berkeleyites. The
regatta was a tri-cornered affair be
tween the University of Washington,
Stanford, and California. The north
erners, pulling a long, steady oar,
crossed the line first. Stanford was
second, with the Blue and Gold shell
two lengths to the rear.
