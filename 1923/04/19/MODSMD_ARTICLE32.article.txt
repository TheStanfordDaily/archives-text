To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
It is seldom that the writer would
care to take issue with any of the
editorial writers of the D. P. A. but
it is too much to expect an intelligent
person to remain silent after reading
in Tuesday's edition the editorial
titled "Result of Ignorance."
It certainly was the result of ig
norance. In the first place anyone with
the most superficial knowledge of psy
chology knows that such an article
would only stimulate interest in the
subject of the article and, I presume,
the object of the editorial was to dis
courage such interest. This is aside
from the question that many would
doubt the wisdom or propriety of
publishing such an article in the con
spicuous place of a D. P. A. editorial,
there is too much chance of misinter
pretation.
Secondly, it is surprising that "in
an institution of higher learning" any
one in the responsible position of an
editorial writer should think that some
of the works named should be classed'
as the "lowest learning." The Burton
edition of "Arabian Nights" is an un
abridged rendition of those classic
stories and to anyone who has read
it it ought to be apparent that there
is nothing in the book which could not
be read with profit by a mind of uni
versity calibre. The same applies to
"Decameron." As for the works of
Havelock Ellis I can not understand
how the writer of an editorial in,a
university paper could class them as
pornographic literature. Ellis is a re
cognized scientififc authority in his
field and I am sure that there are few
who know anything about the subject
of sex who would not recommend the
reading of his works by an intelligent
university student. The rare Hindu
volume so seductively referred to is,
I suppose. Vatsvayana's "Kama Sutra."
For your benefit I would like to inform
you that Vatsyayana was a theological
student and his book it written from
the religious standpoint of India six
teen hundred years ago. It has recent
ly been the subject of some intensive
studies in ancient literature and his
tory as well as from the standpoint of
scientific sex psychology.
I agree that some of the works
named by the writer of the above
mentioned editorial could not be read
with profit by anyone with a mind of
evident calibre of the author of that
article. I am thankful, however, that
his type of mind is not very common
at Stanford. Permit me to make the
humble suggestion that in the future
you do not permit your editorial writ
ers to write on subjects of which they
have little up-to-date knowledge—it
looks bad. and besides, it wastes
space. —XYZ, '22.

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
It is seldom that the writer would
care to take issue with any of the
editorial writers of the D. P. A. but
it is too much to expect an intelligent
person to remain silent after reading
in Tuesday's edition the editorial
titled "Result of Ignorance."
It certainly was the result of ig
norance. In the first place anyone with
the most superficial knowledge of psy
chology knows that such an article
would only stimulate interest in the
subject of the article and, I presume,
the object of the editorial was to dis
courage such interest. This is aside
from the question that many would
doubt the wisdom or propriety of
publishing such an article in the con
spicuous place of a D. P. A. editorial,
there is too much chance of misinter
pretation.
Secondly, it is surprising that "in
an institution of higher learning" any
one in the responsible position of an
editorial writer should think that some
of the works named should be classed'
as the "lowest learning." The Burton
edition of "Arabian Nights" is an un
abridged rendition of those classic
stories and to anyone who has read
it it ought to be apparent that there
is nothing in the book which could not
be read with profit by a mind of uni
versity calibre. The same applies to
"Decameron." As for the works of
Havelock Ellis I can not understand
how the writer of an editorial in,a
university paper could class them as
pornographic literature. Ellis is a re
cognized scientififc authority in his
field and I am sure that there are few
who know anything about the subject
of sex who would not recommend the
reading of his works by an intelligent
university student. The rare Hindu
volume so seductively referred to is,
I suppose. Vatsvayana's "Kama Sutra."
For your benefit I would like to inform
you that Vatsyayana was a theological
student and his book it written from
the religious standpoint of India six
teen hundred years ago. It has recent
ly been the subject of some intensive
studies in ancient literature and his
tory as well as from the standpoint of
scientific sex psychology.
I agree that some of the works
named by the writer of the above
mentioned editorial could not be read
with profit by anyone with a mind of
evident calibre of the author of that
article. I am thankful, however, that
his type of mind is not very common
at Stanford. Permit me to make the
humble suggestion that in the future
you do not permit your editorial writ
ers to write on subjects of which they
have little up-to-date knowledge—it
looks bad. and besides, it wastes
space. —XYZ, '22.
