# MODERN GASOLINE SUPPLY DEPOT IS ADDED TO CAMPUS
## 
### 
Stanford has taken another step in
favor of the campus motorist.
A modern concrete oil and gasoline
station, originally constructed at a cost
of $2,800, has been purchased by the
University from the Shell Company cf
California. It was moved on rollers
from Redwood City this morning and
will be placed at the right of the lire
station. It was bought for $250.
The building is made of white con
crete, and closely approaches the mission
sty 1 of architecture. There is room for
two drives at the end from which gaso
line will lie dispensed. The office and
depository for different grades of oils
at the other end, is glass-enclosed.
All the equipment which makes up a
first-class gas dispensary will be pur
chased and immediately installed. The
station will be ready for service to
campus motorists the latter part of next
week.
