# Professor H.C. Brown Discusses Philosophy of Education at Meeting
## 
### 
"Education should b e a control by con
scious guidance in order to find out the
meaning of things and the efforts to see
what they are good for," said Professor
H. C. Brown of the Philosophy depart
ment in his discussion of "John Dewey's
Philosophy of Education," at a meeting
of the Education Club in Room 50 of
the Education building last night.
In explaining Dewey's theories, Pro
fessor Brown said that education should
not be a preparation for the future.
Education goes on as long as life and
school is simply a good environment for
its beginning.
"Education is merely the development
of the capacity to think," said Professor
Brown. "Every school is trying to im
prove the education theories since the
time of Plato. One of the essentials
characteristics df man is trying to find
out what things are good for.
"The ordinary environment is not ade
quate to supply a training which will go
toward making a useful life. But I do
not believe that society should be gov
erned by the intellectual classes alone.
Such a condition would be a retrogres
sion to ancient Grecian times."
Professor Brown was a student of
Dewey at Columbia University and is an
authority on educational philosophy.
