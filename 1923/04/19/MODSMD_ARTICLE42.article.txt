# Mystery at Geneva
## 
### Rose Macaulay 
(Boni & Liveright, New York, N .Y.)
This book, from the pen of Rose
Macaulay, the author of "Potterism"
and "Dangerous Age," is difficult toj
review, inasmuch as all mystery
stories are peculiarly difficult to re- i
view. The reviewer must be constantly '
on his guard, or he will be broken.
For what is a mystery story without
the mystery, but an apple pie with-1
out the apples? Both are abomina-;
tions.
"Mystery at Geneva" is frankly in-;
tended to do nothing more than puz
zle the reader. The element of propa
ganda is entirely lacking. As stated
in the preface (which should not be
skipped) there is no attempt made to
pass judgment on the League of Na- j
tions though the story is built around i
a future session of the delegates at j
Geneva. The story concerns the con- i
secutive disappearances of certain in- j
fluential delegates, and the consterna-1
tion of the remaining members of the j
crippled body. Numerous bungling at
tempts to solve the enigma are made J
by the various newspaper reporters
(including the hero) but the final
denouement comes through the efforts
of a man who is consistently shown as
particularly odious. The experienced
reader of such stories will have little
trouble In ferreting out the villain,
even before he is apprehended. The
greatest mystery of the story is why
the author allowed a woman, disguised
as a man, to fool everybody, including
the reader, for four-fifths of the book.
It simply can't be done. Note the
lamentable failures in the movies.
G. K. Chesterton ranks "Mystery at.
Geneva" as one of the six best Eng
lish novels of the year. If you know
Chesterton and value his opinion, you
had better read the book. But, likely
as not, it is only one of his stupendous
jokes. —H. H. H.
