### 
"Plans for the celebration of University
Day—to be held on Saturday, June 2—
were officially discussed last evening at
a dinner in the Union, when a student
committee was called by Dan Evans, '21,
chairman of the program committee.
On account of the dinner, entertain
ment, and dance, which is to be held in
the Pavilion that evening for students
and alumni, June 2 will be a closed date.
Until three years ago University Day
was a part of senior week, but it wasj
then decided to advance the date of this
alumni reunion to a time when the Uni
versity is in session. Athletic programs,
music, tours of the campus, and the din
ner dance in the evening are part of the
entertainment which the present student
body will accord the old members of
Stanford. (
Those of the student committee in
charge of hospitality are Gene Trago,
'23, Northcutt Ely, '24, Phil Landis, '23,,
Alice Roth, '24, Kennet Stewart, *23,
Mary Jane Clark, '22, John Richer, '24,
Pearl Bundick, '23, A1 Masters, '23, and
Paul Davis, '20.
Although detailed arrangements are
not yet completed, several features of
the day will be a polo game between
Stanford military teams, a review of the
R. O. T. C. by President Wilbur, when
cadet commissions will be presented; an
alumni luncheon, and afternoon music
recital.
Both students and alumni will take part
in stunts which will mark the evening
festivities.
