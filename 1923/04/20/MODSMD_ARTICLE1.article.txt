# VARSITY NINE WILL TACKLE BRUINS ON BERKELEY DIAMOND
## Coach Wolter's Team Will Make Strong Bid For Final Game of Series; Lineup Changed. 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Coach Wolter's varsity ball club will start against California Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley with the intention of saving something from the wreck.
The series belongs to the Bears, but a victory in the final game would be a
great satisfaction to the entire University, and the team really deserves it.
It will be the same old problem of getting a pitcher who can tame the
ferocity of the California batsmen. In both games, the Cards have produced
enough runs to win the average baseball contest, but the twenty-seven hits
credited to the Bruins made things look different. The Berkeleyites have a
team that is anything but strong in the field, but it is a football saying that a
good offensive is the best defensive.
Lowenstein Not in Shape
Solomon and Teague will again have to do their best. California has
hammered both of them all over the lot, but they are the best Wolter has, and
against nearly any other team they would be plenty good enough. A1 Lowen-

stein was in uniform as early as«s
Wednesday afternoon, but a couple of!
weeks' illness is a pretty serious thing
for a pitcher and Wolter does not ex- ]
pect to put him under the strain.
Milton Teague has had the easier
time with the slugging cohorts of the
enemy, and it is probable that he will
start tomorrow's game. No mere hook
on a pitched ball seems to bother the
Bears very much, and Teague is the
headiest chucker of the bunch. Solo-j
mon and "Fat" Clark will be ready in
case of emergency.
Lineup Changed
Coach Wolter intends several
changes in his lineup, which will prob
ably strengthen the hitting of the
team. Dick Lawson, who tied the score j
pinch-hitting for Woodward, will go in
at center field in place of Roy Carver, j
Lawson will have a little more chance <
at the bat, but it is questionable
whether he will be as consistent at
"circus" catches as Carver is. Carver
must have robbed visiting teams of at i
least a dozen hits during the season.
"Lefty" May will replace McCand
less in the right pasture. May is very
much there with the stick and a capa
