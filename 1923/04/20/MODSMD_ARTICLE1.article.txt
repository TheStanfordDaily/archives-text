# VARSITY NINE WILL TACKLE BRUINS ON BERKELEY DIAMOND
## Coach Wolter's Team Will Make Strong Bid For Final Game of Series; Lineup Changed. 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Coach Wolter's varsity ball club will start against California Saturday
afternoon at Berkeley with the intention of saving something from the wreck.
The series belongs to the Bears, but a victory in the final game would be a
great satisfaction to the entire University, and the team really deserves it.
It will be the same old problem of getting a pitcher who can tame the
ferocity of the California batsmen. In both games, the Cards have produced
enough runs to win the average baseball contest, but the twenty-seven hits
credited to the Bruins made things look different. The Berkeleyites have a
team that is anything but strong in the field, but it is a football saying that a
good offensive is the best defensive.
Lowenstein Not in Shape
Solomon and Teague will again have to do their best. California has
hammered both of them all over the lot, but they are the best Wolter has, and
against nearly any other team they would be plenty good enough. A1 Lowen-

stein was in uniform as early asÂ«s
Wednesday afternoon, but a couple of!
weeks' illness is a pretty serious thing
for a pitcher and Wolter does not ex- ]
pect to put him under the strain.
Milton Teague has had the easier
time with the slugging cohorts of the
enemy, and it is probable that he will
start tomorrow's game. No mere hook
on a pitched ball seems to bother the
Bears very much, and Teague is the
headiest chucker of the bunch. Solo-j
mon and "Fat" Clark will be ready in
case of emergency.
Lineup Changed
Coach Wolter intends several
changes in his lineup, which will prob
ably strengthen the hitting of the
team. Dick Lawson, who tied the score j
pinch-hitting for Woodward, will go in
at center field in place of Roy Carver, j
Lawson will have a little more chance <
at the bat, but it is questionable
whether he will be as consistent at
"circus" catches as Carver is. Carver
must have robbed visiting teams of at i
least a dozen hits during the season.
"Lefty" May will replace McCand
less in the right pasture. May is very
much there with the stick and a capa
ble fielder as well. Deffebach showed
up well in the last game, and will
appear in left field again tomorrow.
The combination around second base
will be changed back to the one used
in moet of the early-season games.
"Shorty" Roberts will be moved to his
old position at second base, and Eddie
Mulchay, his running mate on the 1925
freshman team, will go in at short.
This will give a faster pivot group and
perhaps improve chances at the bat.
Mulchay squares an occasional bobble
with pick-ups that border on the im
possible.
' The rest of the team will be conven
tional. Patterson is an absolute neces
sity behind the plat, and "Bud" Wood
ward is the goods at first. "Lefty"
Heckendorf got five walks last week
and saved the game Ut least twice by
neat grabs of grounders and wild
throws.
Hitters Must Come Through
It is up to the Cards to get their
batting clothes on. In the field they are
head and shoulders above the Bruins,
but a slugging meet with all the slug
ging on one side, leaves the answer

I plainly written. So far California has
I out-hit Stanford by twenty-seven to
| twelve, and if the two teams get about
' the same number of blows tomorrow
Stanford should win. The game will
start at 3:30.
