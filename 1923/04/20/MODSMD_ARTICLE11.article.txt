# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND ARCHERY TEAMS TO MEET U.C. AND MILLS TOMORROW
## 
### Pearl Bundick, '23 
While the wise ones are busy tomor
row morning grinding out last-minute
dope on the Big Meet, Stanford and
California women will be staging a meet
of their own in the Berkeley pool. At
the same time, from 10 to 12, the Stan
ford-Mills archery tournament will be
held on the California field.
Twenty-four women were chosen yes
terday for the two swimming teams, one
representing the two lower classes and
the other the upper classes. Coach Greta
Brandsten is not making any predictions
in regard to the meet, since little is
known of the strength of California's
contestants. That it will be a close meet
is certain, but the times made by the
Stanford entries during the past week
arc encouraging.
Although there arc no "stars" on
either team, the underclassmen arc count
ing on Ruth Yredenburgh, Mabel Mc-
Kibbin, Lois Wilbur, and Hermine

Wocker to roll up a comfortable margin
against their Blue and Gold opponents.
Muriel Stewart and Sidney Hawkins, in
diving, and Virginia Burks and Grace
Strobel, in the swimming events, arc
the outstanding upperclassmen. Carol
Botsford and Dorothy Brcnholts, in the
plunge for distance, will strengthen the
senior team to the tune of several points.
Barring last-minute changes, Coach
Greta Brandsten will enter the women in
the event# as follows (I and II indicate
the lower and upper class teams, re
spectively) :
25-yard free-style—(l) Yredenburgh.

Tn the archery tournament, the senior
class will enter only three contestants—
Virginia Burks, Mary Learnard, and
Carolyn Willis. The juniors will be rep
resented by Anne Merrill, Kathleen Ev
ans, Angie Parkhurst, and Yvonne Pas
quale. Olive Beckman. Elizabeth Meyers,
and Mary Virginia Dungan will make
up the sophomore team, jvhile the fresh
men will probably enter Pauline Hoff
man. Millison Hardy, Elizabeth Clapp,
and Charlotte Brown.
Stanford won so decisively from Mills
in the archery meet last year, taking
nine out of ..twelve places, that another
victory is likely tomorrow. The
strength of the sophomore and junior
teams will counterbalance the weak
freshman team.
Both the swimming and archery teams
will leave for San Francisco on the 7:11
train tomorrow morning.
