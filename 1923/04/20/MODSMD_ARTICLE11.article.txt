# WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND ARCHERY TEAMS TO MEET U.C. AND MILLS TOMORROW
## 
### Pearl Bundick, '23 
While the wise ones are busy tomor
row morning grinding out last-minute
dope on the Big Meet, Stanford and
California women will be staging a meet
of their own in the Berkeley pool. At
the same time, from 10 to 12, the Stan
ford-Mills archery tournament will be
held on the California field.
Twenty-four women were chosen yes
terday for the two swimming teams, one
representing the two lower classes and
the other the upper classes. Coach Greta
Brandsten is not making any predictions
in regard to the meet, since little is
known of the strength of California's
contestants. That it will be a close meet
is certain, but the times made by the
Stanford entries during the past week
arc encouraging.
Although there arc no "stars" on
either team, the underclassmen arc count
ing on Ruth Yredenburgh, Mabel Mc-
Kibbin, Lois Wilbur, and Hermine

Wocker to roll up a comfortable margin
against their Blue and Gold opponents.
Muriel Stewart and Sidney Hawkins, in
diving, and Virginia Burks and Grace
Strobel, in the swimming events, arc
the outstanding upperclassmen. Carol
Botsford and Dorothy Brcnholts, in the
plunge for distance, will strengthen the
senior team to the tune of several points.
Barring last-minute changes, Coach
Greta Brandsten will enter the women in
