# AMERICA'S BEST
## 
### 
Coach Templeton has done the impossible. He
began the season with what remained qf. last year's
65 1 /2-point dual team. The prospect seemed excel
lent, until Lady 111-luck took a hand and ousted
three ten-point men, enough to drive a less deter
mined coach off the track. As if this were not suffi
cient, the aforementioned lady remained in the
offing, until one by one a whole ilock of promising
second and third place men succumbed to her charms,
diminishing the total scoring ability of the combina
tion by some forty points. The average American
athletic leader would long before this have been in
the mad house, but not Templeton. This gentleman
presents for your approval tomorrow, not a weak
team, not a makeshift team, but a team stronger
than that which represented Stanford in the Big
Meet last season.
Our competitors at the Berkeley oval tomorrow
make up the most typical Stanford team of the pres
ent generation ; Because it is a built-up organization,
not from prep-school wonders, and not from (or
around) famous athletes, but from the ordinary ma
terial of the Stanford student body. The history of
the team reads like the stories of the good old days
themselves. Templeton has made and developed his
own stars. More than one athlete who has never
before scored a point against California will take a
first place tomorrow.
V ,Will Stanford be able to win? With one excep
tion, the dopesters predict a California victory,
which in general is not a bad sign. Those who men
tion point possibilities find a difference of only one
or two digits between the two teams, which shows
that the meet is anybody's. If the breaks in the
sprints are even, the Cardinal should get about fifty
five points in the track events. One chance to win
lies in getting a majority of the sprint counts. The
prospect here "is reasonable. Another chance lies in
the ability of our field men to gather more than ten
points. The prospect here is even more reasonable.
A "come through" percentage comparable to that of
last April will do wonders with the point totals.
The writer has witnessed California-Stanford bat
tles for six years, and never has he awaited a meet
with the keen anticipation that is held for Saturday.
Never has a Stanford team come up stronger, nor
against such heavy odds.. Never lias a group of
Red athletes shown a greater spirit, nor a stronger
determination to come through, nor has any team
more deserved the confidence of Stanford students.
California's coach, Walter Christie, is said to be one
of the finest. He is one of the oldest. But Temple
ton was a match for him last April, and there is none
in the world with whom we would prefer to rest the
Cardinal chances for tomorrow than with this former
athlete of Stanford's old days, America's youngest
coach, and, on the showing he has already made, we
firmly believe, America's best.
