# WITH THE WOMEN SATURDAY
## 
### 
Urging students to support their athletic teams is
rather like leading the proverbial horse to water: if
they want to go to games and meets there's no stop
ping them, and if they happen to be more interested
in something else, moral suasion is powerless to move
them an inch.
There is no doubt that the track team will be loy
ally supported tomorrow â€”but the women's teams
competing with California and Mills in the morn
ing also need bleacher support. Every woman at
tending the Rig Meet will make it a point to go to
Berkeley early enough for the women's contests.
These intercollegiate competitions come only once
cacli year and Stanford women devote months of
training to make winning teams for the Cardinal.
The least that the women students at large can do
is to turn ont 100 per cent for the meets tomorrow
morning.
P. B.
Tomorrow will Ik? a University holiday be
cause of the track meet at Berkeley.
