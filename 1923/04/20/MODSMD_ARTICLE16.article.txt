TRACK NUMBER

Hurray! Hurray! Tomorrow is the track meet. We
are so excited, we children. Mamma is taking us to
the Berkeley campus to observe the contest. We have
read all the dope stories appearing in the Frisco papers,

and so of course know
nothing at all about the
meet. We children are the
only ones at the meets
who really enjoy them.
The athletes are \afraid
they won't win; half the
bleachers are afraid that

they will have to pay for the meals of the other half
for the next month; the men are wondering whether
she will order lobster or merely a cup of tea after the
meet, and the women are wondering whether they can
get away with ordering a lobster or will coufine them
selves to merely chicken .after the meet. And so, alto
gether, the track meet is a glorious time for the chil
dren.

"No one can say, anyway, that California is not a
good sport," said Causter Whiskie, today, in an inter
view with Ijrick Morse, well-known partisan of the
Cardinals, who reluctantly consented to write a few

words on the Stanford
chances of winning the
meet. "We have —I mean
they—have given them —I
mean us —all the chances
in the world to win. Nev
ertheless, I must confess
that I think that Stanford

will not win. Although, on sober second thought, I don't
know why what I think will count."

"Brick Muller is one of the best athletes on the Cali
fornia campus," said a mysterious stranger otye Cab
bage .editor, yester-

day, as he walked
slowly through
Sather gate. "For
three years he has
fought for the
glory of his alma
mater. . .
* * *
One hour later
we shook ourself
free from the mys
terious stranger,
who had sung the
praises of the won
der athlete all this
time. As he strode

confidently away,
we asked a passing freshman who he was.
"Brick Muller," answered the freshman.

"If anyone knows why these two should be married,
let him speak now or forever hold his peace."
"Well," piped up little Johnny, the bride's younger
brother, "Sis's other fellow ain't here. I know he could
tell us something."
* * *
Alyce—l adore Keats!
Ikey—Oy, it's a relief to meet a lady vot still likes
children!
* * *
"Before we were married George used to kiss me
when we went through tunnels."
"And now?"
"Now, he takes a drink." —Washington and Lee Mink.

SPANISH
Pass me now for I am dreaming;
I can't read that damned stuff.
It's just words without a meaning;
Give me five, that's enough. —F.ice Owl.

First —Hey, how'd you get your hand bruised?
Second —Oh, I wuz comin' home from our banquet last
night and some clumsy yap stepped on my fingers.—

\ His First Game
Dear Choo: I see my first game of ball last Saturday
when Beeg School take Leetle School by britches and
spank um hard. Velly sad for Leetle School to be
walloped. Game velly interesting. Beeg School men
wear suits of convicts. Leetle School men wear black
suits for mourning. Beeg crowd that laugh leetle and
weep much. Men on ground chase round chalk line.
Cause much disturbance. Velly unladylike. Hit each
other with hard ball. Velly disgraceful. Men fall and
skid on stomachs. Eat much rust what is velly un
clean. Velly sad. —SING.

\ His First Game
Dear Choo: I see my first game of ball last Saturday
when Beeg School take Leetle School by britches and
spank um hard. Velly sad for Leetle School to be
walloped. Game velly interesting. Beeg School men
wear suits of convicts. Leetle School men wear black
suits for mourning. Beeg crowd that laugh leetle and
weep much. Men on ground chase round chalk line.
Cause much disturbance. Velly unladylike. Hit each
other with hard ball. Velly disgraceful. Men fall and
skid on stomachs. Eat much rust what is velly un
clean. Velly sad. —SING.



TRACK NUMBER

Hurray! Hurray! Tomorrow is the track meet. We
are so excited, we children. Mamma is taking us to
the Berkeley campus to observe the contest. We have
read all the dope stories appearing in the Frisco papers,

and so of course know
nothing at all about the
meet. We children are the
only ones at the meets
who really enjoy them.
The athletes are \afraid
they won't win; half the
bleachers are afraid that

they will have to pay for the meals of the other half
for the next month; the men are wondering whether
she will order lobster or merely a cup of tea after the
meet, and the women are wondering whether they can
get away with ordering a lobster or will coufine them
selves to merely chicken .after the meet. And so, alto
gether, the track meet is a glorious time for the chil
dren.

"No one can say, anyway, that California is not a
good sport," said Causter Whiskie, today, in an inter

Cardinals, who reluctantly consented to write a few

words on the Stanford
chances of winning the
meet. "We have —I mean
they—have given them —I
mean us —all the chances
in the world to win. Nev
ertheless, I must confess
that I think that Stanford

will not win. Although, on sober second thought, I don't
know why what I think will count."
