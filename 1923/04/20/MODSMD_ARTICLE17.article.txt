# COMPARATIVE SCORES SHOW TEAMS EQUAL FOR TRACK CLASSIC
## 
### 
STANFORD — The Stanford varsity
track team started the season off well
by defeating the Olympic Club stars J)y
a 74-57 count on March 17. In this meet
Stanford showed the spectators that she
was to be represented by a team of thirty
or more fighters, rather than a half
dozen stars. The Cardinal men, how
ever, showed their_\veakness in the field
events.
V
On March 24, immediately \following
final examinations, and with the team in
a weakened condition, the Stanford track
sters journeyed south, and took on the
University of Southern California hope
fuls at Los Angeles. Stanford copped
75 points in this meet, while Paddock,
Martz, and the two Andersons succeeded
in amassing only 56 points for the south
ern university.
Ten days later, on April 3, Stanford
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia again met, but this time on the
Stanford oval. Again the Cardinals
demonstrated their superiority over the
Los Angeles team, by a 72-57 score. Al
though the margin of victory was not
as large as previously, it was made in
the absence of Bill Black, who had in
jured his ankle.
In the last of the preliminary meets,
the All-Southern Conference track team
invaded the campus. The day, I riday,
tne 13th, was indeed a gloomy one for
Coach Templeton, since the southern men
annexed the meet by a 74-66 count. But
the meet was not without its bright lights
for the Stanford fans, since Jhe hundred
was won by Campbell of Stanford in 10
seconds flat.
CALIFORNIA—The Blue and Gold
team demonstrated its caliber in the first
meet of the year, when it took the strong
University of Southern California team
down the line on their own field by an
overwhelming score. California showed
that although she was not to be a weak
ling on the tracks, her real strength
would lie in the field events.
On the following Saturday, March 17,
the fast Olympic Club team was defeated,
85 3-4-54 1-4, on the Berkeley oval. Again
the real contest lay in the field events,
where the Olympic Club also had strong
entrants. First places in the high jump,
pole vault, and broad jump, aided ma
terially in the California victory.
Meeting the University of Southern
California for the second time at Berke
ley, California again decisively defeated
the southerners by a top-heavy 81-50
score. The big surprise of the day was
the showing of the California weight
men.
As a last preliminary to the Big Meet,
California took on Nebraska, champions
of the Big Ten Conference, and easily
defeated them. Although Nebraska
turned out to be surprisingly strong, and
rolled up a big lead in the track events,
they were not match for the wearers of
the Blue and Gold when it came to the
field events. A disappointment to the
fans was when the Nebraska relay team,
like the others met during the season,
easily defeated the California quartet.

tne 13th, was indeed a gloomy one for
Coach Templeton, since the southern men
annexed the meet by a 74-66 count. But
the meet was not without its bright lights
for the Stanford fans, since Jhe hundred
was won by Campbell of Stanford in 10
seconds flat.
CALIFORNIA—The Blue and Gold
team demonstrated its caliber in the first
meet of the year, when it took the strong
University of Southern California team
down the line on their own field by an
overwhelming score. California showed
that although she was not to be a weak
ling on the tracks, her real strength
would lie in the field events.
On the following Saturday, March 17,
the fast Olympic Club team was defeated,
85 3-4-54 1-4, on the Berkeley oval. Again
the real contest lay in the field events,
where the Olympic Club also had strong
entrants. First places in the high jump,
pole vault, and broad jump, aided ma
terially in the California victory.
Meeting the University of Southern
California for the second time at Berke
ley, California again decisively defeated
the southerners by a top-heavy 81-50
score. The big surprise of the day was
the showing of the California weight
men.
As a last preliminary to the Big Meet,
California took on Nebraska, champions
of the Big Ten Conference, and easily
defeated them. Although Nebraska
turned out to be surprisingly strong, and
rolled up a big lead in the track events,
they were not match for the wearers of
the Blue and Gold when it came to the
field events. A disappointment to the
fans was when the Nebraska relay team,
like the others met during the season,
easily defeated the California quartet.
STANFORD — The Stanford varsity
track team started the season off well
by defeating the Olympic Club stars J)y
a 74-57 count on March 17. In this meet
Stanford showed the spectators that she
was to be represented by a team of thirty
or more fighters, rather than a half
dozen stars. The Cardinal men, how
ever, showed their_\veakness in the field
events.

On March 24, immediately \following
final examinations, and with the team in
a weakened condition, the Stanford track
sters journeyed south, and took on the
University of Southern California hope
fuls at Los Angeles. Stanford copped
75 points in this meet, while Paddock,
Martz, and the two Andersons succeeded
in amassing only 56 points for the south
ern university.
Ten days later, on April 3, Stanford
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia again met, but this time on the
Stanford oval. Again the Cardinals
demonstrated their superiority over the
Los Angeles team, by a 72-57 score. Al
though the margin of victory was not
as large as previously, it was made in
the absence of Bill Black, who had in
jured his ankle.
In the last of the preliminary meets,
the All-Southern Conference track team
invaded the campus. The day, I riday,
tne 13th, was indeed a gloomy one for
Coach Templeton, since the southern men
