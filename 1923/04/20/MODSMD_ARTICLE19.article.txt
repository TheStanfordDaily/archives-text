# WOMEN'S TRACK MEET SHOULD PROVE BIG SENSATION OF ATHLETIC WORLD
##

High jump, broad jump, quarter mile—
Watch the girls step out in style;
Relay, hurdles, five-pound shot —
Women's track team? Sure, have got I
After accumulating the vote, the
cigaret habit, and Leap Year privi
leges, the more ladylike proportion of
this mortal coil has cast an appraising
eye over the few remaining male
prerogatives and decided that cinders
have other functions beside getting in
the eye. In short, the Stanford Five
Hundred are going to throw a track
meet.
It is impossible for a mere man to

penetrate the veil of secrecy cast over
this impending celebration by its
jealous guardians. The public is
warned that the statements in this
prognostication are apt to be wide of
the mark. Doubters are invited to
check up by attending the meet, which
will be held in the latter part of May
and will be open to all. Competition
will be interclass, though the women
hope to tangle with the She-Bears next
season. They have some tractors com
ing up.
Winsome sprinters have already

hung up the mark of 7 seconds flat for
the 50-yard dash. The time was taken
with a cuckoo clock, however, and
may have been as low as 0:6 3-5. The
principals refuse to disclose the times
registered in the century or the fur
long, but it is thought that there are
some pretty fast women entered.
The 440 will be the longest race of
the day. Members of the team are so
busy with social and academic pur
suits that they can't spare the time
for the distances. Anyhow, the fastest
ones are in the sprints and they are
the only ones who like to go very far.
Both the high and low hurdles are

to be run. Inclined ramps will be con
structed to aid the weak sisters over
the last gate, and any hurdler who
kicks one over must leap the rest of
them twice. Loss of a hair-pin counts
a penalty of one second.
The women have a new departure
in the high jump. Instead of crossing
the bar with a sidewise scissors kick
like the men, they will hop from both
feet at once like a man jumping on
his friend's straw hat. It is said to
require great rexterity to come down
on the other side of the cross-bar, and

the average jump is twenty-two inches.
The broad jump will be run off, but
there is a dearth of details.
The shot put is the only weight
event adopted by the women. Begin
ning with an electric light bulb, the
weightresses have already progressed
to an orange and by the time of the
meet they will be tossing a five-pound
bronze doorknob. They employ the
method used in heaving a hand
grenade.
There will be no javelin throw. The
women aver that they don't care to
use the harpoon so publicly. There
will be no men within reach anyhow.

Four collegiennes will run the mile
relay in the usual four laps.
Coach "Dink" Templeton will be let
into the venture long enough to build
a track, and then slung out on his ear.
The events will be run off in the com
mon or blooming variety of feminine
gym suit.
The rooting-sections will be furnish
ed with tea-bells to tinkle by way of
applause, and the bleacher stunt will
consist of a red raspberry in a clump
of green peas. Cream puffs will be on
sale at the gate.
