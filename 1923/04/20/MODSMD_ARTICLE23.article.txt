# FOURTEEN OF PAST TWENTY-NINE MEETS WON BY CALIFORNIA
## 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Thirty years ago Stanford and Cali
fornia first met in a track and field
meet and on that occasion the Bears
walked off with a 91-to-35 victory.
Since then the Cards and Bruins have
met twenty-eight times with each team
winning its share of the meets. Cali
fornia has won fourteen and Stanford
has taken thirteen. The meets in 1896
and 1922 resulted in ties. Stanford
needs the classic tomorrow to even
things up with the Blue and Gold sup
porters.
A gradual evolution of events has
taken place since the first meet. One
is surprised on looking at the sum
mary of the 1893 meet. Included in the
results are such events as a one-mile
walk and a two-mile bicycle race. The
16-pound hammer throw was also in
cluded in the first meet. Events then
unthought-of were the relay, discus
throw, javelin throw, and two-mile
run.
The times, heights, and distances of
the first man would scarcely place a
man in the clash tomorrow. The pole
vault went at 10 feet, the high jump at
5 feet 8 inches, and the shot at 36
feet 10 inches. The times in most of
the races were also slow, some of them
being: 100-yard dash, 10 3-5; 220-yard
dash, :24 1-5; one-mile run, 4:51 2-5;
220 yard hurdles, :28 2-5; 120-yard hur
dles :17 4-5 seconds.
In the meet the next year California
had an easy time winning, 90 to 36.
Little unusual happened in this meet,
although the best race of the day was
between Hoffman and Dyer of Cali
fornia who tied for first in the 120-
yard hurdles in :16 4-5. The pole vault
fn this meet went at 9 feet 4 1-2 inches.
The third meet was equally one-sided
with the victory Tor California.
The meet in 1896 was one of the
most thrilling in the history of the
two schools. This resulted in a tie,
each team scoring 56 points. Through
out the meet the score remained about
even, the teams scoring about equally
In all events. The following year, Cali
fornia won the meet by a score of
62% to 49%. Then followed a period
©*• California supremacy during which
the Cardinals did not win a meet, nor
did they even come near to winning.
By 1900, tracks were beginning to
be kept in good condition. With better
coaching the men were able to make
faster .times. However, in this year
California scored first and second in
the high jump, 5 feet 3% inches taking
first honors. However, Cadogan of
California made :10 flat in the 100-
yard dash the next year. The follow
ing year five records went by the
boards and the 100-yard dash was
again covered in :10 flat.
The meet in 1903 was an upset of
dope and the Cardinals emerged vic
torious for the first time, winning
to 58%. Stanford took all points in
the 440-yard dash and won the relay,
giving the Cards a 4% lead. Cali
fornia was ahead before the relay, but
the Blue and Gold runners couldn't
keep up with the Redshirts who cov
ered the course in the then fast time
of 3:23.
The Cards had an easier time win
ning the meet the next year, the score
being 69 to 53. Stanford took most
points in the field events and distance
races, while California won the
sprints. The next year was a complete
reversal with California winning on
a mud-soaked field. Stanford took but
6% points in the five field events this
year, but won the two-mile race for

the first time in a number of years.
The Stanford men also took all places
in the low hurdles.
The next year was one of the most
disappointing in Stanford-California
track history. Stanford had the best
team that had ever represented the
school and everyone conceded the vic
tory to Stanford by a good margin.
The day before the meet the earth
quake of 1906 ruined the track and
deprived Stanford of a victory. How
ever, the team 'that never ran,' as it
was then called, worked hard for the
meet the following year and won by a
score of 65 to 61. In 1906 the first
freshman track meet was held, with
the victory going to the Bears by the
score of 73% to 48%.
In 1908 the victory was again on
the California side. Throughout the
season Stanford had been cleaning up
in the preliminaries and everyone
looked to repetition of the year be
fore. However, a week before the meet
Stanford lost three stars, which crip
pled the team so badly that California
was able to win. This meet was nota
ble for the number of records smashed.
The marks in the 440, 880, mile, and
low hurdles were lowered.
Stanford took the meets in 1909 and
1910 to even up for the defeat in
1908. Both of these meets were closely
contested and the victor was in doubt
until the last events were completed.
L. S. Scott, the Stanford captain, broke
the world's record in the pole vault,
clearing the bar at 12 feet 10 3-16
inches.
California won the meets in 1911
and 1912. Little of interest happened
in either of these meets, although ex
cellent times were made in all of the
track events. The 1913 meet was one
of the closest and best in the history
of the two schools. Stanford won a
victory by 2-5 of a point, the result not
being settled until McKee of Stanford

had won the 220-yard dash in a close
race. Five Stanford-California records
were broken and one world's intercol
legiate record established in this
meet.
The 1913 meet was the start of a
series of victories for Stanford. The
Stanford squad won every meet until
1920, most of them being fairly de
cisive scores. The 1914 meet was one
of the fastest meets between the two
schools, five more records bing smash
ed by Stanford men. Feg Murray of
Stanford was high point man with
12 1-4 points. Murray ran the low
hurdles in 24 4-5 seconds, setting a
new record. The 1915 was exception
ally close. The score stood 57 to 56
for California after the relay had been
run, and with the broa djump hanging
in the balance. Stanford came through
in this event, taking six points, and
winning the meet 62 to 60.
California won in 1920 by a score of,
70> to 61. Stanford's team boasted an !
array of stars that seemed hard to'
beat, but Walter Christie's team i
proved too strong. Kirksey, Wells, and
Templeton were Stanford's best men
but they could not garner enough
points alone for Stanford to win. Kirk
sey established the record of 21 2-5
seconds in the 220 in this meet.
California had an easy time in 1921,
winning by the score of 85 % to
The following year the Stanford men
were not given a chance by the dope
sters but they came through with a
65% to 65% score. This meet is still
fresh in the minds of the Cardinal
supporters and needs little description.
