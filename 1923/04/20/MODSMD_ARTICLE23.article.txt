# FOURTEEN OF PAST TWENTY-NINE MEETS WON BY CALIFORNIA
## 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Thirty years ago Stanford and Cali
fornia first met in a track and field
meet and on that occasion the Bears
walked off with a 91-to-35 victory.
Since then the Cards and Bruins have
met twenty-eight times with each team
winning its share of the meets. Cali
fornia has won fourteen and Stanford
has taken thirteen. The meets in 1896
and 1922 resulted in ties. Stanford
needs the classic tomorrow to even
things up with the Blue and Gold sup
porters.
A gradual evolution of events has
taken place since the first meet. One
is surprised on looking at the sum

results are such events as a one-mile
walk and a two-mile bicycle race. The
16-pound hammer throw was also in
cluded in the first meet. Events then
unthought-of were the relay, discus
throw, javelin throw, and two-mile
run.
The times, heights, and distances of
the first man would scarcely place a
man in the clash tomorrow. The pole
vault went at 10 feet, the high jump at
5 feet 8 inches, and the shot at 36
feet 10 inches. The times in most of
the races were also slow, some of them
being: 100-yard dash, 10 3-5; 220-yard
dash, :24 1-5; one-mile run, 4:51 2-5;
220 yard hurdles, :28 2-5; 120-yard hur
dles :17 4-5 seconds.
In the meet the next year California
had an easy time winning, 90 to 36.
Little unusual happened in this meet,
although the best race of the day was
between Hoffman and Dyer of Cali
fornia who tied for first in the 120-
