# DAVIS GIVES CARD TRACK TEAM THREE POINT ADVANTAGE
## 
### GEORGE T. DAVIS 
(Amateur Sports Editor, S. F. Bulletin)
For the first time in the present
college generation Stanford and Cali-
I fornia will meet upon the athletic
: field on Saturday afternoon with the
advantage slightly in favor of the
| Cardinals. The wonderful spirit that
has been manifested by the Stanford
! track team this season and the loyalty
! of the men to Coach "Dink" Templeton
; has forced a majority of the critics to
strike a balance on that side of the
j ledger when figuring the prospects for
i the meet.
Every man on the squad, however,
must perform on the track and in the
field up to the very limit of his capa
bilities in order to offset the natural
advantages that the Bruins will have
in the weight events.
Where California is counted upon
for points, they are mighty somewhat
in doubt. The possibility of a Stan
ford serpentine on the Berkeley oval,
though, is enough of an inspiration
for the "redshirts."
Stanford track teams have always '
"come through" when the odds have
been against them and now that there
is a little "velvet" to work on one
cannot blame the Cardinal supporters
for feeling confident.
The result of the meet, though, will
depend almost entirely upon which
athletes Mother Nature smiles, as
there are several men on the hospital
list at each institution who are count
ed on for points.
An even distribution of the "breaks"
should find Stanford on the long end
of the score, when the final tally is
made. Predicting a score is very haz
ardous work, but the Cardinal margin
should be in the neighborhood of three
points.
