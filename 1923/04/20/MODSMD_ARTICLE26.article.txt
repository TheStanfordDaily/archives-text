# Must Develop Inexperienced Football Men, Claims Warner
## 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
The football problem here at Stan
ford is to develop men who haven't
had previous experience, Glenn War
ner believes. "Because of the keen
competition between colleges on the
Coast for likely material from high
schools and prep schools, and high
scholarship standards here, this seems
to be Stanford's only recourse if she
is to be represented by first class
teams."
"Pop" was repairing one of his golf
clubs at the time we put our question
to him. And it is said that he swings
a mean brassie. He, and Kerr, and
"Dink" Templeton go out on the polo
field quite frequently and knock the
pellet around. "Tiny" Thornhill is too
young to play golf, and, according to
"Pop," "hasn't got the bug yet."
Warner laid down his club when
we started talking football to him,
and declared that everyone in the Bast
watches the annual Stanford-Califor
nia Big Game. "Stanford and Califor
nia are considered the two big uni
versities on the Coast." Then he told
iw a few things about the grid sport
back at Pitt, and why spring practice
there is not nearly so essential as it is
here at Stanford.
When the foundations of the new
eystem have become firmly estab
lished —and that will be within the
next few years—''Pop" sees no reason
why practice in the fall should not be
sufficient. "But just at present, it is
vitally necessary; and every husky
Stanford man should get into a suit
and do his part. Experience isn't ne
cessary. There were three men on

the Pitt eleven which met Stanford
last December who hadn't played foot
ball until they came to Pitt."
Pitt doesn't have spring practice,
Warner said. It has been found that
training at that time of the year is
not necessary, for the men have be
come schooled in the Warner system.
"At Pitt, the day after Labor Day,
we take those varsity men still left
over from last year's squad, and to
gether with the more promising fresh
man gridders, which brings the roster
to about forty men, leave for a camp
about 150 miles from Pittsburgh. Here
the men play football and practices
are held twice daily. The camp lasts
for three weeks."
Because football knowledge and
technique have become so widely dis
tributed all over the United States,
there is no reason why good teams
should be confined to any one part of
the country, "Pop" believes.
"The elevens of Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton, which have always been
strong, have been materially aided by
a good morale and the power which
comes with tradition. But I do not
see why other colleges of the same
size should not be represented by
teams just as strong," he said. .
Warner io also keenly interested in
track and is eagerly awaiting the var
sity classic tomorrow. He was director
of all athletics at the Carlisle School
for many years, and always turned out
good track teams.
"Out here on the Coast, you have
an advantage over the East, for you
can train nearly the whole year
round," Warner said.

watches the annual Stanford-Califor
nia Big Game. "Stanford and Califor
nia are considered the two big uni
versities on the Coast." Then he told
iw a few things about the grid sport
back at Pitt, and why spring practice
there is not nearly so essential as it is
here at Stanford.
When the foundations of the new
eystem have become firmly estab
lished —and that will be within the
next few years—''Pop" sees no reason
why practice in the fall should not be
sufficient. "But just at present, it is
vitally necessary; and every husky
Stanford man should get into a suit
and do his part. Experience isn't ne
cessary. There were three men on

the Pitt eleven which met Stanford
last December who hadn't played foot
ball until they came to Pitt."
Pitt doesn't have spring practice,
Warner said. It has been found that
training at that time of the year is
not necessary, for the men have be
come schooled in the Warner system.
"At Pitt, the day after Labor Day,
we take those varsity men still left
over from last year's squad, and to
gether with the more promising fresh
man gridders, which brings the roster
to about forty men, leave for a camp
about 150 miles from Pittsburgh. Here
the men play football and practices
are held twice daily. The camp lasts
for three weeks."
Because football knowledge and
technique have become so widely dis
tributed all over the United States,
there is no reason why good teams
should be confined to any one part of
the country, "Pop" believes.
"The elevens of Harvard, Yale, and
Princeton, which have always been
strong, have been materially aided by
a good morale and the power which
comes with tradition. But I do not
see why other colleges of the same
size should not be represented by
teams just as strong," he said. .
Warner io also keenly interested in
track and is eagerly awaiting the var
sity classic tomorrow. He was director
of all athletics at the Carlisle School
for many years, and always turned out
good track teams.
"Out here on the Coast, you have
an advantage over the East, for you
can train nearly the whole year
round," Warner said.
The football problem here at Stan
ford is to develop men who haven't
had previous experience, Glenn War
ner believes. "Because of the keen
competition between colleges on the
Coast for likely material from high
schools and prep schools, and high
scholarship standards here, this seems
to be Stanford's only recourse if she
is to be represented by first class
teams."
"Pop" was repairing one of his golf
clubs at the time we put our question
to him. And it is said that he swings
a mean brassie. He, and Kerr, and
"Dink" Templeton go out on the polo
field quite frequently and knock the
pellet around. "Tiny" Thornhill is too
young to play golf, and, according to
"Pop," "hasn't got the bug yet."
Warner laid down his club when
we started talking football to him,
and declared that everyone in the Bast
watches the annual Stanford-Califor
nia Big Game. "Stanford and Califor
nia are considered the two big uni
versities on the Coast." Then he told
