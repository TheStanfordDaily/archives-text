Stanford swimmers are counted upon
to play a leading role in the Pacific Ath
letic Association swimming meet tonight
in the Olympic Club tank. Coach Ernie
Brandsten is confident that his proteges
will bring home more than one blue rib
bon in the six events on the program.
On the basis of previous showings, es
pecially that of last week against Cali
fornia, the Cards arc favored to win a
larger percentage of places in the meet
tonight than any other entrants. Stan
ford has what is undeniably the strong
est swimming team on the Pacific Coast
this year, so there is no difficulty in
finding fast men to compete tonight.
The only doubtful event, from a Stan
ford viewpoint, is the 100-yard handicap
swim. The 100-yard swim has been the
one weak point on the Card's record this

year, but with a generous handicap, there
is no reason why McCallistcr or Hirsch
man should not take first or second.
While these men have not been consist
ently fast all year, they may open the
eyes of the critics tonight.
Austin, the Stanford streak, should
have things all his way in the 100-yard
junior free-style. He swam the distance
in 0:59.4 last Friday against California,
and there is not another man in the
junior class that can touch this. If ex
tended, Austin may even better his previ
ous mark.
In the 150-yard open backstroke, De-
Groot and O'Connor arc entered. These
men arc both fast, having won in the
varsity and freshman meets against Cali
fornia, respectively. Of the two, De-
