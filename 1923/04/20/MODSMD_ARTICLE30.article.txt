### 
S. K. Ratcliffe, English editor and
former special correspondent for the
Manchester Guardian, will discuss
"The European Crisis" in an assem
bly next Tuesday morning at 11
o'clock.
Graham Wallas, British critic and
professor of political science at the
University of London, says of Rat
cliffe: "He has a singularly full knowl
edge of the political and social his
tory, and the literature and thought of
England and India during the last
hundred years. Above all his knowl
edge is not that of a journalist, but
of a thinker who has taken the life
of his time and his own part in it very
seriously. He has also during the last
dozen years been able to compare the
two English-speaking civilizations dur
ing his visits to America."
