# Templeton's Third Track Team To Meet California Tomorrow
## 
### 
Robert Lyman "Dink" Templeton,
'18, varsity and freshman track coach,
will take his proteges to Berkeley to
morrow for the sole purpose of win
ning a track meet from the Blue and
Gold rivals. It will be "Dink's" third
appearance at a Stanford-California
track meet as coach.
His first aggregation of track stars
traveled to Berkeley in 1921 and
tuuted defeat by the score of 85% to
45%. It was a hard meet to lose, the
first real one-sided defeat in eight
years. Until 1920, Stanford cinder path
artists had cleaned up on the track
for seven consecutive years. Last
year "Dink" took a supposedly weak
team to Berkeley and before the meet
was half over, the track men had
gathered enough points to earn the
Cards a tie. California came through
in the rest of the events, and the con
test ended in a 65% to 65% tie. This
year with a team conceded an even
chance if not the edge on the Bruin
team, "Dink" should bring home the
bacon. If he does he will have accom
plished 'a feat worthy of considerable
note. In three years he will have
turned a weak and rather mediocre
track team into a winner.
It is not the preliminary meets
which mean so much to "Dink" as far
as scores count, but it is the gradual
development of new material and the
conditioning of old material. He has
taken part in Big Meets enough times
to know what a victory means to the
undergraduates as well as to the track
men themselves. He does not save or
spare his men but works them up to
the climax of their training at the Big
Meet.
"Dink" entered Stanford in the fall
of 1914 after graduating from Palo
Alto High School the previous June.
His brother, "Ric," was here at the
time and performing capably in the
jumps. "Dink" did nothing of impor
tance in track until the spring of 1917
just prior to his departure for the
war. He was entered in the high jump
in the Big Meet of that spring which
Stanford won 67-55. He tied with Nich
ols of California for first place, but in
trying to break the tie he failed to
clear the bar at 6 feet and Nichols
got credit for the five points.
Before he left for the war in 1917,
"Dink" played on the rugby team,
starting his work in 1915 and ending
his college rugby the next fall. He
took part in the annual Big Games
played at that time with Santa Clara
on Ewing Field. On his return from
the war in the spring of 1919 he got
in condition for track and culminated
a successful season by placing third
for individual honors in the Big Meet.
The victory was the seventh consecu
tive one for Stanford and was taken
by a score of 73% to 66%. Jess Wills,
'20, took four first places and "Dink"
came through with a first place in the
broad jump and a second in the high
jump.
In the fall of 1919 "Dink" played
American football on Bob Evans* fam
ous varsity and punted 65 yards con
sistently all season.
Templeton was selected as a mem
ber of the California rugby team to

compete in the Olympic Games in 1920
and it was his 45-yard drop kick on a
soggy field which defeated the French
team and won the championship for
the Americans. In the spring of that
year he went to Boston to qualify in
the jumps for the Olympic Games. Af
ter making well over six feet in the
high jump he was disqualified be
cause, it was maintained by the judges,
he dived over the bar. He then went
out and qualified in the broad jump
and thus won his place on the Olympic
team.
In the 1920 track meet with Cali
fornia, "Dink" talked Merchant out of
first place in the broad jump, although
Merchant had been making twenty
three feet consistently and he had
only jumped a little over twenty-two,
Merchant made greater jumps but
fouled on the take-off and lost because
of it. He also took a first place in the
high jump.
In the fall of 1920, "Dink" was de
clared eligible to play football since
the five-year rule would not apply to
him until the following quarter, due
to his absence because of the war. It
was his "educated toe" which brought
Stanford through many hard games.
After a season of splendid perform
ance under Coach Walter Powell,
"Dink" became track coach and has
filled that capacity ever since. His
â€¢greatest work has been evident in his
development of new men, his ability
to get the best possible out of them,
and to make a good showing no mat
ter how bad the prospects. Among his
proteges are Glenn Hartranft, and Bill
Black, who have been spectacular in
their development under his coaching.
Lane Falk and Flint Hanner also came
into the limelight under his tutelage.
Charlie Daly and A1 Smith are two
more of his "finds." Who the dark
horses will be this year no one knows
but "Dink" has got lots of material
and has pointed toward the Big Meet
all year. Last year the "come-through"
men tied the meet; this year they may
win it.
