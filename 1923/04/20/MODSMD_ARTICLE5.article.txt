### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford men must wear their
rooters's hats to the Big Meet
tomorrow. The Graduate Mana
ger advises taking the 9:15 train
from the campus in order to
reach the Berkeley oval by 1:30
p. m.

Boy, page the furniture company
and put in a side call for the egg who
said Stanford spirit was dead.
From the first "to hell" to the final
echo of the 'Varsity," the rally held
last night in the Assembly hall was as
howling a success as the annual foot
ball rally.
"It has been sometime since Stan
ford has won a major sportf 'said Bill
Sisson, '16, the first speaker. "The time
has arrived when we ought to break
in once more. I believe Stanford should
win. California is figuring on eight and
nine points in most of the field events,
but they are due for a surprise." Sis
son thought Minsky to be one man
who would surpi'ise the Bears in the
broad jump. "We can count on points
in the field events," he continued.
'Each point in these will be like so
weak in this department. It means
that every Stanford man on the squad
will have to do better than his best
to win."
"Dink" Templeton, Stanford track
coach and second speaker of the eve
ning, followed the style set by Abra
ham Lincoln in his Gettysburg ad
dress. He pointed out in a few words
that Stanford had an inexperienced
team, but that the men were heart
and soul for victory.
Captain Lane Falk's speech was to
this effect: "Boys, we're all going up
there determined to win and make
sure that a man with a blue shirt does
not come in ahead of us."
