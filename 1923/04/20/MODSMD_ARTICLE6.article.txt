grappling hooks from the fire station.
Shortly after 6 o'clock Ernst Brand

ward a little after each attempt. After
about five minutes of this, Wally O'Con

body and brought it to the surface.
Dr. Barnett had been summoned, and
methods of resuscitation were tried for
some time. The stethescope showed no
heart action whatever, so the attempt was
given up and the body carried to the
boat-house. It was removed to Roller
