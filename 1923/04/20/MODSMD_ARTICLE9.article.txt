# CARDS, BEARS MEET IN BIG TRACK CLASSIC TOMORROW
## STANFORD TEAM GIVEN MARGIN IN TRACK EVENTS Bruins Will Be Strong In Field Entries; Coach Templeton's Squad Has Slight Advantage If Breaks Are Even. 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Stanford and California cinder path stars will do battle tomorrow afternoon on the Berke
ley oval in the thirtieth annual Big Meet. A victory for the Cardinal will even the count
as the Bruins have fourteen wins to their credit, and the Cards thirteen. Two meets were
tied. 1
Ten thousand spectators will witness the most curious battle in years. Both teams are
woefully unbalanced, dopesters conceding each full sway in certain events. "Dink" Tem
pleton's Stanford squad will rely largely on the track events, while Walter Christie's Bears
are heavy favorites in the field events.

If the breaks are even, the tide should turn in favor of
Stanford. It is going to be a severe test for Templeton's
inexperienced men against their season opponents but if
every one of them conies through, their strength in (he
track events should pull them through.
Dope Is Unreliable
Doping the meet is a risky business for there are always
"Big Meet Athletes" who are at their best when Stanford
and California meet.
Campbell and Hale should come through in the hundred
dash with eight points as the Bruin entries in the century
have failed to show anything startling this year. In spite
Campbell should lead him to the tape. The Card sprinter
of Shepherd's excellent showing in the 220, it looks as if
is a strong runner and is at his best in the furlong. It is*
almost too much to hope that Hale will beat the Bear flash
out for second place, but it is possible.
Saxby is a good runner, but with Judah and Williamson
in shape, he can scarcely be counted on for more than a.
third place. The race should be a pretty one between' the
two Cardinal stars. Goertz of California, Coverly and
Shermund are other possibilities.
Half Mile Is Uncertain
With the poor showing Daly made in the All Southern
Conference meet, the half mile is a tough one to figure dn.
If Elliott is not forced too hard in the mile, he should be
good for a first or second. Then, Daly came through last
lear when he was conceded only an outside chance and led
the field in fast time. He may do it again. Bauman has
been improving and will force the Cardinal runners to th»
limit. Two places in the 880 —first and third, possilJly,
should be a fair estimate for Stanford.
Elliott and Gurley, who have been running around 4:30 in
the mile and have been finishing together seem almost
certain to force Denton, Fiske, and Mulvaney to fight it out
for third place. On the basis of comparative times Hayes
should add another "5" under the Stanford score after
the two-mile. Mulvaney, Jensen, and Dorr, if he runs,
should not be far to the rear.
Hurdles Feature Races
The hurdles, billed as the feature events of the day, bid
fair to live up to advance information. Templeton will pin

Coach "Dink" Templeton: We have
come through a particularly hard pre
liminary season to the Big Meet Satur
day with a chance to win. We have an
inexperienced team, but from my work
with them I know they are the kind of
men that will come through, taking the
meet as a whole, in the field events as
well as the track events.
Captain Lane Falk: We are going
up to Berkeley Saturday determined to
win; and we arc all going to make sure
that there is not a man to come in ahead
of us.

his hopes on Falk and Leistner in both events, while Christie is putting forward
Becker in the highs and Van Sant in the lows. Falk should win against
Becker with Leistern fighting for second place. Van Sant will have to travel
the low barriers in record time to beat either of the Card entries. Leistner
is favored by some to win with Falk a close second. It should be a pretty
race.
It looks like Stanford will need from ten to fifteen points in the field events
