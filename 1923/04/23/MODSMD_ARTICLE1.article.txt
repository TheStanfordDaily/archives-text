# BEAR NINE TAKES THIRD GAME FROM STANFORD VARSITY
## Banning Hurls Superb Ball in 4 to 1 Victory; Batting Slump Defeats Peavy's Men 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Another senior at the University of
California won his "Big C" Saturday
afternoon. His name is Banning, and
he stepped out of the ranks of the
unknown by pitching the California
varsity nine to a 4-to-l victory over
the Cardinals.
Banning hurled a really splendid
game. He held the Stanford batters
hitless and scoreless until the seventh
inning, whn Captain Peavy rapped out
a scratch single to short. In the ninth
he eased up behind a safe lead, and
the Cards took three more hits and
their only run. Both nines were play
ing better ball than in the previous
two games, and it was by far the best
of the three contests. Captain "Lefty"
Hermle wound up his career at Cali
fornia with a Babe Ruth incident into
the short center field bleachers.
Bruins Score in First Inning
California opened up in the first in
ning. King went down to Woodward's
playground on four wide ones, and
Hermle shoved him to Peavy with a
bunt when Clark juggled the ball and
was forced to throw to first. Thomp
son sent a fly to Lawson, and King
started for third. Heckendorf allowed
Lawson's peg to slip by, and King
scored the first California run.
Bill made the first hit of the day
in the second inning, dropping one of
Clark's offerings in center field for a
single. In the third, Hermle robbed
Clark of a clean double by a spec
tacular snag of his high line drive
down the first base line.
Cards' Chance in Fourth
Stanford had a big chance in the
fourth. Deffebach walked and Erb
muffed the throw at second when King
attempted to force on Carver's ground
er. Heckendorf forced Charlie at third,
but Woodward stopped a pitch with
the back of his neck, filling the sacks.
With two out, Patterson rolled one
to Banning and was thrown out at
first.
California scored twice in the sixth.
Hermle caught one on the end of his
bat and crossed the plate while the
ball was bouncing around in the
bleachers. Thompson scorched a single
through the pitcher's box, and both
were safe when Douthit rolled to
Clark who threw too slowly on a good
chance for a double play. Bowen flied
out to Peavy, but Bill scored Thomp
son with a hit to right field. Douthit
was caught at third on the throw-in,
Deffebach to Heckendorf.
Stanford Fills Bases
Stanford filled the bases again in
the next inning, but again the punch
was lacking at the crucial moment.
"Bud" Woodward took a base on balls
and Patterson was out on a fly to left
field. Peavy cracked one down to short,
and Gerlach and King both fielded the
ball. In the confusion Peavy got a hit
and Woodward was safe at second.
Mulchay popped to King, and "Lefty"
May went in to hit for Clark. He also
walked, but Dick Lawson drove a fly
to Bill and chance was gone. Teague
then took the mound for the Cards.
The infield began to do funny things
to the ball in the eighth, and the
Bruins got their final tally. King got a
life when the pill whizzed by Mul
chay, and he immediately stole second.
Hermle grounded to Peavy, advancing
him to third. Eby bunted, and King
registered on a beautiful squeeze play
that caught the Cards napping. Dout
hit made first on a grounder that took
a weird bounce out of Woodward's
hands, but Bowen dropped a fly into
Heckendorf's mitt and ended the dan
ger.
Cards Tally in Last Frame
Stanford's only run came in the
ninth inning. Woodward got the first
clean hit of the game when he Texas
leagued over second, but was forced
on Patterson's grounder to King.
Parker, hitting for Peavy, grounded
to King, who made a pick-up that
smacked of burglary. Mulchay walked,
and McCandless, pinch-hitting for Mil
ton Teague, singled prettily through
second base. With the bases again
loaded, Lawson drove the ball to left
field and Patterson came in with the
Stanford counter.
Clark pitched a worthy game during
the seven innings, but bis team could
not back him up in the pinches.

Another senior at the University of
California won his "Big C" Saturday
afternoon. His name is Banning, and
he stepped out of the ranks of the
unknown by pitching the California
varsity nine to a 4-to-l victory over
the Cardinals.
Banning hurled a really splendid
game. He held the Stanford batters
hitless and scoreless until the seventh
inning, whn Captain Peavy rapped out
a scratch single to short. In the ninth
he eased up behind a safe lead, and
the Cards took three more hits and
their only run. Both nines were play
ing better ball than in the previous
two games, and it was by far the best
of the three contests. Captain "Lefty"
Hermle wound up his career at Cali
fornia with a Babe Ruth incident into
the short center field bleachers.
Bruins Score in First Inning
California opened up in the first in
ning. King went down to Woodward's
playground on four wide ones, and
Hermle shoved him to Peavy with a
bunt when Clark juggled the ball and
was forced to throw to first. Thomp
son sent a fly to Lawson, and King
started for third. Heckendorf allowed
Lawson's peg to slip by, and King
scored the first California run.
Bill made the first hit of the day
in the second inning, dropping one of
Clark's offerings in center field for a
single. In the third, Hermle robbed
Clark of a clean double by a spec
tacular snag of his high line drive
down the first base line.
Cards' Chance in Fourth
Stanford had a big chance in the
fourth. Deffebach walked and Erb
muffed the throw at second when King
attempted to force on Carver's ground
er. Heckendorf forced Charlie at third,
but Woodward stopped a pitch with
the back of his neck, filling the sacks.
With two out, Patterson rolled one
to Banning and was thrown out at
first.
California scored twice in the sixth.
Hermle caught one on the end of his
bat and crossed the plate while the
ball was bouncing around in the
bleachers. Thompson scorched a single
through the pitcher's box, and both
were safe when Douthit rolled to
Clark who threw too slowly on a good
chance for a double play. Bowen flied
out to Peavy, but Bill scored Thomp
son with a hit to right field. Douthit
was caught at third on the throw-in,
Deffebach to Heckendorf.
Stanford Fills Bases
Stanford filled the bases again in
the next inning, but again the punch
was lacking at the crucial moment.
"Bud" Woodward took a base on balls
and Patterson was out on a fly to left
field. Peavy cracked one down to short,
and Gerlach and King both fielded the
ball. In the confusion Peavy got a hit
and Woodward was safe at second.
Mulchay popped to King, and "Lefty"
May went in to hit for Clark. He also
walked, but Dick Lawson drove a fly
to Bill and chance was gone. Teague
then took the mound for the Cards.
The infield began to do funny things
to the ball in the eighth, and the
Bruins got their final tally. King got a
life when the pill whizzed by Mul
chay, and he immediately stole second.
Hermle grounded to Peavy, advancing
him to third. Eby bunted, and King
registered on a beautiful squeeze play
that caught the Cards napping. Dout
hit made first on a grounder that took
a weird bounce out of Woodward's
hands, but Bowen dropped a fly into
Heckendorf's mitt and ended the dan
ger.
Cards Tally in Last Frame
Stanford's only run came in the
ninth inning. Woodward got the first
clean hit of the game when he Texas
leagued over second, but was forced
on Patterson's grounder to King.
Parker, hitting for Peavy, grounded
to King, who made a pick-up that
smacked of burglary. Mulchay walked,
and McCandless, pinch-hitting for Mil
ton Teague, singled prettily through
second base. With the bases again
loaded, Lawson drove the ball to left
field and Patterson came in with the
Stanford counter.
Clark pitched a worthy game during
the seven innings, but bis team could
not back him up in the pinches.

Another senior at the University of
California won his "Big C" Saturday
afternoon. His name is Banning, and
he stepped out of the ranks of the
unknown by pitching the California
varsity nine to a 4-to-l victory over
the Cardinals.
Banning hurled a really splendid
game. He held the Stanford batters
hitless and scoreless until the seventh
inning, whn Captain Peavy rapped out
a scratch single to short. In the ninth
he eased up behind a safe lead, and
the Cards took three more hits and
their only run. Both nines were play
ing better ball than in the previous
two games, and it was by far the best
of the three contests. Captain "Lefty"
Hermle wound up his career at Cali
fornia with a Babe Ruth incident into
the short center field bleachers.
Bruins Score in First Inning
California opened up in the first in
ning. King went down to Woodward's
playground on four wide ones, and
Hermle shoved him to Peavy with a
bunt when Clark juggled the ball and
was forced to throw to first. Thomp
son sent a fly to Lawson, and King
started for third. Heckendorf allowed
Lawson's peg to slip by, and King
scored the first California run.
Bill made the first hit of the day
in the second inning, dropping one of
Clark's offerings in center field for a
single. In the third, Hermle robbed
Clark of a clean double by a spec
tacular snag of his high line drive
down the first base line.
Cards' Chance in Fourth
Stanford had a big chance in the
fourth. Deffebach walked and Erb
muffed the throw at second when King
attempted to force on Carver's ground
er. Heckendorf forced Charlie at third,
but Woodward stopped a pitch with
the back of his neck, filling the sacks.
With two out, Patterson rolled one
to Banning and was thrown out at
first.
California scored twice in the sixth.
Hermle caught one on the end of his
bat and crossed the plate while the
ball was bouncing around in the
bleachers. Thompson scorched a single
through the pitcher's box, and both
were safe when Douthit rolled to
Clark who threw too slowly on a good
chance for a double play. Bowen flied
out to Peavy, but Bill scored Thomp
son with a hit to right field. Douthit
was caught at third on the throw-in,
Deffebach to Heckendorf.
Stanford Fills Bases
Stanford filled the bases again in
the next inning, but again the punch
was lacking at the crucial moment.
"Bud" Woodward took a base on balls
and Patterson was out on a fly to left
field. Peavy cracked one down to short,
and Gerlach and King both fielded the
ball. In the confusion Peavy got a hit
and Woodward was safe at second.
Mulchay popped to King, and "Lefty"
May went in to hit for Clark. He also
walked, but Dick Lawson drove a fly
to Bill and chance was gone. Teague
then took the mound for the Cards.
The infield began to do funny things
to the ball in the eighth, and the
Bruins got their final tally. King got a
life when the pill whizzed by Mul
chay, and he immediately stole second.
Hermle grounded to Peavy, advancing
him to third. Eby bunted, and King
registered on a beautiful squeeze play
that caught the Cards napping. Dout
hit made first on a grounder that took
a weird bounce out of Woodward's
hands, but Bowen dropped a fly into
Heckendorf's mitt and ended the dan
ger.

chance for a double play. Bowen flied
out to Peavy, but Bill scored Thomp
son with a hit to right field. Douthit
was caught at third on the throw-in,
Deffebach to Heckendorf.
Stanford Fills Bases
Stanford filled the bases again in
the next inning, but again the punch
was lacking at the crucial moment.
"Bud" Woodward took a base on balls
and Patterson was out on a fly to left
field. Peavy cracked one down to short,
and Gerlach and King both fielded the
ball. In the confusion Peavy got a hit
and Woodward was safe at second.
Mulchay popped to King, and "Lefty"
May went in to hit for Clark. He also
walked, but Dick Lawson drove a fly
to Bill and chance was gone. Teague
then took the mound for the Cards.
The infield began to do funny things
to the ball in the eighth, and the
Bruins got their final tally. King got a
life when the pill whizzed by Mul
chay, and he immediately stole second.
Hermle grounded to Peavy, advancing
him to third. Eby bunted, and King
registered on a beautiful squeeze play
that caught the Cards napping. Dout
hit made first on a grounder that took
a weird bounce out of Woodward's
hands, but Bowen dropped a fly into
Heckendorf's mitt and ended the dan
ger.
Cards Tally in Last Frame
Stanford's only run came in the
ninth inning. Woodward got the first
clean hit of the game when he Texas
leagued over second, but was forced
on Patterson's grounder to King.
Parker, hitting for Peavy, grounded
to King, who made a pick-up that
smacked of burglary. Mulchay walked,
and McCandless, pinch-hitting for Mil
ton Teague, singled prettily through
second base. With the bases again
loaded, Lawson drove the ball to left
field and Patterson came in with the
Stanford counter.
Clark pitched a worthy game during
the seven innings, but bis team could
not back him up in the pinches.
