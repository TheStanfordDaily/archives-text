# CALIFORNIA TRACKSTERS WIN FROM CARDS BY 82½-48½ SCORE
## Falk Shatters Records In Hurdles; Campbell Sets New Mark In 220; Bears Sweep Field Events. 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
Five Stanford-California records went into the discard Saturday when the
Bruin track team defeated Coach "Dink" Templeton's Cardinals 82% to 48%.
Three of those five records suffered at the hands of Stanford track stars and
yet the inexperienced and sadly overbalanced squad could not cope witfc
Christie's seasoned veterans.
Four times the Blue and Gold came through and shut out the Cardinal
entries and many more times did the track men disregard the feeble attempt*
of the dopesters and take unexpected places.
Captain Lane Falk of Stanford and Captain-elect Neufeldt of California were
the individual stars of the day. Falk ran the best races of his career, winning
both hurdles and breaking existing records in each. Neufeldt was high point
man with two firsts and a second. He won the shot and discus, breaking th©

record in the latter, and placed second
to his teammate, Sorrenti, in the jave
lin.
Upsets started with the first event
of the day. Elliott and Gurley were ex
pected to place one, two in the mile.
Elliott won easily in 4:38, but Denton
of California jockeyed Gurley out of
second place.
Then things began to happen in fast
order. Saxby and Dindstrum of Cali
fornia took first and second in the 440,
forcing Van Judah into third place
and shutting Williamson out entirely-
Here is how it happened. Williamson
had the pole and took the lead. Lind
strum cut in on him at the first curve
and "Blink" elbowed him. It looked
as if he was perfectly justified in doing
so, but the judges disqualified him. In
the meantime, the Bruin entries had
Van Judah securely boxed. He did not
get loose until too late. Saxby and
Lindstrum cut loose but Van palled
from fifth to third place in the final
twenty yards.
The high hurdle race between Falk
and Becker is one which will be long
The time, 0:15 1-10, was
made in the face of a breeze. Becker
led by inches most of the way. He
seemed to be besting the Card captain
going over the sticks but was losing
out between hurdles. At the next to
the last hurdle Falk pulled out and
won by more than a yard. Leistner ran
a close third. Falk and Leistner placed
one, two, in the low sticks easily.
Campbell lived up to expectations,
winning the 220 in record-breaking
time and taking second by inches in
the 100. Had the century been a few
feet farther, he would have beaten
Farnsworth, for he was gaining fast
in the last few yards. In the 220, he
had no trouble in leaving Shephard
five feet behind, setting a new Stan
ford-California record of 0:21 2-5.
Probably the most peculiar upset of
the day came in the half mile. Daly
and Elliott of Stanford and Bauman of
California were expected to fight It out
for the places with a few dopesters
giving Dole a chance for third. Blem
mer took the lead for more than a lap,
only to be passed by both Daly and
Bauman on the back-stretch of the
final lap. Then the unexpected hap
pened. First Dole, then Swayne, and
finally Macintosh passed the two lead
ers, finishing first, second, and third.
Only red shirts were visible at the
finish.
The two-mile was a heart-breaking
race. Hayes led the field for seven laps
but was forced to battle for hia posi
tion all the way with four Bruin run
ners. The little fellow had no one to
help him and was completely out
generaled. On the home stretch of the
final lap, Mulvaney, Caulkins, and Jen
sen passed him.
The relay was easily the most ex
citing race of the day. Williamson al
lowed Goertz to lead all the way In
the first lap until the home stretch,
where he pulled cut and gave Daly a
three-yard lead. Hurst made up the
three-yard handicap and passed Daly,
giving Lindstrum a two-yard lead over
Scofield. "Sco" stepped out, ran Lind
strum off his feet and finished even
with him. Saxby and Van Judah start
ed off together in the last lap, with
Saxby on the pole. He piled up a two
yard lead on the backstretch and
started down the homestretch. Van
had plenty of reserve, however, and
beat him out by two yards in a sensa
tional finish. The time, 3:28 1-5, was
not exceptional.
Bill Black earned for himself the
everlasting title of "the come-through
athlete." The big fellow entered the
pole vault with an ankle that few men
would have tried to walk on. Not only
did he take his every turn but he
tied "Red" Norris for first place at
twelve feet, one inch. On his third
attempt at twelve feet six, Black
cleared the bar but hit it on the way
down.

The time, 0:15 1-10, was
made in the face of a breeze. Becker
led by inches most of the way. He
seemed to be besting the Card captain
going over the sticks but was losing
out between hurdles. At the next to
the last hurdle Falk pulled out and
won by more than a yard. Leistner ran
a close third. Falk and Leistner placed
one, two, in the low sticks easily.
Campbell lived up to expectations,
winning the 220 in record-breaking
time and taking second by inches in
the 100. Had the century been a few
feet farther, he would have beaten
Farnsworth, for he was gaining fast
in the last few yards. In the 220, he
had no trouble in leaving Shephard
five feet behind, setting a new Stan
ford-California record of 0:21 2-5.
Probably the most peculiar upset of
the day came in the half mile. Daly
and Elliott of Stanford and Bauman of
California were expected to fight It out
for the places with a few dopesters
giving Dole a chance for third. Blem
mer took the lead for more than a lap,
only to be passed by both Daly and
Bauman on the back-stretch of the
final lap. Then the unexpected hap
pened. First Dole, then Swayne, and
finally Macintosh passed the two lead
ers, finishing first, second, and third.
Only red shirts were visible at the
finish.
The two-mile was a heart-breaking
race. Hayes led the field for seven laps
but was forced to battle for hia posi
tion all the way with four Bruin run
ners. The little fellow had no one to
help him and was completely out
generaled. On the home stretch of the
final lap, Mulvaney, Caulkins, and Jen
sen passed him.
The relay was easily the most ex
citing race of the day. Williamson al
lowed Goertz to lead all the way In
the first lap until the home stretch,
where he pulled cut and gave Daly a
three-yard lead. Hurst made up the
three-yard handicap and passed Daly,
giving Lindstrum a two-yard lead over
Scofield. "Sco" stepped out, ran Lind
strum off his feet and finished even
with him. Saxby and Van Judah start
ed off together in the last lap, with
Saxby on the pole. He piled up a two
yard lead on the backstretch and
started down the homestretch. Van
had plenty of reserve, however, and
beat him out by two yards in a sensa
tional finish. The time, 3:28 1-5, was
not exceptional.
Bill Black earned for himself the
everlasting title of "the come-through
athlete." The big fellow entered the
pole vault with an ankle that few men
would have tried to walk on. Not only
did he take his every turn but he
tied "Red" Norris for first place at
twelve feet, one inch. On his third
attempt at twelve feet six, Black
cleared the bar but hit it on the way
down.

Five Stanford-California records went into the discard Saturday when the
Bruin track team defeated Coach "Dink" Templeton's Cardinals 82% to 48%.
Three of those five records suffered at the hands of Stanford track stars and
yet the inexperienced and sadly overbalanced squad could not cope witfc
Christie's seasoned veterans.
Four times the Blue and Gold came through and shut out the Cardinal
entries and many more times did the track men disregard the feeble attempt*
of the dopesters and take unexpected places.
Captain Lane Falk of Stanford and Captain-elect Neufeldt of California were
the individual stars of the day. Falk ran the best races of his career, winning
both hurdles and breaking existing records in each. Neufeldt was high point
man with two firsts and a second. He won the shot and discus, breaking th©

record in the latter, and placed second
to his teammate, Sorrenti, in the jave
lin.
Upsets started with the first event
of the day. Elliott and Gurley were ex
pected to place one, two in the mile.
Elliott won easily in 4:38, but Denton
of California jockeyed Gurley out of
second place.
Then things began to happen in fast
order. Saxby and Dindstrum of Cali
fornia took first and second in the 440,
forcing Van Judah into third place
and shutting Williamson out entirely-
Here is how it happened. Williamson
had the pole and took the lead. Lind
strum cut in on him at the first curve
and "Blink" elbowed him. It looked
as if he was perfectly justified in doing
so, but the judges disqualified him. In
the meantime, the Bruin entries had
Van Judah securely boxed. He did not
get loose until too late. Saxby and
Lindstrum cut loose but Van palled
from fifth to third place in the final
twenty yards.

where he pulled cut and gave Daly a

three-yard handicap and passed Daly,
giving Lindstrum a two-yard lead over
Scofield. "Sco" stepped out, ran Lind
strum off his feet and finished even
with him. Saxby and Van Judah start
ed off together in the last lap, with
Saxby on the pole. He piled up a two

started down the homestretch. Van

not exceptional.
Bill Black earned for himself the
everlasting title of "the come-through
athlete." The big fellow entered the
pole vault with an ankle that few men

twelve feet, one inch. On his third

Five Stanford-California records went into the discard Saturday when the
Bruin track team defeated Coach "Dink" Templeton's Cardinals 82% to 48%.
Three of those five records suffered at the hands of Stanford track stars and
yet the inexperienced and sadly overbalanced squad could not cope witfc
Christie's seasoned veterans.
Four times the Blue and Gold came through and shut out the Cardinal
entries and many more times did the track men disregard the feeble attempt*
of the dopesters and take unexpected places.
Captain Lane Falk of Stanford and Captain-elect Neufeldt of California were
the individual stars of the day. Falk ran the best races of his career, winning
both hurdles and breaking existing records in each. Neufeldt was high point
man with two firsts and a second. He won the shot and discus, breaking th©

record in the latter, and placed second
to his teammate, Sorrenti, in the jave
lin.
Upsets started with the first event
of the day. Elliott and Gurley were ex
pected to place one, two in the mile.
Elliott won easily in 4:38, but Denton
of California jockeyed Gurley out of
second place.
Then things began to happen in fast
order. Saxby and Dindstrum of Cali
fornia took first and second in the 440,
forcing Van Judah into third place
and shutting Williamson out entirely-
Here is how it happened. Williamson
had the pole and took the lead. Lind
strum cut in on him at the first curve
and "Blink" elbowed him. It looked
as if he was perfectly justified in doing
so, but the judges disqualified him. In
the meantime, the Bruin entries had
Van Judah securely boxed. He did not
get loose until too late. Saxby and
Lindstrum cut loose but Van palled
from fifth to third place in the final
twenty yards.
The high hurdle race between Falk
and Becker is one which will be long
The time, 0:15 1-10, was
made in the face of a breeze. Becker
led by inches most of the way. He
seemed to be besting the Card captain
going over the sticks but was losing
out between hurdles. At the next to
the last hurdle Falk pulled out and
won by more than a yard. Leistner ran
a close third. Falk and Leistner placed
one, two, in the low sticks easily.
Campbell lived up to expectations,
winning the 220 in record-breaking
time and taking second by inches in
the 100. Had the century been a few
feet farther, he would have beaten
Farnsworth, for he was gaining fast
in the last few yards. In the 220, he
had no trouble in leaving Shephard
five feet behind, setting a new Stan
ford-California record of 0:21 2-5.
Probably the most peculiar upset of
the day came in the half mile. Daly
and Elliott of Stanford and Bauman of
California were expected to fight It out
for the places with a few dopesters
giving Dole a chance for third. Blem
mer took the lead for more than a lap,
only to be passed by both Daly and
Bauman on the back-stretch of the
final lap. Then the unexpected hap
pened. First Dole, then Swayne, and
finally Macintosh passed the two lead
ers, finishing first, second, and third.
Only red shirts were visible at the
finish.
The two-mile was a heart-breaking
race. Hayes led the field for seven laps
but was forced to battle for hia posi
tion all the way with four Bruin run
ners. The little fellow had no one to
help him and was completely out
generaled. On the home stretch of the
final lap, Mulvaney, Caulkins, and Jen
sen passed him.
The relay was easily the most ex
citing race of the day. Williamson al

Five Stanford-California records went into the discard Saturday when the
Bruin track team defeated Coach "Dink" Templeton's Cardinals 82% to 48%.
Three of those five records suffered at the hands of Stanford track stars and
yet the inexperienced and sadly overbalanced squad could not cope witfc
Christie's seasoned veterans.
Four times the Blue and Gold came through and shut out the Cardinal
entries and many more times did the track men disregard the feeble attempt*
of the dopesters and take unexpected places.
Captain Lane Falk of Stanford and Captain-elect Neufeldt of California were
the individual stars of the day. Falk ran the best races of his career, winning
both hurdles and breaking existing records in each. Neufeldt was high point
man with two firsts and a second. He won the shot and discus, breaking th©

record in the latter, and placed second
to his teammate, Sorrenti, in the jave
lin.
Upsets started with the first event
of the day. Elliott and Gurley were ex
pected to place one, two in the mile.
Elliott won easily in 4:38, but Denton
of California jockeyed Gurley out of
second place.
Then things began to happen in fast
order. Saxby and Dindstrum of Cali
fornia took first and second in the 440,
forcing Van Judah into third place
and shutting Williamson out entirely-
Here is how it happened. Williamson
had the pole and took the lead. Lind
strum cut in on him at the first curve
and "Blink" elbowed him. It looked
as if he was perfectly justified in doing
so, but the judges disqualified him. In
the meantime, the Bruin entries had
Van Judah securely boxed. He did not
get loose until too late. Saxby and
Lindstrum cut loose but Van palled
from fifth to third place in the final
twenty yards.
The high hurdle race between Falk
and Becker is one which will be long
The time, 0:15 1-10, was
made in the face of a breeze. Becker
led by inches most of the way. He
seemed to be besting the Card captain
going over the sticks but was losing
out between hurdles. At the next to
the last hurdle Falk pulled out and
won by more than a yard. Leistner ran
a close third. Falk and Leistner placed
one, two, in the low sticks easily.
Campbell lived up to expectations,
winning the 220 in record-breaking
time and taking second by inches in
the 100. Had the century been a few
feet farther, he would have beaten
Farnsworth, for he was gaining fast
in the last few yards. In the 220, he
had no trouble in leaving Shephard
five feet behind, setting a new Stan
ford-California record of 0:21 2-5.
Probably the most peculiar upset of
the day came in the half mile. Daly
and Elliott of Stanford and Bauman of
California were expected to fight It out
for the places with a few dopesters
giving Dole a chance for third. Blem
mer took the lead for more than a lap,
only to be passed by both Daly and
Bauman on the back-stretch of the
final lap. Then the unexpected hap
pened. First Dole, then Swayne, and
finally Macintosh passed the two lead
ers, finishing first, second, and third.
Only red shirts were visible at the
finish.
The two-mile was a heart-breaking
race. Hayes led the field for seven laps
but was forced to battle for hia posi
tion all the way with four Bruin run
ners. The little fellow had no one to
help him and was completely out
generaled. On the home stretch of the
final lap, Mulvaney, Caulkins, and Jen
sen passed him.
The relay was easily the most ex
citing race of the day. Williamson al
lowed Goertz to lead all the way In
the first lap until the home stretch,
where he pulled cut and gave Daly a
three-yard lead. Hurst made up the
three-yard handicap and passed Daly,
giving Lindstrum a two-yard lead over
Scofield. "Sco" stepped out, ran Lind
strum off his feet and finished even
with him. Saxby and Van Judah start
ed off together in the last lap, with
Saxby on the pole. He piled up a two
yard lead on the backstretch and
started down the homestretch. Van
had plenty of reserve, however, and
beat him out by two yards in a sensa
tional finish. The time, 3:28 1-5, was
not exceptional.
Bill Black earned for himself the
everlasting title of "the come-through
athlete." The big fellow entered the
pole vault with an ankle that few men
would have tried to walk on. Not only
did he take his every turn but he
tied "Red" Norris for first place at
twelve feet, one inch. On his third
attempt at twelve feet six, Black
cleared the bar but hit it on the way
down.
