# ON THE WRONG TRACK

"Another man out —those Redshirts haven't any
guts."
It wasn't too pleasant to sit in the midst of Cali
fornia rooters and hear a remark like that after
several Stanford men had been carried oft" the track
at the Big Meet in Berkeley Saturday. Some of the
Cardinal runners may not have been properly
trained —some of them may not have run their
races wisely—those are questions to be settled only
by athletic experts. But the very fact that they
collapsed just after crossing the tape was an indi
cation of nerve rather than lack of it. They finished
their races—putting everything possible into them.
A finish such as Van Judah's in the relay (and there
were others) is a thing of which Stanford men may
well be proud.
One could say the usual things about how the
Cardinal rooting section fought to the last—long
after the meet was definitely lost. One might re
mark about Lane Falk's performance proved that
the team had done wisely in choosing him as their
captain. These, and a few others, were the things
that made the day bearable for Stanford supporters.
But that score—B2 to 48! What to say? Those
who were hoping that Saturday would prove the
breaking point in California's string of victories
over the Cardinal will have to transfer their optim
ism to the fall quarter and begin all over again.
That day must come sometime—and what a day it
will be!
