"Now that" the athletic season is over for the
main part, it does not mean the college year is
ended. There are other matters to which students
can wisely give their time and attention. Next year
will see several changes in administrative policy, the
foremost of which are the housing projects and the
conduct of freshman affairs. Dr. Wilbur has asked
members of the student-body to give some thought
to such questions and offer constructive suggestions.
In a short time student-body officers will be chosen
for next year. Familiarity with the qualifications of
the candidates will prevent dissatisfaction with the
result of the elections. For many this will be the
last quarter of Stanford. They would do well to
store up friends and memories before leaving the
campus. Too, some attempt to absorb a little
knowledge will not be amiss—in view of the dis
tractions, social, political, and climatic, which begin
to pile up at this time of the year.
