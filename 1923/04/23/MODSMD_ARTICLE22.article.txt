# KNOWING THE BUTCHER

### 
Within the arbitrary confines of the college cam
pus there is small opportunity for close contact with
individuals of widely different interests and varying
ages. The average university comprises a fairly
unified class of society. True, it is not among a
throng of counterparts that the student moves; yet
he is not thrown with "the butcher, the baker, the
candlestick-maker." Tlis acquaintances are unavoid
ably limited in their variety. Unfortunate, but not
lamentable.
Still, there arc always chances to exchange mental
intimacies with other than fellow students and fac
ulty members. The occasions for doing so arc more
sparsely found, and require some searching out.
But they are there. And the value of being so
adaptable as to be able to talk with anyone, at his
own level, and using his own words, may not be
depreciated. Yet few appreciate the utility of the
trick. -C. N. IT.
