"Ain't it Hell?" remarked an irreverent Stanford gent,
viewing the activities on the California Stadium. "These

guys has to tear down a
hill to get a flat place to
play football on!"

As one gent so aptly re
marked the 440, the
California boxers had won
another event for Cal.

"Bury me deep, O worthy master,
Below some farm-like sod,
Below the Berkeley Campanille,
Or 'Down on the Stanford Quad'."
"The team was inexperienced,
The sprinter large and fleet,
God help me —on this hope—
I doped a Bruin-Cardinal meet.

CAMPUS PROVERBS
When in Rome, drink what the Romans brew.
If at first you don't deceive, lie, lie again.
As ye sew, so shall ye rip.
Rolling bones gather no dross.
It is never too late to spend.

A sprained ankle is, after all, only a lame excuse for
cutting classes.

Bertram Beaverboard was a nice boy. His mamma
said so.
Bertie was ultra-modest, super-sartorial, and extra
exquisite. He never did the things other boys do, and
he did the things the other boys do, and he did the
things that the other boys should have done but didn't,
if you know what we mean.
It really is a pity that Bertie's enthusiasm outstripped
his, discretion. Bertie wagered $3.50 that the Cards
would win the meet.
For the first time in his luxed life, Bertie was de
praved.
Right out loud, Bertie said "Damn!"

It is rumored that there is one Stanford man who was
not in the city last Saturday night.

When it comes to Djinns, the affair was 'way ahead
of the Arabian Nights. The Clan Gordon had a big
reunion and left plenty of dead ones to mark the spot.

Judging from the past year, the student body will have
to start attending debates. Imagine a serpentine through
the Inner Quad. ♦

Arrangements are now being made to engage a covey
of eels to serpentine in Encina pool.

Berkeley, May 1. —"Probably; and then again, prob
ably not," said H. H. Aitch, chief of detectives, when
asked if others besides Stanford runners passed out at
the finish line.

Sing out, wild maid, with hair of braid,
How did I know the rent was paid?
These eight o'clocks are sure the rocks —
Who put this hole in my last socks?
Get going, guys, we'll hit the line
And gladly sing The Fir and Pine.
The dirty buzzards jumped the gun
Do have another hot cross bun,
.They are quite hot, right from the pot,
And rather good, for twelve-pound shot.
Have you seen Buck? I hear he stuck
Some egg for ten on Stanford's luck.
The foam mounts fast into one's dome
Say mister, does this train go home?
—LAUNCELOT LUMP.
