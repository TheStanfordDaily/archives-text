# A 						Laugh on the Horse
## 
### 
The University of California has recently been sub
jected to more than its share of irritating journalistic
nuisances. First there was the Laughing Horse and now
the Campus Bee, the two making a couple of irritating
horse flies. Friends of the State university, while
commiserating with the decent and sensible population
of the campus and congratulating them because the
perpetrators of these publications have proved them
selves otherwise unfitted to remain in college, may also
gain added confidence in the soundness of ordinary,
everyday notions by observing the pathetic antics of
these prematurely embittered youths and the circum
stances in which they poured out their vitriol.
We are too much inclined to be impressed by shallow
criticism dressed up in sweeping phrases, with some
cleverness and a vast amount of unrestrained assurance.
The cold, hard facts are that these lads were not
equipped with the solid stuff that is necessary for re
taining a place in the University student body. It is
not, as they would doubtless like to believe, that they
were too brilliant or too full of genius to tolerate the
narrowness and thinness of the intellectual life there,
but that they fall short of the comparatively easy re
quirements to be permitted to remain.
These scathing articles, then, that sneer at everything
the university is or provides, are the works of demon
strated failures. Therein, rather than in the irk of con
fined and restricted genius, lies the inspiration of their
jeers and jibes. And more frequently than most people
suspect, that is true. There is no surer cause to create
carping criticism than jealousy, even though the victim
of the Jealousy may not realize that he is jealous of his
fellows who are succeeding where he failed. These
young misanthropes who have left the University of
California may believe that they scorn the sort of things
that make success at the university and believe that
they are too delicately developed to be satisfied with
such things, but, give them good red blood, enriched by
well-digested food, normal working brains, and even a
moderate success in anything on earth, then see if the
world doesn't automatically come to be a happier plac'e
to them.
For healthy, honest, reasonably industrious people it
is easy to be cheerful and to find plenty of worth-while
things irf the world. But for people suffering from mal
nutrition of body or mind or soul it is the easiest thing
to fall into the habit of indiscriminate fault-finding. But
we whose hearts and heads are working smoothly will
do well to remember that when we are tired or sick
we oudselves sometimes come close to being chronic
pssimists and find it easy to say nasty, cutting things,
and not be too much taken in by those ir whom the
habit has become fixed. â€”Daily Palo Alto Times.
