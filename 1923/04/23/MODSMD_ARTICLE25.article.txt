# How We Study!
## 
### 
"Come on, go to the Library with me!"
"No, I can't; I've got to study!"
As if every one who goes to the Li
brary doesn't study until his brain is
cramped! Of course a few cases do
need a little explanation.
Now, there's the young man with a
couple of law books spread out in front
of him who looks up every time some
one passes his table. He may be taking
a course in Insurance, but he is probably
interested in art, and here is a chance
to study some hand-painted faces.
Then there's the coy young miss, who
looks into a small mirror quite frequent
ly. But one must reflect while one is
studying.
These people who walk up and down
the reference room so many times, are
they industrially inclined? You bet!
They are doing work for a course in
surveying.
Yet there are a few exceptions to the
rule. For instance, the young man or
woman who won't study and sit in a cor
ner and read, pages and pages for hours
and hours. Some people will be dif
ferent !
Why most students work so hard that
they go to the Library on Sundays. This
is an excellent day to review for "exs."
And it takes a keen mind to review. If
one isn't on the alert every minute, some
smart spring frock or a good-looking
Society Brand suit will slip by unnoticed.
Reviewing means constant concentration
and attention. "Exs" are such a nui
sance !
