# Chappie's Junior Week Issue Dedicated to '24
## 
### 
Having played in the Pelican's back
yard to his heart's content, this month
Chappie comes back to his own stamping
grounds. The return is signalized by
the devotion of the next issue to Junior
Week. The Junior Week number of
Chappie will be dedicated to the juniorr
and their doings, and will probably ap
pear during the week jvhen those gentry
are in possession of the campus. When
interviewed on the subject, the Old Boy
scratched his head with a pelican-feather
and remarked as how this issue would
mark the very height of excellence iQ
the Ancient One's long and sinful career.
Copy for the forthcoming masterpiece I
should be in the gnarled hands of the
Foolish One by April 28, and drawings
should be in by April 25. The Old Boy
is at present spending most of his time
with one eye on the Foolish Cup and the
other on a select assortment of paddles,;
and it is well for contributors to pad
themselves well with copy before enter
ing the sanctum.
