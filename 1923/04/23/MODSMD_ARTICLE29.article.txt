# FAN PALMS DYING OUT ON UNIVERSITY DRIVE
## 
### 
Eucalyptus trees are causing the
dying out of the California desert fan
palms near the northern end of Palm
Drive, according to Professor Leroy D.
Abrams of the Botany department. The
date palms which are alternated with
the California fan palms along the
drive are, however, not affected by
the eucalyptus trees. The dying out of
the fan palms near the Palo Alto en
trance has been noticed for some time
but it was only recently that it was
discovered that the eucalyptus was the
cause. The fan palms, although native
to California, have never done well at
Stanford as they need more heat. The
date palms, however, have been very
successfully grown here.
