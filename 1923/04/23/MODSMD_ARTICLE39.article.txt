# BABE NINE RESUMES PRACTICE AFTER REST
## 
### 
Freshmen baseball players will resume '
practice again this afternoon after a
week's rest from the diamond. The team i
ended the main part of its season a week'
ago Saturday when it lost the second
game of the annual three-game series:
to the Bruin Babes by a score of 4-2.
The California series was the climax
of the season. The remainder of the
year will be spent in practice under the
eye of Coaches "Husky" Hunt and Harry
Wolter. Wolter will give particular
attention to the men who give promise of
making the varsity next year. Practice
will be held three times a week, and one
outside contest will be scheduled with
some high school each week.
