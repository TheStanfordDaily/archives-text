# STANFORD MERMEN WIN P.A.A. SWIMMING MEET IN OLYMPIC CLUB TANK
## Austin, Kraemer and Allen Capture Junior P.A.A. Championships. 
### 
Salt water in the Olympic Club tank
bore a decided cardinal hue when the
Stanford swimmers left it Friday night
after the Pacific Athletic Association
meet. Five of the six events were car
ried away by Coach Ernie Brandsten's
men. The lone first place left for an
outsider was captured by the Olympic
Club.
The hundred-yard free-style, for the
Junior Pacific Association championship
was won by Austin of Stanford in one
minute flat. Although Austin did 0:59.4
last week against California, he was not
sufficiently pressed to equal his former
time.
Immediately following this event,

Kraemer of the Cards walked away with
the 220-yard, junior P. A, breaststroke
title. All season Kraemer has been close
ly following intercollegiate champion
Fletcher to the tape, so his time for Fri
day night's encounter was no surprise to
Stanford fans. —
The 500-yard free-style for the junior
P. A. championship was won by Allen, a
Stanford freshman. Previous to this
meet, he had been specializing in the 50
and 100 yard sprints, winning against
the California freshmen this year.
The next event, which went to the
Olympic Club, found O'Connor, another
freshman, trailing Lester Smith of the
club team, to the tape in the 150-yard
open backstroke. The race was close,
although Smith proved himself to be a
much stronger swimmer than any of the
other entrants. Bobdy, another Olympic
Club swimmer, dropped into third place.
In the 100-yard handicap, Hirschmann
and McCallister of Stanford romped into
first and second places, respectively.
The medley swim, the first ever staged
in the Olympic Club pool, was the cause
of quite a bit of excitement. Although
Schroth of the Olympic Club was the
first to touch the finishing line, he was
disqualified, and the race was given to
O'Connor of Stanford, who finished in
second place.
