# Pi Kappa Tau Petitions Scabbard and Blade for National Charter Grant
## 
### 
Pi Kappa Tau, military honorary fra
ternity, is petitioning for a charter from
Scabbard and Blade.
As Pi Kappa Tau is only a local fra
ternity, the members feel that it would
be advantageous to become a chapter of
a larger group. Scabbard and Blade is
an honorary military fraternity repre
sented in many college R. O. T. C. units
in the country.
