# CARNIVAL MASQUE WILL BE MODELLED AFTER MARDI GRAS
## SPECIAL ACTS TO AMUSE MERRYMAKERS Grand March, Coronation of King and Queen, to Be Parts of program 
### 
From the moment the merry-makers
enter the Pavilion until the last dance
is over and the final song is blissfully
forgotten, the Carnival Masque will be
crammed full of excitement.
Mardi Gras Spirit to Reign
"Abandon dignity, all ye who enter
here!" will be the succinct warning over
the flower-bedecked entrance. The spirit
of the New Orleans Mardi Gras will be
the model for the carnival spirit of
gaiety and unrestrained merry-making,
but with no rowdyism. A grand march,
"for to see and to be seen," will open
the high jinks; dancing and general
jollification will fill the program until
the coronation of the king find queen
at 10:30. A Mephistophelian master of
ceremonies and his cohort of madcaps
will be officially responsible for the ir
responsibility of the masqueraders.
Special Skits Billed
A special dance or two, or a skit, will
break the evening entertainment after the
coronation; the committee, however, is
planning little that will make spectators
of the dancers. The carnival is every
student's one big shindig of the year,
and it will be up to him to make it a
short evening and a merry one. Any
one caught with a serious face after the
herald's signal for the grand march will
immediately be sentenced to gazing upon
his own reflection in a mirror (insured)
for an indeterminate period, depending
upon the gravity of the offending counte
nance.
Decoration plans are still up in the air,
but will probably be announced before
the dopesters recover from Saturday's
upset.
