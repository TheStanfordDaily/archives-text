### 
Theta Xi defeated Phi Delta Theta in
a good exhibition of baseball yesterday
by a score of 10-2. Three other games
were scheduled, but in each case one of
the teams did not show up, thereby losing
the contest by forfeit. Theta Delta Chi
won by forfeit from Alpha Kappa
Lambda; El Toro forfeited to Delta Tan
Delta; and Alpha Delta Phi won by for
feit from Japanese Club.
The Phi Delta Theta team had won
two games and were looked upon by
many as the strongest in the league.
Yesterday, however, it was a case of a
good team having an off day going up
against a better team. Maillot, the I beta
Xi pitcher, was the outstanding star of
the game. He allowed but six scattered
hits, fanned several, and was strict in
giving free trips to first base. Edwards
did the mound work for the Phi Dclts.
He pitched well most of the time, but
the Theta Xi batters, aided by errors,
scored 5 runs in the third and 3 in the
fifth.
