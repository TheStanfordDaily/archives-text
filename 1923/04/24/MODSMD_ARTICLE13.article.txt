the teams did not show up, thereby losing
the contest by forfeit. Theta Delta Chi
won by forfeit from Alpha Kappa

the game. He allowed but six scattered

giving free trips to first base. Edwards
did the mound work for the Phi Dclts.

the Theta Xi batters, aided by errors,
scored 5 runs in the third and 3 in the
fifth.
