# WISE FOOLS

### 
With literature and life filled with the pining of
age for the return of its youth, it seems strange that
those of us who are still young are ashamed of the
fact. The most withering admonition which your
matured collegian may deliver is, "Grow up!"
In order to prove that we have at last realized
our responsibility, that we are no longer children,
and that the cares of the world rest heavily on our
shoulders, we must rush about with wrinkled brow
from place to place. If we stop for a word or two,
it must l>e the expression of a definite, unchangeable
view upon some weighty tpoic. Nobody is less
tolerant of youth's inconsistencies than youth itself.
It is well to be busy. There is work for us to do
—for we all must eat, if we have no other reason,
llxtt vulav insist that pvptv moment not spent in some
activity that can be classed in the category oT work
is a total loss? There is an art to being idle and to
playing the fool. It is an art that is easily prosti
tuted but then, so is the art of diligent attention to
one's duties.
It is necessary that we be something and believe
something at all of the various mental stages through
which we must pass. But it is not necessary that
we consider what we are at the moment any indica
tion of what we shall be ten years from now. Some
writer has said that the man who is the same at
thirty as he was at twenty has been stagnant for
years. Let us say something and do something,
realizing at the same time that we are still young.
And if there are those of our number or of earlier
generations who rise to condemn us, there is always
the consoling plea of Robert Louis Stevenson: "For
Ciods sake give me the young man who has brains
enough to make a fool of himself."
