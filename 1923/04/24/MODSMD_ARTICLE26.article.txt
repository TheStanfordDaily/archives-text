A spoken drama between a Professor and Student dis
cussing a recently incurred "D.'*
Scene: NO PLACE IN PARTICULAR.
Time: Ditto.
STUDENT: All! My dear professor, good morning.
I dare say if you are indisposed I would attempt to
broach a subject whic'i, although of no consequence,
has its slight importance.
PROFESSOR: Oh! "Yes, do! lam anxious, even an
ticipating to hear it.
STUDENT: It pertains to the very high grada I
received last quarter, and fearing you might have acci
dentally made some—er —mistake, I wished to bring it
to your attention immediately.
PROFESSOR: I see, you must have received a "G" —
STUDENT: No, no, you vrong me, a "D."
PROFESSOR: A "D," indeed! My, my, how inex
cusable.
STUDENT: Yes, I know I shouldn't have studied so
hard; my health
PROFESSOR: Not at all, n.y worthy fellow; what I
meant to say was, how inexcusable of me to give such
a low mark. I shall see that it is changed immediately.
STUDENT: It was on that point that I wished to
base my plea. In short, profess r, I think I really de
serve a minus; my conscience demands it.
PROFESSOR: A minus! Impossible! Such things are
unheard of in this University! Why—why—is this an
insult.
STUDENT (trembling with emotion): Sir, if you can
forgive me, my better half says it m ust be.
PROFESSOR: I reassure you thfs will break down
my spirit
STUDENT (wringing his hands)? Nevertheless it
must be. I would not face my mothe 1 * (tears).
PROFESSOR: Your plea is heart-trending. I believe
I see my duty. (Places left hand brow, which ap
pears to be sweaty).
STUDENT (Jumping with joy): C)h, sir, if you only
knew how happy you have made me (Kisses lapel of
professor's coat).
