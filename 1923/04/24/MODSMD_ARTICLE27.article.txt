The Italian Villa
Before Leland Stanford, Jr., died, 1
Senator and Mrs. Stanford planned a
magnificent villa of Italian style. The
site of the present Mausoleum was
chosen as the location. It was planned
to lay out the arboretum in extensive
gardens and build seventeen miles of
drives about the estate.
Senator Stanford intended to make
the villa the hub of the campus, with
the several drives radiating from it
like the spokes of a wheel. Some
avenues were laid out, which accounts
for the present lanes in the arboretum.
When Leland Jr. died in Italy, these
plans were given up, and the Stanfords
concentrated their efforts on a me
morial.
The Stanford "Cottage''
"The Cottage," the residence of the
family on the estate, wa senlarged.
This new part of the house was de
stroyed in the earthquake of 1906.
The old Stanford residence was at
one time owned by an Englishman
named Goroon, who was known chiefly
for his hospitality and lavish enter
tainment of his guests. He called his
estate Palo Alto, since two big red
wood trees, one of which still stands,
were on his property.
