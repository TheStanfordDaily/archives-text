# THE 						HINDU
## 
### 
No play which can manage to get'
across the great cultural desert be- 1
tween St. Louis and San Francisco
can be of a very heavy character and
"The Hindu," starring Walker White
side, is proverbiably "not an exception
to the rule." Hailed as a "stirring
Oriental mystery drama,'* it is guar
anteed not to make one thing through
out the entire course of the action.!
Prince Tamar, a powerful Indian po
tentate, portrayed by Mr. Whiteside,
has the principle role and is mads sa
wicked and brutal in the first act that
one knows that before the final cur
tain he will be proven to be at least
99 44-100 pure.
The play opens with a prologue,
showing a beautiful English girl about
to be sent out by officials of Scotland
Yard on the trail of a group of interna-!
tional thieves who have thus .far I
eluded the police. The course of the
action is transferred to India where ,
the plot is involved with an Indian
uprising fomented by Prince Tamar.
No story of India could be successful 1
without an uprising of the natives. A 1
plot without this essential would be as |
bad as Charlie Chaplin without his;
mustache or Rudolph Valentino with
out his patent leather hair. Yet, we!
nevertheless hope that the desire for
unfettered religion will fail the Hindus
In the future —at least in fiction and
drama.
Mr. Whiteside and his company
wade manfully through the usual as
sortment of thrills and mysteriousj
whisperings and although lacking
some of "The Bat" trimmings, the ac
tion is successfully advanced to the
climax where a wholly unsuspected
character is proven to be the true
villain, and the character of the Hindu
prince is tardily whitewashed. While j
not recommending the play to lovers j
of Shakespeare and Ibsen, we never-!

theless consider the recreational
value to greatly exceed the admission
price.—W. L. G.
