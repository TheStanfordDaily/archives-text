# Beauties, Ponies, and Gentlemen Get "All Teed Up" Last Night
## 
### 
One hour late for "tee" and "All
Teed Up" by 8 o'clock!
Sorority-tea etiquette was violat
ed when about one-half the "ponies,
beauties, caddies, and gentlemen of
the 1924 Junior Opera choruses
called an hour late for "tee" in the
Assembly hall last night. Out of
respect for accepted rules of eti
quette the directors of the Opera
ask that the cast and choruses drop
in at 7 o'clock promptly tonight in
order to get "All Teed Up" by
7:30.
"All Teed Up" is the name of the
opening musical number of the 1924
Opera, and typifies its "country
club-golf' background.
