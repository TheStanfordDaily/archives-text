# Miss Bunting Is Back From Eastern Trip
## 
### 
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, head
of the Women's Physical Education
department, returned to the campus
the latter part of last week from the
East, where she attended three con
ferences of women's athletic associa
tions.
The convention of the National Ama
teur Athletic Federation of America
at which Mrs. Herbert Hoover pre
sided, met in Washington, D. C., and
was called for the purpose of organ
izing work in physical education for
the women of America. Miss Bunting
spoke at the conference on the sub
ject of "Inter-school vs. Intramural
Sports" and described interclass-inter
collegiate athletic tournaments at
Stanford. She emphasized the fact that
varsity competition developed one
team at the expense of the rest of the
campus, whereas interclass athletic
contests developed several class teams.
Miss Bunting also attended two
conventions at Wellesley College and
Springfield, Mass. At the Springfield
conference, the National Basketball
Committee met to revise the rules for
next year's hoop season and to stand
ardize track and field events for wo
men.
