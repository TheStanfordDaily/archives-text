# ECKART ENGINEERING TOOLS ARE GIVEN TO UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
As a memorial to William Robert
Eckart, who as an engineer was closely
identified with the development of Cali
fornia for fifty years, his family, which
includes W. R. Eckart, professor of Me
chanical Engineering at Stanford, and
Nelson A. Eckart, assistant city engineer
of San Francisco, has given his valuable
collection of precision tools and instru
ments to Stanford, and established a
supporting fund for the purpose of fos
tering and encouraging experimental re
search engineering.
The collection, which includes a large
number of extremely fine precision tools
and instruments for use in delicate ex
periments, is worth about $,000. The
fund, which has been established with
$600, to be added to as need arises, will
enable students in advanced research
work and members of the faculty to pur
chase other equipment as required. A
special room for the maintenance and
use of the collection is being fitted up
in the Mechanical Engineering building.
Eckart was one of the best-known en
gineers in the United States and won
pre-eminence in many departments *of
engineering, bringing him membership in
American and British societies of civil
engineers, mechanical engineers, naval
architects, and marine and naval engi
neers. Eastern-born, he came to Cali
fornia during the Civil War and passed
with remarkable credit an examination
as naval engineer. He was assigned to
duty with the fleet on the Pacific Coast.
,In 1865, the designs and drawings for the
first California-built locomotive, which

made its trial trip from San Francisco
to San Jose, were made by him. In later
years he was closely identified as an
engineer with the development of great
mining projects in the state and with
the development of hydraulic works and
the transmission of electrical power. He
also carried on valuable work in the
testing of steamship propellor designs.
He died in 1914 at the home of Professor
Eckart, with whom he was living.
Uniting- in the establishment of the
William Roberts Eckart Research Fund
in Mechanical Engineering are hits
widow, Mrs. Harriet Louise Eckart of
Palo Alto, Professor W. R. Eckart,
Charles F. Eckart, an engineer of Hono
lulu, Nelson A. Eckart, assistant city en
gineer of San Francisco, and Mrs.
Charles E. Hume of Oakland.
For a number of years, Mr. Eckart's
enthusiasm for fine tools and instru
ments led him to purchase especially fine
examples until he had gathered a re
markably valuable collection. The Eck
art family has for several generations
been of an engineering Hun of mini and
the widow and children <~f William Rob
erts Eckart planned that his grandchil
dren, a number of whom ar studying
engineering, make use of this collection.
By donating the collection to Stanford
with a fund for its maintenance and de
velopment, they make this collection of
use to a larger and continually growing
group of young men preparing them
selves in the engineering profession,
either as practicing engineers or as men
interested in engineering research.

Uniting- in the establishment of the
William Roberts Eckart Research Fund
in Mechanical Engineering are hits
widow, Mrs. Harriet Louise Eckart of
Palo Alto, Professor W. R. Eckart,
Charles F. Eckart, an engineer of Hono
lulu, Nelson A. Eckart, assistant city en
gineer of San Francisco, and Mrs.
Charles E. Hume of Oakland.
For a number of years, Mr. Eckart's
enthusiasm for fine tools and instru
ments led him to purchase especially fine
examples until he had gathered a re
markably valuable collection. The Eck
art family has for several generations
been of an engineering Hun of mini and
the widow and children <~f William Rob
erts Eckart planned that his grandchil
dren, a number of whom ar studying
engineering, make use of this collection.
By donating the collection to Stanford
with a fund for its maintenance and de
velopment, they make this collection of
use to a larger and continually growing
group of young men preparing them
selves in the engineering profession,
either as practicing engineers or as men
interested in engineering research.
As a memorial to William Robert
Eckart, who as an engineer was closely
identified with the development of Cali
fornia for fifty years, his family, which
includes W. R. Eckart, professor of Me
chanical Engineering at Stanford, and
Nelson A. Eckart, assistant city engineer
of San Francisco, has given his valuable
collection of precision tools and instru
ments to Stanford, and established a
supporting fund for the purpose of fos
tering and encouraging experimental re
search engineering.
The collection, which includes a large
number of extremely fine precision tools
and instruments for use in delicate ex
periments, is worth about $,000. The
fund, which has been established with
$600, to be added to as need arises, will
enable students in advanced research
work and members of the faculty to pur
chase other equipment as required. A
special room for the maintenance and
use of the collection is being fitted up
in the Mechanical Engineering building.
Eckart was one of the best-known en
gineers in the United States and won
pre-eminence in many departments *of
engineering, bringing him membership in
American and British societies of civil
engineers, mechanical engineers, naval
architects, and marine and naval engi
neers. Eastern-born, he came to Cali
fornia during the Civil War and passed
with remarkable credit an examination
as naval engineer. He was assigned to
duty with the fleet on the Pacific Coast.
,In 1865, the designs and drawings for the
first California-built locomotive, which

made its trial trip from San Francisco
to San Jose, were made by him. In later
years he was closely identified as an
engineer with the development of great
mining projects in the state and with
the development of hydraulic works and
the transmission of electrical power. He
also carried on valuable work in the
testing of steamship propellor designs.
He died in 1914 at the home of Professor
Eckart, with whom he was living.
