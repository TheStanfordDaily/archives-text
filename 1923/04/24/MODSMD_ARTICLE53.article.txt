# PUBLICATION OF DAILY RESUMED AT MINNESOTA
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA â€”
Publication of the Minnesota Daily
suspended last January was resumed
recently. The paper was discontinued
in an effort to bring about a blanket
tax proposition requiring every stu
dent to pay 50 cents each quarter to
ward the Daily. The campaign was
successful, and publication was once
more continued after 6000 students
had signed the petitions. The paper
now has a circulation of 10,000, the
largest it has ever claimed.
