# RATCLIFFE ANALYZES PRESENT CRISIS IN EUROPEAN CONFLICT
## SOLUTION OF PROBLEM DEPENDS ON COLLECTIVE PEACE GUARANTEE AND REPARATION AGREEMENT. 
### 
Solution of the European problem depends on the agreement among the
allied governments on the terms of the German reparations and a collective
guarantee for European peace. This was the conclusion reached by S. K.
Ratcliffe, English journalist and lecturer, in his talk this morning on"The
European Crisis'' at a student body assembly.
Although the speaker characterized the present outlook as "exceedingly
dark," he believes that there is more unity of feeling, and opinion is more
consolidated now than at any time since 1914. Recent dispatches from the
continent give some hope for the probable ending of the German deadlock.

Trouble Began in 1919 <
"The present troubles began, Rat
cliffe said, "with the failure of 1919,
which was due mainly to the absence
of representatives of the defeated
countries from the conference and to
the character of the treaty which was
finally framed. This treaty was left to
political idealists who had no concep
tion of the economic aspects of its
provisions. Economic experts agreed
that a fixed sum for Germany's repara
tions and indemnities should be de
cided on and named in the treaty —but
this was not done. Lloyd George went
to Paris hampered by his declarations
made during the general election, and
he was forced to yield to the people
who clamored for extortionate indem
nities. Had Lloyd George remained
true to his decenter beliefs, Woodrow
Wilson would have had his support in
the fight for world peace."
Ruhr Invasion Militaristic
The French invasion of the Ruhr,
the speaker said, was prompted by the
current belief in France that the old
government in Germany is extant, de
spite its seeming overthrow, and
France is determined to break this
government. The invasion was the
work of the militaristic Poincare gov
ernment which would sacrifice the
hope of securing indemnities to pre
vent the economic recovery of Ger
many. During the first period, Ger

many paid enormous sums and since j
then has paid through the Reparations i
Commission great amounts in coal,
coke, and timber. They had defaulted
in only 10 per cent of their payment
before the Ruhr invasion. The politi
cal dismemberment of Germany an<
the destruction of its economic powe
are the frankly admitted aims of tfc
Poincare government.
English Policy Differs
Opposed to French policy, Engla
favors the encouragement of prod
tion and trade in Germany and
extension of export trade. Lord (
zon was quoted as saying that
French, British, and German dead t
was so complete that Britain cou'd ••
nothing but stand aside. After 10
days of occupation, France ha v.-,
cured nothing, and the passive a ctv
ance by the German people of in-!
vasion has surprised the entire rid.
"Jingo-sentiment" characterized the!
American attitude toward th<
pean crisis, Ratcliffe believei Che
Americans seem to think that n
thing for one part of Europe
to exterminate the other pa ,
United States' power, its dii
edness and its economic
should cause it to lead the w<
from the old conflict of nat
races, and religions to the
man and me furtherance <
tion," Ratcliffe concluded.
