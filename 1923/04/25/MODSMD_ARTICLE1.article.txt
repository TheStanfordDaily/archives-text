# COMEDIES OF MOLIERE ARE REVIEWED IN TUESDAYTALK
## Philosophy of Laughter Was Study of Great Master —W.W. Ellsworth 
### 
"The philosophy of laughter was the
life-long study of Moli&re," said Wil
liam W. Ellsworth in discussing the
life and times of that playwright and
aetor in his lecture at the Little Thea
ter last evening.
Molifere was the greatest master of
comedy of all times, in Ellsworth's
opinion. "He learned early how to
please his audiences and never missed
an opportunity to introduce humor or
to produce a comic effect.
Ridicule Was His Weapon
"Moßt of his plays are aimed at
some social custom or a class of peo
ple who were hypocritical or superfi
cial and whom he could justifiably
ridicule. Many of Moltere's ideas are
naturally tragic, but are turned into
comedy by his method of treating
them.
Ellsworth gave a short sketch of the
life of Molifcre. He was born in Janu
ary, 1622, in Paris, where he lived
until he started on his wanderings
through the French provinces as a
strolling actor. His real name was
Jean Baptiste Poquelin but he adopted
the pseudonym when he began his
career on the stage. The Poquelin
family belonged to the well-to-do mid
dle class. Molifere's father held the
post of upholsterer to the king and it
was planned that Moliere should suc
ceed him in this occupation. Moliere
attended primary school and later the
College de Clermont where he re
ceived a classical education.
Joins Strolling Actors
During his childhood and youth
Moli&re had ample opportunity to ob
serve the strolling actors of the day
as well as to go to the principal thea
ters of Paris. When he had been out
of school a short time he joined a
little company of actors, among whom
were the various members of the Be
jart family who were closely associ
ated with him during the remainder
of his life. After struggling for three
years in Paris this troupe left the
provinces where they remained for
twelve years.
"When Moliere returned to Paris it
was under the favor and protection
of the king who held him to be one
of the greatest men of his time,'' said
Ellsworth.
Theaters on Tennis Courts
Ellsworth described the theaters of
the time of Moli&re at which the no
bility sat on the stage and which were
often situated in tennis courts. He
gave short reviews of the comedies of
Moli&re.
"At the beginning of his career,
Moliere took tragic parts, but he soon
discovered that his field lay in com
edy. He created nearly as many char
acters as Shakespeare or Dickens.
During the fifteen years of his work
in Paris he wrote an average of two
plays a year."
During the last seven years of his
life, Moli&re was ill a large part of
the time and the medical profession
was the class against whicn his humor
was aimed most often. His death fol
lowed immediately upon a seizure
which occurred in the middle of a per
formance of his last play, "The Imag
inary Invalid."
Actors Banned by Church
"Since he was an actor and actors
were banned by the Church, he could
not have been buried in consecrated
ground had it not have been for the
interference of Louis XIV, and it was
only last year during the tercentenary
celebration of Molifcre's birth that the
final rites were accorded him by the
Church. It is a proof of his unequaled
greatness that this should be done for
a man who has been dead for three
hundred years."

comedy of all times, in Ellsworth's
opinion. "He learned early how to
please his audiences and never missed
an opportunity to introduce humor or
to produce a comic effect.
Ridicule Was His Weapon
"Moßt of his plays are aimed at
some social custom or a class of peo
ple who were hypocritical or superfi
cial and whom he could justifiably
ridicule. Many of Moltere's ideas are
naturally tragic, but are turned into
comedy by his method of treating
them.
Ellsworth gave a short sketch of the
life of Molifcre. He was born in Janu
ary, 1622, in Paris, where he lived
until he started on his wanderings
through the French provinces as a
strolling actor. His real name was
Jean Baptiste Poquelin but he adopted
the pseudonym when he began his
career on the stage. The Poquelin
family belonged to the well-to-do mid
dle class. Molifere's father held the
post of upholsterer to the king and it
was planned that Moliere should suc
ceed him in this occupation. Moliere
attended primary school and later the
College de Clermont where he re
ceived a classical education.
Joins Strolling Actors
During his childhood and youth
Moli&re had ample opportunity to ob
serve the strolling actors of the day
as well as to go to the principal thea
ters of Paris. When he had been out
of school a short time he joined a
little company of actors, among whom
were the various members of the Be
jart family who were closely associ
ated with him during the remainder
of his life. After struggling for three
years in Paris this troupe left the
provinces where they remained for
twelve years.
"When Moliere returned to Paris it
was under the favor and protection
of the king who held him to be one
of the greatest men of his time,'' said
Ellsworth.
Theaters on Tennis Courts
Ellsworth described the theaters of
the time of Moli&re at which the no
bility sat on the stage and which were
often situated in tennis courts. He
gave short reviews of the comedies of
Moli&re.
"At the beginning of his career,
Moliere took tragic parts, but he soon
discovered that his field lay in com
edy. He created nearly as many char
acters as Shakespeare or Dickens.
During the fifteen years of his work
in Paris he wrote an average of two
plays a year."
During the last seven years of his
life, Moli&re was ill a large part of
the time and the medical profession
was the class against whicn his humor
was aimed most often. His death fol
lowed immediately upon a seizure
which occurred in the middle of a per
formance of his last play, "The Imag
inary Invalid."
Actors Banned by Church
"Since he was an actor and actors
were banned by the Church, he could
not have been buried in consecrated
ground had it not have been for the
interference of Louis XIV, and it was
only last year during the tercentenary
celebration of Molifcre's birth that the
final rites were accorded him by the
Church. It is a proof of his unequaled
greatness that this should be done for
a man who has been dead for three
hundred years."
"The philosophy of laughter was the
life-long study of Moli&re," said Wil
liam W. Ellsworth in discussing the
life and times of that playwright and
aetor in his lecture at the Little Thea
ter last evening.
Molifere was the greatest master of
comedy of all times, in Ellsworth's
opinion. "He learned early how to
please his audiences and never missed
an opportunity to introduce humor or
to produce a comic effect.
