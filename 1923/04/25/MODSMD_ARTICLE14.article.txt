# SEQUOIA, S.A.E., DELTA CHI BASEBALL NINES CAPTURE SLOW INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
Three of the scheduled intramural
baseball games were played yesterday.
Delta Chi defeated Encina Third 24-9,
Sequoia Second beat Chi Psi in a 15-4
contest, and Sigma Alpha Epsilon won
from El Carapo 25-8. The Kappa Alpha
team defaulted to Los Arcos.
The Delta Chi aggregation had little
difficulty in taking the Encina team
into camp. Reticker pitched a stellar
game for Delta Chi and Encina was
not able to fathom his style of de
livery. The fielding was ragged on
both sides, but the Delta Chi's showed
superiority in the hitting department.
Hay was the outstanding slugger of
the game.

Sequoia Wins Ragged Game

In a ragged five-inning game the Se
quoia Seconds beat the Chi Psi team
on diamond two. Chi Psi took an early
lead, and made 13 runs. Sequoia then
rallied and scored 13 tallys before Chi
Psi could stop the slaughter. Chi Psi

had to change pitchers and Reeves and
Hays alternated. The game was mar
red by many errors, and Sequoia
scored a few runs while their oppon
ents were looking for the ball in the
infield grass.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon took a one
sided game from El Campo. The El
Campo players failed to support their
batteries as well as they have done in
the past, and this, together with the
superior hitting of the S. A. E. crew,
was too much for the team to over
come. Summy did some exceptional
mound work and was the main
strength of the S. A. E.'s. The outfield
work of both teams was far from par,
but streaks of clean hitting livened up
the game. Scott and Leh each gar
nered homers.
Four more games of round three will
be played today. They are: Theta Chi
vs. Phi Kappa Sigma, Sigma Chi vs.
El Tigre, Delta Upsilon vs. El Capitan,
Beta Theta Pi vs. Alpha Tau Omega.
