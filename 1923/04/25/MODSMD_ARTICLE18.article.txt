# TWO CHARITY DRIVES TO BE STARTED ON CAMPUS MAY 2
## Convalescent Home, French Fellowship, Objects of Appeal for Funds 
### 
The gift appeal to Stanford students
for this quarter will be centered on
two objects, the support of the Homo
for Convalescent Children on the cam
pus, and the establishment of a fund
in memory of Arthur Kimber, ex-'lB,
to maintain an American Field Service
fellowship for French universities
which shall be awarded annually to a
Stanford graduate. Members of the
student body will be given opportunity
to contribute to these two enterprises
next Wednesday, May 2. The campaign
is being made brief since it is felt that
the worthiness of both these projects
is self evident and there is no need
of an extended period of preliminary
effort.
Both Appeals to Be Made at Once
Under the regulations provided by
the Social Service Board of the Uni
versity, each student in the University
will have both these projects
ed to him by a single individual.
The Stanford Home for Convales
cent Children maintained in the old
Stnford family residence on the cam
pus is Stanford's own especial char
ity. At present the home has accom
modations for sixteen children who
are sent down from San Francisco;
largely from the free clinics of the
Stanford University Hospital, to re
gain health and strength before re
turning to their own homes. The
monthly expense of maintaining the
home is $450, all of which must be
raised by charity contributions. A
large part of the work connected with
the home is voluntary, including the
annual Labor Day when the under
graduate student body clears up the
grounds of the home.
Stanford Organized Early Unit
The American Field Service Fellow
ships are an outcome of the voluntary
enlistment of American college men in
the ambulance service connected with
the French army before • America en
tered the war. Stanford was one of
the first colleges to organize units for
this service, and Arthur Kimber took
to France the first American flag that
was officially borne on the battle front
after the United States entered the
war. fhis is one of the flags now rest
ing behind the chancel of the Me
morial Church.
Kimber. after America entered the
war, became an aviator and was killed
in combat in September, 1918.
Permanent Organization Formed
After the war the members of the
voluntary ambulance units formed a
' permanent organization which has
made one of its chief objects the
endowment of fellowships to enable
American students to carry on ad
| vanced study in French universities,
thereby continuing tne sympathy
which the members of the service
gained for the French people and
French institutions, as well as gaining
the advantage of special studies in the
best French universities.
It is the hope of the American Field
Service Association ultimately to es
tablish a permanent fellowship as a
memorial to each of the 127 men of the
service who lost their lives. At pres
ent the available funds enable the
association to maintain twelve annual
fellowships and one of these is now
held by Walter Gores, '17, who was
well-known for his artistic productions
as a student and who is now achiev
ing a high record as a student of the
art at the University of
Paris.
California Starts Fund
The University of California stu
dents have started a fund to establish
a memorial fellowship in honor of two
members of their student body who
lost their lives.
Six Stanford men who entered the 1
ambulance service were killed, Harold
Aupperle, *17, Wilbur L. Boyer, Grayer
Clover, ex-19, Alan H. Nichols, '19, \
Harold H. Sayre, *19, and Arthur Kim-;

for this quarter will be centered on
two objects, the support of the Homo
for Convalescent Children on the cam
pus, and the establishment of a fund
in memory of Arthur Kimber, ex-'lB,
to maintain an American Field Service
fellowship for French universities
which shall be awarded annually to a
Stanford graduate. Members of the
student body will be given opportunity
to contribute to these two enterprises
next Wednesday, May 2. The campaign
is being made brief since it is felt that
the worthiness of both these projects
is self evident and there is no need
of an extended period of preliminary
effort.
Both Appeals to Be Made at Once
Under the regulations provided by
the Social Service Board of the Uni
versity, each student in the University
will have both these projects
ed to him by a single individual.
The Stanford Home for Convales
cent Children maintained in the old
Stnford family residence on the cam
pus is Stanford's own especial char
ity. At present the home has accom
modations for sixteen children who
are sent down from San Francisco;
largely from the free clinics of the
Stanford University Hospital, to re
gain health and strength before re
turning to their own homes. The
monthly expense of maintaining the
home is $450, all of which must be
raised by charity contributions. A
large part of the work connected with
the home is voluntary, including the
annual Labor Day when the under
graduate student body clears up the
grounds of the home.
Stanford Organized Early Unit
The American Field Service Fellow
ships are an outcome of the voluntary
enlistment of American college men in
the ambulance service connected with
the French army before • America en
tered the war. Stanford was one of
the first colleges to organize units for
this service, and Arthur Kimber took
to France the first American flag that
was officially borne on the battle front
after the United States entered the
war. fhis is one of the flags now rest
ing behind the chancel of the Me
morial Church.
Kimber. after America entered the
war, became an aviator and was killed
in combat in September, 1918.
Permanent Organization Formed
After the war the members of the
voluntary ambulance units formed a
' permanent organization which has
made one of its chief objects the
endowment of fellowships to enable
American students to carry on ad
| vanced study in French universities,
thereby continuing tne sympathy
which the members of the service
gained for the French people and
French institutions, as well as gaining
the advantage of special studies in the
best French universities.
It is the hope of the American Field
Service Association ultimately to es
tablish a permanent fellowship as a
memorial to each of the 127 men of the
service who lost their lives. At pres
ent the available funds enable the
association to maintain twelve annual
fellowships and one of these is now
held by Walter Gores, '17, who was
well-known for his artistic productions
as a student and who is now achiev
ing a high record as a student of the
art at the University of
Paris.
California Starts Fund
The University of California stu
dents have started a fund to establish
a memorial fellowship in honor of two
members of their student body who
lost their lives.
Six Stanford men who entered the 1
ambulance service were killed, Harold
Aupperle, *17, Wilbur L. Boyer, Grayer
Clover, ex-19, Alan H. Nichols, '19, \
Harold H. Sayre, *19, and Arthur Kim-;
