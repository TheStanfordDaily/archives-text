# ATHLETICS AND EDUCATION
## 
### 
Do athletes help in the real purpose of an educa
tional institution ? That is an old question but it
•was brought up once more yesterday when someone
remarked that this year's record for Stanford didn't
make any difference, anyway, in view of the fact
that the University was founded primarily for the
purpose of education.
Any discussion of the relation of athletics and
scholarship must necessarily exclude that class of
students who are admittedly uninterested in and
unaffected by the outcome of intercollegiate con
tests. As far as the Administration is concerned
•there is no problem there, but the average student
is the one upon whom such contests have a decided
effect.
Victory in athletics inevitably brings- advertising
—even to the man or woman whose primary inter
ests may be along another line. Advertising of such
kind inevitably brings increased applications from
prospective college students—a majority of whom
are athletes themselves and consequently more phys
ically tit. With the educational standards which
practically every University of any reputation main
tains, the best mental applicants can be sifted from
this larger list—with the result that a better rounded
class of students will be secured.
Every man likes to be with the winners. This will
inspire him with a desire to do his I>est scholastieally
and along other lines of endeavor in order that when
he graduates he can show his diploma to men and
women of the world who will recognize the institu
tion as one that is talked about.
The general public reads of the college largely
through its athletics. Winners in athletics, they
figure, can be winners in other lines of work, and
they prefer to trust their |x>sitions to men who have
been graduated from colleges of which the public
has heard.
It is a popular impression that athletes are not
students. Practically always it can be shown that
other elements have entered into the failure of good
athletes in scholarship.
Athletics and studies are not opposed. They work
best when worked together. No educational institu
tion can lose anything by securing men who will
form winning teams —unless the means of securing
them is not honest.
