# ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCES
## 
### 
At the close of yesterday's assembly the speaker
was awarded a volley of applause. Tt must have
pleased Mr. Ratcliffe and was perhaps courteous
treatment of a campus guest. There were many in
â€¢the audience who undoubtedly enjoyed the lecture
and whose applause was genuine. But an element
of hypocrisy was extremely evident on the part of
a considerable section of the student-body who had
spent most of the hour in an effort to keep their
heads from bobbing off their necks or in endeavor
ing to prevent their snores from becoming audible.
That is no exaggeration. A numerical estimate
of the portion of the audience which slept through
the discussion of the European crisis would startle
some of the more rapt ones who were not aware of
what was going on about them.
"Disgraceful," someone said. There is a question
sa to whether the speaker himself does not come in
for some criticism on the score of delivering a thor
oughly specialized and unilluminated lecture before
a general audience. And if any students are to be
condemned, should it: be for not summoning enough
interest to ward off heavy eyelids or for waking
from a clandestine snooze to applaud vociferously
words which they had not heard? It all depends
upon whether vou value courtesy more than sincerity.
