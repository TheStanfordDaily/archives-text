# And Then They Went Forth
## 
### 
A PARABLE
An age or so ago there lived in a far country a man
who was known to himself as Murgatroyd the Chosen
of God, and to others as Murgatroyd. Some few people
who especially despised him called him Murgatroyd the
Presumptuous, and those with a sense of humor mingled
with their hatred knew him as the Ridiculous. It hap
pened that the land was greatly unconcerned about
everything except those things that brought joy to their
stomachs, or to their eyes, or to their wastrel senses,
and Murgurtoyd was serious-minded —or, as I said,
ridiculous.
Now the people of this land realized that their span
was exceedingly short. They had reason to know that
within a few brief years they would leave the unthinking
joy of their toy nation and pass into an existence bound
lessly more weighty and intricate. They made much
talk, illustrated with sweeping gestures and punctuated
with sobs, about the importance of fitting one's self
for this impending expansion. Particularly is this true
of Murgatroyd. Whenever anyone would listen willingly
(which was not often) he would build at great length
upon the idea, phrasing it in terse .common-sense terms
or in sonorous flights of idealism, according to his esti
mate of his listener's intelligence. When he could find
none to listen in silence (which was the rule) he would
deliver epigrams with the air of a dying man who
devotes his last breath to a curse. He was not popular.
There was another man in this country who was
representative of a far greater number. His name was
Jurgen, although he stood in the same relation to the
man who became pope as George Washington the boot
black does to the Father of our Country. He usually
spouted puppy philosophy about Kismet, Omar Khayyam,
Hedonism, and the disastrous effect of suppressing de
sires, but in his cups his soul vaulted beyond his estate.
He delighted in belittling himself and his accomplish
ments, and went further than that to expound on the
impossibility of ever accomplishing anything. In this
he differed radically from Murgatroyd, who never for an
instant doubted that he was destined to become a great
man.
Jurgen and Murgatroyd greeted each other smiling
ly. Jurgen called Murgatroyd a back-slapper, a glad
hander, and a ponderous nit-wit. Murgatroyd retaliated
with shallow-tank, bar-fly, and mental lightweight. All
these terms were behind the back, you understand. They
both admitted that the other might have been a good
fellow if he had stayed on the right track. And they
both made dolorous prophecies concerning the other
during the future state for which both were theoretically
fitting themselves.
It was inevitable that the few Murgatroyds, who cared,
should control the public destinies of the many Jurgens.
who didn't. Murgatroyd was proud of his political
supremacy, and took great care to preserve the succes
sion and protect it against the spasmodic attempts of
Jurgen. Jurgen didn't greatly care, however. He was a
happy-go-lucky fellow, and did the few things Murga
troyd was powerful enough to force him into with a sort
of contemptuous amusement. He wasn't very circum
spect about it, and Murgatroyd's dignity was on per
petual crutches. This pleased Jurgen immensely.
There were lesser gods who ruled this land from
afar, deigning to appear only at great religious festivals
and in cases of extreme wrong-doing. These minor
deities were omnipotent so far as the temporary career
in this particular country was concerned, but it was
universally suspected that their strength failed with
the transmigration of the individual to broader fields.
These powers always sympathized strongly with Murga
troyd and gazed askance at poor Jurgen in his futile
dashing to and fro. Strangely enough Murgatroyd lent
his influence to the workings of the semi-concealed
Providence and supported it with every bit of his feeble
might. They worked hand in glove against Jurgen, and
Jurgen, notwithstanding, managed to fog along in his
weak way. This exasperated everybody but Jurgen.
Murgatroyd and the lesser gods considered Jurgen as
a burden 011 their souls. They reasoned with him, ex
horted him. and even commanded him. In extreme cases
they did away with him. But until this happened Jurgen
was the same Jurgen, dismissing their suggestions with
many promises of the lips. And in the end, Jurgen re
mained Jurgen, or, rarely, was done away with.
PART II
As had been ordained, the time came when Jurgen and
Murgatroyd left the country of the lesser gods and
passed into a golden land of hope and opportunity, in
finitely more complicated and unlimited than the land
from whence they departed. Murgatroyd made great
outcries concerning the pain of departing from the wis
dom and bounty of the lesser gods, and moreover from
the advantages and achievements of the little nation.
From time to time, remembering himself, he spit upon
his hands and cried, "Bring me more oysters to con
quer," or words to that end. But this was an heroic
gesture. In his heart he was sad, and had a green sickly
sensation thinly veneered with bravado and artificial
confidence. He was afraid.
Jurgen, as was his custom, talked of shallow things
and 110 one knew whether he was thinking or not. Very
few suspected that he was, although some had observed
Jurgen enough to feel sure that there was more fire than
smoke. Many mourned his departure, for he had been
happy among his kind and so he had made them happy.
No one regretted the passing of Murgatroyd save the
few other Murgatroyds, and they were all bickering for
his honors.
They came to the new country together and then
parted. Murgatroyd sought an obscure position, for the
lesser gods had told him that it was better to begin at
the bottom and work up than to start at the top and
work down. Murgatroyd had taught himself to do every
thing that the lesser gods told him to, and moreover he
was not sure of himself. He desired no responsibility
until he had made a mark to aim at.
Jurgen lived on the land until he was offered some
thing he could not conveniently refuse. He then threw
himself into it and made many successes but more
mistakes. He was superseded, and went back to live
aimlessly once more. Murgatroyd heard of this and was
glad, though he regretted it outwardly. He did not con
sider the fact that Jurgen might remember his mistakes
and also his successes, and recall the manner of them.
Murgatroyd toiled along and let his rudimentary imag
ination live in the future.
With plenty of time 011 his hands Jurgen found a de
sire only to eat and to think. His stomach limited his
eating capacity and his purse curtailed it still more, so
he did much thinking. In time he got 011 the trail of a
Great Idea. Perhaps it was only the awakening of the
real Jurgen. He ate, and pondered his problem. He
shared it with others, and in time men came to him and
asked him to apply it. He did so, and after a precarious
period he found himself secure. Still he was only Jurgen,
and Murgatroyd. looking up from the obscure labor from
which he found no escape, thought him superficial, brain
less, and abnormally fortunate.—WAMßA.

dashing to and fro. Strangely enough Murgatroyd lent
his influence to the workings of the semi-concealed
Providence and supported it with every bit of his feeble
might. They worked hand in glove against Jurgen, and
Jurgen, notwithstanding, managed to fog along in his
weak way. This exasperated everybody but Jurgen.
Murgatroyd and the lesser gods considered Jurgen as
a burden 011 their souls. They reasoned with him, ex
horted him. and even commanded him. In extreme cases
they did away with him. But until this happened Jurgen
was the same Jurgen, dismissing their suggestions with
many promises of the lips. And in the end, Jurgen re
mained Jurgen, or, rarely, was done away with.
PART II
As had been ordained, the time came when Jurgen and
Murgatroyd left the country of the lesser gods and
passed into a golden land of hope and opportunity, in
finitely more complicated and unlimited than the land
from whence they departed. Murgatroyd made great
outcries concerning the pain of departing from the wis
dom and bounty of the lesser gods, and moreover from
the advantages and achievements of the little nation.
From time to time, remembering himself, he spit upon
his hands and cried, "Bring me more oysters to con
quer," or words to that end. But this was an heroic
gesture. In his heart he was sad, and had a green sickly
sensation thinly veneered with bravado and artificial
confidence. He was afraid.
Jurgen, as was his custom, talked of shallow things
and 110 one knew whether he was thinking or not. Very
few suspected that he was, although some had observed
Jurgen enough to feel sure that there was more fire than
smoke. Many mourned his departure, for he had been
happy among his kind and so he had made them happy.
No one regretted the passing of Murgatroyd save the
few other Murgatroyds, and they were all bickering for
his honors.
They came to the new country together and then
parted. Murgatroyd sought an obscure position, for the
lesser gods had told him that it was better to begin at
the bottom and work up than to start at the top and
work down. Murgatroyd had taught himself to do every
thing that the lesser gods told him to, and moreover he
was not sure of himself. He desired no responsibility
until he had made a mark to aim at.
Jurgen lived on the land until he was offered some
thing he could not conveniently refuse. He then threw
himself into it and made many successes but more
mistakes. He was superseded, and went back to live
aimlessly once more. Murgatroyd heard of this and was
glad, though he regretted it outwardly. He did not con
sider the fact that Jurgen might remember his mistakes
and also his successes, and recall the manner of them.
Murgatroyd toiled along and let his rudimentary imag
ination live in the future.
With plenty of time 011 his hands Jurgen found a de
sire only to eat and to think. His stomach limited his
eating capacity and his purse curtailed it still more, so
he did much thinking. In time he got 011 the trail of a
Great Idea. Perhaps it was only the awakening of the
real Jurgen. He ate, and pondered his problem. He
shared it with others, and in time men came to him and
asked him to apply it. He did so, and after a precarious
period he found himself secure. Still he was only Jurgen,
and Murgatroyd. looking up from the obscure labor from
which he found no escape, thought him superficial, brain
less, and abnormally fortunate.—WAMßA.
A PARABLE
An age or so ago there lived in a far country a man
who was known to himself as Murgatroyd the Chosen
of God, and to others as Murgatroyd. Some few people
who especially despised him called him Murgatroyd the
Presumptuous, and those with a sense of humor mingled
with their hatred knew him as the Ridiculous. It hap
pened that the land was greatly unconcerned about
everything except those things that brought joy to their
stomachs, or to their eyes, or to their wastrel senses,
and Murgurtoyd was serious-minded —or, as I said,
ridiculous.
Now the people of this land realized that their span
was exceedingly short. They had reason to know that
within a few brief years they would leave the unthinking
joy of their toy nation and pass into an existence bound
lessly more weighty and intricate. They made much
talk, illustrated with sweeping gestures and punctuated
with sobs, about the importance of fitting one's self
for this impending expansion. Particularly is this true
of Murgatroyd. Whenever anyone would listen willingly
(which was not often) he would build at great length
upon the idea, phrasing it in terse .common-sense terms
or in sonorous flights of idealism, according to his esti
mate of his listener's intelligence. When he could find
none to listen in silence (which was the rule) he would
deliver epigrams with the air of a dying man who
devotes his last breath to a curse. He was not popular.
There was another man in this country who was
representative of a far greater number. His name was
Jurgen, although he stood in the same relation to the
man who became pope as George Washington the boot
black does to the Father of our Country. He usually
spouted puppy philosophy about Kismet, Omar Khayyam,
Hedonism, and the disastrous effect of suppressing de
sires, but in his cups his soul vaulted beyond his estate.
He delighted in belittling himself and his accomplish
ments, and went further than that to expound on the
impossibility of ever accomplishing anything. In this
he differed radically from Murgatroyd, who never for an
instant doubted that he was destined to become a great
man.
Jurgen and Murgatroyd greeted each other smiling
ly. Jurgen called Murgatroyd a back-slapper, a glad
hander, and a ponderous nit-wit. Murgatroyd retaliated
with shallow-tank, bar-fly, and mental lightweight. All
these terms were behind the back, you understand. They
both admitted that the other might have been a good
fellow if he had stayed on the right track. And they
both made dolorous prophecies concerning the other
during the future state for which both were theoretically
fitting themselves.
It was inevitable that the few Murgatroyds, who cared,
should control the public destinies of the many Jurgens.
who didn't. Murgatroyd was proud of his political
supremacy, and took great care to preserve the succes
sion and protect it against the spasmodic attempts of
Jurgen. Jurgen didn't greatly care, however. He was a
happy-go-lucky fellow, and did the few things Murga
troyd was powerful enough to force him into with a sort
of contemptuous amusement. He wasn't very circum
spect about it, and Murgatroyd's dignity was on per
petual crutches. This pleased Jurgen immensely.
There were lesser gods who ruled this land from
afar, deigning to appear only at great religious festivals
and in cases of extreme wrong-doing. These minor
deities were omnipotent so far as the temporary career
in this particular country was concerned, but it was
universally suspected that their strength failed with
the transmigration of the individual to broader fields.

of God, and to others as Murgatroyd. Some few people
who especially despised him called him Murgatroyd the
Presumptuous, and those with a sense of humor mingled
with their hatred knew him as the Ridiculous. It hap
pened that the land was greatly unconcerned about
everything except those things that brought joy to their
stomachs, or to their eyes, or to their wastrel senses,
and Murgurtoyd was serious-minded —or, as I said,
ridiculous.
Now the people of this land realized that their span
was exceedingly short. They had reason to know that
within a few brief years they would leave the unthinking
joy of their toy nation and pass into an existence bound
lessly more weighty and intricate. They made much
talk, illustrated with sweeping gestures and punctuated
with sobs, about the importance of fitting one's self
for this impending expansion. Particularly is this true
of Murgatroyd. Whenever anyone would listen willingly
(which was not often) he would build at great length
upon the idea, phrasing it in terse .common-sense terms
or in sonorous flights of idealism, according to his esti
mate of his listener's intelligence. When he could find
none to listen in silence (which was the rule) he would
deliver epigrams with the air of a dying man who
devotes his last breath to a curse. He was not popular.
There was another man in this country who was
representative of a far greater number. His name was
Jurgen, although he stood in the same relation to the
man who became pope as George Washington the boot
black does to the Father of our Country. He usually
spouted puppy philosophy about Kismet, Omar Khayyam,
Hedonism, and the disastrous effect of suppressing de
sires, but in his cups his soul vaulted beyond his estate.
He delighted in belittling himself and his accomplish
ments, and went further than that to expound on the
impossibility of ever accomplishing anything. In this
he differed radically from Murgatroyd, who never for an
instant doubted that he was destined to become a great
man.
Jurgen and Murgatroyd greeted each other smiling
ly. Jurgen called Murgatroyd a back-slapper, a glad
hander, and a ponderous nit-wit. Murgatroyd retaliated
with shallow-tank, bar-fly, and mental lightweight. All
these terms were behind the back, you understand. They
both admitted that the other might have been a good
fellow if he had stayed on the right track. And they
both made dolorous prophecies concerning the other
during the future state for which both were theoretically
fitting themselves.
It was inevitable that the few Murgatroyds, who cared,
should control the public destinies of the many Jurgens.
who didn't. Murgatroyd was proud of his political
supremacy, and took great care to preserve the succes
sion and protect it against the spasmodic attempts of
Jurgen. Jurgen didn't greatly care, however. He was a
happy-go-lucky fellow, and did the few things Murga
troyd was powerful enough to force him into with a sort
of contemptuous amusement. He wasn't very circum
spect about it, and Murgatroyd's dignity was on per
petual crutches. This pleased Jurgen immensely.
There were lesser gods who ruled this land from
afar, deigning to appear only at great religious festivals
and in cases of extreme wrong-doing. These minor
deities were omnipotent so far as the temporary career
in this particular country was concerned, but it was
universally suspected that their strength failed with
the transmigration of the individual to broader fields.
These powers always sympathized strongly with Murga
troyd and gazed askance at poor Jurgen in his futile
dashing to and fro. Strangely enough Murgatroyd lent
his influence to the workings of the semi-concealed
Providence and supported it with every bit of his feeble
might. They worked hand in glove against Jurgen, and
Jurgen, notwithstanding, managed to fog along in his
weak way. This exasperated everybody but Jurgen.
Murgatroyd and the lesser gods considered Jurgen as
a burden 011 their souls. They reasoned with him, ex
horted him. and even commanded him. In extreme cases
they did away with him. But until this happened Jurgen
was the same Jurgen, dismissing their suggestions with
many promises of the lips. And in the end, Jurgen re
mained Jurgen, or, rarely, was done away with.
PART II
As had been ordained, the time came when Jurgen and
Murgatroyd left the country of the lesser gods and
passed into a golden land of hope and opportunity, in
finitely more complicated and unlimited than the land
from whence they departed. Murgatroyd made great
outcries concerning the pain of departing from the wis
dom and bounty of the lesser gods, and moreover from
the advantages and achievements of the little nation.
From time to time, remembering himself, he spit upon
his hands and cried, "Bring me more oysters to con
quer," or words to that end. But this was an heroic
gesture. In his heart he was sad, and had a green sickly
sensation thinly veneered with bravado and artificial
confidence. He was afraid.
Jurgen, as was his custom, talked of shallow things
and 110 one knew whether he was thinking or not. Very
few suspected that he was, although some had observed
Jurgen enough to feel sure that there was more fire than
smoke. Many mourned his departure, for he had been
happy among his kind and so he had made them happy.
No one regretted the passing of Murgatroyd save the
few other Murgatroyds, and they were all bickering for
his honors.
They came to the new country together and then
parted. Murgatroyd sought an obscure position, for the
lesser gods had told him that it was better to begin at
the bottom and work up than to start at the top and
work down. Murgatroyd had taught himself to do every
thing that the lesser gods told him to, and moreover he
was not sure of himself. He desired no responsibility
until he had made a mark to aim at.
Jurgen lived on the land until he was offered some
thing he could not conveniently refuse. He then threw
himself into it and made many successes but more
mistakes. He was superseded, and went back to live
aimlessly once more. Murgatroyd heard of this and was
glad, though he regretted it outwardly. He did not con
sider the fact that Jurgen might remember his mistakes
and also his successes, and recall the manner of them.
Murgatroyd toiled along and let his rudimentary imag
ination live in the future.
With plenty of time 011 his hands Jurgen found a de
sire only to eat and to think. His stomach limited his
eating capacity and his purse curtailed it still more, so
he did much thinking. In time he got 011 the trail of a
Great Idea. Perhaps it was only the awakening of the
real Jurgen. He ate, and pondered his problem. He
shared it with others, and in time men came to him and
asked him to apply it. He did so, and after a precarious
period he found himself secure. Still he was only Jurgen,
and Murgatroyd. looking up from the obscure labor from
which he found no escape, thought him superficial, brain
less, and abnormally fortunate.—WAMßA.

his influence to the workings of the semi-concealed
Providence and supported it with every bit of his feeble
might. They worked hand in glove against Jurgen, and
Jurgen, notwithstanding, managed to fog along in his
weak way. This exasperated everybody but Jurgen.
Murgatroyd and the lesser gods considered Jurgen as
a burden 011 their souls. They reasoned with him, ex

many promises of the lips. And in the end, Jurgen re

PART II
As had been ordained, the time came when Jurgen and
Murgatroyd left the country of the lesser gods and
passed into a golden land of hope and opportunity, in
finitely more complicated and unlimited than the land
from whence they departed. Murgatroyd made great
outcries concerning the pain of departing from the wis
dom and bounty of the lesser gods, and moreover from
the advantages and achievements of the little nation.
From time to time, remembering himself, he spit upon
his hands and cried, "Bring me more oysters to con

gesture. In his heart he was sad, and had a green sickly

confidence. He was afraid.
Jurgen, as was his custom, talked of shallow things
and 110 one knew whether he was thinking or not. Very
few suspected that he was, although some had observed
Jurgen enough to feel sure that there was more fire than
smoke. Many mourned his departure, for he had been
happy among his kind and so he had made them happy.
No one regretted the passing of Murgatroyd save the
few other Murgatroyds, and they were all bickering for
his honors.
They came to the new country together and then
parted. Murgatroyd sought an obscure position, for the
lesser gods had told him that it was better to begin at
the bottom and work up than to start at the top and
work down. Murgatroyd had taught himself to do every
thing that the lesser gods told him to, and moreover he
was not sure of himself. He desired no responsibility
until he had made a mark to aim at.
Jurgen lived on the land until he was offered some
thing he could not conveniently refuse. He then threw
himself into it and made many successes but more
mistakes. He was superseded, and went back to live
aimlessly once more. Murgatroyd heard of this and was
glad, though he regretted it outwardly. He did not con
sider the fact that Jurgen might remember his mistakes
and also his successes, and recall the manner of them.
Murgatroyd toiled along and let his rudimentary imag

A PARABLE
An age or so ago there lived in a far country a man
who was known to himself as Murgatroyd the Chosen
of God, and to others as Murgatroyd. Some few people
who especially despised him called him Murgatroyd the
Presumptuous, and those with a sense of humor mingled
with their hatred knew him as the Ridiculous. It hap
pened that the land was greatly unconcerned about
everything except those things that brought joy to their
stomachs, or to their eyes, or to their wastrel senses,
and Murgurtoyd was serious-minded —or, as I said,
ridiculous.
Now the people of this land realized that their span
was exceedingly short. They had reason to know that
within a few brief years they would leave the unthinking
joy of their toy nation and pass into an existence bound
lessly more weighty and intricate. They made much
talk, illustrated with sweeping gestures and punctuated
with sobs, about the importance of fitting one's self
for this impending expansion. Particularly is this true
of Murgatroyd. Whenever anyone would listen willingly
(which was not often) he would build at great length
upon the idea, phrasing it in terse .common-sense terms
or in sonorous flights of idealism, according to his esti
mate of his listener's intelligence. When he could find
none to listen in silence (which was the rule) he would
deliver epigrams with the air of a dying man who
devotes his last breath to a curse. He was not popular.
There was another man in this country who was
representative of a far greater number. His name was
Jurgen, although he stood in the same relation to the
man who became pope as George Washington the boot
black does to the Father of our Country. He usually
spouted puppy philosophy about Kismet, Omar Khayyam,
Hedonism, and the disastrous effect of suppressing de
sires, but in his cups his soul vaulted beyond his estate.
He delighted in belittling himself and his accomplish
ments, and went further than that to expound on the
impossibility of ever accomplishing anything. In this
he differed radically from Murgatroyd, who never for an
instant doubted that he was destined to become a great
man.
Jurgen and Murgatroyd greeted each other smiling
ly. Jurgen called Murgatroyd a back-slapper, a glad
hander, and a ponderous nit-wit. Murgatroyd retaliated
with shallow-tank, bar-fly, and mental lightweight. All
these terms were behind the back, you understand. They
both admitted that the other might have been a good
fellow if he had stayed on the right track. And they
both made dolorous prophecies concerning the other
during the future state for which both were theoretically
fitting themselves.
It was inevitable that the few Murgatroyds, who cared,
should control the public destinies of the many Jurgens.
who didn't. Murgatroyd was proud of his political
supremacy, and took great care to preserve the succes
sion and protect it against the spasmodic attempts of
Jurgen. Jurgen didn't greatly care, however. He was a
happy-go-lucky fellow, and did the few things Murga
troyd was powerful enough to force him into with a sort
of contemptuous amusement. He wasn't very circum
spect about it, and Murgatroyd's dignity was on per
petual crutches. This pleased Jurgen immensely.
There were lesser gods who ruled this land from
afar, deigning to appear only at great religious festivals
and in cases of extreme wrong-doing. These minor
deities were omnipotent so far as the temporary career
in this particular country was concerned, but it was
universally suspected that their strength failed with
the transmigration of the individual to broader fields.
These powers always sympathized strongly with Murga
troyd and gazed askance at poor Jurgen in his futile
dashing to and fro. Strangely enough Murgatroyd lent
his influence to the workings of the semi-concealed
Providence and supported it with every bit of his feeble
might. They worked hand in glove against Jurgen, and
Jurgen, notwithstanding, managed to fog along in his
weak way. This exasperated everybody but Jurgen.
