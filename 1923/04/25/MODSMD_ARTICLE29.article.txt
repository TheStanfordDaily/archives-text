# Spanish Is Most Important Foreign Language---Espinosa
## 
### 
Throughout the United States Span
ish should rank as the most important
language other than English and
should hold a foremost place in the j
curricula of the schools of this coun
try. This is the opinion of Dr. Aurelio
M. Espinosa, professor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages.
"A general knowledge of Spanish," j
says Dr. Espinosa, "will not only bring I
about a better understanding and.j
therefore, greater commercial effi-1
ciency between North and South
America, but will also help to remove j
the provincial atmosphere of the
United States by broadening the hori
zon of its people.
Commercial Importance
"Spanish in the schools is rapidly
advancing to a position of increased
importance for commercial reasons
which are self-evident in themselves.
The facts sent out by the Department
of Commerce in this regard are over
whelming. The import and export
trade with Spanish-America for 1922
amounted to one and a half billion
dollars."
Our nearest neighbors, who speak a
foreign language, are Spanish, and i
this is the vital reason, from Dr. Es-;
pinosa's point of view, for learning not j
only to read but also to speak and
write Spanish. "The wealth of Spanish
literature, art, traditions, and history,
which is closely linked to our own na
tional culture on account of the early j
development of America, makes the !
study of Spanish of great importance j
to Americans."
English Required in South America
In Chile, Argentina, and other Span
ish-American countries, English is a
required subject, while other languag-!
es are optional in the schools which
correspond to our high schools. Those;
countries, then, realize the value of a j
close relationship between the two ;
continents.
Dr. Espinosa believes that Spanish,
to a large extent, could replace Latin,
since the main claim for that language
is that it contains the roots of many j
English words, and these same ele
ments are found intact in Spanish.
American Trained Teachers
A movement for American teachers
of Spanish and better-trained teachers
is being developed by the American
Association of Teachers of Spanish, 1
which was created five years ago with
Dr. Espinosa as one of its founders.
Spain is interested in bettering the i
teaching of Spanish and in training
Americans for the work rather than
sponsoring the emigration of Span
iards for this purpose as France and j

Germany have done in the past.
The Association is receiving the co
operation of the intellectuals all over
the Spanish-speaking world. The Cen
tro de Estudios Historicos, a branch
of the University of Madrid, is work
ing with the Association in this move
ment of training American teachers
of Spanish.
Co-Authors of Text Books
So close is the co-operation between
the Madrid Centro and the Associa
tion that Dr. Espinosa is writing text
books with some of its members. He
is collaborating with Professor Na
varro Tomas, who is generally con
ceded to be the "king of phoneticians"
in "A Primer of Spanish Phonetics, '*
which will be off the press next fall.
Dr. Espinosa and Professor Antonio
Solalinde, an authority on Spanish
literature, are working together on
"Espaiia y los Espanoles," a survey
in elementary form of Spanish civiliza
tion. Both volumes are designed for
use in colleges and high schools.
Hoover's Opinion
In speaking of the importance of
the study of Spanish, Dr. Espinosa
calls attention to the following state
ment by Herbert Hoover which ap
peared in an article by Lawrence A.
Wilkins in "Hispania," the official
publication of the Association and of
which Dr. Espinosa is the editor:
"The Spanish language occupies in
this continent a place of importance
second only to that of English, and
even in territory within the jurisdic
tion of the United States a knowledge
of Spanish is of considerable impor
tane. In most of the other republics
the study of English has become com
pulsory in the public schools during
the last decade. We must take par
ticular care to see that the study of
Spanish, if not made compulsory, is
at least made possible in all second
ary schools. Improvement of our rela
tions with other countries of the con
tinent will require a far wider knowl
edge of their economic conditions,
their institutions, and their culture
than we now possess, and the gateway
to any such knowledge is the correct
use of the languages. The building up
of a sound and enduring commercial
policy with respect to Latin America
will be dependent upon the existence
of a growing number of men and wo
men trained in Spanish and Portu
guese; and, consequently, every high
school should offer courses in Spanish,
while those high schools aiming to pro
vide special training in commercial
subjects should also make available
courses in Portuguese."

ment by Herbert Hoover which ap
peared in an article by Lawrence A.
Wilkins in "Hispania," the official
publication of the Association and of
which Dr. Espinosa is the editor:
"The Spanish language occupies in
this continent a place of importance
second only to that of English, and
even in territory within the jurisdic
tion of the United States a knowledge
of Spanish is of considerable impor
tane. In most of the other republics
the study of English has become com
pulsory in the public schools during
the last decade. We must take par
ticular care to see that the study of
Spanish, if not made compulsory, is
at least made possible in all second
ary schools. Improvement of our rela
tions with other countries of the con
tinent will require a far wider knowl
edge of their economic conditions,
their institutions, and their culture
than we now possess, and the gateway
to any such knowledge is the correct
use of the languages. The building up
of a sound and enduring commercial
policy with respect to Latin America
will be dependent upon the existence
of a growing number of men and wo
men trained in Spanish and Portu
guese; and, consequently, every high
school should offer courses in Spanish,
while those high schools aiming to pro
vide special training in commercial
subjects should also make available
courses in Portuguese."
Throughout the United States Span
ish should rank as the most important
language other than English and
should hold a foremost place in the j
curricula of the schools of this coun
try. This is the opinion of Dr. Aurelio
M. Espinosa, professor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages.
"A general knowledge of Spanish," j
says Dr. Espinosa, "will not only bring I
about a better understanding and.j
therefore, greater commercial effi-1
ciency between North and South
America, but will also help to remove j
the provincial atmosphere of the
United States by broadening the hori
zon of its people.
Commercial Importance
"Spanish in the schools is rapidly
advancing to a position of increased
importance for commercial reasons
which are self-evident in themselves.
The facts sent out by the Department
of Commerce in this regard are over
whelming. The import and export
trade with Spanish-America for 1922
amounted to one and a half billion
dollars."
Our nearest neighbors, who speak a
foreign language, are Spanish, and i
this is the vital reason, from Dr. Es-;
pinosa's point of view, for learning not j
only to read but also to speak and
write Spanish. "The wealth of Spanish
literature, art, traditions, and history,
which is closely linked to our own na
tional culture on account of the early j
development of America, makes the !
study of Spanish of great importance j
to Americans."
English Required in South America
In Chile, Argentina, and other Span
ish-American countries, English is a
required subject, while other languag-!
es are optional in the schools which
correspond to our high schools. Those;
countries, then, realize the value of a j
close relationship between the two ;
continents.
Dr. Espinosa believes that Spanish,
to a large extent, could replace Latin,
since the main claim for that language
is that it contains the roots of many j
English words, and these same ele
ments are found intact in Spanish.
American Trained Teachers
A movement for American teachers
of Spanish and better-trained teachers
is being developed by the American
Association of Teachers of Spanish, 1
which was created five years ago with
Dr. Espinosa as one of its founders.
Spain is interested in bettering the i
teaching of Spanish and in training
Americans for the work rather than
sponsoring the emigration of Span
iards for this purpose as France and j

Germany have done in the past.
The Association is receiving the co
operation of the intellectuals all over
the Spanish-speaking world. The Cen
tro de Estudios Historicos, a branch
of the University of Madrid, is work
ing with the Association in this move
ment of training American teachers
of Spanish.
Co-Authors of Text Books
So close is the co-operation between
the Madrid Centro and the Associa
tion that Dr. Espinosa is writing text
books with some of its members. He
is collaborating with Professor Na
varro Tomas, who is generally con
ceded to be the "king of phoneticians"
in "A Primer of Spanish Phonetics, '*
which will be off the press next fall.
Dr. Espinosa and Professor Antonio
Solalinde, an authority on Spanish
literature, are working together on
"Espaiia y los Espanoles," a survey
in elementary form of Spanish civiliza
tion. Both volumes are designed for
use in colleges and high schools.

Dr. Espinosa as one of its founders.
Spain is interested in bettering the i
teaching of Spanish and in training
Americans for the work rather than
sponsoring the emigration of Span
iards for this purpose as France and j

Germany have done in the past.
The Association is receiving the co
operation of the intellectuals all over
the Spanish-speaking world. The Cen
tro de Estudios Historicos, a branch
of the University of Madrid, is work
ing with the Association in this move
ment of training American teachers
of Spanish.
Co-Authors of Text Books
So close is the co-operation between
the Madrid Centro and the Associa
tion that Dr. Espinosa is writing text
books with some of its members. He
is collaborating with Professor Na
varro Tomas, who is generally con
ceded to be the "king of phoneticians"
in "A Primer of Spanish Phonetics, '*
which will be off the press next fall.
Dr. Espinosa and Professor Antonio
Solalinde, an authority on Spanish
literature, are working together on
"Espaiia y los Espanoles," a survey
in elementary form of Spanish civiliza
tion. Both volumes are designed for
use in colleges and high schools.
Hoover's Opinion
In speaking of the importance of
the study of Spanish, Dr. Espinosa
calls attention to the following state
ment by Herbert Hoover which ap
peared in an article by Lawrence A.
Wilkins in "Hispania," the official
publication of the Association and of
which Dr. Espinosa is the editor:
"The Spanish language occupies in
this continent a place of importance
second only to that of English, and
even in territory within the jurisdic
tion of the United States a knowledge
of Spanish is of considerable impor
tane. In most of the other republics
the study of English has become com
pulsory in the public schools during
the last decade. We must take par
ticular care to see that the study of
Spanish, if not made compulsory, is
at least made possible in all second
ary schools. Improvement of our rela
tions with other countries of the con
tinent will require a far wider knowl
edge of their economic conditions,
their institutions, and their culture
than we now possess, and the gateway
to any such knowledge is the correct
use of the languages. The building up
of a sound and enduring commercial
policy with respect to Latin America
will be dependent upon the existence
of a growing number of men and wo
men trained in Spanish and Portu
guese; and, consequently, every high
school should offer courses in Spanish,
while those high schools aiming to pro
vide special training in commercial
subjects should also make available
courses in Portuguese."
Throughout the United States Span
ish should rank as the most important
language other than English and
should hold a foremost place in the j
curricula of the schools of this coun
try. This is the opinion of Dr. Aurelio
M. Espinosa, professor in the Depart
ment of Romanic Languages.
"A general knowledge of Spanish," j
says Dr. Espinosa, "will not only bring I
about a better understanding and.j
therefore, greater commercial effi-1
ciency between North and South
America, but will also help to remove j
the provincial atmosphere of the
United States by broadening the hori
zon of its people.
Commercial Importance
"Spanish in the schools is rapidly
advancing to a position of increased
importance for commercial reasons
which are self-evident in themselves.
The facts sent out by the Department
of Commerce in this regard are over
whelming. The import and export
trade with Spanish-America for 1922
amounted to one and a half billion
dollars."
Our nearest neighbors, who speak a
foreign language, are Spanish, and i
this is the vital reason, from Dr. Es-;
pinosa's point of view, for learning not j
only to read but also to speak and
write Spanish. "The wealth of Spanish
literature, art, traditions, and history,
which is closely linked to our own na
tional culture on account of the early j
development of America, makes the !
study of Spanish of great importance j
to Americans."
English Required in South America
In Chile, Argentina, and other Span
ish-American countries, English is a
required subject, while other languag-!
es are optional in the schools which
correspond to our high schools. Those;
countries, then, realize the value of a j
close relationship between the two ;
continents.
Dr. Espinosa believes that Spanish,
to a large extent, could replace Latin,
since the main claim for that language
is that it contains the roots of many j
English words, and these same ele
ments are found intact in Spanish.
American Trained Teachers
A movement for American teachers
of Spanish and better-trained teachers
is being developed by the American
Association of Teachers of Spanish, 1
which was created five years ago with
Dr. Espinosa as one of its founders.
Spain is interested in bettering the i
