# POWER OF POLLS WILL DETERMINE RULERS OF CARNIVAL MASQUE
## 
### 
"Vive le roi." "Long live the queen."
"Down with democracy and up with
royalty."
Them will be the sentiments and ex
pressions of the one thousand couples
who will attend the Carnival Masque
in the Pavilion on May 4.
But why such sentiments? It's a se
cret, so listen carefully. The world is
to see a new king and queen coron
ated, different from the European po
tentates in that they will rule by the
wish of the people and not by divine
right. In fact the campus community
will select its own king and queen
next week.
A list of candidates will be arranged
for publication Friday and a selection
of the rulers will be made next week.
The Mardi Gras will open with a
Grand March, followed by an impres
sive coronation ceremony.
Dancing to F6llow Formalities
After the formalities of the opening
parade, the costumed couples will find
expression for their Carnival feelings
to the tune of a special orchestra, also
costumed and sufficient for the desires
of any Lotus-seeker. In the middle of
the evening there will be a lull, then
increased interest as a second Grand
March proceeds. During its progress
the prize-winning costumes will be se
lected by critical judges. From the
maize of masqued figures will be
chosen the most stunningly-arrayed
couple. The announcement will be
made from the center of the floor, a
cheer given for the winners, and the
prize awarded.
A few more dances, a feature dance
and song, a skit of unknown worth,
and a few other surprises for the danc
ers will complete the program of the
Carnival Masque. In one night it is
expected there will be crowded more
keen interest and intense excitement
than in the three days of Carnival
heretofore engaged in.
Nominations Start Tomorrow
Nominations for royal candidates
will be received tomorrow, communi
cations to be dropped in the box on the

the largest number of times.
All students are eligible. The blank
in the Daily counts for 100 votes.

ordered from representatives of the
Deßecat Company of San Francisco

the prize-winning costumes will be se
lected by critical judges. From the
maize of masqued figures will be
chosen the most stunningly-arrayed
couple. The announcement will be
made from the center of the floor, a
cheer given for the winners, and the
prize awarded.
A few more dances, a feature dance
and song, a skit of unknown worth,
and a few other surprises for the danc
ers will complete the program of the
Carnival Masque. In one night it is
expected there will be crowded more
keen interest and intense excitement
than in the three days of Carnival
heretofore engaged in.
Nominations Start Tomorrow
Nominations for royal candidates
will be received tomorrow, communi
cations to be dropped in the box on the
Quad near the Romanic Languages
building. A nomination blank will be
found on another page of today's issue
of the Daily Palo Alto. Fill this out
with the name of your choice for both
"Rex" and "Regina," and hand it in
at once. A list of the nominations will
be made up of those names appearing
the largest number of times.
All students are eligible. The blank
in the Daily counts for 100 votes.
Costumes for the Masque can be
ordered from representatives of the
Deßecat Company of San Francisco
who are in the Women's Clubhouse
from 1 to 2 and from 7 to 8 every
afternoon. All .orders taken before
Saturday will arrive here Monday or
Tuesday, thus allowing sufficient time

sary. Men will not furnish their part
ners' costumes.
Tickets for the Carnival Masque will
go on sale Friday.
"Vive le roi." "Long live the queen."
"Down with democracy and up with
royalty."
Them will be the sentiments and ex
pressions of the one thousand couples
who will attend the Carnival Masque
in the Pavilion on May 4.
But why such sentiments? It's a se
cret, so listen carefully. The world is
to see a new king and queen coron
ated, different from the European po
tentates in that they will rule by the
wish of the people and not by divine
right. In fact the campus community
will select its own king and queen
next week.
A list of candidates will be arranged
for publication Friday and a selection
of the rulers will be made next week.
The Mardi Gras will open with a
Grand March, followed by an impres
sive coronation ceremony.
Dancing to F6llow Formalities
After the formalities of the opening
parade, the costumed couples will find
expression for their Carnival feelings
to the tune of a special orchestra, also
costumed and sufficient for the desires
of any Lotus-seeker. In the middle of
the evening there will be a lull, then
increased interest as a second Grand
March proceeds. During its progress
the prize-winning costumes will be se
lected by critical judges. From the
maize of masqued figures will be
chosen the most stunningly-arrayed
couple. The announcement will be
made from the center of the floor, a
