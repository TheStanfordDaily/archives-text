# POWER OF POLLS WILL DETERMINE RULERS OF CARNIVAL MASQUE
## 
### 
"Vive le roi." "Long live the queen."
"Down with democracy and up with
royalty."
Them will be the sentiments and ex
pressions of the one thousand couples
who will attend the Carnival Masque
in the Pavilion on May 4.
But why such sentiments? It's a se
cret, so listen carefully. The world is
to see a new king and queen coron
ated, different from the European po
tentates in that they will rule by the
wish of the people and not by divine
right. In fact the campus community
will select its own king and queen
next week.
A list of candidates will be arranged
for publication Friday and a selection
of the rulers will be made next week.
The Mardi Gras will open with a
Grand March, followed by an impres
sive coronation ceremony.
Dancing to F6llow Formalities
After the formalities of the opening
parade, the costumed couples will find
expression for their Carnival feelings
to the tune of a special orchestra, also
costumed and sufficient for the desires
of any Lotus-seeker. In the middle of
the evening there will be a lull, then
increased interest as a second Grand
March proceeds. During its progress
the prize-winning costumes will be se
lected by critical judges. From the
maize of masqued figures will be
chosen the most stunningly-arrayed
couple. The announcement will be
made from the center of the floor, a
cheer given for the winners, and the
prize awarded.
A few more dances, a feature dance
and song, a skit of unknown worth,
