# D.U. BASEBALL NINE BEATS EL CAPITAN BY SCORE OF 14-5
## Delta Upsilon Takes Lead in League 6; Phi Kaps, Sigma Chi, and Betas Take Games 
### 
Delta Upsilon won the third straight
baseball game yesterday when they took
El Capitan into camp by the score of
14 to 5. Other intramural games played
yesterday were: Beta Theta Pi 4, Alpha
Tau Omega 3; Phi Kappa Sigma 10,
Theta Chi 9; Sigma Chi 11, El Tigre 6.
The D. U. team started their game off
with a bang, scoring six rns in the first
inning, or more than EI Capitan scored
during the rest of the game. Boles start
ed the game in the box for the D. U.
nine and pitched three innings, during
which the El Capitan sluggers were able
to garner live runs. Hyland replaced
Boles and pitched air-tight ball during
the remainder of the game, allowing no
El Capitan man to get past first.
The D. U. batters seemed to have little
difficulty in hitting everything the El
Capitan heavers could offer. Mcßoberts
made the longest hit of the day, but was
only able to get to third on it.
The Betas turned down the A. T. O's
by the score of 4 to 3 in a game which
was not so well played as the score
would indicate. Alabaster and Ree did
the twirling for the winners, while Tay
lor and Edwards formed the battery for
the A. T. O. nine.
The A. T. O's made three runs in the
second, while Taylor kept the Beta hits
scattered the first five innings, so that
his team was able to maintain its lead.
In the fifth, aided by errors, the Betas
was able to push enough runs across to
win the contest. Graves did the best hit
ting for the A. T. O. players.
Phi Kappa Sigma and Theta Chi
played a good game, in which batting
rallies were frequent and fruitful. Theta
