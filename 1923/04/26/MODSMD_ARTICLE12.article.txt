# KEATON COMEDY IS SECURED FOR PROGRAM
## TRACK FILMS SECURED Cartoons, News of Day, Are On Ten-Reel Program 
### 
Exclusive moving pictures of the
Stanford-California Track Meet,
taken by the 1924 Quad staff pho
tographer, will be given their first
showing next Saturday at the "Stu
dent Movies" in the Assembly hall.
Between two and three hundred
feet of film, through co-operation
with the manager of the Quad, will
be ready to screen Saturday night.

Fast moving farcical humor flashes all
through "Neighbors," the Buster Keaton
comedy, which will be shown in the As
sembly hall Saturday at 7:15 as a part
of the student movie program.
In the this latest of his laughtivities,
Buster centers his career of jovial

trouble about the
rough and tumble
belligerence of two
families, whose ad
joining backyards
form a sort of no
man's land of con
stant irritation. In
his efforts to win
the girl of his love,
both families have
an active and ag
gressive time, and
Buster is put to

many acrobatic absurdities before the
wedding day arrives. But just when
everything seems about to be settled hap
pily, the family fracas flares forth gaily
and the lovers find that trying to get mar
ried is just as exciting as trying to live
peacefully with peace-hating neighbors.
Besides Buster Keaton, Viola Dana
will appear on the program in "Crino
line and Romance," in which she takes
the part of a demure Southern belle. It
has been said that in this story Miss
Dana proves that styles in love-making
never change, and that she, as a quaint
Southern Belle, applies old-fashioned
ideas to modern methods.
To complete the program a Felix Kat
Kartoon Komedy and a brand new reel
of newsettes have been procured by the
committee in charge. The newsettes will
be shown here ahead of San Francisco.
They will be taken off the transconti
nental limited and arrive in Palo Alto
by express just before the show.
The committee in charge has reduced
the admission charge to 20 cents, and it
will take an attendance of at least 600
to make the pictures pay for themselves.
Any profit which is made on the show
will be turned over to the endowment
fund. The two movies which were put
on last quarter netted $90.
Following the program in the Assem
bly hall, Scalpers Society is offering a
"hard-times' dance in the Women's Club
house. Admission will be $1. for cou
ples appearing in campus garb, but it is
reported that a heavy tax will be im
posed on good clothes.

ried is just as exciting as trying to live
peacefully with peace-hating neighbors.
Besides Buster Keaton, Viola Dana
will appear on the program in "Crino
line and Romance," in which she takes
the part of a demure Southern belle. It
has been said that in this story Miss
Dana proves that styles in love-making
never change, and that she, as a quaint
Southern Belle, applies old-fashioned
ideas to modern methods.
To complete the program a Felix Kat
Kartoon Komedy and a brand new reel
of newsettes have been procured by the
committee in charge. The newsettes will
be shown here ahead of San Francisco.
They will be taken off the transconti
nental limited and arrive in Palo Alto
by express just before the show.
The committee in charge has reduced
the admission charge to 20 cents, and it
will take an attendance of at least 600
to make the pictures pay for themselves.
Any profit which is made on the show
will be turned over to the endowment
fund. The two movies which were put
on last quarter netted $90.
Following the program in the Assem
bly hall, Scalpers Society is offering a
"hard-times' dance in the Women's Club
house. Admission will be $1. for cou
ples appearing in campus garb, but it is
reported that a heavy tax will be im
posed on good clothes.

Exclusive moving pictures of the
Stanford-California Track Meet,
taken by the 1924 Quad staff pho
tographer, will be given their first
showing next Saturday at the "Stu
dent Movies" in the Assembly hall.
Between two and three hundred
feet of film, through co-operation
with the manager of the Quad, will
be ready to screen Saturday night.

Fast moving farcical humor flashes all
through "Neighbors," the Buster Keaton
comedy, which will be shown in the As
sembly hall Saturday at 7:15 as a part
of the student movie program.
In the this latest of his laughtivities,
Buster centers his career of jovial

trouble about the
rough and tumble
belligerence of two
families, whose ad
joining backyards
form a sort of no
man's land of con
stant irritation. In
his efforts to win
the girl of his love,
both families have
an active and ag
gressive time, and
Buster is put to

many acrobatic absurdities before the
wedding day arrives. But just when
everything seems about to be settled hap
pily, the family fracas flares forth gaily
and the lovers find that trying to get mar
ried is just as exciting as trying to live
peacefully with peace-hating neighbors.
