With an eye for the unusual, Chap
pie has ferreted out an establishment
in the city that has revived a lost art
—that of making wood-cuts. By a pro
cess that involves a high degree of
craftsmanship impression plates for
illustrations are made of wood in
stead of zinc or copper, and the fin
ished reproduction as it appears in
the magazine has qualities which it is
impossible to obtain by the ordinary
engraving processes. The forthcoming
ißsue of Chaparral in celebration of
Junior Week will exhibit a wood-cut
cover in brilliant colors.
