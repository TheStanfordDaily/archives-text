# SECOND FIRE UNIT IS INSTALLED ON STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
In two weeks Stanford University
will have fire protection equal to, if
not better, than any other university
in the United States, said Fire Mar
shal Lamb.
In addition to the fire house adjoin
ing the corporation yards on Santa
Theresa Btreet, a new fire unit has
been organized under the direction of
Comptroller A. E. Roth. The Cadillac
hose wagon, equipped with 750 feet of
hose, and the double 30 straight chem
ical Ford truck equipped with four
six-gallon fire extinguishers, have been
housed in the gun sheds near the R.
O. T. C. headquarters. This equipment
formerly constituted the Stanford fire
department. Major Collins has detailed
a sergeant and eight men to man the
wagon and chemical engine. This unit
will have charge of the territory about
the "Quad" and the flat. The Ford
chemical engine will be used for grass
fires and as "spark chaser" at the
large fires.
The main fire station will house the
big Seagrave thousand-gallon, fully
equipped Metropolitan standard pump
engine, and a new six-ton, double one
hundred-gallon straight chemical en
gine which has four 50-gallon chemical
tanks. This engine is one of the largest
on the Pacific coast. â€¢
The personnel of the Campus fire
department now consists of a fire mar
shal, a chief, and twenty men.
As soon as the new gasoline station,
which is to be placed near the corpora
tion yards, is complete, a small fire
house will be constructed by military
headquarters for the new unit.
