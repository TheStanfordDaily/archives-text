# BABE TRACKSTERS MEET SOPHOMORE STARS TOMORROW
## Boles and Leistner Will Compete in Hurdles; Kerr Expected to Capture Mile 
### 
What promises to be one of the most
hotly-contested track meets held this
year will be staged on the Cardinal oval
tomorrow afternoon at 4 oclock, when
the freshman and sophomore track
teams clash in a post-season meet.
Every freshman and every sophomore,
varsity or otherwise, is eligible to com
pete, and for this reason there should
be races in the coursc of the afternoon,
which will be equal in caliber to those
of the Big Meet.
In the husdles both Boles and Leist
ner are entered. Both seem to be capa
ble of 15 1-5. Boles also claims records
for the freshman classic.
How prospective varsity material will
stack up for next year will be seen
when Bill Kerr and A1 Charles clash in
four rounds of the oval.
The main purpose of the meet, how
ever, according to "Dink" Templeton, is
to find new material, which might have
been dormant throughout the season,
and for this reason everyone who be
lieves he is capable of making a show
ing in any event is urged to don the
abbreviated trousers and try for a place.
In a way, this will take the place of
the annual baseball fight, only the fight
ing will be done running away from eact\
other. Freshmen and sophomores are
expected to fill the bleachers and vie
with one another in a test for lung ca
pacity.
