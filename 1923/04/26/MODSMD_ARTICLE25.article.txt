The Hoard of Athletic Control has been the sub
ject of much criticism from students, alumni, and
that part of the public interested in colelge affairs,
for diverting funds received from athletic contests
to other purposes. Those who point to such action
as another indication of the commercialism of sports
by university administrators have many reasonable
arguments to support their claims.
The University of California is facing the same
problem in financing some of its recent construction
and the following extract from the balance sheet in
athletic accounts from the California Monthly is of
interest locally as an indication of how the situa
tion is being met by others:
"It must first be remembered that during the past
year the Associated Students have assumed two
•tremendous financial burdens: first, the building and
furnishing of Stephens Union, and second, the con
struction of the California Memorial Stadium in
•Strawberry Canyon. For the Stephens Union alone,
$169,712 have been expended to date, or assumed in
obligations. These obligations must be met by the
student body and its activities alone.
"With respect to the Stadium, while it is true that
a large portion of the necessary funds were gath
ered together through outside subscriptions, there is
a large student quota, secured on a partial payment
plan. The unpaid installments on student subscrip
tions must be carried by the student body. Indeed,
to speak of subscriptions at all is somewhat mis
leading, since eventually the Stadium will be paid
for entirely out of the gate receipts from athletic
contests.
"Consider again, then, the $150,000 which repre
sents football profits for the past year. From this
sum, $63,650 must immediately be deducted, since
that sum represents the redeemed Stadium script
for the 1922 season. The net gain from football,
then, was something like $87,000.
"There remain's another factor to be considered.
This is, that football must contribute to the support
not only of all general lines of student activity and
endeavor but also to most of the other sports.
Basketball and track, for instance, consider it a
satisfactory season when they break even. And/
crew, tennis, and minor sports suffer notable losses,
which must be covered by the football surplus. Last
year, crew showed a deficit of $4,000, and track, a
debit balance close to $3,000.
"When these factors are considered, there is no
longer room for criticism of the cost of admission
to football games. On the other hand, it becomes
a matter of surprise that so much can be accom
plished with such inadequate funds.
"General Manager Luther Nichols states, more
over, that even though the students in general
recognize the necessity for the present method of
obtaining revenue for student activities, it is reason
able to suppose that in the future, when some of
the heavy financial obligations now confronting the
students have been removed, the university will take
steps to reduce admission charges to athletic con
tests."

"It must first be remembered that during the past
year the Associated Students have assumed two
•tremendous financial burdens: first, the building and
furnishing of Stephens Union, and second, the con
struction of the California Memorial Stadium in
•Strawberry Canyon. For the Stephens Union alone,
$169,712 have been expended to date, or assumed in
obligations. These obligations must be met by the
student body and its activities alone.
"With respect to the Stadium, while it is true that
a large portion of the necessary funds were gath
ered together through outside subscriptions, there is
a large student quota, secured on a partial payment
plan. The unpaid installments on student subscrip
tions must be carried by the student body. Indeed,
to speak of subscriptions at all is somewhat mis
leading, since eventually the Stadium will be paid
for entirely out of the gate receipts from athletic
contests.
"Consider again, then, the $150,000 which repre
sents football profits for the past year. From this
sum, $63,650 must immediately be deducted, since
that sum represents the redeemed Stadium script
for the 1922 season. The net gain from football,
then, was something like $87,000.
"There remain's another factor to be considered.
This is, that football must contribute to the support
not only of all general lines of student activity and
endeavor but also to most of the other sports.
Basketball and track, for instance, consider it a
satisfactory season when they break even. And/
crew, tennis, and minor sports suffer notable losses,
which must be covered by the football surplus. Last
year, crew showed a deficit of $4,000, and track, a
debit balance close to $3,000.
"When these factors are considered, there is no
longer room for criticism of the cost of admission
to football games. On the other hand, it becomes
a matter of surprise that so much can be accom
plished with such inadequate funds.
"General Manager Luther Nichols states, more
over, that even though the students in general
recognize the necessity for the present method of
obtaining revenue for student activities, it is reason
able to suppose that in the future, when some of
the heavy financial obligations now confronting the
students have been removed, the university will take
steps to reduce admission charges to athletic con
tests."
The Hoard of Athletic Control has been the sub
ject of much criticism from students, alumni, and
that part of the public interested in colelge affairs,
for diverting funds received from athletic contests
to other purposes. Those who point to such action
as another indication of the commercialism of sports
by university administrators have many reasonable
arguments to support their claims.
