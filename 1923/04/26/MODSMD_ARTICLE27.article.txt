NICOTINE NUMBER

Tobacco is a filthy weed —
I like it.
It satisfies no mortal need —
I like it.
Cheroots, perfectoes, plugs, and snipes.
Stogies, "roll-your-owns" and pipes
Are bad for me, but hully eripes!
I like it!

The dread step is taken. No more will Lady Nicotine
have us bound and gagged. Those brown stains on our
fingertips must disappear.
We've sworn off smoking.
Ys, we did it of our own free will.
And besides, the landlady just hung up some new
cretonne curtains.

Now, don't offer us a cigar.
Smoking causes insomnia. We can steep all right at
night—but during the daytime we can't get a wink.
.* * •
We just gave our sweetest pipe to Luke the linotyper.
He looks like a man who would treat it kindly.
* * •
When we smoke a pipe to save money, it always turns
out that we compensate by using more matches.
• • *
Cigar bands were invented to hold the cigar together
until it was sold.
• • •
Last night I dreamed that the gas was leaking.
Ah, a pipe dream!
• » •
Many a poor car has been sold by having a good
cigar-lighter on the dashboard.
• • •
What do you think of these Egyptian excavations?
Dunno —I never smoked any.
$ 41
Observe Mustapha Murad, the Turkish atrocity, on a
walking tour. He stops not at the first milestone to
accept the proffered Camel. Cork No. 9s or nothing for
him.
* » *
The woodsman who said dried willow bark was as
good as tobacco is a liar. It won't make any more of a
smudge than a Y. M. C. A. smoker.
Our tobacco-pouch is still in the bottom drawer. No —
no —behind us, Satan! —110-0-0-0 —YES!

Where in thunder is that linotyper.
• * *
FROSH! MATCH!!

Nick —Better wear your cap, it's raining.
Nack —Huh! Think I want to get my cap wet?
• • *
For an hour he'd ranted and raved
Of society's habits depraved.
A unanimous snore
Shook walls, rafters, and floor.
At last the bell rings; "we are ,saved."

For an hour he'd ranted and raved
Of society's habits depraved.
A unanimous snore
Shook walls, rafters, and floor.

NICOTINE NUMBER

Tobacco is a filthy weed —
I like it.
It satisfies no mortal need —
I like it.
Cheroots, perfectoes, plugs, and snipes.
Stogies, "roll-your-owns" and pipes
Are bad for me, but hully eripes!
I like it!

The dread step is taken. No more will Lady Nicotine
have us bound and gagged. Those brown stains on our
fingertips must disappear.
We've sworn off smoking.
Ys, we did it of our own free will.
And besides, the landlady just hung up some new
cretonne curtains.

Observe Mustapha Murad, the Turkish atrocity, on a
walking tour. He stops not at the first milestone to
accept the proffered Camel. Cork No. 9s or nothing for
him.

The woodsman who said dried willow bark was as
good as tobacco is a liar. It won't make any more of a
smudge than a Y. M. C. A. smoker.
Our tobacco-pouch is still in the bottom drawer. No —
