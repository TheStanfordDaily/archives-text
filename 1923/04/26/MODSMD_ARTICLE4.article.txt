# DR. JORDAN TO SPEAK TONIGHT ON LOCAL HISTORY, TRADITIONS
## 
### 
"Stanford History and Ideals'* will
be the subject of a talk by Dr. Jor
dan, to be given at 7:30 tonight in
the Assembly hall. The talk, which is
under the auspices of the University
Y. M. C. A., is given especially for
freshmen and new students.
The story of the early days at Stan
ford is as interesting as a novel, and
no one has a better first-hand ac
quaintance with the facts than Dr.
Jordan.
