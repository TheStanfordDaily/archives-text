# FOOTBALL FOR WOMEN? MISS BUNTING SAYS "NO"

"Football for women? Not at Stan
ford as long as I am head of the Phys
ical Education department," said Miss
Helen Masters Bunting when ques
tioned about the college woman's fu
ture on the athletic field.
She does not believe that football
will ever be played by college women
because of the nature of the game.
"Athletic competition between men
and women has been attempted in
several small schools but has not met
with much success. I myself do not
approve of it. Men are naturally
stronger than women and I see no
possible way of making such contests
equal if they were brought about."
Miss Bunting returned last week
from an athletic conference in the
East at which rules for college wo
men's athletics were planned.
"The rules of the Athletic Confer
ence of American College Women gov
ern athletic activities of college wo
men," said Miss Bunting. "Recently a
law was passed prohibiting varsity
competition as' it is generally recog

nized that such competition permits
the development of only a few women
at the expense of the rest who do not
receive the benefits of physical educa
tion.
"This rule will also do away with
the possibility of commercializing of
women's athletics. We do not want
women's activities to reach the same
development as that of college men in
athletics. It seems queer to consider
such a possibility at the present time,
but when we think of the strides
taken along these lines in the past
twenty years it makes us wonder what
the next twenty years will bring
about."
"Track is one of the comparatively
recent athletic developments for col
lege women," continued Miss Bunting.
"If California and Mills take it up we
will probably have interclass contests
between those colleges as we now have
in other athletic events. The national
conference will publish books regard
ing the weights to be used in the shot
put and all other rules concerning the
contests."
