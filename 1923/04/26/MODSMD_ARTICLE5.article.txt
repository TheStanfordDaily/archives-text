# KIMBER FELLOWSHIP DRIVE TO START ON CAMPUS WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford fund to send a Stan
ford student to some French univer
sity every year, known as the Arthur
Kimber fellowship, has already accu
mulated nearly a thousand dollars, al
though the students will not be given
an opportunity to contribute until
Wednesday.
Mrs. Clara Kimber of Palo Alto,
mother of Arthur Kimber, ex-'lB, in
whose memory this fellowship will be
endowed, has asked the privilege of
contributing the first $100 to the fund.
In addition the Friends of France, the
organization which financed the first
ambulance units that went overseas
from Stanford and the University of
California has $1200 that was left in
ita treasury after its work was com
pleted, and William B. Bourn, the
Stanford trustees who was from the
beginning president of that organiza
tion, has announced that this sum will
be divided between the two universi
ties towards the fellowships which
they are establishing. This will bring
$600 to the Arthur Kimber fellowship.
Furthermore, the members of the first
Stanford unit have in the treasury of
their own organization $275 which
they will contribute to the Kimber
fellowship.
There is no expectation that the
Stanford student body this year will
subscribe the whole $25,000 required
but there is confidence that if the stu
dents themselves show a substantial
interest in the enterprise many out
side the student body will be dis
posed to help swell the fund quickly
to its completion.
Similarly Stanford students, in re
sponse to the appeal for the support
of the Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus, are not being
asked to contribute more than a com
paratively small proportion of the
funds required to carry on this special
Stanford charity, in fact, although it
costs between five and six thousand
dollars a year to meet the expenses
of the home, no appeal has ever before
been made to the Stanford students to
contribute to the maintenance fund.
Stanford students, both as a body
in the annual Labor Day and as indi
viduals in contributing their time have
helped to carry on the work of the
home and reduce expenses that would
otherwise arise. The support and rais
ing of the great proportion of current
expenses, as well as the creation of a
permanent endowment, has been car
ried on by others than students.
