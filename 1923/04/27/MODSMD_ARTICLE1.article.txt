# PICTURES OF BIG MEET TO BE SHOWN ON MOVIE PROGRAM
## Viola Dana, Buster Keaton, Newsettes, Cartoons, Are Other Attractions 
### 
Exclusive moving pictures of the
Stanford-California Track Meet will be
shown in the Assembly hall tomorrow
evening at 7:15 as a part of the stu
dent movie program. The pictures
were taken with a private camera
loaned the 1924 Quad photographer,
and the negative is being rushed
through the development process so
that the first print may be shown here
tomorrow. A well-known campus man
will call out the various Cardinal track
stars as they appear on the screen,
noting the time made in each event as
it is shown.
Ten reels of up-to-date moving pic
tures have been provided by the com
mittee in charge. Admission has been
reduced to twenty cents and any
profit that is made on the enterprise
will be turned over to the endowment
fund.
Viola Dana in "Crinoline and Ro
mance" and Buster Keaton in "Neigh
bors" form the piece de resistance of
the program with a Felix Kat Kartoon
Komedy and a reel of Newsettes to
111 in.
In "Crinoline and Romance" Miss
Dana takes the part of a young girl
who is determined to escape from the
rigidity of her surroundings. She visits
the home of her aunt, and there tastes
modern "social" life.
Buster Keaton in "Neighbors" cen
ters his laugh-making activities about
two back yards, which form a source
of constant irritation between un
neighborly neighbors.
This is the third student movie pro
gram which has been offered this
year. The past two performances were
well attended and netted the endow
ment fund $95.
Scalpers Society is giving a "hard
times" party in the Women's Club
house immediately after the movie
program. Admission will be $1.
