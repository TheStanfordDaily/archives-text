# CARDS MEET WINGED "O" NINE TOMORROW
## Varsity Will Make Barnstorming Trip To Arizona In May. 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base-
I
bailers will oppose the Olympic Club
for the second time this season to- j
morrow afternoon at 3:30 on the var
sity diamond. This will be the last
game played at home for two weeks, j
as the team leaves for Arizona and'
I
way stations next Friday, May 4.
The precise schedule for the trip
will not be made up until next week,'
but the first game will be played at
Bakersfield on Saturday, May 5. From
there the Cardinal nine will gradually
barnstorm its way to Arizona and
back, returning to the campus about
May 12. It is not yet known how many
men will be taken.
Judging from the first Olympic
game early this season, tomorrow's
contest should draw a capacity crowd, j
During this game the Cards lagged
until almost too late, but in the final
inning the Olympics put on a little
circus all their own and handed
Peavy's crew the game on a golden |
tray. The tough part of it was that
most of the witnesses had gone home, j
and nobody saw the finish except the
members of the teams and the mana-1

gerial tryoutees. The Winged 'O' will
probably bring about the same bunch
down this time, and the Redshirts
have improved enough to beat them
more definitely.
The Stanford line-up is uncertain,
j with Captain-Elect Patterson, Wood
ward, and Heckendorf in their usual
role as sure things. Mulchay's ankle,
which was injured just in time to pre
vent a second score against California
last Saturday, has not yet come back
into condition, and it is almost certain
that Captain Peavy will pastime at
second with "Shorty" Roberts doing
the short-stopping. The California
series left the outfield jobs a toss-up
among Deffebach, Parker, McCandless,
Carver, Dick Lawson, and "Lefty"
May, and the game may start with any
combination of these six.
Teague, Solomon, and Clark will be
available for mound work, as will Low
, enstein if Coach Wolter considers him
sufficiently recovered from his illness.
The squad is practicing three times
a week, with especial attention to the
men who will return next year. The
Quad photograph will be taken Mon
! day.

combination of these six.
Teague, Solomon, and Clark will be
available for mound work, as will Low

sufficiently recovered from his illness.

Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base-
I
bailers will oppose the Olympic Club
for the second time this season to- j
morrow afternoon at 3:30 on the var
sity diamond. This will be the last
game played at home for two weeks, j
as the team leaves for Arizona and'
I
way stations next Friday, May 4.
The precise schedule for the trip
will not be made up until next week,'
but the first game will be played at
Bakersfield on Saturday, May 5. From
there the Cardinal nine will gradually
barnstorm its way to Arizona and
back, returning to the campus about
May 12. It is not yet known how many
men will be taken.
Judging from the first Olympic
game early this season, tomorrow's
contest should draw a capacity crowd, j
During this game the Cards lagged
until almost too late, but in the final
inning the Olympics put on a little
circus all their own and handed
Peavy's crew the game on a golden |
tray. The tough part of it was that
most of the witnesses had gone home, j
and nobody saw the finish except the
members of the teams and the mana-1

gerial tryoutees. The Winged 'O' will
probably bring about the same bunch
down this time, and the Redshirts
have improved enough to beat them
more definitely.
The Stanford line-up is uncertain,
j with Captain-Elect Patterson, Wood
ward, and Heckendorf in their usual
role as sure things. Mulchay's ankle,
which was injured just in time to pre
vent a second score against California
last Saturday, has not yet come back
into condition, and it is almost certain
that Captain Peavy will pastime at
second with "Shorty" Roberts doing
the short-stopping. The California
series left the outfield jobs a toss-up
among Deffebach, Parker, McCandless,
Carver, Dick Lawson, and "Lefty"
May, and the game may start with any
combination of these six.
