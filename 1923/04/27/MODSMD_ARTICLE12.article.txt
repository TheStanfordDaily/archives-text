# NELSON VAN JUDAH ELECTED CAPTAIN OF 1924 TRACK TEAM
## Falk Presented Aupperle Medal by Teammates; Cards Should Compete in Chicago Meet. 
### Don Liebendorfer 
Nelson Van Judah, '23, was elected captain of the 1924 varsity track team
when the squad met for a picture last night. Lane Falk, captain of the 1923
team, was given the Aupperle Medal by his teammates for being the most
valuable man on the team this year.
Judah is a quarter-miler and one of the best-liked men on the squad.
Last year, when he was scarcely conceded an outside chance in the Big Meet,
he came from behind in the quarter mile, and eased into third place, beating
out McDonald of California. Again, this year, after being boxed for 350 yards.

he stepped out on the home stretch
and took third place in the Big Meet.
By a sensational sprint in the last lap
of the relay, he came from behind and
broke the tape for the Cards. Judah's
home is in Los Angeles. He is a mem
ber of Delta Upsilon.
Falk Gets Aupperle Medal
The Aupperle inedal which was
awarded to Falk is being given for the
first time this year. It is presented by
A1 Hettinger, formerly a Stanford
track man in honor of "Skin" Aup
perle who was a Cardinal miler before
the war.
Aupperle was killed in the Balkans
during the World War. He was a very
small man and a self-made athlete.
Hettinger, who is now a professor at
Harvard, has dedicated the trophy to
him. It i9 to be presented each year
to the man on the Stanford track
squad who is considered by his team
mates to be the most valuable.
Cards Should Enter National
With the Big Meet out of the way,
it seems only logical that the Cardinal
tracksters should be represented in
one of the eastern meets this year. It
will be practically impossible for a
Stanford team to compete in the
Pacific Coast Conference as it will be
held in the North early in June, just
before final examinations start on the
Farm.
The I. C. A. A. A. A. is almost out
of the question. It is scheduled for
Friday and Saturday, May 2 and 28, at
Philadelphia, and the Stanford squad
is scarcely strong enough to warrant
its entering this meet, which also
comes close to examination time.
N. C. A. A. Logical Meet
There seems to be but one logical
meet for Templeton's squad to take
part in if the Cardinal is to be repre
sented in a national meet. The N. C.
A. A., slated for May 19 at Chicago,
will allow the squad to break training
two weeks after the P. A. A., and there
are several men who would be proba
ble point-winners in the smaller meet.
Black in the pole vault, Judah
and Williamson in the 440, Campbell
in the sprints, Dole in the 880, Elliott
in the mile, Falk and Leistner in the
hurdles, and possibly Hayes in the
two-mile and Arthur in the discus,
would form a combination that should
annex quite a few points. The P. A. A.
at Berkeley May 5 should give the
Stanford cinderpath stars a chance to
even the score with the Bruin squad.
From present indications, both fresh
man and varsity squads will be well
represented.

two-mile and Arthur in the discus,
would form a combination that should
annex quite a few points. The P. A. A.
at Berkeley May 5 should give the
Stanford cinderpath stars a chance to
even the score with the Bruin squad.
From present indications, both fresh
man and varsity squads will be well
represented.
Nelson Van Judah, '23, was elected captain of the 1924 varsity track team
when the squad met for a picture last night. Lane Falk, captain of the 1923
team, was given the Aupperle Medal by his teammates for being the most
valuable man on the team this year.
Judah is a quarter-miler and one of the best-liked men on the squad.
Last year, when he was scarcely conceded an outside chance in the Big Meet,
he came from behind in the quarter mile, and eased into third place, beating
out McDonald of California. Again, this year, after being boxed for 350 yards.

he stepped out on the home stretch
and took third place in the Big Meet.
By a sensational sprint in the last lap
of the relay, he came from behind and
broke the tape for the Cards. Judah's
home is in Los Angeles. He is a mem
ber of Delta Upsilon.
Falk Gets Aupperle Medal
The Aupperle inedal which was
awarded to Falk is being given for the
first time this year. It is presented by
A1 Hettinger, formerly a Stanford
track man in honor of "Skin" Aup
perle who was a Cardinal miler before
the war.
Aupperle was killed in the Balkans
during the World War. He was a very
small man and a self-made athlete.
Hettinger, who is now a professor at
Harvard, has dedicated the trophy to
him. It i9 to be presented each year
to the man on the Stanford track
squad who is considered by his team
mates to be the most valuable.
Cards Should Enter National
With the Big Meet out of the way,
it seems only logical that the Cardinal
tracksters should be represented in
one of the eastern meets this year. It
will be practically impossible for a
Stanford team to compete in the
Pacific Coast Conference as it will be
held in the North early in June, just
before final examinations start on the
Farm.
The I. C. A. A. A. A. is almost out
of the question. It is scheduled for
Friday and Saturday, May 2 and 28, at
Philadelphia, and the Stanford squad
is scarcely strong enough to warrant
its entering this meet, which also
comes close to examination time.
N. C. A. A. Logical Meet
There seems to be but one logical
meet for Templeton's squad to take
part in if the Cardinal is to be repre
sented in a national meet. The N. C.
A. A., slated for May 19 at Chicago,
will allow the squad to break training
two weeks after the P. A. A., and there
are several men who would be proba
ble point-winners in the smaller meet.
Black in the pole vault, Judah
and Williamson in the 440, Campbell
in the sprints, Dole in the 880, Elliott
in the mile, Falk and Leistner in the
hurdles, and possibly Hayes in the
two-mile and Arthur in the discus,
would form a combination that should
annex quite a few points. The P. A. A.

Stanford cinderpath stars a chance to
