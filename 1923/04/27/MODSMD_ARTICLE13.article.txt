"Time is of so little importance in
England that in peace times an or
dinary newspaper man would be ruined
in London," said Ben S. Allen, '#7, In
his talk at the open meeting of the
American Journalists' Association last
evening at 7:15 at the Phi Delta Theta
house.
"The Americans take great advan
tage of the difference in time between
New York and London, and corres
pondents for the New York morning
papers get down for breakfast just in
time to read the London dailies and
get their stories on the wire for their
own publications."
Allen had been sent abroad by the
Associated Press, where he was serv
ing as foreign correspondent in Lon
don at the outbreak of the war in
1914. He came in contact with Herbert
Hoover, who at that time was working
on relief work in Belgium, and as
sisted him with publicity work.
When the Food Administration was
organized, Allen was put in entire
charge of the publicity bureau, and
served in this capacity all through
the war.
From this work Allen became edi
tor and publisher of the Sacramento
Union. He left the Union a year ago
and became interested in private pub
licity work, organizing the California
Shippers Association, which opposed
demerger of the Southern Pacific and
the Central Pacific.
Allen was the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto in 1906.
