six high from Monterey to
Ukiah.
Heats in the track events except mile

at 10 o'clock. There will be several
heats in the 100 and 200-yard dashes,
50 in the former and 43 in the latter
are entered.
The 880. eight-pound shot, discus, pole
vault, and high jump, will start at 2
o'clock. The twelve-pound shot, javelin,

Wilmerding and Santa Cruz.
Admission will be twenty cents.
