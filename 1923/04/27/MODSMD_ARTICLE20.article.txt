# A
						WORTHY SUBSTITUTE

In addition to his work as track coach, "Dink"
Templeton is one of the most valuable men on the
Stanford campus today because of the constructive
thought which he puts into all matters of student and
administrative concern.
Templeton had two purposes in mind in planning
the freshman-sophomore meet this afternoon. One
was to bring out prospective varsity material and
the other was to provide a substitute for the baseball
light which was abolished two years ago when the
enthusiasm of the classes involved carried them
beyond the limits of common sense.
There was much wailing when the spring fight
between the freshmen and sophomores was called
off—another tradition gone by the boards! The
jfights have a certain value—especially the one at the
first of the year—in getting the members of the
classes acquainted and in inculcating an esprit de
corps.
Everyone agreed that the incident in the spring of
1921 which brought out headlines of riot and death
in the San Francisco papers had carried the base
ball fight too far. Many students began immediately
to work out plans whereby the valuable features of
such an affair might be retained. Quadrangle Club,
Skull and Snakes, and Circle S Society were called
upon to devise some sort of competition which would
exclude night fighting and the use of water, in ac
cordance with President Wilbur's proviso.
At least one of these plans has been worked out in
detail and will probably be acted upon by Executive
Committee before the year is over. Among the
suggestions that have been dropped here and there
is one that a suitable fight might be arranged in
volving freshmen only. This, it has been argued,
would do away with ill feeling which might arise
between the classes but would still provide the in
coming men with an opportunity of getting ac
quainted with each other, a barbecue or some such
gathering taking the place of the midnight skir
mishes in the hills. Such a contest, however, might
not have the merit of making a solid unit of the
new men —and this is something toward which
President Wilbur and others interested in the future
of Stanford are going to make an even greater effort
at the beginning of the next college year.
; The whole matter is more or less unsettled at
present, but now, rather than after definite action
has been taken, is the time for those who have criti
cisms or suggestions for any of the proposed
schemes, or any plans of their own, to let them be
known. And meanwhile Coach Templeton has pro
vided a worth-while substitute in the form of com
petition between the two newest classes on the track
and in the field.
