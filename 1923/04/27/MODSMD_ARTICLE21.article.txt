# MYTHICAL BUTTONS
## 
### 
lii this material day of science, reform, etiquette
books, efficiency experts, and tabulators of human
conduct, there is an ever-increasing notion to regard
human beings as die-stamped Rabots, each one sub
ject to the same mechanical laws, all bound to act
in an identical manner with the pressing of appro
priate buttons. The machines will respond in pre
cisely like ways to any stimulus imposed upon them.
Use the same methods in running them all. Com
mon forces govern them. Go right ahead.
Hut that won't work. Human beings are indi
viduals, —not mechanisms that when punched will
always perform alike. One may not go around deal
ing with people by reading how to do it from a book.
A man with the idea that people are all alike will
never get along in his relations with them. He has
no tact. A tactless person goes around like a steam
roller. For a steam-roller has no power of dis
crimination. —C. N. H.
