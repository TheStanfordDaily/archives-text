# FOOTBALL MEN WORK HARD ON NEW PLAYS FOR NEXT SEASON
## "Pop" Warner Gives Five Teams Practice in Tackling; Plenty of Scrimmage on Program. 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
"Tuck the ball under your arm as soon as you get it, start around the end,
and then cut it short," directed Coach "Pop" Warner, as his players lined up
for the next play.
"Signals: 28-46-37-83—3-5-9-4-7."
And Guy Dennis, halfback on one of Warner's five elevens now practicing
daily on the old football field, gripped the pigskin firmly in both hands, started
his end run and then cut in short, as directed.
"Good, fine," was the encouraging remark of the coach as the play was
completed. "That's the way to go. Fake the end run and then dodge inside of
the tackle for a substantial gain." Thus "Pop" went from one team to another,
giving a suggestion here, criticizing there, and directing a play somewhere else.

Men Have Plenty to Do
The men who are on the field are
working hard, each man striving to
make the best impression possible and
attempting to keep his rank on the
"first" team. Each day "Pop" takes a
different bunch of men but with "Tiny"
Thornhill, Andy Keir, "Husky" Hunt,
and Trainer Denny on the job no one
is idle.
The first thing on the daily program
is to practice falling on the ball and
some passing and kicking before the
men and coaches all get ready for
real work. Then the teams line up and,
with a coach to each, they start down
the field, working one play after an
other. After forty-five minutes of this,
all but two teams leave the playing
field and scrimmage starts. Warner di
rects all the plays and the other
coaches attempt to brace the team on
the defensive to meet his attack.'
Twenty minutes of this strenuous
exercise is usually enough. Then
comes the tackling dummy and prac
tice in blocking.
Baker Shows Well at Center
In these daily scrimmages, a good
many players are given an opportunity
to "show their stuff" and new men are
forcing the old-timers to the limit to •
keep their places. Baker is showing
np well at center but Hunt and Van
Hook are fighting hard for places at
the same berth. Cravens and Faville
are the best guards on the field but a
number of new men, among them
some from the freshman team, are
giving a good account of themselves.
Ludeke and Shipkey fill the tackle
positions with Middleton and Thomas
taking the wings. At quarter is Camp
bell, and Dennis plays at halfback.
The largest hole is at the fullback
position. At present Nevers has the
edge on the other players trying for
the place, but Hey and Kelley are both
pushing him hard. Woodward and
Stratton are working together for the 1
other halfback position.
Scrimmage will be held every day
next week, the final session of spring
practice to be held a week from today.
At that time, "Pop" will relinquish the
reins for another season and entrust
the care of the 1924 Stanford varsity
to Coaches Andy Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill.
"But I will be back again next
spring," said Warner yesterday,"and
I will be here to stay then."
