# JUNIOR PROM 10 USE RAINBOW DECORATIONS
## 
### 
Violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow,
orange, redâ€”rainbow colors will form
the decorative scheme of the 1924 Junior
Prom, according to "Nip" McHose, '24,
Prom chairman.
The rainbow theme will be carried
out by means of a vari-colored ceil
ing, shading through the seven rain
bow tints. Lattice work covering the
side-walls of the Pavilion will further
follow out the color scheme.
Lighting effects will be particularly ef
fective, according to McHose. Details
are being kept secret by the committee,
but the general plan will follow an indi
rect lighting arrangement, which has not
been used before in the Pavilion.
Phennig's eight-piece orchestra from
the University of California has been
engaged to furnish the music for dancing.
Tickets for the Prom will be put on
sale in about a week, according to
McHose. The price is $5. Programs
will be given out the Monday before the
dance.
The committee in charge of the Prom
is as follows: "Nip" McHose, chairman;
Burt Lapp, programs; Orville Tucker,
construction; Sid Laughlin, decorations;
Eunice Biddle, chaperones; John Plimp
ton, catering; Lewis Alabaster, Alice
Roth, Theiline McGee, and C. G. Craw
ford, electrician.
