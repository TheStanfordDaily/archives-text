the additional charge of $110 to the
original charge of $895.
Places will be reserved upon appli

Company will give instructions re

will assist in obtaining the necessary

Programs have been arranged for
each city, and some time will also be
left, free for rest, shopping, or other
plans. Special features of the seventy
two-day trip are the Riviera and the
Grand Corniche Road, the Amalfi
Drive, Lake Maggiore, and the Isle of
Marken.
Mr. Sellars says,"I have so planned
| this itinerary that it includes beauti
ful scenery as well as historic cities,
| all to be visited at the most favorable
J season of the year. A summer tour in
Europe means an opportunity to see
i the art treasures, the monuments of
architecture, to come into contact with
the civilization of the old world, and
a carefully-planned vacation abroad of
fers infinite possibilities for pleasure
as well as educational advantages."
