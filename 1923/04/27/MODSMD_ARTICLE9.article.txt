# RACE BEGINS FOR ROYAL HONORS AT CARNIVAL MASQUE
## Van Judah and Mendenhall, Helen Whitney and Grace Darling Are Leading 
### 
The royal race is on! And civil war
threatens —judging by the number of
contestants for the throne at the Car
nival Masque a week from tonight.
Athletes and Thespians, so far, seem
to have the voting edge but it's a wise
man who refrains from making pre
dictions.
Nelson Van Judah and Sam Menden
hall are leading in the race for kingly
honors with Dud DeGroot, Lane
Falk and Dave Mannoccir in the run
ning. Helen Whitney received the
greatest number of nominations for
queen, with Grace Darling a close sec
ond. Alice Roth, Dorothy Sudden, Vio
let Andrews, and Frances Sheldon are
potential wearers of the royal purple.
The succes of the Carnival Masque
will rest largely with the king and
queen. They will start the merrymak
ing and will be in every way the rul
ing spirits of the evening. For this
reason, everyone is urged to consider
the qualities necessary to make a suc
cessful Lord and Lady of Misrule be
fore handing in his nominations.
Nominations will close Monday at 12
o'clock, voting on Quad will begin
Tuesday and last until noon Thursday.
A nomination blank will be found on
another page of today's Daily Palo
Alto which should be filed in the box
near the Romanic Languages building
Monday morning.
Costumes ordered by noon tomorrow
will arrive in the first shipment com
ing down Monday or Tuesday. Repre
sentatives of the Deßecat Company
will be in the Women's Clubhouse
from 7 to 8 this evening and from 9
to 2 tomorrow. Students are advised
to order their costumes early since
they will have the benefit of better
attention and wider selection. Sub
rosa, it may be whispered that stu
dents who leave their orders with the
campus representatives of the Deßecat
Company may choose their costumes
personally in the San Francisco store.
Orders must be filed before going to
San Francisco, however, if the stu
dents wish the 25 per cent reduction.
Tickets will go on sale tomorrow
morning at the Stanford Bookstore.
Admission will be $1.50 a couple. If
tickets are bought at the door Friday
night, student body cards will have to
be presented. The Carnival Masque is
not a jolly-up but is strictly a program
dance. Two women or two men may go
together but there will be no tag
dances. Roughs, not in costume, will
be taxed 25 cents.

Falk and Dave Mannoccir in the run
ning. Helen Whitney received the
greatest number of nominations for
queen, with Grace Darling a close sec
ond. Alice Roth, Dorothy Sudden, Vio
let Andrews, and Frances Sheldon are
potential wearers of the royal purple.
The succes of the Carnival Masque
will rest largely with the king and
queen. They will start the merrymak
ing and will be in every way the rul
ing spirits of the evening. For this
reason, everyone is urged to consider
the qualities necessary to make a suc
cessful Lord and Lady of Misrule be
fore handing in his nominations.
Nominations will close Monday at 12
o'clock, voting on Quad will begin
Tuesday and last until noon Thursday.
A nomination blank will be found on
another page of today's Daily Palo
Alto which should be filed in the box
near the Romanic Languages building
Monday morning.
Costumes ordered by noon tomorrow
will arrive in the first shipment com
ing down Monday or Tuesday. Repre
sentatives of the Deßecat Company
will be in the Women's Clubhouse
from 7 to 8 this evening and from 9
to 2 tomorrow. Students are advised
to order their costumes early since
they will have the benefit of better
attention and wider selection. Sub
rosa, it may be whispered that stu
dents who leave their orders with the
campus representatives of the Deßecat
Company may choose their costumes
personally in the San Francisco store.
Orders must be filed before going to
San Francisco, however, if the stu
dents wish the 25 per cent reduction.
Tickets will go on sale tomorrow
morning at the Stanford Bookstore.
Admission will be $1.50 a couple. If
tickets are bought at the door Friday
night, student body cards will have to
be presented. The Carnival Masque is
not a jolly-up but is strictly a program
dance. Two women or two men may go
together but there will be no tag
dances. Roughs, not in costume, will
be taxed 25 cents.
The royal race is on! And civil war
threatens —judging by the number of
contestants for the throne at the Car
nival Masque a week from tonight.
Athletes and Thespians, so far, seem
to have the voting edge but it's a wise
man who refrains from making pre
dictions.
