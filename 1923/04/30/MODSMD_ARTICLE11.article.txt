Sam Mendenhall, '24, and Katholeen
Hills, '25, will give a dancing act, "The
Man from Mars and the Girls in the
Moon," under the direction of Ernest
Grcppin, '24, who has planned some spe
cial light effects.
Through the efforts of Sam Menden
hall, the Pathe Film Company will send
one of its representatives, Mr. Rucker of
San Francisco, to take moving pictures
of the festivities.
A special meeting of the committee is
scheduled tomorrow night at 7:15 in the
