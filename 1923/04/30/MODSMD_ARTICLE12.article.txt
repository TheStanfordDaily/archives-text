# 1924 Quad to Reproduce Exclusive "Movies" in Track Pictorial Section
## 
### 
Moving pictures of the Stanford-Cali
fornia track meet, shown Saturday night
at the student movies, will be repro
duced in the 1924 Quad, which will he off
the press shortly after the first of June.
This will be the first Stanford year-book
to use moving pictures as a method of
showing in detail the different positions
taken by runners, hurdlers, jumpers, and
pole vaulters as they go through their
respective events.
The pictures were taken by the Quad
photographic editor, Ed Strong, '24, with
a camera loaned by Walter Fox of Palo
Alto. They are the exclusive property
of the year book, and will make up the
bulk of the track pictorial section. In
addition, exclusive action pictures taken
by Kcnyon and Crow will be reproduced.
A special picture of Paddock, winning
the hundred in the U. S. C. meet, copy
righted by Ed Tilton, '24, will be one of
the features of the preliminary track
season section.
On Thursday afternoon the final sale
of the 1924 Quad will start. Less than
400 copies are now left. When these are
3old, no more can be made available, as
over 150 pages of the book have already
been printed, making it impossible now
to change the total number published.
