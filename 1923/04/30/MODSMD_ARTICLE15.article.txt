California doesn't beat Stanford —•
it's a mental hazard.
The varsity nine shut out the Olym
pic Club by a 5 to 0 score Saturday
afternoon, with "Lefty" Hermle, Ed
Kelley, and Bill on the Club team.
Kelley pitched weakly and the Cards
slammed him to the suburbs of San
Jose. Hermle and Bill both played
a colorless game. And yet, playing for
California, these same men had the
Stanford team buffaloed.
Seven hits, including three triples
and a two-base bump, made the Card
inal look pretty good. Teague pitched
about the best game of the year, issu
ing four safe blows in four different
innings, and not permitting a single
base on balls. Kelley helped Wolter's
team out by sending eight men to first
without the formality of swinging at
the pill. All in all, it was Stanford's
reversal of form.
Cards Score in Third
The Cards rang up their first fare
in the third spasm. Peavy grounded to
the Club shortstop, who juggled the
ball and then threw it away, sending
the Stanford captain around to third
base. Teague scored a miss on a hit-' •
and-run signal and Peavy was out
thirty feet from the log. Roberts, the
next man up, went to first on a walk
and to Second on a passed ball. "Bud"
Woodward slapped out the first threfe
bagger of the day, and "Shorty"
scored. Woodward followed him i*V
during a blow-up of the Olympic in
field, and was safe when Hofner
dropped the throw to the plate.
Deffebach and Patterson 'singled '
with two out in the next frame, but.-.
Kelley inserted one of his five striker
outs at the right time, and no. runs
resulted.
Heckendorf Gets Triple
Another tally in the sixth. "Lefty"
Heckendorf took a deep breath and
slugged between left and center for
