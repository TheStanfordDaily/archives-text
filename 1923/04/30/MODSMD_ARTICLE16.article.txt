# SOPHOMORES WIN FROM 1926 TRACKMEN, 78-58
## Babes, Minus Boles and Kerr, Lose Hurdles, Miles Run; McCandless Vaults 11 Feet 
### 
Handicapped by the absence of two
of their best runners, Kerr and Boles,
the freshman track team was unable to
make a strong showing against the sopho
mores, and lost a slow and uninteresting
track meet to the '25 men by a 78 to 53
score on the Cardinal oval last Friday
afternoon.
No startling upsets were chalked up
except possibly in the 220-yard dash,
when both Fay, '26, and Shermund, "25,
beat Gaspar, '26, to the tape in 23 3-5
seconds. The judges had a difficult time
deciding the winner of what looked to
be a tie.
Thayer, '25, made good time in the
mile run when he rounded the four laps
in four minutes and thirty-eight seconds.
Cyprc, '26, came in a close second. Kerr
was not entered.
After being pushed off the track in the
440, Bill Richardson got his balance once
more and beat Shermund in 52 3-5 sec
onds. It was a beautiful race and Rich
ardson won by about five yards after
trailing the sophomore to the last curve.
Richardson did not enter the 880.
The only real find in the meet was
Tom McCandless, who pole vaulted for
the first time since he came to college
and took second place at 11 feet. Den
nis won the event.
No comparison could be made between
Leistner and Boles in the hurdles, as the
latter was not present. Despite the fact
that Leistner made slow times in both of
the hurdle events, it was easy to see
that "Swede" was just loafing and was
capable of a faster pace. "Swede" also
ran the last lap for the winning sopho
more relay team.
According to popular rumor, the pur
pose of the meet was to take the place
of the annual baseball fight with the
rivals competing on the cinder instead of
the diamond. Possibly ten, perhaps less,
of each class sat on the bleachers and
all seemed on the best of terms.
