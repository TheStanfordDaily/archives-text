May 16 has been selected as the
fourth annual Labor Day, when stu

brush, and dead trees about the Stan
ford Home for Convalescent Children.
Last year more than a thousand stu

labor was finished a barbecue dinner
was served on the lawns. Music was
furnished by the Stanford Band. After
supper an impromptu program was
presented, among which were several
selections by a Glee Club quartet.
The following committees have been
appointed by the Executive Commit
tee to take charge of activities:

chairman; Peter Crandall, finance.

It is expected that no meals will be
served at any of the fraternities, sor

assessed for the cost of the supper.
Each sorority made five dozen sand
wiches and all fraternities and clubs
were assessed three dollars. The menu
consisted of mutton, barbecued under
the direction of Sam McDonald, caro
taker of the athletic grounds, sand
wiches. coffee, and ice cream.
