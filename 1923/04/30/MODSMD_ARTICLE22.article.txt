# NOT A DRIVE
## 
### 
In accordance with the ruling made some months
ago limiting" the number and extent of "drives" on
the campus, Wednesday has been set as the day for
the present quarter upon which contributions may
he made.
There is 110 longer any intensive campaign or any
competitive group contributing. Each quarter one
day is devoted to the several causes passed by the
Social Service Board as worthy of support. The
situation is presented to students, who are free to
giv whatever aid they can to any one of the funds.
In taking away the unpleasant features of "drives"
as they developed during the war, it was hoped that
Stanford men and women would appreciate the new
system enough to give support in the absence of any
pressure. The fact that there is no concerted cam
paign should not be taken as an excuse for totally
ignoring the need of some small amount from every
student.
At the assembly Wednesday morning the two
causes will l>e presented—the Arthur Kimber fellow
ship which will send some Stanford student to a
French university every year, and the Convalescent
Home appeal for assistance in meeting the expenses
of maintenance. Whether or not the student feels
he can contribute is an individual matter but surely
there is no reason why he cannot at least become
acquainted with the situation by attending the as
sembly.
Wednesday evening, when workers visit the halls
and fraternities, it will be for the purpose of allow
ing those who have made up their minds to con
tribute with the least necessary trouble. And those
who do not give any support, at least should know
what they are talking about when they say '"No" to
Wednesday night's visitor.
