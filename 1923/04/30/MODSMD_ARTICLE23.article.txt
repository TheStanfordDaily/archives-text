# A 						LESSON FROM THE ANT
## 
### 
Men in all ages, observing the industrious ant,
have noted that by foregoing leisure it is able to
store up comforts to be enjoyed in the future. It
lias often been remarked that men should emulate
the ant in this respect, being assured that by so
doing they can achieve greater satisfaction than they
could ever secure by striving for present enjoy
ment. This advice has been held to be of especial
value to students and young people generally, be
cause they, having their lives before them, are in a
position to make the profitable bargain with their
future that the happy career of the ant suggests.
Those who see merit in all things new, and are
impatient of anything—even a thought—if it be old
and tried, are prone to point to the conclusions of the
psychologists who have investigated the behavior
of this insect. These psychologists have proved that
the ant has no intelligence whatsoever, and that it
behaves in its wonted fashion not because it is wise
enough to do so but because it is too foolish not to
do so. It is faithful to the mandates of nature and
it never takes advice. —C. N. H.
