A. few weeks ago students practically filled the
Assembly hall to see an exhibition of antique movies.
Saturday night a scattered crowd witnessed a genu
inely good program of pictures â€”and at a consider
ably reduced price. When the combination of a full
house and good show can be effected, the position of
student movies on the campus will be secure.
