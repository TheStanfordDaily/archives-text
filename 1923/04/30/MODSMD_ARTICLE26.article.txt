Assorted Social Blunders
An insidious habit which is growing more prevalent
is that of wearing pajamas to a formal ball. This is
decidedly pass 6 nowadays, and social leaders have con
ceded that while a stunning evening dress at cotillion
or house party, the pajama is not favored as ballroom
attire by those who know.
When a gentleman driving a dog-cart meets a lady of
his acquaintance, the proper mode of salutation is to

make a face at her
and whip up the
dogs.
Flasks are being
worn on one hip only
this year, the right
being more fashion
able.
The oia custom of
having the guest of
honor sit on the
hostess's right hand
is becoming declass6
now. It is uncom
fortable, and besides
she may need to use
it during the course
of the meal.

One hostess added a delicate little touch at a dinner
which she gave last winter by supplying every guest
with a napkin neatly folded beside his place.
The two-gallon hat for men has been cast into dis
favor by a recent constitutional amendment.
Applying horseradish as a sauce to pie betrays the
provincial. Worcestershire is the dressing now in vogue
among those who have "arrived."
Neither is it correct to eat peas with a knife held in
the left hand. The right hand is being used for this
purpose this season.
Mrs. Van Damexpense added a hint of eclat to her
recent debutante dinner when she presented as favors
diamond-encrusted tiaras to the ladies and platinum
wrist-watches to the gentlemen. Not an unsmiling face
was to be seen in the assemblage, and happy visages
were evident long after adieus were said.

A Rough's Best Behaviour at a Jolly-Up —
Be sober. It's enough to have to dance with you, let
alone carry you. Avoid pitfalls, that is, don't pick a —
er —citron. In a case like the above, explain to the
lemon —we mean lady—that you have been taken with
a sudden attack and can proceed no longer. Stay out
for a lap. If you get sideled off in a mob of wall roughs
the best tactics are to break the bottle outside the door
and await developments. The world is then yours, pick
out the queen.
* * •
How to drink soup at a sorority—
Wait until the soup is served. Attack carefully. Sip
nervously, testing its calloric capacity. If you have a
musical inclination, don't be basliful, but at least make
the tune sound modern. The girls will smile pleasantly,
whereon you begin a conversation. Comment on the
crack in the chinaware; its artificial designing. You'll
make a hit.

Miss. Dear Susie,

How to drink soup at a sorority—
Wait until the soup is served. Attack carefully. Sip
nervously, testing its calloric capacity. If you have a
musical inclination, don't be basliful, but at least make
the tune sound modern. The girls will smile pleasantly,
whereon you begin a conversation. Comment on the
crack in the chinaware; its artificial designing. You'll
make a hit.

Assorted Social Blunders
An insidious habit which is growing more prevalent
is that of wearing pajamas to a formal ball. This is
decidedly pass 6 nowadays, and social leaders have con
ceded that while a stunning evening dress at cotillion
or house party, the pajama is not favored as ballroom
attire by those who know.
When a gentleman driving a dog-cart meets a lady of
his acquaintance, the proper mode of salutation is to

make a face at her
and whip up the
dogs.
Flasks are being
worn on one hip only
this year, the right
being more fashion
able.
The oia custom of
having the guest of
honor sit on the
hostess's right hand
is becoming declass6
now. It is uncom
fortable, and besides
she may need to use
it during the course
of the meal.

One hostess added a delicate little touch at a dinner
which she gave last winter by supplying every guest
with a napkin neatly folded beside his place.
The two-gallon hat for men has been cast into dis
favor by a recent constitutional amendment.
Applying horseradish as a sauce to pie betrays the
provincial. Worcestershire is the dressing now in vogue
among those who have "arrived."
Neither is it correct to eat peas with a knife held in
the left hand. The right hand is being used for this
purpose this season.
Mrs. Van Damexpense added a hint of eclat to her
recent debutante dinner when she presented as favors
diamond-encrusted tiaras to the ladies and platinum
wrist-watches to the gentlemen. Not an unsmiling face
was to be seen in the assemblage, and happy visages
were evident long after adieus were said.

A Rough's Best Behaviour at a Jolly-Up —
Be sober. It's enough to have to dance with you, let
alone carry you. Avoid pitfalls, that is, don't pick a —

lemon —we mean lady—that you have been taken with
a sudden attack and can proceed no longer. Stay out
for a lap. If you get sideled off in a mob of wall roughs
the best tactics are to break the bottle outside the door
and await developments. The world is then yours, pick

recent debutante dinner when she presented as favors
diamond-encrusted tiaras to the ladies and platinum

A Rough's Best Behaviour at a Jolly-Up —
Be sober. It's enough to have to dance with you, let
alone carry you. Avoid pitfalls, that is, don't pick a —
er —citron. In a case like the above, explain to the
lemon —we mean lady—that you have been taken with
a sudden attack and can proceed no longer. Stay out
for a lap. If you get sideled off in a mob of wall roughs
the best tactics are to break the bottle outside the door
and await developments. The world is then yours, pick
out the queen.

How to drink soup at a sorority—
Wait until the soup is served. Attack carefully. Sip
nervously, testing its calloric capacity. If you have a
musical inclination, don't be basliful, but at least make
the tune sound modern. The girls will smile pleasantly,
whereon you begin a conversation. Comment on the
crack in the chinaware; its artificial designing. You'll
make a hit.
