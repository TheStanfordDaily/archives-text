Communications received by the Daily indicate
plainly how difficult it is for students to keep the
personal clement out of impersonal arguments.
When a discussion becomes merely a vehicle for
denunciation of individuals, its arbitrary conclusion
is justified. The Daily is always willing to print
letters upon almost any subject as long as the privi
lege of expressing opinions is not dissipated for the
purpose of indulging in personalities.
