Editor D. P. A.:
A short time ago there appeared in
the editorial column of the D. P. A. an
extract from Sinclair's "Goose-step,"
which contained a letter from a Chinese
student concerning a certain situation at
Stanford. In view of the communica
tion from Bill Evans and the discussion
which followed, it seems worth while
to remark that the Dean of Men re
ferred to by the Chinese student was
not Dean Culver, but his predecessor.
The incident seems to have happened in
the summer quarter of 1920.
