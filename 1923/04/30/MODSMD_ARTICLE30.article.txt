# "God Help the Students"

Editor Daily Palo Ai.to:
The writer of your Wednesday's edi
torial on "Enthusiastic Audiences" char
acterizes Mr. Ratcliffe's address on the
European crisis as a "thoroughly special
ized and unilluminated lecture," which
should not have been delivered before
a "general audience." I should have
thought it would be hard to select two
epithets more utterly inapplicable to the
address in question. Mr. Ratcliffe, to be
sure, as an editor of the Manchester
Guardian—perhaps the world's leading
organ of liberal opinion today—and a
profound student of the European situ
ation, might easily have made his ad
dress over-technical for a "general," or
even for a university audience. But, far
from doing so, he gave us a model of
clear and luminous exposition (delivered
with an eloquence that owed much to

the speaker's evident sincerity and very
little to rhetorical artifice) of a problem
of paramount importance to all—one
would suppose—who have in the least at
heart the future of our civilization.
"That," Mr. Editor, "is no exaggera
tion."
If it is true, as the writer of your edi
torial avers, that "a considerable section
of the student body spent most of the
hour in an effort to keep their heads from
bobbing off their necks, or in endeavor
ing to prevent their snores from becom
ing audible," then I can only say, God
help a considerable section of the stu
dent body!
B. O. FOSTER.
