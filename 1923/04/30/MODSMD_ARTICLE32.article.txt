# "FAITH IS HYPOTHESIS OF GOD"--DR. ELIJAH HARLEY
## 
### 
"Hypothesis, translated into the lan
guage of religion becomes faith," said
Dr. Elijah A. Hanley, of the First Bap
tist Church of Berkeley, yesterday morn
ing in his sermon at the Memorial
church.
"Faith in God means that men shall
stand ready for whatever committments
may be in store; that they shall trust
Him to see them through; and that they
shall let the creative energies of God
work through their lives."
This was the substance of Dr. Han
ley's talk which he declared could well
be entitled "The Hypothesis of God."
"If any man seeks for a basis of faith
in his own mind, let him ask himself such
questions as these: What do I feel to
be true- What is worthy of such a man
as I am with my inheritance, my capa-

bilities, and the benefits I have received
from society- What do I owe to my
fellow men and to God-"
Faith as analyzed by Dr. Hanley, is
always adventurous and creative. Dis
coverors, explorers, and pioneers were
men of faith, as well as leaders of fi
nance, who develop the business interests
of the country, capitalizing credit and
public confidence.
"Strange ,as it may seem," said Dr.
Hanley, "I find no more noble examples
of faith than men of science who gather
up the results of assured knowledge and
push forward to some fuller explanation
of the facts of experience. They have
the sublime confidence that the world is
rational and that the human mind may
be trusted to find its way into true knowl
edge."
