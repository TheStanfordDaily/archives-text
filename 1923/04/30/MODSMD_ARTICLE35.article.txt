# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY RECEIVES SHIPMENT OF FRENCH PAPERS
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library received
nine large cases of books, pamphlets, and
documents from Paris last week, which
are the result of two years' work of col
lectors in France representing the Hoo
ver War Library, as well as of Professor
E. D. Adams and Professor R. H. Lutz,
who direct the Hoover Library at the
University.
In a general way, this collection sup
plements the French publications which
the Library has obtained already.
An idea of the size of the shipment
may be obtained from the invoice, which
has a volume of 168 typewritten pages,
and has approximately 3,360 entries.
Practically all the important French
publications which have been printed
since the armistice and which cover ev
ery phase of the war activities are in
cluded in this shipment.
Champion, French collector, secured a
number of private libraries, one of which
is the library of Pierre Boutroux, pro
fessor at the College d'France, who was
attached during the war to the intelli
gence service of the ministry of war.
A collection belonging to M. Clunet,
French lawyer, and authority on inter
national law, was also procured by
Champion. Clunet's name was included
in Germany's first list of hostages, whom,
because of national influence and con
nections, they planned to take in case
they reached Paris in 1915.
