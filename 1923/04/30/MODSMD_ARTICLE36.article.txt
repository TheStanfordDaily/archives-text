# HAYS WILL LEAD NEXT CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM
## 
### 
Frank Hays, '22, was elected captain
of next year's cross-country team last
Friday, when the runners gathered for
a Quad picture. Paul Murphy, '25, re
ceived the same number of votes as Hays
but lost the captaincy on the toss of a
coin. Both men placed in the race with
California last autumn; Murphy took
second but a short distance behind A1
Smith, while Hays finished ninth.
Hays has made fast times in the two
mile run this spring. His best mark was
9 minutes and 53 seconds.
