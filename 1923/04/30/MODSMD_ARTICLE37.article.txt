# MATERIALS SHIPPED EAST FOR COMPLETE INDEX OF CHAUCER

All manuscript for a Chaucer con
cordance, the first to be made of the old
English poet, which is edited by John
Tatlock, professor of English philology,
and A. R. Kennedy, assistant professor
of English philology, was shipped last
week from the Library to the Carnegie
Institute of Washington, which will
publish the work.
The concordance, a complete index to
the words and ideas of Chaucer, is con
sidered the most difficult English con
cordance ever written. The old, vari
able spelling made the task of classifi
cation by spelling exceedingly complex.
Many of the old compounded words
appear not only as hyphenated words, but
as a single word and as two words.
The first work on this concordance was
commenced in England in 1872 by Dr.
Furnivall. After his death the work
was continued by various people until
1893; then it was taken over by the late
Dr. Flugel, professor of English philol
ogy at Stanford. Flugel, who labored
on the materials until his death in 1914,
planned a great work, which should com
bine the concordance and a Chaucer dic
tionary. After his death Professor Tat
lock took over the task. Tatlock found
that some of the original materials were
incomplete, so it was found necessrry
to discard the old slips. The war held
work up until 1919, when some forty
people were procured to labor on the
slips.
It is expected that Dr. Flugel's diction
ary will be combined with the plan for
a medieval English dictionary of W. A.
Craigie of Oxford, who was here last
year.
