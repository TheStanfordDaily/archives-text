# LOWER DIVISION SUPERIOR TO OLD SYSTEM--- TERM AN
## 
### 
That the present system of Lower Di
vision requirements at Stanford is a de
cided improvement over the unmodified
major department system of three years
ago, is the opinion of Professor L. M.
Terman of the Psychology department.
"Although the Lower Division ar
rangement may not be in any sense per
fect, yet it is a big improvement over
our former system, in which students en
tered a major department as soon as they
began their college work," Professor
Terman said. "I believe in the major
department system, but I also think that
the slight modification made on it as it
now stands is an improvement. The
present ruling of Lower Division re
quirements insures that the student will
not leave college knowing nothing of
certain subjects witli which he should
be acquainted.
"The majority of students are not
ready to decide when they first enter the
University what subject is going to be
best for them to major in. They have
hitherto not had a chance to sample

enough lines of work to know in which
fields their inclinations and talents lie.
The idea behind the major department
system is good, but when unrestricted
the system permitted a department to
prescribe an unreasonably large amount
of work in that department so that it
occasionally happened that the system
devised primarily to insure academic
freedom to the student gave just the op
posite result."
Professor Terman pointed out that the
Lower Division requirements are far
from rigid, since only about 40 to 60
per cent of the Lower Division work
is required and since ordinarily the stu
dent is able to get work in his major
department in his second year.
In discussing the tendency to voca
tionalize high school work, Professor
Terman stated that only about 40 or 50
per cent of the high school students have
the ability to carry the courses that lead
to college and consequently nice prac
tical subjects must be established for
those who cannot think in abstract terms.
