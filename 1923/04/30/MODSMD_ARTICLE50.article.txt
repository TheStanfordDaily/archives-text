## 
### 
The Library recently lias received a
volume as a gift from the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland, with the com
pliments of John Bruce. The book, "The
Treasure of Traprain," is the story of a
Scottish hoard of silver plate found in
1919, and is written by Alexander O.
Curie, director of the Royal Scot
Museum.
The presence of a treasure hoard in
the region of the foothills twenty miles
east of Edinburgh was suspected because
of foregoing legends and surface indi
cations of early habitation. Exploration
began in 1914, but due to the war was
dropped within a year and not continued
until 1919. Silver spoons, flagons, flasks,
Teutonic ornaments, knives, and coins
dated 364 A. D., were discovered. The
book contains an inventory and plates
of the material found, a discussion of
the probable origin and source of the
treasure, and a description of the deco
rative animal gures on the coins.
