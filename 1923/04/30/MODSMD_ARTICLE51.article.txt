# Eastern Crews Tend to Three-Cornered Races
## 
### 
This year's college rowing program
in the East reveals a marked trend
toward triangular races instead of
dual events. Five of the eleven major
varsity contests scheduled between
April 21 and June 28 are three-cor
nered affairs.
The first triangular event was the
Childs Cup race at Philadelphia, April
28, when Columbia, Pennsylvania, and
Princeton renewed their old rivalry.
One week later, Yale, Pennsylvania,
and Columbia will meet at Derby,
Conn., in their first triangular event.
On this same date, Harvard, Navy, and
Princeton will get together on Lake
Carnegie at Princeton.
The intercollegiate regatta on the'
Hudson at Poughkeepsie, June 28, will
furnish the climax of the rowing sea
son. Cornell, Columbia, and Pennsyl
vania and Syracuse, the four members
of the I. A. A., will compete, while it
is possible that the University of
Washington, champions of the Pacific
coast, may enter a team in the blue
ribbon classic of the season.
