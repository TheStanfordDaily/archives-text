# Student Movie Program Attracts Small Audience
## 
### 
Moving pictures of the "Big Meet,"
Viola Dana in "Crinoline and Romance,"
and Buster Keaton in "Neighbors," were
the main features of the student movie
program presented in the Assembly hall
Saturday evening. The pictures were of
a distinctly modern character, as com
pared to the archaic productions shown
on the last program, and the audience
gave them a good reception.
Buster Keaton and his antics in
"Neighbors," trying to get married,
gained the approval of the audience. The
pictures of the Stanford-California meet
were taken by a 1924 Quad photographer.
Chuck Beardsley announced the events
as they appeared on the screen in the
Assembly hall.
Less than 600 people attended the pro
gram and consequently the project did
not pay for itself. The next student
movie will be presented on June 1. Fea
tures which have been obtained for this
are Peter B. Kyne's "Brothers Under the
Skin," and Bull Montana in his travesty
on Robin Hood, "Rob 'Em Good." Ad
mission to this production will be 25
cents.
