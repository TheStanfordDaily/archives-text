as the royal rulers will be screened.
In addition, Mendenhall will have B.

Costumes may be ordered from
representatives of the Deßecat com
pany in the Women's Clubhouse not
later than Wednesday. Orders given
from 1 to 2 o'clock of one day will
arrive -the following evening which
permits time for changes before Fri
day. Sam Mendenhall, chairman of the
>costume committee, urges students to
hand in their orders immediately to
avoid the confusion of a last-minute
rush. The Deßecat Company has
agreed to furnish the coronation cos
tumes free, in addition to giving a 25
per cent reduction on all other cos
tumes.
Voting for the carnival king and
queen begins on the Quad tomorrow
and will end Thursday noon. Alice
Roth, who received a large number of
nominations, will not return from the
East before the carnival and so her
name was removed from the candi
dates for queen.
Helen Whitney leads Lura Spangler
by a considerable margin in the race
for queen with Violet Andrews and
Frances Sheldon trailing. Sam Men
denhall has a decided edge on the
kingship with Nelson Van Judah and
Sid Laughlin fighting it out for second
place. Dud DeGroot and Lane Falk are
the remaining candidates. Of the ten
other men and women nominated, no
one received a sufficient number of
votes to qualify for the final list.

are on sale at the Stanford Bookstore;
