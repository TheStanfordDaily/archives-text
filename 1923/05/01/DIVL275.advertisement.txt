THIS is written to the man who loves to seek the
unknown quantity. He is the kind of labora
tory worker who ventures into untried fields of ex
periment, rather than the man who tests materials.
Industry has need of both types, but of the
former there is a more pressing demand.
College men may have been discouraged from
pursuing pure research. In this highly practical
age it may seem there is little room for work
which does not have an immediate dollars and
cents application. ISut such is not the case.
The pure research man is the pathfinder. With'
out him our fountain of knowledge would dry up.
His findings in themselves may be uncommercial,
but they establish a field for others to develop.
Volta worked out the crude voltaic pile—uniuv
tportant until other men improved and applied
it. And so with Papin in the field of steam, or
Lavoisier in chemistry.
Men of the inquiring slant of mind, stick to your

laboratory of some industrial organization, there
will always be an "X" to baffle other men and call
for the keenest thought of you blazers of the trail.
