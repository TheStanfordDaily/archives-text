'TWAS COOK'S
EVENING OUT
and so I served dinner
all by my lonesome.
Dad said "This is great,
and to show my ap
proval I am going - to
take yon and mother to
the movies."
To the movies we
went, and afterwards
we had refreshments
at Wilson's. As we
passed the candy coun
ter Dad said "Guess
I'll have to buy Mother
a box of chocolates.
That young rascal
Jack of yours (wink
ing at me) is setting
me a bad example."
