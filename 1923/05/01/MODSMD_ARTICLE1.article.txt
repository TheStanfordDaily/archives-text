# CARD TRACK MEN TO ENTER P.A.A. MEET AT BERKELEY
## Team Will Not Compete As Body; Freshman Stars To Participate Van Judah, Black, and Falk Expected to Even Up For Bruin Victory 
### 
Stanford's cinder path team, as a unit,
will not be represented in the annual
P. A. A. meet to be held at Berkeley next
Saturday afternoon, according to Coach
"Dink" Templeton. The men have been
allowed to enter on their own initiative,
however, by sending in individual entry
applications.
Among the unofficial Stanford entries
in the track events are: Campbell and
Clark in the sprints; Falk and Leistner
in the hurdles; Van Judah in the quarter
mile; Elliott in the mile; and perhaps
Dole in the half-mile.
Hays, Cardinal two-miler, is entered
in the five-mile race. There will be no
two-mile run.
In the field events are entered: Bill
Black in the pole vault; Arthur in the
Scotland University for a number of
Kemnitzer in the high jump.
Some of the freshtnen track men
are also planning on sending in entry
blanks. Among the most probable en
tries from the babe ranks will be Rich
ardson in the 880; Boles in the hurdles;
Cypher and Kerr in the mile, with possi
bly Caspar and Miller in the sprints.
With this combination of point win
ners, Stanford has a good chance to meet
California on more even terms, while
the Bears are receiving strong compe
tition in the field events, their best bet.
It is doubtful if the husky Lasky, who
so upset the dope in the Big Meet and
forced Van Judah into third place, can
again win from the blond Cardinal quar
ter-miler next Saturday. Van Judah beat
Sudby five yards in the relay after over
coming a lead which was equal to an
additional five yards.
By Saturday Bill Black's ankle will be
considerably better and it looks like a
victory for the Stanford vaulter if he
puts forth half the effort Saturday that
lie did two weeks ago against Red Norris.
