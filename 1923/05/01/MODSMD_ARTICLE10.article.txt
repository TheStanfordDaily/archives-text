# WEDNESDAY ASSEMBLY TO START PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR SPRING GIFT APPEAL
## 
### Everett W. Smith, Professor of Journalism 
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of

becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to

individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does

127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi

students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to

generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does

The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver

127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi

are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does

The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem

disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor

"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver

127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
tion, from the funds of the Friends of
France, the organization that financed the '
first Stanford ambulance units, there
will come $600 through William B.
Bourn, the Stanford trustee who was
president of this organization, and the
members of the first Stanford ambu
lance unit will contribute the $275,
which they now have in their treasury.
Value of French Study
1 he value of study by Americans in
French universities is set forth by Presi
dent Wilbur in these words:
"Contact with foreign countries and
foreign languages gives breadth to edu
cation. The student who is fortunate
enough to spend a part of his student
period in a university in a country new

to him is more apt to be a better world
citizen.
" The universities of France offer as
sociation with one of the greatest of in
tellectual civilizations. France and
America have been mutually helpful
throughout the years. They must always
be kept in harmonious understanding.
No one factor in this is more important
than to have American university men
study in French universities and French
students come to America.
"The American Field Service fellow
ships will be of great advantage in send
ing selected Americans to French uni
versities. They will represent that senti
ment of sympathy for the ideals of
France, which was shown by the desire
to help in the succor of wounded French
sobers struck down on battlefields later
to become our own."
Walter E. Bruns, a Stanford ambu
lance man, who studied in the University
de Dijon after his war service, writing
in support of the American Field Ser
vice fellowships, says:
Learned How France Thinks
"I left the Universite de Dijon with
the feeling that I had had an experience
which, measured by the standard of men
tal satisfaction, would perhaps never be
equaled. French professors, with their
splendid patience, overcame the language
obstacle and gave me an insight into their
history, literature, law, and institutions
from a French standpoint, to be sure,
but in terms and principles comprehensi
ble to an American. Stimulated by their
instruction, I found great pleasure in
talking to various types of French peo
ple and reading their newspapers. I
learned how France thinks, and with that
came the exultant feeling that I had be
gun to know France. The knowledge,
so gained, cannot be valued. To me it
is priceless.
"If a great many Americans could
learn to know France and other nations
in that way a big stride toward the goal
of peaceful co-operation between nation

and nation would have been male. Syd
ney Smith once said: 'Don't introduce
me to that man. I feel it piy duty to
hate him, and you can't hate a man when
you know him.' So it is with nations.
Therein lies the value of such an insti
tution as the American Field Service
fellowships to French universities. The
possibilities appear to me to be so great
that the fellowships must and will merit
the careful consideration and generous
help of iptelligent forward-looking
Americans."
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old wayâ€”at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
in 1920. The house and grounds are held
on long lease from the Trustees of the
University at a rental of a dollar a year.
While the Home was established pri
marily to care for the needy children in
Stanford clinics in San Francisco, it
has broadened into an institution that
receives convalescent children from any
clinical hospital or accredited charity.
It is entirely non-sectarian.
The endowment of the Home has
reached the sum of $88,000. The income
from this fund is turned back into capi
tal, so that the endowment may reach
$100,000.
Mrs. Henry J. Crocker is about to
build a new unit for twenty children, bed
cases, at a cost of $35,000, in memory
of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Ground will be broken perhaps before
Labor Day.
Each year students of the University
have cleaned up the grounds, and many
men and women have given of their time
and strength each week to doing the
chores about the Home and caring for
the children.
The cost of maintenance of the Home
from July 1, 1920, to June 30, 1921, was
over $6,000. From July 1, 1921, to June
30, 1922, the cost was $5,721. The cost
of the Home fof food in 1921 was
$2,718.27; in 1922, $2,660.72. For cloth
ing the cost was last year $1,103.96.
The friends of the Home subscribed
to the maintenance fund last year over
$5,000.
270 Children Cared For
We have sixteen children under our
care each day. During the two years
1920-22 270 children have recuperated
from their various ailments under the
kind supervision of Mrs. Chase and her
assistants. We have a mending com
mittee which spent $450 to provide for
the entire supply of underwear, hosiery,
wrappers and nightgowns. One lady has
made 211 slip-ons and sweaters and 51
knitted caps for the Home during the
past two years.
An auxiliary to the Home under the
direction of Mrs. Timothy Hopkins of
Menlo Park exists for the purpose of
carrying out improvements and better
ments at the Home, the cost of which
could not be imposed upon the mainte
nance fund. This auxiliary arranges an
annual circus for the children of Menlo
Park, the proceeds of which have so far
added over $20,000 to the funds that are
used for the Home.
Strength and Happinss for Kids
Mrs. Pay son J. Treat, chairman of the
house committee of the Home, comes
into intimate touch with the children who
gain strength and happiness here that
would otherwise be impossible. Wasted
little frames are soon filled out and white
cheeks become ruddy under the influ
ence of good food and play in the sun
shine.
"Imagine," she says, "the terror of a
Stanford maiden if during any six weeks
she should gain pounds, yet when
one small girl accomplished this at the
Stanford Convalescent Home there was
much rejoicing. During the four years
that the Home has been established on
the campus it has been consistently dem
onstrated that good food, sufficient rest
and play will restore most ailing chil
dren to normal health and happiness in

amazing short time, especially after ton
sil operations and flu. Persistent coughs
are usually cured by open air and sun
shine away from the fogs of the city.
The children all sleep on open porches
and as soon as the weather permits have
their meals in the large screened dining
room, a family of sixteen who change
as frequently as they recuperate.
"One of the most interesting cases
during the last year was a twelve-year
old boy with Hodgkin's disease. This
malady has always been known to be
fatal, but recent developments have
proved that X-ray treatments would tem
porarily arrest the development of the
disease. This boy gained pounds in
his six weeks' sojourn at the Home, and
improved so in his general appearance
that his mother hardly recognized him.
Another eight-year-old boy was para
lyzed after diphtheria and arrived at the
Home too miserable to be interested in
anything. Within eight weeks he was a
ruddy-cheeked youngster able to run
anywhere and tease like any other nor
mal boy.
"There has always been a refreshing
democracy among these children. Races
and creeds blend well at play. In fact,
Tiny Tim, a three-year-old Chinese, who
grew so round and rosy at the Home,
was the adored pet of all the children.
Mrs. Chase, the mother of this cver
changing family, seems to have the 'key
to the calories' and opens the larder fre
quently."
127 men who went out with ambulance
units and died during the war. Of these
127, five were Stanford men: Harold
Aupperle, '17, Greayer Clover, ex-'l9,
Arthur Kimber, '18, Alan Nichols, '19,
and Harold Sayre, '19.
Kimber carried to France and turned
over to the first Stanford ambulance
unit the first American flag that was
borne on the battle front after the
United States entered the war. The flag
was received with imposing ceremonies
on the part of the French army, and later
decorated with the Croix de Guerre in
recognition of the heroism of its Stan
ford bearers. It now rests in the Stan
ford* Memorial Church.
Arthur Kimber became a lieutenant in
the United States air service and was
shot down and killed in battle behind the
German line on September 28, 1918, after
a heroic record as a fighting scout in
the Argonne, St. Mihiel and Sedan
drives. His body was never recovered.
Gores, '17, Making Record
Of the sixty fellowships that have so
far been awarded by the American Field
Service organization in the four years
since the enterprise was instituted, only
one has been granted to a Stanford man,
Walter Gores, '17, but it is to be noted
that although only twenty-five of the
sixty were given the fellowship for a
second year, Gores was one of these
twenty-five. He is now winning high
commendations for his accomplishments
as a student of the history of art in the
University of Paris. The completion of
the Arthur Kimber fellowship will en
sure the award of a fellowship every
year to a Stanford man.
It is not expected that Stanford stu
dents will alone raise the $25,000 needed
to endow the fellowship. Others will
complete the sum if a substantial be
ginning is made. Already there is nearly
a thousand dollars in hand. Arthur Kim
ber's mother has requested the privilege
of contributing the first $100. In addi
