# WEDNESDAY ASSEMBLY TO START PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR SPRING GIFT APPEAL
## 
### Everett W. Smith, Professor of Journalism 
This is a "publicity story" in behalf of this quarter's gift appeal to Stanford
students. The projects which are presented for voluntary financial support
are the American Field Service Fellowship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
and the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children.
Instead of trying to edge in on Stanford men and women with a series of news
stories in the hope that the worthiness of these enterprises may seep into their
minds and consciences, I am trying whether a single, simple statement of the
meaning and value of the two undertakings may not be just as effective.
This is in accord with the spirit of the present system of only one appeal
of the sort each quarter, with a brief .straight-forward campaign, instead of
the old custom of a succession of "drives" and the badgering of students into
becoming irritated victims. That system was abolished on the ground that
the harrying, harrassing and hounding of students killed the spirit of real
charity. The plan followed this quarter presupposes that each student will
make it a matter of personal duty to make up his mind honestly and deliber
ately as to how much he ought to give.
This story and the assembly tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock are designed to
help in that consideration and determination. If the assembly should not be
generally attended, it would be an indication that a queit, dignified appeal to
individual judgment, while fine in theory, is ineffective in practice, if it does
not even suggest a degree of insincerity in tbe opposition to the old way—at
least that obnoxious old way did raise money for worthy Stanford under
takings.
Here are the two enterprises that will be presented tomorrow for Stanford
student support:

Home For Convalescent Children
The Stanford Home for Convalescent
Children on the campus is the only
charity maintained by the University. It
is maintained by voluntary contributions,
but no appeal has ever been made to stu
dents for money for its support before.
It costs about $450 a month to meet the
running expenses.
The first work done for convalescent
children on the campus took the form of
a summer camp. One hundred and
twenty children were cared for during
two summers. This led to a request
from San Francisco that we establish a
home for all-the-year-round care of con
valescent children. The Stanford Home
was established on the campus in 1919,
and moved to the old Stanford residence

Arthur Kimber Fellowship
Stanford has started the endowment
of an American Field Service fellow
ship in memory of Arthur Kimber, '18,
to be awarded annually to a Stanford
student for advanced study in a French
university. The American Field Ser
vice Association, whose membership is
made up of the American college men
who volunteered for ambulance service
with the French armies before America
entered the war, has devoted its funds
to establishing fellowships for Ameri
can students in France, in order to per
petuate the sympathy and mutual under
standing between the two nations which
was an outgrowth of their service.
Eventually the plan is to have a fel
lowship as a memorial for each of the
