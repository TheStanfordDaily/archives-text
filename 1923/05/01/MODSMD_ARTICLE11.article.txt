# ALPHA DELTA PHI, DELTA CHI, LOS ARCOS NINES WIN
## 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi, Delta Chi, and Los
Arcos nines won their intramural games
yesterday by scores that seemed large
enough to be the results of a track meet.
The Alpha Delt-Sequoia second score
was 17-0. Los Arcos defeated El Campo
15-8, and Delta Chi walloped Chi Psi
to the tune of 15-12. The Japanese Club
forfeited their game to the Encina third
aggregation.
The Alpha Delta Phi men had little
trouble in taking Sequoia into camp.
Fred Loomis in the box for the win
ners, had the game on ice throughout
and the Sequoia hitters couldn't fathom
his curves. Every man on the Alpha
Dclt team hit well, all getting on bases.

The Delta Chi-Chi Psi contest was a
nip-and-tuck affair with everyone on
both sides hitting. The Chi Psi team
was never out of the running until the
last inning.
Van King started in the box for Chi
Psi and Reticker did the twirling for the
Delta Chi nine. Each of these pitchers
allowed one run in the first,and a Chi Psi
rally in the third brought the score to
6-2. Delta Chi started going' in the
fourth and made eight runs, and then
both teams garnered a few in the next
two innings, with the result that the score
stood 12 all in the sixth. In the final
inning Delta Chi made three runs off
Hays, who had replaced King, bringing
the total to 15-12.
King knocked out a homer for the
longest hit of the day. The heavy hitters
for Delta Chi were Triddle, Caplen, and
Hay. The fielding was ragged and the
large score was due to the frequent er
rors made by both sides.
Los Arcos and El Campo played a
slap-bang contest. Hamilton, the Los
Arcos pitcher, had a shade the best of
things, and he was able to keep the El
Campo men from scoring as often as his
own teammates. For the winners, Smith,
Taylor, and Blacker did the best work.
Games scheduled for today are: Kap
pa Alpha t vs. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon vs. Phi Kappa Sigma; Sigma
Chi vs. El Capitan; and Delta Upsilon

nip-and-tuck affair with everyone on
both sides hitting. The Chi Psi team
was never out of the running until the
last inning.
Van King started in the box for Chi
Psi and Reticker did the twirling for the
Delta Chi nine. Each of these pitchers
allowed one run in the first,and a Chi Psi
rally in the third brought the score to
6-2. Delta Chi started going' in the
fourth and made eight runs, and then
both teams garnered a few in the next
two innings, with the result that the score
stood 12 all in the sixth. In the final
inning Delta Chi made three runs off
Hays, who had replaced King, bringing
the total to 15-12.
King knocked out a homer for the
longest hit of the day. The heavy hitters
for Delta Chi were Triddle, Caplen, and
Hay. The fielding was ragged and the
large score was due to the frequent er
rors made by both sides.
Los Arcos and El Campo played a
slap-bang contest. Hamilton, the Los
Arcos pitcher, had a shade the best of
things, and he was able to keep the El
Campo men from scoring as often as his
own teammates. For the winners, Smith,
Taylor, and Blacker did the best work.
Games scheduled for today are: Kap
pa Alpha t vs. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon vs. Phi Kappa Sigma; Sigma
Chi vs. El Capitan; and Delta Upsilon
vs. Beta Theta Pi.
