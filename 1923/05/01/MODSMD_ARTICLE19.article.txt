# FOR TOMORROW WE DIE
## 
### 
Did you ever watch the crowd at a beach resort
rushing from concession to concession, from hot
dogs to lemonade? Did you ever follow a fat man's
perspiring course over a crowded dance floor? Of
course, you say, what of it? Well, did it ever occur
to you what a frantic effort some people make to
have a good time?
If there is one thing that a college education
should be able to discourage, it is hedonism. It does
not require a master mind to discover that pleasure
is most real when it is the by-product of some other
phase of life and when it ceases to be an end in itself.
Four years in college ought to discourage that state
of mind which makes a business of having a good
time.
Max Beerbohm has remarked that there is some -
thing rather dreary in the notion of going anywhere
for the specific purpose of being amused. "I prefer,"
he says, "that laughter take me unawares."
,We of the "rising generation" like to justify our
foibles by the bromidic observation that youth comes
but once. Too true â€”and the "eat, drink and be
merry" philosophy has its merits. But there are sev
eral ways of being merry and there is always the
chance that tomorrow we may not die. What then
if our ability to enjoy eating and drinking has been
destroyed by surfeiting?
Is this a recommendation of firm and unflinching
adherence to the path of duty with a ready frown for
the pleasing distractions along the wayside ? Hardly
that. It is merely a suggestion that we might enjoy
life a little more completely if we didn't so delib
erately and religiously seek means of diversion and
recreation.
The odd part of it is that realizing this to be true,
we each continue to plan on Saturday night's jollity
with much more enthusiasm than we give to more
immediate and more distant interests. It is more cer
tain than this intangible pleasure which comes as a
reward for other endeavors. Well, tomorrow some
of us may die.
