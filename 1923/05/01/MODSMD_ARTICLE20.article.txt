# "FREE AND FRANK"

### 
"Arizona is a truly Western college, free and
frank," says A. E. Roth, when interviewed upon
his recent trip. There are no two adjectives which
Stanford men and women should desire to deserve
more than those two. Freedom and frankness are
healthy attributes. They are the qualities for which
Eastern institutions may well envy the West and of
which the West may well be jealous.
