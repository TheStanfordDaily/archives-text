Well!
Good-evening, Sisters! Did you know that the benefi
cent and genial editors of the Daily Palo Alto have
decided to give us a whole column in which we may one
and all express our own peculiar opinions? Perhaps not
till now. But know it herewith.
Think of it! a quarter of a page weekly is dedicated
to the feminine viewpoint. Herein we may declare, state,
profess, or narrate concerning any subject under the
sun, be it hairpins or hearts, politics or powder-puffs,
babies or bacteriology.
What nice little discussions and concussions we are
going to have! Since this is strictly No Man's Land we
shall have some salubrious skirmishes and beautiful
bombardments. If you have cherished some college
criticism, 10, these many years since froshhood. Stately
Seniors, speak out! Propound your pet problems, Juniors
and Sophomores. Even the fragile freshwomen may air
their tender budding thoughts here, too.
This column is going to be one popular pourri of
feminine facts and fancies. Not necessarily lady-like but
feminine above all.
If you have just finished an excellent book and believe
that the other Four Hundred and Ninety-Nine should
read it, too, to round out their girlish lives, recommend
it. If you have discovered a superior method of swim
ming, singing, fighting, or writing, commend it. If you
have solved any problems racial, spacial, or even facial,
let the rest of us in on the secret, right here. And if
your soul has felt the effects of April poppy fields or
Lagunita au claire de la lune, and you have reacted
poetically, send in your little ones.
Our column is going to be as readable as Beatrice
Fairfax, The Gumps, Geraldine, and the Sporting Green,
all put together, and more so if all you Stanford Sisters
express and pass on to us exactly what you think about
things.
This is our Queendom. But I have a great, generous,
and joyous hunch that the Campus Kings and Jacks
will derive quite as much eager enjoyment from read
ing this column as we shall fro mwriting it.
Remember that this portion of the Daily is dedicated
to us carte blanche, literally and metaphorically speak
ing.
Rmember that the Masculine Majority insists that
Stanford Women have only a feeble and fast-fading
interest in Campus affairs. So here's our chance to show
'em we have ideas, that we do think, and What and
Where and When and Why!!!

your soul has felt the effects of April poppy fields or
Lagunita au claire de la lune, and you have reacted
poetically, send in your little ones.
Our column is going to be as readable as Beatrice
Fairfax, The Gumps, Geraldine, and the Sporting Green,
all put together, and more so if all you Stanford Sisters
express and pass on to us exactly what you think about
things.
This is our Queendom. But I have a great, generous,
and joyous hunch that the Campus Kings and Jacks
will derive quite as much eager enjoyment from read
ing this column as we shall fro mwriting it.
Remember that this portion of the Daily is dedicated
to us carte blanche, literally and metaphorically speak
ing.
Rmember that the Masculine Majority insists that
Stanford Women have only a feeble and fast-fading
interest in Campus affairs. So here's our chance to show
'em we have ideas, that we do think, and What and
Where and When and Why!!!
(This column will appear every Tuesday. Communications
should be addressed to Ruth Mcßride, Campus. The names
of writers will be withheld on request.)
Well!
Good-evening, Sisters! Did you know that the benefi
cent and genial editors of the Daily Palo Alto have
decided to give us a whole column in which we may one
and all express our own peculiar opinions? Perhaps not
till now. But know it herewith.
Think of it! a quarter of a page weekly is dedicated
to the feminine viewpoint. Herein we may declare, state,
profess, or narrate concerning any subject under the
sun, be it hairpins or hearts, politics or powder-puffs,
babies or bacteriology.
What nice little discussions and concussions we are
going to have! Since this is strictly No Man's Land we
shall have some salubrious skirmishes and beautiful
bombardments. If you have cherished some college
criticism, 10, these many years since froshhood. Stately
Seniors, speak out! Propound your pet problems, Juniors
and Sophomores. Even the fragile freshwomen may air
their tender budding thoughts here, too.
This column is going to be one popular pourri of
feminine facts and fancies. Not necessarily lady-like but
feminine above all.
If you have just finished an excellent book and believe
that the other Four Hundred and Ninety-Nine should
read it, too, to round out their girlish lives, recommend
it. If you have discovered a superior method of swim
ming, singing, fighting, or writing, commend it. If you
have solved any problems racial, spacial, or even facial,
let the rest of us in on the secret, right here. And if
your soul has felt the effects of April poppy fields or
Lagunita au claire de la lune, and you have reacted
poetically, send in your little ones.
