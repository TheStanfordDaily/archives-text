# Progress Via the Jail
## 
### 
And now comes some one in the Saturday Evening
Post who, in calm, rational tones, informs us that hazing
(at least as practiced at Annapolis) has its place in
an academic program. Of course the man should he
hung, and that at once, before his dangerous common
sense can germinate; but let us investigate the charges.
Appended to his long list of "pleb grinds" (long
enough and varied enough to make the most accom
plished sophomore green with envy), is the disarmingly
simple statement, that youth needs to be made men of.
This is disheartening after all our efforts to make
intelligentia of them. But the author of this article
seems to feel that one of the best ways of turning out
men is to torture them first, even as iron is tortured
into steel. And he doesn't say a word about the intelli
gentia.
Let us keep people who believe such things down, or
they will clamor at our gates for our heads. We believe
in personal freedom; and we have pledged ourselves to
accept the consequences. That we have, is shown in
our admiration of Marx who debauched the science of
politics, in our approval of Billy Sunday who made
religious intelligence among the common people forever
impossible, and in our reverent awe toward the psycho
analysts who, proudly led by Freud, have vulgarized our
instincts at their pleasure.
No man is intelligent who, at some time or other, did
not have a wrong idea, in which he believed, knocked
out of his head. But we, like little children fond of ALL
the jam, have inherited from Nietzsche and his disciples,
the popular superstition that all progress is by way of
the jaiI.â€”DOWNING McGALLON.
