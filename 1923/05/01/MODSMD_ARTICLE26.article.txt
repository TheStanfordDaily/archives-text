# Just Looking Around

### 
Even Adam must have known that
it was impolite to stare and point his
finger at people, but civilization has
acquired a veneer since Adam's time.
Nowadays people are too lazy to point,
but the modern method of staring is
simply marvelous. It is impossible to
know when people are looking at you.
"My dear," says critical Susie to
Jane, "don't look around now, but I
want you to see that slick-looking fel
low Georgia is talking to."
Whereupon Jane waits about a half
second, looks indifferently around the
room, cooly surveys Georgia, and then
replies, "Hum, she surely has im
proved since she was a freshman!"
Pretty clever. You'd never suspect
this was a camouflage stare.
Then there's the man who wants to
see the young lady who is walking be
hind him; so he accidentally on pur
pose drops his fountain pen. He be
comes so engrossed in looking at the
interesting maid that his fingers grope
on the ground, and he finally has to
divert his attention from the feminine
spectacle to find the darn pen.
New isn't that a marvelous ruse, and
the young lady would never know!
"Dance faster, Bobby," says Betty.
"I want to see the girl Jack is with!"
And Bobby, anxious to please, does
a double-quick step to the syncopa

| tion. Upon reaching the unsuspecting
Jack, Bobby does a hesitation until
Betty has completed her inspection.
- Some improvement over just plain
| crude staring!
But every one has his own way of
doing things. The ingenuous damsel
pulls out her vanity case and pretends
to be powdering her nose when she
is really using her mirror to look at
the man in back of her. But she ap
plies her powder-puff so slowly that
it reminds one of a workman who is
anxious to do a good job of white
washing a fence.
This method of staring is absolutely
the acme of perfection. Higher educa
tion certainly develops initiative!
