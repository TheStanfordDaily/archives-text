# Campus Sleuths Fail To Fathom Mystery Of Promiscuous "1's"

'\ hose "IV plastered on campus roads, j
trees and telephone poles, stand for the j
beginning of a new era in the world's

ber "1" handbills stuck around the cam- j
pus last night. He offers some sugges- I
tions:

the killing of the first jackrabbit 011 the
Stanford campus.
The "1" stands for a new brand of
saleable goods, like the Eskimo pic or
the jacquctte. That is, an advertizing
method like M. J. B. Coffee. Why?
