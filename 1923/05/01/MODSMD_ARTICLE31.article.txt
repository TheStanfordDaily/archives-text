# UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA IS MUCH LIKE STANFORD--ROTH

"The University of Arizona is per
haps of all western universities most like
Stanford in its position and its cus
toms," Comptroller Roth remarked today
in speaking of impressions received dur
ing his trip to the "Wild Cats'" univer
sity last week when Cloyd Heck Mar
vin, Stanford ex-'lO, was inaugurated
as president.
"Arizona is a truly western college,
free and frank. The student body is a
genuine, wholesome-looking crowd; most
of the men and women have been raised
on ranches and are pleasingly informal,"
Roth said. By way of illustration of this
informality, Roth mentioned the univer
sity swimming tank, located in the center
of the campus apart from the gymna
siums, and frequented by both men and
women. "Like Stanford, the University
of Arizona campus is located near a
small town. The students—there are
about 1500 now—live on the campus—in
dormitories, fraternity and sorority
houses."
Roth, who was one of Stanford's best
athletes, and is still an enthusiastic fol
lower of college sports, spoke of the
"Wild Cats'" athletic conditions. "Ari

zona has had strong football and good
baseball teams the last few years," he
said. "Hhey are just starting up track.
They have been handicapped because the
secondary schools haven't gone in for
this sport, but now they are promoting
track and attempting to get Arizona high
schools to follow suit. Because of the
climate, they may develop some wonder
ful track athletes; not only do the men
get the benefit of the Arizona climate
but they can train all year round."
"The university is wisely featuring the
departments which are best suited to its
location." Roth stated. "The schools of
mining and agriculture are very strong."
The Colorado River offers opportunity
to develop much of the semi-arid land in
the state; preparation for this type of
work is given in these schools. The
School of Commerce is receiving special
attention now. Arizona is in close rela
tions with Latin American because of its
stragetic position on the routes into
Mexico, so Spanish is particularly
stressed in the commercial education.
The Stuart Observatory, recently erected,
is one of the finest in the country be
cause of the clearness of the Arizona
air, Roth said.
