# Cheers! This Is May Day, But What of It? It Comes Every Year
##

Every year about this time the edi
tor rips a sheet off the calendar and
says, "Hey, you—write a feature on
May Day!"
Well, here it is. Back in New York
state the last little bit of snow is run
ning down the Hudson into the bay,
and out here Dad is tuning up the
Hudson and it snow joke, to employ
a pun. The month is rife with un
certainty. The rough May queen to
Junior Week, the May Queen must
queen, and the ordinary queen May
get queened and she May not. The
poppies will keep right on popping
just the same, so what does it all
mean? Nothing—only it's May day.
