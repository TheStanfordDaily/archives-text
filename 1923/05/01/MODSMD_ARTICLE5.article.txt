# MASQUE COSTUMES MUST BE ORDERED BEFORE TOMORROW
## Decoration, Entertainment Plans Under Way for Friday Carnival 
### 
Costumes for the Carnival Masque
must be ordered before noon tomor
row if the students wish time for
changes by Friday evening. Masks
from the Deßecat company are on sale
in the Women's Clubhouse on the third
floor where costume orders are taken.
Everyone must have a mask to gain
entrance to the carnival Friday eve
ning.
The Pavilion is being transformed
for the high jinks into a fairyland of
color. Rainbow-hued streamers at
tached to wires converging at a point
near the ceiling will give the effect of
a huge tent. Vari-colored lights above
the balconies and four grinning masks,
concealing the corner lights, will add
the requisite futuristic touches. The
thrones of the king and queen will be
placed at one end of the Pavilion, the
stage and musicians at the other. Pot
ted plants along the sides of the court,
reaching up to the balconies, will af
ford a contrasting background for the
many-colored costumes of the dancers.
Sam Mendenhall, in charge of en
tertainment, is planning a number of
chorus and solo stunts in addition to
an elaborate coronation ceremony.
Mendenhall has secured special per
mission to use one of Paul Ash's new
songs and is introducing an original
$ance to the campus. Lighting for the
divertissements will be handled by
Ernest Greppin and Ed Farmer has
charge of stage properties.
The grand march, which will open
the carnival at 9 o'clock, will be a
rollicki-ng, puzzling affair —guaranteed
to tangle everyone up so thoroughly
he won't know where he is heading.
The leaders of the promenade, who
will be chosen because of their ex
perience, will have the biggest job
of the evening—starting things off so
well that they can't possibly go wrong.
Refreshments will be in charge of
the Women's Clubhouse Board for the
benefit of the Clubhouse fund. Punch,
with a kick in it, ices, and sweetmeats j
will be served by costumed members
of the women's "S" society. The
"filling station" will be located at the
kitchen near the end entrance to the
Pavilion.
