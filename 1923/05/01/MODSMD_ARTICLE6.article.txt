# JUNIORS SHOW FIGHT AND DOWN SENIORS IN SOCCER GAME, 1-0
## 
### 
Junior soccer players defeated the sen
ior fifteen yesterday afternoon 1-0, in
the second game of the interclass soccer
series to determine the class champions
of the University. The seniors were
favored to win in as much as they had
eight or ryne varsity soccer men on their
team, but the junior aggregation showed
surprising strength and put up a fine
fight.
From the start of the game, the ball
was in the possession of the juniors and
only once or twice did the seniors
threaten their opponents' goal. All the
men showed the lack of conditioning and
training, and at the end of the fifty-min
ute period were completely exhausted.
Mum ford and Swayne played a good
game for the juniors, while Titus, Peavy,
and Green did well for the seniors.
The third game of the series will be
played tomorrow afternoon between the
freshmen and the seniors. The juniors
and the sophomores will play off the
fourth game to decide the University
championship on Friday afternoon. The
results of these games will be chalked up
to the credit of the various classes in the
interclass competition in all sports.
