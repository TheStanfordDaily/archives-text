(Special Dispatch)
CLEVELAND, May 1. — Albert C.
White, a junior at Stanford University,
retained the senior national fancy diving
title, won by him last year, by defeating
a large field of entries in the A. A. U.
championships here last night.
White's individual score of 698.4 gave
him less than a two-point margin over
the runner-up, Pat Young, of Cleveland.
The victory of the western diver will
give Stanford second place in the na
tional swimming championships, with
twenty-one points. Stanford had already
taken a second place in the national
water-polo championships at Chicago, and
had placed in the relay. The only other
universities entering, Yale and North
western, finished fifth and sixth respec
tively.
The showing of the title-holder im
pressed the large crowd of aquatic fol
lowers who had gathered to watch the
championship.

For the sixth time in four years, a
Stanford diver, coached by Ernst Brand
sten, has won a championship, of na
tional rating or better. White's victory
last night brought the sixth championship,
and also assures a seventh, since White
is still in his junior year at the Uni
versity.
In 1920, Clarence Pinkston, of Stan

ford, won the world's diving champion
ship at the Olympic games, representing
the United States. Later, he won the
national senior A. A. U. title. The fol
lowing year, besides numerous minor

titles, Pinkston again, won the national
senior A. A. U. championship, which is
now held by White.
In 1922, Al White first came into
prominence, when he defeated his team


Al White, Diving Champion
mate, Pinkston, and again won the na
tional title for Stanford. At the same
time, he won the outdoor tank diving
championship. Last night, when White
successfully defended his title, the sixth
national championship was won by Stan
ford.
White's diving has been not only spec
tacular, but steady as well. Probably no I
other diver today, gets as much ease of I
motion into his diving as does White. I
In all of his dives, he has an exceedingly
springy take-off, which is rare. White

hits the water cleanly, no matter from
what difficult angle.
An interesting fact, is that another of
the entrants in the championships at
Cleveland was Louis Balbach, of Colum
bia, who was trained by Coach Brand
sten at Stanford in 1916. Since that time,
Balbach has made quite a name for him
self in the East.
