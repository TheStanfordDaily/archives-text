CLEVELAND, May 1. — Albert C.
White, a junior at Stanford University,
retained the senior national fancy diving
title, won by him last year, by defeating
a large field of entries in the A. A. U.
championships here last night.
White's individual score of 698.4 gave
him less than a two-point margin over
the runner-up, Pat Young, of Cleveland.
The victory of the western diver will
give Stanford second place in the na
tional swimming championships, with
twenty-one points. Stanford had already
taken a second place in the national
water-polo championships at Chicago, and
had placed in the relay. The only other
universities entering, Yale and North
western, finished fifth and sixth respec
tively.
The showing of the title-holder im
pressed the large crowd of aquatic fol
lowers who had gathered to watch the
championship.

Stanford diver, coached by Ernst Brand

tional rating or better. White's victory
last night brought the sixth championship,
and also assures a seventh, since White
is still in his junior year at the Uni
versity.

lowing year, besides numerous minor

titles, Pinkston again, won the national
senior A. A. U. championship, which is
now held by White.
