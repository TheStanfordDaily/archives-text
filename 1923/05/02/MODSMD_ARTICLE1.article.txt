Four fast divertissements and the
coronation ceremony will provide ten
minute interludes in the dancing program
at the Carnival Masque Friday evening.
Sam Mendenhall, chairman of the en
tertainment committee, has secured new
and clever songs for his chorus of fifty,
and is introducing an original dance to
the campus public.
Augusta Corey, who, in the role of
court jester, will read the entertainment
prologue, is the author of the song used
in the first divertissement, "Masquerade."
This will be an ensemble of the ten en
tertainers and the twenty-five showgirls
and steppers.
Charles Stratton, singing "When You
and I were Young, Maggie, Blues," will
be accompanied by a chorus of twenty
five old-fashioned maids and twenty-five
jazz-babies. The former will descend a
winding stairway in the appropriately
demure manner while their modern coun
terparts will come down a slide. This
song is used by Paul Ash at the Granada
and Mendenhall secured his special per
mission to stage it at the carnival, as it
will not go on sale in the West for some j
two months. The second part of this!
number will be "Wild Flower," a song'
from Arthur Hammerstein's new musi-1
cal play of the same name. Eight chorus j
showgirls, costumed as various wild- j
flowers, will appear in this divertisse-|
ment.
"Marcheta," sung by Cuthbert Tibbe to !
a Gypsy dance by Jessie Herron, will j
open the third ten-minute entertainment. 1
"Wanita," a hit from the "Passing Show I
of 1922," with the chorus of fifty, is the ]
second part of this show. Jerry Powell j
and Mabel Ferry, in the final number,!
appear in a comedy dance singing l
"Bambalina," from "The Wild Flower."!
Margaret Mackay as "The Fiddler" fol- j
lows their duet. The concluding num- j
her is an Italian specialty with a sur- j
prise attached, sung by Charles Sorter, !
Lawrence Willerd, William Tempel, and'
Harold Spaulding.

gram follows:
