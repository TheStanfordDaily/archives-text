# ROUGHS ARE MORE VAIN THAN CO-EDS, IS NEWEST CHARGE
## 
### 
Is the Stanford rough, with his tat
tered cords, size 14 shoes, and unshaven
face, more vain than the Stanford co-ed?
The members of Wranglers woman's
debating society contend that he is. They
declare that they will prove their asser
tions beyond a shadow of a doubt whfÂ»n
they argue the question with Nestoria
Debating Society tomorrow night in
Room 12 of the Law building. The
Nestorians, on the other hand, will not
concede defeat, especially when the honor
of the Stanford rough hinges on the out
come of the dispute.
Following the debate, a team of
Wranglers' freshmen will meet Nes
toria's freshmen in an old-fashioned
spelling bee.
