# BILL TO MAKE GAME RESERVE OF STANFORD PROPERTY FORWARDED
## Arboretum May Be Extended to Searsville; Ruling Would Bar All Firearms From Campus Unless by Special Permit. 
### 
Implying the likelihood that Stanford will become the only University in
the world established within a game reserve, Assembly Bill 205, containing
clauses to establish the Stanford lands as fish and game district 3-G, has been
referred to the State Legislature's standing committee on fish and game.
With the probable extension of the arboretum in the future to Searsville
ake, together with complete protection which prohibits "hunting, pursuing,
taking, killing, or destroying or having in possession any speceis of bird or
mammal," the Stanford Farm will become a refuge for all wild life.

» As a basis for a game reserve Stan
ford has 8500 acres of land in one
piece, containing two lakes, for water
fowl, lowlands for quail, pheasants,
small birds and game, and foothills
with considerable timber and brush,
which would serve as a good ranging
ground for larger game.
Wild life was in the early days of
the University much more abundant
than it is now. Deer were known to
range over the hills around Searsville
lake and the Portola country, quail
covered the University lawns in large
flocks, and the underbrush in the ar
boretum was filled with various spe
cies of small birds.
With the protection offered by the
state, game is expected to multiply
rapidly.
In the past few years there has been
considerable promiscuous shooting on
the University property. In the foot
hills practically all the larger game
has been killed off, while on the cam
pus quail and rabbits have been shot.
Not long ago several men drove in a
machine up to the hill on which the
President's house stands, shot several
small bunches of quail, and drove
away before they could be identified..
According to laborers at the University
nursery, two or three peacocks which
live about the gardens have been
killed recently.
Not only will the Stanford Farm bo
the most accessible game reserve in
the state, but it will offer unusual ad
vantages for study. It is probably the
only game reserve in the world with
a fully-equipped zoology department
within its confines. Here careful
studies can be made of the habits of
wild animals. For example, detailed
research such as the study of the ef
fect of an increased number of birds
upon plant and insect life can be made
by zoology classes—study which the
state could hardly afford to undertake.
No firearms may be carried on any
of the lands, or on the campus, unless
special permission is obtained from the
official game commissioner. Fine for
violation would be not more than $2f>
nor less than $5.
The Stanford Zoology Club has ably
assisted in the effort to secure the
game reserve, preparing evidence and
suggesting many advantages to be
gained by game protection.
Whether the University property b«v
comes a game reserve depends upon
the passage by the Legislature of Bill
205, which contains all fish and game
provisions for the year.

piece, containing two lakes, for water
fowl, lowlands for quail, pheasants,
small birds and game, and foothills
with considerable timber and brush,
which would serve as a good ranging
ground for larger game.
Wild life was in the early days of
the University much more abundant
than it is now. Deer were known to
range over the hills around Searsville
lake and the Portola country, quail
covered the University lawns in large
flocks, and the underbrush in the ar
boretum was filled with various spe
cies of small birds.
With the protection offered by the
state, game is expected to multiply
rapidly.
In the past few years there has been
considerable promiscuous shooting on
the University property. In the foot
hills practically all the larger game
has been killed off, while on the cam
pus quail and rabbits have been shot.
Not long ago several men drove in a
machine up to the hill on which the
President's house stands, shot several
small bunches of quail, and drove
away before they could be identified..
According to laborers at the University
nursery, two or three peacocks which
live about the gardens have been
killed recently.
Not only will the Stanford Farm bo
the most accessible game reserve in
the state, but it will offer unusual ad
vantages for study. It is probably the
only game reserve in the world with
a fully-equipped zoology department
within its confines. Here careful
studies can be made of the habits of
wild animals. For example, detailed
research such as the study of the ef
fect of an increased number of birds
upon plant and insect life can be made
by zoology classes—study which the
state could hardly afford to undertake.
No firearms may be carried on any
of the lands, or on the campus, unless
special permission is obtained from the
official game commissioner. Fine for
violation would be not more than $2f>
nor less than $5.
The Stanford Zoology Club has ably
assisted in the effort to secure the
game reserve, preparing evidence and
suggesting many advantages to be
gained by game protection.
Whether the University property b«v
comes a game reserve depends upon
the passage by the Legislature of Bill
205, which contains all fish and game
provisions for the year.
Implying the likelihood that Stanford will become the only University in
the world established within a game reserve, Assembly Bill 205, containing
clauses to establish the Stanford lands as fish and game district 3-G, has been
referred to the State Legislature's standing committee on fish and game.
With the probable extension of the arboretum in the future to Searsville
ake, together with complete protection which prohibits "hunting, pursuing,
taking, killing, or destroying or having in possession any speceis of bird or
mammal," the Stanford Farm will become a refuge for all wild life.
