# EIGHT TEAMS MEET IN BALL GAMES FOR INTRAMURAL SERIES
## 
### 
Some first-class baseball dope was
upset yesterday when two of the sup
posedly weak teams came through and
beat their opponents in intramural
baseball games. Sigma Chi romped
over El Capitan 23-0. Kappa Alpha
beat Theta Chi 22-12, and Phi Kappa
Sigma lost to Sigma Alpha Epsilon
8-0. The closest game was between
Beta Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon. The
latter won by a 2-1 score.
The Kappa Alpha team overcame
their losing streak and by superior hit
ting and fielding beat the Theta Chi
team. Kappa Alpha was able to hit
anything that the Theta Chi chuckers
offered, while the latter had difficulty
in finding the fast deliveries of Mow
ers, the Kappa Alpha pitcher. Lake of
the Kappa Alpha team was first man
up and he started the parade by pound
ing out a homer.
Summy Pitches Good Game
Summy, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
hurler, had the Phi Kappa Sigma team
helpless under his baffling delivery.
The game was marred by a few errors,
but some clever fielding on both sides
made up for the fumbles. Frye and
Wright worked together on the mound
for the Phi Kaps, but neither of them
had enough on the ball to deceive the
S. A. E. batters.
The nearest approach to a track
meet was held when the Sigma Chi
sluggers battered their way to a 23-0
victory over El Capitan in a three
inning massacre. Campbell pitched for
Sigma Chi, and held El Capitan score
less, while their batters hit anything
and everything that came over the
plate. It was useless to go on with the
game after the third inning.
Betas in Close Game
The closest contest of the day was
played between the Beta Theta Pi,
and the Delta Upsilon teams on dia
mond 4. The game was featured by
clever playing on the part of both
teams. Mertz, pitching for the Betas,
allowed the D. U.'s eight hits, while
Hyland, heaving against the Betas,
only allowed them two hits. There
were no errors on the part of the
Delta Upsilon team and Beta Theta Pi
men made only two bobbles. Richards,
D. U. first sacker, made two hits in
two trips to the bat. Mertz made the
only tally for the Betas when he
slammed out a homer with none on
base. For lack of time the game only
went to five innings.
Today the following games will be
played: El Tigre vs. Alpha Tau Omega,
Breakers vs. Sigma Nu, Delta Kappa
Epsilon vs. Sequoia First, and Phi
Gamma Delta vs. Kappa Sigma.

Summy, the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
hurler, had the Phi Kappa Sigma team
helpless under his baffling delivery.
The game was marred by a few errors,
but some clever fielding on both sides
made up for the fumbles. Frye and
Wright worked together on the mound
for the Phi Kaps, but neither of them
had enough on the ball to deceive the
S. A. E. batters.
The nearest approach to a track
meet was held when the Sigma Chi
sluggers battered their way to a 23-0
victory over El Capitan in a three
inning massacre. Campbell pitched for
Sigma Chi, and held El Capitan score
less, while their batters hit anything
and everything that came over the
plate. It was useless to go on with the
game after the third inning.
Betas in Close Game
The closest contest of the day was
played between the Beta Theta Pi,
and the Delta Upsilon teams on dia
mond 4. The game was featured by
clever playing on the part of both
teams. Mertz, pitching for the Betas,
allowed the D. U.'s eight hits, while
Hyland, heaving against the Betas,
only allowed them two hits. There
were no errors on the part of the
Delta Upsilon team and Beta Theta Pi
men made only two bobbles. Richards,
D. U. first sacker, made two hits in
two trips to the bat. Mertz made the
only tally for the Betas when he
slammed out a homer with none on
base. For lack of time the game only
went to five innings.
Today the following games will be
played: El Tigre vs. Alpha Tau Omega,
Breakers vs. Sigma Nu, Delta Kappa
Epsilon vs. Sequoia First, and Phi
Gamma Delta vs. Kappa Sigma.
Some first-class baseball dope was
upset yesterday when two of the sup
posedly weak teams came through and
beat their opponents in intramural
baseball games. Sigma Chi romped
over El Capitan 23-0. Kappa Alpha
beat Theta Chi 22-12, and Phi Kappa
Sigma lost to Sigma Alpha Epsilon
8-0. The closest game was between
Beta Theta Pi and Delta Upsilon. The
latter won by a 2-1 score.
The Kappa Alpha team overcame
their losing streak and by superior hit
ting and fielding beat the Theta Chi
team. Kappa Alpha was able to hit
anything that the Theta Chi chuckers
offered, while the latter had difficulty
in finding the fast deliveries of Mow
ers, the Kappa Alpha pitcher. Lake of
the Kappa Alpha team was first man
up and he started the parade by pound
ing out a homer.
