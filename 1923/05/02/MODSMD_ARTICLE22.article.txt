# THE 						ETERNAL CIRCLE
## 
### 
There is a steadily increasing spirit of tolerance on
the campus. The fact is easily evident to anyone
who has been at Stanford for the average four-year
period or more.
The eternal circle still exists,*with each man point
ing out the weaknesses in those on each side of him
â€”but it is the finger of friendly fun more than of
vituperation.
The lines which could be drawn between the un
flinching rough and the thorough-going snake, the
"high-brow" and the "low-brow," faculty and stu
dents, men and women, reformers and objects of
reform, athletes and scholars, Greeks and "barbs,",
the other self-sufficient and arbitrary classifications
which students had created for themselves, seem to
be becoming less distinct. One does not have to don
rose-colored spectacles to observe that it is easier
to meet on a common ground that it was a few years
ago. Stanford democracy is a phrase that really
has a meaning and the alumnus who is alleged to
have told Upton Sinclair that the old spirit is gone
ought to spend a few days on the campus getting ac
quainted again. Naturally he could not expect to
return to college several years after his graduation
and break right into things where he left off. It
takes time.to form associations, even with the in
centive of a common alma mater, but once they are
formed, who is to say that they are any less genuine
today than yesterday?
Criticism still exists. Each group unhesitatingly
expresses its disagreement with the principles and
actions of the other. Which is as it should be. But
that criticism is tempered with laughter more than
with bitterness. Which is also as it should be.
