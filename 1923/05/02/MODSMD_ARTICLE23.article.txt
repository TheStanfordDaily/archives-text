"M. S. C. that English Club be directed to take
every step possible to meet the deficit incurred by
the off-campus production of 'Will Shakespeare.' "
It is to be hoped the above extract from last night's
Executive Committee meeting will prove more than
a mere entry in the student body records. It has been
a habit of many organizations to acquire debts which,
because of the rapidly changing personnel of a col
lege group, soon become lodestones about the necks
of those who were not responsible in incurring them.
English Club has not been the least of such offenders
and at the present time the Spectator is attempting
to pay off obligations of the old Cardinal. On9 of
the provisions in the English Club-Press Club agree
ment upon the consolidation of the publications of
the two bodies was that profits from the English
Club play would aid in clearing up the financial situ
ation. The results show that to have been a fond
hope. Ambition seems to have clouded discretion.
This brings up the problem of the organizations,
which, having no way of raising funds except
through individual assessment, are faced each spring
with the problem of paying for their pictures in the
Quad. The opportunities for spending money are
far in excess of those for earning it, and it is a wise
group that can handle its activities in such a manner
as to hand over a clean ledger to its successors.
