In view of the fact that interest in public speaking
seems to be rapidly falling off, why not adopt a plan
calculated to arouse interest in this noble indoor sport
in the minds of all but the rock-bound of human beings?
Something, for instance, like this:
"The public-speaking contest was opened with a short
song hit, 'I've Got the Awfullest Pay Check Blues,' ren
dered by Miss Lottie Lotta, following which the Six
Green Cousins gave a wonderfully soul-stirring episode
of Jews-harps.
"McGunkus, who upheld the affirmative, 'Resolved,
That prohibition jokes should be barred from musical
comedies,' showed the injurious effect likely to result
from continued use of such narcotics. The negative team
was a little late, but after getting pepped up by listening
to a phonograph for a few minutes, they succeeded in
successfully combatting their opponents' arguments by
proving that prohibition jokes were the only kind that
people would laugh at while sober, thus encouraging the
dry element. The debate ended in a free-for-all, two of
the judges escaping."

In view of the fact that interest in public speaking
seems to be rapidly falling off, why not adopt a plan
calculated to arouse interest in this noble indoor sport
in the minds of all but the rock-bound of human beings?
Something, for instance, like this:
"The public-speaking contest was opened with a short
song hit, 'I've Got the Awfullest Pay Check Blues,' ren
dered by Miss Lottie Lotta, following which the Six
Green Cousins gave a wonderfully soul-stirring episode
of Jews-harps.
"McGunkus, who upheld the affirmative, 'Resolved,
That prohibition jokes should be barred from musical
comedies,' showed the injurious effect likely to result
from continued use of such narcotics. The negative team
was a little late, but after getting pepped up by listening
to a phonograph for a few minutes, they succeeded in
successfully combatting their opponents' arguments by
proving that prohibition jokes were the only kind that
people would laugh at while sober, thus encouraging the
dry element. The debate ended in a free-for-all, two of
the judges escaping."
