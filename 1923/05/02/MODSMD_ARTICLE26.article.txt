# ON BEING RADICAL

### 
"Being radical is a duty, like casting your first ballot,
or kissing your sisters," editorially remarks the Daily
lowan, an esteemed contemporary from the Middle West.
"Don't be afraid to be radical," the editorial writer
urges: we are rock-ribbed, dyed-in-the-wool intellectual
standpatters. Worst of all, we are proud of it. We need
atheists, free-lovers, anarchists, free-traders, royalists,
socialists, anti-Christians. Revolt is a healthy sign.
Only a man of fifty has a right to be conservative. The
conservative at twenty, is an intellectual petrification at
fifty. Being radical when you are young is safe. No
radical ever ruined the world. You can't ruin the world.
The conservatives have done their best, and the darn
thing is evidently fool-proof." And much more of the
same, ad infinitum, or, as William Lyon Phelps would
probably say, ad nauseam.
Behind the consciously breezy diction of the rugged
westerner suffering from Walt Whitmania, is the agon
ized call to youth to think —of something, anything, or
everything, but at least to substitute intellectual activity
of some sort for that of mental atrophy so prominent in
our educational institutions, an atrophy of which Pro
fessor Creighton recently stated chalking the sidewalks
was typical, and, in a sense, symbolical. To question, to
doubt, or to criticize, is to live; to accept our opinions
in pre-digested form is merely to exist.
On the other hand, we find Middlebury College re
quiring every student there enrolled to take part in
some form of extra-curriculum activity. President Moody,
in explaining this new rule, confidently asserted: "The
student who is content to do nothing for his college
never makes a good citizen!" And the measure of "doing
something for your college" is to be in extra-curriculum
activity.
Vermont, according to Ambassador Harvey, is a ter
restrial paradise, and the cultured New Englander would
probably look down on lowa as a state of hogs and corn.
Still, the per capita literacy is higher in lowa than in
Vermont, and the intelligence displayed in university
communities appears to be at least as great.—Cornell
