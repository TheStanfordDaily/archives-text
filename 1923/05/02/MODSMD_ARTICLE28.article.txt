# Students Haven't Changed

The flat-car escapade is well-known in
early Stanford history.
The event occurred on a mild day in
November, 1892, when a large number of
students happened to pass by a flat-car
standing on a spur track of the Southern
Pacific. The opportunity was a golden
one and not to be overlooked.
As many as could find room, crowded
on the car. The rest clung to the sides
and ends. The brakes were loosened, and
then to the new college yell:
Wah-hoo, Wah-hoo,
L. S. J. U.â€”Stanford,
the car gained motion and started down
the track. But the speed soon became too
rapid for pleasure, and the car was
stopped near the Palo Alto station by
means of the hand-brake. The students
tramped back to Encina, well satisfied
with their labor.
An empty flat-car was reported missing
the following morning. The division sup
erintendent was notified and men were
sent to trace it. When the car was
finally discovered, an engine from San
Jose hauled it back to its original place.
Senator Stanford was far from
pleased when he heard of the incident,
and ordered that all students who had
taken part, be expelled. Over 200 stu
dents, over half of the University attend
ance, would have been banished, had the
rule become effective. At it was, Mrs.
Stanford interceded for the "wah-hoocrs"
and induced her husband to withdraw his
edict.
