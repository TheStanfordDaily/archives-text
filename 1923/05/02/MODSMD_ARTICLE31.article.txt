# SPRING FOOTBALL BRINGS OUT PROMISING MATERIAL
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
"That fellow comes from a place
where they know how to tackle."
"He runs just like Jack Patrick."
"You can't stop that fellow with a
dozen tackles."
"Se that guard break through there.
Who is he?"
Such are the remarks heard on the
old lootball field these days during
the final week of the spring practice
session under the careful guidance of
Coach "Pop" Warner and his assist
ants, Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill.
Players stand around and gape at the
perfoi mance of their mates and when
their chance comes, they go in and
beat that performance. The same five
or six teams that have been out all
spring are still working, but many
husky players who should be on the
field in grid togs have failed to show
up yet. Coach Warner expressed him
self yesterday as pleased with the
turnout for the spring session, but he
laid emphasis on the fact that although
some new faces are on the field there
are a good many old faces that should
be out there rounding into shape.
This spring practice is the force
that will give momentum to a flying
start next fall and a number of new
plays are being worked out by the
coaches for use during the coming
season. One of the forward pass plays
which is being developed was given
by "Pop" to his Pittsburgh athletes
last year and was used for the first
time against the Cardinal warriors on
New Year's, Day. Its success was es
tablished by both the Stanford and
Pittsburgh aggregations.
Every day at least two teams are
put through a stiff scrimmage and
about once a week all the men have a
chance at a little team practice. There
are six completely organized elevens

each with its own definitely deter
mined players. Yesterday "Pop" put
two teams through a half-hour scrim
mage and then sent them to the
showers, via the tackling dummy
route. He then took another pair of
teams, and ended the day's practice
session with the third act.
Several men put up a particularly
good game during the scrimmage, al
though no one man was a consistent
star. One side would make several
lengthy gains, then would lose the
ball, and the other team would rush
the oval back to the starting point.
Ludeke showed some real mid-season
stuff when he stopped all the plays
sent around him, making some good
tackles back of the line of scrimmage.
Van Hook played his place at center
to advantage and broke through for
several tackles besides putting up a
strong offensive. McDermont could
not be boxed and was able to force
the runs inside of his end where the
tackle snagged the runner.
In the backfield were several scin- 1
filiating performers. Hey tore big
holes in the line and by pretty revers
ing of field and made some equally
good gains on clever plunging. Kelley
had the most terrific charge of any of
the backfield men and his line-bucks
were good for yards most any time.
Ryan and Dunmire also did some good
defensive work in the backfield, get
ting their men every time by hard,
clean tackles.
Every man is givep an opportunity
to show the coaches just what his
capabilities are and a number of new
men have been discovered during the
spring workouts. Warner said yester
day that the material as a whole ap
pears to have a better knowledge of
football than a year ago and he feels
encouraged at the development.

about once a week all the men have a
chance at a little team practice. There
are six completely organized elevens

each with its own definitely deter
mined players. Yesterday "Pop" put
two teams through a half-hour scrim
mage and then sent them to the
showers, via the tackling dummy
route. He then took another pair of
teams, and ended the day's practice
session with the third act.
Several men put up a particularly
good game during the scrimmage, al
though no one man was a consistent
star. One side would make several
lengthy gains, then would lose the
ball, and the other team would rush
the oval back to the starting point.
Ludeke showed some real mid-season
stuff when he stopped all the plays
sent around him, making some good
tackles back of the line of scrimmage.
Van Hook played his place at center
to advantage and broke through for
several tackles besides putting up a
strong offensive. McDermont could
not be boxed and was able to force
the runs inside of his end where the
tackle snagged the runner.
In the backfield were several scin- 1
filiating performers. Hey tore big
holes in the line and by pretty revers
ing of field and made some equally
good gains on clever plunging. Kelley
had the most terrific charge of any of
the backfield men and his line-bucks
were good for yards most any time.
Ryan and Dunmire also did some good
defensive work in the backfield, get
ting their men every time by hard,
clean tackles.
Every man is givep an opportunity
to show the coaches just what his
capabilities are and a number of new
men have been discovered during the
spring workouts. Warner said yester
day that the material as a whole ap
pears to have a better knowledge of
football than a year ago and he feels
encouraged at the development.
"That fellow comes from a place
where they know how to tackle."
"He runs just like Jack Patrick."
"You can't stop that fellow with a
dozen tackles."
"Se that guard break through there.
Who is he?"
Such are the remarks heard on the
old lootball field these days during
the final week of the spring practice
session under the careful guidance of
Coach "Pop" Warner and his assist
ants, Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill.
Players stand around and gape at the
perfoi mance of their mates and when
their chance comes, they go in and
beat that performance. The same five
or six teams that have been out all
spring are still working, but many
husky players who should be on the
field in grid togs have failed to show
up yet. Coach Warner expressed him
self yesterday as pleased with the
turnout for the spring session, but he
laid emphasis on the fact that although
some new faces are on the field there
are a good many old faces that should
be out there rounding into shape.
This spring practice is the force
that will give momentum to a flying
start next fall and a number of new
plays are being worked out by the
coaches for use during the coming
season. One of the forward pass plays
which is being developed was given
by "Pop" to his Pittsburgh athletes
last year and was used for the first
time against the Cardinal warriors on
New Year's, Day. Its success was es
tablished by both the Stanford and
Pittsburgh aggregations.
