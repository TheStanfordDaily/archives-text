# Public Speaking Contest To Decide Winner of Cup
## 
### 
The annual public speaking contest for
the Euphronia-Nestoria cup is to be
merged with the tryouts for the oratori
cal contest of the Southern California
Citizens' Committee, according to Ed
ward Landels, '22, chairman of the stu
dent debating committee.
This action was made necessary be
cause of the small number entering the
public speaking contest. Up to Tuesday
morning, only one contestant had en
tered his name with Debating Ad
viser Emerson. Most of the interest cen
ters in the tryouts for the oratorical con
test and this accounts for the small num
ber of entries, according to the debating
adviser.
The combined contest will be held on
May 15 in the Little Theater. The com
mittee on public exercises has scheduled
the contest as one of its regular Tuesday
evening offerings. The general subject
will be, "The Constitution, Our Citadel
of Freedom." Those who intend to try
out should hand their names to the de
bating adviser immediately so that ar
rangements may be made for an elimina
tion tryout, if necessary. ffl
