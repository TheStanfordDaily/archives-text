# Y.M.C.A. TO HOLD SUMMER COURSE IN SOCIAL PROBLEMS
## 
### 
Stanford students will be offered an
opportunity to study the social and indus
trial problems of the typical American
city if plans of the California Y. M. C.
A. are carried into effect this summer.
The following excerpt from the an
nouncement of the California group of
the Collegiate Industrial Research move
; ment gives a good idea of what will be
| done.
"Many American students are eager
| for the opportunity to be brought into
intimate contact with social problems of
our great cities. It is therefore planned
that a group of picket men (not more
than 35), from the colleges, universities
and seminaries of California shall be
brought to the Bay Region for industrial
work and study, that they may be better
equipped for meeting the social issue of
our ageâ€”lndustrialism. They will be
given jobs in various types of industry,
usually unskilled labor, for which the
current scale of wages will be paid. From
actual experience and observation they
will be able to understand labor's point
of view as well as the employer's.
Mr. Carrol Powers, M. A. Labor Eco
nomics, now of the San Francisco Y. M.
C. A. School of Economics, has consented
to act as leader of the group. As many
types of industry as possible will be cov
ered and the pay will be sufficient to al
low a fair amount of saving for the com
ing college year.
The course will last from June 4 to
July 31 and the class will meet three
times a week to discuss its work and hear
addresses by industrial leaders.
The plan was worked out three years
ago in Denver, where the first group was
organized. Since that time it has been
used with great success in numerous cities
in all parts of the country where the in
dustrial situation is a live issue.
