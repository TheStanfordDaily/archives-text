# MANY COLLEGE WOMEN ARE OF FOLLIES TYPE-McGOVERN

### Allan Charles, '24 
"The real success of the Ziegfield
girl is due to her blas6 attitude, her
interest in the audience, and her per
sonality, developed for the chorus by
months of training," says Miss Mar
garet McGovern, director of physical
education at Harker's School, who is
directing the 1924 Junior Opera, and
who has been on the Orpheum circuit
and in musical comedy stock]
"The Ziegfield girl uses a strutting
step, and does almost no true dancing. |
The modern audience likes the blas6, j
indifferently appealing type. A sort,
of flirting attitude with the audience is
taken; the girls strut forward, glance
interestedly into the audience and
then strut back. There is very little of
the girlish quality in Ziegfield's chor
uses."
In answer to the query, "How far
can a chorus extend its influence over
an audience?" Miss McGovern replied,
"The chorus is the biggest part of the
musical show; it can make or break
the performance. Professional chor
uses are very carefully trained. They
must live the part. It takes quite a
length of time to draw out the per-1
sonality of the chorus to its best, how-1
ever."
"Would you advise the college girl |
who likes musical comedy to go on
the professional stage?"
"That is a question the girl herself

must decide."
"What could a college girl get out
of a period of stage life?"
"That depends—l thihk I learned
more on the stage than in all the
books I have ever read. You meet all
kinds of people. The travel and ex
perience one secures is of great value;
you have the opportunity often to as
sociate with the finest, most interest
ing type of person."
"What do you think the moral ef
fect would be?"
"The common assumption that stage
people are dissipated is far-fetched.
They don't have the time. It is very
necessary to keep in good condition;
to go through with an act when in
poor physical condition is a terrific
strain."
"How about the college girl. Is she
apt to be very good chorus material?"
"Education should favor her to some
extent. But very few university girls
have had any dancing or singing train
ing. In the college you find many of
the unaffected girlish type. This kind
of girl can be trained to get the show
over best, I think."
"Do you think beauty is the best
single asset for a chorus girl?"
"No. Ziegfield doesn't choose his
choruses just for their beauty. Per
sonality is essential on the stage as
well as off. Personality will get you
anywhere—or nowhere."

the unaffected girlish type. This kind
of girl can be trained to get the show
over best, I think."
"Do you think beauty is the best
single asset for a chorus girl?"
"No. Ziegfield doesn't choose his
choruses just for their beauty. Per
sonality is essential on the stage as
well as off. Personality will get you
anywhere—or nowhere."
"The real success of the Ziegfield
girl is due to her blas6 attitude, her
interest in the audience, and her per
sonality, developed for the chorus by
months of training," says Miss Mar
garet McGovern, director of physical
education at Harker's School, who is
directing the 1924 Junior Opera, and
who has been on the Orpheum circuit
and in musical comedy stock]
"The Ziegfield girl uses a strutting
step, and does almost no true dancing. |
The modern audience likes the blas6, j
indifferently appealing type. A sort,
of flirting attitude with the audience is
taken; the girls strut forward, glance
interestedly into the audience and
then strut back. There is very little of
the girlish quality in Ziegfield's chor
uses."
In answer to the query, "How far
can a chorus extend its influence over
an audience?" Miss McGovern replied,
"The chorus is the biggest part of the
musical show; it can make or break
the performance. Professional chor
uses are very carefully trained. They
must live the part. It takes quite a
length of time to draw out the per-1
sonality of the chorus to its best, how-1
ever."
"Would you advise the college girl |
who likes musical comedy to go on
the professional stage?"
"That is a question the girl herself

must decide."
"What could a college girl get out
of a period of stage life?"
"That depends—l thihk I learned
more on the stage than in all the
books I have ever read. You meet all
kinds of people. The travel and ex
perience one secures is of great value;
you have the opportunity often to as
sociate with the finest, most interest
ing type of person."
"What do you think the moral ef
fect would be?"
"The common assumption that stage
people are dissipated is far-fetched.
They don't have the time. It is very
necessary to keep in good condition;
to go through with an act when in
poor physical condition is a terrific
strain."
"How about the college girl. Is she
apt to be very good chorus material?"
"Education should favor her to some
extent. But very few university girls
have had any dancing or singing train
ing. In the college you find many of
the unaffected girlish type. This kind
of girl can be trained to get the show
over best, I think."
