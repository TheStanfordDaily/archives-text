# CHILDREN OF HAWAII ARE EAGER TO CHANGE
## Noted Lecturer Says Pupils in Island Schools Desire to Be Real American Citizens 
### 
"All the school children of Hawaii
want to be good Americans, and the
often-quoted phrase, 'Once a Jap al
ways a Jap,' is absolutely untrue,"
said Mr. Vaughn McCaughey in his
illustrated lecture on "The Schools of
Hawaii," which was given last night
in the Little Theater. "Children of
Japanese parentage want to grow up
to be good American citizens and
share the responsibility of govern
ment. Their parents take great pride
in sending them to school in American
clothing.
"Almost every nationality is repre
sented in the Hawaiian schools. There
is very little race prejudice in the
Islands, but lately race antagonism
has increased. Hawaii has some seri
ous race problems to solve, and the
solution will have to be found through
the spirit of kindliness and good will."
Educational History Sketched
Mr. McCaughey gave a brief sketch
of the educational history of Hawaii,
beginning with the exploration of the
Islands by the Spanish and Japanese.
According to the lecturer, the mission
aries from New England exercised a
great influence over Hawaiian educa
tion. They taught the natives how to
read and write and were active in
establishing schools. As far back as
1825, Hawaiian institutions of learning
led the culture of the West, and the
people of the Pacific coast of America
sent their children to the Islands to
be educated.
Hawaii University Noted
In organization, the University of
Hawaii is comparable to the Univer
sity of California. This university is
noted for the excellent course that is
given in the technology of sugar. Su
gar production, refining, transporta
tion, and marketing have been more
carefully studied at this institution
than any other educational center in
the world.
"Alexander Ford is the great school
master of Hawaii whose name will go
down in history," said Mr. McCaughey.
"He is the author of the Pacific Union,
a forerunner of a new world order,
which will enable people to live to
gether in peace. Ford's great contem
porary on this continent is Dr. David
Starr Jordan."
Natives Adopt Tunes
In speaking of the Hawaiian music,
Mr. McCaughey said: "Hawaiian melo
dies are re-creations of European
tunes. The music expresses the
thoughts and emotions of the natives,
and the harmony has been changed
to suit the fancy of the Islanders, j
Americans do not have the chance to
hear the real Hawaiian music, because
the Hawaiians who tour the United
States change the melody and rhythm
of the songs to please American audi
ences.
"Most Americans think of Hawaii
as the land where the hula skirts are
made," said Mr| McCaughey. "As a
matter of fact these skirts come from
Samoa."
Mr. McCaughey illustrated his talk
with a large collection of colored
slides which pictured the marine life
of the Islands, the industries, schools,
natives, and some of the famous old
Hawaiian legends.

share the responsibility of govern
ment. Their parents take great pride
in sending them to school in American
clothing.
"Almost every nationality is repre
sented in the Hawaiian schools. There
is very little race prejudice in the
Islands, but lately race antagonism
has increased. Hawaii has some seri
ous race problems to solve, and the
solution will have to be found through
the spirit of kindliness and good will."
Educational History Sketched
Mr. McCaughey gave a brief sketch
of the educational history of Hawaii,
beginning with the exploration of the
Islands by the Spanish and Japanese.
According to the lecturer, the mission
aries from New England exercised a
great influence over Hawaiian educa
tion. They taught the natives how to
read and write and were active in
establishing schools. As far back as
1825, Hawaiian institutions of learning
led the culture of the West, and the
people of the Pacific coast of America
sent their children to the Islands to
be educated.
Hawaii University Noted
In organization, the University of
Hawaii is comparable to the Univer
sity of California. This university is
noted for the excellent course that is
given in the technology of sugar. Su
gar production, refining, transporta
tion, and marketing have been more
carefully studied at this institution
than any other educational center in
the world.
"Alexander Ford is the great school
master of Hawaii whose name will go
down in history," said Mr. McCaughey.
"He is the author of the Pacific Union,
a forerunner of a new world order,
which will enable people to live to
gether in peace. Ford's great contem
porary on this continent is Dr. David
Starr Jordan."
Natives Adopt Tunes
In speaking of the Hawaiian music,
Mr. McCaughey said: "Hawaiian melo
dies are re-creations of European
tunes. The music expresses the
thoughts and emotions of the natives,
and the harmony has been changed
to suit the fancy of the Islanders, j
Americans do not have the chance to
hear the real Hawaiian music, because
the Hawaiians who tour the United
States change the melody and rhythm
of the songs to please American audi
ences.
"Most Americans think of Hawaii
as the land where the hula skirts are
made," said Mr| McCaughey. "As a
matter of fact these skirts come from
Samoa."
Mr. McCaughey illustrated his talk
with a large collection of colored
slides which pictured the marine life
of the Islands, the industries, schools,
natives, and some of the famous old
Hawaiian legends.
"All the school children of Hawaii
want to be good Americans, and the
often-quoted phrase, 'Once a Jap al
ways a Jap,' is absolutely untrue,"
said Mr. Vaughn McCaughey in his
illustrated lecture on "The Schools of
Hawaii," which was given last night
in the Little Theater. "Children of
Japanese parentage want to grow up
to be good American citizens and
share the responsibility of govern
ment. Their parents take great pride
in sending them to school in American
clothing.
