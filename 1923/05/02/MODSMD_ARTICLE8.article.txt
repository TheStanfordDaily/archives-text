# STANFORD FELLOWSHIP PLAN, NEW UNIT FOR CHILDREN'S HOME DESCRIBED IN ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
"What is education after all, but to
be able to understand and help in such
work as the Home carried on by the
Stanford Medical School, and in the
memorial to Arthur Clifford Kimber,
the veteran who gave his life for
democracy in the interest of Stan
ford?"
Dudley DeGroot's speech in the as
sembly . this morning expressed stu
dent sentiment toward the drive in
behalf of the Convalescent Home and
the fellowship fund. In spite of the
gradually decreasing pocketbook, De-
Groot pointed out that it is a privilege
for members of Stanford to contribute
to these causes.
Medical School Needs Assistance
Speaking on the subject of the Chil
dren's Home, Margaret Wales, social
service head of the Stanford clinics,
said, "Perhaps you do not realize that
when the new unit is built, Stanford
will be unique in having the only real
convalescent home in the West. But
the Medical School needs assistance
in order to complete its work which
will permit invalided children to re
turn to normal life with the advantage
of health."
The present accommodations do not
allow care for children over a certain
age limit, and Miss Wales gave exam
ples of cases which had been in the
hospital at San Francisco for three
years, without the benefits of the
home.
Ruhr Visitor Discusses France
Cyrus Peirce, recent visitor to the
Ruhr, who has had an unusual oppor

tunity to review the situation in Eu
rope, discussed France and the pur
pose of field service fellowships.
"What we must do in this country is
what the American Field Service is
trying to reach —a better understand
ing of the French spirit. The French
mind is one of the finest-tempered
tools in the world.
"Notwithstanding propaganda to the
contrary, France is not militaristic.
The march of her army into the Ruhr
is the greatest single constructive act
since the war, and although this act
may not be economically worth while,
it puts an end to an intolerable situa
tion. Eventually Germany will make
reparations payment, which she is
fully able to do without sacrificing the
good of her people."
War Orphans France's Emblem
Peirce described what he found to
be the true emblem of France —a group
of war-orphaned boys in the children's
parade on Joan of Arc's day at Paris.
"They were led by a little priest on
whose breast was every known medal
of honor," said the speaker.
"The action of the American Field
Service in sending students to France
is the first and most direct reply to
Clemenceau's plea for a mutual under
standing between our two countries."
Philip Landis then spoke, describing
the method by which students will be
personally asked to contribute to these
two projects. "Remember," ho said,
"when giving the amount decided
upon, to state what proportion shall
be given to each cause."
"What is education after all, but to

turn to normal life with the advantage
of health."
The present accommodations do not
allow care for children over a certain

Ruhr Visitor Discusses France
Cyrus Peirce, recent visitor to the
Ruhr, who has had an unusual oppor

tunity to review the situation in Eu
rope, discussed France and the pur
pose of field service fellowships.
"What we must do in this country is
what the American Field Service is
trying to reach —a better understand
ing of the French spirit. The French
mind is one of the finest-tempered
tools in the world.
"Notwithstanding propaganda to the
contrary, France is not militaristic.
The march of her army into the Ruhr
is the greatest single constructive act
since the war, and although this act
may not be economically worth while,
it puts an end to an intolerable situa
tion. Eventually Germany will make
reparations payment, which she is
fully able to do without sacrificing the
good of her people."
War Orphans France's Emblem
Peirce described what he found to
be the true emblem of France —a group
of war-orphaned boys in the children's
parade on Joan of Arc's day at Paris.
"They were led by a little priest on
whose breast was every known medal
of honor," said the speaker.
"The action of the American Field
Service in sending students to France
is the first and most direct reply to
Clemenceau's plea for a mutual under
standing between our two countries."
Philip Landis then spoke, describing
the method by which students will be
personally asked to contribute to these
two projects. "Remember," ho said,
"when giving the amount decided
upon, to state what proportion shall
be given to each cause."
"What is education after all, but to
be able to understand and help in such
work as the Home carried on by the
Stanford Medical School, and in the
memorial to Arthur Clifford Kimber,
the veteran who gave his life for
democracy in the interest of Stan
ford?"
Dudley DeGroot's speech in the as
sembly . this morning expressed stu
dent sentiment toward the drive in
behalf of the Convalescent Home and
the fellowship fund. In spite of the
gradually decreasing pocketbook, De-
Groot pointed out that it is a privilege
for members of Stanford to contribute
to these causes.
Medical School Needs Assistance
Speaking on the subject of the Chil
dren's Home, Margaret Wales, social
service head of the Stanford clinics,
said, "Perhaps you do not realize that
when the new unit is built, Stanford
will be unique in having the only real
convalescent home in the West. But
the Medical School needs assistance
in order to complete its work which
will permit invalided children to re
turn to normal life with the advantage
of health."
The present accommodations do not

age limit, and Miss Wales gave exam
