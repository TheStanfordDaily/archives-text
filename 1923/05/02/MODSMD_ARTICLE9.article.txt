# QUAD COVER DESIGN ON EXHIBIT TOMORROW
## 
### 
The sight of something new in
the line of cover designs for col
lege annuals will be available to
morrow morning, according to
those in charge of the 1924 Quad.
A sample of the cover which is to
be used on this year's annual will
be displayed at the engineering
corner as the sale of the remain
ing 380 copies of the book begins.
The cover design was worked
out by Pedro Lemos. The die was
cut by Sarlandt at the Banker's
Utility Co. in San Francisco, and
the color work, stamping, and em
bossing is the work of John Kitch
in Co., also of San Francisco.
This will be the first annual in
the state of California to use this
type of cover. The cases, to total
1700 in number, are now under
construction at Kitchin's in San
Francisco.
