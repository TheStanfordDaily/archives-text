# BASEBALL MEN 10 LEAVE TOMORROW ON ARIZONA TRIP
## Team Will Play Five Games In Two States; Thirteen Varsity Members Will Go 
### 
As a climax to the 1923 season, the
varsity liaseball team will leave hriday
afternoon at 4:30 for a nine-day trip
through Southern California and Ari
zona. After a five-game schedule the
men will return to the campus on Sun
day, May 13, at 8 :30 p. m.
The first game will be at Bakersfield
on Saturday afternoon, with a Standard
Oil Company team. Sunday will be an
off day, and the team will travel to Los
Angeles to meet Occidental College on
Monday. Tucson, Arizona, will he the
next stop, and the University of Ari
zona will oblige on Thursday and Fri
day, May 10 and 11. Both teams then
travel to Phoenix to stage a Cardinal-
Wildcat game Saturday afternoon. The
Cards will then hit the trail for home,
with no stops on the way.
The University of Arizona is the only
team to offer any dope at all on the
Cardinal chances* The Wildcats beat
the University of Southern California in
straight games, 5 to 4, 7 to 4, and 13 to
4. This forecasts a close series, as the
Stanford-U. S. C. games went to Stan
ford by about the same margin. The
Cards have gathered strength since then,
however.
The Redshirts will start with a playing
list of thirteen men. Captain-elect Pat
terson and Charlie Deffebach will be un
able to go on account of studies, and
the team may find it hard to get along
without them. The list includes: ln
fielders, Heckendorf, Mulchay, Captain
Peavy, Roberts, Woodward; pitchers,
Clark, Teague, Solomon; catcher, Fuller;
outfielders, May, Lawson, McCandless,
and either Parker or Carver.
