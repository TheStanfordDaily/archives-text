# OPERA TO BE ONE-SIDED BOUT, SAYS FISTIC CRITIC
## 
### 
" 'I Got a Feeling' Kid 1924 will win
the annual Junior Opera bout by a
knockout in the first round," said
Battling Critic after peaking through
the keyhole of the Assembly hall door
last night and watching the daily work
out. "Fastidious Rough hasn't a
prayer," he continued. "There won't
be any conflict. His only hope is to
keep out of reach—and comparing legs
I'd say 'Fastidious' sure has it coming
to him the night of May 12."
Kid 1924 Has Mean Punch
"Yes, Kid 1924 sure know his stuff.
Plenty of speed, a long reach, clever
side-stepper, quite a bit of experience.
He sure can handle his arms, works
well in the clinches. There won't be
any slow sparring or any ducking;
right through to the "Finale" Kid 1924
is going to be right on his toes. The
only thing that yet handicaps him
seems to be his wind, but this won't
be a long-drawn-out fight—artyway
nothing like that three-and-a-half-hour

draw of "Will's."
Says Kid 1924 Will Be "All Teed Up'
"With regular workouts every nighl
from now on with his trainers, 1924
will be in the pink of condition for the
big engagement of the quarter. Oh, oi
course Kid 1924 wa snot in that con
dition last night," Battling Critic ad
mitted, "but he shows something just
the same; he has all the punch, the
knockout lotion, right now.
Kid 1924 Has Personality
"He struts a little, to be sure, but
doesn't do showy, 'flip-flop-you-chase
me-and-I'll-chase-you' stuff. A real gen
tleman, this Kid. although you can't
help laughing at him most of the time
No, no cauliflower ears, broken-looking
noses —nor likelihood of his pulling a
muscle the Big Night. He's a Show of
charming personality, very modest and
sweet. 'I Ain't. Nobody Much' he says
diffidently. The only thing I fear ie
that he may stimulate unquenchable
love in the heart of 'Fastidious Rough,,
but the knockout comes first—after
that he isn't responsible."

well in the clinches. There won't be
any slow sparring or any ducking;
right through to the "Finale" Kid 1924
is going to be right on his toes. The
only thing that yet handicaps him
seems to be his wind, but this won't
be a long-drawn-out fight—artyway
nothing like that three-and-a-half-hour

draw of "Will's."
Says Kid 1924 Will Be "All Teed Up'
"With regular workouts every nighl
from now on with his trainers, 1924
will be in the pink of condition for the
big engagement of the quarter. Oh, oi
course Kid 1924 wa snot in that con
dition last night," Battling Critic ad
mitted, "but he shows something just
the same; he has all the punch, the
knockout lotion, right now.
Kid 1924 Has Personality
"He struts a little, to be sure, but
doesn't do showy, 'flip-flop-you-chase
me-and-I'll-chase-you' stuff. A real gen
tleman, this Kid. although you can't
help laughing at him most of the time
No, no cauliflower ears, broken-looking
noses —nor likelihood of his pulling a
muscle the Big Night. He's a Show of
charming personality, very modest and
sweet. 'I Ain't. Nobody Much' he says
diffidently. The only thing I fear ie
that he may stimulate unquenchable
love in the heart of 'Fastidious Rough,,
but the knockout comes first—after
that he isn't responsible."
" 'I Got a Feeling' Kid 1924 will win
the annual Junior Opera bout by a
knockout in the first round," said
Battling Critic after peaking through
the keyhole of the Assembly hall door
last night and watching the daily work
out. "Fastidious Rough hasn't a
prayer," he continued. "There won't
be any conflict. His only hope is to
keep out of reach—and comparing legs
I'd say 'Fastidious' sure has it coming
to him the night of May 12."
Kid 1924 Has Mean Punch
"Yes, Kid 1924 sure know his stuff.
Plenty of speed, a long reach, clever
side-stepper, quite a bit of experience.
He sure can handle his arms, works
well in the clinches. There won't be
any slow sparring or any ducking;
