# IDENTITY OF CARNIVAL MASQUE RULERS WILL BE KEPI SECRET
## King and Queen To Unmask During Coronation By President Wilbur. 
### 
Long live King and Queen ! nut the
names of the royal Lord and Lady of Misrule will not be revealed until the
coronation ceremony at the Carnival Masque tomorrow evening. Absolute
secrecy' veiled the voting on the Quad after 12 o'clock today and no amount or
persuasion could make Newt Brinkman divulge the probable winners. Thltr
much is known, however —the queen will be either Peggy Richardson, Hutb
Mcßride, or Earlene Phelps; the leaders at 12 o'clock in the race for king were
Roland Gill, Gene Trago, and Sam Mendenhall.
President Wilbur will crown the rulers of the evening in a brief, impressive
ceremony to be staged at 10:30. He will be assisted by eminent foreign
dignitaries and a number of courtiers will add the proper atmosphere. Jniit
as the crowns are placed upon the kneeling king and queen, they will remove
their masks—and the expectant merrymakers will follow their example as they
cheer their sovereigns.
The entire ceremony will be screened by Pathe News. Joseph Rucker, head
cameraman for Pathe, says that the carnival scenes may later be used in a

'feature film. (This is your chance to
know whether you were "just made
for the movies!")
There have been rumors in regard
to the expense of the Masque—fie

inable; a scarf of dame, a teasing
mask —oh, what can't be done with a.
little bit of nothing plus a little wit!
