## 
### 
Major William D. Geary, Field Artrt
lery, will succeed Major Leroy P. (Rol
lins as head of the Department of Mili
tary Training and Profesor of Military
Science and Tactics at Stanford next
year. Major Collins has been detachcd
from duty at Stanford to attend the Gen
eral Staff College at Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas. His attendance at the staff col
lege has been delayed several times in
order to permit him to remain at Stan
ford.
Major Geary, who. is completing tl*
course of the General Staff College, will
come to Stanford immediately upon his
completion of his work there, about the
middle of June, in order to have some
time for conference with Major Collins
before the latter rs detached from Stan
ford. Major Geary, according to Major
Collins, is adorably fitted by training and
temperament to head the R. O. T„ C
work at Stanford. He has been selcrted
for the place by the Chief of the Fkid
Artillery of the United States Army m
consultation with President Wilbur ax
the best available man for the position.
Major Collins came into close tonrh
with him in 1918 when he himself was
in charge of the Department of Tactics
in the training school at Fort Sill, Okla
homa, and Major Geary was an instruc
tor in his department, both l>eing experts
in field artillery. Later Major Geary
demonstrated ability in R. O. T. C. work
when he was in charge of the military
activities of the San Diego High School.
Major Geary is just completing a sec
ond year at Fort Leavenworth, which is
in itself an indication of ability, since
only about one-fifth of those taking thr
first-year course have been recommmdfd
to continue the second year. Hp wa*
graduated from West Point in 1907 and
entered the cavalry arm, transferring to
the Held Artillery in 1916, becoming s«>
proficient in this branch that he wa*.
made an instructor in it in the war time
training efforts.
