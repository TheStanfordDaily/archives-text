"Had a good meal at the Union last night; every
thing was great."
Surprising as it may, and probably does seem,
the above statement came from a student. Also, this
student is one who, together with most of his fel
lows, is far from backward in "handing the razz" to
whatever in his opinion deserves such treatment.
The fact that the gentleman's remark distinctly
jolted his hearers off their customary track is proof
of the rarity of praise when food is mentioned.
For every such tribute, however, it is a snap bet
that there were at least a hundred condemnations,
of varying degrees of bitterness, on the same meal.
At present there is no danger that the campus epi
cures will be metamorphosed into boarding-house
pollyannas.
It all boils itself down to this: students, in com
pany with the rest of the world, must have some
thing to kick about. A university with nothing on
which to relieve excess animosity would to the aver
age student be one of the less pleasant sections of
Hades. And food is the easiest tiling on which to
vent one's wrath; it is right in front of one, it can
not talk back, and the satisfaction gained from mak
ing derogatory remarks in its presence greatly ex
ceeds such safety valves as unappreciated vitu
peration against the faculty.
For the most part, kicks against food are
used to make conversation; at the Union, where one
is served food from one of the finest kitchens on the
Coast, in larger quantities than students uncom
plainingly receive for the same price in commercial
restaurants, the same remarks are heard which used
to enliven the dinner hour at the Inn, at Tagawa's
palace, and delving into ancient history, at the old
Encina dining room.
The wielders of the boot clamor for a share in
control of menus; if they could only run things—
say they—there would be no more complaints, be
cause they would know exactly what they wanted.
Which sounds nice and rosy, but seldom works.
In any of the eating or living groups wherein stu
dents run their own bills of fare the same moans
about tough steak, cold coffee, warm pie, and all
the rest of the discrepancies in service and quality
may be heard, today or any other day, hi no greater
nor lesser degree than similar wails from the Union
courtyard. '
Already rumblings of future outbursts against the
new dining halls of Encina are coming forth from
those who intend to move in as soon as the plaster
is dry. The same arguments on the advantages of
individual kitchens, the same kicks against being
forced to cat food that is cooked in bulk, are again
appearing.
Let us congratulate the builders of the new eating
quarters not only on erecting modern and comfort
able dining rooms, but also on providing a new out
let for the excess steam of the Razz Association.
