# THE
						MAJORITY'S POLICY

Tt seems a shame that students can no longer leave
notebooks on the Quad without fear of finding them
gone; it is simply disgraceful how many books are
taken from the library without consent or permission
of the officials; and it is shocking to the finer senses
that the supposedly well-bred college student will
lake another's bicycle wherever he finds'it, just
because he has to get some place in a hurry and finds
the owner has been foolish enough to leave the darn
thing unlocked.
With the proper preliminary warming up, one

may grow quite incensed over the above facts.
Looking at the situation through spectacles of a
slightly azure hint, the morals of the campus would
seem to be sadly on the down grade, with the brakes
left in the garage. The principles of the student
body might be considered a minus quantity.
But we fail to work up any great enthusiasm over
a denunciation of undergraduate pilfering tenden
cies: the fact that ninety-eight per cent of the stu
dents leave their rooms unlocked, their houses open
to the public, and their valuables scattered about the
lloor and bureau, and that they return every evening
to find them in the same scattered state, is ample
proof of the fundamental honesty of the college com
munity.
