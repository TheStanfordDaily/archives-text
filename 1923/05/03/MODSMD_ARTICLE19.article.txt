O college Queen (Let's call her Jean)
Just loved eat Life Savers,
At every shop she'd have to stop
So clerks could jump and labor.
Once by the lake she piped a Snake,
Her eyes would not behave her,
So in she fell with a well-pitched yell—
Now H'e's her sweet Life Saver.
—IJI.

SCENE FROM JUNIOR OPERA
Just after the song, "All Teed-llp" (Things have al
ready Started).
The golf-champion speaks:
Dorothy, dear, golf links us together. Let's follow the
same course through life. It would be wonderful to have

you watch me drive off to work
in the morning, and to know you'd
be there when I finished. Do you
suppose there will ever be any
other woman for me?
Voice in the distance, "Fore."
Dorothy, you're a knock-out. Oh,
I'm hit (stage fall).
Reginald (rushing in): I'm most
distressed, but 1 called "fore."
Can't you count? This course is
terrible. My caddy says there are
eighteen holes on it.

Belle —My dear, I had a marvelous program. I had
a dance with last years pinochle captain.
Cynic —These hero-worshippers!
Pansy—l had a terrible evening. Bill was there with
another woman!
Cynic—Never let one man worry your mind.
Belle —I could dance all evening with Bud.
Cynic—You didn't, did you? I saw you go outside after
the fourth dance and come in after the eighth.
Pansy—And Bill told me he wasn't coming to the
dance.
Cynic—And you believed him?
Belle —I like Bud, and I think he fell for me.
Cynic—Did he ask you for any more dates?
Belle —No-o-o-o.
Cynic—Hum.
Belle —I'd give my new box of orange rouge to go out
with that pinochle captain.
Cynic—You'd be sorry.
Belle —What do you mean?
Cynic—You'd be sorry you gave up a perfectly good
box of rouge for a date with him.
Pansy—Joe was there, "roughing it,"and he smiled at
me every time I went by him.
Cynic—How do you know?
Pansy—Why he's not cross-eyed. I can tell when he is
looking at me! How was your date?
Cynic—Like all the rest. Hands you a line and tells
you you're wonderful. And I say "thank you, same to
you!"
Belle —Bud has the most glorious eyes and a wonder
ful line, and —Oh, you're going to sleep!
Pansy—Oh, you're dreaming. Go on we heard you.
Now what did you say about Bud's eyes? Don't mind me.
I can sleep through noise.

Pansy—l had a terrible evening. Bill was there with

Cynic—Never let one man worry your mind.
Belle —I could dance all evening with Bud.
Cynic—You didn't, did you? I saw you go outside after
the fourth dance and come in after the eighth.
Pansy—And Bill told me he wasn't coming to the

Cynic—And you believed him?
Belle —I like Bud, and I think he fell for me.
Cynic—Did he ask you for any more dates?
Belle —No-o-o-o.
Cynic—Hum.
Belle —I'd give my new box of orange rouge to go out
with that pinochle captain.
Cynic—You'd be sorry.
Belle —What do you mean?
Cynic—You'd be sorry you gave up a perfectly good
box of rouge for a date with him.
Pansy—Joe was there, "roughing it,"and he smiled at
me every time I went by him.
Cynic—How do you know?
Pansy—Why he's not cross-eyed. I can tell when he is
looking at me! How was your date?
Cynic—Like all the rest. Hands you a line and tells
you you're wonderful. And I say "thank you, same to
you!"
Belle —Bud has the most glorious eyes and a wonder
ful line, and —Oh, you're going to sleep!
Pansy—Oh, you're dreaming. Go on we heard you.
Now what did you say about Bud's eyes? Don't mind me.
