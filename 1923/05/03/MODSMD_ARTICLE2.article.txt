# SIGMA NU LEADS IN LEAGUE 1 BY 11-7 WIN FROM BREAKERS
## 
### 
Sigma Nu maintained its lead in
League 1 yesterday by walloping Break
ers to the tune of 11 to 7. The Sigma
Nu team has been going great all sea
son and from present indications should
win the title in its league. Other regu
lar games yesterday were Alpha Tau
Omega 18, El Tigre 5; Kappa Sigma 11,
Phi Gamma Delta 0, and in addition a
postponed game was played Tuesday be
tween breakers and the Dekes. The
Breakers won by a 11-8 score.
Jimmic Aydelott twirled a good brand
of ball for the winning aggregation. The
1925 frosh pitcher allowed only three
clean hits, the rest of the Breakers scor
ing being-the result of errors. In addi
tion to doing the heavy work on the
mound, Aydelott starred with the bat,
getting a triple and two doubles.
George Lane pitched innings for
Breakers. In the sixth Sigma Nu got
onto his curves and batted him out of
the box. "Cow" Oliva finished the game
and held Sigma Nu down with a fast
ball.
The Kappa Sigma-Fiji game w;f
much closer and more hotly contested
than its 11-0 score would indicate. The
slope of the ground on the outfield made
the catching of fly balls difficult and the
number of errors in the outfield was one
of the reasons the Kappa Sigma score
was so large. The game was a pitching
duel between Cliff Hay for the winners
and Bonner for the losers. Hay used
a spit ball and was given enough support
by his teammates to score the shutout.
Bonner, while he pitched good ball, was
not given much support, and could not
keep his hits scattered.
Dick Taylor held the El Tigre nine to
five runs, while his mates hit the El
Tigre pitchers all over the field, making
a total of 18 counters. The A. T. O. men
had the advantage throughout the game
and were never in danger of being head
ed. Pegram knocked out a home run
and Phelps gathered a three-bagger.
The Breakers and Dekes played a nip
and-tuck affair Tuesday. The score was
tied at 5 all in the fifth and at 7 all in
the next inning. The Breakers made four
in the final inning and held the Dekes
down to one tally in the last stanza, giv
ing them a three-point lead.
Today's games are: Zeta Psi and En
cin second; Encina first artd El Cuadro;
Alpha Sigma Phi and Phi Kappa Psi;
and Phi Delta Thcta and Theta Delta
Chi.
