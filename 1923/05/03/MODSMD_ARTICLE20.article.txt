# RED PEPPER
## 
### 
Ever since they delighted Weste«i audi
ences with "The Ham Tree" a good
many seasons ago, Mclntyre and Heath
have never failed to provide good, clean
comedy to their patrons. Although Tom
Heath is temporarily absent from the
show, the company adds another success
to its long list in its presentation, "Red
Pepper." As usual, the comedy is of
the blackface variety, but not of the
canned and labeled type that is so com
mon at the present time. James Mc
lntyre, aided by Harry Shunk, who is
taking the place of Heath, succeeds in
keeping his audience in constant mirth
throughout the entire course of the play.
Humor radiates across the footlights at
a mile-a-minute rate and a "dancing
chorus of dimpled darlings" give a de
cidedly scenic effect to the plot. The
story is of course not sensible—no one.
expects it to be. Act I deals with a horse
race in Havana and Act II is laid on an
Arizona ranch. The entire eight scenes
give plenty of opportunity to the suc
cessful mingling of Mclntyre's fun and
the antics the "beautiful bevy of
bobbed-haired babies" that constitute the
chorus. There is some excellent singing
and we sometimes wish that real darkies
actually sang as well; indeed there is
much that is strikingly original in the
performance. The "Darkie talk" is ex
cellently managed and any Northerner
would recognize and appreciate it at
once. We would, however, not advise
any person of negro extraction to attend
the play, as he might have difficulty in
understanding what was said. Naturally
pseudo-love plays a prominent part in
the action and there are several affairs
that are riotously dealt itwh. In all,
"Red Pepper" is properly hailed as a
"melange of song, dance, and fun," and
its humor is of a type that must cer
tainly appeal to all.
