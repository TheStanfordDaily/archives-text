# English Club Finances
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Editor:
The editorial in last night's D. P. A.
entitled "Every Step Possible" draws
some very sound inferences from the
results of the recent off-campus per
formance of Will Shakespeare. But
the editorial draws some inferences
which are not entirely correct. The
Spectator did not alone assume a
Cardinal debt but also a Pictorial debt
three times the size of the Cardinal
debt, and facts do not warrant \any in
ference that English Club did not act
fairly in the financial arrangements
of the Press Club-English Club agree
ment. The English Club did not agree
to devote the profits of their play to
the Cardinal debt but to the old Se
quoia debt. The Spectator is paying
off both the Cardinal and Pictorial
debts and plans are being perfected
by which they will both be paid off in
a short time.
EDW. D. LANDELS,
Editor Stanford Spectator.
