# KU KLUX KLAN OPERATES ON UTAH COLLEGE CAMPUS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH—The Ku
Klux Klan is working politically on
the campus. A letter to the editor of
the Chronicle, the college publica
tion, gives several mandates to be
strictly followed in student elections.
Some of the orders are: No religious
monopoly; the Chronicle shall not in
fluence student opinion for or against
candidates; any secret machine will be
sought out and revealed. The knights
declare themselves upholders of jus
tice, chivalry, patriotism, and honesty.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
Haviland hall, the new Science building
now under construction, is to have one
of the largest and best laboratories

for experiments in the world. The
laboratory will be 100 feet by 150 feet
and will be absolutely light-and-sound
proof.
