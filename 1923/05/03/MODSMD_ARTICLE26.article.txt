# Calendar Lunatic Escapes For Third Time; Net Tightens
## 
### 
"One Exciting Night" ain't got noth
ing on the nightmare which is galloping
about our campus each night sticking
mysterious numerals on all our telegraph
poles. Some guys says it is trick ad
vertising by this '24 class which is noted
for such stunts, but it looks more as if
some poor bird has lost his mentality
when his nirl called off the Masquerade
date, and now he is smearing dates all
over the iMace.
