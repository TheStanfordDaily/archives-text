# SHEIK CAUSES FLURRIED STIR AMONG WOMEN STUDENTS
## 
### 
TULANE UNIVERSITYâ€”"Here he
comes." "Look at the Sheik." "Isu't he
darling?" "Look at that marvelous
hair." "He tried to slip away from us,"
shouted the women. The object of such
praise was surrounded and shuffled
about until he lost his hat; his clothes
were badly treated. Cab drivers tooted
their horns while the crowd looked on.
The police intervened and saved
Jelly Palmer, a student at Tulane,
from further embarrassment. Valen
tino was expected at the station and
the mistaken identity is what caused
the furor.
