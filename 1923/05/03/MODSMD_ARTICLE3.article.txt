# HARD SCRIMMAGE TO CONCLUDE SPRING FOOTBALL TOMORROW
## Warner to Turn Squad Over To Andy Kerr For Difficult Season. 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
With the scrimmage tomorrow afternoon on the old football field ends the
spring practice season. Then "Pop" Warner will turn East to put his
Pittsburgh athletes through their paces for the last time, and leave the re«t
out here to "Little Andy."
Several features have marked the spring training as successful this year.
As many men have been on the field as were out last year and five or six
teams have run through signals every afternoon for the past month. The
players have shown considerable more "football brains" and real ability in
fundamentals than the squad did last spring. Part of this increase has been
due to the fact that some of the men were coached by "Pop" last spring and
nearly all were under the guidance of Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill last
fall.
Tackling power is much greater than last fall and daily work either on the
dummy or on other men has made an evident improvement. Although the
players do not tackle as hard or as clean as they should, according to Warner,
the improvement will increase untile ___

a team which can "get their men" is
developed. Blocking by the backs is
better, offensive boxing is improved,
and the linemen are showing a greater
ability in breaking through the opposi
tion and smashing the plays.
Another source of gratification to
the coaches comes from the scarcity
of injuries to the players. In the four
weeks of hard practice and scrimmage,
no one has been seriously hurt. Two
or three men have been out for a day
or two with a strained ligament or a
twisted knee but the number handi
capped in the last has been at a mini
mum.
The coaches have also been able to
develop a number of new plays which
should prove effective next fall if their
success this spring is any indication
of their value. Coach Warner has in
troduced a few of the Pittsburgh plays,
some of which we,re used by him for
the first time last year. With the de
velopment of some fast halfbacks the
coaches have brought into play some
good end-run formations which have
been good for steady gains during the
scrimmages.
A number of new men have been
discovered which should prove keen
competition for several line and back
field positions.
In the scrimmage yesterday Strat
ton made a good showing, having put
up a good game during the whole sea
son. His backfield plunging and his j
tackling are steadily improving. Be
side him is Dunmire, the sure-tackling |
back, who has nailed man after man
as he breaks through the line. Harris :
made some good tackles yesterday, I
breaking through at center and stop- J
ping the plays before they hit the line j
of scrimmage. The big fellows on last
year's team have been improving also, i
but they have failed to stop the less-1
experienced men with their greater
"will to do."
The scrimmage tomorrow is the last
one this spring. Then "Pop" will hand
over the helm of the ship to "Little
Andy" and "Tiny."

out here to "Little Andy."
Several features have marked the spring training as successful this year.
As many men have been on the field as were out last year and five or six
teams have run through signals every afternoon for the past month. The
players have shown considerable more "football brains" and real ability in
fundamentals than the squad did last spring. Part of this increase has been
due to the fact that some of the men were coached by "Pop" last spring and
nearly all were under the guidance of Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill last
fall.
Tackling power is much greater than last fall and daily work either on the
dummy or on other men has made an evident improvement. Although the
players do not tackle as hard or as clean as they should, according to Warner,
the improvement will increase untile ___

a team which can "get their men" is
developed. Blocking by the backs is
better, offensive boxing is improved,
and the linemen are showing a greater
ability in breaking through the opposi
tion and smashing the plays.
Another source of gratification to
the coaches comes from the scarcity
of injuries to the players. In the four
weeks of hard practice and scrimmage,
no one has been seriously hurt. Two
or three men have been out for a day
or two with a strained ligament or a
twisted knee but the number handi
capped in the last has been at a mini
mum.
The coaches have also been able to
develop a number of new plays which
should prove effective next fall if their
success this spring is any indication
of their value. Coach Warner has in
troduced a few of the Pittsburgh plays,
some of which we,re used by him for
the first time last year. With the de
velopment of some fast halfbacks the
coaches have brought into play some
good end-run formations which have
been good for steady gains during the
scrimmages.
A number of new men have been
discovered which should prove keen
competition for several line and back
field positions.
In the scrimmage yesterday Strat
ton made a good showing, having put
up a good game during the whole sea
son. His backfield plunging and his j
tackling are steadily improving. Be
side him is Dunmire, the sure-tackling |
back, who has nailed man after man
as he breaks through the line. Harris :
made some good tackles yesterday, I
breaking through at center and stop- J
ping the plays before they hit the line j
of scrimmage. The big fellows on last
year's team have been improving also, i
but they have failed to stop the less-1
experienced men with their greater
"will to do."
The scrimmage tomorrow is the last
one this spring. Then "Pop" will hand
over the helm of the ship to "Little
Andy" and "Tiny."
With the scrimmage tomorrow afternoon on the old football field ends the
spring practice season. Then "Pop" Warner will turn East to put his
Pittsburgh athletes through their paces for the last time, and leave the re«t
out here to "Little Andy."
