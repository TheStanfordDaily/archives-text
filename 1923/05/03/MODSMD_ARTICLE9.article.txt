# FALK FAVORED TO WIN HURDLES SATURDAY
## Kirksey, Merchant, Boost Olympic Club's Chances 
### 
With the announcement that Morris
Kirksey, Eddie Sudden, former Stan
ford sprinters, and Jack Merchant, at
one time all-around University of j
California athlete, would wear the 1
colors of the Olympic Club, the dope- j
sters are beginning to wag their heads
and push the platter of victory toward
the Winged "O" aggregation without
consideration for Stanford and Cali
fornia's chances for victory.
The hundred-yard dash will bring to
gether some of the fastest men of the
season, including several veterans.
Campbell will run for Stanford against I
Sudden and Kirksey of the Olympic |
Club, Barber, the star California fresh
man, Sheppard of California, and
Walker of Oakland high school. The
finest collection of ten-second men
brought together yet this year.
Besides the usual schedule of field
events there is included a 56-pound
weight throw, a 16-pound hammer
throw, and a hop-step-and-jump. Ar
thur and Ludeke are entered in all
three with Orlo Hayes in the hammer
throw and Lou Minsky in the hop
step-and-jump.
Instead of the two-mile run there
is scheduled a five-mile race in which
the Stanford entries are Hays, Charles,
Belcher, Murphy, and Cypher.
