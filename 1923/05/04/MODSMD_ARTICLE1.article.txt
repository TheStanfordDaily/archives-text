# KING AND QUEEN TO BE UNMASKED IN PAVILION
## All Excitement, Jazz, and Fun or Old Carnival to be Crowded Into One Night of Revelry. 
### Pearl Bundick, '23 
"It's our one big night!"
So runs the refrain of a new song which will be introduced on the campus
this evening at the Carnival Masque—and that song describes tonight's high
jinks! All the excitement, the jazz, and the fun of the old two-day carnival
will be crammed into this evening's masquerade which begins promptly at
8:30 in the Pavilion.
The grand march is scheduled for 9 o'clock in order that everyone may
take part. Pathe News will screen the promenade which will be one of the
feature stunts of the evening. Grinstead's orchestra will furnish the music.
Sam Mendenhall has provided four snappy ten-minute entertainments. The
first interlude will come at 9:50, when ten entertainers and thirty showgirls
and steppers will sing "Masquerade," written by Augusta Corey for the
Miss Corey, in the role of

court jester, will read the divertisse
ment prologue and act as stage mana
ger.
Promptly at 10:30, two masked fig
ures will ascend the throne and in a
brief, impressive ceremony, President
Wilbur will crown the King and Queen
of the Masque. Just as he places the
golden crowns on their heads, the
masques will be removed —and not un
til then will the merrymakers know
their king and queen.
The second number of the entertain
ment program bids fair to be the hit
of the evening. "When You and I Were
Young Maggie Blues" is a lilting melo
dy and Charles Stratton, who will sing
it, will be accompanied by fifteen de
mur 6 maidens of Colonial days and
fifteen ultra-modern jazz-babies. "Wild
Flower," from Arthur Hammerstein's
new Broadway success of the same
name, will be the second part of this
number. Eight showgirls, representing
different wild flowers, will dance as
Charles Stratton sings to his "Wild
Flower."
Jessie Herron, a new dancer on the
campus, will give a gypsy dance to
"Marcheta," sung by Cuthbert Tibbe
in the third divertissement. Jerry
Powell and Mabel Ferry appear in a
comedy number, singing "Bambalina,"
another song from "The Wild Flower."
Margaret Mackay follows this duet in
a character-skit, "The Fiddler."
