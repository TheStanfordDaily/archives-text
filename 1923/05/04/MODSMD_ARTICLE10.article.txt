One, two, three, "Fore!"
The warning "Fore!" the answer to
the puzzle of the numbered handbills
plastered around the campus the last
few days, is the name of the 1924 Jun
ior Opera, the last big event of Junior
Week, to be presented Saturday night.
Carl Shoup and Hal Rorke are the
authors.
As the title suggests, golf is the light
footing upon which the musical piece
rests. Golf is presumably the thread
which encircles the cast and binds
them to the Seaside Country Club, the
name-place of most of the action which
"Fore" will offer. An artful use of a
little golf vocabulary and setting is
made; but the authors have not stoop
ed to technicalities, so there is no
peril of "Fore" playing to the bullet
riddled ceiling of the Assembly hall.
More than golf, the magnet which
draws the principals to the Seaside
Club is Dorothy, played by Esther
Flowers, '24. Miss Flowers, who has
been out of college two years studying
art, was in the of the 1920
Junior Opera and presented a Spanish
dancc with Lester Seib, '22. She also
played in "The First Born."
"Susie," the song hit of "Knightie
Knight," may be reincarnated in a
new number, still kept in the shadow,
also sung by Gene Trago, '23, who
plays opposite Esther Flowers, as Bill
Jones, the successful bond salesman.
Trago, who also played in the "Foot
ball Frothies of '22," has a role dis
tinctly different from that of Coven
try in "Knighty Knight," yet well suit
ed to his person. Â«
Rehearsals, in the Little Theater, for
the cast proper, and in the Assembly
hall for the choruses, have been car
ried on every evening of the week. Al
though the period of rehearsing has
been confined to but little more than
two weeks, the direction is divided up
so that all the usual grounds of in
struction will be covered by Saturday
evening. John Richer, '24, is managing
the production, while Richard Ben
tinck has charge of the general direc
tion and the cast rehearsing. Miss
Margaret McGovern. director of physi
cal education at Harker's School, is
directing the choruses and assisting
the principals with their songs and
dances.
Pictures of the cast were taken to
day noon and will be on exhibit next
week.
