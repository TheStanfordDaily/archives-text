# BIOLOGY SCIENCES ARE UNITED INTO SINGLE DEPARTMENT
## BIOLOGY A.B. GRANTED Eighteen Divisions Are Included in New Unit of Administration 
### 
Uniting its various departments of
Stanford University
has organized a School of Biology, the
first school of the sort in any university.
The School of Biology includes the de
partments of anatomy, bacteriology, and
experimental pathology, biochemistry,
botany, entomology, food research, Hop
kins Marine Station, paleontology, physi
ology, and zoology.
Beginning next year, students will be
granted the A.B. degree in Biology,
although it will also he possible for
them to take the degree in separate bio
logical subjects as at present if they
choose.
The faculty of the school consists of
the members of the teaching staffs of
the departments, and an executive head
will be appointed from its membership.
The departments will retain control of
their internal departmental affairs. An
executive committee for administration
of the school has been elected, with Pro
fessor Ernest G. Martin, chairman, and
Professor J. O. Snyder, secretary.
For the A.B. degree in Biology stu
dents will be required to devote a third
of their time in the four college years
to work in biological sciences, and in
general put in the equivalent of at least
one full quarter's work in each of three
different departments of the School of
Biology. Their program of studies as
a whole must also be approved by the
school faculty. They are especially urged
to include a summer quarter's work at
the Hopkins Marine Station.
The School of Biology, co-ordinating
the work of all the biological depart
ments under one faculty and a single
head, is the outgrowth of the conviction
that there are advantages in offering
students an opportunity to master the
fundamentals of all biological sciences
rather than specialize too early in a sin
gle branch. The individual needs of
many students can be more effectively
met by a course arranged from such
a co-ordination of departments than by
greater specialization in their under
graduate years.
A step in the co-operation of different
biological departments was taken two
years ago at Stanford with the estab
lishment of an elementary course in gen
eral biology, running through the year.
Members of different departments join
in giving this course, which begins with
protoplasm, the common living substance
of all plants and animals, and progress
ing through the study of such subjects
as food, heredity, evolution and adapta
tion, reached a discussion of man's place
in nature. This course has resulted in
a new kind of biology text-book, deal
ing with biological science as a whole,
the joint product of Professor L. L. Bur
lingame, geneticist; Professor Harold
Heath, zoologist; Professor E. G. Mar
tin, physiologist; and Professor George
J. Peirce, botanist.
One of the chief assets of the Stanford
School of Biology is the Hopkins Marine
Station on Monterey bay. No other uni
versity has a laboratory so well situ
ated for the study of marine life and so
accessible; indeed it is doubtful if there
is in the world another such institution
with the abundance of material for study,
completeness of equipment, and adapta
bility for work throughout the year. The
waters of the Pacific at that point, on
account of the confluence of northern
and southern currents, are extraordi
narily rich in varied material for study
and the climate makes work possible the
year round, as it is not in the mentally
enervating tropics or in regions subject
ed to long frozen winter seasons. Its
nearness to the University campus makes
the transportation of additional or spe
cial instruments and equipment easy.
