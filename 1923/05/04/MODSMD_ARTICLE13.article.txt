# BIOLOGY SCIENCES ARE UNITED INTO SINGLE DEPARTMENT
## BIOLOGY A.B. GRANTED Eighteen Divisions Are Included in New Unit of Administration 
### 
Uniting its various departments of
Stanford University
has organized a School of Biology, the
first school of the sort in any university.
The School of Biology includes the de
partments of anatomy, bacteriology, and
experimental pathology, biochemistry,
botany, entomology, food research, Hop
kins Marine Station, paleontology, physi
ology, and zoology.
Beginning next year, students will be
granted the A.B. degree in Biology,
although it will also he possible for
them to take the degree in separate bio
logical subjects as at present if they
choose.
The faculty of the school consists of
the members of the teaching staffs of
the departments, and an executive head
will be appointed from its membership.
The departments will retain control of
their internal departmental affairs. An
executive committee for administration
of the school has been elected, with Pro
fessor Ernest G. Martin, chairman, and
Professor J. O. Snyder, secretary.
For the A.B. degree in Biology stu
dents will be required to devote a third
of their time in the four college years
to work in biological sciences, and in
general put in the equivalent of at least
one full quarter's work in each of three
different departments of the School of
Biology. Their program of studies as
a whole must also be approved by the
school faculty. They are especially urged
to include a summer quarter's work at
the Hopkins Marine Station.
The School of Biology, co-ordinating
the work of all the biological depart
ments under one faculty and a single
head, is the outgrowth of the conviction
that there are advantages in offering
students an opportunity to master the
fundamentals of all biological sciences
rather than specialize too early in a sin
gle branch. The individual needs of
many students can be more effectively
met by a course arranged from such
a co-ordination of departments than by
greater specialization in their under
graduate years.
A step in the co-operation of different
