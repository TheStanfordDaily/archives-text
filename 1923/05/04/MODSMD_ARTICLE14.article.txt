# Freshmen Defeat Senior Soccer Team by 1-0 Score
## 
### 
Freshman soccer players defeated the
seniors, 1-0, Wednesday afternoon in a
hotly-contested game. The outcome was
in doubt until the final whistle. Neither
team showed much form, but the seniors,
who were expected to win, lacked the
punch. Numerous times they worked
the ball to the freshman goal, but each
time they failed to get it past the good
guarding of Walt Campbell and his team
mates.
The seniors arc now in fourth place
in the interclass soccer series, with the
freshmen in third place. The sopho
mores and juniors will fight it out for
first place this afternoon. A round robin
is in progress and every team except the
seniors has a chance to win. The results
of the interclass contests will be entered
on the all-sports interclass competition
chart.
