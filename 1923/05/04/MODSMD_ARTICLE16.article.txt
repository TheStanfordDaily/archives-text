# LABOR DAY ORGANIZATION IS PLANNED BY ED. BUTLER
## 
### 
Under the direction of Ed Butler, phns
for the annual Labor Day , Wednesday
afternoon, May 16, at the Convalescent
Home, seem to assure a better clean-up,
feed, and entertainment than usual.
Usually in the past the individual and
frenzied efforts of the student body have
served to transfer rubbish from one spot
to another, and the gardeners have been
forced to take a couple of weeks to clean
up the debris from the "clean-up," but
this year the work will be done systemat
ically. Squads will be assigned to cer
tain jobs, and as a result the working
time will be cut in half and the quality
of the product improved.

The time saved in this way will be de
j voted to a series of diversions engaged
by Homer Mitchcll, in charge of enter
tainment. Mitchell guarantees a pro
gram of specialty acts.
! All members of the barbecue commit
tee are requested to meet with Ed Lan
; dels at 4 o'clock Monday afternoon in
! the Committee Room in the Administra
! tion building. This comes as a personal
j call from Butler, and is important. The
j members are Bob Vial, Bob Wright. H.
M. Dwight, Dave Oliva, Sally McNair,
i Alice Roth, Eunice Riddle? Pearl Bun
dick. Mabel Ferry. Thelma Grace, Lil-
I lian Cottrell, Grace Strobell, Waive
] Kingrcy, and Doris Bailey.
