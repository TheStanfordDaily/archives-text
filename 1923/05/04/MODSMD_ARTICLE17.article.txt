# WORD TEAM STRONG CONTENDERS IN P.A.A.
## Many Star Athletes From Pacific Coast Colleges and Clubs to Compete on Berkeley Field. 
### David Meiklejohn, '26 
Some of the greatest stars on the Pacific Coast will be brought together in
the annual P. A. A. meet to be held on the University of California Oval
tomorrow.
One hundred and twelve entries from this district have been received from
the colleges and clubs.
The Stanford team will be composed of twenty-two varsity and three fresh
man runners, and, contrary to a recent announcement, they will represent
Stanford as a team. *
Among the various luminaries who are entered, and who are most likely
to figure in the record-breaking are: Kirksey of the Olympic Club in the
hundred and two-twenty-yard dashes. Lane Falk and Boles of Stanford in the
hurdles, Sorrenti and Hanner in the javelin, Merchant in a multitude of field

'events, and Bill Black, of the Cardinal
team, in the pole vault.
Lane Falk is favored to win the
hurdles against Krogness of the Olym
pic Club. Falk's strongest competitors
are likely to be his own teammates.
Boles and Leistner.
Elmer Boyden, the U. C. freshman
880-yard flash, has not entered the
half-mile, according to a recently pub
lished entry list, but his name appears
among the quarter-mile racers. He will
bear watching even in this event,
which is not supposed to be his best
race. Van Judah, captain-elect of the
Card track squad, is a strong con
tender for honors in the 440-yard run.
Saxby of the U. C. varsity is not en
tered, which fact makes Van's strong
est competitors Boyden and O'Brien,
of the Olympic Club.
Norman Dole, who so surprised the
Cardinal supporters in the Big Meet
by taking first place in the 880, is run
ning in this event Saturday. Dole
seems to improve with every race and
stands a fighting chance of placing
among the highest in this event.
Bill Kerr, freshman star miler, will
not run, but Clark Cypher, a team
mate, who usually follows closely on
Kerr's heels, will be on the Stanford
team composed of Hays, Murphy, and
Belcher. In addition these men will
enter the more strenuous five-mile race
which is replacing the usual two-mile
affair.
The sprints are the feature events
of the day. With such entries as Kirk
sey, Sudden, Barber of U. C. fresh
men, Campbell of Stanford, and Walk
er of Oakland high school, something
is bound to fall. 1
Five ten-second men can't all expect
to tie at this time, and the winner will
surely have to cut loose to break the
tape first. John Campbell, the Card
sprinter, will doubtless run his best
race in the 220. Campbell's start is not
well enough developed, as yet, to get
him off in the short time it takes
Kirksey to leave his holes in the cen
tury.
