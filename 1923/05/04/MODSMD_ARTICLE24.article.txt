# CONSIDER THE LAKE
## 
### 
We have all evidently become so engrossed in our
scholastic pursuits this spring that the Lagunita
lias been almost utterly neglected. Word comes from
the boathouse that there have been fewer canoes and
swimmers out during any corresponding period in
several years.
The water in the lake is going down rapidly and
it will not be many more weeks before the spot re
verts into a golf course. Some of the pleasantest
memories of Stanford life are associated with the
lake and the man or woman who spends the spring
months here without taking advantages of its attrac
tions will leave with a void in his college record.
