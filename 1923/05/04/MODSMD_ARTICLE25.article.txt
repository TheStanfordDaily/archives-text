# ANOTHER WEEK OF ACTIVITY
## 
### 
With the athletic season over, we of the active col
lege age must turn to other fields as a means of
letting off excess energy. Tonight begins a week of
intense s6cial activity with the carnival gaiety of the
Masque Ball followed by a full program arranged by
the Class of 1924. As usual, there will be those
whose enthusiasm overcomes good judgment, and in
failing to retain the proper balance of time to be
spent between "sideshow and main tent," will fall
by the wayside as a result of listening too long to
the barker outside the society concession. True,
there will be those who will completely ignore the
week's events to their own disadvantage as well as
to that of the men and women who have spent time
and effort in providing the entertainment. To keep
these two extremes in the minority is the ideal.
