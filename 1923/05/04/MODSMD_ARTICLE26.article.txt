						STIMULUS TO THOUGHT

The absence of intellectual life at Stanford has
been attributed by those who have given the situation
any thought to a number of varying reasons. Next
to the lack of profitable leisure because of the rush
of scholastic and extra-curricular activity, comes the
fact that there is no place on or near the campus
where men may gather comfortably and informally
for the exchange of ideas and casual comment.
Man is at his best with his feet under a table and
a full cup before him (coffee, of course). The pre
mature announcement that the cafeteria was to be
converted into a "Roughs' Roost," where such in
formality and lingering over the food and cigarettes
amid congenial surroundings would be possible, was
met with enthusiasm.
Tales of the pleasant hours which have been spent
at the coffee houses in foreign and Eastern universi
ties keep alive the hoj>e that such a thing can be cre
ated here. Since the administration has found it
impractical at present, it may possibly be worked out
as a profitable student undertaking.
