At four o'clock on the afternoon of the McGoozle-
Mundle controversy, Bluntston Jack's fingers began to
feel cramped. For twenty years he had sat on the right
of the Speaker of the House, reporting the House de
bates. He had become calloused. Even the spectacle of
McGoozle being squashed, or of Mundle being tooted
did not spur him to make one extra mark on his hiero
glyphic-covered page. As for the Bill he omitted that
entirely, having failed to catch the Speaker's announce
ment.
Bluntston recorded the fact that two ushers had stood
between Mundle and the pudgy fist of McGoozle. He
flattened his thin, gray hair with a tobacco-stained fore
finger, and looked at the clock.
"What's the rumpus now?" he whispered hoarsely to
his neighbor, a reporter on the Times. "Those Ducks 'ud
go better should they learn how to work the arms, and
as for feet: why they just ain't there a 'tall."
"Hang the cabbage out to dry," replied his lank
friend, the reporter. "Ain't you hep to the fact that this
is a dry season in the House."
"Too damn dry," remarked Bluntston earnsetly, sharp
ening his pencil to a point again "What's the rag now?"
he continued, pointing his penknife at McGoozle who
was in the act of a final appeal to the instincts of our
forefathers.
The reporter considered, scanning his notes.
"Well, as near as I can make out," he began uncer
tainly, "it appears to be a mouthful of bilge-water on how
much money would it take to marry the teaching pro
fession to the St Peter family with divorces barred."
Bluntston recorded the fact that two ushers barely
prevented Mundle from smiting McGoozle on the cra
nium.
"Too bad the harbor appropriation bill, and the light
house financing bill, and the Volstead Act didn't keep 'em
going a little more time," he resumed after a while.
"There ain't no news in this present rumpus, 'cept the
scrapping."
A din arose in the House. Mundle's speech has been
frantically cheered by the members. It was new: it
was novel. McGoozle rose to protest. Sarcasm heaped
itself upon sarcasm; insinuation called forth insinuation,
until Mundle rose to protect the interests of several
gentlemen who were seen to be heavily perspiring with
rage in the rear of the room.
Thus Mundle to McGoozle, "yir, you are uninformed
and out of date; you do not know modern conditions;
you deserve to be squashed!" Thus McGoozle to Mundle,
"Sir, I am a father and a citizen; I protest this blas
phemy against the purity of youth, of conscience; I deny
the right to plunge our young minds into the ignominy
of vulgar uncertainties; I renounce the standard of the
tooter!" Thus Mundle, "Words, Sir, empty words!" And
thus McGoozle, "You're a liar, Sir." Gesture of Mundle
toward McGoozle: gesture of McGoozle in reply. Mc-
Goozle's paunch indented by Mundle: Mundle's wig
slipped to one side by McGoozle. McGoozle and Mundle
carted hence by two red-faced ushers: protectors of the
peace and of little children.
"Let's slip down to Bodleberry's for beer," remarked
Bluntston, putting away his pencil. "We'll write this up
over a stein."

ment.
Bluntston recorded the fact that two ushers had stood
between Mundle and the pudgy fist of McGoozle. He
flattened his thin, gray hair with a tobacco-stained fore
finger, and looked at the clock.
"What's the rumpus now?" he whispered hoarsely to
his neighbor, a reporter on the Times. "Those Ducks 'ud
go better should they learn how to work the arms, and
as for feet: why they just ain't there a 'tall."
"Hang the cabbage out to dry," replied his lank
friend, the reporter. "Ain't you hep to the fact that this
is a dry season in the House."
"Too damn dry," remarked Bluntston earnsetly, sharp
ening his pencil to a point again "What's the rag now?"
he continued, pointing his penknife at McGoozle who
was in the act of a final appeal to the instincts of our
forefathers.
The reporter considered, scanning his notes.
"Well, as near as I can make out," he began uncer
tainly, "it appears to be a mouthful of bilge-water on how
much money would it take to marry the teaching pro
fession to the St Peter family with divorces barred."
Bluntston recorded the fact that two ushers barely
prevented Mundle from smiting McGoozle on the cra
nium.
"Too bad the harbor appropriation bill, and the light
house financing bill, and the Volstead Act didn't keep 'em
going a little more time," he resumed after a while.
"There ain't no news in this present rumpus, 'cept the
scrapping."
A din arose in the House. Mundle's speech has been
frantically cheered by the members. It was new: it
was novel. McGoozle rose to protest. Sarcasm heaped
itself upon sarcasm; insinuation called forth insinuation,
until Mundle rose to protect the interests of several
gentlemen who were seen to be heavily perspiring with
rage in the rear of the room.
Thus Mundle to McGoozle, "yir, you are uninformed
and out of date; you do not know modern conditions;
you deserve to be squashed!" Thus McGoozle to Mundle,
"Sir, I am a father and a citizen; I protest this blas
phemy against the purity of youth, of conscience; I deny
the right to plunge our young minds into the ignominy
of vulgar uncertainties; I renounce the standard of the
tooter!" Thus Mundle, "Words, Sir, empty words!" And
thus McGoozle, "You're a liar, Sir." Gesture of Mundle
toward McGoozle: gesture of McGoozle in reply. Mc-
Goozle's paunch indented by Mundle: Mundle's wig
slipped to one side by McGoozle. McGoozle and Mundle
carted hence by two red-faced ushers: protectors of the
peace and of little children.
"Let's slip down to Bodleberry's for beer," remarked
Bluntston, putting away his pencil. "We'll write this up
over a stein."
—DOWNING McGALLON.
At four o'clock on the afternoon of the McGoozle-
Mundle controversy, Bluntston Jack's fingers began to
feel cramped. For twenty years he had sat on the right
of the Speaker of the House, reporting the House de
bates. He had become calloused. Even the spectacle of
McGoozle being squashed, or of Mundle being tooted
did not spur him to make one extra mark on his hiero
glyphic-covered page. As for the Bill he omitted that
entirely, having failed to catch the Speaker's announce
ment.
