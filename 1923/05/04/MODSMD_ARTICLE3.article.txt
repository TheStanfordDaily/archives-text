# Only Canoes in Flotilla To Be on Lake Thursday
## 
### 
Canoes other than those taking part in
the Junior Week flotilla will not be al
lowed on the lake next Thursday night,
according to a ruling pased by the Ex
ecutive Committee.
According to Dan Gage, chairman of
the Thursday night lake sports commit
tee, this will give more houses an oppor
tunity to enter the flotilla with their own
or borrowed canoes.
The University has agreed to extend
the wiring from the county road to the
bandstand, so it is certain that there will
be plenty of light.
