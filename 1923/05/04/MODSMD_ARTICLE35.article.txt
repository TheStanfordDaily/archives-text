of Maredret, who have preserved the art
of medieval illuminations for centuries.
Brilliant gildings and delicate colors

nuns of Scholastica. The illustrations
are all in medieval style and show the
Germans, dressed in medieval costume
and armament, carrying on their war ac
tivities among the Belgian people.
