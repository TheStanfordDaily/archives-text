UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGANâ€”The
third annual Military Ball held recent
ly at the university was a spectacle re
splendent with military glory. The
two gymnasiums were thrown to
gether into one huge and attractive
ballroom. The large dance floor was
topped with hundreds of flags of the
Allies, and the walls of the gymnasium
were hidden by an attractive blue,
while great gold streamers floated
across the ceiling. Three prominent
orchestras on individual latticed plat
forms, nearly hidden from view by
hosts of palms, furnished continuous
music throughout the evening.
