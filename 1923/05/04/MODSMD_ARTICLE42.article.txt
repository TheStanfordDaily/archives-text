# Color Work in 1924 Quad To Surpass All Previous Stanford Year Books
## 
### 
Color work in greater amount than has
ever before been used in a Stanford year
book will be printed in the 1924 Quad,
which will appear on the campus shortly
after June 1.
Last year the high-water mark up to
that time in color work was reached, with
five paintings by Spencer Mackay and
Constance Mackay. This year, however,
there will be a total of seven paintings
reproduced in the Quad. Three different
artists will be representedâ€”James Swin
nerton, whose works have achieved in
ternational reputation; Pedro Leinos,
who has made a special dedicatory paint
ing; and Harold von Schmidt, whose
work for the Sunset Magazine has made
him well known to Western readers.
