### 
Word was received yesterday that the
French government had conferred pos
thumously upon Alan Hammon Nichols,

overseas with the first Stanford ambu
lance unit. During the six months of
his enlistment he served near Verdun.

vice, trained in acrobatic flying, joined
Spad Escadrille No. 85, and, in the
spring of 1918, was the only American
left in the small remnant of that ill
fated unit.
While he was seeking to be trans
ferred to the American service the call
came for flyers to stop the great Ger
man drive of 1918.
Nichols responded to the call, assisted
in patrolling the German lines, and re
ceived fatal wounds in a spectacular air
battle with three German planes. He
was attacking two German planes, one of
which he disabled, when a third enemy
machine dove at him from ambush.
Nichols' machine was riddled by more
than seventy-five bullets, and he received
a single shot. Although fatally wound
ed, he succeeded in making a landing
within the French lines. He died on
June 13, 1918, at Compeigne.
For this action and for bringing down
a German machine, he was awarded two
citations and later the Croix de Guerre
with two palms was given him. Allen j
M. Ashe of Nirvana, Illinois, was the I
other American to receive the Medaille
Militaire in this same award.
