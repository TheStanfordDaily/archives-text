# Many Stanford Students Attend Church, Says Dr. D.C. Gardner

"Eighty-six per cent of the students at
Stanford have some church preference
or are members of a church," stated Dr.
D. C. Gardner, in an interview on the
part played by religion in the life of the
average student.
"Young men and women come to col
lege their lives are filled with new activ
ity, physical, mental, and social, and often
they are in a state of reaction concerning
home and the church. They rejoice in
their new liberty.
"But Stanford students are fairly loyal
to the habit of public worship. Literally
hundreds of them attend church every
Sunday," he continued. "This week an
average of forty-two attended morning
chapel. What Protestant or even Catho
lic church could boast a daily attendance
of that size at ten minutes to eight in
the morning?"
Dr. Gardner explained that even if
many failed to attend public worship this
did not mean that they also failed in
the "reverences of life." There are many
things in the life of a great University
which are naturally disturbing to young
minds. Science and philosophy were

cited as examples of this statement, for
they so often appear to be directly op
posed to all that is stressed in religion.
"But all truth is one and there can be
no opposition between true science and
true religion, though it is sometimes diffi
cult for youth to distinguish between
faith and knowledge. The lirst word of
religion is not 'I know,' but 'I believe.'
"The principles of spiritual religion
are beyond demonstration, but not be
yond reason, and eventually the honest
student discovers that there is no contra
diction between knowledge of the phe
nomena of the universe and the postulate
God.
"For many students the fact that the
Memorial Church is absolutely non-sec
tarian, putting no particular stress on
creed or ceremonial and exercising no
compulsion, makes it a more potent fac
tor in religious life. I believe that re
ligious life at Stanford is thoroughly
healthy and that all that is done in con
nection ith the church as the religious
heart of the college is done with sim
plicity, sincerity, and spiritual idealism,"
Dr. Gardner concluded.
