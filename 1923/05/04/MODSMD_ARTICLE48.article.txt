TJNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS â€”
Modern beauties are at a disadvan
tage when placed beside the Egyptian
Princesses of two thousand years ago,
says E. O. Hoppe, a noted photogra
pher who conducted a recent beauty
contest in the United States. Mr.
Hoppe believes that if the Egyptian
women of two thousand years ago were
placed along side of the most beautiful
of the women among the American
and English of today, those modern
beauties would stand no chance what
soever.
