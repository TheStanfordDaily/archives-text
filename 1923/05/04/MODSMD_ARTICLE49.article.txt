# Professor E.A. Cottrell Talks to History Club
## 
### 
"The man who would accomplish
great things must have a strong moral
background, strength of character,
physique and personality," said Pro
fessor E. A. Cottrell of the Political
Science department, speaking before
the History Club yesterday evening.
Professor Cottrell has been making
a study of history as biography and
has come to the conclusion that there

is much parallelism in the lives of
great men. According to Professor
Cottrell, almost all of the great men in
early American history have had a
strain of Scotch ancestry. Their school
and college training influenced them
toward the profession which they
finally took up.
It is interesting to know that most
of the distinguished Americans of
Colonial days were married twice, and
that in most cases it was the second
wife who did most to aid her husband
to success.
