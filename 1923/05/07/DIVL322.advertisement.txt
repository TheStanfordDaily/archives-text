How will yon spend
your vacation ?
Fritter it away at a summer resort with unex
pected incidental expenses piling up ?
Or go to Europe on a basis of actual economy
—perhaps for less than the summer resort
outlay — and have something real and worth
while to remember?
You can do this if you book via one of our
cabin steamers. There are 14 of them —steady
sailers all — including some of the finest ships
in the North Atlantic.
Accommodations as low as $115. You have the
best the ship affords in food and service — full
run of spacious decks, attractive public rooms,
all the pleasures of a summer sea voyage—itself
the best of vacations. Some of the most pleas
ant friendships of your life may be formed on
shipboard.
Write us today for our booklet —"Your Trip
to Europe"— and detailed information.

Makes the Hair Stay Combed
ry—-—
How will yon spend
your vacation ?
Fritter it away at a summer resort with unex
pected incidental expenses piling up ?
Or go to Europe on a basis of actual economy
—perhaps for less than the summer resort
outlay — and have something real and worth
while to remember?
You can do this if you book via one of our
cabin steamers. There are 14 of them —steady
sailers all — including some of the finest ships
in the North Atlantic.
Accommodations as low as $115. You have the
best the ship affords in food and service — full
run of spacious decks, attractive public rooms,
all the pleasures of a summer sea voyage—itself
the best of vacations. Some of the most pleas
ant friendships of your life may be formed on
shipboard.
Write us today for our booklet —"Your Trip
to Europe"— and detailed information.
