Five Used in Opera
Reggie, played by Albert Gregerson,
has ideas of his own as to what will
get over with Dorothy. He represents
the appeal of one of the dazzling
American blue-bloods. The next com
petitor is the suave Swami, crystal
gazer of the Far East, who sees in
Dorothy the embodiment of the fanci
ful and beautiful. imageries and va
garies of his mystical oriental imagi
nation. Robert Carr will carry Swami's
philosophy to the effervescent Dor
othy.
Richard Faville takes the role of Art
Kelly, the athlete, who comes nearest
to being the exponent of the caveman,
gaspipe tactics. The last and most
neglected of the five contenders Is the
Doctor, taken by Murray Ward. A
superabundance of sentimentality
sickens his medicine.
Dorothy, played by Esther Flowers,
is the center of all attentions. She has
the charm to keep all five types in a
continual round of ecstasy and grief.
More magnetic than golf, sweeter than
the best Burgundy, they say of her.
