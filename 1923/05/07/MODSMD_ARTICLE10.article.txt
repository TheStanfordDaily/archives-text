# University Gasse Shoppe Will Open Late This Week
## 
### 
As consolation for the defeat handed
to the Bakersfield Standard Oil Com
pany team by the varsity nine, the Uni
versity will start pumping oil into the
much-maligned student automobile some
time this week. The building purchased
from the Shell Company has been moved
into position just west of Eddie Lamb's
firehouse, and the final details will soon
be accomplished.
According to Lamb, the new station
will eliminate fire hazard in two or three
ways, and prove a great convenience to
students and campus residents. The trip
to Palo Alto drains out a goodly amount
of the precious fluid, and is also said to
entice the student into abandoning his
books in favor of the cinema. It has
not been stated that the attendant will
instruct each collegiate Gasoline Gus to
fly back home and rush himself Phi Bete,
but the moral effect will be to that end.
The station will not be run for profit,
as gas and oil will be wrapped up for
just enough to cover operating expenses.
The advantage to the University will lie
in the lessening of fire hazard, with a
possible reduction in insurance rates,
which would benefit the Row as well as
the Comptroller's office. Reports that
the station would be operated by faculty
members in free hours has been indig
nantly denied.
