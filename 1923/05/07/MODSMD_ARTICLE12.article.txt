## 
### 
Sam Mendenhall and Peggy Richard
son were crowned king and queen of
Stanford's first Carnival Masque Fri
day evening in the Pavilion.
The masquerade opened with a grand
march, led by the unknown king and
queen. The course of the promenade
wound upstairs and down the chute, and
here President Wilbur put one over on
the others. As one onlooker remarked,
"Everyone had to slide down the chute
except President Wilbur; lie sat down
i and his feet reached."
