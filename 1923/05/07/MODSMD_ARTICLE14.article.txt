# FRESHMAN NINE WINS FROM NORMAL SCHOOL
## San Jose Baseball Men Lose, 12-6; Oviatt and Nevers Twirl for First-Year Men 
### 
Psychology was the main factor in the
defeat of the San Jose State Normal
School baseball team by the freshman
nine on the varsity diamond Saturday
morning, when the Babe players literally
talked their opponents out of a 4-0 vic
tory and then hammered over enough
runs to win, 12-6.
The game started as a pitchers' duel
with Oviatt on the mound for the fresh
men and Saxe doing the mound duty for
the Normal team.' For three innings
neither team hit the ball. Oviatt, who
got on base in the third through an er
ror, hurt his ankle sliding into second
and was forced to retire. Nevers took
up the pitching burden and retired the
San Jose nine in order in the next frame,
but they found him in the remaining in
nings and scorcd their six runs, four in
the sixth and two more in the eighth.
The freshmen stepped to the plate in
the seventh inning with four runs against
them and by the use of bunts and much
talking to the pitcher got the whole in
field up in the air and shoved five runs
over on four hits and a pass. In the
next inning the San Jose men came back
with two more runs, when Nevers went
wild and Meiklcjohn pulled an error in
center field.
But not beaten with this handicap the
first-year men proceeded to keep Saxe
up in the air and soon had hammered out
enough runs to put the game on ice and
call for a relief pitcher. The seven runs
in this frame camc on four solid smashes
and a pass, aided by. two errors.
Nevers and Oviatt made four strike
outs and Saxe had nine to his credit.
The freshmen made eight hits to their
opponents six, and two errors to the
same for San Jose.
The freshmen will continue to prac
tice for the next week or two with prob
ably two more games, the opponents and
dates to be announced later.
