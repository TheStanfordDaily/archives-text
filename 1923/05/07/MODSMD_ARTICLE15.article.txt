# VARSITY TAKES 7-2 GAME IN BAKERSFIELD
## 
### 
Stanford defated the Bakersfield Stan-
I dard Oil Company nine last Saturday
I afternoon by a 7 to 2 score in the first
j game of the varsity southern trip. The
| team was still on the heavy-hitting ram
-1 page inaugurated in the last Olympic
Club game, and home runs by Carver
and Peavy helped considerably.
Solomon pitched a splendid game, is
suing seven scattered hits and fanning
nine men. The varsity perpetrated eight
safe blows and one error.
Stanford's first counters came in the
j fifth inning, when Carver drove Parker
i across the plate with the first Babe Ruth
j episode of the day. Two more came in
the eighth, and in the ninth Peavy clout
ed the ball over the fence with Mc-
Candless on base. One more run came
in after this.
The Standard Oil Company had a fast
team made up of selected Valley players.
