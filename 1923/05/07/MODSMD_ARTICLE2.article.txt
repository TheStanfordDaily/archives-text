# ERNST BRANDSTEN'S SEARSVILLE CAMP OPENED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Ernst Brandsten, coach of the Stan
ford swimming and water polo teams,
opened his new resort, Camp Searsville,
last Saturday. The opening day was
featured by a huge barbecue, at which
about 120 guests were present. Included
among the guests were President Wil
bur, Comptroller Roth, and the Stanford
faculty.
On Sunday, the first day the new camp
was open to visitors, more than 150 peo
ple, many of whom were students, visited
the camp.
Camp Searsville contains about sixty
acres of pretty camping ground, facing
on Lake Searsville. The grounds are
well laid out, contributing in some way
to the beauty of the camp. The temper
ature is always cool and delightful, due
to the proximity of the lake.
Many cabins and tents have been set
up, providing ample accommodations to
week-end visitors, or for those who de
side to spend an even longer time.
Drinking water, from a well on the
camp's grounds has been piped to each
of the tents and cabins.
Among the many features of Camp
Searsville are its facilities for swimming
and boating. The lake offers splendid
opportunities for both. According to
Brandsten, rowboats and canoes may be
rented at the boathouse.
The combined boathouse and refresh
ment booth complete the equipment of
the new camp. All types of soft drinks
and refreshments are dispensed here.
Due to the interest and enthusiasm
shown by the visitors and guests, and by
the public at large, Brandsten expects
Camp Searsville to be an unqualified sue-
