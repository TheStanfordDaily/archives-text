Whatever else one may say about Upton Sinclair's
"Goose-Step," we must admit that the book is being
read. Objection from several quarters to the publica
tion of a decision reached at a student discussion last
week as the latest Stanford reaction to some of the
statements made in the wholesale condemnation of
the American university system, is an indication of
the harmful use that may be made of such a book.
Granting - that "Upton Sinclair is entirely justified"
in some of the charges he makes, for Euphronia So
ciety to come to a definite public decision approving
the Sinclair tirade in entirety after an evening's dis
cussion, is unwiselto say the least. Sinclair spent a
great deal of time collecting facts, pseudo-facts, and
quotations dealing with only a few aspects of higher
education, and those only in their unfavorable light.
It is a mistake either to reject or to accept unquali
fiedly his accusations without spending some little
time in investigation.
As to the immediate Stanford interest in the book,
most of us are not willing to accept the statement
that "several well-known American college profes
sors have been dismissed from Stanford because of
their personal convictions," without more tangible
proof than has been given out.
It is a highly debatable question whether there is
nearly as much intolerance of the expression of
"personal convictions" from the Administration as
from the student-body itself. You will find the aver
age professor or the average University official more
inclined to listen to opinions, whatever they may be,
than the average student.
A Stanford professor who has some valuable ideas
upon German life and letters recently hesitated in
giving them to the Daily Palo Alto through fear
of being condemned as pro-German. But it was
not the prospect of dismissal from the faculty which
caused this hesitation as much as the probability of
misinterpretation and condemnation from the local
community at large, which is composed, for the
greater part, of students.
We admire a man with the "courage of his con
victions" but part of the process of acquiring con
victions is the accumulation of factsâ€”and the more
facts we gather, the less ready we should be to be
wholesale or positive iti our convictions, unless we
reject all data which does not go directly to prove
the postulate upon which we have set out.
