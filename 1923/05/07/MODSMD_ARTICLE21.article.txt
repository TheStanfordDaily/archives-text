# THE 						SCHOLASTIC HANDICAP
## 
### 
Stanford has established a reputation among prep
school students planning to enter college as a very
difficult place in which to keep abreast of one's
studies, especially while participating in any extra
curricular activity. The impression of the severity
of scholastic requirements is undoubtedly exagger
ated, but there can be no doubt that Stanford has
been in the past at a disadvantage when competing
athletically with the University of California because
•of the greater laxity in existence at Berkeley.
This fact has been the cause of much agitation
for the lowering of standards by the faculty. Much
more encouraging to those who have both the ath
letic and the academic reputation of the University
at heart is the news from across the bay that Dr.
W. W. Campbell, president-elect of the institution,
has announced certain changes in administrative
jx>licy "with a view to increasing scholarship and
eliminating friction in the departments and adminis
trative bodies."
The change as announced in the California Blue
and Gold which is of particular interest to us reads:
"Requirements of twelve units of passing grades to
insure re-enrollment by undergraduate students, in
stead of ten units, as at present."
It is easy to imagine the furor which such an
announcement will creat among the majority of
California students, but besides raising the general
educational standards of the state, it places Stanford
and California upon a more nearly equal basis in
athletic competition, which will be welcomed both
within and without campus walls.
There is another element in the announced policy
of Dr. Campbell which gives no little satisfaction to
Stanford supporters. It is the "curbing of the powers
of the academic senate, which is composed of high
faculty members and the vesting of additional power
in the heads of the various departments, a system
now in use at Stanford University." Imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery and this is not the first
time that such tribute has been paid to our particular
way of doing things.
