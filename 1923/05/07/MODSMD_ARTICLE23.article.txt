She —How many men are there in the XYZ Club?
He—Oh about thirty odd.
She —All of them?

"Gracious, but I need a shave," remarked the absent
minded professor as he surveyed himself in his hair
brush, instead of the mirror.
There was an old woman who lived iu a shoe,
She had so many daughters she didn't know what to do;
So she dressed them quite scantily and put them in shows,
And now the poor girls have all kinds of beaux

Knicker—What do you think of the modern jokes?
Bocker —Oh, they are about the same as the old ones.
Knicker—Yes, and a little older, eh?

THE LISTENING VAMPIRE
She listens while you whisper soft nothings in her ear,
She listens with downcast head while you tell her of her
beauty,
She listens with dreamy eyes while you tell her of your
love for her,
She listens further as you ask her to marry you.
And you take her silence to mean assent and you are
married
And then you listen and listen and listen and listeu
Forever after.

I met her on a train bound for the East. She had
been traveling somewhere in California; so had I. She
had the upper berth, I the lower. I gladly offered to
exchange. She gratefully accepted—and, our friendship
had begun.
Her name was Eileen. She was all of that. And more.
She disliked crowds; she could blow smoke rings; she
had smooth, tanned skin and teasingly perfect lips; she
crossed her legs without eternally pulling her skirts
down with a sub-deb smirk; she enjoyed George Ade
and Uncle Walt. She walked through the train without
lurching helplessly; she displayed exquisite finesse in
kissing; and, she never snored.

Angry husband to wife—"You're a dumb-bell!"
Wife—"Well, dumb-bells always go in pairs!"

Prof. Lacy—Now who can tell our chief exports to

In matters of love you will find
That the mole is most sadly behind;
For when making a date
They all operate
On the theory of "dragging her blind."

The Junior Prom is almost due.
Ye Gods! A date! Forget that too.
Let's see which Queen I'll deign to take.
Whose heart that night my line will break.
There's Jinny, Jean, and Margaret too,
But none of them this time will do.
At Charlotte, now, I wouldn't frown
If, Lord! she wasn't such a clown.
Louise and Jule aren't quite so slow.
And neither is sweet bobbed-haired Joe.
Betty, Bab, and Harriette
Have shown me times I'll not forget,
With Millison the list is filled
Full up with girls whose hearts I've thrilled.
I love them all and they like me,
But still this time I must be free.
So after all is said and done
I find that Sue is just the one
For me that night—l'll phone her fate.
BUT —Susan had that date!
—IJI.

THE LISTENING VAMPIRE
She listens while you whisper soft nothings in her ear,
She listens with downcast head while you tell her of her
beauty,
She listens with dreamy eyes while you tell her of your
love for her,
She listens further as you ask her to marry you.
And you take her silence to mean assent and you are
married
And then you listen and listen and listen and listeu
Forever after.

I met her on a train bound for the East. She had
been traveling somewhere in California; so had I. She
had the upper berth, I the lower. I gladly offered to
exchange. She gratefully accepted—and, our friendship
had begun.
Her name was Eileen. She was all of that. And more.
She disliked crowds; she could blow smoke rings; she
had smooth, tanned skin and teasingly perfect lips; she
crossed her legs without eternally pulling her skirts
down with a sub-deb smirk; she enjoyed George Ade
and Uncle Walt. She walked through the train without
lurching helplessly; she displayed exquisite finesse in
kissing; and, she never snored.

The Junior Prom is almost due.
Ye Gods! A date! Forget that too.
Let's see which Queen I'll deign to take.
Whose heart that night my line will break.
There's Jinny, Jean, and Margaret too,
But none of them this time will do.
At Charlotte, now, I wouldn't frown
If, Lord! she wasn't such a clown.
Louise and Jule aren't quite so slow.
And neither is sweet bobbed-haired Joe.
Betty, Bab, and Harriette
Have shown me times I'll not forget,
With Millison the list is filled
Full up with girls whose hearts I've thrilled.
I love them all and they like me,
But still this time I must be free.
So after all is said and done
I find that Sue is just the one
For me that night—l'll phone her fate.
BUT —Susan had that date!
—IJI.

"Gracious, but I need a shave," remarked the absent

So she dressed them quite scantily and put them in shows,
And now the poor girls have all kinds of beaux
