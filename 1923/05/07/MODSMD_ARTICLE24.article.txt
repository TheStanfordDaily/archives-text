# King and No King
## 
### 
Well, we have had our king and queen again; and we
have treated them as no king or queen was ever treated
in the whole history of those interesting personages.
Let that serve as a text to my discourse: I hesitate
to extend it lest I become provocative. Still something
must be said.
It might be well to start out by remarking rhat if wo
don't like our tradition, we ought to abolish it. To ob
serve five hundred people acting like spoiled children is
not an edifying spectacle.
But let me rush into the center of things and say that
we really don't know how to treat kings and queens.
If we did life would not be so miserable for the unfor
tunates who, yearly, hold the offices. The tradition of
aristocracy is a glorious thing; and if we could throw
aside our curiously anomalitic democracy for a night and
subjugate ourselves gracefully to the incarnation of our
ideals, we would learn something.
Instead we make a huge joke of the whole thing:
thereby labeling ourselves fools and dullards. We poke
fun at people whom we did not elect personally. We make
it evident that we consider the whole thing a fake,
from v hich we can retrieve ourselves only by being
dishonorably dignified. We hoot. Pleasant to think of,
is it not?
For the queen, I felt like taking up arras. It seems
that she existed for the simple purpose of being a
partner to all those people who never had danced with
her before, and probably never will again (if she has
anything to say about it, which she did not Friday).
Think this over, and see where you get. Space is
small, and I am disposed to do more than hint. But
really the spectacle of a beautiful young lady sitting
with a fixed smile must mean something. I thought it
did at least, and I was sorry.
