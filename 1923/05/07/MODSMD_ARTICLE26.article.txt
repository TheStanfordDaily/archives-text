# Here's The Culprit
## 
### 
"I've lost my bike!" is the Encina
rough's bleary-eyed cry, on finding that
his favorite spoked steed has disap
peared from the supposedly safe en-'
vironment of the Encina basement.
But the culprit has been found. In
a dark room, not fifty feet from the
scenes of the disasters, are stacked l
rows of lonesome bicycles, which grow
longer as the quarter proceeds.
They are housed there due to the {
carelessness of the student himself, for
printed on the wall whereon the bi
cycle leaned before disappearing, is a [
sign in sky-scraper type, "DO NOT
PARK BICYCLES BETWEEN THESE
TWO DOORS." Hence the difiugalty.l

Those unfortunates who wish to again
promenade the campus on two wheels i
see Fred, the Head Janitor at the hall,
and all will be forgiven.
