# TITLES SEEM CERTAIN IN INTRAMURAL BALL LEAGUES
## 
### 
The intramural baseball season has
progressed far enough so that predic
tions can be made in most of the leagues
as to the probable winner. Four rounds
have been completed, and with the ex
ception of a few postponed games, each
team has but one more game to play. As
soon as the regular schedule is com
pleted the winners in the different leagues
will play in the championship series.
In League one Sigma Nu and Kappa
Sigma are tied for first, with three wins
each. These teams wera scheduled to
play a game on April 9, but the contest
had to I* postponed because of rain.
The teams will probably meet this week
to settle the championship. In the fourth
section, the Alpha Delts and Delta Chis
are in the lead. The Delta Chi nine has
two more games to play, while the Alpha
Delts have but one more. Both of these
nines are strong and have about equal
chances of winning.
El Cuardo seems to have clear sail
ing to the pennant in League two. The
club men have defeated both the Zetes
Phi Phis, and are apparently superior to
the other three teams. Theta Xi is the
only undefeated aggregation in League
three. This team has defeated the Phi
Delts and Delta Tau, the second and
third place teams, and so should have
little difficulty in capturing the final
game.
The S. A. E's have turned all comers
down in League Five. They seem to
have by far the strongest nine in their
group. The closest contest has been in
League six, where the D. U's have won
four victories, principally by the un
usually strong twirling of Hylan.

The intramural baseball season has
progressed far enough so that predic
tions can be made in most of the leagues
as to the probable winner. Four rounds
have been completed, and with the ex
ception of a few postponed games, each
team has but one more game to play. As
soon as the regular schedule is com
pleted the winners in the different leagues
will play in the championship series.
In League one Sigma Nu and Kappa
Sigma are tied for first, with three wins
each. These teams wera scheduled to
play a game on April 9, but the contest
had to I* postponed because of rain.
The teams will probably meet this week
to settle the championship. In the fourth
section, the Alpha Delts and Delta Chis
are in the lead. The Delta Chi nine has
two more games to play, while the Alpha
Delts have but one more. Both of these
nines are strong and have about equal
chances of winning.
El Cuardo seems to have clear sail
ing to the pennant in League two. The
club men have defeated both the Zetes
Phi Phis, and are apparently superior to
the other three teams. Theta Xi is the
only undefeated aggregation in League
three. This team has defeated the Phi
Delts and Delta Tau, the second and
third place teams, and so should have
little difficulty in capturing the final
game.
The S. A. E's have turned all comers
down in League Five. They seem to
have by far the strongest nine in their
group. The closest contest has been in
League six, where the D. U's have won
four victories, principally by the un
usually strong twirling of Hylan.
