# Campus Gets Haircut; Result Provides Fresh Bovine Breakfast Food
## 
### 
Its haying time at Stanford.. Where
is the waving foliage than enlivened
the vista from the back door of the
Library? Shorn, denuded â€”piled in airy
mounds. Sequoia Hall is girdled with
new-mown stacks of bovine breakfast
food. The campus has had its spring
haircut; its blatant baldness announc
es a fresh supply of shredded hay for
those who are still wondering if those
pesky horseless carriages will run.
"Well," says the intramural base
ball outfielder, "I may now be able to
find some of those balls I didn't field."
So it's not an ill wind, after all.
