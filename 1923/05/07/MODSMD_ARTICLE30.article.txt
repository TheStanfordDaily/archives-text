# FACULTY MEMBER WINS PLACE IN NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE
## 
### 
In the recent election of Professor
David L. Webster, executive head of
the Stanford Physics department, to the
National Academy of Sciences, which
has just been announced on the campus,
Stanford has gained its eighth repre
sentative in the membership of this lead
ing national scientific society. This rec
ord is a remarkably high number in view
of the size of the Stanford faculty, the
number of universities in the country,
and the total membership of the acad
emy. which is only a little over two hun
dred.
Dr. Webster has been elected on ac
count of his standing in physics. Other
Stanford professors who have won this
high recognition for scientific attainment
are the late Dr. John Casper Branner,
Dr. Bailey Willis, now professor of
emeritus of geology, and Professors
Hans Blichfeldt, mathematics; Douglas
H. Campbell, botany; W. F. Durand, en
gineering: E. C. Franklin, chemistry; and
H. J. Ryan, electricity.
The National Academy of Sciences,
established during the Civil War to aid
the government through expert scientific
knowledge, has become the chief repre
sentative societv of men devoted to nat-

Ural sciences. Not more than fifteen
men can ever be taken in in any one year
and the number is usually less. An an
outcome of the recent World War, the
academy established the National Re
search Council, which it still maintains
for the purpose of bringing scientific
knowledge to bear on the solution of
various problems of the nation. Pro
fessor Vernon Kellogg, for many years
professor of Entomology at Stanford, is
permanent secretary, and executive offi
cer of this body.
