# THETA XI NINE WINS FAST CONTEST FROM DELTA TAU DELTA
## 
### 
After a close, hard-fought game the
Theta XI team downed Delta Tau
Delta by a 4-3 score last Friday on
diamond two. The game was anyone's
until the last inning and an overthrow
to third by the Delta Tau crew cost
them the game.
Neither team could score until the
second inning when Delta Tau slipped
in one run while Theta Xi garnered
three. After the second inning both
teams played air-tight ball, and it was
not until the Delta Tau rally in the
seventh that scoring was in order
again. At the opening of the seventh
Theta Xi was leading, 3-1, but the
Delta's sluggers began to find Marlow's
throws and they scored two markers
before he could stop them. This rally
tied the score and it began to look as
though the game was going to be a
Delta Tau party at the expense of the
Theta Xi's, but when the latter came
up to bat they succeeded in getting
a man on first. The runner worked his
way around to third and an overthrow
to this base let in the winning tally.
The contest was featured by the
hurling of both Collet of the Delta
Taus and Marlow of Theta Xi. Each
twirler only allowed four hits and
these were well-scattered. Delta Tau
was good in the field while Theta Xi
had a better collection of sluggers.
Seofield succeeded in finding Collet's
delivery for a neat three-bagger.
Alpha Kappa Lambda was scheduled
to play El Toro, but the game was
postponed. These games ended the
fourth round, and the fifth and last
section of the play-off starts today
when El Campo meets Phi Kappa Sig
ma; Kappa Alpha vs. Sigma Alpha Ep
silon; Theta Chi vs. Los Arcos; and
Sigma Chi vs. Alpha Tau Omega.
