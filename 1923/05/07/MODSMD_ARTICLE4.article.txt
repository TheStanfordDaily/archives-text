# FOOTBALL PRACTICE CLOSED BY WARNER IN FINAL WORKOUT
## "POP" TURNS GRIDDERS OVER TO ANDY KERR; TO START EAST SOON 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
"Go-go-gettem—Stan-Stan-ford."
It was the water boys and assistant managers who rent the air with this
yell on the kick-off of the first real football game of the sprnig practice which
ended with this same game Friday night.
The Red Shirts under the tutelage of Coach "Pop" Warner giving his last
instructions in the West for another year lined up against an equally powerful
team of White Shirts.
It was the Red Shirts' ball and they tore through one tackle and then the
other for two-four-seven-twelve yards at a time. Then the White Shirts re
versed the process. Down the field they carried the ball with Andy Kerr and
"Tiny" Thornhill giving advice and naming the plays. A neat pass over the
line, an end run, another long pass, and first down. But there was no touch
down, for even the White Shirts were forced to punt and the ball seesawed

>back and forth, for a good, long half.
It was not until two other teams
had taken the field that a score was
made, a split buck off left tackle net
ting a ten-yard gain and a touchdown
for the second team of Red Shirts.
New Faces on Squads
The line-ups of the first two teams
to take the field showed much new
material which has been worked up by
the coaches this spring. The Red
Shirts had Baker at center with Fa
ville and Cravens on each side of him.
At tackle were Loomis and Harris and
on the wings were Thomas and Middle
ton. Harris and Middleton are both
new men to the squad and both have
been showing up well in practice, espe
cially against the White Shirts Friday.
In the backfield were some of the men
on last year's squad. Campbell called
the signals at quarter with Dennis and
Cleaveland halfback. Nevers filled the
fullback position and has been doing
the best in that capacity of any of the
men on the field. Both he and Cleave
land have shown considerable driving
power and endurance in the practice
sessions and the whole backfield looks
good for next fall.
Cliff Hey at Halfback
On the other team were also several
new men. Hunt of the freshman squad
played the center position with Swan
and Armour at the guards. Swan will
not be eligible for varsity football next
fall but is about as pretty a player as
there is on the field. Mahan and Sholes
took care of the tackle positions with
McDermont and k Helser on the ends.
Sholes and McDermont are from last
year's freshman squad and Mahan is a
new man to the team. Wheat of last
year's varsity squad called signals and
Hey, the 1924 freshman captain, and
Kelley, broad-shouldered plunger, filled
the halfback berths. Stratton played
at fullback and his tackling and back
ing up of the line has been equal to
that of any of his rivals.
At the end of the game which
marked the conclusion of the spring
practice season, "Pop" summarized the
results accomplished.
"We have taught the men what we
expect of them and they know better
how to play under us," he said. "They
know more of the fundamentals than
a year ago. They have learned a num
ber of new plays which will be used
next fall and the four weeks of spring
training have given them a running
start for the next season.
"There have been few injuries for
tunately in spite of the hard scrim
mages we have held. A good-sized
squad has reported for work every day.
But the thing of greatest importance
is the number of new men we have
uncovered. We have a line on a num
ber of players from the freshman
squad of last year as well as other
new material.
"And these same men are going to
give the men on last year's varsity a
run for their money. Every one of
them is out for blood and each is de;
termined to get a place on that 1923
varsity. They have the will to do and
may easily force the old-timers out
of their places. A number of varsity
men were not out for the spring prac
tice and it will hurt their chances for
next fall and of those who were out a
number did not take the training seri
ously and work hard. They failed to
show their form and the green players
and the freshmen put something over
on them.
"It will mean that these same men
will have to come back early and work
overtime to make up what they lost
this spring if they want to stick with
the team."
Warner ended with this statement
and added that he would soon leave
for the south, then for Pittsburgh, not
to return until the spring of 1924 when
he will stay.

next fall and of those who were out a
number did not take the training seri
ously and work hard. They failed to
show their form and the green players
and the freshmen put something over
on them.
"It will mean that these same men
will have to come back early and work
overtime to make up what they lost
this spring if they want to stick with
the team."
Warner ended with this statement
and added that he would soon leave
for the south, then for Pittsburgh, not
to return until the spring of 1924 when
he will stay.
"Go-go-gettem—Stan-Stan-ford."
It was the water boys and assistant managers who rent the air with this
yell on the kick-off of the first real football game of the sprnig practice which
ended with this same game Friday night.
The Red Shirts under the tutelage of Coach "Pop" Warner giving his last
instructions in the West for another year lined up against an equally powerful
team of White Shirts.
It was the Red Shirts' ball and they tore through one tackle and then the
other for two-four-seven-twelve yards at a time. Then the White Shirts re
versed the process. Down the field they carried the ball with Andy Kerr and
"Tiny" Thornhill giving advice and naming the plays. A neat pass over the
line, an end run, another long pass, and first down. But there was no touch
down, for even the White Shirts were forced to punt and the ball seesawed

>back and forth, for a good, long half.
It was not until two other teams
had taken the field that a score was
made, a split buck off left tackle net
ting a ten-yard gain and a touchdown
for the second team of Red Shirts.
New Faces on Squads
The line-ups of the first two teams
to take the field showed much new
material which has been worked up by
the coaches this spring. The Red
Shirts had Baker at center with Fa
ville and Cravens on each side of him.
At tackle were Loomis and Harris and
on the wings were Thomas and Middle
ton. Harris and Middleton are both
new men to the squad and both have
been showing up well in practice, espe
cially against the White Shirts Friday.
In the backfield were some of the men
on last year's squad. Campbell called
the signals at quarter with Dennis and
Cleaveland halfback. Nevers filled the
fullback position and has been doing
the best in that capacity of any of the
men on the field. Both he and Cleave
land have shown considerable driving
power and endurance in the practice
sessions and the whole backfield looks
good for next fall.
Cliff Hey at Halfback
On the other team were also several
new men. Hunt of the freshman squad
played the center position with Swan
and Armour at the guards. Swan will
not be eligible for varsity football next
fall but is about as pretty a player as
there is on the field. Mahan and Sholes
took care of the tackle positions with
McDermont and k Helser on the ends.
Sholes and McDermont are from last
year's freshman squad and Mahan is a
new man to the team. Wheat of last
year's varsity squad called signals and
Hey, the 1924 freshman captain, and
Kelley, broad-shouldered plunger, filled
the halfback berths. Stratton played
at fullback and his tackling and back
ing up of the line has been equal to
that of any of his rivals.
At the end of the game which
marked the conclusion of the spring
practice season, "Pop" summarized the
results accomplished.
"We have taught the men what we
expect of them and they know better
how to play under us," he said. "They
know more of the fundamentals than
a year ago. They have learned a num
ber of new plays which will be used
next fall and the four weeks of spring
training have given them a running
start for the next season.
"There have been few injuries for
tunately in spite of the hard scrim
mages we have held. A good-sized
squad has reported for work every day.
But the thing of greatest importance
is the number of new men we have
uncovered. We have a line on a num
ber of players from the freshman
squad of last year as well as other
new material.
"And these same men are going to
give the men on last year's varsity a
run for their money. Every one of
them is out for blood and each is de;
termined to get a place on that 1923
varsity. They have the will to do and
may easily force the old-timers out
of their places. A number of varsity
men were not out for the spring prac

new material.
"And these same men are going to
give the men on last year's varsity a
run for their money. Every one of
them is out for blood and each is de;
termined to get a place on that 1923
varsity. They have the will to do and
may easily force the old-timers out
of their places. A number of varsity
men were not out for the spring prac
tice and it will hurt their chances for
next fall and of those who were out a
number did not take the training seri
ously and work hard. They failed to
show their form and the green players
and the freshmen put something over
on them.
"It will mean that these same men
will have to come back early and work
overtime to make up what they lost
this spring if they want to stick with
the team."
Warner ended with this statement
and added that he would soon leave
for the south, then for Pittsburgh, not
to return until the spring of 1924 when
he will stay.
"Go-go-gettem—Stan-Stan-ford."
It was the water boys and assistant managers who rent the air with this
yell on the kick-off of the first real football game of the sprnig practice which
ended with this same game Friday night.
The Red Shirts under the tutelage of Coach "Pop" Warner giving his last
instructions in the West for another year lined up against an equally powerful
team of White Shirts.
It was the Red Shirts' ball and they tore through one tackle and then the
other for two-four-seven-twelve yards at a time. Then the White Shirts re
versed the process. Down the field they carried the ball with Andy Kerr and
"Tiny" Thornhill giving advice and naming the plays. A neat pass over the
line, an end run, another long pass, and first down. But there was no touch
down, for even the White Shirts were forced to punt and the ball seesawed

>back and forth, for a good, long half.
It was not until two other teams
had taken the field that a score was
made, a split buck off left tackle net
ting a ten-yard gain and a touchdown
for the second team of Red Shirts.
New Faces on Squads
The line-ups of the first two teams
to take the field showed much new
material which has been worked up by
the coaches this spring. The Red
Shirts had Baker at center with Fa
ville and Cravens on each side of him.
At tackle were Loomis and Harris and
on the wings were Thomas and Middle
ton. Harris and Middleton are both
new men to the squad and both have
been showing up well in practice, espe
cially against the White Shirts Friday.
In the backfield were some of the men
on last year's squad. Campbell called
the signals at quarter with Dennis and
Cleaveland halfback. Nevers filled the
fullback position and has been doing
the best in that capacity of any of the
men on the field. Both he and Cleave
land have shown considerable driving
power and endurance in the practice
sessions and the whole backfield looks
good for next fall.
Cliff Hey at Halfback
On the other team were also several
new men. Hunt of the freshman squad
played the center position with Swan
and Armour at the guards. Swan will
not be eligible for varsity football next
fall but is about as pretty a player as
there is on the field. Mahan and Sholes
took care of the tackle positions with
McDermont and k Helser on the ends.
Sholes and McDermont are from last
year's freshman squad and Mahan is a
new man to the team. Wheat of last
year's varsity squad called signals and
Hey, the 1924 freshman captain, and
Kelley, broad-shouldered plunger, filled
the halfback berths. Stratton played
at fullback and his tackling and back
ing up of the line has been equal to
that of any of his rivals.
At the end of the game which
marked the conclusion of the spring
practice season, "Pop" summarized the
results accomplished.
"We have taught the men what we
expect of them and they know better
how to play under us," he said. "They
know more of the fundamentals than
a year ago. They have learned a num
ber of new plays which will be used
next fall and the four weeks of spring
training have given them a running
start for the next season.
"There have been few injuries for
tunately in spite of the hard scrim
mages we have held. A good-sized
squad has reported for work every day.
But the thing of greatest importance
is the number of new men we have
uncovered. We have a line on a num
ber of players from the freshman
squad of last year as well as other
new material.
