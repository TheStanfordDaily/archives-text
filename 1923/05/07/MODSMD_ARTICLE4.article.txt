# FOOTBALL PRACTICE CLOSED BY WARNER IN FINAL WORKOUT
## "POP" TURNS GRIDDERS OVER TO ANDY KERR; TO START EAST SOON

"Go-go-gettem—Stan-Stan-ford."
It was the water boys and assistant managers who rent the air with this
yell on the kick-off of the first real football game of the sprnig practice which
ended with this same game Friday night.
The Red Shirts under the tutelage of Coach "Pop" Warner giving his last
instructions in the West for another year lined up against an equally powerful
team of White Shirts.
It was the Red Shirts' ball and they tore through one tackle and then the
other for two-four-seven-twelve yards at a time. Then the White Shirts re
versed the process. Down the field they carried the ball with Andy Kerr and
"Tiny" Thornhill giving advice and naming the plays. A neat pass over the
line, an end run, another long pass, and first down. But there was no touch
down, for even the White Shirts were forced to punt and the ball seesawed

>back and forth, for a good, long half.
It was not until two other teams
had taken the field that a score was
made, a split buck off left tackle net
ting a ten-yard gain and a touchdown
for the second team of Red Shirts.
New Faces on Squads
The line-ups of the first two teams
to take the field showed much new
material which has been worked up by
the coaches this spring. The Red
Shirts had Baker at center with Fa
ville and Cravens on each side of him.
At tackle were Loomis and Harris and
on the wings were Thomas and Middle
ton. Harris and Middleton are both
new men to the squad and both have
been showing up well in practice, espe
cially against the White Shirts Friday.
In the backfield were some of the men
on last year's squad. Campbell called
the signals at quarter with Dennis and
Cleaveland halfback. Nevers filled the
fullback position and has been doing
the best in that capacity of any of the
