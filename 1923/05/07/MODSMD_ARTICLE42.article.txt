# Encina Rough Meets His Match; Unlucky Strike Raises Burning Question
## 
### 
"1 smell something burning. Wow—
my trousers!" •
An Encina inmate was illuminated Sat
urday with the feeling that a box of un
safety matches in a hip pocket is a fire
hazard of the finest.
Abrasize contact with a wall dis
charged the entire box in a razzle-dazzle
pyrotechnical display that would make
a torchlight procession look like Moses
when the light went out.
Unaware that he was the head of a
ramping comet, the youth left a trail of
sparks behind until his nose knew.
The rough was quick on the draw.
Rapid hip work retrieved the smoulder
ing fragments, and another burning ques
tion was answerel.
