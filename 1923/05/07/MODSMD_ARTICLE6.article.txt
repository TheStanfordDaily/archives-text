# Women's New Track Field Will Be Ready by May 26
## 
### 
Work has begun on the women's new
track field, which will he completed in
time for an interclass track meet that
will probably take place on Field Day,
May 26. *
The new field will have a fifth-mile
cinderpath with an extension on one side
to make a straightaway for the 100-yard
dash. Inside the oval there will be pits
for the broad and high jumps.
Sam Mac Donald is building the track
and Coach "Dink" Templeton has been
supervising the work.
This year's competition in track will
be limited to an interclass meet, but next
spring the teams are planning to enter
an intercollegiate contest.
