# INTRAMURAL TRACK AND FIELD MEET IS TO BE MAY 14-18
## 
### 
Plans for the annual intramural
track and field meet, to be held May
14-18, have been drawn up by C. W.
Davis, director of intramural sports.
Events divided over the four-day
period will include the 100-yard dash,
120-yard low hurdles, 880-yard run,
javelin throw, broad jump, shot put,
and eight-man two-mile relay race.
These events were selected so that
a large number of men will be able to
enter whether they have been training
or not.
The broad jump and javelin were
selected because Stanford has been
weak fn these events and it is hoped
that some new material will be devel
oped during the intramural contests.
A system of scoring points has been
worked out so that ten men from each
group to enter a team will count in
each event. Hence it will be necessary
for a house to enter at least ten men
in each event if that group is after the
first place prize.
A plaque will be given the team
scoring the greatest number of points,
and the man making the best indi
vidual performance in all events will
be awarded a gold medal. The relay
race will not count in the team's score
but a special prize will be given the
team winning the relay. This award
