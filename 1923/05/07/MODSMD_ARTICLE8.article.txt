# INTRAMURAL TRACK AND FIELD MEET IS TO BE MAY 14-18
## 
### 
Plans for the annual intramural
track and field meet, to be held May
14-18, have been drawn up by C. W.
Davis, director of intramural sports.
Events divided over the four-day
period will include the 100-yard dash,
120-yard low hurdles, 880-yard run,
javelin throw, broad jump, shot put,
and eight-man two-mile relay race.
These events were selected so that
a large number of men will be able to
enter whether they have been training
or not.
The broad jump and javelin were
selected because Stanford has been
weak fn these events and it is hoped
that some new material will be devel
oped during the intramural contests.
A system of scoring points has been
worked out so that ten men from each
group to enter a team will count in
each event. Hence it will be necessary
for a house to enter at least ten men
in each event if that group is after the
first place prize.
A plaque will be given the team
scoring the greatest number of points,
and the man making the best indi
vidual performance in all events will
be awarded a gold medal. The relay
race will not count in the team's score
but a special prize will be given the
team winning the relay. This award
will probably be a plaque.
The rules as drawn up yesterday
follow:
I—Open1—Open to anyone except men who
made varsity letters or freshman nu
merals this year.
2 —Method of scoring: Point system,
in which every man's record will
count.
3 —Record of best ten men of each
group in each event will count toward
the team score.
The schedule of events is: Monday,
May 14—100-yard dash and broad
jump; Tuesday—l2o-yard low hurdles
and shot put; Wednesday—trial heats
in the two-mile relay; Thursday—jave
lin throw and 880-yard run; Friday—
finals in the relay.
