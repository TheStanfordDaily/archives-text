# Decorators' Ball Planned For Workers in Pavilion
## 
### 
Ball three!
No, it's not a baseball game, only
another social function the Class of
1924 is promulgating tonight. Neither
is it a Boilermakers' Ball.
First, there was announced the
Corduroy Ball, followed closely by
plans for the Boathouse Ball, and now
comes the Decorators' Ball, to be
given in the Pavilion tonight.
There will be dancing from 6:45 to
7:30 for juniors only, and then the
powers that be have said that there
will be a surprise in store for all who
attend.
Queeners and roughs will receive
equal consideration. There is no ad
mission charge.
