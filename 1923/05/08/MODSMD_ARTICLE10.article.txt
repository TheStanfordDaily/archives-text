Each year-book usually follows a
certain type, and it is the aim of the
present Quad to include a scope of
Stanford activities that is wider than
ever before attempted. That means
that the past, present, and future of
Stanford will be represented.
As instances: The Quad will repro
duce a photograph of Senator Stanford
laying the cornerstone. This will be
the first time this picture has been
shown for more than twenty-five years,
as it was discovered only five months
ago in an old photograph album that
had been lying neglected in San Jose.
Traveling forward fifty years from the
date that photograph was taken, the
Quad will present an imaginary expo
sition of the routine happenings on
Registration Day in 1940, when the
greater Stanford that is now being
planned and built will have become
an accustomed reality.
The first "form" —thirty-two pages—
of any year-book are considered to be
the most important in creating the im
pression that lasts, and in these initial
pagefe of the 1924 Quad will be put
some of the finest art work available. I
Two paintings, by James Swinnerton
and Pedro Lemos, reproduced in the
standard four-color process, will be the
first to appear. Following these comes

a specially-designed "In Memoriam"
page by Harold Von Schmidt of San
Francisco. The next eleven pages will
be devoted to a photographic section
that promises to be unique in the his
tory of Pacific Coast annuals.
Pedro Lemos has designed for this
section a series of pen and ink sketch
es to accompany each photograph. The
photographs themselves were taken
expressly for the Quad by Gabriel
Moulin of San Francisco. This series
of combination line and halftone pages
will be prnited in two colors—green
and black —giving an effect of "vibrat
ing tints" which brings out the best in
both the sketches and the pictures.
Other features which will be in
cluded for the first time in the history
of Stanford annuals are: a series of
five paintings by Von Schmidt; ten
pages, distributed throughout the
book, of airplane pictures taken ex
clusively for the Quad by the year
book's staff photographer, Ed Strong.
'24; a series of zinco headings that
total seventy-nine—more than three
times as many as appeared in last
year's Quad; and pages of action pic
tures of the Big Meet taken by Strong
with a moving picture camera fur
nished for the occasion by Walter Fox
of Palo Alto.
