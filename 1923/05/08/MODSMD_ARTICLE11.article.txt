# JUNIORS' CORDUROY BALL WILL BE NEW TRADITION
## 1924 Dances in Clubhouse on Thursday, Opening Biggest Social Week of Year 
### Bradley Riter, '24 
Junior Week—the climax of the
, Stanford social season. Towards this
week in the college year, all social life
„ moves. Every year, the Prom and
r Opera come off as scheduled. Students
. can look forward to them just as reg
, ularly as the cow-bell in the morning
. which arouses them from contented
slumber. But the Class of 1924 has
added something new and novel to the
festivities—something which will prob
ably be perpetuated in tradition.
Ever hear of the Corduroy Ball- With
considerable initiative, the juniors have
, evolved a new-fangled type of terpsic
) horean pleasure—something informal —
. three hours of perfect enjoyment.
Junior Week is epochal. And '24 in
( tends to start things off with a little of
. its own merrymaking. The Corduroy
Ball will be a hilarious celebration by and
for the juniors only, as a sort of forc
. word for the rest of the good things to
r follow, which the entire campus can en
r joy
r Grinstead to Play
| Skidding will begin at 5 o'clock Thurs
: day afternoon in the women's clubhouse
; and will run into the evening until the
Quad clock tolls eight times. Grinstead
i will furnish the music.
j By all the powers, its is decreed that
• every 1924 man wear his cords this night.
. At first it was announced that at least
. one member of each couple wear cords.
| But a more thorough investigation into
i the matter led to a qualification. In case
1 the junior is a man, he must wear cords,
t But if the junior is a woman—well, any
t way. the edict as it now stands is that at
. least one member of each couple must
1 belong to the Class of 1924.
1 For fear some junior may tend to shun
. the Cord Ball because of his horror at
missing dinner, '24 has arranged to feed
everyone present. Fruit salad, sand
wiches, ice cream, and wafers ought to
be sufficient to tide anyone over for quite
a spell.
Music, Dancing, and Refreshments
The fee is nominal. One dollar and
seventy-five cents includes dancing, good
music, appetizing refreshments, together
with several novelties. And because only
125 pasteboards will be sold, every junior
should see one of the following men im
mediately : Harvey Coverley, Bob
Wright, Boh Cavanaugh, Joe Clark, Pete
Crandall, Art Bragg, or Don Lieben
dorfer.
The old adage which says that he who
falters, doubts, dubiates, wavers, demurs,
and deliberates will be proverbially out of
luck, still holds.

Junior Week—the climax of the

week in the college year, all social life
„ moves. Every year, the Prom and

slumber. But the Class of 1924 has
added something new and novel to the
festivities—something which will prob
ably be perpetuated in tradition.

considerable initiative, the juniors have

be sufficient to tide anyone over for quite
