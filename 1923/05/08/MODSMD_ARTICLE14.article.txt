HARVARD UNIVERSITYâ€”The libraries
of the university are contem
plating a new plan by which the stu
dents can gain access to more recent
literature. The plan is to sell all the
books which are old and not used and
replace them with new text books,
thus giving the students more benefit
from the library.
