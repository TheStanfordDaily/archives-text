# FIGHT AGAINST FIGHT AGAIN
## 
### 
Tribute to the action of Stanford students in
taking steps to remove the^ brutality and unnecessary
injury involved in the perversion of "freshmen
discipline" and class fights is paid in an editorial
which appeared recently in the San Francisco
Journal as a result of the recent scandal at North
western University, at Evanston, Illinois, surround
ing the death of Leighton Mount, formerly a fresh
man student there.
"Ihe traditional rivalry between sophomores and
treshmeh, reads the editorial, "is so much a part
ot college life that regulating it seems to be wiser
than trying to banish it altogether. Notable success
has been achieved at Stanford, by giving academic
sanction to the class rush, but confining it to a fixed
date and requiring ft to take place on the open in the
football field. Here the two classes assemble for the
regular annual fight, with the spectators on the
(bleachers. Ihe scrimmage has all the pep and physi
cal combat, but it is in the open, to guard against
ioitl play. When one side succeeds in tying up the
-other the battle is over, and all the demands of honor
are satisfied. By thus recognizing and regulating the
custom, the feature of guerilla warfare is avoided
and the sport made practically safe."
Obviously the reference is to the fall tie-up, over
which there has never been much controversy. Mob
foolishness led to unfortunate results in the baseball
fight of the spring quarter two years ago, however,
and students soon began to evolve some plan whereby
the custom might be retained without its undesirable
features.
Definite announcement of the exact nature of the
fight in the future is expected from the Executive
■■Committee, which has been considering various sug
gested substitutions and regulations, before the pres
ent college year is ended.
