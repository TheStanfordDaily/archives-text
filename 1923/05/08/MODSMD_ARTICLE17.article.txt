# 1924 AS HOSTS
## 
### 
The news column of today's Daily Palo Alto
are written for the greater part by Junior Class mem
bers of the staff in recognition of the fact that this is
their week in the college calendar.
With the Class of 1924 as hosts, the remainder of
this week is almost entirely taken up with spring
time festivity. What with dances, lake sports, music
and entertainment of various sorts, he is a fastidious
person who cannot find something in the three-day
program which will divert him. The work incidental
to Junior Week is being taken care of by the Class
of 1924, but the fun which results is for everyone
enrolled in college.
Nature has co-operated with the committee in
charge and promises such a week-end of sunshine
and blue skies as only the Santa Clara valley can
provide. With such auspicious surroundings, it will
be surprising if the week ends without several stu
dent romances considerably advanced—but that will
not frighten the average man or woman into con
finement, for this is spring, and what is college with
out a romance or two?
The carnival the other night proved that many of
us don't know how to have a good time. We either
are primly dignified to a ridiculous degree or we go
to such ends in acquiring cheer that we run amuck
with Men's Councils and there are all sorts of disas
trous results. There is a segment where the circles
of good time and good taste overlap. It will be a
worthy undertaking for the Junior Week celebrant
to locate that happy medium.
While we are being entertained let's keep in mind
the fact that the quality and quantity of the diversion
has been secured only through a great amount of
planning and work upon the part of the Class of
Three rousing cheer*.!
