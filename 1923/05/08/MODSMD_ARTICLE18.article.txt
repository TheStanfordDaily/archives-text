LAKE SPORTS NUMBER
The Jews have their Yom Kippur, the students of
Stanford their Junior Week. Short-changing ceases,
classes are suspended—oh, easy! Philosophers would
say that the world whirls regardless. It does. But con
sider the other things that whirl with it.

The wear and tear on spring dresses is awful.
The bottom of the lake is sown with invisible hairpins.
Three hundred become engaged.
Three become engaged to be married.
Fourteen years of sleep are lost.
The full moon has plenty of company.
* * *
Oh Mister Moon, what do you see
Suspended there so high?
Oh Mister Moon, if you saw me
I'll go away and die.
You must have been ashamed of me
As you sat grinning up above—
I acted quite outrageously;
I roughed Lake Sports—l'm not in love!

Now, as the piper said to Moses, isn't that just too
bananal!

X: Quite an artist, isn't he?
Y: Yes —he can draw anything but a check.
Z: That isn't funny!
* * *
Puzzle picture—pick out the man who is right.

"To arms!" thundered the master of ceremonies.
"To arms!" echoed the ambitious participants in the
bloody battle, champing at the bit and uttering wails of
willingness.
"To arms" whispered the very blades of grass and
leaves on the trees in the arena of combat.
"Whose arms.?" piped the innocent bystander, and the
Lake Sports were under way with the usual brass
barnacles.
♦ * *
Hair nets, hair nets, shattered, torn—
By the wandering breezes born,
Hear their erst-while owners mourn
Why and how long is a hair net?
♦ * *
Wandering little moon-beams
Flitting through the dew
Make a sorry co-ed
Look mighty good to you.

Homer Cayenne, '26, pulls his head from the syllabus
sheets to remark that they call it Junior Week because
it only lasts three days.
