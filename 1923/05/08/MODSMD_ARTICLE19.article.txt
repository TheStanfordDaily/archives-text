(In this column, zvhich is conducted by a Stanford
woman for Stanford women, communications ivill appear
each week reflecting the problems or aspirations of the
co-eds. Communications are requested from any woman on
any topic. Names of all writers will be withheld unless it
is otherivise requested. Address communications to Feature
Department, Editor, Pox 1304, Campus.)
What do college women talk about?
J. C. M. is inclined to think the answer is "Nothing,"
at least nothing of .2. serious nature. She laments the
lack of discussion of worth-while subjects quite right
eously, I believe. There is a great deal of bitter truth in
her communication:
"Stanford women have three pet topics of conversa
tion: clothes, men, and sororities. It is appalling to
listen in 011 the average conversation at Stickey's:
"'My dear, guess who he had to the formal! I almost
expired. . . and the way he used to rush Bee.' or 'They
were mighty luck to get her, I'd say. . . everybody
thought she'd go the other. . . she was there all the
last Sunday and. . . 'or 'It's absolutely the cutest thing
I ever ever EVER say. . . orchid chiffon with the dar
lingest little gold flowers on the shoulders. . . ' and so.
on ad infinitum.
"Triviality is the very essence of their thought. I used
to believe that this was just a surface gloss. But it
isn't. To mention any book beyond the caliber of F.
Scott Fitzgerald is to merit the reply, "When DO you
get time to read anything as deep as that? I never seem
to have any time except to glance through the Saturday
Evening Post. After I've done my outside reading for
that awful history course I got into by mistake, I don't
like anything heavy. I like to read for RECREATION!"
They do not seem to realize that genuine enjoyment
may be derived from clear-cut caricatures of Thackery
or the delicately-flowing prose of Walter Pater.
"Look at the last stamped date in those library
books that are considered classics. Food for thought
indeed! The last time anyone read Prometheus Bound
was April, 1913, and nobody seems to have had any
interest in Nicholas Nickleby since June. 1917!
"To mention any music beyond the caliber of 'Aggra
vatin' Papa' or at most 'At Dawning' is to stray beyond
the depth of most of the Five Hundred. They seem
wholly unaware that every Tuesday and Thursday after
noon an organ recital of genuine music is given in the
Memorial Church. Here is a real opportunity to become
familiar with Bach and Handel and Beethoven and yet
there were exactly seven campus women at the recital
last Thursday.
"There is 110 discussion whatsoever of the modern
drama and legitimate stage. It is too much trouble to
wander up to San Francisco to see a worth-while play
but who of them ever thinks it an effort to run up to the
city to the Frantic or the Palais Royale?
"There is no exchange of ideas for the very simple
reason that the average co-ed has 110 idea that every
other one of her sisters does not possess. They have no
more knowledge of ethics and philosophy and literature
than is required to "get by" in the easiest courses.
"Why, 011 why, can't we have some substantial dis
cussions instead of this marshmallowef-dribble! I actu
ally dread going to the dinner table. The only things
my table mates talk about, are food and examinations,
past and present. There is always profuse conjecture as
to what the menue WILL be and complete analysis of
each dish as it appears. Amazed silence follows any
attempt to discuss topics of the day.
"Having delivered myself of this tirade I shall cease.
But I cease with prayer and devout, hope that eventually
the scope of feminine conversation at Stanford will be
infinitely broadened."
What do you think of our conversations. Ladies of
Stanford? Surely we are not quite as feeble as here
portrayed. What do YOU actually talk about? Candidly,
now?

What do college women talk about?
J. C. M. is inclined to think the answer is "Nothing,"
at least nothing of .2. serious nature. She laments the
lack of discussion of worth-while subjects quite right
eously, I believe. There is a great deal of bitter truth in
her communication:
"Stanford women have three pet topics of conversa
tion: clothes, men, and sororities. It is appalling to
listen in 011 the average conversation at Stickey's:
"'My dear, guess who he had to the formal! I almost
expired. . . and the way he used to rush Bee.' or 'They
were mighty luck to get her, I'd say. . . everybody
thought she'd go the other. . . she was there all the
last Sunday and. . . 'or 'It's absolutely the cutest thing
I ever ever EVER say. . . orchid chiffon with the dar
lingest little gold flowers on the shoulders. . . ' and so.
on ad infinitum.
"Triviality is the very essence of their thought. I used
to believe that this was just a surface gloss. But it
isn't. To mention any book beyond the caliber of F.
Scott Fitzgerald is to merit the reply, "When DO you
get time to read anything as deep as that? I never seem
to have any time except to glance through the Saturday
Evening Post. After I've done my outside reading for
that awful history course I got into by mistake, I don't
like anything heavy. I like to read for RECREATION!"
They do not seem to realize that genuine enjoyment
may be derived from clear-cut caricatures of Thackery
or the delicately-flowing prose of Walter Pater.
"Look at the last stamped date in those library
books that are considered classics. Food for thought
indeed! The last time anyone read Prometheus Bound
was April, 1913, and nobody seems to have had any
interest in Nicholas Nickleby since June. 1917!
"To mention any music beyond the caliber of 'Aggra
vatin' Papa' or at most 'At Dawning' is to stray beyond
the depth of most of the Five Hundred. They seem
wholly unaware that every Tuesday and Thursday after
noon an organ recital of genuine music is given in the
Memorial Church. Here is a real opportunity to become
familiar with Bach and Handel and Beethoven and yet
there were exactly seven campus women at the recital
last Thursday.
"There is 110 discussion whatsoever of the modern
drama and legitimate stage. It is too much trouble to
wander up to San Francisco to see a worth-while play
but who of them ever thinks it an effort to run up to the
city to the Frantic or the Palais Royale?
"There is no exchange of ideas for the very simple
reason that the average co-ed has 110 idea that every
other one of her sisters does not possess. They have no
more knowledge of ethics and philosophy and literature
than is required to "get by" in the easiest courses.
"Why, 011 why, can't we have some substantial dis
cussions instead of this marshmallowef-dribble! I actu
ally dread going to the dinner table. The only things
my table mates talk about, are food and examinations,
past and present. There is always profuse conjecture as
to what the menue WILL be and complete analysis of
each dish as it appears. Amazed silence follows any
attempt to discuss topics of the day.
"Having delivered myself of this tirade I shall cease.
But I cease with prayer and devout, hope that eventually
the scope of feminine conversation at Stanford will be
infinitely broadened."
What do you think of our conversations. Ladies of
Stanford? Surely we are not quite as feeble as here
portrayed. What do YOU actually talk about? Candidly,
now?
