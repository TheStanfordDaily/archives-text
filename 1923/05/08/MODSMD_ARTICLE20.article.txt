Actors play to audiences for approval
that brings applause. But college students
NEVER. If you aren't convinced of this
fact go to a dance on the campus and
watch the dancers.
Enter a young man in a sorority house
or the Hall to £all for his fair companion.
\Y ith his coat folded neatly over one arm
and his hat held carelessly in the other
hand, the young fellow models his pose
after the Hart Schaffner &• Marx adver
tisements. To be sure there are a number
of people iti the room, but he would as
sume the same nonchalant position if the
room were empty. It's the most com
fortable way to >tand!
Enter the fair maiden, who comes in
to greet the expectant' young man. She
lifts her eyes to his, drops them, lifts and
drops them again, and repeats the process
about a half dozen more times. But do
you suppose she is doing this for effect?
She should say no—NOT ! Why her eyes
are probably weak, and the lights at most
campus dances are so bright, anyway !
Watch the dashing young man when he
is applauding for more music. While he'
is looking around he will encounter the
an appreciative look, he will turn his head
gaze of feminine eyes. After giving them
so his noble, manly prolific cen be seen to
the best advantage. Not because he knows
it is good-looking, but because it is very
impolite to stare at people.
Also the coy young miss is worth no
ticing at this interval. There arc lots of
roughs watching the dancers, and she
waves her fan coquettishly and talks in
a vivacious manner. Any girl on the floor
will tell you that the roughs are "simply
staring at her." And as the music drowns
out the remarks of the roughs, the poor
tiling is never disillusioned.
Further proof of the college woman's
disdain of applause may be seen at supper.
Notice tlie wide-eyed soulful look she
gives her partner over the demi-tasse.
Don't think for a minute she is flirting
with him. Heavens, no! She's merely
looking at him because there's no place
else to look. Why if she watched the
coffee it would make her cross-eyed.

tisements. To be sure there are a number
of people iti the room, but he would as
sume the same nonchalant position if the
room were empty. It's the most com
fortable way to >tand!
Enter the fair maiden, who comes in
to greet the expectant' young man. She
lifts her eyes to his, drops them, lifts and
drops them again, and repeats the process
about a half dozen more times. But do
you suppose she is doing this for effect?
She should say no—NOT ! Why her eyes
are probably weak, and the lights at most
campus dances are so bright, anyway !
Watch the dashing young man when he
is applauding for more music. While he'
is looking around he will encounter the
an appreciative look, he will turn his head
gaze of feminine eyes. After giving them
so his noble, manly prolific cen be seen to
the best advantage. Not because he knows
it is good-looking, but because it is very
impolite to stare at people.
Also the coy young miss is worth no
ticing at this interval. There arc lots of
roughs watching the dancers, and she
waves her fan coquettishly and talks in
a vivacious manner. Any girl on the floor
will tell you that the roughs are "simply
staring at her." And as the music drowns
out the remarks of the roughs, the poor
tiling is never disillusioned.
Further proof of the college woman's
disdain of applause may be seen at supper.
Notice tlie wide-eyed soulful look she
gives her partner over the demi-tasse.
Don't think for a minute she is flirting
with him. Heavens, no! She's merely
looking at him because there's no place
else to look. Why if she watched the
coffee it would make her cross-eyed.
