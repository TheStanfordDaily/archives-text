ern painter, has been hung in the Stan
ford Art Gallery, where it will remain

Many of the subjects are marines and
views along the coast of New England,
a considerable number of them painted
on the Isle of Shoals. The artist delights
in clear, vigorous colorings in sea and
sky, and some of his finest subjects are
those depicting the two where the clouds
blend them toother and the horizon dis
appears.
Altogether, according to Pedro J.
Lemos, director of the Art Gallery, the
group of Jacobs paintings which has
been assembled especially for this Stan
ford exhibition is interesting in its vari
ations, and displays a sympathetic mood
on the artist's part for nature's whims.
