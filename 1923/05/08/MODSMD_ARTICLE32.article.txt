## 
### 
Shades of the belles of former frolics
in the Pavilion! Memories of dear de
parted Cotillions, of promising Proms,
of jovial Jolly-ups. Why, they are scarcely
to be considered in comparison with the
latest invention for enjoyment, the Deco
rators' Ball.
The affair is scheduled for tonight and,
already, numerous charming co-eds of the
class of '24 have the notice neatly marked
in their little date books.
However, owing to the exclusive nature
of the festivity, no individual invitations
have been issued. A general request for
presence of the members of the Junior
class is cordially extended.
The opening feature of the evening will
be dancing, to the strains of excellent mu
sic, t rom 6:43 to 7 :30.
And then will come the real surprise—
the most unique form of entertainment
ever offered to eds and co-eds on a college
campus. A none-such ball.
It will not be at all necessary to don
formal evening clothes. In fact, Quad
outfits will be thoroughly suitable. The
very informality of the occasion promises
great enjoyment.
So just step into the Pierce and tour
over to the Pavilion at 6 :45 this evening.
See you there!
