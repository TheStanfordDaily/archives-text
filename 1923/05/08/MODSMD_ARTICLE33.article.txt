# Desprut Gang Threatens Foul Play; Murders Are Avoided by Fast Action
## 
### 
Murder was becoming no idle threat
on this campus. For the past two or
three villainous men had been seen
prowling about with determined looks
on.their faces, and an evil glint in their
eyes. Excited gatherings had been noted
in out of way places and rumors of foul
play were rife. Woe be it unto some
poor soul if they ever caught him. But
they didn't. The Junior Prom chairman
was informed of the plot and now 100
more tickets have gone on sale.
