# CAMELS REPLACED BY AMERICAN MOTOR CARS
## 
### 
American motor cars have begun to
replace camels as means of transporta
tion across the hot desert sands of Ara
bia, according to Raymond Davis, Amer
ican Consul at Aden.
A motor car service has been estab
lished between the towns of Djibouti
and Zeila, a distance of about 110 miles,
which is covered in four hours. Both
passengers and mail are carried. The
fare of 300 francs round trip is charged
or 400 if the passenger stays overnight
at one of the termini.
The Consul believes that as soon as
the road is repaired a great increase in
motor cars can be expected with the
ultimate operation of trucks and motor
busses. The road is level, but with sand
holes and rough stretches near Zeila.
At high tide, the road is blocked by the
sea at the entrance to Zeila.
