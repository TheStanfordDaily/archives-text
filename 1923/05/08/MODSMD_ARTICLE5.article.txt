Each committee chairman outlined
his part of the work and asked for
suggestions.

Opera, reported that rehearsals were go
ing smoothly, that the members of the
cast and the directors were working to
gether very well, and that all indications
pointed toward a wonderful opera on Sat

rangements, stated that numerous de
mands were coming in for additional
tickets to the dance, though the allotted
