# SATURDAY SPORTS TO FEATURE SWIMMING
## 
### Howard Bissell, '24 
Foiled again.
First one of the thirteen events on the
lake sports program for Saturday after
noon was cut of! but the members of the
committee not inclining to the unlucky
figure waived argument. And now an
other event has been excluded and the
list of events includes only eleven num
bers.
The first number tabooed, was a bath
ing suit parade to be held on the shores
of Lagunita as the opening event of the
afternoon but the university authorities
suggested that the event was unneces
sary. They refused to allow rivalry with
the Northwestern University co-eds who
arranged a "nightie race" from the wo
men's swimming tank in Evanston, Illi
nois, across the campus and back again,
and the more gentle sex did not relish the
suggestion either.
Boathouse Ball Cancelled
And now the engineers raise an objec
tion through Comptroller Roth, stating
the the boathouse is not sufficiently strong
to support the several score of dancing
couples expected to take part in the novel
Boathouse Ball. So the little act on the
rough boards of the second floor of the
Lagunita boathouse is off.
But the only difference the ban on
these two functions makes to the guests
is to get them home an hour and a half
earlier and give them more time to pre
pare for the Junior Opera in the evening.
The program as definitely announced
last night by Charles Fletcher, chairman
oi" the lake sports committee; included
eleven events. The first number will start
at 1 :30 Saturday afternoon at Encina
Pool. A Junior Pacific Athletic Associa
tion 220-yard free-style race will be held
in which a number of bay champions and
Stanford dash men will be entered. Fol
lowing that will be held the Junior P.
A. A. diving championship for men with
gold, silver, and bronze official P. A. A.
medals awarded the winners. These races
have been arranged by special permission
of the P. A. A.and will probably become
annual events on the Junior Week lake
sports program.
Lake Program Begins at 2 p. m.
At 2 p. m. the first event on Lagunita
will start with the Junior Week 50-yard
free-style race for women. A perpetual
trophy will be given for use in this an
nual event. The winner will have her
name, class, and organization inscribed on
the cup which will be kept in the trophy
case in Roble Gym.
The other events will follow at fifteen
I minute intervals. At 2:15 the Junior
Week Canoeing Championship race will
be held starting at the southwest side of
the lake and finishing at the boathouse.
I Two men will handle each canoe and \
merchandise prizes will be awarded the
I winners.
The fifth event has been made an an-
I nual invitation crosslake swim by special,
sanction of the A. A. U. and such bay |
stars as Lester Smith, George Schroth, I
and Ed Luster of the Olympic Club will j
take part with the Stanford distance j
swimmers. Gold, silver, and bronze med-!
als will be given the winners in this
event.
Following that will be held the Junior
Week Fancy Diving Championship for
women which will be another annual
event. Miss Bunting and Mrs. Brandsten
are preparing the fair swimmers for this |
event. Another perpetual trophy will be ;
awarded and the winner will have her j
name engraved thereon. The two wo- J
men's events are a special 1924 innova- !
tion which will be annual affairs at Junior '
Week carnivals hereafter.
The seventh number will be a Junior
Week Canoe Tilting championship, two
men and one long pole with a bundle of
cloth on the end to a canoe. The canoe
remaining upright at the end will be
named winner.
An Old Clothes life saving race will
also be staged. Two men will make a
team. One of them will swim in his old
clothes to a float in the middle of the
lake, remove his wet clothes and haul his
partner still in his clothes back to the
boathouse.
A Junior Week 50-yard free-style
championship swim for men will then be
staged, followed by a Junior Week Fancy
Diving competition. In the latter will
be entered White, Sneddon, King, Lynch,
Smith, and Gibbons, as well as other
Stanford and outside divers.
The final number will be an exhibition
of fire-fighting by Ed Lamb and his fire
crew. The new high-powered Seagrave
fire-engine will receive its initiation while
water and firemen will be everywhere on
the lake front.

Foiled again.
First one of the thirteen events on the
lake sports program for Saturday after
noon was cut of! but the members of the
committee not inclining to the unlucky
figure waived argument. And now an
other event has been excluded and the
list of events includes only eleven num
bers.
The first number tabooed, was a bath
ing suit parade to be held on the shores
of Lagunita as the opening event of the
afternoon but the university authorities
suggested that the event was unneces
sary. They refused to allow rivalry with
the Northwestern University co-eds who
arranged a "nightie race" from the wo
men's swimming tank in Evanston, Illi
nois, across the campus and back again,
and the more gentle sex did not relish the
suggestion either.
Boathouse Ball Cancelled
And now the engineers raise an objec
tion through Comptroller Roth, stating
the the boathouse is not sufficiently strong
to support the several score of dancing
couples expected to take part in the novel
Boathouse Ball. So the little act on the
rough boards of the second floor of the
Lagunita boathouse is off.
But the only difference the ban on
these two functions makes to the guests
is to get them home an hour and a half
earlier and give them more time to pre
pare for the Junior Opera in the evening.
The program as definitely announced
last night by Charles Fletcher, chairman
oi" the lake sports committee; included
eleven events. The first number will start
at 1 :30 Saturday afternoon at Encina
Pool. A Junior Pacific Athletic Associa
tion 220-yard free-style race will be held
in which a number of bay champions and
Stanford dash men will be entered. Fol
lowing that will be held the Junior P.
A. A. diving championship for men with
gold, silver, and bronze official P. A. A.
medals awarded the winners. These races
have been arranged by special permission
of the P. A. A.and will probably become
annual events on the Junior Week lake
sports program.
Lake Program Begins at 2 p. m.
At 2 p. m. the first event on Lagunita
will start with the Junior Week 50-yard
free-style race for women. A perpetual
trophy will be given for use in this an
nual event. The winner will have her
name, class, and organization inscribed on
the cup which will be kept in the trophy
case in Roble Gym.
The other events will follow at fifteen
I minute intervals. At 2:15 the Junior
Week Canoeing Championship race will
be held starting at the southwest side of
the lake and finishing at the boathouse.
I Two men will handle each canoe and \
merchandise prizes will be awarded the
I winners.
The fifth event has been made an an-
I nual invitation crosslake swim by special,
sanction of the A. A. U. and such bay |
stars as Lester Smith, George Schroth, I
and Ed Luster of the Olympic Club will j
take part with the Stanford distance j
swimmers. Gold, silver, and bronze med-!
als will be given the winners in this
event.
Following that will be held the Junior
Week Fancy Diving Championship for
women which will be another annual
event. Miss Bunting and Mrs. Brandsten
are preparing the fair swimmers for this |
event. Another perpetual trophy will be ;
awarded and the winner will have her j
name engraved thereon. The two wo- J
men's events are a special 1924 innova- !
tion which will be annual affairs at Junior '
Week carnivals hereafter.
The seventh number will be a Junior
Week Canoe Tilting championship, two
men and one long pole with a bundle of
cloth on the end to a canoe. The canoe
remaining upright at the end will be
named winner.
An Old Clothes life saving race will
also be staged. Two men will make a
team. One of them will swim in his old
clothes to a float in the middle of the
lake, remove his wet clothes and haul his
partner still in his clothes back to the
boathouse.
A Junior Week 50-yard free-style
championship swim for men will then be
staged, followed by a Junior Week Fancy
Diving competition. In the latter will
be entered White, Sneddon, King, Lynch,
Smith, and Gibbons, as well as other
Stanford and outside divers.
The final number will be an exhibition
of fire-fighting by Ed Lamb and his fire
crew. The new high-powered Seagrave
fire-engine will receive its initiation while
water and firemen will be everywhere on
the lake front.

Foiled again.
First one of the thirteen events on the
lake sports program for Saturday after
noon was cut of! but the members of the
committee not inclining to the unlucky
figure waived argument. And now an
other event has been excluded and the
list of events includes only eleven num
bers.
The first number tabooed, was a bath
ing suit parade to be held on the shores
of Lagunita as the opening event of the
afternoon but the university authorities
suggested that the event was unneces
sary. They refused to allow rivalry with
the Northwestern University co-eds who
arranged a "nightie race" from the wo
men's swimming tank in Evanston, Illi
nois, across the campus and back again,
and the more gentle sex did not relish the
suggestion either.
Boathouse Ball Cancelled
And now the engineers raise an objec
tion through Comptroller Roth, stating
the the boathouse is not sufficiently strong
to support the several score of dancing
couples expected to take part in the novel
Boathouse Ball. So the little act on the
rough boards of the second floor of the
Lagunita boathouse is off.
But the only difference the ban on
these two functions makes to the guests
is to get them home an hour and a half
earlier and give them more time to pre
pare for the Junior Opera in the evening.
The program as definitely announced
last night by Charles Fletcher, chairman
oi" the lake sports committee; included
eleven events. The first number will start
at 1 :30 Saturday afternoon at Encina
Pool. A Junior Pacific Athletic Associa
tion 220-yard free-style race will be held
in which a number of bay champions and
Stanford dash men will be entered. Fol
lowing that will be held the Junior P.
A. A. diving championship for men with
gold, silver, and bronze official P. A. A.
medals awarded the winners. These races
have been arranged by special permission
of the P. A. A.and will probably become
annual events on the Junior Week lake
sports program.
Lake Program Begins at 2 p. m.
At 2 p. m. the first event on Lagunita
will start with the Junior Week 50-yard
free-style race for women. A perpetual
trophy will be given for use in this an
nual event. The winner will have her
name, class, and organization inscribed on
the cup which will be kept in the trophy
case in Roble Gym.
The other events will follow at fifteen
I minute intervals. At 2:15 the Junior
Week Canoeing Championship race will
be held starting at the southwest side of
the lake and finishing at the boathouse.
I Two men will handle each canoe and \
merchandise prizes will be awarded the
I winners.
The fifth event has been made an an-
I nual invitation crosslake swim by special,
sanction of the A. A. U. and such bay |
stars as Lester Smith, George Schroth, I
and Ed Luster of the Olympic Club will j
take part with the Stanford distance j
swimmers. Gold, silver, and bronze med-!
als will be given the winners in this
event.
Following that will be held the Junior
Week Fancy Diving Championship for
women which will be another annual
event. Miss Bunting and Mrs. Brandsten
are preparing the fair swimmers for this |
event. Another perpetual trophy will be ;
awarded and the winner will have her j
name engraved thereon. The two wo- J
men's events are a special 1924 innova- !
tion which will be annual affairs at Junior '
Week carnivals hereafter.
The seventh number will be a Junior
Week Canoe Tilting championship, two
men and one long pole with a bundle of
cloth on the end to a canoe. The canoe
remaining upright at the end will be
named winner.
An Old Clothes life saving race will
also be staged. Two men will make a
team. One of them will swim in his old
clothes to a float in the middle of the
lake, remove his wet clothes and haul his
partner still in his clothes back to the
boathouse.
A Junior Week 50-yard free-style
championship swim for men will then be
staged, followed by a Junior Week Fancy
Diving competition. In the latter will
be entered White, Sneddon, King, Lynch,
Smith, and Gibbons, as well as other
Stanford and outside divers.
The final number will be an exhibition
of fire-fighting by Ed Lamb and his fire
crew. The new high-powered Seagrave
fire-engine will receive its initiation while
water and firemen will be everywhere on
the lake front.
