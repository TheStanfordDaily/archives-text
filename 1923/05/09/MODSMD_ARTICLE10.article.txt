# VALUABLE ETCHINGS GIVEN UNIVERSITY AS MEMORIAL
## 
### 
As a memorial to her husband, the
late Robert M. Loeser of San Francisco,
Mrs. Katherine F. Loeser lias given to
Stanford University a valuable collection
of engravings and etchings, including
plates by Rembrandt, the famous artist!
and leader of the world's etchers, and
by Durer, the greatest of all engravers.
Among the Rembrandt plates is the
"Hundred Guilder Print" of Jesus Heal
ing the Sick. It was so called because
early in the eighteenth century a print
of it was sold for that sum, about $4,000
in modern money, an astounding price
for that time. In 1893 a copy of it
brought more than $8,000 in a London
sale.
The collection, numbering between 150
and 200 plates, will be kept as a unit by
the University in one of its art galleries
under the name of the Robert Loeser
Collection of Prints. It will he the first
put on public display in the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Art Gallery this spring and
remain there during the summer. Both
Mr. and Mrs. Loeser were students at
Stanford, he doing advanced research
work in chemistry at various times, and
she graduating from that department in
1908.
The collection is especially notable for
its historical value, presenting as it does
specimens of the work of outstanding
masters of the last Tour centuries, and
especially of the earlier engravers and
etchers.
The collection was gathered by Loeser
during a number of years in which he
little by little gathered together examples
of the work of masters of the last four (
centuries, emphasizing the earlier en
gravers and etchers rather than some of
the modern masters usually found in
representative collections. In its own

field it is probably unexcelled by any col
lection outside New York City.
"Names famous in art history are rep
resented in the collection," says Pedro
J. Lemos, director of the Stanford Art
Galleries," and the prints, though many
years old, are in a remarkable state of
preservation.
"Rembrandt, the father of etching, is
represented by several plates, his Ecco
Homo (fourth state) and the 'Hundred
Giulder Print' of Jesus Healing the Sick
being the most notable.
"Durer, the greatest of all engravers,
is represented by five subjects, all of
them well known. Cahlon, Begas, Mer
yon, Romney, Van Dyck, Van Leyden,
Rajon, and other masters of etching and
engraving are included, with many
others.
"The whole collection is valuable not
only as an artist's collection, but also
historically; for it depicts faithfully
scenes and portraits of centuries ago.
The collection will be greatly appreciated
by scholars, and treasured more and more
with the advance if time."
Dr. J. M. Stillman, of the Stanford
Chemistry department, who is himself
deeply interested in prints and was ac
quainted with this collection during
Loeser's lifetime, characterizes it as valu
able in illustrating the development of
the arts of engraving and etching dur
ing the past four centuries, and espe
cially appropriate to a university museum
of art.
"The collection," he says, comprises
carefully selected examples of important
artists of the past four centuries.
"While certain of the more popular
etchers of the past century such as
Whistler, Hadcn, or Zorn, are not repre-
sented, yet very many of the most im
portant early artists, as Durer, Rem
brandt, Holder, Zeeman, Meryon, Rajon,
Wille, Waterloo, and many others sim
ilarly well known are represented by in
teresting examples of their work, while
many others not so popularly known will
be of interest to the student of art.
Many of these prints would be very diffi
cult to duplicate, and many would be
costly to replace."

etchers.
The collection was gathered by Loeser
during a number of years in which he
little by little gathered together examples
of the work of masters of the last four (
centuries, emphasizing the earlier en
gravers and etchers rather than some of
the modern masters usually found in
representative collections. In its own

field it is probably unexcelled by any col
lection outside New York City.
"Names famous in art history are rep
resented in the collection," says Pedro
J. Lemos, director of the Stanford Art
Galleries," and the prints, though many
years old, are in a remarkable state of
preservation.
"Rembrandt, the father of etching, is
represented by several plates, his Ecco
Homo (fourth state) and the 'Hundred
Giulder Print' of Jesus Healing the Sick
being the most notable.
"Durer, the greatest of all engravers,
is represented by five subjects, all of
them well known. Cahlon, Begas, Mer
yon, Romney, Van Dyck, Van Leyden,
Rajon, and other masters of etching and
engraving are included, with many
others.
"The whole collection is valuable not
only as an artist's collection, but also
historically; for it depicts faithfully
scenes and portraits of centuries ago.
The collection will be greatly appreciated
by scholars, and treasured more and more
with the advance if time."
Dr. J. M. Stillman, of the Stanford
Chemistry department, who is himself
deeply interested in prints and was ac
quainted with this collection during
Loeser's lifetime, characterizes it as valu
able in illustrating the development of
the arts of engraving and etching dur
ing the past four centuries, and espe
cially appropriate to a university museum
of art.
"The collection," he says, comprises
carefully selected examples of important
artists of the past four centuries.
"While certain of the more popular
etchers of the past century such as
Whistler, Hadcn, or Zorn, are not repre-
sented, yet very many of the most im
portant early artists, as Durer, Rem
brandt, Holder, Zeeman, Meryon, Rajon,
Wille, Waterloo, and many others sim
ilarly well known are represented by in
teresting examples of their work, while
many others not so popularly known will
be of interest to the student of art.
Many of these prints would be very diffi
cult to duplicate, and many would be
costly to replace."
As a memorial to her husband, the
late Robert M. Loeser of San Francisco,
Mrs. Katherine F. Loeser lias given to
Stanford University a valuable collection
of engravings and etchings, including
plates by Rembrandt, the famous artist!
and leader of the world's etchers, and
by Durer, the greatest of all engravers.
Among the Rembrandt plates is the
"Hundred Guilder Print" of Jesus Heal
ing the Sick. It was so called because
early in the eighteenth century a print
of it was sold for that sum, about $4,000
in modern money, an astounding price
for that time. In 1893 a copy of it
brought more than $8,000 in a London
sale.
The collection, numbering between 150
and 200 plates, will be kept as a unit by
the University in one of its art galleries
under the name of the Robert Loeser
Collection of Prints. It will he the first
put on public display in the Thomas Wel
ton Stanford Art Gallery this spring and
remain there during the summer. Both
Mr. and Mrs. Loeser were students at
Stanford, he doing advanced research
work in chemistry at various times, and
she graduating from that department in
1908.
The collection is especially notable for
its historical value, presenting as it does
specimens of the work of outstanding
masters of the last Tour centuries, and
especially of the earlier engravers and
etchers.
