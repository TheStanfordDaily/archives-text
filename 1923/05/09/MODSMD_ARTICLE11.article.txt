# Kappa Sigma and Delta Upsilon Nines Continue Winning Streak
## 
### 
The fast Delta Upsilon nine continued
their winning streak yesterday when they
beat El Tigre in a game that resembled
an intramural track meet. The final
score was 14-4. In the second game of
the day Kappa Sigma defeated Breakers,
7-1, on diamond three. This makes the
fourth straight win for the Kappa Sigs,
and they arc tied with Sigma Nu for first
honors in League one.
The Delta Upsilon game was featured
by four home runs during the game.
Boles helped to swell the total of D. U's
runs by slamming out a homer with the
bases full in the second inning. Hyland,
the Delta Upsilon pitcher, was the first
man at bat and he knocked the ball over
the fence for the first circuit clout of the
game. Hyland hurled a nice game and
the majority of El Tigre's runs were due
to D. U. errors.
Kappa Sigma garnered ten hits off
Lowenstcin, who pitched for Breakers,

while Hay of the Kappa Sigs allowed
them only four scattered safeties. The
fielding of both teams was close and a
pretty outfield catch by Middleton of the
Kappa Sigs completed a double play
against Breakers. There was one man
on base when Shipkey came to bat and
he knocked out a homer that netted
Kappa Sigma two runs. A lone tally
was all that Breakers could push across
the plate.
El Capitan failed to show up for their
game with Beta Theta Pi. so the contest
was declared forfeited. Delta Kappa
Epsilon was scheduled to meet Phi Gam
ma Delta, but the Dekes were not to be
found, so this game was also forfeited.

cial games arc being played.

uled : Sequoia second vs. Sigma Nu;
