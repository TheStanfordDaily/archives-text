# JOHNSON'S 1765 COPY OF SHAKESPEARE NOW AT STANFORD LIBRARY
## 
### 
The Library has obtained a set of
eight volumes of the first edition of Sam
uel Johnson's edition of Shakespeare,
which was published in 1765 in London.
This publication contains corrections and
illustrations from various commentators,
to which are added the notes of John
son. Prefaces are written by Dr. War
burton, Sir T. Hanner, and Mr. Theo
bald. '
This set is supplementary to the col
lection of all the editions of Shake
speare's works that the English depart
ment has been gathering for several
years. The collection is almost complete
now and only a few of the less important
editions are missing.
An old book now in the cataloguing
room at the Library is a book of letters
written during a short residence in
Sweden by Mary Wallstonecraft, which
were published in London in 1796.
The author says that she planned to
give a just view of the present political
and social state of the countries that she
had passed through. In her twenty-five
letters she describes the poverty in Swe
den and the slavery condition in Den
mark, but she thought, with it all, those
countries were advancing.
