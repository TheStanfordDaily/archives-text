# HIGGS BELIEVES EUROPE NEEDS STABLE FINANCE
## Normal Currency Is Basis for Reconstruction of European Nations, Says Speaker 
### 
"Every country of Europe should
achieve stability in the value of cur
rency in order to bring about the eco
nomic reconstruction of the nations,"
said Henry Higgs in his lecture on
"Financial Problems* of Europe" given
last evening in tbe Little Theater.
"Degradation of the currency means
degradation of the people," said Higgs,
"and the countries of Europe are en
tangled in a vicious circle of finance.
The budgets can't be balanced until
the currency is stabilized, and the cur
rency can't be stabilized until the
budget is balanced.
"With the exception of Czecho-Slo
vakia, the United Kingdom is the only
country that is paying interest on the
national debt and reducing it. If the
other European nations would follow
the example of Great Britain, the eco
nomic situation would be immensely
relieved.
"The difficulties of financial recon
struction are many. In foreign trade it
would be gambling to sell to the
German or Russian merchants who
pay for goods with almost worthiest
currency. The new nations of Europi
build Chinese walls of tariff aroun<
them to keep out the goods of their
neighbors. They try to strengthen their
own commerce, and this spirit of na
tionalism keeps countries in water
tight compartments."
Higgs discussed the financial situa
tion of Prance and the occupation of
the Ruhr. According to the lecturer,
Germany has been able to start where
she left off before the war, but France
was devastated and suffered the loss
of a large part of her factories. Con
sequently, the French government had
to ask the people for money in order
to rebuild the country. The interest on
the national debt was more than the
whole of the revenue that the govern
ment could raise by taxation. France
declared that Germany must pay her
debts or France would help herself.
Germany refused; so France marched
into the Ruhr to save herself from
bankruptcy.
In reviewing the economic condi
tions of Germany, Higgs said that
eighty per cent of the pre-war mercan
tile marine had been rebuilt, industries
had gone ahead, and conditions fa
vored producing a substantial amount
of the indemnity.
"The solutions of Europe's economic
troubles will depend on homely reme
dies and old-fashioned virtues; name
ly, thrift, work, paying off the debts
as soon as possible, good thinking, and
good living," said Higgs. "Patience
goes a long way toward solving the
problem. Not the kind of patience that
waits, but the kind of patience that
works while it waits."

"The solutions of Europe's economic
troubles will depend on homely reme
dies and old-fashioned virtues; name
ly, thrift, work, paying off the debts
as soon as possible, good thinking, and
good living," said Higgs. "Patience
goes a long way toward solving the
problem. Not the kind of patience that
waits, but the kind of patience that
works while it waits."
"Every country of Europe should
achieve stability in the value of cur
rency in order to bring about the eco
nomic reconstruction of the nations,"
said Henry Higgs in his lecture on
"Financial Problems* of Europe" given
last evening in tbe Little Theater.
"Degradation of the currency means
degradation of the people," said Higgs,
"and the countries of Europe are en
tangled in a vicious circle of finance.
The budgets can't be balanced until
the currency is stabilized, and the cur
rency can't be stabilized until the
budget is balanced.
"With the exception of Czecho-Slo
vakia, the United Kingdom is the only
country that is paying interest on the
national debt and reducing it. If the
other European nations would follow
the example of Great Britain, the eco
nomic situation would be immensely
relieved.
"The difficulties of financial recon
struction are many. In foreign trade it
would be gambling to sell to the
German or Russian merchants who
pay for goods with almost worthiest
currency. The new nations of Europi
build Chinese walls of tariff aroun<
them to keep out the goods of their
neighbors. They try to strengthen their
own commerce, and this spirit of na
tionalism keeps countries in water
tight compartments."
Higgs discussed the financial situa
tion of Prance and the occupation of
the Ruhr. According to the lecturer,
Germany has been able to start where
she left off before the war, but France
was devastated and suffered the loss
of a large part of her factories. Con
sequently, the French government had
to ask the people for money in order
to rebuild the country. The interest on
the national debt was more than the
whole of the revenue that the govern
ment could raise by taxation. France
declared that Germany must pay her
debts or France would help herself.
Germany refused; so France marched
into the Ruhr to save herself from
bankruptcy.
In reviewing the economic condi
tions of Germany, Higgs said that
eighty per cent of the pre-war mercan
tile marine had been rebuilt, industries
had gone ahead, and conditions fa
vored producing a substantial amount
of the indemnity.
