# HOW ABOUT THE MEN?
## 
### 
A contributor to the Daily columns yesterday
seems to be perturbed over the scope of woman's
conversational topics. Her analysis is correct to a
certain degree—but it applies to the men almost as
broadly with equally as inconsequential substitutions
■for the questions of dress and other primarily femi
nine interests.
It is not so much a matter of talking about trivi
alitiies as it is when to talk about them. For there
is a proper time for discussing each other's foibles
and interests of the moment as long as they do not
furnish the sum total of our conversational material.
Certainly not many of us would relish the company
of cither man or woman whose every word con
cerned some vital problem of the day, some philo
sophical concept, some late book or play. So often
that sort of thing is done for theatrical purposes, for
the satisfaction of personal vanity, rather than for
the vaguer desire of uplifting mankind.
He is an enviable man who can pass the time of
day pleasantly and chattily, and then, if the occasion
warrants, direct the conversation into channels of
more permanent value. There is a nice distinction
between the truly intelligent person and the intellec
tual bore.
