# JUNIOR INDISCRETIONS

Tire lure of gold has evidently affected the good
judgment of the Junior Class. The prospect of some
thousand people on the floor of the Pavilion Friday
night is not too pleasing to those who purchased
their tickets earlier and who appreciate a little
breathing and moving space. The juniors will have
to work hard to make the other features of their
dance compensate for the crowd.
Probably the excessive cost of the opera prompted
the class to gather in all the money they could lay
their hands upon. If that is the case, it is unfor
tunate that campus productions should require funds
approaching the cost of a Broadway show.
But the tickets have been sold and the opera is
about ready for the curtain. It might be wiser to
reserve further criticism until we see how the Class
of 1924 handles the situation.
