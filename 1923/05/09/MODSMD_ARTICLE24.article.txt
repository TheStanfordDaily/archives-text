# THE 						ARCH CRITIC

### 
Those concerned with the making of motion pic
tures might be greatly chagrined were they to spend
an evening with a college audience viewing one of
their productions. The director would probably
wonder why his supposedly correct love scenes were
so lustily booed; the technical man who faithfully
forged the Northwest blizzard swirling about the
fur-trader's cabin might resent the guttural sounds
arising about him that indicated detection of rock
salt snow and burlap trees. And the sub-title writer
would likely glance nervously at the frowning pro
ducer as unmistakable noises greeted his captionâ€”
"Gwendolyn became conscious of the great love that
was dawning in her lonely heart like God's morning
sunshine on a gray world." He had told his em
ployer that the Public wanted it served like that.
But the Public wasn't objecting: It was the out
raged voice of the super-sensitive College Audience,
eschewing sentimentalism, that was raised in protest.
