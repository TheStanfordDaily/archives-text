"With the Wits and Half-Wits," Iva Brandish.
The authoress has hit upon an entirely new device in
fiction. The hero is a young man, and the heroine is a
girl. They fall in love with each other while doing a
marathon dance in the first chapter, but do not marry
until the last chapter. The story is unique in that it
does not even mention free verse, free love, or free
lunch.
" 'With the Wits' is the snake's hips."—Heywood
Broun.

"Absolutely priceless."—London Daily Egg.
"Das bane good book." —Janitor.

trim.
