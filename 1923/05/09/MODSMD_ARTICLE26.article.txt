# FRIEND OSCAR
## 
### 
Meet Oscar: five feet eleven; light blue eyes; curly
hair; football; swimming; smile; walks like a two-ton
elephant crossing a one-ton bridge; a fraternity man
(Aha, you say, but wait —I have not finished), which one
is none of your business; so you needn't ask.
Oscar shall enter the story for your diversion; yea.
even shall he prance lightly to Bodleberry's for beer,
though it costa degree in the telling.
Having met Oscar, you say, "Well, how's things?" To
which Oscar will reply, "Jake." The ritual finished, it
would become you to heave a suggesting sigh (I don't
want all the blame) and to inquire, "How about the
widow's?"
Upon hearing this, I shall pretend to consider the
matter; don't be alarmed, I am only pretending. Finally
I shall accede, and the three of us will advance arm in
arm, unless your age prevents, to Bodleberry's.
Presently a most peculiar thing happens. Up the street
comes a cab, in which are two elderly gentlemen, both
very much excited. Each is talking very fast and loud;
each is quite red in the face.
When the cab is abreast of us, one elderly gentleman,
who is fat, smites the other over the head with a cane,
upsetting the other gentleman and causing his hat to
roll out of the window and into the gutter. Nobly did
McGoozle handle his cane, but as the cab trundles its
agitated freight around a corner, the sound of a face
being slapped intimates that, for once, Mundle has lost
his calm.
"They're probably goughed," remarks Oscar cheer
fully. The sins of the world make small impression on
Oscar's conscience.
While I agree to this, you may rescue Mundle's hat, a
stiff, high, unfinished derby: the symbol of a worthy
cause. .
Up the street speeds another car. Jack and his friend
the reporter are being carted to Bodleberry's, reclining
in placid ease, and smoking their favorite cigars.
By this time you have reclaimed Mundle's hat and, in
a spirit of playfulness, have substituted it for your own.
Needless to say, it fits you perfectly.
Bodleberry's is reached. And now appears Mrs. Bodle
berry, much out of breath, still clutching the two beer
mugs, and perspiring heavily. She spies you.
"I declare Mr." —(So she knows you)—, begins the
good woman, waving the mugs toward the front door we
are approaching, "It's a bad time you're come again, me
being away all this time to the House. 'Twas better than
a circus, just seeing those two silly old fools throwing
around words."
Oscar smiled, not because he understood what the
widow said, but because smiling was preliminary to
beering.
The dark has quietly settled about the old house; so
no one is disturbed when the- three of us follow the
widow inside for beer.

a circus, just seeing those two silly old fools throwing
around words."
Oscar smiled, not because he understood what the
widow said, but because smiling was preliminary to
beering.
The dark has quietly settled about the old house; so
no one is disturbed when the- three of us follow the
widow inside for beer.
DOWNING McGALLON.
Meet Oscar: five feet eleven; light blue eyes; curly
hair; football; swimming; smile; walks like a two-ton
elephant crossing a one-ton bridge; a fraternity man
(Aha, you say, but wait —I have not finished), which one
is none of your business; so you needn't ask.
Oscar shall enter the story for your diversion; yea.
even shall he prance lightly to Bodleberry's for beer,
though it costa degree in the telling.
Having met Oscar, you say, "Well, how's things?" To
which Oscar will reply, "Jake." The ritual finished, it
would become you to heave a suggesting sigh (I don't
want all the blame) and to inquire, "How about the
widow's?"
Upon hearing this, I shall pretend to consider the
matter; don't be alarmed, I am only pretending. Finally
I shall accede, and the three of us will advance arm in
arm, unless your age prevents, to Bodleberry's.
Presently a most peculiar thing happens. Up the street
comes a cab, in which are two elderly gentlemen, both
very much excited. Each is talking very fast and loud;
each is quite red in the face.
When the cab is abreast of us, one elderly gentleman,
who is fat, smites the other over the head with a cane,
upsetting the other gentleman and causing his hat to
roll out of the window and into the gutter. Nobly did
McGoozle handle his cane, but as the cab trundles its
agitated freight around a corner, the sound of a face
being slapped intimates that, for once, Mundle has lost
his calm.
"They're probably goughed," remarks Oscar cheer
fully. The sins of the world make small impression on
Oscar's conscience.
While I agree to this, you may rescue Mundle's hat, a
stiff, high, unfinished derby: the symbol of a worthy
cause. .
Up the street speeds another car. Jack and his friend
the reporter are being carted to Bodleberry's, reclining
in placid ease, and smoking their favorite cigars.
By this time you have reclaimed Mundle's hat and, in
a spirit of playfulness, have substituted it for your own.
Needless to say, it fits you perfectly.
Bodleberry's is reached. And now appears Mrs. Bodle
berry, much out of breath, still clutching the two beer
mugs, and perspiring heavily. She spies you.
"I declare Mr." —(So she knows you)—, begins the
good woman, waving the mugs toward the front door we
are approaching, "It's a bad time you're come again, me
being away all this time to the House. 'Twas better than
a circus, just seeing those two silly old fools throwing
around words."
Oscar smiled, not because he understood what the
widow said, but because smiling was preliminary to
beering.
