lished twelve resident fellowships in or- j
ganic chemistry of arsenic and mercury
at Northwestern University.
Fellowships carry stipends of $500 for
the academic year. Candidates having
research experience are awarded larger I
amounts. Work of resident fellows con-;
sists of research in organic chemistry of I
compounds containing arsenic and mer- j
cury. The work is partly synthetic and
deals partly with the detailed study of
the reactions of organic compounds con
taining these elements.
Applications should be sent to W. Lee
Lewis, Chairman, Chemistry Department,
Northwestern University, Evanston, 111.
