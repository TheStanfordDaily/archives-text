# UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON TAKES TO "BARNYARD GOLF"
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTONâ€”
Barnyard golf, that fascinating game
that is played so extensively in the
outlying towns of the middlewest, has
taken the University of Washington
by storm. The students in that institu
tion have reverted to their ancestors*
habits of tossing discarded horseshoes
at two unoffending iron pegs. Although
the sport has not grown to intercolle
giate size yet, it is being played by
the various student groups on the cam
pus. Competition is keen between the
Greek letter organizations, the prize
being a silver cup to the winner.
