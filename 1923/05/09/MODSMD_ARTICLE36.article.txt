# Five Hundred New Mail Boxes Planned For Campus Post Office
## 
### 
Five hundred new mail boxes and
the probable remodeling of the entire
postoffice are among the proposed
changes in the campus postoffice to
take place by next October, according
to Mrs. A. W. Thomas, campus post
mistress.
"These changes have been planned
ever since I took up this position over
a year ago," Mrs. Thomas says. "As
yet, things have been rather slow in
development. However, by October
plans will be definitely formed at last,
and 1 hope nearing completion. The ar
rangements are by no means settled
at the present time, though.
"We are planning the addition of 500
new boxes. Where we will put them
is the question. Of course there isn't
room for them in this building in its

present condition. It may be remod
eled. The government buys or rents
its buildings, so I don't know just what
will be done. There may even be a
change in the location of the postoffice
in order to find a large enough build
ing to supply the needs."
Mrs. Thomas said that she wants to
call the new special delivery box to
the attention of the patrons of the
postoffice. It was put in a few days
ago to secure better service on special
delivery letters sent out from the cam
pus. The drop is at the left of the
general delivery window.
"Please remember that the postoffice
service depends upon the revenue com
ing in, so buy your stamps at the
campus postoffice and you will help
improve the service," concluded Mrs.
Thomas.
