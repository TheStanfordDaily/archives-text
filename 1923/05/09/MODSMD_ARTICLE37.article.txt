# NESTORIANS WILL HOLD ST. IGNATIUS TRYOUTS
## 
### 
Nestoria will hold tryouts in Room
12 of the Law building tomorrow at
7:30 for its dual debate with St. Igna
tius. This debate will probably be held
early next month, and six men will be
chosen to represent Nestoria.
The question for debate is, "Re
solved, That the United States should
enter the world court." Speeches will
be five minutes in length with three
minute rebuttals.
Plans for the end quarter dinner
will be discussed at a short business
meeting to follow the tryouts.
