# Queen Vamps Jury And Gets $500 For Damages To Heart
## 
### 
"We find for the plaintiff and against
the defendent to the extent of $500."
But what can be expected from a jury of
students when the plaintiff is a campus
queen and the defendant a bearded
rough.
Counsel for the plaintiff, W. F. Leiser
and E. A. Hadley were able to make
their case stick, that the plaintiff was ar
rested without cause. Defendant's coun
sel, Claire Senior and W. A. Seamon,
contended that the complainant did not
look as if she has suffered any damage.
But the jury could not disbelieve the
story of heart failure told by the star
complaining witness, Miss Margaret Lies.
In acting, the Law School runs the
Junior Opera a close race, according to
the samples in the moot trial before a
packed audience at Room 214 last night.
