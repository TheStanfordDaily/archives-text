# FRESHMAN NET MEN TAKE TOURNAMENT FROM SOPHOMORES
## Fairchild and McCleave Win in Fast Match 
### 
By taking four out of seven matches
from their sophomore opponents yester
day afternoon on the varsity courts, the
1926 net team won the first heat in their
attempt to win the interclass tennis
championship. Most of the matches were
close and the result was in doubt until
the conclusion of the final encounter.
The most spectacular encounter of the
day was that between Fairchild and Mc-
Cleave of the freshmen and Aydelotte
and Murphy, sophomores. The match
went three sets, and the last was the
closest and hardest fought of the three.
The first-year men started out strong in
the first set, winning, 6-2, but the sopho
more pair were not willing to be so
easily defeated and they won the second
set, 4-6. The final round resulted in a
deuce set in favor of the freshmen, 7-5.
The sophomores had practically the
line-up of their last year's team on the
courts, and it was possible to get a line
on the relative merits of the two fresh
man teams. The results showed that
Stanford was probably represented by a
better aggregation of first-year men this
year than last, but two of the best fresh
man players went down to defeat when
Overfelt beat Coffin, and Aydelotte de
feated McCleave.
Tomorrow the juniors and seniors will
meet on the varsity courts.
