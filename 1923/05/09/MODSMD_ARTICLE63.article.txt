# DATE FOR LABOR DAY CHANGED TO MAY 23
## 
### 
Labor Day has been changed from
May 16 to May 23, according to an
announcement made today by Profes
sor E. E. Robinson. The date was for
merly set for Monday, May 16, but
was changed to allow several addi
tional features to be worked into the
program by the committees in charge.
The new date will be on a Wednesday
and will consequently not interfere
with the meetings of the various cam
pus living groups on Monday.
The plans for Labor Day will be
made so that the students, who will
be released from attending afternoon
classes, may take part in the work.
The committee members who are
working on plans have been requested
by Ed Butler, chairman, to make any
necessary changes to meet the ad
vanced date.
