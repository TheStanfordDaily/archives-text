# "FORE" CAST WILL GO THROUGH DRESS REHEARSAL THIS EVENING
## Elements of Good Proposal Analyzed by Authors. ALL THREE ACTS TO BE REVIEWED TONIGHT 
### 
"Fore" will be put through its first
dress rehearsal tonight, in preparation
for its presentation Saturday night. Fol
lowing the precedent of the last two
Junior Operas, the rehearsal will not be
open to anyone not directly connected
with the performance.
A complete review of the show was
taken Monday night and last night. This
was the first time the choruses and the
cast rehearsed together from act one to
the elusive curtain. Because of the
Corduroy Ball Thursday evening, the
second, and final dress rehearsal, will be
held Thursday afternoon. Director Ben
tinck is also planning to allow the cast
all day Friday to themselves that they
may rest up for the Prom, and keep in
shape for the opera Saturday. The pres
ent state of rehearsing indicates that the
cast can safely risk a "layoff."
The ticket office in the Administration
building will be open .tomorrow morn
ing from 10 to 11 and tomorrow after
noon from 1 to 2, providing the few re
maining seats are not sold out this after
noon.
