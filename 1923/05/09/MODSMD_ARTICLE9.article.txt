# "HAVING A LINE" IS NOT AID, BILL FINDS
## 
### 
"Your request for the surest system
to win Dorothy, the Junior Opera queen,
is perfectly ridiculous and disgusting. In
the first place, no nice girl would tol
erate what you call a 'line.' A man sim
ply must act in accordance with his own
character. I should advise your 'diffident'
friend to develop a little courage; if he
attempts to follow any of your proposed
'systems' his 'queen' will simply laugh
at him. If he is sincere he may have a
chance—girls don't judge men entirely
by their wit, you know. Please don't
sign my name to this."
The above statement is the winning
(and only) answer to the contest, "How
to win Dorothy, the Junior Opera queen."
Ihe author's suggestion that sincerity
and courage are the essentials of any de
cent proposal will be sedulously followed
Saturday evening when the 'eternal quin
te' attempts the conquest of Dorothy.
Bill Jones, played by Gene Trago, is
the succeeding one. How Jones is able
to sell his bonds and how he becomes en
gaged remains a secret.
It is Art Kelly, the athlete, played by
Dick I"aville, who has courage and can
did sincerity enough to open his heart in
rehearsal of the great moment, and in
duces the other three competitors to fol
low suit.
"Dorothy, I cannot help thinking of
the year 1 captained the Pottawattamie
High School eleven against the Ross
Valley Military Academy in our Big
Game of 1917. .. . Dorothy, I had to
stop that line and I did. I must do the
same tonight. . . . Won't you . .
Swarni, the crystal gazer of India,
played by Robert Carr, reveals the secrets
of his Oriental heart in a way which
suggests the entire character drawing
accuratcly.
"Dorothy, I must speak. I can no
longer restrain my yearning soul—yearn
ing, nay, clamoring, for you. . . . Re
flected glories of our forebears' souls
draw our souls together ... it is fate
... A corporal pledge I ask; declare
our mystic union with your hands."
Although Reggie's little speech reveals
less of his character than does that of
Kelly or Swami, several allusions evi
dence his attitude. Reggie is played by
Albert Gregersen.
"My dearest Dorothy, I have some
thing to say to you about myself. I feel
ridiculously proud at this moment, you
know. Er . . . from the day the original
Van Dorren arrived in New Amsterdam
our family has held a high position in
every respect. It must continue, Dor
othy. . .
The sinipleness of the Doctor, played
by Murray Ward, saturates his rehearsal
of the proposal. The speech fails, how
ever, to suggest his good-natured evasive
ness.
"Attraction is a law of science, Dor
othy, that is universal. I am attracted
to you as oxygen is to haemoglobin. The
vestibulospinal fibers of the anterolateral
funiculus respond no more readily to
stimulus than I do to one glance of your
eyes. . . . Dorothy, I love you. ... I
want you to marry me."
But the young physician, the success
ful athlete, the mystic crystal gazer, the
distinguished blue-blood must all step
aside for the clever young bond sales
man—the recent econ graduate, perhaps.
