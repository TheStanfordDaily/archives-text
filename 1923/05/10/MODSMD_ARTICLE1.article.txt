# SPIRITED REVIEW OF "FORE" OFFERS REAL ALLUREMENT
## Chinese Youngster Assists Choruses to Work Up Enthusiasm 
### Al Charles, '25 
Titillated by the playfulness and spon
taneous imitations of Gene Trago's "Lit
tle Brother Robert," eight-year-old Chi
nese second-boy of Theta Delta Chi, and
latest addition to the cast, the choruses
of "Fore" cut loose last night with a
rare burst of brilliant foolishness which
lasted from the finale of the first act to
the breaking up of the dress rehearsal
at 12 o'clock.

This same spirit of exuberance and
complete abandon flashed out for a few
minutes at the rehearsal last Monday
night. If the choruses and cast appear
on the stage Saturday night with the
same amusing and involuntary enthusi
asm, "Fore," even though the scenes
should collapse, the actors drop half
their lines, will keep the audience fasci
nated from "All Teed Up" to the finale
of the last act. The former is likely,
if the effect of "Little Brother Robert"
doesn't wear off; the latter is impossible,
as the play was reviewed last night with
out any serious blow-ups, hitches, or
promptings.

"Little Brother Robert," together with
the choruses' new flashy costumes of
bright batik, also seemed to have effect
upon several principals, Esther Flowers,
who carries the feminine lead, added a
great deal of charm and joyousness to
"Dorothy" last night. She has magnetic
facial expressions, a clear voice that
carries well in the Assembly hall, and
with the enthusiasm of last night, "Dor
othy" was a characterization of unusual
allurement. Miss blowers dances very
well. Several numbers with Gene Trago,
which have been devised by Miss Mar
garet McGovern, and are steps which
have no amateur stamp or likenesses, are
executed with very skilful talent.

Gene Trago keeps his lead among the
men of the cast in both dancing and
singing. A light touch of the pathetic
mingles with Trago's "matinee-idol"
style. Although the Chicago Grand
Opera is not apt to offer him $50,000 to
join their company, Trago has the real
musical comedy attitude both in his act
ing and in the hesitant, effective delivery
of his songs; his absence would change
the whole character of the show, and in
cidentally slow up the action. Which
leads to the question, "What will be the
song hit of the opera?"

Producers and the cast will be disap
pointed if there is one outstanding song
hit in the show—as was the case (Susie)
in "Knightie Knight." There should be
three or four real hits, for the music
seems comparable to the best extracted
from all the musical reviews this college
year. Most captivating, perhaps, is "I
Got a Feeling," sung by Gene Trago in
the second act. The piece works into
the plot very aptly. The contagious
quality of the air and its conformity
with Trago's most effective style would

probably make it the most stirring of all
the musical numbers if it were a chorus
number. Unfortunately the melody dies
away after a repetition or two without
leaving the indelible impression which
it must, were it supplemented by the vol
ume and contrasting delivery the chorus
would contribute.

asm, "Fore," even though the scenes
should collapse, the actors drop half
their lines, will keep the audience fasci
nated from "All Teed Up" to the finale
of the last act. The former is likely,
if the effect of "Little Brother Robert"
doesn't wear off; the latter is impossible,
as the play was reviewed last night with
out any serious blow-ups, hitches, or
promptings.

"Little Brother Robert," together with
the choruses' new flashy costumes of
bright batik, also seemed to have effect
upon several principals, Esther Flowers,
who carries the feminine lead, added a
great deal of charm and joyousness to
"Dorothy" last night. She has magnetic
facial expressions, a clear voice that
carries well in the Assembly hall, and
with the enthusiasm of last night, "Dor
othy" was a characterization of unusual
allurement. Miss blowers dances very
well. Several numbers with Gene Trago,
which have been devised by Miss Mar
garet McGovern, and are steps which
have no amateur stamp or likenesses, are
executed with very skilful talent.

Gene Trago keeps his lead among the
men of the cast in both dancing and
singing. A light touch of the pathetic
mingles with Trago's "matinee-idol"
style. Although the Chicago Grand
Opera is not apt to offer him $50,000 to
join their company, Trago has the real
musical comedy attitude both in his act
ing and in the hesitant, effective delivery
of his songs; his absence would change
the whole character of the show, and in
cidentally slow up the action. Which
leads to the question, "What will be the
song hit of the opera?"

Producers and the cast will be disap
pointed if there is one outstanding song
hit in the show—as was the case (Susie)
in "Knightie Knight." There should be
three or four real hits, for the music
seems comparable to the best extracted
from all the musical reviews this college
year. Most captivating, perhaps, is "I
Got a Feeling," sung by Gene Trago in
the second act. The piece works into
the plot very aptly. The contagious
quality of the air and its conformity
with Trago's most effective style would

probably make it the most stirring of all
the musical numbers if it were a chorus
number. Unfortunately the melody dies
away after a repetition or two without
leaving the indelible impression which
it must, were it supplemented by the vol
ume and contrasting delivery the chorus
would contribute.
Titillated by the playfulness and spon
taneous imitations of Gene Trago's "Lit
tle Brother Robert," eight-year-old Chi
nese second-boy of Theta Delta Chi, and
latest addition to the cast, the choruses
of "Fore" cut loose last night with a
rare burst of brilliant foolishness which
lasted from the finale of the first act to
the breaking up of the dress rehearsal
at 12 o'clock.

This same spirit of exuberance and
complete abandon flashed out for a few
minutes at the rehearsal last Monday
night. If the choruses and cast appear
on the stage Saturday night with the
same amusing and involuntary enthusi
asm, "Fore," even though the scenes
should collapse, the actors drop half
their lines, will keep the audience fasci
nated from "All Teed Up" to the finale
