house from 4 to 5:30. The informal
dance will be the last in the quartet of
dances, given Junior Week and although

Owing to the deluge of sorrow which
swept the campus at the announcement
that the old boathouse foundations were
not equal to the strain of an afternoon's
frolic, Roble Club decided to come to the
rescue and donate her floor. Although
Roble's foundations have not been tested
recently, it is believed that they are
fairly substantial and will prove equal to
the strain if all dancers make an effort
to step lightly.
