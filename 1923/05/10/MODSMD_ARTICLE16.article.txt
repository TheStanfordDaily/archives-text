# JUNIOR WEEK TO OPEN TONIGHT
## Concert, Canoe Flotilla and Flame Dives Make Up Evening's Program 
### 
Lake sports on Lagunita will mark the formal opening of Junior Week
tonight.
The queeners and roughs will assemble on the lake front at 7:30 for the
festivities and the Juniors will follow a few minutes later after the conclusion
of the 1924 Corduroy Ball. Sittings will be free and all flood, spot, and search
lights will be extinguished at 10 p. m. The program will be ended shortly
before that hour but the spectators may provide their own further entertain
ment if they so desire.
A song and dance act originated and arranged by Sam Mendenhall for the
occasion ha sbeen called off at the last moment due to the lack of facilities
for practice. The dress rehearsal set for last night could not be given since

'the electric light lines extension from
the county road to the handstand and
hoathouse had not heen completed hy
that time. The lights will be ready for
use tonight and will not interfere with
the other numbers on the program.
A rush order was sent in for fire
works late last night when campus
opinion forced the committee members
to decide to make an effort to secure
the usual brilliancy for the evening's
entertainment. This additional feature
of the program will come after the
other numbers and will form the grand
finale provided they can be obtained.
The opening event will be a band
concert by the University Band to be
given from the bandstand starting at.
7:30. Following that will be a vocal
selection by Martin Andrea with a
banjo accompaniment. At 8:15 an ex
hibition of fancy diving will take place
from the Men's Boathouse, the soloist
giving his selection from the same
place. A1 White, national fancy diving
champion, and Don Sneddon will be
the performers. The act will end in a
brilliant flame dive by Don Sneddon.
Promptly at 8:30 the canoe flotilla
of twenty-two floats will sail past the
Men's Boathouse from the Lagoon and
proceed in front of the Women's
Boathouse where the procession will
turn and go back to the Men's Boat
house. The six best canoes will pass
in review a second time and the win
ning floats for the mens' and women's
licing groups will be selected. The
judges' stand will be at the Women's
Boathouse with Professor and Mrs. P.
E. Martin, Professor and Mrs. Payson
J. Treat, and two others yet to be
named, acting as judges. Flood lights
will illuminate the scene and spot.
