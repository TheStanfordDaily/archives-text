# PARTNERS AT PROM SECURED BY MEANS OF LETTERED CARDS
## Idea Conceived to Aid in Exchange of Dances 
### 
Lettered cards reading from A to Z,
fixed upon booths arranged all around
the Pavilion, will be used at the Prom
tomorrow night as a convenience in
locating partners. This plan will avoid
confusion or delay in dancing which
would otherwise result because of the
unusually large number attending the
dance, according to 'Nip" McHose,
Prom chairman.
Those whose names are lower in
the alphabet than their partners meet
at the booth with the letter their part
ner's surname begins with. For exam
ple, Smith would meet Jones at the
booth marked J, or White would meet
Brown at the booth marked B.
