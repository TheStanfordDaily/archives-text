# ANOTHER NATIONAL VICTORY
## 
### 
"When Chappie will be President,
And the Hammer will hold sway."
That "damn fine day" which the Chappies sing
about when they get together has arrived—and
Stanford lias brought recognition throughout the
nation in another line of endeavor.
There may be those who do not consider winning
the Judge National College Wits Contest a very
significant victory. Most of us, however, are ready
to agree with Mark Twain when he says that the
world is safe with men who know how and when to
laugh, or words to that effect. How much more
enviable it is then to be able to make others laugh.
When members of Hammer and Coffin set about
the work of going after the Judge trophy several
weeks ago, they were commended and the remark
made that a sense of humor was the true measure
of intelligence. Now that they have been so satis
factorily awarded, the Daily Palo Alto, with the
rest of the campus, calls to the "Old Boy" as he
sticks his head out of the office window upstairs, a
hearty and sincere "Congratulations."
"When Chappie will be President,
And the Hammer will hold sway."
