If some inquisitive person should snoop about the
campus peering into student notebooks, he would
find there an interesting - index to character.
Among the rarest are those whose pages are per
fectly ordered, with meticulous lecture notes, aug
mented by reading quotations. But those which in
trigue the interest have odd letters and loose papers
straggling out at various angles. Inside the cover
there will probably be a few odd numbers, mysteri
ous, diametrical figures, a few properly-shaded
Greek letters, and perhaps the owner's initials at
tempted in various styles and combinations. The
artistically inclined reveal themselves by portraits
in different degrees of accuracy of their professors
or comrades. Then there is the spasmodic note
taker who betrays a lapse into slumber by the trail
ing off into infinity of a sentence which had a logi
cal beginning. As so often occurs in personalities,
the book which is the most interesting is the one
which most flagrantly violates the morally correct.
