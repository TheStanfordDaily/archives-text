Because campus days are learning days, they
offer one the opportunity to acquire what is known
as "good taste"—which phrase should mean, the
faculty of nice discrimination. The power of being
able to know or to sense what is good; the facility
for recognizing the best mingled with the worst —
this can be a valuable possession.
And, best of all, this discernment gives its pos
sessors the only fair start toward finding themselves.
Gradually they come to know sonic of their powers,
certain of their limitations; slowly they develop this
taste in the choosing of what is fitting for their own,
specific selves. In the selection of their clothes, their
diversions, companions, reading—and in the mould
ing of their philosophy—they approach the real ser
vice to themselves. —C. N. H.
