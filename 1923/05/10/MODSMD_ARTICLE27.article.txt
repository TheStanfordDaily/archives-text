Her hair is like gold*.
Her eyes are so blue,
There aren't many girls
As pretty as Lou.

Her lips are so red,
Her smile is so bright;
Oh, Lou, is indeed
Quite a wonderful sight.
But she's just like a story,
She's just like a dream.

I took my girl
To the Masque Ball
Last Saturday
And while we
Were dancing I
Heard something
Ripping.
And she said it was ;
That dress §he had
Just bought.
And I stopped long
Enough to remark
That the flimsy thing
Looked tearable when
I first saw it
And she got mad
And demanded
A taxi to go
Home right away.
But not in a
Taxi, darn the
English Language
Anyway.

Shooting the chute.
Setting a heart on fire.
Running over a new song.
Murdering the English Language.

We tried to write a little spring ballad but hanged if

"You pulled a good one," yelled the man when the
