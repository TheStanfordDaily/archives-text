# And So At Length

Rage sits enthroned on the countenance of McGoozle
after his twelfth beer; his eyes are red; his mouth has
fallen into the habit of remaining open for long inter
vals; his brow is wet with the honest sweat of convic
tion. Across the table sits Mundle, perpetually calm,
beerily calm, approaching his thirteenth beer with the
cheerful good humor of the man to whom a thirteenth
is as the first: a thing of no consequence.
McGoozle and Mundle are exchanging confidences on
the Bill. The issue is past: the House has refused to
listen; so bars are down, and fighters have become
friends. However McGoozle still insists: upon what he
has difficulty in remembering, but he insists. At the
next table sit Jack and his friend the reporter, and the
third shelters you and I and Oscar. Be quiet: let us be
sympathetic.
"Poor lads," murmurs McGoozle tearfully, "they little
know the demnible siege ahead of them. How different
I would make it for them. How cheerful I would have it.
But no: they are dealt with madly; they are treated like
brutes; their ideals are killed. How they suffer."
Mundle reflects, looking at the surface of his beer for
inspiration.
"Education is painful," he remarks at length. "Of
course it is; but what worthy thing is not. Science, man,
science is the thing. They must to reason."
McGoozle drowns his sorrow as gentlemen supposedly
should. Beers come and go. Bodleberry .Jr., serves them
with one eye on the door, skeptical as to the efficacy
of remaining with two such fighters. ,
Rage having given way to lacrimosity .frivolity now
enters upon the stage. McGoozle waves aloft his empty
mug.
"More beer," shouts he loudly. "I pledge to them: to
the idolators who work for pay: to the self-seekers who
work with one eye on the office: to the intelligentia,
damn them! Pledge me! Let us riot over the glories
of educating men. Behold we have made it a science:
Ve have made it smug with its own value: we have
made it a hateful thing clad in robes and holding a
sceptre. Pledge me! Let us drink to the day when men
shall not strive to make themselves learnedly neuter.
To the day when all women shall be ladies, and again
gentlemen shall salute them. Pledge me the delights of
the shadows of ignorance, whence comes the romance of
knowing but little and that little pure. We have mixed
our ideas. Morals and politics: religion and science:
society and the devil: they are mixed. I know them not.
Away with them. I crave something clean: something
pure: something near to God."
Mundle smiles a calm smile.
"I drink to you and your pledge," he replies, "because
I know you can do no harm."
McGoozle frowns.
"Let the average man go to college: let him go. He
will be taught the average things in the average way.
He will die the average way, and another will be born
to maintain the average number of average men. I
would make the average man over into a mover of the
world: into a moral force; but you others are too strong.
I cannot."
McGoozle's head falls. He sighs deeply.
"We must have our science," answers Mundle calmly,
obstinately.
McGoozle sleeps.
Let us tip-toe out: Oscar, you, and I. Bedlam has
descended. The mad are raving voluptuously in their
native haunts. Such places are not for us.
Jack and his friend the reporter have departed with
their copy: oblivious of the principals in their little
fisticuff drama: let us tip-toe out.
Mundle sips hip twentieth beer, calmly. McGoozle
sleeps a tearful sleep, tinged with the scent of beer.
Such places are not for us: let us tip-toe out.
DOWNING McGALLON.
