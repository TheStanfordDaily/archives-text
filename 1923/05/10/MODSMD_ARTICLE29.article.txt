# It Wasn't the Gold

"The lure of gold" is not the only rea
son for selling tickets.
The primary reason more Prom tickets
were sold is this: After the original 350
had been sold—the same number as last
year—over a hundred and fifty more ap
plications were received. "We're pay
ing a $1.25 a quarter for that pavilion"
was the argument advanced, "and here
we are being denied the use of it just to
please those who were lucky enough to
have the money to buy ahead of time."
What would the writer of yesterday's
editorial have done with such a plea-
Discarded it, no doubt, to save his toes
from being trampled on perhaps during
the evening.
The class of '24 feels differently about
it. Money is hardly ever unwelcome, but
the "lure of gold" (as the movie sub
titles always have it) was not the activat
ing motive in this case.
Was the student body as a whole really
displeased over this action of the junior
class- We doubt it.
