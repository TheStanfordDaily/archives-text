# Euphronia And Sinclair

### 
Editor of D. P. A.:
I have been much interested in your
editorial of Monday last in regard to
the Euphronia-Forum meeting for the
discussion of the "Goose-Step."
In fairness, 1 think it ought to be said
that the spirit of the meeting was scarcely
expressed in the words "Upton Sinclair
was entirely justified in his charges
against American colleges as set forth in
the "Goose-Step." The resolution passed
at the meeting was for the purpose of
registering our feeling, and was not re
garded by us as conclusive. We felt that
in the main Sinclair was right, however
much we objected to his style or to some
of the details of his work.
The reporter who covered the meeting
referred in his story to Stanford's pro
fessors having been dismissed for opin
ions, and your editorial expressed doubt.
The increduloqs are referred to the In
ternational Year Book for 1900, page
911.
It would be interesting to know the
basis on which objection to the publica
tion of our decision was made. My con
tention is that, as Wendall Pihllips said,
"If anything cannot stand the truth let
it crack;" and if, on the other hand, the
allegations are not true, the way to prove
them false, and the only way, is by free
discussion. That is the meaning of "The
Wind of Freedom Blows."
