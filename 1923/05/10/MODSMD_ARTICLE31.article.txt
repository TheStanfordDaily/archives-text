UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA—
"Undue publicity" for candidates in
student elections will be interrupted
to involve stunt advertising as well as
published stories containing the names
of candidates, according to a resolu
tion drawn up by the student council
special committee here. Disqualifica

violation. The constitution provides
against all forms of publicity as well
as campaigning that involves the use
of money.
