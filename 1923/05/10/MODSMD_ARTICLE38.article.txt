# BROWN DERBY AWARDED TO CAPTAIN OF FOOTBALL TEAM
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA â€”
The brown derby was awarded by elec
tion to the captain of the 1922 football
team at the recent Gridiron banquet.
The purpose in awarding the derby is
to give it to a man who has been the
brunt of much criticism and has stood
up under the fire. The custom is an
annual feature of the Gridiron dinner
and was started two years ago.
