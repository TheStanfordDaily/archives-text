### Henry Mack, '24 
"The quantity of humor is not strained,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven."
After three years of hard work, Chaparral, comic magazine, at last heads
the list of ,College Comics. According to a letter received by Northcutt (Mike)
Ely this morning, Judge has awarded the silver loving cup, representing first
place in their annual College Wit's Contest, to Chaparral, and also a smaller
cup for the best literary contribution to Ely, who is editor of the Chaparral.
The cup has been in competition four times. In 1920 it was won by
Columbia Jester, in 1921 it was won by Cornell, and again in 1922. In that
year, Chaparral took a second place, being nosed out by Cornell by some 40
points. The cup will be the permanent property of the comic that wins it
for three times.

In an interview this morning, Ely<
said: "It was no more than we ex
pected. In fact, we didn't expect half
that much. The awarding of this cup
to Hammer and Coffin reminds me of
that old saying, 'If you can't stand the
strain, crack.' Probably Judge knows
of It.
"Critics of campus-wide fame have
always been rather careless of Chap
arral's reputation. That reminds me
of the old saying, 'Profits without
honor in their own country.' Only on
most occasions where Chappy has
bowed before the public, it has been
'Honor without profits.' However, we
are very well pleased with the results."

cutt Ely, '24; C. A. Young, '24; Fred
Fisher, '24; Carl Shoup, '24; Henry

The letter from the editor of Judge
follows:
Dear Mr. Ely:
We are delighted to announce to you
that the Chaparral boys have at last
won Judge's College Wit's cup, after
brave efforts in other years. The cup
will, in due time, be sent to you after
the necessary engraving upon it, and
we are sure that you will be delighted
at your victory.
I am also happy to inform you that
you, personally, won the literary cup
for your very amusing story, "Sir
Gawaine and the Athletic Ogre." That
cup we have not yet purchased, but in
due time you will receive it suitably
engraved.
Very truly yours,
J. A. WALDRON,
College Wits Editor.
"The quantity of humor is not strained,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven."
After three years of hard work, Chaparral, comic magazine, at last heads
the list of ,College Comics. According to a letter received by Northcutt (Mike)
Ely this morning, Judge has awarded the silver loving cup, representing first
place in their annual College Wit's Contest, to Chaparral, and also a smaller
cup for the best literary contribution to Ely, who is editor of the Chaparral.
The cup has been in competition four times. In 1920 it was won by
Columbia Jester, in 1921 it was won by Cornell, and again in 1922. In that
year, Chaparral took a second place, being nosed out by Cornell by some 40
points. The cup will be the permanent property of the comic that wins it
for three times.

In an interview this morning, Ely<
said: "It was no more than we ex
pected. In fact, we didn't expect half
that much. The awarding of this cup
to Hammer and Coffin reminds me of
that old saying, 'If you can't stand the
strain, crack.' Probably Judge knows
of It.
"Critics of campus-wide fame have
always been rather careless of Chap
arral's reputation. That reminds me
of the old saying, 'Profits without
honor in their own country.' Only on
most occasions where Chappy has
bowed before the public, it has been
'Honor without profits.' However, we
are very well pleased with the results."
The Stanford Chappies are: North
cutt Ely, '24; C. A. Young, '24; Fred
Fisher, '24; Carl Shoup, '24; Henry
Mack, '24; George Thompson, '22; Ed
Wells, '14; Grinny Cowing, '22; Harry
Borba, '22; Tommy Green, '22; Dave
Tuthill, '23; Jim Clark, '23; Ted Van
Deusen, '24; Tom Irwin, '23; Dick
