# NESTORIA SOCIETY TO CHOOSE MEN FOR ST. IGNATIUS DEBATE
## 
### 
Six men will be chosen to represent
Nestoria in a debate with St. Ignatius at
the tryouts to be held in Room 12 of
the Law Building tonight. The subject
for debate at the tryouts is, "Resolved:
That the United States should enter the
world court."
The debate with St. Ignatius will be
a dual affair and three man teams will
be used. For the last two years the de
bates have been a tie, each team winning
one of the two contests. This year Nes
toria has some unusually good debaters
and has hopes of winning both contests
and the championship of the last three
years. Speeches for the tryouts should
be five minutes in length with a three
minute rebuttal.
A short business meeting will be held
after the tryouts and plans for the ban
quet will be discussed.
