# ALPHA DELTA PHI, EL CUADRO TEAMS WIN LEAGUE TITLES
## Sigma Nu Tied With Kappa Sigma in Group One 
### 
El Cuadro won the title in league 2
yesterday by defeating Encina second by
a 15-4 score and Alpha Delta Phi copped
the league four honors by snowing Delta
Chi under a 12-5 score. Sigma Nu de
feated Sequoia second 4-0 in one of the
best exhibitions of baseball seen during
the series. This victory places Sigma Nu
and Kappa Sigma in a tie for the lead in
league one. The teams will meet some
time next week to settle the winner of
the pennant. Zeta Psi defeated Phi
Kappa Psi 14-4 in an indecisive league 2
game, while Encina first forfeited to
Alpha Sigma Phi in the same league.
El Cuadro had an easy time with En
cina second. The first man up for El
Cuadro, Seymour, knocked out a home
run and then the next two men were put
out. The fourth man up, Anderson,
knocked out another circuit clout, making
two four base hits in one inning. Eggle
ston, Bissell, and Robinson also counted
for home runs for El Cuadro during the
game.
Robinson twirled for the winners. He
had good support at all times, his team
mates making one double play to help
him out of a hole, and struckout eight
men. He held the Encina men scoreless
for the first three innings and then eased
up a bit when his teafti had piled up a
substantial lead. Johnson pitched for En
cina, but was playing with a seven man
team.
After allowing Delta Chi to take the
lead in the first inning the Alpha Delts
came back strong and soon had a safe
lead on their opponents. Delta Chi had
made three in the first and seemed on the
way to victory when Loomis, the Alpha
Delt pitcher got going, and after that
things weren't so bright for Delta Chi.
Reticker pitched for the losers.
Pollard did the best hitting of the day
getting two three baggers. Jannsen and
also did well with the club. For
Delta Chi Hay, and Conrad did well.
Dwight started in the box for Sigma
Nu. He held Sequoia scoreless for two
innings but when he began to show signs
of weakening was removed and Jimmie
Aydelott took his place. The last year's
freshman moundsman had the game in
the palm of his hand from then on and
allowed only one hit in the next five in
nings. Not content with holding Sequoia
to one hit he also won his own game by
driving out a double which scored two
men. Quinn also hit well making two
hits out of three trips to the plate.
The Zetes took the lead against the
Phi Pais in the first inning and gradually
increased it during the remainder of the
game. The Phi Psi team was without
four regulars and the substitutes were
unable to field, with the result that, al
though Bumbaugh pitched a good brand
of ball he could not keep the Zete runs
down because of poor support.
Smith pitched for the winners. He
struck out a good per cent of the batters
who faced him and those who were able
to hit the ball out could scarcely get to
first because of the excellent fielding done
by the Zetes. Foster and Cravens were
the best hitters of the game. Foster drove
out a home run and Cravens got a run
every time he got to bat.
Games for today are: Phi Delta Theta
and Delta Tau Delta, Alpha Kappa
Lambda and Theta Xi, El Toro and
Theta Delta Chi, and Japanese Club and
Sequoia Second.
