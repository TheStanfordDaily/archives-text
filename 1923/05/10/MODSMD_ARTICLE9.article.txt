## 
### 
J. C. Cebrian has sent twenty-one vol
umes of Spanish books as a gift to the
Library from Madrid, Spain, where he
is at present. The shipment left Madrid
on March 27. It contains two volumes
of folklore that are of special interest
besides a historical dictionary of Catil
lian philology, a "Parnosa Espanol" in
seven volumes, and other leather-bound
volumes and pamphlets.
Cebrian is a resident of San Francisco
and a traveler. He visits Spain nearly
every year and gives Spanish books to
the University of California, the Public
Library of San Francisco, and usually
about fifty volumes a year to Stanford,
for the purpose of stimulating interest in
Spain and the Spanish language.
