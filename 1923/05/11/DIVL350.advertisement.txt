at Your Own Price
Travel costs to Europe have been lowered
by our cabin fleet of 14 delightful steam
ers to such an extent that you can cross
for what you would spend at an American
summer resort.
Passage money as low as $115 entitles you
to the best the ship affords in food and
service, full enjoyment of all her spacious
decks and attractive public rooms—all the
pleasures of summer days at sea and care
free nights.
The thousands who have been lured away
by the fascinations of unknown peoples
and storied places —- professional people,
students, men and women of affairs —you
will meet them on our cabin steamers.
Write today for our booklet—"Your Trip
to Europe"—and detailed information.
