# JUNIOR OPERA TO CULMINATE BRILLIANT WEEK OF FESTIVITIES TOMORROW IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Superior Qualities in Chorus Work of "Fore" Are Well Depicted in 1924 Musical Production 
### Allan Charles, ’25 
When the curtain draws apart at 8:15 tomorrow night, revealing "Peg"
McGovern's dazzling, flashily adorned choruses in the glare of bewildering,
brilliant footlights, the old Assembly hall "Spot" will grumble a moment,
swing fleetingly to the center of the stage, and wearily commence to point
out the merits and flaws of another Stanford musical review.
If the Old Spotlight could but penetrate the mystic Swami's crystal he could
perhaps disclose to the restless, keyed-up cast of "Fore" blemishes which will
mar the night, success which will make it. If he could but cast his light
so that we could understand him, we should learn that on bewitching May
nights, when enthusiam runs high over rapidly-succeeding events of pleasure,
musical shows are predestined to succeed; that only in the fall and winter

months when human spirits are lower,,
is the campus musical review likely to
struggle with failure.
Choruses Are Luring
Probably never has Old Spotlight,
in all his years of service under the
Cardinal, seen such a joyous, alluring
chorus as the cluster of beauties which
will appear in "Gazing," "Fore," and
"My Little Queen of Gasoline;" but
perhaps he would prefer to invoke
images of some night years ago when
costumes were longer and colors
softer. The spirit of the choruses, the
surpassing skill and quality of the
steps, are due to the knowledge and
personality of Miss Margaret McGov
ern.
Old Spotlight will blink at several
numbers he never cast light on be
fore, tomorrow night. After an encore
or two of "All Teed Up," the stirring
opening number, Spotlight will pass on
from one corner of the stage to an
other, from number to number, until
every secret of the opera is revealed.
Leads Well Cast
Spotlight will have the fortune to
rest his gaze often during the evening
on Dorothy, played by Esther Flowers,
and Bill, carried by Gene Trago. The
leads work well together. In the sec
ond act, when only the blue, soft light
of the stars seeps through tall trees
and finds its way to Dorothy and Bill,
Spotlight will substitute for the man
in the moon and cast a glimmering
halo to follow one of the most impres
sive dances of the opera, accompanied
by the stirring strains of "I Got a
Feeling."
In the second and third acts, Old
Spotlight will have many occasions to
