# JUNIOR OPERA TO CULMINATE BRILLIANT WEEK OF FESTIVITIES TOMORROW IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Superior Qualities in Chorus Work of "Fore" Are Well Depicted in 1924 Musical Production 
### Allan Charles, ’25 
When the curtain draws apart at 8:15 tomorrow night, revealing "Peg"
McGovern's dazzling, flashily adorned choruses in the glare of bewildering,
brilliant footlights, the old Assembly hall "Spot" will grumble a moment,
swing fleetingly to the center of the stage, and wearily commence to point
out the merits and flaws of another Stanford musical review.
If the Old Spotlight could but penetrate the mystic Swami's crystal he could
perhaps disclose to the restless, keyed-up cast of "Fore" blemishes which will
mar the night, success which will make it. If he could but cast his light
so that we could understand him, we should learn that on bewitching May
nights, when enthusiam runs high over rapidly-succeeding events of pleasure,
musical shows are predestined to succeed; that only in the fall and winter

months when human spirits are lower,,
is the campus musical review likely to
struggle with failure.
Choruses Are Luring
Probably never has Old Spotlight,
in all his years of service under the
Cardinal, seen such a joyous, alluring
chorus as the cluster of beauties which
will appear in "Gazing," "Fore," and
"My Little Queen of Gasoline;" but
perhaps he would prefer to invoke
images of some night years ago when
costumes were longer and colors
softer. The spirit of the choruses, the
surpassing skill and quality of the
steps, are due to the knowledge and
personality of Miss Margaret McGov
ern.
Old Spotlight will blink at several
numbers he never cast light on be
fore, tomorrow night. After an encore
or two of "All Teed Up," the stirring
opening number, Spotlight will pass on
from one corner of the stage to an
other, from number to number, until
every secret of the opera is revealed.
Leads Well Cast
Spotlight will have the fortune to
rest his gaze often during the evening
on Dorothy, played by Esther Flowers,
and Bill, carried by Gene Trago. The
leads work well together. In the sec
ond act, when only the blue, soft light
of the stars seeps through tall trees
and finds its way to Dorothy and Bill,
Spotlight will substitute for the man
in the moon and cast a glimmering
halo to follow one of the most impres
sive dances of the opera, accompanied
by the stirring strains of "I Got a
Feeling."
In the second and third acts, Old
Spotlight will have many occasions to
i wink the rays of his penetrating eye.
Ted Van Deusen, Dorothy Dahler, Bill
Lucas, and Gardner Lippincott have
; the special task of making the old light
; play up. And on the chest of Dick Fa
| ville, as Art Kelly, the athlete, the rays
I will rest uncertain, unable to under
j stand; but Faville's sense of humor
j should stir a gentle rippling from the
dark hall below. A gleam or two will
probably catch the hopeful face of
"ooohing" Anne, for it won't have to
stray far from Art Kelly's manly form.
Rest of Cast Introduced
As there is no need of Spotlight dur
ing a golf tournament, the "old man"
may catch a few moments' sleep while
the rest of the cast is introduced. Fol
lowing Cobb, champion golfer, played
by Irving Anschutz, the putters —Mrs.
Stuyvesant (Elizabeth Noyes, and
Catherine (Marjorie Anderson), the
butler (Everett Brown), and "Little
Brother Robert" (Hasliimura Pogo)
enter. And of course there is always
the Doctor, played by Murray Ward;
Reggie, carried by Albert Gregersen,
and Swami, played by Robert Carr.
Then Spotlight grumbles on and
casts a blue hue upon Dave Mannoccir,
the unfortunate house manager. The
sincere expression of self-sorrow on
Mannoccir's face, the spirit with which
he plays to the audience, gets into the
air of the Assembly Hall.
Swami Well Portrayed
In the next number. Spotlight cau
tiously extends a sparkle of delicate,
mystic light, which pierces through
the crystal of Swami. the sedate,
thoughtful gazer of India. Robert Carr
has the power to fascinate and carry
back and forth the eyes of the audi
ence as well as the rays of the "old
man."
And now. on through the second
and third acts, Spotlight will go, il
luminating here a new set of chorus
costumes, there some bright evening
gowns, white flannel trousers, a new
setting, a burlesque dance. Theh
around eleven o'clock, when he has
reflected glory on the last encore of
the ensemble, "Fore," when the loud
clattering applause has died to a
lighter hum of conversation, the old
spotlight will flicker out, stored with
memories of a golf show called "Fore,"
to sleep until excited members of an
other Stanford play demand his ser
vice again.
Probably some time in the years
ahead, some cold, melancholy evening
when the show has failed, "old man"
Spotlight will muse on an invigorat
ing May evening, a happy crowd, long
ago, with the thought—"Well, that
WAS a show!"
Credit is due Fred Patton, '24, who was
responsible for getting the lights con
nected to the lake. He took the place of
Ernest Greppin, who withdrew.

in all his years of service under the
Cardinal, seen such a joyous, alluring
chorus as the cluster of beauties which
will appear in "Gazing," "Fore," and
"My Little Queen of Gasoline;" but
perhaps he would prefer to invoke
images of some night years ago when
costumes were longer and colors
softer. The spirit of the choruses, the
surpassing skill and quality of the
steps, are due to the knowledge and
personality of Miss Margaret McGov
ern.
Old Spotlight will blink at several
numbers he never cast light on be
fore, tomorrow night. After an encore
or two of "All Teed Up," the stirring
opening number, Spotlight will pass on
from one corner of the stage to an
other, from number to number, until
every secret of the opera is revealed.
Leads Well Cast
Spotlight will have the fortune to
rest his gaze often during the evening
on Dorothy, played by Esther Flowers,
and Bill, carried by Gene Trago. The
leads work well together. In the sec
ond act, when only the blue, soft light
of the stars seeps through tall trees
and finds its way to Dorothy and Bill,
Spotlight will substitute for the man
in the moon and cast a glimmering
halo to follow one of the most impres
sive dances of the opera, accompanied
by the stirring strains of "I Got a
Feeling."
In the second and third acts, Old
Spotlight will have many occasions to
i wink the rays of his penetrating eye.
Ted Van Deusen, Dorothy Dahler, Bill
Lucas, and Gardner Lippincott have
; the special task of making the old light
; play up. And on the chest of Dick Fa
| ville, as Art Kelly, the athlete, the rays
I will rest uncertain, unable to under
j stand; but Faville's sense of humor
j should stir a gentle rippling from the
dark hall below. A gleam or two will
probably catch the hopeful face of
"ooohing" Anne, for it won't have to
stray far from Art Kelly's manly form.
Rest of Cast Introduced
As there is no need of Spotlight dur
ing a golf tournament, the "old man"
may catch a few moments' sleep while
the rest of the cast is introduced. Fol
lowing Cobb, champion golfer, played
by Irving Anschutz, the putters —Mrs.
Stuyvesant (Elizabeth Noyes, and
Catherine (Marjorie Anderson), the
butler (Everett Brown), and "Little
Brother Robert" (Hasliimura Pogo)
enter. And of course there is always
the Doctor, played by Murray Ward;
Reggie, carried by Albert Gregersen,
and Swami, played by Robert Carr.
Then Spotlight grumbles on and
casts a blue hue upon Dave Mannoccir,
the unfortunate house manager. The
sincere expression of self-sorrow on
Mannoccir's face, the spirit with which
he plays to the audience, gets into the
air of the Assembly Hall.
Swami Well Portrayed
In the next number. Spotlight cau
tiously extends a sparkle of delicate,
mystic light, which pierces through
the crystal of Swami. the sedate,
thoughtful gazer of India. Robert Carr
has the power to fascinate and carry
back and forth the eyes of the audi
ence as well as the rays of the "old
man."
And now. on through the second
and third acts, Spotlight will go, il
luminating here a new set of chorus
costumes, there some bright evening
gowns, white flannel trousers, a new
setting, a burlesque dance. Theh
around eleven o'clock, when he has
reflected glory on the last encore of
the ensemble, "Fore," when the loud
clattering applause has died to a
lighter hum of conversation, the old
spotlight will flicker out, stored with
memories of a golf show called "Fore,"
to sleep until excited members of an
other Stanford play demand his ser
vice again.
Probably some time in the years
ahead, some cold, melancholy evening
when the show has failed, "old man"
Spotlight will muse on an invigorat
ing May evening, a happy crowd, long
ago, with the thought—"Well, that
WAS a show!"
Credit is due Fred Patton, '24, who was
responsible for getting the lights con
nected to the lake. He took the place of
Ernest Greppin, who withdrew.
When the curtain draws apart at 8:15 tomorrow night, revealing "Peg"
McGovern's dazzling, flashily adorned choruses in the glare of bewildering,
brilliant footlights, the old Assembly hall "Spot" will grumble a moment,
swing fleetingly to the center of the stage, and wearily commence to point
out the merits and flaws of another Stanford musical review.
If the Old Spotlight could but penetrate the mystic Swami's crystal he could
perhaps disclose to the restless, keyed-up cast of "Fore" blemishes which will
mar the night, success which will make it. If he could but cast his light
so that we could understand him, we should learn that on bewitching May
nights, when enthusiam runs high over rapidly-succeeding events of pleasure,
musical shows are predestined to succeed; that only in the fall and winter

months when human spirits are lower,,
is the campus musical review likely to
struggle with failure.

Spotlight will substitute for the man
in the moon and cast a glimmering
halo to follow one of the most impres
sive dances of the opera, accompanied
by the stirring strains of "I Got a
Feeling."
In the second and third acts, Old
Spotlight will have many occasions to
i wink the rays of his penetrating eye.
Ted Van Deusen, Dorothy Dahler, Bill
Lucas, and Gardner Lippincott have
; the special task of making the old light
; play up. And on the chest of Dick Fa
| ville, as Art Kelly, the athlete, the rays
I will rest uncertain, unable to under
j stand; but Faville's sense of humor
j should stir a gentle rippling from the
dark hall below. A gleam or two will
probably catch the hopeful face of
"ooohing" Anne, for it won't have to
stray far from Art Kelly's manly form.
Rest of Cast Introduced
As there is no need of Spotlight dur
ing a golf tournament, the "old man"
may catch a few moments' sleep while
the rest of the cast is introduced. Fol
lowing Cobb, champion golfer, played
by Irving Anschutz, the putters —Mrs.
Stuyvesant (Elizabeth Noyes, and
Catherine (Marjorie Anderson), the
butler (Everett Brown), and "Little
Brother Robert" (Hasliimura Pogo)
enter. And of course there is always
the Doctor, played by Murray Ward;
Reggie, carried by Albert Gregersen,
and Swami, played by Robert Carr.
Then Spotlight grumbles on and
casts a blue hue upon Dave Mannoccir,
the unfortunate house manager. The
sincere expression of self-sorrow on
Mannoccir's face, the spirit with which
he plays to the audience, gets into the
air of the Assembly Hall.
Swami Well Portrayed
In the next number. Spotlight cau
tiously extends a sparkle of delicate,
mystic light, which pierces through
the crystal of Swami. the sedate,
thoughtful gazer of India. Robert Carr
has the power to fascinate and carry
back and forth the eyes of the audi
ence as well as the rays of the "old
man."
And now. on through the second
and third acts, Spotlight will go, il
luminating here a new set of chorus
costumes, there some bright evening
gowns, white flannel trousers, a new
setting, a burlesque dance. Theh
around eleven o'clock, when he has
reflected glory on the last encore of
the ensemble, "Fore," when the loud
clattering applause has died to a
lighter hum of conversation, the old
spotlight will flicker out, stored with
memories of a golf show called "Fore,"
to sleep until excited members of an
other Stanford play demand his ser
vice again.
Probably some time in the years
ahead, some cold, melancholy evening
when the show has failed, "old man"
Spotlight will muse on an invigorat
ing May evening, a happy crowd, long
ago, with the thought—"Well, that
WAS a show!"
Credit is due Fred Patton, '24, who was
responsible for getting the lights con
nected to the lake. He took the place of
Ernest Greppin, who withdrew.
When the curtain draws apart at 8:15 tomorrow night, revealing "Peg"
McGovern's dazzling, flashily adorned choruses in the glare of bewildering,
brilliant footlights, the old Assembly hall "Spot" will grumble a moment,
swing fleetingly to the center of the stage, and wearily commence to point
out the merits and flaws of another Stanford musical review.
If the Old Spotlight could but penetrate the mystic Swami's crystal he could
perhaps disclose to the restless, keyed-up cast of "Fore" blemishes which will
mar the night, success which will make it. If he could but cast his light
so that we could understand him, we should learn that on bewitching May
nights, when enthusiam runs high over rapidly-succeeding events of pleasure,
musical shows are predestined to succeed; that only in the fall and winter

months when human spirits are lower,,
is the campus musical review likely to
struggle with failure.
Choruses Are Luring
Probably never has Old Spotlight,
in all his years of service under the
Cardinal, seen such a joyous, alluring
chorus as the cluster of beauties which
will appear in "Gazing," "Fore," and
"My Little Queen of Gasoline;" but
perhaps he would prefer to invoke
images of some night years ago when
costumes were longer and colors
softer. The spirit of the choruses, the
surpassing skill and quality of the
steps, are due to the knowledge and
personality of Miss Margaret McGov
ern.
Old Spotlight will blink at several
numbers he never cast light on be
fore, tomorrow night. After an encore
or two of "All Teed Up," the stirring
opening number, Spotlight will pass on
from one corner of the stage to an
other, from number to number, until
every secret of the opera is revealed.
Leads Well Cast
Spotlight will have the fortune to
rest his gaze often during the evening
on Dorothy, played by Esther Flowers,
and Bill, carried by Gene Trago. The
leads work well together. In the sec
ond act, when only the blue, soft light
of the stars seeps through tall trees
and finds its way to Dorothy and Bill,
Spotlight will substitute for the man
in the moon and cast a glimmering
halo to follow one of the most impres
sive dances of the opera, accompanied
by the stirring strains of "I Got a
