# DELTA UPSILON TRACK MEN CHALLENGE LIVING GROUPS
## 
### 
Delta Upsilon's track team has is
sued a challenge to any living group
on the campus for an unlimited mile
relay. The D. U. sprinters are willing
to meet any four-man team, each man
running a quarter-mile, or any eight
man team, in which each man runs
220 yards. The D. U. unlimited team
will include Van Judah, Boles, Kem
nitzer, Richardson, and Falk.
Most of the houses worked out on
the track yesterday for the intramural
meet. The D. U.'s have announced
their intention of entering both the
track meet and the relay. This is the
only living group to formally enter
and so little can be said at this time
concerning the most powerful aggre

gations to compete.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics, urges all fraternities and
clubs to enter ten-men teams in each
of the six events. No matter how many
are entered, ten man can score points
in each event. The living group which
fails to enter ten men in all events
will not have much chance to win,
since it will lose points that might be
made had the ten entered, Davis says.
Men competing in the meet will not
have to attend gymnasium classes on
the days on which they participate.
Davis hoped that from 300 to 400 men
enter each. If this number is reached,
the directors of the meet feel that new
varsity material is certain to be de
veloped.
