# NEW FOOTBALL COURSE IS NO "PIPE" SAYS ANDY KERR
## 
### 
Football, Baseball, Swimmingâ€” all of
these are not only coached and played
at Stanford, but are also taught as
regular University courses. List to
what Andy Kerr has to say about his
one-unit football and basketball class
which meets twice a week in the gym
nasium!
"The course is primarily for those
who are interested in these sports and
would like to know more about them,
but it is also for those- who intend to
coach in preparatory schools and col
leges. Men who play football should
learn enough about it on the field un
less they are exceptionally dumb. Con
sequently, there are no varsity men in
the class who do not intend to coach."
It ie not a "pipe" course either, ac
cording to Coach Kerr. Several books
must bo read and reported upon dur
ing the quarter, and examinations are
given in both football and basketball
when the study of each of the sub

| jects is finished. The books on foot
; ball are written by such men as Cava
naugh, former Dartmouth coach;
Houghton, Harvard's coach, and
Zuppke of Illinois. One of the basket
ball texts is written by Meanwell of
Wisconsin.
"Journalists and others aspiring to
be "cub" sport reporters, make up a
large part of the class," says Andy.
"A writer must be acquainted with his
subject and that is what this course
aims to accomplish."
There are also discussion groups. If
j one were to listen in on some of the
I arguments between Art Wilcox, Coach
! Post and others, one might wonder
how football coaches ever decide on
anything relative to the great Ameri
can game of "batter and smash."
The course will be given again next
year and will be open to all, including
any women who wish to become better
informed.
