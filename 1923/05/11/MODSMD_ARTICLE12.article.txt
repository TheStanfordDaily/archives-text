Japanese maiden and Devil's crew, flotilla presentations of Alpha Phi and
Sigma Chi respectively, were awarded silver loving cups for the best floats
in the Canoe Flotilla which opened the Junior Week program on Lagunita
last night.
Don Snedden performed a beautiful flame dive just before the start of the
canoe parade. The fireworks promised by the committee in charge made a
successful conclusion to the evening's sport.
The lake sports program opened at 7:30 with a concert by the Stanford
Band on the bandstand, which was brilliantly lighted. At 8 o'clock, the
juniors and their partners arrived from the Corduroy Ball in the Women's

Clubhouse and increased the waiting
numbers by 200. The main program
started at 8:15 with several vocal se
lections by Martin Andrea, accompan
ied by a banjo. His voice carried well
with the aid of a megaphone.
A1 White gave some pretty exhibi
tions of fancy diving from the top of
the boathouse. His white form hurtling
through the darkness was spectacular.
And then came Don Snedden in his
flame dive. The crowd waited breath
lessly while the fuse was lighted
which would ignite the gasoline on his
woolen clothes. Just as it appeared
that the fuse had gone out, Snedden's
form burst into flames. He leaned far
out over the edge of the diving board,
gave a spring and the body of fire was
on its way. In a fraction of a second
the whole thing was over and the fire
out. Snedden calmly sv am to shore
with the crowd applauding and the
spotlights guiding his way.
Flotilla Is Attractive
The canoe flotilla was probably the
most attractive part of the program. The
whole parade was impressive. A stately
white swan, representing Sequoia, head
ed the proccssion. Next came the mid'
Victorian queen, placed on her pedestal
by Gamma Phi Beta. Phi Kappa Sigma
entered a racing boat covered with water
lilies and other flowers. The Delta Delta
Delta canoe represented the days of King
Tut, with pyramids and Egyptian cos
tumes. Alpha Sigma Phi's entry, an In
dian camp fire with red flames, was im
pressive.
After the parade had passed the judges'
stand at the women's boathouse, where
Professor and Mrs. Payson J. Treat,
Professor and Mrs. P. A. Martin, Dean
and Mrs. George Culver, and Comptroller
and Mrs. A. E. Roth were acting in the
judicial capacity, six floats were selected
to make a second appearance. Of the
three women's floats selected, the Alpha
Phi canoe took the prize with a little
Japanese girl sitting upright amid ana
