# P.A.A. CHAMPIONSHIPS AMONG JUNIOR SPORTS
## Lake Swim, Diving Contest For Women, Canoe Races, Are Other Events 
### Walt Campbell, ’26 
Junior lake sports will start off with
a hang tomorrow afternoon, with two
junior P. A. A. titles at stake in Encina
pool. The fancy diving and 220-yard
championships will be the bones of con
tention, and are scheduled to begin at
1:30.
Stanford is generally favored to retain
the two titles which Snedden and Woo
stcr won last year. However, the loss
of Langley in the 220 has greatly weak
ened the Cards' chances.
The fancy diving championship should
easily go to one of the three Stanford en
tries, Smith, King, and Gibbons. The
judges should have a difficult time in
picking the winner, since all three are
about on a par. Smith is credited with
an edge, but King sprang a surprise by
beating him in the meet against the Cali
fornia freshmen. Gibbons, also, must be
counted upon as a dangerous contender.
These men should not be hard pressed,
unless Cunningham, of Idora Club, de
cides to enter, in which case he must he
given an even break with the Stanford
divers.
Langley Out of 220
was doped to carry away the
laurels in the 220-yard swim, but cannot
compete owing to an injured ankle. Hi»
withdrawal leaves the outcome in doubi.
Among the most likely entries are Wright
and Hirschmann of Stanford, and Gill
son, Ross, and Gallagher of the Olympic
Club. Wright and Gillson seem about
the pick of the field, and should put up
a fight for first place. It is doubtful if
the time made last year by Wooster,
2:46.2, will be bettered. But both men*
are capable of about 2:50, which is fast
enough in the absence of Langley, a 2:45
man.
Lake Events Start at 2 p. m.
The events at, Lagunita will begin at
2 p. m., according to Charles Fletcher,
chairman of the Lake Sport commit
tee. The first event will be a 50-yard
free style race for women, with a per
petual trophy offered the winner.
The other events will follow this at
fifteen-minute intervals. At 2:15, the
canoe race will be run off. The courts
begins on the southwest side, and
finishes at the boathouse. From the
number of canoes entered, the race
should be a close and exciting one.
Merchandise prizes are offered the
winners.

Cross-Lake Swim Scheduled
The next, event has been made an
annual invitational cross-lake swim, by
permission of the A. A. U. The course
is about 500 yards long, with the 1
