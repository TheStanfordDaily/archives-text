# CRITICS
## 
### 
There has been a lot of criticism rampant on the
campus this year and there has been a lot of talk
about critics. A good deal of what Floyd Dell,
writing" in the May Bookman, says may apply locally
and to other than literary fields. If his observations
are true, the Daily, along with a considerable por
tion of the campus, cannot claim absolute immunity.
"If a book makes the critic angry, that is some
thing ; but if it merely bores him, why should he
trouble to tell us so ? A history of a critic's boredom
is itself a bore; and the critic who is bored by almost
everything in the world lacks the essential ingredient
of the critical facultyâ€”a sensitiveness so acute that
the critic can become excited over things which
other people are too dull to notice for themselves. A
habitual falling back upon the critic's own experi
ences-may or may not be a sign of esthetic boredom;
it all depends on whether the T thus placed in the
foreground is relevant to the literary topic nominally
under discussion. Every young newspaper man has
tried the trick of handing the city editor a story of
his failure to get an interview, instead of the inter
view. But no newspaper man has yet had the nerve
to hand in a story of how he preferred to sit in the
park and watch the pigeons rather than talk to the
man he was sent to interview. A good deal of 'bril
liant' 'young' 'criticism' is like that."
