# NEXT YEAR'S OFFICERS
## 
### 
It is characteristic of Stanford student body elec
tions that nobody very often gives them a thought
until the time is upon us to choose the officers for
another year. As a result, there is a scarcity of candi
dates and a last-minute rush to fill the ticket with
any available names.
There has been a frequently expressed feeling this
year that not all the offices are filled by men most
capable of representing the University. But these
tnen were elected on the Quad, and after they have
taken over their duties is a poor time to discuss their
qualifications.
For such offices as the Quad editorship, where a
year's work has proved that all the men entered
have a certain degree of ability, there is not such a
problem for the student voter. But for the offices in
which there is no required preliminary, a rather ex
tensive knowledge of the merits of the various candi
dates is necessary. The only way to acquire this
knowledge is to begin thinking about the election
early and looking around for the logical men to fill
the various offices.
Political factions are coming to play a smaller and
smaller part in campus elections. But somebody
must start the ball rolling, and if certain "poli
ticians" display enough initiative to put forth a
favorite's name, they are more to be commended
than the men who sit back quietly until the balloting
is over and then begin to air their grievances. There
is one way to prevent narrow interests from con
trolling the student body and that is for every man
and woman to take an active interest in the election.
If you arc the type that would prefer writing the
University's poems to making its laws, all right, but
you are hardly in a position to object to who the
law-makers are, or to what they do after you have
taken that attitude.
