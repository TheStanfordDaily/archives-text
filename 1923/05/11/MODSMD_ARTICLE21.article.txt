Susie: My dear, here comes Margaret with a dress
just like mine. Thank goodness everyone saw me before
she came in.
Sal: Yeh, it takes two people before you can get a
good contrast.
Susie: Who is she with?
Sal: Tinder Woodburn.
Susie: Huh, she's second choice. He asked me first.
Maude: When did he ask you?
Susie: Monday.
Maude: Hum. He asked me Sunday. She's third
choice.
Susie: Look at her flirt with my Dickie behind her
fan.
Maude: That woman certainly shakes a mean
feather.
Sal: My dear, she says that fan comes from Paris.
Susie: Probably from the City of Paris.
Maude: Here, here, let's have a little peace.
Susie: Take the whole thing. Oh, there goes the
music.

He knew that Jane was going to marry Dick before
Jane did. In fact he had been sure of it for some time.
He gave her wonderful clothes, taught her to make men
adore her, and did everything he could think of to make
things turn out well for her. Yet she didn't give a
whoop for him. No, he's the playwright; she's the lead
ing lady.

Dumb Book Agent, eyeing stout housewife critically:
"Surely, madaine, you are broad enough to see the value
of this choice volume!"

to my broadness!"

As one columnist to another, Cabbages wishes to bow
to the Chappy editor, and extend congratulations on the
new two-quart drinking—er, meant to say loving cup. If
the busy department of this sheet could have afforded a
two-color cover for the last month's edition of Cabbages,
we might have entered in the Wit's Contest ourselves.
But of course competition of that sort with Chappy
would hardly have been fair—to us.
* * *
We also wish to state that we think the idea of the
loving cup has been entirely lost. The very name indi
cates that it was originally awarded, not for mere wit,
but for being the best lover. In fact, history shows that
each county in ancient Greece had a loving cup for the
Intercounty Loving Contest. And if you had kept up
on your ancient history, you would remember that
Apollo, representing Venus County, won hands down
back in 901 B. C. We're all for reinstating the custom.
* * *
All we'd need to do to bring it back would be to give
a cup for it.
• * *
Imagine training for the affair.
Passing on to the next booth, ladies and gentlemen:
I was a rough at the Lake Sports,
Watching the passing parade;
Each little queen wore a costume
That was ninety degrees in the shade.
Many showed form on the high dive;
Regular mermaids they were—
Each shapely Annette came out dripping wet,
And I learned about swimmin' from her.
—LITTLE SCORPION.
* * *
Encina —Do you use Colgate's tooth paste?
Sequoia—No, I don't room with him any more.
* ♦ *
Homer Cayenne, '26, rises to remark that his idea of
a fresh-air fiend is the frosh who ventilates his dink for
spring wear.
\* * *
If you eat onions every night—
Then you can't kiss mamma at all.
* * *
She knew she ought to study, but she couldn't reslßt
going to the lake sports. Her history ex came tomorrow
—but surely the prof wouldn't want her to miss the
Corduroy Ball! Her average was low in French, but
she just had to see the Opera. And then there was the
Prom which she couldn't miss because of a silly old
Econ class.
So she flunked out.
• * *
Adelaide had at least five different men on the string
every week. She made the most of it, too. Adeliade was
a firm believer in the saying, "Make hay while the sun
shines." Besides, when one lost interest there was al
ways another son interested in Adelaide.
