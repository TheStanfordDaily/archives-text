# THE 						AWFUL TRUTH
## 
### 
Is Lucy Wariner guilty or merely in
discreet? This is the question in every
one's mind throughout Arthur Richman's
comedy, "The Awful Truth." The story
reflects modern society as it exists in the
homes of New York capitalists. There
is the usual lack of seriousness and
frankness that is exemplified in present
day life.
As Lucy Wariner, Ina Claire truly
lives up to the Chronicle's criticism of
her: "A fascinating siren to enclaim our
hearts and enchant eye and ear."
This young divorcee is planning to re
marry. Miss Claire carries her audi
ence through her struggle between her
desire for money and love. Typical of
American society the "almighty dollar"
plays a leading role. Should she marry
the robust, egotistical Westerner with a
bank roll as his one asset, or try to win
back the affections of her ex-husband,
whom she really loves?
The difference between East and West
are well drawn in the contrasting char
acters of the heroine's suitors. A note
of complexity and perplexity is intro
duced when Lucy realizes that an indis
creet action on her part has caused the
breaking up of her first home and is now
causing her fiance to doubt her virtue.
In an attempt to establish the fact
that she is one of "God's good women,"
Lucy asks her husband to testify. He
consents and for her happiness conceals
the real reason for their divorce. Dur
ing these testimonies, Lucy realizes that
her former husband is the man she
should marry and consequently breaks
her engagement to the Westerner.
Her next problem is to regain her hus
band's affections. In the end, the
rumored indiscretion is explained and
husband and wife start life anew.
The scathing sarcasm, dry humor,
comic situations and clever epigrams all
assist the excellent cast in winning its
audience. In fact, there is not a dry
moment from the time the curtain rises
until it falls. Taken as a whole, this
modern play of modern life is well worth
the evening.
The modern setting and modish cos
tumes also add life to the play. Although
"The Awful Truth" is far from being
a play of the Barrie type, it certainly
would prove of interest to any audience.

marry. Miss Claire carries her audi
ence through her struggle between her
desire for money and love. Typical of
American society the "almighty dollar"
plays a leading role. Should she marry
the robust, egotistical Westerner with a
bank roll as his one asset, or try to win
back the affections of her ex-husband,
whom she really loves?
The difference between East and West
are well drawn in the contrasting char
acters of the heroine's suitors. A note
of complexity and perplexity is intro
duced when Lucy realizes that an indis
creet action on her part has caused the
breaking up of her first home and is now
causing her fiance to doubt her virtue.
In an attempt to establish the fact
that she is one of "God's good women,"
Lucy asks her husband to testify. He
consents and for her happiness conceals
the real reason for their divorce. Dur
ing these testimonies, Lucy realizes that
her former husband is the man she
should marry and consequently breaks
her engagement to the Westerner.
Her next problem is to regain her hus
band's affections. In the end, the
rumored indiscretion is explained and
husband and wife start life anew.
The scathing sarcasm, dry humor,
comic situations and clever epigrams all
assist the excellent cast in winning its
audience. In fact, there is not a dry
moment from the time the curtain rises
until it falls. Taken as a whole, this
modern play of modern life is well worth
the evening.
The modern setting and modish cos
tumes also add life to the play. Although
"The Awful Truth" is far from being
a play of the Barrie type, it certainly
would prove of interest to any audience.
