# NESTORIA WILL NOT DEBATE ST. IGNATIUS
## 
### 
Nestoria's annual debate with St. Ig
natius will not be held this year. A let
ter received from the Catholic college
yesterday states that*the proposed date
conflicts with final examinations. As sev
eral Nestoria men had been working on
the question, "Resolved, That the United
States should enter the world court,"
and were ready to try out last night, it
was decided to hold the tryouts as sched
uled and have a society debate on this
subject two weeks later.
Will Enderud, '26. and Philip Berger,
'26, will represent Nestoria in the debate
with Sacramento Junior College at Sac
ramento tonight. Nestoria will uphold
the negative of the question, "Resolved,
That France was justified in her invasion
of the Ruhr."
A short business meeting was held
after the tryouts last night and plans for
the quarterly banquet were formulated.
This affair will be held on June 1 at
Joe's Place.
