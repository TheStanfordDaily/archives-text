# RAINBOW COLOR SCHEME USED AT PROM TONIGHT
## Entertainment Is Planned for Dinner Dance; No Flowers Allowed 
### 
Rainbow colors, shading from rose to
deepest purple, will shine from a multi
colored canopy over the dancers at the
Junior Prom tonight in the Pavilion.
The rainbow color scheme is carried
out by a false ceiling, of colors shading
through the seven rainbow tints. The
ends and the sides of the Pavilion are
draped with colors to match the ceiling,
while the side posts are covered with
blue and the large pillars with green.
Indirect Lighting Used
Indirect lighting is to be used through
out the Pavilion. There are no lights
above the ceiling, but two colored spots
are placed in each corner. Ghost lights
are on each pillar.
Booths are located under the balcony,
with lettered cards, reading from A to
Z, fixed upon them. For convenience in
locating partners for dances those whose
names are lower in the alphabet than
their partners, should meet at the booth
which displays the letter their partner's
surname begins with.
Dave Phennig's eight-piece orchestra
from the University of California will
furnish the music for dancing. The
sounding board has been placed on the
south side of the Pavilion.
Novelties Planned
The Century Trio from the California
Theater will be unable to furnish enter
tainment, due to the fact that a farewell
banquet is being given for them in San
Francisco. However, the committee
promises something novel in the way of
entertainment to occupy the dancers
while dinner is being served.
The dinner dance will begin at 11
o'clock. All dancers will be served at
tables arranged on the tennis courts di
rectly back of the Pavilion. The courts
will be enclosed with canvas and will be
reached by a passage way leading from
the Pavilion.
No Flowers Allowed
No flowers will be allowed at the dance
tonight, according to Prom officials.
Roughs will be admitted to the tennis
court side of the Pavilion after 11:30.
The Men's Council will deal with any
rough who destroys decorations or raises
unnecesary disturbances.
Four hundred and fifty tickets have
ljeen sold for the Prom, and no one with
out a pasteboard will be admitted at the
door tonight.
