# Second Story Men Pry "S" Loose From Gas Station
## 
### 
Gentleman Jack and his light-fingered
accomplice made a big haul last Saturday
night, when, to satisfy a woman's whim,
thej' scaled the campus filling station and
tore the red "S" from the sign, "Shell
Company," which hung thereon.
Coming home in the wee small hours
of the morning, two Stanford men, at
â€¢the srggestion of a fair companior, who
desired said "S" for decorating .ier
boudoir, resolved to scale the heights, j
One of the crooks who, clad in evening
dress, was just returning home from aj
formal, mounted upon the shoulders of
an assistant and by the aid of six-foot
crowbar pried the letter loose. That the
Stanford "S" has a kick to it was evi
denced by the force with which the letter j
came loose, for with a rebound, Gentle
man Jack catapulted backwards, landing
in the dust fifteen feet away.
Workmen arriving- on the scene next
morning blushed to read the sign made
shady by the absencc of the "S" and
hastened to remove the remainder of the
letters.
