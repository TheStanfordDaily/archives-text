Several upperclassmen were heard
and several important decisions were
made by the Freshman Class at a
meeting in Room 214 of the English
building at 10 o'clock this morning.
The disappearance of the sophomore
hat samples on display in a show case

covered, and also to ask the other
classes to appoint an advisory com

standard hat.

the subject of the senior control sys
tem. He declared that freshmen were
violating the tradition as to queening
on the Quad, cigaret smoking, wearing
a "dink," and attending assemblies
and urged that these customs be ob
served in the future.

domitdrry plan for next year. There
will be 140 senior sponsors in Encina
with the freshmen.
The freshman dance will take place
on Saturday, May 19. Tickets can be
obtained from Kay, Frank, Eckhoff,

The class approved the award of
numerals to boxers and wrestlers who
won their interclass matches.
