# Opera Coaches Say Success of "Fore" Assured
## 
### 
Richard Bentinck, director of the
1924 opera, seems pleased with the
outlook for tomorrow night. He
says:
"Miss McGovern has proved that
professional touches applied to ama
teur talent makes for great charm
and effective spontaneity. I have
only seen the chorus work of
"Knightie Knight" and the "Foot
ball Frothies of '22" for comparison,
but this of "Fore" is really corking.
The simplicity of the settings is ex
theremly pleasing and effective;
good taste and careful execution of
details will set a new mark."

Miss Margaret McGovern, direc
tor of the dancing and singing,
says:
"I have no doubt in my mind but
that the show will get over. The
spirit shown yesterday was fine.
When the boys see the chorus come
in for the finale of the second act
they'll all want a 'Gasoline Queen'."
