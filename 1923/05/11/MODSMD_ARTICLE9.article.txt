# PHI DELTA PHI IS TWO TO ONE WINNER IN DEBATE CONTEST
## Heaton Wrenn, Ted Bowen Are Victors Over Phil Smith and Landels 
### 
Phi Delta Phi, represented by Heaton
Wrenn and Ted Bowen, took a 2-1 de
cision from Phil Smith and Ed Landels,
arguing for Phi Alpha Delta, in a debate
Wednesday night in the Little Theater.
The subject was a discussion of the sec
ondary boycott and sympathetic strike
by a labor union, the latter being the
contention of the winners.
The employes of one Burke threatened
to strike against him unless he would
cease doing business with another firm
with whom the labor unions were having
trouble. The plaintiffs contended that the
action of the union men was conspiracy,
taking away the complaint's right of do
ing business. They said that if in such
a case either the ends sought, or means
used by the defendants were illegal, they
should be liable for damages. They made
the claim that both the means, which was
coercion, and the end sought, which was
destruction of plaintiff's business, were
illegal.
The winners displayed a slightly
stronger average in speaking ability and
the use of debating tactics. They gained
the point awarded by the judges for the
preparation of their briefs. Smith of
Phi Alpha Delta displayed much famili
arity with the subject, but was at a dis
advantage in reading his speech. Landels
and Bowen showed up strongly in re
buttal.
This was the second annual debate be
tween Phi Delta Phi and Phi Alpha
Delta, the latter winning last year's con
test.
Judges John T. North and William B.
Owen cast their votes for the winners.
Police Judge Lakin of Palo Alto was for
Phi Alpha Delta.
