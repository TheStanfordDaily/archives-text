Arnold Johnson's Orchestra
2411—"Sweet Lovin' Mama"
"Kiss Me"
Tico Lilting Fox Trots
Arnold Johnson's Orchestra makes records exclusively
for Brunswick, because like other noted dance orchestras
they found Brunswick Records truest, clearest and most
perfect in their interpretations. You'll like these two
sparkling dance records. Full of bouncing rhythm and
yielding melody. You'll want to dance to their rol
licking syncopation.
Something new every day
You can get new Brunswick Records every day.
No waiting. Go to any Brunswick dealer
and ask to have the new records played for you.
Brunswick Records can be played on any phono
graph but they are beat on The Brunswick.

lowering Masses walterm.mason.Archie
O Drawn by Hugh Ferriss
J_£ERE the new architecture expresses itself in great vig
orous masses which climb upward into the sky with a
pyramidal profile—gigantic, irregular, arresting. An earlier,
conventional building on the near corner is overshadowed,
engulfed in towering masses of the newer building which
are prophetic of an architecture of the future which is
vividly stimulating to the imagination.
Certainly modern invention —modern engineering skill
and organization, will prove more than equal to the de
mands of the architecture of the future.
