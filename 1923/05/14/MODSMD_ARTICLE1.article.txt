# TEN CARD TRACK MEN WILL ENTER MEET IN CHICAGO
## Team Goes East for National Collegiate Athletic Tilt on June 15-16, Says Barrow 
### 
The Board of Athletic Control au
thorized the sending of track team to
compete in the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association track and held meet in
Chicago, June 15 and 16, this morning.
The idea of sending a team East this
year has been made much of in rumors
shifting around the campus for the past
few weeks. Nothing definite had been
decided by the Board of Athletic Con
trol until this morning, when Dr. Bar
row announced, after a consultation with
a majority of the members of the board,
that the team would be sent East.
The meet at Chicago was considered
the most logical for the Stanford team
to enter for several reasons. One was
that the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet will con
flict with final examinations, while the
meet at Chicago can be entered without
the athletes missing any school, as their
final examinations can be given before
they leave. Stanford will not enter the
Pacific Coast Conference meet.
A ten-man team will be selected to
represent Stanford at Chicago. Coach
"Dink" Templeton has been watching
the men who have a chance to go
closely for the past two weeks, but has
not announced the men to make up
the team as yet. However, the men to
enter will probably be picked from
those who did the best in the Cali
fornia meet. The men who have the
best chance, then, seem to be Camp
bell, Judah, Williamson, Dole, Swayne,
Daly, Elliott, Falk, Leistner, Black,
Black, Kemnitzer, and Arthur.
Campbell will be able to take care of I
the sprints. He has not had much ex
perience before this year, but in the Cali
fornia meet he came second in the cen
tury and won the furlong with ease, set
ting a new Stanford-California record
of 0:22 1-5. Since the Big Meet "DinW
has been teaching Campbell some of the
finer points of starting, and if he goes
to Chicago he should be able to give a
better account of himself than he did in
the California meet.
Stanford has two fast men in the quar
ter to select from. These men arc Nel
son Van Judah and Blink Williamson.
Judah has shown himself to be one of
the best quarter-milers in the state.
The representatives in the half mile
will be either Dole, Swayne, or Daly.
Templeton has told these men that
whoever covers the half in 1:58 will
get to make the trip. If all three make
this time, they will probably all be
sent. Elliott is the outstanding miler,
having won the California meet mile
with ease.
In the hurdles, Stanford has two men
of tirst caliber. Lane Falk won both
events in the California meet, setting
new records for both. From this show
ing he should be able to place at Chi
cago. Leister runs neck and neck with
Falk, and may even be able to beat the
Stanford captain.
Bill Black in the pole vault will
undoubtedly be a member of the ten
man team. Bill came second at the
I.C.A.A.A.A. last year and has been
going better than ever this year. He
should be able to clear 13 feet under
hard competition

Falk, and may even be able to beat the
Stanford captain.
Bill Black in the pole vault will
undoubtedly be a member of the ten
man team. Bill came second at the
I.C.A.A.A.A. last year and has been
going better than ever this year. He

The Board of Athletic Control au
thorized the sending of track team to
compete in the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association track and held meet in
Chicago, June 15 and 16, this morning.
The idea of sending a team East this
year has been made much of in rumors
shifting around the campus for the past
few weeks. Nothing definite had been
decided by the Board of Athletic Con
trol until this morning, when Dr. Bar
row announced, after a consultation with
a majority of the members of the board,
that the team would be sent East.
The meet at Chicago was considered
the most logical for the Stanford team
to enter for several reasons. One was
that the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet will con
flict with final examinations, while the
meet at Chicago can be entered without
the athletes missing any school, as their
final examinations can be given before
they leave. Stanford will not enter the
Pacific Coast Conference meet.
A ten-man team will be selected to
represent Stanford at Chicago. Coach
"Dink" Templeton has been watching
the men who have a chance to go
closely for the past two weeks, but has
not announced the men to make up
the team as yet. However, the men to
enter will probably be picked from
those who did the best in the Cali
fornia meet. The men who have the
best chance, then, seem to be Camp
bell, Judah, Williamson, Dole, Swayne,
Daly, Elliott, Falk, Leistner, Black,
Black, Kemnitzer, and Arthur.
Campbell will be able to take care of I
the sprints. He has not had much ex
perience before this year, but in the Cali
fornia meet he came second in the cen
tury and won the furlong with ease, set
ting a new Stanford-California record
of 0:22 1-5. Since the Big Meet "DinW
has been teaching Campbell some of the
finer points of starting, and if he goes
to Chicago he should be able to give a
better account of himself than he did in
the California meet.
Stanford has two fast men in the quar
ter to select from. These men arc Nel
son Van Judah and Blink Williamson.
Judah has shown himself to be one of
the best quarter-milers in the state.
The representatives in the half mile
will be either Dole, Swayne, or Daly.
Templeton has told these men that
whoever covers the half in 1:58 will
get to make the trip. If all three make
this time, they will probably all be
sent. Elliott is the outstanding miler,
having won the California meet mile
with ease.
In the hurdles, Stanford has two men
of tirst caliber. Lane Falk won both
events in the California meet, setting
new records for both. From this show
ing he should be able to place at Chi
cago. Leister runs neck and neck with
Falk, and may even be able to beat the
Stanford captain.
