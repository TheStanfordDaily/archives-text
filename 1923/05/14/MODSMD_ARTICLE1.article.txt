# TEN CARD TRACK MEN WILL ENTER MEET IN CHICAGO
## Team Goes East for National Collegiate Athletic Tilt on June 15-16, Says Barrow 
### 
The Board of Athletic Control au
thorized the sending of track team to
compete in the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association track and held meet in
Chicago, June 15 and 16, this morning.
The idea of sending a team East this
year has been made much of in rumors
shifting around the campus for the past
few weeks. Nothing definite had been
decided by the Board of Athletic Con
trol until this morning, when Dr. Bar
row announced, after a consultation with
a majority of the members of the board,
that the team would be sent East.
The meet at Chicago was considered
the most logical for the Stanford team
to enter for several reasons. One was
that the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet will con
flict with final examinations, while the
meet at Chicago can be entered without
the athletes missing any school, as their
final examinations can be given before
they leave. Stanford will not enter the
Pacific Coast Conference meet.
A ten-man team will be selected to
represent Stanford at Chicago. Coach
"Dink" Templeton has been watching
the men who have a chance to go
closely for the past two weeks, but has
not announced the men to make up
the team as yet. However, the men to
enter will probably be picked from
those who did the best in the Cali
fornia meet. The men who have the
best chance, then, seem to be Camp
bell, Judah, Williamson, Dole, Swayne,
Daly, Elliott, Falk, Leistner, Black,
Black, Kemnitzer, and Arthur.
Campbell will be able to take care of I
the sprints. He has not had much ex
perience before this year, but in the Cali
fornia meet he came second in the cen
tury and won the furlong with ease, set
ting a new Stanford-California record
