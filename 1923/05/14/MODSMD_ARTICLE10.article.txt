# VARSITY NINE DROPS SERIES TO WILDCATS
## Team Wins Three Games Out of Five Played on Trip; Woodward Slightly Hurt 
### 
Members of the varsity nine returned
to the campus last evening after losing
the University of Arizona series by two
games to one. The record of the entire
trip gives Stanford three victories and
two defeats.
The second Arizona game, played at
Tucson last Friday afternoon, went to
the Wildcats by a 9 to 1 score. Clark
pitched a fairly good game, but the hit
ting of the Arizona team, combined with
the unfavorable nature of the diamond,
kept the Cards out of the running. Ac
cording to the team, the dust was often
so thick that "Shorty" Roberts could not
see first base from his position at short.
The score was fairly tight until the
eighth inning, when the Wildcats got
three home runs over a short fence in
right field. Woodward twisted his ankle
during this inning, and the injury kept
him on the bench for the rest of the trip.
The final game was played in Phoenix
Saturday afternoon before an enthusi
astic crowd of alumni. With Milton
Teague in the box, the varsity caught its
stride and tamed the Wildcats by 8-1.
Captain Peavy moved over to first base,
with Robert's on second and Mulchay at
short. The team played good ball and
got the breaks, Carver and Fuller con
tributing home runs.
The first two games of the trip result
ed in overwhelming victories over a
Dakersfield Standard Oil team and Occi
dental College.
