# INTRAMURAL NINES WILL START FINAL GAMES NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
With five of the six intramural base-!
hall leagues decided, C. W. Davis, direc
tor of intramural sports, is making plans j
for the semi-finals, which will be run
off either the latter part of this week
or the first of next week. The only sec
tion not finished is League 1, where the
Sigma Nu and Kappa Sigma nines are
fighting for the title.
The winners of the different groups
are: League 2, El Cuadro; League 3,
Theta Xi; League 4, Alpha Delta Phi;
League 5, Sigma Alpha Epsilon; League
6, Delta Upsilon. Sigma Nu and Kappa
Sigma will meet Wednesday afternoon I
at 4 o'clock to determine the winner in
League 1.
The six winners will be divided into
two groups, and a round robin will be
played. A plaque will be given for win
ning the intramural baseball champion
ship.
A drawing was made this morning and
the teams divided into the following
groups: Group 1, Kappa Sigma or Sig
ma Nu, El Cuadro, Delta Upsilon; group
2, Theta Xi, Alpha Delta Phi, and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.
The order in which these teams will
play their games follows (The dates have
not been decided yet) : First day, Kappa
Sigma or Sigma Nu vs. Delta Upsilon;
Theta Xi vs. Alpha Delta Phi. Second
day, Kappa Sigma or Sigma Nu vs. El
Cuadro, Ttteta Vi vs. Sigma Alpha Ep-!
silon. Third day, Delta Upsilon vs. El
Cuadro, Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs. Alpha
Delta Phi.
All of the teams reaching the finals
have weathered their preliminary sched
ules without the loss of a game. As
none of the teams have met each other,
or have played any of the same teams,
little comparison can be given.
Sigma Nu has a pitcher in Jimmy
Aydelotte, who is capable of winning
games himself without much help from
his teammates. Aydelotte pitched five
innings in one of the league games and
allowed but one hit. Theta Xi is almost
equally strong in the pitching branch,
with Marlow doing their mound work.
|El Cuadro and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
were not given a great deal of hard com
petition in their leagues, and as yet have
not had a chance to show everything
they have. The Alpha Delts have a well
balanced nine and, although they have no
stars, their team should make a bid for
first honors.
