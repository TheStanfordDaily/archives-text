# CLASS OF 1924 PLAYS HOST IN JUNIOR WEEK FESTIVITIES
## Thousand People Dance at Prom; "Cord" Ball and Canoe Flotilla Are Added As New Features 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
The Class of 1924 played host to undergraduates and alumni in the annual
Junior Week festivities Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and she carried out
her part well.
From the first strains of the music at (he Corduroy Ball Thursday after
noon until the last satisfied customer filed out of the Assembly Hall Saturday
evening voting "Fore" a huge success, everything moved swiftly and most,
satisfactorily.
The Cord Ball, engineered by Lillian Cottrell, "Si" Symons, and Bev Bailard.
was the first innovation introduced by the Class of *24. Grinstead furnished

y music in the Women's Clubhouse from
5 to 8 for juniors and their partners.
Cords and other .campus garb were
in vogue. Supper was served between
6 and 7 o'clock.
At 8 o'clock, the juniors joined the
rest of the revelers at Lagunita for
the Lake Carnival which had been ad
vertised as something out of the ordi
nary. It was. Barring the fireworks
which fizzled as they usually do, Dan
Gage and his committee furnished an
excellent program.
Music by the Stanford Band, a string
quartet and a vocal quartet, a flame
dive by Don Snedden, and finally the
Canoe Flotilla, itself, kept the spec
tators on their toes every minute.
The flotilla was easily the most spec
tacular event on the program. Twenty
one canoes, representing fraternities,
sororities, and clubs, filed past the
east bank of the lake illuminated by
red flares in the lake, and flood lights
on the boathouse and bandstand.
Satan, driving an alligator, vied with
steamboats, swans, and log cabinß.
while a demure little Chinese maiden
competed with an old-fashioned girl,
a peacock, a pair of Eskimos, and
numerous flowered canoes, for the
favor of the judges.
