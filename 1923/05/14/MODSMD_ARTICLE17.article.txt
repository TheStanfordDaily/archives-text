# CLASS OF 1924 PLAYS HOST IN JUNIOR WEEK FESTIVITIES
## Thousand People Dance at Prom; "Cord" Ball and Canoe Flotilla Are Added As New Features 
### Don Liebendorfer, '24 
The Class of 1924 played host to undergraduates and alumni in the annual
Junior Week festivities Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and she carried out
her part well.
From the first strains of the music at (he Corduroy Ball Thursday after
noon until the last satisfied customer filed out of the Assembly Hall Saturday
evening voting "Fore" a huge success, everything moved swiftly and most,
satisfactorily.
The Cord Ball, engineered by Lillian Cottrell, "Si" Symons, and Bev Bailard.
was the first innovation introduced by the Class of *24. Grinstead furnished

y music in the Women's Clubhouse from
5 to 8 for juniors and their partners.
Cords and other .campus garb were
in vogue. Supper was served between
6 and 7 o'clock.
At 8 o'clock, the juniors joined the
rest of the revelers at Lagunita for
the Lake Carnival which had been ad
vertised as something out of the ordi
nary. It was. Barring the fireworks
which fizzled as they usually do, Dan
Gage and his committee furnished an
excellent program.
Music by the Stanford Band, a string
quartet and a vocal quartet, a flame
dive by Don Snedden, and finally the
Canoe Flotilla, itself, kept the spec
tators on their toes every minute.
The flotilla was easily the most spec
tacular event on the program. Twenty
one canoes, representing fraternities,
sororities, and clubs, filed past the
east bank of the lake illuminated by
red flares in the lake, and flood lights
on the boathouse and bandstand.
Satan, driving an alligator, vied with
steamboats, swans, and log cabinß.
while a demure little Chinese maiden
competed with an old-fashioned girl,
a peacock, a pair of Eskimos, and
numerous flowered canoes, for the
favor of the judges.
Satan and the little Chinese maid
won out and eatli received a beautiful
loving cup. Satan was entered by
Sigma Chi and the oriental float by
Alpha Phi.
All (lav Friday, every one was sym
pathizing with every one else. "Too
bad the Prom is going to be crowded,
i can't see what got into Charlie
White and 'Nip' McHose."
And Friday night, the two last
named gentlemen were having pro
longed tits of laughter at the expense
of the pessimists who attended the
Prom more out of duty than anything
else. There were 1000 people on the
Pavilion floor.
The supper was served on the tennis
courts while a string trio furnished
music and masked cigarette girls flit
ted about, offering a cigarette and a
match to every man.
Dave Phennig, and his seven musi
cians furnished the music for the
dance. It is hard to imagine better ,
music than was heard in the Pavilion
Friday night. Phennig gave two violin
solos.
The decorations presented novel
ideas which have never been seen on
the campus before. The false ceiling
was constructed in rainbow colors
which tapered off from high over the i
center of the floor to either side. There j
was plenty of light, but not too much. -
Flood lights in the corners of the
building, and spot lights on an ele
vated platform in the middle of the
tioor gave an ever-changing and pleas
ing effect.
"Nip" McHose was responsible for
the scheme of decorations and Orville
Tucker was in charge of the work.
Johnnie Plimpton had charge of the
catering.
The Saturday afternoon lake sports
were neither better nor worse than
they have been in the past. The regu
lation swimming and canoe races were
in order. A1 White and Don Snedden
gi.ve exhibitions of fancy diving and
Ed Lamb had his Seagrave fire en- 1

gine spouting great volumes of water.
The afternoon opened with regular
P. A. A. swimming events in Encina
Pool.
The dance at Roble hall from 4:30
till 5:30 was well attended.

The Junior Opera, "Fore," closed
Junior Week Saturday night.
The Class of 1924 played host to undergraduates and alumni in the annual
Junior Week festivities Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and she carried out
her part well.
From the first strains of the music at (he Corduroy Ball Thursday after
noon until the last satisfied customer filed out of the Assembly Hall Saturday
evening voting "Fore" a huge success, everything moved swiftly and most,
satisfactorily.
The Cord Ball, engineered by Lillian Cottrell, "Si" Symons, and Bev Bailard.
was the first innovation introduced by the Class of *24. Grinstead furnished

y music in the Women's Clubhouse from
5 to 8 for juniors and their partners.
Cords and other .campus garb were
in vogue. Supper was served between
6 and 7 o'clock.
At 8 o'clock, the juniors joined the
rest of the revelers at Lagunita for
the Lake Carnival which had been ad
vertised as something out of the ordi
nary. It was. Barring the fireworks
which fizzled as they usually do, Dan
Gage and his committee furnished an
excellent program.
Music by the Stanford Band, a string
quartet and a vocal quartet, a flame
dive by Don Snedden, and finally the
Canoe Flotilla, itself, kept the spec
tators on their toes every minute.
The flotilla was easily the most spec
tacular event on the program. Twenty
one canoes, representing fraternities,
sororities, and clubs, filed past the
east bank of the lake illuminated by
red flares in the lake, and flood lights
on the boathouse and bandstand.
Satan, driving an alligator, vied with
steamboats, swans, and log cabinß.
while a demure little Chinese maiden
competed with an old-fashioned girl,
a peacock, a pair of Eskimos, and
numerous flowered canoes, for the
favor of the judges.
Satan and the little Chinese maid
won out and eatli received a beautiful
loving cup. Satan was entered by
Sigma Chi and the oriental float by
Alpha Phi.
All (lav Friday, every one was sym
pathizing with every one else. "Too
bad the Prom is going to be crowded,
i can't see what got into Charlie
White and 'Nip' McHose."
And Friday night, the two last
named gentlemen were having pro
longed tits of laughter at the expense
of the pessimists who attended the
Prom more out of duty than anything
else. There were 1000 people on the
Pavilion floor.
The supper was served on the tennis
courts while a string trio furnished
music and masked cigarette girls flit
ted about, offering a cigarette and a
match to every man.
Dave Phennig, and his seven musi
cians furnished the music for the
dance. It is hard to imagine better ,
music than was heard in the Pavilion
Friday night. Phennig gave two violin
solos.
The decorations presented novel
ideas which have never been seen on
the campus before. The false ceiling
was constructed in rainbow colors
which tapered off from high over the i
center of the floor to either side. There j
was plenty of light, but not too much. -
Flood lights in the corners of the
building, and spot lights on an ele
vated platform in the middle of the
tioor gave an ever-changing and pleas
ing effect.
"Nip" McHose was responsible for
the scheme of decorations and Orville
Tucker was in charge of the work.
Johnnie Plimpton had charge of the
catering.
The Saturday afternoon lake sports
were neither better nor worse than
they have been in the past. The regu

in order. A1 White and Don Snedden
gi.ve exhibitions of fancy diving and
Ed Lamb had his Seagrave fire en- 1
