# INTRAMURAL TRACK STARTS TODAY WITH DASH AND BROAD JUMP
## 
### 
The intramural track and field meet
started this afternoon with seventeen
teams entered. The events on the card
today are the 100-yard dash and the
broad jump. Tomorrow the 120<-yard
low hurdles and the shot put will be
held. Entrants may run or jump any
time between 2 and 5 o'clock, and
the hurdles and shot put will be held
between the same hours tomorrow.
Points are being awarded according
to the group scoring system outlined
in the A. A. U. rule book. That is, 1000
points are awarded for the theoretic
perfect and points are deducted from
this number for each fifth of a second
or inch over this. Ten men from each
team will be given points, and the
team making the greatest number of
points in six events will be awarded a
plaque. The man making the best in
dividual record in six events will be
awarded a gold medal.
As an example of the scoring method
the 100-yard dash will be cited. A man
running this race in 9 4-5 will be
given 1000 points. However, if he
should run it in 10 flat 42 points will
be deducted, giving him 952 points.
Forty-two points are deducted for each
fifth of a second over 9 4-5. :14 3-5 is
the slowest time that will count points.
In the broad jump 23 feet 6 1-2
inches is considered perfect and 1000
points awarded for this distance. Eight
points are deducted for each inch less
than this mark, so that a man jumping
13 feet 4 inches will be able to score
for his team.
The hurdles are not included in the
A. A. U. time list. Director C. W.
Davis will calculate the points to be
given in this event and they will be
announced tomorrow. In the shot put
47 feet wins 1000 points and four
points are deducted for each inch less
than this distance. The minimum dis
tance that will count is 26 feet 2
inches.
According to this scoring system
each team will be able to have ten
men count points, and in this way
Director Davis hopes to have a large
number of men entered. Teams not al
ready entered in the meet may do so
at any time today or tomorrow.
