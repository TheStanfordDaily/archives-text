# AUTOMOBILES AGAIN
## 
### 
Last quarter it was announced that because of the
variance and intangibility of so-called student opin
ion, the editorial columns of the Daily Pat.o Alto
would attempt to do no more than present personal
reactions to different phases of campus life, desiring
not to influence thought so much as to stimulate it.
Agitation against automobiles has sprung up again
with renewed vigor. We are not at all sure that the
prohibition of student-owned machines is the pan
acea for all current ills or that it is even feasible, but
the columns of the student newspaper are open to
any discussion of the question, and any opinions on
either side are more than welcome.
The increase of machines at Stanford is no local
problem, and is no more alarming than the increase
in the entire population of the country. They are
probably in direct proportion.
Athletic defeats and other troubles have been
blamed ujxmi tuition, scholarship regulations—upon
almost everything but the food served in the Union.
It is only natural that automobiles should come in
for their share.
If we are going to make any prohibition,to in
clude the entire student body, we must remember
that special dispensation must be made for those
living off the campus and those whose work makes
machines an absolute necessity. As long as there are
such regulations there will be means of getting
around them, and the result may be more disin
tegrating than unifying. We must remember, too,
that some of the most representative men and those
who work the hardest in Stanford enterprises are car
owners—although it is also true that low-cut bodies
and brilliant furnishings are more scarce in this
group.
Denying the use of cars to freshmen is another
question and there is no very sound argument to pro
tect the first-year man who drives on to the campus
in his own machine. Next year freshmen will have
to live in dormitories on the campus and will be
under direct control of the Administration to such
an extent that the prevention of car-ownership will
be easy to enforce. It is of no particular aid in de
veloping character or intelligence for a freshman to
have a car on the campus, and it is true that such a
luxury often gives an unfair and artificial advantage
which i.- anything but a democratizing influence. By
the end of the first year, however, students should
be sufficiently acclimated, independent, and of sane
enough judgment to control their own affairs.
The feelers have been thrown out —and the fight
is on.

Denying the use of cars to freshmen is another
question and there is no very sound argument to pro
tect the first-year man who drives on to the campus
in his own machine. Next year freshmen will have
to live in dormitories on the campus and will be
under direct control of the Administration to such
an extent that the prevention of car-ownership will
be easy to enforce. It is of no particular aid in de
veloping character or intelligence for a freshman to
have a car on the campus, and it is true that such a
luxury often gives an unfair and artificial advantage
which i.- anything but a democratizing influence. By
the end of the first year, however, students should
be sufficiently acclimated, independent, and of sane
enough judgment to control their own affairs.
The feelers have been thrown out —and the fight
is on.
Last quarter it was announced that because of the
variance and intangibility of so-called student opin
ion, the editorial columns of the Daily Pat.o Alto
would attempt to do no more than present personal
reactions to different phases of campus life, desiring
not to influence thought so much as to stimulate it.
Agitation against automobiles has sprung up again
with renewed vigor. We are not at all sure that the
prohibition of student-owned machines is the pan
acea for all current ills or that it is even feasible, but
the columns of the student newspaper are open to
any discussion of the question, and any opinions on
either side are more than welcome.
The increase of machines at Stanford is no local
problem, and is no more alarming than the increase
in the entire population of the country. They are
probably in direct proportion.
Athletic defeats and other troubles have been
blamed ujxmi tuition, scholarship regulations—upon
almost everything but the food served in the Union.
It is only natural that automobiles should come in
for their share.
If we are going to make any prohibition,to in
clude the entire student body, we must remember
that special dispensation must be made for those
living off the campus and those whose work makes
machines an absolute necessity. As long as there are
such regulations there will be means of getting
around them, and the result may be more disin
tegrating than unifying. We must remember, too,
that some of the most representative men and those
who work the hardest in Stanford enterprises are car
owners—although it is also true that low-cut bodies
and brilliant furnishings are more scarce in this
group.
