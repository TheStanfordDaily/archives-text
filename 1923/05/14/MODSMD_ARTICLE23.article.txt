Cabbages has had so many questions shot to it lately
that it would be a shame if it passed them all by; so
it sits back in the easy chair and lets flow this garnering
of wisdom (all free of charge understand).
Dear Cab:
What is so rare as good grades in June?
GIVUM LOW MARX.
Dear Giv:
Good grades the year around.

Dear Ed of Cabbages:
What is a monkey wrench?
IMA IN QUISITIVE.
Dear Ima:
The sprained ankle of an ape.

deer Cabbiges:
What is the Colossus of Rhodes?

Dear Hades:
We wouldn't be sure, but our guess is, the Lincoln

I used to be a banker's son, and had an awful time,
For Dad kept strict account of me, whene'er I spent a
dime;
I worked my way through college, altho he helped me
some,
My clothes were old, my meals Were slim, I lived just
like a bum,
No pleasures ever passed my way; (to have them one
needs kale)
And so that first year's life to me were just as days
.in jail.
But now Dad's given up that job and got another one,
I do not have a single care, my pleasures have begun,
A Stutz is not too good for me, my restaurant bills are
high,
Beau Brummel was not better dressed, I have what
coin" can buy.
Through all these joys I'll ne'er forget when Dad was
'most a beggar;
Oh, how I wish I'd always been the son of a bootlegger.

You would clean that place on your pink crepe de chine;
When sunbeams shine bright it just seems
Not much better than nuthin' at all!

I used to be a banker's son, and had an awful time,
For Dad kept strict account of me, whene'er I spent a
dime;
I worked my way through college, altho he helped me
some,
My clothes were old, my meals Were slim, I lived just
like a bum,
No pleasures ever passed my way; (to have them one
needs kale)
And so that first year's life to me were just as days
.in jail.
But now Dad's given up that job and got another one,
I do not have a single care, my pleasures have begun,
A Stutz is not too good for me, my restaurant bills are
high,
Beau Brummel was not better dressed, I have what
coin" can buy.
Through all these joys I'll ne'er forget when Dad was
'most a beggar;
Oh, how I wish I'd always been the son of a bootlegger.
