Class spirit, once a highly lauded quality of the under
graduate, and a very considerable influence in his college
life, seems to be sadly on the wane at Cornell. Whether
or not the change is serious is a question still to be
determined. Possibly, with the passing of underclass
rivalries and the introduction of organized rushes, super
vised by members of the Student Council, class spirit
has simply found no way in which to express itself out
side of the classroom; lacking its natural food of good
natured violence, the habit of thinking of the class as an
entity, has simply undergone a process of attrition.
Be that as it may, the fact remains that sophomore
smokers and freshman and senior banquets are less and
less frequently attended. The committees this year re
port even more than the customary difficulties in dis
posing of tickets, and, from present indications, these
gatherings are likely to be rather pathetic than jovial,
as is their wont.
It seems a pity that such should be the An
annual gathering of the members of one class, in the
freshman year to get acquainted, in the sophomore to
"see who is left," and in the senior as a sort of farewell
to the Alma Mater, appears to offer as pleasant an op
portunity for social diversion and refaxation from or
dinary campus life as could well be ibagined. Looked
at in this light, it is almost a pity that a junior smoker
does not exist as a gathering for members of that class
alone. —Cornell Sun.
