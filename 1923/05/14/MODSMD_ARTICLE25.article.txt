# FORE!

### Mildred Dannenbaum, '24 
"Fore!" Get out of the way or get
hit! But nobody wanted to move after
the curtain went up, and the Junior
Opera made a big hit.
Pretty women, graceful dancers,
syncopation melodies and colorful af
ternoon frocks and evening gowns
made "Fore" a real knock-out. The
audience eagerly watched the course
of the opera from the drive-off to the
finish. But this game was played with
out any golf clubs —there were no
"sticks" in the musical comedy.
When the
glided across the stage to the melodi
ous refrain of "Gazing" well who
wouldn't look! And it's certain that no
one would mind being stuck in the
mud at 9 p. m. if he could have the
clever song and dance specialty acts
of the opera to entertain him. On the
contrary he would probably be hoping
that it would rain often.
If women like variety Dorothy
should have been pleased with the
various kinds of proposals that were
rehearsed for her. The types of speech
es ranged from the proposal of the
champion athlete who could hand a
line as well as he could hold a line,
to the Swami who translated his rav
ings into Indian love lyrics. Although
the "fore" suitors pleased the audi
ence, they didn't have a chance to
make a hit with Dorothy, because the
bond salesman, who was a fifth suitor,
was lucky enough to be first in Doro
thy's affections.
But the specialty act that made peo
ple sit up and grab their opera glasses
was Miss Margaret McGovern's imper
sonation of Sophie Tucker. All the men
leaned forward and gazed at the stage
with more intentness than the Swami
looked into the crystal.
