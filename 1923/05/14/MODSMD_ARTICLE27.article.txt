# DR.R.H. HODGKIN DESCRIBES STUDENTS' DEBT TO WORLD
## 
### 
"University students, as individuals,
and America as a nation, have the re
sponsibility of the first-horn, and as such,
we art- compelled to accept our position
and to give the world an adequate re
turn for our advantage."
1 )r. Reginald Hodgkin of St. Mark's
Church, Berkeley, expressed this idea
of the meaning of college—and national
—education. Our point of vantage lies
in health, mental development, and eco
nomic well-being, which puts us in the
place of leaders of the community, lie
asserted. Those who have not a college
education have a potential handicap,
while university-trained Americans have
-or should have—a broader outlook and
ideal*.
"As one speaker said in Berkeley,"
Dr. Hodgkin declared, "newspapers make

a lot out of the follies of college students,
but after all, it is because such news is
out-of-the-ordinary.
"The university graduate really owes
more to the world, for others have paid
for his education. Some people hold the
view that she should get more—not so—
lie does not pay for his training. It is
the past and present which makes uni
versities possible; wealthy individuals or
the state are responsible for his oppor
tunity."
The average student is simply on the
receiving end of the henetit, because he
has not only an invaluable training, but
he has a good time while getting it, the
speaker said. "His responsibility is ex
pressed in the old idea of 'noblesse
oblige!'"
