### 
What spring practice has brought out
in the way of football prospects for the
1923 varsity forms the basis of the lead-'
ing athletic article in the May Spectator, \
which will go on sale Wednesday. In

the probable development of a backfield:
which may be much stronger than indi-„
cations have previously warranted.

leges in the Coming National Intercol
legiate Tennis Matches at Haverford" is

contains much interesting "dope" on col
legiate tennis.

"What Happens to All Our Lawyers," j
discusses the prospects in the law pro
fession as he has been able to deduce
them from statistics gathered by the i
Stanford and Harvard law schools and
from interviews with alumni and law
professors. The §rticle should be of par-j
ticular interest to many who are con-!
templating the study c*f law.
"The Eating Problem on the Campus j
and How It Is Being Solved," discusses j
the plans at the Union, Roble, Sequoia,
and elsewhere. The dissatisfaction at

helmson and a short story by an anony
mous author constitute the literary fea
tures of the issue. The magazine will
