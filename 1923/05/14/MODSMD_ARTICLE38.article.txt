# All Classes to Aid in Sophomore Hat Selection
## 
### 
The Senior Control Committee spon
sors the plan by which representa
tives of all the other classes may take
part in the selection of a standard
sophomore hat or cap for all coming
second-year classes.
One representative of each of the
upper classes will be asked to serve
on a committee to advise the freshman
board as to the choice of sophomore
headgear. Their powers could be only
through suggestion, as it was brought
up that in the last resort the future
sophomores could effectively veto any
selection by "non-cooperation" in wear
ing the hat; but the choice made by
the combined committees is to be per
manent.
The date for the Senior Jolly-up in
the Women's Clubhouse has been set
for May 22.
Another student assembly will take
place in two weeks. The impetus of
the last assembly, which Lou Minsky,
'23, chairman, believes was an unquali
fied success, has in part carried the
plan through to further student body
meetings.
The chairman of the Senior Control
Committee has appointed the follow
ing class representatives to assist the
freshman committee in selecting the
sophmore hat: Laurence Mertz, '23;
Brad Wyatt, '23; Bill Gage, *24;
Charles White, '24; Charles Beardsley,
'25; Charles McCallister, '25. These
men will meet with the freshman com
mittee tomorrow at 5 o'clock in the
Associated Students room in the Ad
ministration building.
