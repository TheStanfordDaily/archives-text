# JUNIOR OPERA SETS NEW SPECIALTY AND CHORUS STANDARDS
## 
### Henry Mack, '24 
The rule that a poor start makes a good finish was tested in the dramatic
laboratory Saturday night and proved true beyond a reasonable doubt, when
"Fore" passed across the footlights of the campus stage.
Good music, clever sets, and some fifty people "All Teed Up" to just the
proper pitch put "Fore" across better than any show that has been on the
Assembly Hall boards in three years. From about the middle of the first act,
to the finale, cast and chorus vied with each other in a display of pep. . . .
which is the prerequisite of any show's success.
Perhaps the biggest fault of the show was the lack of snappy, clever lines.
Laughs were isolated phenomena rather than fast-following upon each other,

as a clever show should have them.*
The lack of laughs in the book made
the work of the cast dimmer than
usual, in one respect. It was a case of
waiting for a song or dance to come
along and liven up the plot, rather
than taking the lines for their own
sake.
Music of High Quality
Fortunately, both the song and the
dance came along at frequent inter
vals, and did succeed in livening up
the show beyond the hope even of the
most optimistic. While the musical
numbers were rather fewer than they
should have been —there were but two
new ones ill the third act, where they
should have predominated—they made
up in quality what they lacked in
quantity. "Gazing" and"Day Dreams"
vied for first place in popularity, with
"I Got a Feeling" running a close sec
ond. On the comic side of the musical
score, "Gasoline Queen" was by far
the best.
Far ahead of anything else in the
whole production stands out the
choruses. To the chorus goes largely
the credit for success of the show; and
to Miss Margaret McGovern goas all
the credit for the success of the
chorus. Well-trained, well-costumed,
and full of pep, their entry made even
the most astute sit up and feel happy,
and their exit was a signal for violent
encore.
Specialties Also Make Hit
Not far behind the chorus in saving
respect were the specialty numbers.
Dorothy Dahler and Bill Lucas, in a
song and dance, set a record for en
cores on the campus, returning for
five, all of them well-earned. Van Deu
sen and Lippincott staged another va
riety act not far behind in quality.
The cast itself made the most of
each opportunity, and filled in between
choruses with some clever work. In
Gene Trago the casting committee
found an ideal man to carry the show
across any rough spots which might—
and did —develop. A good voice, pleas
ing manner, and confident stage pres
ence made him invaluable to the suc
cess of the production.
The four rivals for the hand of
Dorothy were also well chosen. Rich
ard Faville, as the boring athlete, was
perhaps most natural in manner; his
work in proposing to an imaginary
Dorothy in Act 111 was worthy of the
applause it received,
Dorothy herself was "no mean act
ress." Her voice was modulated and
sweet, and she was pretty and petite
enough for any young man to fall in
love with. To Elizabeth Noyes must
go the laurels for the best women's
character work.
Cadwallader Cobb, young golf-hound,
and Marjorie Anderson, who was stalk
ing Reginald throughout the play, ac
cording to the program—we were
never given a chance to find out if
she succeeded in her hunt —exhibited
a knowledge of dramatic technique and
the possibilities of their parts which
gives much promise of good work in
the future.
As for the remainder of the cast,
and the specialty numbers, let it be
recorded that they did their part for
the success of "Fore" in a fay that
deserves much credit, were there space
to set it down.

score, "Gasoline Queen" was by far
the best.
Far ahead of anything else in the
whole production stands out the
choruses. To the chorus goes largely
the credit for success of the show; and
to Miss Margaret McGovern goas all
the credit for the success of the
chorus. Well-trained, well-costumed,
and full of pep, their entry made even
the most astute sit up and feel happy,
and their exit was a signal for violent
encore.
Specialties Also Make Hit
Not far behind the chorus in saving
respect were the specialty numbers.
Dorothy Dahler and Bill Lucas, in a
song and dance, set a record for en
cores on the campus, returning for
five, all of them well-earned. Van Deu
sen and Lippincott staged another va
riety act not far behind in quality.
The cast itself made the most of
each opportunity, and filled in between
choruses with some clever work. In
Gene Trago the casting committee
found an ideal man to carry the show
across any rough spots which might—
and did —develop. A good voice, pleas
ing manner, and confident stage pres
ence made him invaluable to the suc
cess of the production.
The four rivals for the hand of
Dorothy were also well chosen. Rich
ard Faville, as the boring athlete, was
perhaps most natural in manner; his
work in proposing to an imaginary
Dorothy in Act 111 was worthy of the
applause it received,
Dorothy herself was "no mean act
ress." Her voice was modulated and
sweet, and she was pretty and petite
enough for any young man to fall in
love with. To Elizabeth Noyes must
go the laurels for the best women's
character work.
Cadwallader Cobb, young golf-hound,
and Marjorie Anderson, who was stalk
ing Reginald throughout the play, ac
cording to the program—we were
never given a chance to find out if
she succeeded in her hunt —exhibited
a knowledge of dramatic technique and
the possibilities of their parts which
gives much promise of good work in
the future.
As for the remainder of the cast,
and the specialty numbers, let it be
recorded that they did their part for
the success of "Fore" in a fay that
deserves much credit, were there space
to set it down.
The rule that a poor start makes a good finish was tested in the dramatic
laboratory Saturday night and proved true beyond a reasonable doubt, when
"Fore" passed across the footlights of the campus stage.
Good music, clever sets, and some fifty people "All Teed Up" to just the
proper pitch put "Fore" across better than any show that has been on the
Assembly Hall boards in three years. From about the middle of the first act,
to the finale, cast and chorus vied with each other in a display of pep. . . .
which is the prerequisite of any show's success.
Perhaps the biggest fault of the show was the lack of snappy, clever lines.
Laughs were isolated phenomena rather than fast-following upon each other,

as a clever show should have them.*
The lack of laughs in the book made
the work of the cast dimmer than
usual, in one respect. It was a case of
waiting for a song or dance to come
along and liven up the plot, rather
than taking the lines for their own
sake.
Music of High Quality
Fortunately, both the song and the
dance came along at frequent inter
vals, and did succeed in livening up
the show beyond the hope even of the
most optimistic. While the musical
numbers were rather fewer than they
should have been —there were but two
new ones ill the third act, where they
should have predominated—they made
up in quality what they lacked in
quantity. "Gazing" and"Day Dreams"
vied for first place in popularity, with
"I Got a Feeling" running a close sec
ond. On the comic side of the musical
score, "Gasoline Queen" was by far
the best.
