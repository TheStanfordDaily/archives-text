# JUNIOR OPERA SETS NEW SPECIALTY AND CHORUS STANDARDS

### Henry Mack, '24 
The rule that a poor start makes a good finish was tested in the dramatic
laboratory Saturday night and proved true beyond a reasonable doubt, when
"Fore" passed across the footlights of the campus stage.
Good music, clever sets, and some fifty people "All Teed Up" to just the

"I Got a Feeling" running a close sec
ond. On the comic side of the musical
