# EXAMINER MAN TO GIVE TALK BEFORE JOURNALIST GROUP
## 
### 
Will M. Hines, city editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, will give an infor
mal talk to the members of the Stanford
Chapter of the American Journalists'
Association tomorrow evening at 7:30 at
the home of Professor and Mrs. Everett
W. Smith, 12 Alvarado Row. The asso
ciation invites any who are interested to
attend this meeting, whether they are
members of the association or not.
Hines has been city editor of the
Examiner for four years, and before that
had experience as reporter and desk man
on the Examiner and on the old San Jose
Times, on which he did his first news
paper work. Ernest Hopkins, a Stanford
man, who is now a reporter on the Ex
aminer, says of Hines: "He has a most
remarkable news judgment and an almost
uncanny ability to select the right man
on his staff to handle stories for the best
resulfs. He does one thing that no other
city editor that I know does, and that is
to go out himself with his men on es
pecially important stories and organize
a working staff right on the spot."
Hines has had experience as reporter,
copy reader, and city editor, not only
on a big metropolitan paper, but also on
a small city daily. He became a reporter
on the San Jose Times in 1906 and rose
on that paper to be city editor. After a
period as San Jose correspondent for the
San Francisco Examiner he joined the
local staff of the latter paper in 1917,
was later put on the copy desk, and in
1918 became night city editor, and within
a year, in March, 1919, he was made
city editor.
