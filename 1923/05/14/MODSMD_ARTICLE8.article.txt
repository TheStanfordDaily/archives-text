# "AUTOMOBILE OUGHT TO BE ELIMINATED"-DEAN CULVER
## 
### 
Automobiles on the Stanford campus
may go the way of "tubbing" and the
faculty police system. The car received
another knock today when George Cul
ver, dean of men, expressed himself in
an interview as strongly favoring elimi
nation of student-operated machines
from the University grounds.
"I wish someone would advance a good
argument why a freshman should bring
a four or five thousand dollar car on the
campus," Culver said. "The machine is
demoralizing and time-wasting. It brings
right next door bootlegging establish
ments as far away as twenty miles. As
in the establishment of the student police
and the controlling of the class fights,
the students themselves must prepare the
way for the elimination of machines. Of
all tendencies which act to destroy the
democracy of Stanford, the car is the
most potent now remaining.
"It is wonderful to realize that al
though we have approximately 2,600 stu
dents living on the campus, there is prac
tically no scandal," Culver continued,
when questioned about the moral worth
and strength of the Stanford man of the
present. "Whereas sensational news
papers can find material to play up in
many colleges of this country, you do
not see front-page stories about the men

and women here."
Culver is enthusiastic about the present
college generation at Stanford. "Prac
tically all men here are on the side of
decency, not passively, but constructively.
We get a weak fellow once in a while,
but very few of them ever last. In the
first place, the scholarship requirements
are such that the vicious or weak soaker
can't last long. Then the splendid en
vironment here is a pretty hard thing to
buck. The different groups can't acord
to tolerate any serious violations; the
weak man finds it hard going when he
tries to stand alone.
"If we told all we knew, there might
here and there be a good fellow sent
away from Stanford because of some
thoughtless act. But we don't work po
i lice methods; instead, an effort is made
; to straighten matters out for the weak
: man, so that he can fight it out. Wc
form a community of isolation in which
the spirit of co-operation maintains stan
dards of decency.
'"The student police, a voluntary stu
dent body organization, is a great thing,
j It is superior to any kind of control im
j posed by the University officials. And
! it works quietly and efficiently. It i«
| handled entirely by the students both is
to the selection of officials and their
duties.
"This condition is in striking contrast
to what it was in the old days here. It
was a regular habit of many men to go
down to Maylield and later to Menlo
and get 'tanked up.' The old faculty
committee didn't get along with the stu
dents. There was no co-operation; ill
feeling and spying was the usual thing,
with much distrust on both sides.
"Of their own accord the students of
this generation have taken over the po
licing that has to be done. They have
also regulated the hazing 'fights.' It is a
difficult thing to get out of the public
mind the idea that a dean of men is a
police officer or detective, whose chief
zest in life is the ability to 'hang some
thing on' students. There may be such
deans, but I am glad to say that I never
knew any of them and I like to feel that
I am fairly well acquainted with myself.
"I have never attended a meeting of
the Men's Council. This particular or
ganization has been a great facor in
bringing about the present friendly spirit
in the student body. Appreciation and
co-operation marks the spirit of the Ad
ministrative officers of the University
from the President on down the line.
"When I first accepted the position as
dean, an old friend connected with the
University greeted me with this bit of
encouragement: 'Well, I see you have put
your head in the noose.' I often smile
when I think of his salutation, recalling
the splendid experiences I have since had
with Stanford undergraduates."
