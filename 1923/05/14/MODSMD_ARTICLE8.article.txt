# "AUTOMOBILE OUGHT TO BE ELIMINATED"-DEAN CULVER

Automobiles on the Stanford campus
may go the way of "tubbing" and the
faculty police system. The car received
another knock today when George Cul
ver, dean of men, expressed himself in
an interview as strongly favoring elimi
nation of student-operated machines
from the University grounds.
"I wish someone would advance a good
argument why a freshman should bring
a four or five thousand dollar car on the
campus," Culver said. "The machine is
demoralizing and time-wasting. It brings
right next door bootlegging establish
ments as far away as twenty miles. As
in the establishment of the student police
and the controlling of the class fights,
the students themselves must prepare the
way for the elimination of machines. Of
all tendencies which act to destroy the
democracy of Stanford, the car is the
most potent now remaining.
"It is wonderful to realize that al
though we have approximately 2,600 stu
dents living on the campus, there is prac
tically no scandal," Culver continued,
when questioned about the moral worth
and strength of the Stanford man of the
present. "Whereas sensational news
papers can find material to play up in
many colleges of this country, you do
not see front-page stories about the men

and women here."
Culver is enthusiastic about the present
college generation at Stanford. "Prac
tically all men here are on the side of
decency, not passively, but constructively.
We get a weak fellow once in a while,
but very few of them ever last. In the
first place, the scholarship requirements
are such that the vicious or weak soaker
can't last long. Then the splendid en
vironment here is a pretty hard thing to
buck. The different groups can't acord
to tolerate any serious violations; the
weak man finds it hard going when he
tries to stand alone.
"If we told all we knew, there might
here and there be a good fellow sent
away from Stanford because of some
thoughtless act. But we don't work po
i lice methods; instead, an effort is made
; to straighten matters out for the weak
: man, so that he can fight it out. Wc
form a community of isolation in which
the spirit of co-operation maintains stan
dards of decency.

dent body organization, is a great thing,
