# Kappa Sigma House Slightly Damaged By Fire and Water
## 
### 
There were plenty of morals brought
out by the fire at the Kappa Sigma house
last Friday afternoon. The first was that
rats should not chew matches, and the
second was that the Palo Alto fire de
partment should be called only in case
of necessity, and then by a member of
the Stanford brigade.
The fire itself was interesting, but not
serious. Five hundred dollars will take
care of the damage, which is fully cov
ered by insurance. The alarm was turned
in from the Kappa Kappa Gamma house
at 2 .20, and the units from the Corpo
ration Yard and the military reserve re
sponded promptly. The crowd cheered
Fire Marshal Ed Lamb when the intrepid
chief climbed through a hole in the roof,
which was covered by swarms of indig
nant Kappa Sigs and sympathetic Betas.
Lamb was enthusiastic in his praise of
the co-operative spirit shown by the stu
dents. The fire was confined to a single
room in an upper wing of the house.
For a time the blaze seemed to be get
ting away from the fighters, and five
people rang up the Palo Alto department
and cried for help. The Paly truck
toured out and then toured back.
"Anybody who would do this would
take Nova Scotia for a comic opera,"
said Lamb, in discussing this with some
little vigor. "We co-operate with Palo
Alto and appreciate their response, but
the town was left unprotected for no
reason at all. We have eighteen men at
the yard, and twenty-one soldiers, and
if we need help we'll call for it If this
goes on we may call for it some time
and not get it. Palo Alto lias taken a
generous attitude, and students must not
abuse it."
The fire was thoroughly out at 2:40.
and Lamb covered all the floor space
with saw-dust to prevent damage by
water. The house was flooded, due to
the fact that the big chemical engine i
not vet in commission.
