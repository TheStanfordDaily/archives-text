MOTHER
was so happy because
I remembered her Sun
day with a box of Wil
son's instead of some
thing else. It gave her
an idea.
"Helen," she said, "you
have so many friends
that it seems almost
every day is somebody's
birthday. Why don't
you say it with Wil
son's"?
So that's exactly what
I'm doing now. Making
up a birthday list for
once and for all. Every
body likes candy!
