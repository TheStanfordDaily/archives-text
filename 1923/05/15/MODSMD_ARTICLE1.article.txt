# MRS. CROCKER TO ASSIST AT VARIED LABOR DAY PROGRAM
## Donor of $35,000 Gift Will Be Present For Laying Of Cornerstone Committees Are Perfecting Arrangements For Big Clean-Up Party 
### 
Labor Day, postponed until Wednes
day, May 23, will be doubly worth
while this year. Mrs. Henry J. Crocker,
donor of $35,000 for construction of a
new twenty-bed unit, will be present
to see the cornerstone laid, and this
ceremony is part of an attractive pro
gram.
The Labor Day tradition, now in its
fourth year, is almost the only un
selfish custom recognized at Stanford
under the name "tradition," and con
cerns ope of the few institutions cre
ated by Mrs. Stanford herself. The
new building made possible by Mrs.
Crocker will be dedicated to the mem
ory of Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin.
Plans so far call fpr the laying of
the cornerstone at 2 o'clock, with a
program under the direction of Dr.
Gardner. The work will be carried on
until 5:30, followed by the barbecue
and specialty acts. The committee
on entertainment has engaged a long
line of talent for the affair, with spe
cialties from the Junior Opera and by
various campus artists. Dinner will
not be served in the living groups
Wednesday evening.
Tools will be borrowed from the liv
ing groups, as in past years, and it is
requested that the lenders mark their
implements in order that they may be
returned without casualties. Newt
Brinkman, in charge of transportation,
announces that trucks will be sent to
carry all women to the grounds.
