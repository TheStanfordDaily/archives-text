"The Dutch East Indies are potentially
the greatest source of foreign trade in
the Far East for the United States," said
Dr. J. B. Hubrecht, secretary of the
legation of the Netherlands at Washing
ton, in an illustrated lecture this morn
ing before Professor Hears' Foreign
Trade class in Room 231 at 9 o'clock.
After pointing out the general condi
tion of the Dutch East Indies, Dr. Hu
brecht explained that the islands were
nearly self-governing, at least as far as
the local governments were concerned.
He showed the progress of education
among the natives, and indicated the
growth of agriculture in the Dutch col
onies.
"The islahd possessions are third in the
amount of sugar they export, raising
half as much as Cuba does and exporting
about 1,700,000 tons," stated Dr. Hu
brecht. "Other important crops are rice,
the most important; tobacco, tea, rubber,
and native foodstuffs. Twenty-five per
cent of the world's supply of rubber
comes from the Dutch Indies, and since
the United States consumes about 70
per cent of the world's supply, the Dutch
colonies and America have considerable
trade with a possibility of a material in
crease."
