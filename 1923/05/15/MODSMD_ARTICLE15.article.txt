# Porto Rico Is Of Commanding Interest Says Trade Expert
## 
### 
The people of Porto Rico have a§
knowledge of everything American as |
well as Spanish, and their great in- \
fluence with the countries of South!
America places them in a position to
establish for the forty-eight United
States extensive trade relations with
these countries. With their aid, the
United States can make rapid progress
along the path of mutual understand
ing between North and South America
which is so essential to the peace and
prosperity of this continent.
This is the belief of Clarence Fer
guson, trade expert on Porto Rico and j
a native Californian, who has been
visiting on the campus.
Study of Country Slighted
"Porto Rico, with her centuries-old
civilization, her progress in science,
art, and literature, cosmopolitan popu
lation, abundant hospitality, high type
of professional and business men, and
her many historical points of interest,
should be of commanding interest, to
every continental American," Fergu- 1
son contends. American people have
given little study to this interesting
part of the United States. "The his
toric features of this island, alone,
justify a much closer relationship, but
a far greater reason exists in the fact
that we are all a part of one great
commonwealth, founded upon humani
tarian principles."
Porto Rico is filled with talented
men, according to Ferguson. The men
of affairs are considerate and treat
with respect the views of others even
though these views may not always
accord with their own. "Porto Rico is
a country of education and culture
with a future bright with promise. It
is a country of proud people who co
operate toward those things for the
mutual benefit of all."
Has Made Rapid Progress
Porto Rico has broken all records
in progress, Ferguson declares. The
people have worked for the advance
ment of their island along the highest
' and most elevated planes. Most of the
progress has taken place within the
last twenty-four years. "Because the
| Porto Ricans have labored unceasing
ly with untiring energy, and have
taken advantage of every opportunity
offered them for improvement, they
j are entitled to unstinted praise."
The West Indian country is rich in
intellectual leadership, Ferguson main
tains. Porto Ricans have achieved
fame throughout the world. Many, who
have come to the United States, have
S risen rapidly to positions where public
attention was focused upon them be
cause of the brilliancy of their work.
Country Like Naples
Ferguson compares Porto Rico with
Naples. "It is a beautiful country, ris
ing like Naples gradually from the
water's edge into the hills thousands
of feet above the sea, giving unsur
passable scenic beauty and a wealth of
natural parks, playgrounds, and boule
vards.
"The spirit of the people of this
historic island is the spirit of the
great out-of-doors, pulsating with life
and vigor, thrilling with health and
splendor.
"Porto Rico, where Columbus landed j
in 1492, should be one of the most j
beloved spots in the entire United
States —a country in which we should
take particular pride. We should avail
ourselves of every opportunity to be
come better acquainted with Porto
Rico and our own citizens."
