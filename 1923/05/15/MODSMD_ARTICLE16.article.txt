Mr. Clarence Ferguson,
San Francisco, California.
Dear Mr. Ferguson: It was a
pleasure to me to learn of your great
interest in the Island of Porto Rico.
I have been interested for many years
in the development of this particular
part of the United States. I have had
the opportunity of meeting a number
of Porto Ricans. We have recently
had here at the University a brilliant
young Porto Rican woman, who is
preparing for further work in the
schools of her native country.
I trust that you will succeed in your
plan to give to those people in Amer
ica that you can reach a better idea
of the history, resources and people
of Porto Rico. It is inevitable that
this island will play an important part
in the development of our relations
to the countries to the south.
With kind personal-wishes, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
RAY LYMAN WILBUR.
President.
