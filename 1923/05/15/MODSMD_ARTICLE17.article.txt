# When Is a Fire Not A Fire? Comptroller Roth Will Instruct
## 
### 
We've gotta get the cart before the
horse here. Cometh now the cart, de
poseth himself, and says he done it.
Having secured partial immunity by
turning state's evidence on himself, he
makes a date with Ed Lamb and
leaves in haste.
Prologue to the big confession scene
staged this morning before a selected
audience was as follows: "The man
who turned in the alarm of fire at the
Alpha Phi house last night will report
to Comptroller Roth within forty
eight hours, or his entire fraternity
will appear before the Men's Council."
Now for the horse. Red flares in
front of the Alpha Phi house at 11
o'clock. Eddie Lamb and eight men
roaring up the Row filled with antici
pation. Wild excitement in every
house within eye-shot. Bathrobes,
hare feet, motley attire. Ed tells a
graphic story of terrified Alpha Phis
huddled on the stairway, appealing
for help. The mob cheers the fire
brigade, as well they might. "Good
practice for us," says Ed.
Sequel: Somebody granted third
degree.
