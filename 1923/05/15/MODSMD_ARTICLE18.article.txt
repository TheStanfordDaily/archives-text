# JOURNALIST GROUP TO BE ADDRESSED BY EXAMINER EDITOR
## Will M. Hines Will Describe Newspaper Experiences To Scribes 
### 
Will M. Hines, city editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, will speak before
an open meeting of the American Jour
nalists' Association tonight at 7:30 at
the home of Professor and Mrs. Everett
W. Smith, 12 Alvarado Row.
.Hines is considered the most experi
enced city editor on the Coast. His
fundamental characteristics are the abil
ity to pick men who are best adapted for
particular stories, and in determining
what constitutes news. He has been city
editor of the Examiner since 1919, and
has been on the staff of California news
papers since 1906. He is therefore thor
oughly familiar with work on the coast.
Hines will discuss newspaper work as
seen from the point pf view of a city
editor.
Hines has had experience as reporter,
copy reader, and city editor. He became
a reporter on the San Jose Times in 1906,
and rose on that paper to be city editor.
For some time he was the San Jose cor
respondent for the San Francisco Exam
iner, until he joined the local staff of
that paper, in 1917. Later, he was put
on the copy desk, and in 1918 became
night editor. In March, 1919, he took
over his duties as city editor.
Hines will speak informally tonight,
and the American Journalists' Associa
tion invites any one who iยง interested to
attend the meeting.
