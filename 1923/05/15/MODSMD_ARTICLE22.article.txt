# CARD TRACK TEAM LEAVES FOR CHICAGO ON JUNE 10th
## Templeton Will Not Select Athletes Until Time For Departure Final Examinations Will Not Interfere; Workout to Be Held Before Meet 
### 
Stanford's ten tracksters in the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
track and field meet in Chicago, June
15 and 16, will not he selected by Coach
"Dink" Templeton for at least two
weeks and probably not until just prior
to the time of leaving.
According to present plans, the team
will board the train for the East on Sun
day, June 10, arriving in Chicago in time
for a short workout before the meet
starts. In this way, the men will not
have the best chance of becoming accli
mated to the Chicago weather, but' with
the advantage of all-year-round training
the team should stand on a par with the
other contestants.
The possibility of sending the men East
at an earlier date is slight, since exami
nations and the final work of the quarter
would be interfered with. As it is, the
athletes may possibly be refused permis
sion to take their examinations prior to
leaving on June 10. In that case, they
will probably be required to take them
when they return to the campus after
June 22. There is a possibility also that
all except the seniors on the team will
postpone the examinations until next fall.
The seniors, however, will have to finish
their requirements before commencement
if they expect to graduate this year.
Chicago Meet Convenient
The Chicago meet was selected by the
Board of Athletic Control as the one
which would least interfere with the Uni
versity work and examinations. In spite
of the fact that it may conflict with the
regular schedule finals, it was considered
the most logical meet to enter.

California's athletes will enter the
I. C. A. A. A. A.and will have plenty of
time for practice on the Eastern tracks
because their college work will have been
completed before the start of the meet.
With most of the best California track
stars in the East, the Pacific Coast Con
ference contest would lack the interest
such a meet usually holds. The entries
of other colleges and universities have
been met before on the track, and while
there are a number of individual stars
among them, it has been thought best to
keep in contact with Eastern track per
formers and give the Stanford men the
stiffest competition conveniently available.
Varsity Has Been Practicing
The varsity men have been working
out ever since the Big Meet and have
been getting in some good practice. No
"meets or othfcr competition have been held
for the varsity runners, but they have
not pretended to keep on edge, merely
desiring to keep the kinks out of their
joints until a week or two before they
I start East.
Coach "Dink" has been working with
the men and has given them numerous
tips on the differences of Eastern run
ning and Eastern tracks. He is also try
ing to improve the style of running of
the men, not only for the coming meet
in Chicago, but for next season as well.
The men who have been doing work
meriting a trip East are: Campbell,
Tudah, Williamson, Dole, Swayne, Daly,
Elliott, Falk, Leistner, Black, Kcmnitzer,
and Arthur. The list of ten men to at
tend the national meet will probably be
I selected from this number, with a possi
bility of others working into a place by
good performances before and at the
time of the tryouts.
