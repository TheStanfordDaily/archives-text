# CARD TRACK TEAM LEAVES FOR CHICAGO ON JUNE 10th
## Templeton Will Not Select Athletes Until Time For Departure Final Examinations Will Not Interfere; Workout to Be Held Before Meet

Stanford's ten tracksters in the Na

track and field meet in Chicago, June
15 and 16, will not he selected by Coach
"Dink" Templeton for at least two
weeks and probably not until just prior
to the time of leaving.
According to present plans, the team
will board the train for the East on Sun
day, June 10, arriving in Chicago in time
for a short workout before the meet
starts. In this way, the men will not
have the best chance of becoming accli
mated to the Chicago weather, but' with
the advantage of all-year-round training
the team should stand on a par with the
other contestants.
The possibility of sending the men East
at an earlier date is slight, since exami
nations and the final work of the quarter
would be interfered with. As it is, the
athletes may possibly be refused permis

leaving on June 10. In that case, they
will probably be required to take them
when they return to the campus after
June 22. There is a possibility also that
all except the seniors on the team will
postpone the examinations until next fall.
The seniors, however, will have to finish
their requirements before commencement
if they expect to graduate this year.
