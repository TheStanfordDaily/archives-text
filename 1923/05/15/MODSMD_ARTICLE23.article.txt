# STANFORD RETAINS JUNIOR DIVE TITLE; LOSES 220 EVENT
## 
### 
Stanford was able to retain but one
of the two junior P. A. A. titles at stake
Saturday in connection with Junior Week
lake sports. Gibbons of Stanford won
the diving championship, but the 220-
yard title went to an outsider.
In the junior ten-foot springbroad divn
ing championship, Gibbons easily proved
that he must be given serious considera
tion for the varsity and for the senior
events next year. His dives were well
executed, and he hit the water cleanly.
Gibbon's showing was unexpected, inas
much as he has participated in but few
meets this year.
Thrash of the Olympic Club secured
second in the diving, beating out Smith,
the star freshman diver. Smith shows
great promise, and should come to the
fore with more experience.
The 220-yard championship swim, won
last year by Wooster of Stanford, was
carried off by Gillson of the Olympic
Club. Tn the absence of Langley, who
should have taken tlie title with ease, the
Olympic Clu+> swimmer had things in his
own hands. The time made, 2:49.3, while
not exceptionally fast, is considered good
for juniors. Lehman of Sacramento, and
Wright of Stanford finished second and
third, respectively.
One of the bright spots of the after
noon was the cross-lake swim, which was
won by O'Connor of Stanford. This
was the sensational race of the day.
Aided by a strong wind, the swimmers
negotiated the distance of about 500 yards
in 4:58.3. The race resolved itself into
a battle between Smith of the Olympic
Club, Pacific Coast 220-yard champion,
and O'Connor, 440-yard fitle holder.
O'Connor passed Smith in the last hun
dred yards, and won by a scant five feet.
Allen of Stanford finished third, beating
out Sell roth of the Olympic Club.
