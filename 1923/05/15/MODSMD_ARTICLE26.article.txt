# STUDENT LEADERS AND THE AUTOMOBILE
## 
### 
Just at a time when student leaders are gathering
facts and considering the advisability of recommend
ing to the administration that underclassmen should
not he permitted to own or operate automobiles 011
the campus a reporter of the Daily has indicated in
an interview that the movement began with the ad
ministration.
The question is one of long standing as the bound
files of this newspaper will indicate. The movement
has been revived by responsible men among the
Senior Class who see in- the new housing situation
the opportunity for the institution of a rule that has
long been contemplated.
The Seniors have already talked to the Class of
who will be the sophomores of next year. They
have found that class concurs heartily with the plan
as proposed.
It is not expected that the incoming freshmen will
object since they will live together in one dormitory
which is within easy walking distance of their class
rooms, the gymnasium, and the carline if they must
gp off the campus.
This is not the project of the administration. It
is. an upperclass program which is being seriously
considered and which has the unqualified backing
of the administration. The men who are interested
in its promulgation do not intend to force the issue
down the throats of the student body. Findings and
recommendations will be published and the issue
more clearly defined in the course of the coming
week. â€”H. J. 8., '22.
