# BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
The littke jokester who frightened a houseful of
Alpha Phi's and distracted the neighboring men and
women from their studies last night is probably
patting himself on the back for the success of his
venture. No vital damage was done unless the shock
to some twenty sorority women's nerves proves seri
ous, but neither was the stunt representative of the
best of collegiate ingenuity and intelligence.
It was a good workout for the campus tire depart
ment but that was obviously not the perpetrator's
object in surrounding the house with red flares. A
few more tricks like that and â€”but, everybody knows
about the lad who cried "Wolf!" too often.
The guilty one has confessed and apologized, how
ever. and the party is over this time.
