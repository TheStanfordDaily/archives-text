# Russia and Bolshevism
## 
### 
(Baron Boodburg was for over twenty years a member
of the Czar of Russia's general army staff. When the
Bolsheviks seized control he escapcd to the United States,
and has settled near the University, fie is, both from his
official relations to the Ccar for such a long period, and
from a careful study of Russia's needs, an authority on,
Russian problems. This is the first of a scries of interviews
on Russian affairs.)
War in which the forces of the Bolsheviks would be
destroyed by a foreign power and evolution by means of
which the present Bolshevik leaders wlil disappear are
the only two ways by which Russia may be freed from
the present tyrannical and devastating reign of the
Communists.
There seems to be no immediate hope for the down
fall of Bolshevism unless a foreign power should attack
Russia and in so doing destroy the Bolshevik army
which would disintegrate within two months if attacked.
Evolution, the only other way in which the present
Russian government may be destroyed, is a process
requiring many years and would involve the gradual
disappearance of the Bolshevik fanatics.
At present 110 one can destroy the Communists' power
because the Russian people have never been organized.
The people cannot get together and even if thy could
unit they would b helpless through lack of ammunition
and in face of the Communists' well-trained and faithful
hired soldiers. In addition to its great army of hired
soldiers who receive excellent wages and who are con
sequently devoted to the government, the Bolshevik
powrs have a great administration which spies upon the
people. The Extraordinary Executive Commission is a
very powerful institution which has kept the people in
iron hands.
All communications such as railroads and telegraph
lines are in the hands of the Bolsheviks, another fact
which prevents the possible union of the Russian people.
With its Red army, its government police and its control
of communications, the Bolshevik or Communist govern
ment has the country at its mercy.
One of the points commonly miscontrued by the Ameri
can people is the distinction between the Soviet and
Communist governments. The Communist government
consists of a small group or one-half per cent of the
whole Russian population that at present is governing
all the rest of the nation. It is the worst form of
despotism which ever existed because it contains not
one principle of self-government. Privileges of speech,
writing, assembly, and religion are all forbidden and he
who expresses an opinion opposing that held by the
government, quietly disappears. No opinion save that of
the Communists or Bolsheviks is permitted. The Com
munist party has 200,000 members who govern over one
hundred millions of people. This party is headed by a
group of men, many of whom are simply mad fanatics,
who grew up in the unhealthy atmosphere of immigrant
groups in other countries. Gathering in immigrant
groups in Paris and Geneva they formed the darkest
side of political life. In such conditions lived Lenine.
Lenine left Russia for twenty years and returned un
familiar with and ignorant of existing conditions .to take
over the government. Around such men as lie, gathered
the underworld, the dark side of Russian life. All the
dissatisfied thronged to the Communists' ranks, thinking
to find some easy way of living.
Worn out by war and political unrest, Russia grate
fully accepted and had faith in the promises of peace
and self-government which the Communists made her.
Under the principle of self-government the Bolsheviks
concealed their true motives and deceived the peasants.
Th Communist government has absolutely nothing to
do with self-government and socialism. For five years it
has destroyed all the political and religious life of
Russia.
Soviet Russia, 011 the other hand, is the Russia of the
peasant who seeks primarily for self-government in
economic life. The Russian peasant is very much of an
owner. He is not interested in high politics and world
affairs. He pays heavy taxes and he wants to see them
return in the form of improved schools and other public
benefits. The peasant demands tax regulations and eco
nomic life governed by their own elected counsels.
The outlook for Russia is black. In the meantime she
must be left alone. Russia must form without the help
of her refugists who cannot forgive or forget. She must
get 011 her feet without the interference of either her
refugists or other countries. Practically any form of
government would be better than Bolshevism. Anarchy
could not be worse than Bolshevism and undoubtedly
could organize the government in some way.

do with self-government and socialism. For five years it
has destroyed all the political and religious life of
Russia.
Soviet Russia, 011 the other hand, is the Russia of the
peasant who seeks primarily for self-government in
economic life. The Russian peasant is very much of an
owner. He is not interested in high politics and world
affairs. He pays heavy taxes and he wants to see them
return in the form of improved schools and other public
benefits. The peasant demands tax regulations and eco

The outlook for Russia is black. In the meantime she
must be left alone. Russia must form without the help
of her refugists who cannot forgive or forget. She must
get 011 her feet without the interference of either her
refugists or other countries. Practically any form of
government would be better than Bolshevism. Anarchy
could not be worse than Bolshevism and undoubtedly
could organize the government in some way.

War in which the forces of the Bolsheviks would be

fall of Bolshevism unless a foreign power should attack
Russia and in so doing destroy the Bolshevik army
which would disintegrate within two months if attacked.

because the Russian people have never been organized.
The people cannot get together and even if thy could
unit they would b helpless through lack of ammunition
and in face of the Communists' well-trained and faithful
hired soldiers. In addition to its great army of hired
soldiers who receive excellent wages and who are con

powrs have a great administration which spies upon the
people. The Extraordinary Executive Commission is a
very powerful institution which has kept the people in
