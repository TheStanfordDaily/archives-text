For the man who is lucky enough to
possess a ear ur a bug and who has the
wanderlust of Enoch Arden in his veins,
Stanford is a paradise enow. The campus
is threaded with rambling roads and for
the man who would truly go adventuring
there for innumerable auto trips that can
be taken in a day.
Perhaps the most popular road for
queeners is the La Honda road, by way
of which one can go to Half Moon Ray
if one is out for a day's jaunt. Another
favorite rpute for the man who wants a
spin between classes is the Woodsidc
Portola road, while for the speed demon
there always remains the highway. Over
the mountains to Santa Cruz and thence
on to the Big Basin, by way of Boulder
Creek, is perhaps the loveliest all-day
trip in this part of the country. For
imbibers of mineral waters, the road map
recommends the trip to Congress Springs,
where sulphur springs abound.
Those who aspire to reach the heights
and whose carburetors are in good run
ning order, attempt the sixty-mile trip
to the top of Black mountain, the high
est peak in this vicinity. For the poet
who craves wildness and solitude and is
not particular as to the smoothness of
the road, the twenty-five-mile jaunt
through Los Altos and thence to Stevens'
Creek is recommended. King's moun
tain is another place drawing its full
quota of picknickers.
In prehistoric days when wine flowed
red ,the Woodside Portola thronged with
travelers headed toward the Wunder, a
one-time popular old saloon, while the
Middlefield road leading to the old
winery was never deserted.
