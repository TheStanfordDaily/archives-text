# MEN OF GENIUS
## 
### 
How few men of genius there are! We
of the lesser sort look on in wonder at
their achievements; try to emulate—and
fail. J admire my friend Smith—if there
is anyone who can raise a "D" to a "B"
or a "B" to an "A", he is the one. He is
naturally talented. His "line," his "gift"
of gal)—call it what you will, never fails
him. With the male professors, he is
the honest and truly brilliant mind who,
due to accidents totally beyond his con
trol, was not able to write a good exam
paper, although he knew all the facts;
with the female assistants, he is the sweet,
lovable boy, who is, oh, so polite and
who ad vires that particular assistant, oh,
so much, Smith is remarkably success
ful. He can plead, persuade or terrorize
almost anyone into raising his grades—
what a man of genius to waste on mere
education!
There are indeed many types of genius.
My friend Jones possesses the brilliancy
of a Voltaire in getting dates. He meets
a Venus de Milo at 12:02 and at 12:07
he has her signed up for the next "strug

gle." His oratory is perfect; his powers
of persuasion so great that he could sell
ai pair of tortoise-shell rimmerl glasses
to a blind man. What genius! What
talent! We who are heavily content
with our Medicine or Law, look on with ,
envious eyes and wonder why we were
not made geniuses. But after all, 1
suppose someone must do the work of
the world.
