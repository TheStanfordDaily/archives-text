# Another Frisk This Friday; Go After It
## 
### 
Cap and Gown is at it againâ€”
giving a whole lot for just a little.
There will be another Friday Frisk
at the Women's Clubhouse this
week, with all the old fire and
vigor. An orchestra has been en
gaged to play dance music from
4:30' to 5:30 on Friday, and all those
possessed of campus clothes and 15
cents may report for duty. Friday
afternoon is a dull time anyhow,
and a few dances will make Friday
night arrive a lot sooner.
