While impressions of the Junior
Opera are yet fresh, we all should go
to San Francisco and see a profes
sional musical comedy in order to
fully appreciate the work of campus
musical shows. Can you tell us of a
musical comedy playing in San Fran
cisco this month where we can hear
music equal to that introduced in
"Fore"? Probably not. The clear melo
dy of "Gazing," the stirring refrain of
"I Got a Feeling" and the tantalizing
swing of "My Little Queen of Gasoline"
cannot be found in every well-reputed
musical comedy that visits the Pacific
Coast.

Robert Benchley, dramatic critic of
Life, takes occasion in the latest num-j
ber of the magazine to rail in no un
certain voice at the stupidity and bore
someness of "As You Like It." How
many of us would be relieved at such
denunciation of Shakespearean com
edy? Benchley says:

"The latest movement to establish
a national theater for the edification
of the American public suffered a set
back when, along about eleven o'clock,
it was discovered that a representative
gathering of the American public was
asleep. The blame lies partly on the
shoulders of the (quiet please!) Ameri
can National Theater, but chiefly on
the shoulders of that good English
man, William Shakespeare, who wrote
a very tedious comedy called 'As You
Like It.'
"Well, they did everything for "As
You Like It' that usually has to be
done for Shakespearean comedy to
make it even resemble a good play.
. . . We have no desire to flaunt a
juvenile iconoclasm or to shock our
former English teachers in this con
stant railing at Shakespearean comedy.
'As You Like It' is a very dull, un-

In spite of the way the Junior Opera
J was received, it was not quite what it
' might have been. "Little Brother Rob

"Fore," was missing when time came
to draw the curtain. This junior star,
i eight-year-old Chinese second-boy of
the Theta Delts, was the big hit of
the show in the dress rehearsals. But
the last time "Little Brother Robert"
went off without doing the dishes, and
i when he returned, his father led him
to the woodshed. So in spite of the
sincere pleas of cast members, the

Although twice charged with feeble- j
mindedness, A. D. Cohan still wears a
Mexican straw, some twenty-four
inches in diameter. He is director of
the Palo Alto section of the Peninsular
Pageant of Progress, to be given at
the San Carlos speedway probably on

strangers to take roles in the pageant, j
Almost anyone can take part, Cohan

Somehow we can't get over these
chorus numbers in the Opera. They
were the best-trained, and the peppiest
chorus that has stepped before the
campus spotlight for some little time.!
And the credit goes to but one per

see that she had a place in the train

she is still available. A word to the
