# Campus Gasoline Supply Follows Economic Laws
## 
### 
"The supply tends to rise to the de
mand." So said an econ professor
recently. "The demand if persistent will
produce the supply." During the year
of 1922 automobiles in the United States
consumed more than 5,300,000,000 gal
lons of gasoline. How much of this
total was used up by college students, sta
tistics fail to reveal. A few weeks ago
the University purchased a gasoline sta
tion, which has now been set up next to
the fire house, and is to be put into op
eration in a few days. The professor
probably spoke the truth.
