# COFFEE AFFECTS CAR SALES IN VENEZUELA
## 
### 
The number of coffee-drinkers in the
United States has a direct effect upon the
number of automobiles sold in Ven
ezuela, according to John O. Sanders,
U. S. Consul at Maracaibo. The climatic
conditions have practically no effect on
the sales of motor cars in the South
American country, as the weather is of
cdmost uniform temperature the year
round. Just before the coffee harvests
in December, January, and February,
and in July and August, money is the
"easiest," and the largest number of
sales are made in these months. The
success of coffee sales in the previous
season determines the number of auto
mobiles purchased.
