# Babes Won't Make Trip
## 
### 
No freshmen will take the trip, since
their entrance in the competition would
not count in the Stanford point column
for varsity runners. .Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton and Manager Sam Applewhite will
make the trip with the ten men.
Comparative statistics showing Stan
ford's chances to win the meet are un
available, since the Eastern teams are
just starting their outdoor track seasons
and have been hampered during the past
two weeks by snow and rain.
