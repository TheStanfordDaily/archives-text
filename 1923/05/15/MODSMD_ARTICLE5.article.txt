The University of California may
claim all the football honors in
sight and Stanford supporters can
sit back and say, "Wait until next

our humorists, loyal Redshirts have
an urgent desire to dig up the
Campanile and lay it flat along the
Row to keep us dry when it rains.
Tom Irwin, ex-editor of this sheet
who coughs steadily for Hammer
and Coffin, had his name printed
over an editorial in Judge's collegi
ate issue last week. The linotyper
from the depths of his ignorance
credited Tom with "University of
California." Why shouldn't we be
insulted?
