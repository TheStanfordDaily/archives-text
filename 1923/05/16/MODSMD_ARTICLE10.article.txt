I
Lewis stated that the constitution is
flexible enough to meet new condi
j tions, but that the basic principles still
remain. According to him it has stood
j the test of time better than any politi
cal institution of the modern 'era. He
showed that one of the fundamental
! ideas, freedom of speech, is in a large
; way being ignored. "Repression," stat
| ed Lewis, "will never stamp out any
| idea."
Constitution Discussed
The various speakers pointed out
| that the constitution is organized in
defense of individual rights, which is
the reason of its stability. The nation's
growth under this institution, and con
stitutional development by amend
ments and judiciary acts were also
emphasized.
Professor E. Robinson presided. The
four judges were Professor R. Lutz,
Professor R. M. Alden, Dean Mary
Yost, and the Rev. W. B. Thorp of j
Palo Alto.
