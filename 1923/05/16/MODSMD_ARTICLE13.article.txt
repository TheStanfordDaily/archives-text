## Journalists Learn Means of Organization in Large Newspaper Office 
### 
"The job of a city editor is really
simple," said Will M. Hines, city edi
tor of the San Francisco Examiner, in
an address before a meeting of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Journalists Association held at 7:30
last evening at the home of Professor
and Mrs. Everett W. Smith.
"You are always on the job; some
what the goat of those higher up and
cursed by those below," Hines con
tinued. He went on to define and ex
plain what are the duties and responsi
bilities of a city editor, and gave a
summary of any day's work, showing
the part played in the routine by the
assistant city editor and the reporters.
Hines showed a regular schedule, the
one covering the issue of this morn
ing's Examiner.
Must Decide What Is News
He explained that one of the big
problems of a city editor is to decide
what constitutes news. Hines gave as
his definition of what is news, "What
happened to the other fellow, but
what might have happened to you."
He stressed the element of personal
interest in regard to the news printed.
He illustrated his idea of a paper by
comparing it with a dpartment store,
with the first page as its show win
dows.
"The difference between page one
and inside stuff is determined wholly
by the amount of interest the story
will create in the readers' mind and
by how many will read it. The hardest
job of a city editor, however," he went
on, "is not in determining what is the
news but in picking the men who can
get the stories, on whom you can de
pend absolutely, and in keeping them
where you want them afterwards.
Each Day Is Complete
"You can't carry your worries over
from one day to the next," he said.
"Each day must be complete in itself."
He went on to show how the little
annoyances of thu day are forgotten in
the intense competition, goodfellow
ship, and comeradeship of the news
paper life. The rivalry and interest
I in big stories he compared to a foot
ball game, in that a man doesn't know
exactly for whom or for what he is
fighting.
Hines then proceeded to discuss the
difficulties of breaking into newspaper
work. He explained that there are
three or four years of grind which
have to begone through, and that this
is the fact which many college men
overlook. "Although they are a hun
dred per cent better equipped for their
work with a college education, they
still must go through the mill," Hines
said. He believes that the object of
education for a reporter is to open his
| eyes to life as it is, and not to give
1 him a lot of mental censorships and
j limitations.
Women Make Good
! Hines wound up his talk by quoting
j from a talk by Frank W. Carson of
j the Chicago Herald and Examiner, in
I which he described the sudden rise
of the woman reporter during the war
as "one of the romances of the pro
fession," and which he also stated that,
"nearly all city editors from time im
memorial have recognized the indis
| pensibility of the cub reporter. They
realize that, in the development of
the cub alone depended their future
! as newspaper editorial executives."
Hines also gave as his summary that
given by Carson, "If you will simply
i observe well .listen hard, write sim
! ply, don't speak out of your turn, study
hard, and don't think you know it all,
there is no question but that you can
and will succeed in the fourth estate."
Has Charge of Correspondents
Hines has been in active newspaper
work here iri California for seventeen
; years, and has had varied experience,
j Since 1919 he has been the city editor
of the San Francisco Examiner. He
has charge of all the Examiner corre
spondents in California.
Ernest Hopkins, also of the Exam
iner staff, who accompanied Hines,
: said of him that he was one of the few
men in the country who will leave
j their desks to go on a story with their
men, as did Hines in such big affairs
as the Hightower case and the Argo
: naut mine disaster, both of which he
S covered personally at the climax.
