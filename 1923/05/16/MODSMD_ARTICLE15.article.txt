nounced unofficially by C. W. Davis, di
rector of intramural sports, this morn- j
ing. It is possible, according to Davis,
that athletes from some of the other
teams may have as many points as the

With two events left, the javeline and
half-mile, it is possible that some men
down the list may be able to gain enough
points to win the gold medal.
The preliminaries in the relay will be
held at 4 this afternoon. Sixteen teams
had entered at noon, and it is expected
that four more teams will enter at the
time of the race, so that five hctts of
four teams each can be run. The teams

winning first in the heats will qualify
and will run Friday for the plaque,
which is given the winning team. Some
of the fastest relay teams entered arc
Delta Upsilon, Sigma Nu, Delta Chi, Phi
Kappa Psi, and Sigma Chi. The fastest
race of the day promises to be in the
heat in which Delta Chi and Delta Up
silon are entered. Both of these teams
did well in the 100-yard dash on Mon
day, which shows that they have plenty
of sprint material for the eight-man
mile relay.

half-mile run and javelin throw. Per
fect in the javelin is 200 feet and any
man throwing the spear 81 feet can count
