# Dr. Jordan's Book Is Best Of Century: Times Critic
## 
### 
"The greatest autobiography that has
been published in America in a hundred
years," is the way Nathan Haskell Dole
describes Dr. Jordan's "The Days of a
Man" in a book review in last week's
New York Times.
Dole also says,"It is admirably illus
trated; it is written in clear and limpid
English; it is never dull." He then goes
on,"It were devoutly to be wished that
it may have a wide reading, for its
whole atmosphere, if one may use such
a term, is distinctly humane, generous,
modest, optimistic, helpful, and noble."
