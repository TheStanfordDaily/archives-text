# Harker School Students Give Circus in Palo Alto
## 
### 
Children at the Stanford Convalescent
Home for Children will receive a check
for $150 in the near future as the result
of a circus benefit given by Miss
Harker's School last Saturday in
Palo Alto. This was the first affair of
its kind for the convalescent children,
and its success will probably lead to ad
ditional such parties in the future. The
admission was a nominal fee, so that the
total receipts represents a larger atten
dance than might otherwise be judged.
Children from all over the peninsula
attended the circus, as well as those in
the immediate vicinity of Palo Alto. A
good many adults were present, also,
most of them with their own youngsters;
but the program arranged was attractive
to all of the spectators and the praise
received by the performers merited a
repetition of the affair at an early date.
The youth of the Convalescent Home
will also share the joys of the annual
Labor Daye fete of the University stu
dents. On Wednesday, May 23. all aft
ernoon classes will be dismissed so that
the students can work on the grounds
around the home. In the evening at the
close of the work day a large fire will
be built and the regular barbecue will
take place. While the children are not
directly concerned in the party, the pres
ence of the students will give occasion
for a holiday and party inside of the
l-fome as well as outside.
