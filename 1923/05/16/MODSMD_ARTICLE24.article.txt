Cornell University has just adopted a regulation
limiting the campaign expenses of candidates for
student offices. Pages of the Daily Texan and other
exchanges are covered with display advertising for
the. coming spring elections, with pictures, records,
and recommendations.
At Stanford, with election less than two weeks
distant, there is scarcely a word as to the qualifica
tions and aspirations of students for the various
offices to he filled for the coming year. Any cam
paigning that has been going on is more or less
clandestine and confined to the particular group
which boasts a logical or possible entry. As usual
there will be the last minute hurry and scurry to
find names, any names, to fill the ballot.
Certainly we would not care to go the extremes
evident at other universities. It is an admirable
thing that Stanford can keep her elections fairly
free from personalities, imitative political methods,
and child-playâ€”but isn't it just possible that the lack
of widespread interest in the choice of officers is a
significant commentary against the effectiveness of
the student government of which we seem to be so
proud ?
