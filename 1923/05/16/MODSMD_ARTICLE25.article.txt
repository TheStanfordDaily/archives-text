# SUPPRESSING THE EGO
## 
### 
tt is true that we may not always act on impulse.
To do so would often be both unwise and indiscreet.
For Society, unfeeling taskmaster, has drawn up a
code which we must all follow to a certain extent.
Were one not to heed some sections of the dictum
he would be vainglorious and foolish. Equally
senseless, on the other hand, is the making of a bible
out of a book of etiquette. Impulse would often
have us violate the rules. And we are impulsive.
But the lament comes from the fact that Society
is an incompetent and harsh law-maker, imposing
many conventions that are at once silly and useless.
The result: individuals have become efficient in their
ability to resist natural impulses, and proficient in
acting for the eyes of others. These cannot enjoy
a dance because everyone is supposed to be looking
at them; they will not talk like themselves because
they are afraid of being thought highbrow, or senti
mental ; they cannot do anything that their group
frowns upon because they fear what it will say.
Merely walking inhibitions, they are artificial, self
conscious, lies about themselves. Habitually un
happy, they have a vague feeling of cheating them
selves, or that they should act for others less, and
for themselves more. They pose. They are always
posing, doing trivial things designed to impress
others. They miss a train rather than lie'thought
undignified by running. Hardly a natural breath
<lo they draw because they are afraid of being either
noticed unfavorably, or not noticed at all. If they
ever find the courage to care less what others think
al>out them, life will reveal its unsuspected freedom.
