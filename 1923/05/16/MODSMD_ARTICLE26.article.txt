"Campus students are playing with fire," said Martial
Ed Clam to a Cabbages reporter yesterday."I care
not for the stars that shine; I've always like the night
air fine, but those poor goils looked like somebody had
busted into the pantry. I told them I'd nail somebody's
hide to the door, but they said it was too good a door.
Did you notice how quick we got there?"
* * *
What a tame and cleanly student body we have. When
the fire blazed up:
250' were just taking a shower. ,
439 were asleep.
15 were studying.
3 were using the telephone.
1 was out walking. Guess who placed the flares.
» * *
If it had been a real fire it would have been lots
more fun but not half so funny. What a language!
• • *
Oh. syllabus fee—
You always come
When I'm broke as can be,
Now ain't you dumb!
Oh, syllabus fee —
You know darned well
That you dominate me,
Now ain't life hell!
♦ * *
Oh, the busted, cancelled parties to the teeming, squirm
ing city—
And the countless thwarted drinks of lemonade;
And the works of Johnny Milton—sonnet, triolet and
ditty
We abstained, to get that blooming money paid.

delectable chocolate cake in her basket Saturday night.
Mrs. Eliza Jenkins fainted at the church bazaar yes
terday afternoon. A nice time was had by all.
