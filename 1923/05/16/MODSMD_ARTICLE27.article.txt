# SO SAYS SHE

Mcßride, Campus.)
Last week J. C. M. bewailed the fact that the con
versation of Stanford women had the consistency of
whipped cream and meringue. She stated that the more
fundamental details of life were seldom discussed and
that books of a really substantial nature were never
read.
Betty R., '24, suggests the reason why these supposed
conversations are of this frothy type:
"We are afraid of what people think. We have not
the courage of our convictions. These are the real rea
sons why we do not talk generally about the more
serious things of life. I insist on a position diametrically
opposite to that of J. C. M.
"Stanford women DO think but they are afraid to
speak frankly lest they bring down upon their heads the
epithet 'Highbrow.'
"Somebody has said that Highbrow is a 'term gener
ally applied by ignorant people to those whose finer
qualities they should seek to emulate.' But who of us
would voluntarily incur the appellation of Highbrow?
Art'yone in this category is not to be considered 'one of
the gang' or 'a good sport.' We ay have an inherent
aversion to such discrimination. As a result anyone with
tastes and aspirations higher than the Cosmopolitan,
Nita Naldi and violent stepping, carefully conceals such
proclivities.
"It is a peculiar paradox that we come to the Univer
sity to acquire a broader understanding and enjoyment
of life and yet are unwilling to reveal any mental acqui
sitions of the higher order. It's funny but it's true.
"And the most flower-faced and flour-faced ones of us
do entertain serious thoughts. Perhaps J. C. M. does not
realize that life is very like a mirror. One's own charac
ter draws out the like characteristics of one's associates.
She has found no congenial spirits because she herself
is over-zealous to criticize the rest of us.
"My friends indulge in long-continued chocolate sym
posiums. Many times we have discussed things in gen
eral until half past four in the morning.
"I insist that if you know how to tap the right spot,
you will find that every Stanford woman has a reserve
of worth-while ideas. It's all in knowing how to dis
cover them.
"If you are not sympathetic and willing to listen
quietly without injecting into their discourses at every
possible point what You Yourself Personally think, of
course you will never find out their better thoughts. It
must be admitted that we college women are horribly
self-centered. We utter mighty few sentences that do not
contain a first person.
"It is altogether fitting and proper to consider one's
self the focus of the universe but it is highly improper
to remind one's friends of the fact with a persistent
verbal Ego. A highly commendable course to add to the
Stanford curriculum would be one in 'Good Listening.'
'A Good Listener is a joy forever' chanted the Psalmist
with perfect justification.
"And while I have the floor may I state that popularity
which all of us covet admittedly or not, has its firmest
foundation upon the cornerstone of Good Listening. Man
is such a conceited creature that to ask a leading ques
tion and then allow him to meander on in the fields of
his pet ideas, is to enslave him forever!
"Men hate Highbrows cordially and sincerely. Even if
we won't own up, we are greatly influenced by what
they think. It simply will not do to spend a moonlit
evening discussing Josiali Royce or Aristophanes. A
little Romantic Astronomy is about the limit. A sunny
canoe is not conducive to dissertations upon the Origin
of Species or Coefficients of Linear Expansion.
"There is a time and place for everything and J. C. M.
must be abnormal if she demands ponderous conversa
tions continuously. It is infinitely better for one's
digestion to talk over campus society and personnel at
the table than to indulge in the gloomy speculations of
Nietzsche. Lasting friendships do not have their incep
tions in lexicographic oratory."
