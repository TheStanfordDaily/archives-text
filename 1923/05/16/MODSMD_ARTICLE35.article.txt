# THE 						HONOR SYSTEM AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: I am enclosing a clipping
taken from the May, 1923, number of the
Illinois Alumni News, which should be
of interest to your readers. I am adding
a few comments of my own.
This clipping awakens many memories
in me because in 1908, as a student at the
University of Illinois, I worked vigor
ously for increased student control. I
was so interested in the matter that I
sought membership, from my college, on
the Student Council, on the issue. I
was unversed in college political mat
ters and foolishly conceived that one
should run upon an issue. I was defeat
ed, if I remember correctly, by a ma
jority of three, and there was elected a
man. who, according to his classmates,
cheated on examinations whenever he
had the chance. He helped establish the
system cf student 'government which
sponsored the honor system. I wondered
then if student government meant to him
what it meant to me, but, under the en
thusiasm of a big idea, I thought that
even if the founders and first adminis
trators did not fully realize the obliga
tions involved in the undertaking future
generations of students would, but now,
in 1923, I lCarn that it has been a failure.
The students of more than a decade have
had a vicious training in social obliga
tions.
It is hard for me to give up the idea
that an honor system among students is
practical, but the incidents that 1 know
of with reference to its working here at
Stanford convince me that Stanford is
following in the footsteps of Illinois,
only she is moving much more rapidly.
The trouble is so obvious that any in
telligent student can put his linger upon
it. It will, however, take backbone as
well as intelligence to remedy it.
Let me add one further word. My
student days are fresh in mind, but my
point of view is now that of a teacher. I
have no interest in an honor system be
cause thereby an occasional student will
or will not be able to deceive me as to
his ability. It is not I who would suffer
by such deceit. My interest is in its
power to mold character, and my judg
ment is that that system is the best which
develops most the student's sense of
honor and responsibility. Honor and re
sponsibility, for honor alone is a worth
less virtue, serving no purpose but to
tickle one's vanity. It has been my for
tune to come into contact with three
honor systems; one has failed (Illinois) ;
one seems to lie making good (Texas) ;

and the third (Stanford) is in danger of
dying in its infancy. I hope something
may be done to rejuvenate the weakling.
Sincerely yours,
TRUMAN L. KELLEY.
Honor System Goes
"The honor system at Illinois is no
more. The university senate on April 3
voted out the system, following recom
mendations of the council of administra
tion and of the student honor commis
sions. The old proctor plan of examina
tions will be resumed.
"The council pointed out that when
the system was started it was "with the
expectations that the students would re
port violations, but experience seems to
have proved that not only have most of
the violations been reported by the fac
ulty, but that many guilty persons have
escaped altogether. It is also main
tained that the inexpert administration
of the system by the students has been
even more serious than was at first an
ticipated. There were many delays in
trials and reports, and the uncertainty
of the judgment of the students on the
commissions, honest and earnest as they
are, has left doubt in many minds as to
the accuracy of their findings. Another
difficulty has been the almost complete
impossibility of indoctrinating, within a
semester or two, 3,(XX) or more new stu
dents with the principles of the honor
system. Students come from many states
and countries, having widely varied
school and home conditions. Finally,
members of the council say they must
assume full responsibility for discipline,
as they have been charged with it by
the trustees. They must render an ac
count to parents and guardians and to
the larger public behind the university.
"The wholte'* matter was put to a vote
of the students February 23, and they
decided by a 10 to 1 majority that they
wanted to continue with the system, al
though the vote represented less than half
of the student population. Then the
honor commissions voted out the sys
tem by an 8 to 5 decision. Last-minute
attempt! by some of the students to sa!ve
the day-failed to delay final action.
"One father of five Illini writes in to
say that the trouble seems to lie in the
fact that many high school students who
come up to the university lack training
in honor. He thinks the university ought
to suggest the proper stepping stones
'which would in a manner ameliorate the
abruptness from the high school to the
university.'
"Another difficulty, is that students
won't 'squeal' on one another."

Let me add one further word. My
student days are fresh in mind, but my
point of view is now that of a teacher. I
have no interest in an honor system be
cause thereby an occasional student will
or will not be able to deceive me as to
his ability. It is not I who would suffer
by such deceit. My interest is in its
power to mold character, and my judg
ment is that that system is the best which
develops most the student's sense of
honor and responsibility. Honor and re
sponsibility, for honor alone is a worth
less virtue, serving no purpose but to
tickle one's vanity. It has been my for
tune to come into contact with three
honor systems; one has failed (Illinois) ;
one seems to lie making good (Texas) ;

and the third (Stanford) is in danger of
dying in its infancy. I hope something
may be done to rejuvenate the weakling.
Sincerely yours,

Honor System Goes
"The honor system at Illinois is no
more. The university senate on April 3
voted out the system, following recom
mendations of the council of administra
tion and of the student honor commis
sions. The old proctor plan of examina
tions will be resumed.
"The council pointed out that when
the system was started it was "with the
expectations that the students would re
port violations, but experience seems to
have proved that not only have most of
the violations been reported by the fac
ulty, but that many guilty persons have
escaped altogether. It is also main
tained that the inexpert administration
of the system by the students has been
even more serious than was at first an
ticipated. There were many delays in
trials and reports, and the uncertainty
of the judgment of the students on the
commissions, honest and earnest as they
are, has left doubt in many minds as to
the accuracy of their findings. Another
difficulty has been the almost complete
impossibility of indoctrinating, within a
semester or two, 3,(XX) or more new stu
dents with the principles of the honor
system. Students come from many states
and countries, having widely varied
school and home conditions. Finally,
members of the council say they must
assume full responsibility for discipline,
as they have been charged with it by
the trustees. They must render an ac
count to parents and guardians and to
the larger public behind the university.
"The wholte'* matter was put to a vote
of the students February 23, and they
decided by a 10 to 1 majority that they
wanted to continue with the system, al
though the vote represented less than half
of the student population. Then the
honor commissions voted out the sys
tem by an 8 to 5 decision. Last-minute
attempt! by some of the students to sa!ve
the day-failed to delay final action.
"One father of five Illini writes in to
say that the trouble seems to lie in the
fact that many high school students who
come up to the university lack training
in honor. He thinks the university ought
to suggest the proper stepping stones
'which would in a manner ameliorate the
abruptness from the high school to the
university.'
"Another difficulty, is that students
won't 'squeal' on one another."

Dear Sir: I am enclosing a clipping
taken from the May, 1923, number of the
Illinois Alumni News, which should be
of interest to your readers. I am adding
a few comments of my own.
This clipping awakens many memories
in me because in 1908, as a student at the
University of Illinois, I worked vigor
ously for increased student control. I
was so interested in the matter that I
sought membership, from my college, on
the Student Council, on the issue. I
was unversed in college political mat
ters and foolishly conceived that one
should run upon an issue. I was defeat
ed, if I remember correctly, by a ma
jority of three, and there was elected a
man. who, according to his classmates,
cheated on examinations whenever he
had the chance. He helped establish the
system cf student 'government which
sponsored the honor system. I wondered
then if student government meant to him
what it meant to me, but, under the en
thusiasm of a big idea, I thought that
even if the founders and first adminis
trators did not fully realize the obliga
tions involved in the undertaking future
generations of students would, but now,
in 1923, I lCarn that it has been a failure.
The students of more than a decade have
had a vicious training in social obliga
tions.
It is hard for me to give up the idea
that an honor system among students is
practical, but the incidents that 1 know
of with reference to its working here at
Stanford convince me that Stanford is
following in the footsteps of Illinois,
only she is moving much more rapidly.
The trouble is so obvious that any in
telligent student can put his linger upon
it. It will, however, take backbone as
well as intelligence to remedy it.

commissions, honest and earnest as they
are, has left doubt in many minds as to
the accuracy of their findings. Another
difficulty has been the almost complete
impossibility of indoctrinating, within a
semester or two, 3,(XX) or more new stu
dents with the principles of the honor
system. Students come from many states
and countries, having widely varied
school and home conditions. Finally,
members of the council say they must
assume full responsibility for discipline,
as they have been charged with it by
the trustees. They must render an ac
count to parents and guardians and to
the larger public behind the university.
"The wholte'* matter was put to a vote
of the students February 23, and they
decided by a 10 to 1 majority that they
wanted to continue with the system, al
though the vote represented less than half
of the student population. Then the
honor commissions voted out the sys
tem by an 8 to 5 decision. Last-minute
attempt! by some of the students to sa!ve
the day-failed to delay final action.
"One father of five Illini writes in to
say that the trouble seems to lie in the
fact that many high school students who
come up to the university lack training
in honor. He thinks the university ought
to suggest the proper stepping stones
'which would in a manner ameliorate the
abruptness from the high school to the
university.'
"Another difficulty, is that students
won't 'squeal' on one another."

Dear Sir: I am enclosing a clipping
taken from the May, 1923, number of the
Illinois Alumni News, which should be
of interest to your readers. I am adding
a few comments of my own.
This clipping awakens many memories
in me because in 1908, as a student at the
University of Illinois, I worked vigor
ously for increased student control. I
was so interested in the matter that I
sought membership, from my college, on
the Student Council, on the issue. I
was unversed in college political mat
ters and foolishly conceived that one
should run upon an issue. I was defeat
ed, if I remember correctly, by a ma
jority of three, and there was elected a
man. who, according to his classmates,
cheated on examinations whenever he
had the chance. He helped establish the
system cf student 'government which
sponsored the honor system. I wondered
then if student government meant to him
what it meant to me, but, under the en
thusiasm of a big idea, I thought that
even if the founders and first adminis
trators did not fully realize the obliga
tions involved in the undertaking future
generations of students would, but now,
in 1923, I lCarn that it has been a failure.
The students of more than a decade have
had a vicious training in social obliga
tions.
It is hard for me to give up the idea
that an honor system among students is
practical, but the incidents that 1 know
of with reference to its working here at
Stanford convince me that Stanford is
following in the footsteps of Illinois,
only she is moving much more rapidly.
The trouble is so obvious that any in
telligent student can put his linger upon
it. It will, however, take backbone as
well as intelligence to remedy it.
Let me add one further word. My
student days are fresh in mind, but my
point of view is now that of a teacher. I
have no interest in an honor system be
cause thereby an occasional student will
or will not be able to deceive me as to
his ability. It is not I who would suffer
by such deceit. My interest is in its
power to mold character, and my judg
ment is that that system is the best which
develops most the student's sense of
honor and responsibility. Honor and re
sponsibility, for honor alone is a worth
less virtue, serving no purpose but to
tickle one's vanity. It has been my for
tune to come into contact with three
honor systems; one has failed (Illinois) ;
one seems to lie making good (Texas) ;

and the third (Stanford) is in danger of
dying in its infancy. I hope something
may be done to rejuvenate the weakling.
Sincerely yours,
TRUMAN L. KELLEY.
Honor System Goes
"The honor system at Illinois is no
more. The university senate on April 3
voted out the system, following recom
mendations of the council of administra
tion and of the student honor commis
sions. The old proctor plan of examina
tions will be resumed.
"The council pointed out that when
the system was started it was "with the
expectations that the students would re
port violations, but experience seems to
have proved that not only have most of
the violations been reported by the fac
ulty, but that many guilty persons have
escaped altogether. It is also main
tained that the inexpert administration
of the system by the students has been
even more serious than was at first an
ticipated. There were many delays in
trials and reports, and the uncertainty
of the judgment of the students on the
commissions, honest and earnest as they
are, has left doubt in many minds as to
