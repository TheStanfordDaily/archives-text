recently in the program of the Empire
Theater in Calcutta, where Davis was
playing.
Davis is with the T. Daniel Frawley
Company, which has been playing in
most of the larger Asiatic ports during
the past year. He has served in the
capacity of assistant director and
stage manager for the company, as
well as acting in most of the produc
tions.
Seib Is in "Movies"
With Davis is Lester Seib, '22, who
is said to be making a decided success
on the professional stage. During his
undergraduate days at Stanford Seib
was a favorite of campus audiences,
and besides acting he also directed
several campus productions. In addi
tion to his work on the legitimate
stage, Seib has been taking one of the
principal roles in a motion picture
which is being produced by the Fraw
ley company in the Orient. Seib's pic
tures have made good with the New
York office of the producing company
and he has been offered a contract to
act in motion pictures when he returns
to this country.
The interview which appeared in the
program of the Empire theater in Cal
cutta is as follows:
Davis Gives Interview
"Several years ago Gordon Davis
left the stage with 'the determination
never to return, and, to the amazement
of his friends and theatrical managers,
he betook himself to the gates of one
of the greatest universities of Amer
ica and applied for admission. Fortun
ately for him, his early education had
equipped him with the necessary pre
requisites, and the actor entered Stan
ford University as a member of the
freshman class.
" 'Luckily I was still only a lad of
twenty-one,' Mr. Davis says, 'and I
exulted in losing ray old Identity
among other students of the same age.
No one couM guess that for five years
I had been earning a livelihood before
the footligths. Of course I had weak
moments when attractive offers came
in from the outside world, but I man
aged to hold fast to my resolution!'
Wrote One-Act* Plays
"Writing for the stage became his
dramatic outlet, and several one-act
plays were so successful on the vaude
ville stage that he was commissioned
by one of America's popular stars to
write a full play for her. The war and
military service interrupted all this,
but after nearly two years Davis was
again back at Stanford, where he ob
tained his degree a year later. The
University then appointed him a mem
ber of the faculty, and he became the
director and producer of the college
amateur plays.
" 'Do I intend to return permanently
to the professional stage? Emphatic
ally. no! This is an exception, for I
regard this company as offering ad
vantages in the way of experience and
training absolutely unique and superior
to any other that I know of. The finish
of this tour and my year's leave of
absence from the University will find
me back directing the wonderful ama
teur spirit at Stanford.'
" 'How do you enjoy your responsi
bilities as stage manager of the Fraw
ley company?'
"With a rueful smile Davis pointed
to his temples. 'Look closely, and you
will see my first grey hairs. Some day

I am going to write a book on "Stage
Hands I Have Known." There will be
sections devoted to the Hawaiian,!
Chinese, Japanese, Philippine, Malay,
and Indian species. I haven't decided
whether it .will be a comedy or a
tragedy'."
