# LITTLE WORK AND PLENTY OF FUN-THAT'S LABOR DAY
## Committees on Work and Play To Arrange Program Soon; Half Holiday to Be Given 
### Bill Wright, '25 
This is just a rumbling preceding the
storm. Next Wednehday, May 23, is the
date of the annual Labor Day at the
grounds of the Children's Convalescent
Home—the biggest affair of the Junior
Week-Final Ex period. This story will
give a few backgrounds and predictions
concerning the event, leaving the actual
facts until the committees on food, drink,
entertainment, finance, and toil have
made their last changc in arrangements.
A long time after the death of the
Stanfords, their old home on San Fran
cisquito Creek was turned into a home
lor convalescent children rescued from
the hospitals in San Francisco. It is the i
one thing on the campus closely associ
ated with Mrs. Stanford. Three years
ago someone had the bright idea of start
ing an unselfish tradition—one which
benefited, instead of confined. So they i
(or he, or she) collected a gang of al
truistic hustlers and went over there to
clean things up.
Society is more complex now, and i
Labor Day is an immense affair. Sam
McDonald throws a barbecue, campus
dramatic talent makes the welkin ring, i
the band splits all the echoes in sight !
(thus getting out of working), trucks!
are sent to save the Five Hundred a!
walk, and the children gaze on skeptically j
and untiringly get under foot. The men |
handle axes, shovels, picks, and treee- J
trunks while the women invade the rose
garden with scissors, peroxide, and
court-plaster. There are no classes, no j
meals at living groups, and everybody |
has a good time.
The committees will release a com- j
plete menu and program early next
week.
