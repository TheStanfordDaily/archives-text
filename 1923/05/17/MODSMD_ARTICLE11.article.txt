## McKay, Marble and David Named for Editorship; Noland and Irwin Are Candidates for Manager 
### Ballotboxer 
Who's going to have the balance of political power around the Quadrangle, and
will those elected to responsible positions be capable of filling them ? These are
questions to be pondered before, not after, the elections on May 29.
Amateur Tammany bosses seem to be able to round up the local votes in a rather
efficient manner, but a victory for a certain faction is not always a vicotry for
student government. However, group action which presents the qualities of able
candidates is highly desirable. The freshman battle-cry of "let's get organised"
might be a good one to adopt.
It is an obvious fact that when the spring election time comes around many
people on the campus "don't know what it's all about." And because of this,
Ballotboxer it nil frequently offer pertinent information as impartially as possible.

The first burst of flame from the
1923 spring political volcano erupted
yesterday with the announcement of
the Quad Nomination Board, when the
candidates for editor and manager of
the 1925 year-book were chosen. Don
ald McKay heads the list of editorial
nominations, and John Irwin is the
leading candidate for manager.
The Nomination Board consists of
the following members: Charles B.
White, Carl Shoup, Philip Landis,
Maurine Voerge, and Neil Granger. At
their meeting yesterday afternoon,
which lasted for two hours, the capa
bilities of all the editorial and man
agerial tryoutees were thoroughly dis
cussed.
The decisions for first, second, and
third choice were made on the basis
of (1) amount of work put in during
the last three quarters; and (2) the
quality of that work. The managerial
system allows of a scoring on the point
system throughout the year, to deter
mine the relative merits of the try
outees.
The Nomination Board unanimously
voted in favor of recommending to the
Class of 1925 John Irwin as first
choice, and Harry Noland as second
choice, for manager of the 1925 Quad.
This decision was reached by means
of the point system of determining the
merits of each tryoutee. This system

has'proven quite successful during the
past years. The Nomination Board
recommends that each member of the
Class of '25 should carefully study the
report of points, and note the quali
fications of the two men in every de
partment.
Following is the point chart:

Noland's score on the managerial end
dropped off from the middle of January
till the last of February, due to illness
which handicapped him in active partici
pation.
