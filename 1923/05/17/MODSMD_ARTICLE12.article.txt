# ENCINA DINING HALLS ARE READY FOR FINAL TOUCHES
## 
### 
The Encina Dining Halls are rapidly
Hearing completion and but a few
weeks more will be needed to put on
the finishing touches. The tile roofing,
the outer plastering, and the placing of
the stone pillars in the arcades has
been completed. Workmen are now
laying the final colored cement paving
in the arcades and but a little more
remains to be done. Upstairs the win
dows are all in, and on the lower
floor the majority have been put into
place. Most of the French doors on
the inner courts have been hung and
the oak doors opening on the arcades
are ready to be adjusted.
Tile floors have been laid in three
of thft eight dining rooms and in all

but one, the final plastering has been
finished. In the storerooms, the great
ice-chests are ready for the final fin
ishing work and everything is ready
for the stoves in the kitchen. In one
of the dining rooms a bizarre stencil
pattern has been painted on the roof
beams and the panels of dark blue are
contrasted with the brown stain of
the rafters. The walls are of a rough
dark yellow plaster, with a four-foot
brown brick facing and the floors will
be of red tiles.
In the twenty-eight bedrooms on the
second floor, the windows and doors
are hung and the work finished ready
lor the painting. The main work is
now completed and all that remains is
to put the final touches to the rooms.
