# Barring of German Language Impractical, Says Miss Nye
## 
### 
"The short-sighted policy of barring
the German language from the secon
dary schools because of war hatred
has worked a hardship on those stu
dents whose line of work makes neces
sary, or at least desirable, a medium
to the German scientific books and
journals, literature, and music." This j
is the opinion of Miss Helena May
Nye, assistant in German, commenting
on the removal of elementary German
from high school curricula.
"The University has for several years
charged an additional fee for element
ary language work on the ground that
students should, as far as possible, se
cure this instruction in the secondary
schools. German has been exempt from
this fee because, during the war and 1
since, students could not get it in |
secondary schools. This year it is not j
exempt; and a significant number of
students here and elsewhere are'
spending time and money to acquire I
what should have been available to I
them in the high school."
Miss Nye believes that the effort to
have German restored to a place
among the other languages of the high
school curriculum might come more;
properly from these people who would !
prefer to use their valuable university !

yeans for other than elementary
language work.
"As for vengeance, the Germans are
paying; and as usual the innocent are
paying heaviest for the sins of the
guilty," Miss Nye continued. "If they
pay so far that the German intellec
tuals, scentists, and creative workers
of the middle-class are destined to ex
tinction, as some careful observers re
gard as not improbable, then will be
the time to consider theirs a dead
language. In the meantime, while it
has people speaking it, and valuable
knowledge written in it, it should have
its place with French, Spanish, and
Italian.
"It is a little worse than absurd for
us to perpetuate a war passion to the
point of keeping out of our schools a
language for which we have use. We
are an English-speaking people. Are
the patriotic politicians afraid that a
language which is spoken over a terri
tory only as large as our state of
Texas could corrupt our national
morals?"
"To know with what fierce intensity
each people defends its native tongue
is to realize that there could never be
any real danger of either Deutsch or
'Deutschland Ã¼ber alles.' The fears of
the politicians are only less worthy
than their hatreds," Miss Nye con
cluded.
