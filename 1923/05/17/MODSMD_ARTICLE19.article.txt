Kappa Sigma and Sigma Nu fur
nished the chief interest in the first

things all its own way throughout and
finished more than four seconds ahead

lead throughout most of its heat, los
ing for a short time when one of the
Theta Chi runners took the lead.
El Campo and Sigma Chi ran the
closest race of the day, although the
time was the slowest. Phi Delta Theta
took the lead at the start but both of
these teams soon passed the Phi Delts
and from then on the runners from
these two teams were neck and neck.
The last El Campo runner finished a
scant yard ahead, making his team
time 3:27 2-5. The Sigma Chi team
holds the record in this event with
3:17 2-5.
