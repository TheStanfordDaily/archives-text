# QUAYLE RETURNS FROM SOUTH SEAS VOYAGE
## Sickness Forces Abandonment of Bird-Hunting Trip 
### 
Ernest H. Quayle, ex-'2O, has just
returned to the campus after nearly
three years with the Whitney South
Sea Expedition sent out by the Ameri
can Museum of Natural History of
New York City. R. H. Beck, an orni-,
thologist of San Jose, and Quayle, in
the schooner France, which was pur
chased by the American Museum for
this expedition, visited more than:
forty islands of French Oceania col
lecting bird skins and eggs for the
museum. They included not only the
main islands but many far remote'
atolls and bird-nesting rocks.
Quayle was forced to abandon the j
expedition after becoming seriously ill
from fish poisoning. He has not yet'
fully recovered from this illness al-j
though he has been spending some
time in Tahiti in an endeavor to re- 1
gain his health.
In addition to the ornithological col
lecting work Quayle has been making
general scientific observations for the
museum and has sent back more than
four thousand manuscript pages of
notes covering a wide field of general
biology and other matters of interest. 1
He intends to re-enter Stanford in
the fall to complete his course, which
be abandoned in September, 1920, to
go on this trip. In the meantime he
plans to give lectures on the material
lie has gathered, illustrated by photo-,
graphs and lantern slides of the places
he has visited. He intends to remain
on the campus until commencement
time.
