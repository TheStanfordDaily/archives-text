# THE 						HORSE LAUGHS AGAIN
## 
### 
It is entertaining to watch the sporadic outbursts
of mutual condemnation springing up at Berkeley
between the collegiates and the iconoclasts —each
using the other's caustic weapons and each making
laughing stock of themselves before the rest of the
world.
The most recent evidence is the page of depreca
tion against Roy Chanslor, erstwhile editor of the
much-talked-of "Laughing Horse," which appears
in the comic section of the California Blue and Gold,
just off the presses. The exact purpose of the page,
with sentences cloaked in the very sentimentalized
idealism which Chanslor and his gang took delight
in attacking, is difficult to determine. If it is to quell
any more such outbursts as the "Laughing Horse,"
it will certainly fail through providing additional
material for attack. If it is to convince the public
that Chanslor's methods are not representative of
the best that the university produces, it fails through
adopting the same sort of attitude, minus the saving
grace of wit.
During the whole business the University of Cali
fornia has functioned much as in the past, with
regents and students unmolested, and Chanslor is at
present enjoying life in Paris, where he will prob
ably not hear of the latest attempted insult, which,
if he did, would do no more than give him an oppor
tunity for a horse laugh more genuine than many of
his former cachinations.
And at Stanford we can sit back smilingly and
watch the performance, giving thanks that what lit
tle of that sort of thing there is here is free from the
bitterness evidenced by Chanslor and his enemies
and kept from the scornful laughter of the public.

Logan Pearsall Smith was talking about that sort
of thing when he wrote his enjoyable little essay on
"Bogeys."
"I remember how charmed 1 was with these new
acquaintances, to whose house I had been taken that
afternoon to call. I remember the gardens through
which we sauntered, with peaches ripening on the
sunny walls; I remember the mellow light on the old
jx)rtraits in the drawing room, the friendly atmos
phere and tranquil voices; and how, as the quiet
stream of talk flowed on, one subject after another
was pleasantly mirrored on its surface —till, at a
chance remark, there was a sudden change and dark
ening, an angry swirl, as if a monster were raising
its head above the waters.
"What was it about, the dreadful disputation into
which we were plunged, in spite of desperate efforts
to clutch at other subjects? Was it Tariff Reform
or Table-rapping—Bacon and Shakespeare, Dis
establishment, perhaps—or Anti-Vivisection? What
did any of us know or really care about it? What
force, what fury drove us into saying the stupid,
intolerant, denunciatory things we said; that made
us feel we would rather die than not say them? How
could a group of humane, jwlite and intelligent peo
ple be so suddenly transformed into barking animals?
"Why do we let these Abstractions and implacable
Dogmatisms take possession of us, glare at each
other through our eyes, and fight their frenzied con
flicts in our persons? Life without the rancours and
ever-recurring battles of these Bogeys might be so
simple, friendly, affectionate and pleasant!"

And that is 110 argument against attempting to
change things which we conscientiously feci to be
wrong as long as that feeling is not contaminated by
smugness.
