and have him believe you.
To get an A on the 13th of the month.
To get an A any day of the month.
To have a laundry agent who suffers from amnesia.

IT IS UNLUCKY—

rouge.

SYLLABALLAD
I've paid my fee; and not for me
Are luxuries, I trow.
The student pays in ninety ways—
I'm syllabusted now.
From morn till night I'm eating light;
I can't afford to smoke;
I must call again on Uncle Ben
Because I'm syllabroke.

SONG OF THE VENTURER
Have you felt the call of the desolate snows
Where the white wolf mocks the stars;
Where the bull seal bellows across the floes
'Neath the flaming aurora's bars?
Have you mushed on the crust of the frozen trail
To pan where the nuggets lie?
Have you beaten your way thru the Arctic gale?
You haven't? Well, neither have I.
I yearn to go down to the sea in ships,
To follow the racing tide,
And sniff of the foamy brine that drips
From the bounding clipper's side.
I want to be cleansed by the tropical rain
That scuds in the trade wind's track;
I must go down to the sea again—
And then I'll come right back. r
The East is calling for me to come
Where scented zephyrs croon;
Where the jungle throbs to a distant drum
By the mists of a dank lagoon.
I know that a maid with eyes of light
Waits by the red reef's foam;
The East is calling to me tonight—
But I'd rather stay right at home.
* * *
With Junior Week over, ambitious women will try to
continue the excitement by becoming engaged. Impres
sionable freshmen are advised to remain within doors.

To follow the racing tide,
And sniff of the foamy brine that drips
From the bounding clipper's side.
I want to be cleansed by the tropical rain
That scuds in the trade wind's track;
I must go down to the sea again—
And then I'll come right back. r
The East is calling for me to come
Where scented zephyrs croon;
Where the jungle throbs to a distant drum
By the mists of a dank lagoon.
I know that a maid with eyes of light
Waits by the red reef's foam;
The East is calling to me tonight—
But I'd rather stay right at home.

IT IS LUCKY—
To tell the traffic cop that you were only doing twenty,
and have him believe you.
To get an A on the 13th of the month.
To get an A any day of the month.
To have a laundry agent who suffers from amnesia.
To carry the left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit
caught in the dark of the moon jumping over a mur
derer's grave if you suffer from chronic chicken-pox.
To walk under* a ladder and pick up a $5 bill.
IT IS UNLUCKY—
To pick up a horseshoe if the horse is attached.
To kick a mounted policeman.
To tell your O. A. O. that she needs another touch of
rouge.
To bet on the theory that a straight beats a flush.
To have your history corrector as a rival in love.
To blow open an envelope from home and only find
a letter.
To break a wishbone if it is your own personal one.
To steal a kiss and forget to return it.
To fill a three-card straight when it is your deal.

SONG OF THE VENTURER
Have you felt the call of the desolate snows
Where the white wolf mocks the stars;
Where the bull seal bellows across the floes
'Neath the flaming aurora's bars?
Have you mushed on the crust of the frozen trail
To pan where the nuggets lie?
Have you beaten your way thru the Arctic gale?
You haven't? Well, neither have I.
I yearn to go down to the sea in ships,
To follow the racing tide,
And sniff of the foamy brine that drips
From the bounding clipper's side.
I want to be cleansed by the tropical rain
That scuds in the trade wind's track;
I must go down to the sea again—
And then I'll come right back. r
