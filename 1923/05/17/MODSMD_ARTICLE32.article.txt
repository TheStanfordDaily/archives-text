# Best Joke of Chappy-Pelly Issue Found
## 
### 
The best joke of the recent Chapar
ral-Pellcan issue was 011 the publishers
of said comic magazine and has been
kept a dark secret until recently. It
was discovered the other day when
a thoughtful student attempted to mail
a copy of this issue to his family in the
East. As usual he placed a two-cent
stamp 011 the magazine and placed it
in the proper receptacle. He was some
j what surprised to have it returned for
more postage the next day but, after
| adding another two-cent stamp, sent
the comic on its way again.
His surprise was somewhat greater
when the recalcitrant magazine re
turned once more for the same reason.
Again he added a two cent stamp and
! carefully placed it in the box labeled
packages. Again he was pleasantly sur
prised by the return of the refractory
\ missive.
This time the puzzled student sought
| out the postmistress for an explana
: tion of the phenomena. This official
1 informed him that the Chaparral-Peli
can was not a magazine in the eyes
!of the postoffice as no such publica
j tion was registered as second class
matter. Each copy of this issue, there-
must be sent as first class matter
I or as a parcel post package. Reluc
tantly the doubtful student paid twelve
cents postage on his parcel post pack
age.
It is rumored that Hammer and
Coffin paid the postoffice about eighty
dollars to distribute its packages in
stead of the customary four or five
dollars.
