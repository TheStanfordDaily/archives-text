# LIFTS RED LANTERN, AND BUYS $25 WORTH OF WOE

### 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY â€” Appro
priation of a red traffic lantern led to
a fine of $25 for a freshman here, when
returning home early Sunday morning
with a companion. The prospect of a
souvenir for his room probably over
came his ideas of the golden rule, and
he took the lamp just in time for an
officer to see and arrest him.
