This delicious medley is such a pronounced favorite with
Wilson's guests that they continually ask, "When will you offer
another Special Assortment?" So we're glad the time has
come.
Truly there is magic in this generous box, which, besides chocolates, includes
a profusion of delicious candies. There are walnut nougat rolls, Wlson's
toffee, rocky fords, wrapped chews, nut cuts, Turkish dream rolls, date nut
chews and Klondike nougats.
