# VACANCIES ON EX COMMITTEE ARE TO BE FILLED MAY 29
## Sophomores And Juniors to Choose Two Members at End-Year Election 
### Ballotboxer 
The hand that rocks the cradle may
control the world, but the hand that
casts a vote in the weekly meetings
of the Executive Committee spends
your money and decides the policies
which govern your campus activities.
Who are you going to entrust with
these responsibilities?
After glancing over the long array i
of power? which the Executive Com
mittee possesses, Ballotboxer weepß
when he hears the ancient cry—"You
support my mau for Ex. Committee,
and I'll help elect your man president." ,
Such an arrangement is not always
fortunate.
The present junior class will elect
one member and one woman member
to serve as senior representatives next
year. "Nip" McHose was elected in
February and will hold office until the
next mid-ierm election. The 1925 class
will choose the same number of repre
sentatives, and Norman Dole will hold
over until February. There will be no
1926 member on the Committee until
the mid-term election next year.
The Executive Committee is the
clearing-house for all student activi
ties, and is vested with nearly all the
legislative and executive powers of
event, but their lack of javelin throwers
proved their downfall.
The finals in the mile relay were held
this afternoon. The four teams win
ning their heats last Wednesday will
corrrete for a plaque. These teams are
Delta Upsilon, El Toro, Kappa Sigma,
and El Campo. The relay is held as a
separate event and it does not count in
the final score for the track and field
meet. The Stanford record in the mile
relay is 3:17 4-5, made by Sigma Chi
last year.
Delta Upsilon has a good chance of
winning the relay today, as their time
Wednesday was almost three seconds
better than any of the other teams. How
ever. it should be a close race between
D. U., El Toro, and Kappa Sigma. El
Toro didn't hav much competition when
they ran, and Kappa Sigma had trouble
passing the baton on one instance, so if
both of these teams run their best today,
they should be close on the heels of the
D. U. runners.
Paslorius, Alpha Sigma Phi, turned
in the best time in the 880. He covered
tne distance in 2:07. Other men who
ran in less than 2:13 are: Thayer, El
Toro, 2:08 3-5; French, El Toro,
2:09 4-5; Belcher, Kappa Sigma, 2:12;
Moody, El Campo, 2:12; Reeves, Chi
Psi, 2:13; RadclitTe, Breakers, 2:13.
Kaiish, Kappa Sigma, took first in the
javelin with n heave of 179 feet 6 inches.
Eskew, who expected to win the
event, had to throw with a broken jave'in
snd was only able to do '51. The best
marks in the javelin were: Kelly, Kap
pa Sigma, 163 feet 4 inches; Evers, Se
quoia, 153 feet 5 inches; Shipkey, Kappa
Sigma, 135 feet; Hill, El Campo, 134
feet 10 inches: Middleton, Kappa Sigma,
134 feet 10 inches; Kirwan, Phi Gamma
Delta, 133 feet 6 inches; Green, Theta
Chi, 132 feet 8 inches.
