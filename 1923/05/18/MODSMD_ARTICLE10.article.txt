# WOMEN'S ATHLETICS ARE BENEFICIAL-DEAN YOST
## 
### 
Athletics for women accomplish two
tilings, according to Dean Mary Yost.
"Not only do they increase the general
health and physical vigor of the woman,
but they also teach certain necessary
social virtues. By playing on a basket
ball or hockey team, a woman soon learns
to subordinate her individual interests to,
those of the group, and to strive for the
success of the whole team rather than
personal glory. Athletics develop in a
woman a sense of reliability, co-opera
tion, and, above all, good sportsmanship.
"Women's athletics has always been a
hotly discussed question," Deati Yost
says. "Not more than half a century
ago, higher education for women was
opposed on account of women's supposed
mental incapability. when this
was disproved, it was said that women
were not physically equal to the strain
attendant upon higher education. In or
der to meet this argument, various col
leges all over the country begun a series
of health cxercises for their women.
"There was much opposition to this,
croquet and horseback riding being the
extent of any lady's vigorous physical
exertion at that time," Dean Yost re
lates. "But gradually they found that
women could play tennis, basketball, and
hockey, without any serious results and
that systematic, supervised exercise act

ually contributed to the health of the
women concerned."
To illustrate this, Miss Yost told of an
interesting incident in connection with
the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the founding of a small college. A
part of the program was to be in the
form of a pageant depicting the devel
opment of physical education for women
from the time of croquet to the modern
hockey team. Old costumes were se
cured for the various periods, but it was
found that the modern girl could not
wear the dresses worn by her grand
mother at the same age. Her chest and
shoulders were broader and her waist
larger, proving that exercise had devel
oped her physically.
"The dangers of women's athletics
have been reduced to a minimum," Miss
Yost believes. "There are no varsity
intercollegiate teams and consequently
much of the strain, excitement, commer
cialism, and publicity connected with
men's athletics has been eliminated.
"There is the greatest possible co
operation between the Physical Educa
tion department and the Athletic Asso
ciation. The primary motive is to get
all the women interested in athletics in
stead of concentrating all attention upon
specially adapted individuals.
"I am glad that the women at Stan
ford arc interested in athletics," Dean
Yost says.

part of the program was to be in the
form of a pageant depicting the devel
opment of physical education for women
from the time of croquet to the modern
hockey team. Old costumes were se
cured for the various periods, but it was
found that the modern girl could not
wear the dresses worn by her grand
mother at the same age. Her chest and
shoulders were broader and her waist
larger, proving that exercise had devel
oped her physically.
"The dangers of women's athletics
have been reduced to a minimum," Miss
Yost believes. "There are no varsity
intercollegiate teams and consequently
much of the strain, excitement, commer
cialism, and publicity connected with
men's athletics has been eliminated.
"There is the greatest possible co
operation between the Physical Educa
tion department and the Athletic Asso
ciation. The primary motive is to get
all the women interested in athletics in
stead of concentrating all attention upon
specially adapted individuals.
"I am glad that the women at Stan
ford arc interested in athletics," Dean
Yost says.
Athletics for women accomplish two
tilings, according to Dean Mary Yost.
"Not only do they increase the general
health and physical vigor of the woman,
but they also teach certain necessary
social virtues. By playing on a basket
ball or hockey team, a woman soon learns
to subordinate her individual interests to,
those of the group, and to strive for the
success of the whole team rather than
personal glory. Athletics develop in a
woman a sense of reliability, co-opera
tion, and, above all, good sportsmanship.
"Women's athletics has always been a
hotly discussed question," Deati Yost
says. "Not more than half a century
ago, higher education for women was
opposed on account of women's supposed
mental incapability. when this
was disproved, it was said that women
were not physically equal to the strain
attendant upon higher education. In or
der to meet this argument, various col
leges all over the country begun a series
of health cxercises for their women.
"There was much opposition to this,
croquet and horseback riding being the
extent of any lady's vigorous physical
exertion at that time," Dean Yost re
lates. "But gradually they found that
women could play tennis, basketball, and
hockey, without any serious results and
that systematic, supervised exercise act

ually contributed to the health of the
women concerned."
To illustrate this, Miss Yost told of an
interesting incident in connection with
the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the founding of a small college. A
part of the program was to be in the
