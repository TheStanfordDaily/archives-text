## 
### 
Unofficial results announced last night
[ show Kappa Sigma winning the intra
i mural track and field meet by a margin
of 47 points. El Toro is second and
| Sigma Nu third. Kappa Sigma was
| lagging behind El Toro when five events
were finished, but the Kappa Sig men
the club men in the javelin,
which gave them enough to overcome
EI Toro's lead.
The race for individual honors rests
between Lou Minsky and L. Allen.
Allen was ahead of Minsky when the
first five events were counted, but Min
sky has a better throw in the javelin,
which should give him enough points
to win. Parish will probably take third,
because of his work with the javelin yes
terday. Some of the high point men on
five events are: Allen, Delta Chi, 3,449;
Minsky, El Toro, 3,406; Ludeke, El
Toro, 3.006; Arthur, El Toro, 2,964; Mc-
Cready, Theta Delta Chi, 2,908; EÂ«l<ew,
Kappa Sigma, 2,780; Farish, 2,634.
The victory of Kappa Sigma is the
result of consistent work in all events.
The Kappa Sigs took first in the broad
jump and fourth in the hundred on Mon
day. On Tuesday they took first in the
hurdles and second in the shot, and yes
terday they took first in both the half
and javelin with ease. The winners had
a few stars on their team, such as Es
kew, Farish, and Belcher, but the secrct
of their victory lies in the fact that they
had ten men qualify in each event, which
was done by having practically every
man in the house enter the meet. El
Toro, likewise, had ten men in each
the Associated Students. It exercises
complete control over all A. S. S. U.
property.
"Where does all our money go?"
Ask the Ex. Committee. Kor that body
authorizes all A. S. S. U. expenditures,
and passes on all student body, class,
and organization budgets; it controls
indirectly the finances of all publica
, tions, and dramatics.
The Committee appoints men to
such high positions as student mana
ger, business manager of dramatics,
and business manager of the Daily
Palo Alto. A mistake as to judgment
would cause considerable harm. The
student manager, as the business head
of the A. S. S. U., has charge of all
student funds, handles class account*.

makes student body and class con
tracts, and submits an annual budget 112
lor the approval of the Executive Com
mittee. A poor selection of the busi
ness manager of the Daily would prob
ably put the paper "on the rocks," j
due to the slender financial margin
on which it is run.
Most of the important standing and
special committees during the year,
are appointed by the Executive Com
uiittee, as well as all directors of any
association enterprise, sport managers,
and yell-leader tryoutees. Temporary
appointments to fill vacancies in office
are made.
And neither the student body, class,
nor any organization can hold a social
function on the campus without per
mission of the Executive Committee.
