The University has purchased a new
fantastic engine which ranks in horror
with some of the creations of Tom
Swift. It is a trick sprinkling gadget,
and may be seen in operation in front
of the English corner at practically any
time during the day.
It has a whirligig arrangement on top,
like all sprinklers, but the point is in
its ability to cover the ground. The
whirligig is geared to a set of spiked
wheels, and the whole machine moves re
lentlessly across the greensward with
terrible precision. Imagine its keeper
forgetting it and allowing it to go plow
ing down to Palo Alto, spreading Sears
ville and destruction in its wake.
The master mind that conceived this
should be able to toy contemptuously
with perpetual motion.
