# Skull and Snakes Elects Two Honorary Members
## 
### 
Skull and Snakes, in pursuing a
policy of linking the student body with
alumni, has elected Finlaw Geary, ex-1
'12, of Santa Rosa, and Phil Wilson, i
'97, of Los Angeles, to honorary mem
bership. Paul Davis '19, was elected
to regular active Membership at the
same meeting last evening. â€¢
The chief object of this plan is to
reach high school men throughout the I
country and keep Stanford before
them. Various living groups and or
ganizations on the campus will be
asked to submit the names of promis
ing high school men and a campaign
will be carried on by Skull and Snakes i
to attract these men to Stanford. A ;
box will be placed in the Graduate
Manager's office to receive these
recommendations, and Skull and
Snakes will serve chiefly to centralize
the attack. Copies of the current issue
of the Spectator will be sent to about (
150 high school men as a preliminary
move.
