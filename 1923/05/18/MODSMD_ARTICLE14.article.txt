# STUDENTS MOST WORK TO EAT AT ANNUAL LABOR DAY CELEBRATION
## Tasty Repast for Benefit of Dusty and Hungry Stanford Laborers Is Offered by Committee 
### Bill Wright, ’25 
"He who does not work shall not eat" and "let your conscience be your
guide" are two proverbs which hook up together very nicely in regard to the
Labor Day celebration next Wednesday. Theoretically, the objective of Labor
Day is for each student to accomplish some small amount of labor, and those
who can cover themselves with glory in the bread line without violating the
Honor System will be thrice blessed.
The barbecue committee, under Ed Landels, is engineering a very tasty
repast for the benefit of dusty and hungry Stanford laborers. There will be no
artichokes or caviar—nobody will want any. What you'll find is red, rare,
juicy meat—the roast beef of old England, without the ale customarily used
to wash it down. If you don't like beef, the committee has two other kinds of

■meat all ready for consumption—the
nicest meal you ever stuck a lip over.
If you don't like meat, there'll be
plenty of mustard.
After sampling your three kinds of
meat, you will find on your left a huge
stack of pork-and-beans. Then come
200 dozen sandwiches, all built in
sorority kitchens. Snakes will possibly
recognize the deft Oriental hand of
the So-and-So cook. Four kegs of
pickles, some sweet, some sour, will
serve as a pleasant interlude before
the 35 gallons of brick ice cream with
84 dozen of sugar cookies. Coffee next,
with milk and sugar to match.
The committee plans to serve 1000
in about 15 minutes. The tables will be
arranged in a square surrounding Sam
McDonala's barbecue pit, and fifty of
the Five Hundred will ladle the chow
over the counter. The Stanford Band
will render its impression of the Mess
Call from "Barrack Room Ballads" and
the hungriest ones will be given
strength to get there first. Chalk lines
will be drawn to indicate where the
lines are to be formed, and eight
queues of beneficiaries will pass in re
view at the same time. This brings
the number in each line to 125, and if
all contestants remain in their own
lanes the serving will not take over 20
minutes at the most. Landels says,
however, that if the student body at
tempts to make a mass attack on the
grub-pile, some hash-slinger is apt to
become confused and top off a slug of
ice cream with a measure of gravy.
Beside being deplorable in itself, this
insident would delay the feeding to a
considerable degree. Do not rush;
there is enough soup for all.
The Barbecue Committee will meet
at 4 p. m., Monday, in the committee
room in the Administration building.
Committee members are: Bob Vial,
Bob Wright, H. M. Dwight, Dave Oliva,
Sally McNair, Alice Roth, Eunice Bid
die, Pearl Bundick, Mabel Ferry,
Thelma Grace, Lillian Cottrell, Grace
Strobell, Waive Kingrey, and Doris
Bailey.
