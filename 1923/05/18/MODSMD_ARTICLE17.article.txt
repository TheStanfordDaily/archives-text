# D.P.A. and Type Tanglers Plan Diamond Brawl
## 
### 
Alibis and "ifs" are already flying:
thick and fast in regard to the big
baseball game scheduled between the
University Press and the Daily Palo
Alto staff, tomorrow at 1 p. m. on the
varsity diamond. The press-room boys
offer 9 to 1 that it will rain, and the
demon reporters come back by laying
wagers to the effect that a dog will
run on the field during the game.
Baseballing between the ink-slingers
and the type-stickers has been a grand
old institution on this newspaper,
though the function was called off last
year because of a dispute concerning
eligibility rules. There are no records
of past games, for a very simple rea
son. If the reporters lose, they don't
write anything about it, and if the
back room takes a drop they refuse to
put it in print. Oldtimers say that
the score always resembles that of a
bowling match.
Experts predict a very close score
this year. The Daily Palo Alto staff has
a team made up of six men who have
seen a baseball game, two who sub
scribe to "The Baseball Magazine,"
and one who has an autographed pic
ture of Babe Ruth. The press room is
pretty raw material, but they say that
there is nothing the staff can do that
they can't do better. Major league
scouts are scurrying to Stanford from
all parts of the country, glaring jeal
ously at one another.
President Wilbur is not expected to
hurl the first ball, but nobody saw him
do it in the Cal series anyhow. An
open season has been declared on um
pires, and a bonus of 50 cents will be
paid on each pelt brought to the losing
team after the game.
The opposing roaches are keeping
their line-ups dark, and nothing has
leaked from either camp. It is safe to
say, however, that the Daily staff will
have a batting list which will be in
credibly potent with the willow, and
that the press room will put a wily
bunch of slickers on the field. The
game will last seven innings, or until
sunset.
