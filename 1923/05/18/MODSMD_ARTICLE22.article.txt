# NOT AN INNOVATION
## 
### 
It is interesting to listen to the wild speculation
and grieved moaning over the upheaval which many
students expect will result from the new housing
regulations to go into effect at the beginning of the
next college year. It all goes to show how short is
the memory of a college student and how a few
years under a certain system convinces the present
generation of the antiquity of that system.
There are few who realize that the regulation
compelling freshmen to live in dormitories for their
first year is not a drastic change in Administration
policy and a cause for alarm as to its outcome. It
has been only since the war that freshmen have been
allowed to live in fraternity houses and elsewhere
Oh'the campus. At the time of the dispensation from
the University, it was announced to l>e only a tem
porary measure necessitated by the crowded condi
tions following the close of the war. Yet, four years
has been a long enough time for us to forget that the
system which will go into operation next fall is
merely a revival and not an innovation.
Therefore, there is not much room for argument
over the new rushing regulations discussed by fra
ternity men at their banquet last evening. A longer
rushing season, with no pledging until the spring
quarter, will be the only logical and practical method
and will be beneficial to both entering men and the
fraternities. The more effectively formality can be
dispensed with the better it will be for all concerned.
Let us hope that the new plan will do away with a
good deal of the insincerity which characterizes both
sides of the fraternity question.
As to the advisability of joining a Greek ietter or
ganization, that is a purely individual matter of which
more will be said anon.
