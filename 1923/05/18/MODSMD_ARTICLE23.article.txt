# ARISTOCRACY IN EDUCATION
## 
### 
The reaction against the overcrowding of universi
ties iji this country as a result of the cry of "Educa
tion for everybody" is making itself evident in an
effort to confine the advantages of education to those
young men and women who can really make use of it.
The latest indication of this spirit is in the speech
the other night of Charles Mills Gayley, dean of the
English department at the University of California,
in which he suggests the abolition of the present high
school accrediting system and the adoption of college
â€¢methods now in operation in British and other Euro
pean universities, of more intensified studies, smaller
classes, and a standardization of the university cir
riculum. Such a scheme would necessarily eliminate
great numbers of hangers-on at large educational
institutions who have come to college merely be
cause of parental suasion, the desire to have a good
time, or because there was nothing better to do.
Stanford's limited enrollment gives us an oppor
tunity to be impartial participants in the argument,
and there will be an argument, for reforms such as
Gayley suggests will deny the privileges of education
to many now in the universities of the country. When
we say that this would be undemocratic it is neces
sary to determine just what we mean by democracy,
for the opportunity will still remain for those who
have a genuine desire to secure higher education.
