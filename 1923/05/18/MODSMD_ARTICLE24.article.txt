# MAKING A MARTYR
## 
### 
The arrest the other day of Upton Sinclair in Los
Angeles offers some interesting material for specula
tion. He was arrested out on a hill-top, where he
had gone with the intention of making a speech. At
the time of his arrest he was reading the first amend
ment to the constitution of the United States.
A companion stepped up and greeted the policeman
who made the arrest with the words, "It's a pleasant
evening. It will be interesting to see what comes of
this." The police officer decided that he was about
to make a speech and placed him under arrest. Two
more of Sinclair's friends stepped up, made the same

remarks and achieved the same result. Thev were
all taken to jail, where they spent the night.
We evidently have laws, that utterly defeat the
purpose of that first amendment to the constitution,
which guarantees, among other things, the right of
free speech. Most of us do not care very much
whether this is true or not, because we seldom say
anything. But men such as Sinclair do care because
by violating these laws they can acquire a larger and
more sympathetic audience to listen to their flam
boyant arguments.
But the question of where this leads remains. Will
our police force continue to make arrests of this
sort? If they do will it do anything but foster dis
content with our government and sympathy for the
radical? It seems unlikely. Right now many have
more feeling of good-will toward Upton Sinclair
than ever before. W. L. S.
