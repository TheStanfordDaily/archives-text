What is this man pointing at? (No, this is not a prize
contest which Cabbages will award with a magnificent
gold door-nob.)
But what IS he pointing at? Let's see, it might be
he's pointing at the only co-ed on the campus who was

at the Prom. This is a
rather clever chap and he
might have been able to
single her out from the
imports.'*
Or he may be pointing
at the prexy about to
write Upton a letter of
congratulation on his re
cent arrest; or even
pointing at the fire mar
shal, asking in calm and
subdued tones, who the
blank blank blank turned
in that dash dam alarm
anyway.

But the secret is out!
It is—s-h-s-h —this man is pointing at the EDITORIAL
COLUMN. See? There's the editorial, and here's the
point!

The prodigal son rang his father's doorbell. The
white-haired, venerable old man recognized him at once.
"Have you come to save the old homestead?" he
queried eagerly.
"Take me in, father —I am destitute."
The old man glared at him. "You have missed your
cue. This is the third act." And he slammed the door.
"Paternal love," muttered the prodigal son savagely.
"I shall foreclose tomorrow."
