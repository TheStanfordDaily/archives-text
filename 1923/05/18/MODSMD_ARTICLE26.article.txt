# Time and Radicalism
## 
### 
A contemporary college daily in a most unusual edi
torial makes two interesting statements, as follows:
"The radical of twenty is the conservative of fifty."
"Time matures radicals; it atrophies conservatives."
The editorial further states that youth is the natural
time for radicalism, age being the natural time for con
servatism. Going further, the writer laments the con
servative element in colleges and lauds the generation
of radical ideas.
In encouraging independent thinking, righteous doubt
ing, and original ideas, the writer is to be commended.
But the element of circumstance has not been taken into
due account in the generalizations of the editorial. Per
haps youth is, generally speaking, more likely to be a
period of radicalism. Certainly the thoughts of youth are
vastly different from those of old age. Youth, for
example, is inclined to be more pessimistic than old age.
However, circumstances are an all-important element
not to be overlooked in such discussions. It is not diffi
cult to conceive of a man who, being well fortified with
material wealth and comforts in his youth, might after
ward turn radical upon being deprived of his former
comfort and well being.
Perhaps the editorial was inspired by an observation
that most collegians are conservative, perfectly satisfied
with conditions as they find them. Such a condition is
due to the fact that college people in general have few
material cares or responsibilities which would tend to
call their attention vividly to existing social deficiencies.
• After graduation their efforts at earning a livelihood
bring them into closer contact with conditions needing
remedial treatment. In this there is likelihood of their
becoming much more radical than while in college.
Their advancing years should not preclude the possi
bility of their doubting their questioning and their re
senting.—Michigan Daily.
