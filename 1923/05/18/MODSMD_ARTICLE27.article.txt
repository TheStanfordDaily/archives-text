UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA—
A little device to test the curiosity of
students has been installed in a room
here. It is a card about three inches
wide and six inches long, tacked to the
wall, and on the card are written the
words, "Do not look under this card."
Of forty people entering the room,
thirty-six looked under the card, two
did not see it, one intended to look, but
was interrupted, and only one refrained
from doing the forbidden act. The
thirty-six who lifted the card were quite
surprised to discover a mirror under
neath.
