# University Smooths Way For Campus Automobiles
## 
### 
The campus is rapidly being made
safe for automobiles. Last quarter a
Studebaker caromed violently from a
raised cement culvert-protector at the
Jog in the road between the postoffice

and the fire house, leaving a front
wheel prone and reproachful in the
street. In order to avoid a possible
repetition of this calamity the admin
istration has replaced the dangerous
crown with a flat iron grating over
which a car may pass with impunity
if driven off the road. Now if they
would only strangle the speed cops!
