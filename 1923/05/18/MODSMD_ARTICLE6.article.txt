# Cubs Throw Big Fork Fight for D.P. Alto, Inc.
## 
### 
What is black and white and red
all over? Aw, shut up.
Well, if you must know, the Daily
Palo Alto staff banquet at the Delta
Delta Delta house last night was a
Soviet affair. Everything was red, from
the strawberry shortcake to the cheru
bic countenances of those unduly con
cerned in the fork fight, which was
flung by the new members for the
benefit of some thirty-seven festive
scribes.
To quote the young lady reporter:
"The surprise of the evening was
the entertainment provided by the
freshmen for their seniors. Madame
Zaza and her .manager, in the persons
of Miss Esther Greenacre and Mr.
Jack Hardy disclosed the secrets of
those present to the amusement of all.
"This is the first time that the staff
has broken away from the old custom
of trying 'to make fools of the new
members,' as Kenneth Stewart, editor
of the D. P. A., so ably expressed it.
"Professor and Mrs. E. W. Smith
and Mr. Paul Clyde, instructor in jour
nalism, were the honored guests of
the occasion. Professor Smith and Mr.
Clyde gave short and appreciated
speeches during the banquet.
"From 6 to 8 members amused j
themselves heartily by dancing to
the tune of the two-piece orchestra of
Earl De Reyner and Jerry Powell."
