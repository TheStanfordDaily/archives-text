Professor Harris J. Ryan, head of
the Stanford Department of Electrical
Engineers, was this afternoon elected

cluding practitioners of the profession,
scientists, and two thousand six hun
dred and seventy-three advanced stu
dents of the subject in colleges and
technical schools.
Professor Ryan has been a pioneer
in experimental work in high voltage
electrical transmission, and recently
has been carrying on important ex
perimental work in radio. Through his
co-operation with the experts of elec
trical power companies and experi
ments in which he and some of these
experts have carried on in the Stan

through improved methods.
With Professor Ryan's election to
the presidency of the national body of
electrical engineers Stanford Univer
sity has on its faculty at the present

scientific bodies, which is a remark
able record for a comparatively small
university situated on the far western
shore of the continent.

j of the University, is president of the
American Medical Association, which
includes nearly 50,000 physicians and
surgeons in its membership, and will

i Franklin is at present on a tour of the
I country addressing the various sec
tions of the national society.
I Dr. Franklin's great contribution in
I the field of chemical research has been
his development of what is known as
the ammonia system of compounds.
The Crucible, organ of the Pittsburgh
' Section of the American Chemical So
i ciety, writing about Dr. Franklin and
this contribution to chemical theory,
said recently: "Dr. Franklin has
. brought to the history of American
J science the most notable addition to
; the general theory of 'types' which
has appeared for some three-score
years."
Professor Lewis M. Terman, head of
the Stanford Department of Psy

the Pacific Coast. Professor Terman's

particular contribution to psychology
has been in connection with methods
of mental measurement and tests. He
took a leading part in devising the
tests used in the army during the war
and in later revision of these tests. At
present, with an endowment from the
Commonwealth Fund of New York, in
co-operation with Stanford University,
Professor Terman is directing an in
tensive search for children of superior
mental ability in the state of Cali
fornia with the idea of following these
children through their later careers
to determine how fully they carry out
the promises of their childhood.
In this connection it may be noted
that Dean M. R. Kirkwood, of the Stan
ford Law School, is president of the
Order of the Coif, the national scholar
ship honor society of the legal profes
sion. The Order of the Coif has chap
ters in the principal law schools of
the country and election depends upon
pre-eminence in scholarship, not more
than ten per cent of those receiving
i their professional legal degree being
admitted each year.

Professor Ryan has been a pioneer
in experimental work in high voltage
electrical transmission, and recently
has been carrying on important ex
perimental work in radio. Through his
co-operation with the experts of elec
trical power companies and experi
ments in which he and some of these
experts have carried on in the Stan
ford laboratories millions of dollars
have been saved to the industry
through improved methods.
With Professor Ryan's election to
the presidency of the national body of
electrical engineers Stanford Univer
sity has on its faculty at the present
time the presidents of four national
scientific bodies, which is a remark
able record for a comparatively small
university situated on the far western
shore of the continent.
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, president
j of the University, is president of the
American Medical Association, which
includes nearly 50,000 physicians and
surgeons in its membership, and will
hold its annual meeting in San Fran
cisco June 25 to 29 which, it is ex
pected, will be attended by close to
10,000 members.
Dr. Edward C. Franklin, professor
ot organic chemistry at Stanford, is
j president of the American Chemical
Society, the national organization of
! chemists which has a membership of J
: about 15,000. This is the first time that
i the presidency of this association has
' come west of the Mississippi. Dr.
i Franklin is at present on a tour of the
I country addressing the various sec
tions of the national society.
I Dr. Franklin's great contribution in
I the field of chemical research has been
his development of what is known as
the ammonia system of compounds.
The Crucible, organ of the Pittsburgh
' Section of the American Chemical So
i ciety, writing about Dr. Franklin and
this contribution to chemical theory,
said recently: "Dr. Franklin has
. brought to the history of American
J science the most notable addition to
; the general theory of 'types' which
has appeared for some three-score
years."
Professor Lewis M. Terman, head of
the Stanford Department of Psy
chology, is president of the American
Psychological Association, an organiza
tion which includes psychologists in
the United States, and numbering be
tween four and five hundred in its
membership. This is the first time
that the presidency of this associa
tion has b/Sen conferred on a man on
the Pacific Coast. Professor Terman's

particular contribution to psychology
has been in connection with methods
of mental measurement and tests. He
took a leading part in devising the
tests used in the army during the war
and in later revision of these tests. At
present, with an endowment from the
Commonwealth Fund of New York, in
co-operation with Stanford University,
Professor Terman is directing an in
tensive search for children of superior
mental ability in the state of Cali
fornia with the idea of following these
children through their later careers
to determine how fully they carry out
the promises of their childhood.
In this connection it may be noted
that Dean M. R. Kirkwood, of the Stan
ford Law School, is president of the
Order of the Coif, the national scholar
ship honor society of the legal profes
sion. The Order of the Coif has chap
ters in the principal law schools of
the country and election depends upon
pre-eminence in scholarship, not more
than ten per cent of those receiving
i their professional legal degree being
admitted each year.
