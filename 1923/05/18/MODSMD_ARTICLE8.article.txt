# CARDINAL MERMEN 10 ENTER NATIONAL JUNIOR TITLE SWIM
## Stanford to Compete in 220 And Breaststroke Races at Pacific City Sunday 
### 
Stanford swimmers will unofficially
enter the 220 and breaststroke national
junior title swims at Pacific City Sun
day afternoon at 2:30. Although there
is a strong held entered, the Cardinal
men have a chance to score a double
victory.
Since the races are to be held in the
bay, the roughness of the water will
probably effect the times made. How
ever, O'Connor should have a chance to
win the 220-yard title. Kraemer is prob
ably the best bet in the breaststroke.
The 220 presents one of the strongest
fields that has been gathered together
this season. Opposed to O'Connor and
Allen of Stanford will be Harrison of
the Venice Plunge Swimming Associa
tion, Colon and Harvey Smith of the
Los Angeles Athletic Club, Jerry Witt
of Redondo, and Jack Roberts of the
Olympic Club. From past performances,
the race should lie between O'Connor
and Colon Smith. In the times these
swimmers have hooked up, they have
about broken even. O'Connor, however,
is confident that he can win Sunday.
Whoever wins, the time should be
around 2:30 flat, since both Smith and
O'Connor are capable of this time.
The race for third should also be a
good one. Roberts has the edge, but
Harrison or Allen might upset the dope.
The breaststroke presents a problem.
Kraemer of Stanford. Fair and Hamil
ton of the Venice Plunge Swimming As
sociation, and Jimmy Handley of the
Olympic Club are all fast swimmers.
Handle is a dark horse, no times being
available. But both Fair and Hamilton
have been clocked at 3:13 or better over
the 220-yard course. Kraemer should
also be capable of this time.
Kraemer is the favorite, though, since
he is a strong swimmer. This should
work to his advantage over the ocean
course. Kraemer, too, has been press
ing Giarlie Fletcher, the present title
holder, very closely in practice. The
time made Sunday shoilld be about 3:13.
