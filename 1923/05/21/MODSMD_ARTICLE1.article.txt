# AMENDMENT FOR EXCLUDING MOTORS TO GO ON BALLOT
## Proposed Measure Would Not Permit Underclassmen to Operate Cars on Campus PROPOSED UNDERCLASS MOTOR RULE 
### (By the Stanford Press Club 
The motor car amendment as
framed by the Executive Committee,
to be voted on May 29, is as follows:
"Proposed amendment to the con
stitution of the A. S. S. U., No. 1.
"That the ownership and operation
of motor-driven vehicles by under
classmen resident on the campus be
prohibited. (Underclassmen: men and
women who have less than six (6)

not counting.) This amendment to
be operative from October 1, 1923, for
a period of three years, at the end of
which period it may be repealed by
a two-thirds vote of the student body.
Note: Commuters shall not be al

campus use."

of an amendment to the Constitution
of the Associated Students which will,
if passed at the next Quad election,
result in the prohibition of the use of
motor-driven vehicles by underclass
men.
The problem of the automobile on
the campus is one of long standing, j
A certain lack of success in several
University activities and the failure;
of several underclassmen to remain in

because of the indiscriminate use of j
automobiles has led certain members j
of the senior class to renew the agita- i
tion against the use of machines on
the campus.
The fact that all freshmen will be
compelled to live in one dormitory
next year where it will not be neces
sary for them to have automobiles
provides an opportunity for the trial
of the new rule. The situation in re
gard to sophomores is somewhat dif
ferent but no more difficult. While
they will live in various groups on the
campus their regulation will come
