# AMENDMENT FOR EXCLUDING MOTORS TO GO ON BALLOT
## Proposed Measure Would Not Permit Underclassmen to Operate Cars on Campus PROPOSED UNDERCLASS MOTOR RULE 
### (By the Stanford Press Club 
The motor car amendment as
framed by the Executive Committee,
to be voted on May 29, is as follows:
"Proposed amendment to the con
stitution of the A. S. S. U., No. 1.
"That the ownership and operation
of motor-driven vehicles by under
classmen resident on the campus be
prohibited. (Underclassmen: men and
women who have less than six (6)
quarters residence, summer quarter
not counting.) This amendment to
be operative from October 1, 1923, for
a period of three years, at the end of
which period it may be repealed by
a two-thirds vote of the student body.
Note: Commuters shall not be al
lowed to use their cars for general
campus use."

Agitation by upper class leaders in
various activities covering a period of
four years has resulted in the framing
of an amendment to the Constitution
of the Associated Students which will,
if passed at the next Quad election,
result in the prohibition of the use of
motor-driven vehicles by underclass
men.
The problem of the automobile on
the campus is one of long standing, j
A certain lack of success in several
University activities and the failure;
of several underclassmen to remain in
the University during the present year
because of the indiscriminate use of j
automobiles has led certain members j
of the senior class to renew the agita- i
tion against the use of machines on
the campus.
The fact that all freshmen will be
compelled to live in one dormitory
next year where it will not be neces
sary for them to have automobiles
provides an opportunity for the trial
of the new rule. The situation in re
gard to sophomores is somewhat dif
ferent but no more difficult. While
they will live in various groups on the
campus their regulation will come
from within their affiliations and will
be no less easily enforced.
Administration officials have de
clared themselves and have pledged
every aid in support of the new meas-1
ure.
The amendment as drawn up pro
vides that motor-driven vehicles may
not be operated by underclassmen liv
the campus. Special provision is
for commuters. It is planned to
ate a special parking place for
:s who live off the campus where

they jnay leave their cars upon arrival
at the University and secure them
again when they desire to leave for
their homes.
Provision is made in the amendment
for its repeal following a three-year
period in case the results are not as
satisfactory to the general welfare of
the University as they promise to be.
The movement for passage of the
new amendment in the election of May
29 is being backed actively by Press
Club, Cap and Gown, Quadrangle Club,
the Men's Council, Women's Council,
Skull and Snakes, and other under
graduate organizations.
