## 
### 
For a brief spell Sunday afternoon, the
Stanford campus relaxed from its usual
studious habits to watch an aeroplane,
high up in the cleary blue sky, cut letters
of smoke. For a time it seemed as
though an exhibition of stunting was to
be shown, but when the letter L-U-C-K-Y
were spelled out, curiosity and interest
were aroused. A near pr.nic was reached
when the next two letters were S-T.
Trainer Denny, seeing them remarked.
"He must be spelling out Lucky Stan
ford." Denny was probably thinking of
football next year.
But the airmen went on with his diffi
cult task, and soon the entire message was
spelled out." It was LUCKY STRIKE.
This method of air advertising is a
practically new thing. The cigarette com
pany which is employing this novel
method of advertising, has been using it
over big cities on the coast for the past
several months.
