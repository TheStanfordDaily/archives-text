## 
### 
Tryouts for the 1923 Senior Farce, to
be presented on June 13, will be con
tinued tonight from 7 to 10, tomorrow
afternoon from 3 to 6, and tomorrow
evening from 7 to 10, under the direc
tion of A. D. Cohan, who will coach the
show, and the Senior Farcc Committee.
The cast of the play, the name of which
will be announced tomorrow or Wednes
day, will be selected on Thursday.
Members of the Senior Play Commit
tee, who have selected the play and are
arranging for its presentation, are:
Charles Midgley, chairman; Arnold
Bayley, Jerry Powell, Fred Hughes,
Dick Taylor, Tom Irwin, Florence Pix
ley, Augusta Corey, Virginia Burkes,
and Mabel Ferry.
Senior Farce Old Tradition
The senior farce is the oldest Stanford
dramatic tradition. From the first years
of the University's life a senior class
comedy of some sort has been produced

in late May or June. The type of com
edy and the manner of presentation has
varied from one extreme to another, but
the custom still remains firmly imbedded
in the Stanford dramatic calendar.
From 1895 to 1903 the senior farce
was written by students, usually in the
form of a burlesque college "romance."
Local color, campus jokes, and personal
injectures, together with a slender plot,
characterized nearly every senior farce
until the days of the Assembly Hall.
"The Rank Outsider." presented by the
Class of '02, and written by R. J. Sterret,
'02, is typical of the long-disappeared
Stanford comedy. Among characters of
the local romance were "Bud" Stoddard,
a knocker candidate for president, from
Encina; Bert Pinckcrly, Kappa Rho
freshman; and Kitty Greene, Roble in
genue.
"A Trick for a Trophy," presented
May 20, 1903, went the extreme in its
dependence on Stanford life and tradi
tion. The farce, written by R. E. Renaud
and Waldemar Young, is based on the
tradition of the Stanford axe contro
versy. The popular view of the early
days as to what the senior farce should
be is well expressed in an excerpt from a
Quad review of this play. "So, then, the
ideal Stanford farce should stand for a
picture, pure and simple, of college life,
and with as little red music and slow
lights as possible. It should strive to em
phasize some well-defined Stanford tra
dition, it should burlesque some ques
tionable custom, a custom so well known
that every man and woman in the audi
ence will see and appreciate the parody."
In 1905, the Senior Class departed
from custom to the extent of producing
Gilber and Sullivan's comic opera,
"Patience." The Class of 1907 then re
turned to ordinary comedy, producing
Boncicault's "London Assurance." This
same year the precedent for a junior
opera was set.
First Farce in Chape!
All the shows of the '90's were handi
capped by lack of a stage and theater.
The first Stanford dramatic offering was
produced in the uld tliapcl—"a lively
little farce," with no scenery and an old
muslin slide for a curtain. Subsequent
shows were given in the old gymnasium,
which stood behind the present Library.
A temporary stage had to be made up
for each performance at a cost of $100
and all-night labor by a crew of stu
dents. There was no coaching except
that which came from students them
selves or from faculty amateurs.
One dramatic offering of the '90's was
held on the steps of the old Roble hall.
The senior show of '99 was the last
campus presentation to be given in the
old gymnasium.
The progress of the senior farce in
late years is suggested by the names of
some of the plays as they go on from
1911 to the present: "Cousin Kate," by
Hubert Henry Davies; "The Amazons,"
"The Seven Sisters," "Our Wives,"
"Seven Days," "A Pair of Sixes,"
"Nothing but the Truth," "Good
Gracious, Annabel," by Clare Kummer;"
"Clarence," by Booth Tarkington; and
"Adam and Eva," by Guy Bolton and
George Middleton.
Tryouts for the 1923 Senior Farce, to
be presented on June 13, will be con
tinued tonight from 7 to 10, tomorrow
afternoon from 3 to 6, and tomorrow

"A Trick for a Trophy," presented
May 20, 1903, went the extreme in its
dependence on Stanford life and tradi
tion. The farce, written by R. E. Renaud
and Waldemar Young, is based on the
tradition of the Stanford axe contro
versy. The popular view of the early
days as to what the senior farce should
be is well expressed in an excerpt from a
Quad review of this play. "So, then, the
ideal Stanford farce should stand for a
picture, pure and simple, of college life,
and with as little red music and slow
lights as possible. It should strive to em
phasize some well-defined Stanford tra
dition, it should burlesque some ques
tionable custom, a custom so well known
that every man and woman in the audi
ence will see and appreciate the parody."
In 1905, the Senior Class departed
from custom to the extent of producing
Gilber and Sullivan's comic opera,
"Patience." The Class of 1907 then re
turned to ordinary comedy, producing
Boncicault's "London Assurance." This
same year the precedent for a junior
opera was set.
First Farce in Chape!
All the shows of the '90's were handi
capped by lack of a stage and theater.
The first Stanford dramatic offering was
produced in the uld tliapcl—"a lively
little farce," with no scenery and an old
muslin slide for a curtain. Subsequent
shows were given in the old gymnasium,
which stood behind the present Library.
A temporary stage had to be made up
for each performance at a cost of $100
and all-night labor by a crew of stu
dents. There was no coaching except
that which came from students them
selves or from faculty amateurs.
One dramatic offering of the '90's was
held on the steps of the old Roble hall.
The senior show of '99 was the last
campus presentation to be given in the
old gymnasium.
The progress of the senior farce in
late years is suggested by the names of
some of the plays as they go on from
1911 to the present: "Cousin Kate," by
Hubert Henry Davies; "The Amazons,"
"The Seven Sisters," "Our Wives,"
"Seven Days," "A Pair of Sixes,"
"Nothing but the Truth," "Good
Gracious, Annabel," by Clare Kummer;"
"Clarence," by Booth Tarkington; and
"Adam and Eva," by Guy Bolton and
George Middleton.

of the University's life a senior class

From 1895 to 1903 the senior farce
was written by students, usually in the
form of a burlesque college "romance."
Local color, campus jokes, and personal
injectures, together with a slender plot,
characterized nearly every senior farce
until the days of the Assembly Hall.
"The Rank Outsider." presented by the
Class of '02, and written by R. J. Sterret,
'02, is typical of the long-disappeared
Stanford comedy. Among characters of
the local romance were "Bud" Stoddard,
a knocker candidate for president, from
Encina; Bert Pinckcrly, Kappa Rho
freshman; and Kitty Greene, Roble in

One dramatic offering of the '90's was
held on the steps of the old Roble hall.
The senior show of '99 was the last
campus presentation to be given in the
old gymnasium.
The progress of the senior farce in
late years is suggested by the names of
some of the plays as they go on from
1911 to the present: "Cousin Kate," by
Hubert Henry Davies; "The Amazons,"
"The Seven Sisters," "Our Wives,"
"Seven Days," "A Pair of Sixes,"
"Nothing but the Truth," "Good
Gracious, Annabel," by Clare Kummer;"
"Clarence," by Booth Tarkington; and
"Adam and Eva," by Guy Bolton and
George Middleton.
