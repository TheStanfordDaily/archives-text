Senior Farce Old Tradition
The senior farce is the oldest Stanford
dramatic tradition. From the first years
of the University's life a senior class
comedy of some sort has been produced

in late May or June. The type of com
edy and the manner of presentation has
varied from one extreme to another, but
the custom still remains firmly imbedded
in the Stanford dramatic calendar.
From 1895 to 1903 the senior farce
was written by students, usually in the
form of a burlesque college "romance."
Local color, campus jokes, and personal
injectures, together with a slender plot,
characterized nearly every senior farce
until the days of the Assembly Hall.
"The Rank Outsider." presented by the
Class of '02, and written by R. J. Sterret,
'02, is typical of the long-disappeared
Stanford comedy. Among characters of
the local romance were "Bud" Stoddard,
a knocker candidate for president, from
Encina; Bert Pinckcrly, Kappa Rho
freshman; and Kitty Greene, Roble in
genue.
"A Trick for a Trophy," presented
