# INTRAMURAL TRACK IS WON By EL TORO MEN
## Lou Minsky Takes Medal for High Point Man With 3686 Points; Allen Is Second 
### 
E1 Toro won the intramural track and
field meet held last week, nosing out
Kappa Sigma by a margin of 39 points.
It was unofficially announced Friday that
Kappa Sigma had won the meet but a
recount of results in the different events
showed that El Toro had 29,531 points
and Kappa Sigma 29,492.
Lou Minsky won the medal offered for
the high point man when he hurled the
javelin 19 feet farther than Allen, who
was ahead until that event. Minsky made
points and Allen accumulated
3,581 points. Other high point scorers
have not been announced yet but it is
probable that Farish of Kappa Sigma
will be third with 3,464 points. Minsky
is a member of El Toro and Allen repre
sents Delta Chi. Ludeke and Arthur, both
El Toro tracksters, were also well up in
the race for high point honors.
Delta Upsilon nosed El Toro out in the
finals of the relays after El Toro had
held the lead the greater part of the race.
The time was 3 :18 2-5. Kappa Sigma was
third and El Campo brought up the rear.
Wally i Miller running first for Delta
Upsilon secured a substantial lead in his
furlong, but Lou Minsky, the third run
ner for El Toro passed Lacey, Delta
Upsilon, as though he weren't running.
El Toro held the lead until the final 220
yards when Coverley overtook Thayer
and managed to cross the tape a few feet
ahead of the El Toro man. Hyland who
ran seventh for Delta Upsilon was one of
the chief ground gainers, as he cut down
the lead enough for Coverley to be able
to finish the work.
