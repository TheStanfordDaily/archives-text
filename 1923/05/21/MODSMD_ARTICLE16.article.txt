# Engineers Stir Up 70-Mile Gale to Cool Spring Heat
## 
### 
Summer has 110 heat which science
cannot cool. And here is the proof posi
tive. Two industrious young engineers
were working in the wind tunnel in the
aerodynamics lab on one of our nice
warm afternoons.
Deciding that a hit of coolness would
make the brain more active, they started
the propeller of the experimental ma
chine, which only stirs up a breeze of
seventy miles an hour. And then they
worked and worked.
