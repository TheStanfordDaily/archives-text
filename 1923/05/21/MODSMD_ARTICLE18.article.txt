# KIRKSEY TIMED IN 91-5 SECONDS FOR 100 YARD DASH
## 
### 
Morris Kirkscy, '18, former Stanford
star sprinter, unofficially broke two
world's records in an exhibition racc on
the Santa Rosa cinder track yesterday
afternoon. His time in the 100-yard
dash was caught at 91-5 seconds, as
against the world's record of 9 3-5 sec
onds. In the same racc he was clocked
at the seventy-five-meter mark in 72-"5
seconds, compared to the official world's
record time of 8 1-5 seconds.
The record of 9 3-5 seconds for the
100-yard dash is held by Charles Pad
j dock, University of Southern California
itrack star; D. J. Kelly, and H. P. Drew
,in the official records. Kirksey has mn
! the distance in record time on several
' occasions, but never in an official meet,
| so that his name has never been added
to the official list of joint holders of the
100-yard title. The 75-meter dash, which
I is run mostly in foreign countries, has
not proved popular in the United States,
but the time for this racc and others of
its kind is usually taken at the same time
the 100-yard dash record is being taken.
Kirksey has never tried the shorter dis
tance in an official meet, but has been
clocked, as he was yesterday, while run
ning the 100-yard event. The world's
record is held by Charles Paddock and
Eddie Sudden, also a former Stanford
sprinter, and now a member of the
Olympic Club track team. Their time
in the dash has been officially taken at
8 1-5 seconds, which is three-fifths of a
' second slower than the time unofficially
; credited to Kirksey in yesterday's race.
Kirksey was one of the mainstays of
the Stanford track team while in college,
and placed a close second to Paddock in
all the races in which the two were en
tered. He has been performing in vari
ous track and field meets in the Hawaiian
Islands during the winter, and has jnst
recently returned to this country. His
race yesterday was his second appear
j ance in a public meet this year.
