# THE 						AUTOMOBILE—A Disintegrating Factor
## 
### 
In a discussion with a prominent alumnus recently
some interesting ideas were developed in regard to
the cause of the present state of affairs here, espe
cially in regard to athletics. This man said, "I be
lieve that one-half of your problem at present is the
automobile. The last time I went to the campus I
had lunch with a group of men and immediately
after the meal most of them disappeared. They
scattered in the four directions in their automobiles.
"It wasn't that way a few years ago," he went on.
"And it shouldn't be now. Stanford is small in
numbers in comparison to California, its natural
rival. Through their numbers they are able to put
strong teams into every branch of athletics and still
waste one-half of their students. On 'the farm' it is
■different. Every possible ounce of energy must be
used up if wc mc lu I»cut the Blue and Gold teams
as we have in the past.
Interests Centered on the Campus
"The same ratio has always been present. But,
before the automobile became so common that almost
everybody had one or could have one, our interests
were centered on the campus. It was always impos
sible to run into a gang who were talking ancj work
ing for Stanford. Now that is not the common
thing. Instead you find small groups talking about
parties.
"I realize that the automobile is handy especially
to older students who can handle them while still
hitting the books and engaging in some activity or
other.
"With the underclassmen it is different. They
have a very large problem in getting started in a
tiew field. If they are owners of automobiles they
very often never go near the athletic fields, the stage
or the Press building. They merely study enough to
get by and spend the rest of the time riding some
where and back when they should be working.
"If a rule could be passed that would not permit
underclassmen to have automobiles they would be
certain to get into some activity or other and by
the time they become upperclassmen nobody will
attempt to deny them the right to operate a machine
because they will then be established in everything
they will ever and will be mature enough to
handle their various interests.
Class Spirit Would Be Promoted
"Such a rule would operate toward the promotion
of a greater class spirit, the revival of which was
evidenced in the Junior Week Program put on by
the Class of 1924 this year, and class spirit means
increased interest in the University and its many
activities and continued success in those activities."
There is admittedly considerable of meat in what
this alumnus thinks of the present situation. In
view of the fact that he was one of the ablest athletic
coaches that Stanford has ever had it is more than
likely that what he says is true and that what he
suggests would bring a large return to Stanford.
