# NEXT YEAR'S EDITOR
## 
### 
Once more a man has been electcd to the editor
ship of the .Daily Palo Alto upon a white ballot.
Peanut politics, which used to play so large a part
in the internal mechanism of the student newspaper,
seem to have disappeared entirely from journalistic
endeavor on the campus. For several years now,
almost without exception, it has merely been a mat
ter of the man with the combination of seniority and
merit succeeding quietly to the head of the staff.
It is not idle (lattery to say that Phil Newill has

been one of the hardest and cleverest workers the
Daily has ever known, from his first position as
freshman cub reporter, through the duties of campus
editor, to his present status as managing editor of
the paper. Tie is an unconventional thinker, with
an originality that is sometimes startling and with a
keen sense of humor. Newill will undoubtedly keep
the campus interested in the Daily Palo Alto from
the time he takes over its management at the begin
ning of the fall quarter.
