MOB URGES ACTION IN "BAN BIKE" PROBE
"Take 'em away!" is # the cry of the agitators who seek
to remove the ills of campus life in one dose by the
abolition of the bicycle. Last night at an indigestion
meeting caled by the League for the Protectiop of 801 l
Weevils, President Autostrop uttered a fierce denuncia
tion of the machines as indecent and demoralizing.
"The insidious bicycle brings the cigar store and the
beauty parlor within a half hour of the campus," says
Autostrop. "It is highly undemocratic: few Stanford
boys and girls can afford to be seen riding on one."

WHEELS VS. WAILS
Discussion waxes hot all over the campus on the ques
tion of the partial or total abstenance from the use of
the bicycle. Partial restriction is advocated by many.
Some claim that only professors and teachers should be
forbidden its use; others believe in a national constitu
tional amendment with a clause providing for enforce
ment with an airplane fleet. Others feel that only those
who at present own a bicycle should be forbidden to
use it.
Should the bicycle be banned on the campus or should
it not? Our answer is emphatically yes.

one per cent be manufactured, sold, or transported in
the United States, including light velocipedes and kiddie
kars?

FIRE MARSHAL HAMB —"Bicycles constitute one of
the most vicious fire hazards on the campus. Redlight
candles and other pyrotechnics can be brought in by
anyone owning such a machine. I am absolutely against
them."

BASIL HOLEPROOF, major in fancy tatting—"Per
sonally I believe the individual should choose for him
self. I can take my bicycle or leave them alone."

"HEFTY" ZINK, scoreboard marker —"The bicycle is
the direct cause of the poor showing of the men's marble
squad, German measles, and the poor food served at the
Union. Any man who uses one or encourages its use in
others is a snake and a slacker, nad you can tell 'em I
said so!"

ENOS GARGLE, professor of social prevarication —
"Bridge parties and necking are direct results of the
bicycle habit. Away with it!"

GUS, foot specialist, Eczema Hall —"I believe in
bicycles without mudguards. All other kinds should be
run off the campus." j
