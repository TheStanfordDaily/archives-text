"As a mine of sentimentality, give me the general
public," declared a well known critic. We, who have
bravely stood up under charges of brisk and businesslike
money-seeking, of cold and calculating finance, of gigan
tic but gentle grafting,—must exclaim in surprise at this
accusation. Are we guilty? Surveying the matter from
the standpoint of the teacher and the movie palace, we
are forced to emit a weak "yes."
How we love to cherish our old favorites no matter
liow old fend time worn they are! We still dote on the
honest country lad who is fighting to pay off the mort
gage on the old farm before the black haired villain, who
is in love with his "sweetie," forecloses. I say we dote
on this personage even thought at times he handles his
accustomed rake like a salad fork and whose knowledge
of cows was quite obviously obtained through hotel
menus. We quiver with excitement every time "Two
gun" Kiote is flashed on the screen. How we worship
this simple brave man. untrammeled and unfettered by
the polite conventions of modern society. Indeed, it is
easy to forgive him that excellent manicure obtained in
some New York shop—truly, it but accentuates his
bandolined charm. But undoubtedly, our real favorites
are those dear men of thirty-five or forty who portray
the college freshman types we have so grown to love.
Give up a fat and doddering man. dressed in the mode
of 1890, and we have the ideal personification of the
modern college youth. Accompanied with the bewhisk
ered zoological specimen which we at once recognize to
be the popular representation of the college professor,
our friend makes a decided hit with his drinking of cold
tea from whiskey bottles quite evidently to the glory of
his Alma Mater. I say we love these types. We refuse
to be parted from them. We must have them hashed
up and served before us at frequent intervals or we
declare the stage and the movies are going to the "dem
nition bow wows." How we cling to the simple country
youth and his dear relatives on the everlastingy mort
gaged farm! How we applaud "Two-gun" Kiote after
his 568 th rescue of the New York socitv girl from the
clutches of the cruel bandit! How we enjoy those de
lightful college plays in which the formerly despised
youth wins the football game after the rival institute
is in the lead —winning of course —the hand of the
thirty-year old colege maiden whom he has adored. This
sentiment is too transparent to be hid. We, who have
waived aside charges of brisk and business-like money
seeking, of cold and calculating finance, of gigantic but
gentle grafting—when confronted with this accusation,
must sorrowfully confess the truth! —W. L. G.

public," declared a well known critic. We, who have
bravely stood up under charges of brisk and businesslike
money-seeking, of cold and calculating finance, of gigan
tic but gentle grafting,—must exclaim in surprise at this
accusation. Are we guilty? Surveying the matter from
the standpoint of the teacher and the movie palace, we
are forced to emit a weak "yes."
How we love to cherish our old favorites no matter
liow old fend time worn they are! We still dote on the
honest country lad who is fighting to pay off the mort
gage on the old farm before the black haired villain, who
is in love with his "sweetie," forecloses. I say we dote
on this personage even thought at times he handles his
accustomed rake like a salad fork and whose knowledge
of cows was quite obviously obtained through hotel
menus. We quiver with excitement every time "Two
gun" Kiote is flashed on the screen. How we worship
this simple brave man. untrammeled and unfettered by
the polite conventions of modern society. Indeed, it is
easy to forgive him that excellent manicure obtained in
some New York shop—truly, it but accentuates his
bandolined charm. But undoubtedly, our real favorites
are those dear men of thirty-five or forty who portray
the college freshman types we have so grown to love.
Give up a fat and doddering man. dressed in the mode
of 1890, and we have the ideal personification of the
modern college youth. Accompanied with the bewhisk
ered zoological specimen which we at once recognize to
be the popular representation of the college professor,
our friend makes a decided hit with his drinking of cold
tea from whiskey bottles quite evidently to the glory of
his Alma Mater. I say we love these types. We refuse
to be parted from them. We must have them hashed
up and served before us at frequent intervals or we
declare the stage and the movies are going to the "dem
nition bow wows." How we cling to the simple country
youth and his dear relatives on the everlastingy mort
gaged farm! How we applaud "Two-gun" Kiote after
his 568 th rescue of the New York socitv girl from the
clutches of the cruel bandit! How we enjoy those de
lightful college plays in which the formerly despised
youth wins the football game after the rival institute
is in the lead —winning of course —the hand of the
thirty-year old colege maiden whom he has adored. This
sentiment is too transparent to be hid. We, who have
waived aside charges of brisk and business-like money
seeking, of cold and calculating finance, of gigantic but
gentle grafting—when confronted with this accusation,
must sorrowfully confess the truth! —W. L. G.
