MANY HAVE BEEN regretting the tendency
which has been shown in the last few years toward
giving University appointments of various sorN to
outsiders. The announcement that Percy Heckendorf
and Ford Tussing will assist in the Graduate Mana
ger's office next year is an encouraging indication
that the practice of giving Stanford jobs to Stanford
men will be revived. Both men have proved by past
performance on the campus that they arc deserving
of the appointments and capable of dispatching their
duties.
