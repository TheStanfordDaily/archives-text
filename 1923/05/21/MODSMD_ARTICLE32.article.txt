# Developing Varsity Material Is Value of Intramurals—Davis
## 
### 
"One of the main advantages of intra
mural athletics is the co-operation be
tween the club and society teams and the
varsity teams. The former develops tal
ent for the latter. Large numbers of
men are uncovered each year for use
011 one or more of the varsity teams dur
ing the following season.
This is the statement made by Intra
mural Director Charles W. Davis, who is
in charge of Stanford's intramural and
interclass competitive athletic contests.
Davis graduated from the Springfield
Y. M. C. A. College at Springfield, Mass.,
in 1918, with a degree of Bachelor of
Physical Education, a special degree
given by the college, which specializes in
the development of gymnasium instruc
tors and athletic directors. He has had j
considerable experience not only with
older men but with young school boys as
well. Several summers he has been a
camp director in charge of all athletics,
games, and trips at a New England sum
mer camp. He has spent one or two sum
mers as playground director in Boston.
His personal experience has been broad
and included almost every sport, playing
varsity soccer, baseball, ice hockey, and
swimming on the Springfield teams and
taking part in interclass contests in foot
ball and basketball. Since then he has
played considerable tennis and handball
and is capable of directing all of the in
tramural sports with which he is con
nected.
In January, 1919, Davis took a position
in Madison, New Jersey, as physical di
rector and continued there until Septem
ber, 1921. At that time he left to take a
position as director in the Cleveland
Heights High School where he served
until the summer of 1922. Before he came
to Stanford last fall he filled the position
of swimming instructor at the
plunge, leaving there to start his work
here at the opening of the fall quarter.
During the present college year, Davis
has had charge of a continual series of
intramural and interclass sports. His
work began in the fall with interclass
football, but which beached a high point
during the past successful season. Intra
mural corss-country was run of? about the
same time. Then followed an open hand
ball match, with a succeeding one during
the winter quarter. Intramural basketball
was followed by baseball and that by
track, completing two quarters of in
tensely competitive intramural sport. In
tramural swimming will take place within
a week or two and interclass tennis will
be concluded before the first of June.
The arrangement of interclass compe

tition into a regular schedule with a per
petual trophy as a prize has led to much
interest in all of the sports. During the
Jear seven sports have been up for inter
class competition — football, marathon,
track, soccer, swimming, tennis, basket
ball, and baseball. The tennis tourna
ment which is now in progress is a com
bination singles and doubles competition.
During the fall a singles match was ar
ranged and in the following quarter a
doubles tournament was played, with the
combination meet scheduled for the
spring term.
"The chief advantage of this regularity
of schedule is to so establish interclass
and intramural sports that they will be
expected by the campus at a certain
definite time each year. The men will
know when a certain sport will be up for
competition and they will be in shape to
compete," said Davis in a recent inter
view. "The idea of intramural athletics
is good in that it develops a spirit of de
mocracy which would not exist naturally
011 the campus without the aid of this
personal contact with various campus ath
letes. Also men who start work in in
tramural athletics in their first or second
year, will continue to come out for some
team during their junior and senior years
when they are 110 longer compelled to
take athletic work. During the past sea
son, although we gave credit for compul
sory training to those men engaging in
intramural games, we were asked to
check off only four or five men to each
hundred taking part in the sport. This
shows that the men are either mostly
upperclassmen or that the underclassmen
are so interested in the intramural work
that they do not desire to make it count
as compulsory work.
"The interclass and intramural seasons
are also arranged as often as possible to
precede the varsity season in order to
supplement the varsity training and give
prospective material a chance to get into
shape before the call for candidates is
made. With these evident desirable ef
fects, intramural athletics are bound to
develop into something very worth while
and of considerable value not only to the
men themselves to the coaches who
are expected to put out winning varsity
teams. Intramural work has been ex
tended to all branches of sport where
varsity teams compete and, with an in
creased interest shown in that type of
competition, the performance of the
rious club and society teams should n
nearly rival that of the varsity in c
bre."
