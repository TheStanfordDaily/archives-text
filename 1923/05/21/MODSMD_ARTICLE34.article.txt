# MUSICAL CLUBS WILL GIVE JOINT CONCERT
## 
### 
In the interest of a new piano fund for
the Assembly Hall, musical organiza
tions of the campus will inaugurate an
annual custom by giving a joint concert
next Thursday evening in the Assembly
Hall at 8:15, Glee Club, Schubert Club,
Music Club, and Orchestra Club are the
societies working in this enterprise.
"To those who ever have seen the
present musical instrument which ac
companies University singing, the need
for a new piano is self-evident," said
"Sid" Laughlin, president of the Glee
Club. "By giving these concerts the
music clubs hope to accumulate enough
money in a few years to buy a piano
which will be a help instead of a draw
back.
An effort was made to discover the
vintage of the piano now being used, but
its age evidently out-dates the memory
of the oldest inhabitant. Several Uni-
I versity authorities suggested that it was
part of the cargo of the first ship to sail
around Cap Horn. Warren D. Allen,
Memorial Church organist, believes that
eighty-five years is a conservative esti
mate of its lifetime; and the consensus
of opinion is that the old instrument has j
king passed its days of usefulness.
Although a detailed program of the
concert has nat yet been announced,
theru»will be several individual numbers, i
including solo's by "Dick" Malaby, Ger
aldine Watt, and Meribeth Cameron. A
trio for violin, 'cello, and piano will be!
played by Elizabeth Peirce, Malcolm
Davison, and Marjorie McDonald. In
addition to these features, both Schu
bert Club and Glee Club will sing a
number of selections.
Tickets for the performance went on |
sale today at the Stanford Bookstore
and at Crandall's.
