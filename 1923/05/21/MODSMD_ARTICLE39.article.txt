Foreword: if the typestickers allow
this story to appear in print, Upton
Sinclair's "The Brass Check" is just so
much applesauce. Now think of that.
Because the Daily Palo Alto baseball
varsity went around and around the
diamond Saturday afternoon and
emerged at the ponderous end of a 14
to 7 score. It wasn't baseball —the re
porters were afraid of being arrested.
It was a stirring spectacle, and a great
example of athletics among the intel
| ligeticia,
The press! rooiii boys wanted to dl
, vide by seven and call it 2 to 1 and a
'pitchers', battle, but the writing ele
ment made ten of those runs in one
.inning and refused to be bilked. At
the beginning of the ninth earthquake
, the score stood at 14 to 2, but even as
the early Christian martyr took a bite
out of the lion's tail just before Leo
had supper so did the linotypers show
one final display of temper. One um
pire was entirely worn out and the
I second was just beginning to gibber
when the end came.
The good old home plate was held
inviolate during the first uproar, but
! in the second and third the pencil
i sharpeners hung up four proud pearlies
j on a couple of hits and a flock of
! typographical errors. In this same
{third the reporters split a couple of
I infinitives and allowed the enemy to

sneak two men over the dish while the
umpire was searching the sky for the
"Lucky Strike" airplane. It looked like
a good tight game.
But in the fifth came the eruption.
The pen-drivers dropped a whole gal
ley on the floor and the effect was
awful. Ten great hulking runs, and
even at that the umpire brought the
inning to a close when he became
dizzy. The decision was as raw as a
beef-steak on the hoof, but through an
pversight the umps escaped without a
scratch.
The press substituted a port-sider on
the mound during this inning, but his
rural free delivery proved easy to the
whistling bats of the grammatical glad
iators.
The press crew started a dangerous
rally at the last hurdle, putting five
runs away before the young Ring Lard
ners got hep to the lay-out. A flashy
double play removed the hazard when
an anonymous hero stole second with
the bases full. Incidentally the Daily
staff used only one flinger and he —oh,
well, they were all good for at least a
'B' average.
It is considered possible that the
1924 Quad staff may summon courage
to challenge the flashy D. P. A. outfit.
Seven rounds to a decision with no
holds barred.

It is considered possible that the
