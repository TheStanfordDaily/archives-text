# NATIONAL SWIMMING TITLES ANNEXED BY STARS FROM SOUTH
## 
### 
Surprises came thick and fast in the
junior national title swims at Pacific
City, Sunday afternoon. Stanford men,
swimming unattached, who were fa
vored to win, failed to carry away a
single title. Three of the four titles at
stake were won by Southern California
swimmers.
The biggest surprise of all came
when Wallace O'Connor of Stanford
finished third in the 220-yard free style.
O'Connor was favored to win by a good
margin, and the time made Sunday
2:37.5, was several seconds slower
than the time he has been consistently
making all season. But inability to be
come atcustomed to the course, and
failure to find his bearings and swim a
steady race, lost for the Stanford star.
The race was won by Jerry Witt of
the Redondo Swimming Club, who was
conceded but an outside chance of
annexing the title. Colin Smith, Los
Angeles Athletic Club satelite, was
lucky to finish second ahead of O'Con
nor.
