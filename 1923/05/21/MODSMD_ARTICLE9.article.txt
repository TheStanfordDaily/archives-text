# Fraternity Delegates To Vote on Rushing Tonight
## 
### 
Formulated and adopted unanimous
ly by the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol and endorsed by the Alumni In
terfraternity Conference, a new rushh
ing system, the main points of which
are no rushing In the winter quarter
only on Wednesday evenings and
week-ends, except Sunday nights, will
be voted on at the last meeting this
year of the Interfraternity Conference,
to be held in the Old Union at 9:30
this fevening.
This proposed radical change in
rushing methods is designed to obviate
the evils of spring pledging and a
period rushing schemes, to meet
imands of the freshman dormi
tuation, and to fit in the recent
.blished Interfraternity Board of
Â»1, which unanimously adopted
'stem last Monday, believes the
) be the only one adapted to the
ions which will arise next year.
Board Lists Advantages
new system will be advanta
to the freshmen, in the opinion
board. The isolation period in
itumn will give the first-year
chance to develop stronger
anity, friendship, and spirit,
m from outside interruption
should increase scholarship markedly.
For the fraternities the change, ac

cording to the board, should mean
diminished rushing expenses, increased
scholarship standing, and an oppor
tunity to judge rushees under more
favorable conditions.
This disciplinary body for enforce
ment of the system's rules would be
the Board of Control. Like the Men's
Council, the board has the power to
act free from outside control. This is
tl,e first time fraternities have placed
such control of their affairs in the
hands of an executive body.
Sponsor Committee
The Board of Control has sent a
suggestion to President Wilburn, that
fraternity men, appointed by the Inter
fraternity Conference, be placed on the
sponsor committee, which will act as
an advisory board for the freshmen in
the Encina dormitory next year. The
board believes that freshmen should
have the benefit of sponsoring by
strong row men, and that the fraterni
ties should have an opportunity to pro
tect their own interests in the carry
ing out of the rules of the new rush
ing system.
The annual election of members of
the Board of Control for next year
will be held tonight also. Faculty and
alumni members on the board are ap
pointed by President Wilbur.
