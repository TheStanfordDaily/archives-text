By a vote of the Interfraternity Con
ference last night, the new proposed
rushing system, which excludes rush
ing in the autumn and spring quarters
and provides limited rushing during
the winter quarter, was referred back
to the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol for acceptance or rejection. Nomi
nations for president of the confer
ence and members of the Board of
Control were also made last night.
In referring the rushing system to
the Board of Control, the Interfra
ternity Conference acted in accord
with the accepted plan to place execu
tive control of fraternity matters in
the hands of this body. Although this
suggestion of legislation, according to
the scheme, will come from the Inter
fraternity Conference, the actual en
actment of all measures will be made
by the hoard.
The board as now developed con
sists of the president of the Inter
fraternity Conference, four fraternity
representatives elected from fraternity
men at large, two faculty members,
appointed by the President of the Uni
versity, and two alumni members ap
pointed by the alumni conference of
San Francisco with the approval of
the President of the University. The
Dean of Men will also sit as an ad
visory member of the board, but with
out vote. Two of the four student fra
ternity representatives will be elected
by the conference in the middle of
their junior years, to serve until the
middle of the following year. The!
other two, the senior members, will be'
elected at the beginning of their sen- j
ior years, and will serve all three!
quarters.
The following men were nominated
for the presidency of the Interfra-j
ternity Conference next year: Genej
Trago, Lester Dills, Louis Alabaster, I
and Russell Langford. Nominations |
for members of the Board of Control

conference.
