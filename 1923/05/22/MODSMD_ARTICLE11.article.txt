# SENIOR CLASS WILL GIVE DONATION TO LOAN FUND
## 
### 
As a parting gift to the University, the
Senior Class has decided to presefft a
sum of money to the student loan fund
to be raised by collection of $3 dues
from each member before his name may
be signed to the class roll.
This contribution will form part of a
special fund in the Dean of Men's office,
although the money will be available as
a temporary loan to both men and wom
en who need assistance. This emergency
endowment was started several years
ago by an anonymous gift of $500. It
is not restricted by time limits, scholar
ship requirements, nor is any action nec
essary on these special cases, except the
approval of Dean Culver and President
Wilbur.
Previous classes have used the balance

of their funds for various gifts: 1920
and 1921 graduates gave sums to spe
cific items in the Stanford War Memo
rial ,in memory of class members who
died in the war. Last year the Class of
1922 donated $1,000 for a fountain, to
be placed in the court of the Union.
"The emergency loan fund is more
useful than any of its kind in the Uni
versity," said Dean Culver in describing
this endowment. "1 wish I had saved
the many letters of appreciation which
1 receive from grateful students. A
number of alumni have returned double
the amount loaned to them."
Plans for this senior donation were
passed on by the Committee on Endow
ment, of which Fred Loomis is chair
man. Dues arc payable to Willard L.
Johnson, class treasurer.
