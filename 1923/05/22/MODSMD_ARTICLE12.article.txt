# FIRST TRYOUTS FOR 1923 FARCE CONCLUDED TONIGHT
## 
### 
First tryouts for the Senior Farce, to
be presented June 13, the last day of
examinations, will be concluded tonight
in the Assembly Hall from 7 to 10. Final
tryouts will be held on Wednesday, and
the cast will be announced Thursday.
Because there are only two full weeks
in which to rehearse the play, cast mem
bers will be forced to work on the stock
company plan, learning all lines in sev
eral days, and rehearsing intensely dur
ing the short period. For this reason,
A. D. Cohan, who is directing the farce,
hopes to be able to secure a cast of some
experience.
A meeting of directors, technical
heads and financial managers of the play
will be held after the completion of try
outs tonight in the Assembly Hall. Ex
penditures for scenery, costumes, and
properties will be determined at this time

and further technical appointments for
the management of the play will be made.
Names of those passing tryouts held
this afternoon and tonight will be posted
on the door of the Green r'oom Wednes
day morning, so that successful students
may return for final tryouts in the aft
ernoon.
The names of those who successfully
passed the preliminary trials yesterday
