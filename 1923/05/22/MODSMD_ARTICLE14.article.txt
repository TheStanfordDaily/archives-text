# SEMI-FINALS PLAYED IN INTRAMURAL BALL
## Theta Xi and Sigma Nu Win From Delta Upsilon and Alpha Delta Phi 
### 
Theta Xi downed Alpha Delta Phi
6-1, and Sigma Nu defeated Delta Up
silon 7-5 in the first baseball games
in the semi-finals of the intramural
season, played yesterday afternoon.
The games scheduled for today are:
Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs. Theta Xi;
and Sigma Nu vs. El Cuadro.
Maillot twirled a no-hit game for
Theta Xi. He had the Alpha Delts well
in hand at all times and their only
run came as the result of an error.
Maillot allowed but three free passes
to first and struck out fourteen men in
seven innings. Loomis did the mound
work for the Alpha Delts and pitched
a good game, but he was not able to
hold the Theta Xi batters down.
Clark Gets Homer
Clark furnished the big thrill of the
game when he hammered out a homer
in the fourth, driving in two men
ahead of him. Clark also got two other
hits. Schofield garnered two pelts out
of three trips to the plate.
The Sigma Nu - Delta Upsilon game
was a nip-and-tuck affair. Delta Upsi
lon took the lead in the first when it
pushed across a run. Both teams made
two in the second. This brought the
score to 3-2 for the D. U.'s. The game
continued on an even basis until the
fifth, when Sigma Nu got away for
four runs. This was too big a lead for
the D. U.'s to overcome and the game
ended 7-5.
Dwight Hurls for Sigma Nu
Dwight did the pitching for the win
ners. Jim Aydelotte, the regular Sigma
Nu pitcher, is resting up for the sec
ond game of the series. Boles twirled
the first four innings for Delta Up
silon, when he was replaced by Dick
Hyland.
Errors were frequent on both sides,
and neither feam seemed to be playing
up to its usual standard. D. U. accu
mulated the most hits but their fre
quent bungles gave Sigma Ni '.he ad
vantage. Thebe, Theta Xi, did the best
hitting, getting a home run and two
singles. Boles drove out a three-bagger.
