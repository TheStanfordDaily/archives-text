# CORNERSTONE, WORK, BARBECUE, DANCE, WILL BE LABOR ATTRACTIONS ON WEDNESDAY
## All Students Will Abandon Classes For Annual Clean-up Program At Old Stanford Residence 
### Bill Wright, ’25 
From the time that students start toward the Children's Convalescent Home
tomorrow afternoon until the last of the entertainment is over at about 8:30,
there will be no time to think about classes. For that matter, there will be
no classes—the University will be given a half-holiday.
The fourth annual Labor Day will open when three lines of men, in semi
old clothing, begin to wend their way toward the old Stanford residence.
One line, under the guidance of Yell Leader Lou Minsky, will start from
Encina, while Dud DeGroot leads another down the Row from the Sigma Nu
house and the third leaves Sequoia hall. This curtain-raißer wlil be staged at
1 o'clock.

The University lost twelve gallons of gas last year in letting the motors idle
while the trucks waited at sorority houses for Sister Smith to Djer-Kiss her
nose. Hence the women will assemble tomorrow at 1:15 at the Corporation
Yard, where transportation to the home will be waiting. All members of the
Five Hundred are urgently prayed to attend, as their presence is absolutely
essential at one feature of the day's sport. The system of meeting at the yard

>will speed things up considerably.
A scene of devastation will await
the throng over at the battlefield.
Triumphant weeds are waving high in
the air, bushes and trees run rampant,
and there is always a fence to be torn
down. Just to revive the discouraged
hordes who gaze blankly upon the
scene of their coming labors, the Stan
ford Band will originate a few pre
liminary snuffles and the party will be
well started.
During the early part of the after
noon a bugle will assemble the crowd
for the laying of the cornerstone on
the new $35,000' building dedicated to
Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin. The
program will last for about half an
hour and will follow the plan an
nounced in yesterday's paper.
The barbecue committee announccß
that living groups for men will be
asked to contribute $5 instead of the
$3 donation requested last year. The
1922 barbecue went in the hole, and it
is imperative that Labor Day pay for
expenses will be given to the Con
valescent Home.
With the cornerstone safely planted,
the perspiration will begin to flow. No
work will be over. The main problem
then will be to stay in your bread-line
and keep your brimming plate right
side up. Ed Landels and Sam McDon
ald have laid more than the corner
stone on what will probably be the
best barbecue seen around here since
Congress did away with the main fea- 1
ture of such banquets. The absence of
beer will not be noticed, however, as ,
copies of the Daily Palo Alto will be
distributed at the barbecue instead of
at the living groups, to help wash down
the seventeen varieties of things to be
eaten.
On With the Dance
The entertainments directly after
dinner, under the direction of Dave
Mannoccir, will include the most novel
and progressive feature of the day. A
huge canvas will be spread out on the ]
lawn, and a ten-piece orchestra will
furnish strains for light dancing.
There's where the women will be the;
whole thing—even if the rose bushes
could get along without them. Grin
stead's orchestra, supplemented by
various other campus musicians, will
strive to please, and assuredly do it.
Dancing will continue from 6 o'clock to
8:30.
Alternating with dance numbers,!
there will be several specialty acts by j
assorted campus talent. Arnold Bayley
will bring his envied vocal chords
along with him, and will collaborate
with "Chick" Midgley in presenting
several clever little things they have
picked up here and there. Later on,
Ted Van Deusen and Gardner Lippin
cott will get off some tricks that no
body has seen before, while the musi
cians take deep breaths and pour water
on their smoking instruments. The
S. A. E. trio, made up of Homer Math
ews, "Spike" Gifford, and Lee Fowle,
will summon close harmony on vari
ous subjects dear to campus hearts,
and the last specialty is a toss-up be
tween Gene Trago and the Bill Lucas-
Dorothy Dahler Junior Opera combina
tion.
After the applause has died away,
the Stanford Band will strike up a
recessional, and the rest of the eve
ning will theoretically be spent with
the books.
