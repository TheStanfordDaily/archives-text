# CORNERSTONE, WORK, BARBECUE, DANCE, WILL BE LABOR ATTRACTIONS ON WEDNESDAY
## All Students Will Abandon Classes For Annual Clean-up Program At Old Stanford Residence 
### Bill Wright, ’25 
From the time that students start toward the Children's Convalescent Home
tomorrow afternoon until the last of the entertainment is over at about 8:30,
there will be no time to think about classes. For that matter, there will be
no classes—the University will be given a half-holiday.
The fourth annual Labor Day will open when three lines of men, in semi
old clothing, begin to wend their way toward the old Stanford residence.
One line, under the guidance of Yell Leader Lou Minsky, will start from
Encina, while Dud DeGroot leads another down the Row from the Sigma Nu
house and the third leaves Sequoia hall. This curtain-raißer wlil be staged at
1 o'clock.

The University lost twelve gallons of gas last year in letting the motors idle
while the trucks waited at sorority houses for Sister Smith to Djer-Kiss her
nose. Hence the women will assemble tomorrow at 1:15 at the Corporation
Yard, where transportation to the home will be waiting. All members of the
Five Hundred are urgently prayed to attend, as their presence is absolutely
essential at one feature of the day's sport. The system of meeting at the yard

>will speed things up considerably.
A scene of devastation will await
the throng over at the battlefield.
Triumphant weeds are waving high in
the air, bushes and trees run rampant,
and there is always a fence to be torn
down. Just to revive the discouraged
hordes who gaze blankly upon the
scene of their coming labors, the Stan
ford Band will originate a few pre
liminary snuffles and the party will be
well started.
During the early part of the after
noon a bugle will assemble the crowd
for the laying of the cornerstone on
the new $35,000' building dedicated to
Mrs. Kate Dillon McLaughlin. The
program will last for about half an
hour and will follow the plan an
nounced in yesterday's paper.
The barbecue committee announccß
that living groups for men will be
asked to contribute $5 instead of the
$3 donation requested last year. The
1922 barbecue went in the hole, and it
is imperative that Labor Day pay for
expenses will be given to the Con
valescent Home.
With the cornerstone safely planted,
the perspiration will begin to flow. No
