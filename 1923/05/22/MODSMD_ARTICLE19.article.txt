# THRILLS AND SPILLS ARE PROMISED FOR R.O.T.C. FIELD DAY
## 
### 
Horse racing, jumping, steeplechasing,
polo stunts, and a horse show are all in
cluded on the program for the fourth
annual military tournament Saturday on
the highway polo field. Races that will
outdo the Kentucky derby are promised
by those in charge. Every event has a
large number of enthusiastic and con
fident riders entered. Five races arc
scheduled, namely, the half-mile flat
race, polo pony, Cossack, steeplechase,
and Roman race.
Jumping in all its forms will be tested
in the four obstacle topping events. First,
will be the military jumping as is act
ually encountered in military field ser
vice or artificially in fox hunting. The
pair jumping contest, in which the two
horses must clear the hurdles at the
same time, will follow the same course
as the military jumping. Thrills and
spills are to be looked forward to in the
high jump if past years' showings can
be taken as a criterion.
Two events on the program arc in
tended to show the horsemanship of the
fairer sex. These are the ladies' sad
dle race and ladies' jumping.
