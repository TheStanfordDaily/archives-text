# CLOSE SCORES ARE PREDICTED IN SWIM COMPETITION TODAY
## 
### 
Close scores should rule this after
noon in the annual intramural swimming
meet in Encina pool at 4:15. Although
an upset is possible, Phi Delta Theta is
conceded more than an even chance of
retaining the campus swimming cham
pionship and the Wideman trophy.
O'Connor, Fletcher, McHose, and Ed
wards are expected to do the-heavy work
for Phi Delta Theta. There is a pos
sibility of O'Connor establishing a new
campus 220 record, and of Fletcher
hanging up a new mark in the breast
stroke. Phi Delta Thetn captured the
trophy last year from Alpha Sigma Phi,
by presenting a well-rounded team, and
this year's combination should prove
even stronger than before.
Langley of Alpha Sigma Phi should
take first in the plunge and second in
the 220. Points by Greppin in the dashes
and a place in the relay should bring
Alpha Sigma Phi, title holder two years
ago, well to the front.
Of the other teams entered, Phi Kap
pa Psi is probably the strongest. Many
points should be split up among the
large field of entries.
