# TO PRESERVE THE NATURAL LINE OF CLEAVAGE
## 
### 
Occupation of Encina hall by freshmen next year
presents an opportunity for the establishment of a
rule that has long been contemplated by the under
graduate body. The purpose of the administration
in placing all first-year men together, just as the
first-yearâ€¢ women are made to live in one place, is
that they may best work out their destinies together.
It is thought that real class unity will be developed;
that each freshman will attempt to outdo his fellows
in all lines; that by isolating the first-year men they
will be forced to establish themselves securely in the
classrooms, on the athletic fields, in journalism, on
the stage and in all of the activities that we recognize
as part of a University career, before they will be
recognized by the older classes.
Will Not Need Automobiles
Therein lies the opportunity. The freshmen will
live together. There will be no need for automo
biles among them. They will be within easy walk
ing distance of everything on the campus. They will
have the car line at their door to take them off the
campus if it is necessary to go. Being a complete
unit in themselves, they will have no other objective
than to work out their own ends as best they can.
Present Freshmen Still Developing
Along these lines the present freshman class,
which will be the sophomore class of next season, is
still developing. Many of them are already in some
activity. There are others who will start in next
year. For this reason, and in order not to draw a
new line of cleavage between the classes, making the
freshmen the underclassmen and including the
sophomores with the present upperclassmen, it is
deemed advisable to apply the same rule in regard
to the operation and ownership of motor vehicles on
the campus to the sophomores.
Instead of driving cars around the campus they
will be carrying on the work that they started, or
beginning in the activities that they should have be
gun in their freshman year, so that when they be
come juniors they will be well established. Then
they may inherit the automobile-owning and auto
mobile-driving privilege, just as at present they in
herit the right to wear "cords."
