' "All damned foolishness —this Labor Day busi
ness," says the Campus Grouch. "Running around
all afternoon cluttering up the grounds of the Con
valescent Home and getting in each other's way or
being condemned as absolutely lacking in Stanford
spirit if we elect to stay away."
An attitude brought about, we would venture,
more by the fear of finding a little work to do than
by any very conscientious objection. Perhaps the
actual labor accomplished at the old Stanford home
on Labor Day does not amount to a great deal, but
even so, there are other advantages to the University,
and the student which can be cited as direct results
of the occasion. In the rush of studies, specialized
activities and social events, men and women have
little opportunity to get together except as little
groups and associations are bound to become nar
row. It is such events as the camp-fire meetings
which have preceded underclass fights, the guard
ing of the bonfire, and the University Labor Day
which bring together students of various interests
and allow them to get together in intimate contact.
It would be of interest to learn how many close
friendships and valuable associations have grown
out of the acquaintances which were made in this
way.
There arc many among us who would. probably
never know of the existence of the Stanford home
for unfortunate children were it not brought closclv
to them by the work on the grounds once each year.
Then, of course, food and a program of good
student entertainment is always a drawing card.
It is not so much a duty as it is a privilege to take
pari in the Labor Day activities tomorrow.
