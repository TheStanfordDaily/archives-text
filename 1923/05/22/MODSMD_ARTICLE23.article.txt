CALIFORNIA OVAL STARS
DEFEATED BEFORE START
(Special Untied Press Message)—BEOWAWE, Nev.,
May 15. —The cinder team from the University of Cali
fornia is defeated already, three thousand miles from
the scene of conflict. The Underworld Limited was
stalled, and the athletes lounged, mashed, and laid plans
to murder the train barber without a thought of the im
pending disaster. Then the conductor walked along the
roadbed beneath the Pullman windows. "Hey, you track
gang," he shouted. "Snap out of it —there's a wash-out
ahead. Picks and shovels in the baggage car!"
Their minds, befogged by constant poring over books,
groped aimlessly. Then one said slowly, "We must
incapacitate ourselves, brethren, in order to avoid this
humiliating toil." And so it was. They lie as one man
with their broken legs knitting, knitting, knitting. "Bet
ter a sweater than a sweat" they mumble sadly, and
keep on knitting.
* * •
If the Honor System applied to the House stores,
most of us would have to stop smoking. —WAMBA.

Man: Gosh —but my shoes are tight!
Her: Oh! So that's why your feet act so queer.

Prof: What is so rare. . . . Mr. Perkins?
Dormant Stu: Yes, yes-er-money from home.

THOSE DA! DA! BLUES
Don went to call on his woman the other day. As he
went in he heard the Vic playing "Why Dear." On the
table were a few to be played—including "Sweetheart,"
and "Remember the Rose."
Don knew the girl—and Don knew that some people
said it with flowers.
After he had gone, Marion went up to her room hum
ming "It's You" —so maybe Don said it with music—
maybe.

WISE BOY, JOHNNY
Johnny was a high school youth and had received his
first taste of liquor. It being the first time, he had not
taken too much and traveled home in good shape.
Johnny's father was solicitous of his welfare and asked,
"John, you've been smoking?"
"No, Father."
"John, you've been smoking."
"No, Father."
"John, you've been smoking. Let me smell your
breath."
"Yes, Father, I've been smoking."
• • •
His —I like a highbrow—
Her's —And I like a low neck.
# * *
AT $15 PER, YES
Hubby—That cook is forever and eternally burning
steaks.
Wifey—Even so, that's much cheaper than burning
coal. 6
MAD-DOGGERELS
The Justly-Famed Exams have come;
The Times are getting Ultra-Glum.
For Cash we hock the Textbook Tome
To Buy a Railway Ticket Home.
Who sowed the Dragon's Teeth of Ease,
Reaps now a Jason's Crop of E's.
And what of Connie, Ruth, and Chloe?
(Dear Girls Who want a Status Quo).
Will Profs, relenting, mark with Cheer
And bring Them Back another Year?
But if You Bone until You Bust
The Wily Bluebook Bites the Dust!

(Special Untied Press Message)—BEOWAWE, Nev.,
May 15. —The cinder team from the University of Cali
fornia is defeated already, three thousand miles from
the scene of conflict. The Underworld Limited was
stalled, and the athletes lounged, mashed, and laid plans
to murder the train barber without a thought of the im
pending disaster. Then the conductor walked along the
roadbed beneath the Pullman windows. "Hey, you track
gang," he shouted. "Snap out of it —there's a wash-out
ahead. Picks and shovels in the baggage car!"
Their minds, befogged by constant poring over books,
groped aimlessly. Then one said slowly, "We must
incapacitate ourselves, brethren, in order to avoid this
humiliating toil." And so it was. They lie as one man
with their broken legs knitting, knitting, knitting. "Bet
ter a sweater than a sweat" they mumble sadly, and
keep on knitting.

Don went to call on his woman the other day. As he
went in he heard the Vic playing "Why Dear." On the
table were a few to be played—including "Sweetheart,"
and "Remember the Rose."
Don knew the girl—and Don knew that some people
said it with flowers.
After he had gone, Marion went up to her room hum
ming "It's You" —so maybe Don said it with music—
maybe.

WISE BOY, JOHNNY
Johnny was a high school youth and had received his
first taste of liquor. It being the first time, he had not
taken too much and traveled home in good shape.
Johnny's father was solicitous of his welfare and asked,
"John, you've been smoking?"
"No, Father."
"John, you've been smoking."
"No, Father."
"John, you've been smoking. Let me smell your
breath."
"Yes, Father, I've been smoking."
