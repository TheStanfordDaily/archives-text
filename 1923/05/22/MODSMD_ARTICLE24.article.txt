# The
						Other Side Speaks

(Edtor's Note.—The Daily Palo Alto has no desire to
rush through any project without giving both sides due
consideration, hence the prominence given this contribution.
If there is any organised opposition to the proposed plan, it
would be zvise to attack the specific arguments advanced as
well as to generalise over the underlying motives of such
activity. Most of us react instinctively against any reform
but the only way to combat the reform, if zve resent it
seriously, is to meet squarely each point put forth by the
agitators.)
The haste with which the campus anti-automobile
legislation is being rushed through is quite instructive.
It shows what can be done by a small number of men
when they are convinced that they are qualified to act
for the great "unthinking majority." Their methods are
to be particularly commended to those who wish to be
reformers.
The first move is to become quite excited over the
importance of the project at hand; when this has been
accomplished anything that seems of value to "the
Cause," no matter how fantastic or beside the point,
may be stated in a loud and firm voice, with an air of
utter conviction. A number of organized zealots are
prepared to sweep everyone before them 011 the strength
of their own sense of virtue.
Their next move is to seize for their own some stirring
vocal banner, such as "Stanford Spirit" or "democracy."
This is blended with a fine maze of generalities, facts
being avoided where possible, and the crusade is on.
There can be but little opposition, since anyone who
might be inclined to resist their scheme is immediately
put out of action by the mere statement of fact that he
is a traitor not only to Stanford but also to his own
better instincts. The crusade from then on is a walk
away.
Of course, the situation is complicated somewhat if
anyone is possessed of any facts bearing 011 the subject.
But the present affair is free from such drawbacks; no
one is competent to speak in terms of anything but
generalities, because 110 one has made any study of
the situation in terms of fact.
