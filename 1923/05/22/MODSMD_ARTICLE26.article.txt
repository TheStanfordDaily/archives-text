# OAKLAND GIRL WINS EUPHRONIA DEBATING CONTEST SATURDAY
## 
### 
Miss Florence Thompson of Oakland
High School won first place in the pub
lic speaking contest held in the Little
Theater Saturday night under the au
spices of Euphronia debating society by
a unanimous decision of the judges.
Seven high schools were represented at
the contest and the winner received a
large cup, given by Euphronia, which will
remain in the hands of the first high
school to win it three successive years.
Irene Crosby of Sequoia Union High
School was second and F. Carrol of San
Jose High School, took third.
Miss Thompson spoke on the topic of
the recognition of Russia. She declared
that the United States should recognize
Russia whether or not she possessed a
stable government because recognition
would cause the rapid expansion of trade
with Russia and could not injure Amer
ican interests. Miss Crosby gave an ad
dress on the subject, "As others see
America," explaining the ideas European
countries possessed of the United States.
Carrol talked on the narcotic question,
urging that the sure means of abolishing
this growing evil was to do away with
the growth of opium and other drugs in
India.
The judges were Professors J. G.
Emerson, M. R. Kirkwood, and L. E.
Bassett. Percy Spencer, president of
Euphronia, acted as chairman. Other
high schools which sent representatives
were Polytechnic High School of San
Francisco, Santa Clara High School.
Palo Alto High School, and University
High School of Oakland.
