# Dean Culver Favors No Rushing Of Freshmen During First Quarter
## 
### 
"I am in favor of any system that
will get the freshman by his first quar
ter in the University without the ex
citement of rushing," said Dean Cul
ver yesterday in an interview on the
benefits of the proposed new rushing
system.
The plan provides for an isolation
period throughout the fall quarter,
during which no rushing at all will be i
allowed. During winter quarter rush
ing will be permitted only on week
ends and one date during the middle
of the week. Pledging will take place
during the spring quarter after an
other isolation period of a week.
Would Relieve Houses
Dean Culver believes that such a
system would be a tremendous relief
to the fraternities as well as to the
new men, since they would be relieved
of the hectic activities which the word
"rushing" implies. During the fall
quarter when there are so many other
distractions, the fraternities would be
entirely relieved of the distraction of
rushing. "The new plan would take
the rush out of rushing," Dean Culver
says.
Despite the fact that he is unques
tionably in favor of such a system,;
Dean Culver by no means believes
that it is perfect. "But," he says, "you
could not possibly get a system which
would be more disastrous than the old
one.
Freshman Thought Enlarged
"The new men will start to think in
in terms of the University and of the

class, rather than in terms of the living
group, as under the old plan. The fresh
man will realize that he really must
get out and do something for himself
and his University, because he will
know that throughout the year the
older men in college will be watching
him.
"Under the proposed plan, the schol
arship average of the fraternities
j would come up, because the first and
second quarter casualties would take
1 place in the freshman dormitory. The
j fact that the fraternity men would not
be bothered by rushing throughout a
large part of the year would allow
them to devote more time to scholastic
activities."
Problem in Other Colleges
Many colleges all over the country
i have been troubled with the problem
! of finding a sane method of fraternity
cultivation, rather than rushing, ac
cording to Dean Culver. "One of the
greatest questions has been the prob
lem of getting the freshman over the
hump in his first quarter, and to get
him adjusted to the conditions which
he has to meet at college, before he is
subjected to the distractions of fra
| ternity rushing."
