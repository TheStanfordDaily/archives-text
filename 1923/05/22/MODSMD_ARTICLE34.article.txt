# PROFESSOR WILDMAN TELLS OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS IN GERMANY
## 
### 
The depreciation of the value of the
German mark, the cost of German prod
ucts and the attitude of the German peo
ple toward France were topics discused
briefly in a recent letter from Murray
Shipley Wildman, professor of eco
nomics, who is touring Europe this year.
The letter was written from Munich,
Germany, where Professor and Mrs.
Wildman arrived April 15 from a visit
with their daughter Mary in Toulouse,
France. Jhe Wildmans left Germany
May 20 for England, where they will
stay until July 26.
In discussing prices in Germany, Pro
fesor Wildman says:"The Germans
have become wise and there are no bar
gains in anything that we care to buy.
Food is cheap, so are car fares and rail
way fares, but cloth, clothing, shoes,
and the like have all been marked up
and the quality is generally very poor.
"I am speaking for Munich only.
When we visit some smaller towns we
may find things otherwise. The people
are very bitter toward France, and it is
difficult to get them to talk of anything
else. If we complain that the room is
cold it is because France has cut off the
coal. If the milk for the coffee is hor
rible (and it always is) it is because
branee took all the cows. Germany to
day. as a national entity to be recokened
with, is a state of mind rather than an
area of land or a nnmber of peoples.
At least so it seems after a week in
Munich."
Professor Wildman stated tliat his
American dollars bring him 28,800 marks
apiece, and that he sold a ten-dollar bill
for over a quarter of a million marks.
When eating on the Speise wagon on the
train en route to Munich, Professor
Wildman was presented with a bill call
ing for 19,500 marks. He asked to pay
the bill in Swiss francs and handed the
waiter a five-franc piece. After a pro
longed conference at the end of the car,
the waiter returned and gave the diners
1,350 marks in change.
Professor Wildman wrote that he and
bis wife had a very interesting time in
Switzerland, stopping at Geneva, Zurich,
and Lucerne.
