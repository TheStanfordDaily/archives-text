# Hammer and Coffin Says Frosh Should See Stanford First
## 
### 
NOW THAT idea of restricting
lie use of cars on the campus to up-
Derclassmen is all right. Automobiles
lave a place on the campus, and those
Aho cast a longing eye back to the
joodoldays and sigh for Dobbin and
inpaved streets affect me like under
gone cauliflower. Autos have a place,
but that place is not under the per
sons of care-free frosh and last
years' headed for Woodside. It is
hard enough to get underclassmen ce
mented to the University, anyway;
perhaps if they are forced to gain
their perspective of this here institu
tion from the firm foundation of their
Dwn dainty feet, rather than from the
Imstable basis of cars likely to shoot
Dut from under them any moment,
the relations of the underclassmen
with the University would be more
permanent and do more good to Stan
ford.
However, I am open to persuasion
and if any frosh wants to demon
strate to me the harmlessness of his
Cadillac, he will find me most re
markably open-minded.
MIKE ELY,
President Hammer and Coffin.
