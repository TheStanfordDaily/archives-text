# AUSTRALIAN IP IS PUNNED FOR BOXERS
## Card Glove Team Will Meet Australian University Fighters in 1924 
### 
"The proposed trip of the Stanford
boxing team to Australia is an assured
fact," Harry Maloney, boxing coach,
said yesterday. He had just received a
letter from Dr. L. Utz, president of the
Australian Universities Sports Associ
ation, in which Dr. Utz urged the Stan
ford men to visit Australia.
Maloney has been working 'for some
time to make it possible for the Stan
ford men to take this journey and he
has succeeded in arousing enough in
terest in Australia to make it worth
while for the Stanford men. The pur
pose of the trip is to promote inter
national, intercollegiate sports, and to
create interest in boxing.
Firrt Planned for Summer
Maloney originally planned the trip
for this summer but was unable to get
into communication with the sports
association until yesterday. This was
due to the fact that Dr. Utz was visit
ing in South Africa and Maloney's
letter was forwarded there, with the
resultant loss of time. In his letter,
Dr. Utz was anxious to have the Stan
ford men come over this summer, but
Maloney feels that it is too late in the
season to start training. However, he
feels assured that the trip can be
taken during the summer of 1924.
The Board of Athletic Control favors
the plan and the Graduate Manager is
willing to let the team go. The trip
will be largely financed by the Austra
lians. The government there, which
controls the railroads, is expected to
give the Stanford men transportation,
and a number of wealthy Australian
sport enthusiasts have expressed their
intention of also assisting financially.
Chief among these is Jack Davis, edi
tor of the Sydney Referee, the largest
sporting journal in Australia. Davis
had pictures of the Stanford leather
pushers taken some time ago and pub
lished them in the Referee.
14 Boxers on Trip

and fourteen boxers. Seven weights
