# AUSTRALIAN IP IS PUNNED FOR BOXERS
## Card Glove Team Will Meet Australian University Fighters in 1924 
### 
"The proposed trip of the Stanford
boxing team to Australia is an assured
fact," Harry Maloney, boxing coach,
said yesterday. He had just received a
letter from Dr. L. Utz, president of the
Australian Universities Sports Associ
ation, in which Dr. Utz urged the Stan
ford men to visit Australia.
Maloney has been working 'for some
time to make it possible for the Stan
ford men to take this journey and he
has succeeded in arousing enough in
terest in Australia to make it worth
while for the Stanford men. The pur
pose of the trip is to promote inter
national, intercollegiate sports, and to
create interest in boxing.
Firrt Planned for Summer
Maloney originally planned the trip
for this summer but was unable to get
into communication with the sports
association until yesterday. This was
due to the fact that Dr. Utz was visit
ing in South Africa and Maloney's
letter was forwarded there, with the
resultant loss of time. In his letter,
Dr. Utz was anxious to have the Stan
ford men come over this summer, but
Maloney feels that it is too late in the
season to start training. However, he
feels assured that the trip can be
taken during the summer of 1924.
The Board of Athletic Control favors
the plan and the Graduate Manager is
willing to let the team go. The trip
will be largely financed by the Austra
lians. The government there, which
controls the railroads, is expected to
give the Stanford men transportation,
and a number of wealthy Australian
sport enthusiasts have expressed their
intention of also assisting financially.
Chief among these is Jack Davis, edi
tor of the Sydney Referee, the largest
sporting journal in Australia. Davis
had pictures of the Stanford leather
pushers taken some time ago and pub
lished them in the Referee.
14 Boxers on Trip
The trip will be made by Maloney
and fourteen boxers. Seven weights
will be represented, and there will be j
an extra man in each class, so that if
one of the boxers is injured the Stan
ford team will still be complete. The
team will meet the universities at
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and
Queensland, and will probably stage
several exhibitions. It is strictly under
stood that the Stanford men will meet
her than representing a
Jo amateur boxers repre
-3 or athletic associations j
ed to meet the Stanford
men.
Maloney has planned the trip to take
all summer, and as summer in the
United States is the winter season in
Australia, the men will get a chance
to see Australian winter sports which
include rugby, soccer, and Australian
ball. Boxing is growing in popularity
in the Australian schools. It was in
troduced two years ago, and Maloney
hopes, by his proposed trip, to place it
on a firmer basis both here and there, j
If the plans for the sending of the
boxing team to Australia are success-'
ful, Maloney will try and arrange for
the sending of a soccer team to China
and Japan. He has already started ne-j
gotiations With athletic clubs from
Singapore to Yokahoma and expects
to have definite information on the
plan soon.

resultant loss of time. In his letter,
Dr. Utz was anxious to have the Stan
ford men come over this summer, but
Maloney feels that it is too late in the
season to start training. However, he
feels assured that the trip can be
taken during the summer of 1924.
The Board of Athletic Control favors
the plan and the Graduate Manager is
willing to let the team go. The trip
will be largely financed by the Austra
lians. The government there, which
controls the railroads, is expected to
give the Stanford men transportation,
and a number of wealthy Australian
sport enthusiasts have expressed their
intention of also assisting financially.
Chief among these is Jack Davis, edi
tor of the Sydney Referee, the largest
sporting journal in Australia. Davis
had pictures of the Stanford leather
pushers taken some time ago and pub
lished them in the Referee.
14 Boxers on Trip
The trip will be made by Maloney
and fourteen boxers. Seven weights
will be represented, and there will be j
an extra man in each class, so that if
one of the boxers is injured the Stan
ford team will still be complete. The
team will meet the universities at
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and
Queensland, and will probably stage
several exhibitions. It is strictly under
stood that the Stanford men will meet
her than representing a
Jo amateur boxers repre
-3 or athletic associations j
ed to meet the Stanford
men.
Maloney has planned the trip to take
all summer, and as summer in the
United States is the winter season in
Australia, the men will get a chance
to see Australian winter sports which
include rugby, soccer, and Australian
ball. Boxing is growing in popularity
in the Australian schools. It was in
troduced two years ago, and Maloney
hopes, by his proposed trip, to place it
on a firmer basis both here and there, j
If the plans for the sending of the
boxing team to Australia are success-'
ful, Maloney will try and arrange for
the sending of a soccer team to China
and Japan. He has already started ne-j
gotiations With athletic clubs from
Singapore to Yokahoma and expects
to have definite information on the
plan soon.
"The proposed trip of the Stanford
boxing team to Australia is an assured
fact," Harry Maloney, boxing coach,
said yesterday. He had just received a
letter from Dr. L. Utz, president of the
Australian Universities Sports Associ
ation, in which Dr. Utz urged the Stan
ford men to visit Australia.
Maloney has been working 'for some
time to make it possible for the Stan
ford men to take this journey and he
has succeeded in arousing enough in
terest in Australia to make it worth
while for the Stanford men. The pur
pose of the trip is to promote inter
national, intercollegiate sports, and to
create interest in boxing.
Firrt Planned for Summer
Maloney originally planned the trip
for this summer but was unable to get
into communication with the sports
association until yesterday. This was
due to the fact that Dr. Utz was visit
ing in South Africa and Maloney's
letter was forwarded there, with the
resultant loss of time. In his letter,
Dr. Utz was anxious to have the Stan
ford men come over this summer, but
Maloney feels that it is too late in the
