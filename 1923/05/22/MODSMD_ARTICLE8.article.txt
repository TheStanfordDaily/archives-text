# ROTH PRAISES INITIATIVE OF STUDENTS IN CAR PROBLEM
## Alumni Sanction Proposed Plan Forbidding Autos To Underclassmen Great Increase in Machines Has Impaired Stanford Democratic Spirit 
### 
"If the proposed amendment to the
student constitution, providing for the
prohibition of automobiles from the
hands of underclassmen, goes through,
It will be the most wonderful thing
that has ever happened to Stanford,
particularly since students themselves
Initiated the measure.
"It will be the most conclusive evi
dence yet presented that student con
trol is an actual potent fact in Stan
ford life. Student control will have
proved itself an unqualified success."
This is the opinion of Comptroller
Roth, '09, as expressed in an interview
this morning.
Speaking, not as a University of
ficial, but as a former student of Stan
ford, Roth endorsed whole-heartedly
the proposed amendment to the con
stitution.
Stanford Benefitted
"If the measure passes, there will
be an immediate and great benefit for
Stanford in the world outside. The
automobile question has long been one
of the most difficult questions con
fronting most of the universities in
the country. And to think that Stan
ford students were successful in cop
ing with the problemâ€”there is no
question but that it will have a lot of
good for this University."
Alumni also unanimously voice their
approval of the amendment, according
to Roth. "And the mothers and fathers
of the students will, I am sure, accept
the measure with pleasure, for It will
solve a problem which they too have
undoubtedly found extremely difficult
to solve.
"The undergraduate at Stanford has
no legitimate use for the automobile,"
Roth maintained, "When a student is
engaged in his regular academic work
and also in some form of student ac
tivity, most of the time is already oc
cupied. The car is only an excuse to
get away from the campus and into
trouble."
Democracy Has Been Impaired
Stanford democracy has been seri
ously impaired ever since the advent
of the automobile on the Stanford
campus, Roth said. After describing
the days when he was an
body will do a great deal of work, but
the 1000 students expected will ac
complish volumes of results just the
same. The task will be attacked sys
tematically, with certain men assigned
to definite jobs and the women doing
the white-collar share of it. During all
this time the band will be working as
hard as the rest, and will doubtless
stir up quite a breeze to help the gar
deners forget the heat waves.
At 5:30, a bugler will promote
something much like a mess-call, and
ate, the wholesome feeling of demo
cracy which existed among the stu
dents which made it impossible to tell
which student had means, and which
did not, Roth continued: "It is foolish
ness to believe that the machine does
not create barriers in democracy.
There ARE barriers created, and this
fact cannot be doubted. And then im
agine a freshman touring around the
campus in a car which cost several
thousand dollars!"
Enforcement Meaures
The proposed measure, if passed,
would be enforced through the Student
Council. "Special notices might be
sent all prospective students and all
parents of such students, informing
them that such a rule exists at Stan
ford. By this method, a good deal of
the evil could be stopped at the very
source. And when freshmen are once
on the campus, it would be compara
tively easy to find immediately anyone
who owns and operates a car. Since
Encina will be a freshman dormitory,
first-year men cannot escape from the
ruling. Underclassmen who drive up to
Stanford from Los Angeles will have
to park their cars in Palo Alto.
"The upperclassmen have gone into
this with a great deal of feeling, and
if the measure passes, they will see
that it is enforced. We may even have
campus cars registered if this will
help," Roth said.
"Anyway, it would be a triumph for
student control, and the best and most
useful thing which student control has
yet accomplished."
