NO HALF-WAY
BUSINESS FOR ME
P'r'aps you remember mother
telling me that every day is
somebody's birthday, and to say
it with Wilson's. Well, that
started me thinking.
Graduation time is coming at the
schools and colleges, and I know
so many sweet graduates (girl
and otherwise) that I've been
worried gray about remem
brances.
I3ut now the skies are clear. I'm
going to express my sentiments
with Wilson's candy. There are
so many lovely assortments —
and everybody likes candy —
especially Wilson's.
