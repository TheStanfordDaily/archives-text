## Director Cohan Will Choose Cast Tonight; Technical Managers Named 
### 
"The Hottentot," a three-act farce by
Victor Mapes and William Collier, has
been selected by the senior play com
mittee for the 1923 class presentation,
to be offered the evening of the last
day of examinations, June 13. A. D.
Cohan, director of the show, will
choose the cast tonight, and announce
ment will be made in tomorrow's Daily
Palo Alto.
Played Entire Season
With "Willie" Collier in the lead as
"Sam Harrington," the"The Hotten
tot" played in New York the entire
season of 1920 to 1921. It was judged
the triumphant comic success of the
year. For sheer humor and entertain
ment the farce, in its stage version,
is one of the best written in the last
four years.
The first presentation of the play,
with the exception of the "tryout" in
the Apollo Theater of Atlantic City,
New Jersey, was given March 1, 1920,
at the George M. Cohan Theater, New
York. "The Hottentot" ran for two
months last summer in Los Angeles at
the Majestic Theater. "Sam Harring
ton," the male lead, was played by
Edward Everett Horton; the female
lead was carried by Mary Newcomb.
Stage Veralon Superior to "Movie"
The movie version of "The Hotten
tot," with Douglas McLean in the lead,
appeared several months ago in Palo
Alto. The comic farce of the screen
' Hottentot" is unfavorably comparable
to that in the stage farce, which is
replete with laughable lines that are
lost on the screen.
The following were successful in
passing the preliminary trials Monday
and Tuesday. These persons are ex
pected to appear this afternoon at the
Green room in the English building,
where final tryouts will be held. Cohan
will piek the cast from among this
number tonight;

"The Hottentot," a three-act farce by
Victor Mapes and William Collier, has
been selected by the senior play com
mittee for the 1923 class presentation,
to be offered the evening of the last
day of examinations, June 13. A. D.
Cohan, director of the show, will
choose the cast tonight, and announce
ment will be made in tomorrow's Daily
Palo Alto.
Played Entire Season
With "Willie" Collier in the lead as
"Sam Harrington," the"The Hotten
tot" played in New York the entire
season of 1920 to 1921. It was judged
the triumphant comic success of the
year. For sheer humor and entertain
ment the farce, in its stage version,
is one of the best written in the last
four years.
The first presentation of the play,
with the exception of the "tryout" in
the Apollo Theater of Atlantic City,
New Jersey, was given March 1, 1920,
at the George M. Cohan Theater, New
York. "The Hottentot" ran for two
months last summer in Los Angeles at
the Majestic Theater. "Sam Harring
ton," the male lead, was played by
Edward Everett Horton; the female
lead was carried by Mary Newcomb.
Stage Veralon Superior to "Movie"
The movie version of "The Hotten
tot," with Douglas McLean in the lead,
appeared several months ago in Palo
Alto. The comic farce of the screen
' Hottentot" is unfavorably comparable
to that in the stage farce, which is
replete with laughable lines that are
lost on the screen.
The following were successful in
passing the preliminary trials Monday
and Tuesday. These persons are ex
pected to appear this afternoon at the
Green room in the English building,
where final tryouts will be held. Cohan
will piek the cast from among this
number tonight;
