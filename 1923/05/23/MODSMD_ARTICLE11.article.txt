# POLITICAL POT BOILS AS SPECIAL ELECTION IS CALLED TO REPEAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT
## HUNEKE, BRINKMAN, LAPP, TRAGO ARE CHOSEN Petition Presented To Executive Committee Brings Matter to Crisis; Move Is Criticized In Session By Heated Debate 
### Ballotboxer 
Several big splashes occurred in political circles today and one of the biggest
of these was caused by the little slip of paper which the Rally Committee dropped
into the iron box near the Law steps. For the campus is alu>ays interested in
that incarnation of spirit popularly known as the Yell Leader.

The Rally Committee has recom
mended to the student body the fol
lowing candidates for head yell leader:
Newton Brinkman, Al Huneke, Burt
Lapp, and Gene Trago.
Regular tryouts were held for those
desiring to become candidates and the
ualiqflcations of all of them discussed
thoroughly. The four nominees were
selected on the basis of personality,
presence while leading yells and the
mechanical motions, and popularity.
Any one of the men is fully capable
of handling the job, assefts the com
mittee.
Rally Committee Message
"Forget the group distinctions of the
candidates, and elect a man you'll
want to get behind and yell for. You
want a leader whose personality seems
able to muke a living thing of the
Stanford Spirit—one who doesn't have
to pull a yell out of you. He need not
be an executive since the Rally Com
mittee next year will have charge of
all rallies, and make the necessary ar
rangements." This is the urgent mes
sage of the Rally Committee.
In regard to the nominees, Al
Huneke and Burt Lapp have been
prominent this year as assistant yell
leaders, while the frequent stage ap
pearances of Gene Trago are well
known. Newton Brinkman was one of
the high-vote candidates for assistant
yell leader when Minsky and Douglas
were # chosen.
Sophomores Will Appear
Next year the present sophomore as
sistants who were not chosen junior
assistants will have an opportunity to
try out again before the Rally Com
mittee, which is now composed of Ed
Butler, chairman; Dud DeGroot, Chet
Douglas, Louis Minsky, Bob Connolly,
Lane Falk, Alice Roth, Eunice Biddle,
Jim Davis, "Bud" Woodward, Claude
Peavy and "Nip" McHose.

As a result of a petition presented
to the Executive Committee last night,
a special election will be held Friday,
May 25. to vote on the recent action of
the committee in regard to the selec
tion of yell leaders. The question to
be submitted to the student body will
be:
"The following action of the Execu
tive Committee of the A. S. S. U. pro
viding for the election of yell leader
shall be repealed—
"i.e. Any member of the (then)
upper classes shall be eligible for yell
leader upon recommendation of the
Rally Committee.
"A vote of yes or no shall be taken
on this question and a two-thirds ma
jority of the vote cast shall be neces
sary for the repeal to be effective "
Ruling Stated Unfair
The petition presented to the Execu
tive Committee last night stated that
the ruling was unfair to the assist
ant yell leaders. Under the rule, pro
vision is made for a Rally Committee
whose candidates are placed before
the student body at the spring general
election on the same basis as the two
assistants.
The petition was signed by the mem
bers of two organizations on the cam
pus and the man presenting »t said
that their purpose was to back one of
(he present assistant yell leaders If
the Executive Committee action is re
pealed, the two candidates nominated
by 11 e Rally Committee will not com
pete against the present assistants.
This would assure the petitioners'
candidate of election, since only one
fraternity man and no other candidate
'vould be in the running.
"Unfairness" Question Considered
The Executive Committee argued
that since the position of yell leader
was one of concern to the entire stu
dent body, the choice should rest on
merit and not the political affiliation
of any candidate or any consideration
of questions of personal injustice. It
was pointed out that the action of the
Executive Committee followed several
months' discussion of the entire yell
leader problem. Opinions were so
licited on all sides of the proposed
change; the question of the unfairness
to the present assistants was consid
ered, but it was concluded that the
benefit resulting from the ruling coun
terbalanced a possible injustice to one
man.
"Campus Politics" Revealed
It was shown that had other than
"campus politics" motivated the pe-
I titioners an appeal would have been
made to the Executive Committee im
mediately after the action was taken.
The petitioners were ostensibly aware
of the fact that even should the special
election go against them, no one man
out of the four candidates for yell
leader could possibly get the majority
needed for his election. Therefore a
second special election would have to
be held to choose between the two
men getting the highest number of
votes at the general election.
The two organizations who are back
ing one of the present assistants know
that if they turn out for this final elec
tion their candidate will win easily.
It is hard enough to get the student
body out for a general election—a spe
cial election doesn't create a murmur
of interest.
The Executive Committee feels that
the two organizations presenting the
petition have assured the unpopularity
of the next yell leader by precipitating
a fight savoring of personal politics
just prior to the general election.
Real Purpose Admitted
After his initial statement of the
nominal reason for petitioning for a
repeal of the new ruling, the delegate
from the two organizations said that
their real purpose was to get one of
the present assistant yell leaders
elected, regardless of whether or not
he is the man best fitted for the job.
It was granted that the two. assistants
have put in much time and effort dur
ing the past year, but the Executive
Committee feels that merit and not
seniority should determine the future
yell leader. The discussion was en
tirely frank and the petition for a spe
cial election was admitted to - be a po
litical move # in favor of the petitioners'
candidate.

Several big splashes occurred in political circles today and one of the biggest
of these was caused by the little slip of paper which the Rally Committee dropped
into the iron box near the Law steps. For the campus is alu>ays interested in
that incarnation of spirit popularly known as the Yell Leader.

The Rally Committee has recom
mended to the student body the fol
lowing candidates for head yell leader:
Newton Brinkman, Al Huneke, Burt
Lapp, and Gene Trago.
Regular tryouts were held for those
desiring to become candidates and the
ualiqflcations of all of them discussed
thoroughly. The four nominees were
selected on the basis of personality,
presence while leading yells and the
mechanical motions, and popularity.
Any one of the men is fully capable

mittee.
Rally Committee Message
"Forget the group distinctions of the
candidates, and elect a man you'll
want to get behind and yell for. You
want a leader whose personality seems
able to muke a living thing of the
Stanford Spirit—one who doesn't have
to pull a yell out of you. He need not
be an executive since the Rally Com
mittee next year will have charge of
all rallies, and make the necessary ar
rangements." This is the urgent mes
sage of the Rally Committee.
In regard to the nominees, Al
Huneke and Burt Lapp have been
prominent this year as assistant yell
leaders, while the frequent stage ap
pearances of Gene Trago are well
known. Newton Brinkman was one of
the high-vote candidates for assistant
yell leader when Minsky and Douglas
were # chosen.
Sophomores Will Appear
Next year the present sophomore as
sistants who were not chosen junior
assistants will have an opportunity to
try out again before the Rally Com
mittee, which is now composed of Ed
Butler, chairman; Dud DeGroot, Chet
Douglas, Louis Minsky, Bob Connolly,
Lane Falk, Alice Roth, Eunice Biddle,
Jim Davis, "Bud" Woodward, Claude
Peavy and "Nip" McHose.

As a result of a petition presented
to the Executive Committee last night,
a special election will be held Friday,
May 25. to vote on the recent action of
the committee in regard to the selec
tion of yell leaders. The question to
be submitted to the student body will
be:
"The following action of the Execu
tive Committee of the A. S. S. U. pro
viding for the election of yell leader
shall be repealed—
"i.e. Any member of the (then)
upper classes shall be eligible for yell
leader upon recommendation of the
Rally Committee.
"A vote of yes or no shall be taken
on this question and a two-thirds ma
jority of the vote cast shall be neces
sary for the repeal to be effective "
Ruling Stated Unfair
The petition presented to the Execu
tive Committee last night stated that
the ruling was unfair to the assist
ant yell leaders. Under the rule, pro
vision is made for a Rally Committee
whose candidates are placed before
the student body at the spring general
election on the same basis as the two
assistants.
The petition was signed by the mem
bers of two organizations on the cam
pus and the man presenting »t said
that their purpose was to back one of
(he present assistant yell leaders If
the Executive Committee action is re
pealed, the two candidates nominated
by 11 e Rally Committee will not com
pete against the present assistants.
This would assure the petitioners'
candidate of election, since only one
fraternity man and no other candidate
'vould be in the running.
"Unfairness" Question Considered
The Executive Committee argued
that since the position of yell leader
was one of concern to the entire stu
dent body, the choice should rest on
merit and not the political affiliation
of any candidate or any consideration
of questions of personal injustice. It
was pointed out that the action of the
Executive Committee followed several
months' discussion of the entire yell
leader problem. Opinions were so
licited on all sides of the proposed
change; the question of the unfairness
to the present assistants was consid
ered, but it was concluded that the
benefit resulting from the ruling coun
terbalanced a possible injustice to one
man.
"Campus Politics" Revealed
It was shown that had other than
"campus politics" motivated the pe-
I titioners an appeal would have been
made to the Executive Committee im
mediately after the action was taken.
The petitioners were ostensibly aware
of the fact that even should the special
election go against them, no one man
out of the four candidates for yell
leader could possibly get the majority
needed for his election. Therefore a
second special election would have to
be held to choose between the two
men getting the highest number of
votes at the general election.
The two organizations who are back
ing one of the present assistants know
that if they turn out for this final elec
tion their candidate will win easily.
It is hard enough to get the student
body out for a general election—a spe
cial election doesn't create a murmur
of interest.
The Executive Committee feels that
the two organizations presenting the
petition have assured the unpopularity
of the next yell leader by precipitating
a fight savoring of personal politics
just prior to the general election.
Real Purpose Admitted
After his initial statement of the
nominal reason for petitioning for a
repeal of the new ruling, the delegate
from the two organizations said that
their real purpose was to get one of
the present assistant yell leaders
elected, regardless of whether or not
he is the man best fitted for the job.
It was granted that the two. assistants
have put in much time and effort dur

second special election would have to
be held to choose between the two
men getting the highest number of
votes at the general election.
The two organizations who are back
ing one of the present assistants know
that if they turn out for this final elec
tion their candidate will win easily.
It is hard enough to get the student
body out for a general election—a spe
cial election doesn't create a murmur
of interest.
The Executive Committee feels that
the two organizations presenting the
petition have assured the unpopularity
of the next yell leader by precipitating
a fight savoring of personal politics
just prior to the general election.
Real Purpose Admitted
After his initial statement of the
nominal reason for petitioning for a
repeal of the new ruling, the delegate
from the two organizations said that
their real purpose was to get one of
the present assistant yell leaders
elected, regardless of whether or not
he is the man best fitted for the job.
It was granted that the two. assistants
have put in much time and effort dur
ing the past year, but the Executive
Committee feels that merit and not
seniority should determine the future
yell leader. The discussion was en
tirely frank and the petition for a spe
cial election was admitted to - be a po
litical move # in favor of the petitioners'
candidate.

Several big splashes occurred in political circles today and one of the biggest
of these was caused by the little slip of paper which the Rally Committee dropped
into the iron box near the Law steps. For the campus is alu>ays interested in
that incarnation of spirit popularly known as the Yell Leader.

The Rally Committee has recom
mended to the student body the fol
lowing candidates for head yell leader:
Newton Brinkman, Al Huneke, Burt
Lapp, and Gene Trago.
Regular tryouts were held for those
desiring to become candidates and the
ualiqflcations of all of them discussed
thoroughly. The four nominees were
selected on the basis of personality,
presence while leading yells and the
mechanical motions, and popularity.
Any one of the men is fully capable
of handling the job, assefts the com
mittee.
Rally Committee Message
"Forget the group distinctions of the
candidates, and elect a man you'll
want to get behind and yell for. You
want a leader whose personality seems
able to muke a living thing of the
Stanford Spirit—one who doesn't have
to pull a yell out of you. He need not
be an executive since the Rally Com
mittee next year will have charge of
all rallies, and make the necessary ar
rangements." This is the urgent mes
sage of the Rally Committee.
In regard to the nominees, Al
Huneke and Burt Lapp have been
prominent this year as assistant yell
leaders, while the frequent stage ap
pearances of Gene Trago are well
known. Newton Brinkman was one of
the high-vote candidates for assistant
yell leader when Minsky and Douglas
were # chosen.
Sophomores Will Appear
Next year the present sophomore as
sistants who were not chosen junior
assistants will have an opportunity to
try out again before the Rally Com
mittee, which is now composed of Ed
Butler, chairman; Dud DeGroot, Chet
Douglas, Louis Minsky, Bob Connolly,
Lane Falk, Alice Roth, Eunice Biddle,
Jim Davis, "Bud" Woodward, Claude
Peavy and "Nip" McHose.

As a result of a petition presented
to the Executive Committee last night,
a special election will be held Friday,
May 25. to vote on the recent action of
the committee in regard to the selec
tion of yell leaders. The question to
be submitted to the student body will
be:
"The following action of the Execu
tive Committee of the A. S. S. U. pro
viding for the election of yell leader
shall be repealed—
"i.e. Any member of the (then)
upper classes shall be eligible for yell
leader upon recommendation of the
Rally Committee.
"A vote of yes or no shall be taken
on this question and a two-thirds ma
jority of the vote cast shall be neces
sary for the repeal to be effective "
Ruling Stated Unfair
The petition presented to the Execu
tive Committee last night stated that
the ruling was unfair to the assist
ant yell leaders. Under the rule, pro
vision is made for a Rally Committee
whose candidates are placed before
the student body at the spring general
election on the same basis as the two
assistants.
The petition was signed by the mem
bers of two organizations on the cam
pus and the man presenting »t said
that their purpose was to back one of
(he present assistant yell leaders If
the Executive Committee action is re
pealed, the two candidates nominated
by 11 e Rally Committee will not com
pete against the present assistants.
This would assure the petitioners'
candidate of election, since only one
fraternity man and no other candidate
'vould be in the running.
"Unfairness" Question Considered
The Executive Committee argued
that since the position of yell leader
was one of concern to the entire stu
dent body, the choice should rest on
merit and not the political affiliation
of any candidate or any consideration
of questions of personal injustice. It
was pointed out that the action of the
Executive Committee followed several
months' discussion of the entire yell
leader problem. Opinions were so
licited on all sides of the proposed
change; the question of the unfairness
to the present assistants was consid
ered, but it was concluded that the
benefit resulting from the ruling coun
terbalanced a possible injustice to one
man.
"Campus Politics" Revealed
It was shown that had other than
"campus politics" motivated the pe-
I titioners an appeal would have been
made to the Executive Committee im
mediately after the action was taken.
The petitioners were ostensibly aware
of the fact that even should the special
election go against them, no one man
out of the four candidates for yell
leader could possibly get the majority
needed for his election. Therefore a
second special election would have to
be held to choose between the two
men getting the highest number of
votes at the general election.
The two organizations who are back

merit and not the political affiliation
of any candidate or any consideration
of questions of personal injustice. It
was pointed out that the action of the
Executive Committee followed several
months' discussion of the entire yell
leader problem. Opinions were so
licited on all sides of the proposed
change; the question of the unfairness
to the present assistants was consid
ered, but it was concluded that the
benefit resulting from the ruling coun
terbalanced a possible injustice to one
man.
"Campus Politics" Revealed
It was shown that had other than
"campus politics" motivated the pe-
I titioners an appeal would have been
made to the Executive Committee im
mediately after the action was taken.
The petitioners were ostensibly aware
of the fact that even should the special
election go against them, no one man
out of the four candidates for yell
leader could possibly get the majority
needed for his election. Therefore a
second special election would have to
be held to choose between the two
men getting the highest number of
votes at the general election.
The two organizations who are back
ing one of the present assistants know
that if they turn out for this final elec
tion their candidate will win easily.
It is hard enough to get the student
body out for a general election—a spe
cial election doesn't create a murmur
of interest.
The Executive Committee feels that
the two organizations presenting the
petition have assured the unpopularity
of the next yell leader by precipitating
a fight savoring of personal politics
just prior to the general election.
Real Purpose Admitted
After his initial statement of the
nominal reason for petitioning for a
repeal of the new ruling, the delegate
from the two organizations said that
their real purpose was to get one of
the present assistant yell leaders
elected, regardless of whether or not
he is the man best fitted for the job.
It was granted that the two. assistants
have put in much time and effort dur
ing the past year, but the Executive
Committee feels that merit and not
seniority should determine the future
yell leader. The discussion was en
tirely frank and the petition for a spe
cial election was admitted to - be a po
litical move # in favor of the petitioners'
candidate.
