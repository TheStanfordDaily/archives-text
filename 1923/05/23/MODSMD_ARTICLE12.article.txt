# ANNUAL LABOR DAY IS HELD FOR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE SPRING
## 
### 
The fourth annual Labor Day, held at
the Children's Convalescent Home this
afternoon and evening, is a development
of the old plan whereby eight sopho
mores went to the Home each Saturday
and did the work now accomplished in a
few hours by most of the student body.
As the amount of work to be done in
creased and became more complicated,
the sophomores were unable to handle
it, and in 1920 the students decided to
set one day each year when the under
graduates would turn out en masse and
combine business with pleasure.
The Children's Convalescent Home
was established in 1919 in the old Acacia
House on the County Road. This loca
tion proved to be unsuitable, and in June,
1920, the institution removed to the old
Stanford residence, where it is still situ
ated. Under the patronage of Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins, Mrs. Payson J. Treat,
and others, the Home has constantly
been expanding and Mrs. Henry J.
Crocker's gift of $35,000 will add an
other twenty-bed unit to the present
plant. The cornerstone of this building,
dedicated to the memory of Mrs. Kate
Dillon McLaughlin, was laid this after
noon. Twenty-seven acres of land are
used by the Home.
Labor Day has since been made more
attractive through the development of a
barbecue and a program of entertain
ment after the work was finished. Last
year over a thousand students turned
out, cleaning up weeds, dead wood, and
other debris which had accumulated dur
ing the past interval.
It has become customary for sororities
to make up several dozen sandwiches as
their contribution to the barbecue, and
the living groups for men donate a small
sum of money. No meals arc served ex
cept at the Home and in the public din
; ing rooms on the campus, and classes
are dismissed for the afternoon.
