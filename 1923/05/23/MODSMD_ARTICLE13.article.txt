# Passing Automobilists Enjoy Daily Practice of Horse Show Entrants
## 
### 
Passing automobilists have been view
ing the daily practice on the highway
polo field of the entrants in the Fourth
Annual Military Tournament and Horse
Show, which will start Saturday at 1
p. m.
The track on which the races will be
run has been made by removing the
side hoards at each end of the polo field,
and in consequence the horesmanship
of the riders as they hold their mounts
close to the inside of the curve can be
closely watched by occupants of automo
biles stopped just off the highway.
Horses and riders are becoming more
familiar with each other and with the
track, and the mounts are "breezed"
around the oval or worked out in short
sprints. The riders in the Roman and
Cossack races are affording the greatest
amusement and thrill. There are four
entrants for the Roman race, which will
be run with the entrant standing erect
with one foot on the back of each of his
two horses. In the Cossack race the
rider stands erect in the saddle of his
mount after the fashion of the wild
cavalry of the Russian steppes.
The jumping and saddle classes for
both men and women are coming in for
their share of interest, and though not
as spectacular as the races, more skill,
training, and co-ordination of horse and
rider is demanded. The jumping course
and saddle class ring are directly in
front of the polo clubhouse, and bores,
bleachers, and automobile parking space
arc being constructed and marked out
for the accommodation of the public.
