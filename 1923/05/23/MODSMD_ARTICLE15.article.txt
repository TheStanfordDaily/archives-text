# "UNFAIR"
## 
### 
It is doubtful whether any consideration whatever
should be given to a petition when its is
admittedly to secure the election of a single man to
a student-body office. But since those who are en
deavoring to repeal the by-law providing for the
election of yell leader included the phrase "unfair"
in their communication to Executive Committee, we
may dispose of that point.
Even if we were willing to admit any unfairness
in a system which allowed any man in the student
body to compete for a student-body office, that
should hardly bear much weight when there is*the
welfare of the University as represented in the
bleachers to be considered.
The argument has been advanced that allowing a
candidate, to enter the field without first having gone
through a year's tryout as assistant would discourage
any effort toward securing the position until the last
minute and would lower the yell leader's standing as
a student officer. But if a man proves his worth
conclusively as assistant throughout the year there
is little danger of a dark horse stepping in and
taking the job away from him. The petition pre
sented last night is a very open indication of lack of
confidence in the man for whom it was framed,
which is just as unfair to him as any regulation
which permits other members of the student-body to
.run in open election.
Of course both assistant yell leaders have worked
all year, but upon that basis both should be elected
in order to be perfectly fair. When voting for a
man to lead the rooting sections in our athletic con
tests, there are other things besides hurting an as
pirant's feelings to be considered.
The student-body can lose nothing by refusing to
repeal the by-law at Friday's election. The two
present yell-leader assistants will still be on the
ballot and the man who deserves the position will
get it. There is much less chance for politics to
operate in an unrestricted field than there would be
if the desire of a partisan faction were fulfilled by
restricting the candidates to the two assistants.
