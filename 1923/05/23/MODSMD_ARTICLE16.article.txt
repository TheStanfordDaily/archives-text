# OUR SITUATION IS DIFFERENT

### 
Those who oppose the amendment for the prohibi
tion of ownership and operation of motor-driven
vehicles by underclassmen point out that it is another
case of personal restriction. They point to Harvard
as a university where a man may live without regula
tion of any kind. There, they say, he survives or
perishes without aid or interference from anyone,
and, they point out, Harvard continues pre-eminent
in all of its activities.
In advancing this argument they lose sight of
the fact that Stanford is restricted to begin with by
lack of facilities. Its student body is of necessity
limited. Its scholarship standards are of necessity
high and so are its entrance requirements. Stanford
has for its greatest competitors two universities
which outnumber it almost three and four to one. If
it* is to carry on as it did before the war when
automobiles were the uncommon instead of the com
mon vehicle for student pleasure it must make use
of every unit of its student body. It cannot afford
to waste a single man, as Harvard, California, and
even the University of Southern California arc
able to do, because of their great numbers.
The Lesson We Teach
In the case of two freshmen who, because they
had complete entrance requirements, were promising
athletes, and were recommended from their local
high schools as leaders/and whose university demise
was traced directly to the fact that they lived in
Palo Alto and owned a bear cat, the opposition points
out that they learned a lesson; that one of them will
return to the University next fall a much better man
for his first year experience.
The University has been deprived of the services
of these two men for one year. They have been
deprived of the benefits of a university education

which includes associations as well as classroom
exercises for one year. One of them will return, and
the belief is he will demonstrate that he has learned
his lesson well. The other one will not return. Vet
he was just as promising as his companion. Is that
the kind of lesson this University wants to teach?
And in the meantime our neighboring universities
are taking advantage of us while we teach our
freshmen and sophomores these ruinous lessons.
In the home the child is taught the things that
will make him a useful member of society. lie is
taught to sacrifice certain things for the good of the
family. Upon the completion of his home and public
school education he comes to the University to fit
himself for life. For the first time he is away from
home, and not always does he know how to handle
his interests in his new surroundings.
Must Take Care of Individual
In a large university he either makes good or
doesn't, and nobody much cares. In a university
that is limited in numbers but which is proud of its
successes that individual owes a certain duty to his
fellows and to his university, and somebody does
care. If there are certain obstacles in the way of his
making good the new society which he has just
entered should see that they are removed. Discipline
of the kind in vogue at Stanford for some years has
been done away with for just that reason. The
newcomers will he placed together in one living unit
to enable them better to get started properly. The
automobile is recognized as one of the barriers to
his ultimate success here. Are we to remove it or
arc we to continue to teach lessons like the above
and sacrifice one of every two or three men who are
unable to learn quickly how to get the most out of
their classrooms, their activities, and their general
college life?
