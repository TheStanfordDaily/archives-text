SHOE, FLY!
A parable in one pair—all bull
Once there was a race which went bare-footed, and
they had no sins worth mentioning. There were no
blind tigers, and life was not worth living. Everbody
was goody-good, so no one even got credit for being
good. Gad's adze, but it was terrible!
Epilogue
Once somebody got curious and began to wander. He
soon discovered a blind tiger just across the internation
al line, and took all his friends over. Pretty soon their
feet were so tough they didn't notice the absence of
shoes at all. Then this shoe-less race was just as
happy as the rest of the world.
