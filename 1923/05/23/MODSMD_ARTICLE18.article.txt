(Stanford women arc invited to express their opinions in
this column. Communications should be addressed to Ruth
Mcßride, Campus.)
The Rushing Problem! It has so many ideas that it
approaches a circle. H. G. W. presents some pungent
sentences forthwith:
"Roble Club ought to have stringent rules for fresh
women —for studying and stepping I mean. Under the
new rushing system there is no enforceable scholarship
standard for first year women. No one short of p psy
chopathic inferior would deny that the year rushing
system is a vast improvement over the Pell-Mell style
of past ages. The new women gain greatly by a year's
residence with the other members of their class.
"But there is no restraining hand upon stepping when
their grades are low. They flit gayly and gladly about
every night in the week from movie to Clubhouse dance,
from dance to Lagunita. Meanwhile Econ syllabus and
Biology text lie unmolested on Roble desks.
"Of course when stifling smoke-ups come there are
penitent attemps at reform and Roble lights will burn
late upon the well-resolved. ... for about a week. And
then that page in the book of good resolutions somehow
flies back and the youngsters are at it again with
renewed zest.
"The freshwomen themselves admit that something is
wrong. A delicious young lady of the class of twenty
six, recently pledged, said to me in great distress, yes
terday, 'The House allows me only two dates a week
now! My whole constitution is upset. I'm not used to it.
It's all so drastic all at once. Stepping is a habit, I
guess, and one shouldn't reform suddenly. Why DIDN'T
we have scholarship rules when we first came? My two
quarters of "pro" do embarrass me now. I know that I
could have done better if I had HAD to.'
"There is the whole problem stated with typical fresh
man brevity. It is a nice one for Women's Council and
Roble Club. A little action, please!"

X. Y v Z. takes a few parting shots at the Feminine-
Conversation-at-Stanford discussion. According to X. Y.
Z.'s harsh final statement Stanford women are not
representative modern American women! Refutation!
Refutation!!
"The average Stanford woman may be real beneath
the crust of carefully applied sophistication and artificial
sweetness but she manages to conceal it well. It seems
the fashion now to appear as blase and worldly-wise as
possible.
"Nor are the men free from the same attempt at
sophistication. It is very good sport to watch the
average college man try to appear a man of the world.
An air of nonchalance and a little forceful swearing to
give the right effect is an essential part of this amusing
pose. He is anxious to impress the women with his
wonderful line. Fearing to appear ridiculous a girl is
afraid of employing anything more serious than the
usual college small talk. Because of this mutual decep
tion serious conversation is impossible even when both
feel the need of it. It simply is not done.
"In spite of this there are a few real girls who do not
attempt to be what they are not. They are absolutely
natural an dunaffected and friendly to everyone. They
do not excite any jealousy being fair and square with
their friendships with men and are not gossiped about
behind their backs in undertones. Although this type
is likely in the minority at Stanford it is the most truly
representative of modern American womanhood."
