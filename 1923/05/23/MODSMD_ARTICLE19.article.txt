# That Special Election
## 
### 
Should fair >play rule student body !
elections? That is the problem before
the Stanford student body today. At the
special election Friday we are to de- I
termine whether or not the tryoutee
system shall continue to exist at Stan
ford.
We have the tryoutee system in vogue
in practically all student activities. The
candidates for editor and manager of
the Quad, for editor and manager of the
Daily Palo Ai.to, athletic managers, and
yell leader were all chosen by this sys- :
tem previous to this year. Early in April
a ruling was adopted by the Executive
Committee whereby candidates for yell
leader can be nominated without being
endorsed by the tryoutee system.
Now if the entire system is wrong it ;
would seem that it should be abolished |
for all student activities rather than one. ;
But at present the candidates for yell
leader have been discriminated against. '
They have been singled out from the |
group and other students have been al
lowed to run who have not been through !
the mill of ihe tryoutee system and have
not been in that way approved as candi- j
dates by the student body.
The tryoutee system is good. Men who
are willing to put in a year's work for a
position arc certainly those who think
a position is worth the effort necessary
to get it. They will, therefore, put their
very best efforts into the position and ,
make it one of value. But now we are 1
proposing to let others run against them
\\ ho did riot think the position of suffi
cient wortli to merit their efforts to se- I
cure it by working a year to be a candi- j
date. Tt would surely seem that there is I
no way in which the student body can
judge their ability to fill the position.
On the other hand we do do know the
ability of the tryoutee candidates.
These candidates were willing to stand
on their ability as demonstrated before
the student body. The Rally Committee
which has the power to nominate the
other candidates had the power in April
to hold a student assembly and place
their candidates before the student body.
They did not do it. And yet these men
who have worked, and worked hard, for
the past year, were willing to put this j
year's work up against one afternoon's j
competition against these untried candi- J
dates. So far these candidates have not j
been nominated. The student body docs :
not know who they will be.
Are we to be continually kept in the |
dark? Although having a month's time
the Rally Committee did not put any
candidates before the student body for j
approval. As a result the election Friday
is to determine whether or not the Stan- j
ford student body wishes to allow last- \
minute candidates of whom we know
nothing, as to their ability, to run for the
position of Stanford Yell Leader. If the
petition is adopted we will vote only on
the men who have passed the tryoutee
system. These men we know. The others :
who would otherwise run we do not'
know. So the question for the Stanford
Student Body to determine is that of
fair play. Shall we tell two men who J
have worked a year that we have the
right to run untried candidates against
them or shall we support our tryoutees
system which is used in the other lines
of student activities? Logic would seem
to indicate that the tryoutee system
would in the vast majority of cases give
the right man. But what logic can be
advanced to show that the right man
will be found by an arbitrary choice of
a few members of the student body.
