If new anti-auto plan goes
through as is what is going to happen
to the transfers? The "six quarters on
the campus" clause is certainly a hum
way of expressing the restriction. And
also, "summer quarters not counting"
throws a monkey wrench into some of
our ambitions. Certainly a man who
sticks six consecutive quarters is as
much entitled to a car as the man
who pokes along with two or three
quarters' work every year.
I think a huge injustice is being
done, if this amendment is passed as
it now stands. Personally, I am a mix
ture of the above two cases, and so
shall not be a car until af
ter I graduate.
Though it be an infinitely small loss
to the Campus, I for one, will not re
main on this Campus after the above
rule goes into effect. And, more im
portant still, I feel that Stanford will
be deluged with an influx of students
who are being sent to "school" for a
College education.
""'Allowed" —doesn't it sound so-o-o
much like dear old Prep school:?
