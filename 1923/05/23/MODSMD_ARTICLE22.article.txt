# SKULL AND SNAKES FAVORS AMENDMENT ON AUTO OWNERSHIP
## Templeton, Maloney, Advocate Restriction of Use of Campus Machines 
### 
Skull and Snakes stands heartily in
favor of the proposed amendment to the
constitution which will restrict the use
of cars on the campus to upperclassmen.
Speaking in behalf of Skull and
Snakes, Bob Cravens, '23, president of
that organization, said that he believed
the passage of such a measure would go
a long way toward the settlement of the
freshmen discipline problem next year.
"Because all first-year men will be
living in the same hall, discipline would
lie even more difficult to enforce if
freshmen were permitted to own and
drive cars all over the campus and
wherever they might wish," says Cravens.
"A great deal of this trouble could, I
believe, l»e eliminated through the pro
hibition of cars to these students. Skull
and Snakes heartily endorses the
measure."
Templeton Favors Amendment
"Stanford's athletic situation would be
a whole lot better if underclassmen were
not permitted to own and operate auto
mobiles." So spoke Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton in an interview yesterday.
"Cars Waste Time"
"There are many students on the cam
pus who own cars and waste valuable
time in touring about the campus and
elsewhere," Templeton continued. "Think
of the benefit which would come not
only to themselves, but also to their
University, if they would but discard
such useless pursuit, and spend their
spare time in some form of student
activity.
"I do not mean to say that all students
who own cars whittle away their time
in this fashion. But I do know that there
are many who, if they did not possess a
car, might come out for athletics and
make good.
Abolition Has Advantages
"The abolition of the car from the
hands of underclassmen at Stanford is
something which would do this Uni
versity a lot of good. More of their
number would turn out for activities, I
believe, merely because they no longer
have motor cars in which to waste their
time. The more who report for ath
letics, the stronger is Stanford's chances
to be the 'big bug' in the athletic firma
ment."
Maloney in Favor
Coach Maloney is also in favor of the
proposed plan. The question of en
forcement is one of the most evident
advantages of the system, and because
of this, the soccer coach is willing to
back it.
Here is what Coach Harry Maloney
had to say on the same thing: "I cer
tainly believe that athletics would hi
assisted by the passage of such a meas
ure. for if cars were prohibited from
underclassmen, more students would
turn to activities in their spare time."

| It has l>een suggested that notices be
sent to all prospective students, inform
ing them of the existence of such a rule
in this University. This would stamp
out the undesirables before they could
have the chance of even seeing Stanford.
Special campus registration of machines
might also be used. By this method, the
owner of every car would be known, and
violators of the "Honor System in Car
Ownership" could easily be found.
Control Committee Approves
The Senior Control Committee has
unanimously approved the proposed
limitation of machines on the campus.
L. B. MINSKY, Chairman.
"The proposed amendment to the A.
S. S. U. constitution, prohibiting under
classmen from using automobiles on the
campus, should receive the hearty sup
port of every student in the University."
So speaks A1 Masters, '23, president of
the Senior Class.
"This amendment will greatly assist
in building up the democratic spirit at
Stanford, and will give the new student
a better chance to find himself," says
Masters. "Instead of jumping into his
machine and going for a ride, as is often
the case now, the freshman will be found
out on the athletic field or in some other
line of student activity.
"Let's get behind this proposition and
solve an important problem on the cam
pus," Masters urges.

mobiles." So spoke Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton in an interview yesterday.
"Cars Waste Time"
"There are many students on the cam
pus who own cars and waste valuable
time in touring about the campus and
elsewhere," Templeton continued. "Think
of the benefit which would come not
only to themselves, but also to their
University, if they would but discard
such useless pursuit, and spend their
spare time in some form of student
activity.
"I do not mean to say that all students
who own cars whittle away their time
in this fashion. But I do know that there
are many who, if they did not possess a
car, might come out for athletics and
make good.
Abolition Has Advantages
"The abolition of the car from the
hands of underclassmen at Stanford is
something which would do this Uni
versity a lot of good. More of their
number would turn out for activities, I
believe, merely because they no longer
have motor cars in which to waste their
time. The more who report for ath
letics, the stronger is Stanford's chances
to be the 'big bug' in the athletic firma
ment."
Maloney in Favor
Coach Maloney is also in favor of the
proposed plan. The question of en
forcement is one of the most evident
advantages of the system, and because
of this, the soccer coach is willing to
back it.
Here is what Coach Harry Maloney
had to say on the same thing: "I cer
tainly believe that athletics would hi
assisted by the passage of such a meas
ure. for if cars were prohibited from
underclassmen, more students would
turn to activities in their spare time."

| It has l>een suggested that notices be
sent to all prospective students, inform
ing them of the existence of such a rule
in this University. This would stamp
out the undesirables before they could
have the chance of even seeing Stanford.
Special campus registration of machines
might also be used. By this method, the
owner of every car would be known, and
violators of the "Honor System in Car
Ownership" could easily be found.
Control Committee Approves
The Senior Control Committee has
unanimously approved the proposed
limitation of machines on the campus.
L. B. MINSKY, Chairman.
"The proposed amendment to the A.
S. S. U. constitution, prohibiting under
classmen from using automobiles on the
campus, should receive the hearty sup
port of every student in the University."
So speaks A1 Masters, '23, president of
the Senior Class.
"This amendment will greatly assist
in building up the democratic spirit at
Stanford, and will give the new student
a better chance to find himself," says
Masters. "Instead of jumping into his
machine and going for a ride, as is often
the case now, the freshman will be found
out on the athletic field or in some other
line of student activity.
"Let's get behind this proposition and
solve an important problem on the cam
pus," Masters urges.
Skull and Snakes stands heartily in
favor of the proposed amendment to the
constitution which will restrict the use
of cars on the campus to upperclassmen.
Speaking in behalf of Skull and
Snakes, Bob Cravens, '23, president of
that organization, said that he believed
the passage of such a measure would go
a long way toward the settlement of the
freshmen discipline problem next year.
"Because all first-year men will be
living in the same hall, discipline would
lie even more difficult to enforce if
freshmen were permitted to own and
drive cars all over the campus and
wherever they might wish," says Cravens.
"A great deal of this trouble could, I
believe, l»e eliminated through the pro
hibition of cars to these students. Skull
and Snakes heartily endorses the
measure."
