Will the time come when students will
take aptitude tests upon entering college
to determine their ability as journalists,
stenographers, bookkeepers, or in other
lines of work?
Professor Lewis M. Terman of the
Psychology department believes that
there is the possibility of such a develop
ment in the aptitude tests which are yet
in the experimental stage.
"Aptitude tests," says Professor Ter
man, "are recent innovations. As yet
the only tests of this kind are the ones
testing musical, mathematical, and jour
nalistic ability, which have been worked
out within the last few years. The value
of these tests cannot be estimated at the
present time because they have so re
cently been introduced.
"The musical test was the first to be
worked out. It is now used in grammar 1
schools to test the musical ability of the
pupils. Phonograph records are the
means by which the children are tested,
and for tone quality, pitch, and rhythm.
It is interesting to note that knowledge
of music has no effect upon the outcomes
of the tests, for children who have never
studied music often pass with higher
scores than those who have."
