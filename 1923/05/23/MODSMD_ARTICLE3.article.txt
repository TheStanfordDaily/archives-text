# FIVE MEN WILL WORK OUT AS STAGE HANDS
## 
### 
Five men responded last evening to
Sam Mendenhall's call for tryoutees for
stage managerial positions on the cam
pus. They were Herbert Hoover, Jr.,
Richard Friedlandcr, Robert Cook, Ho
mer Dombaugh, and Julian Wright.
These men will assist in the direction of
the University Day student entertain
ment.
The program for this year will in
clude three distinct shows, and will be
more elaborate than several Ram's Head
productions. There will be entertainment
at Mrs. Wilbur's luncheon, in the court
of the Union, and the main show at the
banquet in the basketball pavilion will
last for three or four hours.
Mendenhall announces that any other
underclassmen who arc interested in this
work may speak to him and be taken on.
