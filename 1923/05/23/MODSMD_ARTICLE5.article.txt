## 
### 
Two more teams were eliminated
from the race for the intramural base
ball championship yesterday when
Sigma Alpha Epsilon defeated Theta
Xi 10-6, and Sigma Nu took a hard
fought game from El Cuadro by a
13-8 score.

across the plate. Maillot, the Theta
Xi hurler, held the S. A. E.'s helpless
for four innings, but the strain was
too great and he blew up in the fourth
inning. Sigma Alpha Epsilon started
their scoring machine and made a few
runs on their own account. Things

inning they allowed S. A. E.'s five
markers. The score kept going up, and
at the end of the seventh Sigma Alpha
Epsilon had ten runs to the 'six that
Theta Xi garnered.

runs on their own account. Things
went bad for Theta Xi, and in the sixth
inning they allowed S. A. E.'s five
markers. The score kept going up, and
at the end of the seventh Sigma Alpha
Epsilon had ten runs to the 'six that
Theta Xi garnered.
Summy Hurls Good Ball
Summy pitched a consistent game
for the winers and he granted only
five hits to Theta Xi. At the bat he
further distinguished himself by mak
ing four hits in five journeys to the
plate. As a whole the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon team played a well-balanced
brand of ball, but a few errors by
both sides marred an otherwise ideal
game
Sigma Alpha Epsilon succeeded in
making 13 hits off Maillot. Maillot
pitched a good game against Alpha
Delta Phi Monday but in yesterday's
contest he lacked the control that
marked his previous victory. He walk
ed five men.
In the other deciding game, Sigma
Nu walloped El Cuadro in a fast seven
inning contest which was Sigma Nu's
from the second inning on. Seven runs
were made in the first two frames,
and Sigma Nu was never in danger of
being headed after that. Thede knock
ed Robinson, the El Cuadro pitcher,
for two homers and a single. In the
fatal second inning the Sigma Nus
batted around once, making six mark
ers. There was little difficulty in find
ing Robinson's delivery, and 16 hits
were made off him during the game.
Fast Field Work Wins
Aydelotte and Dwight each took a
turn at twirling, and they were both
hit for five safeties. Sigma Nu showed
superior field work. They made only
two errors, while El Cuadro made six.
Superior fielding and ability to lo
cate Robinson's offers showed Sigma
Nu's real strength in yesterday's play
off.
Two more teams were eliminated
from the race for the intramural base
ball championship yesterday when
Sigma Alpha Epsilon defeated Theta
Xi 10-6, and Sigma Nu took a hard
fought game from El Cuadro by a
13-8 score.
Theta Xi started their steam roller
going the first frame, and pushed a run
across the plate. Maillot, the Theta
Xi hurler, held the S. A. E.'s helpless
for four innings, but the strain was
too great and he blew up in the fourth
inning. Sigma Alpha Epsilon started
their scoring machine and made a few
runs on their own account. Things
went bad for Theta Xi, and in the sixth
inning they allowed S. A. E.'s five
markers. The score kept going up, and
at the end of the seventh Sigma Alpha
