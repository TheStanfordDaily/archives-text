fended the intramural swimming cham
pionship yesterday afternoon in Encina
pool. An overwhelming score of 42
points enabled the Phi Delts to retain
the Wideman trophy.
Phi Kappa Psi, the nearest com
petitor, scored twenty points. Alpha
Sigma Phi took third, with ten points.

Theta team. He scored fourteen points
in all, taking first in the 220 and hun
dred, second in the fifty, and fourth in
the plunge for distance.
Rolland Langley, Alpha Sigma Phi,
and Charles Fletcher, Phi Delta Theta,
each accounted for ten points. Langley
took first in the plunge, second in the
220 sand fourth in the backstroke and
hundred. Fletcher captured first in the
breastftroke and backstroke.
Varsity Relay Record Smashed
The relay was won by Phi Delta
Theta, in 1:05.2, faster than the pres
ent varsity record. This was made pos
sible by the presence of Ackerman and j
O'Connor of the freshmen, on the win
ning team. Phi Delta Theta assumed
rhe lead at the first, and were never in
danger, winning by a big margin.
A surprise came in the diving when
Gibbons, junior P. A. A. title-holder,
defeated Snedden, holder of the title
in top form, and failed to register with
the judges. None of the diving was
exceptional.
Ackerman Wins Fifty-Yard Race
The fifty-yard sprint was captured
by Ackerman, with O'Connor a close
second. The time, 26.1, is exceptionally
fast. Ackerman, star freshman sprint
er this year, should prove good varsity
material next year.
O'Connor won the hundred with a
mark of 1:02.3. While this is fast
t:me, he did not even push himself to
make it, finishing easily.
The 66 2-3 breaststroke and back
stroke races were won by Fletcher
with times of 51 flat, and 49 flat, re
spectively. Fletcher was not hard
pressed, and finished as eh pleased.
O'Connor captured his favorite
event, the 220, in the slow time of
2:51.4. Langley, the second man, was
twenty feet behind at the finish. Dris
coll and Draper staged a pretty race
for fourth, Driscoll winning by a mat
ter of inches at the tape.
The plunge for distance was taken
by Langley with a mark of 58 feet.
This distance was good, considering
