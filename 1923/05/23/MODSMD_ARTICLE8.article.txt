# CO-OPERATION OF ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE NEED OF WORLD TODAY, SAYS PROFESSOR MIMS
## 
### 
"The need of the world today is the
proper co-operation of the two branch
es of English-speaking people," said
Professor Edwin Mims of Vanderbilt
University in discussing "The Fight
for Idealism in America" in a lecture
given last night in the Little Theater.
"There are two well-defined forces
that divide the world," declared Pro
fessor Mims. "On the one hand there is
worldliness, indifference, cynicism.
The worst of these is indifference. On
the other hand there is some well
balanced optimism, faith, courage,
hope, and idealism.
"Think in Terms of Science"
"Modern men think in terms of
science and interpret the facts of
science in a way that causes the feel
ing of insignificance of mankind. The
dramas, plays, and novels emphasize
heredity and environment. Psychology
has become the study of animal be
havior.
"Famous men of science realize the
importance of the spiritual interpreta
tion of the facts of science, and the re
cent scientific discoveries break down
the veil that separates the visible
world from the invisible."
Critics Make Four Indictments
Professor Mims declared that critics
complained of four main indictments.
First, Puritanism, which they compare
to a red flag that is waved in the face
of Americans, is the enemy of art.
culture, and social refinement. The
critics believe that the only hope of
America is to break with the Puritan
ism of the past.
Second, that the American people
are pioneers who have been reduced
to a life of narrow limits and have

been starved from lack of education
and culture.
Third, that the wealthy class domi
nates society, that money is not used
for the highest purposes, and crushes
the love of the finer things of life.
Fourth, that the United States is
dominated by Anglo-Saxon ideas of life
and culture. Americans, the critics
claim, must throw away these stupid
English ways of looking at life.
Mims Criticizes the Critics
In objecting to these indictments of
the critics Professor Mims said, "The
letter of Puritanism must be aban
doned, but the spirit of the Puritan,
and the love of progress can be ap
plied to the standards of the new era.
"Shall we abandon the endurance,
daring, resourcefulness of the pioneer?
No.
"As for the materialism of American
business, we must use wealth for the
promotion of human welfare, institu
tions of learning, and to further hu
man progress."
Three Types of "Small-Town Men"
Professor Mims spoke on the com
munity life of America, and discussed
the recent novels that portrayed the
worst side of life in a small town.
"There are three types of men in the
small communities," said Professor
Mimr>. "The man who disapproves of
the town and leaves; the citizen who
approves of the community and does
nothing to better it; and the man who
loves his home town and helps toward
its improvement."
Professor Mims is head of the Eng
lish department at Vanderbilt. He has
spent the winter in lecturing at the
California Institute of Technology.

complained of four main indictments.
First, Puritanism, which they compare
to a red flag that is waved in the face
of Americans, is the enemy of art.
culture, and social refinement. The
critics believe that the only hope of
America is to break with the Puritan
ism of the past.
Second, that the American people
are pioneers who have been reduced
to a life of narrow limits and have

been starved from lack of education
and culture.
Third, that the wealthy class domi
nates society, that money is not used
for the highest purposes, and crushes
the love of the finer things of life.
Fourth, that the United States is
dominated by Anglo-Saxon ideas of life
and culture. Americans, the critics
claim, must throw away these stupid
English ways of looking at life.
Mims Criticizes the Critics
In objecting to these indictments of
the critics Professor Mims said, "The
letter of Puritanism must be aban
doned, but the spirit of the Puritan,
and the love of progress can be ap
plied to the standards of the new era.
"Shall we abandon the endurance,
daring, resourcefulness of the pioneer?
No.
"As for the materialism of American
business, we must use wealth for the
promotion of human welfare, institu
tions of learning, and to further hu
man progress."
Three Types of "Small-Town Men"
Professor Mims spoke on the com
munity life of America, and discussed
the recent novels that portrayed the
worst side of life in a small town.
"There are three types of men in the
small communities," said Professor
Mimr>. "The man who disapproves of
the town and leaves; the citizen who
approves of the community and does
nothing to better it; and the man who
loves his home town and helps toward
its improvement."
Professor Mims is head of the Eng
lish department at Vanderbilt. He has
spent the winter in lecturing at the
California Institute of Technology.
"The need of the world today is the
proper co-operation of the two branch
es of English-speaking people," said
Professor Edwin Mims of Vanderbilt
University in discussing "The Fight
for Idealism in America" in a lecture
given last night in the Little Theater.
"There are two well-defined forces
that divide the world," declared Pro
fessor Mims. "On the one hand there is
worldliness, indifference, cynicism.
The worst of these is indifference. On
the other hand there is some well
balanced optimism, faith, courage,
hope, and idealism.
"Think in Terms of Science"
"Modern men think in terms of
science and interpret the facts of
science in a way that causes the feel
ing of insignificance of mankind. The
dramas, plays, and novels emphasize
heredity and environment. Psychology
has become the study of animal be
havior.
"Famous men of science realize the
importance of the spiritual interpreta
tion of the facts of science, and the re
cent scientific discoveries break down
the veil that separates the visible
world from the invisible."
