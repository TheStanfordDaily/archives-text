# SPECIAL ELECTION TOMORROW WILL DECIDE FATE OF YELL LEADER NOMINATION AMENDMENT
## Arguments Stated THOSE FAVORING REPEAL ASSERT RISK WILL BE TOO GREAT 
### Ballotboxer 
.1 special election ivill be held tomor«
row to vote on the recent action of the
Executive Committee in regard, to the
selection of yell leader. The question is:
"The following action of the Exein
tive Committee of the A. S. S. U. pro
riding for the clertion of yell leader
shall be repealed—
"ie. Any member of the (then) upper
classes shall be eligible for yell leader
■upon recommendation of the Rally Com
mittee.
"A vote of yes or no shall be taken
on this question, and a two-thirds ma
jority of the vote cast shall be necessary
for the repeal to be effective."

After hearing the arguments of the
opposing sides in the political embroglio
precipitated by the special election to
morrow, the whole upshot of the matter
seems to be this:
Those putting up the petition for the
amendment to the constitution by-laws
admit that the Rally Committee system
of nominating yell leaders is a good one,
but they say that the system ought to be
held over this year, and put in effect
next year, rather than to allow an
untried man to become head yell leader
in place of men who have worked all
year.
Their main objection seems to be that
they "do not believe that any committee
has the right to take the responsibility
of judging the candidates for the whole
student body. Their power should be
to suggest the men so that the students
could judge by actual performance of
the tryoutees. This year the student
body has had no notice of anything the
Rally Committee has done."
In refutation of these arguments the
Rally Committee says:
"Thfre was natural timidity among
those who wished to try out, because of
the newness of the system, which was
established this quarter. This not doubt
delayed their decision, and made it im
possible for the Rally Committee to de
termine who were qualified for the po
sition in time to get a large amount of
publicity before the students.
"Dissatisfaction Expressed"
"However, a large number of students
have expresed their dissatisfaction with
the present assistants, and it seemed only
right that if this number should possibly
constitute a majority of the rooters, they
should be given an opportunity to get
behind the leader they want to yell for.
The assistants have a fair chance all
during the year to show their ability as
a yell leader, and if one or the other
is elected this year this will only
strengthen the system, since it will show
that he has used his opportunity to put
himself in solid with the student body."
In reply to the argument that it is not
fair to the present assistants to allow a
new man to run for the position,, the
committee says that "it is unfortunate
that the assistants felt at the beginning
of the year that they would l>c he only
two candidates for head yell leader, but
this does not seem sufficient to make the
tryoutee system inoperative, eves for
this year. Their work before the rooting
section has not been a mere mechanical
doing of work, hut has l>een also a dis
play of personality and ability, and their
control over the rooting section should
be judged accordingly."
Want Trial First
Briefly, then, those initiating the
amendment object to last-minute candi
dates running for yell leader, without

previous trial before the student body;
and the Rally Committee answers this
by saying that the assistants have a fair
opportunity to demonstrate their fitness
to be head yell leader, and if neverthe
less the majority of the rooters want a
different man to hold the position, they
should have the right to elect him.
Some criticism has been made that
the story on the Executive Committee
in last night's Daily was an editorial
comment appearing in the news col
umns. The opinion of the Executive
Committee as expressed in the discus
sion was presented and it was con
sidered obvious that the statements in
the Daily were a resume of this dis
cussion, and not editorial comment.
If the present amendment is passed it
is clear that one of the two assistants
will be made head yell leader, and if re
jected, it means that one of the new
candidates will be elected. Therefore
those wishing to vote for yell leader
should express their views tomorrow.
