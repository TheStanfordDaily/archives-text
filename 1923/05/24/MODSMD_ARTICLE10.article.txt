# STUDENTS JOIN IN WITH ED LAMB TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL LABOR DAY BLAZE
## NEW ANNEX IS DEDICATED Food, Program, Dance, Fire, Complete Afternoon of Student Gardening 
### 
Labor Day fulfilled every promise
and threw in a fire for good measure.
The unexpected blaze burned away
about 200 feet of bulkhead along the
high banks of San Francisquito creek,
and was regrettable but not dangerous.
Parties started drifting from the
campus toward the Home shortly after
one o'clock yesterday afternoon, and
with the aid of the University fleet of
trucks the number of workers was
brought to about 1100< students —the
largest turn-out in history. They were
divided into seven gangs and immedi
ately set to work grubbing out trees,
clearing off the playground, cleaning
straw from the fields, and performing
various odd jobs. The women slicked
up the orchard and rose-garden.
Cornerstone Laid
At 2:45 a bugle assembled the crowd
at the foundation of the new $35,000
unit, donated in memory of a close
friend of Mrs. Stanford, by Mrs. Henry
J. Crocker. After brief talks by Dr.
Gardner, Professor C. D. Marx, Mrs.
Payson J. Treat, and Phil Landis, Mrs.
Crocker applied the mortar, and the
cornerstone of the new edifice was set.
In the stone was a copper box contain
ing personal effects and relics of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin, to whom the
building is dedicated. Mrs. Hopkins is
known as "the Fairy Godmother of
the Children's Home." After the crowd
had sung "Hail, Stanford, Hail," Lou
Minsky announced that about half
the work had been finished, and the
audience scattered to complete the
jobs.
Head Gardener Pleased
Under the direction of Walter Alex
ander, Fred Loomis, Herbert Dwight,
Orville ' Tucker, Norman Anderson,
Claude Peavy, Don Liebendorfer, A1
Masters, Bob Wright, Fred Anderson,
and others, the cleaning up moved
swiftly and smoothly, and Otto Ny
quist, head gardener, says that the
students accomplished half again as
much as he had expected.
Phil Landis and Sam McDonald were
the most-talked-of men on the grounds
for the next hour. They offered some
thing very nice in the way of barbe
cues, and when the ravenous mob had
finished there wasn't enough left to
feed the committee that dished out the
food. Remarks were frequently heard
to the effect that if they were wise
they had gotten in on it beforehand,
so the chances are that nobody went
home hungry. Several portions of
meat, pickles, sandwiches, pork-and
beans, cookies, ice cream, and coffee
took both the ache and the void out
of the poetic combination.
Grinstead's Music Proves Hit
The hit of the day caijfte after din
ner. Grinstead's orchestra called the
banqueters over to the lawn of the
home, where a huge canvas was
stretched tightly on the ground. After
a coy interval the guests accepted the
invitation, and the canvas held, at
times, as many as 90 couples. This was
the first time that the Labor Day pro
gram had included a dance, and its
success should make it a fixture.
A trio from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house put on a curtain-raiser, with
closer harmony than is found even in
our best barber shops. The "Fall River
Blues," and an extremely well-chosen j
selection from"A Boy's Best Friend i
Is His Mother" were especially well
received by the tired busineses men!
and women. Arnold Bayley and j
"Chick" Midgley were next on the bill,
and Bayley's interpretations of various j
campus characters were better than
ever. The home run of the evening
was "I Love Me," sung by Bayley with
Midgley at the Steinway. There wasn't
a dry eye in the house.
Ed Lamb Appears
During this song Eddie Lamb came
dynamiting down the road in his new
Seagrave, and a column of smoke rose
over the trees. It was found that a
huge pile of hay, thrown oyqr the bank
of the creek earlier in the day, had in
some way caught fire, and the heavy
wooden bulkhead protecting the road
at this point was already burning furi
ously. The auxiliary pumping engine
of the truck yielded plenty of pres
sure, and two lines playing on the I
blaze soon had it under control, about i
twenty volunteer student firemen as
sisting Lamb. The damage will amount j
to about $1000.
Specialty acts by Dorothy Daliler,!
Ted Van Deusen, and Gardner Lippin
cott concluded the entertainment, and
the crowd danced until eight o'clock, i
The following committees had
charge of the arangements:
General —Ed Butler, general chair
man; Pete Crandall, finances.
Transportation —Newton Brinkman,
Howell Smith, Charles McAllister.
Entertainment — Homer Mitchell,
Edythe Baylis, David Mannoceir, Her

closer harmony than is found even in
our best barber shops. The "Fall River
Blues," and an extremely well-chosen j
selection from"A Boy's Best Friend i
Is His Mother" were especially well
received by the tired busineses men!
and women. Arnold Bayley and j
"Chick" Midgley were next on the bill,
and Bayley's interpretations of various j
campus characters were better than
ever. The home run of the evening
was "I Love Me," sung by Bayley with
Midgley at the Steinway. There wasn't
a dry eye in the house.
Ed Lamb Appears
During this song Eddie Lamb came
dynamiting down the road in his new
Seagrave, and a column of smoke rose
over the trees. It was found that a
huge pile of hay, thrown oyqr the bank
of the creek earlier in the day, had in
some way caught fire, and the heavy
wooden bulkhead protecting the road
at this point was already burning furi
ously. The auxiliary pumping engine
of the truck yielded plenty of pres
sure, and two lines playing on the I
blaze soon had it under control, about i
twenty volunteer student firemen as
sisting Lamb. The damage will amount j
to about $1000.
Specialty acts by Dorothy Daliler,!
Ted Van Deusen, and Gardner Lippin
cott concluded the entertainment, and
the crowd danced until eight o'clock, i
The following committees had
charge of the arangements:
General —Ed Butler, general chair
man; Pete Crandall, finances.
Transportation —Newton Brinkman,
Howell Smith, Charles McAllister.
Entertainment — Homer Mitchell,
Edythe Baylis, David Mannoceir, Her
bert Hoover. 1
Labor Day fulfilled every promise
and threw in a fire for good measure.
The unexpected blaze burned away
about 200 feet of bulkhead along the
high banks of San Francisquito creek,
and was regrettable but not dangerous.
Parties started drifting from the
campus toward the Home shortly after
one o'clock yesterday afternoon, and
with the aid of the University fleet of
trucks the number of workers was
brought to about 1100< students —the
largest turn-out in history. They were
divided into seven gangs and immedi
ately set to work grubbing out trees,
clearing off the playground, cleaning
straw from the fields, and performing
various odd jobs. The women slicked
up the orchard and rose-garden.
Cornerstone Laid
At 2:45 a bugle assembled the crowd
at the foundation of the new $35,000
unit, donated in memory of a close
friend of Mrs. Stanford, by Mrs. Henry
J. Crocker. After brief talks by Dr.
Gardner, Professor C. D. Marx, Mrs.
Payson J. Treat, and Phil Landis, Mrs.
Crocker applied the mortar, and the
cornerstone of the new edifice was set.
In the stone was a copper box contain
ing personal effects and relics of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin, to whom the
building is dedicated. Mrs. Hopkins is
known as "the Fairy Godmother of
the Children's Home." After the crowd
had sung "Hail, Stanford, Hail," Lou
Minsky announced that about half
the work had been finished, and the
audience scattered to complete the
jobs.
Head Gardener Pleased
Under the direction of Walter Alex
ander, Fred Loomis, Herbert Dwight,
Orville ' Tucker, Norman Anderson,
Claude Peavy, Don Liebendorfer, A1
Masters, Bob Wright, Fred Anderson,
and others, the cleaning up moved
swiftly and smoothly, and Otto Ny
quist, head gardener, says that the
students accomplished half again as
much as he had expected.
Phil Landis and Sam McDonald were
the most-talked-of men on the grounds
for the next hour. They offered some
thing very nice in the way of barbe
cues, and when the ravenous mob had
finished there wasn't enough left to
feed the committee that dished out the
food. Remarks were frequently heard
to the effect that if they were wise
they had gotten in on it beforehand,
so the chances are that nobody went
home hungry. Several portions of
meat, pickles, sandwiches, pork-and
beans, cookies, ice cream, and coffee
took both the ache and the void out
of the poetic combination.
Grinstead's Music Proves Hit
The hit of the day caijfte after din
ner. Grinstead's orchestra called the
banqueters over to the lawn of the
home, where a huge canvas was
stretched tightly on the ground. After
a coy interval the guests accepted the
invitation, and the canvas held, at
times, as many as 90 couples. This was
the first time that the Labor Day pro
gram had included a dance, and its
success should make it a fixture.

Head Gardener Pleased
Under the direction of Walter Alex
ander, Fred Loomis, Herbert Dwight,
Orville ' Tucker, Norman Anderson,
Claude Peavy, Don Liebendorfer, A1
Masters, Bob Wright, Fred Anderson,
and others, the cleaning up moved
swiftly and smoothly, and Otto Ny
quist, head gardener, says that the
students accomplished half again as
much as he had expected.
Phil Landis and Sam McDonald were
the most-talked-of men on the grounds
for the next hour. They offered some
thing very nice in the way of barbe
cues, and when the ravenous mob had
finished there wasn't enough left to
feed the committee that dished out the
food. Remarks were frequently heard
to the effect that if they were wise
they had gotten in on it beforehand,
so the chances are that nobody went
home hungry. Several portions of
meat, pickles, sandwiches, pork-and
beans, cookies, ice cream, and coffee
took both the ache and the void out
of the poetic combination.
Grinstead's Music Proves Hit
The hit of the day caijfte after din
ner. Grinstead's orchestra called the
banqueters over to the lawn of the
home, where a huge canvas was
stretched tightly on the ground. After
a coy interval the guests accepted the
invitation, and the canvas held, at
times, as many as 90 couples. This was
the first time that the Labor Day pro
gram had included a dance, and its
success should make it a fixture.
A trio from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
house put on a curtain-raiser, with
closer harmony than is found even in
our best barber shops. The "Fall River
Blues," and an extremely well-chosen j
selection from"A Boy's Best Friend i
Is His Mother" were especially well
received by the tired busineses men!
and women. Arnold Bayley and j
"Chick" Midgley were next on the bill,
and Bayley's interpretations of various j
campus characters were better than
ever. The home run of the evening
was "I Love Me," sung by Bayley with
Midgley at the Steinway. There wasn't
a dry eye in the house.
Ed Lamb Appears
During this song Eddie Lamb came
dynamiting down the road in his new
Seagrave, and a column of smoke rose
over the trees. It was found that a
huge pile of hay, thrown oyqr the bank
of the creek earlier in the day, had in
some way caught fire, and the heavy
wooden bulkhead protecting the road
at this point was already burning furi
ously. The auxiliary pumping engine
of the truck yielded plenty of pres
sure, and two lines playing on the I
blaze soon had it under control, about i
twenty volunteer student firemen as
sisting Lamb. The damage will amount j
to about $1000.
Specialty acts by Dorothy Daliler,!
Ted Van Deusen, and Gardner Lippin
cott concluded the entertainment, and
the crowd danced until eight o'clock, i
The following committees had
charge of the arangements:
General —Ed Butler, general chair
man; Pete Crandall, finances.
Transportation —Newton Brinkman,
Howell Smith, Charles McAllister.
Entertainment — Homer Mitchell,
Edythe Baylis, David Mannoceir, Her

Labor Day fulfilled every promise
and threw in a fire for good measure.
The unexpected blaze burned away
about 200 feet of bulkhead along the
high banks of San Francisquito creek,
and was regrettable but not dangerous.
Parties started drifting from the
campus toward the Home shortly after
one o'clock yesterday afternoon, and
with the aid of the University fleet of
trucks the number of workers was
brought to about 1100< students —the
largest turn-out in history. They were
divided into seven gangs and immedi
ately set to work grubbing out trees,
clearing off the playground, cleaning
straw from the fields, and performing
various odd jobs. The women slicked
up the orchard and rose-garden.
Cornerstone Laid
At 2:45 a bugle assembled the crowd
at the foundation of the new $35,000
unit, donated in memory of a close
friend of Mrs. Stanford, by Mrs. Henry
J. Crocker. After brief talks by Dr.
Gardner, Professor C. D. Marx, Mrs.
Payson J. Treat, and Phil Landis, Mrs.
Crocker applied the mortar, and the
cornerstone of the new edifice was set.
In the stone was a copper box contain
ing personal effects and relics of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin, to whom the
building is dedicated. Mrs. Hopkins is
known as "the Fairy Godmother of
the Children's Home." After the crowd
had sung "Hail, Stanford, Hail," Lou
Minsky announced that about half
the work had been finished, and the
audience scattered to complete the
jobs.
