# Roth Will Hear Car Advocates at Freshman Meeting Tomorrow
## 
### 
"Dutch" Roth. '09, has been asked by the Class of 1926 to speak to them
in class meeting on the proposed amendment prohibiting the ownership and
operation of automobiles by underclassmen. Roth will speak not from the
viewpoint of an administration official but as an interested Stanford
alumnus who sees in this movement an opportunity for doing immeasurable
good for Stanford.
It is the desire of those who are advancing the proposition that men who
are opposed to its passage appear in the meeting to present theri objections
so that Roth may have an opportunity to answer them.
The freshmen are inclined to the view that the amendment, if passed,
will work untold benefits for Stanford in all lines but they want to have
both sides of the question advanced to them before making a decision.
This can be done only if men who are opposed to the measure on any
grounds whatever are in Room 214 at ten o'clock tomorrow morning to
state their convictions.
