# CALL EDITOR TO BE HOST TO PRESSMEN OF CAMPUS SUNDAY
## 
### 
Fremont Older, veteran newspaper
man, and editor of The San Francisco
Call, has invited campus journalists to
his Saratoga estate next Sunday. The
excursion is being made under the
auspices of the American Journalists
Association, although it will be open
to anyone interested.
Older has been a San Francisco edi
tor for many years. As editor of The
Bulletin, he took a leading part in the
graft prosecution cases. Later he be
came editor of The Call, waging a
campaign on behalf of Thomas Mooney
and his companions, who were sent
to the penitentiary for their alleged
connection with the Preparedness Day
parade bombs.
The trip to Older's estate can be
made either by automobile or electric
car. In case the demand for transpor
tation exceeds the available automo
biles, some of the journalists will re
sort to the interurban.
Those who will make the trip will
meet at the Press building at two
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
In order that Older may know how
many are coming, it will be necessary
to sign up at Professor Smith's office
in the Press building. Those who can
bring machines are requested to indi
cate that fact on the sign-up sheet.
