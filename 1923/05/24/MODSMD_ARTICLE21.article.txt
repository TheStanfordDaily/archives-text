Political talk has been rife on the campus this
week and perhaps will increase before the Tuesday
elections, unless we become surfeited with it before
then.
There is the automobile question, the yell leader
mixup, the Quad managership undercurrent, and
opposition for the various student l>ody officers—
all of which have brought out an unusual amount of
crabbing - . But the more dissatisfaction and discus
sion right now the better. We have four days yet
to hash over the issues and candidates, which ought
to be time enough to form a pretty definite idea of
how we stand. ' Now is the time to talk—or forever
hold our peace.
Meanwhile there is an election coming up tomor
row which merits the attention of every student in
terested in campus affairs. Since there is only one
student newspaper, it would be unfair to discrimi
nate editorially against any one candidate unless his
methods be too obviously representative of the sort
of thing which the majority will not tolerate. How
ever, there can be no charge of discrimination in
the advice that the student body decisively defeat
the move to repeal the by-law relating to yell leaders
at the special election tomorrow. Those who feel
that the present assistants have been done an injus
tice will still have the opportunity to support their
candidates and the whole election will be attended
with less confusion.
