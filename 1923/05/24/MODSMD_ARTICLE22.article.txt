# LABOR DAYâ€”AND AN INDISCRETION
## 
### 
First, all praise is clue the committee in charge of
Labor Day arrangements at the Convalescent Home
yesterday. A larger crowd than ever before turned
out and more work was done than anybody expected.
The day ended with a program of entertainment
which nobody could help but enjoy.
Uut, through no fault of the committee or most
of the workers, a fire resulted from the occasion
which cost the University some hundreds of dollars
and offset the material good which was accom
plished by the labor. Some thoughtless person set
fire to some hay thrown into the bed of San Fran
cisquito creek and caused a blaze which took hours
to extinguish. The resulting lesson in tire-preven
tion is obvious.
