# STANFORD IN THE "BIG THREE"
## 
### 
Princeton has generally been regarded as the out
sider in the "Big Three" of Eastern universities.
1 larvard and Vale were established some years be
fore it. As a natural consequence, they profit by
larger reputations and the fact that they are in
larger centers of population than is Princeton. Still,
the institution that has glorified the Tiger manages
to win its share of victories in "Big Three" athletic
competition. One reason for this success is the fact
that Princeton bars automobiles to student use.
Situated Like Princeton
The situation of Princeton is analagous to our
own in relation to the "Big Three" which is grow
ing into prominence on the Pacific Coast. The Uni
versity of California is the oldest established of the
California trio and it has the largest student body
of any university in the United States. The Uni
versity of Southern California is located in the
largest city on the Coast and draws its numbers
from all over the southland. Stanford is practically
isolated and draws men and women from all over
the world because of the reputation it has developed
for turning out men and women who arc known

wherever they go as "Stanford Men" and "Stanford
Women."
Lately various things have come into use that
have changed the original scheme of things. Certain
disintegrating and disturbing factors have crept into
our universities so that they are not producing the
maximum of results. This condition is said to be
one of the causes for the athletic slump that Stan
ford is in at present.
Doing No One Any Good
One of these disintegrating factors is the automo
bile. Because Stanford is a community that is self
sufficient there is very little reason for its young
students owning and operating machines on the
campus. Their duty to themselves is to get all that
they can out of their years of study. Their duty to
their Alma Mater is to contribute all of the energy
they can to the projects that mean the University
to the outside world. If they are dividing their
time solely between driving their cars and studying
enough to satisfy their professors they are neither
developing themselves nor contributing to the Uni
versity the things that the University has a right
to demand.
The first two years is the formative stage. After
that period the university man is recognized as
capable of working out his own ends. He has earned
a respect that has followed his successful establish
ment in certain activities and the completion of his
lower division work. Generally he is able to handle
an automobile along with the other things he may
be interested in.
Our Interests Are Here
If Stanford is to continue 011 the same footing with
California and the University of Southern Califor
nia as it has in the past, it must conserve and make
use of every ounce of energy and talent in the stu
dent body. One method of conservation is a rule
that will force the younger students to find their in
terests on the campus instead of elsewhere.

The first two years is the formative stage. After
that period the university man is recognized as

If Stanford is to continue 011 the same footing with
California and the University of Southern Califor
nia as it has in the past, it must conserve and make
use of every ounce of energy and talent in the stu
dent body. One method of conservation is a rule
that will force the younger students to find their in
terests on the campus instead of elsewhere.

Princeton has generally been regarded as the out
sider in the "Big Three" of Eastern universities.
1 larvard and Vale were established some years be
fore it. As a natural consequence, they profit by
larger reputations and the fact that they are in
larger centers of population than is Princeton. Still,
the institution that has glorified the Tiger manages
to win its share of victories in "Big Three" athletic
competition. One reason for this success is the fact
that Princeton bars automobiles to student use.
Situated Like Princeton
The situation of Princeton is analagous to our
own in relation to the "Big Three" which is grow
ing into prominence on the Pacific Coast. The Uni
versity of California is the oldest established of the
California trio and it has the largest student body
of any university in the United States. The Uni
versity of Southern California is located in the
largest city on the Coast and draws its numbers
from all over the southland. Stanford is practically
isolated and draws men and women from all over
the world because of the reputation it has developed
for turning out men and women who arc known

wherever they go as "Stanford Men" and "Stanford
Women."
Lately various things have come into use that
have changed the original scheme of things. Certain
disintegrating and disturbing factors have crept into
our universities so that they are not producing the
maximum of results. This condition is said to be
one of the causes for the athletic slump that Stan
ford is in at present.
Doing No One Any Good
One of these disintegrating factors is the automo
bile. Because Stanford is a community that is self
sufficient there is very little reason for its young
students owning and operating machines on the
campus. Their duty to themselves is to get all that
they can out of their years of study. Their duty to
their Alma Mater is to contribute all of the energy
they can to the projects that mean the University
to the outside world. If they are dividing their
time solely between driving their cars and studying
enough to satisfy their professors they are neither
developing themselves nor contributing to the Uni
versity the things that the University has a right
to demand.
