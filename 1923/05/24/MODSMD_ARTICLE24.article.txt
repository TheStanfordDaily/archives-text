# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
The student car is a constant bar
To all but flunk-outs and booze —
If plenty of talk could make us walk
We'd be scandalous hard on our shoes.

The above doggerel came out in Cabbages some time
ago. We repeat it to show that even a farmer can see
a sky-scraper from a long way out in the sticks.

Have you ever considered what a sinister thing a shoe
is? Practically every professional gunman wears them —
our most persistent divorcees have stacks of them—the
undesirable people from the gutter up to Wall Street
bandits are seldom seen on the sareet without them.
Neither are respectable people, but let's forget about
that. Added to that, profiteers made fortunes by build
ing them of paper. And yet they are allowed to exist!

Yessir, they cover a multitude of sins.

Beneath the flickering Northern lights
The Aurora Borealis
A wandering tinker sat —
Made him sadly think of Alice
And most of his tears were for that.
Said he to his dripping handkerchief—
"I asked her to marry me;
And if 'no' had meant 'yes'
I'd be married, I guess—
What a horrible mess that would be!"

Monday's mil brought this Pearl of Wisdom and Gem
of Truth inspired probably by departed but memorable
Junior Week:
I wish I was an Import
From many miles away
'Cause then I'd have attention
Every minute of the day.
Then I'd have flow'rs and candy
And absolute devotion
And be adored stimulus
Of Campus Boys' emotion.
And when the fun was over
I'd merrily hie me home
And never cram for exes
Nor tote an econ tome.
Just play . . . and read sweet nothings
From a pining Stanford youth
DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT
A sad and wiser co-ed
Restates this bitter truth! .

Fond Parent: Why I didn't even know he was taking
a nap.
