# The 						Facts of the Case
## 
### 
Some time ago, after a campus publi
cation had had a bad year, it was de
cided that thereafter both editorial and
managerial tryoutees would be recom
mended to voters by the board on a point
basis. Because of practical difficulties
it has not been completely possible to
do so on the editorial side, but this year
the system was strictly followed out in
the managerial branch.
Now the name of the candidate given
second place in the managerial contest
is being advanced as the man for the
position on the ground that his failure to
get the greatest number of points was
due to illness during part of the tryout
period.
In order to verify this a recheck has
been made. The periods of his illness
were increased by days being added on
each end, and the number of points that
the first nominee made during the same
periods was subtracted from his total.
Ihe result was that the first nominee
still had a surplus of 400 points.
The figures are in the office of the
publication where any who wish can see
for themselves. R. D. B.
