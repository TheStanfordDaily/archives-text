# The 						Politician's Answer
## 
### 
11l yesterday's Daily I was accused
of playing politics because I had pre
sented the petition to the Executive
Committee asking for a repeal of the
Rally Committee's action. This was
declared to be politics because it was
presented at such a late date. The an
swer is that the Rally Committee had
done nothing previous to the date of
nominations which we could ask to
repeal. They had the opportunity in
April to nominate their candidates. If
they had done so a month ago they
would not have forced us to such an
action. We would be perfectly willing
to let them run the entire student body
for yell leader if they would give us
sufficient time beforehand to deter
mine the merits of their candidates.
The Daily article reads, "The execu
tive committee feels that merit and
not seniority should determine the fu
ture yell leader." That is what we arei
fighting for. The tryoutee candidates'
have shown their merit. The dark
horses the Rally Committee are shov- !
Ing at us have done nothing to prove
their merit as yell leaders to the stu
dent body. How then can they ask us
to elect them on their merit?
I was also accused of stating to the
Executive Committee that I was back
ing a candidate regardless of the con-:
sequences to the school. What hap
pened was that after a member of the
Executive Committee volunteered the
information that he was running a
man and challenged me to name the
person I was supporting I admitted
that when the time for student body
elections came my support would go!
for a candidate whom they all knew. If
I am to be accused of politics for this
then at least five members of the
Executive Committee are in the same
boat.
