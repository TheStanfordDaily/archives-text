# Automobiles Again

Stanford University, May 24.
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
The proposed plan for the prohibi
tion of automobiles operated by under
classmen, while it may, as is claimed,
constitute a substantial remedy for a
great many campus ills, presents many
aspects which must be carefully con
sidered if a sane, practical judgment
is to be made.
Primarily, the agitation is directed
against the slight percentage of car
owners who make use of their good
fortune to the detriment of their own
interests and the University's welfare.
But it can not be denied that there is
a large number of students ownjng
automobiles, including underclassmen,
who maintain a high scholarship and
at the same time are actively engaged
in universities affairs, partly due to
the particular advantages the posses

sing of a car affords them. It is this
group that will suffer as a result of
the weaknesses of the minority.
Secondly, while it is rightfully ar
gued that the proposed amendment
will remove a common source of dis
traction for freshmen, it will merely
be eliminating one temptation to make
others doubly strong. For persons who
have neglected their duties because of
possessing an automobile are essen
tially lacking in control, and will turn
to other means of amusement. Such
persons are not desired at Stanford.
It is wholly a matter of the indi
vidual himself; if he clioosds the
wrong course, he will inevitably be the
loser. Let us not impose superficial re-j
strictions which can in no way make|
of the individual a better man.
