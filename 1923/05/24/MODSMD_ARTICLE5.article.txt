# COACH ANDY KERR FAVORS PROPOSED AUTO AMENDMENT
## 
### 
"Because there are some students
here at Stanford who cannot own and
operate an automobile judiciously, who
abuse the car privilege, probably the
best method is to take the car from
them. I would favor the proposed
amendment to the student constitu
tion providing for the restriction of the
machine to upperclassmen."
Football Coach Andy Kerr rallied to
the support of the amendment last
night, and like other Stanford coaches
already interviewed, believed that
such a measure would have certain
evident advantages for Stanford, and
particularly for the Card athletic situ
ation.
Would Benefit Athletics
"In my opinion, I believe that the
passage of such a ruling would have
a decidedly good effect on Stanford
athletic conditions. Students would
have more time to put upon athletics,
and the measure would tend to keep
them on the campus more.
"The ownership of a car is just like
any other privilege," Kerr stated. "So
long as it is not abused, and it is
exercised prudently, everything is all
right. The moment that someone in
pinges on this right, however, the
thing becomes a problem.
Hinder Abuse of Autos
"The automobile has its place here
at Stanford just as it does every place
else. But because there are some stu
dents who cannot make sensible use
of it, I believe some means should be
taken to correct the evil.
"I cite two examples showing the
misuse of this privilege. Two football
players, both of them stars, came to
Stanford last fall with expensive mo
tors. They chased off to the city two
or three times every week, and as a
result they lasted at Stanford for only
a quarter. These two men of whom I
speak had good promise and could
have aided Stanford football materially
had the car not put in its digs."
Auto Conditions at Pittsburgh
Kerr described automobile condi
tions back at Pittsburgh. "The use of
the car there does not have the same
aspects that it does here at Stanford.
At Pitt, the university is situated in
the heart of the city. When students
want to go to a show, they either walk
or take a street car. Here, when a
fellow wants to attend a show, he pre
fers the automobile. This is, of course,
partlv due to Stanford's location."
Agitation over the "car question"
has occurred in various colleges all
over the country, Kerr said. Stanford
has an opportunity to solve the abuse

of the car privilege on her campus,
and according to Kerr, the settlement
proposed would have highly beneficial
results.
1926 President in Favor
Automobiles at Stanford are unne
cessary, according to Horace Edmond
son, president of the freshman class.
"It will take the majority of entering
students at least two years to formu
late a systematic method of study. If
their work is kept normal, they will
have no time for automobiles.

"From an athletic standpoint, I will
say that I am in favor of anything that
will help Stanford turn the tables on
California. If the car is a factor caus
ing recent defeats as some of the
A
alumni think, then I am heartily in
favor of the amendment.
"The chief objection to the amend
ment, it seems, iB the possibility of
enforcement. Experiment determines
the success or failure of anything. I
am in favor of giving the proposed
measure a try."

results.
1926 President in Favor
Automobiles at Stanford are unne
cessary, according to Horace Edmond
son, president of the freshman class.
"It will take the majority of entering
students at least two years to formu
late a systematic method of study. If
their work is kept normal, they will
have no time for automobiles.

"From an athletic standpoint, I will
say that I am in favor of anything that
will help Stanford turn the tables on
California. If the car is a factor caus
ing recent defeats as some of the
A
alumni think, then I am heartily in
favor of the amendment.
"The chief objection to the amend
ment, it seems, iB the possibility of
enforcement. Experiment determines
the success or failure of anything. I
am in favor of giving the proposed
measure a try."
"Because there are some students
here at Stanford who cannot own and
operate an automobile judiciously, who
abuse the car privilege, probably the
best method is to take the car from
them. I would favor the proposed
amendment to the student constitu
tion providing for the restriction of the
machine to upperclassmen."
Football Coach Andy Kerr rallied to
the support of the amendment last
night, and like other Stanford coaches
already interviewed, believed that
such a measure would have certain
evident advantages for Stanford, and
particularly for the Card athletic situ
ation.
Would Benefit Athletics
"In my opinion, I believe that the
passage of such a ruling would have
a decidedly good effect on Stanford
athletic conditions. Students would
have more time to put upon athletics,
and the measure would tend to keep
them on the campus more.
"The ownership of a car is just like
any other privilege," Kerr stated. "So
long as it is not abused, and it is
exercised prudently, everything is all
right. The moment that someone in
pinges on this right, however, the
thing becomes a problem.
Hinder Abuse of Autos
"The automobile has its place here
at Stanford just as it does every place
else. But because there are some stu
dents who cannot make sensible use
of it, I believe some means should be
taken to correct the evil.
"I cite two examples showing the
misuse of this privilege. Two football
players, both of them stars, came to
Stanford last fall with expensive mo
tors. They chased off to the city two
or three times every week, and as a
result they lasted at Stanford for only
a quarter. These two men of whom I
speak had good promise and could
have aided Stanford football materially
had the car not put in its digs."
Auto Conditions at Pittsburgh
Kerr described automobile condi
tions back at Pittsburgh. "The use of
the car there does not have the same
aspects that it does here at Stanford.
At Pitt, the university is situated in
the heart of the city. When students
want to go to a show, they either walk
or take a street car. Here, when a
fellow wants to attend a show, he pre
fers the automobile. This is, of course,
partlv due to Stanford's location."
Agitation over the "car question"
has occurred in various colleges all
over the country, Kerr said. Stanford
has an opportunity to solve the abuse

of the car privilege on her campus,
and according to Kerr, the settlement
proposed would have highly beneficial
results.
