# Y.W.C.A. Hears Discussion On Summer Employment
## 
### 
"There are too many people looking
for jobs at the summer resorts, and as
a result it is only those with some skill
or experience that are likely to get work
there," said Marian Turner, '24, chair
man of the vocational committee of the
Y. W. C. A., in speaking on the possi
bilities for summer work at the meet
ing of the association.
"It is best for college students who
wish employment during the summer
months to try some line of work which
will help them in the vocation which
they intend to follow."
Announcement was made that Mrs.
schools, business offices, libraries, sum
mer camps, boarding houses, and hotels,
on farms, and as governesses and tutors,
as some of the opportunities open to
university students.
Laura Kennedy, '23, who has spent
the last two summers "hashing" at
Fallen Leaf Lake, told of her experi
ences there, and of the good times which
those who work there enjoy.
Marian Turner announced that Mrs.
Snell had listed at the Appointment
Office some places for students for this
summer and would probably have more
later.
