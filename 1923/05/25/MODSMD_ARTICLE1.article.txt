# MANY SURPRISES IN FINAL DAY OF NOMINATIONS FOR SPRING ELECTION
## 18 NAMES FOR COUNCIL Automobile Amendment Will Be Center of Interest Next Tuesday 
### Polly Tishun 
Mr. Student bounced out of bed this
morning with the realization that
nominations for the spring election
would close ere it came time for an
other bounce. Miss Student's mind
must have gone through much the
same process for nominations flocked
into the box in front of the Romanic
Languages building like bargain hunt
ers to a spring sale.
And the best part of it is that the
light is scarcely under way.
Even the race for the student body
president's chair seems vastly over
shadowed by the automobile contro
versy. From the results of straw votes
taken in the various living groups in
the past two days, the "Rolls Roughs,"
Fords, and other similar instruments
of torture seem fairly certain of again
being in vogue next year.
And in the meantime, "Nip" McHose
and A1 Masters have their grips
packed for a long trip. The funny part
of it is that one of them will unpack
next Tuesday after the election results
are compiled. Here's the secret. The
student body ©resident-elect is to get
a free gratis trip to a convention in
Idaho and the lucky man must leave
as soo nas he decides whether he is
lucky or unlucky.
Rumors of dark horses materialized
and then faded away at the last mo
ment today. Dud DeGroot, Mike Reed,
and Charles White, all candidates for
the trip have seen fit to provide more
space 011 the ballot for other names
and plenty of others came in.
Due to the short time nominations
were in order, but eighteen candidates
appeared for the five places on the
Men's Council. The Election Board is
still scouring the country for any
available paper that can be used for
ballots.
The usual flood of candidates for
class offices is in evidence. Each
friend nominated a friend and that
friend nominated another friend and
the list of candidates grew and grew
and didn't stop until one o'clock today.
The yell leader situation is still very
much in the air. In the vote this morn
ing on the amendment, it was a case
of vote "yes" if you don't and "no"
if you do. Most of the voters didn't
know which was which and voted ac
cordingly. The legal minds are still
battling over the question of the re
quired majority.

into the box in front of the Romanic
Languages building like bargain hunt
ers to a spring sale.
And the best part of it is that the
light is scarcely under way.
Even the race for the student body
president's chair seems vastly over
shadowed by the automobile contro
versy. From the results of straw votes
taken in the various living groups in
the past two days, the "Rolls Roughs,"
Fords, and other similar instruments
of torture seem fairly certain of again
being in vogue next year.
And in the meantime, "Nip" McHose
and A1 Masters have their grips
packed for a long trip. The funny part
of it is that one of them will unpack
next Tuesday after the election results
are compiled. Here's the secret. The
student body ©resident-elect is to get
a free gratis trip to a convention in
Idaho and the lucky man must leave
as soo nas he decides whether he is
lucky or unlucky.
Rumors of dark horses materialized
and then faded away at the last mo
ment today. Dud DeGroot, Mike Reed,
and Charles White, all candidates for
the trip have seen fit to provide more
space 011 the ballot for other names
and plenty of others came in.
Due to the short time nominations
were in order, but eighteen candidates
appeared for the five places on the
Men's Council. The Election Board is
still scouring the country for any
available paper that can be used for
ballots.
The usual flood of candidates for
class offices is in evidence. Each
friend nominated a friend and that
friend nominated another friend and
the list of candidates grew and grew
and didn't stop until one o'clock today.
The yell leader situation is still very
much in the air. In the vote this morn
ing on the amendment, it was a case
of vote "yes" if you don't and "no"
if you do. Most of the voters didn't
know which was which and voted ac
cordingly. The legal minds are still
battling over the question of the re
quired majority.
