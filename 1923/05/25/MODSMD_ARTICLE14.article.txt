## AWARDS FOR ALL SPORTS WILL BE GRANTED BY W.A.A. Swimming, Archery, Tennis and Track Squads to Have Class Tilts 
### Mildred Dannenbaum 
Teams in track, tennis, swimming, and archery will battle on the Roble fields
tomorrow for the highest number of points in the sports contests-to win Field
Day. At 1 o'clock the forces will disband for a barbecue, at which the
Women's Athletic Association will award block "S" sweaters to the women
who have made a thousand points in athletics, armbands to those who have
played in intercollegiate games, and numerals to the women who have made
class teams.
One of the big events of Field Day will be the dedication of the women's
new track field at 10 o'clock. Comptroller Roth will make the dedication ad
dress. Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Women's Physical Education Director,
and Eunice Biddle, '24, President of W. A. A., are the other speakers. Follow-

► ing the dedication of the field an inter
class track meet will take place.
W. A. A. will grant awards to nearly
a hundred women at the barbecue. Dean
Yost, Miss Bunting,' and Eunice Biddle
will speak and Women's "S" Society will
entertain with a stunt.
Contrary to the usual custom of pre
senting the winners of the swimming,
tennis, and archery contests with cups,
W. A. A. has decided to have, the victor's
names engraved on cups which will re
main in the possession of the Association.
The five women who will be awarded
block "S" sweaters are: Alice Roth, '24;
Eunice Biddle, '24; Josephine Eranklin,
'24; Geraldine Franklin, '24; and Joyce
Robson, '24.
All women who are granted armbands
or numerals should be present at the bar
becue to receive their awards or desig
nate some one to receive the awards for
them.
The following women have been
granted awards : Seniors—Muriel Bell,
Helen Brant, Margaret Carlsmith, Hazel
Churchman, Dorothy Clark, Beatrice
Fenner, Laura Kennedy, Marion Leffing

' Joyce Robson, Josephine Scott, Flora

prove a great incentive to increased in- i
terest on the part of the women. It is {
on the 1000-point basis and sweaters have
been given for the first time. We also
felt that there were many very near to
the required number of points who also
deserved an award, so the "S" is given
without the sweater. Another innovation
is that of the armband. Formerly a wo- j
man received an armband for each inter-1
collegiate meet. Under the new system, |
they are awarded at the first game and a!

The interclass track meet will be the
most interesting event of the day. Little
is known about the comparative strength
of the squads because there have been no
preliminary contests. The events of the
meet are: High jump, 75-yard dash, re
lay, shot put, and 50-yard dash.
According to the victories won in the
interclass swimming meets the freshman
team will probably romp off with the
bigger end of the score in Saturday's |
contest. The 1926 squad won all three of
the interclass meets. However the sopho-'
more team will give the freshman some
keen competition Saturday.
The finals of the interclass tennis
matches will be played off on Field Day. j
Runners-up in the semi-finals will also j
play off matches to determine the third
and fourth place in the tournament and;
to add points to the scores of the classes j
that are competing in the "'Field Day
events.
The fact that the senior, junior, and
freshman archery teams won from their
Mills rivals this year show that there are
three strong archery squads. The senior
archerettes will probably walk off with
first place with the sophomores -and
juniors giving each other a good race for
second honors.
Virginia Burks, '23, is Field Day man
ager. Dorothy Overfelt, '24, has charge
of the barbecue.
Archery, tennis, and swimming man
agers for next year will be elected Field
Day.

The interclass track meet will be the
most interesting event of the day. Little
is known about the comparative strength
of the squads because there have been no
preliminary contests. The events of the
meet are: High jump, 75-yard dash, re
lay, shot put, and 50-yard dash.
According to the victories won in the
interclass swimming meets the freshman
team will probably romp off with the
bigger end of the score in Saturday's |
contest. The 1926 squad won all three of
the interclass meets. However the sopho-'
more team will give the freshman some
keen competition Saturday.
The finals of the interclass tennis
matches will be played off on Field Day. j
Runners-up in the semi-finals will also j
play off matches to determine the third
and fourth place in the tournament and;
to add points to the scores of the classes j
that are competing in the "'Field Day
events.
The fact that the senior, junior, and
freshman archery teams won from their
Mills rivals this year show that there are
three strong archery squads. The senior
archerettes will probably walk off with
first place with the sophomores -and
juniors giving each other a good race for
second honors.
Virginia Burks, '23, is Field Day man
ager. Dorothy Overfelt, '24, has charge
of the barbecue.
Archery, tennis, and swimming man
agers for next year will be elected Field
Day.
Teams in track, tennis, swimming, and archery will battle on the Roble fields
tomorrow for the highest number of points in the sports contests-to win Field
Day. At 1 o'clock the forces will disband for a barbecue, at which the
Women's Athletic Association will award block "S" sweaters to the women
who have made a thousand points in athletics, armbands to those who have
played in intercollegiate games, and numerals to the women who have made
class teams.
One of the big events of Field Day will be the dedication of the women's
new track field at 10 o'clock. Comptroller Roth will make the dedication ad
dress. Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Women's Physical Education Director,
and Eunice Biddle, '24, President of W. A. A., are the other speakers. Follow-

► ing the dedication of the field an inter
class track meet will take place.
W. A. A. will grant awards to nearly
a hundred women at the barbecue. Dean
Yost, Miss Bunting,' and Eunice Biddle
will speak and Women's "S" Society will
entertain with a stunt.
Contrary to the usual custom of pre
senting the winners of the swimming,
tennis, and archery contests with cups,
W. A. A. has decided to have, the victor's
names engraved on cups which will re
main in the possession of the Association.
The five women who will be awarded
block "S" sweaters are: Alice Roth, '24;
Eunice Biddle, '24; Josephine Eranklin,
'24; Geraldine Franklin, '24; and Joyce
Robson, '24.
All women who are granted armbands
or numerals should be present at the bar
becue to receive their awards or desig

them.
The following women have been
granted awards : Seniors—Muriel Bell,

The interclass track meet will be the
most interesting event of the day. Little
is known about the comparative strength
of the squads because there have been no
preliminary contests. The events of the
meet are: High jump, 75-yard dash, re
lay, shot put, and 50-yard dash.
According to the victories won in the
interclass swimming meets the freshman
team will probably romp off with the
bigger end of the score in Saturday's |
contest. The 1926 squad won all three of
the interclass meets. However the sopho-'
more team will give the freshman some
keen competition Saturday.
The finals of the interclass tennis
matches will be played off on Field Day. j
Runners-up in the semi-finals will also j
play off matches to determine the third
and fourth place in the tournament and;
to add points to the scores of the classes j
that are competing in the "'Field Day
events.
The fact that the senior, junior, and
freshman archery teams won from their
Mills rivals this year show that there are
three strong archery squads. The senior
archerettes will probably walk off with
first place with the sophomores -and
juniors giving each other a good race for
second honors.
Virginia Burks, '23, is Field Day man
ager. Dorothy Overfelt, '24, has charge
of the barbecue.
Archery, tennis, and swimming man
agers for next year will be elected Field
Day.
Teams in track, tennis, swimming, and archery will battle on the Roble fields
tomorrow for the highest number of points in the sports contests-to win Field
Day. At 1 o'clock the forces will disband for a barbecue, at which the
Women's Athletic Association will award block "S" sweaters to the women
who have made a thousand points in athletics, armbands to those who have
played in intercollegiate games, and numerals to the women who have made
class teams.
One of the big events of Field Day will be the dedication of the women's
new track field at 10 o'clock. Comptroller Roth will make the dedication ad
dress. Miss Helen Masters Bunting, Women's Physical Education Director,
and Eunice Biddle, '24, President of W. A. A., are the other speakers. Follow-

► ing the dedication of the field an inter
class track meet will take place.
W. A. A. will grant awards to nearly
a hundred women at the barbecue. Dean
Yost, Miss Bunting,' and Eunice Biddle
will speak and Women's "S" Society will
entertain with a stunt.
Contrary to the usual custom of pre
senting the winners of the swimming,
tennis, and archery contests with cups,
W. A. A. has decided to have, the victor's
names engraved on cups which will re
main in the possession of the Association.
The five women who will be awarded
block "S" sweaters are: Alice Roth, '24;
Eunice Biddle, '24; Josephine Eranklin,
'24; Geraldine Franklin, '24; and Joyce
Robson, '24.
All women who are granted armbands
or numerals should be present at the bar
becue to receive their awards or desig
nate some one to receive the awards for
them.
The following women have been
granted awards : Seniors—Muriel Bell,
