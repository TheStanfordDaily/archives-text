# STUDENTS INVITED TO VISIT HOME OF FAMOUS JOURNALIST
## 
### 
" I shall be glad to have the Stanford
students who are interested in newspaper
work- come and sit on my lawn and lei
us talk together about that work, but 1
won't make a speech," says Fremonl
Older, the veteran San Francisco editor
who has invited the journalism students
to his Saratoga home Sunday afternoon
"My ideas about journalism have
changed a good deal since my younger
years and if they are interested in my
views now I shall enjoy letting the con
versation run along, following lines that
their questions may open up."
Fremont Older, now editor of the San
Francisco Call, can draw upon a news
paper experience of nearly forty years
in discussing journalism, and its prob
lems and methods. He entered a printing
office when he was 13 years old, and
began newspaper work in 1884. He was
for a time city editor of the San Fran
cisco Call when that was a morning
paper, and then for many years was
managing editor of the Bulletin. It was
during this period that he became a na
tional figure through the part lie had the
Bulletin take in driving through the
graft pcrscutions in San Francisco, lead
' ing to the conviction of Abe Ruef and
others.
