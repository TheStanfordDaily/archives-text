# FLORENCE HEYWOOD SOLVES MYSTERIES OF LOUVRE PAINTINGS
## 
### 
What is the secret of Mona Lisa's
smile? Why are there so many madonnas
ia European art galleries ? And what do
many critics consider the greatest paint
ing in the Louvre?'
These are a few of the questions, often
asked by tourists, which Florence Hey
wood, '02, lecturer of the Louvre, at
tempted to answer last evening during the
course of an illustrated talk which in
cluded a discussion of famous masters
from Giotto to Delacroix.
Lazzari, a contemporary of Francis I
and Solomon Reinach, critic, have writ
ten a suggested explanation of the baffling
expression of Mona Lisa which is ac
cepted by several authorities, Miss Hey
wood said, "The absence of jewels in the
portrait may indicate that the lady was
in mourning, and the theory is substan
tiated by the fact that the death of an
infant is recorded about the time the pic
ture was painted. Leonardo da Vinci
often employed musicians to beguile sit
ters into a happy expression. This is a
possible explanation of the sad smile and
contradicting eyes of Mona Lisa.
"The great number of madonnas
painted by old masters must be looked
upon simply as symbols," the lecturer de
clared. "They are religious pictures
i made for people who could not read. Real
appreciation of art has nothing to do with
knowledge. The reason that the layman
does not like many old paintings is be
cause they lack a sense of volume per
spective, and modern brush-work tech
nique. In these canvases one must look
for the intricate pattern designs of such
masters as Botticelli and Fra Angelico."
This country is keenly awake to art and
Miss Heywood believes that America will
be a great art center in the future. Anglo-
Saxons are apt to lack the true sense of
art. The greatest test, the speaker thinks,
is appreciation of Rembrandt's raw beef
f â€”if one can find a thrill in his marvelous
coloring, lie is an artist, but if one feels
only a sense of revolution, he is looking
at the picture solely through the eyes of
intellect."
