# A 						NEEDED STIMULANT

The experience of the past few days proves that
there is nothing so effective as a few charges of
"dirty politics" to arouse interest in student body
elections. The claim that undergraduate affairs are
run "by a bunch of peanut politicians" is made
periodically—but seldom with so much heat as pre
vails now. Whether or not we admit it, we all like
to feel that we are on the inside; it irritates us to
know that a small group of men and women may
conduct government without our advice.
The student body as a whole shows no interest
in their government; the majority of their officers
are elected on white ballots; and at the time of elec
tions, in nine cases out of ten the students them
selves don't know what it is all about. The handful
of men and women who assume the burden of stu
dent government will inevitably be accused of politi
cal machinations. And yet someone has to manage
undergraduate affairs.
If it be true that the one essential to good citizen
ship is an intelligent interest in the affairs of gov
ernment, heaven help the future leaders of the
nation!
