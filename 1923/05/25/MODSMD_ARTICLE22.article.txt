Probably nothing would cause more exultation
among the undergraduates than a football victory
over California —and the men who are developing
Stanford athletics desire such a victory just as

tion have been presented in abundance; we are asked
finally to vote on the question, not with the thought
of any personal discomforts which it would entail,
but in the light of our honest belief in what is best
for the University.
