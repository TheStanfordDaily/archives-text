We've strung the men along.
We've made them sing our song.
But now we've found this twine
We'll string another line.
♦ » *
Bella —Don't you hate a man who thinks he can sing?
Donna —Yes, and I've never found one who didn't
think so. t
• * •
What would the men do when feminine visitors arrive
if they didn't huve the Five Hundred to make an im
pression?
• * *
Constant endeavor counts but sometimes the same old
line gets tiresome.

Prof. —Please rise to your feet.
Stude —How can I? I'm already above them.

When I started out for Stanford
I was traveling In state.
I rode on the cars, smoked good cigars
At a most alarming rate.
By day I lolled in a red plush chair
With a porter hovering nigh.
I flirted, I ate ofT Haviland plate
Like any high class guy.
But now I've been to college
And my cash is running low,
So I'll sling a pack across my back
And sneak out down the Row.
I'll hoof the good old trail for home,
I'll tramp and snoop for food,
I'll bum my way, sleep in the hay,
And be a hobo dude.
* * *
Professor —Is there anyone who can offer any proof
that the world is not round?
Bill Patterson —The Lord said Moses stood on the
four corners of the earth.
• * *
For Sale —Turkeys by a man already picked and
stuffed.
* * *
Going off with a lady's powder puff is a poor excuse
to call again.
* * *
The next subject open for discussion is whether
women spend more time powdering their noses than
men spend trying to get their cords dirty.

Mr. Tom Irwin entertained the members of the Men's

One of the most stirring speeches ever delivered in
the United States Congress was that given yesterday
by Congressman Fil Landus on the bill, "Resolved, That
babies should not be allowed to chew safety pins until
they reach the age of six months."
* * *
"I'll pound you," said the butcher as he hammered the
steak.
• • *
"Love suffereth long and is kind," may well be said
of the woman who teaches a man. to dance.
* * *
Every Stanford man's favorite song—"l love me."

Observe our athletic female. She's c-r-a-z-y about ath
letics. She's wild about swimming but it takes the curl
out of her hair. She'd adore tennis if it didn't freckle
her nose and turn her rose-petal complexion to a Hindu
tan. She'd be keen about basketball only it is so un
dignified. She worships hockey but you can't be grace
ful in the sport and you're forever getting whacked or
sliding on your spine. She'd major in track if it wasn't
for the fact that it stiffens her so she can't Chicago
for at least a day afterwards. As for archery—it de
velopes her arm muscles until she looks like a village
blacksmith in an evening gown. And yet, despite all this,
she ADORES sports.
* * *
"Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows —
Don't know what to call him,
But he's might lak' a rose!"
So the fair ones sing to him —
Our gallant "Nip" McHose.
* * *
Now that only 1234567890 minutes remain until the
beginning of finals, we are beginning to regret our
membership in the liell-pavers' union—that fellowship
of the well-intentioned.
We've strung the men along.
We've made them sing our song.

When I started out for Stanford
I was traveling In state.
I rode on the cars, smoked good cigars
At a most alarming rate.
By day I lolled in a red plush chair
With a porter hovering nigh.
I flirted, I ate ofT Haviland plate
Like any high class guy.
But now I've been to college
And my cash is running low,
So I'll sling a pack across my back
And sneak out down the Row.
I'll hoof the good old trail for home,
I'll tramp and snoop for food,
I'll bum my way, sleep in the hay,
And be a hobo dude.

Professor —Is there anyone who can offer any proof
that the world is not round?
Bill Patterson —The Lord said Moses stood on the
four corners of the earth.
• * *
For Sale —Turkeys by a man already picked and
stuffed.

Going off with a lady's powder puff is a poor excuse

The next subject open for discussion is whether
women spend more time powdering their noses than
men spend trying to get their cords dirty.

Observe our athletic female. She's c-r-a-z-y about ath
letics. She's wild about swimming but it takes the curl
out of her hair. She'd adore tennis if it didn't freckle
her nose and turn her rose-petal complexion to a Hindu
tan. She'd be keen about basketball only it is so un
dignified. She worships hockey but you can't be grace
ful in the sport and you're forever getting whacked or
sliding on your spine. She'd major in track if it wasn't
for the fact that it stiffens her so she can't Chicago
for at least a day afterwards. As for archery—it de
velopes her arm muscles until she looks like a village
blacksmith in an evening gown. And yet, despite all this,
she ADORES sports.

"Sweetest little fellow, everybody knows —
Don't know what to call him,

Now that only 1234567890 minutes remain until the
