"There are smiles that make us happy; i
there are smiles that make us blue."
There certainly are. The optimist says
that smiles are the outward expression
of joy, and that people smile because
they are happy. Well, let's take the i
optimist's point of view.
Now there's the sweet young thing
who smiles whenever she sees you on
the campus. Gracious, but the girl must
have a wonderful disposition! Why,
she's always laughing! She does have
a wonderful pair of dimples that show
when she smiles, but—of course not!
Next comes the handsome young fel
low who half closes his eyes and smiles
languidly at you from behind a cloud of
cigarette smoke. He is so wicked he j
looks like Satan himself, but he's quite
a nice chap. He had to watch Rudolph
Valentino several times and then prac
tice this wicked smile before he could
do it effectively.
Then there's the good-looking young
woman who smiles incessantly. She 1
probably is very good-natured, although
every time she smiles she displays a set
of pearly white teeth. But any one who
has this physical perfection really has
something to smile about.
Ever notice the person who gives ev
ery one such a joyful smile that it makes
people think to themselves, "Gee, wasn'tj
she glad to se me." But wait a minute,
and you'll see that the sunshine of this
smile lasts about as olng as a streak of
lightning. It flashes on for every ac
quaintance and flashes off as soon as he
passes by.
Nearly every one is guilty of prac
ticing smiles in the mirror to find the
perfect smile that will score the biggest
hit. The flapper in her new evening
dress practices the art of smiling just
before she goes to a dance; the flipper
puts on his new hat and does the same
thing. Mirrors have to put up with an
awful lot!
