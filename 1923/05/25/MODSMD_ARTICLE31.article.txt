# PORTO RICAN STUDENT DESCRIBES LIFE AND CUSTOMS ON ISLAND
## 
### 
"The first thing which impressed me
when I came to Stanford," said Hallie
Elvira Queen, a Porto Rican student here
in the University, "was the amazing num
ber of men there are here, and the second
thing was the ease with which your
American woman deports herself among
them."
Miss Queen, the only Porto Rican stu
dent at Stanford, has been working for
the past year to get her master's degree
in the Department of Spanish.
"It is far different with our sheltered
women," Miss Queen continued the inter
view. "In Porto Rico it is an unusual
thing for a girl to take a higher educa
tion. However, contrary to the general
idea of the public, Porto Rico is steadily

progressing. We have a University which
ranks on a par with any American uni
versity, and from which students may
transfer at any time to any American
college without loss of credit. It is a
coeducational institution.''
Miss Queen described some of the so
cial customs of Porto Rico, one of which
is strangely related to the institution of
the Stanford "rough." It seems that the
Porto Rican men gather at the corners
and upon the approach of a young woman
throw their coats at her feet. Then by
dint of teasing and threats they force her
to step upon the coat. The man whose
coat has thus been honored goes about all
day with the foot print upon his back,
and becomes very angry if anyone at
tempts, to remove it.
Porto Rican society, as Miss Queen
describes it, is loosely divided into four
classes, entirely on the basis of pro
fession.
