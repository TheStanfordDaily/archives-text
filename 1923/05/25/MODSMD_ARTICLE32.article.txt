# MORE WOMEN NEEDED AT STANFORD THINGS ROSEMARY DRACHMAN
## 
### 
"Five hundred more women should be
allowed to attend Stanford every year,"
says Rosemary Drachman, secretary to
the Dean of Women. "The small number
of women in proportion to the number of
men tends to make thef feel self-con
scious, and they dress and act in an af
fected manner.
This is a subject which is the theme of
many - intramural debates, speeches, and
news-stories, and is ever present in the
minds of most Stanford students. Miss
Drachman says that the roughs call the
women snobs and are all for excluding
them from the University, while some of
the women seem to enjoy their unique
position and arc not desirious of a
change.
As a graduate of Stanford, and secre
tary to Dean Yost Miss Drachman has
had an opportunity to be in close contact
with the Stanford women and study their
ways. In fact, she studies them so closely
that she keeps several note books which
are filled with the characteristics, conver
sation and manners of all the interesting
women students she has met.
