"Tonight," said Old Father Gooseflesh,
" I'm going to tell you the hair-raising
story of how queening started."
"Hair-raising or hair-pulling?" asked
one little Gooseflesh, who hadn't been
paying attention.
"Wait and see how it comes out," re
torted Grandpa Gooseflesh.
"Not very long ago," began the old
man, "when Adam and Eve lived in the
Garden of Eden, Adam got tired of
bringing in all the fruit; so he decided
to make Eve go with him for the dates."
"Is that how it happens that fellows
ask girls for dates, grandpa," demanded
small Toddy, who was a little hot one.
"Exactly," replied Grandpa, "but now
comcs the painful part of the story. You
see Eve didn't want to go out for the
dates ; so Adam dragged her along with
him by her hair. And that's why you
hear fellows say that they are dragging
"Naw, snakes charm 'cm," replied
a girl to a dance. But later Adam was
nicer to Eve, and he brought her flowers
and peaches so she would want to go with
him for dates."
"Was he gettin' civilized-" asked one
little Gooseflesh, who really had a low
I. Q.
"No, no," said Grandpa, angrily, "he
didn't want the snake to get her."
"Thuoght girls were afraid of snakes,"
again interrupted Gooseflesh.
Toddy, whom, we have said before, was
quite a spirited youngster.
"But Grandpa," said the little moron,
"most girls have bobbed hair and the
fellows can't drag them out for dates."
"Ha ha! Tt's easier to pull them along
by the ears now," suggested small Toddy.
"That's enough out of you Toddy. I'll
have to put you in the cellar if you show
so much spirit. Go jump in bed, children.
Pleasant nightmares!"
