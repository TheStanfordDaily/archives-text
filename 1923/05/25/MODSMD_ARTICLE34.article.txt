A page from the Junior Opera that
illustrates how some of our campus
heroes would take the lead.
RUB DE BOOT: —Dear, I don't know
just how to tackle the question, espe
cially without any signals from you. I
know its foolish to make such a forward
pass, but from the first you've been my
goal; so don't keep me at 10 yards length.
Will you marry me? Oh, you sugar plum.
(Kisses her hand.)
FILL PAGE:—Bern' a business man
I'll come straight to the point and say,
"Will yuh marry me, kid?." Liste'n, you
can't make a mistake by accepting me.
(Shifts star plug to the other side.) I
got a swell job as business manager of
the D. P. A. You better make up your
mind right away, 'cause if you don't take
me there's plenty more who will. Ah?
that's the girl. You know a good bargain
when you see it, don't you Kid? (Kisses
the hem of her skirt.)
VAIN TALK:—WeII, darling, you
don't expect me to go down on my knees
to you. You really should be glad to
have a track star shine up to you. Know
ing that there isn't any otic who can beat
my time, I'm absolutely sure of placing
first in your affections. Ah 1 I thought
so. That's a nicc girl. (Kisses her on
the forehead.)
