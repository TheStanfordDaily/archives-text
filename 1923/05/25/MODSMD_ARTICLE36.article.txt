# Russia and Bolshevism
## 
### 
From the first day when the Bolsheviks overturned
the Russian government they have striven to break the
spirit of the Russian people and to gain absolute power
for themselves by destroying three Russian institutions
—private property, family life and the church. The love
of these three things is inborn and deep-rooted in the
Russian peasant, and their destruction means the loss
of all that he holds dear. The Russians have never
developed a complicated social life. The interests of
the large masses were centered in these institutions.
Consequently, in order to gain full power, it was neces
sary for the Bolsheviks to break these institutions.
The matter of destroying private property was easily
accomplished, all property being confiscated by the
government within a month. After two years under this
plan, the government found it impossible to continue
since there was no one to pay the taxes and thus furnish
revenue for the government. As a result the entire
economic policy was changed. The fact that the policy
was changed, however, does in no way imply that the
ideas of the Bolsheviks were changed. As one Bolshevik
said, "We've sheared the sheep. Now we have to have
new sheep growing wool in order to shear them."
Just as the Bolshevik regime took drastic and abrupt
steps with the confiscation of property, so they wanted
to deal with the family life. In 1919 they ordered the
naturalization of all children and declared that all
children of school age should belong to the government.
Soon discords made the new way impossible.
The government had no schools to put the children in,
no teachers to instruct them, and no money to finance
the schools. The plan failed utterly. Children who had
been gathered in great numbers were returned to their
families. In the large cities the government now con
ducts in a misrable manner the orphanages. The condi
tions in these institutions are terrible. Sickness and
immoral conditions abound. The inmates are being
taught that there is no rule on earth save the person's
own mind. As a result there is taking place such a
moral degradation among these children that from them
the Bolsheviks should find plenty of future material
for their ranks.
The schools of higher education have absolutely no
equipment such as paper, pencils, or even electricity.
The classes are conducted in the evenings, as the pro
fessors are forced to clean the streets or pick coal dur-

ing the daytime In order to earn their food and clothing.
If the professors refuse to earn their salary by doing
both teaching and manual labor, they are cast into
prison or left to starve. One of the chief attractions of
the universities is, not the learning which they offer,
but the fact that there one may obtain a little food and
at least be in rooms partially warrued.
The Communists or Bolsheviks are paying more and
more attention to educating their representatives. Lenine
has frequently expressed the opinion that the Bolsheviks
must wait and that they can not do all as quickly as
they had expected. They must wait for the future Com
munistic generation and train it.
In the beginning of the Bolshevik reign, the Com
munists had ideas of pacificism but since the Polish
war of 1920 they have entertained strong militaristic
ideas and a strange theory of nationalism which may not
be called Russian but Communistic and which teaches
that Russia is surrounded by many foes and must be
constantly prepared for war.
In solving the Church problem, the Bolsheviks started
out with very repressive and terroristic methods. They
opened movies and dance halls in the churches and con
fiscated church property. In reply to the attacks of the
Bolsheviks on the church, the Russian peasant moved
stolidly on, remaining true to his church and not heed
ing the intervention of the government. Having ex
pected an active protest from the people, the Bolsheviks
were rather nonplussed by the strong but quiet force of
the Russians and found no way to combat it.
The Bolshevik leaders saw that they fould have to
use more quiet and insidious methods of accomplishing
their work by educating the young away from religion.
Consequently they forbade all religious teaching in
schools and ordered the confiscation of church relics
under the pretense of needing them for money. That
such a reason was but a pretext was illustrated by the
fact that in many villages the peasants offered to pay
the government in gold amounting to the* value of their
church treasures if they would but leave them un
touched. The church properties in themselves were
more of a sentimental rather than of material value
in that the wealth of the Russian church is compara
tively small.
Later the faithful priests who lived true to their love
of the Church, were either thrown into prison or killed,
and today priests who have sold themselves to the
Bolsheviks are educating the Russian children away
from the old ideals.
Never before in the history of Russia have her
churches been as full as they are today. This is due to
the fact that everything has been taken away from the
peasant save his God and when all else is gone they
turn to the Church as their only refuge.

stolidly on, remaining true to his church and not heed
ing the intervention of the government. Having ex
pected an active protest from the people, the Bolsheviks
were rather nonplussed by the strong but quiet force of
the Russians and found no way to combat it.
The Bolshevik leaders saw that they fould have to
use more quiet and insidious methods of accomplishing
their work by educating the young away from religion.
Consequently they forbade all religious teaching in
schools and ordered the confiscation of church relics
under the pretense of needing them for money. That
such a reason was but a pretext was illustrated by the
fact that in many villages the peasants offered to pay
the government in gold amounting to the* value of their
church treasures if they would but leave them un
touched. The church properties in themselves were
more of a sentimental rather than of material value
in that the wealth of the Russian church is compara
tively small.
Later the faithful priests who lived true to their love
of the Church, were either thrown into prison or killed,
and today priests who have sold themselves to the
Bolsheviks are educating the Russian children away
from the old ideals.
Never before in the history of Russia have her
churches been as full as they are today. This is due to
the fact that everything has been taken away from the
peasant save his God and when all else is gone they
turn to the Church as their only refuge.
BARON BOODBERG.
From the first day when the Bolsheviks overturned
the Russian government they have striven to break the
spirit of the Russian people and to gain absolute power
for themselves by destroying three Russian institutions
—private property, family life and the church. The love
of these three things is inborn and deep-rooted in the
Russian peasant, and their destruction means the loss
of all that he holds dear. The Russians have never
developed a complicated social life. The interests of
the large masses were centered in these institutions.
Consequently, in order to gain full power, it was neces
sary for the Bolsheviks to break these institutions.
The matter of destroying private property was easily
accomplished, all property being confiscated by the
government within a month. After two years under this
plan, the government found it impossible to continue
since there was no one to pay the taxes and thus furnish
revenue for the government. As a result the entire
economic policy was changed. The fact that the policy
was changed, however, does in no way imply that the
ideas of the Bolsheviks were changed. As one Bolshevik
said, "We've sheared the sheep. Now we have to have
new sheep growing wool in order to shear them."
Just as the Bolshevik regime took drastic and abrupt
steps with the confiscation of property, so they wanted
to deal with the family life. In 1919 they ordered the
naturalization of all children and declared that all
children of school age should belong to the government.
Soon discords made the new way impossible.
The government had no schools to put the children in,
no teachers to instruct them, and no money to finance
the schools. The plan failed utterly. Children who had
been gathered in great numbers were returned to their
families. In the large cities the government now con
ducts in a misrable manner the orphanages. The condi
tions in these institutions are terrible. Sickness and
immoral conditions abound. The inmates are being
taught that there is no rule on earth save the person's
own mind. As a result there is taking place such a
moral degradation among these children that from them
the Bolsheviks should find plenty of future material
for their ranks.
The schools of higher education have absolutely no
equipment such as paper, pencils, or even electricity.
The classes are conducted in the evenings, as the pro
fessors are forced to clean the streets or pick coal dur-

ing the daytime In order to earn their food and clothing.
If the professors refuse to earn their salary by doing
both teaching and manual labor, they are cast into
prison or left to starve. One of the chief attractions of
the universities is, not the learning which they offer,
but the fact that there one may obtain a little food and
at least be in rooms partially warrued.
The Communists or Bolsheviks are paying more and
more attention to educating their representatives. Lenine
has frequently expressed the opinion that the Bolsheviks
must wait and that they can not do all as quickly as
they had expected. They must wait for the future Com
munistic generation and train it.
In the beginning of the Bolshevik reign, the Com
munists had ideas of pacificism but since the Polish
war of 1920 they have entertained strong militaristic
ideas and a strange theory of nationalism which may not
be called Russian but Communistic and which teaches
that Russia is surrounded by many foes and must be
constantly prepared for war.
In solving the Church problem, the Bolsheviks started
out with very repressive and terroristic methods. They
opened movies and dance halls in the churches and con
fiscated church property. In reply to the attacks of the
Bolsheviks on the church, the Russian peasant moved
stolidly on, remaining true to his church and not heed
ing the intervention of the government. Having ex

that Russia is surrounded by many foes and must be

fact that in many villages the peasants offered to pay

church treasures if they would but leave them un
touched. The church properties in themselves were
more of a sentimental rather than of material value

of the Church, were either thrown into prison or killed,

churches been as full as they are today. This is due to
the fact that everything has been taken away from the
peasant save his God and when all else is gone they
turn to the Church as their only refuge.
BARON BOODBERG.
From the first day when the Bolsheviks overturned
the Russian government they have striven to break the
spirit of the Russian people and to gain absolute power
for themselves by destroying three Russian institutions
—private property, family life and the church. The love
of these three things is inborn and deep-rooted in the
Russian peasant, and their destruction means the loss
of all that he holds dear. The Russians have never
developed a complicated social life. The interests of
the large masses were centered in these institutions.
Consequently, in order to gain full power, it was neces
sary for the Bolsheviks to break these institutions.
The matter of destroying private property was easily
accomplished, all property being confiscated by the
government within a month. After two years under this
plan, the government found it impossible to continue
since there was no one to pay the taxes and thus furnish
revenue for the government. As a result the entire
economic policy was changed. The fact that the policy
was changed, however, does in no way imply that the
ideas of the Bolsheviks were changed. As one Bolshevik
said, "We've sheared the sheep. Now we have to have
new sheep growing wool in order to shear them."
Just as the Bolshevik regime took drastic and abrupt
steps with the confiscation of property, so they wanted
to deal with the family life. In 1919 they ordered the
naturalization of all children and declared that all
children of school age should belong to the government.
Soon discords made the new way impossible.
The government had no schools to put the children in,
no teachers to instruct them, and no money to finance
the schools. The plan failed utterly. Children who had
been gathered in great numbers were returned to their
families. In the large cities the government now con
ducts in a misrable manner the orphanages. The condi
tions in these institutions are terrible. Sickness and
immoral conditions abound. The inmates are being
taught that there is no rule on earth save the person's
own mind. As a result there is taking place such a
moral degradation among these children that from them
the Bolsheviks should find plenty of future material
for their ranks.
The schools of higher education have absolutely no
equipment such as paper, pencils, or even electricity.
The classes are conducted in the evenings, as the pro
fessors are forced to clean the streets or pick coal dur-

ing the daytime In order to earn their food and clothing.
