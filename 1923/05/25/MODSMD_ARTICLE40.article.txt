Children of Menlo Park are now
practicing for their annual society cir

years the children have staged cir
cuses and netted substantial sums for
the Home.
The circus is a genuine affair, the big
event of which is Wild West riding.
In addition to the horsemanship, there
will be a variety of specialty stunts,
and pink lemonade and popcorn will
be sold.
A queen of the circus is chosen to
reign over the festivities. The contest
is now being held and will close the
first part of June. Competition for the
honor is keen and the sub-deb who.
wins will have a close race.
