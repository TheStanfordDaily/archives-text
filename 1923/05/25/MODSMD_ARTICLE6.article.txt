"In my opinion, the athletic field is
the best place to make real friends, be
cause there are no artificial barriers,"
said Eunice Biddle, president of W. W.
A., regarding her opinion of the import
ance of athletics for women.
"The Conference has been the big
thing this year. W. A. A. is beginning
to find itself, to feel its individuality and
is able to put things over. Stanford was
fortunate in being president of" the west
ern section of the College Athletic Asso
ciations, and a great deal was accom
plished," she continued.
"The western section was organized on
a formal basis, with each unit more
closely connected than before. This is
accomplished by means of a news bul
letin which is sent to all members. Ques
tions for the National Conference, to be
held at the University of California next
spring, were prepared.
"Track has been a new sport this year
and we hope to standardize it, so that it
will become a permanent spring sport,
with as much interest as hockey and bas
ketball. The track has been improved,
which will be a great help.
"I believe that the new point system,
which has been recently adopted, will
star is added for each subsequent one.
"We have done many things wrong
this year which we hope to remedy next,"
said Miss Biddle, who has been re-elected
president of W. A. A. "Working toward
this, each officer on the board will leave
a full report of her work, with any sug
gestions, for her successor."
It is planned that W.'A. A. will have
a publication of its own, to be issued two
or three times during the year. It will be
a small sheet, containing all news of
athletic activities of interest to the women
of the University.
"All W. A. A. competitions are aided
by the co-operation of the Physical Edu
cation department, headed by Miss Helen
Masters Bunting. We are grateful for
their help and interest," concluded Miss
Biddle.
