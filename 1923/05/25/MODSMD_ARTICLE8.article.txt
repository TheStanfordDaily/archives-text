# WOMEN TO ENTER RACING AND POLO STUNTS IN ANNUAL R.O.T.C. PROGRAM
## TOURNAMENT INFORMAL Horse Show Plans Feature Steeplechasing, Roman, And Cossack Races 
### 
Women's saddle racing and jumping
as well as the usual horse racing, steeple
chasing, polo stunts, and a horse show
are included on the program for the
fourth annual military tournament Sat
urday at 11:30 o'clock on the highway
polo field. Five races, the half-mile flat
race, polo pony, Cossack, steeplechase,
and Roman races are scheduled.
Final practices were held Thursday and
Friday afternoons and "rail birds" patch
ing the different events have already
picked their favorites. The enclosure by
the Polo Clubhouse is resembling the
paddock at some race track with student
fans giving out their tips.
General Mines, the bay horse that
showed speed in the field last year in
both the half mile flat race and the
steeple chase is again the favorite in
these two events with W. R. Wilson, '23,
piloting him. Lightning, the gray polo,
pony of Major Collins carrying fifty
pounds less weight than he did last year
when he ran a close second to General
Hines, is held to be a very close second
with "Shorty" Adams, '25, up.
D. I. Jackson, '26, riding the two |
dappfe greys which won the Roman race'
last year is picked to win, but W. A. j
Clark's, '25, pair which won the event at
the Menlo circus last June is expected to
push the greys to the limit. If the pair of
John Irwin, '25, become imbibed with
some of the dash and recklessness of their
rider they may be the dark horses of
that event.
Jumping in all its forms will be tested
in the four obstacle topping events. First,
will be the military jumping as it is
actually encountered in military field ser
vice or artificially in fox hunting. The
pair jumping contest, in which the two
horses must clear the hurdles at the s'ime
time, will follow the same course as the
military jumping.
In the military jumping S. E. Vaughan,
'23, on Oklahoma and R. E. Barby, '24,
on Princess Pat seem to be the choice out
of the field of fourteen entrants. In the
uncertain high jump B. D. Gill, '22, on
Foster and O. C. Barby, '24, on Mills
College are deemed to have the best
chance to take the blue ribbon and prize. I
In the best rider class some one of the '■
senior class entrants are held to have!
the chance of being chosen.
- Following the main events of the day, J
a group of track stars from the Olympic
Club will compete against "Dink" Tem
pleton's men on the Stanford oval. The
meet will be a strictly informal one, only
first places counting. It will be the last
opportunity for the Card_ trackstcrs to
show their worth before the N. C. C. A.
meet at Chicago, June 16.

urday at 11:30 o'clock on the highway
polo field. Five races, the half-mile flat
race, polo pony, Cossack, steeplechase,
and Roman races are scheduled.
Final practices were held Thursday and
Friday afternoons and "rail birds" patch
ing the different events have already
picked their favorites. The enclosure by
the Polo Clubhouse is resembling the
paddock at some race track with student
fans giving out their tips.
General Mines, the bay horse that
showed speed in the field last year in
both the half mile flat race and the
steeple chase is again the favorite in
these two events with W. R. Wilson, '23,
piloting him. Lightning, the gray polo,
pony of Major Collins carrying fifty
pounds less weight than he did last year
when he ran a close second to General
Hines, is held to be a very close second
with "Shorty" Adams, '25, up.
D. I. Jackson, '26, riding the two |
dappfe greys which won the Roman race'
last year is picked to win, but W. A. j
Clark's, '25, pair which won the event at
the Menlo circus last June is expected to
push the greys to the limit. If the pair of
John Irwin, '25, become imbibed with
some of the dash and recklessness of their
rider they may be the dark horses of
that event.
Jumping in all its forms will be tested
in the four obstacle topping events. First,
will be the military jumping as it is
actually encountered in military field ser
vice or artificially in fox hunting. The
pair jumping contest, in which the two
horses must clear the hurdles at the s'ime
time, will follow the same course as the
military jumping.
In the military jumping S. E. Vaughan,
'23, on Oklahoma and R. E. Barby, '24,
on Princess Pat seem to be the choice out
of the field of fourteen entrants. In the
uncertain high jump B. D. Gill, '22, on
Foster and O. C. Barby, '24, on Mills
College are deemed to have the best
chance to take the blue ribbon and prize. I
In the best rider class some one of the '■
senior class entrants are held to have!
the chance of being chosen.
- Following the main events of the day, J
a group of track stars from the Olympic
Club will compete against "Dink" Tem
pleton's men on the Stanford oval. The
meet will be a strictly informal one, only
first places counting. It will be the last
opportunity for the Card_ trackstcrs to
show their worth before the N. C. C. A.
meet at Chicago, June 16.
Women's saddle racing and jumping
as well as the usual horse racing, steeple
chasing, polo stunts, and a horse show
