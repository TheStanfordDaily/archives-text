Bennie Krueger's Orchestra
2419—"Apple Sauce"
"Wild Papa"
Two Wonderful Fox Trots
Bennie Krueger's Dance Orchestra makes records ex
clusively for Brunswick, because of their absolute fidelity
to tone and rhythm and their clearness and beauty.
Here are two of the best dance selections you have
ever heard. Full of tantalizing saxophone strains with
a rippling accompaniment of brasses and piano. Hear
these two dance records. You'll want them.
Something new every day
New Brunswicl: Records are ready every day.
No waiting. Any Brunswick dealer will gladly
play them for you. Brunswick Records can be
played on any phonograph but are best on The
Brunswick.
