# TEN CARD TRACKSTERS TO ENTER CHICAGO MEET
## "Blink" Williamson Does 440 Run in 50 Seconds Flat Saturday; Arthur Stars With Discus 
### 
( oach Dink Templeton announced this morning that ten men will make up
the Cardinal track squad which will take part in the N. C. A. A. meet in
Chicago next month.
ihe personnel of the team is as follows: sprints, Campbell; hurdles, Falk
and Leistner; 440-yard dash, Williamson and Judah; mile, Elliott; pole vault,
Black; discus, Arthur; javelin, Eskew; hammer, Ludeke.
I he squad was selected largely on the showing the men made in the informal
meet here Saturday. Campbell had little trouble in winning both the 100 and
lU2O and did not have to approach his best times to do so. His marks of 10
flat and 21 2-5 should be good for places in both races.
['.ilk and Leistner split the honors in the hurdles, the former winning the
low barriers and the latter taking the highs. The low hurdles were run over
a one-curve course. The time, 0:25 2-5, was fair, as it was the first time

Leistner had run the low sticks on a 4
curve and Falk has been practicing
but a short time. Leistner's time in
the highs was 0:15 1-5.
"Blink" Does 50 Seconds Flat
"Blink" Williamson seems to have
found himself. He beat Judah to the
tape by less than a yard in 50' seconds
flat. Between these two men, the Cards
should get at least one place in the
quarter mile.
Elliott ran without competition in the
mile and made 4:32. The long, lanky
fellow has done better than 4:30 all
year without much competition and
can probably do several seconds better
if he is pushed.
Arthur Hurls Discus 140 Feet
Big Jim Arthur is the man the
critics are watching as the result of
his heave of nearly 140 feet in the j
discus. If he finds himself in the East
and keeps in the ring, Cardinal sup
porters can expect him to be well up
to the front.
Ludeke threw the hammer 149 feet,
the best he has ever done. He and
Arthur will both enter the shot in all
probability.
Black in the pole vault, and Eskew !
in t.lie javelin, who are making the
trip, did not compete Saturday. Eskew
is capable of heaving the spear better
than 185 feet, and Black can vault
close to thirteen feet under stiff com
petition.
The Cardinal squad will be without
half-milers. Daly's best time of 1:59 4-5
would hardly qualify him in the two
lap event with a flock of Easterners
running under 1:58.
