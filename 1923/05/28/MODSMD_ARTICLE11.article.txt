## USE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT 
### 
After two weeks of deliberation the freshman class has decided that
the automobile amendment is absolutely sound in theory and would work
to the benefit of this University if â€”it applied to the entire student body,
or if it were applied to the incoming freshman class. But, because the
amendment as framed includes its own members, the class as a body has
passed a resolution against it despite the fact that its leaders were in
support of the measure and that more than one-half of its members were
also for it.
Last Thursday afternoon a notice was published in the Daily requesting
that upper-classmen who were opposed to the measure appear in the
freshman class meeting on Friday morning to present their objections so
that the freshmen could see both sides of the case. Comptroller Roth
was to outline the benefits which will be derived from the passage of the
amendment. Not one man of the opposition came forward, so those who
are proposing the amendment sent a man in who was known to be
opposed in order that the freshmen would be able to reach a decision.
This speaker raised objection to the wording of the present amendment,
particularly to the summer quarter and transfer clauses. He has since
confided that he had a freshman planted to make a motion against the
amendment upon the completion of his speech. The plan worked out, the
motion was made and enough of the freshmen stampeded against their
better judgment to pass the resolution, sixty per cent voting for such a
resolution and forty per cent against it.
Granting that the amendment in its present form is not perfect it must
be remembered that rules for enforcing it are still to be drawn up by the
Men's Council. So far as including the entire student body instead of the
two lower classes as at present proposed, it is generally better to learn to
crawl before we walk. It is the hope of the seniors who are backing the
amendment that some future generation will, after seeing the benfits which
will be derived from underclass prohibition, extend the rule to cover the
entire student body. The present freshmen want to see the amendment
apply directly and solely to the incoming freshmen. They would legislate
against a class that is not yet in college although their own records in all
branches of activities are in no way startling nor indicative of their real
establishment in university life.
Early in the year the freshmen promised the heartiest support of the
new system of Senior Control to replace the antiquated style of freshman
discipline. That was early in the year. As they near the completion of
their first year in the University evidences of the sophomoric mind are
appearing and some of the members seem determined to have some sort of
an edge over the incoming freshman class although they have done nothing
remarkable themselves to indicate that they are ready to be joined with
the upperclassmen.
There is a sound, clear-thinking group in the Class of 1926 which has
thought out every problem that has confronted it and has actually done
some constructive work. There is another group that has neither thought
out nor done anything constructive, either for the class or for the Univer
sity, but has been content to be led like sheep in whatever direction any
bell wether went. It is upon the first group that the destinies of the
Class of 1926 and its ultimate success depends. The first group will ballot
tomorrow as they have expressed their convictions, that the amendment
is a real constructive measure.
n Even the man who went into the meeting at the behest of the Senior
leaders and stampeded the frosh did not oppose the measure in principle
but only its present wording.
