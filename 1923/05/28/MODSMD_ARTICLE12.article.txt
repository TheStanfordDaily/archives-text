# 1924 Quad Mixes With Daily Nine In Ball Game; Result Doubtful
## 
### Wamba 1924 Quad 
The other side of the story is more
interesting and accurate. Iffy Itchy
scratchum, the twelve-year-old Japa
nese umpire, wanted to know who ever
won a nine-inning game in seven in
nings. Laying all steam-roller politics
aside, the Daily had it over the Quad
like a tent, and can win every time
the Quad switches the batting order
to put the heaviest hitters up every
inning.
A radiant note came when a Daily
willow-wobbler smacked one of the
blank cartridges served up by the
Quad arm-waver almost off the cam
pus. "Now but one hath bludgeoned
yon apple right roundily, Gar wot!"
sadly remarked the Quad center fielder
as he scuttled intrepidly after it. This
proved to be the blow that killed
Father.
The Daily is supreme in its field,
and baseball comes easy. The Quad
story here given proves that the news
boys won by 11 to 9, and the Quad I
only makes a hit once a year anyhow. |

The intrapublication baseball cham
pionship of the University went to the
1924 Quad Saturday afternoon when
the yearbook's diamond artists cleaned
and pressed the Daily Palo Alto bag
pushers, 7-4, in seven innings.
No errors were made on either side,
and air-tight pitching marked the con
test. Not a hit went beyond the infield
for the first nine innings. Fourteen
men and a pitcher were caught steal
ing second. Double plays were as thick
as the plush on an undertaker's hearse,
and several triple plays were spoiled
only by the failure of the batter to
hit.
By mutual consent, two extra in
nings were played, during which time
the Daily sharpshooters gathered
seven runs, to the Quad's two. It may
be that rumors of a Daily victory are
based on the above fact.
