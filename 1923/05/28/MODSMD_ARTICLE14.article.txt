# ELECTION TOMORROW EMBRACES AUTO RULE, YELL LEADERS, QUAD, A.S.S.U. AND CLASS OFFICERS
## Polls To Be Open From 8:45 A.M. To 2 P. M; Close Race Expected Between Masters, McHose 
### Bob Edwards, ’24 
Judging from the interest shown in the automobile amendment, the selec
tion of head yell leader, the presidential candidates, 1924 Quad, and other
nominees, the election vote tomorrow should be one of the heaviest in the
history of th University, and if all those who nominated men for the Men's
Council will come down and cast a ballot it will be a record-breaker.
We hereby put in a tremendous plea that no one will repeat the stunt com
mitted quite frequently in Friday's special election of marking an "X" where
the ballot says "vote yes or no." And furthermore, it is to be noted that
the voter may register his opinion on all the measures and candidates on the
ballot which is handed to him by the electioneer at the pools. Therefore by

»chance, a freshman might get the
honored distinction of voting for the
president of the Senior Class.
"Peg' Glenn, chairman of the clcction
board, announces that the polls will re
main open from 8:45 until 2 o'clock. The
closing time will be strictly enforced, al
though those in line at 2 o'clock will be
allowed to cast their votes.

Judging from the interest shown in the automobile amendment, the selec
tion of head yell leader, the presidential candidates, 1924 Quad, and other
nominees, the election vote tomorrow should be one of the heaviest in the
history of th University, and if all those who nominated men for the Men's
Council will come down and cast a ballot it will be a record-breaker.
We hereby put in a tremendous plea that no one will repeat the stunt com
mitted quite frequently in Friday's special election of marking an "X" where
the ballot says "vote yes or no." And furthermore, it is to be noted that
the voter may register his opinion on all the measures and candidates on the

Judging from the interest shown in the automobile amendment, the selec
tion of head yell leader, the presidential candidates, 1924 Quad, and other
nominees, the election vote tomorrow should be one of the heaviest in the
history of th University, and if all those who nominated men for the Men's
Council will come down and cast a ballot it will be a record-breaker.
We hereby put in a tremendous plea that no one will repeat the stunt com
mitted quite frequently in Friday's special election of marking an "X" where
the ballot says "vote yes or no." And furthermore, it is to be noted that
the voter may register his opinion on all the measures and candidates on the
ballot which is handed to him by the electioneer at the pools. Therefore by

»chance, a freshman might get the
honored distinction of voting for the
president of the Senior Class.
"Peg' Glenn, chairman of the clcction
board, announces that the polls will re
main open from 8:45 until 2 o'clock. The
closing time will be strictly enforced, al
though those in line at 2 o'clock will be
allowed to cast their votes.
Ballotboxer got over-excited and died
a horrible death on Friday when all the
dark horses and eleventh-hour men
1 started to run for or withdraw from the
race for student body president. Finally,
A1 Masters and "Nip" McHose lined up
on the official ballot.
A1 Masters was president of this year's
Senior Class, and a member of various
class committees —Senior Control Com
mittee and the class Executive Commit
tee. His principal work for the student
body during the past year was done on
the Men's Council of which he was sec
retary. In athletics, Masters made his
circle "S" in soccer in his junior year and
was captain of the 1923 team. He be
longs to Circle "S" Society, Quadrangle
Club, and Geology and Mining Society.
"Nip" McHose has been the junior
member on the Executive Committee this
year and has held various class offices,
having been class manager and chairman
of the Prom Committee. He was on the
art staff of the 1924 Quad, and is a mem
ber of Hammer and Coffin. As forward
on the 1923 basketball varsity, McHose
won his block "S," and was made cap
tain-elect for next year. He belongs to
Skull and Snakes, Quadrangle Club, and
Phi Phi.
Neither man, when interviewed, cared
to state any definite platform on which
to base his candidacy.
William G. Lee will be elected on a
white ballot as the vice-president of the
