# THE 						LAST WORD
## 
### 
There is not a great deal left to be said editorially
concerning the annual student body election tomor
row. The Daily Palo Alto has to create a
greater interest in issues and candidates this year in
me hope that the campus as a whole will be mofx
satisfied with the results- next year.
Undoubtedly the question requiring the most care
ful thought is that of denying the use of automobiles
to underclassmen. Press Club has been given the
use of these columns to bring to a head a campaign
which started several months ago. In today's issue
the organization presents its reactions to the fresh
man meeting the other day in which the measure
was opposed. In voting upon the amendment there
are several jwints to be kept in mind: that, if passed,
rules will be drawn up by Men's Council for the
enforcement of the more flexible features; that it
may be worth a trial as a probable and partial
remedy for some of the unfortunate conditions on
the campus; that all the athletic coaches and most
of the honor organizations on the campus have given
their unqualified support. Most of the voiced oppo
sition has been based upon the arguments that the
measure will be difficult to enforce, will make too
great a distinction between tipperclassmen and
underclassmen, and will set a precedent for reform
moves. Let your vote on the ballot tomorrow be
the result of carefully weighing the arguments and
not merely a stampede based upon personalities.
Next in importance, judging from political moves
and counter-moves, is the selection of a yell-leader.
By defeating the proposal to repeal the amendment
regulating the choice of the man to fill that office,
at the special election Friday, the students gave
themselves an opportunity to select the candidate
whom they really believe best fitted for the position.
There will be two candidates who have been before
the bleachers all year and whose abilities and faults
are well known. There will be two candidates whose
endeavors in other fields have given them a wide
acquaintance on the campus but whose mastery of
the mechanics of the position is unknown. It seems
to be a question of naming the man who will be
given the most willing support of the entire student
body ,and the only way of settling that question is
to make tomorrow's election representative of the
desires of every single person that takes any interest
whatever in Stanford activities.
The sophomore class has a little problem of its
own in the election of the editor and manager of
next year's Quad. Shall their action be based upon
the results of a carefully worked-out tryoutee sys
tem or shall it be temj>ered by political and geo
graphical considerations? There is far less chance
that the Quad board will make an unfair selection
than it is in the case of the entire class, who have
had no way of knowing the actual efficiency and
qualifications of the candidates. The wise thing to
do would lie to make the vote merely an endorse
ment of the recommendations of the board.
As to the other candidates the Daily Palo Alto
can not fairly take sides. It can only hope that
every man and woman will vote for the candidate
who can best fulfill the duties of his office.
And now, whatever the outcome tomorrow, Stan
ford will be able to struggle through it. Policies
of the Administration, and of student government,
the tool of the Administration, will remain about
the same. Tf everyone votes tomorrow, the dissatis
fied student will have less reason to complain about
the mechanics of the system, which he likes to think
he runs.
