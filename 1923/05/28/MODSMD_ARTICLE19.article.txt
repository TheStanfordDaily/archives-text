## THE 						MUTINY OF THE GUNNYSACK 
### Little Scorpion 
"This day the ship went down,
And I was the only thing saved."
—Ibid., or Somebody.
No, I am not delirious, although it is true that I
should be after three days adrift in an open boat with
only some waterlogged hardtack to eat. Of course I had
plenty of tine provisions and a beaker (or is it a
bunker?) of sweet water, but I was afraid I wouldn't
get scurvy if I didn't stick to the ship biscuit, and a
sea story without scurvy is absolutely spoiled.
* * *
All right, all right, I'll begin at the beginning, if you
want rue to. Let xne hark back —a far cry, indeed —to
the day when we crossed the three-mile limit, captain

and crew all on the same
boat. Old Captain Cuttv
hunk, six feet of bronzed
and hard-bitten sailor
man, assembled the fo'-
c'sle hands on the lazar
ette and addressed us
thusly:
"You invertebrate off
spring of dicotyledonous
echinoderms," spake the
skipper, "you're the most
despicable detachment of
campus-sweepings that
ever shipped in the old
clipper Gunnysack, bound
for Malabar in a ballast
cargo of henna and hair-

nets. There are only two bosses on this craft, and I'm
all three of them. Now, all hands lay aloft handsomely,
and focus the liams'ls!"
* * *
I can picture the group yet, the old veteran clipper
skipper backed by two brutal bucko mates, with belay
ing-spikes and marline-pins ready to slap any unwilling
A.B. They faced the shambling group of flotsam mari
ners that we were, the scrapings of a hundred college
campuses, who were working our ways down to Rio
for the summer. We were the meanest raft of quarter
backs and glee clubbers that ever put to sea. The only
man among us who was wise in the ways of the open sea
was Runty Vanderbeeke, who was substitute coxswain
on the Centre College crew. Is it ,any wonder that we
stared rudely when addressed in such a nautical man
ner?
"Look alive, you vestigial-winged vinegard flies!"
roared the hardy salt. "And as you come down, be sure
and kipper the rumbutt!"
One amongs us all had the wit to retain his presence
of mind. His name, as I recall it, was Goldenflick, and
his family had been Harvard professors for generations.
With true alertness, he cried out, "Oi, oi, sir!"
* * *
From that time on the trouble began. Old Cuttyhunk
was a most exacting man. He continually hinted that
we were not up to our work, and often hurt us greatly
by doing over a piece of work as if we had slighted it.
His two lieutenants, O'Finklestein and Mac Levy, were
sullen brutes who only spoke during their tricks at the
wheel.
The meals, I may add, were execrable. We discovered
only too late that there was not a grain of paprika on
board. Mac Levy, the slovenly second mate, served as
cook, and if you believe me, the fellow insisted on serv
ing butter 011 little butter-chips instead of the correct
plate for that purpose. It will not perhaps do dishonor
to one who fell a victim to the doom of that fated vessel
to say that never have I met a second mate who was
more careless about emptying asli-receivers.
• * *
One dark night I was spending the evening sleeping
in the apple barrel. It was then that I discovered the
secret weakness of the mate. He came out of the cabin,
and as the scallops 011 the hatchway scraped his ribs,
I heard a low, senile churckle. (The mate of this hell
ship was ticklish!)
Instantly I saw iii a flash my chance for escape from
this floating coffin. I would masquerade as the mate!
He had 110 chance to cry out. There in the darkness I
cold-bloodedly tickled him to death. Not a chuckle rose
from the oily waves as I heaved him over to the
walruses.
Assuming an Irish accent I took my place by the side
of the captain and reported myself as lost overboard or

in the bilge, so that he
would not suspect. And
he never did. I didn't
myself.
* * *
And then came the
storm. The captain, al
ways a light sleeper, was
on deck first. The ty
phoon blew his whiskers
into little marcelled
waves. The fury of the
lightning showed his hag
gard face. One could

guess that he was worrying that the cargo of henna and
hairnets would shift.
"Show a light, you blubbers!" he shrieked. "Get up!"
A Washington fullback moaned in his sleep and
struck up a feeble chanty,
"Marginal utilities and subjective
Values are found in the Industrial
Uses of gold. The particular form of the
Law of normal price that is oper "
"Help me, for grandma's sake!" shrieked the skipper
again. "Guzzle the port binnacle! Holystone the aft-nor'-
by-west flying pibs'ls! Kindle the mess-kid!"
The only answer came from the best female imper
sonator ever appearing on the U. of Michigan stage.
"Aw, ma, it isn't seven o'clock yet!"
"Will no one help to put this vessel under flying
glubs'ls?"

"Help me, for grandma's sake!" shrieked the skipper
again. "Guzzle the port binnacle! Holystone the aft-nor'-

No, I am not delirious, although it is true that I
should be after three days adrift in an open boat with
only some waterlogged hardtack to eat. Of course I had
plenty of tine provisions and a beaker (or is it a
bunker?) of sweet water, but I was afraid I wouldn't
get scurvy if I didn't stick to the ship biscuit, and a
sea story without scurvy is absolutely spoiled.
* * *
All right, all right, I'll begin at the beginning, if you
want rue to. Let xne hark back —a far cry, indeed —to
the day when we crossed the three-mile limit, captain

and crew all on the same
boat. Old Captain Cuttv
hunk, six feet of bronzed
and hard-bitten sailor
man, assembled the fo'-
c'sle hands on the lazar
ette and addressed us
thusly:
"You invertebrate off
spring of dicotyledonous
echinoderms," spake the
skipper, "you're the most
despicable detachment of
campus-sweepings that
ever shipped in the old
clipper Gunnysack, bound
for Malabar in a ballast
cargo of henna and hair-

nets. There are only two bosses on this craft, and I'm
all three of them. Now, all hands lay aloft handsomely,
and focus the liams'ls!"
* * *
I can picture the group yet, the old veteran clipper
skipper backed by two brutal bucko mates, with belay
ing-spikes and marline-pins ready to slap any unwilling
A.B. They faced the shambling group of flotsam mari
ners that we were, the scrapings of a hundred college
campuses, who were working our ways down to Rio
for the summer. We were the meanest raft of quarter
backs and glee clubbers that ever put to sea. The only
man among us who was wise in the ways of the open sea
was Runty Vanderbeeke, who was substitute coxswain
on the Centre College crew. Is it ,any wonder that we
stared rudely when addressed in such a nautical man
ner?
"Look alive, you vestigial-winged vinegard flies!"
roared the hardy salt. "And as you come down, be sure
and kipper the rumbutt!"
One amongs us all had the wit to retain his presence
of mind. His name, as I recall it, was Goldenflick, and
his family had been Harvard professors for generations.
With true alertness, he cried out, "Oi, oi, sir!"
* * *
From that time on the trouble began. Old Cuttyhunk
was a most exacting man. He continually hinted that
we were not up to our work, and often hurt us greatly
by doing over a piece of work as if we had slighted it.
His two lieutenants, O'Finklestein and Mac Levy, were
sullen brutes who only spoke during their tricks at the
wheel.
The meals, I may add, were execrable. We discovered
only too late that there was not a grain of paprika on
board. Mac Levy, the slovenly second mate, served as
cook, and if you believe me, the fellow insisted on serv
ing butter 011 little butter-chips instead of the correct
plate for that purpose. It will not perhaps do dishonor
to one who fell a victim to the doom of that fated vessel
to say that never have I met a second mate who was
more careless about emptying asli-receivers.
• * *
One dark night I was spending the evening sleeping
in the apple barrel. It was then that I discovered the
secret weakness of the mate. He came out of the cabin,
and as the scallops 011 the hatchway scraped his ribs,
I heard a low, senile churckle. (The mate of this hell
ship was ticklish!)
Instantly I saw iii a flash my chance for escape from
this floating coffin. I would masquerade as the mate!
He had 110 chance to cry out. There in the darkness I
cold-bloodedly tickled him to death. Not a chuckle rose
from the oily waves as I heaved him over to the
walruses.
Assuming an Irish accent I took my place by the side
of the captain and reported myself as lost overboard or

in the bilge, so that he
would not suspect. And
he never did. I didn't
myself.
* * *
And then came the
storm. The captain, al
ways a light sleeper, was
on deck first. The ty
phoon blew his whiskers
into little marcelled
waves. The fury of the
lightning showed his hag
gard face. One could

guess that he was worrying that the cargo of henna and
hairnets would shift.
"Show a light, you blubbers!" he shrieked. "Get up!"
A Washington fullback moaned in his sleep and
struck up a feeble chanty,
"Marginal utilities and subjective

on deck first. The ty
phoon blew his whiskers
into little marcelled
waves. The fury of the
lightning showed his hag
gard face. One could

guess that he was worrying that the cargo of henna and
hairnets would shift.
"Show a light, you blubbers!" he shrieked. "Get up!"
A Washington fullback moaned in his sleep and
struck up a feeble chanty,
"Marginal utilities and subjective
Values are found in the Industrial
Uses of gold. The particular form of the
Law of normal price that is oper "
"Help me, for grandma's sake!" shrieked the skipper
again. "Guzzle the port binnacle! Holystone the aft-nor'-
by-west flying pibs'ls! Kindle the mess-kid!"
The only answer came from the best female imper
sonator ever appearing on the U. of Michigan stage.
"Aw, ma, it isn't seven o'clock yet!"
"Will no one help to put this vessel under flying
glubs'ls?"


"This day the ship went down,
And I was the only thing saved."
—Ibid., or Somebody.
No, I am not delirious, although it is true that I
should be after three days adrift in an open boat with
only some waterlogged hardtack to eat. Of course I had
plenty of tine provisions and a beaker (or is it a
bunker?) of sweet water, but I was afraid I wouldn't
get scurvy if I didn't stick to the ship biscuit, and a
sea story without scurvy is absolutely spoiled.
* * *
All right, all right, I'll begin at the beginning, if you
want rue to. Let xne hark back —a far cry, indeed —to
the day when we crossed the three-mile limit, captain

and crew all on the same
boat. Old Captain Cuttv
hunk, six feet of bronzed
and hard-bitten sailor
man, assembled the fo'-
c'sle hands on the lazar
ette and addressed us
thusly:
"You invertebrate off
spring of dicotyledonous
echinoderms," spake the
skipper, "you're the most
despicable detachment of
campus-sweepings that
ever shipped in the old
clipper Gunnysack, bound
for Malabar in a ballast
cargo of henna and hair-

nets. There are only two bosses on this craft, and I'm
all three of them. Now, all hands lay aloft handsomely,
and focus the liams'ls!"
* * *
I can picture the group yet, the old veteran clipper
skipper backed by two brutal bucko mates, with belay
ing-spikes and marline-pins ready to slap any unwilling
A.B. They faced the shambling group of flotsam mari
ners that we were, the scrapings of a hundred college
campuses, who were working our ways down to Rio
for the summer. We were the meanest raft of quarter
backs and glee clubbers that ever put to sea. The only
man among us who was wise in the ways of the open sea
was Runty Vanderbeeke, who was substitute coxswain
on the Centre College crew. Is it ,any wonder that we
stared rudely when addressed in such a nautical man
ner?
"Look alive, you vestigial-winged vinegard flies!"
roared the hardy salt. "And as you come down, be sure
and kipper the rumbutt!"
One amongs us all had the wit to retain his presence
of mind. His name, as I recall it, was Goldenflick, and
his family had been Harvard professors for generations.
With true alertness, he cried out, "Oi, oi, sir!"
* * *
From that time on the trouble began. Old Cuttyhunk
was a most exacting man. He continually hinted that
we were not up to our work, and often hurt us greatly
by doing over a piece of work as if we had slighted it.
His two lieutenants, O'Finklestein and Mac Levy, were
sullen brutes who only spoke during their tricks at the
wheel.
The meals, I may add, were execrable. We discovered
only too late that there was not a grain of paprika on
board. Mac Levy, the slovenly second mate, served as
cook, and if you believe me, the fellow insisted on serv
ing butter 011 little butter-chips instead of the correct
plate for that purpose. It will not perhaps do dishonor
to one who fell a victim to the doom of that fated vessel
to say that never have I met a second mate who was
more careless about emptying asli-receivers.
• * *
One dark night I was spending the evening sleeping
in the apple barrel. It was then that I discovered the
secret weakness of the mate. He came out of the cabin,
and as the scallops 011 the hatchway scraped his ribs,
I heard a low, senile churckle. (The mate of this hell
ship was ticklish!)
Instantly I saw iii a flash my chance for escape from
this floating coffin. I would masquerade as the mate!
He had 110 chance to cry out. There in the darkness I
cold-bloodedly tickled him to death. Not a chuckle rose
from the oily waves as I heaved him over to the
walruses.
Assuming an Irish accent I took my place by the side
of the captain and reported myself as lost overboard or

in the bilge, so that he
would not suspect. And
he never did. I didn't
myself.
