To the members of the Class of 1925:
Tomorrow you as a class will de
cide by vote a very important question
that affects the whole University. In
voting for manager of the 1925 Quad
you will either vote for the man who
has won the position on merit and
support a system that has given
Stanford her best Quads or you will
vote for a man who has done only 75%
of the amount of work that the first
man has done and support not the
merit system but a system based en
tirely on politics.
The merit system was inaugurated
three years ago after a Quad had com
pletely failed financially because of
the action of politics in elections.
What is going to be the record of the
1925 Quad? That is for us to decide
by ballot. Do you want to make it a
matter of politics or a matter of merit?
If any but the man who has won the
position by points is elected you are
overthrowing the merit system. You
may ask, why? The answer is that if
any other but the man who has won
the position on merit is elected, what
can he tell his tryoutees next year?
It is very obvious that all he could
say would be something like this, "The
merit system is a pretty good thing
as it works out in all the other cam
pus publications, but with the Quad
it doesn't amount to much, as I got
in on politics. If you have not the most
points, that won't mean much, if you
have any kind of an excuse that the
campus body politic wili accept, and
a group of friends that are willing to
back you."
If you grant that sickness is an ex
cuse (Do you?) the following record
shows up. Read it carefully:
The Peninsula Hospital reports that
Noland was in the hospital on the fol
lowing dates: Oct. 23-29, Feb. 9-15, Feb.
20-23, March 11-14.
Thus the year was divided into four
periods at which time the two candi
dates worked in competition. It should
also be noted that '(a considerable
length of time was granted for re
cuperation. The following record re
sults.
Ist Period —Oct. 11 to 23 —
Collections Adds Bonus Totals
Irwin 89 0 20 109
Noland 2S 0 0 28
2nd Period —Oct. 31 to Feb. 9 —
Collections Adds Bonus Totals
Irwin 147 283 0 430
Noland 100 103 10 213
3rd period, Feb. 27 to Mar. 11 —
Quad Sales Adds Bonus Totals
Irwin 320 57 15 392
Noland 143 12 15 170
4th Period, Mar. 26 to May 13 —
Quad Sales Adds Bonus Totals
Irwin 374 312 86 772
Noland 473 206 288 967
Totals for Irwin —1703.
Totals for Noland —1378.
Therefore accordingly granting No
land the benefit of the doubt Irwin
proves to be over 20% the better man
by the merit system.
JOHN HALL, '25.
The above facts and figures have
been presented to me and I find them
correct.
