# Students of Hygiene Class Visit Palo Alto Creamery
## 
### 
Fifty students were conducted by Dr.
Barrow, professor of Physical Educa
tion, to the Palo Alto Creamery re
cently, where a demonstration of sci
entific methods of handling milk was
given. The visitors were offered the
opportunity to inspect the plant, which is
located at 314 University avenue.
The object of the inspection was to
impress upon students the hygienic as
pect of the modern creamery. H. Odeen,
superintendent of the creamery, con
ducted the students through the plant.
This visit was caused by a surprise in
spection made by the State Board of
Health several weeks ago, when Palo
Alto daries were found to show a high
rating.
