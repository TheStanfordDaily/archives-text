# ARGUMENTS STATED FOR AUTO ABOLITION
## Skull and Snakes, Coaches And Officers Advance Views on Measure 
### 
Proponents of the amendment limiting
the use of automobiles on the campus
are firmly convinced that the measure
will be of substantial value to Stanford.
The expectation of advocates of the lim
itation proposal and their refutation of
objections to the measure are brought
out in the following statements:
Coaches Endorse Measure
Stanford's corps of coaches has
heartily endorsed the measure. "The
athletic situation would be a whole lot
better if underclassmen were not per
mitted to own and drive cars," Track
Coach "Dink" Templeton maintains.
"Cars are a waste of time. Think of
the benefits which would come not only
to themselves, but also to their Uni
versity, if students would but discard
such useless pursuit and spend their
spare time in some form of student
activity."
Football Coach Andy Kerr believes
the proposed measure a good one be
cause there are some students who can
not own and operate a machine ju
diciously and who abuse the car priv
ilege.
Coach Harry Maloney also believes
that the passage of the amendment would
benefit athletics. More men would take
part in outside activities, he maintains.
Skull and Snakes Favor
Speaking in behalf of Skull and
Snakes, Bob Cravens, '23, thinks that
the amendment would go a long way
toward the settlement of the freshman
discipline problem next year. He bases
his belief on the fact that all freshmen
will be housed together in one unit, and
conditions would be much more un
favorable if these freshmen were allowed
to drive cars all over the campus when
ever and wherever they wish.
Roth Enthusiastic
"If the measure goes through it will
be the most wonderful thing that has
ever happened to Stanford," Comptroller
Roth says. Speaking not as a Stanford
official, but as a former student, Roth
declares that the amendment would be
the most conclusive evidence yet pre
sented that student control is an actual
potent factor in Stanford life. "The
undergraduate has no legitimate use for
an automobile. When a student is en
gaged in his regular college work and
also in some form of outside activity,
most of his time is already occupied.
The car is only an excuse to get away
from the campus and into trouble.
A1 Masters, '23, president of the
Senior Class, and Horace Edmondson,
'26, head of the freshmen, both endorse
the measure. Lou Minsky, chairman of
the Senior Control Committee, has an
nounced that that body is also unani
mously in favor of the amendment.
The opposition to the amendment is
undoubtedly strong, but not much has
been heard from this side of the ques
tion. The freshmen, at their class meet
ing Friday, were against the measure.
The argument most generally put
forth on this side is that there are too
many rules on the campus already, and
this amendment, if accepted, would only
tend to make matters worse. "Democ
racy at Stanford is not impaired, but if
car ownership were restricted, it cer
tainly would," it is claimed.
