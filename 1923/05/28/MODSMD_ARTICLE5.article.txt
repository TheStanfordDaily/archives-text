# "The Hottentot" Gets Off To Fast Start Saturday
## 
### 
Rehearsing has begun for "The Hot
tentot." Thursday evening the newly
chosen cast clambered up on the Assem
bly Hall stage and went through the
first act with their parts in hand. There
was no rehearsal on Friday; Saturday
morning the cast covered the first act
twicc.
That the stage-calloused cast of the
farce was unable to restrain itself
Thursday night—outbursts came not oc
casionally, but continually—is indicative
of the opulencc of humor in the first act.
Jt was certainly not the general outlook
the cast faccs that kept them humored
during the opening rehearsal; preparing
a thrce-and-a-half-hour play in two
weeks on the threshold of ex'es, is in
sufficient cause for actors to laugh at
their own lines, A. D. Cohen, who is

directing the farcc, is willing to admit.
To prepare the show in stock-time all
the principals selected had to be experi
enced. The three members in the cast
of "The Hottentot" who are stage neo
phytes arc cast in the smaller parts.
The cast stepped off on the right foot
Saturday morning. By the second com
paction of the first act the principals had
become familiar with entrances, cues,
and had a large part of the lines mas
tered, both from the point of memory
and expression. Only one book of the
play is on hand; and as all parts for the
second and third acts are yet to be type
written from the book, the cast will be
handicapped for a few days.
Construction of the stage set will be
begun immediately. The play calls for
rather elaborate settings, but simple
lighting effects and plain costuming.
