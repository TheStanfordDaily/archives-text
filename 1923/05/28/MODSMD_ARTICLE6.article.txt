# Ed Lamb and Students Ride Miles and Miles to See Farm Improvement
## 
### 
Once again Eddie Lamb is tin
foiled, and a lot of gasoline is dis
solved in the atmosphere out the
Country Road. Ed boomed up the
Row in his shiny red kiddie-kar at
7:30 Saturday evening and turned
out toward Portola after accumulat
ing a comet's tail of about twenty
automobiles filled with expectant
students.
After leaping from summit to
summit on the magnificent stretch
of University corduroy road the pro
cession arrived at a point near the
Isolation Hospital, where a sturdy
yeoman was burning off his dry
grass to prevent a possible fire be
ing started by careless picnickers.
A panic-stricken neighbor had
turned in the alarm.
Twenty-five thousand dollars
worth of motor cars turned and
picked their discouraged way home
ward over the pits and peaks.
