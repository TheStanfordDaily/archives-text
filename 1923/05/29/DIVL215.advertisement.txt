Graduation Gifts—
Wilson's Candy
Right Down
the Line
I am making notes of every
blessed occasion for which it
strikes me that Wilson's
candy is the ideal gift. It's
hard to think, because ihe
whole family is in a hubbub
over plans for getting away
for the Summer vacation.
That gives me an idea! 1
am going to phone Wilson's
and give them our forwarding
address, so that we can get a
box of chocolates or bonbons,
or some delicious Wilson's
assortment every week while
we are out of town.
