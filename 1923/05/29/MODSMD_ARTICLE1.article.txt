# ALUMNI DAY PROGRAM HAS PROGRESSIVE AMUSEMENTS
## "Chappies" Will Ferry Grads To Campus in Discarded Hotel Omnibusses Seniors Urged to Reserve Places for Saturday Banquet at Once 
### 
Advance acceptances indicate that
an unusually large number of alumni
will attend the third annual University
Day celebration next Saturday, accord
ing to J. E. McDowell, Alumni Secre
tary. Including yesterday's mail, over
400 have signified their intention of
being present, and the crowd will in
crease rapidly from now on.
Many of the "Old Timers" will ar
rive on Saturday morning trains, and
members of Hammer and Coffin So
ciety will be on hand to meet them
and drag them out to the campus in a
motley collection of decrepit and ante
diluvian busses, reminiscent of kero
sene-lamp days. The Chappies will
make a single concession to modernity
by hitching odious campus automobiles
to the forward ends, instead of old
Dobbin.
Attractive Folders Mailed
Attractive folders have been broad
casted among the alumni, setting forth
the list of events which have been
arranged to entertain them. This pro
gram leaves standing room only from
10 a. m. until midnight, and portly
alumni will probably notice a material
reduction in their physical displace
ment.
The first attraction, at 10 o'clock,
will be the president's review of the
Student R. O. T. C. Awards and com
missions will be presented at 11, and
visiting alumni will sprint to the big
mansion on the hill for President Wil
bur's luncheon. This particular func-'
tion is for visitors only, and campus
and Palo Alto alumni will be free
until 2 p. m., when they will follow to
Dr. Wilbur's home for a general re-!
ception for faculty, seniors, and all
alumni. There will be "talks by live
ones to put you on the boat," quoting
the pamphlet.
Get-Together in Union Court
At 3:30, there will be a big get
together in the court of the Union,,
with the band playing to cover up con
fidential anecdotes of the good old
days. A student entertainment will be
staged here while the band members
recuperate. More music will be offered
an hour later in the Memorial Church,
with the Schubert Club dividing hon-!
ors with an organ recital. This will be
in the way of a vesper service.
From 5:30 until 6:30 will be a rest
period, with the living groups acting
as hosts. Then comes the University
Day dinner at the Pavilion, which is
the big event of the day.
Banquet at Pavilion
Seniors will be allowed to attend
the banquet, and Secretary McDowell
urges that reservations be made at |
once to avoid confusion and possible
disappointment. An extensive program
of entertainment will be presented
here by the undergraduate student
body, and gallery seats for the show
and dance will be open to any one at
75 cents a couple. Two hundred cou
ples can be accommodated. The ban
quet and student production will last
until about 10 o'clock, after which
there will be dancing until midnight.
A number of alumni are expected to
arrive on June 1 for a series of class
, and organization dinners scheduled for !
Friday evening. Old timers of '03,
i '13, and '21 will hold their class re
unions on Friday, and English Club
and Cap and Gown will hold dinners.
The Masonic Club will call a combina
tion meeting and feed in the Women's
| Clubhouse, with talks by William A.
Sherman, Grand Master of California,
Dr. A. C. Reed of the Stanford Medi
cal School, James A. Marshall, Francis
V. Keesling, and C. G. Lambert. The
classes of '93, '98., and '08, will have
separate tables at the main banquet
Saturday evening.
