# QUAD TO BE DISTRIBUTED ON FRIDAY AT OLD UNION
## 
### 
Jhe 1924 Quad will be distributed to
the campus Friday. Distribution will
take place at the \. M. C. A. office in the
Old Union. Both the regular edition and
the Junior Class edition will be ready
by Friday. There are still a few dozen
books left unsold, and a "first come, first
served" policy will be adopted in the
sale of these Friday. It is expected that
the few left will be sold out entirely
Friday morning, so it is advisable for
those who have not yet purchased their
copy of the annual to be on hand early to
avoid disappointment.
One man may get all the Quads that
have been purchased in the house by
bringing the Quad receipts with him, en
dorsed by the owners. Endorsement is
necessary if the year-books are to be
delivered to anyone other than the
owner.
The Quad this year will have a num
ber of features that are innovations not
only for a Stanford year-hook, but for
any annual on the Pacific Coast. Chief
among the new attractions are the air
plane views, taken exclusively' for the
Quad by Ed Strong, '24, in the Quad's
chartered plane. These pictures will
never be shown outside of the annual,
as its contents are copyright, and the
negatives of the air views belong to the
Quad.

For the first time in Quad history, the
photographic section will be run in two
colors, the combination of green and
black giving a lifelike appearance to the
pictures that cannot be obtained with
the ordinary single run of black on a
copper halftone. The decorative work,
different for each one of the eleven
pages of the photographic section, was!
done by Pedro Lemos.
All the action pictures of the various
sports that are shown in the year-book
will be seen for the first time, as they
ha\e not been allowed to be used by any
| other campus publication. Some excep
; tional football and track action pictures i
are promised.
I Probably the biggest single achieve
ment in photography in the entire book
! is the action picture taken of the last ;
basketball game in the Stanford-Cali-1
fornia series in the Pavilion. It is the
i first time an action picture of a basket
ball game has been used by any college
annual on the Pacific Coast. The amount
| of flashlight powder used in procuring
I the picture was more than twice that
usually needed. As a result of the size
of the flash, small details are easily dis
tinguishable. The photograph shows the
i crowd banked around the sides of the
court, with the players in action in the
I center of the floor.

only for a Stanford year-hook, but for
any annual on the Pacific Coast. Chief
among the new attractions are the air
plane views, taken exclusively' for the
Quad by Ed Strong, '24, in the Quad's
chartered plane. These pictures will
never be shown outside of the annual,
as its contents are copyright, and the
negatives of the air views belong to the
Quad.

For the first time in Quad history, the
photographic section will be run in two
colors, the combination of green and
black giving a lifelike appearance to the
pictures that cannot be obtained with
the ordinary single run of black on a
copper halftone. The decorative work,
different for each one of the eleven
pages of the photographic section, was!
done by Pedro Lemos.
All the action pictures of the various
sports that are shown in the year-book
will be seen for the first time, as they
ha\e not been allowed to be used by any
| other campus publication. Some excep
; tional football and track action pictures i
are promised.
I Probably the biggest single achieve
ment in photography in the entire book
! is the action picture taken of the last ;
basketball game in the Stanford-Cali-1
fornia series in the Pavilion. It is the
i first time an action picture of a basket
ball game has been used by any college
annual on the Pacific Coast. The amount
| of flashlight powder used in procuring
I the picture was more than twice that
usually needed. As a result of the size
of the flash, small details are easily dis
tinguishable. The photograph shows the
i crowd banked around the sides of the
court, with the players in action in the
I center of the floor.
Jhe 1924 Quad will be distributed to
the campus Friday. Distribution will
take place at the \. M. C. A. office in the
Old Union. Both the regular edition and
the Junior Class edition will be ready
by Friday. There are still a few dozen
books left unsold, and a "first come, first
served" policy will be adopted in the
sale of these Friday. It is expected that
the few left will be sold out entirely
Friday morning, so it is advisable for
those who have not yet purchased their
copy of the annual to be on hand early to
avoid disappointment.
One man may get all the Quads that
have been purchased in the house by
bringing the Quad receipts with him, en
dorsed by the owners. Endorsement is
necessary if the year-books are to be
delivered to anyone other than the
owner.

ber of features that are innovations not
