# Dogs Fight and "Roughs" Faint As Women Pull Paddock Party
## 
### 
Even the sun rose early last Saturday
morning and hastened to a point of van
tage to view the first annual women's
track meet, which has become a Stanford
tradition in the last three days. Comp
troller Roth dedicated the new oval, but
so far as we can find out the sun was the
only one who saw him do it.
A man can't be expected to know much
about women's track, but an enthusiastic
crowd of roughs were on hand to pick
up some pointers. Track Coach "Dink"
Tcmpleton was allowed to run wild
around the infield, and strolled from
hence to whence with a slightly stunned
expression on his face. He was awfully
polite all the way through, however.
Some two hundred little girls brought

probably eighty little dogs to sec the fun,
and the ensuing dog-fights to the accom
panimcnt of futile wails were no small
feature of the morning's enjoyment. They
were about the only thing intelligible to
an uninitiated male reporter.
They ran off the 50-yard dash during
a dog-fight, and the Press Box missed the
whole thing. According to the announcer
Stanford swept all four places, so it must
have been worth seeing. During the next
sprint one of the flying Venuscs tripped
over a spotted fox terrior and measured
her length upon the new track. She was
found to be exactly five feet, said the
announcer. The time was announced as
101-5 scconds, and several males were
carried out in a faint. Then it came out
that it was the 75-yard dash, which seems
! probable.
The bar on the high-jump standards
was set at about eight feet during the
morning, and murmurs of respect came
| from the crowd. One skeptic said that if
they couldn't clear it in one jump they
might in two or three. When the jumping
started, however, they lowered the pole
to knee-high. The other must have been
a fine dramatic touch. The woman ran
straight for the bar and jumped like a
man who steps on a rattlesnake. In spite
of this the winner cleared four feet and
could have done more if her circus-tent
costume hadn't spoiled the leap. One
j might as well try to pole-vault in a bath-
I robe!
The relay was a ding-dong race all the
way round, with Sophomore coming up
fast in the home stretch and Senior cop
ping by a hair-net. Sophomore ran
splendidly, giving away at least fifteen
I pounds, but Senior coasted over the line
in the fast time of 1:TO. with Freshman
i and Junior nowhere. The bookies broke
about even.
The 6-pound shot put was anybody's
; until "Dink" broke down under the
strain and demonstrated the standard
I Hartranft technique to one of the con
! testants. The lucky lady forthwith
hurtled the capsule through space for 29
feet 6 inches while the others wept bit
terly and cast soiled glances at the unper
turbed official. The mark was never
threatened.
The city papers said that the sopho
mores won the meet, so somebody must
have kept score. It was a splendid meet.

about women's track, but an enthusiastic
crowd of roughs were on hand to pick
up some pointers. Track Coach "Dink"
Tcmpleton was allowed to run wild
around the infield, and strolled from
hence to whence with a slightly stunned
expression on his face. He was awfully
polite all the way through, however.
Some two hundred little girls brought

probably eighty little dogs to sec the fun,
and the ensuing dog-fights to the accom
panimcnt of futile wails were no small
feature of the morning's enjoyment. They
were about the only thing intelligible to
an uninitiated male reporter.
They ran off the 50-yard dash during
a dog-fight, and the Press Box missed the
whole thing. According to the announcer
Stanford swept all four places, so it must
have been worth seeing. During the next
sprint one of the flying Venuscs tripped
over a spotted fox terrior and measured
her length upon the new track. She was
found to be exactly five feet, said the
announcer. The time was announced as
101-5 scconds, and several males were
carried out in a faint. Then it came out
that it was the 75-yard dash, which seems
! probable.
The bar on the high-jump standards
was set at about eight feet during the
morning, and murmurs of respect came
| from the crowd. One skeptic said that if
they couldn't clear it in one jump they
might in two or three. When the jumping
started, however, they lowered the pole
to knee-high. The other must have been
a fine dramatic touch. The woman ran
straight for the bar and jumped like a
man who steps on a rattlesnake. In spite
of this the winner cleared four feet and
could have done more if her circus-tent
costume hadn't spoiled the leap. One
j might as well try to pole-vault in a bath-
I robe!
The relay was a ding-dong race all the
way round, with Sophomore coming up
fast in the home stretch and Senior cop
ping by a hair-net. Sophomore ran
splendidly, giving away at least fifteen
I pounds, but Senior coasted over the line
in the fast time of 1:TO. with Freshman
i and Junior nowhere. The bookies broke
about even.
The 6-pound shot put was anybody's
; until "Dink" broke down under the
strain and demonstrated the standard
I Hartranft technique to one of the con
! testants. The lucky lady forthwith
hurtled the capsule through space for 29
feet 6 inches while the others wept bit
terly and cast soiled glances at the unper
turbed official. The mark was never
threatened.
The city papers said that the sopho
mores won the meet, so somebody must
have kept score. It was a splendid meet.
Even the sun rose early last Saturday
morning and hastened to a point of van
tage to view the first annual women's
track meet, which has become a Stanford
tradition in the last three days. Comp
troller Roth dedicated the new oval, but
so far as we can find out the sun was the
only one who saw him do it.
