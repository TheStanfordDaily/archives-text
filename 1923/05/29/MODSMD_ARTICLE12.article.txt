"Write me a feature, you adjective
thus-and-so," remarked the campus edi
j tor this morning, applying his sixteen
| pound boot to the nearest typewriter
and reducing it to a heap of tinkling
; fragments. Whereupon the entire staff
j stopped trying to make the heads count
I and rushed forth into the campus look
ing for something wrong. There wasn't
I even a dog in a classroom.
How easy it would be to write a fea
ture IF: it would snow; it would earth
quake ; Eddie Lamb would appear in a
Prince Albert with spats; every fresh
man would wear his "dink;" the women
would follow up t*ack with football;
j "Sticky" would start bootlegging; the
; frenzied politicians would sleep all day
today. The student body could create
manifold possibilities for the much
prized feature story, but they insist upon
| doing little or nothing which might get
' them laughed at or kicked out of col
lege. Dammit! There ain't no justice!
