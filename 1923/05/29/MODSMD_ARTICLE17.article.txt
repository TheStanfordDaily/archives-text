# FRATERNITIES ADOPT LONG SEASON PLAN FOR RUSHING
## Trago Elected President of Conference; New Control Board Chosen Representatives Will Attend Greek Letter Meeting in New York City 
### 
The new rushing system, to be em
ployed by all fraternities next year,
was outlined before the Interfraternity
Conference last night by the Board of
Control. Two closed periods—the en
tire autumn quarter and most of the
spring quarter—linfcted rushing during
the winter quarter, and pledging at the
end of the second week of the spring
quarter are the principal points in
next year's plan.
Gene Trago was elected president
of the conference for next year. The
other officers elected last night are:
Secretary, Russell Langford; Board oC
Control, Lester Dills. James Clark,
George Baker, and Linn Farish. These
men will take office at the beginning
of the autumn quarter.
Isolation Period Strict
The isolation periods of the accepted
rushing system will be closed to all
dating and rushing; natural contact
on the Quad will be allowed only. The
intention is to make winter quarter
rushing as simple as possible. Fresh
men can be. rushed Wednesday, Fri
day, and Saturday noons and nights,
and Sunday noon. This will allow the
freshman seven dates a week. The
period will continue through to the
second Saturday of the spring quarter.
No silent period will follow; bidding
will be conducted by the fraternity
lawyer, the next day, Sunday. The
system embraces new freshmen and
transfers with less than eighty hours
of credit.
The scheme is based on the assump
tion that it will be of benefit to the
University if the freshmen should live
together and justify their existence
during the first months without inter
ference of fraternity rushing and
house duties. This, the board believes,
can be accomplished without harm to
the fraternities. The long system of
rushing will work in greatest harmony
with the University's new plan for
the housing of freshmen in Encina.
The fraternities believe that this sys
tem will not only be to the best ad
vantage of the University, but will
instigate freshmen to work harder
than under a short scheme. The fresh
man who hopes to make a fraternity
will naturally realize that he will have
to go on more than his prep school
reputation. This incentive should be
of value to athletics and other campus
activities.
The purpose of bidding in the early
spring quarter is to keep fraternities
from rushing hard near finals, which
would follow if pledging occurred at
the end of the winter quarter. Spring
pledging also gives the freshman an
opportunity to make up his mind at
leisure, and affords the chance of talk
ing matters over with his family.
This rushing system will be ex-
plained at an assembly in Enclna next
year to the new freshman class. Re
sponsibility for the observance of rules
will rest with every freshman as well
as with every fraternity; the freshman
who violates any regulation will be
held to account.
The National Interfraternity Confer- i
ence has invited Stanford to send
representatives to the convention,;
which will be held at New York the
middle of next November. This is the
first time representatives have been
summoned from the college confer
ences.
Fraternity business will be com- j
pleted for this year at the final meet-1
ing of the conference and, board next!
week. j

Gene Trago was elected president
of the conference for next year. The
other officers elected last night are:
Secretary, Russell Langford; Board oC
Control, Lester Dills. James Clark,
George Baker, and Linn Farish. These
men will take office at the beginning
of the autumn quarter.
Isolation Period Strict
The isolation periods of the accepted
rushing system will be closed to all
dating and rushing; natural contact
on the Quad will be allowed only. The
intention is to make winter quarter
rushing as simple as possible. Fresh
men can be. rushed Wednesday, Fri
day, and Saturday noons and nights,
and Sunday noon. This will allow the
freshman seven dates a week. The
period will continue through to the
second Saturday of the spring quarter.
No silent period will follow; bidding
will be conducted by the fraternity
lawyer, the next day, Sunday. The
system embraces new freshmen and
transfers with less than eighty hours
of credit.
The scheme is based on the assump
tion that it will be of benefit to the
University if the freshmen should live
together and justify their existence
during the first months without inter
ference of fraternity rushing and
house duties. This, the board believes,
can be accomplished without harm to
the fraternities. The long system of
rushing will work in greatest harmony
with the University's new plan for
the housing of freshmen in Encina.
The fraternities believe that this sys
tem will not only be to the best ad
vantage of the University, but will
instigate freshmen to work harder
than under a short scheme. The fresh
man who hopes to make a fraternity
will naturally realize that he will have
to go on more than his prep school
reputation. This incentive should be
of value to athletics and other campus
activities.
The purpose of bidding in the early
spring quarter is to keep fraternities
from rushing hard near finals, which
would follow if pledging occurred at
the end of the winter quarter. Spring
pledging also gives the freshman an
opportunity to make up his mind at
leisure, and affords the chance of talk
ing matters over with his family.
This rushing system will be ex-
plained at an assembly in Enclna next
year to the new freshman class. Re
sponsibility for the observance of rules
will rest with every freshman as well
as with every fraternity; the freshman
who violates any regulation will be
held to account.
The National Interfraternity Confer- i
ence has invited Stanford to send
representatives to the convention,;
which will be held at New York the
middle of next November. This is the
first time representatives have been
summoned from the college confer
ences.
Fraternity business will be com- j
pleted for this year at the final meet-1
ing of the conference and, board next!
week. j
The new rushing system, to be em
ployed by all fraternities next year,
was outlined before the Interfraternity
Conference last night by the Board of
Control. Two closed periods—the en
tire autumn quarter and most of the
spring quarter—linfcted rushing during
the winter quarter, and pledging at the
end of the second week of the spring
quarter are the principal points in
next year's plan.
