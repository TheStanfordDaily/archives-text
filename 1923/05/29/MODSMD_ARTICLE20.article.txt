# PITY THESE MEN
## 
### 
Congratulations are in order this evening. This
is the time of the year when ambitions are realized
and student leaders recognized.
However, there are live men for whom the Daily
Pai.o Alto and others who are acquainted with the
duties of these men have nothing but sympathy and
condolences. It is hard to reconcile the honor
which comes from being a member of Men's Coun
cil with the unpleasantness of the work involved —
and it is a noble characteristic which inspires men
with the desire to guard the moral welfare of their
comrades.
For, of course, it is the Men's Council which regu
lates college discipline. Who would dare insinuate
that recommendations for action come first from
Administration officials, or if the action taken is not
exactly in accord with what these officials desire, the
matter is returned to the Council for consideration?
Who would have the audacity to suggest that fre
quently members of the body act as they do, against
their personal wishes, merely because they feel an
obligation to the Powers to justify their position in
some way? Yes, discipline was placed entirely in
the hands of students some years ago.
And if there were a person so utterly foolish and
unseeing as to intimate these things, would it be
through any desire of eliminating the farce through
which the student body is being deceived into think
ing it acts as its own disciplinary agent? Hardly.
The present organization of Men's Council is just
as it should be, and probably serves to temper to a
degree the measures which might come directly
from the Administration. As long as there are men
at Stanford who are willing to act for both faculty
and students, getting little thanks from either, the
arrangement for regulating recalcitrants should re
main. There were eighteen of them this year, so we
need have little fear for our precious student gov
ernment. Among their number will always be a few
who conscientiously feel it their civic duty to keep
the rest of the campus straight—a quality much to
be admired.
No one who has ever encountered this system can
feel any bitterness toward the individual members,
toward the body, or toward the Administration.
There is occasion to smile a little at the seriousness
with which the game is played and there is occasion
to pity the men who are selected to move the check
ers about.
