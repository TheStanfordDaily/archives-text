Among - its horde of traditions, Stanford has a few
that are really worthy of being called by so dignified
a name. One of these is the recognition of the re
spect in which Dr. Jordan and Dr. Wilbur are held
by tipping the cap when passing these men.
The other day Dr. Jordan passed a freshman on
the Quad and removed his hat, as is his custom. In
stead of having the salute returned he was greeted
by a puzzled and confused "How d' do" from the
freshman.
A word to those unacquainted with this little
courtesy will be undoubtedly sufficient to guarantee
its continuation.
