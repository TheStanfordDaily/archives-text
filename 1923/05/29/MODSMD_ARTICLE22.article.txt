WHILE WE ARE recommending the acquisition
of a wide circle of friends before leaving college
walls, it is not a bad idea to get acquainted with the
men whose ta>k it is to remain and keep the Uni
versity in running order. There would be much less
criticism of the way in which the Administration
acts if there were a little more co-operation and
acquaintance between President Wilbur and his staff
and the student body. They are really quite likable
persons and know slightly more about how an edu
cational institution should be managed than the
average collegiate.
