"Contemporary writers lament with increasing em
phasis the drugging materialism of American life. Higher
education, they unanimously agree, is the remedy for
this deadening tendency. But is it?
"What does the university graduate take away with
liis diploma after four years of college training? A
capacity to earn his living, 'to make money* is the
favorite phrase, a technical training in engineering or
law or medicine, perhaps, but above all he has acquired
a transcending desire for wealth. After the college
period of consort with the privileged youth of the nation
the summum bonum of life becomes thoroughly Bab
bittized. Life is without meaning or enjoyment apart
from the mechanics of the money-making world.
"Does the university graduate acquire a sense of
values other than commercial? an inner reserve of
enjoyment? a taste for good reading? a comprehensive
idea of the unity of art and science? Cardinal Newman
in his 'Idea of a University' states that all the branches
of knowledge compose a great circle and the aim of a
university is to teach its students to classify any given
fact upon its circumferance. This is a lofty ideal,
indeed, but possible of approach even in materialistic
America.
"Though James and Genevieve are now sent to college
by parents whose eyes are propped open with dollar
marks, there is yet hope for the spiritual culture, the
development of the finer nature of the younger genera
tion. America is a young country without an ancient
storehouse of art and literature and refinement. It is
the duty of us all to lay the cornerstone to this treasure
liouse for the spiritual welfare of the future. Then
universities will not grind out graduates like so many
standardized Chevrolets. Emerson had the right concep
tion when he said that an educational institution can
serve only as it aims not to drill but to create, create
individuality.
"The measure of a man lies in his answer to the
question 'What do you like?' There is cause for wailing
if after four university years the prompt replies are
mole-skin coats, twelve-cylinder motor cars, diamond
rings, golf tournaments and girl-and-music shows. These
things are not bad in themselves but they are tragic if
they show the measure of our mental development.
"Have you ever considered how modern college youth
derives the greater part of its joy and rcreation from ex
ternal stimuli? saxaphonic yowls, nougat specials and
thrilling movies, innocent enough but indicative of little
development. These tastes may be developed anywhere.
A university should give a capacity of spiritual enjoy
ment, spiritual as opposed to materialistic. A realization
that education is a preparation for living not for money
making is the most effective antidote to American
materialism,
"In spite of the lamentations of Sherwood Anderson
and Sinclair Lewis and Ludwig Lewisohn, 1 believe the
tendency of most of us is away from materialism. For
we all admit secretly that we are a little weary of un
ceasing syncopation, feeble-minded movie plots, insipid
conversations and silly magazine serials with which the
American public is wont to amuse itself."

A little Chopin; light the tapers. The Flapper is dead,
defunct, pass 6!

"Flapperism was a moot question last year and by
this time should be a thing of the past along with the
short skirt and hair. But there seems to be a final
fiare-up, and a recent magazine states, 'Colleges as well
as Fifth Avenue and Main Street are full of the Flapper
and her peculiar complex.' The author bases his con
clusions upon 'special investigation carried on in vari
ous colleges.' What can an 'investigator' hope to know
about the inner feelings and thoughts of a modern girl,
especially a co-ed?
"The world, as everyone knows, is drastically altered
socially, economically, and religiously. There is 110
place for the old-fashioned girl and her 'hope chest.'
The world does not need hope chests as it needs alert
women whose hearts and minds co-operate for the ad
vancement of human interests. And say what you will, it
is the college girl who supplies this need. Are they
Flappers? There is a small per cent in every community
who are irresponsible and selfish, whose chief ambition
is self-enjoyment. But it is a small per cent. The ma
jority of girls who come to college do so with definite
ambitions, not merely to find a husband.
"Flapperism was a phase, or more generally a pose.
Real Flappers are surprisingly scarce and this phase,
like all others, has passed. Why not acknowledge the
fact and let the question drop? Why not realize once
for all that college women do not merit this title and
that they are the women whom in the future may be
most surely counted upon." —M. EBRICHT, '26.
