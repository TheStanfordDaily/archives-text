"We will have fun—oiu! much to
gether. But not all on the stage. I talk
little, here and there, on the stage, but
you—you must stay where you are and
speak only between times. But we will
both peek through the curtains, listen,
and see all the funnv things they do.
We will see everything, and know all
that goes on.
"N' oubliez pas! June 13. You will
stay here one evening more. S'il vous
plait! We will have such a good time,
M. Etudiant. And you shall forget those
tired days—those bad, bad exes. Then
when "The Hottentot" has run his race,
and we laughed at all—then you shall go
home—much the happier. Au revoir !"
