# HELEN WHITNEY TO CARRY LEAD IN "HOTTENTOT"
## Director A.D. Cohan Secures Experienced Actress to Fill Place in 1923 Farce 
### 
Helen Whitney, '24, will take the
role of Peggy Fairfax, the feminine
lead of "The Hottentot." The change
became necessary with the withdrawal
of Augusta Corey, who was playing as
Mrs. Chadwick, one of the principal
character parts, from the cast. Mabel
Ferry, who was cast as Peggy Fairfax,
has been shifted to the role of Mrs.
Chadwick.
Miss Whitney Has Experience
Miss Whitney appeared in the
"Football Frothies of '22" this college
year; this is the first straight part she
has taken since last summer, when
she carried the women's lead in "Teq
For Three." She is directing one of the
one-act plays to be given by the thea
ter workshop class, and may take part
in two others. As Huguette, the woman
of the streets of "If I Were King,"
Helen Whitney probably displayed her
dramatic capacities most effectively.
She also appeared in "You Never Can
Tell," the 1924 sophomore play, "Up
On a Ladder," the 1923 Junior Opera,
the women's pageant last year, "Tents
of the Arabs," a theater workshop play
by Dunsany, "One in a Hundred," a
theater workshop play by Martin.
Lead Not Emotional
The part of Peggy Fairfax, like most
feminine comedy leads, is not a diffi
cult character part, nor does it require
much emotional acting; rather, its
success depends upon the personal
charm and stage presence of the act
ress. A difficult interpretation such
as that of Huguette could not be mas
tered in so short a time as is now
left for rehearsing; but Helen Whit
ney's stage experience should enable |
her to give a good portrayal of a role
which is not difficult, yet one which
can be made very colorful by her per
sonality.
Mabel Ferry seems cast to better
advantage as Mrs. Chadwick than as
Peggy Fairfax. Mrs. Chadwick is per
haps the most distinctive character
role among the feminines, and it calls
for the absorption of strong manner
isms and attitudes.
The cast rehearsed all morning and
in the evening yesterday. All the parts
are now typed out, so that the cast is
no longer handicapped. All three acts
of the farce were several times re
hearsed. The principals have learned
the lines, cues, and entrances of the
entire first act, and yesterday acquired
a hold on the other two acts. Cohan,
director of the farce, expects to get in
about six more rehearsals before ex
aminations.
