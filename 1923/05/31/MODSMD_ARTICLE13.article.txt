# EUPHRONIA DEBATES WRANGLERS TONIGHT
## 
### 
The outcome of the Wranglers-Eu
phronia debate, to be held in the Little
Theater at 7:30 tonight, will determine
the possessor of the campus cham
pionship cup offered by Phi Delta Phi,
honorary law fraternity.
The question is: "Resolved, That
the United States should adopt Presi
dent Harding's proposal for participa
tion in an international court of jus-1
tice." Grace Strobel, '24, and Laura
Austin. '23, will uphold the negative
for Wranglers while Percy Spencer, |
'25, and Stanley Weigle, '26, will argue
the affirmative for Euphronia. Nestoria
has been defeated by Euphronia.
With the exception of Wranglers' de
bate against Euphronia, which was
won by the freshman women's team,
this will be the first occasion for many
years in which the women have taken
part in forensics.
