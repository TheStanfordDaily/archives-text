# STUDENTS TO BE ALUMNI HOSTS NEXT SATURDAY
## Class of 1923 Will Assume Graduate Status for First Time on University Day 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Seniors and alumni will divide hon
ors fairly equally on Saturday, the
annual University Day and alumni Old
Home celebration. Upon them will rest
the duties of the host, and let it be
said in passing that it is an excellent
opportunity to line up the old job of
work which will now be an essential
in order to keep the fabled wolf away
out in the street.
Hammer and* Coffin will star in the
opening act, Avhcn they haul the
middle-aged sons of the Stanford Red
from the Southern Pacific station to
the campus in a fleet of Civil War
hotel busses drawn by automobiles.
The military department will take up
the morning with polo and reviews,
and then the seniors will take up the
burden.
After a luncheon at President Wil
bur's residence for visiting alumni
only, seniors will be expected to join
with them in a reception on the lawn,
where they will meet the alumni on
common footing. The 1923 class will
be recognized for the first time as
graduates rather than collegians. The
pass-word will be "Much obliged to
meet you." and the appropriate answer
"How about a job?" This is set tor 2
o'clock.
At 3:30 the seniors will lead the
way to the court of the new Union for
a band concert, light refreshments,
entertainment, and conversation. Op
portunity will be afforded for inspec
tion tours- of the new buildings and
other points of interest, and a propor
tion of seniors will thus have a chance
to see the Museum, Art Gallery, and
Memorial Church. The prime objective
of all this is "get acquainted."
An organ recital and Schubert Club
concert in the church will All in the
lime until 5:30, which has been set
aside as (he rest hour. All living
groups will hold open house at this
time, and unatttached alumni will be
taken care of by a committee of
seniors.
Theoretically, then, even the most
short-winded of the old-timers should
be thoroughly recuperated in time for
the main dinner in the basketball
pavilion at 6:30. Seniors may also gain
entrance to the banquet provided they
make reservations in time, and all stu
dents will be admitted to the gallery
as spectators at 75 cents a couple. The
dinner will last until 10, spiced up
with a number of song and dance acts
under the direction of Sam Menden
liall. There will be dancing until mid
night, when the solar calendar official
ly brings University Day to a close.
Tables at the banquet, will seat ten,
twelve, or fourteen persons, and reser
vations may be made to handle groups
of this size if they wish to be placed
together.
