# FLORENCE HEYWOOD LECTURES ON OLD FRENCH PAINTINGS
## "Most Beautiful Book in World" Illustrated in Tuesday Lecture 
### 
"Art is the perfect creation of what
ever the artist undertakes to create,"
said Florence Heywood, '02, in her illus
trated lecture on "The Most Beautiful
Book in the World,*" given last Tues
day evening in the Little Theater. "Sub
ject matter has very little to do with
art. The painter may select a beautiful
subject and present it badly, or he may
choose a very common theme for his
painting and give it an artistic treatment.
The picture then becomes a work of art.
Great masters had the rare gift of know
ing how to select splendid subject mat
ter and how to present it artistically.
"Craftsmanship is not artistic presen
tation, but the ability to handle the con
tents of a picture," said Miss Heywood.
"It corresponds to the technique of a
pianist.
"There arc three things that are requi
sites of a masterpieceâ€”selection of the
subject matter, the attempted artistic
presentation, and the craftsmanship."
Miss Heywood gave a brief history
of "The Most Beautiful Book in the
World," which is kept in the Musee
Conde in the Chateau Chantilly. This
volume was a prayer book prepared for
the Due du Berry by the Limbourg
brothers in 1410. It is one of the five
Book of Hours that are left of the Due
du Berry's original set of eighteen. Most
of the nobles of this time had these very
elaborate prayer books painted for them
by the best artists.
There arc twelve scenes in the book,
illustrating the months of the year.
These paintings are noted for the re
markable blues and greens of their color
schemes. Some of the pictures have the
rhythm and motion of line that are seen
in the works of the more modern French
artist, Millet.
Miss Heywood also showed some
slides on the works of Fouquet, a painter,
who lived during the reign of Charles
VII of France. Fouquet had studied
in Florence and had seen the master
pieces of Fra Angelico and Fra Lippo.
He was one of the first realists of France
who used slight touch of the dramatic.
