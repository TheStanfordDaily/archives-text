# "HELLO, FELLERS"
## 
### 
One of these days we shall return to the campus —
balcl and reminiscent. We shall want to be wel
comed back into the fold as members of the Stan
ford family. For, whatever our present grievances,
experiences of graduates show us that a short ab
sence brings regrets and desires for return. We
shall not want to be greeted as strangers.
Saturday is University Day. Alumni will be all
over the place hand-shaking and renewing acquaint
ances. They will be watching us closely, for there
have been many unfavorable rumors concerning the
trend of campus sentiment and actions. "The old
place is not the same," they say. Of course, it isn't
the same. A fine university it would be if 1923
found us thinking and doing exactly the things that
were thought and done in the nineties. But we can
show the visiting alumni Saturday that we are not
such a bad lot, after all, and that Stanford still has
a few years of grace before being plunged into the
depths of degradation. The only way we can do
that is to mix with them and treat them as equals.
They do not necessarily want to be shown respect.
That is too dignified. What they want is a welcome
that is sincere. They are entitled to it.
Athletics for the year are ended. Tuesday saw
the best election the campus has ever known, and
officers were chosen for next year who are truly rep
resentative of what the majority wants and not the
favorites of any political faction. Having closed
up most of our extra-curricular activity for the year,
we can devote the week-end to entertaining those
who came before us.
