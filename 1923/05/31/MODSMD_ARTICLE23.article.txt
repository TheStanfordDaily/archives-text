# THE 						PHILISTINES RULE

### 
It is a day of frankness. Each day brings forth
some new book which "boldly looks the facts in the
face." We must not become victims of sentimental
ism. We must search for ulterior motives and call
the old vices and virtues by new names. We must
scoff at the Babbitry and uplift movements.
In doing so we perhaps acquire a few friends who
admire our "vision" and intellectual darling. At the
same time we lose a good many who can see no use
in substituting analysis of motives for praise of re
sults. Admitting certain facts to be true, they be
lieve that it is just as well to keep quiet about them
—even to practice a little honest hypocricy in ex
pressing ourselves for public consumption.
College students like to think they are frank with
each other. Just where to place that characteristic
in the category of qualities is a question for discus
sion. A little discretion to temper the frankness
would perhaps make our relations more pleasant.
But to caution youth to lie discreet is a fond and
idle act.
