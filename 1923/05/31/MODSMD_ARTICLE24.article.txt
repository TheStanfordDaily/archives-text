APPRECIATION OF THE TRUST placed in
them by the institution of Senior Control was shown
by a few members of the Class of 1926 a night or so
ago, when these men, still suffering from an acute
attack of prep-schooMtis, painted a large green "26"
on the Law School steps.
Childish effort such as this is one of the few argu
ments in favor of the retention of freshmen disci
pline; however, opinion in the class itself should
curb any further efforts toward misplaced humor by
those members of the class who have failed to gather
anything whatsoever from an eight months' stay
here.
â€”H. M., '24.
