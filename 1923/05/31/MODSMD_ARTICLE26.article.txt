THE WRECK OF THE GUNNYSACK
(Continued from Monday)
We looked from one to another hopelessly. "Maybe he
meant to scuttle the mizzenm'st," suggested a Princeton
bridge major.
"I'm fearfully afraid we don't know our eggs, old
dear," tactfully began a Yale golf captain.
"For the last time I ask you, will you lay aloft and
clue up the gundlestays? You won't? Mr. O'Finklestein!"
he called threateningly to the burly mate, "hold these
men at bay while I do it myself."

A prolonged snore answered him.
"All right for you, then. It's too much to ask of an old
man like me to scupper the galley every cool night.
It ain't right! I'll learn you! I'll mutiny!"
Thus broke out the mutiny on that charnel-ship, the
Gunnysack clipper of Ithaca, N. Y.

The cabin-boy was the first to die. Cabin boys always
do —that's what they're for. The embittered captain took
a boilerful of hot water to him. The cabin boy perished
in writhing agony—he had no soap. The others were
scalded to death afterward, one by one.
And I? I took to the boats, and drifted exposed for
days until you picked me up.
I felt that a good old-fashioned sea story should
always end that way.

"Bathing alone won't keep you clean,"
' According to Dr. Blue;
I guess I'll have to buy a tub
Made big enough for two.

Our idea of a man who is behind the times is the
stupe who shot two mail men because he thought they
were Confederate soldiers.

A piteous sight indeed is the dutiful boy scout plead

THE TURNING-POINT
The pursuing car drew nearer. I could see the faces
of the sheriff, the constable, the town marshal, and the
justice of the peace. The alarm had aroused them all,
and a speedy car was bringing them upon us rapidly.
"They will soon catch up to us at this rate, Bunny,"
cooly remarked Raffles at the wheel. "Is the loot safe?"
"All the silver is between my legs, and the jewelry in
my pocket," I answered. Will this road NEVER end?"
"We shall trip them up yet," said the cricketer
cracksman. "Reach into the bag and pick out a fork."
I did so. Raffles stopped the car, took the piece of
silver, and carefully placing it in the center of the road,
drove on.
The car of justice came to it and turned to the right.
We were saved! Our pursuers had turned at the fork
in the road.

ONE ACT PLAY
Scene: Campus barber shop.
Actors: Burly barber and suffering student.
Curtain Rises
A barber is seen flourishing his hands over the suf
fering student.
Barber (after vain attack on patient's scalp he ex
claims with judicial air): Your hair is full of dandruff
and your ears are full of soot. Let me give you a treat
ment with Zuzu's Lilac Talcum Powder.
Student (after hectic search for requisite funds):
A-a-ah. No thanks. I use Stacomb thrice a day.
Barber (warming up to his subject): Your scalp is
turning yellow and your hair is falling out. Gump's Hair
Resuscitator is the only cure for such cases. I use it
on my fur coat once a month.
Student (slightly disconcerted): Well, a-a-ah, you see
it's this way. (Receives brilliant idea.) Aa-ah-. I'm a
Christian Scientist. All I have to do is think my hair is
well and, presto, it is. You ought to try that on your coat.
Barber (is momentarily stunned by this surprise at
tack. Recovers finally): That's got nothing to do with
it. (With more professional air): If you neglect your
scalp, ipso facto, you neglect your hair. (Reminiscently):
Many's the bald-haired man I've seen saved by using
Zuzu's Lilac Talcum Powder and Gump's Hair Resusci
tator.
long silence
Barber (in commanding tone of voice): Well, do you
want it?
Student (feebly): No thank yuo, I think not, thank
you.
Barber (shaking patient's head more vigorously):
Humph.
another pregnant silence
Barber (gruffly): What do you want on your hair?
Student (gathering his shattered will power):
W-w-water, I guess.
Barber (making furious attack on patient's scalp, and
shaking his head violently): Gr-r-r-r.
Scholar arises limply, pays his check, and exits in a
deafening silence.
