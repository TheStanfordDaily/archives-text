# ARTIFICIAL AURORA STOPS MOON-GAZERS IN CACTUS GARDENS
## 
### 
Moon-struck visitors to the cactus gar
dens last night had an aurora borealis
all their own. Between 8 o'clock and
9:30 bright beams of light from some
powerful searchlights swept across the
heavens trying to outshine the moon.
Several guesses have been made as to
the origin of these sky brooms. Some
said it was the Peninsula Pageant of
Progress looking for new worlds to con
ouer, but the majority think it was Ed
die Lamb out searching for firebugs
