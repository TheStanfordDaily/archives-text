"Even the peddlers have musical calls
with which they announce their wares
in Italy, and music seems to he the
breath of life there," said Martin
d'Andrea, '25, in speaking on Italian
folk songs at the meeting of Music Club
held Tuesday evening. "The state does
much to encourage the writing of good
music, and offers prizes for the best
songs.
D'Andrea illustrated his talk by sing
ing some of the most popular Italian
folk songs, among them "O Sole Mio."
He was accompanied by Eugene
Poncclet, '22.
Magnus Gregersen, '23, singer, and
Halfdan Gregersen, '22, pianist, were
admitted to membership in the club.
