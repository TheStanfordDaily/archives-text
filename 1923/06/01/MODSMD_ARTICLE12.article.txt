# UNIVERSITY DAY WILL BELONG TO GRADUATES
## 
### Bill Wright, '25 
"Why, Geraldine, they told me you had taken on weight but I simply wouldn't
believe it. Yes, new Roble is nice but the mosquitoes must be so terrible right up there
by the—what is it?—Lagunita. And you're really married and living in Mountain
View! Tee-hee, tee-hee."
"Well, they had politics in my day, too. I remember when I was running for office
they tried to put over some sort of a dirty deal but my friends all got together and
now, see here, they said this man is the man for the job and he's going to get it, see?
Well, I didn't get it, but only a couple hundred voted."
"Don t you wish they'd had this when we were in college. These kids don't know
how lucky they are."
' Hey, Ed, come here. Buzz, buzz,, buzz. Ho, ho, ho! Pretty good, eh?"

The old Stanford Farm never sounds more like a mad-house
than on University Day—tomorrow. It's pretty hard to decide who
gets the biggest boot out of it, for the alumni mostly act like kids
and the undergraduates strive to be mistaken for alumni. The days
of the Plug-Ugly and the flat car escapade sound rosy now. and the
freshman of 1940 will listen pop-eyed to fantastically embellished
tales of the baseball fight. The alumni brain will ache with repeated
flops between "what we did" and "what they are doing." Then it
is to be profoundly hoped that a large number of reassured grads
will go home and write threatening letters to Upton Sinclair.
The lid will tilt and emit a few spurts of steam as early as this evening.
Custom has it that a graduating class shall hold its first reunion two years
after the sheepskin comes home to roost, and every live years thereafter.
The classes of '03, '13, and '21 will hold their reunion dinners tonight, along
with English Club and Cap and Gown affairs. The Masonic Club will discuss,
eat, and listen in the Women's Clubhouse during the evening. William A.
Sherman, Grand Master of the California Masons, will deliver the main address,
and Dr. A. C. Reed of the Stanford Medical School, James A. Marshall, Francis
V. Keesling, and C. G. Lambert will speak.
Along about the middle of Saturday morning the lid will fly off with a
roar and cling quivering to the ceiling, staring aghast at the seething mass
below. Hammer and Coffin will be doing a graceful Andrus act, meeting the
returning natives at the Southern Pacific station and trucking them precipi
tously to the campus. The Chappies will be equipped with a patch-work
battery of obsolete hotel busses, Deadwood stnge-coaehes, hay-racks, dump
carts, and possibly tricycles, and the trip to the Farm will be designed to
put the guests in the mood for anything. The Palo Alto police force will be
bribed if necessary.
It seems probable that more than half of the visitors will make an imme
diate rush for the Stadium and then drop a few reminiscent tears on the old
football field, soaked as it. is with Bruin gore. From here it will be an easy
880 to the military reservation, whither they will be led by sounds of applause.
The annual review of the future American Expeditionary Forces by President
Wilbur will go on the boards at 10 o'clock, followed an hour later by a polo
game between the IT. S. Army officers and the Cardinal polo team. The usual
thrills, spills, and subsequent pills are promised in this mallet-mix, and the
players have been practicing their English accents for months. They have
"Gaow hit, 'ammersley," down to a cold science.
It's a long journey from there to the big house on the hill, where Dr.
Wilbur will lunch the visiting alumni at 12:30. Due to the temperament of
the cook, seniors and resident alumni will have to look on through the knot
holes in a high board fence for the only time during the day. There is to be a
general reception for all of them at the same place at 2 o'clock, however, with
everybody talking at once. There will be no student entertainment here, as
Mrs. Wilbur has decided that there will be too much confusion for the trouba
dours to make themselves heard.
A general get-together in the court of the new Union will appear over
the horizon at 3:30, cast entirely in a Spanish mold to chime with our prized
Mission architecture. Dr. Morepo's string trio will make us familiar with
Spanish music, and between times we will hear the Stanford Band, with
which we are already familiar. Marsden Argyle, who will be remembered
from the open air opera season in the Stadium last spring, will trill a few
notes from comic opera and Cuthbert Tibbe will spring some Spanish melodieg.
If the committee can borrow some castanets we may see some Spanish dancing.
After an afternoon vesper service in Memorial Church the old grads will
be given a welcome hour of rest. Every living group will prop the front door
open and nurse a cramp in the old hand-shake arm. Concentrated rest will
put the flocks of tourists in shape for the big noise of the day, at 6:30.
The University Day banquet in the basketball pavilion is certainly elabor
ate and sounds enticing. Practically every campus skit of accepted merit will
charm laughter or sobs from our alumni, and students will be admitted to the
gallery to watch the carnage. The program in detail is given elsewhere, and is
long enough and good enough to last until 10 o'clock. Dancing until midnight,
arid then the lid regretfully goes back on.
About 700 alumni have mailed their acceptances, which is nearly on a
level with last year's turn-out.

The University Day banquet in the basketball pavilion is certainly elabor
ate and sounds enticing. Practically every campus skit of accepted merit will
charm laughter or sobs from our alumni, and students will be admitted to the
gallery to watch the carnage. The program in detail is given elsewhere, and is
long enough and good enough to last until 10 o'clock. Dancing until midnight,
arid then the lid regretfully goes back on.
About 700 alumni have mailed their acceptances, which is nearly on a
level with last year's turn-out.
"Why, Geraldine, they told me you had taken on weight but I simply wouldn't
believe it. Yes, new Roble is nice but the mosquitoes must be so terrible right up there
by the—what is it?—Lagunita. And you're really married and living in Mountain
View! Tee-hee, tee-hee."
"Well, they had politics in my day, too. I remember when I was running for office
they tried to put over some sort of a dirty deal but my friends all got together and
now, see here, they said this man is the man for the job and he's going to get it, see?
Well, I didn't get it, but only a couple hundred voted."
"Don t you wish they'd had this when we were in college. These kids don't know
how lucky they are."
' Hey, Ed, come here. Buzz, buzz,, buzz. Ho, ho, ho! Pretty good, eh?"

The old Stanford Farm never sounds more like a mad-house
than on University Day—tomorrow. It's pretty hard to decide who
gets the biggest boot out of it, for the alumni mostly act like kids
and the undergraduates strive to be mistaken for alumni. The days
of the Plug-Ugly and the flat car escapade sound rosy now. and the
freshman of 1940 will listen pop-eyed to fantastically embellished
tales of the baseball fight. The alumni brain will ache with repeated
flops between "what we did" and "what they are doing." Then it
is to be profoundly hoped that a large number of reassured grads
will go home and write threatening letters to Upton Sinclair.
The lid will tilt and emit a few spurts of steam as early as this evening.
Custom has it that a graduating class shall hold its first reunion two years
after the sheepskin comes home to roost, and every live years thereafter.
The classes of '03, '13, and '21 will hold their reunion dinners tonight, along
with English Club and Cap and Gown affairs. The Masonic Club will discuss,
eat, and listen in the Women's Clubhouse during the evening. William A.
Sherman, Grand Master of the California Masons, will deliver the main address,
and Dr. A. C. Reed of the Stanford Medical School, James A. Marshall, Francis
V. Keesling, and C. G. Lambert will speak.
Along about the middle of Saturday morning the lid will fly off with a
roar and cling quivering to the ceiling, staring aghast at the seething mass
below. Hammer and Coffin will be doing a graceful Andrus act, meeting the
returning natives at the Southern Pacific station and trucking them precipi
tously to the campus. The Chappies will be equipped with a patch-work
battery of obsolete hotel busses, Deadwood stnge-coaehes, hay-racks, dump
carts, and possibly tricycles, and the trip to the Farm will be designed to
put the guests in the mood for anything. The Palo Alto police force will be
bribed if necessary.
It seems probable that more than half of the visitors will make an imme
diate rush for the Stadium and then drop a few reminiscent tears on the old
football field, soaked as it. is with Bruin gore. From here it will be an easy
880 to the military reservation, whither they will be led by sounds of applause.
The annual review of the future American Expeditionary Forces by President
Wilbur will go on the boards at 10 o'clock, followed an hour later by a polo
game between the IT. S. Army officers and the Cardinal polo team. The usual
thrills, spills, and subsequent pills are promised in this mallet-mix, and the
players have been practicing their English accents for months. They have
"Gaow hit, 'ammersley," down to a cold science.
It's a long journey from there to the big house on the hill, where Dr.
Wilbur will lunch the visiting alumni at 12:30. Due to the temperament of
the cook, seniors and resident alumni will have to look on through the knot
holes in a high board fence for the only time during the day. There is to be a
general reception for all of them at the same place at 2 o'clock, however, with
everybody talking at once. There will be no student entertainment here, as
Mrs. Wilbur has decided that there will be too much confusion for the trouba
dours to make themselves heard.
A general get-together in the court of the new Union will appear over
the horizon at 3:30, cast entirely in a Spanish mold to chime with our prized
Mission architecture. Dr. Morepo's string trio will make us familiar with
Spanish music, and between times we will hear the Stanford Band, with
which we are already familiar. Marsden Argyle, who will be remembered
from the open air opera season in the Stadium last spring, will trill a few
notes from comic opera and Cuthbert Tibbe will spring some Spanish melodieg.
If the committee can borrow some castanets we may see some Spanish dancing.
After an afternoon vesper service in Memorial Church the old grads will
be given a welcome hour of rest. Every living group will prop the front door
open and nurse a cramp in the old hand-shake arm. Concentrated rest will
put the flocks of tourists in shape for the big noise of the day, at 6:30.

which we are already familiar. Marsden Argyle, who will be remembered
from the open air opera season in the Stadium last spring, will trill a few
notes from comic opera and Cuthbert Tibbe will spring some Spanish melodieg.
If the committee can borrow some castanets we may see some Spanish dancing.
After an afternoon vesper service in Memorial Church the old grads will
be given a welcome hour of rest. Every living group will prop the front door
open and nurse a cramp in the old hand-shake arm. Concentrated rest will
put the flocks of tourists in shape for the big noise of the day, at 6:30.
The University Day banquet in the basketball pavilion is certainly elabor
ate and sounds enticing. Practically every campus skit of accepted merit will
charm laughter or sobs from our alumni, and students will be admitted to the
gallery to watch the carnage. The program in detail is given elsewhere, and is
long enough and good enough to last until 10 o'clock. Dancing until midnight,
arid then the lid regretfully goes back on.
About 700 alumni have mailed their acceptances, which is nearly on a
level with last year's turn-out.
"Why, Geraldine, they told me you had taken on weight but I simply wouldn't
believe it. Yes, new Roble is nice but the mosquitoes must be so terrible right up there
by the—what is it?—Lagunita. And you're really married and living in Mountain
View! Tee-hee, tee-hee."
"Well, they had politics in my day, too. I remember when I was running for office
they tried to put over some sort of a dirty deal but my friends all got together and
now, see here, they said this man is the man for the job and he's going to get it, see?
Well, I didn't get it, but only a couple hundred voted."
"Don t you wish they'd had this when we were in college. These kids don't know
how lucky they are."
' Hey, Ed, come here. Buzz, buzz,, buzz. Ho, ho, ho! Pretty good, eh?"

The old Stanford Farm never sounds more like a mad-house
than on University Day—tomorrow. It's pretty hard to decide who
gets the biggest boot out of it, for the alumni mostly act like kids
and the undergraduates strive to be mistaken for alumni. The days
of the Plug-Ugly and the flat car escapade sound rosy now. and the
freshman of 1940 will listen pop-eyed to fantastically embellished
tales of the baseball fight. The alumni brain will ache with repeated
flops between "what we did" and "what they are doing." Then it
is to be profoundly hoped that a large number of reassured grads
will go home and write threatening letters to Upton Sinclair.
The lid will tilt and emit a few spurts of steam as early as this evening.
Custom has it that a graduating class shall hold its first reunion two years
after the sheepskin comes home to roost, and every live years thereafter.
The classes of '03, '13, and '21 will hold their reunion dinners tonight, along
with English Club and Cap and Gown affairs. The Masonic Club will discuss,
eat, and listen in the Women's Clubhouse during the evening. William A.
Sherman, Grand Master of the California Masons, will deliver the main address,
and Dr. A. C. Reed of the Stanford Medical School, James A. Marshall, Francis
V. Keesling, and C. G. Lambert will speak.
Along about the middle of Saturday morning the lid will fly off with a
roar and cling quivering to the ceiling, staring aghast at the seething mass
below. Hammer and Coffin will be doing a graceful Andrus act, meeting the
returning natives at the Southern Pacific station and trucking them precipi
tously to the campus. The Chappies will be equipped with a patch-work
battery of obsolete hotel busses, Deadwood stnge-coaehes, hay-racks, dump
carts, and possibly tricycles, and the trip to the Farm will be designed to
put the guests in the mood for anything. The Palo Alto police force will be
bribed if necessary.
It seems probable that more than half of the visitors will make an imme
diate rush for the Stadium and then drop a few reminiscent tears on the old
football field, soaked as it. is with Bruin gore. From here it will be an easy
880 to the military reservation, whither they will be led by sounds of applause.
The annual review of the future American Expeditionary Forces by President
Wilbur will go on the boards at 10 o'clock, followed an hour later by a polo
game between the IT. S. Army officers and the Cardinal polo team. The usual
thrills, spills, and subsequent pills are promised in this mallet-mix, and the
players have been practicing their English accents for months. They have
"Gaow hit, 'ammersley," down to a cold science.
It's a long journey from there to the big house on the hill, where Dr.
Wilbur will lunch the visiting alumni at 12:30. Due to the temperament of
the cook, seniors and resident alumni will have to look on through the knot
holes in a high board fence for the only time during the day. There is to be a
general reception for all of them at the same place at 2 o'clock, however, with
everybody talking at once. There will be no student entertainment here, as
Mrs. Wilbur has decided that there will be too much confusion for the trouba
dours to make themselves heard.
A general get-together in the court of the new Union will appear over
the horizon at 3:30, cast entirely in a Spanish mold to chime with our prized
Mission architecture. Dr. Morepo's string trio will make us familiar with
Spanish music, and between times we will hear the Stanford Band, with
which we are already familiar. Marsden Argyle, who will be remembered
