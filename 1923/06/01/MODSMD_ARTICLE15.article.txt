# THE
						RIGHT FOOT FORWARD

With the completion of Toyon and Branner halls,
their occupancy by upperclassmen at the beginning
of the fall quarter, and Encina's change to a fresh
man dormitory, Stanford will start the first lap
toward the goal of ideal university housing. On the
success or failure of this opening attempt depends
the course in which future expansion will steer.
The aim of the University is to relieve crowded
conditions, house every student comfortably, and,
above all, to place him in surroundings most con
genial.
Jt would be rather unfortunate if this opening
move were marred by grouping together two fac
tions of entirely opposite views on college life, with
the consequent friction bound to occur when these
conflicting groups are in cross-corridor contact.
