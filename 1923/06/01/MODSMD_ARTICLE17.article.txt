# A 						LEADER FOR YELLS
## 
### 
Today the student body gave the already over
strained election board another workout, and the
result determined who will lead Stanford rooting
sections for the next year. In the past three weeks
there have been more volcanoes in eruption, balloons
burst, and scandal unearthed in connection with se
lection of a yell leader than one would have believed
possible in an affair drawn on such a scale.
Today's election was the third in the yell leader
series, in which the Daily Palo Alto hopes that
the rooters at next year's games will finally have
succeeded in choosing a man whom they can trust
to give them sufficient energy to make the proper
noises when the varsity appears.
ft is of small avail to talk of personality and "pep"
in the selection of a yell leader when the leaders
have no intention of giving their choice any more
support than that required to mark up a piece of
paper with crosses. The Daily Palo Alto believes
that next year the student body will be able to re
main of one mind long enough to back unitedly the
man they have selected today.
Not to spoil any landscape gardening by beating
about the bush, it has been a faulty system of select
ing assistants which has l>een at the botom of the
rumpus. Quite obviously a method which includes
both tryoutee and elective features, with election
rather than merit choosing tryoutee is apt to get into
•a snarl.
The Rally Committee plan, put into effect too late
to do much more than start things this year, is a
seven-league stride in the right direction, but more
than one such step seems necessary to those inter
ested in Stanford rooting.
The Daily Palo Alto would like to recommend
a plan presented recently, which includes a public
tryout of sophomore candidates with selection of
six assistants to the head yell yeader by the Rally
Committee. These men will alternate throughout
the year, giving the rooting section a chance to
judge each.
Bv leaving the selection to the yell leader and
Rally Committee it is put in the hands of capable
people, and is made a true tryoutee system, instead
of a method in which politics, both straight and rail
road, figured to a too great extent.
Added to this plan is the suggestion that one man
lead the yelling instead of three; the addition is made
in the hope that some of the reverse arm-waving
and concentration on the rhythm of the next man
will give way to concentration on getting the entire
crowd back of the yell. Otie man will have charge
of the entire section ; in the case of the six assistants
this will soon let every otie, including the tryoutee, in
on how much of a head yell leader a man would
make if lie ever got the chance.
The chance would be given, as usual, on the ballot
in spring elections, with the weight of the Rally
Committee's recommendation backing the three men
who have come nearest to standard in "personality

and pep."
The above plan will be presented to the Execu
tive Committee for consideration at its next meet
ing;. The columns of the Daily Palo Alto are
open to all discussion of any pertinence.

of the entire section ; in the case of the six assistants
this will soon let every otie, including the tryoutee, in
on how much of a head yell leader a man would
make if lie ever got the chance.
The chance would be given, as usual, on the ballot
in spring elections, with the weight of the Rally
Committee's recommendation backing the three men
who have come nearest to standard in "personality

and pep."
The above plan will be presented to the Execu
tive Committee for consideration at its next meet
ing;. The columns of the Daily Palo Alto are
open to all discussion of any pertinence.
Today the student body gave the already over
strained election board another workout, and the
result determined who will lead Stanford rooting
sections for the next year. In the past three weeks
there have been more volcanoes in eruption, balloons
burst, and scandal unearthed in connection with se
lection of a yell leader than one would have believed
possible in an affair drawn on such a scale.
Today's election was the third in the yell leader
series, in which the Daily Palo Alto hopes that
the rooters at next year's games will finally have
succeeded in choosing a man whom they can trust
to give them sufficient energy to make the proper
noises when the varsity appears.
ft is of small avail to talk of personality and "pep"
in the selection of a yell leader when the leaders
have no intention of giving their choice any more
support than that required to mark up a piece of
paper with crosses. The Daily Palo Alto believes
that next year the student body will be able to re
main of one mind long enough to back unitedly the
man they have selected today.
Not to spoil any landscape gardening by beating
about the bush, it has been a faulty system of select
ing assistants which has l>een at the botom of the
rumpus. Quite obviously a method which includes
both tryoutee and elective features, with election
rather than merit choosing tryoutee is apt to get into
•a snarl.
The Rally Committee plan, put into effect too late
to do much more than start things this year, is a
seven-league stride in the right direction, but more
than one such step seems necessary to those inter
ested in Stanford rooting.
The Daily Palo Alto would like to recommend
a plan presented recently, which includes a public
tryout of sophomore candidates with selection of
six assistants to the head yell yeader by the Rally
Committee. These men will alternate throughout
the year, giving the rooting section a chance to
judge each.
Bv leaving the selection to the yell leader and
Rally Committee it is put in the hands of capable
people, and is made a true tryoutee system, instead
of a method in which politics, both straight and rail
road, figured to a too great extent.
Added to this plan is the suggestion that one man
lead the yelling instead of three; the addition is made
in the hope that some of the reverse arm-waving
and concentration on the rhythm of the next man
will give way to concentration on getting the entire
crowd back of the yell. Otie man will have charge
of the entire section ; in the case of the six assistants
this will soon let every otie, including the tryoutee, in
on how much of a head yell leader a man would
make if lie ever got the chance.
