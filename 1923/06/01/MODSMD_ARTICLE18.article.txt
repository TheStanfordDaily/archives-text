# CABBAGES and THINGS
## A 						DOMESTIC TRAGEDY 
### 
A curly headed lad played about the entrance to his
father's smithy. He frolicked and gamboled with a
youthful abandon, quite oblivious of the affairs of the
great world —intent only upon following his own fancies,
be they what they may.
Inside was the burly smith, and one would have
thought that with such a pleasant youngster playing in
the front with the curly ringlets flashing in the sun, the
great smith would have been happy, and yet. curiously
enough, he was in tears, and great sobs shook the
massive frame until the whole establishment shook in
sympathy. Let the gentle reader now impose an impedi
ment into the nasal cavity and step with the writer into
the recesses of the smith where John Smith was ham
mering away at the great anvil and cooling the reddened
iron with the moisture of his tears.
"How is it, smith," I say, "that you are bathed in tears
when it seems that you have everything to make you
happy? Perhaps it is that you weep with yratitude at
God's benificence and kindness?"
"Alas, it is not so," he replied In an anguished voice,
and I knew that something deep, soul-stirring, was
transpiring within that sturdy frame.
And then I questioned again, this time in a more in
sistent tone, "Is it that you are threatened with disaster
in business? Is it that the disciples of the great god
Gasoline have abandoned the erstwhile Do h bin so that
the calling of the blacksmith is no longer blessed with
rich and abundant returns?"
With a low moan and a negative shake of the head
he gave me to understand that I was still far away
from the mark. Then, becoming impatient as all philoso
phers do when an obstinate subject gives no opportunity
for philosophy, I said rather imperiously, "Then come,
man, tell me the meaning of these sobs, these tears with
which you are so afflicted that we are threatened with
imminent destruction."
He deliberately wiped his hands on the grimy leather
apron and gave the following heart-rending tale: "Ah,
sir, it is for yonder youth that I worry. It seems that his
future is very dark and I can see nothing for him but
poverty, privation, and misery. It was about three weeks
ago that I first noticed his peculiar love for books and
other useless things. He constantly reads with an ever
increasing appetite and has even suggested school. Ah,

sir, it is hard on me who is a
direct descendant of a long
line of smiths to thus dis
cover a disintegration in the
sturdy character of our fam
ily." Here the wretched man
paused, drew a deep breath,
and continued: "I have de
cided to indulge his whim and
send him to school. Oh. don't
speak, I know that it is a re
l .unciation, but what must be
must be, and so. But, sir, my
•eart aches and my soul is
sickened for I know full well

that the lad is passing bright. He will swiftly go
through the lower grades and then to college to become
—ah, how it sticks in ray throat, to become a Phi Beta
Kappa—and then, sir, the worst. My bright little lad
will leave the old smithy to fall into strange hands; will
forego enormous wealth for chill penury; will turn from
the smithy forever, and become a —professor!" And so
saying, the old man turned again to his anvil and con
tinued to weep and sob, and I rushed from the place a
sadder but much wiser man.—Berry Patch.
