# THE 						DEMI-VIRGIN
## 
### 
There are two kinds of modern plays
—those that have sensible plots and are
of real dramatic value; and those that
most people enjoy. "The Demi-Virgin"
is of the latter type. No intellectual
exertion is required throughout the en
tire three acts; an eye prepared at cer
tain scenes and an ear capable of catch
ing those naive and naughty types of
whispered humor are all that is neces
sary. When one realizes that the prin
cipal scene is a strip poker party par
ticipated in by four blushing and beau
teous charmers, the character of the play
should be evident to all.
"The Demi-Virgin" is a rollicking
narrative of the lives of certain movie
celebrities, obviously laid in Hollywood.
It should prove a delight to all those
who believe that the movie capital is the
"abode of Babylon" and the fountain
head of all crime, it is guaranteed to
shock all Puritanical persons with
greater rapidity than a patent electric
shocking machine. The only reason an
old-fashioned lady would not lifj her
hands in holy horror would be that she
had a hole in .her glove. Being of the
fluffy-duffy type of production, marital
troubles are the plot motif and we have
the eternal complication of the bride de
ciding to "just show hubby." The out
come provides for wifey to do several
risque things, including the strip poker
scene (amid much craning of necks) be
fore the final reconciliation. The at
mosphere of movie life throws a kind of
glamour over "The Demi-Virgin" and
the scene in the movie studio is guaran
teed to arouse much interest.
Nancy Fair ably portrays the part of
the young movie bride and she is well
supported by an excellent cast. We may
frankly state that the cast is worthy of
a much better play, although Avery
Hopwood has succeeded in writing a
play which will undoubtedly be popular.
We highly recommend "The Demi-
Virgin" to the proverbial "tired business
man" and all others who desire to rest
their brains while eye and ear are pleas
urably stimulated.
