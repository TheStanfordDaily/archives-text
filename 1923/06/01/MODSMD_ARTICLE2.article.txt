# Senior Class To Act As Reception Committee For Graduate Guests
## 
### 
Members of the senior class will act
as a reception committee for the alum
ni returning to the campus for the
annual University Day tomorrow. Upon
their arrival the alumni will be con
ducted to the various living groups
where they will stay while on the cam
pus. From then until the program is
concluded with the dinner and dance
in the Pavilion tomorrow night, the
seniors will play hosts and entertain
the guests with special events.
The visiting alumni will be enter
tained by a luncheon at President Wil
bur's home. At 2 o'clock all seniors
and Palo Alto and Stanford alumni
will go to the presidential mansion to
hear speeches by returning graduates.
Between 3 and 3:30 the seniors will
take complete charge of the entertain
ment and conduct their guests to the
court of the Union where they can
talk and enjoy themselves during the
band concert. The University band
will play a number of selections simi
lar in nature to the ones presented at
the weekly band concerts held in the
same place. Refreshments will be
served during the progress of the con
cert. During this time any of the
guests who desire to see various parts
of the campus in preference to hearing
the band concert will be conducted on
a sight-seeing tour by the senior hosts.
In addition to the selections by the
band, "Doc" Moreno and his string
trio will give a few selections. Mars
den Argyle will sing some comic opera
selections and Cuthbert Tibbe will
conclude the program with several
Spanish songs.
At the conclusion of the band con
cert, the seniors and the alumni will
go to the Memorial Church where a
special University Day Vesper Musical

After the conclusion of the vesper

the campus. The seniors will be on
hand at all times to do anything that
may add to the pleasure or comfort
of their guests and the period from
the end of the vesper service to the
time for the dinner in the Pavilion
will be devoted to such things as the
various guests desire.
