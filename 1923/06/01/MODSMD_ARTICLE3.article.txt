# RADIO HOAX FAILS TO SCARE ALUMNI
## Last Year's Program Brings Many Visitors Back Second Time 
### 
"Open House" at the second annual
University Day, May 19, last year,
brought down the house of the 700
alumni present when Professor j. E.
Coover conducted the psychological ex
periment which resulted in the appear
ance of two ghost-like figures, who ad
mitted they were Will Irwin, '25, and
Herl>crt Hoover, '25, participants in the
radio hoax.
The same alumni are expected hack,
however, for if they didn't enjoy the
joke, having heard it before, the special
exhibitions presented in each of the five
departments which they inspected on the
all University pilgrimage provided surer

thrills than that of hearing two famed
Stanford men's voices by means of a
fake magnavox.
The old-timers were given the key to
the "Farm" as it were, and in the morn
ing following the review of the Stanford
Field Artillery Battalion and the presen
tation of commissions to reserve officers
the program included an exhibition polo
game, and diving and swimming exhi
bitions in the Encina pool by the mem
bers of the varsity and freshman teams.
An official welcome was extended the
visitors by Dr. and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur, Dr. Jordan, and members of the
i Board of Trustees at a luncheon at the
President's home.
The "Procession of the Years" brought
out the class rivalry, especially when the
lone alumnus cheered the class of '92.
At 4 o'clock, the alumni were guided
about by seniors to the various depart
ments, where they were shown "how
it is being done now." Machines were
furnished to take the visitors on a half
hour tour of the campus. At 5 o'clock
an organ recital and Glee Club concert
was given in Memorial Church, and at
5:30 every living group on the campus
was thrown open to the visitors.
During the dinner, Charlie Field, T. C.
Gregory, Dr. Jordan, Professor H. J.
Ryan, and President Wilbur spoke. A
portrait of Dr. Jordan given to the Uni
versity was displayed and the crowd
paid homage to the first president of
Stanford. Charlie Field's promise was
fulfilled when the magnavox installed by
Professor H. J. Ryan transmitted Hoo
ver's message to the alumni seated about
the dinner tables and the seniors in the
balcony. Hoover's topic was "Troubles
of the Chief of the Ether Cops," while
Irwin described the famous "Stanford
Spirit."
Two numbers from the Women's
Pageant and "Up on a Ladder" from the
Junior Opera were presented under the
direction of Les Seib and Gordon Davis.
"South Sea Follies" or "Crazy With
Tahiti," written by Charlie Field and
Dan Evans, and produced by Sam Men
denhall, was staged by a cast of fifteen.
As a conclusion to the day, the under
graduates joined in a dance from 11
to 12.
