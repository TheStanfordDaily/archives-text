The Electrical Engineering Society en
tertained at dinner last night in the New
Union in honor of Professor H. J. Ryan,
I who was recently elected national presi
i dent of the American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers.
D. C. Bertrand, '23, the president of
: the society, introduced the toastmaster,
Hal Bumbaugh, '22, who is the presi
dent-elect of both E. E. and M. E. so
| cieties. Ryan then spoke on a number
j of phases of his recent trip East, where
i he attended the meeting in New York
|of all the officials of the institute. He
told of the device by which he was en
abled to hear perfectly at all the meet
ings, the use of new highly developed
| microphones. He made mention of new
I equipment by which artificial lightning
can be produced, and showed a specimen
of hard maple, two feet long, which had
been split by it. Ryan also discussed the
new Palais Photophones, by which speech
being broadcasted can be stopped by
simply placing some flat object in a beam
;of light. An interesting feature of this
apparatus is that the speech may be re-
I versed, making the sound come forth
reverse order, with the result that it
sounds almost like a foreign language.
Ryan has gained national prominence
in the electrical field by his widely
known experiments and researches. He
is the oldest professor of Electrical En
gineering now in a university. He has
been in the department here seventeen
I years.
