# STANFORD TO PLAY IN INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY MATCH
## Neer and Davies to Combine With Princeton Tennis Stars Against Oxford-Cambridge 
### 
Phil Neer and Jimmy Davies, repre
senting Stanford, will combine with
Princeton University tennis playe'rs to
form a six-man American team to play
against a joint Oxford-Cambridge team
in an international championship match
at Seabright, N. J., in the first week of
July.
The final plans for this international
cotest have just materialized, following
the invitation Princeton sent some time
ago to form an American teams with
Stanford. The match will work in with
the trip the Board of Athletic Control
authorized at their last meeting Tues
day night to send Neer Davies to
the national â€¢intercollegiate tennis
matches this summer -at Haverford,
Pennsylvania.
This will be the third trip the two
Stanford men, who are national intercol
legiate doubles champions, have played
together in the East.
Neer is president of the Intercollegiate
Lawn Tennis Association. Two years
ago when he played in the East for the
first time Neer won the intercollegiatc
singles championship. That same sum
mer he was elected president of the in
tercollegiate association.
Last year Neer, Davies, and Hinkley
(present captain) toured the East. The
men competed in the Haverford tourna
ment, where Neer and Davies annexed
the title, and also participated in
open matches and matches with numer
ous Eastern colleges.
Although Neer and Davies are ineli- j
gible for intercollegiate competition un
der the Pacific Coast conference this
year, they are still eligible to compete
in the big tournaments of the East.
The Princeton players who will com
pete will probably be John Howard, Ned
Herndon, and Clarence Ship way.
