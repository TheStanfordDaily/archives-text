# ONE-ACT PLAYS WILL BE GIVEN TOMORROW
## Dramatic Expression Classes To Begin Production Of Plays 
### 
A number of one-act plays, studies of
the theater work-shop class and the class
in drama, will be presented tomorrow,
Wednesday, and Thursday in the Little
Theater. The three plays of Richard
Bentinck's work-shop class will be given
tomorrow afternoon from 4 to 6; the
work of Miss Buckingham's class in the
drama will be offered on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings at 7. Anyone inter
ested is invited to attend the presenta
tions.
The plays are class studies in setting,
lighting, character development of mood,
i and the use of the voice. They are
worked out as experiments. No equip
ment has been purchased, and as little
stage space as possible will be used, in
keeping with the Little Theater idea.
In the following plays, to be presented
by Bentinck's class, the technical side of
the theatrical work will be emphasized:
"The Slave With Two Faces,"., by
Mary Carolyn Davies, directed by David
Mannoccir and Helen Whitney, setting

Miss Buckingham's classes, in casting
their plays, have attempted, for purposes
of study, to place members of the class
in parts which naturally come most diffi
cult to them. The plays the drama class
will offer are the following:
"The Boor," a Russian comedy by
Tchekhoff, directed by Scherl Levy, with
