# ENCINA BOOTBLACK TALKS OF POLITICS, CARS, QUEENING
## 
### 
Gus said "Now is the time for all
good men to come to the aid of the
party."
And Gns is usually right, since he
gathers all the choice bits of news float
ing around the campus from his contact
with the many "queeners" and "roughs"
who patronize his bootblacking estab
lishment in the basement of Encina hall.
Gus has been stationed at the foot of the
stairway many months and has seen
many faces come and go. His little
stand with two chairs, four foot-rests
and a dozen bottles, is a ready challenge
to the youth who goes unshined.
"Sometimes I will shine as many as a
100 pairs of shoes in a day and never lose
a customer. Rut it will be a different
story next year. Then only freshmen
will live in the hall and without any ma
chines, I will get little business."
"What makes you think that, Gus?"
his patron asked him. "There will lie
100 upperclassmen with the 450 fresh
men. And besides the freshmen will
have just as many good dances in the
hall as the upperclassmen have had this
year."
"Are you sure about that? Now, Ii
thought these new men wouldn't be run
nin' around so much. They couldn't get
out without a car and 1 figured 11
wouldn't stand much chance."
On campus politics, Gus is silent ex- j
cept he will stand back of the men who
have stood back of him. He knows some j
of the candidates and is for them all, |
hoping the best man will win.
Besides being a good man at clarify
ing ideas, Gus is also the general ad-'

viser of the Encina men. It may be a j
dull Friday evening when you sit in the i
chair getting a shine.
"Where is the dance tonight," asks |
Gus. "At the clubhouse? I thought
there weren't any big dances tonight, i
It's too bad they don't use the pavilion
more. I don't get much of the busi-:
ness unless the dances arc down on this
part of the campus. Encina and Pa- j
vilion dances arc when I get most of my
trade."
"Do you think these shoes will look
all right for a formal dance, Gus?" he!
queried.
"No, no, I'm afraid not," Gus replied, j
"No, they wouldn't get away at all, to
be perfectly frank with you. You'll
want to look your best and you won't
feel comfortable if you haven't the right j
kind of shoes to match that 'Tux.' The
women are keen to notice mistakes of |
that sort and you want to be proper.
You'll want some dancing pumps any
way sometime, and you might just a-;
well get them now and get some use
from them. No, I wouldn't take a
chance with these. It will pay you to
I get the pumps. And a good pair doesn't
I run so high, either."
The youth swallowed bait, hook, and I
1 sinker. He went to Paly and returned
j a little later with a package under his
! arm. Gus challenged him. "Well, you
j got them all right, did you?-You'll feel
| better now and that dance will be keen.
I I know."
As the young man walked up the stairs
j Gus gav a deep chuckle and bent to his
| task of blacking the next pair of shoe-.j
It was another victory for the house.
