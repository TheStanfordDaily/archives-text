# DR. WILBUR ANNOUNCES GIFTS TO UNIVERSITY AT LUNCHEON
## $25,000 Tuition Fund Presented By E.W. Hopkins; Speakers Tell Of University Growth; Activity 
### 
A gift of $25,000 as a permanent fund for tuition scholarships, made by
E. W. Hopkins, of San Francisco and Menlo Park, was announced by President
Wilbur at the annual University Day luncheon at the President's House
Saturday afternoon.
The income of the $25,000 is to be used annually to pay the tuition fees of
deserving students and will provide these fees for four or five students each
year. The terms of the gift provide that if at any future time tuition fees are
abolished at Stanford the fund shall be used for the benefit of needy students
in some other way.
President Reviews Year
Nearly 1000 Stanford alumni, faculty members, and seniors were present
at the luncheon to hear presented the outstanding developments in the growth
of the University during the year and the plans which the trustees hope to
follow out in the future. Dr. Wilbur announced several gifts made to the

â–º University recently and introduced the
| speakers at the luncheon, whom he
| declared were representative of the
j best leaders that Stanford has
Those who spoke at the conclusion
| of the luncheon included Comptroller
A. E. Roth, Dean Mary Yost, Dr. E. G.
j Martin, professor of physiology, Dr.
I C. D. Marx, professor of civil engi
' neering, Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, associate
professor of history, Dr. Eliot Black
j welder, professor of geology, and Dr.
| E. E. Robinson, professor of history.
Roth Lists Improvements
Comptroller Roth spoke of the com
pletion of the new Stanford Union,
; providing rooming, eating, and club
room facilities long needed by the
University; of the new Encina dining
halls nearly completed, and the new
dormitories, Toyon and Branner halls,
now under construction, which will be
ready for occupancy with the opening
of the next college year in October;
; and the plans for further beautifica
, tion of the campus. This latter project
is being accomplished, Roth said,
through the co-operation of Professor
Leroy Abrams of the botany depart
! ment with the aid and advice of John
McLaren, superintendent of Golden
j Gate Park, and Gardiner Daley, archi
tect.
Dean Yost paid a striking tribute to
the manner in which Stanford women
students are making a practical and
I successful use of the principle of self
government. "Self-government among
the women." she said, "not only offers
opportunities of training for leadership
and for responsibilities of citizenship,
but is a very valuable help to the ad
ministration in promoting the smooth
running of the University.
School of Biology
Dr. Martin outlined the work lead
ing up to the organization of the
School of Biology, the first school of
the sort in any university, which will
include the present departments of
anatomy, bacteriology, experimental
pathology, bio-chemisty, botany, ento
mology, food research, Hopkins Marine
Station, paleontology, physiology, and
zoology.
"The school of biology,'" he said,
"co-ordinating the work of all the bio
logical departments under one faculty
and a single head, is the outgrowth of
the conviction that there are advan
tages in offering students an oppor
tunity to master the fundamentals of
all biological sciences rather than to
specialize too early in a single branch."
Hoover Library Unique
"Stanford, through the initiative of
Herbert Hoover, '95," said Professor
Lutz, "and with the assistance of Pro
fessor E. D. Adams, has built here one
of the most extensive libraries for a
study of the World War and the recon
struction of Europe in existence."
Professor Marx stated that at the
present time Stanford University is as
well equipped for the carrying on of
its undergraduate work in engineering
as any institution in the country. He
also outlined steps which are being
taken to furnish an endowment so that
the department of engineering may
further develop its work in specialized
fields.
The threefold purpose of the depart
ment of geology was told by Dr.
Blackwelder. The first of these, he
said, is the training of the general stu
dent; the second, that of preparing a
smaller number of men for technical
service in the industries; and, third,
that of affording opportunities for the
exceptional students to become schol
arly scientists.
New Citizenship Course
The new citizenship course which
will be given to the entire freshman
class next year by members of the
Stanford faculty, including President
Wilbur, was outlined by Dr. Robinson,
who pointed to the fact that this
course would be a material factor in
laying the- foundation ofr a broad edu-
Dr. Vernon Kellogg Here
Among the notable Stanford alumni
on the campus for the University Day
celebration was Dr. Vernon Kellogg,
for many years professor of ento
mology here, one of Herbert Hoover's
chief aides in Belgian relief and food
administration during the war, and
now permanent secretary of the Na
tional Research Council and chairman
of the Division of Educational Rela
tions of the Council, with offices in
Washington and New York. Dr. Kel
logfi has just come to the Pacific Coast
to spend the summer at his California
home in Carmel.
