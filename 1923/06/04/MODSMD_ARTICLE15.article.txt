# DEVELOPMENT OF RELIGION DISCUSSED BY DR. A.P. FITCH
## 
### 
Modern civilization is gradually ap
proaching the highest point in reli
gious experience, and this maximum
eventually wlil be reached by the
Christian movement.
Dr. Albert Parker Fitch, professor
of comparative religions at Amherst
College, made this remark in a dis
cussion of the religious attitude of
today. "In a new civilization, God is
interpreted in physical terms," said
Dr. Fitch. "Later, there is an attempt
at metaphysical explanation; and final
ly the highest stage is reached, name
ly, a moral conception of God.
"At the present time there is a trend
to an ever closer alliance between
character and faith, because the world
is coming to see that the most ade
quate understanding of the nature of
God is in terms of a good life. Religious
insight comes through character."
"There is something in honor, purity,
justice, and love, that is not tem
poral," said Dr. Fitch. "Insofar as hu
man beings attain to these qualities,
do they reach an understanding of
God."
