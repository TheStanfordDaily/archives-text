# THE 						LATEST IN HEADGEAR
## 
### 
In conjunction with an upperclass committee, the
freshman class has selected the hat which will deco
rate its brow for next year, choosing the usual felt
affair, this time in sandstone brown, with a patriotic
red ribbon around its middle. Ihe hat was chosen
with the idea that it would be a permanent headpiece,
just as sombreros and dinks distinguish other
classes.
After watching in succession the demise of the old
catsup stopper, the modest and modish '23 cap, and
the reaction to it by the '24 class, the Daily Palo
Alto feels ready to back up the recommendation
which the senior control committee will make to the
Executive Committee tomorrow night. This recom
mendation is, in effect, that a by-law be inserted into
the constitution making the adoption of the present
soph lid compulsory for all future classes.
This is perhaps hard on the spirit of originality
which takes hold of the freshmen about the close of
their period of bondage, but in the light of previous
apparitions which have shone forth on the Quad, one
might consider it esthetically justifiable.
