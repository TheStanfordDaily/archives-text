As the Daily Palo Alto went to press last Fri
day, the result of a special election came in. They
showed that a majority of those interested in Stan

will have its choice of giving - the man elected its
whole-hearted support, or taking the attitude which
has heen regrettably noticeable in the past yearâ€”of
sitting well back and growling.
When "Pop" Warner left alter giving Stanford's
football hopes a six weeks' workout he dropped some
hints about next year's chances. If they are true, the
rooting sections will not even have the ]x>or excuse
of a losing team to affect its vocal chords. \
