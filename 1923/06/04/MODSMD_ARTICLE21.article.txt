# NOW THE CONGRATULATIONS

### 
The student hosts at the second University Day
inay now pat themselves on their individual hacks—
if the success of the reunion is judged by the good
time had by the alumni. Without the enthusiastic
co-operation of the undergraduates such a welcom
ing of Stanford men and women would have been
impossible. The alumni were made to feel that they
are still an integral part of the University and were
enabled to understand its working. Strange tales of
the present undergraduates seep out to distress the
alumni who regret the passing of the good old days
—a visit to the harm as guests of the student body
is the most efficient method of removing these false
impressions.
University Day, by giving the seniors a chance to
get a comprehensive review of the accomplishments
and plans of the administration, serves a double pur
jxise: it enables the graduating class to become bet
ter alumni. One cannot realize the scope of the
work going on around him by hearing about it in
fragments; it is just such a panoramic review of the
University's growth which is given the seniors at the
talks by faculty members at President Wilbur's
luncheon.
