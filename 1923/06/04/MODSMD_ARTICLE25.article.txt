The art of correct reading is something which any
student should be more than glad to acquire. A majority
of college students do not make the most of their reading
opportunities; they spend many hours thumbing the
pages of the latest short story magazines, special prefer
ence always being given to the magazine that runs the
worst trash in its columns. On the other hand, there is
the college grind, a somewhat rare specimen these days,
who devotes his spare reading time to a perusal of the
weightiest articles on file in the library with never a
thought of adding a trace of variety to his education by
reading a throbbing novel of the Canadian northwest.
Even with the arduous scholars who read the long dry
passages of the standard works, there must at times be
a craving for a short snappy story. No special harm can
come from reading a red hot story right off the press
provided it is not taken seriously; people need a little
something to add zest to the monotony of their existence.
Still, the person who spends practically all his time
reading detective stories, the scandal sheets of the news
papers, and books that have been suppressed, is doing
himself a great deal of harm. There is a danger that
the reader will take such material too seriously. It is
necessary to examine light fiction with a critical eye.
The ideal reader concentrates 011 the best works in the
field of literature, but he keeps before him the ever
present aim of improving his education by reading upon
a variety of subjects.
There is an ever increasing tendency on the part of
students to ignore the best literary works for absolute
trash. The fault lies in the home training and secondary
school education which the student receives before com
ing to college. The desirability of appreciating fine
writing is under emphasized by him. The student of
today must realize that while lighter fiction may be
read occasionally, it should not comprise the |asis for
an education. —Michigan Daily.
