# Use of Force Will Not Solve Irish Problem, Says Cross
## 
### 
Tom Peete Cross, well-known authority
on Celtic literature and member of the
University of Chicago faculty, who is
giving graduate courses in the University
this year, believes that the solution of
Irish troubles could be found in disin
terested assistance by England.
In discussing the complex racial her
itage of the Irish, Professor Cross
placed the cause of dissension much far
ther back in history than Ireland's quar
rels with England. "Jealousies between
Ulster and other Irish tribes evidently
existed before the time of written his
tory," he explained. "One of the oldest
Irish sages tells of the ravages of Ulster
men throughout the country. This anti-
Christian epic, 'The Cattleraid of Cooley'
reflects a civilization as old as the be
ginning of the Christian era, and seems to
indicate that Ulster was always a dif
ferent race from others in the island."
It is improbable that Ireland can be
come nationally unified without long
years of misery unless Great Britain is
magnanimous enough to pour oil on the
troubled waters. This is Cross' estimate

of the political outlook;
He is the author o£ a number of arti- 1
cles on Celtic literature, being publishing
editor of the journal, "Modern Phil-,
ology," and member of the American
Council of the Irish Texts Society and
of several other literary research asso
ciations. He was a student at the School
of Irish Learning, Dublin, in 1909, and
received A.M. and Ph.D. degrees at Har
vard. „
In a short time, Professor Cross' latest j
book will be published, giving a compre-1
hensive account of the relations of Celtic
to mediaeval romance.
"Many old Celtic legends are retold in
the Arthurian tales; in fact Celtic, Greek,
and Latin sources furnish the majority of
literary inspiration for the English race,"
Cross declared. "There are now in the
Stanford library translations of several
valuable early manuscripts before 1106."
Professor Cross is a student of Gaelic:
and has done special research work in
Ireland in translating old manuscripts.
He gives graduate courses in the Univer
sity of Chicago, and is teaching in Stan
ford only for the year.
