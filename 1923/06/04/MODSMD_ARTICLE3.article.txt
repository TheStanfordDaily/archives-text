### 
Seats go on sale tomorrow at 1 p. m.
in the Administration building for
"The Hottentot," the 1923 farce, to be
presented June 13, the final day of
University examinations. The farce,;
which is starring Helen Whitney and
Lloyd Nolan, and is being directed by
A. D. Cohan, is now in the finishing
period of rehearsing.
Dress rehearsals for the piece will
be held Thursday and Friday evenings.
The cast will take the following eve
nings for study, but will get in one
further review of the show before the
final offering.
In spite of the very short period the |
cast members have been able to work !
on "The Hottentot," they have ab
sorbed all the lines, cues, and en-;
trances, and are now working almost
wholly on character delineation, vocal
expression, and smoothness in acting.
