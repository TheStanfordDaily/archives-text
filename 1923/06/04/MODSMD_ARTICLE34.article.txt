# Davis Describes Oriental Drama of Mystic Tagore
## 
### 
A viviil description of an Indian j
drama, by Tagore, mystic-poet, actor,
and dramatist, is given in a letter
j written from Calcutta by Gordon
Davis, Stanford dramatic coach, who
iis returning with Lester Seib, '22,
from a tour of the Orient in the T. j
Daniel Frawley Company.
A passing glimpse of the Eastern
drama can be secured from Davis'
letter, a part of which follows:
"How I wish you could have been
I with me yesterday when I saw Tagore
at the Calcutta University Institute
take the leading part in one of his
| own plays, 'Vasanta'.
"I have never been so deeply moved
by anything on the whole trip. . . . j
The play was mainly a discussion be
tween Tagore and the rich men, while
; the people broke into choruses which
| seemed to illuminate what Tagore,
their prophet, was saying. The highest
point for me was a time when the
lights grew dim and the chorus broke
into a triumphant paean. It was a
scene of the most sensuous and yet
refreshing beauty."
"Their clear fresh young voices, the
swaying of their bodies, the rhythmic
waving of drapes and scarfs, the flash
ing of dark eyes, the gleam of gold
and silver together with the regular
sound of a silver bell keeping time
with the dull thud of their bare heels
upon the floor â€”and in the center the
tall golden figure of Tagore pointing
upwards like some spiritual symbol.
Nothing in any other theater of the
Orient had so affected me."
