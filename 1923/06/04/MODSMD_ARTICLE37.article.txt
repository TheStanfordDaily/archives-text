## 
### 
Did that last letter home ever get
there? Is the "girl you left behind"
angry with you for not writing? Per
haps there is an explanation if you
happen to use the big mail box in
Encina Hall.
A trustful upperclassman who still
believes in signs brought a fistful of
letters down to the first floor from his
room, and dropped them unconcerned
ly into the mail slot. The inquiring
reporter noticed as much and finding
the padlock on the box broken he
lifted the lid and looked within. There
lay sprawled around the bottom of the
box some three or four score letters.
An examination of them showed they
had been there for days, perhaps
weeks. Some were addressed to moth
ers, others to "the girl." some to com
panies.
At the bottom of the irregular pile
of missives was a large dusty sign
with irony written all over its face,
saying: "U. S. Mail Collected at 1
p. m. Daily." It had been set up on
top of the box early in the year but
for a long time had lain amidst the
unnoticed letters at the bottom of the
box.
