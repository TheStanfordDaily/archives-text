Mrs. Chadwick Reviews
"By the way, dear, I went to see
a rehearsal of 'The Hottentot' last
night. It is one of those vulgitr modern
things. Some people may think it is
very clever and all that, but it is not
the kind of play I want a daughter of
mine to see. I may be a little New
England-puritan, but really, I don't
fee why college children should want
to put on a play like that.
"The play is about really nice peo
ple—but people who are in such a mad
scramble after pleasure. There is a
chap named Harrington. He dances
of course; but he's crazy about horses,
and just mad about, steeplechasing.
He comes to this rather wealthy house
to visit. I forgot to say—'lsn't it poi
sonous the way I forget things!' There
is another Sam Harrington out West
who is a great rider, and she, the girl
—or. her gowns are simply gorgeous.
Well, she confuses this other Sam
Harrington with the man that comes
to see her. It seems to be a case of
Jove at first sight. Oh, I forgot to say—'
'isn't it poisonous the way I forget
things!'—that they met out West; then
you know, her aunt was taken sick and
she had to return to the East.
"Well, that part was all right, but I

I whenfhe young man comes to the
; house —oh dear, I forgot to say, he
had an accident and fell off a horse, j
He comes into the house and there is
a tear—well, pardon me for saying it—
in his trousers. And she comes down
and proceeds—right on the stage, my
dear! —to mend them. Well, and then
the jokes! Now I've always tried to
be as broad-minded as anyone should I
be —but really you know there are
some things—l declare I was so em
barrassed, I would have walked right
out of the Assembly Hall, if I hadn't
wanted to see how it came out. As I
said to Walter, I can't understand why
nice girls would act in a play like that.
"Well, they might have stopped at
that —but they had to bring liquor and
other things in.The hero himself drank
—perfectly disgusting. I can't bear
that sort of thing. I certainly hope
our Elizabeth will not be asked to act,
I in a play like that.
"I do hope that 'Little Lord Faunt
leroy' will come to Hanford this sum
mer during the vacation."

"I strolled in to see a rehearsal of
"The Hottentot" —got so tired of read
ing that old stuff, and watching those
foolish men who walk in and out of
the library looking for some girl. It
was simply darling. Really—could you
imagine it—funny.
"You must see it. It's the kind of
thing you can't explain without spoil
ing, but I know you'd adore it. The
man is the kind you can really admire
—not the showy kind —but he has
character —the kind a person would
think a lot of. you know. And he IS
funny. When he came in after the ac
cident 011 the 'Hottentot' —well, I
thought I would die laughing! It's kind
of hard to say why it's so funny, but
really—well I know you will think it's
an awfully good play."
