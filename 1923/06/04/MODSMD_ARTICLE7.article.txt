### Allan Charles, ’25 
Will you kindly express through
the columns of the Daily Palo
Alto the very keen appreciation
by the general body of alumni of
the fine cooperation given by the
undergraduates in connection
with the alumni University Day
last Saturday. The students' un
stinted generosity of time and ef
fort was very noteworthy and the
General Committee, of which I
have the honor to be chairman,
appreciate very deeply their cour
tesy. The general arrangement
worked out by undergraduate
committees was perfect and the
warm applause given to tlfe en
tertainment fairly indicated this
excellence.
We thank you very much.
Very truly yours,
W. H. B. Fowler, '06,
Chairman of the Day.

University Day closed Saturday
night with the annual dinner in the
Pavilion, where 5)00 alumni, faculty
members and students heard addresses
by Dr. Jordan and President Wilbur,
and were entertained by a program
which included choice slices of former
student dramatic productions. If red
balloons. Stanford songs, a continuous
mumbling of conversation, and a gen
erous applause of the well-worked-out
program of the student body have
meaning, alumni went home convinced
that the youth of Stanford appreciates
them enough to go to no little pains
for their reception.
A dramatic skit, written by Dan
Evans, '20, consisting of the trial by
"Student Opinion" of a number of
alumni on various amusing charges,
concluded the formal program. Per
sonal touches with the alumni, student
difficulties, and selections of music
and dramatic talent were skilfully
blended in this light take-off, which
commenced with the indictment of the
yell leader and concluded with "Hail
Stanford Hail." Arnold Bavley's favor
ite imitations were immediately under
stood, by alumni, who if they don't
drop in occasionally to a Memorial
Church service or a sociology lecture,
were able, nevertheless, to see the
point.
Dr. Wilbur Tells of "Problem"
Dr. Wilbur gave a short address
during the student program. "Our prob
lem," he said, "is to see how many
out of the 500' to 600 men that come in
each year we can graduate. "We don't
have to worry about the 500 women,"
he quickly added, in way of explana
tion, "they know how to take care of
themselves —and a good many others,
too. A large section of the 40 per
cent of this number that we lose go
out because they are taken from work
by such things as freshman duties and
rushing," Dr. Wilbur stated.
He then spoke briefly of the action
that student organizations had taken
this year to remove these objection
able time-wasters. In speaking of the
housing of freshmen in Encina Hall
next year, the president said: "With
our facilities here we are trying to get
a Stanford solution to one of tho most
difficult situations the universities
have to handle.
"There is going to be a steady
growth in the student body," Wilbur
prophesized, "and you alumni will find
that your sons will get more out of the
University than you did; but they will
have to give more, not in money, but
in service."
Dr. Jordan Talks Informally
A short informal talk was given by
Dr. Jordan, in appreciation of repeated
calls for the chancellor emeritus from
the alumni body. Dr. Jordan was
moved by the sincere attentions of
the audience, and said that should he
have a chance to live another life he
would like to be a college president,
because the college head meets with
many representative people of the
country on their best sides, in a way
that he sees much of the most at
tractive sides of human nature.
Glee Club on Program
The selections offered by the Glee
Club were especially well received.
Led by Director Allen they sang "Calf
of Gold," "Bill's Bill Board," "Finnish
Lullaby," "Invictus," "Rolling to Rio,"
the drinking song from "Knightie
Knight," and several Stanford songs.
Two selections by Marsden Argall
accompanied on the piano by Richard
Malaby, were heartily applauded.
The effective three-level stage, with
gray drapes, five moons and a palm
tree with red and green shadows pre
sented an attractive background for
the silhouettes of the carnival masque
entertainers.
Opera Stars Entertain
Gene Tiago and Miss Margaret Mc-
Govern gave alumni a taste of the 1924
Junior Opera. The opera was also
represented by Dorothy Daliler and
Bill Lucas who re-staged "Seven and
Eleven" and added "That Red
Man." Ted Van Deusen and Gardiner
Lippincott not only improved upon "I
Ain't Nobody Much," as presented in
"Fore," but offered a newly-concocted
dance that was excellent.
Arnold Bayley was encored until he
had exhausted all the ten or fifteen
verses of "I Love Me."
The evening was concluded with
dancing.
Festivities of University Day were
opened with the president's review of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. unit at 10
o'clock in the morning, followed by a
polo game between Stanford military
teams.
After the luncheon at the President's
house the ( -seniors received alumni
guests in the New Union court. The
Stanford band played for an hour, sev
eral vocal selections were given, and
refreshments served.
