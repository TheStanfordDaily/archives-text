Will you kindly express through
the columns of the Daily Palo
Alto the very keen appreciation
by the general body of alumni of
the fine cooperation given by the
undergraduates in connection
with the alumni University Day
last Saturday. The students' un
stinted generosity of time and ef
fort was very noteworthy and the
General Committee, of which I
have the honor to be chairman,
appreciate very deeply their cour
tesy. The general arrangement
worked out by undergraduate
committees was perfect and the
warm applause given to tlfe en
tertainment fairly indicated this
excellence.
We thank you very much.
Very truly yours,
W. H. B. Fowler, '06,
Chairman of the Day.

University Day closed Saturday
night with the annual dinner in the
Pavilion, where 5)00 alumni, faculty
members and students heard addresses
by Dr. Jordan and President Wilbur,
and were entertained by a program
which included choice slices of former
student dramatic productions. If red
balloons. Stanford songs, a continuous
mumbling of conversation, and a gen
erous applause of the well-worked-out
program of the student body have
meaning, alumni went home convinced
that the youth of Stanford appreciates
them enough to go to no little pains
for their reception.
A dramatic skit, written by Dan
Evans, '20, consisting of the trial by
"Student Opinion" of a number of
alumni on various amusing charges,
concluded the formal program. Per
sonal touches with the alumni, student
difficulties, and selections of music
and dramatic talent were skilfully
blended in this light take-off, which
commenced with the indictment of the
yell leader and concluded with "Hail
Stanford Hail." Arnold Bavley's favor
ite imitations were immediately under
stood, by alumni, who if they don't
drop in occasionally to a Memorial
Church service or a sociology lecture,
were able, nevertheless, to see the
point.
Dr. Wilbur Tells of "Problem"
Dr. Wilbur gave a short address
during the student program. "Our prob
lem," he said, "is to see how many
out of the 500' to 600 men that come in
each year we can graduate. "We don't
have to worry about the 500 women,"
he quickly added, in way of explana
tion, "they know how to take care of
themselves —and a good many others,
too. A large section of the 40 per
cent of this number that we lose go
out because they are taken from work
by such things as freshman duties and
rushing," Dr. Wilbur stated.
He then spoke briefly of the action
that student organizations had taken
this year to remove these objection
able time-wasters. In speaking of the
housing of freshmen in Encina Hall
next year, the president said: "With
our facilities here we are trying to get
