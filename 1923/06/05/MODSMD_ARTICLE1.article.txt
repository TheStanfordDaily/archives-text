# UNION DINING ROOM MAKES NET PROFIT DURING YEAR
## Total Surplus of $1932.95 Is Announced by Union Board of Directors Deficit Incurred Beginning of College Year Has Not Been Reduced 
### 
The Stanford Union made a net
profit of $1932.95 from the manage
ment of the main dining room daring
the seven months period from October
1, 1922, to May 1, 1923, according to a
financial statement issued by the
Union Board of Directors.
The report follows:
Year Begins With Deficit
"The Union began the college year
with a heavy deficit incurred in oper
ating the main dining room during the
summer of 1922 and in making altera-;
tions and adjustments during Septem
ber. Since tbe volume of business in;
the main dining room has never been j
sufficient to enable it to show a profit j
on operations and maintain the stand-1
ard of service this deficit has never'
been reduced. Constant reductions in!
operating costs have resulted, how-1
ever, in a steady improvement month
by month in the amount of loss, so |
that at the present time this dining
room is almost self-supporting.
"The losses which have been in- 1
curred in the dining rooms are due
largely to week-ends and vacation
periods such as Christmas and Easter
holidays, during which the income is j
greatly reduced but overhead expenses ;
for help and the like continue undi- \
minished.
Overhead Expenses High
"Overhead expenses are necessarily |
high in any organization such as the I
Union which is subject to a fluctuating
patronage, but which must, neverthe
less, always be prepared to carry the
peak of the load. Such expenses as
have been incident to the organiza
tion of a new plant have naturally been j
high during the period covered by this ■
statement, but have been steadily re
duced until the Union is now on a !
thoroughly sound operating basis. The j
amount of loss in the dining rooms is
now slight during any normally busy
month.
"The Board of Directors is consider-'
ing a plan for co-ordinating the dining \
room facilities and taking over certain j
new income producing activities next \
fall in order to avert any further
losses. This has not been possible!
during this year as the Union has been i
obliged to carry a large share of the j
burden of providing eating facilities
for the students. As soon as the dining '
rooms are entirely self supporting, in- j
come received from rentals, dues, or other sources will be applied to reducing the
debt incurred in equipping and furnishing the Union."

" Loss
The Stanford Union made a net
profit of $1932.95 from the manage
ment of the main dining room daring
the seven months period from October
1, 1922, to May 1, 1923, according to a
financial statement issued by the
Union Board of Directors.
The report follows:
Year Begins With Deficit
"The Union began the college year
with a heavy deficit incurred in oper
ating the main dining room during the
summer of 1922 and in making altera-;
tions and adjustments during Septem
ber. Since tbe volume of business in;
the main dining room has never been j
sufficient to enable it to show a profit j
on operations and maintain the stand-1
ard of service this deficit has never'
been reduced. Constant reductions in!
operating costs have resulted, how-1
ever, in a steady improvement month
by month in the amount of loss, so |
that at the present time this dining
room is almost self-supporting.
"The losses which have been in- 1
curred in the dining rooms are due
largely to week-ends and vacation
periods such as Christmas and Easter
holidays, during which the income is j
greatly reduced but overhead expenses ;
for help and the like continue undi- \
minished.
Overhead Expenses High
"Overhead expenses are necessarily |
high in any organization such as the I
Union which is subject to a fluctuating
patronage, but which must, neverthe
less, always be prepared to carry the
peak of the load. Such expenses as
have been incident to the organiza
tion of a new plant have naturally been j
high during the period covered by this ■
statement, but have been steadily re
duced until the Union is now on a !
thoroughly sound operating basis. The j
amount of loss in the dining rooms is
now slight during any normally busy
month.
"The Board of Directors is consider-'
ing a plan for co-ordinating the dining \
room facilities and taking over certain j
new income producing activities next \
fall in order to avert any further
losses. This has not been possible!
during this year as the Union has been i
