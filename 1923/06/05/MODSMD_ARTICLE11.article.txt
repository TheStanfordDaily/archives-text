# "HOTTENTOT" LAST TO FINISH IN 1923 THEA TRICAL DERBY
## FINAL DRESS REHEARSALS OF SENIOR FARCE CAST WILL BE RUN OFF THURSDAY, FRIDAY NIGHT 
### Allan Charles, '25 
With three more days of rehearsing before it,"The Hottentot," 1923 Senior
t Farce, the final dramatic offering of trt»e season, and the last big event before
l graduation, to be presented on June 13, has rounded out into what is called a
' presentable, amusing, amateur comedy.
Dress rehearsals will be held Thursday and Friday evenings. Costumes
will arrive tomorrow, and the settings will be completed by Friday.
The play, which includes a continuous run of humor, both in the lines and
in the situations, is indisputably a farce of the first class, as its success in
New York and in the West has indicated.

Did you ever watch a rehearsal? ,
Follow quietly, slip into a seat in
the dark hall, and you will see the
stage dressed in its latest colors, the
people oi' the theater discussing the
show eagerly near the front of the
stage, with light raillery echoing back
into the empty hall.
You see that, man balancing on the
top of the piano?
Stop! Look! Listen!
"Please pay attention there! I'm not
explaining this to the wall!"
"Yes, that's the man I mean —the
one that is now stalking back and
forth on the stage with his hands be
hind his back after the fashion of
'Felix.'
"You're not bawling for something;

*
you re calling the lady; show it in your
voice, now. All right. Quiet! back
stage, please!"
"Yes, that's 'A. D.' He directs the
show, you see."
"When I heard they'd put you on
the 'Hottentot,' my heart just stood
still."

'Hottentot' is the name of the
play. No, it's a horse named after a
, tribe of small South African blacks."
■ "That good-looking girl in the blue
j sweater and hat? Her name is Helen
j Whitney. She plays the lead in the
play. Yes, she certainly has the charm;
and it means so much to find a femi
nine lead with an attractive personality
in a straight comedy role. Peggy Fair- j
fax, like the women's lead in most
farces, comes nearest to being a nor
mal human-being; I mean, she has less
eccentric ways, fewer ludicrous acci
dents to go through, she is the magnet

which holds the character roles to
| gether, a sort of neutralizing agent.
| too."
