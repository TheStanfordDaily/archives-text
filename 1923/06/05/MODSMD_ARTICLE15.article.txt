## 
### 
One hundred children are practicing j
daily for the fourth annual Menlo i
Park circus and horse show to be j
given June 23 for the benefit of the i
Stanford Home for Convalescent Chil
dren. The circus and horse show will
be held on the grounds of the new j
Menlo Park Circus Club, the outgrowth '
of the children's benefit entertain-!
ments. A seventeen-acre tract, equip
ped with a tan-bark ring, polo field, i
grandstand, and a clubhouse, was pre
sented to the children of Menlo Park
who sponsor the horse show.
Interest at present centers around
the "Polly of the Circus" contest. Ten
small girls are in the race and the
competition will be keen until the last
minute; the contest closes June 16.
one week before the circus.
No Wild West stunts will be in
cluded on the program but thrills a

plenty will ho furnished by the youth
ful riders. Barehack riding, jumping,
and other exhibitions of horsemanship
are included. Thirty-six cups will be
awarded in the various horse show
events.
Rinlintin, a police dog, "war hero,"
and movie star, shared the honors with
Fred Frelie's trick pony last year as
the animal stars of the circus. Definite
arrangements have not yet been com
pleted for the special animal per
formers on this year's program but
the presence of everything except lions
and elephants is promised.
The children now at the Convales
cent, Home will be the guests of the
Menlo Circus Club at the performance
June 23. Peanuts, pink lemonade, and
all the trappings of a regular circus
will create the proper atmosphere un
der the "big top."
