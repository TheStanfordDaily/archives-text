# "VICTORY FOR HOUSE" IS BATTLE-CRY FOR ANNUAL SPRING DRIVE
## 
### 
Shouting and hilarious jollity. Big
chocolate-coated cakes and huge boxes
of candy. Merriment. Osculations.
The annual spring drive for June
brides is on. Most of the sororities on
the Row have already had senior
breakfast and several engagements
have been announced. The total for
each house varies from one to five.
Several of the betrothals have been
kept secret which makes everything
all the more thrilling. One house found
it necessary to dig down into twenty-
pounds of luscious bon-bons to
find the announcements.
Who says that enmity exists between
Stanford men and women? Most of
the Stanford women now engaged, se
lected Stanford men for their future
spouses. Who says there is friction?
Maybe not now. Maybe afterwards.
