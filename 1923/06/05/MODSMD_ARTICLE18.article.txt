## 
### Marjorie Allen, '26 
Miss Myrtle Klahn. '22, will appear
in an organ recital in the Memorial
Church tomorrow afternoon at 4:15.
The program includes a sonata by
Rogers, Bach's Fantasia in G minor,
and lighter numbers by Guilmant and
Bonnet.
Rarely, perhaps never before, has a
Stanford student appeared in recital on
the organ in the church. Tt takes unusual
talent, and 110 end of pluck and perse
verance, for a student to carry 011 ad
vanced musical studies and a rigorous
academic course at the same time. Miss
Klahn Has not only accomplished that
foat, but has also distinguished herself
in athletics and in scholarship. Proof of
the latter is afforded in her election to
Phi Beta Kappa last year, and her ap
pointment as assistant in instruction this
last year in the department of Romanic
Languages.
Warren 1). Allen, University organist,
has directed her organ studies. She was
selected as organist on the occasion of
the "Creation" performance last March.
Miss Klahn has also served for two
years as organist in the First Presby
terian church, Palo Alto, and has been
of valued assistance in the chapel serv
ices at the Memorial church.
The appearance of Marjorie Mac Don
ald, '23, pianist, in recital this evening at
8 o'clock at the Palo Alto Community
House, is another example of musical
achievement.
The program to be presented by Miss
Mac Donald is as ambitious, exacting, and
interesting as any presented by the Con
servatory graduates. She is also complet
ing a major course in Romanic Lan
guage at the University.
