# SENIORS IN CONTROL
## 
### 
At about ten o'clock one night a certain living
group decided that decoration for its dance was
not going forward with enough rapidity. The fresh
man members, on whom the work had been dumped,
had evidently decided that studies were the better
part of college, and backed by the knowledge that
they would not be subjected to any sophomore ter
rorism, they had faded silently away when mention
was made of their working 011 an enterprise in which
they would not benefit.
Rather an interesting situation, for those inter
ested in situations. Here's how it was handled: the
upperclassmen met, gathered the freshmen together
with a few hints, and pnt them to work. No fuss,
tio paddles, no "discipline."
The above is a perfect example of the working
of senior control. Under the old system coercion
would be the rule, new students would be the goats,
and all within reach would be bathed. With seniors
in charge, nothing was done to any freshman ex
cept when the doing became necessary, and then the
action followed the course of common sense rather
than slapstick "discipline" antics.
Hack of the whole affair, of course, is the false
principle of making the newcomer the butt of all
menial labor. Until the attitude of "call a frosh"
gives way to one of reasonable co-operation in func
tions from which upperclassmen will benefit, one
may expect that the more independent of those who
come to Stanford will refuse to work as slaves on a
job from which they receive no particular good.
