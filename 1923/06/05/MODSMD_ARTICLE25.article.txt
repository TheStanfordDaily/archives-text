On the first page of what was probably the Razz
section of the Quad appeared the picture of the
Senior Control committee. This body was organ
ized last fall, and has already made itself sufficiently
known to "rate" mention in the yearbook.
This committee has been working, with some evi
dent opposition, towards what must inevitably be
the attitude of the student body towards its incom
ing members.
That attitude is one of welcome to the fresh
man as one who has come to carry on the good
work—in athletics or any phase of Stanford life —
which the other three classes have been doing so
far. The Senior Control committee and those back
ing it take the stand that a leg up is better than a
swift kick in inducing new men to get aboard the
l>oat.
Certainly when Stanford students scatter over
the country this summer it will be easier when
talking about Stanford to say to a high school pros
pect: "You will be welcome," than to have to give
out the warning: "Yes, come, it's a great place—
but keep away from the sophomores."
Besides taking charge of what upper class control
of freshman affairs is necessary, the Senior Control
committee has as its first year's record the intro
duction of a new yell leading system, a proposition
for special student assemblies, and such minor points
as senior smokers, poster ordinances, and adoption
of a permanent sophomore hat.
