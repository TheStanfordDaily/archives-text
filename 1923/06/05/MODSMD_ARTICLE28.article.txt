						STANFORD ENTERPRISE
## 
### 
Stanford is unique among universities in having 1
a charity of its own—the Convalescent I lome on the
campus. Stanford students have always taken an
active part in maintaining the Home—but the appeal
of the charity has not been limited to the student
Ixxly.
Four years ago the children of Menlo Park
conceived the idea of giving a circus for the benefit
of the Convalescent Home. Their experiment was
so successful that the following year their parents
co-operated with them and $10,000 was added to
the permanent endowment of the Home.
A like amount was cleared last year and now
the Menlo Park children are preparing for their
fourth circus and horseshow. The leading families
of the Peninsula, including many Stanford people,
are helping make the entertainment a success.
Since the circus and horseshow will not take
place until after college closes, it is obviously im
possible for the students to co-operate to the extent
they did last year. The one important way in
which the undergraduates can aid in the enterprise
is in advertising it. —P. B.
