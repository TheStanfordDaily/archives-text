# UNKNOWN BEAUTY'S NOTE RAISES NICE SOCIAL QUESTIONS

### 
What would you do if you received a
letter from a pretty girl asking to make
your acquaintance? Would you write
, her, or ignore the letter altogether?
These questions arc puzzling one of the
Stanford contributors to the College
Wits number of Judge. A few days ago
he received a letter, postmarked from a
little town in Massachusetts. His curi
osity was arousedâ€”he didn't know any
one in Massachusetts, much less in that
particular town.
Tearing open the seal, her.ad. It
was written by two girls, self-styled
pretty, who claimed they were lonely
and wished to make an acquaintance.
Hearing so much favorable criticism of
Stanford men, and seeing this particu
lar artist's name in Judge, they had de
cided to write.
