### 
With the opening of Toyon and Branner Halls next fall, and with the
installation of the new housing plan for men, housing accommodations for all
men who wish to live on the campus will be made possible and full responsi
bility for the control of Encina will be referred to the freshmen.
Under the new plans, the members of each residence hall will perfect a club
organization for <he control of affairs and discipline of the building. Branner
Hall will be an eating unit similar to Sequoia. Encina and Toyon will operate
eating clubs for the present.
A census of the applications that have been made for rooms for fall quarter
show that the halls, together witli I lie fraternity houses, will provide enough
space for ;ill men students to live on the campus without doubling up in rooms
as they have had to do

Upperclassmen on Every Floor
The Senior sponsor system as
worked out by the Executive Commit
tee co-ordinates with tlie plans to have
upperclassmen live in Encina. At least
one room ou every floor ol' each wing
will be reserved for an upperclass resi
dent who will act as adviser for the
new Lower Division students. The
method of selecting the advisers has
not been decided upon, but men will
probably be recommended by the Dean
of Men to a student committee for
final selection. The advisers will be
granted free rooms. Other upperclass
men assigned to Encina will live on
first and second floors in the east wing.
The normal capacity of dormitories
is as follows: Encina, 455; Sequoia,
31D; New Union, 12(5; Toyon Hall, 149;
Branner Hall. 133.
Plans for Application
The following plan for order of ap
plication for rooms in the Halls has
been made:
-. The present membership of the
Eating Clubs should have first choice
to draw for the rooms in Encina and
Toyon. but the 44 Encina men giving
Encina as first choice should have the
priority on Encina Hall. It is probable
that with the facilities in Toyon and
Encina the Eating Club membership
can be cared for. It is hoped that the
number of eating clubs can be reduced
to six.
2. Since the members fo the new
fraternity can probably be accommo
dated elsewhere they should not be
considered in any scheme of drawing
for rooms.
3. All non-club members applying
for Toyon or Branner Hall should
draw for first choice in accordance
with their period of residence for the
rooms in Branner. All remaining ap
plicants. aside from those already ap
plying for Sequoia and Union as first
choice should apply by lot for the
rooms available in these two buildings.
