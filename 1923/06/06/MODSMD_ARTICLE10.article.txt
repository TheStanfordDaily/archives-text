Crepe is now being adjusted to
the door of Greene's Gum Em
porium. Sadness reigns in the
hearts of those who were wont to
dispose of their nickles and dimes
for delights in various stages of
palatability. Mirth is absent from
the devotees of Camels, Mela
chrinos. and Luck Strikes as pur
chased over the old counter.
The fatal decree has been (se
cretly?) issued and the Gum Em
porium is one of those doomed.
According to the owner, all pri
vately-owned stores on the campus
are to be closed. "Stickey" Wil
son's, the Encina Cigar Store, and
Greene's shop are to receive the
official K. O. With the completion
of the Encina Dining Halls, the
eating clubs are to be moved over
there, the cafeteria will be moved
to where the eating clubs now are,
and the old cafeteria will be made
over into a soft drink and smoke
shop. Wilson's is to be converted
into a Y. M. C. A. room while the
fate of the old Gum Emporium is
as yet undecided. There will be
many mourners!
