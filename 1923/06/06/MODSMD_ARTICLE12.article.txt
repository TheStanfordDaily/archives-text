# 1923 SENIOR FARCE WILL GO ON BOARDS IN ASSEMBLY HALL AT END OF FINALS. JUNE 13
## 
### Allan Charles, ’25 
One week from today an examina
tion-weary crowd of Stanford students
will sink into Assembly hall seats for
a last look at a campus show before
withdrawing for the summer. The cast
of "The Hottentot," the 1923 Senior
Farce, will have the arduous task of
brushing away wandering thoughts of
wealth, stimulating their tired minds,
their stunned senses of humor, and
sending them away for the summer
with a good taste in their mouths and
in a happy state of mind.
The play is well adapted to accom
plish this task as the lines are full of
humor and the cast has been chosen
with unusual care. If the following
snatches are examples of what may be
expected next Wednesday evening, no
one will want to leave the campus be
fore seeing "The Hottentot":
"You're nervous? So am I nervous,
but I don't go around shaking trays
like that. You must learn to control
your nerves. You'll be more nervous
when I tell you that Perkins "
"That's the other lead —Sam Har
rington. played by Lloyd Nolan. You'll
notice how he carries the dry, dl*oll
humor. It's even more so in the first
act. The role reminds you of 'Clar
ence' in Booth Tarkington's comedy,
the Senior Farce two years ago. The
type of humor is much the same; the
position of the misunderstood hero is
alike."

"No, Mr. Gilford, the time has* come
when you must listen to rue. I am a
butler, sir, but I wasn't always a
butler. I was a janitor of one of the
largest apartment houses in Brooklyn,
and "
The butler is played by Kenneth
Chantry, the latest addition to the
cast. He has had only two previous re
hearsals, but has the poise and the
interpretation down well, and seems
to know his lines and cues through the
second act.
"Apparently, yes. That's what I can't
understand, how a great horseman like
Harrington could leave a barrel of
apples and a bucket of water where
the mare could get at it "
Ollie, played by Cecil Morris, never
seems quite at ease; his servants
bother him continually, and his wife
gets on his nerves. He is speaking
about "Bountiful" Peggy's racehorse.
Villain Makes Debut
"Flatterer? Can one flatter the stars,
or the moon, or " This is the vil
lain. rather more romantic than deep
dyed. Charley Parks seems to take
naturally to it. The villain's ideas are
not original, but he acts unconven
tionally."
"Carol, what sort of a chap is this
Harrington? Is he a regular guy, or is
he one of those dancing tea-hounds?"
Norris James takes the role of Alec,
the brother of Peggy Fairfax. He's a
