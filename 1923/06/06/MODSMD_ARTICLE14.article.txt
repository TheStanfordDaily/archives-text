# Registrar's Office Will Sell Stamped Envelopes
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office is again this
year selling stamped envelopes at 5c
a piece as a convenience for students
who desire to have their report cards
mailed to them. The profits from the
sale of these envelopes will be turned
over to the Stanford Home for Con
valescent Children.
The students are notified that in
order to have their report cards mailed
to them they must leave stamped and
addressed envelopes with the Regis
trar.
This is the third year in which the
Registrar's Office has had envelopes
on sale. iPast experience indicated
that the Convalescent Home will profit
to the extent of twenty or twenty-five
dollars through the small profit made
on each envelope sold.
