# Convalescent Home Board Directs Last Alumnae Tea
## 
### 
Members of the board of the Stanford
Home for Convalescent Children will be
in charge of the last alumnae tea of the
quarter at the Women's Clubhouse to
day from 4 to 6.
An unusually large number of reserva
tions for bridge and tea have already
been made and those in charge expect
the final tea will be the largest of the
quarter. The afternoon managed by Cap
and Gown members holds the record to
date.
Alumnae teas this year have so far
netted $62,3.78. Of this, $500 has been
voted toward repairing and improving
the clubhouse.
Those who will entertain include Mrs.
J. L. Simpson. Mrs. Alice Dulin, Mrs.
C. G. Allen, Mrs. D. L. Webster, and
Mary Jamison.
