# "Judge's Cup Number" of Chappie to Be Out Tuesday
## 
### 
To commemorate his winning
Judge's College Wits Contest, Chappie
breaks out Tuesday in an orgy of cele
bration. The "Judge's Cup Number,"
with a Fisher cover, will contain twice
the usual amount of art work, includ
ing a four-page section containing
nothing but art contributionsâ€”many
of them in two colors. The Old Boy,
according to his manager, has gone
hog wild this issue, and even those of
his subscribers who can't read will be
presented with an aggregation of in
triguing pictorial displays which is
guaranteed to knock them off the pro
verbial Christmas tree.
