# FINIS, VOLUME 63
## 
### 
In order to ensure the members of the Daily
Palo Alto staff against scholarship hatchets, the
Daily will cease publication with today's issue.
The summer edition of the Daily will appear once
a week, as usual, under the direction of W. F.
Leiser.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this opportunity of
thanking" those people, who though not on the staff,
contributed their time and talents to enlivening the
columns of the Daily. Those outsiders who have
done most to make Volume 63 a success are Ches
ter N. Iless, C. E. Walton, Ruth Mcßride, and
W. L. Sandberg. •
