# THE 						CARDINAL AT CHICAGO
## 
### 
While most of us are traveling home by Pullman
or box car, Stanford will be represented by ten
picked men on the track at Chicago. The N. C.
A. A. meet, in which are entered most of the big
colleges of the Middle West, is one of the annual
events on which the whole country fixes its sport
ing eyes, with only slightly less intensity than was
accorded the national intercollegiates at Phila
delphia.
The winning team in the Chicago affair would
be hard to pick even with a logarithmic table of
comparative times at hand. However, from what
we have seen the ten men do who are going East,
and what every one around the track house knows
of the track coach, it is a pretty good bet that Stan
ford will take thirty points on the track and field
events. Unless the Middle West has some undis
covered world beaters, that score ought to bring
Stanford close to the top of the stack.
To those ten men who have sacrificed to keep at
the grind of training for the event the Daily Palo
Alto wishes to join with the campus in a skyrocket
send-off.
