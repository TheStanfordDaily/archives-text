# Watch Out for the Worm
## 
### 
Word has leaked out in considerable quantity
that the sophomore of Sequoia hall last night cele
brated their pledge to abolish freshman discipline
with a warm entertainment, in which the freshmen
were the ones principally warmed. With a year's
knowledge of the University back of them, and the
assurance that they are no longer under the thumb
of "discipline," we would not be surprised if the
frosh were the hosts at a similar party in the near
future. In fact, they are hardly worth bothering
about if they cannot take care of themselves once
they have a measure of independence.
