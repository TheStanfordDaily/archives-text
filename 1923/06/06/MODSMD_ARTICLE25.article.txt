Those who were sufficiently interested in the
workings of Stanford's commons to look over the
financial report of the Union for the past seven
months, as published in the Daily I'alo Alto last
night, were surprised and probably pleased to notice
that the Union dining room was not making tl*.
fabulous profits attributed to it by those who glance
over the top items on the bill of fare. The fact that
the Union management was able to maintain the
standard of food and service set by itself, and use
the rentals to make up the deficit thus incurred,
speaks fairly well for the way iti which the Uni
versity is caring for the student grub line.
