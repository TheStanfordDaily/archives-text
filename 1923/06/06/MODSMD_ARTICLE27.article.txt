# SO SAYS SHE--

Numerous philosophers are extant on this campus.
E. R. T., '23, has set down in the following what she
conceives to be the tenets of those declaimers. It is a
pleasant conglomeration ol' Hegel, Kant, Schopenhauer
and Royce couched in our most approved terms of
college flippancy.
"What is the philosophy of the Younger Generation?
The old order continuously asks this question with
varying degrees of terror or disgust. It is loathe to
believe that syncopation devotees can be thoroughly
moral. It questions the modern 'excitement-eater's'
capacity for sound ethics. It likes to lament their lack
of 'spiritual insight.' It treasures a secret conviction
that they are incapable of serious introspection.
"But may it here be known, that the modern youth
and maiden ruminate, ponder, and mediate upon the
conundrum of existence more seriously than five of
their Victorian, church-going predecessors put together.
"The resultant philosophy of the Younger Generation
may be expressed without inquiring too nicely into
theological terminology by the words 'Idealistic Agnosti
cism." The central idea of this doctrine is 'We can not
know.'
"Indefinite numbers have independently reached the
subsequent conclusions. Whether these decisions will
prove fatal or disastrous to future society is left to the
reader's judgment.
"Man is an idolator through his inexplicable nature.
This quality urges him to conceive something more
exalted than himself. This unknowable quality urges
him to emulate the ideal idol he raises for himself.
This striving is his one claim to what theologians are
pleased to call 'divinity.' Where and how did this quality
originate? We do not know. We are cognizant of the
fact that somewhere along the line of evolution we have
acquired this ambitious something that animals have
not. But we can not know nod analyze this intangible
something that binds us to the world and restrains us
from suicide.
"To reward this unexplainable striving, man has
created for himself elaborate theological systems to set
forth hopefully the immortality of soul, the survival of
this intangible something after physical death. Through
self-analysis and introspection we admit that this human
desire to idolize something better than ourselves exists.
Beyond this we can know nothing.
"'Sacrilege!' cry our venerable elders. Perhaps we
are putting dynamite under the Rock of Ages, but not
without thinking. In spite of the influence of placid
parents who imbibed large portions of ready-made
dogma asking no questions, the average modern has
made healthy inquiries into the whys and wherefores of
existence. His desire for fundamental truths persists in
the face of numerous discouragements.
"In infancy the incredible incidents of Jonah and the
Whale and Daniel and the Lions were served to him as
indisputable fact. He was and is still, expected to
swallow time-honored doctrines because they satisfied
the dull appetites of his ancestors. Round-eyed interroga
tion results in a period of omnivorous philosophical
reading. The numerical delights of the seven-fold Path
intrigue him. The next week he is engrossed in Mrs.
Besant's Theosophical treatises. Zorastre, Confucius,'
Plato, Descartes, and Nietzsche are alternate objects
of his investigations. His is the period of ecstasy and
despair. One week life is devoutly dedicated to the
African missions, tlie next there is an ardent inclination
toward a cabaret career or whatever the juvenile mind
considers a state of abandon.
"In a physical world where every effect has a definite
cause, why is man's origin obscured? What is his pur
pose? Why are world masters incapable of self direction?
Why is there no absolute proof? Why? . . . Why? . . .
Why? These and a thousand other questions lacerate the
adolescent's mental fibre. One moment he is an extrava
gant optimist, the next a morbid pessimist. Emerging
from this chaos, the modern almost invariably joins the
ranks of the 'Idealistic Agnostics.' 'I can not know the
cause or meaning or end of existence. I am conscious
of life. There must be a reason. But I can not know,'
is the inevitable conclusion.
"Yet we shrink from referring our questions to
Nothing. Therefore we build up an individual philoso
phy, creating an idol superior to ourselves. The nucleus
of every religion is this undeniable quality of aiming
toward a humanly pre-conceived ideal. We can not
know the essence of this quality. We may only strive
blindly hoping in some degree we are gratifying our
inexplicable nature.
"We can not know. But we aim toward something
greater than ourselves.
"These are the principles of the Philosophy of the
Younger Generation. They are the results of midnight
discussions and early-morning symposiums. They are
not the convictions of the Horn-Rimmed Clan alone.
The outwardly flippant and carefree share them as well.
"As the pre-conceived ideal is realized, a higher one
is formulated. Eventually the old order wlil perceive
the effects of the present goal and realize that the
moderns do indulge in serious speculation, that the
Younger Generation is possessed of a sound philosophy.
But we can not know."
