# CARDINAL TRACKSTERS POTENTIAL WINNERS OF N.C.A.A. MEET JUNE 15 AND 16
## U.S.C. TEAM IS ENTERED Michigan, Illinois, Are Chief Competitors for First Place at Chicago 
### 
\ The Stanford track team will leave
for Chicago at 11 o'clock Sunday morn
ing on the Overland Limited. "Dink"]
Templeton, track coach, and Orville
H. Tucker, '24, next year's track mana
ger, will accompany the ten men on'
the track team.
Thirty-five or forty points should be
about enough to win the N. C. A. A. I
j track meet at Stagg Field, Chicago,
June 15 and IG. With a little more than j
even breaks, the ten Card trac-ksters j
that Coach "Dink" Templeton is tak-:
ing East with him should be able to
accumulate about that many points.
A first glance at the times and dis-1
tances made in the Western Confer- 1
ence meet at Ann Arbor last Saturday
is rather discouraging, for most of
those same athletes will compete at
Chicago. In addition, U. S. C. and pos
sibly one or two strong Western teams j
will be in the running.
Michigan Won Conference
Michigan won the Western Confer
ence by a half point over Illinois. I
Michigan scored 57 V& points to 57 by |
Illinois. Third place went to Wisconsin j
with 27 digits, and fourth tv lowa with I
one less. V
A glance at the times ruaoe at Ann
Arbor will give a fair ideiX of what the
Cardinal athletes will nave to do to
get into the point cpMTmn.
Campbell Ras Chance
The hu]i4wwL went in 0:9 4-5. Witt
man q£ / Micliigan won it. with Wilson J
of 10/a close behind him. If Paddock
runs for U. S. C., which is improbable,
things 1 slightly different. Count
ing the "world's fastest human" out,|
however, Campbell should be able to
push his way into fourth or at least |
fifth place. One point here is a. con
servative estimate. In the 220, his It-: t
race, Campbell ought to take a second
in spite of the fact that Wilson of lowa
and Evans of Illinois can run around
0:21 1-5. That's five points.
Van Judah and Williamson will have
to travel to get better than a fourth
between them in the 440. with Sweet
of Illinois, Bier of Washington Uni
versity, St. Louis, and Martz of IT. S.
C., all able to do better than 49 sec
onds. Two points here brings the total
to seven.
Elliott May Get Second
The time of 4:28 3-5 made in the
Western Conference by Hall of Illinois
does not look particularly dangerous
