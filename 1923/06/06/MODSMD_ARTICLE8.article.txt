# CARDINAL TRACKSTERS POTENTIAL WINNERS OF N.C.A.A. MEET JUNE 15 AND 16
## U.S.C. TEAM IS ENTERED Michigan, Illinois, Are Chief Competitors for First Place at Chicago 
### 
\ The Stanford track team will leave
for Chicago at 11 o'clock Sunday morn
ing on the Overland Limited. "Dink"]
Templeton, track coach, and Orville
H. Tucker, '24, next year's track mana
ger, will accompany the ten men on'
the track team.
Thirty-five or forty points should be
about enough to win the N. C. A. A. I
j track meet at Stagg Field, Chicago,
June 15 and IG. With a little more than j
even breaks, the ten Card trac-ksters j
that Coach "Dink" Templeton is tak-:
ing East with him should be able to
accumulate about that many points.
A first glance at the times and dis-1
tances made in the Western Confer- 1
ence meet at Ann Arbor last Saturday
is rather discouraging, for most of
those same athletes will compete at
Chicago. In addition, U. S. C. and pos
sibly one or two strong Western teams j
will be in the running.
Michigan Won Conference
Michigan won the Western Confer
ence by a half point over Illinois. I
Michigan scored 57 V& points to 57 by |
Illinois. Third place went to Wisconsin j
with 27 digits, and fourth tv lowa with I
one less. V
A glance at the times ruaoe at Ann
Arbor will give a fair ideiX of what the
Cardinal athletes will nave to do to
get into the point cpMTmn.
Campbell Ras Chance
The hu]i4wwL went in 0:9 4-5. Witt
man q£ / Micliigan won it. with Wilson J
of 10/a close behind him. If Paddock
runs for U. S. C., which is improbable,
things 1 slightly different. Count
ing the "world's fastest human" out,|
however, Campbell should be able to
push his way into fourth or at least |
fifth place. One point here is a. con
servative estimate. In the 220, his It-: t
race, Campbell ought to take a second
in spite of the fact that Wilson of lowa
and Evans of Illinois can run around
0:21 1-5. That's five points.
Van Judah and Williamson will have
to travel to get better than a fourth
between them in the 440. with Sweet
of Illinois, Bier of Washington Uni
versity, St. Louis, and Martz of IT. S.
C., all able to do better than 49 sec
onds. Two points here brings the total
to seven.
Elliott May Get Second
The time of 4:28 3-5 made in the
Western Conference by Hall of Illinois
does not look particularly dangerous
and Elliott ought to ease into at least
second place if lie is in his usual form.
That makes eleven.
Falk and Leistner are going to meet
some stiff competition in the hurdles,
in Otto Anderson of U. S. C. and
Brookins of lowa. Anderson has beaten
the Card hurdlers twice this year and
may he able to turn the trick again.
In the meet last Saturday Brookins
shattered the world's record twice In
the low hurdles, clipping a fifth of a
second off the twenty-five-year-old rec
ord in the trials and another fifth in
the finals, when he ran in 0:23 1-5.
At Chicago, the hurdles will be run
around a curve, however. Leistner
should be good for a third, and Falk
a filth in this race. In the highs, the
two Card entries should take a second
and a fourth. This brings the imagi
nary total to twenty-one.
Black's Ankle Still Bad
With Bill Black's ankle still in rather
bad shape and with Brownell of Illinois
vaulting thirteen feet, two inches, the
Cards can hope for nothing higher
than a third in the pole vault. That
makes twenty-four.
The Mid-Western hammer throwers
don't look particularly good in view
of the fnct that Hindes of Michigan
only had to throw 144 feet, 4y» inches
to win the event last Saturday. Ludeke
has done 14<! and may be able to re
peat. At least he should ease into sec
ond with four points, which brings the
grand total to twenty-eight.
Anderson of U. S. C. should have
little trouble in winning the shot. Van
Orden of Michigan won it last Satur
day with a heave of forty-three feet,
eight and three-fifths inches. Anderson
can do from two to three feet better
than that. Ludeke or Arthur might
nose into a fifth place, but the possi
bility is slight.
Arthur May Get First
In the discus, the battle seems to be
between Anderson and Arthur. Both
can do 135 feet or a little better. Give
Arthur a second and bring the total
to thirty-two.
If Eskew can throw the javelin 185
feet or better, he should be good for a
fifth. That would make thirty-three.
That estimate may be wrong any
where from one to thirty-three points.
It is hardly safe to predict a Cardinal
victory at Chicago, but with fair
breaks, Templeton's men should be
mighty near the top.

that Coach "Dink" Templeton is tak-:
ing East with him should be able to
accumulate about that many points.
A first glance at the times and dis-1
tances made in the Western Confer- 1
ence meet at Ann Arbor last Saturday
is rather discouraging, for most of
those same athletes will compete at
Chicago. In addition, U. S. C. and pos
sibly one or two strong Western teams j
will be in the running.
Michigan Won Conference
Michigan won the Western Confer
ence by a half point over Illinois. I
Michigan scored 57 V& points to 57 by |
Illinois. Third place went to Wisconsin j
with 27 digits, and fourth tv lowa with I
one less. V
A glance at the times ruaoe at Ann
Arbor will give a fair ideiX of what the
Cardinal athletes will nave to do to
get into the point cpMTmn.
Campbell Ras Chance
The hu]i4wwL went in 0:9 4-5. Witt
man q£ / Micliigan won it. with Wilson J
of 10/a close behind him. If Paddock
runs for U. S. C., which is improbable,
things 1 slightly different. Count
ing the "world's fastest human" out,|
however, Campbell should be able to
push his way into fourth or at least |
fifth place. One point here is a. con
servative estimate. In the 220, his It-: t
race, Campbell ought to take a second
in spite of the fact that Wilson of lowa
and Evans of Illinois can run around
0:21 1-5. That's five points.
Van Judah and Williamson will have
to travel to get better than a fourth
between them in the 440. with Sweet
of Illinois, Bier of Washington Uni
versity, St. Louis, and Martz of IT. S.
C., all able to do better than 49 sec
onds. Two points here brings the total
to seven.
Elliott May Get Second
The time of 4:28 3-5 made in the
Western Conference by Hall of Illinois
does not look particularly dangerous
and Elliott ought to ease into at least
second place if lie is in his usual form.
That makes eleven.
Falk and Leistner are going to meet
some stiff competition in the hurdles,
in Otto Anderson of U. S. C. and
Brookins of lowa. Anderson has beaten
the Card hurdlers twice this year and
may he able to turn the trick again.
In the meet last Saturday Brookins
shattered the world's record twice In
the low hurdles, clipping a fifth of a
second off the twenty-five-year-old rec
ord in the trials and another fifth in
the finals, when he ran in 0:23 1-5.
At Chicago, the hurdles will be run
around a curve, however. Leistner
should be good for a third, and Falk
a filth in this race. In the highs, the
two Card entries should take a second
and a fourth. This brings the imagi
nary total to twenty-one.
Black's Ankle Still Bad
With Bill Black's ankle still in rather
bad shape and with Brownell of Illinois
vaulting thirteen feet, two inches, the
Cards can hope for nothing higher
than a third in the pole vault. That
makes twenty-four.
The Mid-Western hammer throwers
don't look particularly good in view
of the fnct that Hindes of Michigan
only had to throw 144 feet, 4y» inches
to win the event last Saturday. Ludeke
has done 14<! and may be able to re
peat. At least he should ease into sec
ond with four points, which brings the
grand total to twenty-eight.
Anderson of U. S. C. should have
little trouble in winning the shot. Van
Orden of Michigan won it last Satur
day with a heave of forty-three feet,
eight and three-fifths inches. Anderson
can do from two to three feet better
than that. Ludeke or Arthur might
nose into a fifth place, but the possi
bility is slight.
Arthur May Get First
In the discus, the battle seems to be
between Anderson and Arthur. Both
can do 135 feet or a little better. Give
Arthur a second and bring the total
to thirty-two.
If Eskew can throw the javelin 185
feet or better, he should be good for a
fifth. That would make thirty-three.
That estimate may be wrong any
where from one to thirty-three points.
It is hardly safe to predict a Cardinal
victory at Chicago, but with fair
breaks, Templeton's men should be
mighty near the top.
\ The Stanford track team will leave
for Chicago at 11 o'clock Sunday morn
ing on the Overland Limited. "Dink"]
Templeton, track coach, and Orville
H. Tucker, '24, next year's track mana
ger, will accompany the ten men on'
the track team.
Thirty-five or forty points should be
about enough to win the N. C. A. A. I
j track meet at Stagg Field, Chicago,
June 15 and IG. With a little more than j
even breaks, the ten Card trac-ksters j

with 27 digits, and fourth tv lowa with I
one less. V
A glance at the times ruaoe at Ann
Arbor will give a fair ideiX of what the
Cardinal athletes will nave to do to
get into the point cpMTmn.
Campbell Ras Chance
The hu]i4wwL went in 0:9 4-5. Witt
man q£ / Micliigan won it. with Wilson J
of 10/a close behind him. If Paddock
runs for U. S. C., which is improbable,
things 1 slightly different. Count
ing the "world's fastest human" out,|
however, Campbell should be able to
push his way into fourth or at least |
fifth place. One point here is a. con
servative estimate. In the 220, his It-: t
race, Campbell ought to take a second
in spite of the fact that Wilson of lowa
and Evans of Illinois can run around
0:21 1-5. That's five points.
Van Judah and Williamson will have
to travel to get better than a fourth
between them in the 440. with Sweet
of Illinois, Bier of Washington Uni
versity, St. Louis, and Martz of IT. S.
C., all able to do better than 49 sec
onds. Two points here brings the total
to seven.
Elliott May Get Second
The time of 4:28 3-5 made in the
Western Conference by Hall of Illinois
does not look particularly dangerous
and Elliott ought to ease into at least
second place if lie is in his usual form.
That makes eleven.
Falk and Leistner are going to meet
some stiff competition in the hurdles,
in Otto Anderson of U. S. C. and
Brookins of lowa. Anderson has beaten
the Card hurdlers twice this year and
may he able to turn the trick again.
In the meet last Saturday Brookins
shattered the world's record twice In
the low hurdles, clipping a fifth of a
second off the twenty-five-year-old rec
ord in the trials and another fifth in
the finals, when he ran in 0:23 1-5.
At Chicago, the hurdles will be run
around a curve, however. Leistner
should be good for a third, and Falk
a filth in this race. In the highs, the
two Card entries should take a second
and a fourth. This brings the imagi
nary total to twenty-one.
Black's Ankle Still Bad
With Bill Black's ankle still in rather
bad shape and with Brownell of Illinois
vaulting thirteen feet, two inches, the
Cards can hope for nothing higher
than a third in the pole vault. That
makes twenty-four.
The Mid-Western hammer throwers
don't look particularly good in view
of the fnct that Hindes of Michigan
only had to throw 144 feet, 4y» inches
to win the event last Saturday. Ludeke
has done 14<! and may be able to re
peat. At least he should ease into sec
ond with four points, which brings the
grand total to twenty-eight.
Anderson of U. S. C. should have
little trouble in winning the shot. Van
Orden of Michigan won it last Satur
day with a heave of forty-three feet,
eight and three-fifths inches. Anderson
can do from two to three feet better
than that. Ludeke or Arthur might
nose into a fifth place, but the possi
bility is slight.
Arthur May Get First
In the discus, the battle seems to be
between Anderson and Arthur. Both
can do 135 feet or a little better. Give
Arthur a second and bring the total
to thirty-two.
If Eskew can throw the javelin 185
feet or better, he should be good for a
fifth. That would make thirty-three.
That estimate may be wrong any
where from one to thirty-three points.
It is hardly safe to predict a Cardinal
victory at Chicago, but with fair
breaks, Templeton's men should be
mighty near the top.
\ The Stanford track team will leave
for Chicago at 11 o'clock Sunday morn
ing on the Overland Limited. "Dink"]
Templeton, track coach, and Orville
H. Tucker, '24, next year's track mana
ger, will accompany the ten men on'
the track team.
Thirty-five or forty points should be
about enough to win the N. C. A. A. I
j track meet at Stagg Field, Chicago,
June 15 and IG. With a little more than j
even breaks, the ten Card trac-ksters j
that Coach "Dink" Templeton is tak-:
ing East with him should be able to
accumulate about that many points.
A first glance at the times and dis-1
tances made in the Western Confer- 1
ence meet at Ann Arbor last Saturday
is rather discouraging, for most of
those same athletes will compete at
Chicago. In addition, U. S. C. and pos
sibly one or two strong Western teams j
will be in the running.

ence by a half point over Illinois. I
