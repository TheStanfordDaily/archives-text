# STANFORD AWARDED $10,000 GIFT FOR INSULIN TREATMENT
## New Discovery Cures Diabetes Lane Hospital Doctors Will Teach Use of Serum 
### 
Stanford University has received a
gift of $10,000 from John D. Rocke
feller, Jr., to be used by it in spreading
the knowledge and use of insulin, the
remarkable substance recently discovered,
in the treatment of diabetes.
The money is to be used by the terms
of the gift, in the clinic of Lane Hos
pital of the Stanford Medical School in
San Francisco, under the direction of
Dr. A. W. Hewlett and l)r. Thomas Ad
dis of the medical faculty, to increase
the number of free ward patients who
may receive the insulin treatment and to
teach physicians in general practice the
proper method of employing insulin in
such cases.
A number of medical institutions in
different parts of the United States have
been awarded similar funds for prÂ®mot
ing the use of insulin, the tan ford Medi
cal School being selected for the work
in this part of the country.
The Lane Hospital medical staff has
been using insulin for several months,
having received its first specimens last
November. Besides increasing the num
ber of patients in its clinical wards, the
Stanford medical experts will l>e enabled
through this fund to offer instruction to
physicians not only in the employment
of insulin but also diatetics, which is es
sential to a safe use of insulin. A force
of technical assistants, special nurses and
lecturers will be employed for the work
in addition to the men on the medical
staff now engaged in the study and use
of insulin.
Insulin is an etxract from the pan
creas of slaughter house animals, the
value *of which in treating diabetes
lies in the fact that by injection it re
stores to the patient's system ferments
that have been lost and that are re
quired to enable the body to utilize sugar
needed to produce heat and energy. The
loss of this ferment results in the ina
bility of the body to burn or oxidize this
sugar, which is therefore lost, resulting
in death.
The theory of insulin is easily under
stood by the medical practitioner but the
application is surrounded with many dif
ficulties and dangers. In order to ex
tend the necessary technical knowledge
and skill. John D. Rockefeller. Jr.. placed
a fund at the disposal of Dr. Simon
Flexner. who has selected the institu
tions that will carry on the work in vari
ous strategical points in the country.
The new substance has created intense
interest in the medical profession, since
the successful treatment of diabetes has
always been a difficult thing attended by
a high degree of mortality.
At Stanford, besides Dr. Hewlett and
Dr. Addis, Dr. Dwight K. Shepardson
has been devoting particular attention to
the insulin treatment, and Dr. Addis and
he will have immediate charge of the
work under the Rockefeller gift.
