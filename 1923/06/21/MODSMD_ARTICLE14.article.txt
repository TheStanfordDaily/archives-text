Stanford of the summer quarter is not the normal Stanford. Student
activity, dramatic, athletic, and journalistic enterprise, and social life, all
outside the class room, which lend to the University its true atmosphere,
are not present. In these extraneous respects the present quarter is "dead."
But in a way all its own the summer quarter has become a tradition
in itself. With other interests absent, it is obvious that the entire student
I tody at this time is here for one definite purpose, that of study, research,
and scholasic devetlopment. And Stanford is glad to welcome those stu
dents who choose this quarter as the proper one for an introduction to
the "farm," and particularly glad is she to welcome freshmen who begin
now the first of four years of undergraduate study. Men and women who
select the summer quarter for work, undoubtedly must qualify as to seri
ousness of purpose, and freshmen who enter now are quite likely to be
able to remain here.
To those who take up university work for the first time we would
say this: A few weeks of hard study at the first of this quarter may save
mail) valuable hours later. Learn to know your professors, and to know
how they desire work done. Accept standardized methods for the present.
You may improve on them later, but to begin with it is best to understand
what they are. Get a line on your courses, and adjust yourself to require
ments as soon as possible. A good many fiunkouts and innumerable low
grades are caused by failure to learn "what it's all about" during the first
two or three weeks of study. If you can solve your first problem, that of
getting your courses with reasonably good grades, other affairs in Stanford
life will come more easily. Settle yourself to this now. and learn about the
rest of the University later. Besides, there isn't a great deal otherwise to
learn about the University at this time, which is just the reason why the
summer quarter is an excellent one in which to begin.
