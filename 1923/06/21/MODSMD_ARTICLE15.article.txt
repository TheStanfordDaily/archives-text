Stanford traditions would fill a book. Some are and some are not
rigidly followed during the summer quarter. We take this opportunity
to point out one or two customs which old students will always follow
from force of habit, and which men new to Stanford should notice for
the mere reason that they are worth while.
No one smokes on the Quad. There was never handed down by any
authority an edict to this effect, and there is no machinery to enforce the
rule as law. The tradition grew up of itself, and it is never violated. . . .
When a Stanford student sings out a "hello," he hates to receive a
shocked look and surprised "how do you do" from the person addressed.
Students here speak to each other, and the salutation used is "hello."
Juniors are privileged to wear corduroys, as are all upperclassmen.
Seniors and holdovers wear soml>eros. Freshmen normally wear little
gray skull caps, and the sophomores have adopted a white hat with a red
band. The general idea !-eliind the whole scheme is that "dress/' as it is
emphasized in many universities, is considered unimportant at Stanford.
The last item we care to mention here concerns benches and steps.
The Law Steps are never used by women or freshmen. The Geology Bench
is not for members of other departments. The Engineering Bench is for
engineers. Neither is for queeners. The senior bench is for seniors and
holdovers only.
