The summer Daily Palo Alto will hold tryouts for any freshmen or
interested persons who would care to r°«*ve on the staff during the sum
mer. Students who desire to try a hand at the campus journalism game
will meet at the office in the Press Building next Wednesday evening, at
7 o'clock. Or they may see the editor at any time.
Men and women taken on the staff of the Summer Daily do not
thereby become members of the Daily Palo Alto staff which prepares the
paper during the regular quarters. However, they should learn enough to
make the fall tryouts more simple for them; and it may l>e remarked that
those who served with the present editor two summers ago were able to
make the staff in the fall, where but ten reporters from a field of fifty
candidates were added to that staff.
