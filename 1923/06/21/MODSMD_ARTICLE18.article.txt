# "KEEP TUNED UP" ADVISES PRESIDENT AT COMMENCEMENT
## Some Human Machines Are Monkey Wrenches; Others Are Constructive Units 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, in his
last talk to the graduates of 1923, com
pared the human mechanism to the ordi
nary engine, speaking as follows:
"The body of man is a machine of
limited life but of almost unlimited pos
sibilities. We consume food and oxygen
and do work, some of it mechanical,
some of it purposeful, and some of it
mental. As simple machines we are
very much alike, but in purposeful physi
cal action or in the processes of the
mind we differ widely. Brain, muscle,
and nerve working together produce for
one man an inspiring painting, endur
ing literature, or a glorious piece of
music, while in another the result is a
sketchy blot, a frothy love story, or
jazz.
"Some human machines evolve con
structive mechanism serving society,
others produce only monkey wrenches
to throw into whatever is being built
up. As a machine Lincoln weighed no
more than many of his contemporaries.
He consumed no more food and oxygen,
and did more physical labor than mil
lions of others, and yet his mental work,
when combined with what we call his
ideals, spirit and religion, freed millions
of slaves, saved the Union and gave a
new impulse to collective human living.
"Education is an artificial process
which we apply to the human machine
in the hope of broadening the scope of
its usefulness. It is an attempt to make
every man something far beyond a mere
vegetable turning water and gas into
food, food into tissue and energy, until
age slows and finally stills the process.
"You men and women of the gradu
ating class have not had a fair start
toward an education. You have fol
lowed a few trails that lead into the
fields of knowledge, you know some
thing of the roads and where many of
the maps and guides are located. Each
of you has a very great possession
known as the "human will." With it
you make decisions, choices, judgments.
You alone control. In your body and
brain you have a wonderful trained ma
chine. It will carry along the person
ality we call "you" until worn with use
it drops out of the game of life.
"An engine may be built of the very
best of materials in the best possible
design, but unless it is kept tuned up
it cannot do full work or meet unex
pected strain. Here at Stanford you
have been put through a tuning-up
process. Your body and mind have been
taught to work together and you have
been tuned up to work with your fel
low citizens. Right now you ought to
be able to go ahead with full power and
without undue strain. Are you going to
settle down to rest and rust, or are you
going to keep tuned up and going
strong? If a man's mind is to work
smoothly it must have regular use. If
you fail to keep up all of the mental
work that is worth while your mental
machine is sure to clog, slow down, and
miss on one or more cylinders. If you
adopt congealed methods of thought,
sometimes called prejudices, because you
can limp along without tuning up and
looking everything square in the face,
then you have put in a damper to snuff
off part of the life of your engine.
"Some drivers hang on to the brake
lever most of the time and wonder why
others go ahead. In short, if you keep
tuned up, with the body clean and
healthy, the brain active and working
