# CORNELL OARSMEN GET ONE CARLOAD OF SPRUCE
## 
### 
CORNELL UNIVERSITYâ€”A ear
load containing 2000 board feet of
select spruce to make oars for the
Cornell crews arived recently. The
lumber was purchased from a Buffalo
company after careful examination on
the part of the crew authorities. A
thirty years' supply of spruce owned
by the Athletic Association was ex
hausted last season, necessitating a
search for new material to withstand
the pull of Cornell oarsmen.
