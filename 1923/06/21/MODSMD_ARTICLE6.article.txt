# SCIENTIST'S VIEW OF PROGRESS PRESENTED BY R.A. MILLIKAN
## First Man to Isolate Electron Thinks Religion and Science Uniting for Common Good 
### 
"The union of the spirit of science
and the spirit of religion offer the'only
solution of the problem sof the world
that face this generation." This was
the theme of Dr. Robert Andrews Milli
kan, the world-renowned scientist, presi
dent of the California Institute of
Technology, in his commencement ad
dress to the graduating class at the
Memorial Church, Monday morning,
June 18.
Dr. Millikan's address gained interest
from the fact that he spoke from the
viewpoint of a scientist, who was the
first man to isolate the electron, an
epochal achievement in the science of
physics; and that he was the author of
the joint statement recently signed by
a large number of leaders in science, re
ligion and civic life, declaring that there
is no conict between science and re
ligion. but that both are essential to
man's progress and happiness.
Dr. Millikan declared that one of the
greatest contributions of science to life
is the theory of evolution, and endorsed
the suggestion that "the anti-evolution
ist is opposed to evolution because it
never did very much for him."
He assailed those who seek to have
history taught for the purpose of sub
statiating preconceived bases of patriot
ism rather than to set forth actual his
torical facts, legislators who seek to
eliminate state enforcement of prohibi
tion, and those who oppose an interna
tional court as proposed by President
Harding. All these, he declared, inter
fere with the progress of the world.
Dr. Millikan sketched the marvellous
progress of the United States in the last
thirty years in material prosperity for
the individual, in intellectual and cul
tural opportunities through scientific
inventions and in industry through
science.
"The discoveries which I myself have
seen since my graduation in 1891," he
said, "transcend, 1 think, in both num
ber and in fundamental importance all
those which the preceding two hundred
years brought forth, and these latter
far transcend all those of the preceding
five thousand years.
"One of the greatest contributions of
science to life is the discovery that
progress is in general made by the evo
lutionary process. Einstein does not re
place Newton; here merely supplements
him. In so far as Newtonian mechanics
was a body of experimental facts it is
eternally true. The whole of Newton is
incorporated in Einstein. Let the revo
lutionary reformer ponder well that fact.
"The supreme question which the
present generation faces is, can we make
democracy work, not merely for Amer
ica, but for the world ? Can we replace
bullets by ballots? That question is be
ing asked more searchingly and more
fearfully today than it was in 1891. The
answer to it is to be given in the main
by you, young graduates, and by others
of like opportunity. If an affirmative
answer is found at all it will be because
the nations of the earth, including out
own, learn to take a more rational, a
more objective, a more scientific atti
tude toward life and all its problems
than any of them have as yet learned to
take. Some wag has said that the anti
evolutionist is opposed to evolution be
cause it never did very much for him.
I wish to take that witticism altogether
seriously. It is literally true that a good
many individuals are still in the jungle
so far as their method of meeting life's
problems, so far as the mainsprings of
their conduct are concerned.
"For in the jungle ignorance and
prejudice and impulse and emotion must
determine conduct, and so long as that
, is the case none other save the law of
i the jungle is possible. Man himself
i is just now emerging from the jungle.
! It was only a few hundred years ago
i that he began to try to use the experi
' mental and the objective method, to try
I to set aside all his prejudices and his
preconceptions, to suspend his judgment
until he had all the facts before him, to
spare no pains to lirst see all sides of
the situation and then to let his reason
and his intelligence, instead of his passion
and his prejudice, control his decisions.
That is called the scientific method.
Why? Not because it is applied only
in the study of sciences, and because it
finds its finest application today, though
not its only one, in the analytical sub
jects of mathematics, physics, and chem
istry. It is because of that method that
these sciences have very recently made
the astounding strides referred to a mo
ment ago. It is because of it and what
it has done already that scientists dare
to hope that the law of the jungle can
ultimately be displaced by the law of
reason, not only in our domestic affairs,
but in our international ones as well. It
is because of it that scientists in gen
eral believe that human life may de
definitely enriched and human happiness
enormously multiplied.
"But how far are we from the appli
cation of that method now, even in our
so-called enlightened United States?
Let a few illustrations answer. A few
weeks ago the daily press reported that
the New York legislature had passed
a bill requiring that the history of the
Revolutionary period be taught in the
New York schools so as to develop
patriotism. The only possible interpre
tation of that act was that the legis
lature desired the facts of the revolution
to be distorted to suit the prejudices of
dwellers in New York. It is fortunate,
indeed, that this was the same legis

' latin* that lias just passed a bill which,
| whatever its purely legal and technical
status is yet deliberately aimed at the
j nullification within New York state of
the present constitution of the United
States, since otherwise there would be
! two such legislatures instead of only
one in 'his country. And yet New York
thinks that it is representative at least
; of the average state of evolution and of
! intelligence of the country. Let us hope
. that it is mistaken!
"My second illustration, however, is
j not taken from New York. 1 recently
asked a prominent school-book pub
| lished if it would be possible to begin a
! slow process of eliminating the mis
understandings which lead to war be
| tweeti peoples by inducing publishers of
i school histories in all countries to sub- !
I nit their proposed school books to three
| or four international historians of world
j repute, who would endorse them, if they
I were able to do so, by the statement
: that these histories pictured essentially
I correctly the portions of the field of
j history with which they dealt. His re-
I ply was. 'No. It is not yet possible to
i take such a step in the United States,
1 for the reason that school boards do not
j yet in this country want history to be
| taught as it happened. They want some
! thing to be called history which pleases
I their pride and appeals to their preju
! dices, and I know it because we are our-!
j selves just having our histories attacked
in the state of Washington on the
ground not that they are incorrect, but
that they are unpatriotic.' This means J
that we arc doing in America today pre- j
cisely what the whole world condemned
Germany for doing in all the years pre- j
I ceding 1914, namely, teaching national-1
; ism in preference to truth. The Ameri- j
can newspaper which claims to have the j
' largest circulation of any newspaper in '
i the world displays as its motto the '
; words of Stephen Decatur completely I
inexcusable, at least as they are usually !
understood, 'Our country! May she al-!
; ways be right, but our country right or j
wrong.' It was in very fact the inter
| national hates and misunderstandings
; caused by just that sort of teaching
which brought on the great war. And
yet there are a dozen American news- !
papers which are sedulously spreading
not merely anti-British, but anti-inter-!
national propaganda of every descrip- j
j tion.
"A British visitor-who has traveled;
and lived in this country recently told I
me that if his analysis were correct the i
United States was more likely to start I
another war than was any nation of j
Europe. But if another such war as j
the last is started, I, for one, fear that j
the world may bid goodbye to civiliza
tion. I am far from being a pessimist |
but the history of central Asia, once j
at the center of the earth's civilization, \
and again, the very recent history of |
Russia, both show that it is possible to j
destroy civilization completely in a very I
few years of time. Let those who de- j
liberately set to work by distortion and!
untruth, by misrepresentation and cyni- j
cal mistrust of motives ,to stir up class j
i hates and class prejudices in America, j
reflect well upon these things. Some of |
i them do it from base motives, because j

| the mob has votes or pennies; others
| have good enough intentions but neither
j the intelligence nor the training to catch
the scientific spirit and to be able, or
even to try, to distinguish truth from
falsehood. Well-meaning men without
poise or any sort of scientific discrimin
ation, and highly trained and ablement
without conscience are about equally
grave dangers to the wholesome develop
ment of human society.
"One other glaring example. Look at
the storm of protest raised in the United
States Stnate when Mr. Harding pro
posed that we begin to try to establish
a machinry for settling judicially our
international difficulties by joining the
Hague court of international justice, and
I then ask yourself whether that protest
was dictated by ignorance and prejudice
or by intelligence and the scientific spirit.
"1 should like, in closing, to call the
attention of any man who is wondering
whether after all there is any progress,
whether mankind gets farther away from
the method of the jungle, and develops
any more of the spirit of science, or
of the spirit of service than he had in
the past ,to two recent events. Both of
these events seem small, but 1 think they
are pregnant with meaning ancrwith en
couragement for the man who ponders
| whether human society can ever really
! catch both the scientific spirit and the
altruistic spirit and realize the immense
| possibilities which are before it when it
j does.
"My first event is in the field of med
! ical education. I am informed by my
j medical friends that the medical fra
ternity has actually educated itself up to
! the point where allopaths and homeo-
J paths have got together, to abolish, so
j far as they themselves are concerned,
j sectarian schools of medicine. The last
j cif these particular sectarian schools, so
I I am told, has gone, having been simply
i and rationally combined into schools
| which teach merely medical science as
[it is known today. Truly the thoughts of
| men are widened with the process of the
j suns!
j "The second ground for encourage
ment is found in the following fact. A
statement upon the relations of science
and religion was recently drawn up,
j which Bishop Johnson of Los Angeles
characterized as a 'thoroughly pious
j statement.' It asserted that religion and
science were not only not antagonistic,
j but that both were necessary to the prog
i ress and the happiness of mankind. Fur
ther, this statement definitely reorgan
[ ized God, and it definitely assgined to
| religion an even more important place
|in human life than to science. Fifteen-
I sixteenths of all the scientists to whom
! that statement was submitted signed it
at once without a question as the state
j ment of their belief, and these men were
i chosen, let it be remembered, solely be
| cause of their outstanding character as
j scientists and without any knowledge of
j their religious views. Who is he who is
| asserting that science is materialistic and
j irreligious.
