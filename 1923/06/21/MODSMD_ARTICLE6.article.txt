# SCIENTIST'S VIEW OF PROGRESS PRESENTED BY R.A. MILLIKAN
## First Man to Isolate Electron Thinks Religion and Science Uniting for Common Good 
### 
"The union of the spirit of science
and the spirit of religion offer the'only
solution of the problem sof the world
that face this generation." This was
the theme of Dr. Robert Andrews Milli
kan, the world-renowned scientist, presi
dent of the California Institute of
Technology, in his commencement ad
dress to the graduating class at the
Memorial Church, Monday morning,
June 18.
Dr. Millikan's address gained interest
from the fact that he spoke from the
viewpoint of a scientist, who was the
first man to isolate the electron, an
epochal achievement in the science of
physics; and that he was the author of
the joint statement recently signed by
a large number of leaders in science, re
ligion and civic life, declaring that there
is no conict between science and re
ligion. but that both are essential to
man's progress and happiness.
Dr. Millikan declared that one of the
greatest contributions of science to life
is the theory of evolution, and endorsed
the suggestion that "the anti-evolution
ist is opposed to evolution because it
never did very much for him."
He assailed those who seek to have
history taught for the purpose of sub
statiating preconceived bases of patriot
ism rather than to set forth actual his
torical facts, legislators who seek to
eliminate state enforcement of prohibi
tion, and those who oppose an interna
tional court as proposed by President
Harding. All these, he declared, inter
fere with the progress of the world.
Dr. Millikan sketched the marvellous
progress of the United States in the last
thirty years in material prosperity for
the individual, in intellectual and cul
tural opportunities through scientific
inventions and in industry through
science.
"The discoveries which I myself have
seen since my graduation in 1891," he
said, "transcend, 1 think, in both num
ber and in fundamental importance all
those which the preceding two hundred
years brought forth, and these latter
far transcend all those of the preceding
five thousand years.
"One of the greatest contributions of
science to life is the discovery that
progress is in general made by the evo
lutionary process. Einstein does not re
place Newton; here merely supplements
him. In so far as Newtonian mechanics
was a body of experimental facts it is
eternally true. The whole of Newton is
incorporated in Einstein. Let the revo
lutionary reformer ponder well that fact.
"The supreme question which the
present generation faces is, can we make
democracy work, not merely for Amer
ica, but for the world ? Can we replace
bullets by ballots? That question is be
ing asked more searchingly and more
fearfully today than it was in 1891. The
answer to it is to be given in the main
by you, young graduates, and by others
of like opportunity. If an affirmative
answer is found at all it will be because
the nations of the earth, including out
own, learn to take a more rational, a
more objective, a more scientific atti
tude toward life and all its problems
than any of them have as yet learned to
take. Some wag has said that the anti
evolutionist is opposed to evolution be
cause it never did very much for him.
I wish to take that witticism altogether
seriously. It is literally true that a good
many individuals are still in the jungle
so far as their method of meeting life's
problems, so far as the mainsprings of
their conduct are concerned.
"For in the jungle ignorance and
prejudice and impulse and emotion must
determine conduct, and so long as that
, is the case none other save the law of
i the jungle is possible. Man himself
i is just now emerging from the jungle.

i that he began to try to use the experi
