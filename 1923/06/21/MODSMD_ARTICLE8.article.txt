# NEER AND DAVIES READY FOR TENNIS PLAY AT HAVERFORD
## Two Cardinals Will Attempt To Retain Doubles Title Won in 1922 tournament 
### 
Phil Neer and James Davies, holders
of the national intercollegiate doubles
tennis title, now at Havcrford, Pa., will
represent Stanford in the coming col
legiate tournament at the Merion Cricket
Club in an effort to retain their present
championship as well as to annex the
singles honors.
The field at Haverford this year will
have more possible champions than have
ever entered the struggle at any time
during the thirty years of tournaments.
Lucien Williams of Yale, present title
holder, will have great difficulty in hold
ing his crown. Arnold Jones of Har
vard, present national junior champion,
will be a strong contender, as will Frank
Anderson of Columbia, Carl Fischer (ft
Pennsylvania, and VVray Brown of
Washington University, St. Louis, to
say nothing of the Stanford players and
Wallace Bates and Phil Bettens of the
University of California.
Bates and Bettens are two tournament
players of sterling quality and experi
ence. Either is qualified to fight to the
final round. They arc about on a par
with the Cardinals. Davies finally won
from Bates in the last match played be
tween the two in San Francisco, though
it was only after several sets of many
extra games.
Neer and Davies are the only men west
of the Mississippi who have ever taken
a championship at Havcrford. Neer
captured the singles honors in 1921, and
last year the two men won the doubles
title.
Following the play at the Merion
Cricket Club, the Stanford men will
combine with Princeton players to meet
the Oxford-Cambridge combination at
Seabright.
