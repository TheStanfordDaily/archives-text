# WORK OF FASCISTI SAID TO RESTORE MORALE OF ITALY
## Princess Borghese Sketches Development of Mussolini As Writer and Statesman 
### 
"The Italian people are now, through
the work of the Fascisti movement,
expressing themselves spontaneously
from within in order to assert their
desire for true and durable liberty
through the active, peaceful, and disci
plined work of the younger genera
tion." Thus the Fascisti movement and
the work of its leader, Mussolini, were
characterized by the Princess Donna
Santa Borghese before a University
assembly last Friday morning.
The distinguished Italian visitor
pointed out that the progress of Italy
as a nation dates back only to 1870,
and that at the time of the outbreak
of the World War a national spirit was
only imperfectly developed. After the
first military reverses of the Italian
army there was a general demoraliza
tion, not only in the ranks but in the
country in general, and it was only
with the rise of the Fascisti party,
headed by the brilliant and capable
Mussolini, in the months following the
war, that the morale of the people was
restored to a point which made recon
struction possible.
Mussolini was born of humble par
ents in a small Italian village, his
father being the village blacksmith
and his mother a teacher. He became
a teacher, but early entered journalism
as a wider field in which to serve his
country. He was expelled from the
country for editing a radical Socialist
paper, and went to Austria, where he
was forced to do hard manual labor
in order to live, but all the time he
continued to study and write. Before
the outbreak of the war he was back
in Italy, and for two years he served
as a private in the army. After being
wounded and rendered unfit for further
military service he again became an
editor, and gained national recognition
from his writings. Seeing the need for
national unity he formed the Fascisti
party, using the old Nationalist body
as a nucleus. The movement grew rap
idly following the elections of 1920,
and after refusing several positions in
the Italian cabinet, was appointed
Prime Minister by the King in Octo
ber, 1922. By this time he was re
garded as the outstanding man to
carry forward the work of reconstruc
tion and organization throughout the
country. At the present time Italy is
making great strides in the work of
the government, education, and social
progress.
