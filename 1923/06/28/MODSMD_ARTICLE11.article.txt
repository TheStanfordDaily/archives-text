# Al White Will Defend Title at Yosemite Meet
## 
### 
A1 White, Stanford's national fancy
(living champion, is now in Yosemite
to defend his P.A.A. title won there
last year. He will have keener compe
tition this trip but can be depended
upon, nevertheless, to bring back the
five points going to first place. De
Ferrari and Hughes, of San Francisco,
who were the runners up last year, are
on deck again and craving retribution,
along with several young hopefuls
from the south.
White has been improving with prac
tice and with the added year of com
petition behind him figures to show
them how once more.
