Clarence Pinkston, former diving
champion, is once again at Stanford.

He has been on_the board only twice
so far, but that has been enough to
prove that he will not have much dif
ficulty in regaining the form with
which he wo nthe world's champion
ship at Antwerp in 1920. With A1
White he will give Stanford a diving
team that will be supreme in any com
petition.
