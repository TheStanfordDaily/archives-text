# BENTINCK WILL PRESENT "THE HOTTENTOT," JULY 13
## 
### 
In response to the desire of the many who missed 'The Hottentot" at its
initial performance here, and for the entertainment of the many visitors to the
campus this summer, work has already commenced on the play tinder the
direction of Richard Bentinck and it will be presented in the Stanford
Assembly Hall, July 13th.
"The Hottentot" was produced as the senior farce when it proved to
the stage hit of the year. Lloyd Nolan, as Sam Harrington, was a great
success. He will again take the lead and has the support of a cast which, on

ability and experience, should be even
superior to that of the Senior Farce.
If this show proves a success finan
cially, the English Club will continue
to give plays throughout the summer.
Arrangements have already been made
to secure Molnar's "Liliom" which has
so delighted New York.
The complete cast of "The Hotten
tot" includes:
Sam Harrington Lloyd Nolan
Peggy Fairfax Gertrude McLeod
Swift * A. 1). Cohan
Alec Fairfax C. E. "Walton
Larry Crawford J. A. Dillman
Ollie Gilford Leonard Aho
