# A 						NEW STORY
## 
### 
There will l>e this summer for the press no great story of the large
number of Stanford athletes who were disqualified from further activity
by the operation of the faculty axe in final examinations. On checking
over at the Registrar's Office a list of about 170 athletes, freshmen and
varsity, it is found that none who intended to return to college in the fall
failed to obtain passing grades. There were two casualties, but the men
concerned had previously declared definite intentions of being elsewhere
when the University opens in October, regardless of whether or not they
passed their courses.
The result is quite different from that of last December examinations,
after which the press of the country got the story of disqualification of
fourteen of Stanford's most prominent athletes. Coach Templeton lost
no one whom he expected to have on his 1924 track team, and the chances
are that he will have back on the oval several of the prominent performers
who were lost last Christmas.
Coach Andy Kerr, of football, who returned to the campus a few days
ago, is overjoyed that he may have the entire outfit which he organized
in spring practice to begin with in fall training September 15. Kerr made
a good start with football last season, and during the spring, with the aid
of Glenn W arner and Tiny Thornhill, he planned the offensive to be used
in the autoumn schedule. With no one lost, he can continue the work
right from where he left off, and the chances of a powerful Cardinal
evelen next season are much greater than they would be had one or two
candidates, of the backfield particularly, who were thought to be mighty
poor bets, actually failed to make the grade in examinations.
As far as disqualified athletes are concerned, the examination period
just closed is the most encouraging of many years. It may be that the
athletes are becoming better students. Certainly they were above the
university average in the last tests.
