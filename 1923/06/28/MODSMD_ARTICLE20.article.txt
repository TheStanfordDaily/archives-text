# ABOUT PROFESSORS
## 
### 
The summer quarter brings to Stanford both students and professors
new to the classrooms of the Quad. This comment concerns the pro
fessors. At once may we say that Stanford students have no other than
the most friendly attitude toward our invited instructors. However,
Upton Sinclair to the contrary, students as well as others of this campus
enjoy the right of free comment and suggestion, from which even the
visiting professor is not exempt.
In our mind the visiting professors fall into three classes. There is
first the instructor, often of a smaller college, though occasionally from a
great faculty, who has heard that Stanford scholarship is high, and who
apparently desires to demonstrate that his own university is not one whit
behind. To prove this he assigns required work in unholy quantities. The
unusual requirements are not objected to so much as the fact that fre
quently the instructor concerned, in his own classroom, through interpre
tation and analysis, fails utterly to keep pace with them.
Then there is the instructor who talks down to his class, who does not
appreciate the ability of the professional student to assimilate. Recently
such a professor talked loudly of the necessity of "thorough reasoning,"
"keen analysis," et cetera, but in his advanced class he himself went less
deeply into a complicated subject and gave much less evidence of compe
tent thought than do our own instructors of the same department in the
elementary courses. Another instructor who realized his mistake at the
end of a quarter informed us that the Stanford student doing "C" work
would regularly qualify for an "A" in his own university.
Finally there is the allert professor who knows his subject as well as
how to teach it, who takes measures at the outset to feel out his class and
its capacities, and who develops his course accordingly. Nowhere in
college life is there a man more respected than the instructor who really
masters his subject matter, and who studies its presentation.
We do not offer advice. If professors are at all interested in student
opinion of them we suggest the lines often followed in student criticism.
What observation we make is based on previous quarters, not at all on the
present quarter; and perhaps it applies to all professors as well as to those
who visit us.
