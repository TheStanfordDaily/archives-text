# WORTH WHILE

### 
Most forms of student enterprise which provide amusement and
diversion for those registered in the University cannot he conducted dur
ing the summer. There is one form of activity, however, dramatics, which
may he continued on the usual high plane providing there are on the
campus certain persons willing to work without too much personal com
pensation. Director Richard Bentinck, who had charge of most of the
regular productions during the past year, seems so willing, and as a result
â– "The Hottentot" is announced for Friday, July 13.
"The Hottentot" is an unusually good play of the type most enjoyed by
a college audience. It was played recently as the senior farce, when'it met
with a great reception; and there followed a real demand that it l>e re
presented. A. D. Cohan, who directed the farce, will now take one of the
character parts, and Bentinck will assume direction of the play. The fact
that most of the actors have benefited by the experience of one ex
cellent presentation should guarantee something of a finished production.
Bentinck is to l>e congratulated for bringing "The Hottentot" back
to the campus during the summer. This character of play would be highly
welcome at any time, and far more so now. when worth while diversion is
rather limited. It will do much to take away the dread of looking forward
to Friday the 13th.
