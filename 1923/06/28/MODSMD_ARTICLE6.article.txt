# Saturday Is Last Day For Change of Program
## 
### 
The Registrar's Office calls atten
tion to the fact that Saturday is the
last day 011 which informal petitions
for changes in study lists will be al
lowed. By the University regulations
after the first three weeks of the quar
ter changes in the student's program
are allowed only for extraordinary
reasons, and usually then a fine of
several dollars is assessed.
