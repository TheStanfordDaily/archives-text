'All good things have come into the
world through childhood," said Profes
sor Edwin D. Starbuck, of the State
University of lowa, at a lecture on the
subject, "The Worth of a Child," given
Tuesday night in the Little Theatre.
Professor Starbuck, in discussing
the relationship existing between
child-development and human prog
ress, referred to the Prussian system
of education before the War as an
example of the way ideals may be in
stilled into the Nation through the
minds of children. "The family," he
declared, "is our most sacred institu
tion. It, as well as the Church and the
School, must become more child-cen
tered if the richer things of life are to
survive."
The speaker urged an educational
program in which cooperation, good
will, and a spirit of community effort
are particularly stressed.
Professor Starbuck was a member
of the Department of Education at
Stanford between the years 1595 and
1899.
