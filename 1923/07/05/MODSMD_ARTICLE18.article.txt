Italy, recently came to this country
and defeated Louis Senac, who had
held the professional championship of
the United States for several years,
never being challenged. He is the out

has not been defeated in this country.
Harry Maloney, who has coached
Stanford fencers into various cham

professional title since 1908, and has
not been called upon to defend his
title since.
The match between Sanges and Ma
loney will be held in the Civic Audi
torium in San Francisco, and will prob
ably attract wide attention, due to
the interest aroused through the Italia.
Virtus, the Unione Sportiva Italia, and
other active Italian athletic clubs in
the bay region. Sanges will later fence
in Los Angeles and continue on into
Mexico.
