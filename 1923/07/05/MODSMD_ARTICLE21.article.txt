The most informal event at Stanford is a Jolly Up. It is a gather
ing of students from all parts of the campus with a good dancing floor
and good music provided as a common basis for a good time.
Uy tradition women attend unescorted, and men likewise come alone.
In the fall, at the big Skull and Snakes jolly up, all women are taken to
the basketball pavilion in a Heet of University trucks.* As there are not
as many students registered this quarter, the women will, as in older days,
make their way from Roble and other points to the Women s Clubhouse
alone.
In addition to the restriction on queening, tradition has it also that
men wear campus clothing, including corduroys for students who are
entitled to wear them. At least half the dances are always tags.
There are only Stanford students at a jolly up, and introductions
are presumed.
It may be said without exaggeration that an orchestra of the best
quality has been obtained for the dance Friday evening. Nathenson,
when he was at Stanford two years ago, was regarded as the finest saxo
phone exponent who ever attended the University. Since that time he
has been playing with a San Jose organization. He will bring a drummer
from San Jose with him, and Mitchell, Wright, and Grinstead of the
campus will be in their usual places.
Students must attend at least one jolly up to know anything of
Stanford. Now that "The Hottentot'' has failed, as far as the editor
can see, the jolly up remains one of the only two student ''activities" to
survive the heat waves.
