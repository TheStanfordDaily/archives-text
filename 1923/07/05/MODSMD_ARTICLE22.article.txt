# A 						LINE ON THE FARM
## 
### 
''He hands out a great line," suggests one student of the words of
some fellow toiler in search of the higher American education, meaning
perhaps that his classmate has given evidence" of remarkably intelligent
thinking. Or he may mean that his comrade conceals well the fact that
he has little or nothing with which to think.
"In either case the line is an almost inalienable quality of the mixer
in student life. Like the wonderful Magnolia Balm of the old-time
medicine show, it is applied with equal success to all nature of fractures,
cuts, bruises, internal or external disorders in the fabric of campus
society. It is equally beneficial as a preventive of complications, and no
matter what use applied never fails to aid campus characters in their
daily life.
"The professor demands a good line when a student delays a mid
term report. The registrar must have a good one when some unfor
tunate forgets his syllabus fees. All must cultivate it to merit good
grades in real culture examinations, and the Dean of Men is the Uni
versity expert employed to be the receiving etui of various lines of the
great campus peddlers.
"The snake has his several lines to astonish his favorite charmer, and
the charmer needs her own to get away from some would-be rattler,
leaving him with the impression that he still rates a million. The 'poli
tician' develops one to indicate how deeply he thinks of student welfare,
and the real worker in student interest may need one to get his ideas over.
"There can be no doubt that the line is a recognized part of a college
education. Men with lx>th brains and a line are deemed more able to
secure opportunity to put their brains to use. Those who have a line
and no brains may still qualify for great success by hiding the things
they do not know. Men without a line, brains or no brains, may be con
sidered rather hopeless contenders against the mighty wielders of this all
round weapon of the present-day world.
"Yet with all this it is rather refreshing today to meet the man or
woman who says: 'Professor Square, I cut your eight o'clock because 1
was tired and slept through it;' or just plain, 'Oscar, you didn't â€”or
your line didn't get by.' "
