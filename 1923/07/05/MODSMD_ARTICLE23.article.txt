NOT THAT IT POSSESSES any particular merit, but because
the editor is rather pressed with other duties, the above comment from
Volume 59 of the regular Daily Palo Alto is presented for the purpose
of filling 1 this column. This action isn't exactly a theft, as the volume
named was so unfortunate as to be published under the same editor. If
other editorials appear in quotations this summer, it will be for the same
reasons.
