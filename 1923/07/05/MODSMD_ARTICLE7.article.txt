# MILLER DISCUSSES DUTY TO STANFORD IN CLASS ORATION
## 
### 
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
