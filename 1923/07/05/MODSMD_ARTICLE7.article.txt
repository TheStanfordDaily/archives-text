# MILLER DISCUSSES DUTY TO STANFORD IN CLASS ORATION
## 
### 
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
of perfect understanding or Sir Thomas
Moore's Utopia by exactly the amount
of intelligent work which we have not
accomplished.
I believe this basic principle is incon
trovertible. But we may go a step fur
ther and draw from this principle two
fundamental deductions which revolu
tionize our attitude toward what we may
heretofore have considered drudgery.
The first of these is this: That every
man owes a duty to work up to the
limit of his reasonable capacity; that no
man is earning his right to live who is

not doing his utmost to pull down this
obstruction in the path of human prog
ress, in the shape of work unperformed.
I believe it is the failure to arrive at
this conclusion which is responsible for
the widespread attitude, even among in
telligent persons, that it is enough to
get by; that only enough energy and
time should be spent in legitimate work
to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re
i quire no more. Business men with a

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are
satisfied with $2,(XX) because they can
live on that much. People generally are
content when they have fulfilled the
minimum requirement whether that
minimum consumes one-tenth of their
capacity or all of it.
But at this juncture the practically
minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However
unpleasant this argument may be to our j
ethical and moral sensibilities, we should
nevertheless grant it recognition were it j
not logically unsound. We have learned
during the last four years that to serve j
one's sell' in any legitimate enterprise j

and to serve human progress are one and
the same thing; that the same act ac
complishes the two-ffold function of
benefiting the doer of the work by se
curing him remuneration, and of aug
menting human progress by overcoming,
to some extent, the obstacles to advance
ment in the form of work undone. To
illustrate: Suppose a tree had fallen
across the highway and had blocked
traffic and caused a jam. Now suppose
a farmer pulls the log away because he
j wants it for firewood. It is clehr that
his single act has at once served the
I traffic by removing an obstacle to it, and
at the same time benefited the farmer
i by securing him firewood. And so it is
with all legitimate work. Its function

is two-foldâ€”first to benefit the worker,
and second to serve society. The first
function may be fulfilled when enough
work is done to satisfy one's personal
requirements, but the second can never
istnc of th most primitiv pretaoin shrd
be fulfilled until we utilize all our rea
sonable capacity, not along so-called
humanitarian or philanthropic lines, but
for ourselves, in any of the legitimate
fields which we have chosen here at
Stanford.
And now I come to the second of our
two fundamental deductions from our
original principle that the only obstruc
tion to human progress is undone work.
That deduction is this: that work is the
reward for itself; that it is the end in I
life and not the unpleasant means which |
must be endured before we can attain ;
our goal. If you ask an intelligent man I
on the street what it is that he wants in j
this life, he first will answer "money,"
but after serious thought he will answer,
"happiness, satisfaction, gratification."
In other words, the ultimate reward in
life is the existence of a certain satis
fying state of mind, which, Stanford has
convinced us, is attendant upon work
and nothing else. Each is, as it were,
a by-product of the other, and the two
are so inseparably interwoven, so inti
mately blended, that for all practical
purposes they are one. Just as hydro
gen and oxygen, in proper proportions
constitute water, so happiness and work
in proper proportions constitute life.
The compound cannot endure withoul
both. Neither can exist in the com
pound without the other.
I will never forget a statement which
Dr. Wilbur made during an assembly in
my freshman year. "After all," he said,
"about the best fun comes from the
knowledge of a job well done." At that
time his observation struck me as unin
telligible. I thought that the best fun
came from leaving as many jobs undone
as possible, and from devoting as much

of my time as the faculty would permit,
to idleness and unproductive entertain
ment. 1 am now convinced that there is
no pleasure which can pretend to rival
the intense gratification, the exquisite
satisfaction attendant upon the success
ful accomplishment of some job which
has cost relentless labor, and which at
the outset, you were afraid was too big
fo ryou. I am convinced that the amount
of happiness Which accrues to a man in
this life is in direct proportion to the
amount of intelligent work he has ac
complished. Fortunately, it is impossible
to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.

minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However
unpleasant this argument may be to our j
ethical and moral sensibilities, we should
nevertheless grant it recognition were it j
not logically unsound. We have learned
during the last four years that to serve j
one's sell' in any legitimate enterprise j

and to serve human progress are one and
the same thing; that the same act ac
complishes the two-ffold function of
benefiting the doer of the work by se
curing him remuneration, and of aug
menting human progress by overcoming,
to some extent, the obstacles to advance
ment in the form of work undone. To
illustrate: Suppose a tree had fallen
across the highway and had blocked
traffic and caused a jam. Now suppose
a farmer pulls the log away because he
j wants it for firewood. It is clehr that
his single act has at once served the
I traffic by removing an obstacle to it, and
at the same time benefited the farmer
i by securing him firewood. And so it is
with all legitimate work. Its function

is two-foldâ€”first to benefit the worker,
and second to serve society. The first
function may be fulfilled when enough
work is done to satisfy one's personal
requirements, but the second can never
istnc of th most primitiv pretaoin shrd
be fulfilled until we utilize all our rea
sonable capacity, not along so-called
humanitarian or philanthropic lines, but
for ourselves, in any of the legitimate
fields which we have chosen here at
Stanford.
And now I come to the second of our
two fundamental deductions from our
original principle that the only obstruc
tion to human progress is undone work.
That deduction is this: that work is the
reward for itself; that it is the end in I
life and not the unpleasant means which |
must be endured before we can attain ;
our goal. If you ask an intelligent man I
on the street what it is that he wants in j
this life, he first will answer "money,"
but after serious thought he will answer,
"happiness, satisfaction, gratification."
In other words, the ultimate reward in
life is the existence of a certain satis
fying state of mind, which, Stanford has
convinced us, is attendant upon work
and nothing else. Each is, as it were,
a by-product of the other, and the two
are so inseparably interwoven, so inti
mately blended, that for all practical
purposes they are one. Just as hydro
gen and oxygen, in proper proportions
constitute water, so happiness and work
in proper proportions constitute life.
The compound cannot endure withoul
both. Neither can exist in the com
pound without the other.
I will never forget a statement which
Dr. Wilbur made during an assembly in
my freshman year. "After all," he said,
"about the best fun comes from the
knowledge of a job well done." At that
time his observation struck me as unin
telligible. I thought that the best fun
came from leaving as many jobs undone
as possible, and from devoting as much

of my time as the faculty would permit,
to idleness and unproductive entertain
ment. 1 am now convinced that there is
no pleasure which can pretend to rival
the intense gratification, the exquisite
satisfaction attendant upon the success
ful accomplishment of some job which
has cost relentless labor, and which at
the outset, you were afraid was too big
fo ryou. I am convinced that the amount
of happiness Which accrues to a man in
this life is in direct proportion to the
amount of intelligent work he has ac
complished. Fortunately, it is impossible
to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
of perfect understanding or Sir Thomas
Moore's Utopia by exactly the amount
of intelligent work which we have not
accomplished.
I believe this basic principle is incon
trovertible. But we may go a step fur
ther and draw from this principle two
fundamental deductions which revolu
tionize our attitude toward what we may
heretofore have considered drudgery.
The first of these is this: That every
man owes a duty to work up to the
limit of his reasonable capacity; that no
man is earning his right to live who is

not doing his utmost to pull down this
obstruction in the path of human prog
ress, in the shape of work unperformed.
I believe it is the failure to arrive at
this conclusion which is responsible for
the widespread attitude, even among in
telligent persons, that it is enough to
get by; that only enough energy and
time should be spent in legitimate work
to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re
i quire no more. Business men with a

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are
satisfied with $2,(XX) because they can
live on that much. People generally are
content when they have fulfilled the
minimum requirement whether that
minimum consumes one-tenth of their
capacity or all of it.
But at this juncture the practically
minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However

ethical and moral sensibilities, we should

at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
of perfect understanding or Sir Thomas
Moore's Utopia by exactly the amount
of intelligent work which we have not
accomplished.
I believe this basic principle is incon
trovertible. But we may go a step fur
ther and draw from this principle two
fundamental deductions which revolu
tionize our attitude toward what we may
heretofore have considered drudgery.
The first of these is this: That every
man owes a duty to work up to the
limit of his reasonable capacity; that no
man is earning his right to live who is

not doing his utmost to pull down this
obstruction in the path of human prog
ress, in the shape of work unperformed.
I believe it is the failure to arrive at
this conclusion which is responsible for
the widespread attitude, even among in
telligent persons, that it is enough to
get by; that only enough energy and
time should be spent in legitimate work
to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re
i quire no more. Business men with a

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are
satisfied with $2,(XX) because they can
live on that much. People generally are
content when they have fulfilled the
minimum requirement whether that
minimum consumes one-tenth of their
capacity or all of it.
But at this juncture the practically
minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However
unpleasant this argument may be to our j
ethical and moral sensibilities, we should
nevertheless grant it recognition were it j
not logically unsound. We have learned
during the last four years that to serve j
one's sell' in any legitimate enterprise j

and to serve human progress are one and
the same thing; that the same act ac
complishes the two-ffold function of
benefiting the doer of the work by se
curing him remuneration, and of aug
menting human progress by overcoming,
to some extent, the obstacles to advance
ment in the form of work undone. To
illustrate: Suppose a tree had fallen
across the highway and had blocked
traffic and caused a jam. Now suppose
a farmer pulls the log away because he
j wants it for firewood. It is clehr that
his single act has at once served the
I traffic by removing an obstacle to it, and
at the same time benefited the farmer
i by securing him firewood. And so it is
with all legitimate work. Its function

is two-foldâ€”first to benefit the worker,
and second to serve society. The first
function may be fulfilled when enough
work is done to satisfy one's personal
requirements, but the second can never
istnc of th most primitiv pretaoin shrd
be fulfilled until we utilize all our rea
sonable capacity, not along so-called
humanitarian or philanthropic lines, but
for ourselves, in any of the legitimate
fields which we have chosen here at
Stanford.
And now I come to the second of our
two fundamental deductions from our
original principle that the only obstruc
tion to human progress is undone work.
That deduction is this: that work is the
reward for itself; that it is the end in I
life and not the unpleasant means which |
must be endured before we can attain ;
our goal. If you ask an intelligent man I
on the street what it is that he wants in j
this life, he first will answer "money,"
but after serious thought he will answer,
"happiness, satisfaction, gratification."
In other words, the ultimate reward in
life is the existence of a certain satis
fying state of mind, which, Stanford has
convinced us, is attendant upon work
and nothing else. Each is, as it were,
a by-product of the other, and the two
are so inseparably interwoven, so inti
mately blended, that for all practical
purposes they are one. Just as hydro
gen and oxygen, in proper proportions
constitute water, so happiness and work
in proper proportions constitute life.
The compound cannot endure withoul
both. Neither can exist in the com
pound without the other.
I will never forget a statement which
Dr. Wilbur made during an assembly in
my freshman year. "After all," he said,
"about the best fun comes from the
knowledge of a job well done." At that
time his observation struck me as unin
telligible. I thought that the best fun
came from leaving as many jobs undone
as possible, and from devoting as much

of my time as the faculty would permit,
to idleness and unproductive entertain
ment. 1 am now convinced that there is
no pleasure which can pretend to rival
the intense gratification, the exquisite
satisfaction attendant upon the success
ful accomplishment of some job which
has cost relentless labor, and which at
the outset, you were afraid was too big
fo ryou. I am convinced that the amount
of happiness Which accrues to a man in
this life is in direct proportion to the
amount of intelligent work he has ac
complished. Fortunately, it is impossible
to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our

to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re
i quire no more. Business men with a

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are
satisfied with $2,(XX) because they can
live on that much. People generally are
content when they have fulfilled the
minimum requirement whether that
minimum consumes one-tenth of their
capacity or all of it.
But at this juncture the practically
minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However
unpleasant this argument may be to our j
ethical and moral sensibilities, we should
nevertheless grant it recognition were it j
not logically unsound. We have learned
during the last four years that to serve j
one's sell' in any legitimate enterprise j

and to serve human progress are one and
the same thing; that the same act ac
complishes the two-ffold function of
benefiting the doer of the work by se
curing him remuneration, and of aug
menting human progress by overcoming,
to some extent, the obstacles to advance
ment in the form of work undone. To
illustrate: Suppose a tree had fallen
across the highway and had blocked
traffic and caused a jam. Now suppose
a farmer pulls the log away because he
j wants it for firewood. It is clehr that
his single act has at once served the
I traffic by removing an obstacle to it, and
at the same time benefited the farmer
i by securing him firewood. And so it is
with all legitimate work. Its function

is two-foldâ€”first to benefit the worker,
and second to serve society. The first
function may be fulfilled when enough
work is done to satisfy one's personal
requirements, but the second can never
istnc of th most primitiv pretaoin shrd
be fulfilled until we utilize all our rea
sonable capacity, not along so-called
humanitarian or philanthropic lines, but
for ourselves, in any of the legitimate
fields which we have chosen here at
Stanford.
And now I come to the second of our
two fundamental deductions from our
original principle that the only obstruc
tion to human progress is undone work.
That deduction is this: that work is the
reward for itself; that it is the end in I
life and not the unpleasant means which |
must be endured before we can attain ;
our goal. If you ask an intelligent man I
on the street what it is that he wants in j
this life, he first will answer "money,"
but after serious thought he will answer,
"happiness, satisfaction, gratification."
In other words, the ultimate reward in
life is the existence of a certain satis
fying state of mind, which, Stanford has
convinced us, is attendant upon work
and nothing else. Each is, as it were,
a by-product of the other, and the two
are so inseparably interwoven, so inti
mately blended, that for all practical
purposes they are one. Just as hydro
gen and oxygen, in proper proportions
constitute water, so happiness and work
in proper proportions constitute life.
The compound cannot endure withoul
both. Neither can exist in the com
pound without the other.
I will never forget a statement which
Dr. Wilbur made during an assembly in
my freshman year. "After all," he said,
"about the best fun comes from the
knowledge of a job well done." At that
time his observation struck me as unin
telligible. I thought that the best fun
came from leaving as many jobs undone
as possible, and from devoting as much

of my time as the faculty would permit,
to idleness and unproductive entertain
ment. 1 am now convinced that there is
no pleasure which can pretend to rival
the intense gratification, the exquisite
satisfaction attendant upon the success
ful accomplishment of some job which
has cost relentless labor, and which at
the outset, you were afraid was too big
fo ryou. I am convinced that the amount
of happiness Which accrues to a man in
this life is in direct proportion to the
amount of intelligent work he has ac
complished. Fortunately, it is impossible
to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
of perfect understanding or Sir Thomas
Moore's Utopia by exactly the amount
of intelligent work which we have not
accomplished.
I believe this basic principle is incon
trovertible. But we may go a step fur
ther and draw from this principle two
fundamental deductions which revolu
tionize our attitude toward what we may
heretofore have considered drudgery.
The first of these is this: That every
man owes a duty to work up to the
limit of his reasonable capacity; that no
man is earning his right to live who is

not doing his utmost to pull down this
obstruction in the path of human prog
ress, in the shape of work unperformed.
I believe it is the failure to arrive at
this conclusion which is responsible for
the widespread attitude, even among in
telligent persons, that it is enough to
get by; that only enough energy and
time should be spent in legitimate work
to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are

to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.
Knox Miller, speaking as orator of
the class of 1923, presented the follow
ing address at class day exercises:
"We hear a great deal nowadays about
the things the world expects of college
men; nix ut the responsibility which is
ours; about the duty we owe to our
selves and to our alma mater. Oddly
enough, we seldom question these ap
parent truisms. No one seems ever to
ask whether in fact we do owe any un
usual duty, or if we do, what it is that
we owe. When we consider the young
men of our generation who have pre
ferred not to go to college, and who in
consequence are now junior members in
successful businesses, have substantial
bank accounts and are evidently well
along the road to prosperity, and then
realize that we are to go out of here
in the course of a week to hunt for a
seventy-live-dollar-a-month job, we
sometimes wonder whether this duty we
hear so much about actually exists. Why
do we owe Stanford a duty? And if we
do, what is it? A duty to do what?
It is the purpose of this talk to try
to answer these two questions in as defi
nite and concrete terms as I can. De
spite the material handicap from the
point of view of time and money which
our training here has imposed, we feel,
as every Stanford graduating class has
felt, for some reason, probably not well
defined in our minds, that we have been
amply repaid for the material sacrifice
we have made.
Byron once said in an exquisite satire
on the views of George 111 concerning
this life, that the King didn't seem to
know much what it was all about. I
believe that the compensation we get at
Stanford which generates this feeling
we have of appreciation and obligation,
is a little better understanding of what
it is all about. At the foundation of this
partial understanding which we have lies
an appreciation of the relative impor
tance of the institution qf work among
the factors which constitute this life.
We are able to state one broad, funda
mental principle in this regard, upon
which we can base a sound, dependable,
everyday philosophy. That principle is
this: That the sole obstruction to the
progress of the human race is work as
yet undone. Just as mountains untun
eled, rivers unbridged, and trees uncut
are obstacles in the path of the progress
of a prospective railroad, so sickness un
cured, disputes undecided, population un
educated, cities unbuilt, and all the other
forms of legitimate work undone arc
obstacles in the path of progress of a
prospective civilization.
Our era has advanced beyond the ex
istence of the most primitive prehistoric
man by exactly the amount of intelli
gent work we have accomplished, and
our era is distant from Dante's realm
of perfect understanding or Sir Thomas
Moore's Utopia by exactly the amount
of intelligent work which we have not
accomplished.
I believe this basic principle is incon
trovertible. But we may go a step fur
ther and draw from this principle two
fundamental deductions which revolu
tionize our attitude toward what we may
heretofore have considered drudgery.
The first of these is this: That every
man owes a duty to work up to the
limit of his reasonable capacity; that no
man is earning his right to live who is

not doing his utmost to pull down this
obstruction in the path of human prog
ress, in the shape of work unperformed.
I believe it is the failure to arrive at
this conclusion which is responsible for
the widespread attitude, even among in
telligent persons, that it is enough to
get by; that only enough energy and
time should be spent in legitimate work
to provide for the requirements of our
existence and comfort, and that the re
mainder of one's capacity should be dis
! sipated in channels which either are of
! no assistance to progress, or are a posi
| tive obstruction to it. Students with a
capacity for twenty hours' work are con
! tent with fifteen because the faculty re
i quire no more. Business men with a

capacity to earn $20,000 per year are
satisfied with $2,(XX) because they can
live on that much. People generally are
content when they have fulfilled the
minimum requirement whether that
minimum consumes one-tenth of their
capacity or all of it.
But at this juncture the practically
minded man interposes and asks, "Why
should 1 work for human progress?
Why not be satisfied when I have sup
plied my own requirements? However
unpleasant this argument may be to our j
ethical and moral sensibilities, we should
nevertheless grant it recognition were it j
not logically unsound. We have learned
during the last four years that to serve j
one's sell' in any legitimate enterprise j

and to serve human progress are one and
the same thing; that the same act ac
complishes the two-ffold function of
benefiting the doer of the work by se
curing him remuneration, and of aug
menting human progress by overcoming,
to some extent, the obstacles to advance
ment in the form of work undone. To
illustrate: Suppose a tree had fallen
across the highway and had blocked
traffic and caused a jam. Now suppose
a farmer pulls the log away because he
j wants it for firewood. It is clehr that
his single act has at once served the
I traffic by removing an obstacle to it, and
at the same time benefited the farmer
i by securing him firewood. And so it is
with all legitimate work. Its function

is two-foldâ€”first to benefit the worker,
and second to serve society. The first
function may be fulfilled when enough
work is done to satisfy one's personal
requirements, but the second can never
istnc of th most primitiv pretaoin shrd
be fulfilled until we utilize all our rea
sonable capacity, not along so-called
humanitarian or philanthropic lines, but
for ourselves, in any of the legitimate
fields which we have chosen here at
Stanford.
And now I come to the second of our
two fundamental deductions from our
original principle that the only obstruc
tion to human progress is undone work.
That deduction is this: that work is the
reward for itself; that it is the end in I
life and not the unpleasant means which |
must be endured before we can attain ;
our goal. If you ask an intelligent man I
on the street what it is that he wants in j
this life, he first will answer "money,"
but after serious thought he will answer,
"happiness, satisfaction, gratification."
In other words, the ultimate reward in
life is the existence of a certain satis
fying state of mind, which, Stanford has
convinced us, is attendant upon work
and nothing else. Each is, as it were,
a by-product of the other, and the two
are so inseparably interwoven, so inti
mately blended, that for all practical
purposes they are one. Just as hydro
gen and oxygen, in proper proportions
constitute water, so happiness and work
in proper proportions constitute life.
The compound cannot endure withoul
both. Neither can exist in the com
pound without the other.
I will never forget a statement which
Dr. Wilbur made during an assembly in
my freshman year. "After all," he said,
"about the best fun comes from the
knowledge of a job well done." At that
time his observation struck me as unin
telligible. I thought that the best fun
came from leaving as many jobs undone
as possible, and from devoting as much

of my time as the faculty would permit,
to idleness and unproductive entertain
ment. 1 am now convinced that there is
no pleasure which can pretend to rival
the intense gratification, the exquisite
satisfaction attendant upon the success
ful accomplishment of some job which
has cost relentless labor, and which at
the outset, you were afraid was too big
fo ryou. I am convinced that the amount
of happiness Which accrues to a man in
this life is in direct proportion to the
amount of intelligent work he has ac
complished. Fortunately, it is impossible
to eliminate work from our world. It is
fundamental in the very nature of things
that as one man is cured another be
comes ill, as one city is built another is
destroyed, as one job is done another
arises. Our existence is predicated upon
work and the fact of existence is con
stantly creating more work to replace
that which is done. It will then always
be possible for every man to work up to
his reasonable capacity, and thereby to
secure for himself a like amount of hap
piness. It is the failure to arrive at this
second deduction which is esponsible for
the unhappy but widespread belief that
work is the bane of life; that it is a
necessary evil; the .unpleasant means
which must be endured before we arrive
at our goal. Stanford has cleared our
minds of this unfortunate misunderstand
ing. Four years here have reversed our
attitude toward this all important prob
lem. namely the relative importance of
work among the institutions of this
world.
The two questions which we originally
set out to answer, are then simple. We
do owe a duty to Stanford, and the rea
son why we owe it is because she has
taught us what it is. which is to work,
in whatever legitimate field we have
chosen, up to the limit of our reasonable
capacity. In so doing we not only secure
that which is the goal in life, but we
also fulfill our duty to ourselves and
to our Alma Mater.
