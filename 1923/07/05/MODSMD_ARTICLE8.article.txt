# WILLIAMSON AND ARTHUR RETURN TO UNIVERSITY
## Work of Leistner, Arthur, and Ludeke Improve Track Chances for Next Year 
### Dick Hyland 
Hows and Whys of the track meet
at Chicago were revealed this week
when "Blink" Williamson and Jim Ar
thur returned to the campus. In taking
second to Michigan with a field of
only ten entrants the squad added
much to the Cardinal reputation of
clean sportsmanship. The team mem
bers marveled at the manner in which
all Eastern coaches looked up to
"Dink" Templeton, the youngest coach
in the game. They seem all to possess
Charlie Paddock's opinion that Tem
pleton is without a peer.
Elmer Elliot was introduced as one
of the two "great men" in the mile
race. He was then elbowed off the
track by over-anxious competitors.
Captain Falk failed by a tenth of a
second to qualify, as did Daggs of
Pomona. Leistner, with a cold which
cost him his voice, and with eyes out
of which he could hardly see, ran sec
ond in the high sticks and fourth in
the lows.
Arthur and Ludeke came through in
fine fashion for most of Stanford's
points, on the field.
Williamson did the unexpected, in
"picking" or passing Yale Martz of
U. S. C. in a fair race on the back
stretch.
