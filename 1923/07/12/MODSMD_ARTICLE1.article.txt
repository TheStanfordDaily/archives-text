"Great progess, in spite of troubles
within, has taken place in China in
recent years. The Republic is only
twelve years old and is going through
a period of transition; a comparison
with America at the same stage of its
existence favors China," said Dr. Ping
Wen Kuo, president of the University
of Southeastern China, this morning
in University assembly.
Dr. Kuo pointed out that the changes
which have taken place in Europe 1n
the last few centuries are now all tak
ing place in China at once â€”simultane-
ously with the change In government
and making a difficult situation. He
stated that China is now ready for a
strong national government instead of
the provisional government of the last
twelve years.
The speaker said that in recent
years there has been progress in in
dustry, commerce, ways of communi
cation, and government. China has
moved ahead politically, as the people
have been converted to the republican
form of government.
The greatest progress, according to
Dr. Kuo, has been in the field of edu
cation. which is the foundation of the
republic. This improvement has been
both quantitative and qualitative. The
school system has been revised and is
now modern and up-to-date. This has
been accompanied with an intellectual
transformation which is known as the
Chinese Renaissance.
China, has realized that she is not
the onlv civilized nation and now de
sires to learn from Europe and Ameri
ca. Dr. Kuo believes that the center
of world activity will soon move from
the Atlantic to the Pacific and lie
thinks that China and America will
be the leading nations. He is very
confident that China will play a big
part and bases this mainly on the
changed attitude toward learning in
that country.
