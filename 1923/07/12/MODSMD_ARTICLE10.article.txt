# STUDENT MOVIE PROGRAM SET FOR FRIDAY, JULY 20
## Modern Navigation Problems Form Subject of Buster Keaton's Two-Reel Study 
### 
Two fast-moving comedies will be
the principal attractions at the first
showing of Student Movies this sum
mer, when Peter B. Kyne's "Brothers
Under the Skin," and Buster Keaton
in "The Boat" will be offered to the
campus in the Assembly Hall, a week
from tomorrow, at the nominal charge
of twenty-five cents.
Peter B. Kyne has taken for his
theme the idea that all wives think
they are doormats and all husbands
think they are henpecked, and with
his usual mastery, has developed a
very amusing picture. The $50,000-a
-year vice-president of the same firm
employing a $30-a-week clerk decides
that their marital problems are identi
cal, and after some most unusual situ
ations decides a cave-man course of
action is the only course to take with
wives who "would have bought the
City Hall on easy part-time payments."
Buster Keaton is at his best in "The
Boat," a First National picture. Build
ing his ship in the cellar of a house,
sailing uncharted seas, the unskilled
skipper discovers a real storm doesn't
add to the joys of life, and after a
queer combination of fate and in
genuity saving him from a watery
grave, Buster decides to give up navi
gation permanently.
A first-run reel of newsettes will also
be given simultaneously with the re
lease to San Francisco theaters. Music
will be furnished by Chirk Midgelev.
The pictures are being shown under
the auspices of English Club, and
a straight dance will be given immedi
ately afterward in the Women's Club
house to music furnished by Grinstead
and Nathanson's five-piece orchestra.
Whether or not any more movies or
dances will be given during the balance
of the quarter will largely depend
upon the success of the entertainment
to be provided next week.
