# N.E.A. CONFERENCE PROBLEMS PRESENTED BY DR. SHOWALTER
## 
### 
In an informal talk to the Education
Club at their meeting last evening Dr.
N. D. Showalter told of many interest
ing facts and incidents connected with
(he recent formation and convention
of the World Conference on Education.
Dr. Showalter as a Member of the
Board of Trustees, and as Chairman
of the International Council, was able
to present information which the pub
lic does not receive from usual
sources.
Probably the greatest immediate
problem that the conference had to
face was that of a basis of under
standable communication between its
members. More than five hundred
delegates representing fifty-eight na
tions, and speaking a total of thirty
two distinct languages, presented a
scene rivaling in confusion that of the
Tower of Babel.
The conference had its actual start
five years ago when, while at various
places groups of men were gathered
to determine diplomatic relations, or
to discuss political situations, a small
group of men representing a few na
tions met and considered the educa
tional need of the world.
"We easily speak of the world as
small today. Distance has been done
away with. But if we think for a mo
ment on the vast needs of the world
from an educational standpoint, of the
great magnitude of the factors in
volved and obstacles to be overcome in
accomplishing any international educa
tional program, we realize the colossal
size of the world." These were the
remarks of Dr. Showalter introductory
to his discussion of the work of the
conference.
"Before any conference could be or
ganized and delegates invited the po
litical suspicion of many nations had
to be allayed. It was necessary to con
vince the consuls of the non-political
nature of the conference and secure
their good will before any more defi
nite steps coidd be taken. Only after
two years of continued effort were
the original sponsors of the movement
successful in having President Hard
ing extend the invitation of the United
States to the various nations to par
ticipate.
"A basis for the understanding of
the peoples of a nation by those of
other nations was a fundamental need.
It was discovered to the great surprise
of Americans present that certain na
tions. particularly those to the south,
Avere being lead by 'movies' to an er
roneous conception of the American

peoples'and their standards and ideals.
This is because of the fact that the
vast majority of films, which are ex
ported from this country to foreign
countries, are those of such a nature
that they have been barred from show-'
ing here. Nothing could be worse than
this unjust influence.
"Ic is hoped to eventually create the
office in each nation of Education
Definite steps have been

taken for the continuance of the con-1
ference and its work. Next year sec
tional meetings will be held through
■ out Europe, Asia, America, and the
Orient, and groups of representatives
from these various sections will con
vene. The following year the World
Conference will be held.
'•In the meantime work will be car
ried 011 toward the formulation of a
text in International Civics. The dif

; Acuity here lies in the determining of
actualities in regard to many historical
1 details.
"As a means of promoting interna
tional good-will, the conference out
ranks in significance any conference
for disarmament or for diplomatic
purposes that has ever been held, for
its program is an active one, aimed at
the basic hope, the education of the
j child."
