# BRAZIL SAID TO HOLD ATTITUDE OF FRIENDSHIP FOR U.S.
## Professor P.A. Martin Meets Large Audience in Lecture On South American State 
### 
"When the iron deposits of Europe
anil America are exhausted there will
be mountains of pure ore in Brazil to
supply the world," Percy A. Martin,
professor of history, told an audience
which packed the Little Theatre to
hear him present an illustrated lec
ture on the largest state in South
America Tuesday.
Professor Martin dwelt briefly on
the history of the republic, which, un
til 1889. was a constitutional monarchy
of a very liberal type.
Solves Slavery Problem
Slavery, which in Brazil was a prob
lem as great as that in the United
States, was solved by gradual emanci
pation without bloodshed. Differing
with commentators who believe Brazil
destined to be a mulatto nation, Pro
fessor Martin believes that the higher
death rates among the black people,
coupled with immigration, will provide
a better fate. There are, however, some
three million negroes in Brazil, and
probably five million mulattos, and
people of the country are not inclined
to question the standing of men and
women who are "reasonably" white.
Supplies World Coffee
Southern Brazil produces tw*b-thirds
of the world's supply of coffee. The
rubber industry is decreasing.
"A great portion of the Amazon re
gion is still unexplored. Even near
Rio de Janiero," Martin said, "one
may a few miles from the city walk
through the most dense and unde
veloped areas of tropical forests, and
yet hear not far away the clang of
railroads and tramways."
Is Friendly to U. S.
Brazil, according to Professor Mar

tin, is one South American state which
is not suspicious of the Monroe Doc
trine, and which has remained friendly
toward the United States. Brazil went
into the World War for two reasons.
Her ships were sunk, as were those of
the United States, but a more im
portant consideration, Professor Mar
tin stated, was friendship for America.
As a great leader in Brazil stated at
the time, that country merely followed
its traditional policy of "continental
solidarity," or of friendship for the
United States, which had already de
clared war.
