# BRAZIL SAID TO HOLD ATTITUDE OF FRIENDSHIP FOR U.S.
## Professor P.A. Martin Meets Large Audience in Lecture On South American State 
### 
"When the iron deposits of Europe
anil America are exhausted there will
be mountains of pure ore in Brazil to
supply the world," Percy A. Martin,
professor of history, told an audience
which packed the Little Theatre to
hear him present an illustrated lec
ture on the largest state in South
America Tuesday.
Professor Martin dwelt briefly on
the history of the republic, which, un
til 1889. was a constitutional monarchy
of a very liberal type.
Solves Slavery Problem
Slavery, which in Brazil was a prob
lem as great as that in the United
States, was solved by gradual emanci
pation without bloodshed. Differing
with commentators who believe Brazil
destined to be a mulatto nation, Pro
fessor Martin believes that the higher
death rates among the black people,
coupled with immigration, will provide
a better fate. There are, however, some
three million negroes in Brazil, and
probably five million mulattos, and
people of the country are not inclined
to question the standing of men and
women who are "reasonably" white.
