# Visiting Professors Speak to Lawyers
## 
### 
On Thursday night, the Law Asso
ciation held a smoker in the Old Union
with the purpose of creating mutual
understanding and fellowship among
the summer law faculty and the sum
mer law students, many of whom are
visitors.
Each visiting member of the law
faculty spoke. They were Professor G.
P. Costigan of the University of Cali
fornia, Professor E. H. Decker of the
University of Oregon, Professor E.
Holbrook of the University of Michi
gan, and Professor F. R. Mechem of
the University of Chicago. The profes
sors believe that (he future of the
law profession is hopeful provided that
it de\otes its energies to constructive
public work and rids itself of its dis
honest members. 'High-mindedness and
perfection, not happiness, are the ends
of life." and all students should seek
these ends.
Mr. L. Martin presided. Profssor M.
R. Kirkwood, Dean of the Law School,
reviewed the work of the Law Asso
ciation. Music was provided by Bert
Levit.
