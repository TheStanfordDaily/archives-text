# CAMPUS IDEAS

Outside the editor's window the other night two students with excel
lent voices, commendable determination, and phenomenal endurance,
argued the distinction between "intelligence" and "achievement.' l'or
some reason or other, they were unable to set out the difference, but they
kept at the task with all the persistency of the mosquito 011 the editor's
ear. Being unable to depart on the longed-for journey to oblivion, said
editor was forced to entertain whatever thoughts entered his head, most
of which are not here printable. The noticeable contrast which subjects
enlisting interest and discussion among the students of this quarter bear
to those about which the men of the normal year talk, was rather force
ably brought home.
Near the Geology corner not long ago there waged a heated argu
ment as to the elements of happiness as attained by college men of forty
years. The most forceful orator insisted on these: (1) The true love of
a good woman. (2) Honest respect of intelligent associates and fellow
men. (3) Definite or measurable advancement along chosen lines of
work. (4) Money enough to proceed on comfortably. "Success" is sim
ilarly made up, we were given to believe.
The best types of soldiery formed the subject of another recent forum,
which apparently was the outgrowth of classroom discussion. The
toughest type of roughnecks, after learning the army's bad habits, make
the most effective men of the ranks, we learned from this. Politics and
national issues, problems of education, and automotive conversation
dominate the atmosphere of tables which we frequent.
All of which is quite unlike talk of national sports, proms, traditions,
and student enterprise of which we hear so much in the other three
quarters- More serious-minded persons often criticize our students for
keeping too much to these subjects, and for knowing so little of other
affairs. Some of the discussion we run into today is disgusting, and some
is interesting and worth while. Perhaps all of it leads to thinking ten
dencies, which are not bad as habits, and perhaps it would do the normal
student much good to live regularly in an atmosphere of the present sort.
On the other hand, the usual student would answer that the Stanford man
is t<so practical minded to be engaged in such arguments as those on
"intelligence" and "achievement."
