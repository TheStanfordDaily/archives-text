# STANFORD OARSMEN
## 
### 
Washington's wonderful victory over the best the East had to offer
in the great water classic at Poughkeepsie has revived talk of crew at
Stanford. Stanford's shells of the past were the fastest on the Pacific
Coast. The continued abandonment of the sport on the Farm has caused
no end of grief among followers of the Cardinal.
Despite great interest in crew, it seems that many years will yet
follow in which there will be no Stanford shell. True enough, there are on
foot great plans for the activity when it is to be taken up. The bay near
Palo Alto is to be dredged, and a hoathouse with proper facilities will
be provided so that Cardinal oarsmen to come will not face the necessity
of working out on the slough.
Hut the plans mean nothing, as there are two big reasons in the way
of crew at Stanford. First, the sport requires a large outlay of money,
and it brings in nothing. While the Cardinal authorities have no desire
to commercialize crew, it remains that they now carry four major activi
ties and many minor ones on the money made from football, and there is
110 surplus. Further, the plans of building a dormitory will require the
surplus for this purpose, if one ever develops.
In the second place, Stanford supports five major sports and all other
activities with a field of less than (>CK) eligible students from which to
develop team members. Such well known coaches as Bob Evans and
"Dink" Templeton were definitely for doing away with crew because of
this fact, and because it seemed to them that Stanford could not well try
to conduct too many activities with so few men. It would appear best
not to take up crew, at least until the Cards are 011 a firm basis in other
activities again. However, this question will not be debated in the near
future, as no one but Stanta Claus could make the sport financially pos
sible under present circumstances.
