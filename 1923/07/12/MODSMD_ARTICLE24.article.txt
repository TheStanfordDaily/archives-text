The editor has his nerve—running
his old stuff about "line," etc., and
coming right out to say it is for the
purpose of filling his column,
* * *
However, he ain't got anything on
Cabbages. If the ed can get away with
his two-year old dope, so can we, and
it isn't for the purpose of filling this
column either. It's because our old
stuff was worse than any we can write
now. In fact, it was in that same
volume to which the ed so modestly
referred that Cabbages by "T. I." first
gained a recognized career.
* * #
We know we had a career, because
someone wrote us referring to a "blot"
on it. As we said at the time, the blot
was then the only part of the career
we knew we had.

but there are those who declare the
Weiner-wurst."

"The Kampus Kar line presents the

The curves are banked."

"Sunshine makes the world go

and round. It ought to make it still." I
