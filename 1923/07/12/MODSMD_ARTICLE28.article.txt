# Helen Thoburn Will Speak at Asilomar
## 
### 
Miss Helen Thoburn, '08, will speak
at the Y. W. C. A. Summer Conference
which will be held at Asilomar from
August 3 to 13. She is now Y. W. C. A.
publication secretary for China. Others
who will address the conference are
Judge Florence A. Allen of the Su
preme Court of Ohio, Rev. Raymond
C. Brooks of Pomona College, and
Miss Lillie Margaret Sherman of the
University of California.
A number of Stanford women have
attended the past Asilomar confer
ences. Among them are Helen Schar
din, '24, president of the Y. W. C. A.,
and Marion Potter, '22, who held that
position last year. According to them
Asilomar is a place where one may
go for both pleasure and profit. The
mornings at the conference are usu
ally devoted to classes, and there are
also assemblies which all attend. Then
;n the evenings there are picnics and
singing around the campfire.
There are two classes of Asilomar
society. First there are the "stuck
ups," those girls who do some of the"
work at the camp. The "stuck-ups" are
recruited from the various schools and
colleges in this part of the country,
and a number of Stanford women have
served in that capacity. Then there
are the plain delegates.
All at Stanford who are planning to
attend the conference or who have any
idea of going are asked to see Miss
Woolsey, Helen Schardin, '24. or Dor
othy Shepard, '24. as soon as possible.
Any of these people will be glad to
give them any information which they
may desire.
