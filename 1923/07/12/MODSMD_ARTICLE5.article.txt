### 
Harry Maloney has been notified
of his appointment on the General
Olympic Committee in charge of Amer
ica's participation in the Olympic
Games in Paris in 1924. He is now
working on the problem of sending a
rugby team to the Olympic Games. He
has been asked to suggest any changes
deemed necessary in the rules, and
will recommend the names of outstand
ing rugby players in the West for
places on the national team. As presi
dent of the California Rugby Union
Maloney is the man best fitted to aid
in the organization of such a team. It
is probable that some Stanford men
