"It would he possible for Ilurbank to
breed a physically superior group of
human beings just as he developed other
superior living things." said Dr. David
Starr Jordan in- a lecture on "evolution
of man" yesterday, "Wit in the end such
a scheme would defeat its own purpose,
for the two greatest qualities of men
and women, individual initiative, and ro
mantic love, would be stricken out in
the process."
Dr. Jordan pointed out that all men
are not created equal, for "the gifts of
heredity arc controlling. The gates of
gift are closed at birth.' From that lime
on man may become only what he can
make of the qualities he already has.
These qualities savor of capacity, ability,
instinct, and potentiality, rather than of
any accomplishments developed by any
particular ancestor.
"Feeble-minded people should be seg
regated from the rest of the race." Dr.
Jordan believes, for such persons leave
only feeble-minded offsprings. It would
be cheaper to keep them all at the Palace
Hotel than to allow them at large in the
nation. Criminals and undesirables come
largely from these classes.
"The last cost of war lies in loss of
the most capable men Dr. Jordan stated.
More than 1(X),000 university men, men
tally and physically superior, were lost
in the world conflict, and in their place
are 150,000 inhabitants in the slums of
London who were mentally and phy
sically unfit for service. The effect will
of course be noticed in the lowering of
the next generation."
