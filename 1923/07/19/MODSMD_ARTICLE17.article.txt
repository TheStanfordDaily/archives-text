# A 						GOOD BET OVERLOOKED
## 
### 
Heretofore it has been the practice of the Stanford Physical Education
Department to conduct a summer school for coaches and high school
instructors. Despite the fact that there are this quarter coaches of
reputation and quality available to a greater extent than at any time since
the return of American football, there is no school this summer.
Old alumni members of the University who have visited the campus
this quarter have been more impressed with this fact, and obviously
unfavorably so, than with any particular factor about Stanford at this
time. A former track captain spent an hour the other day pointing out
to the editor the several great ways in which we are losing, and in which
California is gaining, through the abolishing of our coaching school.
Several hundred men who coach and instruct high school students
throughout the state will leave Berkeley at the end of this quarter en
thused with Andy Smith ideas of football, with Walter Christie's dope
on track, with the* general system of education at the state university, and
with a more or less strong determination or jit least a willingness to send
the men they will teach later to the University of California. With such
known and able leaders as Andy Kerr, R. L. Templeton, Harry Maloney,
Ernie Brandsten, C. E. Thornhill. Duffy Seay, and "Husky" Hunt, on the
staff of a Stanford summer school, a great number of the coaches would
be at Stanford, for a great many preferred to come here when the staff
was far less complete and attractive.
The Board of Athletic Control cannot be charged with the mistake- It
merely engages the coaches to handle the games. It incidentally makes
them available for the summer coaching staff, if the Department of
Physical Education chooses to conduct the school.
liUSTER KEATON'S "BOAT" is far from the worst of a lot of
comedies we have seen. Kcaton isn't exactly a graduate of Annapolis.
I>ut his methods are interesting. We are not getting a percentage of the
gate, nor even a salary as publicity agent, but we can yet conscientiously
recommend "The Boat." The profits of the show and dance tomorrow
night go to a worthy organization which needs them.
READERS OF THIS column may be relieved to know that Tom Irwin,
editor of Volume 62 of the Daily Palo Alto, will assume half-responsibility
for the summer edition beginning the next issue.
THE FIRST editorial above is another reprint from Volume 59 which
may be pertinent still.

Several hundred men who coach and instruct high school students
throughout the state will leave Berkeley at the end of this quarter en
thused with Andy Smith ideas of football, with Walter Christie's dope
on track, with the* general system of education at the state university, and
with a more or less strong determination or jit least a willingness to send
the men they will teach later to the University of California. With such
known and able leaders as Andy Kerr, R. L. Templeton, Harry Maloney,
Ernie Brandsten, C. E. Thornhill. Duffy Seay, and "Husky" Hunt, on the
staff of a Stanford summer school, a great number of the coaches would
be at Stanford, for a great many preferred to come here when the staff
was far less complete and attractive.
The Board of Athletic Control cannot be charged with the mistake- It
merely engages the coaches to handle the games. It incidentally makes
them available for the summer coaching staff, if the Department of
Physical Education chooses to conduct the school.
liUSTER KEATON'S "BOAT" is far from the worst of a lot of
comedies we have seen. Kcaton isn't exactly a graduate of Annapolis.
I>ut his methods are interesting. We are not getting a percentage of the
gate, nor even a salary as publicity agent, but we can yet conscientiously
recommend "The Boat." The profits of the show and dance tomorrow
night go to a worthy organization which needs them.
READERS OF THIS column may be relieved to know that Tom Irwin,
editor of Volume 62 of the Daily Palo Alto, will assume half-responsibility
for the summer edition beginning the next issue.
THE FIRST editorial above is another reprint from Volume 59 which
may be pertinent still.
