## 
### 
The University lias just published
the second volume in the new Stanford
Language and Literature series. "Apol
lonius of Tyana," a translation from
the old Greek by Charles P. Eells, a
trustee of the University and a prac
ticing lawyer of San Francisco.
The book has been translated very
rarely into English, once in the year
111, the second time in the year 1912
by the English scholar Conybeare. and
the third time in 1923 by Mr. Eells.
Mr. Eells' translation is a good one
in that it is readable, does not indeed
appear as a translation, and also as
being faithful to the original. It is not
perhaps as good a translation from
the merely literary point of view as
that of Conybeare but it is an exceed
ingly creditable piece of work and all
the more so considering that Mr. Eells
is not a professional scholar.
