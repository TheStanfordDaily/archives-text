# TWO COMEDIES ON TOMORROW'S CAMPUS MOVIE PROGRAM
## Keaton Will Sail His Best "Boat"â€”Kyne Deals With Problems of Marriage 
### H.A. F 
By special arrangement with San
Francisco moving picture syndicates,
English Club will offer a well-balanced
program in the Assembly Hall tomor
row evening, consisting of three pic
tures, including two of the most ex
pensive and unquestionably the best
comedies produced this year. Wher
ever Peter B. Kyne's "Brothers Under
the Skin" or Buster Keaton in "The
Boat" have been previously exhibited,
it has been planned to show them again
due to their universal popularity.
There is nothing uncertain about the
mirth-provoking qualities of either of
them.
Peter B. Kyne proves conclusively
that when it comes to marriage and
children that all men are "brothers
under the skin." facing the same prob
lems and solving them in the same
way, irrespective of varying social po
sitions, clubs, wives, and relations. The
picture is more funny and more true
to life than might even be expected of
the creator of Cappy Ricks.
Fox is going to express a first-run
reel of newsettes before showing in
San Francisco, and coupled with the
second leading attraction scheduled
(Buster Keaton), will complete a nine
reel program. C. W. Midgeley will have
charge of the musical accompaniment.
It would have been impossible to
show these pictures on the same bill
for twenty-five cents, had it not been
for the courtesy of the moving picture
in San Francisco and the
managers of the Palo Alto theaters
who agreed to a campus showing at a
nominal price. As scheduled, the pro
gram is first-class comedy from start
to finish.
The show will start promptly at
7: HO and immediately afterwards the
new Grinstead-Nathanson five-piece
combination will provide the music for
a dance in the Women's Clubhouse.
