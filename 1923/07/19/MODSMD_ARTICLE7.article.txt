# THIRD CONFERENCE OF CIVIC LEADERS IS SET FOR JULY 29
## Professor E.A. Cottrell to Conduct Annual School for Commercial Secretaries 
### 
Stanford University and the Cali
fornia Association of Commercial Sec
retaries, cooperating to carry on the
annual summer school for all of those
interested in the development of com
munity work, announce that the Third
Annual Conference on Community
Leadership will be held here July 29
to August 4.
The school is under the direction of
Professor Edwin A. Cottrell of Stan
ford University, who has been in
charge of the arrangements for this
school for the last two years and was
a lecturer in the national school at
Northwestern University last summer.
The committee on arrangements
consists of C. P. Bayer of Los Angeles,
J. H. Blackmore of San Francisco, N.
B. Courteney of San Francisco, C. S.
Knight, formerly of Reno. Nevada, and
H. Welch of Phoenix, Arizona. The
committee on program, consisting of
twelve of the secretaries of the more
important cities of California, is pre
paring the work which will be pre
sented at the school.
It is planned to have the school di
vided into groups of students arranged
according to the amount of time de
voted to study in previous schools.
This plan will lead to regular graded
courses for secretaries, who will re
ceive certificates of completion upon
the passage of satisfactory examina
tions.
It is believed by those in charge of
the school that this will be the first
step in the recognition of thorough
academic instruction for the funda
mentals of secretarial work. The in
struction which has been planned is
divided into four classes: First, or
ganization problems; second, business
activities; third, social activities; and
fourth, political activities. At the re
cent meeting of the National Associa
tion of Commercial Secretaries in New
York, it was planned to consolidate
and re-edit, the manuals which have
been used in previous schools. It is
proposed to have these manuals bound
in such form that they may be used as
texts and discussion outlines in the
schools and be of especial value to the
secretary in his community work.
Experience has led those in charge
of the school to divide the time into
longer periods for discussion groups.
The program plans for two-hour
periods, which will be led by someone
who is a specialist in the particular
subject, followed by a discussion of
ail those who sign for that particular
group. The second type of discussion
will be that which will take place at
the luncheon hour. This will be led by
one of the speakers of the day. who
will discuss problems which have
arisen in his talk during the time in
which lunch is being served.
A third opportunity for discussion
is provided in the evening period,
which will be devoted to a smoker and
give opportunity for informal discus
sions of some of the points which have
arisen during the day. One hour each
day has been set aside for an assembly
period at which the biggest man to be
obtained will give a talk on some par
ticular subject of interest. It is also
planned to give a special talk during

the dinner hour in the evening.
The California Association of Com
mercial Secretaries in sponsoring this
school hopes to extend the scope of its
activities to all of the Western States.
| Invitations will bo sent to all chamber
l of commerce secretaries and others in
terested in community development!
whose names can be secured by the j
University.
It is hoped that anyone interested in
work of this sort will plan to spend
as much time as possible during the'
week at the school.

The tentative program plans for dis
cussion groups in the organization and
re-organization of chambers of com
merce, financing of community enter
prises, city planning, municipal char
ters, public health, municipal publicity,
public speaking, fairs and exhibitions,
motion pictures, foreign and retail
trade, credit bureaus, luncheon clubs,
industrial development, harbor devel
opment, psychology, referenda, the
secretary's relation to the press and
to the public, civic activities, and co
