# Dr. Jordan Will Meet Students Tonight
## 
### 
Tonight at 7:'30, in his home, Dr.
Jordan will speak to students on "The
Case at Amherst." The case in ques
tion is the recent resignation of T)r.
Meiklejohn as president of Amherst
College. The resignation was demand
ed by the board of regents, and as a
consequence, twelve students refused
to accept diplomas from that univer
sity. This question has aroused much
interest, especially in connection with
Upton Sinclair's accusations in "The
Goose Step."
