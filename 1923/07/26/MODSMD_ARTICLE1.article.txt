# CARDS HAVE EIGHT HARD CONTESTS ON FOOTBALL SCHEDULE
## Four Games With Conference Teams; Only Half of Total Will Be Played at Home 
### 
Stanford's final and complete grid
schedule for the 1923 football season
was announced at the Graduate Mana
ger's office this morning, showing four
Pacific Coast Conference and four non
conference games for the Cardinals
under Coach Kerr.
Here is the complete line-up:
October 6, Nevada at Stanford.
October 13, Santa Clara at Stanford.
October 20, Occidental at Los An
geles.
October 27, U. S. C. at Los Angeles.
November 3, Olympic Club at Stan
ford.
November 10, Oregon at Portland.
November 17, Idaho at Stanford.
November 24. California at Berkeley.
Two teams on the 1922 schedule are
absent from the above lineup, the St.
Mary's elevent and the University of
Washington team. The Occidental Col
lege organization makes its first ap
pearance on a Stanford program.
The Cardinals should find Nevada a
fine team with which to start the sea
son, as the Reno team has been much
weakened. Santa Clara, however, the
following week, is a different proposi
tion, and as this eleven comes to the
Cardinal campus each year determined
to slip one over on the Reds, which
in early season they sometimes find
almost possible. Their best opportun
ity of several years comes in the fall,
but they will find Stanford a much
improved team.
Occidental College at Los Angeles
should not trouble Coach Kerr's outfit
to any great extent, and this is well,
for the following Saturday at the same
city Stanford meets a real test in
IT. S. C. The Trojans have great ma
terial, and an excellent coach. Their
eleven will be much stronger than last
season, when they trimmed Stanford
fi-0. Stanford will also be far stronger
than last season, and no one would
attempt to pick the winner.
On November 3 Coach Kerr will
have an opportunity to avenge himself
for the defeat handed down by Bob
Evans at the first of the 1922 schedule.
Evans in all probability will have a
more powerful team than before, in
fact he really hopes to beat California
as well as Stanford, and this contest
also should be a great battle.
November 10 the Cardinals journey
to Portland. Oregon may or may not
have a strong team.
