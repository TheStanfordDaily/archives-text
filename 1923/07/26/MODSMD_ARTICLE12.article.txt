"Contrasting Beliefs of English and
American Teachers" will be the subject
of a lecture Tuesday evening, July 31, at
7:30 p. m. in the Little Theater. N The
speaker will he Professor John Adams of
the University of London, where he has
been professor of education since 1902.
lii addition he has held many adminis
trate positions in education in Great
Britain.
Professor Adams is in the United
States a? ;f delegate to the recent meet
ing of the National Education Associa
tion in Oakland and San Francisco. He
formerly taught during the winter at the
Southern Branch of the University of
California, and during the present sum
mer is a member of the faculty at Berk
eley. At one time he was head of the
Educational Institute of Scotland. He is
now retiring from the directorship of the
London Day Training College which he
has held for some time.
Professor Adams is generally looked
upon in England as one of the most com
petent educational authorities, and he is
a noted writer on educational subjects.
With the popularity of the school of edu
cation during the summer quarter, and
the enrollment of teachers, this
lecture should attract more than a passing
interest.
