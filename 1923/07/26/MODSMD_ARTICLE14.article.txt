# NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT

Football will soon be in print again in many of the bigger newspapers.
Nine-tenths of all that is seen will be propaganda from one or another
university. It will mean very little, but fans should know how to
interpret it. All which emanates from (-'alifornia will ha\e the tone that
Stanford has absolutely 110 chance against Berkeley, either this season,
or at any other time for a hundred years to come. Andy Smith will
appear so firmly entrenched that the only possible chance prep school
athletes will ever have to be a member of a winning team will be to go
to California. After registration opens at the two universities the tone
will change, but until this time it will remain much as indicated above.
Stanford followers need not worry about it. The California-Stanford
game enlists great natural interest. It cannot be hurt by the above
'line" which is issued for the benefit of prep stars.
From the north will come the astounding dope that Washington is
the only team which has a chance to defeat California, and that the
"huskies" were thirty points better than Stanford last season despite
they were able to win only by one or two points with the most unusual
breaks. From the south there is another slant on the football season
forthcoming, not quite as violent as the two above.
No great quantities'of material will go out from Stanford. What
there is will indicate no more than that Coach Kerr has an improved
squad, with which Stanford will do the best she can. Kerr isn't "expect
ing to'beat" any team. He is laying back, preparing the best foundation
possible, and when the time comes lie will be there with all the strength
he can muster. This may or may not be enough to win all the games
this season, but it will be more than the Cardinals have shown for three
years.
