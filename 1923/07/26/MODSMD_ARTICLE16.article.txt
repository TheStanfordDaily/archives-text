# EVOLUTION AND CORRESPONDENTS

The campus correspondent comes in for an unusual share of criticism
every now and then when some story unfavorable to Stanford appears in
print. The public knows little of the spirit with which the usual corre
spondent undertakes his daily work, and they know not a great deal of the
large amount of favorable matter which is printed concerning the Univer
sity through his efforts alone. The following "cheer" from the Palo Alto
Times, therefore, may be of interest:
"Inspired largely by the recent utterances of William Jennings Bryan
against acceptance of the theory of evolution, and aided by the concomitant
of professional replies and newspaper ridicule, there has been a decided
renaissance of interest in the subject of the origin of man. I lie word
volution has become revitalized with a magic appeal to city editors, who
foresee "good copy",in any public occasion where even mention of the
subject may be given prominence.
When it was announced a few days ago that Dr. David Starr Jordan
was to give a series of three lectures at Stanford University on evolution,
it was not a surprise to the campus newspaper correspondents when they
got their orders from the "city desks" in San Francisco to send up reports
of the lectures for publication.
There was nothing sensational or newsy in any respect in the lectures.
No new discoveries or new theories were advanced. Bryan wasn't even
mntioned. Dr. Jordan has been giving lectures on evolution since 1879.
He has given them repeatedly at Stanford, year after year, always to new
classes, to be sure, but from the news-reading standpoint the lectures are
not technically news, but merely part of the routine performance of educa
tional work. From the "city desk" standpoint, this week's series was a
disappointment. But from the standpoint of enlightenment they were
satisfactory.
The campus correspondents were most meticulous in sending up their
"stuff" on the lectures. Knowing the metropolitan journalistic preference
for sensation rather than sense, the campus reporters feared to truth their
city editors with any of the touches of humor with which Dr. Jordan
invariably flavors his addresses, for fear the main thread of the talk would
Ik* sacrificed for jests that would be treated seriously in order to make a
jazzier lead and a more intriguing headlines. The campus correspondents
were influenced in their handling of the copy not only by ethical considera
tions, but also by personal regard for Dr. Jordan and bv loyalty to the
University."

He has given them repeatedly at Stanford, year after year, always to new
classes, to be sure, but from the news-reading standpoint the lectures are
not technically news, but merely part of the routine performance of educa
tional work. From the "city desk" standpoint, this week's series was a
disappointment. But from the standpoint of enlightenment they were
satisfactory.
The campus correspondents were most meticulous in sending up their
"stuff" on the lectures. Knowing the metropolitan journalistic preference
for sensation rather than sense, the campus reporters feared to truth their
city editors with any of the touches of humor with which Dr. Jordan
invariably flavors his addresses, for fear the main thread of the talk would
Ik* sacrificed for jests that would be treated seriously in order to make a
jazzier lead and a more intriguing headlines. The campus correspondents
were influenced in their handling of the copy not only by ethical considera
tions, but also by personal regard for Dr. Jordan and bv loyalty to the
University."
