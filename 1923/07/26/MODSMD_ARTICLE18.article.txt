Monday evening, while your humble
scribe was trying to buckle down to
some study after an evening's recrea
tion in the library, he heard the soft
tingle of a banjo, the low stum of a
ukalelee, and melodious voices singing
beaueous tunes. Looking out of his
beauteous tunes. Looking out of his
outlines of a machine full of girls,
parked in front of the house, from
which these pleasing sounds seemed
to emanate. The song ceased, but upon
cries of "Encore" the obliging serenad
ers complied with another number. It
was grand. Their voices melted into
the soft summer evening, on Salva
tierra; it made you feel happy and
glad, and glow all over with a sense of
good-fellowship. That feeling, master
ing some of the auditors, they craved
closer acquaintanceship with these
damsels of the heaven-like voices.
They roamed out on the lawn but,
alack and alas, it was not to be so, for
the machine started, speeded up. and
vanished like a spirit in the mist. In
quiry next day revealed the fact that
several of the houses were favored
by this softly-singing vision. Whoever
they were, they were good, and we do
wish that th?y would come back some
time in the near future. Soft music
and glimmering stars always has been
our favorite after-dinner sport.
