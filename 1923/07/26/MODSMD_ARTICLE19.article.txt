AWAITING SHIPMENT
The sun has gone down in the/ west
And daylight is fleeting away
Darkness has settled upon us because
We have no bananas today.
Our sweethearts have written us letters
Of a one-time regard gone astray
No doubt these affections were stolen
because
We have no bananas today.
Oh where are the smiles of tomorrow?
They are tears of regret we must say
Sorrow is visited on us because
We have no bananas today.
Behold the sheik and the vampire.
Their gold is transmuted to clay;
Their climactic clinch is ended because
They have no bananas today.

Oh bring back those nice ripe bananas.
The irnit of the Wop and the Greek.
So reposing in hope, we'll slip you the
dope
That we'll have some bananas next week.

It strikes Cabbages, who incidentally
lays no claim to the banana family tree,
that where there is such a great demand
there must be a diminished supply. There
is not a housewife in America today who
fails to ask for her bananas. Naturally
the fruit peddlers are forced to admit
that they are just out.

REWARD!
Handsome leather-lined abbreviation
with highly polished punctuation marks
will be awarded to the first inventor or
discoverer of a proper and suitable sub
stitute for bananas. This must not be a
fruitless attempt.
