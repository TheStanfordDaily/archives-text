# GREAT WORK OF PROFESSOR AGASSIZ TOLD BY JORDAN
## 
### 
, Dr. David Starr Jordan spoke yester
day afternoon at the Stanford Little The
| ater of "Louis Agassiz, the greatest
! teacher I have ever known," who was
| born in West Switzerland in 1807, and
j who became during the following sev
enty years the foremost naturalist and
the most important instructor in the art
of teaching truth in the world.
The first great work of Agassiz, after
graduating from the University at Mu
nich, was with the glaciers in Switzer
land about which he discovered many im
j portant new facts. He was the first to
| learn the habits of large moving bodies
lof ice, and to develop these facts in a
way that permitted the discovery of great
| truths about glaciers of former times
which once covered large parts of what
iarc now temperate countries.
Professor Agassiz later went to Har
vard University, "in a spirit of curiosity
and adventure," where he remained be
cause he could teach and conduct re
search as he pleased.
Agassiz's greatest word was in the
I development of modern teachings. He be
llieved in instructing from nature, in
sending the pupil after the facts himself,
i rather than in instruction in theory.
Agassiz would do often as he did in the
j case of a student of butterflies, direct a
| year of study of some unfamiliar fish,
j requiring him of his own resources to
; learn all the qualities of the particular
j specimen, which the student could get
j together in a full year's effort. After
I learning for himself how to find out
truths, the student could better conduct
research along the lines about which he
was familiar. "He taught students," said
Dr. Jordan, "to do their own thinking, the
only usciul purpose which a teacher may
serve. It isn't important to teach theory.
Theory may be manufactured from
knowledge of facts, but knowledge can
never be learned from theory."
Agassiz's work lead the establishing of

modern teaching in many other lines
than his own, according to Dr. Jordan,
who pointed to the modern case system in
law as one definite example.
In 1873 Professor Agassiz called to
gether at Pentikese Island fifty natural
ists and teachers, among whom Dr. Jor
dan was the youngest. This was the first
"summer school" in the world, and the
first seaside laboratory as well. Here
after several months' study Agassiz sent
his pupils away "into the world where
science is taught from books, with a plea
that they teach by bringing students into

direct contact with the truth itself, that
might may be able to learn things as they
actually are."
Agassiz died the following December.
Yesterday was the fifteenth anniver
sary of the world's first great summer
school, and Dr. Jordan, who was unable
to attend the exercises in Boston in honor
of the great teacher where he was asked
to speak, observed the day in a talk to
those at Stanford.
"At Pentikese." said Dr. Jordan,
"Agassiz taught fifty teachers, and these
have taught others, so that now it is al

most impossible to attend any great uni
versity and escape the effect of his work.
Many of the original fifty have become
great leaders themselves, and all have
passed the work on. "Many summer
schools and seaside laboratories have fol
lowed the work begun by Agassiz. among
them the government station at Woods
Hole, a famous school at Naples, and
third greatest the Stanford station at
Pacific Grove. All follow closely the
ideas of the original founder, who often
said "If you study nature from books,
you are likely to be unable to find her

when you go out of doors." In all things
lie believed in teaching from facts.

school, and Dr. Jordan, who was unable
to attend the exercises in Boston in honor
of the great teacher where he was asked
to speak, observed the day in a talk to
those at Stanford.
"At Pentikese." said Dr. Jordan,
"Agassiz taught fifty teachers, and these
have taught others, so that now it is al

most impossible to attend any great uni
versity and escape the effect of his work.
Many of the original fifty have become
great leaders themselves, and all have
passed the work on. "Many summer
schools and seaside laboratories have fol
lowed the work begun by Agassiz. among
them the government station at Woods
Hole, a famous school at Naples, and
third greatest the Stanford station at
Pacific Grove. All follow closely the
ideas of the original founder, who often
said "If you study nature from books,
you are likely to be unable to find her

when you go out of doors." In all things
lie believed in teaching from facts.
, Dr. David Starr Jordan spoke yester
day afternoon at the Stanford Little The
| ater of "Louis Agassiz, the greatest
! teacher I have ever known," who was
| born in West Switzerland in 1807, and
j who became during the following sev
enty years the foremost naturalist and
the most important instructor in the art
of teaching truth in the world.
The first great work of Agassiz, after
graduating from the University at Mu
nich, was with the glaciers in Switzer
land about which he discovered many im
j portant new facts. He was the first to
| learn the habits of large moving bodies
lof ice, and to develop these facts in a
way that permitted the discovery of great
| truths about glaciers of former times
which once covered large parts of what
iarc now temperate countries.
Professor Agassiz later went to Har
vard University, "in a spirit of curiosity
and adventure," where he remained be
cause he could teach and conduct re
search as he pleased.
Agassiz's greatest word was in the
I development of modern teachings. He be
llieved in instructing from nature, in
sending the pupil after the facts himself,
i rather than in instruction in theory.
Agassiz would do often as he did in the
j case of a student of butterflies, direct a
| year of study of some unfamiliar fish,
j requiring him of his own resources to
; learn all the qualities of the particular
j specimen, which the student could get
j together in a full year's effort. After
I learning for himself how to find out
truths, the student could better conduct
research along the lines about which he
was familiar. "He taught students," said
Dr. Jordan, "to do their own thinking, the
only usciul purpose which a teacher may
serve. It isn't important to teach theory.
Theory may be manufactured from
knowledge of facts, but knowledge can
never be learned from theory."
Agassiz's work lead the establishing of

modern teaching in many other lines
than his own, according to Dr. Jordan,
who pointed to the modern case system in
law as one definite example.
In 1873 Professor Agassiz called to
gether at Pentikese Island fifty natural
ists and teachers, among whom Dr. Jor
dan was the youngest. This was the first
"summer school" in the world, and the
first seaside laboratory as well. Here
after several months' study Agassiz sent
his pupils away "into the world where
science is taught from books, with a plea
that they teach by bringing students into

direct contact with the truth itself, that
might may be able to learn things as they
actually are."
Agassiz died the following December.
