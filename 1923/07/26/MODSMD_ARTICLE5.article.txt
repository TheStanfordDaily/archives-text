j 2G. Sanges has changed his plans in
regard to coming to the coast, being
prevented by bouts arranged in
Newark, New Jersey, New Orleans,
and Chicago,
Maloney has been in training for
] the proposed bout, but as he is leaving
the University for the second half of
the summer quarter be will not be able
to continue training. In case Sanges
should be able to come to San Fran

, work as associate director of physical
education. This will make it impossible
for him to engage in the match, so he
