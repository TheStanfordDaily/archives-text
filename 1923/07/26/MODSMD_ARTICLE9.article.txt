# GERMANY LOOKS TO AMERICA FOR AID SAYS DR.H. KRAUS

"Germany iq looking to America
more than to any nation in the world
for teaching in the lessons of democ
racy, for the advantage of her experi

Kraus, member of the council of the
city of Cologne, in a talk to a Stanford
audience at the Little Theatre yester
day afternoon. Miss Kraus "came to
America to take back to Germany the
encouragement and good will of a
happy and normal democracy."
"All Germany today is in a very un
stable condition," Dr. Kraus stated.
"Industry is continually closing down
and breaking up. Misery everywhere
follows the depreciation of the mark.
No one undertakes or plans for days to
follow, for no one has any feeling of
security. There is no certainty that
plans made today will ever be allowed
to develop or to mature —they are
likely to be at once interrupted. As a
result a majority of the people are just
existing."
All of which, Dr. Kraus believes,
makes it extremely difficult to get a
democratic state into working order.
There is no enthusiasm.

employes as equals are said to do great

affairs are such as to discourage them
further. These domestic regulations
are the only means by which the peo
ple may' be shown that "Germany is
bent on building up a state of demo
cracy and equality," and has been
since the revolution.
Hope Lies in Youth
The one hope for the nation, Dr.
Kraus pointed out, lies in the younger
generation, a small minority as op
posed to the great numbers of dis
couraged people, who have found ways
to get away from parents and families
who are fretting about their daily
bread, and to meet among themselves
to find out if there is not some reason
for the depression, and if there is not
some way to change it. These young
