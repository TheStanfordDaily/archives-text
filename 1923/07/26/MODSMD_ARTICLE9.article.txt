# GERMANY LOOKS TO AMERICA FOR AID SAYS DR.H. KRAUS

"Germany iq looking to America
more than to any nation in the world
for teaching in the lessons of democ
racy, for the advantage of her experi
ence and for methods," said Dr. Hertha
Kraus, member of the council of the
city of Cologne, in a talk to a Stanford
audience at the Little Theatre yester
day afternoon. Miss Kraus "came to
America to take back to Germany the
encouragement and good will of a
happy and normal democracy."
"All Germany today is in a very un
stable condition," Dr. Kraus stated.
"Industry is continually closing down
and breaking up. Misery everywhere
follows the depreciation of the mark.
No one undertakes or plans for days to
follow, for no one has any feeling of
security. There is no certainty that
plans made today will ever be allowed
to develop or to mature â€”they are
likely to be at once interrupted. As a
result a majority of the people are just
existing."
All of which, Dr. Kraus believes,
makes it extremely difficult to get a
democratic state into working order.
There is no enthusiasm.
Praises Labor Laws
In labor legislation Germany has
gone ahead, according to Dr. Kraus,
and regulations treating employers and
employes as equals are said to do great
good. In this domestic legislation only
can the government give any encour
agement to the people, since foreign
affairs are such as to discourage them
further. These domestic regulations
are the only means by which the peo
ple may' be shown that "Germany is
bent on building up a state of demo
cracy and equality," and has been
since the revolution.
Hope Lies in Youth
The one hope for the nation, Dr.
Kraus pointed out, lies in the younger
generation, a small minority as op
posed to the great numbers of dis
couraged people, who have found ways
to get away from parents and families
who are fretting about their daily
bread, and to meet among themselves
to find out if there is not some reason
for the depression, and if there is not
some way to change it. These young
people meet around campfires in the
woods, and at all sorts of places, where
they are learning and coming to be
lieve in the possibilities of good will.
They are doing a great deal to uplift
Germany, and, in fact, present about
the only hopeful sign on the present
horizon.
Looks to America
Following the war Miss Kraus said
that the only helpful and hopeful en
couragement from the outside world
came from America. The American So
ciety of Friends, immediately after the
armistice, sent supplies into Germany,
and established an organization to feed
from one-half to one million needy
people each day, with a proclaimed
purpose of bringing good will alone.
Germans were suspicious, and ex
pected to find other motives behind
this very business-like and efficient
organization, but investigation re
vealed that its purposes were just
those stated. "It was hard for the Ger
man people to understand." The work
of the American Friends has done,
more than anything else to change the
views of German people, and to make
them believe there is such a force as
good will in the world.
It has caused Germany, she said, to
look to America more than to any
country, not for supplies, but for in
formation, ideas, and the dependable
lessons of her experience.
