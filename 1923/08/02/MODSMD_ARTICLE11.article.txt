"The fundamental difference between
the English and Americans in relation
to education in general is the great
interest shown by Americans in the
theory of education," said Dr. John
Adams of London University, in a lec
ture Tuesday night at the Little Thea
tre. "Americans are willing to talk
about theory and trvout new things
while the English will not try novel
ties.
Other differences given by Dr.
Adams were the larger number of
women teachers in this country, the
greater permanence of English teach
ers. the more rigorous discipline in
English schools, the centralization in
the United States and the greater de
velopment of individualism here.
The speaker expressed the belief
that the aim of education in the two
countries is different. The English are
concerned, he said, with self-realiza
tion, while the Americans strive more
for self-expression.
"Sympathy is the foundation of the
real teacher," according to Dr. Adams.
Statistics collected from one hundred
American school superintendents were
quoted to show the ten qualities ne
cessary for a successful teacher to be
in order of importance. Sympathy, per
sonal appearance, address, sincerity,
optimism, enthusiasm, scholarship, vi
tality, fairness, and reserve. When
these qualities were taken in the order
of their power to obtain appointment,
address become the most important,
with personal appearance second. Sym
pathy dropped to eighth place and
scholarship was last.
A group of English teachers, he said,
gave sympathy as the most important
quality, with patience second and tact
third. Scholarship followed this and
personality was eighth on the list. A
group of American teachers, on the
other hand, placed personality first,
scholarship second, and put sympathy
in third place.
The speaker described the ideal
teacher as one with an attitude of
vicariousness, a willingness to be for
gotten, and ability to invigorate with
life the subject being taught.
