# BRITISH AND FRENCH DO NOT CO-OPERATE

"hug-land and France co-operate with
110 better results in Syria and Palestine
than in the rest of Europe," Prof. Dana
C. Munro of Princeton told an audience
in the Stanford Assembly hall Friday
afternoon. "The lack of harmony," he
added, "is responsible for most of the
trouble in these two states. It is noticed
in many instance, as in the handling of
fugitives from justice. Officers of neither
country will aid those of the other in
making arrests, and the criminal who
once gets into territory other than that
in which the offense was committed is
safe. News now coming from this region
is alarming, and it may be so demanding
that the British and French will get to
gether and save Europe, which is the
only possible hope as long as America
refuses to take a part." The British hold
the present mandate over Palestine, while
Syria is governed by the French.
