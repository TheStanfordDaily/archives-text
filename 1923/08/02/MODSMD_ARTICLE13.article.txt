# BRANNER HALL WILL NOT BE COMPLETED BY FALL QUARTER
## Shortage of Skilled Labor Makes Opening of Building By October 1st Impossible 
### 
Contrary to expectations, Branner
Hall, the second of the new dormi
tories being built by the University,
will not be finished in time for occupa
tion by students during the first part
of the fall quarter. As a result, a por
tion of Encina Hall will be reserved
for those students who had made reser
vations in Branner and the plan to
make Encina a strictly freshman dor
mitory will have to be postponed un
til the completion of the new building.
Shortage of skilled labor has resulted
in a slowing up of the construction
schedule, although, in spite of these
difficulties, Toyon Hall, the gift of the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control,
will be completed in time for occupa
tion on October 1.
It is planned at the present time to
room students who had reservations
in Branner in a segregated portion of
Encina, probably the upper floors,
leaving the freshmen and their spon
sors to themselves in the basement
and the lower stories. Encina will prob
ably be run by a freshman administra
tion organized and supervised by the
upperclass sponsors appointed by the
University authorities.
The failure to complete Branner will
in no wise complicate the housing
situation as might be expected. En
cina will probably be more crowded
than it was at the close of the spring
quarter but will not be compelled to
accommodate as many as has been the
custom in the fall quarter in spite of
the fact that the rule requiring fresh
men to live one year in a dormitory
will be in operation this fall for the
first time since the war. The overflow
caused by the enforcement of this rule
will be accounted for by the moving
of about 140 upperclassmen into
Toyon.
