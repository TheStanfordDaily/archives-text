# "Stevenson in Samoa" Is Jordan's Subject Thursday
## 
### 
Next Thursday Dr. Jordan will speak
at his home on "Stevenson in Samoa."
Last Thursday Dr. Jordan had in
tended to talk about Stevenson, but
at the eleventh hour he changed the
subject to "Law Not War," which is
the slogan of the Quaker's national war
against war. Dr. Jordan visited
Samoa shortly after Stevenson died
there, and has collected much data
that is unpublished.
Dr. Jordan, being called to Santa
Monica, will not speak at his home to
night.
