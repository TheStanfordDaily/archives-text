# AN EMPTY GYM
## 
### 
The department of physical education during the last college year, in
what was probably an attempt to put athletics at Stanford above reproach
and to make certain that all physical exercise was taken only for the
purpose of physical betterment, abolished gymnasium credit and was
greeted with an unprecedented slump in interest. Dozens of students who
were fitted only for minor sports dropped out of the department and
refused to show their faces except when compelled to do so by official
decree or in order to make up requirements. Major sports, of course,
easily withstood the blow, but the minors really suffered.
Now no doubt it was thought by those in charge that the abolition of
credit would rid the gymnasium of those who took gym work for credit
only. It did. And moreover, the move upset the projected plans to have
the whole male student ody down in the gymnasium working out every
evening, for that was the oft-stated ideal. The result was that everybody
except those working off requirements and actual meml>ers of teams
cleaned out their levkers and took their workouts in private by pummelling
the physical education department in effigy, a worthy but wholly unproduc
tive pastime. It was rumored that the authorities were for a time faint
hearted at this reception but remembering the old adage with regard to the
fair lady, kept a stiff upper lip. The heart is as yet still going strong but
the fair lady is as far out of reach as ever.
Why is it, we are prompted to ask, that credit is no longer given?
It could scarcely be possible that the staff has been so weakened that it is
no longer capable of giving instruction worthy of credit, if this were the
case, recent interrogations regarding the lack of a coaching school this
quarter have l>een well answered. It is certainly to be hoped that this is
untrue. Who knows but that in an early issue of the Daily we may be
able to solve this knotty and cross-grained problem?
