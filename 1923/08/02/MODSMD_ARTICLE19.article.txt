# NEW "CITIZENSHIP"
## 
### 
Certain older students have expressed dissatisfaction with the new
course in "Citizenship" which is to he given next fall. The course for all
freshmen will run throughout three quarters. Lectures by a selected staff
from several departments will he given two or three times a week to a
very large class in the Assembly hall. Smaller discussion groups under
other instructors will meet several times each week.
Many of us at Stanford have carried a traditional hate for any course
in which the instructor with whom the student comes in contact, and who
gives the grades, is another than the one who presents the subject matter
of the course in the first place. And very large classes seem foreign to
the Stanford idea of personal and thorough instruction.
However it is possible that the citizenship course may work out in a
manner that will be entirely satisfactory. In the first place the discussion
groups are not to be placed in the hands of mere student assistants,
really competent instructors are to have charge. It is hoped that men with
real understanding and common sense will lie found for these positions,
men who would themselves be able to handle the course without assistance
from other sources. If this plan is followed, the discussion group and not
the large class lecture will become the important thing, while the assembly
meetings will become more or less supplementary. In the end it might be
that the smaller groups are so successful that the big classes may be
dropped to a place of less comparative importance.
J he writer, as many older students, very much disliked the new
courses when first they were announced. But if they work out along the
above lines, as certain professors in charge believe they may, results should
be commendable. All depends on obtaining the higher type of instructor
for the discussion group. The fact that Professor Edgar E. Robinson has
charge of the new scheme will gain much confidence of the older students
who have given any thought to the course in citizenship.
