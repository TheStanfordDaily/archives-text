# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### 
The reward offered by Cabbages in
the las) issue for a suitable substitute
for bananas is as yet unclaimed. A
gentleman from Napa, or one who at
least has pretensions to that distinc
tion, says he has something in the
shape of bananas, but it is only cucum
bers.
* * *
At any rate we are pleased to note
that recent startling figures on banana
consumption have no bearing on the
mortality of bananas and in fact that
banana consumption is not a disease
peculiar to that fruit. In view of this
new trend, we are inclined to be op
timistic as to the future of the Ameri
can fruit Salad.

The Library
Oftimes called "Liberry." Derivative
meaning "to razz." Full meaning, "to
cline," and Slavonian word "berry,"
meaning "to razz." Full meanting, "to
sit around and razz." Sober meaning
censored.
* * *
Is one of sights of campus. Tourists
never fail it. More polite ones, not
liking to chew indoors, throw their
gum on steps where students may
wade through it on way to classes.
Thus often confused with "Stickey's."
* * *
Has been mistaken for Museum by
tcurista looking at other tourists.
♦ * *
Place where lower classmen say
they are going when they have a date.
Sometimes confused, because of this,
with the lake.
* * *
Must be full of weeds and stickers.
Know this because students have come
home and said they were at library all
evening and had objects in question
all over sweaters.
* * *
Good place to go when you have
nothing else to do. Might find some
one else with nothing to do and do it
together.
* * ♦
MEET YOU THERE AT 9 O'CLOCK.
