# AMERICAN ART OF WORLD APPEAL IS PREDICTED BY BEST
## 
### 
"America has no definite art," said
Adolfo Best-Maugard. director general of
art for Mexico, in speaking to a Stan
ford audience at the Little Theater. Vet,
though he said America is supposed to
he inarti-tic, he believes that a real Amer
ican art will develop in the near future,
and when it comes, that it probably will
he a world art.

"Art in each man is in a state of evolu
tion," Best pointed out. "In some it is
well developed, and in some barely
started." He suggested that the growing
child passes through all the stages of
artistic expression that man has expe
rienced from early pre-historic times until
today, and that the successful teaching of
art to children must depend on a knowl
edge of the development of art through
the. ages, from which the teacher will
know what step next to give the child to
facilitate its expression.
The speaker traced steps in the evolu

tion of art, from the early figures with
rock to the present day. Following rock
figures early man cut an outline from a
flat substance, and in relief made the two
sides of the figure on opposite surfaces
of the flat material. Later he left one
side to tlie imagination and looked at the
figure from the other only. Then he
placed the figures in relief on a wall,
and later, instead of working the surface
of the wall, he found he could shade
much of it. Then he found he could pro
duce the figures by mere outline with
any sort of mark. At this stage of the

evolution outline writing developed. From
this point on man improved the-outline
and shading.
"In Mexico for 30 years we have been
imitators of Europe, without an art of
our own," said Best, "but through a
teaching of the principles and under
standing of the elements of artistic ex
pression. we are developing a creative art
in our country."
Best believes that the proper method of
instructing in art is to take the pupil
progressively through all the stages and

steps found in history. Preferably he
would begin with the child in public
schools, and provide the forms of ex
pression just at the time when the child
is ready. This has been done with great
results in Mexico, according to Best.
He finds that in giving the seven sym
bols of early art and writing to children
who have been brought up to this stage
of expression, that they will make of
these symbols the very same type of har
monious composition found on the walls
of buildings of the early ages.

"America has no definite art," said
Adolfo Best-Maugard. director general of
art for Mexico, in speaking to a Stan
ford audience at the Little Theater. Vet,
though he said America is supposed to
he inarti-tic, he believes that a real Amer
ican art will develop in the near future,
and when it comes, that it probably will
he a world art.

"Art in each man is in a state of evolu
tion," Best pointed out. "In some it is
well developed, and in some barely
started." He suggested that the growing
child passes through all the stages of
artistic expression that man has expe
rienced from early pre-historic times until
today, and that the successful teaching of
art to children must depend on a knowl
edge of the development of art through
the. ages, from which the teacher will
know what step next to give the child to
facilitate its expression.
The speaker traced steps in the evolu

tion of art, from the early figures with
rock to the present day. Following rock
figures early man cut an outline from a
flat substance, and in relief made the two
sides of the figure on opposite surfaces
of the flat material. Later he left one
side to tlie imagination and looked at the
figure from the other only. Then he
placed the figures in relief on a wall,
and later, instead of working the surface
of the wall, he found he could shade
much of it. Then he found he could pro
duce the figures by mere outline with
any sort of mark. At this stage of the

evolution outline writing developed. From
this point on man improved the-outline
and shading.
"In Mexico for 30 years we have been
imitators of Europe, without an art of
our own," said Best, "but through a
teaching of the principles and under
standing of the elements of artistic ex
pression. we are developing a creative art
in our country."
Best believes that the proper method of
instructing in art is to take the pupil
progressively through all the stages and

steps found in history. Preferably he
would begin with the child in public
schools, and provide the forms of ex
pression just at the time when the child
is ready. This has been done with great
results in Mexico, according to Best.
He finds that in giving the seven sym
bols of early art and writing to children
who have been brought up to this stage
of expression, that they will make of
these symbols the very same type of har
monious composition found on the walls
of buildings of the early ages.
