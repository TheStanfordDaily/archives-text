# Need of Teaching Truth Is Outlined by Professor Robinson
## 
### 
Teaching how and why to think, and
not what to think, is the purpose of
"Education for Citizenship," said Prof.
E. E. Robinson of the Stanford depart
ment of history in a talk to the School
of Community Leadership Monday
night. The most important method, in
fact, the only reasonable method, said
Professor Robinson, lies in teaching
actual truth. In any other course "lies
a road to national ruin.
"The chief difficulty we will encoun
ter in an attempt to tell the truth is
that a considerable number of those
interested do not really want the truth,
either because it fits better their con
ception of patriotism or because it
bolsters up their political views. They
give excellent reasons for suppression
or selection, the oftenest heard being
the need of protecting our present ar
rangement of affairs, and of conserv
ing our national faith. It is actually
asserted and believed that it is essen
tial to teach Americanism by selecting
only that which appears to provide a
pleasant, agreeable background.
"Now," said Professor Robinson,
"this is a matter of common sense.
Nothing is more important than de
veloping a sense of the importance of
truth. We stress it in all study. Is there
a greater crime for a teacher, a trus
tee, or parent, than that of telling a
young boy or girl an untruth in the
thought that they will not know any
better, or to be too docile to question?
And in the end how humiliating to us,
and to them. For eventually the truth,
becoming known, damns us and the
whole fabric we have so falsely con
structed."
