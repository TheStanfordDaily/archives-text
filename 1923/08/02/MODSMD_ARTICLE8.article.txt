# WAKENING ORIENT MAY BRING TRADE TO PACIFIC COAST
## 
### 
"Awakening of Oriental consciousness
will make the Pacific Coast the front
door of American trade, and not the
back door that it has been called in the
past," said John Lathrop, city planning
expert, in a talk to members of the
School of Community Leadership Wed
nesday. "But in taking care of this trade,
we must remember that there are but
five seaports on this coast as compared
with 27 on the Atlantic Coast, and the
community here must he planned ac
cordingly."
"We have passed from the period of
preparation to action in city planning,"
said aLthrop. Tie added:
"The man who made the motor truck
has changed the whole aspect of city
planning. Railroads are now begging
other transport companies to take their
short hauling from them, and the truck
is fitted to do this. Now, in city con
struction, it is not distance, but time
which is of the essence. Distribution
centers, location of railroads, and building
of roads must all be considered in rela
tion to the motor truck. And the city
planning goes far beyond municipal lim
its, it must be co-ordinated with entire
state and community planning.
"California has the biggest opportunity
in the American continent to plan and
build a community which will be a world
wide model. The growing population,
wide-awake peoples, climate, and re
sources all point to great development,
which can and should he accomplished
along lines of intelligent planning. Trade
from the Orient is bound to increase, and
in trade I do not mean the dollar sign,
but the sort of thing which brings cab
bages to Mrs. Jones, the very life of
any settlement.
"We learn much of city planning from
Ettrope. Dresden in Germany is one of
the most beautiful, and one of the most
efficiently planned cities in the world. The
waterfront of New York is one of the

most congested in the world, while sev
eral French cities pass many times too
much tonnage per foot waterfront accom
modation with far greater ease. We
should remember convenience and beauty
in building municipal works as well as
construction oi parks."
Lathrop was war correspondent for
the London Times. Since 1914 he has
been director of the American City Bu
reau, and has conducted city planning
exhibits in more than 350 cities. He
intends to make bis home in California.
