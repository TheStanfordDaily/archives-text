# Five New Football Fields Added to Equipment
## 
### 
Five new football fields will be pro
vided on the campus before registra
tion day in October, it was announced
at the Graduate Manager's office this
morning. The total turfs available for
the grid game at Stanford will then
number nine, including the field at the
stadium, a secret practice field, a sec
ond varsity field, a first and second
freshman field, and four additional
fields for the elaborate intramural
schedule of the fall.
The graduate manager, Paul Davis,
believes that Stanford will then have
more football fields than any univer
sity in the country.
