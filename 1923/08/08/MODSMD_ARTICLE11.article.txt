# WHY!

### 
We were never able to understand the reasons, if any were given, for
the abolition of gymnasium credit. Certain petty abuses were vaguely
alluded to, the fact that some men did not do their class work, that some
obtained credit who did not earn it. We can hardly believe anyone could
regard this seriously as a reason for the steps taken. To us it seems wholly
ridiculous that a staff of full grown and intelligent men could not be
organized to handle classes of college students in a way that would take
care of the petty abuses.
The elements of the case for credit seem to be these:
First, is the subject worth teaching for credit? The university en
gages a whole staff of men who have spent their lives in a study of the
subject, to supervise work in the department required of underclassmen.
Why should our own students, who may be so inclined, be given credit
for study of similar work. If underclassmen are required to take gym
work, why should not those who become interested be allowed to continue
the study along advanced and theoretical lines? Of course the subject is
worthy of credit.
The only other question then would seem to be. can the gymnasium
staff" teach it? The query in itself is ridiculous, as the Stanford staff is
one of the best in the United States. There remains only the mere matter
of organization of the department to handle classes in a reasonable manner,
which is up to the department head. If the subject is worthwhile, and the
staff competent, why should not students be given the advantages of credit
for honest work ?
The simple factors above seem to us sufficient to settle the question
in the minds of reasonable people. But other considerations are of im
portance to the student.
The removal of credit made it almost impossible for advanced students
to take advantage of the gymnasium facilities. Upperclassmen always
have their hands full in meeting requirements as to credits. A student
who must make seventeen hours in any given quarter usually cannot find
time for exercise, work at the gymnasium, or study of theory in connec
tion with gym work. 1 lowever. if he is allowed three hours of credit for
physical education, this reduces his load of other academic work to four
teen hours, and he is enabled to take advantage of gymnasium exercise
and study. Credit by the physical education,department was reflected in
the physical condition of a large part of the student body, as it made it
possible for many to engage in the work who otherwise could not have
done so.
Successful soccer, swimming, boxing, and various minor sport teams
have been built around upperclassmen who could not have afforded the
time for other academic pursits had gymnasium credit not been given.
All these teams for the 1923 seasons will be badly crippled if credit is not
restored.
We hope those responsible for the present attitude of the department
of physical education will consider carefully the results of credit removal
before continuing the policy with reference to 1923.
