# RESEARCH
## 
### 
Research is academic term applied
to act of hunting for something nobody
else could find. When man writes trea
tise on finding needle in educational
haystack he gets M.A. or Ph.D. for
meritorious discovery. All first-class in
tellectuals have kit bag full to top of
stray needles and how they were
found. Possession no object. Pursuit
makes searcher happy.

Research used to be confined to bac
teria. bibles, and decayed statutes.
Field now extended to several horizons
with promises of liberal extensions.
Entomologist has conniption fit on dis
covery of bug ancestor. Entomologist
throws two when he finds word root
sprouting. Progenitors of both mean
nothing. Everybody else has found
them.

Prof, assigns student hour or so in
dividual work. Must find npw field.
Somebody said there was nothing new
under sun, hut educators give idea the
ha-ha. Man writes poetry. Later some
body criticizes. New critic critizes
former. Soon have new school of criti
cism. Somebody writes articles on new
school and so on ad infinitum. "Hoo
ray," say profs. "Big juicy field here.
Drive lots of students into new depart
ment."

Student in Econ recently desired re
search work in reasons for banana
shortage in America. Prof turned him
down. Said everybody knew we had
none. Wasn't going to depart from
precedent when it yet remained to
show why we had no Johnny Walker.
All of which caused miffed stude to
transfer to English Department where
he wrote following lyric to tune now
in vogue among American banana
eaters:
Yos. we have no real whiskey.
We have no real whiskey today;
We've gin fizz synthetic
And bootleg pathetic
And all kinds of hooch, and say.
We've got some nice fresh fruity
punches,
Just look at the lunches;
Hut yes, we have no real whiskey.
We have no real whiskey today.
