# ARTISTS CONSIDER BRANNER AND TOYON PLACES OF BEAUTY
## 
### 
Recent visitors to the campus, after
looking over the two new dormitories,
Toyon and Branner, believe that the
buildings are distinctly new and unique
in American architecture. An eminent
art authority who was taken through
Toyon Hall a few days ago declared
that there was nothing finer in new
styles of architecture than features of
the new building, especially in the as
sembly room.
The portion of the building particu
larly attractive to art experts was
largely an architectural experiment
which fortunately has worked out to
the best advantage. The assembly hall,
which occupies all the roofed space to
the rear of the front court and back of
the intersection of the side wings, has
a wide-beamed roof of two stories from
the floor, giving the room a peculiarly
spacious appearance. After the hall is
draped and curtained and ha? been
given the necessary polish and calso
mine, it is believed that it will be one
of Xhe finest gathering spots for stu
dents in any American college.
Toyon Hall will be finished by Octo
ber 1 in time to house the overflow
of students caused by the enforcement
of the old ruling requiring freshmen
to live in a dormitory for one year
before becoming members of a fra
ternity. Branner Hall, however, will
not be completed until late in the
autumn quarter unless labor troubles
are relieved soon.
