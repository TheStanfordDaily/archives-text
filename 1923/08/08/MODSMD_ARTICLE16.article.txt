# DR. TAYLOR SCORES GENTLEMAN FARMER IN ADDRESS HERE

"It must beremembered that the hu
man being can only use so much food
and that excess production can not be
consumed over a. certain margin,"
stated Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, address
ing the chamber of commerce secre
taries Thursday afternoon upon the
general economic phases of food pro
duction, now of local interest. "One
who has the money may buy one book,
or two books, or a thousand, but he
can not consume over 3600 calories of
food daily, no muUer how much money
he has or how much food there may
be available. If a foodstuff is plentiful,
the price drops, and more of it may be
consumed, but since the capacity for
consumption is limited, the lower price
only results in a switch to the use of
that article, at the expense of some
other."
Failure of co-operative farmers to
judge the extent of their market was
given by Dr. Taylor as one factor
which complicates the situation in the
matter of over-supply of foodstuffs."
he said, "securing advantages for its
members, lead to more people desir
ing to engage in that enterprise. Be
yond a certain limit, such addition to
the amount of produce results in over
production, and the price drops, be
cause the glut of foodstuffs can not be
consumed."
Knocking a popular conception into

the discard, Dr. Taylor stated that the
movement from the farm to the city
was one of the hopeful signs. "When
| ever high wages are paid by urban
I industry the movement starts from
the country. The farmers who are the -
least successful, and the people who
are not farmers at heart, begin their
migration." This leads to a strengthen
ing of the agricultural interests, said
Dr. Taylor.
While reports cited by Dr. Taylor
show that between the last two cen
suses there was a drop in the relative
amount of land used for agricultural
purposes compared with the popula
tion increase, this, he believes, is off
set and bettered by increased produc
tion through intensive fanning.
Sudden gluts of production have caused
the great transportation problems of the
country, he states. "The crops, where
there is onecrop production, tend to pile
up, and they can not be readily moved.
Consumption beyond fixed limits is im
possible, and there is a condition resulting
! similar to the present one in the Santa
| Clara valley in the apricot crop."
"Farm production of the state is ma- 1
terially influenced by the so-callid gen
tleman farmer, the absentee landlord," as
Dr. Taylor terms him. In tins when
production is plenty, the effect of the

pouring of produce from these farms up
on the market is to lower the price for
the professional farmer and to glut the
market in many cases. This is somewhat
unfair in a way. as the geiuleman-farmer
can usually breast the lo>ses resulting,
having an independent income, whereas
the professional farmer has not. And in
the time when the supply ard demand for
produce are balanced, the gentleman farm
er reaps the rewards <>112 the game, in
which he is primarily disinterested."
After the death of President Harding
it was decided to cancel all social activ
ities from the program of the School of
Community Leadership for the remainder
of the week. The professional study of
the secretaries and civic workers, how
ever, will continue until the close of the
school, tomorrow evening.
