# Kerr Must Build Strong Reserve to Get Needed Power
## 
### 
Building up an almost entirely new
reserve strength will be the chief prob
lem confronting Coaches Andy Kerr and j
Tiny Thurnhill when they return to the
campus on September 15 to put together
the Stanford grid machine of 1923. It is
upon the question of whether or not a
few ordinary men left from last year's
reserve will be able to show first-string
ability that the football chances of the
Cardinal rests this year. Out of a reserve
of about twenty men there are not more
than eight or ten left, supplemented by
last year's freshmen and men who were
ineligible during the last season. On the
face of things this situation may not
seem particularly alluring to Cardinal
grid fans and yet there is reason to think
that Stanford's chances for a successful
season are almost on a parity with the
other large universities of the Coast. .
The beauty of Kerr's strategy should
be at once apparent this fall when last
year's rookies arc seen running in first
string places. While the press was shout-1
ing great guns and groaning about the j
Cardinal offense. Kerr and Thornhill j
were painstakingly teaching the funda-!
mentals of the Warner system to a group
of men on whom they knew they must
depend sooner or later for most of their
power. And it is a two to one chance
that those same pupils will be seen next
month taking precedent in most cases over
those who failed to receive the same
lessons.
Stanford people have been looking at
workouts ever since Kerr's arrival last j
year and many of them are still wonder- j
ing what the Warner system is and j
wherein is differs from those of other:
coaches. Naturally Andy Kerr is not
playing a system exacting like Glenn j
Warner's favorite, for Warner has none
and teaches none. The Warner system is

J simply a very general style of play actu
ated by a policy that definitely spells one
thing when it has been given the mo
mentum necessary to its weight—power.
Power is the mainspring of the Warner
system. An so last year the Warner
i system was not much in evidence to the
| casual observer. The Card coaches were
busy building up an offensive, the prim
ary essential to a football squad which
| really has power. The first signs of a
definite offensive did not appear until the
Pittsburgh game. The men had to go
through a season of the defensive work
before they were considered thoroughly
j schooled in that department. And in
addition to the desire to do the defensive
work well, the Stanford coaches last
year were confronted with a problem
whose solution was essential to the suc
cess of the Warner style of play. They
had to have a heavy back field. Without
it, there was not much to be seen in the
I way of a Warner attack. Hut all at
| tempts to put in a battering ram in the
position of fullback failed. Light men
such as Cuddeback and Cleveland had to
I finish the year at the key position. In
fact there was not a man in the Card
backfield who came up to the average
weight of ordinary halfbacks. They
were good little men —good for end runs
and passes and an occasional off-tackle
smash, but the heavy line-plunging style
of play was out of their field. This year
but one man of the four regulars re-
I mains—Woodward. Wilcox, Doughty,
| and Cuddeback are among the missing
| and Woodward, worse luck, is the light
| est of the four. Whether or not he is
j used consistently this year depends upon
| whether Campbell takes the quarterback
position.
As to the line, considerable havoc was
in order about Christmas of last year
when Johnston, Douglas, Pheney, and
Houck ceased to be even potential mem
bers of the squad. The graduation of
Captain Dud DeCroot from the moleskins
and the failure of Bob Janssen to return
leaves the stringth of the Cardinal for
wards considerably diminished. But here

■
is where the remants of the old line and i
the remaining reserves will be added to-!
gether to get the sum total of a year's j
coach in g—po we r.
