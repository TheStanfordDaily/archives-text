## 
### 
"One has but to look at the change in
the ideals of business in the past 25 years
to realize that the hope of progress in
| this country is not in fanaticism, hut in
the hard-headed business man, who real
izes that he gains most when he works
with and not against others," said Wig
gjngton E. Creed in a talk to the School
of Community Leadership at Stanford
Friday afternoon.
Creed dwelt at length upon the manner
jin which modern business conditions
made it necessary for one business to
take account of what was happening in
all others, in order to prosper and to
serve. In his company, he stated, "we
have records upon agriculture, on min
ing .upon all industry, which we use and
which we believe are equal to any of
those possessed by the interested activ
ities themselves.
"You secretaries are the members of
a new profession," said Creed. "You
are here to shape the policies of the
i communities in which you serve, to de
jvelop and to advise."
"Before the war the capital for the
j development of California came from
Scotland, England and France, as well as
| from our own people. Now that capital
has been shut off. and there is no imtned-
J iate possibility of a return flow. Cali
fornia needs capital to progress at the
rate that we have kept up in the past
few years. Now. capital is a coldblooded
thing. It does not listen to wonderJul
tales of prospective grandeur, or a trans
formed California; it wants to be safe.
In the proportion that it is secure when
; it is invested here, in that degree will
this most necessary element he available
for progress.
