# KERR MUST FIND SIX NEW PLAYERS FOR'23 GRID TEAM
## Only Five Regulars Remain; Coast Colleges Perked Up Over Stanford's Weakness 
### 
Six new regulars must be found by
Coach Andy Kerr between September 15
and the following month if the Stanford
football squad of 1923 is to fulfill the
promises of the previous season. Out of
a squad of eleven men there remain only
the two guards, a tackle, and an end in
the line and a quarterback in the backtield.
Captain Dud DeGroot, All-Coast center,
leaves bis berth to the care of George
Baker and Bob Hunt. Charlie Johnston
bequeaths the position of tackle to Fred
Loom is, Fred Ludeke, Bill Neill, Red
Potts, and a host of others who will also
be trying to hoist Harry Shipkey out of
his place at the other tackle. As to the
ends, while the 1922 grid will was being
read, Lawson and Janssen were heard to
say that they were not yet dead and were
not so sure about making a gift of their
positions to anybody. However, if the
notary public of education gives the nec
essary orders. Dole, Thomas, Mertz, Mid
dleton, McDermott, and possibly a few
others will be contesting each others
claims.
The weight and speed chart presages a
battle royal from beginning to end in the
backfield. a situation which augurs well
for Kerr's offensive this year. While it
is to be admitted that only one regular
remains from last year's set of backs,
there is still to be found in the rolls the
following list of gentlemen: Captain
"Scotchy" Campbell, Bud Woodward,
Paul Murray, Guy Dennis, Gil Wheat,
and Norman Cleveland. Add to this
group the names of the large and husky
Krtiie Nevers, the not-so-small "Solly"
Solomon, the beefy "Mugs" Mitchell, the
200-pound Jim Kelly, the weighty Dick
Lawson, the wiry Stratton, and a bevy of
minor lights. Subtract two for ineligi
bility and divide by a number necessary to
make eleven and you have the answer to
the question "Who is going to grab off
the Coast title this year?"
We wish to cast no asparagus remarks
on contemporary sporting writers, but it
appears, according to communications
from Los Anbeles, Seattle, Portland, Mos
cow and Berkeley that Stanford is taken
for granted as easy meat. Beating us is
going to be water-fowl soup, a nice little
practice game preparatory to tackling the
Golden but Growling Bear. Mark-
Kelly in L. A.says that "(ins Henderson
knows down deep in his heart that he is
going to beat Stanford and Washington."
We ask, O Lord, how deep and when?
A Seattle paper predicts that Bagsbaw
and bis league will take Stanford like the
children take Castoria and will cry for
more of it. Hoop-la! The gentlemen
will probably find that the Cards are
good sized pills and when taken eleven
in a lot are bad medicine.
But now all we have to do is to jump
down each others throats and count the
wisdom teeth. Three months hence will
make many a prediction look like a hash
ish delusion and many a football team
look like last year's garden. All of which
goes to show that a dope story is only
a hope story aftef all.

the line and a quarterback in the backtield.
Captain Dud DeGroot, All-Coast center,
leaves bis berth to the care of George
Baker and Bob Hunt. Charlie Johnston
bequeaths the position of tackle to Fred
Loom is, Fred Ludeke, Bill Neill, Red
Potts, and a host of others who will also
be trying to hoist Harry Shipkey out of
his place at the other tackle. As to the
ends, while the 1922 grid will was being
read, Lawson and Janssen were heard to
say that they were not yet dead and were
not so sure about making a gift of their
positions to anybody. However, if the
notary public of education gives the nec
essary orders. Dole, Thomas, Mertz, Mid
dleton, McDermott, and possibly a few
others will be contesting each others
claims.
The weight and speed chart presages a
battle royal from beginning to end in the
backfield. a situation which augurs well
for Kerr's offensive this year. While it
is to be admitted that only one regular
remains from last year's set of backs,
there is still to be found in the rolls the
following list of gentlemen: Captain
"Scotchy" Campbell, Bud Woodward,
Paul Murray, Guy Dennis, Gil Wheat,
and Norman Cleveland. Add to this
group the names of the large and husky
Krtiie Nevers, the not-so-small "Solly"
Solomon, the beefy "Mugs" Mitchell, the
200-pound Jim Kelly, the weighty Dick
Lawson, the wiry Stratton, and a bevy of
minor lights. Subtract two for ineligi
bility and divide by a number necessary to
make eleven and you have the answer to
the question "Who is going to grab off
the Coast title this year?"
We wish to cast no asparagus remarks
on contemporary sporting writers, but it
appears, according to communications
from Los Anbeles, Seattle, Portland, Mos
cow and Berkeley that Stanford is taken
for granted as easy meat. Beating us is
going to be water-fowl soup, a nice little
practice game preparatory to tackling the
Golden but Growling Bear. Mark-
Kelly in L. A.says that "(ins Henderson
knows down deep in his heart that he is
going to beat Stanford and Washington."
We ask, O Lord, how deep and when?
A Seattle paper predicts that Bagsbaw
and bis league will take Stanford like the
children take Castoria and will cry for
more of it. Hoop-la! The gentlemen
will probably find that the Cards are
good sized pills and when taken eleven
in a lot are bad medicine.
But now all we have to do is to jump
down each others throats and count the
wisdom teeth. Three months hence will
make many a prediction look like a hash
ish delusion and many a football team
look like last year's garden. All of which
goes to show that a dope story is only
a hope story aftef all.
Six new regulars must be found by
Coach Andy Kerr between September 15
and the following month if the Stanford
football squad of 1923 is to fulfill the
promises of the previous season. Out of
a squad of eleven men there remain only
the two guards, a tackle, and an end in
the line and a quarterback in the backtield.
