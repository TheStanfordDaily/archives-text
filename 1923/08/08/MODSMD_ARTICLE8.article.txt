# 500 GETS NEW HOP ON WIFE BEATING ERA
## 
### 
Stanford co-eds by the score, whose
future husbands will probably never
even thing of beating them and would
certainly get the worst of it if they
tried, wander daily past a glass case
in the University library where stands
an exhibit of documents from less en
lightened (lays.
Back in 1848, so runs one of the
documents in evidence, a husband had
a legal right to beat his wife "in mod
eration ; that is, with a stick no thicker
than a man's thumb." It was unwoman
ly to belong even to a temperance
club; church sewing societies were the
only organizations open to the women
of '48.
And there weren't any co-eds. There
were not even free public high schools
for girls.
All this information about the femi
nine dark ages in America is con
tained in an exhibit arranged in con
nection with the National Women's
party'celebration, at Seneca Falls, N.
Y., of the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the first equal rights meeting, held in
1848 at that place. Pictures of the
mother of equal suffrage, Susan B.
Anthony, and other leaders in the
movement for the emancipation of wo
men, are shown, together with various
books dealing with the history of suf
frage.
"Woman, Her Rights, Wrongs, Privi
leges and Responsibilities," is the com
prehensive title of a volume published
in 18(i9 from the pen of a person who
signs himself L. P. Brockett, M. P., and
who may be supposed to have confined
himself to moderation when beating
his wife. The title page argument com
mits Brockett. to sketching woman and
"her condition in all ages and countries
from her creation and fall in Eden to
the present time: her legal status in
ngland, France, and the United States.
Her relation to man, physiologically,
socially, morally, and intellectually.
Her ability to fil her enarged sphere."
"Woman's suffrage," the tite page
continues, "its folly and inexpediency,
and the injury and deterioration it
would cause in her character; the best
means for her real elevation and ad
vancement.
Yet, impressive as Brockett's book
appears, it wins only casual glances
from the bobbed-haired, emancipated
"advanced" women who flock past it
daily, chattering frankly of the myriad
activities they have boldly entered in
spite of the "injury and deterioration"
predicted for them.
Flanking Brockett's vigorous treaties
on all sides are the pictures and writ
ings of Lucretia Mott, Luck Stone.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Carrier Chap

men who have paved the way for the
flapper of today who has a right, when
she is married, not only to the control
of her own earnings, but to pretty
thorough disposal of her husband's.
