# LOWER DIVISION PLANS DISCUSSED BY DR.WILBUR
## "Breathing Spell" Is Allowed In Which Student May Choose Major Department 
### 
Instruction in the various depart
ments at Stanford is being so organ
ized that it will dovetail with that of
the junior colleges throughout the
West, President Ray Lyman Wilbur
told the student body in assembly this
morning. "Some time ago," he said, "it
became evident that the junior colleges
were prepared to teach many subjects
that were handled here in the first
two years of college work. With this
in view, we did not believe we should
concentrate on this field. We decided
to fake a portion of it, and the lower
division was organized to care for
about 50ft students each year.
"The lower division." he said, "also
provides a breathing spell for students
who have not made up their minds in
what departments to specialize. Dur
ing the first two years at college they
look the situation over and reach a
decision while actually doing univer
sity work and learning something
about it." The regular departmental
work, after the first two years, Dr.
Wilbur indicated, is so organized that
students may enter either from the
lower division or from junior colleges.
Dr. Wilbur said that Stanford was
caring for as many students as pos
sible among the lower classes, but
that there is room yet in the labora
tories and buildings devoted to ad
vance work.
Dr. Wilbur spent much time this
morning telling new students of the
early history and ideals of the Uni
versity. "The founders," he said, "from
the first planned to house all the stu
dents of the campus in dormitories. In
the face of expansion we have not been
able to do this, but we are now build
ing two new dormitories which will
soon be ready, and we are conducting
a campaign for money for a third. In
the fall we will have accommodations
for a thousand of the men students
who live on the campus.
"The four quarter system," Dr. Wil
bur said, "has been responsible for the
nationalization of the faculty. It allows
them one period each year when they
may associate with other universities
of the country. The fact that several
national associations have selected
men of the Stanford faculty as their
heads indicates that the Stanford men
have wide acquaintance and associa
tion among the leading workers in
their fields.

work, after the first two years, Dr.
Wilbur indicated, is so organized that
students may enter either from the
lower division or from junior colleges.
Dr. Wilbur said that Stanford was
caring for as many students as pos
sible among the lower classes, but
that there is room yet in the labora
tories and buildings devoted to ad
vance work.
Dr. Wilbur spent much time this
morning telling new students of the
early history and ideals of the Uni
versity. "The founders," he said, "from
the first planned to house all the stu
dents of the campus in dormitories. In
the face of expansion we have not been
able to do this, but we are now build
ing two new dormitories which will
soon be ready, and we are conducting
a campaign for money for a third. In
the fall we will have accommodations
for a thousand of the men students
who live on the campus.
"The four quarter system," Dr. Wil
bur said, "has been responsible for the
nationalization of the faculty. It allows
them one period each year when they
may associate with other universities
of the country. The fact that several
national associations have selected
men of the Stanford faculty as their
heads indicates that the Stanford men
have wide acquaintance and associa
tion among the leading workers in
their fields.
