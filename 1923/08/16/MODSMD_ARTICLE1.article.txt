## Will Replace Judge Leib of San Jose, Bourn and Eells of San Francisco, Resigned 
### 
Election of three new members, one
of whom is an alumnus of the Univer
sity, to the board of trustees of Stan
ford University, has been announced
by President Wilbur, following a meet
ing of the board in San Francisco.
The new members of the board are
Ira Lillick, Stanford *97, of San Fran
cisco; C. O. G. Miller of San Fran
cisco, and Harry Chandler of Los
Angeles.
Three Resign
These trustees have been elected to
fill the vacancies 011 the board caused
by the resignations of Trustees Sam
uel Franklin Leib, William B. Bourn,
and Chas. P. Eells.
Judge Leib of San Jose, who has
given distinguished service to the Uni
versity as trustee since the founding
of the institution in IS9I, has tendered
his resignation, feeling that he is un
able to serve the University longer.
He was the legal adviser of Mrs. Stan
ford during the long struggle to main
lain the University endowment intact,
and he has been a conspicuous figure
in the whole life of the institution.
Bourn became a trustee of the Uni
versity in 1917 and his resignation at
this time is made necessary because
of ill health which has prevented him
recently from taking a full and active
part in the work of the board.
Trustee Eells, well known in San
Francisco, whose remarkable transla
tion of "The Life and Times of Apol
lonius of Tyana" from the original
Greek of Philostratus has just been
published by the University, resigns
just as he is completing -his second
term of service because of a trip
around the world, which will prevent
his giving close attention to the work
of the board.
Five Alumni Now ori Board
It is significant that in the personnel
of the new trustees one, Lillick. is a
graduate of the University, a member
of the class of '97. He has a wide repu
tation 011 the Pacific Coast as an ad
miralty lawyer, and his election to the
board now makes a total of five alumni
members in a membership of fifteen.
The other alumni members are Her
bert Hoover, '95; T. T. C. Gregory, '99;
Leland W. Cutler, '06, and John T.
Nourse, '00.
Trustee and Mrs. Lillick are the
donors.of the two Lillick scholarships
established at Stanford in 1920, pri
marily for law students and of the
value of $500 each.
Trustee C. O. G. Miller is widely
known in San Francisco business cir
cles and throughout the state.
First Southern Representative
Trustee Chandler, editor of the Los
Angeles Times, is the first representa
tive from Southern California to sit 011
the Stanford board. While not himself
a Stanford alumnus, Chandler will
bring to the position of trustee a close
understanding of Stanford affairs. Two
of his daughters, Constance Chandler.
'IS, and Mrs. Alice Goodan, '14, are
Stanford graduates, while a son, Har
rison Chandler, is now a student at the
University.
