# FIFTEEN-YEAR BUILDING PROGRAM WILL BE LAUNCHED
## Board of Control Sets Aside 149 Acres for New Fields And Equipment 
### 
Athletics for the many, as well as
for the few who may star in major
sports, is the policy, newly inaugurat
ed, upon which the athletic authorities
of Stanford University are embarking
in the provision of nine football fields
for the coming fall, on which 198 men
may play at one time. Graduate
Manager Paul Davis has announced
that there will be a stock of equip
ment at the Stanford gymnasium suf
ficient to outfit 350 men for participa
tion in the sport.
Twelve football teams will be in
action on the Stanford fields this fall.
There will be complete schedules for
the first and second varsities, the first
and second freshman elevens, and for
eight class teams. Competent coaches
are to be provided, in addition to the
varsity and freshman coaching staff,
consisting of Andy Kerr, Tiny Thorn
hill, Dud DeGroot, 1922 captain, and C.
W. Davis, director of intramural
sports.
Greatest Plant in U. S. Planned
Inside of 15 years, at the termina
tion of the new athletic program,
Stanford will have, in all probability,
the greatest athletic plant in the
United States. Work is to be done in
installments over the. 15-year period,
and the contemplated additions to the
athletic facilities will give Stanford
the nine football fields, ready this
year; six baseball fields; two soccer
fields; 26 tennis courts; eight basket
ball courts; six handball courts; two
polo fields; four volleyball courts; two
running tracks, already in existence;
and two swimming tanks, one of which
has been in use for some years. The
total cost of these improvements will
be approximately $270,000. covering an
area of 149 acres of ground, which at
present conservative figures is worth
$100,000, though it can not be sold
under the University grant.
Will Build New Pool
Next summer two wings will be add
ed to the north end of the present
Stanford gymnasium in order to dou
ble the present shower and locker
space. The second swimming pool
will be located nearby. The new pool
will be 100 by 200 feet in size, the
present tank being 40 by 100 feet. Two
new baseball fields will be added to
the present areas before next spring,
bringing the total number of playing
fields up to six. The present two soccer
fields are deemed sufficient to take
care of all those interested in that
sport.
Military polo, in which interest is
continually growing, will receive a
second field as soon as arrangements
can be made. The Stanford live played
its first, intercollegiate polo this year
with Arizona and within a few years
it is expected to be a well patronized
sport.
Football Provides Income
The moneys needed for these im
provements will be appropriated from
the income of the Board of Athletic
Control, chiefly derived from the
profits of football. The board receives
income from only two sources â€”foot-
ball and a small herd of sheep grazed
on the campus. Other than football all
sports show a deficit at the end of
the year. Football profits are about
$100,000 annually, most of this coming
from the Stanford-California fc ime. A
portion of these annual receipts for
the next few years will be used to
pay the cost of a much-needed dormi
tory now under construction; there

mainder must finance all sports.
While these intended changes repre
sent an ambitious program for a west
ern university, officials believe that
these plans, slowly taking shape from
the blueprint, will constitute an ideal
arrangement for the students of the
future. "The masses, rather than the
lew," is to be the slogan, says Gradu
ate. Manager Paul Davis. The few are
taken care of now, and the additional
program will provide for a student
body four times the size of that of the
present w.ith 2200' men and 500 women
enrolled.
