"Student opinion be damned!"
The foregoing viewpoint has been expressed by certain persons of
some authority at Stanford, while others, though pretending to listen to
what undergraduates have to say, have, by their actions, shown that the
same opinion holds with them. Happily, we are able to say that many uni
versity officials consider the undergraduate viewpoint very much for what
it is worth; but still we believe there are a few who might benefit them
selves and the university as well in givng a thought to student opnion,
with a view to considering it at its true value.
Not even those who have been most favoably inclined toward the
students have taken their opinion as anything to be particularly concerned
about. It is seldom regarded as a very serious matter. If the leaders of the
undergraduate body seem solidly for or against any particular measure,
this is often explained away. "It was all stirred up by Rube McGlook,"
said a faculty member on one occasion, "and of course we all know he is
radical and unreliable." Another one voiced his opinion that since he
never had been given credit for considering student attitude he should
not bother about it in the future.. With similar enlightening comment
student views are often set aside.
Of course we know ourselves that in manv matters the attitude of
undergraduates does not mean a great deal; but the fact we were never
able to grasp is that, as contrasted to student views, alumni criticism is
taken as very serious indeed. The graduates must be appealed to for
assistance in very conceivable manner, and therefore their attitude toward
university steps, policies,and changes, is of utmost importance.
It has always been surprising to us that the bond between students and
alumni is not thought of more often in this connection. In the first place
seniors this year are alumni next, and opinions formed on the campus slick
for a long time. In the second place, students make their opinions felt
among the alumni far more effectively than they do with university
officials. Real student leaders know this, and they fall back directlv upon
university graduates when they really want to accomplish anything.
Though for good and sufficient diplomatic reasons he will not do so,
the writer could name here at least three matters of vital importance,
accomplishment of which were of urgent necessity for the benefit of the
I'niversity, upon which a generally solid and essential alumni attitude
was brought about largely through consistent effort of undergraduate
students over a period of several years, who in their own way were able
to present the truth.
Our suggestion is: would not some time be saved in certain matters
if student opinion were considered seriously, as such. Why wait always
until it is taken to alumni? Of course, the undergraduate viewpoint is not
always disregarded, as we pointed out early in this comment. We remem
ber that Professor Clark 15. Whittier was very careful to get dependable
student viewpoint in the problem of abolishing probation as a disqualifi
cation for athletes,some time ago. and we believe that the observations
and intelligent criticism of undergraduates had very much to do with the
change which was finally made. Would not more men in authority do
wisely to follow Professor Whittier's lead?

Not even those who have been most favoably inclined toward the
students have taken their opinion as anything to be particularly concerned
about. It is seldom regarded as a very serious matter. If the leaders of the
undergraduate body seem solidly for or against any particular measure,
this is often explained away. "It was all stirred up by Rube McGlook,"
said a faculty member on one occasion, "and of course we all know he is
radical and unreliable." Another one voiced his opinion that since he
never had been given credit for considering student attitude he should
not bother about it in the future.. With similar enlightening comment
student views are often set aside.
Of course we know ourselves that in manv matters the attitude of
undergraduates does not mean a great deal; but the fact we were never
able to grasp is that, as contrasted to student views, alumni criticism is
taken as very serious indeed. The graduates must be appealed to for
assistance in very conceivable manner, and therefore their attitude toward
university steps, policies,and changes, is of utmost importance.
It has always been surprising to us that the bond between students and
alumni is not thought of more often in this connection. In the first place
seniors this year are alumni next, and opinions formed on the campus slick
for a long time. In the second place, students make their opinions felt
among the alumni far more effectively than they do with university
officials. Real student leaders know this, and they fall back directlv upon
university graduates when they really want to accomplish anything.
Though for good and sufficient diplomatic reasons he will not do so,
the writer could name here at least three matters of vital importance,
accomplishment of which were of urgent necessity for the benefit of the
I'niversity, upon which a generally solid and essential alumni attitude
was brought about largely through consistent effort of undergraduate
students over a period of several years, who in their own way were able
to present the truth.
Our suggestion is: would not some time be saved in certain matters
if student opinion were considered seriously, as such. Why wait always
until it is taken to alumni? Of course, the undergraduate viewpoint is not
always disregarded, as we pointed out early in this comment. We remem
ber that Professor Clark 15. Whittier was very careful to get dependable
student viewpoint in the problem of abolishing probation as a disqualifi
cation for athletes,some time ago. and we believe that the observations
and intelligent criticism of undergraduates had very much to do with the
change which was finally made. Would not more men in authority do
wisely to follow Professor Whittier's lead?
"Student opinion be damned!"
The foregoing viewpoint has been expressed by certain persons of
some authority at Stanford, while others, though pretending to listen to
what undergraduates have to say, have, by their actions, shown that the
same opinion holds with them. Happily, we are able to say that many uni
versity officials consider the undergraduate viewpoint very much for what
it is worth; but still we believe there are a few who might benefit them
selves and the university as well in givng a thought to student opnion,
with a view to considering it at its true value.
