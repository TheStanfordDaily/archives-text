It lias occurred to some that an unusual portion of this column lias
been devoted to the department of physical education. This is true, we i
hope, not without justification. The present comment, however, is not to
disagree with the department, but merely to point out what we would
consider an excellent step, if it is possible.
While university credit for work in the department was taken away
last year, we cannot believe that the' policy of discouraging advanced
study will be continued forever. Since requirements of gymnasium work
among underclassmen clearly emphasize the importance of physical
education, and since the University with the Hoard of Athletic Control has
built up an excellent staff for it< teaching and for instruction in coaching
as well, we have long wondered if it would not be feasible to organize the
department quartered at the gymnasium so that- an A.l>. degree in
Physical Education could be earned by the Stanford student.
The dignity of the Stanford degree would in no way be lowered.
The candidate would of course go through the lower division as other
students must. The proper requirements in schools of physiology, medi
cine and kindred departments would have to be worked out. Specialization
could be allowed in the theory and practice of teaching physical educa
tion, of handling physical development of students in schools and colleges.
The student could study coaching of certain sports, and methods of
coordinating inter-scolastic and inter-collegiate athletics with general
physical education in schools and colleges. With thÂ» A.K., he should be
qualified to assume a position in such a department as that now at j
Stanford.
That a number of students would take advantage of earning such a 1
degree if the opportunity were offered goes without saying. We should i
like to know if the "department" of physical education could be organized |
as indicated above.
TIHS ISSUE IS the last of the Summer Daily Palo Alto.
