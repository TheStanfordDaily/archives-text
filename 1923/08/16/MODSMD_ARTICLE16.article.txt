Riots are conclaves of peevish popu
laces where they hurl rocks and split
infinitives at rumored root of evil. In
Austria and Near East chief amuse
ment is bread riot. In Germany it is
Red riot. In San Francisco during
Democratic Convention, etc., it is bed
riot. And if it hadn't been for Cab
bages' good offices in explaining re
cent fruit shortage, America would
now be in banana riot.

History tells us there was big apple
1 shortage in Eden aeons ago and Eve
threw big riot. Angel hopped down out
of tree and read Riot Act while Eve
was busy chasing down defenseless fig
leaf. Poor clover plant saw depreda
tion and to protect self began to
sprout four-leaf growths. Got passed
up and four leaf clover has been omen
of good luck ever since.

Next big riot was caused by ground
shortage. Gang of medieval safe crack
ers tried to stop source of forty-day
j flood and missed last boat. Noah, play
| ing part of first Barnum, established
bang-up menagerie and owned the
world when the tide went down.

Third mob squabble was put on by
cows and bees as protest against un
; heard-of flow of milk and honey which
i was rumored as capable of cut-throat
I competition. Moses smote boulder with
shilallah and drowned out opposition.
* * *
In same period political bosses and
stationery salesmen put over big bust 1
when Moses grabbed off tablet and
Ten Commandments. Bosses wanted to
give all orders and stationers wouldn't
stand cut rates. Riot quelled when
butchers sided with Moses as result
of melting golden calf.

Certain archives also record great
coal and wood shortage in dim past.
Populace put 011 coal riot and were
1 pacified only when three Hebrews
were broiled in fiery furnace. Hebraic
! gents didn't brown well so enraged
ruler tried to warm up air by tossing
Dan in lion's den. Dan failed to swear
and lions all went bughouse with lock
jaw. People finally left oft' riot to shoo
away herd of hungry locusts.

Herod tried to start baby riot and |
died of grief when plan fizzled. Any-!
body getting same results today would
die of surprise that he didn't start riot
with first victim.

Modernists say days of riot are
about over. Don't kid selves, pedants.
Even in enlightened University of to
day the antedated custom prevails.
Tuxedos, evening gowns, scholarly as
pects, etc., mean nothing. Go to any
campus dance. It's a riot'.
