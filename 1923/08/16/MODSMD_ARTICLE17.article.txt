! Kerr will stay right here. He and
Warner will handle football, and Kerr

Stanford's Position
The following comiAent by George
Varnell of Spokane, the best football
| referee on the Pacific Coast, shows
; how Stanford football is regarded in
' the North:
"The situation at Stanford this fall
! appears to be a rather open one. The
! Cardinals under Andy Kerr, and fol
lowing a good spring practice with j
Glenn Warner, should be stronger than
last season, but not a championship
outfit. Stanford has four conference '
i [
games on its schedule for 1923, and if
the Cardinals get away with two of
them, the team will be doing about
all that can be epected of it."

before for the coming season.
