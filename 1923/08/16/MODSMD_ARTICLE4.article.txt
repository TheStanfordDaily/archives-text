# DUAL PERSONALITY SAID TO BE RESULT 0E ENVIRONMENT
## Goddard Traces Unusual Cases in Lecture at Little Theatre Tuesday 
### 
111 a lecture on "Multiple Person
ality" at the Stanford Little Theatre
Tuesday night, Dr. H. H. Goddard,
professor of abnormal psychology at
Ohio State .traced the history of two
cases which came to his attention at
the university hospital, the firs.t being
that of a 19-year-old girl who at times
was apparently normal for one of her
age, while at other times she was
mentally a girl of 4 years, ill-man
nered and rude, who passed only the
intelligence tests designed for children
of that age.
Dr. Goddard studied this case for
two years while the patient was at
the university. He also presented the
case of a woman in the twenties who
reverted to her own personality at the
age of sixteen.
The speaker was of the opinion that
every human being has a dual person
ality to a certain degree. Each in his
day dreams thinks of what he would
like to be. In the unusual cases of
double personality the extreme are
more emphasized, he pointed out.. The
19-year-old girl, who by heredity was
perfectly normal, was brought to her
present condition through forces of en
vironment. In her case, he said, the
problems of life were extremely diffi
cult, and she often thought of the dif-.
ferent situation of hfrr 4-year-old sister
who at this age was adopted by a
family of comfortable means. After
continual thought of the better for
tune of the younger girl, and immense
ly displeased with her own hardships,
she lapsed into the second personality.
Environment may be responsible for
such developments in the case of per
sons of excellent heredity, Goddard
stated, and in cases where the heredity
does not tend to strong characteristics,
a person may be more easily influenced
by surrounding conditions. The speak
er emphasized the value of under
standing on the part of teachers, who
largely made up the audience at the
Little Theatre.
Prof. Goddard is a director of the
Bureau of Child Research for Ohio,
and an authority on feeble-mindedness
and delinquency.
