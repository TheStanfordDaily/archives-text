# CARD GRID SQUAD NOT SO STRONG BUT LIKELY TO IMPROVE
## Kerr Thinks That Evolution in Football Will Prove 1923 Stanford Team Better 
### 
"Stanford's football material at the
present time does not seem to be the
equal either in quantity or quality of
the material available for the 1922
bquad. But this does not mean that
Stanford will have either a weaker or
an equally strong grid team this sea
son. If evolution is true in football, as
I believe it to be, Stanford will have
a stronger team this season in spite
of weaker material and should be able
to win her share of conference games.
The outcome will depend, of course,
upon the ability of the remaining can
didates to build and to improve upon
the foundation laid last year."
Thus, Coach Andy Kerr. Card men
tor. sizes up the 1923 football situa
tion at Stanford. He is neither pessi
mal ic nor optimistic and neither does
he make large assurances or remain
noneommital. It would be worse than
useless for him to take any particular
stand other than that Stanford will be
doing her best to the bitter end be
cause even he does not know what the
future holds in store according to pros
pects. Nor will he until the eligibility
question of certain of his best candi
dates has been answered. He has, how
ever. done his best in the way of pre
dictions, and after drawing a general
average on a basis of luck shows good
reason why Stanford ought to be an
improved grid machine this season.
Take, for example, his line. If Kerr
were to play a game today the line he
would pick would without doubt be as
follows: George Baker at center with
Bob Hunt in reserve. Bob Cravens and
Dick Faville at the guards, Harry
Shipkey and Fred Ludeke at the
tackles, while McDermott, Helser, and
Middleton could go in at end. All the
first string men played at least half
the games last season and Faville and
Cravens have been regulars for two
years. Of the entire first line, Baker is
the least experienced, but he will be a
worthy replacement, even for ex-Cap
tain Dud DeGroot.
The backfield will have to be almost
entirely built over. Of last year's squad
there are only three quarterbacks and
three reserve halfbacks remaining.
Cnnta!r "Scotch" Campbell will prob
ably draw first-string quarter position,
backed by Bud Woodward and Gil
Wheat. New candidates for this place
will be "Mugs" Mitchell from the 1922
Babe team, Nick Kirwan. Mitchell's
substitute, and Dick Lawson, who was
ineligible last year. As to the halves,
both Wilcox and Doughty have served
their time. Paul Murray, Norman
Cleaveland, and Guy Dennis, former
reserves, will now have to bear the re
sponsibilities of regular positions.
Hamilton, Roberts, Frazier, and
Dwight will be chief among the re
serves.
Of the numerous candidates for full
back to replace Murray Cuddeback, the
Cards' chief scorer last season. Ernie
Nevers, 190-pound full from last sea
son's freshman team, seems to be the
best bet. His competition will consist
of Fred Solomon, Clifford Hey, Jim
Kelley, C. (). Stratton, and Robert
Wright.
