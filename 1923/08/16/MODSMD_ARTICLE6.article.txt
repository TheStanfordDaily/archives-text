# CARD GRID SQUAD NOT SO STRONG BUT LIKELY TO IMPROVE
## Kerr Thinks That Evolution in Football Will Prove 1923 Stanford Team Better

"Stanford's football material at the
present time does not seem to be the
equal either in quantity or quality of
the material available for the 1922

question of certain of his best candi
dates has been answered. He has, how

reason why Stanford ought to be an
improved grid machine this season.
Take, for example, his line. If Kerr
were to play a game today the line he
would pick would without doubt be as
follows: George Baker at center with
Bob Hunt in reserve. Bob Cravens and
Dick Faville at the guards, Harry
Shipkey and Fred Ludeke at the
tackles, while McDermott, Helser, and
Middleton could go in at end. All the
