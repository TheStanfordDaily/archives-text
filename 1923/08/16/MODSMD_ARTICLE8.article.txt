# Rembrandt Etchings Will Remain at Art Gallery
## 
### 
The Robert M. Loeser collection of
prints, considered to be one of the
finest of its kind in the West, will re
main in the Art Gallery until the end
of the Summer Quarter, in order to
extend to all interested the opportunity
of seeing this unusual exhibit. The col
lection includes a group of original
etchings by Rembrandt, as well as
some original engravings by Durer.
There is at present also an exhibit
of Australian paintings by J. W. Curtis,
who has produced some excellent land
scape scenes, both in oil and water
color.
