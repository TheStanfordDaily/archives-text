ITS LACQUER-RED COLOR MAKES IT HARD TO LOSE
The Pen that kI j I
made the Grade qJ
mil Help You Make It Too 11 ||
ONE reason alone that the Parker 1, m
Duofold is invaluable to students * —* 10
is because fluent writing induces flu- r ~*'
ent thinking! You can't compose your mS
thoughts if an unruly pen harries your I ~ m
brain. But Duofold's balanced swing,
its super-smooth point, its fit and I I
business-like feel in your hand, all give m If ft]
your mind free rein! |bi Jp«f
Ask your student friends who use to Wm
this classic pen — they'll tell you they loj®
would rather let go of seven dollars than if g IJ
have to part with the faithful Duofold. || f* Iff
Its over-size ink capacity holds a m
long-distance ink supply. And its point f £f |f|
is not only smooth as a polished jewel, g ? jtj
but no style of writing can distort it; f|> m
hence, a pen you can lend without fear. II
Students call it the "All-American" m
Pen because it's the ranking favorite t fjf
at leading universities and colleges. j ffl .
Give ypurself a flying start this year E-HE-yJI
by getting Duofold this week. f|£||||3i
