# THREE-QUARTER DISQUALIFICATION RULE IS ADOPTED
## New "Flunk-Out" Regulation Passed by Committee on Scholarship 
### 
Students disqualified for poor scholar
ship may petition for readmission to the
University after three quarters, instead
of four, in accordance with a revision of
rulings made by the Scholarship Commit
tee last week.
The new ruling is explained in a state
ment by President Wilbur.
'"We have found by experience since
we have adopted the four-quarter system
that the one calendar year rule for dis
qualification makes a hardship upon the
student who is preparing for professional
work. Often this causes him to lose two
years instead of one in his professional
courses. This is because many of the
required courses are given but once a
year. The students who return at the
end of the calendar year finds that the
courses he should have taken have just
been given out.
"Under the new plan a student will
lose three quarters if he is disqualified
for poor scholarship. If he then demon
strates by college work elsewhere, or
successfully holds some position, then we
are willing to have him return and try to
make up his deficiency. He will come
back to the very courses in which he
failed and then, if he passes in them, loses
but the one year. Naturally, all students
returning to the University come back on
probation until they have shown their
ability to carry the normal amount of
university work."
Under this ruling students who "flunked
out" last Christmas may petition for re
admission this October instead of waiting
for the winter quarter.
The only case when a student disquali
fied for low scholarship will be "athletic
ally" benefited, is when his work has run
down over a number of quarters, and he
ha.-- improved during the quarter in which
he was disqualified. Conference eligibility
rules demand that an athlete pass two
thirds of an average course in his preced
ing quarter in the university. Men who
have failed in more than one-fifth of their
hours, in total, are also ineligible.
