# VARSITY DOWNS SAILOR ELEVEN BY 82-0 SCORE
## Captain "Scotch" Campbell Stars In Attack Against Sea-Dogs; Card Interference Good 
### Bill Wright, '25 
Coach Andy Kerr sat on the sidelines of the secret practice field last Friday
afternoon, watching his 192S varsity snarl the Mare Island sailors up in an
82-0 marathon, and wondering what it could do against a polished team. The
chief object of this story is to dispel the current rumor that the Cardinal
opposition came from the Vocational Hospital for basket-weavers.\
But against the feeble efforts of the sea-dogs, the varsity looked good.
Captain "Scotchy" Campbell ran around them or through them or over them
for three touchdowns. Paul Murray and Ernie Nevers each bagged a brace,
and Woodward, Dennis, Mitchell, Kelly, and Williamson carried the ball to a
conclusion. Throughout the game the interference was on the job, which
in itself is enough to indicate the near approach of sunrise in the Stanford
football night.

Sailors Lack Training
The sailors were in poor physical con
dition, and injuries were frequent. The
battle with Santa Clara a week earlier
seemed to have sapped their strength, and
the flock of reserves sent in by Coach
Kerr kept the tide of battle dismally lop
sided. Fumbles hampered their offensive,
only two Stanford kick-offs being
handled cleanly by the Navy backs.
Two minutes sufficed for the opening
Stanford store. The sailors kicked off,
and Nevers punted after Campbell's 3-
vard gain and a smeared line plunge.
Mare Island promptly fumbled near mid
field, and Stanford recovered. Murray
made yardage around left end, and went
through for nine yards on the next play.
Nevers made it first down, and Cleave
land took ten yards more. Murray
slashed through left tackle for the *23
varsity's first accomplishment. The goal
was missed.
Navy Fails in Attack
Almost the sole flash of Navy form
followed when Cavins took a short pass
and broke away for 20 yards. Three
bucks were piled into the Cardinal line
without gain, and a drop-kick from the
35 yard line fell short. The sailors were
never again within striking distance of
Stanford's goal.
'I he rest of the game was easier than
the first tally, with plenty of 15 and 20
yard trips and a few for more than 30.
he Cards unleashed a passing game that
looked pretty good, but the lack of Navy
defense may have had something to do
with it. Captain Campbell surprised
everyone with his broken-field runs and
snagging of passes, and the backfield ma
terial seems plentiful and promising. The
line is well balanced and so is the team.
Above all, the interference is good.
