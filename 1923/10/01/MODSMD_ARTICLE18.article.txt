# COME RIGHT IN

### 
Between sessions with time schedule and check
book, some four hundred new arrivals are today ob
serving for the first time the place where they will,
with luck, spend the greater part of the next four
years. They are wandering through the arched
colonnades, in and out of the brown sandstone build
ings whose solid strength have been for thirty years
the background of Stanford's effort to develop men;
they are replying, "How do you do?" most politely
to the many casual "Helios" from utter strangers;
they are striving to become acclimated on the shortest
possible notice to a world in which they will be taken
at their own personal value without regard for family,
connections, or past reputation for popularity.
In the space of a few weeks these newcomers will
learn many things about the Farm, and the greatest
of them will be this: that Stanford is a democracy,
where every man stands on his own ability.
The freshmen will find out that tales of hazing,
and sophomore "discipline" are mostly lx>sh; that
whatever correction is necessary will be done by
seniors, and that outbursts by over-officious under
classmen can be easily stopped by similar seat-warm
ing parties by the freshmen themselves.
As is the custom, assemblies for the freshmen will
be held regularly during the first part of the quarter
to explain the customs and small rules of conduct
which are accepted on the campus. When these are
well in mind, it will be up to the new students them
selves to conform to the will of that majority which
has been on the ground long enough to know how
things are run most smoothly.
Of course, there will be a few who feel that they
are above the common herd, and immune to the regu
lations of the majority. These freshmen are of the
same stock as those who. in former days, boasted with
loudest tongues that they were tubbed every night,
considering such attention a mark of their own im
portance.
One of the most ludicrous sights to be found on the
Farm during the first two weeks of any quarter is
the freshman athlete who has been persuaded that he
is about the most important member of the student
body, and hesitates not to inform every one this side
of Mountain View of that fact. Usually he is the
product of attention from members of some living
group who have been fawning upon him in an effort
to make him a member of their body and thus add to
their own prestige. The one more ludicrous sight is
that of the hypocrites who do the fawning.
This paragraph is to the freshmen themselves —
others can read it if they want to:. We have seen
you coming in and we think you have the making of
real Stanford men. Walk right up the gangplank
and you will find plenty of company on the boat.

In the space of a few weeks these newcomers will
learn many things about the Farm, and the greatest
of them will be this: that Stanford is a democracy,
where every man stands on his own ability.
The freshmen will find out that tales of hazing,
and sophomore "discipline" are mostly lx>sh; that
whatever correction is necessary will be done by
seniors, and that outbursts by over-officious under
classmen can be easily stopped by similar seat-warm
ing parties by the freshmen themselves.
As is the custom, assemblies for the freshmen will
be held regularly during the first part of the quarter
to explain the customs and small rules of conduct
which are accepted on the campus. When these are
well in mind, it will be up to the new students them
selves to conform to the will of that majority which
has been on the ground long enough to know how
things are run most smoothly.
Of course, there will be a few who feel that they
are above the common herd, and immune to the regu
lations of the majority. These freshmen are of the
same stock as those who. in former days, boasted with
loudest tongues that they were tubbed every night,
considering such attention a mark of their own im
portance.
One of the most ludicrous sights to be found on the
Farm during the first two weeks of any quarter is
the freshman athlete who has been persuaded that he
is about the most important member of the student
body, and hesitates not to inform every one this side
of Mountain View of that fact. Usually he is the
product of attention from members of some living
group who have been fawning upon him in an effort
to make him a member of their body and thus add to
their own prestige. The one more ludicrous sight is
that of the hypocrites who do the fawning.
This paragraph is to the freshmen themselves —
others can read it if they want to:. We have seen
you coming in and we think you have the making of
real Stanford men. Walk right up the gangplank
and you will find plenty of company on the boat.
Between sessions with time schedule and check
book, some four hundred new arrivals are today ob
serving for the first time the place where they will,
with luck, spend the greater part of the next four
years. They are wandering through the arched
colonnades, in and out of the brown sandstone build
ings whose solid strength have been for thirty years
the background of Stanford's effort to develop men;
they are replying, "How do you do?" most politely
to the many casual "Helios" from utter strangers;
they are striving to become acclimated on the shortest
possible notice to a world in which they will be taken
at their own personal value without regard for family,
connections, or past reputation for popularity.
