# THE 						STUDENT CENTER
## 
### 
Tonight, the first get-together of the year, will be
held in the Union quadrangle. Here old acquaintances
will meet again to swap tales of summer woe, and
freshmen will have a chance to meet those who will
be their companions for four years.
The Union court is now well started towards that
ideal which its founders meant for it: a center of all
student activity and recreation, where members of all
groups may meet on a common footing for promo
tion of Stanford's interest or their own amusement.
Workmen are now clearing the old plaster out of
what will be the community store, and installing the
proper spigots foivthe soda fountain that is designed
to take the place of Mr. Wilson's social center.
When the new dormitories are finished and the
second floor of the new Union can be cleared of
roomers to make way for student activity offices, the
Union quadrangle will be the hub of all undergrad
uate activity. Meanwhile, freshmen and hold-overs
will have the opportunity tonight to attend the first of
many social gatherings in the new student center.

"Howdy, frosh! Come out to the campus and I'll
help fix you up for a bed and room.''
The scene was at the Palo Alto station; the time
was 1897, when Stanford was making her reputation
for big deeds; the principals were Ray Wilbur and
Will Irwin. And the strange part of it was that noth
ing was said about the penalty for not wearing a dink.
