## 
### 
"Chaparral on sale Tuesday,"—the Old
Boy laughs gleefully as he makes the
announcement. What pleases him most is
that in the registration number there is—
but Ah! see for yourself.
The Old Boy has been going around
chuckling to himself at a great rate for
the past several days. And when the Old
Boy chuckles there is usually some
thing good forthcoming in the humor line.
He never wastes his laughs.
If you have passed by the Old Boy's
sanctum some night during the past week,
you must have noticed the bright light
shining from his window. No, that was
not an electric light your optic nerves
perceived. It was the gleam that lit the
Old Boy's eye as he looked over the con
tributions of Fred Fisher and the other
campus artists and humorists. For he
feels that this registration number is to
be a good one.
"So," says the Old Boy, "Chappy is
going 011 sale on Quad tomorrow without
fail, and subscriptions will be taken at
that time. Don't forget to look for the
new cover design by Fisher."
