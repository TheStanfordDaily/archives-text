# BABE GRIDMEN WIN SLOW GAME FROM SAN DIEGO; 54 TO 0
## Freshmen Show Unusual Early Season Development; Hyland Smashes Prep Line Hard 
### Walter Campbell, '26 
Running pell-mell through the San Diego High defense, and showing re
markable early-season development, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman grid
ironers piled up a 54-0 score in the Stanford Stadium Saturday. The only
marring feature of an otherwise brilliant game was the number of off-side
penalties given.
San Diego High, champions of Southern California last year, and with an
entire team of veterans, presented a heavy line and a fast backiield, but they
were unable to make headway against the freshmen. Coach Hunt's line was
practically impregnable, while his backfleld men bordered on brilliancy.

Babes Score at Ease
The babes' first score came after
three minutes of play, Dick Hyland
carrying the ball across the goal line.
After this, the scores came with ease,
two being registered in the second
quarter, one in the third, and four in
the last period.
San Diego soon found that the only
way to gain against the freshmen was
to use a passing game. But the Stan
ford goal line was never menaced.
Without a doubt, Dick Hyland was
the star of the game. Punts, passes,
broken field running, wide end runs,
and line-plunging are all in his vo
cabulary. Perhaps the most brilliant
play of the game was his running back!
of a punt, fifty-five yards for a touch-,
down through the entire San Diego '
team. Running with a peculiar gallop,
and carrying the ball rugby fashion, he
proved himself a hard man for the
high school lads to stop. During the
two quarters he was in the game,
Hyland made four touchdowns. If Hy
land is as consistently brilliant as he
was Saturday, he should be ready, af
ter a season's experience, to take a
place on next year's varsity. Punting is
perhaps his weakest department, but
at that he is the best on the team.
However, he is bound to improve as
soon as he can sufficiently overcome
his rugby style of kicking.
Baldwin Good Quarter
At quarter, Baldwin proved himself
to be an able field general and leader,
and he can carry the ball. His only
handicap is his light weight, although
he is fairly stocky. But his shiftiness
and speed make up for this defect.
Ryan, playing beside Hyland at half,
and Morrison at full, proved them
selves capable backfield men. Ryan is
not only fast, but a natural fighter.
Morrison makes a fullback that can
be depended upon for a few yards in
a pinch. With a tremendous drive, he
hits the line low, and is hard to stop.
Garthwaite, who relieved Ryan, dis
played an astounding amount of speed.
He is probably the fastest man on the
squad, as well as the lightest.
Line Is Strong
The forward wall showed up ex
tremely well, in spite of the fact that
many men were out of the game. The
line of the freshman eloven combines
the desirable qualities of beef, speed,
and fight. Swan, of last year's Olympic
Club team, played a particularly heady
game at left tackle. This man seemed
to be in every play. Anderson at guard
also showed marked ability. Price and
Natcher waged a pretty battle at cen
ter. with neither having much of an
edge. It will be hard to choose between
these two men in the future.

Running pell-mell through the San Diego High defense, and showing re
markable early-season development, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman grid
ironers piled up a 54-0 score in the Stanford Stadium Saturday. The only
marring feature of an otherwise brilliant game was the number of off-side
penalties given.
San Diego High, champions of Southern California last year, and with an
entire team of veterans, presented a heavy line and a fast backiield, but they
were unable to make headway against the freshmen. Coach Hunt's line was
practically impregnable, while his backfleld men bordered on brilliancy.

Babes Score at Ease
The babes' first score came after
three minutes of play, Dick Hyland
carrying the ball across the goal line.
After this, the scores came with ease,
two being registered in the second
quarter, one in the third, and four in
the last period.
San Diego soon found that the only
way to gain against the freshmen was
to use a passing game. But the Stan
ford goal line was never menaced.
Without a doubt, Dick Hyland was
the star of the game. Punts, passes,
broken field running, wide end runs,
and line-plunging are all in his vo
cabulary. Perhaps the most brilliant
play of the game was his running back!
of a punt, fifty-five yards for a touch-,
down through the entire San Diego '
team. Running with a peculiar gallop,
and carrying the ball rugby fashion, he
proved himself a hard man for the
high school lads to stop. During the
two quarters he was in the game,
Hyland made four touchdowns. If Hy
land is as consistently brilliant as he
was Saturday, he should be ready, af
ter a season's experience, to take a
place on next year's varsity. Punting is
perhaps his weakest department, but
at that he is the best on the team.
However, he is bound to improve as
soon as he can sufficiently overcome
his rugby style of kicking.
Baldwin Good Quarter
At quarter, Baldwin proved himself
to be an able field general and leader,
and he can carry the ball. His only
handicap is his light weight, although
he is fairly stocky. But his shiftiness
and speed make up for this defect.
Ryan, playing beside Hyland at half,
and Morrison at full, proved them
selves capable backfield men. Ryan is
not only fast, but a natural fighter.
Morrison makes a fullback that can
be depended upon for a few yards in
a pinch. With a tremendous drive, he
hits the line low, and is hard to stop.
Garthwaite, who relieved Ryan, dis
played an astounding amount of speed.
He is probably the fastest man on the
squad, as well as the lightest.
Line Is Strong
The forward wall showed up ex
tremely well, in spite of the fact that
many men were out of the game. The
line of the freshman eloven combines
the desirable qualities of beef, speed,
and fight. Swan, of last year's Olympic
Club team, played a particularly heady
game at left tackle. This man seemed
to be in every play. Anderson at guard
also showed marked ability. Price and
Natcher waged a pretty battle at cen
ter. with neither having much of an
edge. It will be hard to choose between
these two men in the future.

Running pell-mell through the San Diego High defense, and showing re
markable early-season development, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman grid
ironers piled up a 54-0 score in the Stanford Stadium Saturday. The only
marring feature of an otherwise brilliant game was the number of off-side
penalties given.
San Diego High, champions of Southern California last year, and with an
entire team of veterans, presented a heavy line and a fast backiield, but they
were unable to make headway against the freshmen. Coach Hunt's line was
practically impregnable, while his backfleld men bordered on brilliancy.

Babes Score at Ease
The babes' first score came after
three minutes of play, Dick Hyland
carrying the ball across the goal line.
After this, the scores came with ease,
two being registered in the second
quarter, one in the third, and four in
the last period.
San Diego soon found that the only
way to gain against the freshmen was
to use a passing game. But the Stan
ford goal line was never menaced.
Without a doubt, Dick Hyland was
the star of the game. Punts, passes,
broken field running, wide end runs,
and line-plunging are all in his vo
cabulary. Perhaps the most brilliant
play of the game was his running back!
of a punt, fifty-five yards for a touch-,
down through the entire San Diego '
team. Running with a peculiar gallop,
and carrying the ball rugby fashion, he
proved himself a hard man for the
high school lads to stop. During the
two quarters he was in the game,
Hyland made four touchdowns. If Hy
land is as consistently brilliant as he
was Saturday, he should be ready, af
ter a season's experience, to take a
place on next year's varsity. Punting is
perhaps his weakest department, but
at that he is the best on the team.
However, he is bound to improve as
soon as he can sufficiently overcome
his rugby style of kicking.
Baldwin Good Quarter
At quarter, Baldwin proved himself
to be an able field general and leader,
and he can carry the ball. His only
handicap is his light weight, although
he is fairly stocky. But his shiftiness
and speed make up for this defect.
Ryan, playing beside Hyland at half,
and Morrison at full, proved them
selves capable backfield men. Ryan is
not only fast, but a natural fighter.
Morrison makes a fullback that can
be depended upon for a few yards in
a pinch. With a tremendous drive, he
hits the line low, and is hard to stop.
Garthwaite, who relieved Ryan, dis
played an astounding amount of speed.
He is probably the fastest man on the
squad, as well as the lightest.
Line Is Strong
The forward wall showed up ex
tremely well, in spite of the fact that
many men were out of the game. The
line of the freshman eloven combines
the desirable qualities of beef, speed,
and fight. Swan, of last year's Olympic
Club team, played a particularly heady
game at left tackle. This man seemed
to be in every play. Anderson at guard
also showed marked ability. Price and
Natcher waged a pretty battle at cen
ter. with neither having much of an
edge. It will be hard to choose between
these two men in the future.
