# STANFORD TO HAVE GREATEST ATHLETIC PLANT IN COUNTRY
## 
### 
. When the new fifteen year athletic
program is completed, Stanford will have
' in all probability the greatest athletic
' plant in the United States. This was the
announcement recently made of the ath
letic authorities of the University.
As the first installment on this program,
nine football fields on which 198 men
1 may play at one time, have been com
pleted, and there is enough grid equip
ment in the gymnasium to completely out
fit 350 men. Twelve teams will be in
action this fall. Complete schedules have
■ been arranged for the first and second
varsities, first and second 1927 elevens,
and eight class teams.
Further contemplated additions to Car
dinal athletic facilities will give Stanford
6 baseball fields, 2 soccer fields, 26 tennis
J courts, 8 basketball courts, 6 handball
courts, two polo fields, 4 volleyball courts,
2 running tracks already in existence,
and 2 swimming tanks. The total cost of
these improvements and additions will ap
proximate $270,000.
Two new wings will be added to the
north end of Encina Gym next summer.
This will double the shower and locker
space. A second swimming pool will be
built nearby. It will be 100 by 200 feet
in size. The present tank measures 40
by 100 feet.
The money needed for the fifteen year
program will be taken from the income
of the Board of Athletic Control, chiefly
derived from the profits of football. Part
of these receipts in the next few years,
will be applied to the cost of the new
dormitory now under construction, while
the remainder will be used to finance all
sports.
