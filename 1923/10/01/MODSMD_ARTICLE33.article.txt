# Frantic Freshmen and Ousted Upperclassmen Become Home Seekers
## 
### 
j \\ ith Palo Alto in a state of violent
eruption, Dean Culver reports a verge of
insanity and half the men on the campus
running around like beheaded pullets. Due
to frenzied construction all summer and
a last final spurt, Toyon reached the tape
in a half-shot condition while Branner
was left hopelessly in the rear. Part of
the freshmen are in possession of Encina;
the rest are besieging every house in Palo
Alto which has more than three rooms.
| Upperclassmen are doubling up in 2"x4"
. beds or are camping-in at Toyon on a
! few stray mattresses.

Approximately 1400 students were en
rolled in the summer session at Auburn
college.

It is estimated that the National Park
System will yield $100,000,000 revenue
1 during the 19-3 season.
