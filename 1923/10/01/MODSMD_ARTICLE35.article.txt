# STANFORD BOXERS TO HAVE BIG YEAR IS MALONEY'S PLAN
## Trip to Australia Proposed; Class Tourney Winners to Receive Medals 
### 
This year is to be the big year of box
ing at Stanford, if plans being worked
out by Coach Harry Maloney are real
ized. A class tournament, including a
larger number of contestants than have
ever before participated with medals
for the winners in each weight division,
is nearly insured; and a trip for the var
sity boxing team to Australia next sum
mer is under negotiation.
Maloney has arranged to have medals,
named after and given by former Stan
ford boxing champions and near-cham
pions, awarded in all weights in the yearly
tournament. Letters have already been
received from a number of alumni, sig
nifying the desire to offer such medals
and to contribute to boxing development
here in other ways. John A. Macready,
who made startling air records in alti
tude, duration and distance fights last
year, and who was for three years col
lege lightweight champion will be donor
of the medal in the lightweight division.
Other medals are to be offered by J.
Donovan Flint, '16, G. P. Ross, '15,
Owen M. Sullivan, ex-'l9, and S. O.
Pemberton, '09.
Relative to a tour of Australia by the
boxing team, Maloney has received a
letter from H. Heydon, honorary secre
tary of the Australian Universities Sports
Association. He says in part: "The idea
appeals strongly to the Council, and every
effort will be made to carry out your
suggestion. The president for this year,
Dr. Harvey Sutton, Department of Edu
cation, Sydney, and I have been in touch
with Mr. Davis, of the Sydney Referee
newspaper, and we have a further ap
pointment with him for Friday of this
week. I have also written to all our
members (the four universities above:
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Queens
land) enclosing a copy of your letter, and
asking for comments and suggestions."
