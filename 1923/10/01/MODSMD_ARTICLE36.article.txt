by the existing conference regulations.
This action, although not promoted by the I
Stanford representative, is in accord with
the action of the Stanford Faculty Com- j
:nitlee on Athletics taken last year.
Stanford Faculty Committee on Athletics
taken last year.
In close connection with the adoption
of the above ruling, it was also voted j
that when a conference institution plays a :
non-conference institution eligibility lists
will be submitted as usual.
"Pro" Baseball Forbidden
Summer baseball for any remuneration ;
whatsoever has been absolutely forbidden
and yet the ruling has been constantly
broken without any action taken. This
rule was changed to read so that men
may take positions during the summer
where baseball is incidental. The rule
states that membership on any baseball I
club organized for financial gain is for-1
bidden. According to Dr. Barrow, this '
legitimatizes the present wide-spread
practice of men being given regular jobs j
with the understanding that they are also
to play baseball, but makes ineligible any
man who plays on a team organized for
financial gain.
Permission to maintain a training table |
was extended to include basketball where'
formerly it was limited to football and
crew.
New Rule More Explicit
"A new form of eligibility list was
adopted which calls for much more ex
plicit information in regard to the players
than has been the case heretofore," stated
Dr. Barrows. "From now on, all infor
mation in regard to the student, his hours
passed, his failures, his hours carried, the
positions held and the remuneration re
ceived, must be listed so that the matter
of deciding on his eligibility is left en
tirely to the facts as shown on the
eligibility list rather than to the judg
ment of the faculty member who signs
the list.
