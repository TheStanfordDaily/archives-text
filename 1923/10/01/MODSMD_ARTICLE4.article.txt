# GREENE'S, MEYERS,' AND "STICKY'S" NO LONGER ON CAMPUS
## Student Body Officers Will Be Placed in New Union by Future Plan 
### 
The disappearance of "Sticky" Wil
son's, Greene's cigar store, Jack Meyers
in Encina, and the removal of the cafete
ria from the Old Union to the New
Union are a few of the numerous changes
made by the University during the sum
mer months.
The future plan for the use of the
New Union, as outlined by Comptroller
Roth, is to make it the center of student
activity and control. As soon as suffi
cient dormitory units have been construct
ed the dormitory feature of the New
Union will be abolished. The rooms on
the second floor .will be taken out and
officers put in their places. All student
body offices will be removed from their
present location in the Administration
building and placed in the New Union.
The building formerly occupied by
Wilson's and Greene's is now the per
manent headquarters of the Y. M. C. A.
The former location of the *'Y" in the
Old Union has been remodeled and
turned into a general store, at which
tobacco, package candy, notions, and gro
ceries may be purchased. The store opens
today under the management of the
Union Board of Governors. In the rear,
there is a soft drink parlor.
A modern and well equipped ice cream
parlor will be installed in the basement
of the Old Union, the former location of
the cafeteria and will be open about the
first of November. Fine equipment,
booths and a fountain will be the chief
features of the new parlor. The only
entrance will be from the court in the
rear, the front entrance being elimi
nated.
The cafeteria has been moved to the
New Union and is located in the rooms
formerly occupied by the Union eating
clubs, and now located in the Encina
dining halls.
The dining room just off the main din
ing room in the New Union which was
occupied by independent eating clubs last
year, will now be available as a banquet
room.
