# REGISTRATION TOTAL FOR FRESHMEN IS 530 AT NOON TODAY
## 
### 
Five hundred and thirty freshmen lined
up before the door of the Administration
building early this morning for initiation
into the mysteries of college life. Three
hundred and thirty men and 200 women
paid their tuition fees before noon today,
and more were in line early this after
noon.
Although marked by eagerness, the ap
proach of the 1927 class was not as the
freshmen last year, and after the Admin
istration building had closed at noon, the
doors were still intact and windows re
mained unbroken.
