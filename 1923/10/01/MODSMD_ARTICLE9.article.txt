# SCOUTING ATHLETES FORBIDDEN BY NEW CONFERENCE RULING
## 
### 
A ban on scouting for and offering in
ducements to athletes, and the interpre
tation of what constitutes participation
in sport were the two outstanding fea
tures of the recent Pacific Coast Confer
ence meeting at Portland, Oregon, Sep
tember 14th and 15th.
"It has been generally realized for
some time," said Dr. Barrow, Stanford
representative at the conference yesterday,
"that the practice of some universities in
going out after high school athletes and
urging them to attend certain institutions
in order to provide athletic material, was
developing into a real problem in inter
collegiate athletics. This problem became
serious when it involved the members of
the staff who were, in most cases, mem

which they represent. An effort was made
by the University of California and Stan
ford representatives to have a rule
adopted which would definitely define
scouting and proselyting, forbidding its
practice and attaching a definite penalty
for an infraction of the rule. There
seemed to be some hesitation on the part
of some of the members to take such
drastic action. However, by a unanimous
vote, a rule was adopted which forbids
scouting for prospective athletes by mem
bers of any athletic staff or by anyone
officially connected with a university.
Stanford Rule Adopted
"The Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol last year adopted a similar regula
tion to govern activities and it is gratify
ing that the rule now has been adopted
by the conference.
"In this connection, the giving of com
plimentary tickets to high school boys
was also forbidden, since it was felt that
this was one pernicious phase of induce
ment to prospective athletes."
The conference favored a ruling that
for all members of the conference, con
ference rules of eligibility should be ob
served in all outside competition, even
though the opponent is not a member of
the conference or is even a non-collegiate
organization. Several members of the
conference had been observing this rule,
although it was not definitely called for
