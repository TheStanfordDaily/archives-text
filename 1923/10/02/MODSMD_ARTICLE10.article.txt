# CARD BOXERS MAY TACKLE AUSTRALIANS
## Team Composed of Veterans Likely to Take Ocean Trip in Summer 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Boxing is due for a boom when the
realization dawns on the Stanford rough
that the team is practically certain of a
trip to Australia this coming summer.
Coach Harry Maloney has been working
all summer to put the plan through, and
present indications point to his success.
At present he is awaiting definite word
lrom ijp Australian authorities that they
want the Stanford fist artists there fur a
few exhibitions.
The most outstanding men of last year's
team who have returned and will be
eligible are Robinson, heavyweight; Van
Hook, light heavyweight; Irwin, middle
weight ; and Armbruster, bantam weight.
Maloney expects to build a, formidable
aggregation around these stars, with the
influx of new material which is certain
to take place this year, with the prospect
of the Australian tour in sight. Jimmy
Ross, star lightweight and one-time inter
collegiate lightweight champion has re
turned to school, but will probably not be
eligible for competition this year. Johnny
Lane, last year's welterweight, has left
school and so his position will have.to
be filled with a new man.
In the past Stanford has never had a
really first rate heavyweight, due to the
fact that all of the big men in school play
football in the autumn and spring, and so
never have an opportunity to get mtHh
time for boxing. Robinson is big and
tall but lacks weight. He is just a few
pounds too heavy for a light-heavyweight,
and naturally will have a hard time if
he ever bumps up against some mauler
twenty pounds heavier.
Van Hook was practically inexpe
rienced last year aiul did not have a great
deal of luck with his fights. However, he
has been out in the open all summer and
gained a little beef, so will jje a much
harder fighter to down this year. Van
Hook has wonderful possibilities and with
a little more training will make a valu
able man for Maloney.
Last year's middleweight, Jack Irwin,
is back and looks better than ever. Irwin
had little difficulty in his battles last year
