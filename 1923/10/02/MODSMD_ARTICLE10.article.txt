# CARD BOXERS MAY TACKLE AUSTRALIANS
## Team Composed of Veterans Likely to Take Ocean Trip in Summer 
### Wallace Knox, '26 
Boxing is due for a boom when the
realization dawns on the Stanford rough
that the team is practically certain of a
trip to Australia this coming summer.
Coach Harry Maloney has been working
all summer to put the plan through, and
present indications point to his success.
At present he is awaiting definite word
lrom ijp Australian authorities that they
want the Stanford fist artists there fur a
few exhibitions.
The most outstanding men of last year's
team who have returned and will be
eligible are Robinson, heavyweight; Van
Hook, light heavyweight; Irwin, middle
weight ; and Armbruster, bantam weight.
Maloney expects to build a, formidable
aggregation around these stars, with the
influx of new material which is certain
to take place this year, with the prospect
of the Australian tour in sight. Jimmy
Ross, star lightweight and one-time inter
collegiate lightweight champion has re
turned to school, but will probably not be
eligible for competition this year. Johnny
Lane, last year's welterweight, has left
school and so his position will have.to
be filled with a new man.
In the past Stanford has never had a
really first rate heavyweight, due to the
fact that all of the big men in school play
football in the autumn and spring, and so
never have an opportunity to get mtHh
time for boxing. Robinson is big and
tall but lacks weight. He is just a few
pounds too heavy for a light-heavyweight,
and naturally will have a hard time if
he ever bumps up against some mauler
twenty pounds heavier.
Van Hook was practically inexpe
rienced last year aiul did not have a great
deal of luck with his fights. However, he
has been out in the open all summer and
gained a little beef, so will jje a much
harder fighter to down this year. Van
Hook has wonderful possibilities and with
a little more training will make a valu
able man for Maloney.
Last year's middleweight, Jack Irwin,
is back and looks better than ever. Irwin
had little difficulty in his battles last year
against Southern California and Davis
Farm, and is expected to do some good
work in the coming matches. Irwin is a
heady boxer and seldom gives his oppo-|
i nent an opening. From the looks of
tilings he should be intercollegiate chain-.
pion this year.
Adams looks the best best in the 145
pound class. He was not a regular last
year, but with Lane gone he should have
J a good chance to hold down the welter- j
1 weight berth. Giles Hall showed himself
to he a worthy successor of Jimmy Ross J
last year, and if he returns to school
should have little trouble in making a i
J place on the team.
Arnibruster startled the fans last year
i when he won the intercollegiate 125
| pound title. He was unheard of around
the farm before he started boxing but,
before the season was half over showed
| himself to be one of the mainstays of the
team. Earl has a way of jumping back
; from the ropes with a Firpo wallop which
' generally gives his opponent sweet j
J dreams.
A 115 pound boxer is not required by'
i conference rules but it is probable that
Maloney will carry a couple of lads
through the season if he can locate them.
Last year there was a lack of talent in |
this division, so whoever performs this j
year in this class will be a newcomer.
Boxing relations were cancelled with
California last year because of the pres
ence of colored fighters on the Berkeley [
team. Maloney hopes to straighten out
tlioce difficulties and to again hold the
matches with California. The California!
Aggies at Davis Farm are expected to
come through with two engagements as [
they have in the past few years. Reports
from the south say that Southern Cali
fornia has discontinued boxing, and if
these rumors are true the Stanford men
will have to confine their attention to
northern California bouts.

collegiate lightweight champion has re
turned to school, but will probably not be
eligible for competition this year. Johnny
Lane, last year's welterweight, has left
school and so his position will have.to
be filled with a new man.
In the past Stanford has never had a
really first rate heavyweight, due to the
fact that all of the big men in school play
football in the autumn and spring, and so
never have an opportunity to get mtHh
time for boxing. Robinson is big and
tall but lacks weight. He is just a few
pounds too heavy for a light-heavyweight,
and naturally will have a hard time if
he ever bumps up against some mauler
twenty pounds heavier.
Van Hook was practically inexpe
rienced last year aiul did not have a great
deal of luck with his fights. However, he
has been out in the open all summer and
gained a little beef, so will jje a much
harder fighter to down this year. Van
Hook has wonderful possibilities and with
a little more training will make a valu
able man for Maloney.
Last year's middleweight, Jack Irwin,
is back and looks better than ever. Irwin
had little difficulty in his battles last year
against Southern California and Davis
Farm, and is expected to do some good
work in the coming matches. Irwin is a
heady boxer and seldom gives his oppo-|
i nent an opening. From the looks of
tilings he should be intercollegiate chain-.
pion this year.
Adams looks the best best in the 145
pound class. He was not a regular last
year, but with Lane gone he should have
J a good chance to hold down the welter- j
1 weight berth. Giles Hall showed himself
to he a worthy successor of Jimmy Ross J
last year, and if he returns to school
should have little trouble in making a i
J place on the team.
Arnibruster startled the fans last year
i when he won the intercollegiate 125
| pound title. He was unheard of around
the farm before he started boxing but,
before the season was half over showed
| himself to be one of the mainstays of the
team. Earl has a way of jumping back
; from the ropes with a Firpo wallop which
' generally gives his opponent sweet j
J dreams.
A 115 pound boxer is not required by'
i conference rules but it is probable that
Maloney will carry a couple of lads
through the season if he can locate them.
Last year there was a lack of talent in |
this division, so whoever performs this j
year in this class will be a newcomer.
Boxing relations were cancelled with
California last year because of the pres
ence of colored fighters on the Berkeley [
team. Maloney hopes to straighten out
tlioce difficulties and to again hold the
matches with California. The California!
Aggies at Davis Farm are expected to
come through with two engagements as [
they have in the past few years. Reports
from the south say that Southern Cali
fornia has discontinued boxing, and if
these rumors are true the Stanford men
will have to confine their attention to
northern California bouts.
Boxing is due for a boom when the
realization dawns on the Stanford rough
that the team is practically certain of a
trip to Australia this coming summer.
Coach Harry Maloney has been working
all summer to put the plan through, and
present indications point to his success.
At present he is awaiting definite word
lrom ijp Australian authorities that they
want the Stanford fist artists there fur a
few exhibitions.
The most outstanding men of last year's
team who have returned and will be
eligible are Robinson, heavyweight; Van
Hook, light heavyweight; Irwin, middle
weight ; and Armbruster, bantam weight.
Maloney expects to build a, formidable
aggregation around these stars, with the
influx of new material which is certain
to take place this year, with the prospect
of the Australian tour in sight. Jimmy
Ross, star lightweight and one-time inter
collegiate lightweight champion has re
turned to school, but will probably not be
eligible for competition this year. Johnny
