# Professor Almack Speaks On Immigration Problems
## 
### 
Professor John C. Almack of the edu
cation department urged the restriction of
immigration before a meeting of the San
Jose Women's Club last Saturday. He
spoke of the difficulties of assimilation,
and traced the tragedies which other na
tions have had to face with immigrants in
the past.
On this point he said:
"Nations who have failed to solve this
problem fell into decay and dissolution,
and with their history before us, it is
proper that we view this problem with
great care. Propaganda urging less re
striction of immigration is for the pur
pose of securing cheaper labor, but our
labor problems can be settled otherwise.
"While the melting-pot idea is good
theoretically and poetically it is not a
practical success. The strength of a na
tion does not depend only upon the ex
tent of its territory or the size of its
population, but the most important ele
ment consists of those things that create
a spirit of unity among the people. One
of these things is race. Wc must accept
the fact that there is such a thing as
social tradition which gives us the ability
to understand those with whom we asso
ciate."
