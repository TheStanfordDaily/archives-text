# "Y" HEADQUARTERS NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
Transformation of a soda fountain and
candy store into a five-room headquarters
for men of the University is the work of
the Stanford Y. M. C. A. during the next
two weeks.
The building used by the "Y" occupied
formerly by Wilson's confectaurant and
Greene's tobacco shop, is undergoing
thorough renovation. The large room fac
ing on Portola street will probably "be
decorated by the ladies of Palo Alto to
add the "home" touch. The room meas
ures 51 by 24 feet and will be heated by
electricity, although it is planned to have
a large fireplace installed later on.
A modern office suite will occupy the
rear half of the new quarters. Both Dr.
Morgan, head of the Stanford branch,
and "Jim" Sparling, secretary, have of
fices, and in addition there is a lobby and
kitchenette. Dr. Morgan has secured the
services of an experienced office assistant
in Mrs. Clara V. Stewart, who for two
years was connected with the staff of the
San Francisco Journal.
Freshman "Bibles" to the number of
633 were sent out to all new students two
weeks ago. If, however, any member of
the class of '27 failed to receive his copy,
he may secure it by calling around to
the Y. M. C .A. office, which will con
tinue to welcome visits from both new
and old friends, and to give any informa
tion available.
Gale Seamon, coast student secretary,
who is the representative of the "Y" in
eight of the Pacific Coast states, and Dr.
D. C. Gardner, university chaplain, were
guests at the "setting-up" conference at
the home of Charles K. Field, '95, at Los
Altos Sunday, when the officers of the
association held their pre-season get-to
gether.
Freshmen Sunday discussion groups
will start on the 14th, but with the dif
ference that they will be held in the rooms
of the various student members instead
of the Memorial church, as was the cus
tom last year. This is a deliberate at
tempt to break away from the formal dis
cussion which too often becomes a lecture
by the leaders, and to approach the idea
of a supervised "bull-session" at which
every man could offer and defend his own
views freely. "The 'Y' aims to encourage
men to think for themselves on their own
problems," says Dr. Morgan. "Freshmen
will find these open discussion groups a
decided help in getting their bearings dur
ing the first weeks of their college
course."

Freshmen Sunday discussion groups
will start on the 14th, but with the dif
ference that they will be held in the rooms
of the various student members instead
of the Memorial church, as was the cus
tom last year. This is a deliberate at
tempt to break away from the formal dis
cussion which too often becomes a lecture
by the leaders, and to approach the idea
of a supervised "bull-session" at which
every man could offer and defend his own
views freely. "The 'Y' aims to encourage
men to think for themselves on their own
problems," says Dr. Morgan. "Freshmen
will find these open discussion groups a
decided help in getting their bearings dur
ing the first weeks of their college
course."

President Wilbur Will Receive Faculty

the Stanford Y. M. C. A. during the next
two weeks.
The building used by the "Y" occupied
formerly by Wilson's confectaurant and
Greene's tobacco shop, is undergoing
thorough renovation. The large room fac
ing on Portola street will probably "be
decorated by the ladies of Palo Alto to
add the "home" touch. The room meas
ures 51 by 24 feet and will be heated by
electricity, although it is planned to have
a large fireplace installed later on.
A modern office suite will occupy the
rear half of the new quarters. Both Dr.
Morgan, head of the Stanford branch,
and "Jim" Sparling, secretary, have of
fices, and in addition there is a lobby and
kitchenette. Dr. Morgan has secured the
services of an experienced office assistant
in Mrs. Clara V. Stewart, who for two
years was connected with the staff of the
San Francisco Journal.
Freshman "Bibles" to the number of
633 were sent out to all new students two
weeks ago. If, however, any member of
the class of '27 failed to receive his copy,
he may secure it by calling around to
the Y. M. C .A. office, which will con
tinue to welcome visits from both new
and old friends, and to give any informa
tion available.
Gale Seamon, coast student secretary,
who is the representative of the "Y" in
eight of the Pacific Coast states, and Dr.

the home of Charles K. Field, '95, at Los
Altos Sunday, when the officers of the
association held their pre-season get-to
