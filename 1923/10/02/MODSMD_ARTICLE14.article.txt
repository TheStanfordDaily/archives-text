# VARSITY PROSPECTS SEEM GOOD; SQUAD HAS CAUGHT STRIDE
## Kerr Builds for Future Rather Than Present; Men Must Know Football Fundamentals 
### 
Just about a year ago, "Little Andy" Kerr put his first Stanford team on
the field, not even claiming that it would win as many games as the team
which preceded it. He said that it would know football better —and it did.
The 1923 Cardinal varsity, now in the making, will know more football than
either of those teams, and the number of games it will win is, comparatively,
a small matter. "Little Andy" is going to have a 1924 varsity that will both
know football and win games. He will have laid I)is foundations.
An alumnus who watched the Mare Island game last Friday remarked that
the team looked better in that game, after two weeks of practice, than it did
in the first Conference game last year. True, it wasn't up against Conference
standard, but, at the same time, Kerr's goal is almost in sight.
On September 15 the squad turned out, and at the end of the first week
the coaches divided the men into foui' squads, more or less roughly graded
according to weight, but with most of the varsity men on the "A" squad. After
the Mare Island game, the sailors commented that every man hit them about
so hard, regardless of which squad he was on, and that the difference was

hardly noticeable. The fourth squail
holds the varsity line fairly consistent
ly in scrimmage, so there ib no danger
of the first-string men being without a
good chance to work out.
Campbell Comes Through
Captain "Scotch" Campbell, at quar
ter, is showing the world why he was
elected. He is by far the steadiest man
at kicking goals from placement, he is
reliable at his old game of pulling
down passes, and his broken field run
ning shows his Rugby training. He has
his team working with him rather
than for him, and is a captain as well
as a player.
Ernie Nevers and Fred Solomon,
both of the 1926 eleven, are fighting
it out for the position at fullback, with
the odds at present favoring Nevers.
The 205-pound sophomore is kicking,
plunging, and running interference bet
ter than ever, and still gets plenty of
power into his tackling. Solomon is
hot on his trail, however, and may get
his chance later in the year.
Paul Murray and Norm Cleaveland,
who seem to be the first-string half
backs, are both going well, especially
at running with the ball. Murray's
weak ankles have so far given him no
worry, and according to Coach Kerr he
is the best all-around man in the back
field. Cleaveland has been kicking
under "Dink" Templeton since the first
week of practice, and gets more dis
tance out of his boots than anyone else.
Nevers gets them off quicker and
Campbell surpasses at placements, so
the footwork will probably be dis
tributed among these three men.
Line Positions Contested
In the forward wall, Thomas, at end,
is performing better than he did in his
few games last year. He is fast, weighs
175 pounds, catches well, and has
gained in experience. Dole, on the
other wing, is working hard and con
sistently. His style of play is never
spectacular, but he can generally be
relied upon. Helser and Middleton are
next in line for the flank positions.
Harry Shipkey, at tackle, is apt to
hold his position, unless something
crops up in the way of injuries or dark
horses. Shipkey is a veteran, and was
considered one of the bulwarks of the
1922 Cardinal line. Opposite him, Lu
deke is not so secure. The big boy has
never been the same since he suffered
that injured shoulder in the northern
mud last season, and Neill, of the 1925
freshmen, is putting up a great battle
for the place.
Bob Cravens and Dick Faville seem
to be growing roots at guard. Cravens
has been called the most finished
player on the squad, and Faville has
recovered from a broken nose sus
tained in the second week of practice.
Loomis is after the position, and may
be heard from later on.
Baker Is Light
George Baker, at center, plays a
scrappy game, but his 178 pounds are
a handicap. The line, from tackle to
tackle, averages between 190 and 195
pounds including Baker, who is the
weak link as far as weight is con
cerned. Hunt, a 200-pounder from the
'26 team, may be able to push Baker
pretty hard.
The find of the season, so far as
material goes, is "Blink" Williamson,
track star and broken field runner ex
traordinary. "Blink" is through with
the cinder oval, and is working as left
holf on "B" squad, with no prospective
440 to make him take care of his legs.
He is a flash at carrying the ball, and
is also good at tackling.
Kelly, an ex-star at Rugby, is out for
fullback and has been hitting the line
well. Guy Dennis has taken on ten
pounds since last season, which should
add to his power without cutting down
his speed. Dunmire, a transfer from
Princeton, is another candidate for
halfback.
As a team, the men are working hard
and are out to win, without disproving
Kerr's system. Their tackling and in
terference is greatly improved. Coach
Kerr does not promise a winning team,
but he does guarantee one that plays
good football better than it did last
year, and will know the fundamentals
of the game. We will nave a stronger
team—but so will Washington, U. S.
C., Idaho, and others.

player on the squad, and Faville has
recovered from a broken nose sus
tained in the second week of practice.
Loomis is after the position, and may
be heard from later on.
Baker Is Light
George Baker, at center, plays a
scrappy game, but his 178 pounds are
a handicap. The line, from tackle to
tackle, averages between 190 and 195
pounds including Baker, who is the
weak link as far as weight is con
cerned. Hunt, a 200-pounder from the
'26 team, may be able to push Baker
pretty hard.
The find of the season, so far as
material goes, is "Blink" Williamson,
track star and broken field runner ex
traordinary. "Blink" is through with
the cinder oval, and is working as left
holf on "B" squad, with no prospective
440 to make him take care of his legs.
He is a flash at carrying the ball, and
is also good at tackling.
Kelly, an ex-star at Rugby, is out for
fullback and has been hitting the line
well. Guy Dennis has taken on ten
pounds since last season, which should
add to his power without cutting down
his speed. Dunmire, a transfer from
Princeton, is another candidate for
halfback.
As a team, the men are working hard
and are out to win, without disproving
Kerr's system. Their tackling and in
terference is greatly improved. Coach
Kerr does not promise a winning team,
but he does guarantee one that plays
good football better than it did last
year, and will know the fundamentals
of the game. We will nave a stronger
team—but so will Washington, U. S.
C., Idaho, and others.
Just about a year ago, "Little Andy" Kerr put his first Stanford team on
the field, not even claiming that it would win as many games as the team
which preceded it. He said that it would know football better —and it did.
The 1923 Cardinal varsity, now in the making, will know more football than
either of those teams, and the number of games it will win is, comparatively,
a small matter. "Little Andy" is going to have a 1924 varsity that will both
know football and win games. He will have laid I)is foundations.
An alumnus who watched the Mare Island game last Friday remarked that
the team looked better in that game, after two weeks of practice, than it did
in the first Conference game last year. True, it wasn't up against Conference
standard, but, at the same time, Kerr's goal is almost in sight.
On September 15 the squad turned out, and at the end of the first week
the coaches divided the men into foui' squads, more or less roughly graded
according to weight, but with most of the varsity men on the "A" squad. After
the Mare Island game, the sailors commented that every man hit them about
so hard, regardless of which squad he was on, and that the difference was

hardly noticeable. The fourth squail
holds the varsity line fairly consistent
ly in scrimmage, so there ib no danger
of the first-string men being without a
good chance to work out.
Campbell Comes Through
Captain "Scotch" Campbell, at quar
ter, is showing the world why he was
elected. He is by far the steadiest man
at kicking goals from placement, he is
reliable at his old game of pulling
down passes, and his broken field run
ning shows his Rugby training. He has
his team working with him rather
than for him, and is a captain as well
as a player.
Ernie Nevers and Fred Solomon,
both of the 1926 eleven, are fighting
it out for the position at fullback, with
the odds at present favoring Nevers.
The 205-pound sophomore is kicking,
plunging, and running interference bet
ter than ever, and still gets plenty of
power into his tackling. Solomon is
hot on his trail, however, and may get
his chance later in the year.
Paul Murray and Norm Cleaveland,
who seem to be the first-string half
backs, are both going well, especially
at running with the ball. Murray's
weak ankles have so far given him no
worry, and according to Coach Kerr he
is the best all-around man in the back
field. Cleaveland has been kicking
under "Dink" Templeton since the first
week of practice, and gets more dis
tance out of his boots than anyone else.
Nevers gets them off quicker and
Campbell surpasses at placements, so
the footwork will probably be dis
tributed among these three men.
Line Positions Contested
In the forward wall, Thomas, at end,
is performing better than he did in his
few games last year. He is fast, weighs
175 pounds, catches well, and has
gained in experience. Dole, on the
other wing, is working hard and con
sistently. His style of play is never
spectacular, but he can generally be
relied upon. Helser and Middleton are
next in line for the flank positions.
Harry Shipkey, at tackle, is apt to
hold his position, unless something
crops up in the way of injuries or dark
horses. Shipkey is a veteran, and was
considered one of the bulwarks of the
1922 Cardinal line. Opposite him, Lu
deke is not so secure. The big boy has
never been the same since he suffered
that injured shoulder in the northern
mud last season, and Neill, of the 1925
freshmen, is putting up a great battle
for the place.
Bob Cravens and Dick Faville seem
to be growing roots at guard. Cravens
has been called the most finished
player on the squad, and Faville has
recovered from a broken nose sus
tained in the second week of practice.

Paul Murray and Norm Cleaveland,
who seem to be the first-string half
backs, are both going well, especially
at running with the ball. Murray's
weak ankles have so far given him no
worry, and according to Coach Kerr he
is the best all-around man in the back
field. Cleaveland has been kicking
under "Dink" Templeton since the first
week of practice, and gets more dis
tance out of his boots than anyone else.
Nevers gets them off quicker and
Campbell surpasses at placements, so
the footwork will probably be dis
tributed among these three men.
Line Positions Contested
In the forward wall, Thomas, at end,
is performing better than he did in his
few games last year. He is fast, weighs
175 pounds, catches well, and has
gained in experience. Dole, on the
other wing, is working hard and con
sistently. His style of play is never
spectacular, but he can generally be
relied upon. Helser and Middleton are
next in line for the flank positions.
Harry Shipkey, at tackle, is apt to
hold his position, unless something
crops up in the way of injuries or dark
horses. Shipkey is a veteran, and was
considered one of the bulwarks of the
1922 Cardinal line. Opposite him, Lu
deke is not so secure. The big boy has
never been the same since he suffered
that injured shoulder in the northern
mud last season, and Neill, of the 1925
freshmen, is putting up a great battle
for the place.
Bob Cravens and Dick Faville seem
to be growing roots at guard. Cravens
has been called the most finished
player on the squad, and Faville has
recovered from a broken nose sus
tained in the second week of practice.
Loomis is after the position, and may
be heard from later on.
Baker Is Light
George Baker, at center, plays a
scrappy game, but his 178 pounds are
a handicap. The line, from tackle to
tackle, averages between 190 and 195
pounds including Baker, who is the
weak link as far as weight is con
cerned. Hunt, a 200-pounder from the
'26 team, may be able to push Baker
pretty hard.
The find of the season, so far as
material goes, is "Blink" Williamson,
track star and broken field runner ex
traordinary. "Blink" is through with
the cinder oval, and is working as left
holf on "B" squad, with no prospective
440 to make him take care of his legs.
He is a flash at carrying the ball, and
is also good at tackling.
Kelly, an ex-star at Rugby, is out for
fullback and has been hitting the line
well. Guy Dennis has taken on ten
pounds since last season, which should
add to his power without cutting down
his speed. Dunmire, a transfer from
Princeton, is another candidate for
halfback.
As a team, the men are working hard
and are out to win, without disproving
Kerr's system. Their tackling and in
terference is greatly improved. Coach
Kerr does not promise a winning team,
but he does guarantee one that plays
good football better than it did last
year, and will know the fundamentals
of the game. We will nave a stronger
team—but so will Washington, U. S.
C., Idaho, and others.
Just about a year ago, "Little Andy" Kerr put his first Stanford team on
the field, not even claiming that it would win as many games as the team
which preceded it. He said that it would know football better —and it did.
The 1923 Cardinal varsity, now in the making, will know more football than
either of those teams, and the number of games it will win is, comparatively,
a small matter. "Little Andy" is going to have a 1924 varsity that will both
know football and win games. He will have laid I)is foundations.
An alumnus who watched the Mare Island game last Friday remarked that
the team looked better in that game, after two weeks of practice, than it did
in the first Conference game last year. True, it wasn't up against Conference
standard, but, at the same time, Kerr's goal is almost in sight.
On September 15 the squad turned out, and at the end of the first week
the coaches divided the men into foui' squads, more or less roughly graded
according to weight, but with most of the varsity men on the "A" squad. After
the Mare Island game, the sailors commented that every man hit them about
so hard, regardless of which squad he was on, and that the difference was

hardly noticeable. The fourth squail
holds the varsity line fairly consistent
ly in scrimmage, so there ib no danger
of the first-string men being without a
good chance to work out.
Campbell Comes Through
Captain "Scotch" Campbell, at quar
ter, is showing the world why he was
elected. He is by far the steadiest man
at kicking goals from placement, he is
reliable at his old game of pulling
down passes, and his broken field run
ning shows his Rugby training. He has
his team working with him rather
than for him, and is a captain as well
as a player.
Ernie Nevers and Fred Solomon,
both of the 1926 eleven, are fighting
it out for the position at fullback, with
the odds at present favoring Nevers.
The 205-pound sophomore is kicking,
plunging, and running interference bet
ter than ever, and still gets plenty of
power into his tackling. Solomon is
hot on his trail, however, and may get
his chance later in the year.
Paul Murray and Norm Cleaveland,
