# GOOD NEWS FOR BILL
## 
### 
The Scholarship committee announced last week
that students disqualified three quarters previously
may return this fall instead of waiting; a full year.
Immediately the venders of dope gave tentative
cheers, thinking of a needed increase to the football
squad and revising hastily their estimates on the pro
portion of paper victories.
Athletes who forgot the proportion of studies to
pigskin research will be greatly benefited. But the
greatest part of the benefit goes to an entirely sep
arate group.
Very few stopped to figure out what the ruling
meant to Bill Brogan, who flunked out last Christ
mas because he was hashing in Palo Alto, running
a laundry agency, and carrying six hours of labora
tory courses. Briefly, it means that Bill can come
back and start in on practically the same basis, as
far as units,are concerned, as he stoojl at the begin
ning of flip fall quarter last year.
d a lot of hours last Christmas. Under
quarter suspension rule he would re
-0 wis January so far behind that for all
practical purposes he would have the same rating
as he held when he signed in last October. That is,
he would lose not only a year, but a year and a
%
quarter.
1 hat was tough on Bill. His financial arrange
ments would not permit him to give up the three
summer months to attendance at summer school. So
Bill would have had to come back next Christmas,
and would have graduated a year and three months
later than he would if it had not been for the laun
dry agency. <
Now Air. Brogan returns this fall with much re
joicing. ready to step in again where he left off last
Christmas. Nobody pays much attention to him, but
lie forms a big element in campus life, and he is
ready to stand up and yell for those members of the
faculty who did away with a plain injustice.
