# VARSITY ON THE KICK-OFF
## 
### 
Those who were conscientious enough to return
too soon for payment of a late registration fee saw
the Stanford varsity machine tested out for the first
time last Friday. Aside from the apparent weak
ness of the Navy team, the clean, snappy way in
which the squad ran off its plays, got down on punts,
ran interference, and scooped in the fumbles gave
even the cold water prophets cause for elation.
Thv team this year knows as much good basic foot
ball right now as it thought it knew two-thirds
through the season of 1922. That was proven last
Friday. There are two backfields working as
smoothly as Kerr's best of a year ago. There is a
line composed mostly of veterans. But most im
portant of all, there is an entire substitute eleven that
can hit as hard and gain as much as the first string
line-up.
Nobody at the training quarters is talking of a
championship eleven; but all of the squad knows
football from A to X. and knows how to use the in
formation at the right time. Which is pretty good
cause for the enthusiasm which new arrivals find
throughout the campus over results of one year under
the Warner system.
