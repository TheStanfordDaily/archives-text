# FRESHMAN ELEVEN HAS WELL BALANCED LINE AND BACKFIELD
## 
### 
With a heavy line and a fast backfield
the Stanford freshman eleven is facing
what should prove one of the most suc
cessful seasons of recent years. And last
Saturday's crushing defeat of San Diego
high shows conclusively that the fresh
men gridders have the punch, with the
accent on the punch.
With an entire squad of former high
school stars, Coach "Husky" Hunt has a
hard task ahead of him in picking his
first eleven. The two encounters next
Saturday will show every man on the
squad in action, and should help mate
rially in the final selection of the team
that is to face the U. S. C. and California
freshmen elevens.
Backfield stars are not lacking on the
babe team. This fact was brought for
cibly home last Saturday when Hyland,
Ryan, Baldwin, Morrison, Garthwaite,
Phillips and Wool tore at the heavy San
Diego line for huge gains. And one of
the outstanding features of this combina
tion is that it has what was lacking in the
backfield of last year's freshman team —
beef. There is still as much, or more
speed than obtained by the 1926 com
bination.
Baldwin and Mann, at quarter, are
worthy successors of Mitchell and Ker
win. Fight and determination arc both
there in vast quantities, coupled with
plenty of football brains. Baldwin is al
most certain to become a star this season,
although he is very light.
Hyland seems to be a combination of
Cook and Clayes of last year's eleven and
Dixon, the California star. He represents
the thing that is needed badly on any
eleven—a reliable triple-threat man. A
great rugby player, he seems destined to
go even farther in the American game.
Morrison at fullback is dependable. A
tremendous driving power enables him to,
hit the line low and hard. Wool is also
a high class man.
But in the line rests the full strength !
of the babes. Size, fight, and speed are :
enough to make any forward wall look j
good—and they are all there. Swan at |
tackle will prove a star. This former
Berkeley high star has ha d intercolle
giate experience with the Olympic Club.
With Shipkey and Mahan on either side
of him, the left side of the line is strong
and unpliant.
Price and Anderson, former Long
Beach stars, make a pair of fast men at
center and guard, respectively. Price has
his hands full in the fight Natcher is
waging for the key position.
Shipkey and Greisscr at ends make a
well balanced team. Both are fast men
down the field under punts, and it is an
exceptional halfback that can get around
them on end runs.
