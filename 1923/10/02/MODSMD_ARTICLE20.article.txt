# CABBAGES and THINGS

Tonight, dear public, we are not going to regale you
with the story of the three Scotchmen who took shelter
from the rain in a church, and when the collection came
around, one fainted and the other two carried him out.
Neither will we arouse you to unseemly mirth with the
tale of the colored trooper who spent his first night in
the front-line trenches, nor of the two drunken men
who walked home with each other, back and forth,
all night. We will not even halt to tantalize your
jocular senses with the words by which the governor
of North Carolina addressed the governor of South
Carolina. The coquettish co-ed and the hapless frosh
will—almost —withhold themselves from beneath the
shadow of our scintillating scimitar. For we hereby
guarantee, knowing all men by these presents, that not
one cracy appearing in this colyum tonight will be of
rarer vinting than that fateful century when Christoforo
Colombo barked his little bark on the three-mile limit,
and the export of American tourists was still an infant
industry.
You will, of course, wonder what you will find at
which to loosen a hearty guffaw.
And there you will have to look further. It's a bit
subtle, as they say.
Every joke in this colyum tonight has no point to it;
the joke's on you, and that's NOTHING to laugh at.
Laugh that off! _ , _
