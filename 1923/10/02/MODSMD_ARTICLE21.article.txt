# BABES TO FACE SECOND YEAR MEN IN FIRST CLASS TUSSLE OF YEAR
## Standing-in-Line Contest Termed "Severe;" 
### 
Lower Classes Meet in Battle
Dope on the coming lower-class clash, in w®ch the
freshmen will for the first time meet their predecessors
of the Bloody Axe on the field of combat, bids fair to
be a forecast of one of the goriest he-man scrimmages
ever held in the Arboretum.
Three events compose the program for the afternoon.
The first, the Wrist-Slapping Tilt, augers to be the
bloodiest. One freshman and one sophomore are lined
up opposing each other, and take turns slapping each
other energetically on the wrist. Touching the wrist
watch penalizes the aggressor one yard, and whichever
class representative is by this method forced to give
way three miles is declared defeated.
Next comes the traditional Lollypop Rush, in which
both classes "mix in" using lollypops for weapons, to
haggle over the possession of a kiddie-kar. Candy canes
in this connection are barred.
What has been declared the most severe trial of
endurance is an innovation this year. This is the
Standing-in-Line Contest, in which the entire two classes
stad outside the Registrar's window, holding a fountain
pen and a check-book in oen hand, and a time schedule,
announcement of courses, and registration book, in the
other. The rages until all the members of one
class have fallen into a faint or gone off to the afternoon
tea at the Y. M. C. A.
HOW'S A BOY?
"Hello, old timer!"
"Why—uh—it's the kid himself! How awya?"
"Fine, how's yaself?"
' Pretty good, old high-life. Ya lookin' good."
"Yeh. Havva good time this summer?
"Oh, boy! Where was you?"
"Home. Where was you?"
"Home. Well, s'long, see ya 'gain."
"Sure. S'long, old timer."
(Both of them: "Now, who in blazes is that guy?")

LOCAL YOUTH HONORED
(From the Paloma Star-Courier, June 28)
Once more a member of our fair community has been
the recipient of recognition which the world tenders to
but few. Paloma and the Paloma Union High School is
proud that one of her sons will grace the roster of the
students attending Stanford University, located at
Berkeley, Calif. It has been announced that the appli
cation of Ferguson Bustard, of the Class of '26, has
been accepted with enthusiasm by the faculty of that
institution.
Ferguson will enter the halls of learning in the fall,
and will take with him the heartiest congratulations
and cheeriest wishes of the entire community of our
thriving township. Good luck, Ferg!

I was class president and chairman of the dramatic

"Those funny men with the funny axes on their hats
are simply glaring at us, Fergie!"
"That's all right, Nellie. They're probably mad be
cause a freshman is escorting such a pretty girl around
the dorm here."

"I don't know what 'queening' means, and anyways
most of the sophs are little short guys."
