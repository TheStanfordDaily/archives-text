# Morning Chapel Services Will Open Tomorrow
## 
### 
Morning chapel will be held in the
Memorial church tomorrow morning at
7:50 for the first time this year, it was
announced today by Dr. D. Charles Gard
ner, University chaplain.
These morning services, consisting of
a short service with an address by the
chaplain, are held daily throughout the
college year. They begin at 7 :50, and end
in ample time for students to reach their
first lectures. The short period of wor
ship preceding the work of the day has
come to be one of Stanford's valued tra
ditions, harking back to the time when
the services were held in what is now the
Little Theater, and were frequently at
tended by Senator and Mrs. Stanford.
