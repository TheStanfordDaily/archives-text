of 120 enraged students broke through
the railings surrounding the building
and took forcible possession of the
foodstuffs. "Rotten food" and "impu
dent service" were the reasotis given
by the ringleaders of the "mob" for
their drastic action. The cafeteria has
beer, tinder student management for
the last year. Most of the students
