# STANFORD "Y" MEN ON DECK TO HELP ALL NEW STUDENTS
## 
### 
The Stanford Y. M. C. A. cabinet met
yesterday at Los Altos for the annual
cabinet conference and plans for the
biggest and most successful year of
"Y" activity were made.
As has been the custom in the past,
the "Y" again put out the freshman
"bible" this year. This is just one way
in which they try every year to help
the new Stanford men "on the boat."
A series of assemblies for new stu
dents is also being planned and stu
dent speakers and members of the
faculty will tell them of Stanford tra-;
ditions and ideals.
Today members of the "Y" were on
deck to help the members of '27 get
settled on the campus and get their
year started right on registration day.
According to the secretaries, they want
the new men to feel that it is their
organization and is working to help
them in every way. They are anxious
that the new men come in and make j
the acquaintance of the officers, wheth-j
er or not they need any immediate;
help of any kind.
