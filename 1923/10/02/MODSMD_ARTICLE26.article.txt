# SEVENTY PRINCETON FOOTBALL MEN REPORT
## 
### 
PRINCETON, N. J.â€”Over 70 candi
date's for varsity football reported for
practice on September 17th. A compari
tively green squad must be whipped into
shape by Coach W. W. Roper by October
6, when the Tigers will exhibit their pig
skin prowess for the benefit of the Johns-
Hopkins eleven. Backfield material is by
no means lacking but line men of expe
rience are a minus quality. A regime of
liard work and secret practice will be in
force until November 17th when the Yale
game will be played in the Yale Bowl.
