# FEDERAL COURSES END AT SOUTHERN BRANCH OF U. C.
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
SOUTHERN BRANCH.—The Univer
sity of California, Southern Branch, will
no longer train ex-service men, it was
announced by President W. \V. Camp
bell. This action was unexpected inas
much as the University had contracted to
train the men for another year.
Following complaints from a govern
ment official to the effect that too much
time was being taken to teach various
courses, the university heads replied that
the training would have to be discon
tinued unless the university was given
complete authority in the education of
the men. Since this was not satisfactory,
the order was issued to cancel all plans
for Federal courses.
Following the American Legion pro
test to government officials the latter
agreed to pursue a "hands off" policy. By
that time, however, other arrangements
had been made by the University, and the
decision could not be changed. The Fed
eral class has been dissolved and the
veterans have decamped to various parts,
since no other placc to study has been
provided for them as yet.
