"ROUGED LIPS," Varsity Theater, Palo Alto.
According to Mitchell, cinematic critic for LIFE, the
movies have taken a turn for the better. Someone has
sown the seeds of Art broadcast in Hollywood, and the
fall pictures are the blossoms. Alack and alas! Here
in Palo Alto no rumor of blossoming has been received;
in fact, it is doubtful if it is known that the ground has
been harrowed for the sowing.
"Rouged Lips" is an ante-harvest picture. The scenario
writer provides a convenient vehicle for Miss Dana's
usual petite type of acting, but it is a vehicle without a
steering wheel, and runs hither and yon quite carelessly.
The audience is quite surprised that such an indirectly
steered affair should arrive at the usual happy ending.
An altogether usual picture, nothing to get excited
about one way or the other.

"SIX DAYS," Granada Theater, San Francisco.
(To commence October 6.)
Personally, six days, as Miss Glyn dishes up for her
hero and heroines, would be rather yearing. One would
not be at all surprised if the hero, on the seventh day,
having contemplated his work and found it good, rested.
In fact, a long vacation would have been excusable.
"Six Days" has action. It plays on the emotion; and
we use the singular advnsedly, because the one emotion
always used by Eleanor Glyn predominates. We were
chiefly impressed by the settings and photography, both
of which are unusual.
The excuse of seeing "Six Days" is Paul Ash. His
half-hours of music are packing the Granada each eve
ning, and on October 6 a special program is to be pre
sented, introducing a new leader from New York. Per
sonally. we are going to be there.
