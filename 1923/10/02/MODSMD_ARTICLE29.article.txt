TOPSY AND EVA
(Alcazar Theater, San Francisco)
"Topsy and Eva" is a musical comedy, and the title
gives the whole darn thing away. Go to see Topsy and
Eva (the Duncan sisters) and you won't be disappointed.
Go to see a well-built cast and then try and get your
money back at the box office. Yes, just try it!
A Cast of Two
Anyway, the Duncan sisters are still packing the
Alcazar, and the public still goes away without having
noticed the cast much except when the Duncan sisters
weren't to be seen on stage or heard off in the wings, and
every day the two female comedy stars of the country
romp through their three acts and convulse new audi
ences and seem to get as much fun out of it as the
audiences.
That's the cast: the Duncan sisters.
Also, we noticed, the music. Oh, yes, written by them,
too. And mostly sung by them. We don't remember
having heard twelve encores before hearing Topsy and
Eva in "Do Ray Me;" but then, we don't remember
having heard even ten before hearing them sing "Um
Da Dum."
An Automatic Chorus
The two comic artists are not very evident in the
chorus work, but that is excused by the fact that it
would be numerically impossible for two stars to be a
whole chorus. Nevertheless, after having watched cam
pus choruses in an agony of apprehension of their next
move, it was a relief to see the trained syncopation of
the Topsys and Evas. And they didn't have any chorus
men! To our mind the biggest improvement in the
musical comedy in years. Not that we want to be rough
on the chorus men! No, not very.
