# FENCERS WILL START PRACTICE NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney will start work
with his fencers the first of next week.
Gardner, one of last year's stars, has re
ported already and will help Maloney
with the new men during the year. Ma
loney has a habit of developing good!
fencers and if a few of last year's men
return Stanford should have a fencing
team second to none on the coast.
It is possible that a dual meet will be 1
arranged with the Olympic club and with
other fencing organizations around the
bay. In spring vacation the team will take j
its annual trip to Los Angeles where it;
will meet the Los Angeles athletic club i
and the Hollywood fencers.
