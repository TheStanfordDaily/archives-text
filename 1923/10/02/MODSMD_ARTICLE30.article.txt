by the Student Council at its last meet
ing, the California Pep Band, suggested
by Student Body President Lcs Cummins,

director of the band and chairman of an
assembly committee to furnish entertain
ment for all calls.
Immediately upon his appointment' as
director, Beall issued a call for musicians
to report for tryouts. The work of or
ganization will begin immediately, in or
der that the players may be available for
the coming football rallies and other stu

dent activities, including dances and vaude

such caliber as to reflect credit upon the
University.

players in his organization: Two cor
nets, one slide trombone, one baritone, one
bass tuba, two clarinets, three horns in F,
one French horn, one trap drummer, one
