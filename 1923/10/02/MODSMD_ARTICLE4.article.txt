## Dramatic Composition Class Will Write Plays for Theater Workshop

Followers of the college theater will
will have three courses dealing with
the drama and stage at their disposal

turned from a leave of absence, will
again give lectures in the history of the
theater, and will conduct a class in thea
ter workshop. Professor H. D. Gray is
offering a course in dramatic composition.
The history of the theater will be a
two-hour course dealing with the origin
and evolution of the modern stage. As
a diversion from the usual line of de
velopment. Davis plans to incorporate as
much of the oriental theater as is pos

knowledge gained on his travels.
In the theater workshop Davis intends
to follow much the same lines as for
merly. Members of the class will learn
all about actual stagecraft by doing the
practical work on all campus productions.
Sets, lights, properties, and costumes will
all be constructed by the class under the
direct supervision of the stage manager,
electrician and property man. In this
way Davis plans to give the students a
working knowledge of what goes on be
hind the curtain in the theater of today.
The thfatci workshop class will, dur
ing the quarter, go thoroughly into the
research of plays of past periods as re
gards to costumcs, sets, properties and
lighting. At the end of the quarter, the
class will present to the public two or
three one-act plays or an entire play,
doing all the work of production them
selves.
With these one-act plays, Davis in
tends to work in collaboration with Pro
fessor H. D. Gray's class in dramatic
composition. Full expression in student
plays is what these two instructors hope
to bring about in their classes. Plays
written in Professor Gray's class will be
produced by the theater workshop class.
Coach Davis will also consider plays writ
ten by other students and the best ones
will be presented in December.
