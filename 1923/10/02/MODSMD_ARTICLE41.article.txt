TON.—That $22,000,000,000 were spent
last year for paint, powder, cosmetics,
gum and candy in the United States, was
the statement of U. S. Commissioner of
Education John G. Tigert in a talk at the
State College of Washington recently, in
which he quoted statistics he had gathered
to show that the propaganda against tax
ation for educational purposes was un
warranted and all superficial thinking.
"Last year the United States spent one
billion fifty million dollars for education;
less than one-seventieth of the national
wealth. But last year we also spent $800,-
000,000 for factory-made cigarettes alone
—and that docs not count those smoked
by those who roll their—stockings!" said
Mr. Tigert. "For the women are getting
their share of the tobacco now, and in
many places in the east, more than their
share. For cigars we spent last year
$510,000,000: add to this all the tobacco
used in pipes and otherwise and you have
a vast sum.
