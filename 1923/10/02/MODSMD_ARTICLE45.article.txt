# IDAHO FOOTBALL SQUAD IS DARK HORSE OF CONFERENCE
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Idaho. â€” "The Vandals
from Idaho will be the sensation, the sur
prise, the stumbling block of the Pacific
Coast conference. Idaho will spring the
biggest surprise in the history of western
football by defeating the University of
California." This is the opinion of
George Varnell of Spokane and Maxwell
Stiles, sporting editor of the Los An
geles Examiner. Idaho will have virtu
ally the same team as last year and a
wealth of material is coming in from the
1922 freshman team. The Vandals will
set a precedent for the west in playing
three regularly scheduled conference
games in succession without returning to
the home field. Oregon Aggies will be
their first opponents, and Stanford and U.
S. C. follow in succession.
