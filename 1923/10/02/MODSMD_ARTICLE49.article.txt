# U. OF C. SOUTHERN BRANCH SEEKS WOMEN MUSICIANS
## 
### 
Pep and the ability to play some other
instrument than the piano are the only
requisites for membership in the Wo
men's Jazz Orchestra of the University
of California southern branch.
New members are being eagerly sought
since only two members of the 1922 or
chestra returned to the campus this fall.
A lengthy program has already been ar
ranged for the orchestra, which was ex
pected to play at the opening Women's
Assembly.
