# RECORD NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS APPLYING FOR JOBS
## 
### 
The fall quarter at Stanford University
began today with more students than ever
before signed up at the employment of
fice for miscellaneous employment which,
in many cases, must be secured at once
if the applicants are to be able to finance
their way through college for the full
quarter.
"We never had such a large list of
applicants for jobs here before," said
Mrs. Elizabeth B. Snell, appointment sec
retary, today in commenting on the situa
tion. "As an indication of the problem,"
she continued, "there are 400 students on
the waiting list for jobs as waiters at the
Stanford Union, while there are jobs
available there for only about twenty
men."
It is possible, according to Mrs. Snell,
for help of practically all kinds to be
secured at the university employment of
fice. While all of the applicants are eager
for work that will bring in cash, there
are many eager for jobs in payment for
rooms or board, especially for rooms.
As many of the men must know at once
what their chances of finding work are,
Mrs. Snell suggests that Palo Altans and
campus people having anything to offer,
notify her at once.
Waiters, chauffeurs, gardeners, house
cleaners, clerks, tutors, and many other
kinds of help can be secured from the
employment office's lists. Steady work is
especially desired by the students.
