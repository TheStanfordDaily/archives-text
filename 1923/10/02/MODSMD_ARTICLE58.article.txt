# SCHOOLS' DUTY TO GIVE TOOLS OF UNDERSTANDING
## 
### 
"It is the duty of the schools and
the teacher to give young people the tools
of understanding and to enable them to
use them," said Dr. F. R. Nalder, d.irector
of general extension at the State College j
â–¡f Washington, in addressing the teachers 1
at an institute on the Sound recently.
He quoted James' definition of educa-1
tion: "An educated man is one who has j
his intellectual resources so well organ- i
ized that he is not nonplussed by the rise j
of extraordinary circumstances."
If many people are able to keep their
base in the extraordinary circumstances
which arise today, he said, it is because
the schools have taught them how to do
so.
