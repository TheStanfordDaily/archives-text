# SWORD AND SANDALS WILL MEET TONIGHT
## 
### 
A meeting of Sword and Sandals,
with Gordon Davis, dramatic director,
will be held this evening at 7:30 in the
Green Room to consider the society's
annual presentation.
The Sword and Sandals production
is by custom the first play given in
the autumn quarter, and considerable
interest hangs on the play this year,
as it is the first presentation offered
since Davis's return.
