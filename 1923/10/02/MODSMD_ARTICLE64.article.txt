# TEXAS STUDENTS TO PAY CAMPUS ACTIVITIES FEES
## 
### 
Students at the University of Texas
were to be given an opportunity at the
time of fall registration to pay a blanket
tax of ten dollars and a half for activities
fees. The tax payment was to be made
voluntary, those students desiring to make
payments to do so while matriculating.
The tax will cover all campus activities
from the intramural and interclass ath
letic contests to the cost of the campus
papers and publications. Apportionment
of the tax to the various organizations
benefiting from it will be made at the
spring meeting of the students' assembly.
The assembly will receive a small portion
of the tax to pay for the services of a
secretary.
Women's organizations, oratorical so
cieties, and many other campus activities
will receive their share of the tax.
