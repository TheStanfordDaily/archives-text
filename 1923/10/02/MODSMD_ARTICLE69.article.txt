# BRITISH ARCHITECT PRAISES BEAUTY OF STANFORD BUILDINGS
## 
### 
"Stanford has the most distinguished
college architecture in the United
States, and the most individual in the
world." This statement summarizes the
views expressed by R. C. Handley,
noted British architect who visited
the campus this summer during a tour
of American universities.
"The unity of the whole plan is what
especially appeals to the outsider,"
said Handley. "Most of your large
American colleges have a rambling
half-hearted plan of liappy-go-lucky
architecture that is added onto and
changed from time to time until the
completed result is anything but pleas
ing in an artistic sense. But you at
Stanford have succeeded in maintain
ing a harmony of appearance that
places your University, I believe, at
the head of American institutions in
this respect."
Handley spoke of the British type of
university that gains its chief charm
from the marks of long use and hal
lowed traditions. American universi
ties, he declared, had not been in ex
istence long enough to create the ne
cessary atmosphere of "almost antiqui
ty;" but Stanford, he added, "although
only thirty years old, has the appear
ance of being well established for
twice that length of time. Again it is
the unity of style that is the dominat
ing feature in this effect."
Handley stated it as his belief that
western universities were in advance
of middle-west and eastern institutions
in respect to artistic regard for archi
tecture, "excepting possible Princeton,
DePauw and Tulane." The fact that
room to carry out a systematized plan
is more available in this section of
the country was given as the chief
cause for this state of affairs.
Scientific arrangement of the cam
pus of a university is being studied in
England at present, Handley asserted.
"How students may get from class to
class with the minimum of time and
trouble is a problem that grows more
acute as the present-day universities

change," said the British architect.
"Beauty alone can not be the chief fac
tor in aranging buildings. Much time is
wasted in many of our big universities
â€¢ today because of poor location of class
rooms." Handley added that, in his
opinion, Stanford was further ad
vanced than the average American uni
versity in this respect.
