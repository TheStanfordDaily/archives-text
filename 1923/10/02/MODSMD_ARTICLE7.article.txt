# Corduroy Road Vanishes; Roble Bridge Intact
## 
### 
Politics mixed with petting, the power
of the Press, and here's how it all caßiie
about.
Last year a feature story appeared in
the Daily Palo Alto, always an instru
ment of refonn and uplift, decrying the
spring-shattering billows on the County
Road toward Portola. It seemed that
there was a dispute under way between
the counties of San Mateo and Santa
Clara, the former insisting that the road
run via old Roble Bridge, and the latter
holding out for the present location. The
result was —no pavement!
Imagine the mooßi-lit strolls which
would be shattered by blaring flivvers
and frivolous motorists! Possibly even
a punctured romance. Perhaps the Santa
Clara supervisors used some such an
argument.
Anyhow, the money has been voted, the
contract has been let, and work is actually
under way on the old, old stretch of cor
duroy. Over toward Roble bridge the
turtle-doves may coo and Cupid may lurk
unmolested, while the long-suffering de
tourist may pursue his seraie way over
the other more receßit route.
And so, following slightly the yellow
newspapers, we gloat!
