# CHIEF DUGAN WILL AIM AT LOW FIRE HAZARD ON CAMPUS
## 
### Walt Campbell, '26 
A fire department that is representa
tive of the Universityâ€”such is Chief
Robert Dugan'a aim for Stanford Uni
versity. "My aim is to keep the stand
ard of this department up to that of
the city departments, and to keep the
fire hazard down," said Chief Dugan in
an interview this morning.
Chief Dugan is a grizzled, unassum
ing veteran in the fire-fighting service.
He has 18 years of stainless record
behind him, during his service for the
San Francisco corps.
Dugan is now a pensioned member
of the San Francisco department, due
to injuries received in service. While
answering the call to duty, he was
caught between a streetcar and a hose
cart, being severely hurt. Today h<?
carries a stiff leg for life, as a little
remembrance fo the event. It was this
fact of the stiff leg that induced Du
gan to leave the active service and
seek his pension, which he obtained
with little difficulty. Says Dugan: "The
risk in climbing on to the tops of
buildings became too great, owing to
my lame leg. A fireman in a city de
partment must have the use of every
faculty. when answering the call of
fire."
During the Spanish-American War,
Dugan served his country in the ca
pacity of a sailor. He was attached to
the famous battleship "Oregon," and
was present during the historic cruise
around Cape Horn, when the "Oregon"
raced from her shipyards on the Pa

cific coast to take part in the Battle
of San Diego: The "Oregon" made the
hard cruise in about 65 days, which
was remarkable for its time. The aver
age vessel only makes the trip in 55
days today.
In his younger days, Chief Dugan
was an actor of parts, as well as being
somewhat of an acrobat. He is of
enormous build, and clearly shows his
athletic training.
According to Chief Dugan, the per
sonal hazard to the fireman is in
creasing, although the fire hazard in
our modern cities is about the same
as ten years ago. There are many more
accidents today, with motor-driven ve
hicles than in the days when horse
drawn firo engines were in vogue. The
excessive speed at which a fire engine
must travel, and the congested streets
of a city render the trip to the fire a
dangerous one.
As Dugan says, the fireman today
must undergo a rigorous training. Rope
climbing, ladder work, jumping into a
net, and vaulting are but a few items
on the training program. To be equip
ped to safeguard the public from loss
of property and life, a fireman must
have control of every faculty. An ath
letic body, clear eyesight, a rapid mind,
and a steady coolness even in the most
trying conditions are absolutely re
quisite. Clean living and well-formed
habits make for an efficient public
guarian.
