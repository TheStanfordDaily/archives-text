# FOUR NEW FOOTBALL FIELDS TO BE READY FOR SEASON MONDAY
## 
### 
Beginning Monday, October 8, the four
new football fields located just west of
the men's tennis courts will resound with
the thud of punted footballs and the
clashing of husky moleskin clad gridders.
Interclass football will get under full
swing and last until the week just before
the "big game."
The program for interclass football as
outlined by C. \V. Davis, intramural and
minor sport director, will differ slightly
from the one follow'ed last year. The
games will be played on the round robin
basis, each class team playing three
games. Because of the large number of
candidates expected to turn out. second
team games will probably be played as
well as the first team games. This system
is expected to create a spirit of keen
spirit of competition and to arouse class
interest in interclass football.
As soon as class coaches and managers
have been appointed by the class presi
dents. the men will be divided according
to ability and experience and issued foot
ball equipment. This will be done some
time during the present week, and by
Monday light practice should get under
way. The first three weeks will be de
voted to choosing permanent squads and
getting the men in condition for the first
games, which will start the last week of
October.
All lower division students who are re
quired to take physical education or sports
will be given the same credit for taking
interclass football.
Last year there was a good deal of con
tusion arising over the difficulty of finding
suitable fields for the different teams to
practice. To avoid that situation this
year, four new fields have been made
especially for the interclass teams. Each
team will be given a definite field for its
use and there should be no mix-ups over
practice room.
The class team winning the interclass
football championship will secure a leg
on the interclass silver trophy. Last year
the seniors were the victors.

Princeton students will get a rousing, j
rising welcome each morning at 7 o'clock j
during the school year. A bell will ring i
for three minutes daily in which time it
is expected all students will be thoroughly I
awakened.
