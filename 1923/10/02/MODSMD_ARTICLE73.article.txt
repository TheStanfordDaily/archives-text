# MICHIGAN FRESHMAN SHOWS AMBITION, TRIES TO BUY "M"
## 
### 
Ambition is a great thing. At least
that is what one freshman at the Uni
versity of Michigan believes, who so
liked the appearance of a varsity foot
ball "M" sweater that he calmly
walked into a local haberdashery shop
and asked if he might buy one. At the
refusal his disappointment was great,
but it all goes to show that a green
look can't keep a man from at least
trying for the thing he wants when he
wants it.
