# Banned Bathtubs Found on Campus; Roth Responsible
## 
### 
J he poreclain bathtub, banned for 10,
these many years by University authori
ties, still exists in University buildings.
This was the disclosure made yesterday
by Comptroller A. E. Roth in the course
of an inspection trip of the new Toyon
Hall.
Iwo of the forbidden fixtures have
been installed by order of Roth. One is
in the new Union, the other in Toyon
Hall. Both are installed as a part of the
equipment of guest rooms in the two halls,
where returning alumni and guests of the
University are lodged.
1 he tubs are kept carefully guarded
behind locked doors except when the guest
rooms are occupied, in order that the
Ã¼biquitous student may not use them for
purposes not intended by nature and the
authorities. Bathtubs fell into disfavor
some years ago, when the tubbing of
freshmen came to be too much of a habit.
By official order, all bath tubs in dormi
tories and fraternities were replaced by
the cleanly and harmless shower.
According to Roth, the two remaining
tubs have not been and never will be
used for drowning purposes. Tubbing
parties, even in the celebrated Mayfield
horse trough, are no longer considered
good form, and as the result of an inten
sive campaign waged last spring against
hazing, those taking part in such enter
tainments are liable to severe disciplinary
measures.
