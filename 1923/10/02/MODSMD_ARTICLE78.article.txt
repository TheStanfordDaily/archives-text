# FOOTBALL CLASSES GOOD AT W. S. C.
## 
### 
The scrimmage mill on Rogers
Feld is now turning out real football men
for the crimson and gray team, accord
ing to side-line enthusiasts at the State
College of Washington.
Rudy Mathers of Hillyard, looked on
as a likely prospect the first week and a
half of training, tore into the first scrim
mage like a house afire, and showed that
he is made of good football stuff. He is
small, weighing only 160 pounds, but is
well built, and is a "back" of great driv
ing power. He made a record for him
self durin gthe war on the Great Lakes
navy team, playing against some of the
best men in the country, and has already
made it plain that he is going to deliver
the goods for Exendine this fall.
