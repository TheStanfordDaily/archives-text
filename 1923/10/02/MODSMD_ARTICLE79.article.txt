# PROSPECTS FOR CHICAGO UNIVERSITY ARE GOOD
## 
### 
Prospects for the Maroons of Chicago
University are exceptionally good this
fall, according to Coach Stagg, who is
entering upon his thirty-second campaign
as mentor of the Midway machine. Fifty
men have turned out in suits and at least
a dozen more are expected by next week.

Dartmouth football opens under a new
regime this year. New men must be
developed for practically all of the im
portant positions. The team is coached
by Coach Jess Hawley, Jack Cannell, and
other graduates of the university.
