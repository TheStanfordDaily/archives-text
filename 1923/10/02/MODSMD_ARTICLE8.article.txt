# POSTER FIGHT TO BE EAGUNITA MUD CRAWL
## Battle of Slime Is Temporary Plan for Underclassmen's Battle Next Thursday 
### 
The annual "Poster Fight" in which
the fiery waters of Searsville played the
leading role, is a thing of the past and
j lies buried with other battles of the
j 'good old days."
Rules governing a new frosh-soph bat
| tie, to take place during daylight hours
| and to be followed by a weiner-roast in
j the foothills for the two classes, are be
ing prepared by a committee composed of
the sponsors of Encina Hall. At a meet
' ing of this group tonight, final details of
the new plan will be decided, it was
j announced today.
Tentative plans prepared by Tom Ir
! win, '23, have been accepted with a few
! changes by the committee. According to
these plans the fight will be held in the
; bed of Lagunita at 3 o'clock Thursday
- afternoon, and will consist of a "mud
j battle." The two classes will probably go
| into camp before the fight. Trenches of
mud and slush will be provided in the lake
! bed, and as the opposing sides clash they
! will endeavor to initiate one another into
the "order of the bath." Whether or not
a tug-of-war will play a part in the con
test is not yet known, nor has it been
announced whether or not the commit
tee will retain the old "rush" or tie-up
following the first battle.
No definite time has been set for the
| placing of the posters by the '26 class,
| but they claim that '27 will see them soon
I enough and often enough.
It has been suggested by some that the
! committee in charge of the "mud fight"
provide each class with a number of head
stones, and instead of digging up the
i unfortunate "neophytes" the headstones
i be erected over the mud hole. This plan
would save considerable excavating, and
i would still provide a lasting tribute to
; those who "gave till it hurt."
Several other fights were suggested but
! none met with the approval of those in
charge. No definite and lasting substi
! tute for the old Poster Fights has been
discovered as yet, but the Sponsor Com-
I mittee is endeavoring to work out one
! that will be acceptable to all concerned.
Definite plans for this year's battle will
jbe announced tomorrow, following to
! night's meeting of the committee.
