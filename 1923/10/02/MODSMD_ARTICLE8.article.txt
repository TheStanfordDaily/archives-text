# POSTER FIGHT TO BE EAGUNITA MUD CRAWL
## Battle of Slime Is Temporary Plan for Underclassmen's Battle Next Thursday 
### 
The annual "Poster Fight" in which
the fiery waters of Searsville played the
leading role, is a thing of the past and
lies buried with other battles of the
"good old days."
Rules governing a new frosh-soph bat
tle, to take place during daylight hours
and to be followed by a wiener-roast in
j the foothills for the two classes, are be
ing prepared by a committee composed of
the sponsors of Encina Hall. At a meet
ing of this group tonight, final details of
the new plan will be decided, it was
announced today.
Tentative plans prepared by Tom Ir
win, '23, have been accepted with a few
changes by the committee. According to
these plans the fight will be held in the
bed of Lagunita at 3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon, and will consist of a "mud
battle." The two classes will probably go
into camp before the fight. Trenches of
mud and slush will be provided in the lake
bed, and as the opposing sides clash they
will endeavor to initiate one another into
the "order of the bath." Whether or not
a tug-of-war will play a part in the con
test is not yet known, nor has it been
announced whether or not the commit
tee will retain the old "rush" or tie-up
following the first battle.
No definite time has been set for the
placing of the posters by the '26 class,
but they claim that '27 will see them soon
enough and often enough.
It has been suggested by some that the
committee in charge of the "mud fight"
provide each class with a number of head
stones, and instead of digging up the
unfortunate "neophytes" the headstones
be erected over the mud hole. This plan
would save considerable excavating, and
would still provide a lasting tribute to
those who "gave till it hurt."
Several other fights were suggested but
none met with the approval of those in
charge. No definite and lasting substi
tute for the old Poster Fights has been
discovered as yet, but the Sponsor Com-
mittee is endeavoring to work out one
that will be acceptable to all concerned.
Definite plans for this year's battle will
jbe announced tomorrow, following to
night's meeting of the committee.

afternoon, and will consist of a "mud
battle." The two classes will probably go
into camp before the fight. Trenches of
mud and slush will be provided in the lake
bed, and as the opposing sides clash they
will endeavor to initiate one another into
the "order of the bath." Whether or not
a tug-of-war will play a part in the con
test is not yet known, nor has it been
announced whether or not the commit
tee will retain the old "rush" or tie-up
following the first battle.
No definite time has been set for the
placing of the posters by the '26 class,
but they claim that '27 will see them soon
enough and often enough.
It has been suggested by some that the
committee in charge of the "mud fight"
provide each class with a number of head
stones, and instead of digging up the
unfortunate "neophytes" the headstones
be erected over the mud hole. This plan
would save considerable excavating, and
would still provide a lasting tribute to
those who "gave till it hurt."
Several other fights were suggested but
none met with the approval of those in
charge. No definite and lasting substi
tute for the old Poster Fights has been
discovered as yet, but the Sponsor Com-
mittee is endeavoring to work out one
that will be acceptable to all concerned.
Definite plans for this year's battle will
jbe announced tomorrow, following to
night's meeting of the committee.
