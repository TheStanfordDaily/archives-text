## 
### 
HANOVER, N. H, Sept. 26.—A sort
ing and shifting of available material
practically unequalled in Dartmouth foot
ball history is occupying the opening
weeks of the Green's campaign under
head Coach Jesse Hawley. The prevail
ing lack of veterans and the advent of a
new master of ceremonies in the person
of Hawley has necessitated a thorough
testing of each candidate's abilities. New
positions for several of last year's fresh
man eleven are certain while former mem
bers of the varsity squad will also be as
signed new duties to bolster up weak
spots now existing.
Dartmouth has a difficult schedule this
season and will require a stiff grilling to
come out of it successful. Late in the
season Dartmouth will play Harvard at
the Harvard stadium for the second time
in recent years.
