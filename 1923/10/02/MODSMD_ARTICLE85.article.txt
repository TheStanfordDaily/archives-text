# Harvard Varsity Begins Strenuous Practice Work

### 
HA RVA R D UNIVERSITY.—Speed
was the keynote of the work for the
136 Harvard varsity football candidates
this morning, and when the big squad
finally trooped into the locker building
after the forenoon grilling there was a
general and loudly expressed opinion that
the hardest kind of football work would
be preferable to this conditioning grind.
Which proves that the conditioning grind,
as directed by Trainer Donovan and
Coach James L. Knox in the forenoon
sessions is having the desired results.
Something new in the Harvard scheme
of things was introduced this morning
when the clean, white skipping ropes
which have been decorating the man
agerial supply wagons since early in the
week were ordered into play. The squad
presented an unusual appearance as the
men skipped blithely around the field,
"jumping rope." The well-known and
not too popular "duck-waddle" also
played a prominent part in the program,
which was topped off by a few minutes
of intensive work with the kickers.
The session was the most strenuous of
the week, but so carefully has the work
been handled that the men are in uni
formly good condition, and with the start
of a new week will be ready for a real
football. The first cut in the squad will
probably be made after this evening's
practice, with approximately 60 players
retained on the varsity roster.
