# VAUGHN HOSEPIAN, LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMP, WILL COACH MATMEN
## 
### 
Vau g a n Hosepian, intercollegiate
lightweight wrestling champion, his re
turned to school this year, and while he
will not be eligible lor wrestling he will
take charge of the Stanford wrestlers and
try to turn out a winning team. Hosepian
has been the mainstay of the team for the
past three years and his absence will be
keenly felt.
Stanford is up against a tough propo
sition in wrestling with a team entirely
lacking in stars. There are plenty of
mediocre and fair-to-middling matmen
at school, together with considerable
green material, and it will be Hosepians
job to mould this into a team which can
win a majority of the matches in the
California meet.
California won a one-sided victory last
year, Hosepian being the only Redshirt to
make a first class showing. With him
gone, things look far from good, but it
is probable that something can be devel
oped which will be a credit to the school.
