BLACK AS THE ACE OF SPADES — SMOOTH AS A POLISHED JEWEL
First Pen made Q
for Students only i|B
Designed by Geo. S. Parker fj 1
for their special needs
and made by Duofold craftsmen—- If H
yet offered at only $3 H ■
JUST as the Parker Duofold and Lady H I
Duofold are recognized as the aristocrats II I
of pens priced at $5 and higher, so this new HI ■
Parker D. Q. is the blue-blood of pens in [flBlill"
the medium-priced class. Indeed the same
crafts-guild that produces Parker Duofold
makes this Parker D. Q. that we announce j| j
at only $3. 1818 I
Parker designed this pen based on a lifTJ
study of the students' requirements and
desires. Hence it's a pen that is practically |3a|
made to the students' order. We know of |Bj|§pi
no other with this special ring to link to |||a||||
note-book, and no other this size under $5
with a special metal girdle to reinforce the Jlß|f 31
cap. Yet no extra charge is made for these Ip* fjl
features, or for the super-smooth point of {(jig ||l
14k gold tipped with Native Iridium. |Eh||
Insist on seeing this new creation. Any JftiiSff
good pen counter can supply you, but look
carefully for the stamp of the genuine,
"Geo. S. Parker—Lucky Curve." i
