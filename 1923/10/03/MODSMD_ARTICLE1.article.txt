# AMATEUR THEATRE IN ORIENT SHOWS FINE SPIRIT--DAVIS
## Dramatic Director Returns With Vivid Impression of Amateur Theatricals in East 
### James Muir, '25 
"The amateur stage in the Orient
has been developed to a high degree of
excellence," reports Gordon Davis,
Stanford dramatic coach, who has late
ly returned from an extended tour of
the Far East. "We found a tremendous J
amount of enthusiasm in amateur
theatricals, both native and English,
all through our travels," he says.
"All the oriental and Indian cities;
have large European sections and of
these the art and social center is the
theater. This is really a large, magnifi
cent public hall with reception rooms
for the state functions, banquet halls,
ballrooms, and in one wing is the,
theater proper.
"To these theaters come traveling
European companies that are sent outj
regularly from London on tour. It is
exceptional for an American company)
to visit these places." Pavlowa and
Mischa Ellman had been on tours just
ahead of Davis's company.
The transient London and American!
players do not visit the oriental cities i
too frequently so the English, Ameri
can and native residents are thrown
back on their own resources for
dramatic entertainment, according to
Davis. Consequently they have finely
organized A. D. C.'s (Amateur Dra
matic Companies).
"The A. D. C.'s," says Davis, "are ;
the ones that control the large theaters
in the European sections and make
them really community centers. They
have large costume rooms filled with
splendid costumes and materials, green
rooms with large libraries, rehearsal
rooms, and property rooms. These are
all locked up and closed to the travel
ing companies, being solely for their j
own amateur productions.
"One interesting thing that we no
ticed," remarked Davis, "was that the
theater lobbies, instead of being hung
with pictures of famous professional
actors as is customary in America,
were filled with likenesses of cele
brated amateurs of their own number.
