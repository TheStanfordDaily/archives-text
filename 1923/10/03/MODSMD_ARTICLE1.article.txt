# AMATEUR THEATRE IN ORIENT SHOWS FINE SPIRIT--DAVIS
## Dramatic Director Returns With Vivid Impression of Amateur Theatricals in East 
### James Muir, '25 
"The amateur stage in the Orient
has been developed to a high degree of
excellence," reports Gordon Davis,
Stanford dramatic coach, who has late
ly returned from an extended tour of
the Far East. "We found a tremendous J
amount of enthusiasm in amateur
theatricals, both native and English,
all through our travels," he says.
"All the oriental and Indian cities;
have large European sections and of
these the art and social center is the
theater. This is really a large, magnifi
cent public hall with reception rooms
for the state functions, banquet halls,
ballrooms, and in one wing is the,
theater proper.
"To these theaters come traveling
European companies that are sent outj
regularly from London on tour. It is
exceptional for an American company)
to visit these places." Pavlowa and
Mischa Ellman had been on tours just
ahead of Davis's company.
The transient London and American!
players do not visit the oriental cities i
too frequently so the English, Ameri
can and native residents are thrown
back on their own resources for
dramatic entertainment, according to
Davis. Consequently they have finely
organized A. D. C.'s (Amateur Dra
matic Companies).
"The A. D. C.'s," says Davis, "are ;
the ones that control the large theaters
in the European sections and make
them really community centers. They
have large costume rooms filled with
splendid costumes and materials, green
rooms with large libraries, rehearsal
rooms, and property rooms. These are
all locked up and closed to the travel
ing companies, being solely for their j
own amateur productions.
"One interesting thing that we no
ticed," remarked Davis, "was that the
theater lobbies, instead of being hung
with pictures of famous professional
actors as is customary in America,
were filled with likenesses of cele
brated amateurs of their own number.
The place of honor in the Shanghai
theater held the picture of a venerable
old Chinaman who had been stage
manager for a long period of years.
The oriental theaters are filled with
such memories and are veritable bee
hives of amateur enthusiasm.
"In Calcutta we sat in the royal box
and saw the English amateurs put on
their Christmas Pageant, a glorified
Junior Opera. It was one of the most
excellent and tremendously successful
plays that we saw. They had devoted
all of six months to rehearsing and the
actual stage production was perfect in
every detail. They even went so far as
to have a fully-equipped airplane on
the stage which was made to fly by
being raised up while a background of
clouds rushed past. This play was put
on for sheer amusement, was scream
ingly funny, and the house was packed
for weeks.
"It was also in Calcutta that we saw
a production by Tagore and his Cal
cutta University amateur players.
These were all Hindoos. This produc
tion was more modern than the usual j
amateur theatricals put on by the (
A. D. C.'s in that it was more simple.)
yet more beautiful in costume and,
color effects. It was far more moving i
and appealing than the other more
commercialized and old-time plays.
"The most interesting and gripping
thing I saw in all the Orient was this
play put on by, university students as
at Stanford. It seemed to presage the
modern spirit of the drama and went
to show that it is the effect which
university training has on the profes
sion which will raise it to the highest
plane in the future.
"Shanghai we found to be about
fifty-fifty American and English and
they all met in common in their ama
teur productions. Manila was purely
modern American, and there we found
the only Little Theater movement
among amateurs. Led by a New York
woman, they have a splendid spirit,
although as yet they are not so well
organized as the A. D. C.
"At Tokyo we played in the Imperial
Hotel, which contained a splendidly
equipped theater. When we arrived we
found a company of Japanese school
girls rehearsing for one of their forth
coming spectacles. All of this, as well
as the theater in which we played at
Yokohama was destroyed in the recent
earthquake.
"The modern idea of the drama has
not yet fully reached the Orient, for
' we were not allowed to play Eugene
O'Neill's "Anna Chritie" in Yoko
hama although we did put it on in
Tokyo.
"They have a more continental idea
of the theater there as well. It is a
place of social relaxation and they gc
about in a more leisurely manner. Be
tween acts everyone goes out on the
outdoor balconies and promenades, oi
to the bars and tea-rooms which are
a part of the whole place. The differ
ence was brought to us with more oi
less of a shock when we came in con
tact with the quick, efficient, Americai;
manner of showing at Honolulu."
