# World's Greatest Dime Novel Collection Coming Here--Rumor
## 
### 
Tales of bloody Indian fights, mys
terious murders, clever crooks, and
wicked women, including every speci
ment of the decadent "dime novel" j
written in the last thirty years, and
nearly every thriller printed between
1860 and 1890; in all, the greatest col
lection of blood-curdling literature in
existence, is rumored destined to be
come a part of the Stanford Library.
This literature, according to press
dispatches, has left New York on a
tour of the United States and will be
on exhibition at several cities, finally j
locating at the ITniversity. No word of
the collection has been sent G. T.
Clark, librarian, and unless someone ;
has intended a birthday or Christmas
surprise for the Library, Diamond Dick
and his contemporaries are not likely
to find rest on Stanford book stacks. ;
Librarian Clark doubts whether the
building has at present the capacity to
hold such a singular collection; and
there is some thought that the more
appropriate place would be the Mu
seum.
Clark says the books probably con

stitute the collection that has for some
time located at the New York Public
Library. The literature is of value as a
curiosity and (perhaps) a record of
what the last generation would like
to have read. Frank P. O'Brien of New
York has been engaged in collecting
the specimens for twenty-six years,
and at present there are said to be
more than 2400 volumes.
Among the stuff are complete works
of such great fiction heroes as Nick
Carter, the Liberty Boys of 1776,
Young and Old King Brady, Fred Fear
not. Diamond Dick, Frank Merriwell
and Jack Hardaway.
O'Brien's collection is scheduled to
go first to Newark where it will be
placed on exhibition at the public li
brary. then to Omaha, Kansas City,
and Denver. The books will also be
shown in the public library at San
Francisco and probably at Sacramento.
A large part of the "dime novels" of
the last thirty-five years are written
of the West, and it is suggested that
this vicinity is an appropriate location
for the collection.
