### 
The first copies of the Illustrated
Review issued under the direction of
Mrs. May Hurlburt Smith, '02, new
editor of the alumni publication, will
appear on the campus October 15. The
magazine is starting its twenty-fifth
year on the campus.
The issue will have a cover showing
the 1923 football team in action on the
stadium field. Pictures of the new unit
recently completed at the Convalescent
Home will also be shown in the first
number. Photographs of the new fac
ulty members as well as the recently
elected trustees will appear.
The feature article of the issue, ac
cording to Mrs. Smith, will be the story
concerning the entrance of the class
of 1927. It will show that never before
has a freshman class entered Stanford
with such unprecedentedly favorable
conditions. Everything has been done
to make the comfort of the beginning
class complete. A sponsor system has
been inaugurated and separate dormi
tories and eating rooms have been
provided for the first-year men. Their
condition will be compared with the
provision made for the entering class
of 1891 which is considered to have
had the greatest comforts of any class
up to the present freshman body.
Professor John E, Coover, research
fellow in the department of psychical
phenomena, will tell some of the re
sults of his eleven years of work. He
has been conducting his experiments
at Stanford during that time and was
recently granted the use of additional
funds for continuing his work. He will
remain at Stanford and carry on the
experiments of which he writes in his
article.
Frank H. Baum, '98, will oiftline the
practicability of a new nation-wide
electric power system planned by him
self. The ideas originated and made ap
plicable by Baum have been sponsored
by the Westinghouse Electric Com
pany which is backing Baum in the
development of his work.
A story of the building developments
of the past summer will be included
in the Illustrated Review. It will
show the exact progress made during
the past three months as well as the
advancement to be made in the near
future.
Another feature of the issue will be
complete notes and information on
how to get tickets for the Big Game,
where to go, and how to get there. The
