Illustrated. She is succeeding Paul
Clyde, '20, who earned a university
fellowship and is studying for his Ph.D.
in history. Clyde was to retain the
editorship of the Review but unex
pected developments forced his retire
ment from this position as well as all |
his other campus teaching and extra
curriculum activities.
Mrs. Smith, who graduated in 1902,;
was a member of the first Chaparral
board of managers in 1900 and was
the only woman admitted to the board
for the first twelve years of its exist-;
ence. She was also a director of the j
Girls' Glee Club for three years, a
member of the editorial staff of the
1902 Quad, musical director of the sen- :
ior "Extravaganeia," or musical com
edy. and chairman of the Senior Farce
Committee. She was also a board di_
rector of the Women's Athletic Asso
ciation, and vice president of the Wo
men's League, established before the
present Women's Conferences were
formed.
Mrs. Smith aims to put out a live
publication which will keep pace with
the best of the other campus publica
tions in thought as well as style.
The first copies of the Illustrated
Review issued under the direction of
Mrs. May Hurlburt Smith, '02, new
editor of the alumni publication, will
appear on the campus October 15. The
magazine is starting its twenty-fifth
year on the campus.

been inaugurated and separate dormi
tories and eating rooms have been
provided for the first-year men. Their
condition will be compared with the
provision made for the entering class
of 1891 which is considered to have
had the greatest comforts of any class
up to the present freshman body.
Professor John E, Coover, research
fellow in the department of psychical
phenomena, will tell some of the re
