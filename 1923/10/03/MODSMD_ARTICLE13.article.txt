# GLEE CLUB TRYOUTS WILL BE HELD; GROUP PLANS SEASON TRIPS
## 
### 
Plans for the coming season of the
Stanford Glee Club, to include a trip
through the north during the Thanksgiv
ing vacation and cither a return engage
ment in Southern California or a two
weeks' tour to New Orleans, up the
Mississippi valley, and home through
Denver in the spring, were announced to
day by Sid Laughlin, president of the
club.
Rehearsal of the new program to be
sung by the club was begun at the first
meeting held this afternoon. An entire
new program, including three numbers
used by the famous Harvard Glee Club,
has been selected by Warren D. Allen,
director. In his selection he has fol
lowed his past policy of using only the
better class of music, avoiding the "trash"
so frequently found in college glees. It
is this policy that has raised the Stanford
organization to its present position of
prominence in California musical circles.
Tryouts for the club will be held on
Monday and Tuesday of next week,
Laughlin states. Good voices are sought,
but it is also essential that prospective
members be willing to attend rehearsals
faithfully. All students arc eligible for
membership in the club. Tryouts will be
held in the music room, room 84, accord
ing to present plans.
