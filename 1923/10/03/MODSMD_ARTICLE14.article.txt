# BABES TO TACKLE THREE OPPONENTS ON TURF SATURDAY
## Fifty Men to Play Against San Jose, Davis Farm, and Berkeley High Grid Stars 
### 
With three games scheduled for Satur
day, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
gridiron aspirants have their hands full
this week. Davis Farm, Berkeley high,
and San Jose high make three tough nuts
for any team to crack.
Saturday morning, the babes are deter
mined to dispose of both San Jose and
Berkeley high, while tlit* Davis Farm ag
gregation will be taken on as a prelim
inary to the varsity and Nevada struggle.
It will be remembered that Berkeley
high came within an ace of beating the
freshman team last year, the final score
reading something like 27-26. And later
in the season, the Yellowjackets went
through to the finals for the state cham
pionship.
San Jose was the winner last year in a
torrid contest with the third string fresh
men, 3-0. This year an even stronger
eleven is reported to represent the "Home
of the Many Laundries."
The Davis Farmers were decisively and
completely beaten by the Nevada varsity
last week. But despite this fact, the
Agriculturists present a strong team this
year and should give the best men on the
freshman squad cjuitc a run for their
money.
The fact that so many men are to play
Saturday cuts out a hard task for Coach
Hunt. Fvery man on the huge squad will
get into one of the three games. This
means that between fifty and sixty men
must be in good condition and ready to
play when Saturday rolls around.
