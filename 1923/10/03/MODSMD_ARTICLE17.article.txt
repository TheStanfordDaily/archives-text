# ATHLETIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL?
## 
### 
Athletic authorities have announced a fifteen year
program of development which will give Stanford
students "the greatest athletic plant in the United
States."
New football fields, basketball courts, swimming
tanks, polo fields, and equipment fur proper partici
pation in all these sports are in prospect. The money
will be taken from the same source of revenue from
which the Board of Athletic Control is paying for
Branner hall—the profits from stadium crowds in
football season.
The Board of Athletic Control, by offering this
chance to the many instead of the few to get some of
the enjoyment of athletics, is building for a future
in which it will be the common occurrence for-Stan
ford coaches to make athletic "finds" from among
the players 011 intramural teams. Moreover, it will
give the dubs who can do nothing but bat a ball
around and get excited about it a little more chance
to have their game.
All that is very nice. It is quite in accord with
Stanford's athletic policy of sports for every one
011 the campus. Only one thing is lacking. Xo pro
vision has been made for those upperclassmen who
are pressed so hard by graduation and other require
ments that they cannot spare the time to take advan
tage of the physical education department's offering.
This group constitutes about half the upper classes
of the University.
Last Christmas university credits for upperclass
work in gymnasium classes were abolished. Several
reasons were given, the most important being two:
first, the academic side of the university administra
tion felt that instruction in physical development
was not on a plane with mental development, and
that it was a lowering of the standard maintained by
the scholastic departments in granting of credits to
have the same credits given for physical endeavor;
the second argument, made by the physical education
department itself, was that the honor system could
not be enforced, and that the department did not
have sufficient staff or funds to hire monitors to
watch over the many upperclassmen who took the
opportunity to benefit themselves physically in organ
ized classes. The argument was that, because of a
lack of policemen to watch the upperclassmen, they
stole their credits by failing to attend the gymnasium
or athletic classes.
Now these upperclassmen are forced to devote
their time formerly used in health building, to theme
building, in order to get the required 180 units.
1 his is because health is not considered as important
as" brain power, and because the students cannot be
trusted.
Meanwhile Stanford announces a fifteen year pro
gram supposedly to give every student a chance to
take the opportunity offered by "the greatest athletic
plant in the United States."

watch over the many upperclassmen who took the
opportunity to benefit themselves physically in organ
ized classes. The argument was that, because of a
lack of policemen to watch the upperclassmen, they
stole their credits by failing to attend the gymnasium
or athletic classes.
Now these upperclassmen are forced to devote
their time formerly used in health building, to theme
building, in order to get the required 180 units.
1 his is because health is not considered as important
as" brain power, and because the students cannot be
trusted.
Meanwhile Stanford announces a fifteen year pro
gram supposedly to give every student a chance to
take the opportunity offered by "the greatest athletic
plant in the United States."
Athletic authorities have announced a fifteen year
program of development which will give Stanford
students "the greatest athletic plant in the United
States."
New football fields, basketball courts, swimming
tanks, polo fields, and equipment fur proper partici
pation in all these sports are in prospect. The money
will be taken from the same source of revenue from
which the Board of Athletic Control is paying for
Branner hall—the profits from stadium crowds in
football season.
The Board of Athletic Control, by offering this
chance to the many instead of the few to get some of
the enjoyment of athletics, is building for a future
in which it will be the common occurrence for-Stan
ford coaches to make athletic "finds" from among
the players 011 intramural teams. Moreover, it will
give the dubs who can do nothing but bat a ball
around and get excited about it a little more chance
to have their game.
All that is very nice. It is quite in accord with
Stanford's athletic policy of sports for every one
011 the campus. Only one thing is lacking. Xo pro
vision has been made for those upperclassmen who
are pressed so hard by graduation and other require
ments that they cannot spare the time to take advan
tage of the physical education department's offering.
This group constitutes about half the upper classes
of the University.
Last Christmas university credits for upperclass
work in gymnasium classes were abolished. Several
reasons were given, the most important being two:
first, the academic side of the university administra
tion felt that instruction in physical development
was not on a plane with mental development, and
that it was a lowering of the standard maintained by
the scholastic departments in granting of credits to
have the same credits given for physical endeavor;
the second argument, made by the physical education
department itself, was that the honor system could
not be enforced, and that the department did not
have sufficient staff or funds to hire monitors to
watch over the many upperclassmen who took the
opportunity to benefit themselves physically in organ
ized classes. The argument was that, because of a
lack of policemen to watch the upperclassmen, they
