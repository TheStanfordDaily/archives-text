# Cheer for the Oil Cans

In spite of the fact that all men are created equal,
receive the same round zeros after their name in the
student directory, and get the same amount of sylla
bus, it takes one student six weeks to prepare for an
examination, while another does it in six hours. Both
get the same marks. Reason? None, except that one
student can afford to be lazy because of a gift of
writing examinations under forced draft while the
other makes his A grades by good hard work.
