''As an experiment in co-operation be-1
tween two organizations, the Women's
Social Welfare Commission has been un
usually successful," said Margaret Wool- j
sey, Y. W. C. A. secretary, in reviewing 1
the work accomplished by this board
which has been in existence only since j
last year.
"Until last year the work now handled j
by the Social Welfare Commission was
managed separately by the Y. W. C. A. i
and the Women's Service Board which j
operated under Organized Women and
was created during the war," said Miss :
Woolsey. "These two social service de
partments were constantly over-lapping!
and it was decided that the social service j
work could be handled much more effi- j
ciently by a joint organization of the two;
departments. Under the leadership of j
Dean Yost, Margaret Woolsey, and Mar-:
garet White, president of Organized Wo-j
men. the present commission composed of!
three women elected by women's confer- j
ence, three members appointed by thej
Y. W. cabinet and the Y. W. secretary i
was formed. The commission elects its j
own president, that office now being held i
by Lcona Mayer.
"The new commission at once began a
systematic survey to open up more op
portunities for social service. Previous to
the new arrangement the Y. W. social
service committee had had charge of work j
at Five Points and the convalescent home, j
entertainments at the Base hospital and
Girl Scout work. With this work and
that done by the old service board as a
basis the present Social Welfare Com
mission enlarged the scope of its activi
ties until it now also assists in night
school work in the Japanese kindergarten !
and in the distribution of milk in the
Palo Alto grade schools. Fifty women
arc enrolled in the service of this com
mission. It was proposed to give the new
plan a three year trial but there is no
doubt in my mind but that it has already
established itself permanently."
