ADVANCE DOPE ON FOOTBALL SQUAD—JUST HOW
THE TEAM WILL LINE UP IN NOVEMBER
Compiled by "Dope"
The boys are all busy working out now. Everybody is
busy. The coaches are coaching the backfield men as
well as the line, so that no discrimination will be shown.
Everything is going full blast.
How to play the game is what the coaches are now
instilling into the squad. "We believe," the head coach
remarked only yesterday, "that each football player
should absolutely be taught how to play football. And
by playing football I do not mean playing ping-pong or
lawn tennis. I mean football." The secondary line
coach supplemented the head coach's statement by add
ing that he believed a football player was useless unless
he could play the game.
Standard Shift to Be Used on This Year's Machine
It seems highly probable at present that the guards
will be placed on either side of the center this year. The
head coach has expressed his dissatisfaction with the idea
advanced by some that the ends should really be placed
next to the center, in order that the tackles might be
on the end, thus tricking the opposing team.
"It's not clean football," was the mentor's pithy com
ment. "I believe that not only should the guards be
next to the center, but I will insist on keeping the half
backs out of the line. As long as I have charge of this
team, I intend to run it."
Dummies Now at Work
At present the boys are getting some of the kinks out
of their arms and legs by butting the dummies regularly
every night. We asked the coach if he wasn't liable to
run out of dummies, but he merely waved his hand in
the general direction of th University and said, "Oh, I
think not." The usual procedure in tackling the dummy
this year is to start several feet away from it, and,
running at practically top speed, take a flying leap as if
catching a Market St. car, and grasp the dummy firmly
by the legs while whirling past. If the dummy is well
fastened, the player stops quickly and repeats the pro
cedure at will. The head coach favors this standard
method of dummy-tackling.
From the number of men out for football this year,
it appears that the squad will not suffer for lack of
material. The coach declares that he will use only
eleven men in the game at one time all through the
season, and this policy should help conserve the nu
merical strength. "Any other policy," the mentor de
clares, "would be sheer folly. Many people think it
takes two halfbacks to make a fullback; and as for
quarterbacks—well, we have four of them, but needless
to say, there are four quarters in any football game.
After all, the fundamental plays are the thing."
Off-Color Bucks Out of Season
The coach is Stressing the important point that the
players must learn first the simple plays; then the more
concrete. He plans to use a startling new combination
this year, however, which he requests be not divulged
as yet. In this play, the quarterback takes the place of
the center and snaps the ball back to the right half. In
the meantime the left half has taken the place the
quarterback has left vacant, and starts calling signals.
This gives time for the right half to circle the left end,
and, doubling back on his traces, he meets the quarter
back just right-of center. The quarterback then forward
passes the ball to the center, who by this time has
sauntered down to the enemy's goal line. Great things
are expected of this play, as only four men are used in
the whole execution.
Second Team Plays First
A novel innovation is promised this year by the head
coach in the shape of a second team that will play the
first. Whether it will be the first of November or the
first of December has not yet been decided by the
graduate manager, but from present appearances it will
be. The second team is lining up well, and are getting
plenty of practice in kicking and complaining, accord
ing to the head coach of the subordinate squad. "If the
varsity could kick like this team can," he remarked,
"they'd be in there fighting all the time."
The first game of the season will be held on a Satur
day this year, as there is generally a Free Lecture in
the Little Theatre on Tuesday nights.
