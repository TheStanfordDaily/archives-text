THE SPOILERS, Stanford Theatre,
Palo Alto (now playing).
"The Spoilers" is an unfortunate po
sition. Most everyone remembers the
old "Spoilers," with a beatific haze en
gendered by time, in which the only
things standing out are the facts that
it was a good picture, and had a good
fight.
But the new "Spoilers" soon dispels
any fond mem'ries of "pictures they
used to make." In the first place, the
mechanical and technical advantages
now at the disposal of the producers
are obvious; and in the second, in
spite of the howl put up by the purer
pictures league, the producers have
learned a thing or two in ten years.
It is too bad that Hollywood does
not have some such handicap to over
come in making every picture as it
faced in making this one; if it had,
maybe they would be better as a rule,
and not as an exception.

BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE—
We remember having seen this pic
ture, or thought we had until reading
the preliminary advertising being
spread about on the local screen. Un
fortunately, the picture isn't as
naughty as the advertisers would have
us believe. The "intimate glimpses
into Parisian boudoirs" disclose little
more than the usual bed, dresser, and
rocker of the American bedroom, with
an occasional undergarment carelessly
thrown about —not half so daring as
the usual underwear advertisement in
even the best magazines.
That's one trouble with the pro-
