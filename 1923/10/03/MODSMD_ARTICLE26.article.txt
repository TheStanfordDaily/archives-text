# Change Is Made in Schedule for Women's Formal Gymnastics
## 
### 
A new change has been made by
Miss Bunting in the Women's Physical
Education department. Formal gym
nastics are now required only once a
week during the three quarters of the
college year instead of three times a
week during the winter quarter. Ath
letics are substituted as a requirement
twice a week during the entire year.
"This change will promote interest
in athletics among the women during
all seasons," says Miss Bunting. "Since
all women must enroll in some class
of sports, unsuspected talent can eas
ily be uncovered which otherwise
would not be. Another advantage can
be seen from the standpoint of ad
ministrative purposes. With physical
education classes only on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday, Tuesdays and
Thursdays can be utilized for other
classes, and so make the difficult mat
ter of arranging programs much eas
ier. From the standpoint of athletics,
practice is thus facilitated because
classes reporting for duty at 4 o'clock
may continue through the afternoon
instead of being forced to abdicate to
another section at 5 o'clock, as was
formerly necessary."
These are the reasons given by Miss
Bunting for the change.
