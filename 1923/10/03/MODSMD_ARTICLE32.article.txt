# THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS ENROLL AT STATE COLLEGE
## 
### 
i U The campus of the State College i
of Washington is alive again, for the
vanguard of the annual influx of 1,000
new students—freshmen, and advanced
credit students from other institutions—
arc already swarming into the buildings
and along the walks, under the trees, J
Secretary C. A. Isaacs predicts an enroll
ments of 3,000 this year, as he expects,
from increased correspondence and cre
dentials filed, at least 200 more than last j
year, when there were 2.809.
Between 150 and 200 have already made
application for advanced standing, bring
ing credits not only from the University;
of Washington and all the state normals,
hut from Oregon, California, Idaho, and
scattered all over the other states. Last
year 13,000 credit hours of advanced i
standing were brought, enough to grad
uate 100 students; correspondence to date
indicates an increase this year, the two
semesters.
Although all dormitory rooms were as
signed long before registration day, Sep
tember 17, all students were able to find
comfortable rooms near the campus, for
Secretary Paul Phillips of the Y. M.
C. A. and Dean of Women Mirian Ger
lach had long lists of inspected rooms on
college hill from which newcomers might
choose.
The new dormitory for men has in
creased its capacity to 259; Ferry Hall
accommodates 181 more; and the fra
ternities about 500 men. The girls' soror
ities hold about 400, and the four dormi
tories 312 more.
