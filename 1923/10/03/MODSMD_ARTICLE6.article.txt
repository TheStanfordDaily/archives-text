# GREAT YEAR FORECASTED FOR SWIMMING VARSITY
## Team's Only Loss Is Jinny Austin; De Groot Still Eligible; Charlie Fletcher Olympic Possibility. 
### 
Ernie Brandsten has a big smile on his
facc whenever he speaks of the swim
ming prospects for the coming year. He
has .reason for the smile too, with prac
tically every member of last year's swim
nfing team back at school with the excep
tion of Jimmy Austin.
Charley Fletcher has been going great
all summer, breaking the national record
for the 220-yard breast stroke when he
covered the distance in 3 1-5. Fletcher
may be able to cut this mark down before
the year is over and if he does should be
a cinch for the Olympics games next
summer.
Dud DeGroot has another year of
swimming, even though he is ineligible for
football. Dud is a record breaker at the
back stroke and should be a winner in
all the meets during the year. De Groot
is also a valuable water polo man. He
had a bad knee last year which kept
him out of the tank during the year.
However, now that he is through play
ing football his knee should fast round
into shape so that he can again star in
the tank.
Wally O'Conner, last year's stellar
freshman sprinter will do most of the
heavy work for the varsity in this line.
He will have as his running mate
Dutch McCallister, who starred on the
water polo team last year. With these
two men Ernie hasn't much to worry
about. Sol Miller will also do a little
of the fast work on the team.
Langley and Allen are two freshmen
swimmers who should make good on

the varsity. Langley plunges and swims
the 220 while Allen will be seen in the
440. Johnnie Mack, captain of the 1926
water polo team, will be one Of the
aspirants for the breast stroke. Mack
is young and has lots of possibilities.
A1 White, one of the country's best
divers, is back, and King and Smith
from last year's freshman team are
also doing some diving. Clarence Pink
ston, who won the fancy diving at the
Olympic games in Antwerp, and who
recently defeated A1 White for the na
tional high board title, may return to
school at Christmas, and if he does
Ernie should make a clean sweep of
diving.
Eric Kramer, a good breast stroke
man, is back and should be able to
place second to Fletcher in most of
the meets. Two new men at Stanford
this year are Jim Carson, a transfer
from California, who is one of the
best water polo players on the coast.
Carson will not be eligible for inter
collegiate competition but will be al
lowed to perform in outside games. He
should be a big help to the team when
it plays the Illinois Athletic Club. Dave
Fall, a transfer from Oregon Agricul
tural College, and one of the best
divers in the Northwest, will do some
diving for Stanford.
About a dozen of the best high
school swimmers in California have
registered as freshmen and Brandsten
is confident of a powerful freshman
water polo and swimming team again
