# GREAT YEAR FORECASTED FOR SWIMMING VARSITY
## Team's Only Loss Is Jinny Austin; De Groot Still Eligible; Charlie Fletcher Olympic Possibility. 
### 
Ernie Brandsten has a big smile on his
facc whenever he speaks of the swim
ming prospects for the coming year. He
has .reason for the smile too, with prac
tically every member of last year's swim
nfing team back at school with the excep
tion of Jimmy Austin.
Charley Fletcher has been going great
all summer, breaking the national record
for the 220-yard breast stroke when he
covered the distance in 3 1-5. Fletcher
may be able to cut this mark down before
the year is over and if he does should be
a cinch for the Olympics games next
summer.
Dud DeGroot has another year of
swimming, even though he is ineligible for
football. Dud is a record breaker at the
back stroke and should be a winner in
all the meets during the year. De Groot
is also a valuable water polo man. He
had a bad knee last year which kept
him out of the tank during the year.
However, now that he is through play
ing football his knee should fast round
into shape so that he can again star in
the tank.
Wally O'Conner, last year's stellar
freshman sprinter will do most of the
heavy work for the varsity in this line.
He will have as his running mate
Dutch McCallister, who starred on the
water polo team last year. With these
two men Ernie hasn't much to worry
about. Sol Miller will also do a little
of the fast work on the team.
Langley and Allen are two freshmen
swimmers who should make good on

the varsity. Langley plunges and swims
the 220 while Allen will be seen in the
440. Johnnie Mack, captain of the 1926
water polo team, will be one Of the
aspirants for the breast stroke. Mack
is young and has lots of possibilities.
A1 White, one of the country's best
divers, is back, and King and Smith
from last year's freshman team are
also doing some diving. Clarence Pink
ston, who won the fancy diving at the
Olympic games in Antwerp, and who
recently defeated A1 White for the na
tional high board title, may return to
school at Christmas, and if he does
Ernie should make a clean sweep of
diving.
Eric Kramer, a good breast stroke
man, is back and should be able to
place second to Fletcher in most of
the meets. Two new men at Stanford
this year are Jim Carson, a transfer
from California, who is one of the
best water polo players on the coast.
Carson will not be eligible for inter
collegiate competition but will be al
lowed to perform in outside games. He
should be a big help to the team when
it plays the Illinois Athletic Club. Dave
Fall, a transfer from Oregon Agricul
tural College, and one of the best
divers in the Northwest, will do some
diving for Stanford.
About a dozen of the best high
school swimmers in California have
registered as freshmen and Brandsten
is confident of a powerful freshman
water polo and swimming team again
this year.
Very little has been arranged in the
way of games or meets for this year
so far, but Ernie is making negotia
tions for some big events to be held
before the year is over. For the fall
quarter he expects to hold an invita
tional water polo meet for the varsity
and to schedule games with the San
Francisco high schools for the fresh
men. All of the good water polo teams
from San Diego to the Multnomah Club
in Portland are expected to enter this
contest and give the Stanford team,
which ranks second, nationally, some
good competition.
In April or May Brandsten hopes
to have the best swimming talent in
the country at Stanford. The Pacific,
Coast division tryouts for the Olympics
will take place then, the tank to be
used having not yet been decided, but
it will probably be at Stanford or
near here. A few days prior to these
tryouts a 220 national breast stroke
championship, the 100>-yard free style
championship, the national water polo
championship, and the 400-yard, four_
man-team, relay championship are
scheduled to take place. The best tal
ent from Hawaii, together with most
of the stars from the Illinois and Chi
cago athletic clubs will bo present in
addition to California and Oregon men.
Arrangements for this swimming carni
val are in a very tentative state at
present but Brandsten hopes to be
able to land them. Definite arrange
ments cannot be made for some time
! yet.

in Portland are expected to enter this
contest and give the Stanford team,
which ranks second, nationally, some
good competition.
In April or May Brandsten hopes
to have the best swimming talent in
the country at Stanford. The Pacific,
Coast division tryouts for the Olympics
will take place then, the tank to be
used having not yet been decided, but
it will probably be at Stanford or
near here. A few days prior to these
tryouts a 220 national breast stroke
championship, the 100>-yard free style
championship, the national water polo
championship, and the 400-yard, four_
man-team, relay championship are
scheduled to take place. The best tal
ent from Hawaii, together with most
of the stars from the Illinois and Chi
cago athletic clubs will bo present in
addition to California and Oregon men.
Arrangements for this swimming carni
val are in a very tentative state at
present but Brandsten hopes to be
able to land them. Definite arrange
ments cannot be made for some time
! yet.

Cornell University has become the
possessor of the author's copy of the
famous old song "Dixie." The original
manuscript was stolen from the com
poser, Daniel Decatur Emmett, and the
present copy was made by the author
at the request of a cousin of Mr. C. W.
i Curtis, the donor.
Ernie Brandsten has a big smile on his
facc whenever he speaks of the swim
ming prospects for the coming year. He
has .reason for the smile too, with prac
tically every member of last year's swim
nfing team back at school with the excep
tion of Jimmy Austin.
Charley Fletcher has been going great
all summer, breaking the national record
for the 220-yard breast stroke when he
covered the distance in 3 1-5. Fletcher
may be able to cut this mark down before
the year is over and if he does should be
a cinch for the Olympics games next
summer.
Dud DeGroot has another year of
swimming, even though he is ineligible for
football. Dud is a record breaker at the
back stroke and should be a winner in
all the meets during the year. De Groot
is also a valuable water polo man. He
had a bad knee last year which kept
him out of the tank during the year.
However, now that he is through play
ing football his knee should fast round
into shape so that he can again star in
the tank.
Wally O'Conner, last year's stellar
freshman sprinter will do most of the
heavy work for the varsity in this line.
He will have as his running mate
Dutch McCallister, who starred on the
water polo team last year. With these
two men Ernie hasn't much to worry
about. Sol Miller will also do a little
of the fast work on the team.
Langley and Allen are two freshmen
swimmers who should make good on

the varsity. Langley plunges and swims
the 220 while Allen will be seen in the
440. Johnnie Mack, captain of the 1926
water polo team, will be one Of the
aspirants for the breast stroke. Mack
is young and has lots of possibilities.
A1 White, one of the country's best
divers, is back, and King and Smith
from last year's freshman team are
also doing some diving. Clarence Pink
ston, who won the fancy diving at the
Olympic games in Antwerp, and who
recently defeated A1 White for the na
tional high board title, may return to
school at Christmas, and if he does
Ernie should make a clean sweep of
diving.
Eric Kramer, a good breast stroke
man, is back and should be able to
place second to Fletcher in most of
the meets. Two new men at Stanford
this year are Jim Carson, a transfer
from California, who is one of the
best water polo players on the coast.
Carson will not be eligible for inter
collegiate competition but will be al
lowed to perform in outside games. He
should be a big help to the team when
it plays the Illinois Athletic Club. Dave
Fall, a transfer from Oregon Agricul
tural College, and one of the best
divers in the Northwest, will do some
diving for Stanford.
About a dozen of the best high
school swimmers in California have
registered as freshmen and Brandsten
is confident of a powerful freshman
water polo and swimming team again
this year.
Very little has been arranged in the
way of games or meets for this year
so far, but Ernie is making negotia
tions for some big events to be held
before the year is over. For the fall
quarter he expects to hold an invita
tional water polo meet for the varsity
and to schedule games with the San
Francisco high schools for the fresh
men. All of the good water polo teams
from San Diego to the Multnomah Club
in Portland are expected to enter this
contest and give the Stanford team,

school at Christmas, and if he does
Ernie should make a clean sweep of
diving.
Eric Kramer, a good breast stroke
man, is back and should be able to
place second to Fletcher in most of
the meets. Two new men at Stanford
this year are Jim Carson, a transfer
from California, who is one of the
best water polo players on the coast.
Carson will not be eligible for inter
collegiate competition but will be al
lowed to perform in outside games. He
should be a big help to the team when
it plays the Illinois Athletic Club. Dave
Fall, a transfer from Oregon Agricul
tural College, and one of the best
divers in the Northwest, will do some
diving for Stanford.
About a dozen of the best high
school swimmers in California have
registered as freshmen and Brandsten
is confident of a powerful freshman
water polo and swimming team again
this year.
Very little has been arranged in the
way of games or meets for this year
so far, but Ernie is making negotia
tions for some big events to be held
before the year is over. For the fall
quarter he expects to hold an invita
tional water polo meet for the varsity
and to schedule games with the San
Francisco high schools for the fresh
men. All of the good water polo teams
from San Diego to the Multnomah Club
in Portland are expected to enter this
contest and give the Stanford team,
which ranks second, nationally, some
good competition.
In April or May Brandsten hopes
to have the best swimming talent in
the country at Stanford. The Pacific,
Coast division tryouts for the Olympics
will take place then, the tank to be
used having not yet been decided, but
it will probably be at Stanford or
near here. A few days prior to these
tryouts a 220 national breast stroke
championship, the 100>-yard free style
championship, the national water polo
championship, and the 400-yard, four_
man-team, relay championship are
scheduled to take place. The best tal
ent from Hawaii, together with most
of the stars from the Illinois and Chi
cago athletic clubs will bo present in
addition to California and Oregon men.
Arrangements for this swimming carni
val are in a very tentative state at
present but Brandsten hopes to be
able to land them. Definite arrange
ments cannot be made for some time
! yet.

Ernie Brandsten has a big smile on his
facc whenever he speaks of the swim
ming prospects for the coming year. He
has .reason for the smile too, with prac
tically every member of last year's swim
nfing team back at school with the excep
tion of Jimmy Austin.
Charley Fletcher has been going great
all summer, breaking the national record
for the 220-yard breast stroke when he
covered the distance in 3 1-5. Fletcher
may be able to cut this mark down before
the year is over and if he does should be
a cinch for the Olympics games next
summer.
Dud DeGroot has another year of
swimming, even though he is ineligible for
football. Dud is a record breaker at the
back stroke and should be a winner in
all the meets during the year. De Groot
is also a valuable water polo man. He
had a bad knee last year which kept
him out of the tank during the year.
However, now that he is through play
ing football his knee should fast round
into shape so that he can again star in
the tank.
Wally O'Conner, last year's stellar
freshman sprinter will do most of the
heavy work for the varsity in this line.
He will have as his running mate
Dutch McCallister, who starred on the
water polo team last year. With these
two men Ernie hasn't much to worry
about. Sol Miller will also do a little
of the fast work on the team.
Langley and Allen are two freshmen
swimmers who should make good on

the varsity. Langley plunges and swims
the 220 while Allen will be seen in the
440. Johnnie Mack, captain of the 1926
water polo team, will be one Of the
aspirants for the breast stroke. Mack
is young and has lots of possibilities.
A1 White, one of the country's best
divers, is back, and King and Smith
from last year's freshman team are
also doing some diving. Clarence Pink
ston, who won the fancy diving at the
Olympic games in Antwerp, and who
recently defeated A1 White for the na
tional high board title, may return to
school at Christmas, and if he does
Ernie should make a clean sweep of
diving.
