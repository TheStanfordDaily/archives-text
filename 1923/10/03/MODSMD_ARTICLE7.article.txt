# Campus Gardeners Work Miracles on Pavilion Grounds
## 
### 
Old as well as new students were as
tounded by the beauty of the landscape
gardening at Stanford on returning to the
University this quarter. Many compli
mentary remarks have been heard from
all parts of the campus relative to the
grounds around the New Union and the
basketball pavilion. The pleasing appear
ance of the gardens has been ascribed to
the constant attention of the Stanford
gardeners. Banks of red bushes surround
the pavilion and line the. walks on the
north side of the New Union. At the
pavilion are two large sections of care
fully-trimmed turf with a bank of gera
niums planted among the trees lining the
road. On the east and west sides, the
filled-in ground has been planted with low
green privet bushes. At the Union, in the
space formerly dry and bare, used for
parking purposes, the ground has been
covered with an extensive lawn, edged
with red and green bushes of a common
California variety.

The Student Council of the Univer
sity of Michigan unanimously voted at
a recent meeting to submit the name
of any "hazer" to the central commit
tee on discipline for action.
