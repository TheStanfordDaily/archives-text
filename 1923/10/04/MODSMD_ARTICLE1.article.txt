no student breaks the contract in which
I your honor and that of Stanford is in

a part of the life ol' the University. Good, bad, or indifferent, you belong to
us and we belong to you." President Wilbur thus welcomed new students in
assembly this morning.
'*rhirty years ago to be a Stanford man meant very little," continued Dr.
"Wilbur. "Now, by the work and efforts of thousands of-students, faculty,
and alumni, it means much. We have required a reputation and a dignified and
useful position in the educational and scientific affairs of the world.
"It has taken years of honest effort by thousands of people to build up the
good name of Stanford. You carry that name with you from now 011, until

Faculty Association a Privilege
"You are to have the privileged expe

faculty. All things considered, university i
professors have gone further in personal'
achievement than any other group of men. \
Men may win position or place in many
of the world's afifairs through the for

relationships to natural resources, but a i

Honor System Prized
''Our honor system is our choicest pos
session. It is a contract between the stu
dents and the faculty by which the stu-1
dents guarantee that every examination

I est one. You as a student should see that
no student breaks the contract in which
I your honor and that of Stanford is in
volved. We expect you to keep the Stan
ford diploma clean."
The following suggestions were made by
the president as helpful to the student
1 for success in his work.
1. Never cut your classes.
2. Keep your daily work up to date.
3. Pay attention in classes.
4. Be regular in study hours and exer
cise.
5. Keep physically fit.
6. Don't listen to the fireside gasser
