# STANFORD'S NAME KNOWN IN ALL EUROPE-GOLDER
## 
### 
"Stanford's name is known every
where throughout Europe because of
Herbert Hoover's war activities, and
President Wilbur's and Dr. Jordan's
participation in affairs of international
and scientific interest," says Professor
F. A. Golder of the History department.
"President Wilbur and Dr. Jordan are
especially well known in the Balkans."
Professor Golder has returned to the
University this year after having
spent three years In Europe as politi
cal observer for Herbert Hoover, repre
sentative of the Hoover War LJbray.
Professor Golder was also a special
investigator for the American Relief
Association.
Conditions in Russia are much im

proved from the point of view of food,
Dr. Golder maintains. "Russia has
raised enough food to feed her entire
population, but it is not likely that this
food will be distributed in such a way
that everyone will get it. The Soviet
is greatly in need of money, and will
sell some of the surplus foodstuffs in
Europe."
While acting as special investigator
for the American Relief, Dr. Golder
traveled over a greater part of Euro
pean Russia and the Caucausus in
j company with Professor Lincoln
Hutchinson, formerly of the Univer
sity of California. They had an un
usual opportunity to observe condi
| tions in Europe and report many in
teresting experiences. Though they
were spied upon by the Bolsheviki
they were not attacked.
Dr. Golder established friendly re
lations with many of the Bolshevik
leaders, and through their help was
enabled to send a large collection of
Russian books to the University Li
brary and the Hoover War Collection.
For books relating to Russian his
tory up to the time of the war, the
Stanford Library will now rank next
to the Library of Congress, Harvard
Library, and the New York Public
Library. For material published in Rus
sia since 1914, however, Stanford leads
the libraries of the world, according to
Dr. Golder. In the future, not only
scholars of America but also scholars
from Europe will have to come to
Stanford to make their studies of the
war period of Russian history.

Palo Alto recorded ;ix more births
than deaths during September, according
to the report of City Health Office Louis
Olscn. Twelve births were reported and
only six deaths. A total of 360 inspec
tions was made during the month by the
health department.

leaders, and through their help was
enabled to send a large collection of
Russian books to the University Li
brary and the Hoover War Collection.
For books relating to Russian his
tory up to the time of the war, the
Stanford Library will now rank next
to the Library of Congress, Harvard
Library, and the New York Public
Library. For material published in Rus
sia since 1914, however, Stanford leads
the libraries of the world, according to
Dr. Golder. In the future, not only
scholars of America but also scholars
from Europe will have to come to
Stanford to make their studies of the
war period of Russian history.

Palo Alto recorded ;ix more births

"Stanford's name is known every
where throughout Europe because of
Herbert Hoover's war activities, and
President Wilbur's and Dr. Jordan's
participation in affairs of international
and scientific interest," says Professor
F. A. Golder of the History department.
"President Wilbur and Dr. Jordan are
especially well known in the Balkans."
Professor Golder has returned to the
University this year after having
spent three years In Europe as politi
cal observer for Herbert Hoover, repre
sentative of the Hoover War LJbray.
Professor Golder was also a special
investigator for the American Relief
Association.
Conditions in Russia are much im

proved from the point of view of food,
Dr. Golder maintains. "Russia has
raised enough food to feed her entire
population, but it is not likely that this
food will be distributed in such a way
that everyone will get it. The Soviet
is greatly in need of money, and will
sell some of the surplus foodstuffs in
Europe."
While acting as special investigator
for the American Relief, Dr. Golder
traveled over a greater part of Euro
pean Russia and the Caucausus in
j company with Professor Lincoln
Hutchinson, formerly of the Univer
sity of California. They had an un
usual opportunity to observe condi
| tions in Europe and report many in
teresting experiences. Though they
were spied upon by the Bolsheviki
they were not attacked.
Dr. Golder established friendly re
lations with many of the Bolshevik
leaders, and through their help was
enabled to send a large collection of
Russian books to the University Li
brary and the Hoover War Collection.
