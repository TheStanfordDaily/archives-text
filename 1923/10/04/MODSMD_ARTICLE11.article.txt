# NO SLUMP IN STUDIES CAN BE TOLERATED AMONG FOOTBALL MEN SAYS ANDY KERR
## VARSITY GRID COACH MAKES STAND VERY CLEAR Squad Has Been Drilled in Defensive Tactics During Past Week; Four Veterans Are in Close Race for Regular Halfback Positions 
### 
Andy Kerr came .down with a thump on those members of the 1923 football
squad who allow their enthusiasm for athletics to get the best of their
scholastic endeavors, in a football meeting last night following the first
session of the varsity training table at the Alpha Delta Phi house.
Players who slump in their studies will be forbidden to appear on the
football field, said the head coach.
"From now on," said Kerr, "you men should have just two things in mind —
studies and football. Wo must not approach the Big Game with five or six men
on the verge of disqualification. When I am informed that any man is low
in his studies 1 shall probably forbid him at the field until he has brought up
his standing.. This may lose a football game for us, but it will be better
in the long run. There isn't a man on this squad who cannot handle both."

The work during the past week has
been mostly centered 011 fundamentals,
with attention to the few simple plays
which Kerr will use in the Nevada con
test. Ihe men are learning plays in about
half the time required last year. Flocks
of substitutes will probably be used, and
several contests for places 011 the team
will be partially cleared up.
Four Good, Halfbacks
< )ne of the best struggles for a berth
is at the halfback position, with four men
participating. Woodward, Dennis, Mur
ray, and Cleaveland all have claims, and
it is possible that Kerr will have two in
terchangeable sets of halves for use dur
ing the coming season. Solomon, Kelly,
and Dunmire are keeping Ernie Nevers
hustling for the fullback's post, with
( uddeback as a possibility. Although the
big boy has the edge at present, his in
jury would not leave the team without a
capable substitute, and Cuddeback will
undoubtedly see action on account of his
kicking ability.
As yet, little dope has trickled in from
Reno in regard to the strength of the
Wolf Pack, but the supporters of the
Nevada eleven seem to have a world of
confidence. They have two ambitions—to
beat Stanford first and California second
—and have been pointed at this game,
while to Stanford it comes merely as an
incidental preliminary contest.
