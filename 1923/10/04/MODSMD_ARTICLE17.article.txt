"Psst, Ed; hop onto this; it's the best pipe in the
University."
Whereupon Ed stepped out of his place in the reg
istration line, allowed his very well-meaning friend
to scratch a few new hieroglyphies in his book,
and returned to the fine confident that he was sign
ing up for another course that would give him the
least possible mental effort for three months.
Next quarter Ed will allow another well-meaning
friend to steer him along the same course. He will
continue to sign up for "snooze courses" until he is
out of the Lower Division. Then he will carefully
study the Announcement of Courses, pick the de
partment which has the least possible requirements,
and step into line with the discouraged engineers for
an interview with the professor who will direct his
Studies for another eighteen months.
About the end of the third year Ed will wake up—
perhaps, lie will see students who started out with
him working towards a definite end, with the assur
ance that they are acquiring a useful, practical knowl
edge as they go. Moreover,—much to Ed's astonish
ment —they seem to be enjoying the acquisition, and,
jnore astonishing, they are taking a real interest in the
subject.
Ed will, if not thoroughly awake yet. wonder what
makes his friends so foolishly industrious, and wish
peevishly that they would not always talk on sub
jects over his head and beyond the capacity of his
half-trained mind to comprehend'.
Then he will hear of courses in which even he him
self might take an interest. 11 e will find that for
three years he has been going to classes for the pur
pose of forgetting all knowledge half an hour after
the final, while just around the corner was a whole
kingdom of wonders to be had for the asking from
professors who delight to pass on their gifts to others,
lie will find in his Announcement of Courses sub
jects it would take him three years to complete, sub
jects which he wishes fervently he knew about.
About this time Ed will wonder what kind of an ass
he was to allow his laziness to trick him out of the
opportunity to enter this kingdom. But wondering
at that time will be too late, for Ed will have gone
too far in his "pipe" department to allow graduation
by any other route.
will leave the University with his A.8., and
as he leaves he will hear sophomores talking on sub
jects which he cannot understand.

three years he has been going to classes for the pur
pose of forgetting all knowledge half an hour after
the final, while just around the corner was a whole
kingdom of wonders to be had for the asking from
professors who delight to pass on their gifts to others,
lie will find in his Announcement of Courses sub
jects it would take him three years to complete, sub
jects which he wishes fervently he knew about.
About this time Ed will wonder what kind of an ass
he was to allow his laziness to trick him out of the
opportunity to enter this kingdom. But wondering
at that time will be too late, for Ed will have gone
too far in his "pipe" department to allow graduation
by any other route.
will leave the University with his A.8., and
as he leaves he will hear sophomores talking on sub
jects which he cannot understand.
"Psst, Ed; hop onto this; it's the best pipe in the
University."
Whereupon Ed stepped out of his place in the reg
istration line, allowed his very well-meaning friend
to scratch a few new hieroglyphies in his book,
and returned to the fine confident that he was sign
ing up for another course that would give him the
least possible mental effort for three months.
Next quarter Ed will allow another well-meaning
friend to steer him along the same course. He will
continue to sign up for "snooze courses" until he is
out of the Lower Division. Then he will carefully
study the Announcement of Courses, pick the de
partment which has the least possible requirements,
and step into line with the discouraged engineers for
an interview with the professor who will direct his
Studies for another eighteen months.
About the end of the third year Ed will wake up—
perhaps, lie will see students who started out with
him working towards a definite end, with the assur
ance that they are acquiring a useful, practical knowl
edge as they go. Moreover,—much to Ed's astonish
ment —they seem to be enjoying the acquisition, and,
jnore astonishing, they are taking a real interest in the
subject.
Ed will, if not thoroughly awake yet. wonder what
makes his friends so foolishly industrious, and wish
peevishly that they would not always talk on sub
jects over his head and beyond the capacity of his
half-trained mind to comprehend'.
Then he will hear of courses in which even he him
self might take an interest. 11 e will find that for
