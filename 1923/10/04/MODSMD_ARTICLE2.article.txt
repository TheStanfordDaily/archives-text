cases of material from Russia, chiefly
war documents of state, during the sum
mer months. These shipments supplement
Russian material already in the collec
tion, which at present amounts to approxi
mately 90 cases. Word has just been re
ceived that the last great collection gath

Canadian newspapers issued during the
war came from Montreal and one case

received as gifts important documents
from all parts of the world. The Persian

Persian neutrality during the war. Vari
ous national societies in France, Eng
land, Italy, and America sent gifts. The
library also made several exchanges of
documents with the Library of Congress
and the Musee d' la Guerre in Paris.

acquisitions from Russia, France and
Italy. The Russian collection is now
about complete, but the directors of the
library say that they expect as nnich ma
terial to come in from other countries as
came in last year. At present there are
