morning it was estimated that there were 2725 casualties
in the annual registration rush. About 34 escaped be

not really serious found out that they had received more
damage than they had suspected.

Everything is fairly quiet now. The 61- and 96-mile

instead of spending much time and labor annually in
changing the flower beds —thereby entailing a total waste
of many, many flowers —why not plant vegetables in all
the gardens instead? Then when the bi-weekly trans
planting period comes, and the gardeners get busy
putting something new in, the old scenery will not be
wasted. Students who eat on the campus would be
turned loose on the vegetable gardens at stated periods
—say from 1 to 1:30, and 7 to 7:30-—and without a doubt
the ground would be cleared quickly. The only cost
would be the hiring of police reserves to see that the

The rushing rules for men are obviously getting laxer
and more lax each year. It is high time to stop was
put to this loose practice. It has gone so far that a
fraternity man may talk to a freshman —actually talk
to him! —while the freshman is still on the campus. Of
course this is safeguarded to some extent by the fact
that permission must first be gotten from a sponsor;
but think of the danger should one of the sponsors be
caught napping and actually allow some conversation
to take place! Suppose the upperclassman should ask
the freshman if he is going out for football, or if he
comes from San Francisco, or how he is getting on with
his courses, or what kind of a day he thinks it will be
tomorrow. The consequences that might follow such
extreme acts can only be guessed at.
Safety first. Stop, look, and listen at all double
crossings.

Combined Association of Dink Manufacturers want an
amendment to the fight rules so that next year every
freshman who goes into the mud pit has his headgear
on. Only next year sawdust will probably be used,
superseded a year later by goose feathers, down, or
pillow slips.

What about the student movies?
Perhaps, though, it's best to wait until middle ot
winter quarter. Generally about then we get restless
because there's nothing much to complain about.

instead of spending much time and labor annually in
changing the flower beds —thereby entailing a total waste

the gardens instead? Then when the bi-weekly trans
planting period comes, and the gardeners get busy
putting something new in, the old scenery will not be
wasted. Students who eat on the campus would be
turned loose on the vegetable gardens at stated periods
—say from 1 to 1:30, and 7 to 7:30-—and without a doubt
the ground would be cleared quickly. The only cost
would be the hiring of police reserves to see that the

The rushing rules for men are obviously getting laxer
and more lax each year. It is high time to stop was
put to this loose practice. It has gone so far that a
fraternity man may talk to a freshman —actually talk
to him! —while the freshman is still on the campus. Of
course this is safeguarded to some extent by the fact
that permission must first be gotten from a sponsor;
but think of the danger should one of the sponsors be
caught napping and actually allow some conversation
to take place! Suppose the upperclassman should ask
the freshman if he is going out for football, or if he
comes from San Francisco, or how he is getting on with
his courses, or what kind of a day he thinks it will be
tomorrow. The consequences that might follow such
extreme acts can only be guessed at.
Safety first. Stop, look, and listen at all double
crossings.
