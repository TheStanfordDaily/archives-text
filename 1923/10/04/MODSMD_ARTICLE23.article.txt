## 
### 
Harry Wolter has been made all- 1
year baseball'coach and will start fall
practice at once. Wolter is anxious to
have a large turn-out.
Lower division students may sign up
for baseball as their requirement.
After a few weeks of practice Wolter
expects to secure a series of games
with nearby clubs. These will all be
practice games as the varsity schedule
does not start until next spring.
Captain "Pat" Patterson is not at'
college this quarter, but a number of
members of last year's varsity and,
freshman teams are ready for prac- 1
tice.
