# All-Year Sponsor System Is Explained by Dean Yost
## 
### 
Explanation of the system whereby
sponsoring of freshman women is to con
tinue throughout the year instead of for
the first week of collcge was made by
Dean Mary Yost at a meeting of women
sponsors last night in the Women's club
house.
Miss Yost commended the women on
their efforts in helping the freshmen to
register. I don't believe one woman came
to me really bewildered," she said. ' The
new women will look to you as human
encyclopedias. Don't misinform them.
Teach them the traditions, the customs,
and the spirit of Stanford."
The sponsors were asked to encourage
the new women to go to the reception
Saturday evening, and to attend chapel
Matriculation Sunday. â€¢
Pan-Hellenic rules will be modified for
this week to allow row sponsors to visit
their sponsettes and help them get set
tled. Carolan Strouse, head sponsor, took
the names of all women who had not
been enrolled as sponsors but wished to
serve in that capacity.
