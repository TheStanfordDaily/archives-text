# Freshmen Eleven Will Have Triple Program Saturday
## 
### 
Three games in one day is more than
enough for any football eleven. And
when the opposition consists of a trio of
teams recognized to be unusually strong,
it is evident that there should be some
trouble in conquering them all.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshmen grid
iron warriors buck up against Davis
Farm, Berkeley high, and San Jose high
Saturday. But from the showing made
last Saturday against San Diego high,
champions of the southland last year, and
the wealth of babe talent which came to
the front, it is altogether probable that
the freshmen will annex all three games.
The most interest however, will be
shown probably in the Davis Farm game
which will be run off as a preliminary to
the Stanford varsity-Nevada mix-up.
Critics are going to watch how the 1927
line functions in as much as this depart
ment on last year's babe team was weak.
Conditions this year seem to be re
versed, however, for Poulson, Swan,
Mahan, Anderson, Price, Natcher, Post,
and a half dozen other prospects are
strong linemen in any company. As evi
denced from practice so far this season
and the game a week ago, the left side
of the 1927 forward wall is without a
doubt the stronger. Shipkey at end,
Mahan, guard, and Swan at tackle are
the reasons.
Shipkey is a brother of Harry on the
varsity, and he works in his position like
a veteran. He is fast on his feet and he
can get down the field when he needs to.
His running mate, Greisser, on the other
end of the line, is also a fine end. Both
men get into nearly every play.
Long Beach high has contributed Price
at center and Anderson at right guard.
They are heavy and fast. Natcher is an
other good man for the pivotal position
and it should be a merry race between
Price and Natcher for the center.
The babes seemed to make ground eas
ily in the San Diego game, and conse
quently were not forced to uncover much.
However, they did disclose their startling
ability to pass and to' break up passes.
For many years, San Diego has sus
tained her reputation as a "passing aggre
gation," yet she did not make much head
way in this departmen tagainst the Car
dinal freshmen. Some passes were com
pleted, but the majority fell flat miser
ably or \vere intercepted.
Everyone knowt what a# undeniably
strong freshmen t|am Stanford has this
year. The games (Saturday will be no
easy task to take, but the babes should
win all three of them just the same.

Conditions this year seem to be re
versed, however, for Poulson, Swan,
Mahan, Anderson, Price, Natcher, Post,
and a half dozen other prospects are
strong linemen in any company. As evi
denced from practice so far this season
and the game a week ago, the left side
of the 1927 forward wall is without a
doubt the stronger. Shipkey at end,
Mahan, guard, and Swan at tackle are
the reasons.
Shipkey is a brother of Harry on the
varsity, and he works in his position like
a veteran. He is fast on his feet and he
can get down the field when he needs to.
His running mate, Greisser, on the other
end of the line, is also a fine end. Both
men get into nearly every play.
Long Beach high has contributed Price
at center and Anderson at right guard.
They are heavy and fast. Natcher is an
other good man for the pivotal position
and it should be a merry race between
Price and Natcher for the center.
The babes seemed to make ground eas
ily in the San Diego game, and conse
quently were not forced to uncover much.
However, they did disclose their startling
ability to pass and to' break up passes.
For many years, San Diego has sus
tained her reputation as a "passing aggre
gation," yet she did not make much head
way in this departmen tagainst the Car
dinal freshmen. Some passes were com
pleted, but the majority fell flat miser
ably or \vere intercepted.
Everyone knowt what a# undeniably
strong freshmen t|am Stanford has this
year. The games (Saturday will be no
easy task to take, but the babes should
win all three of them just the same.
Three games in one day is more than
enough for any football eleven. And
when the opposition consists of a trio of
teams recognized to be unusually strong,
it is evident that there should be some
trouble in conquering them all.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshmen grid
iron warriors buck up against Davis
Farm, Berkeley high, and San Jose high
Saturday. But from the showing made
last Saturday against San Diego high,
champions of the southland last year, and
the wealth of babe talent which came to
the front, it is altogether probable that
the freshmen will annex all three games.
The most interest however, will be
shown probably in the Davis Farm game
which will be run off as a preliminary to
the Stanford varsity-Nevada mix-up.
Critics are going to watch how the 1927
line functions in as much as this depart
ment on last year's babe team was weak.
