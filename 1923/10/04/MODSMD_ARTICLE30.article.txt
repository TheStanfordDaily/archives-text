# Two Cops in Single Uniform Squelch Fast Work on Palm Drive
## 
### 
Countless detective stories, propa
ganda yarns, and news articles have
been written emphasizing the crushing
weight of the law, but the real testi
mony comes from an Indian motor
cycle owned by the county of Santa
Clara. Upon this machine a sputter
cop weighing roughly 285 pounds
cruises about the campus, and at a dis
tance resembles a grand piano mounted
upon a bird-bath. If his zeal measures
up to his bathtub displacement, the stu
dent body will do well to sell their
machines and half-sole their shoes.
