# QUAD TRYOUTEES ARE OFFERED CHANCE FOR EXECUTIVE POSITION
## Students Are Given Chance to Learn Publishing Business 
### Carl Shoup 
Tryouts for the 1926 Quad editorship
are now being held. An explanation of
the kind of job the editor has is there
fore in order for those who consider
trying out for the position.
The job of editing a Quad affords a
chance to learn a little of every side
of the publishing business, from the
purely editorial work of writing and
correcting, to the executive duties that
come with staff organization. Each
editor is free to build up his own sys
tem when he comes into the job. as
there are no "carry-overs" from the
staff of the previous year's book. He
is likewise entirely free to use his
own ideas in the arrangement of the
book itself.
The editor has an opportunity to be
in touch with many prominent men in
the business and art world throughout
the year. Dealings with printers, en
gravers, artists, photographers, and
others in the professional world give
him an insight into affairs beyond col
lege that comes from invaluable ex
periences.
How is a painting reproduced in
color on the printed page? What are
the different kinds of print paper and
their individual advantages and dis
advantages? How many different pages
can be printed at the same time on one
press? What type of painting shows up
best in books. Should the cover repre
sent a comparatively small or large
outlay as compared with the body of
the book? These and other interesting
questions that cover a wide field are
all considered by the editor and an
swered definitely by him.
The Quad and the Daily Palo Alto
are the two biggest student publica
tions on the campus. While the editor
ship of the Quad requires ability to
write —usually only so that no mis
takes made by others may slip through
—its chief call is upon the editor's
ability to organize his staff and deal
with many professional men in a busi
ness way. Editorial writing, s»ch as
must be done for the Daily, is of
course not needed for a year-book; the
stress, lies rather upon management
and originality in the make-up of the
annual rather than upon the writing
end.
Sophomores interested in the editor
ship or managership of the 1926 Quad
will meet tonight at 7:15 in the Quad
office, upstairs in the Administration
Building. Full details concerning both
positions will be given.

Tryouts for the 1926 Quad editorship
are now being held. An explanation of
the kind of job the editor has is there
fore in order for those who consider
trying out for the position.
The job of editing a Quad affords a
chance to learn a little of every side
of the publishing business, from the
purely editorial work of writing and
correcting, to the executive duties that
come with staff organization. Each
editor is free to build up his own sys
tem when he comes into the job. as
there are no "carry-overs" from the
staff of the previous year's book. He
is likewise entirely free to use his
own ideas in the arrangement of the
book itself.
The editor has an opportunity to be
in touch with many prominent men in
the business and art world throughout
the year. Dealings with printers, en
gravers, artists, photographers, and
others in the professional world give
him an insight into affairs beyond col
lege that comes from invaluable ex
periences.
How is a painting reproduced in
color on the printed page? What are
the different kinds of print paper and
their individual advantages and dis
advantages? How many different pages
can be printed at the same time on one
press? What type of painting shows up
best in books. Should the cover repre
sent a comparatively small or large
outlay as compared with the body of
the book? These and other interesting
questions that cover a wide field are
all considered by the editor and an
swered definitely by him.
The Quad and the Daily Palo Alto
are the two biggest student publica
tions on the campus. While the editor
ship of the Quad requires ability to
write —usually only so that no mis
takes made by others may slip through
—its chief call is upon the editor's
ability to organize his staff and deal
with many professional men in a busi
ness way. Editorial writing, s»ch as
must be done for the Daily, is of
course not needed for a year-book; the
stress, lies rather upon management
and originality in the make-up of the
annual rather than upon the writing
end.
