# Cigarettes Sell for 7 Cents In Paris, Stanford Man Writes
## 
### 
A package of cigarettes for 7 cents.
Ugh! Impossible! Where? And how
often have you wished for that time
when a person could get a good square
meal for 20 cents? Not just a sand
wich, but a genuine dinner â€”seven or
eight courses and hashed to you in a
manner altogether appetizing and de
lectable?
And bearded Stanford men would
probably leave their earthly habitats
at once if they should learn that
shaves cost only 4 cents. Think of it!
And again, such a blissful place where
one may get his shoes sliined for only
a nickle.
To Stanford men, this may sound al
together too good to be true. Too
Utopian. And maybe so, for whoever
heard of such prices in America?
But in Paris, France, things are
"just a little different." A person can
live there twice as long as he can in
America on the same amount, accord
ing to a letter recently received from
Charles C. Lockett, ex-'25, who is at
tending the University of Paris this
year.
"Board and room cost me $40 a
month, and my room is so luxuriously

| furnished that nothing in San Fran
cisco hotel accommodations can ap
proach it. Prices are so low that it is
quite difficult to get used to them."
Lockett is staying with a French
family of the middle classes in Paris.
The University of Paris does not begin
its instruction until November 1, so
Lockett has been looking over the
country until college opens. "I am get
ting sick of sightseeing," he writes.
"There are too many things to see. I
have already seen hundreds of palaces
and am about 'fed up' on the many his
toric places in and about Paris which
make France so famous.
"Today, I visited Victor Hugo's ]
home and saw all of his furniture, the j
paintings in his home, and some of
his original books. He lived in a part
of the old palace of Louis XIII. Then 1
I saw the old home of Madame de Le
vigne which is now a museum. Here,
there were any number of relics dat
ing from the old Roman days down
to the last-century. France is really
a wonderful country."
Lockett will return to Stanford next
fall. He is a member of Alpha Sigma
Phi.
