last year Coach Andy Kerr reviewed the

more football this year than for seasons

Nevada but the boys will go on the field
to make the biggest score possible."
The largest crowd of the year turned
out to greet the Cardinal coach. Other
representatives from the campus were
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill and Dean George
