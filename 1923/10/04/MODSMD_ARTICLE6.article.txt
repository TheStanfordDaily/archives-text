up into thriving papers.
He has held many offices in the
Texas Press Association, being presi

The first quarter of Professor
Brown's course will be devoted espe
cially to news and editorial problems,
the second to business office and ad
vertising problems, and the third to
circulation problems.
The first quarter's work is defined
as Newspaper Management. It will in
clude a review of the country news
paper: what it is and bow it is made;
also a. study of the problems of the
executive who directs editorial and
news policies, with special reference
to small-town publications.
The relation of news and editorial
departments to advertising and circu
lation, and of news and editorial de
partments to each other will be con
sidered.
The five-hour course in advertising
is designed primarily for journalism
students and will be followed next
quarter by a detailed study of some
feature of newspaper advertising man
agement. This quarter's course in ad
vertising will include principles and
practice of advertising. The history
and development of advertising will be
reviewed briefly. Although the funda
mental problems are pertinent to all
advertising, this course will deal large
ly with the subject from the stand
point of the newspaper office.
