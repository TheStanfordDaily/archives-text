# TWO TEETH GNASHED AS PRELIMINARY TO UNDERCLASS MUD TEA
## 
### 
A tense silence, broken only by the
vicious roars of sophomores and the
answering cries of freshmen, as well
as, by the usual sounds of a busy day
on the campus, preceded the opening
of what may be known in history as
the Battle of the Goo-pits.
The march of the opposing forces to
the battleground on the bed of Lagu-
nita was well under way at 2:30 this
afternoon. In spite of the efforts of
the upperclass letter men, occasional
cries of "I just hate '27," and "Naughty
'26, — doggone 'em," came from the op-
posing ranks.
A throng of spectators lined the
banks of the lake awaiting the open-
ing of the contest. Bets of chocolates,
typewriter ribbons and even handker-
chiefs were freely made. Between the
two great mudholes, set some 200 yards
apart, a few officials scurried back and
forth, picking up burdock burrs and
pebbles in last preparations for the
muddy scene to come.
All is ready for the slobber of the
innocents; Stanford is making her
Roman holiday.
