# MILITARY CLASSES START WITH LARGE FALL REGISTRATION
## 
### 
Registration in the Military depart
ment now totals 130, according to a
statement made yesterday afternoon
by Major W. D. Geary, who is in
charge of the local unit of R. O. T. C.
Classes in the advanced and basic
work of the department started yes
terday and practical work on the field
is scheduled to begin on Monday. The
outlook for the Stanford unit promises
the best, year since its organization on
the campus.
The major part of the registration
has been made for the advanced work
in military training, and the number
of students taking this work greatly
outnumbers that of any previous year.
This increase is caused by the large
list of transfers from units of other
universities.
Students will be allowed to register
in the department without extra fee
during the first two weeks, and it is
expected by the officers that a number
of additional registrations will be
made in that time. The Military de
partment is co-operating with the
Physical department in allowing those
who are taking the military work to
participate in any of the athletic ac
tivities they desire to enter.
Equipment for those who have
signed up for the work has been is
sued." The War department at Wash
ington on September 15 authorized the
new English cut uniforms for mem
bers of the unit who are taking the
advanced work.
The department has been applying
for this special uniform for more than
two years. It is hoped that a distinct
uniform of a similar type may be se
cured for other military students. The
new uniform consists of the low-cut
lapel coat as used in the English army
with special insignia.
In speaking of the outlook for the
coming year in the military work.
Major Geary said: "With the fine
spirit shown by the members of the
Stanford unit and the loyalty mani
fested to the organization, I see no
reason why our R. O. T. C. can not
rank among the highest in the coun
try. The outlook for the coming year
is extremely promising."
