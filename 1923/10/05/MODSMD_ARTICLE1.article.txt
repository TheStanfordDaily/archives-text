# FRESHMAN GRID STARS TO MEET WE ELEVENS
## Babes to Tackle Davis Farm In Preliminary Game On Stadium Turf 
### 
Between iifty, and sixty freshmen
should be seen in action tomorrow when
Coach Hunt's freshmen football aspirants
tackle Davis Farm, Berkeley High and
San Jose High. In the morning, at 10:30,
Berkeley and San Jose will meet the
Babes, the former in the stadium and the
latter on one of the practice fields. Davis
Farm will be taken on as a preliminary to
the varsity and Nevada contest in the
stadium. The game will start at 12:30.
Very little is known concerning the two
high school elevens. San Jose has been
beaten once this season, by Sequoia Union
high school of Redwood City, the final
score reading 14-13. Berkeley high is
usually represented by a strong team, al
though reports are that this season's
squad has failed to develop as fast as
the Yellow jacket team of last year. At
that time the freshmen only managed to
squeeze out a 27-26 victory from the
high school lads. However, Berkeley may
well prove a surprise for the first year
men.
The Davis Farmers were easily beaten
by the Nevada varsity last Saturday,
41-0. But with the added experience of
this game, the agriculturists should prove
a tough nut for the 1927 team to crack.
This is a hard encounter to send the first
string babes into for their second game
of the season, and the outcome will be
interesting.
Critics will follow closely the action of
the freshman line in the game with the
Aggies. A strong line was lacking last
year; but this year's first year grid crea
tion promises to make up for the short
comings of previous seasons. Coach
Hunt's line-men are always drilled in
low, hard tackling, and this year's line
proves to be no exception. Combined with j
accurate tackling arc weight and speed.
Only one unfavorable criticism can be j
made of the showing against San Diego i
high last Saturday. The eagerness of the I
line-men to get into the play led to;
many off-side penalties.
Hyland throws the hall straight and j
fast, and the ends are past masters in the j
art of catching them.
