# OBERLIN FAVORS TRAINING IN TEACHING AND BUSINESS
## 
### 
"Teaching and business are the two
subjects at Oberlin College, Ohio,
which draw the greatest number of
students," says Professor H. L. Lutz,
formerly head of the Economics de
partment there, who recently accepted
a place on the Stanford faculty.
"There are between 1100 and 1200
students at Oberlin, at least half of
them women. Languages. English, and
classical subjects are most popular
with the women, while economics at
tracts more men than the other de
partments. There are no engineering
or technical courses offered at Ober
lin."
Professor Lutz graduated from Ober
lin in 1907, and then went to Harvard
where he spent two years taking his
master's and doctor's degrees in Eco
nomics. In 190-9, ho returned to Ober
lin and was there connected with the
Economics department. He gave sev
eral courses at Stanford in the sum
mer quarter of 1922 and came to the
campus this fall as a regular member
of the faculty.
Oberlin, Stanford Similar
Oberlin and Stanford are quite simi

lege atmosphere, according to Profes
sor Lutz.
"The greatest contrast I obtained
was between Harvard and Oberlin but
there is almost no difference between
the Stanford and Oberlin students.
Oberlin has one of the most cosmopoli
tan student bodies of any institution
in the country. Over half of the stu
dents come from states other than
Ohio. Many come from foreign lands,
particularly the Far East. Some are
attracted by the Music Conservatory;
others by the seminary which singu
larly has only about twenty-five stu
dents in it.
"Oberlin has student government,
being ruled by the United Students.
The men and women have their sepa
rate organizations also. The honor sys
tem is in vogue and has proved suc
cessful. Compulsory chapel services
are held four days a week for half an
hour each. Every cut in chapol counts
one-third of a regular class cut. Stu
dents can cut all they desire but an
excess adds to their requirements for
graduation.
Oberlin Has "Bag Rush"
