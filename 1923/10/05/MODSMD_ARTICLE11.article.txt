# OBERLIN FAVORS TRAINING IN TEACHING AND BUSINESS
## 
### 
"Teaching and business are the two
subjects at Oberlin College, Ohio,
which draw the greatest number of
students," says Professor H. L. Lutz,
formerly head of the Economics de
partment there, who recently accepted
a place on the Stanford faculty.
"There are between 1100 and 1200
students at Oberlin, at least half of
them women. Languages. English, and
classical subjects are most popular
with the women, while economics at
tracts more men than the other de
partments. There are no engineering
or technical courses offered at Ober
lin."
Professor Lutz graduated from Ober
lin in 1907, and then went to Harvard
where he spent two years taking his
master's and doctor's degrees in Eco
nomics. In 190-9, ho returned to Ober
lin and was there connected with the
Economics department. He gave sev
eral courses at Stanford in the sum
mer quarter of 1922 and came to the
campus this fall as a regular member
of the faculty.
Oberlin, Stanford Similar
Oberlin and Stanford are quite simi
lar in the type of student and the col

lege atmosphere, according to Profes
sor Lutz.
"The greatest contrast I obtained
was between Harvard and Oberlin but
there is almost no difference between
the Stanford and Oberlin students.
Oberlin has one of the most cosmopoli
tan student bodies of any institution
in the country. Over half of the stu
dents come from states other than
Ohio. Many come from foreign lands,
particularly the Far East. Some are
attracted by the Music Conservatory;
others by the seminary which singu
larly has only about twenty-five stu
dents in it.
"Oberlin has student government,
being ruled by the United Students.
The men and women have their sepa
rate organizations also. The honor sys
tem is in vogue and has proved suc
cessful. Compulsory chapel services
are held four days a week for half an
hour each. Every cut in chapol counts
one-third of a regular class cut. Stu
dents can cut all they desire but an
excess adds to their requirements for
graduation.
Oberlin Has "Bag Rush"
"In the fall, the freshmen and sopho-
mores liave their annual struggle
which consists of a bag ru√üh. In for
mer years a tie-up was in order. Spirit
runs high at Oberiin, due largely to
intramural activities. A program for
intramural athletics similar to that at
Stanford has been inaugurated. Com
pulsory work is required for the first
two years and credit given. Upper
classmen can also sign up for work
and obtain credit, but in either case,
requirements for graduation are in
creased, so actually no credit is given.
"First year courses at Oberiin are
nearly all mapped out by the faculty.
A course in Bible is one requirement
and is quite popular with the students.
It is much harder to change a course
there than here at Stanford and a fine
is imposed if a change is deemed ne
cessary. Students take their work and
the selection of their courses more
seriously there. They also spend more
time and effort in preparing for their
final examinations.
"The number of students attending
Oberiin is limited by the accommoda
tions which provide for about 1200. No
student is admitted from the lower
third of his high school class and
those desiring to enter from uncredited
schools must pass entrance examina
tions.
'.'One of the finest features of the
institution is the mixing of the two
sexes on the campus. The girls all
live in dormitories and the fellows in
the halls or private homes, but all
eat together in various eating halls.
There are no fraternities or eating
clubs at Oberiin and the students
mingle freely and without restraint.
Sometimes they are with each other
too much, according to some profes
sors, who think they do too much 'fus
sing.' But the idea develops a fine
spirit of democracy."
