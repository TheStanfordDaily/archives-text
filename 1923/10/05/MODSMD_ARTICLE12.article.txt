# CARD VARSITY CLASHES WITH NEVADA TOMORROW
## Silver Wolves Will Send Strongest Eleven in History to Oppose Stanford in First Game 
### William Wright, '25 
Nevada will appear in the Stadium Saturday afternoon at 2:30 to offer the
varsity eleven the first real opposition of the 1923 season. Back in 1913 or so,
Coach Jack Glascock sent a rugged team down from Reno which proceeded
to burn up every institution of note on the Coast and leave them in ruins,
and the press notices drifting in from the Sagebrush university indicate
strongly that another such proceeding is expected—by them, at least. Coach
Kerr confidently expects a hot brawl, but has no intention of allowing (he
Wolf Pack to carry home anything beside their suitcases.
Last year the varsity dusted Nevada by 21 to 7, with the Nevada score
coming as a full-blooded fluke. This year Nevada lias a better team—sup
porters say it is the best team that has ever represented them on a gridiron.
The Cards have developed much more rapidly, and may lay claim to being as
good, if not much better, than they were when they last met the Silver

Wolves. All of which proves exactly
nothing, except that it will be a worthy
debate. Nevada has been pointing and
training for this Nevada game—after
that they will be pointed at California.
Nevada will not lose easily, nor will
Stanford.
Third Game for Nevada
Two earlier games have helped the
Wolf Pack to get a line on their men,
and develop team play. After taking a
beating from the Olympic Club they
handed one to the Davis Farm, by a
41 to 0 count. These games showed
that the successor to "Rabbit" Brad
shaw and "Bunny" Hug has come
along in the person of Billy Gutteron,
abbreviated quarterback, whose style
of play is said to resemble Bradshaw's.
Last year the Cards kept Hug so close
to home that Scranton, this year's
captain, gained most of the ground.
Scranton will be back, in case the
same thing happens to Gutteron. This
man ran wild against the Olympic
Club, picking up two fumbles for long
gains, individually breaking up three
Olympic touchdowns, and gaining
plenty of ground around the ends.
Hobbs is another Nevadan who will
bear watching, if the Wolf Pack bores
within kicking distance of the Stan
ford cross-bar. He lifted one 45 yards
from placement, for the only score
Nevada made against the Winged "O",
and is said to divide honors with Cap
tain Scranton at line plunging.
Coach "Corky" Courtwright is not
expected to use his accustomed profu
sion of forward passes, due to newly
