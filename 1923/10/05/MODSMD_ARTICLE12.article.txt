# CARD VARSITY CLASHES WITH NEVADA TOMORROW
## Silver Wolves Will Send Strongest Eleven in History to Oppose Stanford in First Game 
### William Wright, '25 
Nevada will appear in the Stadium Saturday afternoon at 2:30 to offer the
varsity eleven the first real opposition of the 1923 season. Back in 1913 or so,
Coach Jack Glascock sent a rugged team down from Reno which proceeded
to burn up every institution of note on the Coast and leave them in ruins,
and the press notices drifting in from the Sagebrush university indicate
strongly that another such proceeding is expected—by them, at least. Coach
Kerr confidently expects a hot brawl, but has no intention of allowing (he
Wolf Pack to carry home anything beside their suitcases.
Last year the varsity dusted Nevada by 21 to 7, with the Nevada score
coming as a full-blooded fluke. This year Nevada lias a better team—sup
porters say it is the best team that has ever represented them on a gridiron.
The Cards have developed much more rapidly, and may lay claim to being as
good, if not much better, than they were when they last met the Silver

Wolves. All of which proves exactly
nothing, except that it will be a worthy
debate. Nevada has been pointing and
training for this Nevada game—after
that they will be pointed at California.
Nevada will not lose easily, nor will
Stanford.
Third Game for Nevada
Two earlier games have helped the
Wolf Pack to get a line on their men,
and develop team play. After taking a
beating from the Olympic Club they
handed one to the Davis Farm, by a
41 to 0 count. These games showed
that the successor to "Rabbit" Brad
shaw and "Bunny" Hug has come
along in the person of Billy Gutteron,
abbreviated quarterback, whose style
of play is said to resemble Bradshaw's.
Last year the Cards kept Hug so close
to home that Scranton, this year's
captain, gained most of the ground.
Scranton will be back, in case the
same thing happens to Gutteron. This
man ran wild against the Olympic
Club, picking up two fumbles for long
gains, individually breaking up three
Olympic touchdowns, and gaining
plenty of ground around the ends.
Hobbs is another Nevadan who will
bear watching, if the Wolf Pack bores
within kicking distance of the Stan
ford cross-bar. He lifted one 45 yards
from placement, for the only score
Nevada made against the Winged "O",
and is said to divide honors with Cap
tain Scranton at line plunging.
Coach "Corky" Courtwright is not
expected to use his accustomed profu
sion of forward passes, due to newly
discovered talent at bucking the line. J
Scranton went through the Davis line
for thirty or forty yards on several
occasions, and passes seem overshad
owed. The dope states that they are i
on tap, however, in case they are.
needed, together with a large assort
ment of new plays.
Nevada Line Improved
The Nevada line has been worked
over and greatly improved, and the
entire team will be in the best of con
dition. The largest delegation of root
ers ever sent to this state by Nevada
will be oil hand in the Stadium. So
much for Nevada.
Against all this optimism Kerr will
send a team that knows football, plays
it, has as good material as last year,
and has absorbed the winning spirit.
It is a preliminary game, and the de
feat of Nevada is secondary to the im
provement of the Stanford machine.
Nevertheless, it will be a great shock
to the Cards if they are beaten. The
team is almost at mid-season form,
judging from previous standards, and
that fact alone makes it a pretty good
collegiate eleven. Nevada has the best
material in history; Stanford is off to
the best start in a long time.
Kerr's tentative line-up is practically
the same as the one he started against
Mare Island a week ago. and holds no
surprises. Thomas will go in at left
end, Shipkey at tackle, and Cravens
at guard. Baker appears at center,
with right guard cinched by Faville.
Ludeke or Chuck Johnston will per
form at tackle, and the call for end
lies between Dole and Middleton.
Captain "Scotch" Campbell will di
rect the team at quarterback, with
Nevers at full. Left half is undecided
between Cleaveland and Dennis, with
either Paul Murray or Woodward
across the way. Chuck Johnston and
Jim Lawson were yesterday reinstated
by the Scholarship Committee, and
this may mave an important bearing
on their appearance in the line-up.
Nevada's tentative eleven is Hobbs
and Harrison, ends; Bridley and Carl
son, tackles; Donnels and Overton.!
guards; Duborg, center; Gutterton,
quarterback; Captain Scranton and
Jones, halfbacks, and Brown, fullback.

Kerr confidently expects a hot brawl, but has no intention of allowing (he

The Cards have developed much more rapidly, and may lay claim to being as
good, if not much better, than they were when they last met the Silver

Wolves. All of which proves exactly

training for this Nevada game—after
that they will be pointed at California.
Nevada will not lose easily, nor will
Stanford.
Third Game for Nevada
Two earlier games have helped the
Wolf Pack to get a line on their men,
and develop team play. After taking a
beating from the Olympic Club they
handed one to the Davis Farm, by a
41 to 0 count. These games showed
that the successor to "Rabbit" Brad
shaw and "Bunny" Hug has come
along in the person of Billy Gutteron,
abbreviated quarterback, whose style
of play is said to resemble Bradshaw's.
Last year the Cards kept Hug so close
to home that Scranton, this year's
captain, gained most of the ground.
Scranton will be back, in case the
same thing happens to Gutteron. This
man ran wild against the Olympic
Club, picking up two fumbles for long
gains, individually breaking up three
Olympic touchdowns, and gaining
plenty of ground around the ends.
Hobbs is another Nevadan who will
bear watching, if the Wolf Pack bores
within kicking distance of the Stan
ford cross-bar. He lifted one 45 yards
from placement, for the only score
Nevada made against the Winged "O",
and is said to divide honors with Cap
tain Scranton at line plunging.
Coach "Corky" Courtwright is not
expected to use his accustomed profu
sion of forward passes, due to newly
discovered talent at bucking the line. J
Scranton went through the Davis line
for thirty or forty yards on several
occasions, and passes seem overshad

ment of new plays.
Nevada Line Improved
The Nevada line has been worked
over and greatly improved, and the
entire team will be in the best of con
dition. The largest delegation of root
ers ever sent to this state by Nevada
will be oil hand in the Stadium. So
much for Nevada.
Against all this optimism Kerr will
send a team that knows football, plays
it, has as good material as last year,
and has absorbed the winning spirit.
It is a preliminary game, and the de
feat of Nevada is secondary to the im
provement of the Stanford machine.
Nevertheless, it will be a great shock
to the Cards if they are beaten. The
team is almost at mid-season form,
judging from previous standards, and
that fact alone makes it a pretty good
collegiate eleven. Nevada has the best
material in history; Stanford is off to
the best start in a long time.
Kerr's tentative line-up is practically
the same as the one he started against
Mare Island a week ago. and holds no
surprises. Thomas will go in at left
end, Shipkey at tackle, and Cravens
at guard. Baker appears at center,
with right guard cinched by Faville.
Ludeke or Chuck Johnston will per
form at tackle, and the call for end
lies between Dole and Middleton.
Captain "Scotch" Campbell will di
rect the team at quarterback, with
Nevers at full. Left half is undecided
between Cleaveland and Dennis, with
either Paul Murray or Woodward
across the way. Chuck Johnston and
Jim Lawson were yesterday reinstated
by the Scholarship Committee, and

Nevada will appear in the Stadium Saturday afternoon at 2:30 to offer the
varsity eleven the first real opposition of the 1923 season. Back in 1913 or so,
Coach Jack Glascock sent a rugged team down from Reno which proceeded
to burn up every institution of note on the Coast and leave them in ruins,
and the press notices drifting in from the Sagebrush university indicate
strongly that another such proceeding is expected—by them, at least. Coach
Kerr confidently expects a hot brawl, but has no intention of allowing (he
Wolf Pack to carry home anything beside their suitcases.
Last year the varsity dusted Nevada by 21 to 7, with the Nevada score
coming as a full-blooded fluke. This year Nevada lias a better team—sup
porters say it is the best team that has ever represented them on a gridiron.
The Cards have developed much more rapidly, and may lay claim to being as
good, if not much better, than they were when they last met the Silver

Wolves. All of which proves exactly
nothing, except that it will be a worthy
debate. Nevada has been pointing and
training for this Nevada game—after
that they will be pointed at California.
Nevada will not lose easily, nor will
Stanford.
Third Game for Nevada
Two earlier games have helped the
Wolf Pack to get a line on their men,
and develop team play. After taking a
beating from the Olympic Club they
handed one to the Davis Farm, by a
41 to 0 count. These games showed
that the successor to "Rabbit" Brad
shaw and "Bunny" Hug has come
along in the person of Billy Gutteron,
abbreviated quarterback, whose style
of play is said to resemble Bradshaw's.
Last year the Cards kept Hug so close
to home that Scranton, this year's
captain, gained most of the ground.
Scranton will be back, in case the
same thing happens to Gutteron. This
man ran wild against the Olympic
Club, picking up two fumbles for long
gains, individually breaking up three
Olympic touchdowns, and gaining
plenty of ground around the ends.
Hobbs is another Nevadan who will
bear watching, if the Wolf Pack bores
within kicking distance of the Stan
ford cross-bar. He lifted one 45 yards
from placement, for the only score
Nevada made against the Winged "O",
and is said to divide honors with Cap
tain Scranton at line plunging.
Coach "Corky" Courtwright is not
expected to use his accustomed profu
sion of forward passes, due to newly
discovered talent at bucking the line. J
Scranton went through the Davis line
for thirty or forty yards on several
occasions, and passes seem overshad
owed. The dope states that they are i
on tap, however, in case they are.
needed, together with a large assort
ment of new plays.
Nevada Line Improved
The Nevada line has been worked
over and greatly improved, and the
entire team will be in the best of con
dition. The largest delegation of root
ers ever sent to this state by Nevada
will be oil hand in the Stadium. So
much for Nevada.
Against all this optimism Kerr will
send a team that knows football, plays
it, has as good material as last year,
and has absorbed the winning spirit.
It is a preliminary game, and the de
feat of Nevada is secondary to the im
provement of the Stanford machine.
Nevertheless, it will be a great shock
to the Cards if they are beaten. The
team is almost at mid-season form,
judging from previous standards, and
that fact alone makes it a pretty good
collegiate eleven. Nevada has the best
material in history; Stanford is off to
the best start in a long time.
Kerr's tentative line-up is practically
the same as the one he started against
Mare Island a week ago. and holds no
surprises. Thomas will go in at left
end, Shipkey at tackle, and Cravens
at guard. Baker appears at center,
with right guard cinched by Faville.
Ludeke or Chuck Johnston will per
form at tackle, and the call for end
lies between Dole and Middleton.
Captain "Scotch" Campbell will di
rect the team at quarterback, with
Nevers at full. Left half is undecided
between Cleaveland and Dennis, with
either Paul Murray or Woodward
across the way. Chuck Johnston and
Jim Lawson were yesterday reinstated
by the Scholarship Committee, and
this may mave an important bearing
on their appearance in the line-up.
