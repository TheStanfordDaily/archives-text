# CAMP SEARSVILLE PROVES POPULAR IN SUMMER SEASON
## 
### 
Ernst Brandsten's Lake Searsville
camp, which lias become a popular
rendezvous for campers and swimming
parties during the five months of its
existence, was the scene of the Na
tional High Diving Championship meet
held under the auspices of the A. A. U.
on September 2. Clarence Pinkston,
'23, now performing for the Olympic
Club, was the victor, with A1 White,
'24, a close second. Both of these divers
are proteges of Brandsten.
The high diving platform erected on
the dam is unusually good, according
to no less an authority than A1 White,
and due to the splendid facilities of
the camp, and the improvements
which are constantly being made, it is
hoped that the district tryouts for the
1924 Olympic games will be held there.
When the Camp opens in April there
will be a store on the east side of the
lake where barbecue lunches will be
served, and three large stretches of
clared beach will be adequately cov
ered with the finest sand available. A
large supply of rowboats and floats
will also be available.
