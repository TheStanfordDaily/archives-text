# FUNDAMENTALS
## 
### 
Andy Kerr has been talking, exhorting, and drill
ing the Stanford football squad for a year on one
principle—fundamentals first.
Until they know the game, from the bottom up
and end to end, he will continue to hammer this nail
into the heads of all in moleskins. Thereby he hopes
to have a team, a system, and a string of final scores
up to the standard set by the Warner system.
Yesterday came an announcement quite in line with
the Kerr method of doing things. To quote the head
coach: "When 1 am informed that any man is low
in his studies 1 shall forbid him the field until he has
brought them up."
The fundamental reason for any one's arrival at
college is to get an education, to learn as much as
possible of what the University has to offer in the
four years ordinarily allotted. The coaching staff
has recognized this, and has given fair warning that
there will lie no toleration this year of the over-en
thusiastic devotion to athletics which caused much
unfortunate publicity last January.
A vision of future teams and future victories would
be sadly marred if one always had to discount—as
has been done too much in the past —for those whose
regard for the glory of the Cardinal makes them
lose sight of the primary reason for their privilege
of wearing a red shirt on the athletic field. Andy
Kerr, building for the future, is guarding against
such rifts in the athletic lute.
Nor is the threat of dismissal from the field en
tirely a sour pill for future good. There are plenty
of past and present block "S" men who will testify
that a few players in the line-up who are worried
about studies will, by the blue haze which envelopes
them, do more to lower the morale of the squad than
a couple of stinging defeats.
Such considerations of future smoke-ups seem a
light matter during the first week of classes, but for
the head coach, who is responsible for team and in
dividuals from now until December, they are of first
importance. The announcement made in the Daily
Palo Alto last night is another assurance by Andy
Kerr that the 1923 varsity will rest on a firm founda
tion of fundamentals before everv kick-off.
