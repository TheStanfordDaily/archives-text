Complaint has been made that students are again
riding on the rear end of street cars, in much peril of
nfe and doctor hills. A suggestion has been made
the Daily Palo Alto advocate some method where
by students who are in too great hurry be prevented
from thus endangering themselves.
We therefore recommend that the street cars have
platforms of suitable-width installed on the rear end.

Yesterday the Campus was greeted by the highly
artistic expression of the aims and ideals of the mem
bers of the sophomore class, placed with becoming
modesty where most people would walk on them.
Aside from the blood-curdling threats of tub and
paddles, which constituted nothing more than a
threat against the safety of the sophomores them
selves, the subjection of the freshman class to '26's
style of poetic literature is a form of hazing which
should merit the most severe penalty.
