TODAY IS PERSONAL GRIEVANCE DAY
Declares Campus Not Well Posted
Head of Complaint Department, Cabbages. Sir:
It is with regret not unmingled with sorrow that I
note the class of '26 is trying to make money (probably
so they can go and break up an automobile. That's lots
of fun). I refer to the pernicious practice of issuing
posters, five of which are carefully saved out to be
pasted on the pavements, while the other 995 are put
on sale at 25c per poster. Back in the good old days,
even as early as 1921, it was customary to lay the
majority of the posters on the streets, poles, etc., where
all might look. Then a few were put on sale so that
the freshman would have something to send home to his
folks. But now
Well, commercialism is at the bottom of it. And I'm
for free trade, reading, and lunch.

NOTEABLE UNDERGRADUATE DISCOVERED
Cabbages, Dear Sir:
I note that at the assembly yesterday a freshman was
seen jotting down notes on the President's lecture with
every intent of studying and using them. Is this not a
violation of tradition that should be looked after by the
sophomores.
Yrs. truly— —DISGUSTED.

Dear Sir:
I do not believe that ever, in any circumstance, have
I been used so roughly as I was this morning. It seems
only fair that I, as a well-bred and gentlemanly new
student, should be given a chance to express my opinion
of the ruffians that are mistakenly allowed to frequent
this noble place of education.
mistakenly allowed to frequent this noble place of educa
tion.
I refer to my sincere effort to obtain a post-office box
this morning. Chancing to arise fairly early, at six
o'clock, as is my usual custom, I went for a stroll before
breakfast. Upon nearing the post-office I saw what ap
peared to be a long line of men and women, each one
standing behind the other, if you grasp my idea. On
closer approach, I perceived I was right, and upon
inquiry was told that it was post-office box day. I
placed myself at the end of the line, and, musing, fell
into a state of abstract thinking. I awoke suddenly
from my reverie an hour later when shoved into the
gutter by some coarse person, and found myself in front
of the art gallery; whereas, I had stationed myself
originally in front of the women's clubhouse. Is that
right, I inquire?
At any rate, the fellow in front of me didn't get any
box either, and, in my opinion, it served him right. He
was no gentleman.
Sincerely yours,
HORACE GREENBAC, Class of 1927.

It is rumored that the Anti-Tobacco League will es
tablish a chapter on the campus.
If so —well, the Stanford calendar for 1924:
Jan. 1. —Huge bonfire consumes 10,000 Lucky Strikes to
bring in New Year. Song and dance
effects by members of the Anti-League.
Jan. 10.—Three students jailed for smoking publicly in
student movies.
Jan. 23. —Armed raid on five organizations results in
confiscation of 234 sacks Durham, 45 car
tons taiiormades, 678 boxes matches, and
2 cigar-ligliters. Booty dumped in bay
off Coyote Point amid celebration.
p e b. 14.—Four early-season track men suspended for
showing too much smoke.
March 17.—Forty hours added td graduation require
ments of student found with nicotine
stains on fingers and address of cigarette
manufacturer sewed in coat lining.
April 1. —Last student in University arrested for going
to a fire.
A THOUGHT FOR YESTERDAY
—By X. X. X.
Ten million pecans are consumed yearly by the
Pekingese.
* * *
Oscar Blumph, the campus handy man, has come
around with an efficient idea that is now submitted for
consideration by the proper authorities. We charge
nothing for this service, it being the aim of Cabbages to
always make the campus a different place to live in.
Anyway, here it is:
* * *
Well, Toyon Club has held its first meeting. It is
rumored that the chief business transacted was the
framing of suitable resolutions of contempt at the
backwardness of the Branner men in getting together.
"No organization at —all." But the big question now is
—who will be the political boss of the campus—Sequoia,
Encina, Branner, or Toyon? For the best answer to
this question we shall give absolutely nothing.

Head of Complaint Department, Cabbages. Sir:
It is with regret not unmingled with sorrow that I
note the class of '26 is trying to make money (probably
so they can go and break up an automobile. That's lots
of fun). I refer to the pernicious practice of issuing
posters, five of which are carefully saved out to be
pasted on the pavements, while the other 995 are put
on sale at 25c per poster. Back in the good old days,
even as early as 1921, it was customary to lay the
majority of the posters on the streets, poles, etc., where
all might look. Then a few were put on sale so that
the freshman would have something to send home to his
folks. But now

Dear Sir:
I do not believe that ever, in any circumstance, have
I been used so roughly as I was this morning. It seems
only fair that I, as a well-bred and gentlemanly new
student, should be given a chance to express my opinion
of the ruffians that are mistakenly allowed to frequent
this noble place of education.
mistakenly allowed to frequent this noble place of educa
tion.
I refer to my sincere effort to obtain a post-office box
this morning. Chancing to arise fairly early, at six
o'clock, as is my usual custom, I went for a stroll before
breakfast. Upon nearing the post-office I saw what ap
peared to be a long line of men and women, each one
standing behind the other, if you grasp my idea. On
closer approach, I perceived I was right, and upon
inquiry was told that it was post-office box day. I
placed myself at the end of the line, and, musing, fell
into a state of abstract thinking. I awoke suddenly
from my reverie an hour later when shoved into the
gutter by some coarse person, and found myself in front
of the art gallery; whereas, I had stationed myself
originally in front of the women's clubhouse. Is that
right, I inquire?
At any rate, the fellow in front of me didn't get any
box either, and, in my opinion, it served him right. He
was no gentleman.
Sincerely yours,

standing behind the other, if you grasp my idea. On
closer approach, I perceived I was right, and upon
inquiry was told that it was post-office box day. I
placed myself at the end of the line, and, musing, fell
into a state of abstract thinking. I awoke suddenly
from my reverie an hour later when shoved into the
gutter by some coarse person, and found myself in front
of the art gallery; whereas, I had stationed myself
originally in front of the women's clubhouse. Is that
right, I inquire?
At any rate, the fellow in front of me didn't get any
box either, and, in my opinion, it served him right. He
was no gentleman.
Sincerely yours,
HORACE GREENBAC, Class of 1927.

TODAY IS PERSONAL GRIEVANCE DAY
Declares Campus Not Well Posted
Head of Complaint Department, Cabbages. Sir:
It is with regret not unmingled with sorrow that I
note the class of '26 is trying to make money (probably
so they can go and break up an automobile. That's lots
of fun). I refer to the pernicious practice of issuing
posters, five of which are carefully saved out to be
pasted on the pavements, while the other 995 are put
on sale at 25c per poster. Back in the good old days,
even as early as 1921, it was customary to lay the
majority of the posters on the streets, poles, etc., where
all might look. Then a few were put on sale so that
the freshman would have something to send home to his
folks. But now
Well, commercialism is at the bottom of it. And I'm
for free trade, reading, and lunch.

NOTEABLE UNDERGRADUATE DISCOVERED
Cabbages, Dear Sir:
I note that at the assembly yesterday a freshman was
seen jotting down notes on the President's lecture with
every intent of studying and using them. Is this not a
violation of tradition that should be looked after by the
sophomores.
Yrs. truly— —DISGUSTED.

"THE LINE-UP FOR TODAY "
Editor, Cabbages, Daily Palo Alto.
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Sir:
I do not believe that ever, in any circumstance, have
I been used so roughly as I was this morning. It seems
only fair that I, as a well-bred and gentlemanly new
student, should be given a chance to express my opinion
of the ruffians that are mistakenly allowed to frequent
this noble place of education.
mistakenly allowed to frequent this noble place of educa
tion.
I refer to my sincere effort to obtain a post-office box
this morning. Chancing to arise fairly early, at six
o'clock, as is my usual custom, I went for a stroll before
breakfast. Upon nearing the post-office I saw what ap
peared to be a long line of men and women, each one
standing behind the other, if you grasp my idea. On
closer approach, I perceived I was right, and upon
inquiry was told that it was post-office box day. I
placed myself at the end of the line, and, musing, fell
into a state of abstract thinking. I awoke suddenly
from my reverie an hour later when shoved into the
gutter by some coarse person, and found myself in front
of the art gallery; whereas, I had stationed myself
originally in front of the women's clubhouse. Is that

At any rate, the fellow in front of me didn't get any
box either, and, in my opinion, it served him right. He
was no gentleman.
