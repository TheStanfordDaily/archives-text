# RESIDENTS OF TOYON PLAYING LEAP-FROG WITH SAW-HORSES
## 
### 
Residents of Toyon hall are becom
ing quite proficient as high-low hurd
lers, steeple-chasers, or whatever is
the proper term for a gent who leaps
over his laundry bag, a saw-horse, ex
pert plasterer, and the Comptroller's
automobile on his way to class.
The influx of students into the new
dormitories caught the construction
gang figuratively without suspenders
or belt. With buckets of nails to trip
over on the way down the hall alter
dark, ladders to walk under duiing
the painters' working hours, and til
ing experts who are just as likely as
not to declare Mah Jongg with an
upperclass cranium as the last ivory,;
residents in the new structure are lead-|
ing that pleasant life attributed to the
boilermaker who ran an obstacle race
with a mountain goat.
