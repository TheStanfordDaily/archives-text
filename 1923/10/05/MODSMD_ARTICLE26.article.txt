# THE 						AISLE SEAT

### 
Right after what was supposed to
be the most spectacular exhibition of
underclass animosity yet seen on the
Stanford campus comes the announce
ment that the community is to be
treated to "the most sensational and
thrilling fire scenes, startling in their
heroic climaxes."
The name of the thriller was "The
Midnight Alarm." For those people
who are in the habit of setting their
alarms for midnight perhaps the spec
tacular spine ticklers would be some
thing of apleasant variety. But for the
majority the climaxes were like those
occurring at 7:55 Monday, Wednes
day, and Friday—something to be
slept throug peacefully.
After working that off our critical
chest, we can go ahead freely and
point out the redeeming features.
Front and center is Percy Marmont,
one of the most English-looking Eng
lishmen in films, but withal pleasant

to watch, and capable of some real i
acting except when the climaxes rise
beyond his reach into the rosy realms'
of hokum. The leading lady is—well, I
see her, and then tell us,about it.
The best thing about the program is
the announcement that the present in
stallment is the last of the serial,

"Leather Pushers." The serial was all
right as a serial, and compares favor
ably with "The Clutching Hand," but
as modern movie entertainment it is
as bad as the stories by H. C. Witwer
were good—common complaint, that,
among cinemized short stories.
