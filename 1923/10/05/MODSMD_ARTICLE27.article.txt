# Student Stampede on Store Starts Slogan "Just Out of That"
## 
### 
Well, perhaps Sticky did stick 'em,
and perchance Greene's and Meyer's
stores did rake in a few innocent
shekels that might just as well be
diverted into (he social betterment
scheme for making the Union a more
sumptuous sanctum in which to spend
spare moments, but the carefully dis
guised fact remains that one could
usually get something by passing over
the required stipend.
Now all is different. The stricken
stude with a gnawing sensation in the
pit of his much-neglected bread basket
asks for an inoffensive Nabisco or a
keg of nails and invariably receives
the reply that "we're just out of 'em."
Oswald even remarked that an en
terprising young drummer might get
an order to install a gas cigar-lighter
inasmuch as those craving a light can t
buy a match.
