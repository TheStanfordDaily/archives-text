# Farm May Be Subdivided Into Exclusile Home Sites
## 
### 
Subdivision of 7000' acres of the old
Stanford Farm into exclusive suburban
estates is a prospect for the near fu
ture if the preliminary steps taken by
Comptroller A. E. Roth are followed
up by the Board of Trustees. Prac
tically the whole of the Stanford hold
ings in this vicinity with the excep
tion of the 1500 acres which are to be
devoted perpetually to educational
purposes will be included in the plans
for developing the foothills.
Roth returned this morning from Los
Angeles where for two days he was in
conference with nation wide authori
ties on city planning and landscape ar
chitecture with whom he discussed the
development of a large portion of the
campus into the finest residential sec
tion on the peninsula.
The project of putting a part of the
University's real estate on the market
has been before the Board of Trustees
for over a year and a small tract with
the Mayfield City limits has already
been offered to the public. The rest
of the land will be put on the market a
tract at a time, each as a unit of the
whole,and all carrying out the general
plan.
Roth stated that while no definite
steps had been taken by the officers
of the Univescity, he has been investi
gating the proposition for some time
and that it is probable that action will
be taken in the near future. While in
Los Angeles he inspected the Palos
Verdes Estates near San Pedro and
the Palisades project at Santa Monica,
both of which are large scale develop
ments of restricted residence proper
ties.
"The possibilities of the old Stan
ford Farm when opened up according
to the latest plans tax the imagina
tion,"the comptroller said. "We can
make a district there that will be to
San Francisco and the peninsula what

Forest Hills is to New York."
While in the South I talked to Fred
rick Law Olmstead, the nationally
known landscape architect and one of
the men who originally designed the
Stanford campus, and to Charles H.
Cheney the city planning expert who
has drawn up plans for Palo Alto,
Portland, and Santa Barbara. Both of
these men were impressed with the
local project and offered many sug
gestions in regard to the new scheme.
"If the present tenative plans meet
the approval of the University authori
ties more definite plans will be drawn
up for the new district. The general
scheme of the Stanford campus will
be followed throughout and the Stan
ford style of architecture will* prevail
in all structures erected on the tract.
Experts will be engaged to lay out the
roads with a view of making the most
of the natural beauty of the hills. Re
strictions will be made high enough to
insure a high grade type of building,
but. while provision will be made for
many estates which will compare fa
vorably with the best in the country,
there will be sections opened for smal
ler homes. A golf course and recrea
tion center will be included in the lay
out of the property."
"While it is only lately that any
actual steps toward opening up the
University lands have been made the
proposition has been before the of
ficers for a long time. Over a year ago
T was authorized to put a portion of the
Farm adjoining Mayfield on the mar
ket. Already two leases have been tak
en on this land and the new Mayfield
school stands in the center of the sub
division. It was this policy that lead
to the leasing of a site on the highway
for a new hotel."
Roth will lay his report on the sub
ject before the University authorities
in the near future.
