# Seniors to Begin Football Practice Monday Afternoon
## 
### 
Interclass football practice begins
at 4 p. m. on Monday when the Senior
pigskin aspirants will line up for prac
tice on the Interclass field near the
Military Headquarters. All "Holdovers"
are eligible for Senior Class competi
tion and are urged to report by Dan
Gage, Senior Class president, and
"Hap"Kennedy, manager.
Although last year's Junior Class
held the cellar race for the athletic
trophy for interclass competition, a
win in football this season would give
the Class a leg on the trophy which
would help to uphold the tradition of
Senior Classes in obtaining temporary
possession of the coveted cup.
Several good practice games have
been arranged and as this will be the
last chance for upper classmen to wear
a football uniform, a large turn-out is
expected on Monday.
