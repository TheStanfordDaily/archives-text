# Splashes from the Mudholes

### 
No matter what the mere men may
think about the new fight, this day
light saving plan is proving popular
with the ladies of the University. For
the first time in history, they got a
close-up view of the brutal males
spreading each other over the scenery
and they did have the best time.
* * *
Feminine fight fans, incidentally,
proved that they have a good sense of
fair play. In the course of the battle,
one; gent hauled off and popped an
other gent one of those crushing blows.
Came a gentle voice, "Oh, don't whang
him!" So the whanger was removed
from the struggle by official order.
* * *
Tom Irwin, '23, as well as Carl
Shoup, '24, and "Nip" McHouse,'24,
likewise, were disqualified early in the
row. It later developed, however, that
the gentlemen did not fall in, nor were
they shoved. They merely stood too
close; but the effect was almost as
good.
* * *
As the result of one unfortunate oc
currence, it was decided by the fresh
man class that suspenders will be
worn by the well-dressed man next sea
son. The passing of the gallus was
sincerely mourned by one poor mud
soaked frosli yesterday

Greased backs and no shirts may
have advantages, but they don't go
too well when the backs come in con
tact with the burdocks which carpet
the lake bottom. The '25 horde last
year fought on lawns; their imitators
neglected to supply that little detail.
* * *
"Just like a jolly-up," cried one spec-|
tator as the rush began yesterday;,
and the comparison is a happy one, J
although the jolly-up is usually quite
a bit rougher. The jolly-up touch was
even more noticeable when the on-j
lookers surged forward in the attempt
to get a better view until they were
fairly trampling the toes of the
dancers —beg pardon; we mean bat
tlers.

And those who came to cough re
mained to sneeze. Seems as if some
thing might be done to lay the dust in
that lake bed.
* * *
While the medals are being dished
out, how about the genial police, who
risked life, limb, and the pursuit of
happiness in chasing out those double
dealing reptiles, who, having been
ducked, tried to go back at it again.
* * *
Now that rules are the rule, why
not a rule regulating the spectators?
Ringside seats were at a premium, and
the well-known celluloid rat had an
immortal cinch compared to the war
correspondent trying to view the thing
as a whole.
ALL STANFORD MEMBERS OF THE
ORDER OF DE MOLAY are cordial

ORDER OF DE MOLAY are cordial
ly invited to attend a meeting which
will be held at the Masonic Temple,
Palo Alto, Monday, Oct. 8. Time
7:45 p.m.
No matter what the mere men may
think about the new fight, this day
light saving plan is proving popular
with the ladies of the University. For
the first time in history, they got a
close-up view of the brutal males
spreading each other over the scenery
and they did have the best time.
* * *
Feminine fight fans, incidentally,
proved that they have a good sense of
fair play. In the course of the battle,
one; gent hauled off and popped an
other gent one of those crushing blows.
Came a gentle voice, "Oh, don't whang
him!" So the whanger was removed
from the struggle by official order.
* * *
Tom Irwin, '23, as well as Carl
Shoup, '24, and "Nip" McHouse,'24,
likewise, were disqualified early in the
row. It later developed, however, that
the gentlemen did not fall in, nor were
they shoved. They merely stood too
close; but the effect was almost as
good.
* * *
As the result of one unfortunate oc
currence, it was decided by the fresh
man class that suspenders will be
worn by the well-dressed man next sea
son. The passing of the gallus was
sincerely mourned by one poor mud
soaked frosli yesterday

Greased backs and no shirts may
have advantages, but they don't go
too well when the backs come in con
tact with the burdocks which carpet
the lake bottom. The '25 horde last
year fought on lawns; their imitators
neglected to supply that little detail.
* * *
"Just like a jolly-up," cried one spec-|
tator as the rush began yesterday;,
and the comparison is a happy one, J
although the jolly-up is usually quite
a bit rougher. The jolly-up touch was
even more noticeable when the on-j
lookers surged forward in the attempt
to get a better view until they were
fairly trampling the toes of the
dancers —beg pardon; we mean bat
tlers.

And those who came to cough re
mained to sneeze. Seems as if some
thing might be done to lay the dust in
that lake bed.
* * *
While the medals are being dished
out, how about the genial police, who
risked life, limb, and the pursuit of
happiness in chasing out those double
dealing reptiles, who, having been
ducked, tried to go back at it again.
* * *
Now that rules are the rule, why
not a rule regulating the spectators?
Ringside seats were at a premium, and
the well-known celluloid rat had an
immortal cinch compared to the war
correspondent trying to view the thing
as a whole.
