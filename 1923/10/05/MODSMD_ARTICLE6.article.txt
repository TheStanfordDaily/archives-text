# 1926 GAINS WET VICTORY IN MUD BAM AT LAKE
## Sophomores Win Decision by Last Minute Rally; Wiener Roast Caps Class Scrap 
### 
While the dust of battle rose and
mingled with the recurring eruptions
of mud from the baths, freshmen and
, sophomores fought a slow fifteen min
utes yesterday afternoon in the first
I mud fight Stanford has ever known,
in the course of which the "last year's"
I gained a not very decisive victory,
i Freshmen poured in a steady stream
into the sophomore pit, filled to the
brim with wet dust; but on the other
hand, almost as steady a stream of
| sophomores got what few clothes they
| wore all wet by immersion in the
freshman tank. A sophomore rally,
with a detachment of yearlings carry-
I ing the fight well into frosh territory
in the last few minutes of the brawl,
gave the upperclass decision to the
j '26 class.
The broad light of day affected the
freshman morale favorably. The '27
men were quiet before the fight, but
they displayed great gobs of fighting
spirit once the war began. As usual,
superior organization, a larger degree
of self-confidence, and familiarity with
their own classmen, had much to do
with winning the fight for the sopho
mores.
The two classes lined up before their
respective mudholes shortly before 3
o'clock, the sophomores giving vent to
fearful cries, the freshmen quieter,
somewhat subdued, but still deter
mined. At the signal both classes
rushed clear through the opposing
ranks, by mutual consent switching
slush excavations. Within thirty sec
onds after the gun, the first victim
had been sunk and had risen dripping
from the mud baths, to be herded out
of the fight by the watchful upper-
classmen.
The battle soon developed into a
series of running fights down the nar-1
row lane formed by the spectators, j
with the bulk of the two classes sur
rounding the mud pits. There were'
many exciting private wars during the
first ten minutes of the fight. The
freshmen took some time to learn to
"gang up" in small groups after the |
manner of the sophomores, but they
nevertheless performed very efficient
ly in putting the boys under the sur
face. The best of the fight took place j
in the last few minutes, with the
attack of the sophomore horde on the
freshmen about the mud pit.
A new fight threatened immediately |
after the close of the mud-dipping con- j
test, when the sophomore serpentine
came in contact with a freshman line j
just forming. Upperclassmen broke up j
the play before it was well started,
however.
"While large quantities of epidermis
were removed by contact with gravel
and fingernails, no serious casualties
resulted so far as is known. One or
two vanquished heroes were carried
gasping from the pits, but they is-,
covered quickly and proceeded under j
their own power.
Freshly bathed freshmen and sopho
mores retreated last evening to
Frenchman's Cut where apparatus had
been installed for a mammoth barbe
cue.
Each class cheered the other after
the meal, and both sides, under the
benevolent influence of the sponsors,
got together in a thrilling songfest.'
which only ended when time for cur
few approached.
Tom Irwin, '22, who wrote the rules
for the new fight, was hoist, as it were
by his own petard.'The victim of "de
fective vision," Irwin was one of those
who descended into the murky depths.
The identity of those supplying the j
impetus to the fight sponsor has not
been disclosed.
