# Bloody Deeds Are To Come; But Why Is Not Disclosed

### 
Ominous tliunderings are heard hither
and yon about the campus, with the fin
ger of dread pointing at next Tuesday
night. A desperate crew of hard}' fiends
go about hissing, prophesying the Abys
mal brute in search of a brimming stein
of blood; half-clad demons prancing in
the dark o' the moon, and dead men
everywhere. Freshmen will seek cover,
sophomores will beat them to it. juniors
will draw them out of it. and seniors will
creep through the shadows, shivering
bravely. Howling, clattering, moaning,
shrieking, hanging, clashing— and then an
awful silence. Next Tuesday night.
