(t Towering Alasses" WALTERM. MASON, Architect
O Drawn by Hugh Ferriss
J_JERE the new architecture expresses itself in great vig
orous masses which climb upward into the sky with a
pyramidal profile—gigantic, i rregular, arresting. An earlier,
conventional building on the near corner is overshadowed,
engulfed in towering masses of the newer building which
are prophetic of an architecture of the future which is
vividly stimulating to the imagination.
Certainly modern invention —modern engineering skill
and organization, will prove more than equal to the de
mands of the architecture of the future. f
