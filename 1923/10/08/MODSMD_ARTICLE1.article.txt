# DAVIS AGGIE ELEVEN DEFEATS FRESHMAN
## Babes Humble San Jose High, Play Scoreless Tie With Berkeley High in Morning Game 
### Walter Campbell, '26 
Playing loosely and failing to exhibit the punch shown against San Diego
High School last week, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman gridiron aspirants
dropped a 7-6 game to the Davis Farm aggregation Saturday as a preliminary
to the varsity and Nevada contest. The Aggies scored in the first quarter,
while the babes' tally did not come until the end of the third.
The Davis Aggies sent a fast, heavy team against the freshmen, a team
that had profited by its 41-0 defeat at the hands of the Nevada varsity. The
Davis team knew football, and played it, in spite of the babes' best efforts to
the contrary.
The freshmen have no alibis for their defeat, nor do they offer any. With
the punch shown against San Diego they could have easily won Saturday.

But reserves were lacking. Three<
games in one day is enough to sap
the reserve strength of any one team.
Davis scored its touchdown on a
break of the game. The freshmen com
mitted the error of fumbling on their
own fifteen-yard line, and it was only
a matter of time until Davis shoved
the ball over for a touchdown. Porter,
right half on the Aggie team, put the
ball over, and then proceeded to add
the extra point from placement that
spelled defeat for the Cardinals.
Dinks Buck It Over
The Stanford touchdown came in
the third quarter, when the freshmen
gradually pushed the ball down the
field by employing straight football
tactics. Morrison, plunging through
right guard, accounted for the touch
down. Failure to convert the extra
point left the score at 6-7, where it
remained for the rest of the game.
Ryan at left half played stellar foot
ball in the early stages of the game,
but threw his hip out of joint and had
to be carried from the game.
Garthwaite proved a sensation when
he relieved Trobetta at right half in
the first half of the game. This little
star played the entire game against
Berkeley High in the morning, and
then proceeded to make himself highly
useful against Davis in the afternoon.
A scant hour's rest was all that was
afforded him.
Berkeley Shows Fight
The freshmen ran up against a snag
when they tackled Berkeley High
School in one of the morning games.
The game was a scoreless tie, 0-0, but
that doesn't half describe it. Both
teams came within whispering dis
tance of the other's goal line, but
were unable to put the ball over.
Clymer, of Berkeley, proved himself
an able passer, hurling the ball past
the babes for many sizeable gains.
San Jose High School proved easy
pickings in the second game of the
morning. The weight of the high
school lads proved a handicap rather
than a help. The final score read 19-0.
Rehm accounted for two scores, while
Pegram added a third.
Looking at the three games as a
whole, it must be said that the fresh
men spent rather a busy day of it.
The outlook, contrary to the scores,
seems very promising. Each of the
three freshman teams looked strong,
so that when all three are concen
trated on one game, an exceptionally
good team should be the result.

the contrary.
The freshmen have no alibis for their defeat, nor do they offer any. With
the punch shown against San Diego they could have easily won Saturday.

But reserves were lacking. Three<
games in one day is enough to sap
the reserve strength of any one team.
Davis scored its touchdown on a
break of the game. The freshmen com
mitted the error of fumbling on their
own fifteen-yard line, and it was only
a matter of time until Davis shoved
the ball over for a touchdown. Porter,
right half on the Aggie team, put the
ball over, and then proceeded to add
the extra point from placement that
spelled defeat for the Cardinals.
Dinks Buck It Over
The Stanford touchdown came in
the third quarter, when the freshmen
gradually pushed the ball down the
field by employing straight football
tactics. Morrison, plunging through
right guard, accounted for the touch
down. Failure to convert the extra
point left the score at 6-7, where it
remained for the rest of the game.
Ryan at left half played stellar foot
ball in the early stages of the game,
but threw his hip out of joint and had
to be carried from the game.
Garthwaite proved a sensation when
he relieved Trobetta at right half in
the first half of the game. This little
star played the entire game against
Berkeley High in the morning, and
then proceeded to make himself highly
useful against Davis in the afternoon.
A scant hour's rest was all that was
afforded him.
Berkeley Shows Fight
The freshmen ran up against a snag
when they tackled Berkeley High
School in one of the morning games.
The game was a scoreless tie, 0-0, but
that doesn't half describe it. Both
teams came within whispering dis
tance of the other's goal line, but
were unable to put the ball over.
Clymer, of Berkeley, proved himself
an able passer, hurling the ball past
the babes for many sizeable gains.
San Jose High School proved easy
pickings in the second game of the
morning. The weight of the high
school lads proved a handicap rather
than a help. The final score read 19-0.
Rehm accounted for two scores, while
Pegram added a third.
Looking at the three games as a
whole, it must be said that the fresh
men spent rather a busy day of it.
The outlook, contrary to the scores,
seems very promising. Each of the
three freshman teams looked strong,
so that when all three are concen
trated on one game, an exceptionally
good team should be the result.
Playing loosely and failing to exhibit the punch shown against San Diego
High School last week, Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman gridiron aspirants
dropped a 7-6 game to the Davis Farm aggregation Saturday as a preliminary
to the varsity and Nevada contest. The Aggies scored in the first quarter,
while the babes' tally did not come until the end of the third.
The Davis Aggies sent a fast, heavy team against the freshmen, a team
that had profited by its 41-0 defeat at the hands of the Nevada varsity. The
Davis team knew football, and played it, in spite of the babes' best efforts to
the contrary.
