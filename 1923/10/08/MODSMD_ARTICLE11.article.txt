# Varsity Soccer Men Lose To Vikings by 2-1 Score
## 
### 
The Stanford socccr varsity suffered
upset Saturday when the strong Viking
team came from behind in the last five
minutes and won by a 2 to 1 score. The
contest was the first scheduled game for
this season in the University and Club
soccer league. In the second team game
following the varsity affair, the Vikings
and second varsity battled to a 0-0 tic.
Things started well for the varsity
when Swayne made a corner kick and
Ta'am headed the ball through the Viking
goal after about three mintes of play.
This seemed to be the climax for the
Stanford team, as it gradually slackened
its pace, until the Vikings had the upper
hand.
During the rest of the half the ball
went back and forth without either side
doing much brilliant work. In the second
half things were even until the last five
minutes when the Vikings dribbled the
ball down the field and shot through the
center of the Stanford goal. This brought
the score to 1 all, and the Vikings seemed
to take a second wind. Stimulated by
tieing the score, they started with a rush
on the next kick-off, and before the
Stanford men knew what it was all about,

they had scored the extra goal which won
the game for them.
There is no alibi for the Stanford team.
Perhaps a team that lost but one out of I
fourteen games last season should liavej
an alibi, but Saturday it was just a case
of a team that was out of practice, and i
off its regular game, meeting a strong |
opponent. In fact, the Vikings are rated!
as one of the best teams in the league. I
The Vikings had a strong offense with j
a good supporting backfield. The veterans j
of last year on the Stanford tern showed
up well, but the holes mde by graduation
and loss of players was too much for the
new men to fill. The Stanford wings ap
peared weak, while the goal keeper did
not handle his job in the manner in
which it was handled by A1 Masters last
year. However, the team should round
into shape with a little more practice.
The second team game was cut short,
the halves being but twenty-minutes long.
Neither team did much, the ball being
held by one side as much as the other.
The Stanford men had not been together
before, which gave the Vikings some ad
vantage. The second varsity, however,
was on the offensive most of the time.
