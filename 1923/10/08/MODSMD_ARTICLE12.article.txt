# VARSITY DOWNS NEVADA 27 TO 0 IN TEST GAME
## Captain Campbell, Nevers, Murray, Shatter Wolf Pack; Johnson Scores on Blocked Kicks 
### 
A Wolf Pack from the University of Nevada applied the acid test to the
1923 Stanford varsity in the Stadium last Saturday afternoon. The acid
rolled off, and the varsity assayed 14 karat with a 27 to 0 shut-out of the
highly-advertised Reno eleven. The concensus of opinion following the vic
tory seems to be that the Stanford varsity, after a prolonged search, has at
last a pretty hot clue toward finding itself.
Whether the Silver Wolves lived up to their reputation or not is im
material. Stanford played a superior brand of football, and Nevada furnished
the kind of opposition that made the game highly worth while. The Cards
played a strong, balanced game, with defensive and all the various branches,
of offensive in mid-season development. The tackling was a trifle shady at
times, but in common with interference, passing, plunging, and every other
department of the game, showed a decided advance over 1922 form.
Gutteron, successor to Bradshaw, was smothered by the Card defensive,
and most of the gaining was done by Scranton and Clark on the few occasions
when Nevada had possession of the leather. Stanford made yardage twenty-one

I times against a bare half-dozen for Ne
vada, and completed three passes out
of ten attempts for a net gain of 75
yards. The Pack worked one out ot
nine for 18 yards, the rest being broken
up or intercepted.
Stanford's opening score came late
in the first quarter. Nevada kicked off
to Campbell, who returned 20 yards to
the 40 yard line. The Cardinal backa
went into action and made first down
twice, finally losing the ball on an
incompleted pass. After an exchange
of punts, Campbell intercepted a toss
from Scranton, and the Redshirts
started a march down the field which
ended when Nevers fumbled on the
2 yard line. Nevada lined up to kick
from behind her own goal, "Chuck"
Johnston broke through, blocked the
punt, and fell on the ball. Campbell
converted, and the score was 7 to IX
Nevada kicked off again, Nevers
broke through tackle for 7 yards from
punt formation, and Murray swung
around left end for thirty yards, Gut
teron bringing him down on Nevada's
30 yard line as the quarter ended.
Coach Courtwright made several sub
: stitutions in an effort to stop the
Cardinal advance, but Kerr's men im
partially walked on them with tbe
same enthusiasm.
During the second quarter the ball
