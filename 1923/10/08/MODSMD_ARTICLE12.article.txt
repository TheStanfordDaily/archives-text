# VARSITY DOWNS NEVADA 27 TO 0 IN TEST GAME
## Captain Campbell, Nevers, Murray, Shatter Wolf Pack; Johnson Scores on Blocked Kicks 
### 
A Wolf Pack from the University of Nevada applied the acid test to the
1923 Stanford varsity in the Stadium last Saturday afternoon. The acid
rolled off, and the varsity assayed 14 karat with a 27 to 0 shut-out of the
highly-advertised Reno eleven. The concensus of opinion following the vic
tory seems to be that the Stanford varsity, after a prolonged search, has at
last a pretty hot clue toward finding itself.
Whether the Silver Wolves lived up to their reputation or not is im
material. Stanford played a superior brand of football, and Nevada furnished
the kind of opposition that made the game highly worth while. The Cards
played a strong, balanced game, with defensive and all the various branches,
of offensive in mid-season development. The tackling was a trifle shady at
times, but in common with interference, passing, plunging, and every other
department of the game, showed a decided advance over 1922 form.
Gutteron, successor to Bradshaw, was smothered by the Card defensive,
and most of the gaining was done by Scranton and Clark on the few occasions
when Nevada had possession of the leather. Stanford made yardage twenty-one

I times against a bare half-dozen for Ne
vada, and completed three passes out
of ten attempts for a net gain of 75
yards. The Pack worked one out ot
nine for 18 yards, the rest being broken
up or intercepted.
Stanford's opening score came late
in the first quarter. Nevada kicked off
to Campbell, who returned 20 yards to
the 40 yard line. The Cardinal backa
went into action and made first down
twice, finally losing the ball on an
incompleted pass. After an exchange
of punts, Campbell intercepted a toss
from Scranton, and the Redshirts
started a march down the field which
ended when Nevers fumbled on the
2 yard line. Nevada lined up to kick
from behind her own goal, "Chuck"
Johnston broke through, blocked the
punt, and fell on the ball. Campbell
converted, and the score was 7 to IX
Nevada kicked off again, Nevers
broke through tackle for 7 yards from
punt formation, and Murray swung
around left end for thirty yards, Gut
teron bringing him down on Nevada's
30 yard line as the quarter ended.
Coach Courtwright made several sub
: stitutions in an effort to stop the
Cardinal advance, but Kerr's men im
partially walked on them with tbe
same enthusiasm.
During the second quarter the ball
traveled up and down the field, mostly
in Nevada territory, with Stanford
gaining through the line, around the
wings, or in the air. A pass, Cleave
land to Campbell, netted thirty yards
with the aid of "Scotohy's" agility in
evading Nevada tacklers, and put the
ball within striking distance of the
Wolves' goal line. Murray gained seven
yards in two plays, and fumbled the
pass from center with a single yard
to go. He recovered, with a loss of
two more. Nevers, with three yards to
gain, failed by inches, and Nevada
took the ball on downs.
Then came the only break in Stan
ford's favor. Once more the Silver
Wolves had to kick from within their
lair, and this kick was not blocked.
Both teams were off-side, and the ball
was brought back. On the second
kick, Nevers, who had moved up into
the line, smeared the play, and for
the second time Johnston recovered
the oval for a touchdown. In turn,
Nevada blocked Woodward's try-for
point, leaving the score at 13 to 0.
At this point Kerr sent in a flock
of substitutes, and the close of the
half, shortly afterward, found a very
few of the original line-up on the field.
Stanford again carried the battle to
the Nevadans' 10 yard line, but the
half ended as Scranton intercepted a
pass and Harrison kicked out of dan
ger.
Soon the kick-off in the second
half. Captain Campbell's 30 yard re
turn of Harrison's punt brought the
ball to mid-field. Nevers and Murray
then started a procession down the
chalk lines, mixing straight plunging
with an occasional criss-cross, until on
the ninth play Murray went four yards
across the goal. Campbell, as usual,
converted. Twenty to nothing, and the
Nevada cheering section, which had
been making horrible threats, ex
changed the megaphone for a piccolo.
This time Nevers kicked off, and
Clark brought the ball back 20 yards
to the Nevada 30 yard line. After one
of Harrison's punts evaded Campbell
on a bad bounce and rolled to Stan
ford's 12 yard marker, the Silver
Wolves showed a brief flash of of
fensive strength. Murray made 15
yards after picking up his own fumble,
and Nevers kicked to Nevada's 40
yard stripe. The Wolf Pack then
smashed through for a quartet of first
downs in less than ten minutes, but
lost the ball the same number of
times, allowing the Cards to keep the
ball a long way from danger. During
this spasm Scranton broke through
