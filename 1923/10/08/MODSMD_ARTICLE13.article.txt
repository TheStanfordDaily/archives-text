# HALLS TO COMBINE TOMORROW EVENING FOR PAJAMA JAUNT
## Athletic Enthusiasts Have a Calliope on Hand to Increase Racket 
### 
One of the few remaining Grand Old
Traditions of the Farms, the Pajamarino,
will be touched off by Bob Titus, '24, to
morrow evening during early twilight.
Including Encina, Sequoia, Toyon, and
the Unions instead of only Encina as
formerly, it will be louder and more vio
lent than ever. The organizers are cut
ting classes to invent new and horrible
sounds, and it is highly probabel that a
calliope will be procured to fill in the
breathing-spaces.
According to custom, the Pajamarino
is made up of Stanford athletic enthus
iasts clad in the garb made famous by
many a Winter Garden chorus, and lend
ing vocal and instrumental support to the
Cardinal varsity in every conceiveable
manner. The innovation of including all
the dormitories will bring the total en
listment close to 1000 men, which would
be a plenty for the Delta Upsilon house
to present with apples, as has been their
wont It is expected that a number of the
living groups will band together to con
tinue this happy program.
The Pajamarino was inaugurated long
ago, when word came to Encina at a late
hour that a Cardinal team was returning
to the campus, victorious. Forthwith En
cina piled out as was, and hurtled up to
the station in Menlo to hail the conquer
ing heroes, surrounded only by their late
evening attire. It seemed like a good idea,
and has not yet been abolished.
Leaving Encina at 7:30, the parade
will straggle to Roble via the Union,
equipped with a drum corps, part of the
Stanford band, the calliope, and divers
make-shift appliances for issuing clamor.
After a brief recital it will proceed across
through the Zcta Psi lawn to the Alpha
Delta Phi house, stopping here and there
to express burning hope for the 1923 sea
son. Captain "Scotch" Campbell will re
luctantly appear like Juliet, 011 the bal
cony, and make the customary remarks
about "fight," "support," and "out to
win," which will be uproariously received.
The line of march, attended with more
sore throats and less noise, will then lie
down Salvatierra to the haills again,
where the pajamas will be put away in
moth-balls until next fall.

where the pajamas will be put away in
moth-balls until next fall.
One of the few remaining Grand Old
Traditions of the Farms, the Pajamarino,
will be touched off by Bob Titus, '24, to
morrow evening during early twilight.
Including Encina, Sequoia, Toyon, and
the Unions instead of only Encina as
formerly, it will be louder and more vio
lent than ever. The organizers are cut
ting classes to invent new and horrible
sounds, and it is highly probabel that a
calliope will be procured to fill in the
breathing-spaces.
According to custom, the Pajamarino
is made up of Stanford athletic enthus
iasts clad in the garb made famous by
many a Winter Garden chorus, and lend
ing vocal and instrumental support to the
Cardinal varsity in every conceiveable
manner. The innovation of including all
the dormitories will bring the total en
listment close to 1000 men, which would
be a plenty for the Delta Upsilon house
to present with apples, as has been their
wont It is expected that a number of the
living groups will band together to con
tinue this happy program.
The Pajamarino was inaugurated long
ago, when word came to Encina at a late
hour that a Cardinal team was returning
to the campus, victorious. Forthwith En
cina piled out as was, and hurtled up to
the station in Menlo to hail the conquer
ing heroes, surrounded only by their late
evening attire. It seemed like a good idea,
and has not yet been abolished.
Leaving Encina at 7:30, the parade
will straggle to Roble via the Union,
equipped with a drum corps, part of the
Stanford band, the calliope, and divers
make-shift appliances for issuing clamor.
After a brief recital it will proceed across
through the Zcta Psi lawn to the Alpha
Delta Phi house, stopping here and there
to express burning hope for the 1923 sea
son. Captain "Scotch" Campbell will re
luctantly appear like Juliet, 011 the bal
cony, and make the customary remarks
about "fight," "support," and "out to
win," which will be uproariously received.
The line of march, attended with more
sore throats and less noise, will then lie
down Salvatierra to the haills again,
where the pajamas will be put away in
moth-balls until next fall.
