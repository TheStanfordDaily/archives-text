# UNIVERSITY ORGANIST GIVES FIRST RECITAL
## 
### 
The first musical vesper service of the |
year was held Sunday at the Memorial
Church. The congregation was asked to j
participate in the service as an act of j
I worship, and a hymn and prayer were
| added to the usual type of program given
last year by Warren D. Allen, University
| organist.
The Solemn Prelude, "Gloria Domini,"
by T. Tertius Noble, who is now organist;
' and choirmaster at St. Thomas Church in
| New York City, is a work making him
justly regarded as one of the greatest liv
ing composers of ecclesiastical music.
The Chorale-Prelude, "Rejoice Ye," was
evidence of the genius of the great Bach.
Two Preludes by Chopin, and "Carillon"
by Louis Vierne completed the program.
"Carillon" is based on a bell-theme of
seventeen notes heard by the composer at
the Chapel on Longpont-sur-Aisne, and is
one of a set of 24 short "Pieces in Free
Style," the work of a blind composer.

A seven acre site near Jerusalem, on
which a $450,000 building will be built,
has been bought as a gift to the Y. M.
C. A. This building will be the headquar
ters of the association's activities in the
Near East.
