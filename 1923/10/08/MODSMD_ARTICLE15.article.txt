# BAND SELECTS NEW STYLE OF UNIFORM IN RED AND WHITE
## 
### 
The Stanford band has chosen a new
1 uniform consisting of red coats and white
flannel trousers. The effect of the com
bination should be doggy to the last de
gree.
The coat, cardinal in color, has a lapel
collar and a waist line similar to the
Canadian Mounted Police coat, with a
j white webbing belt. The cap is red and
| shaped like the new Pershing caps. White
flannel trousers together with white ox
fords complete the uniform. They should
be ready for the U. S. C. game on Oc
tober 27. Uniforms were ordered through
Roos Brothers, Palo Alto, from a big
I eastern uniform company.
I Money for the uniforms was partially
raised from the band registration dance
proceeds.
The band will play for the first time
this year at the Santa Clara game next
Saturday. A good turnout was made at
the regular practice held last Thursday.
Meetings arc held on Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 4:15 in the Engineering
building. The parts especially needed are
flutes, picola, cornets, horns, clarinets, and
saxaphones. In short, students with plenty
of wind and something to blow it through
are invited to come out to the next meet
ing which will be held Thursday after
noon at 3 p. m. in the Women's club
house. The regular practice schedule will
begin next week probably.
