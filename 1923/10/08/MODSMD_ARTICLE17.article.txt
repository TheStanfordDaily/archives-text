# SKYROCKET! STANFORD VARSITY
## 
### 
Last Saturday the Stanford varsity went on
the field unknown. Neither the crowd, the
coaches, nor the men themselves knew what was
in them. Nobody was willing to risk an estimate,
for nobody had any knowledge other than that
of a practice scrimmage a week ago against a
team of hospital students.
After four quarters on the turf, in which the
Cardinal marched across the enemy goal line
four times, outkicked, outran, and outclassed the
men from Reno, the strength of the 1923 varsity
became a known quantity, and a threat to every
eleven on the Coast.
As Campbell, Murray, and Dennis smashed
into the line of blue, big Ernie Nevers crashed
down the field, and the rest of the red warriors
hit the panting linesmen with machine-like preci
sion, a change came over the bleachers not seen
in a Stanford rooting section for three years.
The old feeling of hope against hope, loyalty to
a losing cause, and fear that the team would not
have the punch to carry across the last line, was
washed away clean; a wave of hope swept over
the stands, succeeded by a calm feeling of confi
dence, and faith that the Stanford team could
play the game straight through, and, being a
Stanford team, would win.
This year we will hear no talks of odds, know
no halting moments of doubt when in everyone's
mind is the question: "Can the team make the
last yard?" or worse: "How low can they hold
the score?"
In the season of 1923 the Stanford rooter will
go into the stands with this thought: this is a
STANFORD team; it knows football; it has
fight; it will win.
