# Pasadena vs. Coast Conference
## 
### 
The Pasadena Tournament of Roses committee
seems to be willing to ignore the Coast conference
ruling on selection of an opponent form the East
in an East-West game. It therefore seems fitting
that the conference ignore the Tournament of
Roses when the proper time comes to schedule
such a post-season game. The Daily Palo Alto
believes that the winner of the Coast conference
should choose its own opponent.
Stanford will be quite ready to consider repre
sentative Eastern teams at the close of the regular
season. ,
