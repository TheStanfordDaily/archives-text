# PROMISING BOXERS REGISTER TO PUSH GLOVES FOR CARDS
## 
### 
With the starting of boxing- classes a
number of new men arc on deck to push
the gloves in the intcrclass bouts, which
will probably be held this quarter. Davis
Farm lias asked for a meet this quarter
but Coach Harry Maloney feels that the
Stanford men will not have time to get in
shape this quarter, and so has signed the j
.Aggies up for next quarter.
Myron Schall, from Denver, Colo., has !
entered collcge and will probably contend j
for middleweight honors. Schall has quite j
a reputation in amateur boxing circles in
the Colorado metropolis. Battling Ike
Harwood, a lightweight from Idaho, was
the sensation of the boxing class during
the summer session, and is expected to
put up a fight for honors in his weight.
Giles Hall, who fought several light
weight battles last year after Jimmic Ross
left, is working and will not be back un
til winter. Giles is reported to have
gained weight and so will not be able to
weigh in at 139 this year. Gay, who
showed up well in practicc last spring,
and Harwood, stand out as the best bets
for this position.
Brad Simmons, varsity bantamweight
in 1921, will don the gloves this year, and
fight for the Cardinal in the 115 pound,
class. His addition will strengthen the
team considerably, as Maloney did not
have a high class bantam last year.
Armbruster, intercollegiate feather
weight champion, is back looking better
than ever. Jake Irwin, middleweight;
Van Hook, light heavyweight; and Rob
inson, heavyweight, are other veterans 1
who will box this year.
Competition promises to be stiff for the j
welterweight position. Johnny Lane, the j
star 145 pounder of last year, has grad- [
uated, but fortunately there are a number,
of promising youngsters after his job.;
Penepacker and Adams are probably the
the most experienced of these. Both box
ers appeared in exhibitions last year and j
were awarded circle S's for their work, i
Hall will be in the welterweight class i
this year and in addition, Stanford, a wel
ter who was injured last year, will be
back.

Van Hook, light heavyweight; and Rob
inson, heavyweight, are other veterans 1
who will box this year.
Competition promises to be stiff for the j
welterweight position. Johnny Lane, the j
star 145 pounder of last year, has grad- [
uated, but fortunately there are a number,
of promising youngsters after his job.;
Penepacker and Adams are probably the
the most experienced of these. Both box
ers appeared in exhibitions last year and j
were awarded circle S's for their work, i
Hall will be in the welterweight class i
this year and in addition, Stanford, a wel
ter who was injured last year, will be
back.
