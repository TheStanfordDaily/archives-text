# PROMISING BOXERS REGISTER TO PUSH GLOVES FOR CARDS
## 
### 
With the starting of boxing- classes a
number of new men arc on deck to push
the gloves in the intcrclass bouts, which
will probably be held this quarter. Davis
Farm lias asked for a meet this quarter
but Coach Harry Maloney feels that the
Stanford men will not have time to get in
shape this quarter, and so has signed the j
.Aggies up for next quarter.
Myron Schall, from Denver, Colo., has !
entered collcge and will probably contend j
for middleweight honors. Schall has quite j
a reputation in amateur boxing circles in
the Colorado metropolis. Battling Ike
Harwood, a lightweight from Idaho, was
the sensation of the boxing class during
the summer session, and is expected to
put up a fight for honors in his weight.
Giles Hall, who fought several light
weight battles last year after Jimmic Ross
left, is working and will not be back un
til winter. Giles is reported to have
gained weight and so will not be able to
weigh in at 139 this year. Gay, who
showed up well in practicc last spring,
and Harwood, stand out as the best bets
for this position.
Brad Simmons, varsity bantamweight
in 1921, will don the gloves this year, and
