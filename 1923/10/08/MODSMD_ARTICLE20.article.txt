METHOD OF PROCEDURE ON BEING UNEXPECTED
LY CALLED UPON TO WRITE CABBAGES
When confronted by a situation like this the best thing
to do is to get the mumps. If that is impracticable,
probably the next best thing is a little plunge in the
swimming tank, with a couple of crank-shafts tied around
your neck. The last thing in the world to do is to
venture within distance of a typewriter. There is some
thing like an affinity between a typewriter and a con
science, so that the first thing you know you'll be
sitting at a table, muttering unintelligibly to yourself,
and nervously twitching at the keys.
This thing happened to me once before. I remember
the occasion perfectly. It was a bright, sunshiny day
in Arizona. But as I happened to be in Palo Alto I had
my hip boots on. and it was a pretty good thing, too.
I was sauntering down the street, looking at the gay

throngs, when I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder. As
soon as I could get it back in its socket I shrugged it
nonchalantly and turned around. Who do you think it
was? Well, you guessed it. It was the Cabbage Head,
and he wanted me to write cabbages for him. I hastily
looked at my watch and made a notation of the time on
a little notebook. It was just exactly a quarter after
three. Even in the excitement of the moment I remem
ber a thrill going down my spine at the thought of the
coincidence —here it was a quarter after three and I was
being asked to write cabbages.
Well, as soon as the Cabbage Head was able to be up
and around again I sent him a few contributions. The
thing just grew on me. I got so that I just had to write
cabbages ever so often or I got sick. Several constant
readers of this sheet offered to endow a perpetual hos
pital bed for me. But I persisted with my cabbages, and
as a result one of the donors occupies that hospital bed
himself.
The best way to go at a thing like this is to run
yourself down a business manager or two and get a
good hot line of hooey about Salesmanship and Pep and
Personality and Push and Blaah and then run a type
writer just like you were going to sell it a thousand
shares of Mayfield Hydroelectric. Give the typewriter
carriage a good vicious run clear over to the left hand
side, just to show who is boss, and then start in. Do as
the violinists do when about to render Tlie-Latest-Jazz-
Number-From-That-Popular-Musical-Comedy — The-Mer
chant-of-Venice; run the scale a couple of times, like
this: Etaoin Shrdlu Etaoin Shrdlu. This is to show
the linotyper that you haven't become stuck-up just be
cause you write Cabbages. Otherwise he is liable to
take a little of the conceit out of you by writing in
Etaoin Shrdlu himself, to give the general public the
idea that you, too, have to try the scale before you play
on the typewriter, just like the rest of the common herd
does. That is what Etaoin means —Evening Typing As
sociation of Ignorant Novices. The meaning of Shrdlu
is something that the linotypers keep strictly to them
selves, and the quickest way to get a blush and an earful
of hot lead out of a linotyper is to ask him what Shrdlu
means.
Well, that is sort of wandering afield, but I guess you
have the idea. I'll bet there isn't a one who couldn't
sit down now, after finding out like this how it's done,
and write a perfectly fine mess of cabbages. Just to
prove to you, Mr. Addison Simms, that you, too, can
write Cabbages, the Cabbage Head is offering a Prize
for the best Cabbage turned in inside the next five
minutes. This Prize will be Five Dollars in trade at
Palo Alto's most exclusive Undertaking Parlors.
