# METHOD OF PROCEDURE WHEN UNEXPECTEDLY HANDED NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BY STREET CAR CONDUCTOR
## 
### 
Extend the right hand horizontally, palm up, with the
thumb well back. Let the left hand rest easily on the
dining room table which you are carrying on your left
shoulder. As soon as the transfer of currency is com
pleted. bow gracefully. If the donation is made in gold,
it is best to frown slightly, just to let the man know
that although you appreciate his action, there is a cer
tain amount of inconvenience involved from which a
more thoughtful man would have saved you by socking
you just behind the left ear with a two- or three-foot
section of gas pipe. Do not thank the gentleman. Un
seeming levity at such a casual encounter with a total
stranger does not attract the approval of the best people.
Of course, if he happens to be your father-in-law, it is
perfectly proper to say "Thank You," and when he isn t
looking, slip into his hip pocket the pet boa-constrictor
which you have been all the time concealing under
your left arm-pit. —N. E.

Coming back to the orange ade that is being sold in
the old union—did you know they serve milk too? Get
the chills, bring your own bromo seltzer and a bar of
Hershey's along, and you can have a choc malt. Any
way, the regular bar will be open in a couple of weeks.
Without saying just which couple of weeks that is,
though.

Student managers of publications will be required to
furnish $1,000 bond hereafter. Why let the idea stop
there? Suggestions in order:
Soft drink venders (including orange-ade) furnish
$3,000 bond to default possible doctor's bills.
Class treasurers should put up personal clothing as
security for "dues" needed for "bills" that must be "paid
at once."
Bond of 20c on all organizations who collect book
store coupons. This will allow for ample coverage in
case anyone absconds with the coupons.
$10,000,000 bond in life insurance form to be put up
by the gent who drives the car on initiation nights.

An increase of $7,000 is noted in the Bookstore's busi
ness. Guess the law school let in a couple of extra
students.
