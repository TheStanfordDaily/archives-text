"THE ETERNAL STRUGGLE;"
Stanford theater, Palo Alto. (To start
Tuesday.)
After seeing this struggle, we almost
came to the conclusion that it's useless.
No one is ever going to produce really
great pictures for a long time to come.
Or else our appreciative appetite has been
dulled with too many of them. We have
somehow lost the open-mouthed accept
ance of all the standard plots which
wearied Solomon even more than his
thousand wives.
"The Eternal Struggle" is average. The
plot is old; ever since Northern pictures
became the vogue (about the time Perry
discovered the Pole) we have goggled at
the hero, who is not even on good
speaking terms with the heroine, gradually
winning his way to her heart by chasing
her 1000 miles through the snow into the
far, far north, on a charge of murder.
He overtakes her somewhere east of
Mt. Baldy, L. A. county.
After tramping back to the settlement
(oh, by the way: the hero is a member
of the Northwest Mounted) with his love
in chains, the good news is told them that
she ain't the murderess, after all, but
someone else did it just for spite. "I
knew it all the time," she says, and falls
into the arms of the hero, thus giving
rise to the suspicion that she has been
fond of him all along.
But, aside from the plot, which is al
ways immaterial to the producer, the
struggle is good. Barbara LaMarr, as a
barkeeper's daughter, gives the usual un
reliastic interpretation of such a role, and
is the sweet, pure girl the audience is
looking for; Pat O'Malley has the requi
site brawn and Stetson hat for a northern
hero, and the photography is very good.
