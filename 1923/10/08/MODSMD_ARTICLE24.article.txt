# Sigma Delta Chi Meets For First Sunday Night Supper
## 
### 
Sigma Delta Chi held the first of its
regular weekly suppers last night at the
New Union. Members present discussed
plans for the present quarter, and con
sidered some of the problems facing cam
pus publications at present.
These weekly suppers will be held
every Sunday during the year, and will
be in the nature of informal meetings.
Ordinary business will not be considered,
but will be saved to be brought up at the
regular meetings, which will be called
once or twice a month.
