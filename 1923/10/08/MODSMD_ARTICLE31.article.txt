# Workmen Are Up On a Ladder So Grinds in Glass House Shudder
## 
### 
A rasping noise and then uncomfortable
shivers. A noise similar to a piece of
chalk not connecting properly with a
blackboard. People stop their work and
shudder. Their gaze is upward. Study
is resumed. Then a resounding crash and
a heavy thud. Again, the gaze is upward.
Toward Heaven? No. But—
Someone violated all codes and creeds
yesterday and worked on Sunday. Two
or three men were busily engaged on the
glass above the main reading room of the
library. Ladders and other contrivances
were hauled over the glass to the proper
positions so that the glass could have
its fall cleaning. Hence the dull heavy
thuds, crashes, and other kindred
noises.
Hemmed in* by glass—no wonder so
many students shuddered. A glass
house always was pretty dangerous.
