# SCHOLASTIC STANDARD IMPROVED SLIGHTLY, YEAR'S RECORDS SHOW
## Men Surpassed by Women; Athletics and Honor Groups Fall Off 
### 
Scholastic rating of the men and
women of the University as to living
groups, campus organizations, and ath
letic teams, has been calculated by
the Scholarship Office for the year
1922-23, and compared with the re
sults of the previous year. The Uni
versity average has been found by this
method to be slightly better than the
average for 1921-22.
An arithmetical comparison of all
grades is made by dividing the total
grade points by the total registered
units. By this system, a C average
would be figured as 1.0, a B average
as 2.0. and so on. The University grade
for the past year is 1.476, or between a
B and C average. The figure for the
previous year was 1.465.
Women Surpass Men
As usual, women show a higher
scholastic result than do the men. Both
men and women increased, the women
from 1.706 to 1.707, the men more per
ceptibly from 1.411 to 1.424.
This year the winter quarter seemed
most suited for study in all groups
with the exception of sorority women,
whose average grading decreased as
the year went on. Last year the men
improved steadily as the year pro
gressed. The grades of fraternity and
sorority students fell of perceptibly
this year as compared with last.
A smaller number of students in
curred action by the Scholastic Com
mittee this year, and there was less
probation and disqualification, accord
ing to Mrs. Huston, secretary of the
committee. This is partly due to the
good record of the summer quarter,
which was rated the highest of the
four quarters, the average being 1.541.
Basket Team High
Among the athletic teams, four var
sity and four freshman major sports
teams were averaged. The highest in
scholarship ia varsity basketball with
a rating of 1.481. This is a decrease
from the record of the high team of
last year. Freshman track improved
from 1.131 last year to 1.158. Fresh
man football is lowest, rating only .977,
below a C average.
The four highest teams included
three varsity and one freshman. Of
the four lowest, three freshman and
one varsity were included, the latter
being varsity football, which fell from
last year's average of 1.367 to 1.128.
The spring quarter rating for the var
sity squad was only 1.234.
Those groups not distracted by over
exertion in some outside activity im
proved in rating, while fraternities,
sororities, dramatic organizations, and
athletics lost ground. The Daily Palo
Alto and the Quad improved, although
Chaparral turned in a lower average.
Cap and Gown was the only honorary
quadrangle organization whose rating
did not fall off.
Phi Betes Make Good
The group having the highest aver
age on the campus is, as is to be ex
pected, Phi Beta Kappa, honorary
scholastic fraternity. The law fraterni
ty, Phi Alpha Delta, ranks second;
this group shows the greatest improve
ment of any in the University, rising
from 1.690 last year to 2.086 this year,
which is above a B average. Third
place is held by the English Club.
A change has been made this year
in the method of grading living groups.
Formerly only those residing with the
group were included in the group aver
age; now every member of the group
who is registered for courses is count
ed in the average. This makes little
difference, as living group member
ship is insignificantly higher than liv
ing group residence.
The highest campus fraternity on
the campus this year is Alpha Sigma
Phi, which rose from twentieth place
last year to first this year.
The paramount sorority is Delta
Delta Delta, which also holds fifth
place among University groups with
an average of 1.952.
The highest resident group of men
on the campus is the Chinese Club,
with eleven undergraduate members,
and having an average of 1.616, which
overtops that of both the halls and
the fraternities. Second in the non
fraternity living groups is the Union
with 1.536.
Women living in private houses on
the campus rank higher than other
towns, Palo Alto and Mayfield resi
dents, Roble Hall, and the sororities.

previous year was 1.465.
Women Surpass Men
As usual, women show a higher
scholastic result than do the men. Both
men and women increased, the women
from 1.706 to 1.707, the men more per
ceptibly from 1.411 to 1.424.
This year the winter quarter seemed
most suited for study in all groups
with the exception of sorority women,
whose average grading decreased as
the year went on. Last year the men
improved steadily as the year pro
gressed. The grades of fraternity and
sorority students fell of perceptibly
this year as compared with last.
A smaller number of students in
curred action by the Scholastic Com
mittee this year, and there was less
probation and disqualification, accord
ing to Mrs. Huston, secretary of the
committee. This is partly due to the
good record of the summer quarter,
which was rated the highest of the
four quarters, the average being 1.541.
Basket Team High
Among the athletic teams, four var
sity and four freshman major sports
teams were averaged. The highest in
scholarship ia varsity basketball with
a rating of 1.481. This is a decrease
from the record of the high team of
last year. Freshman track improved
from 1.131 last year to 1.158. Fresh
man football is lowest, rating only .977,
below a C average.
The four highest teams included
three varsity and one freshman. Of
the four lowest, three freshman and
one varsity were included, the latter
being varsity football, which fell from
last year's average of 1.367 to 1.128.
The spring quarter rating for the var
sity squad was only 1.234.
Those groups not distracted by over
exertion in some outside activity im
proved in rating, while fraternities,
sororities, dramatic organizations, and
athletics lost ground. The Daily Palo
Alto and the Quad improved, although
Chaparral turned in a lower average.
Cap and Gown was the only honorary
quadrangle organization whose rating
did not fall off.
Phi Betes Make Good
The group having the highest aver
age on the campus is, as is to be ex
pected, Phi Beta Kappa, honorary
scholastic fraternity. The law fraterni
ty, Phi Alpha Delta, ranks second;
this group shows the greatest improve
ment of any in the University, rising
from 1.690 last year to 2.086 this year,
which is above a B average. Third
place is held by the English Club.
A change has been made this year
in the method of grading living groups.
Formerly only those residing with the
group were included in the group aver
age; now every member of the group
who is registered for courses is count
ed in the average. This makes little
difference, as living group member
ship is insignificantly higher than liv
ing group residence.
The highest campus fraternity on
the campus this year is Alpha Sigma
Phi, which rose from twentieth place
last year to first this year.
The paramount sorority is Delta
Delta Delta, which also holds fifth
place among University groups with
an average of 1.952.
The highest resident group of men
on the campus is the Chinese Club,
with eleven undergraduate members,
and having an average of 1.616, which
overtops that of both the halls and
the fraternities. Second in the non
fraternity living groups is the Union
with 1.536.
Women living in private houses on
the campus rank higher than other
towns, Palo Alto and Mayfield resi
dents, Roble Hall, and the sororities.
Scholastic rating of the men and
women of the University as to living
groups, campus organizations, and ath
letic teams, has been calculated by
the Scholarship Office for the year
1922-23, and compared with the re
sults of the previous year. The Uni
versity average has been found by this
method to be slightly better than the
average for 1921-22.
An arithmetical comparison of all
grades is made by dividing the total
grade points by the total registered
units. By this system, a C average
would be figured as 1.0, a B average
as 2.0. and so on. The University grade
for the past year is 1.476, or between a

ing to Mrs. Huston, secretary of the
committee. This is partly due to the
good record of the summer quarter,
which was rated the highest of the
four quarters, the average being 1.541.
Basket Team High
Among the athletic teams, four var
sity and four freshman major sports
teams were averaged. The highest in
scholarship ia varsity basketball with
a rating of 1.481. This is a decrease
from the record of the high team of
last year. Freshman track improved
from 1.131 last year to 1.158. Fresh
man football is lowest, rating only .977,
below a C average.
The four highest teams included
three varsity and one freshman. Of
the four lowest, three freshman and
one varsity were included, the latter
being varsity football, which fell from
last year's average of 1.367 to 1.128.
The spring quarter rating for the var
sity squad was only 1.234.
Those groups not distracted by over
exertion in some outside activity im
proved in rating, while fraternities,
sororities, dramatic organizations, and
athletics lost ground. The Daily Palo
Alto and the Quad improved, although
Chaparral turned in a lower average.
Cap and Gown was the only honorary
quadrangle organization whose rating
did not fall off.
Phi Betes Make Good
The group having the highest aver
age on the campus is, as is to be ex
pected, Phi Beta Kappa, honorary
scholastic fraternity. The law fraterni
ty, Phi Alpha Delta, ranks second;
this group shows the greatest improve
ment of any in the University, rising
from 1.690 last year to 2.086 this year,
which is above a B average. Third
place is held by the English Club.
A change has been made this year
in the method of grading living groups.
Formerly only those residing with the
group were included in the group aver
age; now every member of the group
who is registered for courses is count
ed in the average. This makes little
difference, as living group member
ship is insignificantly higher than liv
ing group residence.
The highest campus fraternity on
the campus this year is Alpha Sigma
Phi, which rose from twentieth place
last year to first this year.
The paramount sorority is Delta
Delta Delta, which also holds fifth
place among University groups with
an average of 1.952.
The highest resident group of men
on the campus is the Chinese Club,
with eleven undergraduate members,
and having an average of 1.616, which
overtops that of both the halls and
the fraternities. Second in the non
fraternity living groups is the Union
with 1.536.
Women living in private houses on
the campus rank higher than other
towns, Palo Alto and Mayfield resi
dents, Roble Hall, and the sororities.
