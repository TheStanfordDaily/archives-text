# SCHOLASTIC STANDARD IMPROVED SLIGHTLY, YEAR'S RECORDS SHOW
## Men Surpassed by Women; Athletics and Honor Groups Fall Off 
### 
Scholastic rating of the men and
women of the University as to living
groups, campus organizations, and ath
letic teams, has been calculated by
the Scholarship Office for the year
1922-23, and compared with the re
sults of the previous year. The Uni
versity average has been found by this
method to be slightly better than the
average for 1921-22.
An arithmetical comparison of all
grades is made by dividing the total
grade points by the total registered
units. By this system, a C average
would be figured as 1.0, a B average
as 2.0. and so on. The University grade
for the past year is 1.476, or between a
B and C average. The figure for the
previous year was 1.465.
Women Surpass Men
As usual, women show a higher
scholastic result than do the men. Both
men and women increased, the women
from 1.706 to 1.707, the men more per
ceptibly from 1.411 to 1.424.
This year the winter quarter seemed
most suited for study in all groups
with the exception of sorority women,
whose average grading decreased as
the year went on. Last year the men
improved steadily as the year pro
gressed. The grades of fraternity and
sorority students fell of perceptibly
this year as compared with last.
A smaller number of students in
curred action by the Scholastic Com
mittee this year, and there was less
probation and disqualification, accord
ing to Mrs. Huston, secretary of the
committee. This is partly due to the
good record of the summer quarter,
which was rated the highest of the
four quarters, the average being 1.541.
