# Enrollment at Stanford Passes Previous Totals
## 
### 
Enrollment at Stanford has definitely
passed all previous totals in history with
the announcement today that the number
of students who have completed registra
tion is now 2731. The highest previous
enrollment was that of the fall quarter in
1921, when 2719 were signed up at the
end of the term, the number including
several who had dropped out during the
quarter. The record that year was unus
ually large because it was the last time
when students could enter without paying
increased tuition during their college
course. It showed a considerable increase
over the 1920 figure of 2495. Enrollment
last year was 2691.
Of the total registration, 639 are men
entering Stanford for the first time, and
163 arc women coming for their first year
at the University. The 500 limit of wo
men students is filled, as is the limited
group of 450 men who are permitted to

enter with less than approximately junior
standing.
The increase comcs in spite of the
raising of scholarship standards and tui
tion requirements. A larger proportion of
entering students who expcct to earn all
or part of their way through, reported by
the employment office, affords a concrcte
answer to those who have expressed a
fear that the tuition requirements would
lower the number of desirable students
of small means who could attend Stan
ford. The proportion of self-supporting
students has especially increased this year
among the women, and the various avail
able loan funds are already nearly ex
hausted. In accordance with the strong
recommendation of University authorities,
however, many of the men and women
expecting to earn most of their college
expenses have come with sufficient funds
to pay for their first quarter at Stanford.
