# Campus Secrets Disclosed; Jewelryman Relates Stories
## 
### Marjorie Allen, '26 
There is more than one side to every
story, if one is to believe the incidents
told by a certain traveling salesman
who is making his semi-annual tour
of the campus, selling sorority and
fraternity jewelry for a well-known
San Francisco firm. It seems that ho
acts as a marriage, consolation, and
general information bureau for more
than one student on each of the dif
ferent campuses in his territory. Listen
to his story:
"Yes, I'll have to admit that I've
learned a few things not generally
known about tlio different college cam
puses. It would never do for a woman
to hold my position because I have to
keep secrets by the dozen. For in
stance, there was tho fraternity man
who came into the office and ordered
an expensive sister pin. When it was
made up, he couldn't pay for it, so I

told him we would hold it for him.
He kept coming in from month to
month and asking us to keep it a
little longer. We kept it for eight
months until one day one of his fra
ternity brothers came in and ordered
a pin like the one we were holding.
He said he wanted it right away since
his girl was going to Smith in the
morning, so wo decided to sell him
the pin we had kept so long.
"The very next morning, the other
fellow came in to get his pin. He had
finally collected the money to pay for
it. Wo explained that it had been
sold just the day before. The poor
fellow was terribly disappointed. He
said ho wanted it right away as his
girl was going to Smith that morning.
Rather a funny coincident, wasn't it?
Not tho first time it has happened,
though.
"Then there were the two girls who
met 011 the train and became quite
good friends, until they found that
they were both wearing sister pins of
the same fraternity. That wasn't what
caused the change in their friendship,
but when they came to comparing
notes and discovered that the same
man had given the pins, it made a
difference.
"One of the funniest experiences in
my career happened a few years ago
when I was looking for a sorority
house on the California campus. The
house had evidently changed its loca
tion, for when I got there I saw the
sign "Druids" on the door. There
was an old Chinaman coming along
the street, so I asked him if he knew
where the house had been moved to.
Imagine my surprise when he said
'Me no know. Me Phi Delt.' Wonder
what the boys in the huose would have
thought if they had known their cook
was up to such tricks.
Negro Wears Costly Pin
"When I was down South, I saw a
negro wearing a fraternity pin on his
tie. It was worth hundreds of dollars.
I recognized the pin and its worth im
mediately, so I went up to him and
offered him a quarter for it. He
jumped at the chance to make such
easy money and I got the pin. Another
time I discovered a second-hand man
wearing a fraternity pin. I asked him
where he got it and he said he found
it 011 a pair of clothes and thought it
was pretty and had been wearing it
ever since.
"These are only a few of the little
stories which make life interesting
for me," he concluded. "Of course I
know all the romance connected with
the campuses, too."
And perhaps he does.

months until one day one of his fra
ternity brothers came in and ordered
a pin like the one we were holding.
He said he wanted it right away since
his girl was going to Smith in the
morning, so wo decided to sell him
the pin we had kept so long.
"The very next morning, the other
fellow came in to get his pin. He had
finally collected the money to pay for
it. Wo explained that it had been
sold just the day before. The poor
fellow was terribly disappointed. He
said ho wanted it right away as his
girl was going to Smith that morning.
Rather a funny coincident, wasn't it?
Not tho first time it has happened,
though.
"Then there were the two girls who
met 011 the train and became quite
good friends, until they found that
they were both wearing sister pins of
the same fraternity. That wasn't what
caused the change in their friendship,
but when they came to comparing
notes and discovered that the same
man had given the pins, it made a
difference.
"One of the funniest experiences in
my career happened a few years ago
when I was looking for a sorority
house on the California campus. The
house had evidently changed its loca
tion, for when I got there I saw the
sign "Druids" on the door. There
was an old Chinaman coming along
the street, so I asked him if he knew
where the house had been moved to.
Imagine my surprise when he said
'Me no know. Me Phi Delt.' Wonder
what the boys in the huose would have
thought if they had known their cook
was up to such tricks.
Negro Wears Costly Pin
"When I was down South, I saw a
negro wearing a fraternity pin on his
tie. It was worth hundreds of dollars.
I recognized the pin and its worth im
mediately, so I went up to him and
offered him a quarter for it. He
jumped at the chance to make such
easy money and I got the pin. Another
time I discovered a second-hand man
wearing a fraternity pin. I asked him
where he got it and he said he found
it 011 a pair of clothes and thought it
was pretty and had been wearing it
ever since.
"These are only a few of the little
stories which make life interesting
for me," he concluded. "Of course I
know all the romance connected with
the campuses, too."
And perhaps he does.
There is more than one side to every
story, if one is to believe the incidents
told by a certain traveling salesman
who is making his semi-annual tour
of the campus, selling sorority and
fraternity jewelry for a well-known
San Francisco firm. It seems that ho
acts as a marriage, consolation, and
general information bureau for more
than one student on each of the dif
ferent campuses in his territory. Listen
to his story:
"Yes, I'll have to admit that I've
learned a few things not generally
known about tlio different college cam
puses. It would never do for a woman
to hold my position because I have to
keep secrets by the dozen. For in
stance, there was tho fraternity man
who came into the office and ordered
an expensive sister pin. When it was
made up, he couldn't pay for it, so I

told him we would hold it for him.
He kept coming in from month to
month and asking us to keep it a
little longer. We kept it for eight
months until one day one of his fra

a pin like the one we were holding.
