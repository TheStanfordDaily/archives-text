# Revival of Plug Hat Is Planned by Juniors if Old Ruling Will Permit
## 
### 
Plug hats will again decorate the
domes of swanking juniors if the sugges
tion made at the meeting of the class yes
terday is adopted. A committee was ap
pointed by president Tom Grace to find
out if the University ruling tabooing the
old Plug Ugly fight also prohibits the
customs of wearing the hats. If they
can't wear plugs the juniors think they
may adopt something in the derby line as
an innovation. â€¢
