# VARSITY SHOWS CONFIDENCE AND DETERMINATION
## Cuddeback Declared Eligible, May Be Used at Halfback; Nevers' Punting Improves 
### 
Murray Cuddeback, who played full
last year, reported for practice for the
back on the Cardinal football squad
first time last night. Cuddeback was
admitted to the University last Satur
day and will be eligible for varsity
competition. Kerr plans on playing
him at halfback.
Confidence coupled with determination
to win, featured the attitude of the Card
football squad in their daily practice ses
sion yesterday after the 27 to 0 victory
over the strong Nevada eleven last Sat
urday.
Too much confidence is injurious to
any team, but an excess amount of cock
sureness seems to be absent on the Stan
ford eleven. What little crops out here
and there is favorably looked upon by
Coach Andy Kerr and his assistant
"Tiny" Thornhill, because, as an onlooker,
who has shared the victories and losses of
former Stanford teams, remarked, confi
dence has been a lacking element in the
Cardinal squads of yesteryear.
Big Ernie Nevers seems to have
earned a permanent berth in the backfield
seen letter men of last year's varsity
sistent passing and kicking which he dis
played in the Nevada game. Every aft
ernoon Nevers is out on the field early
kicking to one of his team mates. A
rough average of these punts during prac
tice totalled fifty yards, which means the
sophomore star can be relied on to boot
a consistent forty yards under competi
tion. "Dink" Templeton spends a few of
his oft" moments teaching the kickers the
fine points of the art, and with his as
sistance Nevers should develop into a
punter of no mean ability.
Probably a player who was watched
more closely than any other during the
game Saturday was Baker, who has been
assigned to the center position to replace
Dud DeGroot, last year's varsity captain.
Evidently Baker was living up to his rep
utation gained last year when he took
DeGroot's place, while the captain was
on the bench with a sore knee, for he
played fully three quarters of the game
before a substitute was sent in to replace
him. The attempts made by Monahan,
Nevada's big fullback, to gain through
center were usualy frustrated by the big
blonde pivot man. How he will act
against stronger competition is a matter
for debate.
