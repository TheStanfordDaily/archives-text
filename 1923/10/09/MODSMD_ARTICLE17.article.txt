# STANFORD GRAYS TO PLAY NAVAL ELEVEN SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Mike Reed's Stanford Grays will open
the 1923 football season against the Naval
Hospital eleven at 10 o'clock next Satur
day morning on the varsity fields.
Because Andy Kerr has been using his
men at will, before definitely assigning
them to gray uniforms, Reed was not able
to state what the probable line-up would
be in Saturday's game.
The Naval Hospital team is the same
aggregation which the varsity succeeded
in trompling 84 to 0. in the first scrim
mage a week ago last Saturday. What
the Grays will be able to do against sim
ilar competition is a matter for conjec
ture, but the dope is in favor of the Stan
ford eleven if the Sailors play a similar
brand of football displayed two weeks
ago.
The remainder of the Grays' schedule
calls for a game with the Agnctian Club
on October 20: October 27 is open and
Nov. 10 will wind up the season against
the California Grays.
Dick Hyland who has been declared
temporarily ineligible for the freshman
team will doubtless be on the Gray line
tip. ''Dutch" Henry and Dope Fuller have
also reported to Reed for practice .

Professor W. V. Cruess of the Univer
sity of California is to be sent to Europe
by the California Olive Growers and
other olive interests, in order to study
olive marketing and growing in foreign
countries.
