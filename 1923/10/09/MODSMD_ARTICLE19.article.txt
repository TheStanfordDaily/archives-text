# THE 						DUMB UNDERGRADUATE
## 
### 
Uetween the graduate, who received his A.B.
last June and now returns for more knowledge,
and the undergraduate who is still acquiring his
knowledge by the usual route, there is, in the
minds of the faculty, a deep and fearful abyss.
The professor giving undergraduate courses
has been forced, by numerous sad experiences,
to believe that the undergraduate is capable of
sponging up just so much knowledge at a swipe,
and that in order to make him do even this the
professor must push and drive him every day.
The graduate, on the other hand, is of a differ
ent species, lie is not going through his courses
in order to get a sheepskin and thus be able to
leave college without disgrace; he is listening
to the lecture because he wants to know, what
is being said. It is no wonder the undergraduate
suffers by the contrast.
The fact that not nearly as many undergradu
ates go to classes simply for the grades at the
end of the quarter as the professor has been led
to believe makes no difference; those who have
that attitude are the loud and painful minority,
and such is their effect on the nerves of the in
structing force that all in the class are forced to
suffer.
Perhaps if the professor were to meet the
undergraduate more nearly as an equal, impart
some of his own enthusiasm for his subject into
the student's mind, and not himself emphasize
the importance of grades as an end, the under
graduate would do as does the man in graduate
work â€”respond sincerely, warm to his work, and
display a real interest in the subject for its own
sake.
Perhaps, though, the first of the faculty to
make the experiment would choose the wrong
subject to work upon, and the subject would go
forth with the announcement of another snooze
course; whereupon the majority would continue
to suffer because of minority noises.
