# FORTY CANDIDATES TURN OUT FOR 1924 BASEBALL PRACTICE
## 
### 
Mor than forty candidates received
basball suits at the Encina gym yester
day preparatory to the early opening of
the 1924 baseball season.
Although no regular practice will be
held until Wednesday, a few of the more
enterprising candidates were on the field
yesterday taking the kinks out of their
throwing arms.
Harry Wolter, baseball coach, plans to
overcome the handicap experienced by the
loss of several letter men from last year's
squad, by beginning the season early, thus
giving him an opportunity to size up his
candidates before the first cut in the
spring quarter.
Another reason for beginning the sea
son, according to Coach Wolter, is that
the fall quarter is more free from show
ers than is the winter quarter, when
baseball practice has usually begun.
