To the Editor of the Spectator.
My Dear Henry:
We think that the present issue of the Spec
tator is the best student magazine which has
appeared on the campus in a year. Its pages are
bright and well arranged, its news is live and
well written, its rotagravure section clear and
interesting, and among the literary contributions
are works of which any college publication can
be proud. The Daily Palo Alto has only one sug
gestion to make: let's have another issue like this
one.
