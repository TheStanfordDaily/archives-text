# TRIP DEFINITELY SETTLED
## 
### 
Word has been received that final details of the Glee
Cluh's annual trip have been completed, and the mem
bers are alreay purchasing their railroad tickets.
It will include a trip through the North, or a two
weeks trip to New Orleans and the Mississippi Valley,
and home through Denver or a 10-days jour
ney to Alaska with stopovers at Tacoma and Ulgwak;
or a sailing tour to San Pedro and back via the Panama
Canal; or if this plan does not work out, a hiking trip
overland to the Great Salt Lake; perhaps instead, how
ever, an automobile tour through the Big Trees, ending
at Omaha; and it is possible that a barnstorming tour
around Nevada will be substituted if convenient.
In others words, the trip is all settled.
