# POINTS OF INTEREST TO BE VISITED IN SEATTLE
## 
### 
Among Seatle's most fashionable homes is that of
Mr. Addison Simms, mentioned yesterday. Mr. Simms
is the Man Who Remembers You Perfectly in all the
memory courses. He is the chap who is always bumping
into you and asking you the most intimate questions, like
"Well, well—and how are the old mortgages? Did you
manage to meet that interest payment of June 3?" And
when he does that, all you can do is to stammer a little
and ask him how in the world he does it. Five minutes
later he will be helping you clip a coupon off the lower
left hand corner of the page and starting you off on a
career of devastation like his.
Well, this Mr. Addison Simms has a beautiful house,
and it is one of the show places of Seattle. The sight
seeing boats make it a favorite stop. They come riding
gently up on the fog, and when the traffic policeman
gives them the high-sign they cast anchor right in the
middle of Main Street or whatever they call it up in
Seattle, and the guide does his stuff.
They used to take people through it for a quarter, but
now the place is closed. Mr. and Mrs. Simms aren t
living together. It appears that Mr. Simms
her as "My friend Millie, one of Flo Ziegfield's, you
know," at a Memory Expert's Ball. —N. E.
