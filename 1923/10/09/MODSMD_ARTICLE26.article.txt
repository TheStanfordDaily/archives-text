# THE 						THREE BEST WAYS TO DOPE A FOOTBALL GAME
## 
### 
1. The Gilkinson-Wulph System:
Based on purely scientific reasoning this system (not
invented by either Gilkinson or Wulf, but by Sir H. R.
Gilkinson Wulph) has as its foundation higher mathe
matics, up to and including dividing with fractions.
Suppose we want to find out the score of the coming
St. Mary's-Santa Clara game. California beat St. Mary's
49-0. California beat Santa Clara 48-0. The components
of this equation are best arranged as follows:
California beat St. Mary's, 49-0.
California beat Santa Clara, 48-0.
if we perform an algebraic subtraction we cancel
all the similar elements. For instance California equals
0. That is plain.
Now, take a beat from a beat, and the result is (not
a deadbeat, as some might think), but simply another
zero.
Santa Clara can't be taken from St. Mary's. It just
isn't done. Forty-eight from 49 is one. Zero from nothing
is ought.
Simple, isn't it? Santa Clara will beat St. Mary's, 1-0.
Now let us take the Big Game. Consider Nevada: : :
Stanford beat Nevada, 27-0.
California didn't beat Nevada at all.
Performing our usual subtraction, we arrive at the
inescapable conclusion that Stanford will beat California.
27-0.
Not, of course, that that is the only way to prove it's
correct. The final proof will be given on November 24.
The same method can be used in all sports, including
basketball, track, bridge, and auto-riding. But excepting
chess. There is no use predicting a chess match (inter
collegiate), for to the lay mind it always ends in a draw
(technical term, "checkmate").
The other two ways to dope football will be given
later, probably.

Out of the five On 'n Off items in yesterday's Daily,
four were announcements of marriages, and the other
one told of an engagement. More off than on, remarks
Oscar Blumph, mind expert.

"Drinking at Yale Means Dismissal, President Warns"
—headline. These modernist educationists, with their
free ideas! None of the old traditions are safe any more.

It is rumored that a new golf course is to be laid out
on some ground that may be deeded to the University.
The various locations given are the bottom of Sears
ville, Menlo Fark, Lagunita, and San Jose. The best
place, in our opinion, is the basement of Encina. No
balls could be lost there, and the greens could be kept
well watered (as they used to be, in the good old days).

The Band's new uniforms are said to be red and white.
Quite a startling innovation, as we remember they were
white and red last year.

Big upset! Phi Betes rate first in scholarship group
average. "As usual," Ihe women show a higher average
than the men. But then, look at the number of thein
that don't go out. (Number One —and she's blind and
deaf, besides being dumb).
