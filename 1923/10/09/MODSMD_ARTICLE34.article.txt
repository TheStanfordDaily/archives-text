Good cooking means home cook
ing at Wilson's. Contained in the
service code for Wilson's Chefs
is the following:
"Croquettes, Hash, Hamburger,
Sausages and Stews are thor
oughly enjoyable entrees when
properly prepared, but the public
has been deceived so often that
there is an opportunity for us to
gain many friends by paying par
ticular attention to these items.
When you offer them on Menu
from time to time you must be
sure that they taste like home.
They must be made from fresh
meats of first quality, selected
specially for the purpose."
