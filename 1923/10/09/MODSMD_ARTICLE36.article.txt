track team conditioning themselves for
the 1924 season.
Among the letter men were: "Swede"
Leistner, hurdler, Campbell, sprinter,
Charley Daly, distance runner, Hale,
sprinter, Hayes, distance man, Van Judah,
captain of the 1924 track team, and Pat
Murphy, distance runner.
From last year's freshman team, Mil
ler, Lloyd, Cypher, Kerr, Thompson, and

Light workouts which will develop the
wind of the candidate and keep their
muscles in fit condition, are all that Tem
