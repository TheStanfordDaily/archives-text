"Strangers of the Night," (Captain
; Varsity theater, Palo Alto,
tonight and Wednesday.
In ''Strangers of the Night" blood and
humor work well together .for here the
one does not depend upon the other;
there is no mixture; the elements are laid
on *ii slices, very enjoyable ones, too.
"We wrapt them up in a mainsail tight,
With twice ten turns of a hawser's bight,
And we heaved 'em over and out of sight,
With a 'yo! heave ho!' and a 'fare-you
well,'
Ten fathoms deep on the road to hell,
Yo! ho! ho! and a bottle of rum!"
And then comes a slicc of humor, when
Ambrose Applejack (played by Matt
Moore) comes back from dreaming ad
ventures on the Spanish main to face the
experiences of his own household. He is
a good enough actor to appreciate that
milk and gasoline don't mix and though
the personality of the bloody ancestor
pirate comes in for a "hell cat! ' and an
occasional "scum-m," Ambrose retains his
own aunt-bred timidity.
Barbara LaMarr will certainly find
herself more fully appreciated as "the
devil in the pie" than as a sweet heroine
of the great north country. A really
pleasant piece of acting. Enid Bennett is
the weakest link of a good romance. She
appears as equable among strangers of
the night as the suit of armor in the hall,
yet previously is greatly disturbed when
Ambrose neglects his tobacco at 9:10 p.m.
The play is slow in starting, goes well
for some time and ends like an episode of
"Scar-face Bender." In this respect the
movie is noticeably weaker than the stage
version.
