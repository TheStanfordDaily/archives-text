# Golf Knickers Threaten To Supercede Stanford Roughs' Cord Supremacy
## 
### 
The supremacy of the Stanford)
rough with his long-famed campus out-,
fit is to be contested.
Latest observations on the Quad re
veal the fact that a new fad has come
into our midst unannounced and with-'
out cause. The new "Golfer's Special"
threatens to displace the popular
rough outfit which has had a leading
position in campus dress for many
years. Just how much ground the
"Going a Golfing" equipment will gain
is a question for the roughs to decide.
Numerous threats by members of the
old clan of dress are reported to have
been made both at the Law steps and
at the Engineer's corner. But, the dar
ing wearers of the new togs still brave
stares and remarks just to be in
"style."
In an interview with one of the in
dignant corduroy upholders, it was
said that "These here knicker outfits
are the 'rocks.' It's about time that
some of these guys find out whether
they are going to Stanford or to a
correspondence school for golfers."
