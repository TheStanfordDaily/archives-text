# AT 21 YEARS OF AGE
## Registrar Elliott Entered Cornell as Freshman From Rushford Academy 
### 
Dr. Orrin Leslie Elliott, registrar of
the University, entered Cornell univer
sity when he was 21 years old. He had
just completed sufficient work at
Rushford Academy to enable him to
pass the entrance examinations and
enter the Department of History and
Political Science. The academy had
formerly been known as the Union
Free School. It had 110 fixed courses
of study and gave no diplomas. As a
result, the entering students took all
the courses available and left the in
stitution when they had taken all they
could get or wanted, without any
graduation.
While in the Husliford Academy,
Register Elliott lived at homo with
his parents at Centerville, New York,
and went daily to the Academy at
Rushford five miles away. He worked
all his spare time on the dairy farm
liis father owned and his summers
were mostly spent in the hayfleld.

Dr. Elliott cared little for farming
but had no idea when he entered col
lege what he wanted to do. When
someone asked him if he were going
to take up the classical or scientific
courses he replied he supposed he
would take all the courses they had,
not realizing that there were Depart
ments of Science, Science and Letters,
Classics, History, and Political Science.
Few students went to college in 1881
when Dr. Elliott entered. His Rush
ford principal persuaded him to con
tinue with his work and he was the
second student to go to college from
the academy in two years. Three hun
dred and seventy students were regis
tered in Cornell, which was founded
in 18G8. Dr. lliott entered the college
almost a complete stranger, his only
friend being the man who had gone
from the academy two years earlier
and who had taken him to visit the
university for a week the year before
he started there.
