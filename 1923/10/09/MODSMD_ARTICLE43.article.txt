# Large Per Cent of New Students Fail to Pass English Examinations
## 
### 
With a total of 495 freshmen tak
ing the matriculation examination in
English at the beginning of the quar
tet 322 failed to make passing grades,
leaving 173 first-year students exempt
from English "A" requirements. These
are the results shown on the lists post
ed by the English* department.
If further proof is necessary, women
are shown to be more intelligent than
men; out of 42 women listed, only 20,
or about 47.5, failed to pass. For the
men the percentage of failures was
66.5, or 302 out of 453.
The new class had a higher per
centage of failures than did '26. The
examinations last year showed that
61 per cent of the women flunked the
test.
