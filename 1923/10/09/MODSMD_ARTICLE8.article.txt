# PLAY TRYOUTEES NUMEROUS: DAVIS WILL EXTEND TIME
## Primary Tryouts Continued Tonight; Successful Candidates Will Also Report 
### 
On the first night of tryouts for the |
Sword and Sandals play one of the largest :
crowds ever handled on the Assembly
hall stage was examined by Gordon Davis,
dramatic coach. Because of this, tryouts j
will be continued tonight for those who
did not come yesterday and second try
outs will also be held at the same time for
last night's successful candidates.
This showing, thinks Davis, seems to:
presage a good year for Stanford dra-'■
matics. Those who did not make the see-1
ond tryouts were rejected only because
there were no parts in this piece for their
types. Their papers are merely interred, j
not dead, he says, for he intends to keep
them for future reference.
Following is a list of those who are to;
report this evening to the Assembly hall.
Any who have not already tried out for j
the first time should also report.

crowds ever handled on the Assembly
hall stage was examined by Gordon Davis,
dramatic coach. Because of this, tryouts j
will be continued tonight for those who
did not come yesterday and second try
outs will also be held at the same time for
last night's successful candidates.
This showing, thinks Davis, seems to:
presage a good year for Stanford dra-'■
matics. Those who did not make the see-1
ond tryouts were rejected only because
there were no parts in this piece for their
types. Their papers are merely interred, j
not dead, he says, for he intends to keep
them for future reference.
Following is a list of those who are to;
report this evening to the Assembly hall.

the first time should also report.
