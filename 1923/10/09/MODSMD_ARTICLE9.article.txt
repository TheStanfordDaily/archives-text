# GREEK REVOLUTION IS LECTURE TOPIC FOR THIS EVENING
## Professor A. T. Murray Says Revolt Was Bloodless And Well Planned 
### 
"Practically bloodless" is the de-l
scription of the Greek revolution of
September, 1922, given by Professor I
A. T. Murray of the Classical depart-J
raent. Professor Murray will lecture in
the Assembly Hall at 7:30 this evening,
on his experience ni Greece at the
! time of the revolution.
"It was a very model revolution,";
; said Professor Murray, "since the j
plans were shrewdly made. The army I
insisted on deposing King Constan-,
tine, as they felt he had betrayed
Greece. He was forced to abdicate, a,
revolutionary committee took charge,;
and George 11, son of Constantine, was
made king under their supervision. All i
this happened very quietly, even in
Athens, where the actual rebellion oc
curred."
Social and political factors causing
the civil war, incidents of the revolt,
i and its effect upon the present condi
tions in Greece, will be discussed by
Professor Murray in his lecture this
evening. He. will also touch on the
j Greek campaign in Asia Minor, and its
probable settlement.
Professor Murray has just returned

first day of the revolution. He spent
eight months as a member of the fac
ulty of the American School of Classi
cal Studies in Athens. This is a college
for graduate students of theology. Each
academic year a professor from an
American university is sent to this j
school. Among other interesting ex
| perience while abroad, Professor Mur-|
' ray had the opportunity of viewing the {
: excavations at Crete.
A member of the Stanford faculty;
