WHEREVER you see the yellow and red Shell
signs at service stations, at garages and other
dealers, in cities and towns everywhere in the west,
there you can count upon getting uniformly good
gasoline and good service. Shell Gasoline is quick
to start, is quick in action, is powerful, dependable,
and economical.
