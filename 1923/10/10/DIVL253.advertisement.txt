Large ring-end links to note-book 9 I

WE asked about 1000 students at sev- I Hpjsjj
enteen universities and colleges the grail i
kind of pen they wanted. | oQi
The majority preferred the Parker, but liJ^lrl
not all could afford to pay the Parker Duo- |k3b|
fold price.
So we set to work and produced this
black beauty—the Parker D. Q. —formed 1
on Duofold's classic lines and made by the
same crafts-guild. jgfprrf]
We gave it a 14k gold point tipped with lift |
polished Iridium, and a good healthy ink uH||||fl
capacity; then we added two things we |H|l|||U
could find on no other pen of this size be- jHMBI
low five dollars—a metal girdle to reinforce ,
the, cap; and ari extra large ring link to |w 'Ml
fasten to the student's note-book. These
features are included free, or a pocket-clip Ifl l B|l
instead of ring-end. 9H ,||B I
The Parker D. Q. is an ink-tight pen. Ask to see MM Hh|l
it—note its shapeliness and balance. Try other pens HI |^a|l
too, and see how super-smooth the Parker is in BM >|i 1
comparison. jfj* a H
