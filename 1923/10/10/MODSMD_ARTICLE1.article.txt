# MURRAY ASSERTS GREEKS NOT READY TO FORM REPUBLIC
## Position of King Constantine In Revolt, Attitude of People Discussed 
### 
"Greece is not ready for a republic
1 do not see King George's throne en
dangered, although passionate loyaltj
to the Constantine faction, and just
as strong opposition, are still to be
seen in Greece," said Professor A. T,
Murray of the Classic department yes
terday evening in his address on the
Greek revolution of September, 1922.
"During the war King Constantine
was literally between two fires with
his pro-German sympathies on. one
side and the necessity of remaining
on friendly terms with Great Britain
on the other," explained Professor
Murray. "The country was divided into
hostile camps in 1916. Venizelos had
started liis revolution against Con
stantine's regime, and had become the
head of a Greek state which was out
side the normal government but was
felt to be the real Greece.
"In June, 1917, Constantine was
forced to relinquish the throne, but he
did not give up his claim to it. Alex
ander, a younger son, was left to act
as king. Then on November 14, 1920,
after the tragic death of King Alexan
der, Constantine was recalled by an
overwhelmingly large vote, and re
sumed the throne of Greece under pro
test from the allies. Venizelos was
practically ousted.
"The government went further with
a wild scheme to attack Constanti
nople, withdrawing the troops from
Asia Minor for the attack. The Turks
scattered the Greek line in a sudden
onslaught.
"I was struck by the fact that the
troops did not look beaten," said Mur
ray. "They looked forlorn and shabby,
like an army which has not been cared
for, but they did not look like a beaten
army.
"They would rather have a beaten
army driven out than to withdraw.
They were afraid to have an unbeaten
army come home," was the opinion of
Professor Murray.
"We reached Athens about noon,
September 26, the day the revolution
was ushered in. Airplanes had been fly
ing over the city dropping proclama-
tions from the army demanding the
abdication of Constantino, and it was
considered hardly possible that any
resistance would be made. At dinner,
Dr. Hill, of the American School of
Classical Studies, announced that he
had learned the revolution was to take
place that night."
Two weeks later, at an assembly of
the people in the square of Athens,
Plastiras, one of the revolutionary
leaders, declared: "The army feels
that it has been betrayed. Our purpose
is to overthrow an unworthy govern
ment and to punish those responsible
for the national catastrophe."
