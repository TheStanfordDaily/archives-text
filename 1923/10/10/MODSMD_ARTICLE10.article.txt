# Palomar, Eccentric Theorist and Wood-Carver, Talks on Life
## 
### 
Who would think that bits of wood —
just plain ordinary pine and redwood
blocks that one uses for kindling —
would have anything interesting in
them? One man has found them so,
anyway. He is a strange, interesting
old man with long, iron-gray hair, and
eccentric, baggy, faded clothes. For
the present, San Jose is his home,
though he comes from Southern Cali
fornia—"God's own country," as he
calls it.
And, as if he were pining for his
southern sunshine, he seeks the best
substitute and sits in the sun on the
lawn of the State Teachers College,
carving his bits of wood. "I like the
sun; it is good for my rheumatics," he
explained.
"Wood Is Intelligent"
"I consider the wood intelligent, and
I like to assist nature by kind treat
ment to show what is in her. The art
of wood-carving dates back many
thousand years before Christ and even
beyond the early civilizations of the
Nile where my people came from. It
is probably such an art as was prac
ticed by the Aztecs of Mexico, who

became so degenerated as the Ameri
can people will be 100 years from now,
and Europeans in less time than that.
Nature eventually makes Man follow
her course or destroys him."
Then he pointed out the strange in
teresting figures made by the grain
of the wood. "That looks like Jane
Cowl as Juliet. There is an elephant,
here a flower, and there a tiger," he
went on. And, if one looked very hard,
and had imagination, one might see,
the figures as he saw them.
Scorns Convention in Art
"I don't like anything conventional
in art. I merely act as a medium for
the wood's expression," said the carv
er, who calls himself Palomar, the
Egyption. "That's the name I used to
have in opera: 'Palomar, the Egyp
tion, the white serpent of the Nile' —j
and that is all anyone calls me."
Palomar picks up pieces of wood
around the yards, no matter how
unpromising they look, and after
treating them with oil, carves them
with bits of glass, stone, and an old
bent knife. No tools could be more
primitive.
As to his family, well, Palomar was
rather reticent. But he finally said
that his wife, Ethel Whitehead
Coombes, was a musician and dra
matic reader. And then he pulled out
an interesting play-bill of a former
performance. "But she's selling stock
ings since I've been sick. She can't
make her salt at it, but we have come
to believe that the spiritual is the
only worthwhile side of life. The ne
cessities take second place. But I don't
call Mrs. Coombes, wife —she is my
chum, my pal."

And, as if he were pining for his
southern sunshine, he seeks the best
substitute and sits in the sun on the
lawn of the State Teachers College,
carving his bits of wood. "I like the
sun; it is good for my rheumatics," he
explained.
"Wood Is Intelligent"
"I consider the wood intelligent, and
I like to assist nature by kind treat
ment to show what is in her. The art
of wood-carving dates back many
thousand years before Christ and even
beyond the early civilizations of the
Nile where my people came from. It
is probably such an art as was prac
ticed by the Aztecs of Mexico, who

became so degenerated as the Ameri
can people will be 100 years from now,
and Europeans in less time than that.
Nature eventually makes Man follow
her course or destroys him."
Then he pointed out the strange in
teresting figures made by the grain
of the wood. "That looks like Jane
Cowl as Juliet. There is an elephant,
here a flower, and there a tiger," he
went on. And, if one looked very hard,
and had imagination, one might see,
the figures as he saw them.
Scorns Convention in Art
"I don't like anything conventional
in art. I merely act as a medium for
the wood's expression," said the carv
er, who calls himself Palomar, the
Egyption. "That's the name I used to
have in opera: 'Palomar, the Egyp
tion, the white serpent of the Nile' —j
and that is all anyone calls me."
Palomar picks up pieces of wood
around the yards, no matter how
unpromising they look, and after
treating them with oil, carves them
with bits of glass, stone, and an old
bent knife. No tools could be more
primitive.
As to his family, well, Palomar was
rather reticent. But he finally said
that his wife, Ethel Whitehead
Coombes, was a musician and dra
matic reader. And then he pulled out
an interesting play-bill of a former
performance. "But she's selling stock
ings since I've been sick. She can't
make her salt at it, but we have come
to believe that the spiritual is the
only worthwhile side of life. The ne
cessities take second place. But I don't
call Mrs. Coombes, wife —she is my
chum, my pal."
Who would think that bits of wood —
just plain ordinary pine and redwood
blocks that one uses for kindling —
would have anything interesting in
them? One man has found them so,
anyway. He is a strange, interesting
old man with long, iron-gray hair, and
eccentric, baggy, faded clothes. For
the present, San Jose is his home,
though he comes from Southern Cali
fornia—"God's own country," as he
calls it.
