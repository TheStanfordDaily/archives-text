# "ANDROCLES AND LION" TO BE PRODUCED
## Sword and Sandals Choose Shaw Comedy for First Play of Year 
### James Muir, '25 
"Androcles and the Lion," by George
Bernard Shaw, has been selected by
Sword and Sandals to be their offering
for the entertainment of the campus
next month. And it promises to be 1
a real entertainment, too, for Shaw
in this piece has produced a comedy
that entirely belies its high-sounding
title.
It is an ambitious play by a well-'
known author which will make it
worth anyone's while, yet not in the
least can it be said to be highbrow.
The whole thing is an amusing farce

which sometimes becomes even broail
farce, packed with laughs. "You Never
Can Tell," the sophomore play of two
years ago, by the same writer, seemed
to get over big, and this piece is of
the same general type, only far more
amusing, according to Coach Davis.
In all history of tanford dramatics,
says Davis, there has been nothing
quite like it in scope and appeal. In
places it becomes a regular Mack
Senentt burlesque. One of these is in
the second act where the setting is
laid behind the scenes of the Roman
am a. Gladiators, Christians, and ani
mals are waiting to do their bit for
the amusement of the Roman em
peror and a "call boy" dashes back
and forth, as if on a modern stage,
calling them on when their turns
come.
Another comedy part is that of tho
Lion who has his bloody fun with the
Christians in the arena. The Lion, ac
cording to Davis, will be the leading
man of the play. He will have to ex
press the whole gamut of emotions
with his antics and grunts and groans,
not a single word of English or any
other language being spoken. With
this part he has a chance to "run
away with the show." This is some
thing new in the line of comedians.
The play is a very spectacular affair
as well. A very large cast is used and
from the clever talent both old and
new which has shown up at tryouts,
Davis thinks it will be the best-acted
show he has ever put on here. There
is an opportunity for ambitious stag
ing in setting up the Coliseum and the
costuming will go to give it a spec
tacular effect. Such a combination of
appeals should not disappoint anyone.
"Androcles and the Lion" was given
very successfully in California at the
Greek Theatre. It is often used as
an opening bill in theatrical seasons
because of its humor and general
popularity. The characters talk like
"de guy in de streets," which human
ess gives the play a great deal of
its humor.
Those whose names are given below
are asked to report tonight for final
tryouts at 7 o'clock in the Assembly |
hall. Other 9 will look for their names
tomorrow as the great number of try
outees makes it necessary to take
them in two groups.

Lion who has his bloody fun with the
Christians in the arena. The Lion, ac
cording to Davis, will be the leading
man of the play. He will have to ex
press the whole gamut of emotions
with his antics and grunts and groans,
not a single word of English or any
other language being spoken. With
this part he has a chance to "run
away with the show." This is some
thing new in the line of comedians.
The play is a very spectacular affair
as well. A very large cast is used and
from the clever talent both old and
new which has shown up at tryouts,
Davis thinks it will be the best-acted
show he has ever put on here. There
is an opportunity for ambitious stag
ing in setting up the Coliseum and the
costuming will go to give it a spec
tacular effect. Such a combination of
appeals should not disappoint anyone.
"Androcles and the Lion" was given
very successfully in California at the
Greek Theatre. It is often used as
an opening bill in theatrical seasons
because of its humor and general
popularity. The characters talk like
"de guy in de streets," which human
ess gives the play a great deal of
its humor.
Those whose names are given below
are asked to report tonight for final
tryouts at 7 o'clock in the Assembly |
hall. Other 9 will look for their names
tomorrow as the great number of try
outees makes it necessary to take
them in two groups.

"Androcles and the Lion," by George
Bernard Shaw, has been selected by
Sword and Sandals to be their offering
for the entertainment of the campus
next month. And it promises to be 1
a real entertainment, too, for Shaw
in this piece has produced a comedy
that entirely belies its high-sounding
title.
It is an ambitious play by a well-'
known author which will make it
worth anyone's while, yet not in the
least can it be said to be highbrow.
The whole thing is an amusing farce

which sometimes becomes even broail
farce, packed with laughs. "You Never
Can Tell," the sophomore play of two
years ago, by the same writer, seemed
to get over big, and this piece is of
the same general type, only far more
amusing, according to Coach Davis.
In all history of tanford dramatics,
says Davis, there has been nothing
quite like it in scope and appeal. In
places it becomes a regular Mack
Senentt burlesque. One of these is in
the second act where the setting is
laid behind the scenes of the Roman
am a. Gladiators, Christians, and ani
mals are waiting to do their bit for
the amusement of the Roman em
peror and a "call boy" dashes back
and forth, as if on a modern stage,
calling them on when their turns
come.
Another comedy part is that of tho
Lion who has his bloody fun with the
Christians in the arena. The Lion, ac
cording to Davis, will be the leading
