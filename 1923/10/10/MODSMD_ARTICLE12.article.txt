# BABE ELEVEN SEEMS SLIGHTLY STRONGER THAN LAST YEAR'S
## 
### 
With an excellent start in the 1923
season, Coach "Husky" Hunt's fresh
man eleven will attempt to defeat Mo
desto High School next Saturday, as
a preliminary to the varsity and Santa
Clara scrap.
Now that the smoke has cleared
from last Saturday's brawl with the
Davis Farm aggregation, a clear view
can be taken of the freshmen's show
ing. Although Davis defeated the first
year men by a 7-6 score, the loss was
not a decisive one. The fact that in
the same day the 1927 squad handed
a 19-0 pasting to the San Jose High:
School eleven and held the fast Berke-I
ley High team to a scoreless tie, shows j
that Coach Hunt has many capable
performers on his squad.
Last year the 1926 machine beat
Berkeley 27-26, and had to use its
best men to do it. This year a team
composed entirely of substitutes not
only held an equally good Berkeley
team to a tie, but had the ball on their
opponents' five-yard line when the
final gun was shot.
During the 1922 season, San Jose
High School defeated the third fresh
man eleven in a slow, uninteresting
contest, 3-0. Saturday the third fresh- 1
men sent the San Jose lads on their
homeward journey minus their scalps
and with a 0-19 label sticking on their ,
coat-tails.
Davis Farm was far from an early
season set-up. Playing intercollegiate.
football and with older men in their
lineup, the Aggies naturally had the
edge on the babes. But they needed
every bit of their edge against the
fight the first-year men put up. The
freshmen felt strongly their lack of
reserves due to the two games previ
ously played. However, they gained in-1
valuable experience from the set-to
with the Aggies.
Modesto will be no snap next Sat
urday. Reports from the southern city
indicate a heavy, fast team. The babes
should emerge the victors by a deci
sive margin, but a fast game should
result.
