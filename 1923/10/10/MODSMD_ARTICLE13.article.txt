# SOCCER VARSITY WILL MIX WITH SAN MATEO
## 
### 
The varsity soccer team is hard at
work preparing for its battle with the
Sons of St. George from San Mateo
next Saturday afternoon. It is essen
tial that the Stanford men win this
game, if they want to keep in the run
ning for the league title. The Sons of
St. George will in all probability pre
sent a strong line-up, but they are not
expected to be as strong as the Vi
kings, last week's opponent.
In their first game the Sons of St. j
George lost to the fast Olympic Club
team while the Stanford men dropped
a close game to the Vikings. How
ever, Coach Harry Maloney has made
several shifts in his line-up and ex
pects to present a much stronger team
this week.
The big trouble with the team last
Saturday was the lack of practice of
the players, and a weak defense. To
overcome this Ralph Howe has been
shifted to fullback to help Walter
Campbell to protect the goal. Captain
Bill Swayne will play center half, and
the entire forward line will be reor
ganized.
Hoover is slated to start at outside
right, Cardosa at inside left, Munford
at center forward, Quigley at inside
left, and Richardson at outside left.
Maloney had this line working at the
last practice and it proved to be a
success. i
