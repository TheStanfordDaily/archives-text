STANFORD IS NOT A RICH MAN'S UNIVERSITY
lii spite of all the information and advice that can
be given out by Stanford men, the notion persists
wherever the $96 tuition clause is known that the
Farm has become somewhat of a rich man's college.
On the bare face of it, $96 every three months
seems a steep price. Those who consider coming to
Stanford have a right to weigh it carefully. But
while they are judging, they should also be thor
oughly informed of the following facts in the
balance:
Stanford gives more opportunities for self-sup
port on its campus aftd in the vicinity than any big
college in the West;
There are no universities on the Pacific Coast of
fering such excellent living and eating accommoda
tions for the prices asked by Stanford for a room
in the dormitories and board at the eating halls;
Scholarships paying all reasonable expenses of
students are offered every year in all large Pacific
Coats cities, and these scholarships are based on a
prep school student's all-around ability and character,
never alone on his record of high grades;
Numerous loan funds are available at Stanford
itself for those students who are making their own
way;
Most important, most convincing, and most repre
sentative of the sincere wish of the Stanford adminis
tration to give an opportunity to all, is the tuition
note plan whereby Stanford loans a student his ed
ucation, asking only the incidental fee which has
been a necessity since the opening of the University.
! It is gratifying therefore, to see in the announce
ment made yesterday that Stanford lias more stu
dents than ever l>efore, that she also has more in
proportion of those students who have always stood
for the best in Stanford's ideal of independence: the
man who comes to college of his own independent
action, intending to pay his own way as he goes.

seems a steep price. Those who consider coming to
Stanford have a right to weigh it carefully. But
while they are judging, they should also be thor
oughly informed of the following facts in the
balance:
Stanford gives more opportunities for self-sup
port on its campus aftd in the vicinity than any big
college in the West;
There are no universities on the Pacific Coast of
fering such excellent living and eating accommoda
tions for the prices asked by Stanford for a room
in the dormitories and board at the eating halls;
Scholarships paying all reasonable expenses of
students are offered every year in all large Pacific
Coats cities, and these scholarships are based on a
prep school student's all-around ability and character,
never alone on his record of high grades;
Numerous loan funds are available at Stanford
itself for those students who are making their own
way;
Most important, most convincing, and most repre
sentative of the sincere wish of the Stanford adminis
tration to give an opportunity to all, is the tuition
note plan whereby Stanford loans a student his ed
ucation, asking only the incidental fee which has
been a necessity since the opening of the University.
! It is gratifying therefore, to see in the announce
ment made yesterday that Stanford lias more stu
dents than ever l>efore, that she also has more in
proportion of those students who have always stood
for the best in Stanford's ideal of independence: the
man who comes to college of his own independent
action, intending to pay his own way as he goes.

STANFORD IS NOT A RICH MAN'S UNIVERSITY
lii spite of all the information and advice that can
be given out by Stanford men, the notion persists
wherever the $96 tuition clause is known that the
Farm has become somewhat of a rich man's college.
On the bare face of it, $96 every three months
seems a steep price. Those who consider coming to
Stanford have a right to weigh it carefully. But
