In emulation of the freshman class which every
year startle the campus by choosing a more wild and
more collegiate decoration for their sophomore head
gear, the juniors have decided that they must do
something to make themselves conspicuous on the
campus. They have concluded that a nice clumsy
plug, the kind that used to be worn in the days when
it was considered a good joke to tie a goat to the
bedpost of the dean of men, would do the trick.
The Daily Palo Alto quite agress with the class of
'25; the wearing of such a relic of the past would
make them about as noticeable as a ruling providing
for a hole in every junior's trousers, and for much
the same reasons.
The purpose of most traditions of campus cloth
ing is to provide comfort for the wearer, and elim
inate unnecessary expense. The only possible reason
for a revival of the plug is to allow the proud junior
to overhear strangers remarking: "Oh, see the play
ful college boys!"
