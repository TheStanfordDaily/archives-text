To those who prize every opportunity to hear the
music of great artists, announcement of the winter
program of the Peninsula Musical association comes
as most welcome news. Through the efforts of this
association Stanford and Palo Alto are enabled to
enjoy artistic expression rarely offered in small
communities.
