Just a suggestion: It might save time and trouble if,
in announcing hereafter the names of those who suc
cessfully passed the preliminary tryouts for Sword and
Sandals' play, a form blank such as the following be
used, and posted up on the P. O.:
"The following students successfully passed the pre
liminary tryouts yesterday for Sword and Sandals' play,
and are requested to report at the Assembly Hall to
morrow night at 7:30.
Student directories can be obtained at the
Administration Building for 15 cents."

The big scholarship point battle is now over, and the
proud organizations who lead are swelling up with the
effect it will all have on the rushees next quarter.
But in all fairness, why not extend the point system
to subjects of real concern? Such as:
ALPHA SIGMA TOPS ORGANIZATIONS
IN MEAT POINTS FOR QUARTER
Standings given out by Palo Alto butchers today show
that Alpha Phi Sigma has cinched the inter-living group
meat-eating contest, with a point average of 1.67894 (lbs.
per person per day). Next closest was the Eskimo Club
with 1.55587, but as 90 per cent of this is rumored to be
whale blubber, El Soupo claims second place with
.99786 points. Sororities, with the exception of the
Tri-Gammas, are far below the men's groups, the highest
women's average being .000911.
Pi Pi is contesting the award on the basis that ham
burger should not be counted as meat, due to the large
proportion of wood-pulp present. The butchers' commit
tee, however, has voted down the claim.
♦ * *
The Juniors have appointed a committee to find out
if the University prohibits the wearing of plug hats.
No, Horace, neither does it prohibit shaving on the
postoffice steps, having your hair cut in intricate de
signs, or wearing garden hose in place of a necktie.
* * *
After seeing the long line of pajamarinos last night,
we wonder if the D. U. house, to safeguard against the
growing future, hadn't better adopt the custom of giving
out peanuts or Chicle sticks instead of apples. Imagine
what it'll be like when there are fourteen dormitories
instead of four.

THE BACK ROW
(Cabbages' Own Dramatic Review Department)
"The Woman He Loved": Second Varsity Theatre,
Palo Alto, last night and tonight (maybe).
Outside of the thinness of the plot and the poor scenic
effects, this might be called a good picture if the acting
was not so second-rate and the seats so hard.
"Mushy" Mae Minter shows good form, but not
enough. The idea revolves around a light housekeeper's
daughter who has forsaken the old Cape Cod coast to
earn an honest living drawing lottery tickets. The di
rector was apparently all set for a bit of humor here,
but his only mistake was that he didn't make it funny.
In the scene where the aviator-hero makes a daredevil
leap from the plane to the moving caterpillar, we noticed
that one of the spark plugs was cracked. Obviously a
bizarre situation which reflects the careless directing of
Cecil B. De Stille. *
Not that we want to seem critical or anything, but it
does seem that in the scene where Harold Cutaway says
"God, How I Love You, Woman!" the lounge in the
center back really shouldn't be directly in front of the
mirror. How can movies advance without art.
To Be Reviewed< Next Week: Buster Keaton, in
"Passion."

It is said that the administration is going to build a
postoffice that will accommodate every student in the
University.
Well, no more dormitory problems to solve now.

No, Horace, neither does it prohibit shaving on the

After seeing the long line of pajamarinos last night,
we wonder if the D. U. house, to safeguard against the
growing future, hadn't better adopt the custom of giving
out peanuts or Chicle sticks instead of apples. Imagine
what it'll be like when there are fourteen dormitories
instead of four.

"The Woman He Loved": Second Varsity Theatre,
Palo Alto, last night and tonight (maybe).
Outside of the thinness of the plot and the poor scenic
effects, this might be called a good picture if the acting
was not so second-rate and the seats so hard.
"Mushy" Mae Minter shows good form, but not
enough. The idea revolves around a light housekeeper's
daughter who has forsaken the old Cape Cod coast to
earn an honest living drawing lottery tickets. The di
rector was apparently all set for a bit of humor here,
but his only mistake was that he didn't make it funny.
In the scene where the aviator-hero makes a daredevil
leap from the plane to the moving caterpillar, we noticed
that one of the spark plugs was cracked. Obviously a
bizarre situation which reflects the careless directing of
Cecil B. De Stille. *
Not that we want to seem critical or anything, but it
does seem that in the scene where Harold Cutaway says
"God, How I Love You, Woman!" the lounge in the
center back really shouldn't be directly in front of the
mirror. How can movies advance without art.

cessfully passed the preliminary tryouts for Sword and

ALPHA SIGMA TOPS ORGANIZATIONS
IN MEAT POINTS FOR QUARTER
Standings given out by Palo Alto butchers today show
that Alpha Phi Sigma has cinched the inter-living group
meat-eating contest, with a point average of 1.67894 (lbs.
per person per day). Next closest was the Eskimo Club
with 1.55587, but as 90 per cent of this is rumored to be
whale blubber, El Soupo claims second place with
.99786 points. Sororities, with the exception of the
Tri-Gammas, are far below the men's groups, the highest
women's average being .000911.
Pi Pi is contesting the award on the basis that ham
burger should not be counted as meat, due to the large
proportion of wood-pulp present. The butchers' commit
tee, however, has voted down the claim.
