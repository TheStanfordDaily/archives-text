# "Sock 'Em"

The golf-sock complex is right on us now.
We have fought it as long as we could, but it has a
foothold. The question is, will it go any further?
Stanford has too few traditions left. The Plug-Ugly,
the Baseball Fight, the Poster Fight, Public Initiations,
Washington Day Parade, and a host of others.
But wo have always been able to say that a Stanford
man did not need to be a clothing store model for Hart
and his gang.
Cords have always been permissible, and desirable,
among upperclassmen. They have been accepted as the
everyday standard of war. The fellow with a thick bank
book can't get cords with fancy designs any more than
can he who works and saves his cash. But golf socks
may mark the dividing line.
"They do it in the East." Yes, and they do many
things in the East that we don't do here, such as "flour
fights" and public bidding.
Bell-bottom cords met a hasty fate, and rather well
deserved. But we can't slit golf socks up the side so
easily.
Although, after all, what it will amount to will be an
aristocracy of legs. Those with bow-legs, knock-knees,
rickets, and artificial limbs will have to stick to the
cords, and the old-style wear will become a symbol of
physical handicap instead of a symbol of Stanford
equality.
Golf-socks are to play golf in. Any man who doesn't
wear them while playing is foolish. But for playing
"Hail, The Conquering Hero " every morning, noon,
and night, they are poor instruments.
No, T haven't got knock-knees, or bow-legs, or rickets,
or artificial limbs (or even one). â€”DR. JEKYLL.
