# CLASS FOOTBALL IS UNDERWAY; MAY HAVE SECOND TEAM GAMES
## 
### 
Interclass football teams are rapidly
getting under way and with today's
turnout C. E. Davis, director of inter
class activities, hopes to have all four
of the teams down to good hard prac
tice. Davis states that, if enough men
turn out, second teams will be organ
ized and a schedule arranged for the
various classes.
Two trophies will be offered this
year, for the class competition. One
of these is a silver football to be given
the class who wins the championship
in the interclass games. The other
silver trophy will go to the class hav
ing the highest athletic standing at
the end of the year, the football ac
tivities counting towards this cup.
The various interclass teams have
been growing since practice started
Monday. The seniors and juniors are
well under way. Sophomore and fresh
man teams have been slow in organiz
ing, but Davis expects things to be in
full swing before the end of the week.
Equipment is being issued and medical
examinations will be made immediate
ly. Dr. Barrows states that it will be
necessary for all interclass football
men to take an examination before
they will be allowed in any scrimmage.
