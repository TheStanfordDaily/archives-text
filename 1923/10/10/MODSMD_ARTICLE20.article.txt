# DEBATING TEAM TO BE SELECTED FROM TRYOUTS OCTOBER 19
## 
### 
Tryouts for places on the Stanford
debating team, to compete in a trian
gular intercollegiate debate on Novem
ber 20 with U. S. C. and California,!
will be held October 19 at 2 p. m. In
the Little Theater under the supervi
sion of Professor J. G. Emerson, fac
ulty debating advisor.
The subject for the tryouts, which
will also be used in the final debate,
is: "Resolved, That California syndi
calism laws should be abolished."
Speeches will be five minutes in length
with three minutes allowed for re
buttal. Those who expect to try for
places on the team are requested to
see Professor Emerson by Monday in
Room 203, English building.
While all arrangements for the de
bate have not been settled as yet, it;
is expected that U. S. C. will assent to
the conditions and agree to the de-1
bate. If the southern university does'
not consent to compete, California and â– 
Stanford will hold a dual debate. How
ever, the plans upon which Professor
Emerson is working are for a triangu
lar debate. The Stanford team will
travel to Los Angeles to meet the U.
S. C. team, their negative side will go
to Berkeley, and Berkeley will argue
here. The question chosen is consid
ered of vital importance to any Cali
fornia audience and was selected for
that purpose, since the judging will be i
done entirely by ballot. No judges will!
be named, but each member of the
audience will be given a ballot when !
he enters the hall and allowed to vote I
for whichever side he considers the
winner. This is one of the first of the j
new Open Forum debates to be held j
in collegiate circles.
Former debaters as well as students
new to the field will be required to
try out before Professor Emerson. No
preliminary tryouts will be allowed.
Four men will be selected for each
team, two regulars and two alternates.
The two negative regulars will have
i an opportunity to go to Los Angeles,
i while the remainder of the squad will
| remain on the campus. Definite ar-/
' rangements concerning the final de
' bate will be announced later along
with the team selected from the try
' outs.
