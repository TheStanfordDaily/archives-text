# Organ Recital
## 
### 
"The Adobe Mission," by H. C. Near
ing, was one of the outstanding numbers
of the Tuesday organ recital given by
Warren D. Allen, University organist
at the Memorial Church.
In this excerpt from "Scenes From aj
Mexican Desert," Mr. Nearing appears
to have in mind a description not merely
of the old mission itself, but also of the
sturdy character and lofty ideals of the
pioneers who built it.
Another number was "The Caress," by
Frederic Groton of Los 'Angeles. The
composer shows his originality in the
artistic use of the canon form. The two
voices are often in exact imitation, with
out any los of grace and delicacy in the
harmony scheme.
Edward MacDowell's "In Autumn"
and "Io a Wild Rose," and two move
ments from the second sonata by Harry
B. Jepson completed the program. Mr.
Jepson is organist and professor of music
at Yale. He has written many compo
sitions for the organ, hut this sonata has
earned particular notice, being awarded
the prize offered by Eric Delmarter of
Chicago for a sonata in orchestral style.
