Dick Hyland, who has been declared
temporarily ineligible for freshman
football, is expected to be in the lineup
of the Stanford Grays next Saturday
when the Card second team meets
the Naval Hospital team. Hyland
proved himself to be a player of no
mean ability in the first freshman
game against San Diego High School
two weeks ago. Dick carries the ball
like a rugby player, runs and kicks
like one, but he is slowly adapting
himself to the American style of play
ing under the tutelage of the Cardinal
coaches.

Paul Murray did some excellent
open field running in the Nevada game
last Saturday. With Campbell, Cleave
land, and Nevers for interference he
figured strongly in the Card yardage
throughout the game. Murray at pres
ent is troubled with a sore knee, but
he is expected to be in the line-up
again Saturday against Santa Clara.

The sporting editors of many of the
San Francisco and Peninsula news
papers are commenting on the Nevers
to-Campbell pass. It is equal in calibre
to the Muller-Erb pass which Cali
fornia used to great advantage last
year, according to some of the sport
writers.
* *
Cleaveiand is also a passer on whom
Andy Kerr can rely for variety. The
pass from Cleaveiand to Campbell in
the third quarter of Saturday's game
had the stands on their feet, inasmuch
as it was declared incomplete.

Captain "Scotchy" Campbell looms up
as one of the best open field runners
on the Coast. Campbell's shiftiness in
running back punts, and in the end
runs promises to provide many sensa
tions in the games of the season.
* * *
Paddy Ryan, star freshman halfback,
should be back in the lineup within
the next two weeks. Ryan had the
misfortune to break a small bone in
his back during the game with Davis
Farm last Saturday. Ryan's absence
will be sorely felt by the freshmen
when they tackle Modesto High School
as he is one of the most dependable
ground-gainers on the squad.
* * *
The strength of the Nevada varsity,
which the Stanford eleven defeated
27-0, can be seen by the fact that the
Wolves handed Davis Farm a 41-0
beating. Davis Farm, in its turn, out
played one of the strongest freshman
teams in recent years and won, 7-6.

Followers of Stanford football are
closely watching the actions of Fred
Swan at tackle on the freshman
eleven. This former Berkeley High
School star, who played at end last
year on Bob Evans' Olympic Club
team, shows great promise for future
varsities. Fast and heavy, with plenty
of fight, this man should prove an
ideal end for "Pop" Warner to work
with next year.

Two Long Beach stars, Fred Price
and Ned Anderson, are showing up
well on Coach Hunt's first-year eleven.
Price is waging a pretty battle with
Natcher for center, while Anderson
just about has one of the guard posi
tions cinched.

The coincidence in names and meth
od of playing of Morrison, freshman
fullback, and the famous "Duke" Mor
rison of California, has often been re
marked upon. Morrison, the freshman,
seems a worthy successor to the "Iron
Duke" in that he hits the line hard
and low, and can always be depended
on for a few yards in a pinch.

Captain Ed Patterson of the base
ball varsity was around the Quad last
week-end looking over diamond pros
pects. Pat has been working all sum
mer i d will not return to school until
winter quarter.

President Wilbur has consented to
act as honorary president of the Uni
versity and Club soccer league. Wil
liam Ellery of Ellery Arms in San
Francisco will be vioe-president of
the association. Mr. Ellery has offered
the Stanford team fifteen new soccer
balls if it again wins the soccer title.
* * *
Walter Campbell and Ray Gene
reaux will fight it out for goal keeper
on the soccer varsity. Campbell seems
to have the edge at the present time,
as he played in the first game against
the Vikings last Saturday. Campbell
was freshman captain last year, and
while he did not give an extraordinary
performance Saturday he showed that
he had the makings of a good man.
Genereaux is a senior, and has had
considerable second team experience.
He played goal in the second team
game last Saturday.
