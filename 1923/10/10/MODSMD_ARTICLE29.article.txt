# Relates His History
## 
### 
According to Palomar's story, his
family came to America almost 300
years ago. In the past ages, the fam
ily originated in Egypt, migrated to
Italy, and took the name of Florence.}
They were invited to England by
Henry TI and intermarried with the
Coombes family. Palomar's father,
James Florence Coombes, came to
California in 1845 and afterwards
fought in the Mexican and Civil wars.
Coombes is 75 years of age. In his
youth, he was injured in a train wreck
near Boston, his native city, and ren
dered paralyzed. "My mother, who
was once worth a quarter of a million,
spent a lot of money on me then. All
the doctors did was to give me medi
cine until I was so full of dope that
I've been immune to everything since."
Anyway, he recovered and was again
injured in Hollywood about eight
years ago when a motorcycle ran over
him.
Injured But Still Studies
Palomar pursued his studies in Eng
land, France, Italy, and Spain, at one
time preparing for the Catholic min
istry.
About a year ago Palomar, who says
he used to be a concert singer, broad
casted a radio concert for the Aribune
from the Hotel Oakland.
Here is what Palomar thinks of Life:
'Modern man is a study. He is aj
hopeless nuisance, a specimen of de

generated intelligence, who has nearly
wrecked humanity.
"We seek to change the world
through different forms of government
such as the soviet. This action is con
trary to universal law. We must be
patient and wait for evolution.
"All emotion depends on the state
of man's health, especially his stom
ach.
"To die and go into the spirit world
is just like jumping from the frying
pan into the fire, because man makes
the spirit world a replica of this."
