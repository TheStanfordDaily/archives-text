# ANNUAL PAJAMARINO RUN IN DEAD HEAT; IS HOWLING SUCCESS
## 
### 
Puffing over the ten-mile course of
their marathon, the annual Pajama
rino was run in a dead heat last night;
no winner can be anounced. Living up
to predictions the race was a sensa
tional, hard-fought contest from start
( to finish.
Although the start was exceedingly
slow, the runners soon got under way.
As Encina was left in the distance, the
lead began to shift back and forth
among the racers. By the time the
pajamarino arrived at the end of the
first lap, the leaders were well
bunched.
After filling the ai rwith various and
sundry yells and expressed desires,
the race started off again. This time
| the stragglers of the first lap had a
I decided advantage. Arriving at Roble
just as the festivities ceased they
never faltered in their stride, but led
on, thus gaining a head-start on the
j rest.
Down the Row to the Alpha Delta
Phi house lay the second lap. The line
i never faltered nor was afraid in their
long journey. Each runner seemed in
j perfect condition, especially in the
lungs, and must have been in training
| for months. After Captain "Scotchy"
! Campbell had expressed hope for the
! Cardinal eleven, the racers got down
! in their tracks and were off again. To
j the Delta Upsilon house this time.
By the time the Delta Upsilon house
! was reached, the pace was beginning
! to tell on the inexperienced. Many
stragglers began to drop by the way.
Apples were distributed at the Delta
Upsilon house by way of awards to
the winners, and the runners returned
to their various halls.
This year's marathon proved a
"howling" success. It is hoped to ob
tain A. A. U. sanction by the time of
the next annual run.
