# WARNING GIVEN BY BARROWS AGAINST LATE REGISTRATION
## 
### 
Final warning in regard to registra
tion for physical work for students of
the lower division was made today by
Dr. W. H. Barrows, director of Encina
Gym. New rules adopted this year call
for a registration at the Gym separate
from that made at the Administration
building at the opening of the quar
ter, and all students who have not
signed up for physical work must do
so at once or a late registration fee
will be charged.
Last year students were forced to,
take the registration books to the
gymnasium before they could be en
rolled in the physical department, but
this year a new plan was adopted.
The cards were torn out at the Ad
ministration building and many stu
dents believed that this was sufficient
to enroll them in their respective j
classes at the gymnasium. However,
this was not the case, 4 and Dr. Bar-;
rows is anxious that all students who
are required to take physical work
sign up immediately.
Dr. Barrows further stated that
work will be required of all lower
division students and students of the
upper division who still have require
ments to work off according to the old
system. The upper division is not re
quired to do any physical work, it was
stated. Transfer students who are
registered in the lower division will
be required to take physical training
or military training as long as they
are registered in the lower division.;
No previous physical work will be
counted.
All new men will be given a thor
ough physical examination. Cards noti
fying those to be examined when to
appear will be sent out at a later date
by the medical advisor. At present the
member sof the varsity and freshman
football teams are being examined and
following them members of the inter-,
class teams will be given a similar
going-over. No member of any of the
interclass teams will be allowed in
scrimmages without first taking this
examination. Dr. Barrows states that
this is being done to avoid any un
necessary injuries. j
The office of the medical advisor
-is scheduled to start on military physl- j
cal examinations the last of this week.
These will follow the interclass team
examinations.

Prizes for posters stimulating interest
in fire prevention are being offered at
Mount Hoi yoke College, Massachusetts,
as a feature of Fire Prevention Week.
