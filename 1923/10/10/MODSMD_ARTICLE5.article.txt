# ROTH, DAVIS TELL PLANS FOR MORE BASKETBALL SEATS
## Butler Chosen New Dramatic Manager; Hoover Named As Vice-President 
### 
The erection of permanent bleacli
i ers or more adequate temporary
bleachers for the Basketball Pavilion
was discussed at a meeting of the
Executive Committee last night.
Definite action was postponed until
next week, in order that the commit
tee may have time to more thoroughly
investigate the j)lans presented.
Comptrollter Roth and Graduate
Manager Paul Davis presented blue
prints of the pavilion showing the de
tails of the suggested changes. Davis
favors the building of permanent
bleachers to extend from the present
: balconies down to the girders, as well
as of balconies at the ends to come
down as far as those now at the sides.
He claims that under this system the
j crowd which attends basketball games
can be seated in reserved seats sup-,
plied with adequate staircase facilities, j
Such an arrangement would reduce
I the floor space for dancing, however.;
1 Roth spoke in favor of temporary (
bleachers to, be moved in each year
before the basketball season. He feels
that in this way the space so needed
for dances and such affairs as the
University Day dinner will not be cut
down. Members of the Executive Com
mittee will gladly receive suggestions
from students on this question.
Ed Butler, '2?, was chosen as dra
matic manager for the coming year.

porary vice-president of the A. S. S. U.

election.
The point system for checking up on
student activities will again be placed
before the students in the special elec
tion to be called soon for the purpose
of electing assistant yell leaders. So
for this system nas not been put into
use because of the difficulties involved
in employing it efficiently.
