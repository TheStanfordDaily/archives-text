ple cooking, that is done
with infinite care. Wilson's ser
vice code for chefs contains the
following instructions:
Vegetables must receive the

be done while the food is being
cooked. Good seasoning brings
out the natural flavor of the
food; ordinary "Restaurant" sea
soning hides or destroys the na
tural flavor.
