Stiegeler's Made-toOrder Clothes
are Clothes of Character
FINE materials, fine workmanship, good style,
and correct fit make character clothes—and
nothing else can. Leave out any one of these
qualities and your suit will never give you the
service or satisfaction it should. You'll find some
particularly appropriate patterns here now, and
the start of the season is the logical time in which
to place your order.
.—This applies just as much to even
*ng clothes as it does to everyday
clothes. fVe are ready, are you?
