# DR. WILLIS WRITES EARTHQUAKE BOOK ON CHILEAN SHOCKS
## New Key to Temblors Found; Scientists May Forecast Future Disturbances 
### 
Professor Willis yesterday announced
the completion of a new earthquake map
of California, designed to show where
tremblors are likely to occur, which is!
intended to be of use to contractors and
builders who in the future may avoid |
placing structures where "natural dam-!
ages" are likely to be incurred.
In a few years, according to state-!
ments, it may be possible for scientists to
predict earth shocks as they now fore
cast storms and eclipses. The new map!
of California shows the fault lines of the
state along which disturbances are likely
to take place.
A "fault" is described as a rift in
rocks. It penetrates the rocks to a great j
depth where they are far more elastic
than 011 the surface, and where they are!
held in place by great tension, until, sud
denly yielding, they send vibrations
throughout the globe.
Fault Lines Known
The fault lines are known. Movements,
along them arc said to be as certain as j
thunderstorms in New York in early
summerm. The map distinguishes be
tween dead and live faults, those along
which tremors are likely, and those along
which no disturbances are expected.
Professor Willis emphasizes the need
of caution and discretion in building,
with the aid of which, he declares, a
great deal of the trouble following earth
quakes can be eliminated. The bulletin
prepared in connection with the map is j
written in plain words which a layman 1
may easily understand. By promoting
common understanding of causes and
laws now unknown to the public, Pro
fesor Willis and his associates hope to :
add much to common safety.
People along the coast of Chile, where,
severe earthquakes are an ever-present
menace, will soon have in their hands
these directions on how to build their I
homes so as to ward against future'
seismic shocks. Dr. Willis wrote the
pamphlet in Spanish, and it will he 1
printed and distributed to the Chilean
people by the Carnegie Institution, which
financed the expedition.
Following the disastrous earthquake of!
last November, which cost hundreds of
lives, Dr. Willis in response to the urgent
desire of the Chileans for the aid of an,
American expert in the science of earth-j
quakes, was sent on this mission by the'
Carnegie Institution. He was selected;
on account of his first-hand knowledge!
of the California situation, gained in a
minute survey of the earthquake rifts in;
this state, since the California and Chile!
areas have much similarity.
In regard to earthquakes in general,
Dr. Willis says: "Earthquakes are
characteristic incidents of the natural
processes which are active in Chile as
they are in California, and the records
demonstrate that we must seek safety
through practical methods, which are
fortunately entirely feasible and can be
realized at reasonable cost."
