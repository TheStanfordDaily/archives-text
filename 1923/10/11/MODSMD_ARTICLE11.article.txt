# CARDINAL RESERVE POWER S PROVED BY NEVADA TEAM
## 1923 Grid Team Has Better Backfield Substitutes; Passers Developed 
### 
Doubt regarding the strength of
Stanford's reserves has evaporated as
a result of the showing made by Card
inal substitutes against Nevada last
Saturday.
Football experts were willing to
grant that Stanford had a stronger
team than last year, but they doubted
her reserve facilities. Before the game
even Coach Andy Kerr admitted that
the substitute list was decidedly more
efficient and experienced last year,
than this.
Kerr substituted freely against Ne-:
vada, and no noticeable slowing down
of the Stanford football machine was
evident.
In the back field Solomon was sub
stituted for Nevers. Solomon was tak
en out again for Nevers in order to
buck the ball over the line with the
aid of a heavier man. When Woodward
replaced Campbell he was made field
captain in the absence of his superior.
"Bud" displayed excellent generalship
during this period, and Stanford
scored her regular touchdown. Hunt
was given a chance at center and to
all appearances the sophomore's pres
ence made no difference one way or
the other.
Since Murray Cuddeback is now
eligible for the varsity the strength
of the substitutes will be materially,
increased. Whether Cuddeback is
given a regular berth, or substituted
some time during the game, it will
always leave a capable man ready for
a backfield position. \
Fred Ludeke is a dependable man
for guard. Ludeke appeared to be
heavier and faster than ever in the
game with Nevada. Ludeke also has
experience to aid him in his fight for
a regular position.
Passers Developing
Kerr has steadily been developing a
dependable group of passers. Nevers
at present seems to hold the upper
hand, but Cleaveland is doing as well.
By using these two men alternately,
with "Scotchy" Campbell and Jim Law
son as receivers, the Cards should be
able to depend on the passing method
for much yardage.
Cuddeback is also a passer equal in
calibre to either of the aforemen
tioned players.
