# "THINK FOOTBALL" URGES MASTERS IN ASSEMBLY
## Student Body President, Captain Campbell, Yell Leader, Call Attention to Gridiron 
### 
"Let us think, talk, and breathe football, so that on November 24 there will
be a great victory for Stanford." This was the slogan urged by A1 Masters,
'23, president of Associated Students, at the student assembly today.
Emphasizing the connection between all campus activities and the Big Game,
representative speakers who followed demonstrated the utility and attractions
of their organizations.
"We want the women to act together so that we may support the major
activities of the University," said Alice Roth, '24, president of Associated
Women Students, in outlining the plan of that body.
Everyone who has ever gone here or who is on the campus now should be
doing something for Stanford, was the suggestion of "Scotchy" Campbell,
varsity football captain. "The alumni are doing their part, in getting people

>to comfi to college, and it is up to you
to do your share: You must learn the
yells and get behind your yell leader.
"You sometimes have the opportunity
to help a member of the team with his
studies. You know some of us are not
as bright as we might be, so there is a
real chance for service. If you get be
hind the team 1 can promise that you will
have a good reason to tear San Francisco
wide open on the 24th."
Eunice Biddle, '24, president of W. A.
A., said: "I hope that you are all so
well educated by this time that when you
see a little arm band with the letters
W. A. r. you will know that it stands for
Women's Athletic Association and not
for I. W. W." She explained the plan
of the national association, by which the
country is divided into sectional confer
ences. he women's pageant, which will
be the event of spring quarter, was men
tioned. The association hopes to make
the pageant a regular University affair.
"The women always have backed the
men in athletics and we are hoping for
their support in our games," concluded
Miss Biddle.
George Baker. '24, president of Men's
Council, extended a hearty welcome to
the Class of '27 on behalf of his organi
zation, but expressed the wish that he
would never have cause to meet any of
them in his official capacity.
"Tlic honor system can be successful
only by the full support of the student
body. It is not an experiment but a
tradition of Stanford. There is no place
for the deliberate cheat, or for that
student who is allied with himâ€”the one
who refuses to report the cheat. You
will probably hear various criticisms of
the council during the year, but please
remember that much of it is hearsay and
that at best it is only one side of the
story."
"I hope that today we will lay a foun
dation for good yelling and singing this
year," said Burt Lapp, '24, yell leader.
And forthwith the foundation was laid,
with the assistance of the Glee Club.
