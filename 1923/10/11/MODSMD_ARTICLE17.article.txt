# "OLD BOY" ANNOUNCES NEXT "CHAPPIE" ISSUE
## 
### 
Peering over a desk not noticeably
cluttered with copy, the Old Boy today |
paused from his labors long enough to
remark that Chaparral will make its 1
next appearance on the campus on No-j
vember 1.
What label the forthcoming issue will |
bear has not yet been decided. Accord
ing to "Mike" Ely, wieldcr of the:
hammer and the blue pencil, it will not
make a great deal of difference.
The Old Boy calls attention to the l
fact that his search for new writers and
artists never ceases. Freshmen are par
ticularly urged to try their hand at funny
stuff. Art contributions must be in by!
October 14, while the deadline for the i
literary department is October 18. Ad
dress all contributions to Box 15, Stan- 1
ford University.
