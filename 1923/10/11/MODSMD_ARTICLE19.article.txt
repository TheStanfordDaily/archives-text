# All Dogs Must Get Driver's License or Be Fed to Zoology Club
## 
### 
Uncontrolled antics of stray dogs
at Saturday's football game and the
reported presence of canines in the
Union dining hall are responsible for
the announcement from officials at
the Corporation yard that the campus
dog ordinance will be strictly en
forced this year.
Licenses are $2 each, payable at
the yard. Animals roaming the
campus without proper authority will
be turned over to the Zoology de
partment for execution.
