# ROOM FOR MORE
## 
### 
A young man dropped off the train at Palo Alto
last week, looked around him at the town, then started
hiking out to the campus. Arrived at the Quad, he
hunted up some students from his native state, walked
in on them, and said:
"Look here; I've come all the way down here to go
to college. 1 have $60 in my pocket. I want some
jobs, all the jobs 1 can find, and 1 want you to help
me find em."
The two men thus attacked looked at each other
and muttered things about rush orders. They had
batted around the campus long enough to know that
jobs of any kind are not passed out in oil paper to
those who drop a nickel in the slot. One of them
turned to the prospective student and said:
"Listenâ€”do you know what you are up against
in coming here? Have'you made any provision for
your room and food ? Did any one tell you that
you could pay your way through Stanford?"
Witness the new arrival's answer: "Say! I came
a thousand miles to go to Stanford; do you think
I'm going to let such minor considerations as self
support stop me now that I've gotten this far?"
Nothing more was necessary. Much rustling en
sued, and the jobs were forthcoming.
A man a thousand miles away had looked over
every college on the coast, and decided on Stanford.
He was independent, used to doing things his own
way, so he came. Many more of the same caliber
have come in the past; they have made Stanford fa
mous. Many more will come in the future.
There is always room for the man who knocks on
the door of the University and says: "I want some
jobs."
