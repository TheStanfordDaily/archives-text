# FREAK LAW FOR FREAKS
## 
### 
In its first meeting of the year, the Executive
Committee found itself faced with the queer child
of some officious upperclassman's brainstorm. Not
knowing what to do with the youngster, the com
mittee has decided to show it to the student body and
see what they think about it.
I he point system, which some one unfortunately
discovered on the books as an amendment to
the constitution made last year, contains the follow
ing admirable idea: it seeks to limit the amount of
student activity in which one man can participate.
To do this the amendment requires that every stu
dent register for all activities in which he is engaged,
that this information be filed on a card, and graded
by points. J hen, when a student is found to have
too many points, he will he requested to drop some
of his activities and let others step into his positions.
All very nice, as long as it stays on paper. To en
force it would mean another registration day scrim
mage, a filing case ten feet high, and two book
keepers to keep track of the constant shift of stu
dent life. Even with this corps of point counters,
it would be simple to slip one over on the authorities
and go out for debating as well as handball.
Therefore the special election announced yester
day. The students can look at the freak, and then
decide whether it resembles them closely enough to
warrant further acquaintance.
