The dope bucket has been upset all over the wall
paper in predictions on the forthcoming tilt between
Castoria and Pneumonia in their annual riddle-guessing
contest. It is understood from Coach Gluck of Castoria

Moses slept with his forefathers?" Some say one side
will win in three rounds; others place odds on the other
side.

Dear Mother: —
I am writing to you to tell you to tell Cousin Bob and
my brother to come down to Encina and see me. None
of the juniors and seniors will have anything to do with
me, and I only saw some sophomores one afternoon who
threw me into a big mud puddle. I'm having a hell of
a time at college.
Your dutiful son,
Homer Cayenne, '27.

Long ago there was a man who essayed to repair a
watch. His friend plead with him, saying: "Why re
pairest thou a watch? Thou knowest nothing of them,
having never been fortunate enough to own one." Then
said the man: Behold I have borrowed this watch,
and either will I fix it else will I fix it so that nobody else
can fix it."
MORAL: One can do his stuff whether he knows it or
not.

Homer Cayenne, '27, gives it as his opinion that the
