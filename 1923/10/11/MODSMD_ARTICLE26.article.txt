# A 						Triumph Over Handicap
## 
### 
Those who were at the Student Assembly this morning
had the rare opportunity and pleasure of seeing a man
who had every conceivable handicap, triumph—not un
conditionally, to be sure—but triumph, nevertheless.
That man was the present yell-leader.
With the atmosphere at the outset all against him,
with everyone expecting—and not a few hoping—that
he would "boob" the whole business, he arose part way
at least to the occasion, and gave us hope of a real
rooting section this year.
Never was unpopularity more acute against a yell
leader-elect than it was last June. Even those who voted
for him admittedly did so through political affiliations
or on the ground of "principle." Today, those, and
others who did their best to defeat him, are no doubt
feeling more cheerful.
How it happened, we do not all know. But the amaz
ing thing is that pure hard work, and acceptance of
valuable suggestions from other sources, has turned
what looked to be a season of ignominious failure in
singing, and yelling, into one of great promise.
There were still many things to laugh at this morn
ing—including the pianist, who did his best to embarass
the yell-leader by acting like half of a third-rate vaude<
ville team. But the snickering laughs are being replaced
by laughs tinged with good will, and in a while we may
hope to see the contemptuous laughs disappear alto
gether.
The first sign of brighter days. Support to the yell
leader can not be obtained by frenzied appeals or in
sistent propaganda. It has to come naturally.
