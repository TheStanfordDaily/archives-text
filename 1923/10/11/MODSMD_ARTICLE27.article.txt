VALUABLES
People are entering that
bank building to put
certain valuables
safely away from eager
fingers. There are
tiers and tiers of
steel boxes with locks
on them in there, for
just that purpose.
When the same people go
out on the street again,
or home, or any place—
they are robbed of other
valuables that cannot be
kept in steel boxes . . .
but only under lock and
key of the hear . . . and
wise selfishness.
LEVELER
The very estimable man
sat stiffly in the
packed street car,
edging away from a
Chinaman next him
who looked like
crumpled paper.
But the very estimable

man was tired; and
soon his head rested
in sodden sleep upon
the shoulder of the
brown paper Chinaman,
who smiled . . . most
cryptically.
