# YANKS SMASH THREE HOME RUNS; WIN, 4-2
## "Babe" Ruth, Ward, and Meusel Get Four-base Hits (Special Dispatch) 
### 
Using pure brawn and irresistible slugging power rather
than strategy, the Yankees battered out a 4 to 2 victory over
the Giants at the Polo Grounds this afternoon. Ruth emerged
from his customary World's Series obscurity by poling out
a brace of home runs, and Aaron Ward contributed to the
American League triumph with another four-base jolt.
Meusel drove one into the bleachers for the Giants.
McGraw's men were in a fielding slump, and the rejuven
ated Yankees swept them off their feet in the fourth inning,
after each side had scored once in the second. Under an

of circuit clouts the
National team sagged badly,
and committed their first two
errors of the series. The
Yanks played perfect ball
throughout.
McQuillan started on the
slab for the McGrawmen, but
was replaced by Bentley when
the home runs began to pile
up. Pennock went the route
for the Yanks.
Mound choice for tomor
row's game lies between
Jones and Shawkey for the
Yankees, and Nehf will prob
ably be McGraw's choice.
