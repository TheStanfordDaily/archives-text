# LIBRARY IS DONATED EARLY RAILROAD MAP

### 
A map showing a railroad proposed
in 1851 from San Francisco to San Jose,
which is believed to be the first engineer's
blueprint ever made for such a line, has
been placed in the Library by Professor
E. D. Adams of the History department,
as the gift of M. S. O'Shaughnessy, city
engineer of San Francisco.
O'Shaughnessy was given the map last
summer. He told Professor Adams of
his end, and offered it as a gift to the
University.
The railroad as planned here follows
the bay shore closely past what is now
South San Francisco. The construction
of tunnels was not contemplated, and
the proposed line would have taken the
same general course as the present high
way cut-off along the bay. The tunnels
now in use were not completed until
after 1906, all traffic before that time
running over the line which skirts the
hills on the side opposite the bay.
Only four "towns" are shown on the
1851 map. These are Santa Clara,
Ravenswood, "Mezes'," and San Bruno.
Mezes', located near the present site of
Redwood City, was at that time a large
ranch, owned by S. M. Mezes. His son,
Sidney E. Mezes, is now the president
of the College of the City of New Vork,
and was formerly the president of the
University of Texas.
