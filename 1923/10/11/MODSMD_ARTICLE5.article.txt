# INFLUX OF STUDENTS WANTING PART-TIME WORK IS REPORTED
## 
### 
Students knowing of opportunities for
part-time employment are asked to report
them to Mrs. Elizabeth B. Snell, appoint
ment secretary. Because the number of
students wishing to earn their board
while in college may exceed the oppor
tunities for such work, the office is anx
ious to get track of all positions for
students.
This is the first year in which there
has been a noticeable influx of men and
women from junior colleges. As a result
more upperclassmen who are strangers
here want part-time work.
The number of students desiring to
earn money for their expenses is larger
than that of last year.
The appointment office expects to fill
about 2.000 part-time positions, the total
wages earned hy that number of students
being about $40,000.
