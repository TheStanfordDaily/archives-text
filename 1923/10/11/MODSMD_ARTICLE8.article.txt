# Polo Team to Play Berkeley
## 
### 
Stanford's 1923 team will play its first
game with the Berkeley Polo club on the
j Highway field Saturday morning. The
game will be called at 10 o'clock.
The line-up for the Stanford team will
probably be as follows: 1, John Irwin;
2, Otto Barby; 3, Ralph Barby; back,
Ed Laub.
The Berkeley club is a newly organ
ized group of young men of the east bay
region. During the past summer a team
of Stanford men won two games from
the new club. Since that time the Berke
ley men have added a number of fine
polo ponies, and several experienced
players have joined.
The Berkeley club's horses arc already
ou the campus, and both teams are hard
at work in preparation for the game.
Negotiations are now under way for
a polo tournament to be held at Stan
ford some time between Thanksgiving
and the holidays.
The University of Arizona polo team
hmas stated its willingness to come for
the series of polo games, and it is defi
nitely known that a team from the Ore
gon Agricultural College will come south
in the early part of December. Captain
Boyle is now arranging to have the two
teams from Arizona and Oregon come
at the same time.
