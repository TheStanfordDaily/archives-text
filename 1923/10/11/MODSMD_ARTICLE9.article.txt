# Graduates Honor Guests At First Alumnae Tea
## 
### 
One of the largest initial resident
| alumnae teas ever held was given yester
day at the Women's Clubhouse, with
j graduate women of the University as
: guests of honor.
Several members entertained small
parties. Among the hostesses were
Mrs. Harold Heath and Mrs. E. M.
Hulme.
The association has helped materially
in the reduction of the debt on the club
| house, and made possible several im
provements in the building this summer.
! Among these was the addition of a new
gas range for the kitchen and much
i needed shelf space.
