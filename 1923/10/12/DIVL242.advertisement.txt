Hello There-
My dear, are you taking equitation, too? You look
so smart, I'm envious! I know where you bought
your riding habit—at Livingston's.
I saw another one up there that I'm going to have
—it's beautifully made and fits so zvell! Such a
clever tweed with herring bone stripes, a paddock
back zvith the latest lines, three slit pockets in the
coat and the loveliest silk serge lining with rubber
reinforcement.
The trousers are very tailored and reinforced at
the knees with broion suede. Really, it's perfectly
wonderful for \
$49.50
Other riding habits $39.50 to $98.50

One big advantage of a Stetson is that
you can give it so much wear — and
it will still keep its shape and style.
