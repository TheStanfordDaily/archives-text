# MODESTO TO SEND HEAVY, FAST TEAM AGAINST FRESHMEN
## Hyland and Ryan are Temporarily Out of Game for Babes; Line Strengthened Past Week 
### 
When the Modesto Junior College eleven trots onto the stadium turf tomor
row afternoon it will be prepared for a busy hour-and-a-lialf at the hands of
Coach "Husky" Hunt's Stanford freshman gridironers. The game, which is
scheduled to begin at 12:30, will be a preliminary to the varsity and Santa
Clara set-to.
Modesto will send a heavy, fast team against the yearlings. Last Saturday
the Junior College squad administered a top-heavy defeat to the Sacramento
Junior College. Gerkin, who gained much fame as a high school shot-putter
second only to "Bud" Houser, is probably the star of the team, and will be
seen in action at one of the guard positions.

Hyland, Ryan, Out of Game
Without Dick Hyland, "\vlio is tem
porarily ineligible, and "Horsey" Ryan,
who broke a small bone in his back in
the Davis Aggie game, Coach Hunt
will be minus two of his steadiest
back-field stars. However, good men
are not lacking to fill their places. At
right half, either Garthwaite or Trom
betta will probably start, while Phil
lips should handle the left half posi
tion. Moore at fullback, and Badwin at
quarter, will complete the quartet.
The only change in the line will be
Adams at end for Sliipkey. Shipkey
had the misfortune to sprain an ankle
last Saturday, but should get into the
game again within a week. Although
the line played raggedly against Davis
Farm, a week's practice should have
eliminated this. Line Coach Post has
been working his men hard all week
and expects an entirely rejuvenated
wall to go into action tomorrow.
