# ADOPTION OF ESPERANTO IS URGED BY AUTHORITY
## 
### 
"Esperanto should be adopted as
the universal language and I would
like to see an Esperanto club started
at Stanford," said Miss Anita Deßonis,
who visited the campus recently on
a tour of the various institutions of
j learning in the West.
"I hate English and think it is not
! only the most difficult language in
the world to learn but the most hor
rible language known to me. I have
seen so many foreigners struggling
with it that I can sympathize with
them. I would encourage everyone to
take up the study of Esperanto since
i it can bo spoken by all nationalities
alike. As the rules of grammar of this
system can bo placed on the back of a
post-card. All nouns end in "o," verbs
in "a," and adjectives In "e," making
the declensions and conjugations easy
to learn.
Is New Language
"Esperanto is one of the newest of
the International languages. There are
eleven others, I think.

'If other people could see how the
knowledge of Esperanto aids foreign
ers in making themselves understood
they would study it. If they could see
how mapy times judges have been
saved time in making their decisions
known to foreigners through the use
of Esperanto they would adopt it as
their own language.
Has Valuable Usage
'I always carry my little book with
me and when I have a spare moment
or two I learn a few words or read
a few paragraphs. Stanford students,
especially those who intend to travel
in foreign countries, would find the use
of Esperanto valuable."
Miss Deßonis has traveled exten
sively and says that she would be lost
without the ability to understand in
her meager way the Esperanto code.
She was borne in Melbourne, Austra
lia, and came to the United States at
an early age, settling with her parents
in Oakland.
