# CARDS, MIONITES MIX TOMORROW
## SANTA CLARA WILL TRY TO COME BACK AFTER POOR START Kerr's Men Will Be Almost at Full Strength, and Should Register Decisively Over Catholics 
### David Meiklejohn, '26 
Cardinal supporters have reason to believe that the Stanford football varsity
will hand Santa Clara a most decisive walloping when the two teams clash
in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
Santa Clara in its early season games last year was rated as a weak squad,
but it held the Cards to one score. The most evident weaknesses in tho
Santa Clara-California contest last week were the failure of the Mission ends
to get down under punts, and the bungles made by the backs at critical
moments. The squad has concentrated on these defects, and the Saints will
make a strong effort to come back.

£ Saints Need Good Ends
£oach Eddie Keinholz will need a
stronger pair of ends if Santa Clara
hopes to stop end runs by Cleaveland
and Campbell, behind the newly de
veloped and more efficient Stanford
interference. Don Nichols of California
made a sensational 70-yard run around
the Saint ends. The run might
have been brilliant, but at the same
time it emphasized a staggering fault
somewhere in the Santa Clara line-up.
Fumbling presented the Bruins with
touchdowns on three different occa
sions.
Then turn to the practice scrimmage
between Santa Clara and the Naval
Hospital team. The Saints were for
tunate in whipping the Sailors 13 to 6,
while Stanford rolled up an 84 to 0
score against the same competition.
Comparative scores are interesting,
though they mean little.
Cards Have Stronger Team
Whereupon Stanford rooters can sit
back and howl to their hearts' content
in the assurance that they will be
represented by a stronger football ma
chine than has previously been the
case.
"Scotchy" Campbell will be watched
■ with interest. If Don Nichols can out
run the Saint ends for 70 yards, then
"Scotchy" is likely to make it 80c
Rarely has a quarter-back been de
pended upon to carry the ball. Even
the great Erb, of California, was used
only for purposes of generalship.
Campbell has proved that he can do
! more than use his head and direct ten
i men. He shares with the other back
j field men the responsibility of taking
j the ball when occasion demands it,
besides being a demon pass snagger.
Paul Murray will probably not be
used in the line-up tomorrow unless it
become* necessary. Kerr plans to play
Woodward at the half-back position,
and later in the game switch Campbell
to half, using Mitchell to call signals.
This move is by no means a certain
one, however, and the regular back
field may continue throughout the
game.
The optimistic view Is the most ex
hilarating. but one must also consider
the pessimistic angle.
Saturday's game against Nevada
was not altogether faultless exhibition
of football. Stanford took advantage
of all the breaks; that much is to her
credit because it is a good team that
can make its own breaks. But a team
cannot always depend on the breaks
to win.
The interference, while strong, was
not perfect. Several times a Nevada
end downed a Card runner in his
tracks behind the line.
Fumbles nearly cost the Cards two
touchdowns; such would have been the
case had it not been for the two
blocked kicks following the bobbles.
Returning to the optimistic, it is
somewhat of a thrill to watch a Stan
ford team which is not a "ten-minute"
scorer. A touchdown in every quarter
of the Nevada game might provide
food for pleasant thought. For an
eleven which can score once on
straight football will score often. It is
a team which can afford to take
chances on the open game, watching
for, and making her own breaks.

Saturday's game against Nevada
was not altogether faultless exhibition
of football. Stanford took advantage
of all the breaks; that much is to her
credit because it is a good team that
can make its own breaks. But a team
cannot always depend on the breaks
to win.
The interference, while strong, was
not perfect. Several times a Nevada
end downed a Card runner in his
tracks behind the line.
Fumbles nearly cost the Cards two
touchdowns; such would have been the
case had it not been for the two
blocked kicks following the bobbles.
Returning to the optimistic, it is
somewhat of a thrill to watch a Stan
ford team which is not a "ten-minute"
scorer. A touchdown in every quarter
of the Nevada game might provide
food for pleasant thought. For an
eleven which can score once on
straight football will score often. It is
a team which can afford to take
chances on the open game, watching
for, and making her own breaks.

orously and soon a smouldering bonfire
disposed of the last of the leaves. Re
freshments consisting of wieners, buns,

Cardinal supporters have reason to believe that the Stanford football varsity
will hand Santa Clara a most decisive walloping when the two teams clash
in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
Santa Clara in its early season games last year was rated as a weak squad,
but it held the Cards to one score. The most evident weaknesses in tho
Santa Clara-California contest last week were the failure of the Mission ends
to get down under punts, and the bungles made by the backs at critical
moments. The squad has concentrated on these defects, and the Saints will
make a strong effort to come back.

£ Saints Need Good Ends
£oach Eddie Keinholz will need a
stronger pair of ends if Santa Clara
hopes to stop end runs by Cleaveland
and Campbell, behind the newly de
veloped and more efficient Stanford
interference. Don Nichols of California
made a sensational 70-yard run around
the Saint ends. The run might
have been brilliant, but at the same
time it emphasized a staggering fault
somewhere in the Santa Clara line-up.
Fumbling presented the Bruins with
touchdowns on three different occa

scorer. A touchdown in every quarter
of the Nevada game might provide
food for pleasant thought. For an
eleven which can score once on
straight football will score often. It is
a team which can afford to take
chances on the open game, watching
for, and making her own breaks.

SALEM. Ore. —Freshmen at Willam
ette University upheld another tradi
tion and "cleaned up" the campus in
the early morning hours when they
participated in the annual "lawn
party." Each rook wielded a rake vig
orously and soon a smouldering bonfire
disposed of the last of the leaves. Re
freshments consisting of wieners, buns,
coffee, and doughnuts were the re
wards for the vicarious labor.
