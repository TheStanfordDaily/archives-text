# CARDS, MIONITES MIX TOMORROW
## SANTA CLARA WILL TRY TO COME BACK AFTER POOR START Kerr's Men Will Be Almost at Full Strength, and Should Register Decisively Over Catholics 
### David Meiklejohn, '26 
Cardinal supporters have reason to believe that the Stanford football varsity
will hand Santa Clara a most decisive walloping when the two teams clash
in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.
Santa Clara in its early season games last year was rated as a weak squad,
but it held the Cards to one score. The most evident weaknesses in tho
Santa Clara-California contest last week were the failure of the Mission ends
to get down under punts, and the bungles made by the backs at critical
moments. The squad has concentrated on these defects, and the Saints will
make a strong effort to come back.

£ Saints Need Good Ends
£oach Eddie Keinholz will need a
stronger pair of ends if Santa Clara
hopes to stop end runs by Cleaveland
and Campbell, behind the newly de
veloped and more efficient Stanford
interference. Don Nichols of California
made a sensational 70-yard run around
the Saint ends. The run might
have been brilliant, but at the same
time it emphasized a staggering fault
somewhere in the Santa Clara line-up.
Fumbling presented the Bruins with
touchdowns on three different occa
sions.
Then turn to the practice scrimmage
between Santa Clara and the Naval
Hospital team. The Saints were for
tunate in whipping the Sailors 13 to 6,
while Stanford rolled up an 84 to 0
score against the same competition.
Comparative scores are interesting,
though they mean little.
Cards Have Stronger Team
Whereupon Stanford rooters can sit
back and howl to their hearts' content
in the assurance that they will be
represented by a stronger football ma
chine than has previously been the
case.
"Scotchy" Campbell will be watched
■ with interest. If Don Nichols can out
run the Saint ends for 70 yards, then
"Scotchy" is likely to make it 80c
Rarely has a quarter-back been de
pended upon to carry the ball. Even
the great Erb, of California, was used
only for purposes of generalship.
Campbell has proved that he can do
! more than use his head and direct ten
i men. He shares with the other back
j field men the responsibility of taking
j the ball when occasion demands it,
besides being a demon pass snagger.
