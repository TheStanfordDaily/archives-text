# STANFORD AND SONS OF ST. GEORGE TO CLASH IN SOCCER
## Second Eleven Encounters Russian Athletic Club at San Francisco 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccerites meet
the Sons of St. George, from San Ma
teo, in the second game of the year,
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 on the
soccer field. This game is a regular
scheduled contest in the University
and Club Soccer league, first division.
In the second division of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer league, the
second Stanford varsity will meet the
Russian Athletic Club of San Fran
cisco in the stadium at Golden Gate
Park at 2:30.
The varsity has more than an even
chance of winning its game, according
to Coach Maloney. The team has been
practicing all week and most of the
faults discovered in last Saturday's
game have been corrected. The Sons
of St. George are not considered to be :
as strong as the Vikings, who defeated â– 
Stanford last week.
The tentative line-up, as announced
yesterday, is: Campbell, goal; Howe'
and Clark, fullbacks; Swayne, center;
half; Pollard left half; Buckley, right
half; Hoover, outside right; Cardosa,
inside right; Munford, center forward;
Quigley, inside right; and Richardson,
outside right.
The second team line-up will not be
selected until after practice today. No
freshman will be given a place on it,
however, since Maloney has not had
the new men practicing long enough
to secure a line on the best .players.
