# STANFORD DEVELOPS HER OWN ATHLETES
## 
### 
Look at the Stanford football team of today. Read
over the names line, backfield, and reserves. \ou
will find the same players there, in the front rank,
who were parked by the water bucket last fall. Hie
same men who were "not quite good enough last
year will be in the press dispatches tomorrow.
Answer: Andy Kerr, the newest Cardinal coach,
has taken hold of an old system. In the past Stan
ford has always developed her own athletes, brought
out unknowns and trained them, watched over them,
and driven them, until one day they broke a record.
Who ever heard of Morris Kirksey before he wore
the Cardinal? Or "Dud" DeGroot? Or "Dink
Tempi eton ?
The bench-warmers of last year have advanced
one grade in the Stanford school of football, and
are now ready to take their place with the stellar
lights of other elevens.
This always has been, and always will be. Stan
ford's chief reliance â€”the development of her own
athletic power by her own coaches.
