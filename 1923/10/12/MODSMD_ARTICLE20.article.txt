### 
Stanford enters its second game tomorrow. 1 lie
Cardinal goes out on the field tested, confident, sure
of its ability. There is no cock-sureness, no toast
ing, only calm realization by players and rooters
that the team will play the best football it knows
liovv, and that that brand of football is better than
any brand they ever knew before. The team is sure
■of making a good showing. It is also sure of not
making as good a point showing as did California
against the same Santa Clara eleven. Nobody wants
to, Andy Kerr does not expect to, and he has told
his men not to try for it. The Stanford team of
1923 is still developing, still filling in the chinks
and putting on the plaster. Until such time as the
Red faces a real foe, orders will he to fight under
wraps, and.conserve energy for the development of
mechanical perfection.
But Stanford expects to score often, to win by a
healthy margin, and to justify again the statement
made in the stands last week: "This is the best
Stanford varsity I ever saw!"
