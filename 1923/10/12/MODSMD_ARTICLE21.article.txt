# FORENSIC IDEALISM
## 
### 
Intercollegiate debaters have taken a long step
forward. Even the most religious of the world court
advocates might well stammer slightly before advo
cating the plan advanced bv oratorical idealists.
The intercollegiate debate committee has an
nounced that in the future decisions on intercolle
giate debates will be made by ballot of the audience
at the college where the debate is held.
This move is a true recognition of the integrity
and honor of the college student, and shows faith
that University men in judging the merits of rival
orators are no longer swayed by petty considerations
of "college spirit"â€”unless it is to be inferred that
not enough of the real student Ixhlv attends an inter
collegiate debate to make any appreciable difference
in the vote.
