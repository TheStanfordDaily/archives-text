Cabbages announces as our first novel:
A ROMAN IN THE GLOAMIN'
A Parable in Two Pairs and a Wild Queen
In a far-away land with a terrible climate there once
dwelt a band so dog-gone sublime it never would mingle
with anyone else except for the jingle of money or pelf.
I3y Gee was a maiden who dwelt there; her girlish
emotions she felt there; she wanted to beat it—would
often repeat it —her Pa had spanked her with a belt
there.
She worshipped a fellow named Heck, who lived in a
trans-ocean neck of the woods —he was foreign, a mark
for abhorrin', but little of that did she reck. She went
away, and she said she'd stay 'til he she was dragged
back home by Heck. Check!
To Heck she said "I love you, and by the stars above
you, right on your face I'll shove you if you don't marry
me." Said Heck: "There's a smudge on your nose and
something is wrong with your clothes; oh, zookers, a
hole in your hose —you don't look good to me."
"Now but this is an horrible thing, Gad wot," whim
pered Gee, and straightway she went off and shot herself
—do you think this is all. —it is not!
Part the Two
The news of this calamity came back to By Gee's
home, upsetting equinamity within each native dome.
"He's proud," said they, "this fellow Heck —he let Gee
have it in the neck; let's start a war and neatly wreck
the life of this coxcomb."
Introducing a girl called By Gosh: when her relatives
told her this tosh concerning By Gee and the corpse that
was she, she stuttered 'Oh, B-B-B-Bosh! That woman
don't know her stuff —she deserved to be treated rough
—give me a chance; I'll lead him a dance and marry
him fast enough. I'll bring him here when I marry him;
as soon as you wish you can bury him."
And while the populace madly cheered, By Gosh ef
fectively disappeared; object—a wedding and then a be
heading, so over the ocean she steered.
She tracked Mister Heck to his lair and designingly
sneered at him there —her efforts to bait him and force
him to bite just seemed to elate him and didn't work
right. Finally she said: "I hate you, Heck —you're just a
sloppy, illiterate wreck —don't ask me to marry, I'm leav
ing you flat." "Pray do," cursed Heck, and there was
that.
A watery "splosh" disposed of Gosh.
Strike Three
By Gee and By Gosh were dead and Heck was still far
ahead; the people were sore and vindictive (what's
more) and inclined to see pretty red. Can't you see
their point of view? This man had scorned two of their
best, and since he had slickered those two it looked
kind of bad for the rest.
Now we come to a girl called By Gum who was all for
the Good of the People; she was really stupendously
dumb, but she cried from the nearest church steeple:
"I'll save your honor!" They depended upon her.
"I'll marry this man By Heck or forfeit my swan-like
neck; I'll save our face and erase this disgrace; I'll
bring him back to you—check!
She crossed the sea and she laid a plan to subtly snag
and trap this man; wings of a butterfly, soul of a moth,
frenzied activity, languorous sloth; she fooled him and
schooled him in ways of her sex, and led him and bled
him in ways that would vex.
"By Gum," said he soon, "you're chasing the moon —I
know that you want me, but grant me this boon; please
let me be; I'm bored to death —see?"
A knife made By Gum promptly succumb.
Four
"Oh, horrid day—we've three away," mourned all the
folks back home, "We've watched them go and felt
quite low to see those maidens roam. Vengeance we'll
have; there's no other salve."
The next little girl is By Juv, who was known by the
people who'd met her as a sweet irresistible dove; they
were sure he'd be crazy to get her.
"Now prithee, By Juv, depart —attach this man to your
heart —as soon as you snare him we'll straightway pre
pare him for a funeral trip in a cart."
By Juv was neither bad nor bold and tried to do as
she was told —"I'll get him," she said, "if I can, but he
seems a most diffident man; I'll appeal to his strength
and go any length to make him submit to your plan."
She went to the island and cooed, though he was con
sistently rude; her blank baby stare and her corncolored
hair got lots of applause 'til she opened her jaws, but her
speech became her ruin—there was clearly nothing
doin'.
'Don't coo at me, you blighter," said Heck; so Juv
went out and chopped off 'er neck; he scorned her —all
mourned her.

hole in your hose —you don't look good to me."
"Now but this is an horrible thing, Gad wot," whim
pered Gee, and straightway she went off and shot herself
—do you think this is all. —it is not!
Part the Two
The news of this calamity came back to By Gee's
home, upsetting equinamity within each native dome.
"He's proud," said they, "this fellow Heck —he let Gee
have it in the neck; let's start a war and neatly wreck
the life of this coxcomb."
Introducing a girl called By Gosh: when her relatives
told her this tosh concerning By Gee and the corpse that
was she, she stuttered 'Oh, B-B-B-Bosh! That woman
don't know her stuff —she deserved to be treated rough
—give me a chance; I'll lead him a dance and marry
him fast enough. I'll bring him here when I marry him;
as soon as you wish you can bury him."
And while the populace madly cheered, By Gosh ef
fectively disappeared; object—a wedding and then a be
heading, so over the ocean she steered.
She tracked Mister Heck to his lair and designingly
sneered at him there —her efforts to bait him and force
him to bite just seemed to elate him and didn't work
right. Finally she said: "I hate you, Heck —you're just a
sloppy, illiterate wreck —don't ask me to marry, I'm leav
ing you flat." "Pray do," cursed Heck, and there was
that.
A watery "splosh" disposed of Gosh.
Strike Three
By Gee and By Gosh were dead and Heck was still far
ahead; the people were sore and vindictive (what's
more) and inclined to see pretty red. Can't you see
their point of view? This man had scorned two of their
best, and since he had slickered those two it looked
kind of bad for the rest.
Now we come to a girl called By Gum who was all for
the Good of the People; she was really stupendously
dumb, but she cried from the nearest church steeple:
"I'll save your honor!" They depended upon her.
"I'll marry this man By Heck or forfeit my swan-like
neck; I'll save our face and erase this disgrace; I'll
bring him back to you—check!
She crossed the sea and she laid a plan to subtly snag
and trap this man; wings of a butterfly, soul of a moth,
frenzied activity, languorous sloth; she fooled him and
schooled him in ways of her sex, and led him and bled
him in ways that would vex.
"By Gum," said he soon, "you're chasing the moon —I
know that you want me, but grant me this boon; please
let me be; I'm bored to death —see?"
A knife made By Gum promptly succumb.
Four
"Oh, horrid day—we've three away," mourned all the
folks back home, "We've watched them go and felt
quite low to see those maidens roam. Vengeance we'll
have; there's no other salve."
The next little girl is By Juv, who was known by the
people who'd met her as a sweet irresistible dove; they
were sure he'd be crazy to get her.
"Now prithee, By Juv, depart —attach this man to your
heart —as soon as you snare him we'll straightway pre
pare him for a funeral trip in a cart."
By Juv was neither bad nor bold and tried to do as
she was told —"I'll get him," she said, "if I can, but he
seems a most diffident man; I'll appeal to his strength
and go any length to make him submit to your plan."
She went to the island and cooed, though he was con
sistently rude; her blank baby stare and her corncolored
hair got lots of applause 'til she opened her jaws, but her
speech became her ruin—there was clearly nothing
doin'.
'Don't coo at me, you blighter," said Heck; so Juv
went out and chopped off 'er neck; he scorned her —all
mourned her.

A Parable in Two Pairs and a Wild Queen
In a far-away land with a terrible climate there once

And while the populace madly cheered, By Gosh ef
fectively disappeared; object—a wedding and then a be
heading, so over the ocean she steered.
She tracked Mister Heck to his lair and designingly
sneered at him there —her efforts to bait him and force
him to bite just seemed to elate him and didn't work
right. Finally she said: "I hate you, Heck —you're just a
sloppy, illiterate wreck —don't ask me to marry, I'm leav
ing you flat." "Pray do," cursed Heck, and there was
that.
A watery "splosh" disposed of Gosh.
Strike Three
By Gee and By Gosh were dead and Heck was still far
ahead; the people were sore and vindictive (what's
more) and inclined to see pretty red. Can't you see
their point of view? This man had scorned two of their
best, and since he had slickered those two it looked
kind of bad for the rest.
Now we come to a girl called By Gum who was all for
the Good of the People; she was really stupendously
dumb, but she cried from the nearest church steeple:
"I'll save your honor!" They depended upon her.
"I'll marry this man By Heck or forfeit my swan-like
neck; I'll save our face and erase this disgrace; I'll
bring him back to you—check!
She crossed the sea and she laid a plan to subtly snag
and trap this man; wings of a butterfly, soul of a moth,
frenzied activity, languorous sloth; she fooled him and
schooled him in ways of her sex, and led him and bled
him in ways that would vex.
"By Gum," said he soon, "you're chasing the moon —I
know that you want me, but grant me this boon; please
let me be; I'm bored to death —see?"
A knife made By Gum promptly succumb.
Four
"Oh, horrid day—we've three away," mourned all the
folks back home, "We've watched them go and felt
quite low to see those maidens roam. Vengeance we'll
have; there's no other salve."
The next little girl is By Juv, who was known by the
people who'd met her as a sweet irresistible dove; they
were sure he'd be crazy to get her.
"Now prithee, By Juv, depart —attach this man to your
heart —as soon as you snare him we'll straightway pre
pare him for a funeral trip in a cart."
By Juv was neither bad nor bold and tried to do as
she was told —"I'll get him," she said, "if I can, but he
seems a most diffident man; I'll appeal to his strength
and go any length to make him submit to your plan."
She went to the island and cooed, though he was con
sistently rude; her blank baby stare and her corncolored
hair got lots of applause 'til she opened her jaws, but her
speech became her ruin—there was clearly nothing
doin'.
'Don't coo at me, you blighter," said Heck; so Juv
went out and chopped off 'er neck; he scorned her —all
mourned her.

A ROMAN IN THE GLOAMIN'
A Parable in Two Pairs and a Wild Queen
In a far-away land with a terrible climate there once
dwelt a band so dog-gone sublime it never would mingle
with anyone else except for the jingle of money or pelf.
I3y Gee was a maiden who dwelt there; her girlish
emotions she felt there; she wanted to beat it—would
often repeat it —her Pa had spanked her with a belt
there.
She worshipped a fellow named Heck, who lived in a
trans-ocean neck of the woods —he was foreign, a mark
for abhorrin', but little of that did she reck. She went
away, and she said she'd stay 'til he she was dragged
back home by Heck. Check!
To Heck she said "I love you, and by the stars above
you, right on your face I'll shove you if you don't marry
me." Said Heck: "There's a smudge on your nose and
something is wrong with your clothes; oh, zookers, a
hole in your hose —you don't look good to me."
"Now but this is an horrible thing, Gad wot," whim
pered Gee, and straightway she went off and shot herself
—do you think this is all. —it is not!
Part the Two
The news of this calamity came back to By Gee's
home, upsetting equinamity within each native dome.
"He's proud," said they, "this fellow Heck —he let Gee
have it in the neck; let's start a war and neatly wreck
the life of this coxcomb."
Introducing a girl called By Gosh: when her relatives
told her this tosh concerning By Gee and the corpse that
was she, she stuttered 'Oh, B-B-B-Bosh! That woman
don't know her stuff —she deserved to be treated rough
—give me a chance; I'll lead him a dance and marry
him fast enough. I'll bring him here when I marry him;
as soon as you wish you can bury him."
