SCIENCE
They sat around the banquet
table, these great men of
science did; and the dull
monotone of their talk was
the echo of the whirring
mechanisms in many acrid
laboratories. Cigars lit,
one scientist arose and
read a paper entitled:
The Law of Gravitation In
Everyday Life. And everyone
was very grave and impressed.
Just then a waiter slipped on
the sleek floor and went down
in a hail of dishes. The
great scientists looked at
him resentfully, and sucked
at their cigars.
