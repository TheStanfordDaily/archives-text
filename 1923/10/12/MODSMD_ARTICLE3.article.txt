# INTERCLASS TEAMS MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR GRIDIRON GAMES
## Coaches Whipping Elevens Into Shape; Seniors Have Heavy Line 
### 
The 1923 interclass football cham
pionship bids fair to be the hottest
contested struggle in several years.
Approximately fifty men were out for
practice yesterday, and by Monday it
is expected that there will be enough
to organize a first and second team
for each of the four classes. Coaches
for the sophomore, junior, and senior
teams have been secured and they
are giving their respective squads pre
liminary training in preparation for
heavier work next week.
The seniors so far have had the
largest turnouts. Coach Russ Jarvis
had his men hard at work yesterday
on kicking, passing, and line work.
Dick Fullerton is helping with the
line which will average around 190
pounds.
C. E. Davis, who has charge of the
interclass activities, is planning to ar
range a second team schedule so that
all men who go out for interclass foot
ball may have a chance to play. Davis
states there are plenty of uniforms to
fully equip two teams from each of
the clafeses.
The 1925 class looks as if it were
out for business. The junior line will
range in the neighborhood of 170
pounds. Virgil Cheek, a four-year var
sity man from Missouri Normal at
Springfield, is coaching the third year
men. Coach Cheek expects to hate his
men lined up in their permanent posi
tions in a few days.
The sophomore line-up is whipping
into shape under Coach Everett Young
who was a member of the freshman
squad last year and who has been
working with the Grays during the
present season, is giving the '26 men
hard work and hopes to have them
ready for scrimmages next week.
The first game of the interclass
schedule will be played two weeks
from tomorrow.
A new plan will be used this year
for playing off the class games. Here
tofore, the winner of the junior-senior
game has played the winner of the
freshman-sophomore struggle. This
year the "round robin" plan will be
Each team will play the other
three classes, and the class having the
highest percentage will be declared
champion.
