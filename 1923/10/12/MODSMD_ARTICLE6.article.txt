(Special Dispatch)
The Stengel-Home Run series
now being staged in Gotham took
another Giant somersault this af
ternoon, when the ancient "Casey"
four-bagged in the seventh for the
only run of the game.
Jones, on the hill for the Hugmen,
twirled a tight game save for the
man-sized blow by Stengel, and was
retired in the eighth to make room
for a pinch-hitter. Nehf fanned
Ruth twice and walked him on his
two other appearances, for which
he was roundly booed. "Wally"
Pipp sprained his ankle, and was
replaced at first by Ruth.
Aaron Ward, last man up for the
Yankees, was fanned out on a
called strike. Muggins and other
Yankee adherents rushed onto the
diamond, and the day ended in a
small-sized riot.
