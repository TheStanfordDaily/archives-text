# BABES PICK CAPTAINS FOR SWIMMING, POLO
## 
### 
Art Stewart was elected captain of
freshman water polo and Jim Handley
was made captain of the 1927 swim
mers yesterday afternoon by aspirants
for places on these teams. Stewart
hails from Pasadena and Handley is
from San Francisco.
Stewart played water polo for two
years on the Pasadena High School
team. Handley attended prep school
at Lowell High, where he swam the
breast stroke. He won this event two
different years in the San Francisco
Athletic League meet.
Jim Carson, who transferred from
California this year has decided to
cast his lot with the Olympic Club,
rather than with the Stanford water
polo men. Carson is not eligible for
intercollegiate games, but was expect
ed to aid Stanford in outside contests.
"Ginny" Austin, star Card swimmer
and water polo player for the past
three years, will also be a member of
the Olympic Club team. With such
men as Austin and Carson in their
line-up, the Olympic Club will un
doubtedly be one of the Cards' hardest
opponents this year.
A practice water polo game was
played yesterday afternoon. One line
up was largely freshmen, while the
other was composed of varsity and
freshman swimmers of last year. For
1927, Stewart and Williams did some
good work. McCallister, Meyers, and
Collett were the only veterans in the
varsity line-up.
The first event of the year for the
water polo players will probably be
an open tournament in Encina pool,
starting December 4. Probable entries,
besides Stanford, will be the San
Diego Rowing Club, the Multnomah
Athletic Club of Portland, Ore., the
Olympic Club, California, Neptunes,
and Pacific City. Gold, silver, and
bronze water polo balls will be pre
sented to the winning teams.
