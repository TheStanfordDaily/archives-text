# "Androcles and the Lion" Cast to Hold Initial Rehearsal
## 
### 
"Androcles and the Lion" will have j
its first rehearsal tomorrow morning 1
in the Assembly hall in the nature of j
a final tryout. Possible candidates will :
be tried in the few undecided parts as I
the play is read through and those
who show the most promise will be '
selected. The cast will be announced
Monday.
So many have turned out for the !
play that tryouts have extended over ;
a longer period than is usual and it
has made the selection of characters
a difficult task, says Coach Davis. The \
nature of the piece makes it neces- \
sary for the principals to have a cer- j
tain bit of natural finish in order to !
get over Shaw's brand of humor and
it is on this that Davis will work
tomorrow.
Most of the parts have already been
cast where the ability of "the actor
and his past experience have shown
that he is the only man for the place.
In looking over the casting in its
present unfinished form, one finds it
filled with names well known to cam- ;
pus dramatics, and a study of the
parts should convince anyone that
the comedy farce will not be a fizzle.
The part of the Lion, the real come
dian of the show, could be filled by
only one person. His humorous char
acterizations should be familiar to
everyone on the "Farm." Likewise,
the part of Androcles will be taken
by a comedy artist of no mean repute.
Those who are to report tomorrow
morning will be notified by telephone.
