# BUSTER KEATON STEALS [illegible] OF 'ANDROCLES'
## Film Comedian s Three Ages' Uses Shaw's Gags' and Sets, Costumes of Roman Period 
### James Muir, '25 
In filming his "Three Ages," Buster
Keaton seems to have stolen some of his
ideas for the Roman Age from G. 13.
Shaw's "Androcles and the Lion." The
similarity in costumes, scenes, action, and
the "gags" is at once apparent to one who
knows both plays, says Coach Davis.
Those who enjoyed the Keaton comedy
should therefore appreciate even more
seeing the original, as it will be produced
on the Assembly hall stake November 2.
The closest connection between the two
shows is the use that both make of the
Lion. In fact, the relationship in this
case will probably be so close that it
will be the same Lion. That is, the lion's
skin will probably be the same, for Davis
has been wiring Los Angeles costumers
and has made arrangements whereby he
can get the Keaton lion.
Costumes worn in "Three Ages" will
also be used by the Sword and Sandals
actors. Among these are some suits of
armour newly arrived from Germany,
They are made of beaten brass and when
seen in the stage light will look like
beaten gold. Other costumes for gladi
ators Christians, Roman senators and
members of Caesar's court have been
procured and will go to make the play
an elaborate costume spectacle, according
to Davis. He is quite pleased at being
able to get them from the company that
supplied Buster Keaton.
Students in Director Davis' Theater
Workshop class are engaged in studying
the Roman period at the time of the
Christian persecution, so that the settings
for "Androcles" will be archaeologically
correct and the costumes worn according
to the fashions then in vogue, Davis in
tends that the play shall register with
those who come to see a show correctly
staged as well as those who only want to
enjoy the Shavian humor. An expert in
the costuming of campus productions has
been engaged to help Davis.
Rehearsals begin tonight at 7 o'clock
in the Assembly hall. One or two parts
in the cast have not been definitely se
lected yet, but this will be done at to
night's rehearsal, and the complete cast
will be announced tomorrow.
