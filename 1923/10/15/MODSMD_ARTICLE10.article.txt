### 
(Special Dispatch!
Putting up an irresistible come
back and taking advantage of sev
eral Giant mis-cues, the New
York Yankees won the sixth
game and with it the World's
Series today. The Yanks entered
the eighth frame with the score
4 to 1 against them, the single
tally being the result of Ruth's
third home run of the series. In
the eighth, three singles, two
bases on balls, and a wild throw,
chased five runs across the plat
ter —enough to win the game.
Nehf, pitching for the McGraw
men, was knocked out of the
game in the uproarious eighth.
Penock hurled a fairly steady
steady game for the Yankees un
til he was taken out to make way
for a pinch hitter. He was re
placed by Jones.
Ruth fanned in the eighth with
the bases full. The game was
comparatively free of home runs,
Snyder and Ruth being the only
offenders. 'Casey" Stengel did not
appear in the line-up until the last
of the eighth, when he batted for
Cunningham and sent a long fly
to Dugan.
