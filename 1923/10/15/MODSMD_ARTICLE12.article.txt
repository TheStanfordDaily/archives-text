# VARSITY SWAMPS MISSIONITE TEAM UNDER 55-6 SCORE
## CASANOVA RUNS FUMBLE 80 YARDS FOR TALLY Kerr's Second and Third Squad Men Play Large Part of Contest; Cards Improve in all Departments but Tackling 
### William Wright, '25 
Nearly two score of Andy Kerr's vigorous footballers reduced the Santa
Clara Missionites to the same stage of dilapidation as the mission Saturday
afternoon, tramping on the Catholics to the extent of 55 to 6. The Cards
won their game more through enthusiasm and seeming instinctive knowledge
of ground-gaining than flawless and polished football form. Fumbles were
frequent, but only one turned out to be costly—and Casanova carried that
one across the Stanford line for the only Santa Clara thrill of the game.
Kerr seemingly consulted a bawlout and picked substitutes at random, but
still the ball went through. The second and third squads displayed a brand
of tackling slightly weaker than the head-liners, but Santa Clara was always
stopped without damage, except for a single first down in the third period,
against the third team almost impact. For this yardage they completed the
only pass, a 6-yard toss from Bundy to Rianda. The Cards made their yardage
23 times, fairly well divided among the four quarters.
Stanford made the expected improvement over last week, except in the way
of fumbling. Nine of these bobbles are a trifle too many for any team to
permit itself, and against a stronger team would have Droved vastlv serious.

Precision in tackling is still to come,
but the team finally has the punch.
Nevers, Cleaveland, and Williamson
shared honors for advancing the ball
from scrimmage, with Murray Cudde
back not far behind. Cuddeback, play
ing his first game for the Cardinal
since his reinstatement, got away for
some long runs, kicked well, and
proved generally that he will be a
hard man to keep off the team. Cap
tain Campbell returned some punts
for long distances, and the team
blocked the usual punt, the first touch
down following shortly after.
Santa Clara kicked off to Cleave
land, who fumbled, and the Mission
ites recovered on the 35-yard line. On
the fourth down Fawke kicked to
Campbell, who also fumbled but re
covered for Stanford on the 10-yard
line. Nevers kicked out to the 40-yard
mark, and Fawke was pulled down
where he stood.
Fawke punted, Harry Shipkey broke
through and blocked it, and Thomas
recovered on Santa Clara's 30-yard
line. After one first down, Nevers fum
bled and recovered with a loss of 3
yards, which he got back on the next
plunge. A pass, Woodward to Camp
bell, was not completed, but on fourth
down a criss-cross pass, Nevers to
Cleaveland to Woodward, sent "Bud"
across the line with the pellet. Wood
ward converted, and the slaughter
went on.
The Saints again kicked into a fum
ble and recovered the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. On fourth down
McKee attempted a pass, but Jim Law
son broke up the play by tackling the
ball 15 yards behind the line of scrim
mage, before McKee could get his
throw off. Line bucks by Cleaveland
and Neverß, with a 20-yard pass from
Woodward to Lawson, brought the
ball to the one-yard line, and Cleave
land went through center for another
score just after the second period
began. Woodward again converted.
Nevers kicked to Fawke this time,
and after an exchange of punts Storm
fumbled in Santa Clara territory, and
the Cards began another march down
the field. Ernie Nevers went through
left tackle and center for gains of one,
seventeen, and four yards, and Camp
bell converted for a total of 21 points.
Kerr had been substituting all along,
and when Nevers kicked off again he
sent reserves to replace all the regu
lars left on the field. These men were
slow in starting off, but a 10-yard pass,
