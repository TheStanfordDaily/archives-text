# VARSITY SWAMPS MISSIONITE TEAM UNDER 55-6 SCORE
## CASANOVA RUNS FUMBLE 80 YARDS FOR TALLY Kerr's Second and Third Squad Men Play Large Part of Contest; Cards Improve in all Departments but Tackling 
### William Wright, '25 
Nearly two score of Andy Kerr's vigorous footballers reduced the Santa
Clara Missionites to the same stage of dilapidation as the mission Saturday
afternoon, tramping on the Catholics to the extent of 55 to 6. The Cards
won their game more through enthusiasm and seeming instinctive knowledge
of ground-gaining than flawless and polished football form. Fumbles were
frequent, but only one turned out to be costly—and Casanova carried that
one across the Stanford line for the only Santa Clara thrill of the game.
Kerr seemingly consulted a bawlout and picked substitutes at random, but
still the ball went through. The second and third squads displayed a brand
of tackling slightly weaker than the head-liners, but Santa Clara was always
stopped without damage, except for a single first down in the third period,
against the third team almost impact. For this yardage they completed the
only pass, a 6-yard toss from Bundy to Rianda. The Cards made their yardage
23 times, fairly well divided among the four quarters.
Stanford made the expected improvement over last week, except in the way
of fumbling. Nine of these bobbles are a trifle too many for any team to
permit itself, and against a stronger team would have Droved vastlv serious.

Precision in tackling is still to come,
but the team finally has the punch.
Nevers, Cleaveland, and Williamson
shared honors for advancing the ball
from scrimmage, with Murray Cudde
back not far behind. Cuddeback, play
ing his first game for the Cardinal
since his reinstatement, got away for
some long runs, kicked well, and
proved generally that he will be a
hard man to keep off the team. Cap
tain Campbell returned some punts
for long distances, and the team
blocked the usual punt, the first touch
down following shortly after.
Santa Clara kicked off to Cleave
land, who fumbled, and the Mission
ites recovered on the 35-yard line. On
the fourth down Fawke kicked to
Campbell, who also fumbled but re
covered for Stanford on the 10-yard
line. Nevers kicked out to the 40-yard
mark, and Fawke was pulled down
where he stood.
Fawke punted, Harry Shipkey broke
through and blocked it, and Thomas
recovered on Santa Clara's 30-yard
line. After one first down, Nevers fum
bled and recovered with a loss of 3
yards, which he got back on the next
plunge. A pass, Woodward to Camp
bell, was not completed, but on fourth
down a criss-cross pass, Nevers to
Cleaveland to Woodward, sent "Bud"
across the line with the pellet. Wood
ward converted, and the slaughter
went on.
The Saints again kicked into a fum
ble and recovered the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. On fourth down
McKee attempted a pass, but Jim Law
son broke up the play by tackling the
ball 15 yards behind the line of scrim
mage, before McKee could get his
throw off. Line bucks by Cleaveland
and Neverß, with a 20-yard pass from
Woodward to Lawson, brought the
ball to the one-yard line, and Cleave
land went through center for another
score just after the second period
began. Woodward again converted.
Nevers kicked to Fawke this time,
and after an exchange of punts Storm
fumbled in Santa Clara territory, and
the Cards began another march down
the field. Ernie Nevers went through
left tackle and center for gains of one,
seventeen, and four yards, and Camp
bell converted for a total of 21 points.
Kerr had been substituting all along,
and when Nevers kicked off again he
sent reserves to replace all the regu
lars left on the field. These men were
slow in starting off, but a 10-yard pass,
Wheat to Mitchell, gave Cuddeback
inspiration for a 20-yard run around
right end for a touchdown. The Inter
ference, with Cuddeback's dodging and
choice of openings, made this one of
the features of the game. "Cuddy"
converted with a 35-yard kick from
placement, and the half ended imme
diately after Santa Clara's kick-off.
The line-up when Stanford trotted
onto the field for the second half, was
as follows: Dole, r. e.; Ludeke, r. t.;
Armour, r. g.; Hunt, c.; Neill, 1. g.;
Sholts, 1. t.; Middleton, 1. e.; Mitchell,
q.; Wheat, r. h.; Cuddeback, 1. h.;
and Solomon, f. In sending these men
in, Kerr told them that he would leave
them in the game provided they scored
a touchdown within five minutes.
Otherwise the first team would re
place them.
The not-so-despised "omelettes" tore
Into the Missionites like a silo full of
wild-cats, and had the white-jerseyed
team wondering where the funnel
shaped cloud came from. The Saints
kicked off to Cuddeback, who returned
15 yards to the Card 22-yard mark.
He then booted 40 yards to the Santa
Clara safety-man, who took a startled
glance at the furious ends bearing
down upon him, and dropped the ball.
Armour gathered it to his bosom, and
the word was "forward march."
Wheat pranced around right end for
20 yards, and repeated for three
around the left. Solomon went through
tackle for 7, and Cuddeback worked
the samp hole for 10. Gil Wheat got j
started wrong and was forced back 9 !
yards, but the Solomon-Cuddeback
right tackle combination made 5, and
then 8 for the touchdown. "Cuddy"
converted, and all within two minutes.
Late in the third quarter, Santa
Clara made her only first down.
''Andy" went and took a drink of
water, pondered the undesirability of
an enemy touchdown, and finally sent
iti the first team again. Nevers and
Cleaveland started the old parade, and
the end of the third period came as
Nevers bucked 16 yards through left
tackle, to the 17-yard station. Two
more plunges in the final period, and
he carried it over. Campbell converted
for 42 points, and the Cardinal root
ing section howled for from one to
three more touchdowns.
Quick action now. Stanford kicked
off to Bundy, who was brought down
in his tracks. McKee, attempting to
punt, lost a bad pass from center, and
Cravens recovered across the goal line
for another score. The Scotchman
must have been dizzied by the speed
of his team, and missed the goal.
Nevers kicked over the goal-line, the
Cards recovered a partlyblocked punt,
and Santa Clara recovered a fumble.
Campbell returned McKee's punt to
the 45-yard line, and the Card march
was interrupted after 40 yards by an
intercepted pass. Starting again from
the same place, Cleaveland, Nevers,
and Williamson carried the ball to the
goal, Cleaveland scoring with a 20-
yard run from criss-cross. Campbell
converted, for 55 to 0.
Stanford was well on the way to an
other score following "Blink" William
son's 30-yard dash, when the third j
team was sent in. On the second play !
Stratton fumbled the pass from cen-j
ter, and Casanova carried the ball 80
yards, aided by splendid interference.
McKee bungled the try-for-point, and
the Cards had a 49-point margin of
superiority.
Aside from Kirwan's 40-yard return
of the Santa Clara kick-off and Dun
mire's trip around end for 20* yards,
the rest of the game was uneventful.
The gun was fired with the ball on the
Mission 28-yard line.

Nearly two score of Andy Kerr's vigorous footballers reduced the Santa
Clara Missionites to the same stage of dilapidation as the mission Saturday
afternoon, tramping on the Catholics to the extent of 55 to 6. The Cards
won their game more through enthusiasm and seeming instinctive knowledge
of ground-gaining than flawless and polished football form. Fumbles were
frequent, but only one turned out to be costly—and Casanova carried that
one across the Stanford line for the only Santa Clara thrill of the game.
Kerr seemingly consulted a bawlout and picked substitutes at random, but
still the ball went through. The second and third squads displayed a brand
of tackling slightly weaker than the head-liners, but Santa Clara was always
stopped without damage, except for a single first down in the third period,
against the third team almost impact. For this yardage they completed the
only pass, a 6-yard toss from Bundy to Rianda. The Cards made their yardage
23 times, fairly well divided among the four quarters.
Stanford made the expected improvement over last week, except in the way
of fumbling. Nine of these bobbles are a trifle too many for any team to
permit itself, and against a stronger team would have Droved vastlv serious.

Precision in tackling is still to come,
but the team finally has the punch.
Nevers, Cleaveland, and Williamson
shared honors for advancing the ball
from scrimmage, with Murray Cudde
back not far behind. Cuddeback, play
ing his first game for the Cardinal
since his reinstatement, got away for
some long runs, kicked well, and
proved generally that he will be a
hard man to keep off the team. Cap
tain Campbell returned some punts
for long distances, and the team
blocked the usual punt, the first touch
down following shortly after.
Santa Clara kicked off to Cleave
land, who fumbled, and the Mission
ites recovered on the 35-yard line. On
the fourth down Fawke kicked to
Campbell, who also fumbled but re
covered for Stanford on the 10-yard
line. Nevers kicked out to the 40-yard
mark, and Fawke was pulled down
where he stood.
Fawke punted, Harry Shipkey broke
through and blocked it, and Thomas
recovered on Santa Clara's 30-yard
line. After one first down, Nevers fum
bled and recovered with a loss of 3
yards, which he got back on the next
plunge. A pass, Woodward to Camp
bell, was not completed, but on fourth
down a criss-cross pass, Nevers to
Cleaveland to Woodward, sent "Bud"
across the line with the pellet. Wood
ward converted, and the slaughter
went on.
The Saints again kicked into a fum
ble and recovered the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. On fourth down
McKee attempted a pass, but Jim Law
son broke up the play by tackling the
ball 15 yards behind the line of scrim
mage, before McKee could get his
throw off. Line bucks by Cleaveland
and Neverß, with a 20-yard pass from
Woodward to Lawson, brought the
ball to the one-yard line, and Cleave
land went through center for another
score just after the second period
began. Woodward again converted.
Nevers kicked to Fawke this time,
and after an exchange of punts Storm
fumbled in Santa Clara territory, and
the Cards began another march down
the field. Ernie Nevers went through
left tackle and center for gains of one,
seventeen, and four yards, and Camp
bell converted for a total of 21 points.
Kerr had been substituting all along,
and when Nevers kicked off again he
sent reserves to replace all the regu
lars left on the field. These men were
slow in starting off, but a 10-yard pass,
Wheat to Mitchell, gave Cuddeback
inspiration for a 20-yard run around
right end for a touchdown. The Inter
ference, with Cuddeback's dodging and
choice of openings, made this one of
the features of the game. "Cuddy"
converted with a 35-yard kick from
placement, and the half ended imme
diately after Santa Clara's kick-off.
The line-up when Stanford trotted
onto the field for the second half, was
as follows: Dole, r. e.; Ludeke, r. t.;
Armour, r. g.; Hunt, c.; Neill, 1. g.;
Sholts, 1. t.; Middleton, 1. e.; Mitchell,
q.; Wheat, r. h.; Cuddeback, 1. h.;
and Solomon, f. In sending these men
in, Kerr told them that he would leave
them in the game provided they scored
a touchdown within five minutes.
Otherwise the first team would re
place them.
The not-so-despised "omelettes" tore
Into the Missionites like a silo full of
wild-cats, and had the white-jerseyed
team wondering where the funnel
shaped cloud came from. The Saints
kicked off to Cuddeback, who returned
15 yards to the Card 22-yard mark.
He then booted 40 yards to the Santa
Clara safety-man, who took a startled
glance at the furious ends bearing
down upon him, and dropped the ball.
Armour gathered it to his bosom, and
the word was "forward march."
Wheat pranced around right end for
20 yards, and repeated for three
around the left. Solomon went through
tackle for 7, and Cuddeback worked
the samp hole for 10. Gil Wheat got j
started wrong and was forced back 9 !
yards, but the Solomon-Cuddeback
right tackle combination made 5, and
then 8 for the touchdown. "Cuddy"
converted, and all within two minutes.
Late in the third quarter, Santa
Clara made her only first down.
''Andy" went and took a drink of
water, pondered the undesirability of
an enemy touchdown, and finally sent
iti the first team again. Nevers and
Cleaveland started the old parade, and
the end of the third period came as
Nevers bucked 16 yards through left
tackle, to the 17-yard station. Two
more plunges in the final period, and
he carried it over. Campbell converted
for 42 points, and the Cardinal root
ing section howled for from one to
three more touchdowns.
Quick action now. Stanford kicked
off to Bundy, who was brought down
in his tracks. McKee, attempting to
punt, lost a bad pass from center, and
Cravens recovered across the goal line
for another score. The Scotchman
must have been dizzied by the speed
of his team, and missed the goal.
Nevers kicked over the goal-line, the
Cards recovered a partlyblocked punt,
and Santa Clara recovered a fumble.
Campbell returned McKee's punt to
the 45-yard line, and the Card march
was interrupted after 40 yards by an
intercepted pass. Starting again from
the same place, Cleaveland, Nevers,
and Williamson carried the ball to the
goal, Cleaveland scoring with a 20-
yard run from criss-cross. Campbell
converted, for 55 to 0.
Stanford was well on the way to an
other score following "Blink" William
son's 30-yard dash, when the third j
team was sent in. On the second play !
Stratton fumbled the pass from cen-j
ter, and Casanova carried the ball 80
yards, aided by splendid interference.
McKee bungled the try-for-point, and
the Cards had a 49-point margin of
superiority.

Nearly two score of Andy Kerr's vigorous footballers reduced the Santa
Clara Missionites to the same stage of dilapidation as the mission Saturday
afternoon, tramping on the Catholics to the extent of 55 to 6. The Cards
won their game more through enthusiasm and seeming instinctive knowledge
of ground-gaining than flawless and polished football form. Fumbles were
frequent, but only one turned out to be costly—and Casanova carried that
one across the Stanford line for the only Santa Clara thrill of the game.
Kerr seemingly consulted a bawlout and picked substitutes at random, but
still the ball went through. The second and third squads displayed a brand
of tackling slightly weaker than the head-liners, but Santa Clara was always
stopped without damage, except for a single first down in the third period,
against the third team almost impact. For this yardage they completed the
only pass, a 6-yard toss from Bundy to Rianda. The Cards made their yardage
23 times, fairly well divided among the four quarters.
Stanford made the expected improvement over last week, except in the way
of fumbling. Nine of these bobbles are a trifle too many for any team to
permit itself, and against a stronger team would have Droved vastlv serious.

Precision in tackling is still to come,
but the team finally has the punch.
Nevers, Cleaveland, and Williamson
shared honors for advancing the ball
from scrimmage, with Murray Cudde
back not far behind. Cuddeback, play
ing his first game for the Cardinal
since his reinstatement, got away for
some long runs, kicked well, and
proved generally that he will be a
hard man to keep off the team. Cap
tain Campbell returned some punts
for long distances, and the team
blocked the usual punt, the first touch
down following shortly after.
Santa Clara kicked off to Cleave
land, who fumbled, and the Mission
ites recovered on the 35-yard line. On
the fourth down Fawke kicked to
Campbell, who also fumbled but re
covered for Stanford on the 10-yard
line. Nevers kicked out to the 40-yard
mark, and Fawke was pulled down
where he stood.
Fawke punted, Harry Shipkey broke
through and blocked it, and Thomas
recovered on Santa Clara's 30-yard
line. After one first down, Nevers fum
bled and recovered with a loss of 3
yards, which he got back on the next
plunge. A pass, Woodward to Camp
bell, was not completed, but on fourth
down a criss-cross pass, Nevers to
Cleaveland to Woodward, sent "Bud"
across the line with the pellet. Wood
ward converted, and the slaughter
went on.
The Saints again kicked into a fum
ble and recovered the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. On fourth down
McKee attempted a pass, but Jim Law
son broke up the play by tackling the
ball 15 yards behind the line of scrim
mage, before McKee could get his
throw off. Line bucks by Cleaveland
and Neverß, with a 20-yard pass from
Woodward to Lawson, brought the
ball to the one-yard line, and Cleave
land went through center for another
score just after the second period
began. Woodward again converted.
Nevers kicked to Fawke this time,
and after an exchange of punts Storm
fumbled in Santa Clara territory, and
the Cards began another march down
the field. Ernie Nevers went through
left tackle and center for gains of one,
seventeen, and four yards, and Camp
bell converted for a total of 21 points.
Kerr had been substituting all along,
and when Nevers kicked off again he
sent reserves to replace all the regu
lars left on the field. These men were
slow in starting off, but a 10-yard pass,
Wheat to Mitchell, gave Cuddeback
inspiration for a 20-yard run around
right end for a touchdown. The Inter
ference, with Cuddeback's dodging and
choice of openings, made this one of
the features of the game. "Cuddy"
converted with a 35-yard kick from
placement, and the half ended imme
diately after Santa Clara's kick-off.
The line-up when Stanford trotted
onto the field for the second half, was
as follows: Dole, r. e.; Ludeke, r. t.;
Armour, r. g.; Hunt, c.; Neill, 1. g.;
Sholts, 1. t.; Middleton, 1. e.; Mitchell,
q.; Wheat, r. h.; Cuddeback, 1. h.;
and Solomon, f. In sending these men
in, Kerr told them that he would leave
them in the game provided they scored
a touchdown within five minutes.
Otherwise the first team would re
place them.
The not-so-despised "omelettes" tore
Into the Missionites like a silo full of
wild-cats, and had the white-jerseyed
team wondering where the funnel
shaped cloud came from. The Saints
kicked off to Cuddeback, who returned
15 yards to the Card 22-yard mark.
He then booted 40 yards to the Santa
Clara safety-man, who took a startled
glance at the furious ends bearing
down upon him, and dropped the ball.
Armour gathered it to his bosom, and
the word was "forward march."
Wheat pranced around right end for
20 yards, and repeated for three
around the left. Solomon went through
tackle for 7, and Cuddeback worked
the samp hole for 10. Gil Wheat got j
started wrong and was forced back 9 !
yards, but the Solomon-Cuddeback
right tackle combination made 5, and
then 8 for the touchdown. "Cuddy"
converted, and all within two minutes.
Late in the third quarter, Santa
Clara made her only first down.
''Andy" went and took a drink of
water, pondered the undesirability of
an enemy touchdown, and finally sent
iti the first team again. Nevers and
Cleaveland started the old parade, and
the end of the third period came as
Nevers bucked 16 yards through left
tackle, to the 17-yard station. Two
more plunges in the final period, and
he carried it over. Campbell converted
for 42 points, and the Cardinal root
ing section howled for from one to
three more touchdowns.
Quick action now. Stanford kicked
off to Bundy, who was brought down
in his tracks. McKee, attempting to
punt, lost a bad pass from center, and
Cravens recovered across the goal line
for another score. The Scotchman
must have been dizzied by the speed
of his team, and missed the goal.
Nevers kicked over the goal-line, the
Cards recovered a partlyblocked punt,
and Santa Clara recovered a fumble.
Campbell returned McKee's punt to
the 45-yard line, and the Card march
was interrupted after 40 yards by an
intercepted pass. Starting again from
the same place, Cleaveland, Nevers,
and Williamson carried the ball to the
goal, Cleaveland scoring with a 20-
yard run from criss-cross. Campbell
converted, for 55 to 0.
Stanford was well on the way to an
other score following "Blink" William
son's 30-yard dash, when the third j
team was sent in. On the second play !
Stratton fumbled the pass from cen-j
ter, and Casanova carried the ball 80

Nearly two score of Andy Kerr's vigorous footballers reduced the Santa
Clara Missionites to the same stage of dilapidation as the mission Saturday
afternoon, tramping on the Catholics to the extent of 55 to 6. The Cards
won their game more through enthusiasm and seeming instinctive knowledge
of ground-gaining than flawless and polished football form. Fumbles were
frequent, but only one turned out to be costly—and Casanova carried that
one across the Stanford line for the only Santa Clara thrill of the game.
Kerr seemingly consulted a bawlout and picked substitutes at random, but
still the ball went through. The second and third squads displayed a brand
of tackling slightly weaker than the head-liners, but Santa Clara was always
stopped without damage, except for a single first down in the third period,
against the third team almost impact. For this yardage they completed the
only pass, a 6-yard toss from Bundy to Rianda. The Cards made their yardage
23 times, fairly well divided among the four quarters.
Stanford made the expected improvement over last week, except in the way
of fumbling. Nine of these bobbles are a trifle too many for any team to
permit itself, and against a stronger team would have Droved vastlv serious.

Precision in tackling is still to come,
but the team finally has the punch.
Nevers, Cleaveland, and Williamson
shared honors for advancing the ball
from scrimmage, with Murray Cudde
back not far behind. Cuddeback, play
ing his first game for the Cardinal
since his reinstatement, got away for
some long runs, kicked well, and
proved generally that he will be a
hard man to keep off the team. Cap
tain Campbell returned some punts
for long distances, and the team
blocked the usual punt, the first touch
down following shortly after.
Santa Clara kicked off to Cleave
land, who fumbled, and the Mission
ites recovered on the 35-yard line. On
the fourth down Fawke kicked to
Campbell, who also fumbled but re
covered for Stanford on the 10-yard
line. Nevers kicked out to the 40-yard
mark, and Fawke was pulled down
where he stood.
Fawke punted, Harry Shipkey broke
through and blocked it, and Thomas
recovered on Santa Clara's 30-yard
line. After one first down, Nevers fum
bled and recovered with a loss of 3
yards, which he got back on the next
plunge. A pass, Woodward to Camp
bell, was not completed, but on fourth
down a criss-cross pass, Nevers to
Cleaveland to Woodward, sent "Bud"
across the line with the pellet. Wood
ward converted, and the slaughter
went on.
The Saints again kicked into a fum
ble and recovered the ball on Stan
ford's 35-yard line. On fourth down
McKee attempted a pass, but Jim Law
son broke up the play by tackling the
ball 15 yards behind the line of scrim
mage, before McKee could get his
throw off. Line bucks by Cleaveland
and Neverß, with a 20-yard pass from
Woodward to Lawson, brought the
ball to the one-yard line, and Cleave
land went through center for another
score just after the second period
began. Woodward again converted.
Nevers kicked to Fawke this time,
and after an exchange of punts Storm
fumbled in Santa Clara territory, and
the Cards began another march down
the field. Ernie Nevers went through
left tackle and center for gains of one,
seventeen, and four yards, and Camp
bell converted for a total of 21 points.
Kerr had been substituting all along,
and when Nevers kicked off again he
sent reserves to replace all the regu
lars left on the field. These men were
slow in starting off, but a 10-yard pass,
Wheat to Mitchell, gave Cuddeback
inspiration for a 20-yard run around
right end for a touchdown. The Inter
ference, with Cuddeback's dodging and
choice of openings, made this one of
the features of the game. "Cuddy"
converted with a 35-yard kick from
placement, and the half ended imme
diately after Santa Clara's kick-off.
The line-up when Stanford trotted
onto the field for the second half, was
as follows: Dole, r. e.; Ludeke, r. t.;
Armour, r. g.; Hunt, c.; Neill, 1. g.;
Sholts, 1. t.; Middleton, 1. e.; Mitchell,
q.; Wheat, r. h.; Cuddeback, 1. h.;
and Solomon, f. In sending these men
in, Kerr told them that he would leave
them in the game provided they scored
a touchdown within five minutes.
Otherwise the first team would re
place them.
The not-so-despised "omelettes" tore
Into the Missionites like a silo full of
wild-cats, and had the white-jerseyed
team wondering where the funnel
shaped cloud came from. The Saints
kicked off to Cuddeback, who returned
15 yards to the Card 22-yard mark.
He then booted 40 yards to the Santa
Clara safety-man, who took a startled
glance at the furious ends bearing
down upon him, and dropped the ball.
Armour gathered it to his bosom, and
the word was "forward march."
Wheat pranced around right end for
20 yards, and repeated for three
around the left. Solomon went through
tackle for 7, and Cuddeback worked
the samp hole for 10. Gil Wheat got j
started wrong and was forced back 9 !
yards, but the Solomon-Cuddeback
right tackle combination made 5, and
then 8 for the touchdown. "Cuddy"
converted, and all within two minutes.
Late in the third quarter, Santa
Clara made her only first down.
''Andy" went and took a drink of
water, pondered the undesirability of
an enemy touchdown, and finally sent
iti the first team again. Nevers and
Cleaveland started the old parade, and
the end of the third period came as
Nevers bucked 16 yards through left
tackle, to the 17-yard station. Two
more plunges in the final period, and
he carried it over. Campbell converted
for 42 points, and the Cardinal root
ing section howled for from one to
three more touchdowns.
Quick action now. Stanford kicked
off to Bundy, who was brought down
in his tracks. McKee, attempting to
punt, lost a bad pass from center, and
Cravens recovered across the goal line
for another score. The Scotchman
must have been dizzied by the speed
of his team, and missed the goal.
Nevers kicked over the goal-line, the
Cards recovered a partlyblocked punt,
and Santa Clara recovered a fumble.
Campbell returned McKee's punt to
the 45-yard line, and the Card march
was interrupted after 40 yards by an
intercepted pass. Starting again from
the same place, Cleaveland, Nevers,
and Williamson carried the ball to the
goal, Cleaveland scoring with a 20-
yard run from criss-cross. Campbell
converted, for 55 to 0.
Stanford was well on the way to an
