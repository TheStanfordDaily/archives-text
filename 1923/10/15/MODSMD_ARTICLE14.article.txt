# Chappie Will Appear November 1, if Copy Is Submitted Pronto
## 
### 
Chappie announces his next appear
ance for November 1. But a pre
requisite for his second "coming out"
of the year is copy and art. So far
Chappie's make-up is in doubt, and the
art work which is in the process of
construction is desired by Chappie's
assistants immediately. Literary work
should be sent in, too, as soon as pos
sible, although the deadline has been
set for October 20.
The features of the issue are still
hidden from the public gaze, and it is
expected that the incoming'copy will
be a pleasant surprise to Chappie
himself.
