People who create diversions in class for the sake
of defeating authority find that the amusement loses
its piquancy when the professor thoughtlessly con
tinues his discourse for the benefit of those who
appreciate it. Aside from niinor considerations of
grades, certain free souls often discover that theii
skill and energy in tricking the lecturer is wasted
when no attention is paid to their original researches
in nonsense. â€¢
