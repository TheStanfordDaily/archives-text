Total score last season—s6.
Total score last Saturday —55.
There it is again—the varsity always trailing
around on the short end of the score. Just when
they have a chance to step out and do something,
they lose —by one point. Really now, that s a big
disappointment. If the team doesn tdo better than
that next week it will be a bum year for the Cardinal.
