We (meaning me only speaking editorially I use the
correct "we") were rushing (in spite of the Interfra
ternity Council) down the postoffice steps yesterday
when we ran directly into a co-ed. She looked familitr,
but, when we tried to get the same way, she blushed
and hurried intp the line before the general delivery
window, where she was quickly swallowed to view.
"What an attractive woman," I murmured. "She must
be new to this place, so I know I can't have met her
before."
We knew she was new here; otherwise, she could
never have blushed —H. M.
