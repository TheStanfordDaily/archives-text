Well, we don't care so awfully much what they do to
lots of old traditions; let 'em abolish them, amend them,
revive them. . . we say not a word. But this is going
too far; we won't stand for the abolishment of such a
hallowed tradition as the Roble Sunday Night supper.
We notice that a committee has been appointed to And
a means of bringing about this change. That should be
easy . . . merely tell the cook not to heat that extra
can of beans Sunday noon, and to leave the extra loaf
of bread in the pantry, and the supper as it now stands
is defunct.
But this is a dangerous habit. Suppose other women's
dormitories —pardon us, we meant, suppose the sorori
ties took it up. Where would tens and twenties of men
now making the Sunday night meal a clear profit eat?
