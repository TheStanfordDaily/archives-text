# ODE TO SUNDAY SUPPER
## 
### 
Oh, where is the steak which we didn't eat Monday,
The beans we neglected to do justice to?
And where are the carrots, the fish and potatoes?
We find them again in the Sunday night stew!
Coarse
The Sunday night supper, in which the cooks scupper,
The meat and potatoes reclaimed through the week,
With all due revering the croquette's appearing.
We play the cook's game of "I hide and you seek."
(For more verses, apply to your own house manager;
he's got the inside dope on these things, while we re
only amateurs.) H. M.

The alarm clock points to eleven and it is time as
