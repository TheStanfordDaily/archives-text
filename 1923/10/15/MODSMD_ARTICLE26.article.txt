# The
						End, or the Wild Queen

(Continued from Friday)

Oh, By Gee, By Gosh, By Gum, By Juv, all had died
of patriotic love; the people were using all kinds of
abusing and calling on Heaven above to wallop this
man, thus regaling their clan.
So out stepped their Highness, By Jingo, and said in
her insolent lingo, "Hola, let me at this here Gringo,
and I'll put a stop to this man. Step aside, you cheap
stuff; let the Queen treat him rough!
Away she went on marriage bent, while the natives
chuckled and snorted; lyit they laughed too quick for
the Queen was slick and a huge success was reported.
For the Queen was an acrobat—her contortions just
knocked Heck flat—each bone-twisting antic drove him
even more frantic, and what do you think of that?
She brought him home and the people jumped him; by
way of revenge they soundly thumped him with clubs
and various heavy things while poor By Jingo was run
ning rings.
"I love him, you fools, let him be—I'm queen—he be
longs to me."
"Shut up!" said the people, "he's dead." So Jingo
shot off her head.
