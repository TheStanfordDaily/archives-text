"The Hunchback of Notre Dame";
Capitol Theater, San Francisco, now
playing.
To our public, we wish to announce
that this theater review cost us much
suffering. For a long time we stood
patiently in line before the Capitol, await
ing our chance to part with the better
part of two dollars. And then, for two
hours and a half we sat and suffered all
the mental reactions of which the human
soul is capable; not only watched an
other suffer, but did ourselves.
We have done this about three times
since leaving behind the period in which
we agitatedly chewed our gum while
watching the bold bad man of the West
ern praries. Most pictures leave us with
the sense of having seen something of
lifer "The Hunchback" left us with the
feeling of having lived a dreadful chap
ter of another's history.

Lon Chaney is superb. As the twisted,
repulsive, yet wistful creature of Hugo's
story, his portrayal is above reproach.
From a hungering adoration to a con
suming passion he lead us; made us
know hate, and cringing fear, and thirst
for hot revenge.
In keeping with Chaney's performance
was that of Miss Miller, a new star
scintillating in her first really big pic
ture. Hers was a part where beauty
must be supplemented with real dramatic
feeling, and she proved herself an able
supporter of the Chaney standard.
