Wagner's famous Prelude to "Lohen
grin" was played by Warren D. Allen,
organist, at the Memorial
Church Thursday.
Wagner's hero, "Lohengrin" was a
Knight of the Holy Grail, and the fre
quent suggestions of the Grail theme
in the opera is prophetic of the sacred
drama, "Parsifal," written many years
later. The Prelude is considered by some
as a perfect expression of high aspira
tion and nobility of purpose.
"Little Fugue in G minor," the second
number was presented as a refutation of
the generally mistaken idea that the
minor mode is necessarily gloomy.
( "Berceuse," from "Jocelyn," by Go
dard, and the "Fantaisie Dialoguee," by
Leon Boellmann, completed the program.
Contrast is shown in the works of these
two composers, Godard being a modern
French composer, whose popular success,
critics say, deterred him from great
achievement. Boellmann's work, on the
other hand, is one of the best composi
tions of its kind.

Registration total for the University
of Texas was 4271. This exceeds the
number enrolled last year at the same
time by 254.
