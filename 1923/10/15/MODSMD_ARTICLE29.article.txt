### 
At 21 years of age, Dean George B.
i Culver was attending Stanford in the
| Sophomore Class, having entered in the
i Zoology department with the class of
J 1897.
He graduated from Oakland High
School in 1892, and with no definite work
in mind he took a job on a fruit ranch
in Napa county. While there, a friend,
the late W. W. Price, who was a student
at Stanford and interested in zoology,
wrote him for animal specimens from
Napa county. Dean Culver sent him two
jack rabbits, and received a letter of
thanks from Dr. Charles H. Gilbert, who
was at that time head of the Department
of Zoology, just as he is today. Culver
was also asked to get some chipmunk
specimens for the University and was
later invited to visit Stanford. Although
he was opposed to college when he came
to the campus, Dean Culver became in
! terested and decided to attend.
In 1893 Culver entered the University
| and worked on some original problems in
the Zoology department, devoting most
i of his time to the study of fish, Jn this

work he went with Dr. Jordan to Mex
ico on a scientific trip, tinanced by Tim
othy Hopkins, who established the lab
oratory at Pacific Grove. During his
college course, Dean Culver worked in
the laboratory for 15 cents an hour. He
spent his summers collecting specimens
for his department, receiving little re
muneration other than his expenses.
While an undergraduate, the dean won
the mile run on the old stock farm race
track, which was used by the students for
training purposes as well as for exhibi
tions when the world's record trotting
horses of Senator Stanford were not
limbering up. After Culver was defeat
ed in his race at California while a
freshman, he took up the journalistic side
of athletics and wrote articles for the
Sequoia, a student publication. He was
also correspondent for the San Francisco
Call, then a morning paper.
Dean Culver played class baseball and
was extremely interested in campus poli
tiins. Life 1 was more intimate then than
now, and the professors and students
had much closer contact, he says.
