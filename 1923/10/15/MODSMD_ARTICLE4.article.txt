# FRESHMEN WIN SLOW GAME FROM MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE, 7-0
## Fumbles and Lack of Coordination Make Contest Uninteresting; Babe Line Shows Poorly 
### Walter Campbell, '26 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's '27 gridders
defeated Modesto Junior College, 7-0,
in a languid contest last Saturday in
the Stanford stadium. The game,
played as a preliminary to the varsity
and Santa Clara contest, was slow and
uninteresting, offering a marked con-1
trast to the varsity game which fol
lowed.
For at least six minutes it appeared
as though the freshmen were in for
a good day. A forty-yard pass from
Moore to Greisser, a criss-cross play
with Garthwaite carrying the ball, and
a touchdown was scored. The six min- 1
utes were up, and from the spectator's i

standpoint the rest of the game was a
total loss. The only point of conten
tion thereafter was to see whether
Modesto or the freshmen could score
the greater number of fumbles. It got
so finally that any headgear, attached
or unattached, was in dire danger of
being the center of a scrambling
group of players.
Line Is Erratic
The freshman line played a streaky
sort of game. One minute the linemen
would look like world beaters, and at
another they would look like hopeless
ly green recruits. Without an excep
tion they seemed to show a lack of
confidence in the backfield. In critical
moments the line seemed unable to
open holes for the backs to plunge
through.
Dick Hyland, star left half, who was
declared eligible at a late hour, en
tered the game for a few minutes to
ward the middle of the second half.
A few plays with Hyland carrying the
ball, and the freshmen were again in
a position to score. Hyland was then
replaced, leaving it to the other backs
to put the ball over. With three yards
to go, the ball was fumbled over the
goal line and Modesto recovered for
a touchback.
The Junior College eleven presented
a much stronger defense than offense.
The freshmen were not long in finding
this out. While Modesto could not
make progress against the freshmen,
neither could the freshmen break
away from their hard-tackling oppon
ents.
