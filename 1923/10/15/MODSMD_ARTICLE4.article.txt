# FRESHMEN WIN SLOW GAME FROM MODESTO JUNIOR COLLEGE, 7-0
## Fumbles and Lack of Coordination Make Contest Uninteresting; Babe Line Shows Poorly 
### Walter Campbell, '26 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's '27 gridders
defeated Modesto Junior College, 7-0,
in a languid contest last Saturday in
the Stanford stadium. The game,
played as a preliminary to the varsity
and Santa Clara contest, was slow and
uninteresting, offering a marked con-1
trast to the varsity game which fol
lowed.
For at least six minutes it appeared
as though the freshmen were in for
a good day. A forty-yard pass from
Moore to Greisser, a criss-cross play
with Garthwaite carrying the ball, and
a touchdown was scored. The six min- 1
utes were up, and from the spectator's i

standpoint the rest of the game was a
total loss. The only point of conten
tion thereafter was to see whether
Modesto or the freshmen could score
the greater number of fumbles. It got
so finally that any headgear, attached
or unattached, was in dire danger of
being the center of a scrambling
group of players.
Line Is Erratic
The freshman line played a streaky
sort of game. One minute the linemen
would look like world beaters, and at
another they would look like hopeless
ly green recruits. Without an excep
tion they seemed to show a lack of
confidence in the backfield. In critical
moments the line seemed unable to
open holes for the backs to plunge
through.
Dick Hyland, star left half, who was
declared eligible at a late hour, en
tered the game for a few minutes to
ward the middle of the second half.
A few plays with Hyland carrying the
ball, and the freshmen were again in
a position to score. Hyland was then
replaced, leaving it to the other backs
to put the ball over. With three yards
to go, the ball was fumbled over the
goal line and Modesto recovered for
a touchback.
The Junior College eleven presented
a much stronger defense than offense.
The freshmen were not long in finding
this out. While Modesto could not
make progress against the freshmen,
neither could the freshmen break
away from their hard-tackling oppon
ents.
Babes Miss Tackles
The freshmen revealed a startling
proclivity for missing tackles, some
times as many as three men allowing
a runner to slip through their hands.
But again, as though to show that this
was not a habit, a brilliant tackle
would be made occasionally.
For the freshmen the stars were
few and far between. Moore, who
started at fullback, appears to have
the makings of a good man. Mahan,
relieving Baldwin at quarterback, will
put in a strong bid for the position
when the assignments against Cali
)
fornia are made out.
In the line, all the playing was about
on the same level. Fred Swan failed
to play the type of game that had
marked him in earlier games. Ander
son, at guard, did some hard tackling
and got down well under punts. Aside
from that, little or nothing can be
said of the work of the freshman line
Saturday.
Keller, at fullback for Modesto, was
playing one of the prettiest games 011
the field until he was removed because
of injuries. Ferrel, playing left half,
was the biggest ground gainer for
Modesto, but was guilty of costly
fumbles.
Team Must Buck Up
With but two weeks to go until the
U. S. C. freshman game and three
until the California freshman game,
the babes are in for a busy fortnight
of ironing out the rough spots. The
California freshmen have been running
up big scores this season, beating
Davis Farm 18-0 last Saturday. The
U. S. C. babes have not been marking
time either, beating some of the
strongest high school teams in the
south and taking Loyola College into
camp by a decisive score.
The opening line-up for Saturday's
game was:
Freshmen Modesto —

Swan LTR Gerken
Anderson LGR Thielfel

from that, little or nothing can be
said of the work of the freshman line
Saturday.
Keller, at fullback for Modesto, was
playing one of the prettiest games 011
the field until he was removed because
of injuries. Ferrel, playing left half,
was the biggest ground gainer for
Modesto, but was guilty of costly
fumbles.
Team Must Buck Up
With but two weeks to go until the
U. S. C. freshman game and three
until the California freshman game,
the babes are in for a busy fortnight
of ironing out the rough spots. The
California freshmen have been running
up big scores this season, beating
Davis Farm 18-0 last Saturday. The
U. S. C. babes have not been marking
time either, beating some of the
strongest high school teams in the
south and taking Loyola College into
camp by a decisive score.
The opening line-up for Saturday's
game was:
Freshmen Modesto —
Adams LER Ragan
Swan LTR Gerken
Anderson LGR Thielfel
Price C Gorson
Scott RGL Fresnell
Stockham RTL Colson
Greisser REL Johnson
Baldwin Q Critser
Garthwaite RHL Snowden
Phillips LHR Ferrel
Moore F Keller
Coach "Husky" Hunt's '27 gridders
defeated Modesto Junior College, 7-0,
in a languid contest last Saturday in
the Stanford stadium. The game,
played as a preliminary to the varsity
and Santa Clara contest, was slow and
uninteresting, offering a marked con-1
trast to the varsity game which fol
lowed.
For at least six minutes it appeared
as though the freshmen were in for
a good day. A forty-yard pass from
Moore to Greisser, a criss-cross play
with Garthwaite carrying the ball, and
a touchdown was scored. The six min- 1
utes were up, and from the spectator's i

standpoint the rest of the game was a
total loss. The only point of conten
tion thereafter was to see whether
Modesto or the freshmen could score
the greater number of fumbles. It got
so finally that any headgear, attached
or unattached, was in dire danger of
being the center of a scrambling
group of players.
Line Is Erratic
The freshman line played a streaky
sort of game. One minute the linemen
would look like world beaters, and at
another they would look like hopeless
ly green recruits. Without an excep
tion they seemed to show a lack of
confidence in the backfield. In critical
moments the line seemed unable to
open holes for the backs to plunge
through.
Dick Hyland, star left half, who was
declared eligible at a late hour, en
tered the game for a few minutes to
ward the middle of the second half.
A few plays with Hyland carrying the
ball, and the freshmen were again in
a position to score. Hyland was then
replaced, leaving it to the other backs
to put the ball over. With three yards
to go, the ball was fumbled over the
goal line and Modesto recovered for
a touchback.
The Junior College eleven presented
a much stronger defense than offense.
The freshmen were not long in finding
this out. While Modesto could not
make progress against the freshmen,
neither could the freshmen break
away from their hard-tackling oppon
ents.
Babes Miss Tackles
The freshmen revealed a startling
proclivity for missing tackles, some
times as many as three men allowing
a runner to slip through their hands.
But again, as though to show that this
was not a habit, a brilliant tackle
would be made occasionally.
For the freshmen the stars were
few and far between. Moore, who
started at fullback, appears to have
the makings of a good man. Mahan,
relieving Baldwin at quarterback, will
put in a strong bid for the position
when the assignments against Cali
)
fornia are made out.
In the line, all the playing was about
on the same level. Fred Swan failed
to play the type of game that had
marked him in earlier games. Ander
son, at guard, did some hard tackling
and got down well under punts. Aside
from that, little or nothing can be
said of the work of the freshman line
Saturday.
