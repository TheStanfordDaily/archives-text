# ENGLISH PROFESSOR DISCUSSES DRAMAS PLAYED IN EUROPE
## Henry Gray Follows London Season; New Movement Is Sweeping Europe 
### 
"There is an increasing interest in the
drama abroad as well as at home," stated
Professor Henry Gray of the English
department, in discussing the drama of
Europe. "While abroad I saw plays in
Paris, Berlin and Vienna, and became in
tensely interested in the new movement
which is sweeping the theaters of both
Europe and America. There is apparent
in Europe a keener interest in deeper
and more significant plays than there is
in this country, though there is also a
growing interest in such plays in
America."
"In London I had the great privilege of
witnessing the first night of a play par
tially written by Shakespeare," continued
Professor Gray. "There I saw the play,
'Sir Thomas More,' which contains one
hitherto unacted scene written by Shake
speare. It has not been until recent times
that students of Shakespeare have con
sidered that the insurrection scene in 'Sir
Thomas More' was written by Shake
speare, but they are now practically
agreed that he was the author of the
scene. As far as can be learned, this
scene was never before acted, as it was
censored at the time of the play's ap
pearance on account of the political situ
ation in England."
"Sir Thomas More" exists in the origi
nal in the British Museum and was prob
ably written by Shakespeare, Decker, and
two other people, whose handwritings are
unidentified. It was edited by several
people, one of whom was Shakespeare.
If Shakespeare did write the insurrection
scene, there then exists three folio pages
of Shakespeare's handwriting. This scene
and six autographs are the only originals
of the great dramatist in existence.
