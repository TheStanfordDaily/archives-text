# Varsity Soccerites Lose To San Mateo Team; 2-1
## 
### 
Fighting every minute, but with the
breaks against them, the Stanford soccer
team met defeat at the hands of the Sons
of St. George from San Mateo last Sat
urday on the varsity field by the score of
2-1. This is the second game the Stan
ford men have lost this season.
The defeat of the Cards was an upset
of the dope, as the Sons of St. George
were considered one of the weaker teams
of the league. In their first game the
San Mateo men met defeat at the hands
of the Olympics by an 8-0 score, while
the strong Viking team walloped the
Cards by a 2-1 score. Maloney's team
still has a chance of copping the league
title, however, and if they win their re
maining games the cup may again come
to the Farm.
Stanford had the ball in the Sons of
St. George territory throughout the
greater part of the game. In the first
half the plcj was close with the Stanford
backfield keeping the ball well down in
the opponents' territory. The San Mateo
team was the first to score, when a foul
was called on Stanford and A. Wallace
put the penalty kick through the goal.
This ended the scoring for the half.
In the second half the Stanford men
carried the ball down the field, but
missed several shots at goal. Finally,
Swayne kicked for the goal, but the goal
keeper knocked the ball out toward Mun
ford, who headed it to Quigley, who in
turn slammed the ball past Stone, the

Viking goalkeeper. This brought the
score to one all.
The ball went up and down the field
for some time, before the Sons of St.
George were able to get away from Ma
loney's men. Finally, the San Mateo for
ward line carried the ball to the goal and
Stone put in an easy kick, bringing the
score to 2-1. Stanford had several
chances to score after this, but failed to
take advantake of them.
Munford was the bright light on the
Stanford team. Playing at center for
ward, he was easily the most aggressive
man in the line-up. The backs displayed
a good brand of ball but with the ex
ception of Munford the forward line
seemed to lack punch.
In the second team game the Russian
Athletic club defeated the Stanford sec
ond team at Golden Gate Park by the
score of 1-0.

carried the ball down the field, but
missed several shots at goal. Finally,
Swayne kicked for the goal, but the goal
keeper knocked the ball out toward Mun
ford, who headed it to Quigley, who in
turn slammed the ball past Stone, the

Viking goalkeeper. This brought the
score to one all.
The ball went up and down the field
for some time, before the Sons of St.
George were able to get away from Ma
loney's men. Finally, the San Mateo for
ward line carried the ball to the goal and
Stone put in an easy kick, bringing the
score to 2-1. Stanford had several
chances to score after this, but failed to
take advantake of them.
Munford was the bright light on the
Stanford team. Playing at center for
ward, he was easily the most aggressive
man in the line-up. The backs displayed
a good brand of ball but with the ex
ception of Munford the forward line
seemed to lack punch.
In the second team game the Russian
Athletic club defeated the Stanford sec
ond team at Golden Gate Park by the
score of 1-0.

Fighting every minute, but with the
breaks against them, the Stanford soccer
team met defeat at the hands of the Sons
of St. George from San Mateo last Sat
urday on the varsity field by the score of
2-1. This is the second game the Stan
ford men have lost this season.
The defeat of the Cards was an upset
of the dope, as the Sons of St. George
were considered one of the weaker teams
of the league. In their first game the
San Mateo men met defeat at the hands
of the Olympics by an 8-0 score, while
the strong Viking team walloped the
Cards by a 2-1 score. Maloney's team
still has a chance of copping the league
title, however, and if they win their re
maining games the cup may again come
to the Farm.
Stanford had the ball in the Sons of
St. George territory throughout the
greater part of the game. In the first
half the plcj was close with the Stanford
backfield keeping the ball well down in
the opponents' territory. The San Mateo
team was the first to score, when a foul
was called on Stanford and A. Wallace
put the penalty kick through the goal.
This ended the scoring for the half.
In the second half the Stanford men
carried the ball down the field, but
missed several shots at goal. Finally,
