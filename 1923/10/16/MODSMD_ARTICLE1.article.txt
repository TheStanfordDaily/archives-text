# WORLD COURT ASKS AMERICAN PUBLIC OPINION
## Moral Support of Nations Is Needed, Says Amy Cryan, London Lecturer 
### 
"America is wanted in the World
Court, not for American legal experi
ence nor American money, but for
American public opinion," said Miss
Amy Cryan of London in a lecture on
international relations yesterday in
the Little Theater.
"What the court needs is the moral
support of public opinion, and Ameri
ca and England are the countries
which should be the first to give it,"
she continued. "America and England
were the first countries to attempt rule
by arbitration. The Hague conferences
were started by those countries and
from 1902 to 1912, 144 disputes were
settled by arbitration.
"When the League of Nations came
to making a World Court it didn't
know how to go about it so it turned
to The Hague for a plan. The Hague
plan, which was modeled on the plan
of the supreme court of America, was
accepted with some changes.
"The World Court merely asks that
the contending nations go before
judges who are disinterested in theif
grievances and skilled in giving jus
tice. There is no force used, for that
is against international law. Cases of
politics are not tried before the court.
There is no charge, and no punish
ment is administered if the verdict of
the court is disobeyed.
"International law has grown up
from the moral ideas of nations for
300 years. The morals of one genera
tion are the laws of the next. A plan
of international law was first thought
of during the Thirty Years War. It
was too early for such a movement
then, however. William Pitt was the
next man to suggest such law but the
nation was not ready for it then. The
Holy Alliance grew up out of a desire
for peace but it was conceived by the
czar of Russia, a supreme monarch,
and did not succeed in its original
purpose.
"England has discovered that no
matter who wins the war, she and the
United States always lose and there
fore she is in favor of any law by
which the quarrels of nations will be
settled."
Miss Cryan was assistant commis
sioner and official lecturer to the Brit
ish government during the war. This
year she is delivering a course of lec
tures at Mills College.
