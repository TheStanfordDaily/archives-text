## Last dear's First Team Players Register for Major Fall Sport 
### 
"One hundred and eleven women
are out for hockey this fall," says
Helen Masters Bunting, director of
Roble gymnasium and one of the three
hockey coaches. "Everyone of last sea
son's first team players who has regis
tered again in the University has
signed up to play hockey, the women's
major autumn sport.
"The first of the interclass series
of games will begin not later than
November 15, and possibly will start
a week sooner.
"Twenty-nine freshman women are
trying for the first-year team. Al
though only three or four have played
before there seems to be good ma- j
terial among them and all of them are i
enthusiastic over the game."
Thirty-three sophomores have begun
practice. These include all of last
year's freshman team and several new
players as well. Twenty-eight juniors j
have enlisted to play. Their last year's
players are all present with the ex
ception of two women who did not re
turn to the University.
The senior-graduate squad of twen
ty-one players is the weakest in num
bers but most of them have had the
experience of three or four years on
the hockey field. Miss Bunting urges
that more come out for this team
whether they have played before or
not.
All the squads have had one prac
tice and some of them have been on
the turf twice. Practices are held two
days a week for longer periods than in
previous years.
