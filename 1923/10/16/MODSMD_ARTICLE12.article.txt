# America Not Appreciated, Says New Instructor in Citizenship
## 
### 
"Americans do not realize what a
Paradise they have. If they could see
conditions in Europe they would come
back with a new appreciation of their
own country." This is the opinion of
J. G. Maytin, new Stanford instructor
in citizenship this quarter and a re
search worker for the Hoover War
Library.
Maytin was born in Kiev, Ukraine,
and has spent the greater part of his
life in Europe and Asia. He lived for
fifteen years in Manchuria and he has
also lived in China, Japan, and Korea.
He speaks Russian, Chinese, and
Japanese. For some time Maytin
studied at a Russian diplomatic col
lege in Vladivostok. He lost two broth

ers in the Russian revolution, one be
ing executed by the bolsheviki and the
other by the cossacks.
During the war Maytin was with the
American Railway Commission and
later served as an intelligence officer
in Russia and Siberia under Dr. David
Barrows, former president of the Uni
versity of California. In this latter
capacity he was frequently called upon
to act as an intermediary between
the peasants and the American officers
because of his command of the Rus
sian language.
Prior to coming to Stanford Maytin
lectured on international relations and
American constitutional problems at
California and at Mills College.
