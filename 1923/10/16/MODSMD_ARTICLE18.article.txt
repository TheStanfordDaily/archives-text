# VARSITY READY TO CLASH WITH OXY SATURDAY
## Thirty-Five Card Players Will Leave Thursday Night for Los Angeles 
### 
Thirty-five Cardinal gridders will
leave Thursday night for Los Angeles
to meet the Occidental College foot
ball team, Saturday, in the Los An
geles coliseum. Coach Andy Kerr has
not announced who will make the trip,
but every man who has made any
showing whatever this season is ex
pected to be on the list.
Kerr evidently expects to make
substitutions freely throughout the
game, and for that reason is taking
every available man.
The showing of the Cardinal substi
tutes last Saturday against Santa
Clara would justify such a move as
both the first second and first teams
played good football.
Gil Wheat, who was substituted at
halfback against Santa Clara, is a
comer who will bear close watching.
On different occasions Wheat evaded
Santa Clara tacklers for long gains,
and only once did he fail to make
yardage.
Big Ernie NeVers did most of the
hard bucking for Stanford. No less
than twenty times Nevers was sent
through the Santa Clara line, and
each time for a gain. Nevers hits the
line low and fast with all the push
which 225 pounds of beef allows. He
should increase his yardage consider
ably when he learns to take the extra
spurt after being tackled.
Merrill Armour probably played the
most spectacular game of any substi
tute tackle. He hit low, and fast, and
got down under punts with the speed
of an end. He downed the Santa Clara
safety man twice in his tracks. This
was Armour's first game for Stanford.
Murray Cuddeback went into Sat
urday's game after only four days of
practice. It was surprising therefore
to see him in an early come-back. His
pair of touchdowns more than justi
fies the fumble which cost Stanford
a score in the second quarter.
