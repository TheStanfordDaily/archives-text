# DICK LANG TURNS IN LOW GROSS SCORE OF 83 IN GOLF TOURNEY
## 
### 
Richard Lang, a freshman from
Portland, turned in the low gross
score in the qualifying round of the
second annual Stanford golf tourna
ment at the Burlingame country club
yesterday. Lang had a 44 going out
and a 39 coming in. Low net score
honors went to Tom Condit, who shot
86, but a handicap of 20 brought his
net down to 66. Lang will be pre
sented with a loving cup by Roos
Bros., and Wlison's will give a similar
cup to Condit.
Thirty-two golfers made the round,
and twenty-nine of them turned in
cards. These twenty-nine golfers were
divided into two flights, sixteen in
the championship flight, and thirteen
in the flrst flight, with three byes to
fill out the bracket. Match play will
start over the Burlingame course this
afternoon, if weather conditions per
mit.
Seven men turned in scores of less
than ninety yesterday. According to
Hirschman, this can be considered
good as the majority of the players
had never been over the Burlingame
course before. A high wind at times
during the afternoon also hindered
the work of the golfers. The greens
were the downfall of most of the
players, as three or four puts were
required to sink the ball. The cards
showed very few birdies.
Lang's 39 on the second nine was
the best score for nine holes. Ditzler
was low on the first nine with a 40,
but he failed to do so well on the sec
ond nine, his score being 44. Ditzler
had the second best gross—B4. Reg
Hirschman, captain of the golf team,
had a 4(5-41, for an 87. Other scores
under 90 were Clark, 41-48, 8; Hinkley,
45-44, 89; Chase, 46-42, 88.
Jim Clark shot better golf than his
score would indicate. He played the
.second nine first and on the tenth
hole ran into some bad luck, taking a
ten for the hole. He at once settled
down and finished the nine in 48.
