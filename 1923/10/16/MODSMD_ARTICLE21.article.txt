# INCINERATION OF THE BEAR
## 
### 
Some doubt has been expressed as to whether
the freshman class will build the bonfire this year.
The senior control committee has announced that
no "discipline" will be used to make the new men
work. Skeptics think that the class of '27 will take
this opportunity to get out of the effort entirely,
remembering how glad they were to escape the
loudmouthed tyranny of previous sophomore
"slave-drivers."
They totally forget that when a class can do
something of its own free will, through volunteer
effort, that the result is at least twice as good as
anything accomplished under threat of rah-rah
"discipline."
The Daily Palo Alto not only expects to see the
tradition of Berkeley's cremation carried out to the
last spark, but it is confident that this year's blaze,
because it will be built by the freshman class as an
independent group, will be the best bonfire the
campus has ever seen.
