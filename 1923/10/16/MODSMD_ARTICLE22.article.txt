# FREAK DANCES FOR FREAKS
## 
### 
At Oregon Agricultural College the Y. M. C. A.
has originated a new kind of freak dance. The
affair was a jolly-up given in eight parts of the
campus, with students divided alphabetically and
required to go wherever the organization in charge
allocated them.
Can any one see a scheme of that kind going
across on the Stanford campus? On the surface
it appears about as easy to enforce as the point
system, and about as sensible.
A jolly-up, as it has developed at Stanford, is
nothing more or less than an opportunity for one
group, the "drybawl" students, to walk on the feet
of people who would never in ordinary circum
stances wish to dance with them.
It is an opportunity for another group to see how
inebriated one can become and not be caught.
Between these two classes of male dancers women
who make the mistake of attending jolly-ups are
handed back and forth with no consideration of
their own wishes.
Several claim that there is an advantage in mak
ing happy acquaintances at a campus jolly-up. This
is partially true; one meets people at a jolly-up who
might have to be encountered at other places if one
is not fore-warned.
Aside from the freaks and the drunks, it is doubt
ful if an organization attempting O. A. C.'s varia
tion on the jolly-up could get much of an attendance.
