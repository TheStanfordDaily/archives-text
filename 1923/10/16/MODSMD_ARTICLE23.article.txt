Yesterday Babe Ruth came to hat in the last of
the eighth with three on bases, one out, and the

can public is not as fickle as has been charged, that
it really does stick by its favorites.
While consuming this sort of pink soda pop the
faithful forget that the Yanks won the scries in
spite of Ruth's whiffs. Wonder how popular Ruth
would he if the final had read: "4-1, Giants?"
