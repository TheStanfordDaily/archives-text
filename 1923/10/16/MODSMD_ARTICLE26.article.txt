# A 						WALL-FLOWER'S DREAM
## 
### 
1.
I'm tired of being by myself,
I'm coming down from off my shelf,
My high and dusty
Rather rusty
Somewhat musty
Frusty. shelf.
2.
I'm going to build a tropic isle,
Lure lovers there with dance and smile,
A joy-enhancing
Most entrancing
Muscle-dancing
Dance and smile.
3.
No discord will disturb my sway,
Because I'll always have my way,
My most potential
Preferential
Most essential
Selfish way.
4.
I'm going to blaze a vamoire's way,
(She awakens)
But I'll do this some other day,
In some far mazy
Distant, hazy.
Hot and lazy.
Summer's day. —H. M.

How much does a charcoal plant produce?—Jekyll.
Dear Jekyll: Kindly refer all questions of botany to
Botany department.—Ed.
Dear Ed: How long does twilight last?—Moonstruck.
Dear Moonstruck: Till night falls on it.
Dear Ed: What kind of a husband should I look for? —
Heart-ache.
Dear Headache: You better quit looking for any kind
of husbands. Find yourself a single man; there are
lots of them. —H. M.

Encina frosh equips his den with radio receiving
outfit, magnavox 'n everything. Bedtime stories every
night before his sponsor kisses him to sleep. In order
to keep up with this march of progress, it will probably
be necessary for the administration to install airplane
garages for the use of incoming freshmen next year.

With the coming of the idle winds of the ides of
October, the Engineers' corner is again in the mode as
a high-class lounging place for the ruff element of the
population.
