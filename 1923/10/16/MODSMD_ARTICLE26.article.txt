I'm tired of being by myself,
I'm coming down from off my shelf,
My high and dusty
Rather rusty
Somewhat musty
Frusty. shelf.
2.
I'm going to build a tropic isle,
Lure lovers there with dance and smile,
A joy-enhancing

Muscle-dancing

Because I'll always have my way,
My most potential

But I'll do this some other day,
In some far mazy
Distant, hazy.
Hot and lazy.
Summer's day. —H. M.

a high-class lounging place for the ruff element of the
