# MY ROOM-MATE
## 
### 
My room-mate was a perfect jewel.
He took the courses last year that I take this year.
He had a wonderful taste in neckties, cigars, and
socks.
He never wore purple pajamas.
He always got me up for eight o'clocks.
He never told me how much everyone around home
thought of him.
He laughed politely at all my jokes.
He never steered me into a blind date.
Once he lent, me his Tux.
Verily, my room-mate was a pearl of rarest lustre.
Too bad he flunked out last quarter.

Dear Cabbage Gentleman
I have been insulted.
I met a perfectly thrilling man last night. He danced
divinely, listened to me politely, and said I had won
derful eyes. He admired the way I did my hair, and
was charming.
Then he mentioned that he had been out with a high
school girl the night before.
I have been insulted.
Sincerely,
MURIEL.
