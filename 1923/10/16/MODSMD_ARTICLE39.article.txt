# LEET GIVES LINE ON PROSPECTS FOR BEAR '27 YEARLING ELEVEN
## 
### N. B. LEET 
Assistant Sports Editor, Daily
Californian ,
After watching California's fresh
man football team perform in three
contests against prep school elevens
this season, we are able to put forth
some comment on the apparent calibre
of this year's Blue and Gold babes.
Lowell High was the first team to
face the freshmen. They, had little
difficulty in disposing of the trans-bay
lads, and showed at times that they
had a certain amount of punch. The
following week, against Oakland
Tech, they won by a 52-to-0 count.
Tech's team was nothing to boast
about and the competition they fur
nished the babes was useless as far
as serving as a basis upon which to
rate the first-year team.
Last Saturday, Long Beach High op
posed the Cubs, and it was the first
time a good strong team had faced
them. As a result the babes won by a
two-touchdown margin. The prepsters
from the southern part of the state
were well-drilled for a high school ag
gregation, and took advantage of the
miscues of the freshmen.
One of the apparent faults of the
freshmen that has been noticeable on

certain occasions is their lack of the
final punch needed to make a touch
down when within striking distance.
This is hard to understand, when the
two hard-hitting backs, Jabs and
Cowes, are taken into consideration.
It is something that will doubtlessly
disappear as the season progresses,
but at present the case appears to be
such.
Fymbling seems to be the explana
tion. Either a bad pass from center or
"butterfingers" on the part of the man
designated to carry the ball has often
spoiled an opportunity for a tally this
semester. It is safe to say that Coaches
Nisbet and Clark will remedy this dif
ficulty.
The obviousness of speed in the
babe team is brought out in every con
test by the stellar work of Johnny
Clymer, quarterback. This boy has
sprinted and dodged through every

opposing aggregation this season.
Another gratifying thing about the
babes is to watch the ends and tackles i
get down after punts. Dick Blewett I
and Bob Green especially are right on
the spot and the opposing player who !
catches the ball hasn't much chance
to get away.
Speaking of kicks, Walkie Mills has
been doing this for the freshmen. Im- ;
provement in his work has been no- I
ticeable, and this Bruin Cub is averag- j
ing forty yards with consistency.
The first chance to compare the I
Blue and Gold with the Cardinal babes
will be obtained next Saturday when
the Cubs meet the California Aggies
on California field. The Aggies have
a strong team which defeated the
Stanford freshmen last week, 7 to 6.

spoiled an opportunity for a tally this
semester. It is safe to say that Coaches
Nisbet and Clark will remedy this dif
ficulty.
The obviousness of speed in the
babe team is brought out in every con
test by the stellar work of Johnny
Clymer, quarterback. This boy has
sprinted and dodged through every

opposing aggregation this season.
Another gratifying thing about the
babes is to watch the ends and tackles i
get down after punts. Dick Blewett I
and Bob Green especially are right on
the spot and the opposing player who !
catches the ball hasn't much chance
to get away.
Speaking of kicks, Walkie Mills has
been doing this for the freshmen. Im- ;
provement in his work has been no- I
ticeable, and this Bruin Cub is averag- j
ing forty yards with consistency.
The first chance to compare the I
Blue and Gold with the Cardinal babes
will be obtained next Saturday when
the Cubs meet the California Aggies
on California field. The Aggies have
a strong team which defeated the
Stanford freshmen last week, 7 to 6.

After watching California's fresh
man football team perform in three
contests against prep school elevens
this season, we are able to put forth
some comment on the apparent calibre
of this year's Blue and Gold babes.
Lowell High was the first team to
face the freshmen. They, had little
difficulty in disposing of the trans-bay
lads, and showed at times that they
had a certain amount of punch. The
following week, against Oakland
Tech, they won by a 52-to-0 count.
Tech's team was nothing to boast
about and the competition they fur
nished the babes was useless as far
as serving as a basis upon which to
rate the first-year team.
Last Saturday, Long Beach High op
posed the Cubs, and it was the first
time a good strong team had faced
them. As a result the babes won by a
two-touchdown margin. The prepsters
from the southern part of the state
were well-drilled for a high school ag
gregation, and took advantage of the
miscues of the freshmen.
One of the apparent faults of the
freshmen that has been noticeable on

certain occasions is their lack of the
final punch needed to make a touch
down when within striking distance.
This is hard to understand, when the
two hard-hitting backs, Jabs and
Cowes, are taken into consideration.
It is something that will doubtlessly
disappear as the season progresses,
but at present the case appears to be
such.
Fymbling seems to be the explana
tion. Either a bad pass from center or
"butterfingers" on the part of the man
designated to carry the ball has often
spoiled an opportunity for a tally this
semester. It is safe to say that Coaches
Nisbet and Clark will remedy this dif
ficulty.
