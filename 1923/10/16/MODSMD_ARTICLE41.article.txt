# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
If I were going in for any cham
pioning in this mighty Battle of the
Knicks, I'm afraid I'd have to be
championing a very new, strange, and
unpopular doctrine; its most concise
expression, so far as I know, can be
found in an obscure design sometimes
unearthed by antiquarians around the
University: "Die Luft der Freiheit
weht." Eh? Oh, you don't? I thought
so. It's unpatriotic, I suppose. Well, if
you MUST —translated with some free
dom into vernacular, it goes some
thing like this: "Any guy wot's got
sand enough in his bean to get to this
place at all ought to be let to do
pretty much as he dampleezes, just so
he don't damage no other guys."
But I'm not going to do any cham
pioning. It just struck me funny, and
I had to chortle aloud, to reflect that
in this year of grace 1923, after every
thing east of the Rockies and half
Europe had evolved, at last, something
comfortable and verging toward the
beautiful in men's dress —and been en
joying it for three years or so —that
a bunch of men-children should rise
up in the supposed Freedom of the
LOST—On Quad Wednesday, Oct. 10,
