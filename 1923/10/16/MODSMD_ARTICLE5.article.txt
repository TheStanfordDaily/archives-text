# ROW WOMEN MAY SEE FRESHMAN SISTERS CONFERENCE DECIDES
## 
### 
Sonority women who have sisters
entering the University this year will
be allowed to communicate with them
freely on neutral ground, according to
a revision made in the rushing rules
last night when Pan-Hellenic met with
Dean Mary Yost. Although visiting by
the sisters at either Roble Hall or the
sorority house is banned, unless con
sent by Pan-Hellenic is given, sisters
may telephone each other.
The Alumnae Board of Pan-Hellenic
will draw up regulations covering en-1
tertaining of new women by sorority
alumnae and faculty women who have
sorority connections. Such entertain- 1
ing is forbidden in the present con-;
tract but it was felt that the older
sorority members should be free if
they wished to help the new women |
adapt themselves to their new environ
ment. I
