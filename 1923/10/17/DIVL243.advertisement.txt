The object of the association is to provide programs by some of the
best artists who visit San Francisco each season, at a popular price, and
in our own Assembly Hall. Membership dues are $5.00 a year, entitling
the subscriber to two tickets for each of the four concerts, or 62%
cents a ticket. Make checques payable to the Peninsula Musical
Association.
Memberships will be received up to October 27, unless the house should
be sold out before that date; but intending subscribers are warned
against delaying, as the sale promises to be a large one this season, and
late subscribers will be obliged to choose between having their cheques
returned or accepting those inferior side-balcony seats not allotted to
regular subscribers.
For the convenience of campus residents, subscriptions will be received
and information furnished by the Stanford Bookstore; or applications
may be made directly to the assistant secretary.
