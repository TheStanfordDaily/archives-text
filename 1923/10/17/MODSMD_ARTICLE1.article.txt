# Win ROTH. DEANS, SPEAK AT ASSEMBLY
## Comptroller Says Students Pay for One-Fourth of Yearly Expenses 
### 
"Sometimes I think that we have
more trouble managing our 500 wo
men than our 2000 men," Dr. Wilbur
stated in opening the University as
sembly this morning.
Dean Yost, representing the women,
and Dean Culver, speaking for the
men, outlined their spheres of activity
in the University .both emphasizing
the fact that co-operation is necessary.
"It seems to me that the main work
of the Dean of Women is to help each
girl to get as much as possible from
her years in college. Scholarship is of
paramount importance, while the so
cial life also plays a very real part.
"Stanford was created not for the
men alone, or for the women alone, so
no interest is solely for one group.
We need the help of all for progress,"
concluded Dean Yost.
"Keep your ideals alive, adjust them
to University ideals, and don't be
narrow-minded," said Dean Culver.
"Be willing to give up some of your
own theories if you find better ones
to take their place.
"I hope to turn out a certain type of
Stanford man. He must have an alert,
rententive mind, open to new and
worth-while things, and above private
prejudice. He must possess the ideal
of service and be on the way toward
becoming an expert in his chosen
line."
In speaking of the University fees
Comptroller Roth said: "Other uni
versities have larger endowments, but
Stanford tuition iaÂ» comparatively low.
Students here pay only twenty-six per
cent of the total yearly expenses of
$2,000,000. At the University of Chi
cago tuition covers forty-three per
cent of expenditures."
Roth discussed financial aspects of
the pavilion, the new co-operative
store, and the Stanford Union. It is
planned that these last two money
making ventures shall pay for the
others.
