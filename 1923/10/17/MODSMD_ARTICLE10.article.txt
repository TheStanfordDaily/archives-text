## Katherine Wisner McCluskey Reads Short Plays in Little Theater 
### Katherine Capell 
Poetic appreciation of literary value
rather than any great dramatic abil
ity, distinguished the work of Mrs.
Katherine Wisner McCluskey, director
of the Expression department of the
School of Allied Arts, Phoenix, Ariz,,
who read ''Trifles," "The Philosophy
of Butterbiggens," and "The Slave
with Two Faces," to a large audience
yesterday evening.
"Trifles," by Susan Glaspell, the
well-known American authoress, is a
weird tragedy dealing with the psy
chology of a woman who murdered
her husband. In the opening scene,
Mrs. McCluskey's interpretation did
not differentiate clearly between the
characters, as her voice does not lend
itself readily to a diversity of mascu
line parts. In spite of this difficulty
the reader held the interest of her
audience by her sincere and natural
rendering of the feminine parts.
"The Philosophy of Butterbiggens"
was written by Harold Chapin, a young
British author, who was killed in the
World War: It is a Scotch dialect
story, with the scena laid in Butter
biggens, a suburb of Glasgow. The
combination of humor and pathos re
minds one of Barrie. Mrs. McCluskey's
reading of "The Philosophy of Butter
biggens" was her best interpretation
of the evening a forceful and convinc
ing portrayal.
Mary Carolyn Davies' "The Slave
with Two Faces" is a symbolic drama
in which Life is depicted as a beauti
ful slave, who, if given an opportunity,
will become an ugly master. "Never
kneel to Life" is the lesson of the
play, embodied in the advice of one
maiden to another, who disregards
the warning and is made a slave. Mrs.
McCluskey verged on hte melodra
matic in her rendition of "The Slave
with Two Faces." Her gestures were
trite and unnatural. One missed the
fine sincerity of her first two readings.
