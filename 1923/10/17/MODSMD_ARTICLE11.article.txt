# DEBATE CANDIDATES TO TRY OUT FRIDAY IN LITTLE THEATER
## 
### 
Tryouts for the triangular debate
with California and U. S. C. on No
vember 20 will be held Friday in the
Little Theater at 2 p. ra. under the
direction of Professor J. G. Emerson,
debating coach. The names of candi
dates for places on the team were
handed in to Professor Emerson Mon
day, and those who have not yet noti
fied him of their intention to enter
the trials on Friday should do so at
once.
The question to be argued is: "Re
solved, That the syndicalism laws of
California should be abolished." Vot
ing on the outcome of the debate will
not be done by appointed judges as
before, but by the audience, each mem
ber of which will be given a ballot as
he enters the auditorium. After the
ballots have been cast and while the
votes are being counted, the audience
will be permitted to ask questions of 1
an appointed member of each team
and to argue the question again from
the floor. In this way it is hoped to
get a more interested group of
listeners. v
"By letting the audience vote, we
are getting nearer the purpose of de
bating," said Professor Emerson. "I
believe that each one will cast an
impartial, unprejudiced vote. Even if
there i3 some discrepancy in the vot
ing, the teams will develop a spirit
to debate well rather than too much
care for the actual outcome."
The exact date of the annual Joffre
debate will be announced in Decem-
ber. The Tri-state debate with Oregon
and Washington will be held the first
Friday in March. An extemporaneous
speaking contest will also be held in
Eugene, Ore., during the Thanksgiving
vacation. The question to be discussed
and the date for tryouts will be an
nounced later.
Possibilities for a debate with an
eastern college are under considera
tion, and some agreement may be
reached in the near future between
Harvard, California, and Stanford for
Harvard to come to the coast.
Freshman debating will start soon,
according to Professor Emerson. As
yet no freshman debating committee
has been appointed. As soon as that
is done, a team will be selected from
tryouts to challenge the California
freshmen during the winter quarter.
Freshmen are not eligible for varsity
competition.
