## 
### 
Cardinal track stars entered in the
pre-Olympic games to be held by the
American Legion on the University
of California oval next Thursday af
ternoon are expected to make a good
showing against the keen competition
which national champions of several
events will provide.
varsity miles, may be pitted in the
track team last year, and A1 Charles,
varsity miler, will be pitted in the
mile-run against Joie Ray, national
champion.
A long-lived feud, the coals of which
aro still burning, will be resumed
when Morris Kirksey, former Stan
ford sprinter, and Charles Paddock,
national sprint champion, meet in the
dashes. Paddock previously has held
the "jinx" on Kirksey, and has man
aged to nose out the Stanford "flash"
in every race in which they have com
peted. Kirksey, in his recent trip to
Australia, defeated W. C. Carr, Anti
podean champion, and for this reason
and the fact that Kirksey is reported
to be in excellent training, many be
lieve that he may be the victor.
Marshal Hale and lan Campbell are
also entered in the sprints.
Frank Hayes, Stanford two-miler,
is entered in the five-mile run against
Clarence H. de Mar, Massachusetts;
George Bertsch, New York; A. R.
Broom, Ohio; Charlie Hunter, San
Francisco Olympic Club, and Paul Nei
man of California.
