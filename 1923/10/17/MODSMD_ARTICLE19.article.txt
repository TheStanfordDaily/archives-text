# PERMANENT BASKETBALL BLEACHERS?
## 
### 
More seats inside of the basketball pavilion might
be a good thing, and it might not. Some say the
change will reduce the floor space and make the
pavilion a little stadium. Others think that is what
the pavilion is for.
Anyhow, now is the time for students, who are
part owners of this building, to express their opinion
instead of waiting until the proposed alterations have
been completed. Adverse criticism will not avail
then.
Architects are now preparing plans suggested by
Graduate Manager Paul Davis for the erection of
permanent bleachers to extend from the balconies
to the steel girders, with similar construction at the
east end of the pavilion. According to Comptroller
Roth, one-third of the present floor space would be
covered by this solid, U-shaped structure, rising
from three sides of the basketball court, even with
the girders and twenty feet from the east end of the
building.
The principal advantages of permanent bleachers
are better facilities for handling large crowds and
an increased seating capacity, estimated at 1200.
It would be possible to reserve all seats, thus obvi
ating to some extent the cramped conditions usually
existing at big games. By putting up additional
basket standards two cross courts might be used in
basketball practice.
Now for the disadvantages. The pavilion was
built by the University and students not only for
the purpose of providing an excellent playing floor
for intercollegiate basketball contests, but equally
to furnish adequate facilities for large social func
tions. Here is no conflict between athletics and
dances. In the words of Davis, "Stanford athletics
are not affected by this plan."
There are only four basketball games, those with
California and U. S. C., which tax the capacity of
the pavilion. The increased efficiency in accommo
dating spectators at about four games played within
a few months must be set off against the undoubted
* lessened value of the pavilion as a center for holding
large student and alumni affairs, such as the cotillion,
prom, alumni dinner, and other social functions
during the entire college year.
Those who are against the change urge that re
taining the temporary bleachers, unsatisfactory as
they may be, will prevent any chance impairment of
the usefulness or beauty of the pavilion. —R. E.
