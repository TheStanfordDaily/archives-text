# PRACTICE FOR ROOTERS
## 
### 
Stanford rooters as yet don't know a great deal
about their team.
Neither do they know a great deal about the
yells and songs by which they express their confi
dence in that team.
They haven't had any chances to practice those
yells so that they will sound like the single voice
of Stanford to the men down on the field.
Tomorrow trucks will carry the rooters down to
the stadium for the first bleacher rally of the year.
The team will stage a scrimmage, an orchestra
will make appropriate noises, and several stunts arc
programmed.
The crowd will practice songs and yells.
The crowd will also, by its numbers, express the
confidencc of the student body in the team's ability
to wipe up Occidental at Los Angeles.
Stanford rooters always give their team their
whole-hearted, confident, intelligent support.
O. E. D.
