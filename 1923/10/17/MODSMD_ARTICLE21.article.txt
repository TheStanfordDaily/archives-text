We like to write free verse —perhaps you have noticed
that. It's free because you can't sell it. It doesn't have
to mean anything. And you don't have to look up any
words in the rhyming dictionary.
Here's our latest aberration:
HEIROGLYPIIICS
Mud.
Mud was scattered all over the place.
It was as gloomy as pink oranges in a drug store.
A man in horn-rims sat on an ashcan.
He was staring at a brick wall. "Don't
. You see inspiration here?"
I said
I didn't
"This brick wall is like an Eskimo goddess
With bare feet, drinking tea on a horse-hair
Sofa," he said.
I shoved him into the goo
And agreed with him.
I thank you.

Right at the start you want to get rid of any idea
that this issue of Cabbages is any advertising proposi
tion, like "Football Extra With Each Tennis Racquet
Bought" or "Football Extra Well Made, Cheap." We
just want to get you on the boat on the sporting situa
tion, that's all.
Last Saturday Stanford clashed with Santa Clara in
a grid tilt and downed the Missions to the tune of 55-6.
On the same day Harvard tied with the Middlebury
collegians 6-6. Does that mean anything to you? If so,
drop this department a post card about it, and we can
probably fix you up with a steady job for each Monday.
Well, here's what it should mean to you—it means that
Harvard didn't do anything like as well as we did, and
if that doesn't show conclusively the West's superiority
in all branches of sport, what does;
Then again, California crushed the powerful Olympic
contingent 16-0. Surely by this time you ought to be
able to see what we're driving at. But unless you're a
close observer you probably didn't notice that Indiana
beat Northwestern 7-6 —and on the very same date!
What was the margin in the California game? Figure
it out for yourself—we got sixteen when we tried it.
Well, what was the difference in scores in the Indiana-
Northwestern game? That's it —the little boy in the
third row got it. And how did you do it, my little man?
By subtraction? My, My! That ought to be a lesson to
% you econ majors.
In other words, California is just sixteen times better
than Indiana, in spite of what the Indianapolis Chamber
of Commerce says about their real estate rates. Just
think of that —a football game between California and
i Indiana in which eleven stalwart Bruins have to play
one hundred and seventy-six Indiana players to make
a fair thing of it!
Just imagine the Indiana captain calling his team
back for a conference and being trampled to death in
the rush. And suppose the Indiana coach got desperate
and sent in an extra man, and the Indiana boys kept
rushing around so that the referee couldn't count them
—first he'd count a hundred and seventy-two, and then
a hundred and eighty, and by and by he'd just have to
give it up, it would be such a job—and think of the
honest California boys, all unsuspecting of this low
trick, striving valiantly but unavailinglv to keep the
colors of their Alma Mater from getting dragged in the
muck and mire of defeat.
And think of the final score—California 0, Indiana
1-177, or .00639 —and how the California rooting section
would hang its head in shame while the balance of the
Indiana student body, brazenly unashamed, both of
them, serpentined.
Think about that all you want to —it's all right with
us. —M. E.

Right at the start you want to get rid of any idea
that this issue of Cabbages is any advertising proposi
tion, like "Football Extra With Each Tennis Racquet
Bought" or "Football Extra Well Made, Cheap." We
just want to get you on the boat on the sporting situa
tion, that's all.
Last Saturday Stanford clashed with Santa Clara in
a grid tilt and downed the Missions to the tune of 55-6.
On the same day Harvard tied with the Middlebury
collegians 6-6. Does that mean anything to you? If so,
drop this department a post card about it, and we can
probably fix you up with a steady job for each Monday.
Well, here's what it should mean to you—it means that
Harvard didn't do anything like as well as we did, and
if that doesn't show conclusively the West's superiority
in all branches of sport, what does;
Then again, California crushed the powerful Olympic
contingent 16-0. Surely by this time you ought to be
able to see what we're driving at. But unless you're a
close observer you probably didn't notice that Indiana
beat Northwestern 7-6 —and on the very same date!
What was the margin in the California game? Figure
it out for yourself—we got sixteen when we tried it.
Well, what was the difference in scores in the Indiana-
Northwestern game? That's it —the little boy in the
third row got it. And how did you do it, my little man?
By subtraction? My, My! That ought to be a lesson to
% you econ majors.
In other words, California is just sixteen times better
than Indiana, in spite of what the Indianapolis Chamber
of Commerce says about their real estate rates. Just
think of that —a football game between California and
i Indiana in which eleven stalwart Bruins have to play
one hundred and seventy-six Indiana players to make
a fair thing of it!
Just imagine the Indiana captain calling his team
back for a conference and being trampled to death in
the rush. And suppose the Indiana coach got desperate
and sent in an extra man, and the Indiana boys kept
rushing around so that the referee couldn't count them
—first he'd count a hundred and seventy-two, and then
a hundred and eighty, and by and by he'd just have to
give it up, it would be such a job—and think of the
honest California boys, all unsuspecting of this low
trick, striving valiantly but unavailinglv to keep the
colors of their Alma Mater from getting dragged in the
muck and mire of defeat.
And think of the final score—California 0, Indiana
1-177, or .00639 —and how the California rooting section
would hang its head in shame while the balance of the
Indiana student body, brazenly unashamed, both of
them, serpentined.
Think about that all you want to —it's all right with
us. —M. E.

We like to write free verse —perhaps you have noticed
that. It's free because you can't sell it. It doesn't have
to mean anything. And you don't have to look up any
words in the rhyming dictionary.
Here's our latest aberration:
HEIROGLYPIIICS
Mud.
Mud was scattered all over the place.
It was as gloomy as pink oranges in a drug store.
A man in horn-rims sat on an ashcan.
He was staring at a brick wall. "Don't
. You see inspiration here?"
I said
I didn't
"This brick wall is like an Eskimo goddess
With bare feet, drinking tea on a horse-hair
Sofa," he said.
I shoved him into the goo
And agreed with him.
