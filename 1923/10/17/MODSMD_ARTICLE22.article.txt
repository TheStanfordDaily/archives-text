# THE 						CHANGING PAVILION
## 
### 
There is prevailing discontent over the fact that the
Executive Committee has authorized the construction
of permanent seats in the Basketball Pavilion, thus re
stricting by about pne-third the space that can be used
for dances, alumni reunions, and other all-University
functions; but the strange thing about it is that all the
complainants are willing to do is sit back and complain.
The Executive Committee probably debated the mat
ter hotly enough before the final decision was reached;
and we might give them credit for doing what they
thought best for the student body. Those who do not
like the action the committee took can do more than
merely deprecate with sad gestures the terrible thing
that has been done.
Truly, the pavilion has not the staging of basketball
games as its sole end. The Prom, the Cotillion, the
Alumni Reunion Dinner, All-University Jolly-Ups, all
will suffer from restriction of space consequent upon
the installation of permanent seats. Those who remem
ber the furore raised over the action of the Junior Prom
committee last year in allowing such a large crowd in
the Pavilion may well wonder what tickets will sell for
three years from now with only two-thirds of the former
space available. A scalper's paradise, perhaps.
The objection to temporary bleachers seems to be that
unless they are moved out after each varsity game, there
will not be room for two practice courts. Obviously,
continued shifting of seats would be expensive and
ruinous to the floor.
But with a little thought, it might be able to work
out a very satisfactory method of handling temporary
bleachers. They will be put in anyway when the Cali
fornia games come around, new additions or no new
additions.
Which is the greater menace —insufficient room for
social affairs or insufficient room for basketball crowds?
The question might as well be faced now. However, It i
will behoove those who do not wish permanent additions
to the pavilion to move quickly, for construction is to
begin soon. —DR. JEKYLL.
