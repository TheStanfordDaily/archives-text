# A 						WOMAN SAYS

The "rough" is the backbone of
Stanford! Yet how many Stanford wo
men will agree as to the truth of this
statement? Many think that the
"rough" holds no place on the campus
â€”he is superfluous because he isn't
of the "queener" variety. But there
are others who vouch for him.
The Stanford "roughs" consist of
about three-quarters of all Stanford
men, while the remaining one-fourth
may be classed as "queeners." One
may not think that the rough-looking
students in cords and slouchy coats
who Stare at dancers through the
clubhouse windows are as important
as the slick young men with whom
the women dance. Yet, if one stops
to analyze, one may ask: What would
happen to college if all of its men
were of the "snake" variety? What
parts would scholarship, athletics,
journalism, and other worth-while pur
suits play in college life? If one looks
up the average young man of the lat
ter class in the bawl-out, one is likely
to find him on probation, and the or
dinary "tea-hound" can not keep train
ing and be fit for athletics. After all,
what good is the campus snake, unless
to amuse the few girls on the campus,
especially the new ones?
The blame for existence of the
"rough" can only be given to those
who allow 500 women and 2000 men
to attend Stanford. It is only natural
that the "rough" should have evolved
under these conditions. One finds it
so on no other campus. All newcomers
gasp in amazement at the hordes of
roughly-dressed young men crowding
porch and windows at any campus
dance. One wonders how they dare in
trude uninvited yet one soon realizes
that the presence of the "rough" is
the determining factor of whether or
not the dance is a success.
Of course there are many of the 1500
"roughs" who do not care to queen,
who feel that they cannot do their col
lege work justice if they do so; but
there are many others who are na
turally "woman-haters." This is prob
ably due to the fact that they asked
for several dates, and were refused
by the girl in question, because she
was kept so busy by the many other
young men of the campus. Because of
this, they retire to the ranks of the
"rough," nurturing a supposed wrong
which was really the fault of no one,
and so henceforth, gaze at frivol
ity through the window pane and
never again tries to date up a Stan
ford woman.
Therefore, if one would seek the
really worth-while men at Stanford,
one must remember that "all is not
gold that glitters" and that there is
often the 'diamond in the 'rough'."
