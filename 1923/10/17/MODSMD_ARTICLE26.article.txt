# Arrangement of Art Exhibit Is Profession Itself, Says Lemos

"The good arrangement of an art
exhibit is a profession in itself," says
John T. Lemos, director of the Stan
ford Art Gallery.
"Few people visiting art galleries
realize the time and effort that go
into the proper presentation of an
art exhibit. In addition to arranging
a varied collection of exhibitions,
there remains the careful packing, ar
rangements for insurance, the proper
hanging, and the naming of pictures.
In the old days of the masters many
wordy wars resulted from the hang
ing of rival masterpieces. Whistler
was one of the men who properly
realized the importance of the correct
hanging of his works ,and he often
had upholstery or drapes in the gal
leries changed in order to display his
pictures in the best light.
Sunlight Is Important
"In addition to arranging the pic
tures there are many details that an
artist must know in order to take
proper care of the works of art that
are in his possession, if only for a
short time. Few people realize that
sunlight kills the tints in water color
pictures while it gives life to the
works done in oil.
'Owners of rare prints often find
that in time, brown mildew spots ap
pear on the surface of the prints. If
left to stay, these spots in time eat
into the prints and ruin them. The
proper way to protect such prints is

to remove them from the frame and
expose them to warm sunlight for sev
eral hours. This will counteract the
moisture which accumulates beneath
the glass in framed pictures. It is this
moisture which causes mildew and
spots.
Put Pastels Under Glass
"Pastels are best protected when
under glass. Until framed, pastel
sketches are easily carried between
the pages of an ordinary magazine.
The glazed surface of the magazine
paper does not absorb color from the
pastels, thus making it ideal for such
a purpose.
"Many other similar ideas are part
of the necessary knowledge of the pro
fessional artist, such as the restoring
of paintings, bringing back the lustre,
and preventing canvas cracks. In most
countries, particularly those of Eu
rope, there are artists who make a
life study of old paintings and spend
their time restoring and taking care
of valuable collections."
