# PROFESSOR WING DESIGNS GREATEST RADIO IN WORLD
## Federal Telegraph Company To Erect Seven Towers at Shanghai, China 
### 
"The wireless station to be erected
soon for commercial purposes at
Shanghai, China, will be the largest
that has ever been constructed," says
Charles B. Wing, Professor of Struc
tural Engineering at the University.
Professor Wing, acting in the capacity
of consulting engineer for the Federal
Telegraph Company, is designing the
1000 feet guyed steel masts for this
station. He also designed the bay mast
for the Marsh Radio Transmitting sta
tion near Palo Alto, which is owned
and operated by the Federal Telegraph
Company of San Francisco.
Will Have Seven Masts
'The Shanghai Radio Transmitting
Station will have seven guyed steel
masts similar to the one at the Marsh
Transmitting Station, except that they
will have a height of 1000 feet instead
of G26 feet. These masts will be spaced
three-fifths of a mile apart and will
coverian area of more than one square
mile. The power of the Shanghai
Radio Transmitting Station will be
about 50 per cent greater than that of
any that has been erected. At the
present time, the Lafayette station,
near Bordeaux, France, erected by the
American government and now owned
by the French government, is the
most powerful in existence.
"The high power radio transmitting
station at Shanghai, requiring the
seven 1000 feet guyed steel structures,
is being built for the Chinese govern
ment and will provide direct continu
ous communication with the Pacific
coast of the United States and with
all European countries. The distance
from Shanghai, China, to San Fran
cisco, is T. 327 nautical miles, and that
from Shanghai to Bordeaux, France,
5247 nautical miles.
Work Begins Soon
"Work on the masts for the Shang
hai Transmitting Station will begin
soon and their erection should be com
pleted within a period of one year.
"Popular conception of radio tele
graphy today consists largely of the
idea of broadcasting," says Professor
Wing, "when in reality broadcasting
amounts to very little economically in
comparison to the significance of wire
less telegraphy in commerce and com
munications.
Wireless Better Than Cables
"The aim of commercial wireless
telegraphy is to establish long dis
tance communication without the aid
of long and expensive trans-oceanic
cables. When a cable breaks, ships
have to go out and search for the
break, haul up the cable and repair
it. These repairs occasion long delays,
as a rule, and the operation is ex
pensive. On the other hand, such re
pairs as may be necessary on long
distance radio telegraph stations are
only a, question of a few hours. The
continuity of commercial service is,
therefore, improved greatly.
"A year ago last winter at the time
of the sleet storm on the Pacific coast,
the radio transmitting station of the
Federal Telegraph Company at Port- j
land, Ore., in which one guyed steel
mast 626 feet high is used to support
the antennae, was the only means of
communication north and south on
this coast for several days. At the
same time, the mast at the Marsh
radio station stood firmly, although
the wind velocity was terrific. These
two stations, therefore, completed tbe
telegraph circuit from central Call-1
fornia to the Northwest when all other
means of communication were cut off
by the severe storm.
Japanese Quake News by Radio
'In the recent Japanese earthquake,
the first news of it came through the
radio station in Japan. This station
was undamaged by the earthquake.
"The Federal Telegraph Company
was one of the pioneers in the field
of commercial radio telegraphy. C. F. |
Elwell, '07, connected with the com
pany for a number of years, was the
first to demonstrate its commercial
possibilities by practical tests. He
first experimented from the Univer- i
sity to Palo Alto, then from Palo Alto
to Los Altos, and later the Federal
Telegraph Company erected stations
at Sacramento, Stockton, and the pres- i
ent Beach station at San Francisco.
Alumnus First to Make Tests
"Elwell began his work about 1908, t

and continued development with addi
tional stations at South San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and Honolulu. The South
San Francisco and Honolulu stations
provided the first commercial radio
telegraphic service between the Pa
cific coast and the Hawaiian Islands.
All of these stations were operated by
the Federal Telegraph Company until
the entrance of this country into the
recent war, at which time they were
taken over and operated by the United
States government.
"Since the war radio telegraphy has
received additional cognition as a
factor in commercial enterprise and
has developed rapidly as such.
"The Shanghai transmitting station
represents the greatest step that has
ever been made in commercial radio
telegraphic communication, since the
distances over which the service will
be given exceed 5000 nautical
miles and are approximately 40 per
cent greater than the distances over
which any other commercial circuits
are now operating."
