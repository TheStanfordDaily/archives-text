# Junior College Will Be Discussed by J. B. Sears
## 
### 
"The Junior College in California"
will be the subject of a talk by Pro
fessor J. B. Sears of the Department
of Education at a meeting of Nestoria
debating society tonight at 7:30 in
Room 12 of the Law building. An open
forum on the question will be held
at the conclusion of Professor Sears'
lecture.
The advent of the junior college has
been a comparatively recent develop
ment in California. It furnishes the
equivalent of the first two years of a
college education. Many educators ad
vocate that our already over-taxed uni
versities do away with the first two
years' curriculua and accept only
upperclass and graduate students.
Visitors are invited to attend the
meeting this evening.
