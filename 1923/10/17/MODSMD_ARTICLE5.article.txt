# ZIMBALIST TO GIVE FIRST P. M. A. CONCERT
## 
### 
Efrem Zimbalist, noted violinist, will
give a recital at the Assembly hall on
Thursday evening, November 15, as
the opening attraction of the Penin
sula Musical Association's concert
series.
Zimbalist is an artist who has con
stantly gained favor with the Ameri
can concert public since his debut
more than ten years ago. Both pro
fessional and lay verdicts place him
among the few great artists who
emerge from the throng of minor
violinists touring the country each sea
son.
Like most of the eminent violinists
now before the public, Zimbalist is a
pupil of Leopold Auer. Critics declare
him more than a mere technician â€”a
musician of profound knowledge and
deep inspiration, possessing a distinct
individuality which puts him in a class
by himself.
His tone is said by older concert
goers to possess much of the quality
which made Wilhelm famous.
Those who wish to subscribe to the
concert series are requested to send
in their ckecks to Mrs. Robert G. Rey
nolds, assistant secretary.
