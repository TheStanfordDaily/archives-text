# Hubert Finds New Joy; Dull Sundays Are Gone
## 
### 
At last, Hubert, the campus athlete,
will be made contented.
For a long time, Hubert complained
of the dullness of his Sundays. "Queen
ing," reading, or even studying on
Sundays, never seemed to hold Hu
bert's interest. What he wanted was
action, and even after trying crochet
ing, ping-pong, and washing the neigh
borhood dog, he was still perfectly
miserable.
But now comes the announcement
that Encina gymnasium will be open
Sunday mornings from 9 to 12. Hubert
has brightened up already with this
wonderful news. Perhaps he really did
want some exercise on Sundays, to
keep him in perfect condition for his
regular Monday morning cuts. At any
rate, however, Hubert will be "at
home" over at the gym every Sunday
now —skipping flat rocks over the
swimming pool, roller skating on the
handball courts, or maybe even beat
ing the dust out of the wrestling mats.
But he will be happy, anyway.
