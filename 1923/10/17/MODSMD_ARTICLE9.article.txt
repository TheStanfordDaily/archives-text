# THREE ARTICLES ON FRESHMEN IN NEXT ILLUSTRATED ISSUE
## 
### 
Three articles relative to the con
trol and activities of the incoming
freshman will be the leading stories
in the first issue of the Illustrated Re
view, which will make its appearance
on the campus Thursday.
The first article is entitled " '27 Was
Born with a Silver Spoon in Its
Mouth" and shows the increased ad
vantages new men have over the pre
ceding classes. It takes up the housing
and eating arrangements for first-year
men as well as other provisions made
by the University for their comfort.
A complete story of the mud battle
held at Lagunita between the fresh
men and sophomores will be run. Some
discussion is here given of the appear
ance of the fray from the sidelines
and the possibilities of the mud scrap
as an annual affair.
The third one of the series will be
a signed story by Louis Gaspar, presi
dent of the Sophomore Class, dealing
with the sophomore attitude toward
freshmen and their control'.
"The class of 1926 is through with
freshman discipline" says Gaspar. "We
feel that the freshmen should assume
their part as Stanford men as soon as
possible. Success of the new system of
senior control rests with the freshmen
themselves. The paddle no longer
waves, but ridicule and contempt will
run rampant if the new plans do not
work out. To wear the "dink" is an
honor not every high school man is
privileged to have; but it will be no
honor unless the first-year men make a
reputation as a class."
I. J. Russel, '04, has written a thor
ough review of Dr. Jordan's autobio
graphy. Russell has served on the
staffs of a number of New York news
papers during the past few years.
