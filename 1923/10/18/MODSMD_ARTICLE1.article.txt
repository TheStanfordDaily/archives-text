# STUDENT BODY TO VOTE ON ERECTION OF PAVILION SEATS
## Referendum Petition Forces Ex Committee to Put Plan on Ballot 
### 
The student body will be given a I
chance to vote on the erection of per-1
manent bleachers in the basketball
pavilion at a special election a week i
from today.
A referendum petition on the Execu
tive committee's authorization of the
construction was circulated last night j
in Toyon and Encina halls and two;
fraternities. Pifty-two names were ob
tained, fifty being necessary to put the
measure on the ballot
Those signing the petition say that >
the plan was approved without giving
the student body a chance to voice its;
opinion.
The measure was passed by the Exe
cutive committee on recommendation
of Comptroller Roth and Graduate
Manager Davis, after several plans for
additional seats were considered.
Immovable bleachers extending nine
feet from the present balconies to the
steel uprights, and ending in a four
foot wall around three sides of the
floor, are called for.
The seats would be in the shape of
a U, the kitchen entrance being left
free. At the other end the four-foot
wall would be twenty feet from the
building wall.
1200 More Accommodated
Twelve hundred more people may
be accommodated by the plan. Advo
cates argue that this will aid in seat- >
ing at four big basketball games, two j
with U. S. C. and two with California, j
One-third of the floor space will be I
cut off for dancing purposes if the j
bleachers are constructed. This will af- j
feet two dances, the sophomore cotil- j
lion and the junior prom.
At the same election the point sys-,
tem restricting student activities will
be referred to the student vote and
two men for the Union Board of Gov
ernors. A vice-president of the A. S. J
S. U. will also be elected. Herbert:
Hoover is now serving by temporary
appointment, of the Executive com
mittee.
Point System Up for Recall
The section of the Student Body
Constitution providing for a point sys
tem. to be put up for recall, is: "Arti
cle V. of Section 4. The Executive j
Committee shall provide for the main-j
tenance of a card index file of every;
student in the University, this file to
contain data respecting the student's
extra-curriculum activities, and to be
kept up to date at each meeting of
the Executive Committee, one of the
salaried officers of the Association be- i
ing responsible for its maintenance."
Two assistant yell leaders will be
chosen from the present six trycutees. j
Reasons given by student leaders
for the recall of the section of the
constitution providing for the point
system in activities are, that the sys
tem requires too much time and ex- J
pense, and that it is impractical.
The original idea of the article was
to distribute offices among more of
the students, a plan tried by other
universities with doubtful success, ac
cording to information from colleges
where the plan was tried. A two-thirds
majority of the votes cast is neces
sary to pass the amendment.
The nomination box for vice-presi
dent of the A. S. S. U. will be placed
in the Romanic Languages building
tomorrow at 10 o'clock, to remain un
til Tuesday at 8 p.m. Candidates will
have till Wednesday to withdraw.
The election will be held Thursday
from 8:45 a.m. until 2 p.m.
Construction ql permanent bleach
ers will be of value to the basketball
team, according to J. C. McHose, bas
ketball captain.
Walt to Aid Basketball
"The erection of the wall will be of
considerable aid to the basketball men
in their games," he said. By the con
struction of a few rows of temporary
bleachers in addition to the new
bleachers 200 more people can be ac
commodated than at present.
"Dancing will not be particularly
restricted since very few people ever
dance outside of the girders anyway.
Besides, it will be almost impossible
to accommodate more than 500 cou
ples on the floor at any time, since
the provision for food, music, and
other entertainment can not be easily
arranged. Decoration of the pavilion
would be made easier, and, for such
entertainments as the Alumni dinner,
tables can be erected in the balconies
giving a terrace effect and removing

the congestion on the dancing floor.
The balconies can also be used for
seating the dancers instead of the
benches on the main floor used at
present." *
Bob Cravens favored the construc
tion of temporary bleachers which
could be removed at will.
"I prefer temporary bleachers since
the pavilion will be good only for bas
ketball and small dances with the
permanent seats as suggested," he
said. "We could have no more big
dances or jolly-ups with the restricted
dancing space.
Indoor Track Prevented
"The pavilion was constructed to
serve for many purposes which would
be defeated by the present plan."
Cravens spoke of an idea for an
I indoor running track to be built in
the pavilion but the new bleachers

would prevent the plan.
"It seems to me that temporary
bleachers would give as much seating
capacity without sacrificing the social
uses of the pavilion," said Carl Shoup,
editor of the 1924 Quad. "The pavilion
is hardly large enough ilow and per
manent bleachers will hurt the social
side more than the temporary ones
will harm basketball."
Dan Gage, Senior Class president,
said permanent bleachers on the ends
with temporary ones on the side would
solve the present difficulties.
"We will never have enough space
for our dances with permanent bleach
ers; we should put up temporary
stands instead," said Alice Roth, presi
dent of the Associated Women Stu
dents.
"I am against permanent balconies,"
said "Bud" Woodward, president of

Skull and Snakes. "Temporary bleach- J
ers should solve the problem."
"With temporary stands we can re
tain the large floor space for dances
and for the big 'S' rallies," said
"Scotchy" Campbell, captain of the
football team. "Since the pavilion was
built for entertainments as well as
basketball, we should consider the
advantages and disadvantages to both
in erecting the new stands."

pavilion at a special election a week i
from today.
A referendum petition on the Execu

construction was circulated last night j
in Toyon and Encina halls and two;
fraternities. Pifty-two names were ob
tained, fifty being necessary to put the
measure on the ballot
Those signing the petition say that >
the plan was approved without giving
the student body a chance to voice its;
opinion.
The measure was passed by the Exe
cutive committee on recommendation
of Comptroller Roth and Graduate
Manager Davis, after several plans for
additional seats were considered.
Immovable bleachers extending nine
feet from the present balconies to the
steel uprights, and ending in a four
foot wall around three sides of the
floor, are called for.
The seats would be in the shape of
a U, the kitchen entrance being left
free. At the other end the four-foot
wall would be twenty feet from the
building wall.
1200 More Accommodated
Twelve hundred more people may
be accommodated by the plan. Advo
cates argue that this will aid in seat- >
ing at four big basketball games, two j
with U. S. C. and two with California, j
One-third of the floor space will be I
cut off for dancing purposes if the j
bleachers are constructed. This will af- j

Point System Up for Recall
The section of the Student Body
Constitution providing for a point sys
tem. to be put up for recall, is: "Arti
cle V. of Section 4. The Executive j
Committee shall provide for the main-j
tenance of a card index file of every;
student in the University, this file to
contain data respecting the student's
extra-curriculum activities, and to be
kept up to date at each meeting of
the Executive Committee, one of the
salaried officers of the Association be- i
ing responsible for its maintenance."
Two assistant yell leaders will be
chosen from the present six trycutees. j
Reasons given by student leaders
for the recall of the section of the
constitution providing for the point
system in activities are, that the sys
tem requires too much time and ex- J
pense, and that it is impractical.
The original idea of the article was
to distribute offices among more of
the students, a plan tried by other
universities with doubtful success, ac
cording to information from colleges
where the plan was tried. A two-thirds
majority of the votes cast is neces
sary to pass the amendment.
The nomination box for vice-presi
dent of the A. S. S. U. will be placed
in the Romanic Languages building
tomorrow at 10 o'clock, to remain un

Walt to Aid Basketball
"The erection of the wall will be of
considerable aid to the basketball men
in their games," he said. By the con
struction of a few rows of temporary
bleachers in addition to the new
bleachers 200 more people can be ac
commodated than at present.
"Dancing will not be particularly
restricted since very few people ever
dance outside of the girders anyway.
Besides, it will be almost impossible
to accommodate more than 500 cou
ples on the floor at any time, since
the provision for food, music, and
other entertainment can not be easily
arranged. Decoration of the pavilion
would be made easier, and, for such
entertainments as the Alumni dinner,
tables can be erected in the balconies
giving a terrace effect and removing

the congestion on the dancing floor.
The balconies can also be used for
seating the dancers instead of the
benches on the main floor used at
present." *
Bob Cravens favored the construc
tion of temporary bleachers which
could be removed at will.
"I prefer temporary bleachers since
the pavilion will be good only for bas
ketball and small dances with the
permanent seats as suggested," he
said. "We could have no more big
dances or jolly-ups with the restricted
dancing space.
Indoor Track Prevented
"The pavilion was constructed to
serve for many purposes which would
be defeated by the present plan."
Cravens spoke of an idea for an
I indoor running track to be built in
the pavilion but the new bleachers

would prevent the plan.
"It seems to me that temporary
bleachers would give as much seating
capacity without sacrificing the social
uses of the pavilion," said Carl Shoup,
editor of the 1924 Quad. "The pavilion
is hardly large enough ilow and per
manent bleachers will hurt the social
side more than the temporary ones
will harm basketball."
Dan Gage, Senior Class president,
said permanent bleachers on the ends
with temporary ones on the side would
solve the present difficulties.
"We will never have enough space
for our dances with permanent bleach
ers; we should put up temporary
stands instead," said Alice Roth, presi

I indoor running track to be built in
the pavilion but the new bleachers

would prevent the plan.
"It seems to me that temporary
bleachers would give as much seating
capacity without sacrificing the social
uses of the pavilion," said Carl Shoup,
editor of the 1924 Quad. "The pavilion
is hardly large enough ilow and per
manent bleachers will hurt the social
side more than the temporary ones
will harm basketball."
Dan Gage, Senior Class president,
said permanent bleachers on the ends
with temporary ones on the side would
solve the present difficulties.
"We will never have enough space
for our dances with permanent bleach
ers; we should put up temporary
stands instead," said Alice Roth, presi
dent of the Associated Women Stu
dents.
"I am against permanent balconies,"
said "Bud" Woodward, president of

Skull and Snakes. "Temporary bleach- J
ers should solve the problem."
"With temporary stands we can re
tain the large floor space for dances
and for the big 'S' rallies," said
"Scotchy" Campbell, captain of the
football team. "Since the pavilion was
built for entertainments as well as
basketball, we should consider the
advantages and disadvantages to both
in erecting the new stands."

The student body will be given a I

manent bleachers in the basketball
pavilion at a special election a week i
from today.
A referendum petition on the Execu

construction was circulated last night j
in Toyon and Encina halls and two;
fraternities. Pifty-two names were ob
tained, fifty being necessary to put the
measure on the ballot
Those signing the petition say that >
the plan was approved without giving
the student body a chance to voice its;
opinion.
The measure was passed by the Exe
cutive committee on recommendation
of Comptroller Roth and Graduate
Manager Davis, after several plans for
additional seats were considered.
Immovable bleachers extending nine
feet from the present balconies to the
steel uprights, and ending in a four
foot wall around three sides of the
floor, are called for.
The seats would be in the shape of
a U, the kitchen entrance being left
free. At the other end the four-foot
wall would be twenty feet from the
building wall.
1200 More Accommodated
Twelve hundred more people may
be accommodated by the plan. Advo
cates argue that this will aid in seat- >
ing at four big basketball games, two j
with U. S. C. and two with California, j
One-third of the floor space will be I
cut off for dancing purposes if the j
bleachers are constructed. This will af- j

Point System Up for Recall
The section of the Student Body
Constitution providing for a point sys
tem. to be put up for recall, is: "Arti
cle V. of Section 4. The Executive j
Committee shall provide for the main-j
tenance of a card index file of every;
student in the University, this file to
contain data respecting the student's
extra-curriculum activities, and to be
kept up to date at each meeting of
the Executive Committee, one of the
salaried officers of the Association be- i
ing responsible for its maintenance."
Two assistant yell leaders will be
chosen from the present six trycutees. j
Reasons given by student leaders
for the recall of the section of the
constitution providing for the point
system in activities are, that the sys
tem requires too much time and ex- J
pense, and that it is impractical.
The original idea of the article was
to distribute offices among more of
the students, a plan tried by other
universities with doubtful success, ac
cording to information from colleges
where the plan was tried. A two-thirds
majority of the votes cast is neces
sary to pass the amendment.

considerable aid to the basketball men
in their games," he said. By the con
struction of a few rows of temporary
bleachers in addition to the new
bleachers 200 more people can be ac
commodated than at present.
"Dancing will not be particularly
restricted since very few people ever
dance outside of the girders anyway.
Besides, it will be almost impossible
to accommodate more than 500 cou
ples on the floor at any time, since
the provision for food, music, and
other entertainment can not be easily
arranged. Decoration of the pavilion
would be made easier, and, for such
entertainments as the Alumni dinner,
tables can be erected in the balconies
giving a terrace effect and removing

the congestion on the dancing floor.
The balconies can also be used for
seating the dancers instead of the
benches on the main floor used at
present." *
Bob Cravens favored the construc
tion of temporary bleachers which
could be removed at will.
"I prefer temporary bleachers since
the pavilion will be good only for bas
ketball and small dances with the
permanent seats as suggested," he
said. "We could have no more big

would be made easier, and, for such
entertainments as the Alumni dinner,
tables can be erected in the balconies
giving a terrace effect and removing

the congestion on the dancing floor.
The balconies can also be used for
seating the dancers instead of the
benches on the main floor used at
present." *
Bob Cravens favored the construc
tion of temporary bleachers which
could be removed at will.
"I prefer temporary bleachers since
the pavilion will be good only for bas
ketball and small dances with the
permanent seats as suggested," he
said. "We could have no more big
dances or jolly-ups with the restricted
dancing space.
Indoor Track Prevented
"The pavilion was constructed to
serve for many purposes which would
be defeated by the present plan."
Cravens spoke of an idea for an
I indoor running track to be built in
the pavilion but the new bleachers

would prevent the plan.
"It seems to me that temporary
bleachers would give as much seating
capacity without sacrificing the social
uses of the pavilion," said Carl Shoup,
editor of the 1924 Quad. "The pavilion
is hardly large enough ilow and per
manent bleachers will hurt the social
side more than the temporary ones
will harm basketball."
Dan Gage, Senior Class president,
said permanent bleachers on the ends
with temporary ones on the side would
solve the present difficulties.
"We will never have enough space
for our dances with permanent bleach
ers; we should put up temporary
stands instead," said Alice Roth, presi
dent of the Associated Women Stu
dents.
"I am against permanent balconies,"
said "Bud" Woodward, president of

Skull and Snakes. "Temporary bleach- J
ers should solve the problem."
"With temporary stands we can re
tain the large floor space for dances
and for the big 'S' rallies," said
"Scotchy" Campbell, captain of the
football team. "Since the pavilion was
built for entertainments as well as
basketball, we should consider the
advantages and disadvantages to both
in erecting the new stands."
