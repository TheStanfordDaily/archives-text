# STUDENT BODY TO VOTE ON ERECTION OF PAVILION SEATS
## Referendum Petition Forces Ex Committee to Put Plan on Ballot 
### 
The student body will be given a I
chance to vote on the erection of per-1
manent bleachers in the basketball
pavilion at a special election a week i
from today.
A referendum petition on the Execu
tive committee's authorization of the
construction was circulated last night j
in Toyon and Encina halls and two;
fraternities. Pifty-two names were ob
tained, fifty being necessary to put the
measure on the ballot
Those signing the petition say that >
the plan was approved without giving
the student body a chance to voice its;
opinion.
The measure was passed by the Exe
cutive committee on recommendation
of Comptroller Roth and Graduate
Manager Davis, after several plans for
additional seats were considered.
Immovable bleachers extending nine
feet from the present balconies to the
steel uprights, and ending in a four
foot wall around three sides of the
floor, are called for.
The seats would be in the shape of
a U, the kitchen entrance being left
free. At the other end the four-foot
wall would be twenty feet from the
building wall.
1200 More Accommodated
Twelve hundred more people may
be accommodated by the plan. Advo
cates argue that this will aid in seat- >
ing at four big basketball games, two j
with U. S. C. and two with California, j
One-third of the floor space will be I
cut off for dancing purposes if the j
bleachers are constructed. This will af- j
feet two dances, the sophomore cotil- j
lion and the junior prom.
At the same election the point sys-,
tem restricting student activities will
be referred to the student vote and
two men for the Union Board of Gov
ernors. A vice-president of the A. S. J
S. U. will also be elected. Herbert:
Hoover is now serving by temporary
appointment, of the Executive com
mittee.
Point System Up for Recall
The section of the Student Body
Constitution providing for a point sys
tem. to be put up for recall, is: "Arti
cle V. of Section 4. The Executive j
Committee shall provide for the main-j
tenance of a card index file of every;
student in the University, this file to
contain data respecting the student's
extra-curriculum activities, and to be
kept up to date at each meeting of
the Executive Committee, one of the
salaried officers of the Association be- i
ing responsible for its maintenance."
Two assistant yell leaders will be
chosen from the present six trycutees. j
Reasons given by student leaders
for the recall of the section of the
constitution providing for the point
system in activities are, that the sys
tem requires too much time and ex- J
