With one exception the favorites
came through with victories in the
first round of the Stanford golf tour
ney being played at the Burlingame
country club. The upset came when
Dick Lang, low gross man, in the
qualifying round met a four and three
defeat at the hands of Byerly, a fresh
man. Byerly started one up on Lang,
and played excellent golf, turning in
a 78.
Fritz Ditzler had the best score with
a 77. "Reg" Hirscliman had an 81,
which gave him a 3 and 2 victory
