# SHAW BURLESQUES ENGLISH IN COMIC ROMAN DRAMA
## 
### 
"An enormously clever insult thrown |
in the face of the English-speaking
people," is the way in which the critic
for the London Times described "An
drocles and the Lion" when it was
first presented at St. James Theater.
Shaw seemed to hold, in writing the
play, that man in general and the
Anglo-Saxon in particular is a very
ridiculous animal.
Yet, in spite of the burlesque on im
pressive Romans, there is an under-;
lying thread of deep beauty and truth
that makes the play much more than
a merely clever comedy. Shaw intends
it to be a real protest against any
kind of persecution.
When it came out, the drama star
tled, shocked, and amused all London, j
They didn't quite know how to take
it. Some sat back and laughed at the j
humor of it, others were offended at
its seemingly flagrant attack on their
established customs, while the rest
just wondered.
Through it all Shaw was pictured
as standing behind the scenes watch
ing the audience with a sort of satiri
cal smile which was compounded of
kindliness, contempt, and sheer love

of mischief. "Typically Shaw," said
those who professed to know him.
At the time when the play was writ
ten, the suffragists in England were
being rather severely chastised by the
people and by putting their arguments
in the mouths of the Roman perse
cutors, Shaw openly ridiculed them.
Sacred words and prayers of the mar
tyrs are followed by bits of comic
relief. It is for this reason that, the
author has been condemned by many
for making an attack upon Christian
ity.
The framework of the piece itself
is the old fable from Aulus Gellius
about Androcles, the Greek tailor, and
the Lion that he found in the forest
with a thorn in it 3 foot. From the rise
of the curtain the play flows with
such swiftness that toward the end
one almost rises on tiptoes in eager
ness to see the conclusion.
From beginning to end the audience
is continually getting sharp prods.
One laughs, and laughs heartily, and
again the deeper significance of the
plot peeps out and gives one a strange
choking sensation in the throat. All
of which goes to give the play its
unique appeal.

tled, shocked, and amused all London, j
They didn't quite know how to take
it. Some sat back and laughed at the j
humor of it, others were offended at
its seemingly flagrant attack on their
established customs, while the rest
just wondered.
Through it all Shaw was pictured
as standing behind the scenes watch
ing the audience with a sort of satiri
cal smile which was compounded of
kindliness, contempt, and sheer love

of mischief. "Typically Shaw," said
those who professed to know him.
At the time when the play was writ
ten, the suffragists in England were
being rather severely chastised by the
people and by putting their arguments
in the mouths of the Roman perse
cutors, Shaw openly ridiculed them.
Sacred words and prayers of the mar
tyrs are followed by bits of comic
relief. It is for this reason that, the
author has been condemned by many
for making an attack upon Christian
ity.
The framework of the piece itself
is the old fable from Aulus Gellius
about Androcles, the Greek tailor, and
the Lion that he found in the forest
with a thorn in it 3 foot. From the rise
of the curtain the play flows with
such swiftness that toward the end
one almost rises on tiptoes in eager
ness to see the conclusion.
From beginning to end the audience
is continually getting sharp prods.
One laughs, and laughs heartily, and
again the deeper significance of the
plot peeps out and gives one a strange
choking sensation in the throat. All
of which goes to give the play its
unique appeal.
