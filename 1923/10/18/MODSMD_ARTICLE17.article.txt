"When the American Medical associa
tion entered upon its study of medical
education and began those studies that
have done much to raise American medi
cine to its present standard, the hospital
became a primary object of study. Ade
quate clinical training needed by a young
physician required hospital and out-pa
tient observation.
"The numbyr of hospital beds, the teach
ing facilities of the hospital and its dis
pensary Were dearly interlocked with
medical education that the efforts of the
Council on Medical Education were large
ly directed to two tilings: (1) the intro
duction of the laboratory into medical
instruction, and (2) the development of
hospital services permitting admission of
students directly into the wards for per
sonal observation of the sick under the
supervision of internes and attending phy
sicians."
Other prominent speakers who will talk

H. S. Pritchett, president of the Carnegie
