# TWO ELEVENS LEAVE FOR OCCIDENTAL GAME
## Kerr Plans Use of all Reserves; Second Team May Open Contest 
### 
Two complete elevens and the nucleus of a third backfield boarded Pullmans
today to play#Occidental college in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon.
Twenty-eight players, besides coaches and managers, are making the trip.
Nothing much in the way of stiff opposition is expected from the Oxy team.
Kerr plans to stick to simple plays as much as possible, so that the spies of
"Gloomy Gus" will have as little information as possible to take back to Ilium.
Kerr plans to exchange teams as often as he did in the Santa Clara game,
and may try Gus Henderson's stunt of starting the game with his reserve

line-up. The two teams will line up as
follows, whichever starts the game:
First string—Thomas, 1.e.; Shipkey,
1.t.; Cravens, 1.g.; Baker, c.; Faville,
r.g.; Johnston, r.t.; J. Lawlson, r.e.;
Campbell, q.; Cleaveland, 1.h.; Dennis,
r.h.; Nevers, f.
Second string—Middleton, 1.e.; Lu
deke, 1.t.; Armour, 1.g.; Hunt, c.; Neill,
r.g.; Loomis, r.t.; Mitchell, q.; Cudde
back, 1.h.; Wheat, r.h.; Solomon, f.
Kerr's third backfield combination,
consisting of Cliff Hey, "Bud" Wood
ward, and "Porky" Dwight, and Harris
and McDermont, spare ends, also left
with the two elevens.
The Cardinals may run up rather a
huge score, however, as they have not
forgotten that statement from the Oc-
cidental campus that "Occidental was
making her big game this year with
Stanford instead of U. S. C. because
U. S. C. was too Btrong to give any
competition." The cards will work un
der orders to keep their shirts on,
though, and save their punch for the ;
Trojans.
No more fumbles on the twenty
yard line are expected to mar Stan
ford's touchdown chances after the
grilling Kerr has been giving the
squad this week. Two Cardinal scores
were lost that way last Saturday, and
the total of nine butter-finger plays
looked anything but good to Andy.
Captain Campbell's trick perform
ance of passing on the fourth down
instead of letting Cleaveland punt will
probably be used to cross up the
Tigers as it did Santa Clara last week. !
Kerr has been working on three pass- j
ing combinations, two of which got,
into action against the Padres. The
first duet was Nevers-to-Campbell,
which gained ten and twenty yards so
often it made the opposition look like
last year's hotcakes; the second was
Solomon-to-Wheat, rendering a similar
tune when the second line-up went
into action.
•"Bud" Woodward, who can haul
down passes himself whenever they
come within stepladder distance, will
not be used except in emergency, as
he is giving his dislocated shoulder
a rest ljefore the Trojan game next
week. >

though, and save their punch for the ;
Trojans.
No more fumbles on the twenty
yard line are expected to mar Stan
ford's touchdown chances after the
grilling Kerr has been giving the
squad this week. Two Cardinal scores
were lost that way last Saturday, and
the total of nine butter-finger plays
looked anything but good to Andy.
Captain Campbell's trick perform
ance of passing on the fourth down
instead of letting Cleaveland punt will
probably be used to cross up the
Tigers as it did Santa Clara last week. !
Kerr has been working on three pass- j
ing combinations, two of which got,
into action against the Padres. The
first duet was Nevers-to-Campbell,
which gained ten and twenty yards so
often it made the opposition look like
last year's hotcakes; the second was
Solomon-to-Wheat, rendering a similar
tune when the second line-up went
into action.
•"Bud" Woodward, who can haul
down passes himself whenever they
come within stepladder distance, will
not be used except in emergency, as
he is giving his dislocated shoulder
a rest ljefore the Trojan game next
week. >
Two complete elevens and the nucleus of a third backfield boarded Pullmans
today to play#Occidental college in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon.
Twenty-eight players, besides coaches and managers, are making the trip.
Nothing much in the way of stiff opposition is expected from the Oxy team.
Kerr plans to stick to simple plays as much as possible, so that the spies of
"Gloomy Gus" will have as little information as possible to take back to Ilium.
Kerr plans to exchange teams as often as he did in the Santa Clara game,
and may try Gus Henderson's stunt of starting the game with his reserve

line-up. The two teams will line up as
follows, whichever starts the game:
First string—Thomas, 1.e.; Shipkey,
1.t.; Cravens, 1.g.; Baker, c.; Faville,
r.g.; Johnston, r.t.; J. Lawlson, r.e.;
Campbell, q.; Cleaveland, 1.h.; Dennis,
r.h.; Nevers, f.
Second string—Middleton, 1.e.; Lu
deke, 1.t.; Armour, 1.g.; Hunt, c.; Neill,
r.g.; Loomis, r.t.; Mitchell, q.; Cudde
back, 1.h.; Wheat, r.h.; Solomon, f.
Kerr's third backfield combination,
consisting of Cliff Hey, "Bud" Wood
ward, and "Porky" Dwight, and Harris
and McDermont, spare ends, also left
with the two elevens.
The Cardinals may run up rather a
huge score, however, as they have not
forgotten that statement from the Oc-
cidental campus that "Occidental was
making her big game this year with
Stanford instead of U. S. C. because
U. S. C. was too Btrong to give any
competition." The cards will work un
der orders to keep their shirts on,
though, and save their punch for the ;
Trojans.
