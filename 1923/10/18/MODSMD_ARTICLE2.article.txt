# TWO ELEVENS LEAVE FOR OCCIDENTAL GAME
## Kerr Plans Use of all Reserves; Second Team May Open Contest 
### 
Two complete elevens and the nucleus of a third backfield boarded Pullmans
today to play#Occidental college in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon.
Twenty-eight players, besides coaches and managers, are making the trip.
Nothing much in the way of stiff opposition is expected from the Oxy team.
Kerr plans to stick to simple plays as much as possible, so that the spies of
"Gloomy Gus" will have as little information as possible to take back to Ilium.
Kerr plans to exchange teams as often as he did in the Santa Clara game,
and may try Gus Henderson's stunt of starting the game with his reserve

line-up. The two teams will line up as
follows, whichever starts the game:
First string—Thomas, 1.e.; Shipkey,
1.t.; Cravens, 1.g.; Baker, c.; Faville,
r.g.; Johnston, r.t.; J. Lawlson, r.e.;
Campbell, q.; Cleaveland, 1.h.; Dennis,
r.h.; Nevers, f.
Second string—Middleton, 1.e.; Lu
deke, 1.t.; Armour, 1.g.; Hunt, c.; Neill,
r.g.; Loomis, r.t.; Mitchell, q.; Cudde
back, 1.h.; Wheat, r.h.; Solomon, f.
Kerr's third backfield combination,
consisting of Cliff Hey, "Bud" Wood
ward, and "Porky" Dwight, and Harris
and McDermont, spare ends, also left
with the two elevens.
The Cardinals may run up rather a
huge score, however, as they have not
forgotten that statement from the Oc-
