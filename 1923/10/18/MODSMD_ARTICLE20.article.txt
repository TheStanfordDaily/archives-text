# SNAIL AND MILK OR MILK AND SNAIL
## 
### 
With the ousting of Jack Meyers from the base
ment of Encina Hall and Wilson's from the Book
store building last year, it was announced that the
University would offer a campus store as a sub
stitute.
That store is a reality, now, on the first floor of
the old Union. Let us see just how far it has gone
toward taking the place of the greatly-mourned
departed.
Fully one-fourth of the men in Encina depended
on Meyers' store for one meal a day and probably
one-tenth of them for more than one. The bill of
fare included canned tamales, encliilades, and beans,
served hot, sandwiches, coffee, and milk. In addi
tion, there were snails and three kinds of cereals
for breakfast. Encina men found Meyers' a very
convenient place to eat a light breakfast on the way
to eight o'clocks. A cup of hot coffee and a sand
wich came in handy when the "midnight oil" was
burning.
At Wilson's, in addition to hot drinks and sand
wiches, there were all kinds of cold drinks and sun
daes. Many men and women from the Row ate
breakfast or lunch here.
Sunday night suppers of beans failed to attract
and Wilson's was a favorite rendevous for students
from the Row. None of the eating clubs served a
Sunday night meal and Meyers' store was conven
ient for a sandwich and a cup of coffee.
The hungry student who walks into the new store
has his choice of milk and a snail or a snail and
milk. If he is not too hungry, he may be consoled
by the assurance that "we will have coffee and sand
wiches—later." Milk-shakes and malted milks, ob
tainable at either Meyers' or Wilson's are also prom
•ised for the future.
The student who hits the floor at about 10:30 Sun
day morning realizes that the Union dining hall is
closed and that after all a snail and milk is better
than nothing at all and hikes over to the store —
only to find it closed. Result, no breakfast or a
trip to Palo Alto. Tobacco is unobtainable on the
campus on Sunday with the store closed and with
twelve cents car fare, a package of cigarettes stands
the purchaser twenty-seven cents. Not so good.
Now that the hammer is somewhat dulled, we
may offer a few suggestions.* In the first place, the
idea of such a store is a fine one. If prices were a
little lower on a few things there would be less dis
satisfaction. Hot drinks and sandwiches would help
materially.
As to opening the store on Sunday, it seems only
the logical thing to do. Not only does it irritate the
student to have to lrtake a trip to Palo Alto for a
package of cigarettes ljut the store loses money.
Should it be undesirable for the store to remain open
all day, a few hours in the morning and evening
would help.
The service is above reproach and the store is al
ways clean, which covers a multitude of other sins.

With the ousting of Jack Meyers from the base
ment of Encina Hall and Wilson's from the Book
store building last year, it was announced that the
University would offer a campus store as a sub
stitute.
That store is a reality, now, on the first floor of
the old Union. Let us see just how far it has gone
toward taking the place of the greatly-mourned
departed.
Fully one-fourth of the men in Encina depended
on Meyers' store for one meal a day and probably
one-tenth of them for more than one. The bill of
fare included canned tamales, encliilades, and beans,
served hot, sandwiches, coffee, and milk. In addi
tion, there were snails and three kinds of cereals
for breakfast. Encina men found Meyers' a very
convenient place to eat a light breakfast on the way
to eight o'clocks. A cup of hot coffee and a sand
wich came in handy when the "midnight oil" was
burning.
At Wilson's, in addition to hot drinks and sand
wiches, there were all kinds of cold drinks and sun
daes. Many men and women from the Row ate
breakfast or lunch here.
Sunday night suppers of beans failed to attract
and Wilson's was a favorite rendevous for students
from the Row. None of the eating clubs served a
Sunday night meal and Meyers' store was conven
ient for a sandwich and a cup of coffee.
The hungry student who walks into the new store
has his choice of milk and a snail or a snail and
milk. If he is not too hungry, he may be consoled
by the assurance that "we will have coffee and sand
wiches—later." Milk-shakes and malted milks, ob
tainable at either Meyers' or Wilson's are also prom
•ised for the future.
The student who hits the floor at about 10:30 Sun
day morning realizes that the Union dining hall is
closed and that after all a snail and milk is better
than nothing at all and hikes over to the store —
only to find it closed. Result, no breakfast or a
trip to Palo Alto. Tobacco is unobtainable on the
campus on Sunday with the store closed and with
twelve cents car fare, a package of cigarettes stands
the purchaser twenty-seven cents. Not so good.
Now that the hammer is somewhat dulled, we
may offer a few suggestions.* In the first place, the
idea of such a store is a fine one. If prices were a
little lower on a few things there would be less dis
satisfaction. Hot drinks and sandwiches would help
materially.
As to opening the store on Sunday, it seems only
the logical thing to do. Not only does it irritate the
student to have to lrtake a trip to Palo Alto for a
package of cigarettes ljut the store loses money.
Should it be undesirable for the store to remain open
all day, a few hours in the morning and evening
would help.
The service is above reproach and the store is al
