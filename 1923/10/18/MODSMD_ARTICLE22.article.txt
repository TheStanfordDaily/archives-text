The permanent seats will greatly resemble the Roman
arena with its surroundings, and Castileja girls say
they won't attend.
Campus women say that nobody would dance in an
arena except gladiators and Christians, and cynically
proceed to comment that none of either ever register
in the University.
One instigator of the new reform, when backed into
a corner by five furious reporters and a Spitz puppy
who out-howled the bunch, swore stoutly that the new
sedentary arrangements would help the crowd to get
out in case the next earthquake came during a basket
battle. He further proved that if the real-estate had
shuddered during the California game last year, the
entire assemblage would have been spoiled, including
the Cal substitutes.
Homer Cayenne, '27, retaliated by suggesting that the
crowd give a rousing cheer, thus raising the roof and
providing a method of egress.
That'll be all of this—you're welcome. —B. W.
