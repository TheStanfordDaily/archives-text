# DEFENSE OF FREAKS

### 
Last might the Daily Palo Alto got a pleasant
surprise.. It found some one who was- actually irt
favor of Jolly-Ups, as they are run at present. This
person expressed his opinion forcibly and with the
best of intentions, and almost convinced? the writer
of a recent editorial on the subject that, there may
be more of his kind on the campus.
It is to be hoped that in the future such rnay be
seen at the Jolly-Ups themselves-,.instead 1 of stand
ing up in defense of the "tradition" without ac
knowledge as to what levels the tradition, has- de
scended from its original intent.

An interesting communication was f ootid out the
editor's desk yesterday. It will he published with
glee if the writer will sign his own name and not
an obvious alias. If requested, the signature wilt
not be printed with the communication,, but it is
necessary to have proper reference in, publishing any
thing not written by a member of the staff.
