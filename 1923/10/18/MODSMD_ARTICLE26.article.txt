The fact that the Cardinal grid-men
are kept in good condition and train
ing was emphasized last Saturday by
the lack of substitutions which Coach
Kerr made on account of injuries. The
game was continually slowed up by
the accidents which occurred on the
Santa Clara squad, but only rarely
was a Stanford player given first-aid.

Since class football has started, the
swimming tank is rapidly becoming
deserted. Most of the varsity water
polo players have donned the mole
skins, and a goodly number of them
have showed their ability in other
sports besides water polo.

Lan Campbell, star Stanford sprinter
of last year's varsity, is seen working
out three times a week on the Card
oval preparing for the 1924 season.

The rumor which was circulated at
the beginning of the season relative to
the injuries likely to be suffered by
Ernie Nevers on account of the big
fullback's large bones was evidently
unfounded. Nevers was on his feet
all the time he played despite the
number of times he was sent through
the line.

A rather queer coincidence came up
during the summer when Clarence
Pinkston. former Stanford diver and
winner of fancy diving at the Olympic
games in Antwerp, and A1 White, var
sity diver, competed for the national
honors in diving. Pinkston nosed
White out by a narrow margin. Both
of these men are almost sure of com
peting in the Olympic games at Paris
next summer.

Wally O'Conner, star sprint man on
the Stanford swimming team, has
been swimming 1000 yards several
times a week, practicing for the com
ing meets. Shortly after leaving school
last spring Wally turned in some ex
cellent times in practice swims at the
Venice tank. \

"Blink" Williamson looked lost in
last Saturday's game, "Blink" sought
everywhere for a curve which he could
round, but after deciding that the
football field was not the Oval he pro
ceeded to make several 20-yard end
runs, which showed his track training
had not all been in vain.

The fact that Dick Hyland, star left
half on Coach "Husky" Hunt's fresh
man football combination, has been
declared eligible again, returns a valu
able star to the game. Those who saw
Hyland cut loose against San Diego
High School can see that he will
prove to be a big ground gainer in
the coming intercollegiate contests of
the babes.

last spring Wally turned in some ex

Venice tank. \

"Blink" Williamson looked lost in
last Saturday's game, "Blink" sought
everywhere for a curve which he could
round, but after deciding that the
football field was not the Oval he pro
ceeded to make several 20-yard end
runs, which showed his track training
had not all been in vain.

The fact that Dick Hyland, star left
half on Coach "Husky" Hunt's fresh
man football combination, has been
declared eligible again, returns a valu
able star to the game. Those who saw
Hyland cut loose against San Diego
High School can see that he will
prove to be a big ground gainer in
the coming intercollegiate contests of
the babes.
The fact that the Cardinal grid-men
are kept in good condition and train
ing was emphasized last Saturday by
the lack of substitutions which Coach
Kerr made on account of injuries. The
game was continually slowed up by
the accidents which occurred on the
Santa Clara squad, but only rarely
was a Stanford player given first-aid.

Since class football has started, the
swimming tank is rapidly becoming
deserted. Most of the varsity water
polo players have donned the mole
skins, and a goodly number of them
have showed their ability in other
sports besides water polo.

Lan Campbell, star Stanford sprinter
of last year's varsity, is seen working
out three times a week on the Card
oval preparing for the 1924 season.

The rumor which was circulated at
the beginning of the season relative to
the injuries likely to be suffered by
Ernie Nevers on account of the big
fullback's large bones was evidently
unfounded. Nevers was on his feet
all the time he played despite the
number of times he was sent through
the line.

A rather queer coincidence came up
during the summer when Clarence
Pinkston. former Stanford diver and
winner of fancy diving at the Olympic
games in Antwerp, and A1 White, var
sity diver, competed for the national
honors in diving. Pinkston nosed
White out by a narrow margin. Both
of these men are almost sure of com
peting in the Olympic games at Paris
next summer.

Wally O'Conner, star sprint man on
the Stanford swimming team, has
been swimming 1000 yards several
times a week, practicing for the com
