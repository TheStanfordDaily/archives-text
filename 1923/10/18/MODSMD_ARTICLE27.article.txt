# PENNSYLVANIA HAS NEW ADVERTISING SCHEME
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Pa.â€”Trolley car
ads and subway posters with the ad
vice, "Come out and root for Peun"
are the latest form of advertising for
athletic contests by the University of
Pennsylvania. If Franklin Field is
filled each Saturday it will materially
aid the Quaker institution in paying
for the new stadium.
