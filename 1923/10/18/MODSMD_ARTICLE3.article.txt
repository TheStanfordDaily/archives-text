# COOPERATION MEANS FAST MAIL SERVICE, SAYS POSTMISTRESS
## 
### 
The only possible immediate relief
from the present unsatisfactory han
dling of the mail in the Stanford post
office is co-operation of the students,
according to Mrs. Chester Thomas,
postmistress.
"This postoffice is wedged in be
tween two large, slow-moving bodies,"
says Mrs. Thomas, "the United States
Government and Stanford University.
Until the one gives us more money
to operate on, and the other more
space to operate in, we cannot handle
the mail any faster than we are now
doing.
"Of the eighty new professors added
to the faculty this quarter, only four
have .left their addresses with the
postoffice. Students living off the cam
pus have failed to give us their ad
dresses; so that we can forward their
mail.
"All new students should direct
their correspondents to omit Palo Alto
from their addresses. Stanford has its
own postoffice. Those who are for
tunate enough to have boxes should
have their mail addressed to those
boxes.
"One student called for his mail
three times in one afternoon. Under
the present crowded conditions, espe
cially at the first of the quarter, it
would make things much easier for
everyone if students would limit them
selves to one call a day, preferably at
some hours besides noon or 5:30.
"We are doing our best under the
existing conditions."
Mrs. .Thomas is employing college
men almost exclusively, and is enthu
siastic over their ability and willing
ness to work.
