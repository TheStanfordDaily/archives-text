# STANFORD POLO MEN DEPART FOR OREGON; PLAY O. A. C. SATURDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team left Tues
day for Corvallis, Ore., where it will
meet the mallet swingers of Oregon
Agricultural College on Saturday. Cap
tain Otto Barbv was unable to accom
pany the team on account of illness.
Hay Tremaine will play as fourth man
in Barby's place. The trip north is
being made by automobile and the
team expects to arrive in time for a
workout on the northern field previous
to Saturday's game.
Barby's absence from the line-up
will be a serious handicap to the local
polo men. He is an experienced player
of several years and has been a strong
factor on the Stanford team.
Four men, John Irwin, Ralph Barby,
Ed Laub, and Ray Tremaine, left
Tuesday afternoon for the north. They
will arrive with C. E. Boyle, coach,
on Friday.
Polo ponies belonging to the O. A.
C. team will be used by the Stanford
four.
