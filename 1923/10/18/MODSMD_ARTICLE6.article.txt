# Prowler Invades Roble Hall; Flees From Pistol Shots
## 
### 
A burglar in "C" wing of Roble hall j
was driven off by women residents at 10 j
o'clock last night. The man fled towards j
the boathouse, the night watchman firing i
three shots at him as he ran.
The burglar was seen by a woman in j
"B" wing attempting to pry the screen j
in a room across the court. While she
was reporting to Mrs. Franklin the:
women in a "C" wing suite heard a Cur- j
tain rod crash in their bedroom, $nd 1
created such a disturbance that the man 1
left hurriedly, followed by three bul
lets from the night watchman's gun.
The burglar was evidently unacquainted j
with the campus, as he timed his intru-!
sion just when every one in Roble was j
awake.
