I™®® seasons are distinctly
English. Two-button models
with long easy rolling lapels,
loose body lines, blunt pointed
I vests and wider trousers with
pleated waists refled: the accepted
| vogue of old London. Three
! button models with buttons set
! wide apart are almost equally
I popular. Both come in many
pleasing patterns and the new
Fall shades of brown, taupe, gray,
! smoke mixtures and hazy blue.
