# FRESHMEN GRIDDERS ARE TO BATTLE SALINAS, SANTA CRUZ, SAN JOSE TEACHERS' ELEVENS
## Coach Hunt's Babes Should Take All Three Games; Line Work Shows Greater Punch 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman football squad will spend another busy day
tomorrow with three games scheduled. In the morning at 10 o'clock, Salinas
and Santa Cruz high schools will be battled on the practice fields. San Jose
State Teachers College will be played in the stadium in the afternoon.
All three games should prove set-ups for the babes. Although Salinas was
represented as a strong team last year and went far in the play-offs for the
Northern California Interscholastic championship, this year's team is reported
to be much weaker. However, the high school lads may spring a surprise.
Little is known of the Santa Cruz eleven, although they promise a fast line-up.

Babes Will Work Good Plays
The San Jose Teachers College
game should be featured by brilliant
plays by the freshmen. A chance to
get loose is all that is required by
Hyland and Garthwaite. Although
small, Garthwaite should be a heavy
ground-gainer tomorrow.
Even though the strength of the San
Jose team is unknown, it should not
provide heavy competition for the
babes.
The action of the freshman line will
be closely followed. Last Saturday
many defects were shown up, but a
week's practice has done much to
eliminate them. The line should be on
its feet every minute tomorrow, and
should show some of the punch and
driving power that will be necessary
against the U. S. C. babes next week.
With the California freshman game
only a little while away, the babes are
in for some hard practice.
