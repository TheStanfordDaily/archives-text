# MEMORIAL CHURCH IS ONE OF STRONGEST EDIFICES KNOWN
## 
### 
"Since its rebuilding after the
earthquake the Memorial Church is
one of the strongest buildings in the
world and if the trustees wished to
take it down and roll it around the
Inner Quad it could not be injured,
except for a few broken windows,"
said Dr. Jordan at an informal dis
cussion at his home last night.
Dr. Jordan said that earthquakes
were caused by lack of hardening of
the earth's crust. One way to cure
them is to fill up the cracks in the
earth after the disaster. He also de
scribed earthquakes and their results
which he has observed in Japan and
America.
