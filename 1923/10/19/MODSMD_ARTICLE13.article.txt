# STANFORD VARSITY IS PRIMED FOR CLASH WITH OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE IN SOUTH TOMORROW
## Coach Pipal's Tigers Have Lighter Line than Cards; Kerr's Men To Play Straight Football 
### David Meiklejohn 
For every trick Coach Pipal of the Occidental football team unfolds against
the Stanford varsity in the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow, Andy Kerr is
liable to provide a strong counteracting double. Pipal claims to have an
overflowing bag of these tricks which he has saved up all season in order to
make a good showing against Stanford. The Southern college's coach has no
hope of swamping the Cards under a winning score, but he does believe the
Oxy Tigers will provide competition in plenty.
Occidental's appearance in the Card schedule was more an accident than
happy forethought. It obliged Stanford to play three games against weaker

elevens when the varsity might better
have played against stronger competi
tion in preparation for the more stren
uous conference games beginning with
the U. S. C. contest Oct. 27. The wide
spread rumor that Occidental is play
ing Stanford in order to meet an eas
ier opponent than U. S. C. had proven
in the past, is totally without reason.
Coach Pipal's answer to this unfor
tunate statement, perpetrated by the
sport writers in the Los Angeles
papers, has been accepted without
question by Stanford athletic authori
ties.
Oxy Lacks Weight
If Occidental can make up in speed
and aggressiveness what it lacks in
weight, there might be a real battle
after all. At present, the team aver
ages 167 pounds, with a back Held
averaging close to 160, and a line
which weighs in at 170. The Stanford
squad on the other hand averages 184
pounds, the backfield averaging 176.
and the line 183. Those twenty poundß
of difference, sparse as they may seem
on first glance, will begin to tell to
ward the end of the game.

For every trick Coach Pipal of the Occidental football team unfolds against
the Stanford varsity in the Los Angeles Coliseum tomorrow, Andy Kerr is
liable to provide a strong counteracting double. Pipal claims to have an
overflowing bag of these tricks which he has saved up all season in order to
make a good showing against Stanford. The Southern college's coach has no
hope of swamping the Cards under a winning score, but he does believe the
Oxy Tigers will provide competition in plenty.
Occidental's appearance in the Card schedule was more an accident than
happy forethought. It obliged Stanford to play three games against weaker

elevens when the varsity might better
have played against stronger competi
tion in preparation for the more stren
uous conference games beginning with
the U. S. C. contest Oct. 27. The wide
spread rumor that Occidental is play
ing Stanford in order to meet an eas
ier opponent than U. S. C. had proven
in the past, is totally without reason.
Coach Pipal's answer to this unfor
tunate statement, perpetrated by the
sport writers in the Los Angeles
papers, has been accepted without
question by Stanford athletic authori
ties.
