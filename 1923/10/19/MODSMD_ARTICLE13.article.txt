# STANFORD VARSITY IS PRIMED FOR CLASH WITH OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE IN SOUTH TOMORROW
## Coach Pipal's Tigers Have Lighter Line than Cards; Kerr's Men To Play Straight Football

pounds, the backfield averaging 176.
and the line 183. Those twenty poundß
of difference, sparse as they may seem
on first glance, will begin to tell to
ward the end of the game.
Oxy may well claim to support an
