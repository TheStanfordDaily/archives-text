# KERR PRAISES SPIRIT OF CARDINAL ROOTERS
## Little Andy" Urges Crowd of 1500 to Think and Talk "Beat U. S. C."

"The Stanford team, it ain't what it
used to b» " for which all praise be
given.
The Stanford rooting section has
improved ns rapidly as have the grid
men, judging from the display made
at yesterday's bleacher rally.
A full section, more than 1500 men
and women, appeared in the stadium
for the first rally of the year. For the
first time in many seasons, a real
crowd turned out for a bleacher rally;
more, the crowd got down and rooted
with an enthusiasm new to this "gen
eration."
"Beat U. S. C.," Kerr Says
Praise for the spirit shown by the
"bleacher athletes," together with the
admonition to think and talk nothing
but "beat U. S. C." for the next two
days, were the features of "Little"
Andy Kerr's talk. With his usual cau
tion, Coach Kerr refused to promise
a Big Game victory this year; but "the
boys believe down in their hearts that
they can beat California this year, and
with your support they will make a
mighty fine try at it," he said.
Something new in noise machines
started the rally off with a bang, when
a cannon from the R. O. T. C. con
tingent startled the natives and made
a wreck out of the orchestral selection
then under way. Kerr's address, a lit
tle track work by the football men,
and a rehearsal of songs and yells
under the direction of Burt Lapp made
up the rest of the program.
