# KERR PRAISES SPIRIT OF CARDINAL ROOTERS
## Little Andy" Urges Crowd of 1500 to Think and Talk "Beat U. S. C." 
### David Lamson 
"The Stanford team, it ain't what it
used to bÂ» " for which all praise be
given.
The Stanford rooting section has
improved ns rapidly as have the grid
men, judging from the display made
at yesterday's bleacher rally.
A full section, more than 1500 men
and women, appeared in the stadium
for the first rally of the year. For the
first time in many seasons, a real
crowd turned out for a bleacher rally;
more, the crowd got down and rooted
with an enthusiasm new to this "gen
eration."
"Beat U. S. C.," Kerr Says
Praise for the spirit shown by the
"bleacher athletes," together with the
admonition to think and talk nothing
but "beat U. S. C." for the next two
days, were the features of "Little"
Andy Kerr's talk. With his usual cau
tion, Coach Kerr refused to promise
a Big Game victory this year; but "the
boys believe down in their hearts that
they can beat California this year, and
with your support they will make a
mighty fine try at it," he said.
Something new in noise machines
started the rally off with a bang, when
a cannon from the R. O. T. C. con
tingent startled the natives and made
a wreck out of the orchestral selection
then under way. Kerr's address, a lit
tle track work by the football men,
and a rehearsal of songs and yells
under the direction of Burt Lapp made
up the rest of the program.
In the fifty-yard dashes arranged to
show the bleachers what a "fast team"
really is, Faville, Shipkey, and Cravens
finished in one-two-three order in the
competition among guards, tackles,
and centers. Dole, Lawson, and Mc-
Dermott won for the ends, with
"Blink" Williamson, Wheat, and Hey
the backfield champions.
An even greater attendance at the
next bleacher rally was urged by Kerr,
who complimented the Cardinal root
ers on their showing yesterday and
Saturday. It is the victorious team
that has put the punch back in the
bleachers, in his opinion; and he em
phasized the point that enthusiastic
bleacher support goes far toward mak
ing a winning team.
"Old Dead Crowd Is Gone"
"The old dead crowd of other sea
sons must have been taken off and
buried," said the coach. "There isn't
any here now. If a point-winning team
can do this for you, what can't you
do for that team?"
The five men trying for positions as
assistant yell leaders were introduced
by Burt Lapp, and had their first work
out before the rooting section. Before
being voted on at the Quad elections,
they will appear again in Saturday's
games, and at the second rally next
week.
