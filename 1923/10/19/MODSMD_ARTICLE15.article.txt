# GRAYS WILL OPPOSE BATTLESHIP IDAHO TEAM ON SATURDAY
## 
### 
A game with the U. S. S. Idaho has
been scheduled for the Stanford Grays
tomorrow at 2:30 in place of the
game with the Agnetian club.
This change in dates will necessi
tate a shake-up in the line-up of the
team which plays the U. S. S. New
Mexico this afternoon. Mike Reed is
not certain as to which line-up he will
use in today's game, but announced
that those in the third string varsity
who did not accompany Kerr and his
men to Los Angeles will no doubt fur
nish the material for an eleven to play
the Idaho sailors.
