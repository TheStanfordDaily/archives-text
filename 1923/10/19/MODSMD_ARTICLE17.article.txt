# GOLF MEN TO PLAY OFF SEMI-FINALS IN BURLINGAME MATCH
## 
### 
Hirschman, Ditzler, Byerly, and
Hinckley advanced into the semi-finals
of the Stanford handicap golf tourney
by virtue of their victories in the
second round matches at Burlingame
yesterday. The semi-finals will be
played this afternoon at Burlingame,
with Hirschman meeting Ditzler and
Byerly meeting Hinckley.
Both matches promise to be well
played. As the men in each match
have the same handicap, no player
will have the advantage. The winners
of these matches will meet Monday
afternoon in the finals to determine
the winner of the tournament, and in
cidentally the University champion.
Dick Hinckley pulled a surprise
when he put Tom Condit, medallist in
the qualifying round, out of the toura
ney by the one-sided score of 9 up
and 8. Hinckley had things all his own
way from the start. He won the first
nine holes and at the start of the sec
ond nine had Condit dormie nine. The
next hole was halved, which gave the
match to Hinckley.
In the other matches, Byerly de
feated Klauber, 2 up; Ditzler won from
Clark, 2 and 1. and Hirschman defeat
ed Carter, 2 and 1. The Byerly-Klan
ber affair was close and hard fought.
At the eighteenth hole, Byerly was
dormie ane, and by shooting some
good golf, won the last hole, giving
him the match.
