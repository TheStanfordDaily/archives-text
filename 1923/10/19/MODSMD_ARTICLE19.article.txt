# TRADITION ENFORCEMENT
## 
### 
Announcement has come out that freshmen who
break traditions will be reported by sophomores to
the senior sponsor committee, and due punishment
meted out. This is a noble idea; one can always
keep traditions alive better by force than by giving
a realization of their worth and leaving the matter
up to a man's individual independence. It is un
doubtedly because of the threat of sudden force that
every one instinctively ol>eys the tradition of no
smoking on the Quad.
