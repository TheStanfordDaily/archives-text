A body of students, artists and intellectuals, are
calling on a certain professor. The professor, to
make them feel less restrained, goes through a per
fectly ludicrous performance, superbly foolish and
brilliantly nonsensical.
The students look at him, open-mouthed and awe
struck. They realize that he has suddenly gone
crazy, but they are much too polite to say so. (Pro
fessors are peculiar, you know.) Why, suppose he
meant all this clowning seriously! It would be a
deadly insult to laugh at him.
A few days later a group of faculty men call on
the same professor. He does the same things for
the benefit of the savants. They lean on each
other's shoulders and yowl. Finally they beg him
to stop, in order to save their ribs.
Yet some people say that undergraduates have
no self-restraint.
