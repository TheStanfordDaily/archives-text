# TIGER! TIGER!

### 
The Occidental Tiger is a new species of beast to
Stanford. We don't know how many teeth it has
per foot of jaw, or how often it has them manicured.
It seems to be a self-confident, assured creature, and
has the opinion that Stanford is an easier conquest
than Troy.
The Cardinal team went South last night to re
move that impression, together with as many of the
Tiger's teeth as is necessary. However, no one of
the Stanford football team is confident of a walk
over ; they have heard too often of the upstart school
called "Dr. Jordan's seminary" which went up to
San Francisco thirty-one years ago and walloped
the fur off a proud and haughty Bear.
