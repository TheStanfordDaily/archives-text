CABBAGES' HALL OF FAME
Rufus Philph, who never tried to write free-ver3e.
Oscar Phlunk, who says he never studies and doesn't.
Geraldine McSponge, who never thanks God that her
hair is naturally curly.
"Teeny" Spargle, football player who asserted that
the coach took him out because he was rotten.
Verry Verdant, frosh, who says he likes to wear his
dink.
Choc Taw, cook at Kak Eta house, who makes gravy
as he needs it.
Shakespeare Vere-Jones, English major who never
murmured, "I think I follow you, professor."
Myself, because I wrote all this stuff to fill up an
empty column.
♦ * *
Howls are being heard from all quarters (and some
half-dollars) since somebody came out with the an
nouncement that seats in the biscuit-bawl cotillion
would henceforth be immovable, likewise fixed.
The boys who used to set 'em up have lost their jobs,
and financial inadequacy now prevents them from set
ting 'em up elsewhere.
* * *
"So this is Paris," remarked the resourceful queener
as his garter slipped down around his ankle.
"Yes, and isn't it snappy," cooed Louise-Clarissa, as
she roguishly trod upon it.
"It's made its mark upon me," moaned the smitten
man, as he writhed thudding to the pavement. —B. W.

CABBAGES' POCKET ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
HANDY INFORMATION
Vol. 2—Bsw. to Dtt.
Basketball—A game played in a pavilion which is
built for dances;
Barefoot Club—Composed of those who have paid the
$95 on Oct., Jan., and Apr. 1, and then find they have
to eat to live.
Croquet—A sport played with mallets, like ping-pong
and baseball, and which is not yet a major sport.
Century Plant —The hundred-yard dash flash who is
still trying after five years.
Cotillion —A formal dance always carefully arranged
to be given the night before an important football game,
such as the second varsity's Berkeley fracas.
Careful survey has shown that no students in Pata
gonia are allowed off the pampas after 1 a.m.

"Zimbalist to Give First P. M. A. Concert on Campus"
—Headline. Now, how many of you know just how a
zimbalist plays? where zimbals are made? how high a
zymballous tune is? The appreciation of good music
around here is not as high as it might be.
* * * >
From Roble goes the warning
(Thus causing plenty fright)
"No food will be adorning
Our board on Sunday night
J* ? ■ ' ' '!
The reason is, our hashers
Have left us in the lurch
No, girls, they are not mashers
They wish to go to church!"
w*
ilm . ' *
So all the maids at Roble
Will feel deep sense of wrong.
And think they're snubbed ignobLy
If they aren't dragged along.
♦ * *
We hear of a New York modern woman who, for a
small stipend, is willing to act as the "other woman in
the case" in any divorce suit which involves alimony in
the six-figure class. She was asked where she acquired
all her knowledge by some zealous reporter.
"Oh," she breezily answered, "I learned in one of
them co-respondent schools."
* * *
Flunk-outs, it is reported, occur with less frequency
in the prison schools in California than in any other
school system in the world. Prexy, take notice!

With the new rulings which are being thought up
here, it will soon be about as easy to do anything here
of one's own free will as it is there.
When you enter here, they "mug" you and paste your
picture on a record card. Outside of the fact that they
don't go through the formality of searching you for
money, the results are the same.
* * *
Soon we will read items like this in the daily papers:
"Bertram Blivens, son of B. Blivens, Blivens, Idaho,
was shot down while attempting to force his way into a
free reading class this afternoon at the university. He
is expected to recover. When asked why he was so
insistent in gaining admission to the class, he stated
that it was so unusual to get anything for nothing here,
that he wasn't going to let a chance to get some free
reading get by him. No, siree!

A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Theodore
Theodore has the most abominable habit of swearing
in public places; it is a trial to be with him within
earshot of the gentler, or, at least, the more careful, sex.
Should he mash his finger in the street car door, he
would stop and curse the door, the carpenter who made
it, the tree it came from, and all the various people
who had handled the lumber along its journey, with
animated references as to the ancestors of each person
concerned.
That Is embarrassing to us in the extreni", because,
when we went through the door, we mashed our finger
and said nothing about it. And it is always unpleasant
to be outdone by anyone.

A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Theodore
Theodore has the most abominable habit of swearing
in public places; it is a trial to be with him within
earshot of the gentler, or, at least, the more careful, sex.
Should he mash his finger in the street car door, he
would stop and curse the door, the carpenter who made
it, the tree it came from, and all the various people
who had handled the lumber along its journey, with
animated references as to the ancestors of each person
concerned.
That Is embarrassing to us in the extreni", because,
when we went through the door, we mashed our finger
and said nothing about it. And it is always unpleasant
to be outdone by anyone.

of one's own free will as it is there.

"Bertram Blivens, son of B. Blivens, Blivens, Idaho,
was shot down while attempting to force his way into a
free reading class this afternoon at the university. He
is expected to recover. When asked why he was so
insistent in gaining admission to the class, he stated

A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Theodore
Theodore has the most abominable habit of swearing
in public places; it is a trial to be with him within
earshot of the gentler, or, at least, the more careful, sex.
Should he mash his finger in the street car door, he
would stop and curse the door, the carpenter who made
it, the tree it came from, and all the various people
who had handled the lumber along its journey, with
animated references as to the ancestors of each person
concerned.
That Is embarrassing to us in the extreni", because,
when we went through the door, we mashed our finger
and said nothing about it. And it is always unpleasant
to be outdone by anyone.

"Teeny" Spargle, football player who asserted that

Verry Verdant, frosh, who says he likes to wear his
dink.
Choc Taw, cook at Kak Eta house, who makes gravy
as he needs it.
Shakespeare Vere-Jones, English major who never
murmured, "I think I follow you, professor."

"So this is Paris," remarked the resourceful queener
as his garter slipped down around his ankle.
"Yes, and isn't it snappy," cooed Louise-Clarissa, as
