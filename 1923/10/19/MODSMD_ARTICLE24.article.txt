FRANKNESS AND "DATES"
"Frankness is a quality which
should be cultivated. In this genera
tion there is altogether too much in
sincerity." This is the opinion of one
of the members of the English de
partment.
That's a thought to ponder over. If
you applied it in everyday life, how
would it work? Take the example of
an undesirable man who asks you for
a date. You haven't one and you don't
want one with him. Of course you hate
to tell him that because you know he
would resent it. If you placed yourself
in his place, you'd resent it yourself,
so why shouldn't he?
At any rate, he asks you for the
date. You say, "I'm SO sorry. I'd
really like to go, but somebody else
asked me to go with him tonight," and
all this time you're thinking, "Hell's
earrings! I can't stand him. Hasn't he
sense enough to realize it? I don't
WANT to go with him, so why does
he bother me? NO!" Imagine saying
that to a man! And the next time you
meet him, would he greet you cor
dially and smile sweetly? HE WOULD
NOT! He would make it a point to
tell everybody else just what sort of
a moron you are, then what a reputa
tion you would have. And that is the
result of frankness.
