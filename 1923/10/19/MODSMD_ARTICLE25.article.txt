# FRANKNESS AND CURRICULUM
## 
### 
Now let us consider frankness with
reference to our curriculum. The ma
jor professor gives an examination in
which he asks you to tell exactly why
the course is of great value to you. If
you told the truth, you would prob
ably indicate in no uncertain terms
that it didn't have any value, that you
were taking it because you had to,
and when you finished the course, you
intended to forget all about it. Would
n't that please him? And of course
you would get an "A" in the course.
Oh yes! Another result of frankness.

The question is, "Does it pay?" The
answer is, "The woman does, but
frankness does not."
