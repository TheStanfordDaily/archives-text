# SOCCER TEAM TANGLES WITH VETERANS TODAY
## Varsity to Clash With Clan MacDonald Eleven in Saturday Contest 
### 
The soccer varsity meets the Ameri
can Legion team of Palo Alto this j
afternoon on the soccer field, in a
game held as part of the American;
Legion sports program. Tomorrow the j
varsity will meet the Clan Mac Donald i
from San Francisco in a scheduled
game in the University and Club Soc
cer league. The freshman eleven will
play its first game against the Bank
of Italy aggregation in a Section 2
University and Club league game. The
Saturday game will also be played on
the soccer field at 2:30.
The varsity has been recognized for
its contests this week. A1 Rogers will
play goal, replacing Walter Campbell.
Rogers is a dependable man at 1 this
position and should be of considerable i
aid to the defensive part of the team.
Fullbacks will be Pollard and Clark, j
Captain Swayne will be center half
and will be flanked by Bucklin and !
Franklin. The forward line will con
sist of Howe, center forward; Mun-1
ford, inside right; Hoover, outside
right; Schoen, inside left; Quigley,
outside left.
Maloney has tried almost every pos
sible arrangement in an effort to get
a team that will be strong both on of-!
fense and defense. In the first game
the defense was weak and in the
second it was the offense. The new
arrangement has yet to be tried in a
game, but in practice it looked good.
A victory in Saturday's game is al-.
most essential to win the league, as j
the team has not won a game yet.
The freshman line-up has not been
announced and will not be selected
until after practice today.
