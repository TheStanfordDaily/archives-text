# HOT DOG! "BUCK" HOWLS AT HEAT; NOW HE'S ON ICE
## 
### 
There are dogs and dogs. The
"hot dog" is a well-known variety
of the canine species. But few know
about the cold dog. However, there
IS one and he's right here on the
campus.
His name is Chi-buck-kuk, com
monly known as "Buck," and he
lives at the Delta Gamma house.
Buck is a puppy of the "Alaskan
Husky" variety. Being an esqui
maux, he doesn't like the warm cli
mate of California, and being a
puppy, he lets everyone know about
it.
During the warm days and nights
of the past week Buck would howl
and howl. Then someone suggested
he be allowed to sleep on the ice
in the refrigerator. Now the D. G.'s
sleep at night. And so does Buck.
