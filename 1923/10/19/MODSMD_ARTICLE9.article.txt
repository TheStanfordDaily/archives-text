"Dink" Templeton, Stanford track
coach, won the high jump at 6 feet,
placed second in the broad jump, and
second in the pole vault in the Ameri
can Legion track meet at Berkeley
yesterday.
Joie Ray, Chicago taxi driver, and
champion mile runner of the United
States, failed for the fifty-second time
to break the world's record for the
mile run, Norman Taber's mark of
4:12 3-5 was not in danger at any time
during the race. Ray's time in the open
event was 4:22 9-10.
The Fremont Post of Palo Alto, com
posed of four Stanford runners, Boles,
Kirksey, Storey, and Van Judah, won

the mile relay in 3:31 4-5 seconds.
Holes and Leistner, two of the best
hurdling prospects in the University,
placed first and second in the 120-yard
high hurdles. The time, however, was
only 0:16 2-5 seconds.
Paddock and Kirksey did not com
pete. The flash from Southern Cali
fornia failed to make an appearance,
and the grudge remains unsettled.
Kirksey won both the Open and
American Legion event in the century
in 0:10 3-5, and 0:10 1-5 seconds re
spectively. Hale of Stanford placed
second to Kirksey in the open cen
tury.
Charley Daley, Card half-miler, won
the 880 yards in the fast pre-season
time of 2:03 4-10.
The Summary:
OPEN EVENTS
One mile—.Toie Ray (Illinois A. C\),
Swobeda (University of California),
Hooper (Olympic, Club). Time 4:22 9-10.
100 yards—Kirksey (Palo Alto), Hale
(Stanford), Farnsworth (University of
California). Time, 0:10 3-10.
Discus—Mapurn (Olympic Club), Neu
experienced team. Nine letter-men, and
four substitutes were the remnants of
the 1922 varsity, and these men form
the 1923 aggregation.
Has Good End Men
Captain Tony Spangler, who plays
end on the Occidental eleven, was last
year considered one of the best ends
in Southern California. Spangler is a
sprinter of note and is good for 10:1
in the century. Cliff Argue, all-around
athlete and also a sprinter, is playing
the other end. The fact that these
two men play the end positions, out
lines the form of attack which Oxy
plans to use, namely, an open game.
Just how far Pipal will succeed in his
mode of offense is doubtful. With the
Cardinal line charging as of late,
breaking up passes and kicks, it would
not be foolish to forecast that the
Occidental mentor is doomed to dis
appointment.
U. S. C. to Be on Hand
U. S. C. will be an interested spec
tator. It is a vital matter for U. S. C.
supporters to determine how much
truth there is in the broadcasted
statements that Stanford at last has
a real scoring machine. Probably be
cause of the interest which U. S. C.
is bound to show, Coach Andy Kerr
will limit his plays absolutely to
straight football.
