# FRESHMEN SMOTHER SAN JOSE TEACHERS AGGREGATION, 79-0
## Babes Find Little Opposition; Win Trio of Grid Games Saturday For Total of 129 Points 
### Walter Campbell 
Stanford freshmen, 79, San Jose Teachers College, 0. The score speaks ;
for itself, and is a good description of the game that was played Saturday
afternoon in the Stanford stadium.
Starting with the first whistle, the babes began their steady march to the
goal line, and over. Outweighing, outplaying, and outguessing the San Jose [
team, the freshmen stifled their opponent's attack. Never was the first year !
men's goal line in danger.
The first score came within four minutes of the start. Making line buck
after line buck, the babes approached the San Jose goal line, only to make a
costly fumble. After regaining the ball on downs, Moore carried the ball over i
the line.
Even old Nero, who enjoyed one-sided contests, would have turned his
thumb down as a signal to stop if his gladiators had staged such a one-sided i
victory. But no Nero appeared, so the slaughter went on.
The second score came when Price, babe center, recovered a San Jose
fumble on the kick-off and carried the ball over. From that time on, the
freshmen scored with machine-like precision. The teachers were wholly

unable to stop the babes, or to
headway against them. San Jose's
only first down came in the first quar
ter.
Against Salinas and Santa Cruz high
schools the second and third freshman
squads had everything their own way.
Salinas went down in the morning on
the short end of a 31-0 score, while
Santa Cruz lost a 19-0 preliminary con
test to the babes before the San Jose
Teachers College game took place.
The only bright spot in the two games
was a run-back of a kick-off through
the entnre Salinas eleven by Riese.
Many Substitutes Used
Coach "Husky" Hunt kept a steady
string of substitutes pouring onto the
field, but instead of the attack dimin
ishing in its intensity, it was greatly j
accelerated. Nearly every man on the
first squad got into the game.
During the first period the freshmen ,
rolled up 14 points, 13 in the second,
27 in the third, and 25 in the fourth. J
These figures show that the second!
string freshmen were as strong in the !
socring as the first, when the diminish
ing strength of the San Jose team is
taken into consideration to offset the
increased number of points in the
later quarters.
Game Is Uninteresting
From the standpoint of an interest
ing football contest or a testing block
for the freshman team, the game was
a failure. But as a confidence-instilling
set-up and as a let-down before the
U. S. C. and California games, it might
have its usefulness.
Out of five attempted passes, the
babes completed three and had one in
tercepted. San Jose completed one out
of two. The freshmen have been us
ing the air to some advantage in re
cent games, and may find that route
successful for gains against the Tro
jan and Bear cubs.
Fewer Fumbles by Babes
The fumbles were much fewer than
in previous games. The first year men
are beginning to handle the ball bet
ter. Hyland fumbled kick-offs twice,
but recovered both times.
The babe line looked well Saturday,
but with San Jose offering but little
opposition, it is hard to judge whethe:*
much improvement has been mads
since the Davis Farm set-back. How
ever, they appear to be in the prime
of condition for the U. S. C. tilt.
Although the first freshmen had an
easy time in making mince-meat of
San Jose Teachers College, they will
run up against a tougher opponent
next week when they tangle with the
Trojan cubs in Los Angeles. The
southern team has been rolling up
large scores this season, and will try
to revenge the 10-9 defeat of last
year. The Trojan eleven has an im
pressive group of stars on its roll, but
whether they will function well to
gether as a team is another question.
