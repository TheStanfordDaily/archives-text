# Religion, Science Do Not Conflict, Says Dr. Gardner

### 
"As chaplain of the University, I am
dealing constantly with the doubts of
young minds about the claims of morality
and difficulties concerning the evidences
of religion," said Dr. Gardner, yesterday
morning in the Memorial Church.
"Can we continue to believe in religion
in light of modern knowledge?" continued
Dr. Gardner. "This questioning atti
tude is not confined to youth. 1 meet
older people who are in doubt.
"Another difficulty, felt especially in a
place of learning, is the apparent opposi
tion of science and religion. There is no
real opposition, and the idea of warfare
arises from a misunderstanding, the con
tusion of religion with theology."
Dr. Gardner cited the modern tendency
to point to the humble beginnings of
religion and morality. But what of the
"pathetic amateurism" of the early as
trologers and of the beginners in medi
cine? These do not discredit modern
discoveries.
"The historical Christ appeals to the
practical man, the mystical Christ ap
peals to the saint. And between the two
the humble Christian stands wistfully in
adoration.
"And so I conclude: Christ has proved
Himself through all the Christian cen
turies a worthy guide to mortal man in
life and death. His gospel answers the
questions of being, duty, and destiny."
