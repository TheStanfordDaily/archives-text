## 
### 
At the request of the superintendent of
the Palo Alto hospital. Dr. W. H. Bar
row, medical adviser of the University,
today made the following statement in
regard to the use of the hospital by
Stanford students :
"The attention of the students is called
to the regulation that patients may not
be admitted to the hospital except on the
order of a doctor. This does not apply,
of course, to accident or emergency cases.
Large hospitals have an admitting phy
sician or resident physician who sees all
cases coming to the hospital and admits
patients to the hospital. The Palo Alto
hospital, however, has no admitting of
ficer, and it is therefore necessary that
the patient see an outside doctor first and
engage his services for medical attention
at the hospital.
"It is also requested that students take
with them toilet articles and the like, since
the hospital can not be cxpected to fur
nish these.
"There have recently been complaints
that some patients have not been too sick
to be unduly noisy at the time of coming
to the hospital, and also that visitors for
got that there were patients in the hos
pital who were seriously ill and who
were considerably upset by the noise at
all hours during the day and night.
"Visiting hours at the hospital are from
2 to 4 p. m. and from 7 to 8 p. m. These
hours must be strictly observed in order
that the routine work of the hospital may
be carried on."
