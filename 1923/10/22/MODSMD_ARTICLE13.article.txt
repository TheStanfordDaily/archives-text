# CARD VARSITY SOCCERITES VICTORIOUS IN TWO GAMES
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity soccer eleven
downed the American Legion team of
Palo Alto by the score of 5-0 Friday,
and on Saturday sent the Clan Mac-
Donald eleven back to San Francisco
with a 2-1 defeat. The Card freshmen
did not fare so well in their first
game, losing to the Bank of Italy by
a 2-1 score. Both varsity games were
league contests in Section 1 of the
University and Club league, while the
freshman game was in Section 2 of
the league.
After numerous changes in lineup
and a complete reorganization of the
team, Maloney has secured an aggre
gation that looks like the champion
ship teams of former years. The men
uncorked a powerful offense, and
backed by an air-tight defense had
things their own way in both contests.
Howe and Munford on tho forward
line, Swayne, at center half and Rog
ers at goal displayed a good brand of
ball.
The American Legion men were
completely outplayed by a much faster
team. Munford and Howe had little

difficulty breaking through the Legion
defense for scores. In the first half,
the Stanford men scored 3 goals, and
in the following period, 2 were chalked
up. Munford was responsible for 3 and
Howe for 2. The Stanford men allowed
the former soldiers only two or three
shots at goal, all of which failed. The
ball was in the Legion territory most
of the time.
Stanford did not start the second
game with much speed. The Clan Mac-
Donald men more than held their own
during the first half, and were able to
score one goal. The half ended with
the Clan leading, 1-0.
In the second period the Stanford
men came back with determination,
and soon worked the ball to within
striking distance of the Mac Donald
goal. Howe got in a good kick at the
ball and it went sailing through for
tho first Stanford score. The ball then
went back and forth but was in the
Clan territory most of the time for the
next few minutes Howe dr.opped back
to center half and Swayne took his
place at center forward. This change
seemed to have the right result, for
Swayne shot a long kick into the cor
ner of the goal, putting the Stanford
men ahead.
This victory gives the Cards a .500
percentage in the league. The Vikings
seem to have the edge in the league at
present and the only hope for Stan
ford taking the penant will be the
defeat of the Vikings by some other
team, as Stanford has already battled
them and lost.
The freshmen were playing their
first game of the season when they
lost to the Bank of Italy. The babes
appear to have a good team, but the
men lack experience. Their play lacks

the finished quality necessary for win
ning aggregations.
