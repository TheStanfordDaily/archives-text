# GRAYS WALK OVER MARE ISLAND SQUAD BY SCORE OF 27-0
## "Nick" Kirwan Works Well as Quarterback; Hospital Defense Is Weak 
### 
Straight football enabled the Stan
ford Grays to defeat the Mare Island
Naval Hospital eleven 27-0 in the sta
dium last Friday afternoon. End runs
and off-tackle bucks predominated in
the attack used by the Grays.
The Mare Island at no time proved
dangerous. They made first downs but
three times, once in the second quar
ter, and twice in the fourth period
when they completed two forward
passes.
The Stanford team, composed of
men from the Gray squad and players
whom Andy Kerr had not taken south,
displayed an offensive which easily
took them down the field for four
touchdowns.
"Nick" Kirwan, playing quarterback
and acting captain, drove the Grays
with the precision of a field general,
and in the exchange of punts, he out
classed the sailor kicker.
The first score came ten minutes
after the quarter began. Fifteen plays,
most oT which were end runs, put the
Grays across the goal, with Jack Er
horn carrying the ball. Erhorn at all
times was a steady ground gainer.
The second touchdown was scored
by Jim Coplin in the second quarter,
the Cardinal team using practically
identical tactics as in the previous
period. Farish scored again in the sec
ond quarter on an intercepted pass,
and Jim Coplin went over the line
for the fourth score five minutes be
fore the game ended.
"Porky" Dwight converted three of
the scores, but the ball hit the cross
bar on the fourth attempt.
