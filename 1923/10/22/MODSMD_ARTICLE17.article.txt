# CARDS TROUNCE OCCIDENTAL, 42-0
## BOTH TEAMS MAKE MANY FUMBLES AND CONTEST IS RAGGED Stanford Eleven Takes Advantage of Breaks, Outpunts Tigers, Blocks Kicks for Scores 
### Tom Irwin 
Andy Kerr's Cardinal eleven triumphed over Coach Joe Pipal's light Occi
dental College team in Los Angeles last Saturday in one of the greatest
fumbling duels ever staged in California. It was a triumph for Stanford
because her eleven won by a score of 42 to 0, not because of good football,
but in spite of bad. Those who saw the results of fumbles in the Santa Clara
game saw only results. To have seen messy handling of the apple, they
should have journeyed to the Southland and observed, with some 20,000
spectators, one of the most remarkable juggling exhibitions on record. Had
it not been for the fact that Stanford made the breaks and took advantage
of them, the score would never have aone above twentv-nro

Four Fumbles in Ten Minutes
Perhaps had the sun not been so
unreasonable, the lack of punch and
team play Saturday would not have
been so obvious. The heat, no doubt,
coupled with fatigue after the first
quarter, was partly to blame for jug
gling. But even in the first ten min
uter of play there were four fumblep,
at least three too many for a full
game at this time of the season.
There were three bright spots in
the whole performance. Stanford made
the breaks by blocking punts alid fol
lowing the ball, thus accounting for
at least three scores. Nevers and
Cleaveland outpunted the opposition
fully twenty yards. And the third cure
for blues was the fact that if Stanford
didn't show anything, she didn't have
to. The same plays that were used
against Nevada and Santa Clara were
all that the Cards tried at Los An
geles.
Cards Score on Breaks
The game was practically sewed up
for Stanford when on the first play
after Occidental kicked off, Nevers
punted 50 yards to Slioaf who was hit
so hard by Cravens that the ' ball
squirted up in the air and into Thom
as' arms for a Card touchdown. That
tackle meant 14 points for Stanford,
for on the kick-off following, Nevers
once more punted 50 yards to Shoaf
who was still groggy and dropped the
ball for Jim Lawson to recover. Then.
Nevers fumbled and Garey of Occi
dental grabbed it. Shoaf, not yet re
covered 1 , punted 15 yards out of
bounds. Nevers made 20> yards and
Cleaveland lost five on a fumble.
Three plays later Cleaveland scored
and Campbell kicked goal.
Making and taking breaks account
ed for the third score, as well. Early
in the second period Baker blocked
Shoaf's punt and Cravens recovered
for Stanford on Occidental's 23-yard
line. Cleaveland made five yards at
right tackle, and Nevers on the next
play crashed through left tackle for
18 yards and a touchdown. Campbell
again made the extra point.
Cuddeback went in for Cleaveland
before Occidental kicked off and se
cured a fifteen-yard penalty for Stan
ford for talking before a play had
been run. After Nevers had punted
back from the kick-off, Campbell in
tercepted a Tiger pass. Nevers then
punted 45 yards to Shoaf. The ball
just grazed his fingers and Dole
swooped down and carried the oval
across for the fourth score.
Oxy Holds for Downs
Before the half was over Occidental
held Stanford for downs on her 1-foot
line as the result of a loss on ex
changes of punts.
Andy Kerr started his second string
at the beginning of the third period.
The Cards clearly had the advantage
but failed to score. Cuddeback barely
missed a place kick from the 38-yard
line just before the first team went
back into the game at the close of the.
quarter.
After Nevers had drilled the center
of the line for thirty yards on four
plays, Cleaveland and Wheat took the
ball to the 5-yard line, where Wheat
galloped across around left end. Camp
bell again kicked goal and the score
stood: Stanford, 35; Occidental, 0.
This was the first flash of a consistent
offense for the Cards.
Hey Does Good Work
Cliff Hey then went in for Nevers
and made his best showing for this
season. He carried the ball forty yards
in four bucks and scored off tackle
from the 3-yard line. Campbell made
the score. Stanford, 42; Occidental, 0.

Williamson went in at half and was
the green-pea f or the time-honored
'shoestring play which netted Occi
dental 30 yards and first downs for
the first time in the game. Ludeke,
however, blocked Shoaf's attempted
place kick. Williamson fumbled, West
gate recovered. Westgate fumbled,
Hunt recovered. Half the people in
the press box got up and went home
and probably never will recover. Stan
ford proceeded to make two first
downs, but Shoaf intercepted Camp
bell's pass. Shoaf punted to Campbell,
and on first play Campbell fumbled
and Garey recovered for the Tigers. I
Cleaveland then intercepted Smith's
pass and loped thirty yards. Campbell
passed 10 yards to Hey. Ridderhof in
tercepted Campbell's pass on his own
10-yard line and everybody went home. '
If the Cards play next Saturday as
they did last, some of us won't have
any homes to go to.

for Stanford when on the first play
after Occidental kicked off, Nevers
punted 50 yards to Slioaf who was hit
so hard by Cravens that the ' ball
squirted up in the air and into Thom
as' arms for a Card touchdown. That
tackle meant 14 points for Stanford,
for on the kick-off following, Nevers
once more punted 50 yards to Shoaf
who was still groggy and dropped the
ball for Jim Lawson to recover. Then.
Nevers fumbled and Garey of Occi
dental grabbed it. Shoaf, not yet re
covered 1 , punted 15 yards out of
bounds. Nevers made 20> yards and
Cleaveland lost five on a fumble.
Three plays later Cleaveland scored
and Campbell kicked goal.
Making and taking breaks account
ed for the third score, as well. Early
in the second period Baker blocked
Shoaf's punt and Cravens recovered
for Stanford on Occidental's 23-yard
line. Cleaveland made five yards at
right tackle, and Nevers on the next
play crashed through left tackle for
18 yards and a touchdown. Campbell
again made the extra point.
Cuddeback went in for Cleaveland
before Occidental kicked off and se
cured a fifteen-yard penalty for Stan
ford for talking before a play had
been run. After Nevers had punted
back from the kick-off, Campbell in
tercepted a Tiger pass. Nevers then
punted 45 yards to Shoaf. The ball
just grazed his fingers and Dole
swooped down and carried the oval
across for the fourth score.
Oxy Holds for Downs
Before the half was over Occidental
held Stanford for downs on her 1-foot
line as the result of a loss on ex
changes of punts.
Andy Kerr started his second string
at the beginning of the third period.
The Cards clearly had the advantage
but failed to score. Cuddeback barely
missed a place kick from the 38-yard
line just before the first team went
back into the game at the close of the.
quarter.
After Nevers had drilled the center
of the line for thirty yards on four
plays, Cleaveland and Wheat took the
ball to the 5-yard line, where Wheat
galloped across around left end. Camp
bell again kicked goal and the score
stood: Stanford, 35; Occidental, 0.
This was the first flash of a consistent
offense for the Cards.
Hey Does Good Work
Cliff Hey then went in for Nevers
and made his best showing for this
season. He carried the ball forty yards
in four bucks and scored off tackle
from the 3-yard line. Campbell made
the score. Stanford, 42; Occidental, 0.

Williamson went in at half and was
the green-pea f or the time-honored
'shoestring play which netted Occi
dental 30 yards and first downs for
the first time in the game. Ludeke,
however, blocked Shoaf's attempted
place kick. Williamson fumbled, West
gate recovered. Westgate fumbled,
Hunt recovered. Half the people in
the press box got up and went home
and probably never will recover. Stan
ford proceeded to make two first
downs, but Shoaf intercepted Camp
bell's pass. Shoaf punted to Campbell,
and on first play Campbell fumbled
and Garey recovered for the Tigers. I
Cleaveland then intercepted Smith's
pass and loped thirty yards. Campbell
passed 10 yards to Hey. Ridderhof in
tercepted Campbell's pass on his own
10-yard line and everybody went home. '

Andy Kerr's Cardinal eleven triumphed over Coach Joe Pipal's light Occi
dental College team in Los Angeles last Saturday in one of the greatest
fumbling duels ever staged in California. It was a triumph for Stanford
because her eleven won by a score of 42 to 0, not because of good football,
but in spite of bad. Those who saw the results of fumbles in the Santa Clara
game saw only results. To have seen messy handling of the apple, they
should have journeyed to the Southland and observed, with some 20,000

Four Fumbles in Ten Minutes
Perhaps had the sun not been so
unreasonable, the lack of punch and
team play Saturday would not have
been so obvious. The heat, no doubt,
coupled with fatigue after the first
quarter, was partly to blame for jug
gling. But even in the first ten min
uter of play there were four fumblep,
at least three too many for a full
game at this time of the season.
There were three bright spots in
the whole performance. Stanford made
the breaks by blocking punts alid fol
lowing the ball, thus accounting for
at least three scores. Nevers and
Cleaveland outpunted the opposition
fully twenty yards. And the third cure
for blues was the fact that if Stanford
didn't show anything, she didn't have
to. The same plays that were used

all that the Cards tried at Los An

Andy Kerr's Cardinal eleven triumphed over Coach Joe Pipal's light Occi
dental College team in Los Angeles last Saturday in one of the greatest
fumbling duels ever staged in California. It was a triumph for Stanford
because her eleven won by a score of 42 to 0, not because of good football,
but in spite of bad. Those who saw the results of fumbles in the Santa Clara
game saw only results. To have seen messy handling of the apple, they
should have journeyed to the Southland and observed, with some 20,000
spectators, one of the most remarkable juggling exhibitions on record. Had
it not been for the fact that Stanford made the breaks and took advantage
of them, the score would never have aone above twentv-nro

Four Fumbles in Ten Minutes
Perhaps had the sun not been so
unreasonable, the lack of punch and
team play Saturday would not have
been so obvious. The heat, no doubt,
coupled with fatigue after the first
quarter, was partly to blame for jug
gling. But even in the first ten min
uter of play there were four fumblep,
at least three too many for a full
game at this time of the season.
There were three bright spots in
the whole performance. Stanford made
the breaks by blocking punts alid fol
lowing the ball, thus accounting for
at least three scores. Nevers and
Cleaveland outpunted the opposition
fully twenty yards. And the third cure
for blues was the fact that if Stanford
didn't show anything, she didn't have
to. The same plays that were used
against Nevada and Santa Clara were
all that the Cards tried at Los An
geles.
Cards Score on Breaks
The game was practically sewed up
for Stanford when on the first play
after Occidental kicked off, Nevers
punted 50 yards to Slioaf who was hit
so hard by Cravens that the ' ball
squirted up in the air and into Thom
as' arms for a Card touchdown. That
tackle meant 14 points for Stanford,
for on the kick-off following, Nevers
once more punted 50 yards to Shoaf
who was still groggy and dropped the
ball for Jim Lawson to recover. Then.
Nevers fumbled and Garey of Occi
dental grabbed it. Shoaf, not yet re
covered 1 , punted 15 yards out of
bounds. Nevers made 20> yards and
Cleaveland lost five on a fumble.
Three plays later Cleaveland scored
and Campbell kicked goal.
Making and taking breaks account
ed for the third score, as well. Early
in the second period Baker blocked
Shoaf's punt and Cravens recovered
for Stanford on Occidental's 23-yard
line. Cleaveland made five yards at
right tackle, and Nevers on the next
play crashed through left tackle for
18 yards and a touchdown. Campbell
again made the extra point.
Cuddeback went in for Cleaveland
before Occidental kicked off and se
cured a fifteen-yard penalty for Stan
ford for talking before a play had
been run. After Nevers had punted
back from the kick-off, Campbell in
tercepted a Tiger pass. Nevers then
punted 45 yards to Shoaf. The ball
just grazed his fingers and Dole
swooped down and carried the oval
across for the fourth score.
Oxy Holds for Downs
Before the half was over Occidental
held Stanford for downs on her 1-foot
line as the result of a loss on ex
changes of punts.
Andy Kerr started his second string
at the beginning of the third period.
