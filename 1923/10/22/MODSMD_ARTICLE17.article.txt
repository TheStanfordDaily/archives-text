# CARDS TROUNCE OCCIDENTAL, 42-0
## BOTH TEAMS MAKE MANY FUMBLES AND CONTEST IS RAGGED Stanford Eleven Takes Advantage of Breaks, Outpunts Tigers, Blocks Kicks for Scores 
### Tom Irwin 
Andy Kerr's Cardinal eleven triumphed over Coach Joe Pipal's light Occi
dental College team in Los Angeles last Saturday in one of the greatest
fumbling duels ever staged in California. It was a triumph for Stanford
because her eleven won by a score of 42 to 0, not because of good football,
but in spite of bad. Those who saw the results of fumbles in the Santa Clara
game saw only results. To have seen messy handling of the apple, they
should have journeyed to the Southland and observed, with some 20,000
spectators, one of the most remarkable juggling exhibitions on record. Had
it not been for the fact that Stanford made the breaks and took advantage
of them, the score would never have aone above twentv-nro

Four Fumbles in Ten Minutes
Perhaps had the sun not been so
unreasonable, the lack of punch and
team play Saturday would not have
been so obvious. The heat, no doubt,
coupled with fatigue after the first
quarter, was partly to blame for jug
gling. But even in the first ten min
uter of play there were four fumblep,
at least three too many for a full
game at this time of the season.
There were three bright spots in
the whole performance. Stanford made
the breaks by blocking punts alid fol
lowing the ball, thus accounting for
at least three scores. Nevers and
Cleaveland outpunted the opposition
fully twenty yards. And the third cure
for blues was the fact that if Stanford
didn't show anything, she didn't have
to. The same plays that were used
against Nevada and Santa Clara were
all that the Cards tried at Los An
geles.
Cards Score on Breaks
The game was practically sewed up
for Stanford when on the first play
after Occidental kicked off, Nevers
punted 50 yards to Slioaf who was hit
so hard by Cravens that the ' ball
squirted up in the air and into Thom
as' arms for a Card touchdown. That
tackle meant 14 points for Stanford,
for on the kick-off following, Nevers
once more punted 50 yards to Shoaf
who was still groggy and dropped the
ball for Jim Lawson to recover. Then.
