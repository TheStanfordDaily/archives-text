# THE
						POINT "SYSTEM"
## 
### 
Scene: A. S. S.U. offices in the Administration
building; oil the right the customary atmosphere of
big business exudes from the Quad office; on the
left the Clerk is countersigning student body checks
with a sour expression.
Time: Maybe next month, maybe never.
Enter a long, lean, underfed, and haggard indi
vidual ; he goes through the gate without stopping
to open it, and makes for a huge filing cabinet cen
ter rear. This cabinet takes up most of the middle
room. The haggard individual dives into the top
drawer and emerges a few seconds later clasping
a sheaf of cards, which he paws over feverishly.
, Enter a student, in a sombrero and a rage.
Student: Say! I got this postcard.
Filing clerk (glad to leave the cabinet even for a
minute): That's nothing. I sent it.
Student: What's it mean?
Clerk: Hmmm. A8257092ju5. Wait a minute.
Clerk takes card, and starts hunting through cabi
net. Half an hour elapses, just like that. Clerk
returns, waving another card triumphantly.
Clerk: Ha! You're doing too much. Let's see—
you're taking swimming, debate, managing a student
organization, and you're on the endowment com
mittee. 'S too much.
Student: Well?
Clerk: You'll have to drop one. Your card says
you have fourteen points in student activities.
You re only allowed twelve. Better give up swim
ming.
Student: Huh. And lose a chance to make the
team. Not.
Clerk: Well, then
1 Student: Listen. I'm going to make a letter in
swimming, T belong to a debating society because I
like it, I'm manager of that organization because I
need the money, and I'm on the endowment com
mittee because I want to do something to help out
the University.
Clerk: Your studies will suffer.
Student: Yes, I might get a few B's instead of
the A's I drew last quarter. That's my business.
Clerk: You'll have to quit something. You're
doing too much.
i Student: That also is my business. Try and make
me. (Exit, fortissimo.)
Clerk: Gosh. j
The above is a free sample of what will happen
in about a month if the point system continues 011
the A. S. S. U. constitution. For this reason the
Executive committee is giving the student body a
chance in Thursday's election to vofe 011 the blunder
made last year. If the students think that such
regulation is necessary the time of the above scene
can be made "Any day in 1923-24."
