# HOW TO AVOID MONDAY CLASSES
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto has received a complaint
from the Department of Physical Education that
students go down to the Palo Alto hospital with
alleged "nervous breakdowns," because the week
end has been so strenuous that the thought of
classes on Monday causes heart palpitation. These
students, who go to the hospital ostensibly to re
cover from the effects of too much of one kind of
party, decide after they arrive that everything is not
so gloomy as painted, and have a rather noisy good
time with solicitous friends. Therefore the com
plaint.
The Daily would like to suggest that, for the
benefit of the other sufferers and for their own
sense of decency, that these temporary patients
make sure the party is over before going to the
hospital.
