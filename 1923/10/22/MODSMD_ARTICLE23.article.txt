"Say, mister, got a cigarette?"
"The Yanks has come the way you bet?"
"Gosh, but I lost all but my shoes,
"A-bettin' on that team to lose;
"I figgered that, with Ruth all shot : :
"Now here's a tip—l got it HOT . .
"A little off the top and side,
"And say, just let them side-burns ride."
"A shave, a hair-cut, and shampoo . . .
Say, here's a joke that's new to you . .
So goes the chatter, all inane,
Why don't more barbers go insane? —H. M.

Opinions of prominent students and members of the
student body on the proposed change of the ex-commit
tee's proposed change of the basketball pavilion, as
collected by Cabbages' corps of inquiring reporters:
Horace Onfitzer, Encina Hall: "I think all the bleach
ers should be removed. Then there would be room
enough for two courts, and both halves of the Big Game
could be played at once, thus saving time. And imagine
the excitement as both halves draw to a close at the
same time! It would be just twice as good."
Romulus Smith, Branner Hall (some day): "What did
we build the basketball pavilion for, if we didn't build
it for dances? Statistics show that the basketball play
ers use the floor more times for dances than they do for
basketball. What is the abvious conclusion?"
Mike O'Blowitzer, Temporary Union: "If the boys who
are so anxious to put permanent bleachers in would try
to take them out after each basketball game so they
could dance, they would see what they are up against.
I'm all for permanent bleachers."
William De Mere, Alpha Alpha Alpha: "The way
dances are going, we are going to need more and more
room, especially if the tango comes in. Personally, I
don't care how small the space becomes. It improves my
style, for I prefer the old-fashioned dances."

The Friday Frisk was revived again last week. Now
for the Monday Muddle, the Tuesday Twitch, the
Wednesday Wobble, the Thursday Thurcus, the Satur
day Slink, and the Sunday Suffer.

The bleacher rally last Thursday was calculated by
experts to be 176.84 times as large as it was last year.
Reports from California indicate the atendance there is
about equal to last season's.
Roll your own dope.

The Jolly-Up is now coming into a lot of hot pro and
con, mostly con. »
But all it needs, evidently, is a few simple rules. Why
not the following:
1. The women shall be barred from crashing the gates
before 8 p.m. No more than the regular 500 shall be
admitted.
2. All men who have cords shall be escorted to the
pavilion by the Palo Afto police department, and all
exits shall be closed and guarded by United States
Marines.
3. The women shall be lined up at the kitchen end of
the pavilion, with the men in a body fifteen feet in
front; everyone facing toward the far end.
4. At a signal, to be given by blowing Jthe power house
whistle for five minutes, the chase will start. All men
who reach the opposite end of the building safely
shall be allowed to leave.
5. No couple shall be allowed to dance together for
more than 3 hours and a half without being introduced.
6. Closing time shall be determined by a vote to be
taken among those present, provided,

Cheer up—the milk and snail diet in the New Union
"bar" is being varied. Last Thursday they had no milk.
Speculators (mostly law and medicine students, who
are "in" on the "know") are reported snooping around
buying up Bookstore Coupons on margin.
Our advice is, hold on to your investments.
At the end of the year, "Bookstore coupons closed
at 107 V&" is a probability.
