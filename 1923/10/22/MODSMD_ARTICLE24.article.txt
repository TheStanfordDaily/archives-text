# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
In one of your first editorials this
quarter you pointed out the mistake
made in abolishing credit for physical
training. It was very gratifying to note
that there was organized sentiment in
that regard, though it was hoped that
other editorials of a similar tone would
follow.
The writer had a long talk with
one of the principal perpetrators of
that little bit of foolishness, in the
latter's office at the gym some time
last year before the new ruling went
into effect. The principal argument at
the time seemed to be that "at Har
vard" no credit was given for gym and
yet that university managed to worry
along. Stanford, being the Harvard of
the West, would do well to follow in
the footsteps of that old and admirable
institution, from which this particular
person was graduated. Nothing was
said at the time about making the
wearing of knickerbockers compul
sory or giving University credit for
tea-dansants, though it must be said
that his argument lacked consistency
in that respect.
Nevertheless it is a fact that a large
number of students now go without
regular physical exercise-merely be
cause no credit is given for gym work.
The average student who is not natur
ally an athlete has to force himself to
take enough exercise and commonly
does not take enough for his own
good. Now It happens that this type of
student has an exaggerated idea of
University credit and will work harder
for it than his more athletic brother.
It follows that the best and only pos
sible encouragement toward exercise
for students of this type is University
credit, for they are admittedly not
worthy of regular athletic rewards.
Nevertheless the whole situation is
disgusting, especially so when one
considers that the person who was
most influential in abolishing credit
for gym should, by training and pro
fession, be very particularly in a posi
tion to understand the value of regu
lar physical exercise. â€”D. C. R.
