# TOUR OF GERMANY WILL BE SUBJECT OF TUESDAY TALK
## Professor M. S. Wildman Will Discuss One Phase of European Trip 
### 
Experiences in Germany, on which
Professor M. S. Wildman, head of the
| economics department, will talk tomorrow
| evening at 7:30 in the Little Theater, are
; one phase of his seven months' tour of
; western Europe and the Mediterranean
countries.
Leaving the United States in January,
Professor Wildman stopped first at the
Madiera Islands. The streets of Funchal,
the principal city of Madiera, were par
ticularly interesting, according to his ac
count. They arc paved with stones the
size of hens' eggs. Grass grows in the
crevices and the damp weather makes it
extremely slick.
"When we got off the ship, we rode in
an ox-cart with runners instead of
wheels," he said. "This is the customary
mode of travel. Runners are more suc
cessful than wheels on this type of pav
ing."
Professor Wildman toured the British
Isles, France, Italy, and Switzerland, and
sailed around the Mediterranean, stopping
at Athens, Constantinople, and Palestine,
and spending two weeks in Egypt.
"Egypt impressed me as a place in
which there were too many people," was
his opinion. "The country looks just like
it does in the movies, camels and all. We
stopped at Alexandria, Cairo, and Luxor,
and went up the Nile to the tomb of
Tut-Ankh-Amen. At the time we were
there, none of the excavation work was
going on, as there was some dispute as
to who had the right to take away the
things."
In Palestine Professor Wildman noted
that Jerusalem was thronged with refu
gees from Armenia and Asia Minor. The
country is becoming quite prosperous.
Jews moving in from Russia and the
Balkans are bringing a more energetic
form of agriculture.
