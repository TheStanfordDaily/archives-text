I Rebates are Ready
Year ending Aug. 31, 1923, 10 per |
cent on all receipts turned in by cer- j
tificate holders $5000 will be paid 1
in cash. 1
The Stanford Bookstore is co-operative. No dividends to f
Stockholders, but Service and Saving for Stanford students. |
The Directors and Members are Faculty men who serve without |
pay. Their chances to profit are just the same as yours. 1
The service consists in supplying just what you need just ®
when you need it. |
The saving comes in paying cash and turning in the Receipts. |
If you are interested in saving, sign up for a Certificate at the Office.
It will cost you nothing, just turn in the Receipts once a month and
share in the profits at the end of the year. |
The Directors have organized the Bookstore so successfully
that the overhead expense is small. This means lower prices to |
begin with. We cannot afford to operate at a loss. We cannot
figure close enough to come out even, so we aim to make a small
profit—hence the rebate.
