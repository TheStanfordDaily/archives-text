# FRESHMEN TO BATTLE TROJAN BABES IN SOUTH
## Card Yearlings Confident of Beating Southerners in Coliseum Saturday 
### 
With the crushing 79-to-0 defeat of
San Jose Teachers College still fresh
in their minds, Cardinal freshmen fol
lowers are optimistic over the out
come of next Saturday's combat with
the U. S. C. babes.
When the Card babes trot onto the
Los Angeles stadium turf next Satur
day afternoon, they will be confronted
by eleven determined Trojans. The
Southerners still remember the 10-9
upset of last year, and mean to wreak
ample vengeance for it.
The Stanford freshman line must
not be counted out of the contest.
From Adams or Shipkey on one end,
to Greisser on the other, it will be in
the thick of the fray every moment
of the time. The Best brothers from
Santa Ana, at the guards, and Morton
Kaer of Red Bluff, at end, will find
that they have a harder job cut out
for them than against the southern
high schools.
Coach Leo Calland of U. S. C. has
had a superabundance of high school
stars with which to build a co-ordinat
ing machine. Not so with Coach Hunt
of Stanford. While the material has
been good, he has largely developed
his own stars.
