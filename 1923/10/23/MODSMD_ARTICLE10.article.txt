# ORIGINAL PLAN OF PAVILION CHANGED DECLARES McHOSE
## Student Sentiment Holds It "Dancing Pavilion," and Opposes Seating 
### 
When the pavilion was first planned,
it was called a "basketball pavilion;"
now the student sentiment seems to
be to change the name to "dancing
pavilion."
"Nip" McHose, captain of the 1924
basketball team, thus analyzed the
expressed opinions of various mem
bers of the student body in an inter
view today.
"Unless Stanford values a slightly
used floor space at two dances above
the extra benefit in needed funds and
accommodation in at least four bas
ketball games," he said, "the benefits
from abolition of the old temporary j
bleachers are almost too obvious to j
mention,
"Aside from the fact that 1200 more i
students and alumni can find com
fortable seats at the California and
U. S. C. games, that the extra 1200
paid admissions will give an added
fund to Stanford athletics —which j
most of us on the campus seem will- j
ing to go great lengths to support—
the new plan for the pavilion will help
the very ones who are kicking.
"The floor space will not be cut
down so that dancers will be crowded;
that's all bunk. What will happen is
this: the space on the main floor for
merly taken over bodily by the roughs
will be covered with seats, which will
undoubtedly also be used by roughs;
the floor space will be sufficient to
accommodate easily five hundred cou
ples, which is ample for Stanford's
social purposes.
"Much less than one-third of the
present floor will actually be covered,
and most of that space is a total loss
even at the cotillion and prom."
The pavilion is not beautiful, any
way, said Mcllose. In fact, he strongly
linited that the place was nothing but
a barn as far as dance-liall appear
ances went. The addition of perman
ent bleachers would add to its esthetic i
beauty instead of detracting. The rows
of permanent seats would make the
pavilion infinitely easier to decorate,
and provide better for the roughs.
The alumni reunion and University
Day will be one of the greatest gain
ers by the new plan, McHose ex
plained, for the permanent bleachers
will make possible the terraced tabl6
scheme, enabling every one at the
dinner to see the entertainmenl on the
floor blow. This table arrangement
could also be used at future cotillions
and proms with just as much advan
tage.
"Nobody can deny that under the
present expanded athletic manage
ment Stanford teams need all the sup
port additional funds can give," Mc-
Hose concluded. "With the passing of
the temporary makeshift bleachers
alumni and students will not only be
accommodated in some semblance of
order, but the additional funds would
enable the Cardinal to send a track
team of twenty-five East, to provide
more supplies for intramural games,
or to increase the crowded facilities
of Encina gymnasium. Against these
arguments I hear this: 'The prom and
the cotillion will be too crowded; the
basketball pavilion is also a dancing
pavilion; we must have our two big
dances as pleasant as possible'."
