## 
### 
"Greek universities have no inter
collegiate athletics, nor are they divid
ed into freshman, sophomore, junior
and senior classes," declares Professor
A. T. Murray, of the Classical Liter
ature department. "The students form
groups according to the sections from
which they came, or in accordance
with special common interests.
"Although Greece is rather back
ward than forward in matters of edu
cation, a strong effort is being made
to put educational facilities in the
reach of everyone. All classes are re
presented in the universities, which
have large enrollments.
"The Greek government supports
the University of Athens, which cele
brated its seventy-fifth anniversary a
few years ago, and many technical
schools. These technical schools fill an

important place in the education of
the country. Formerly students were
confined to liberal studies preparatory
to professional life. Now the technical
schools train many for engineering
work and the applied sciences," Pro
fessor Murray says.
"The fees are very low. Besides the
universities, which are co-educational,
branches of the technical school for
men are located all over the country.
The university buildings at Athens are
especially fine."
Professor Murray was a member of
; the faculty of the American School of
I Classical Studies last year. This is one
i of a number of special archeological
schools in Athens, others of which are
I supported by the German, Austrian,
Italian, French, and English govern
ments.
