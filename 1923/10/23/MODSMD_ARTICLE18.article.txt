# VARSITY SCRIMMAGES COLLEGE OF PACIFIC GRIDMEN TOMORROW
## Kerr Working to Eliminate Fumbles By Card Backfield Players; Injuries to Squad Light 
### 
Preparatory to the U. S. C. game next Saturday Coach Andy Kerr has
scheduled a light practice scrimmage with the College of the Pacific eleven
to take place in the stadium tomorrow at 4 o'clock.
"Swede" Righter, former Stanford football and basketball star, is coachiug
the Pacific eleven, and it is reputed to be a powerful and aggressive, but
light, combination.
Kerr hopes to give the Card team another chance to learn how to handle
the ball more consistently before bucking the strong Trojan outfit.
Most every student who follows the fortunes and misfortunes of the varsity
is probably worrying about the terms he reads so frequently—fumbling—
ragged playing. Fumbling and ragged playing are delinquencies which can
be remedied.
The team which can make her own breaks, and hold an opponent to one
down during four quarters need not worry profusely over fumbling. Not only
making breaks, but taking advantage of them. Twice in succession Stanford

guards and ends hit the Oxy safety
man so hard that he fumbled. It means
that the line was plunging and plung
ing hard; the ends were under the
kicks, and the tackles were sure.
The kicking of Nevers and Cleave
land was far superior to the Occi
dental punting. Punters who can be
depended on for forty-five yards, and
ends who can cover the punts. Not so
bad.
Perhaps Baker's passing to the back
field was a little speedy. Several of
the backs complained. Baker should
easily learn to lob the ball to the backB
before Saturday.
Little Andy's latest find is Cliff
Hey, fullback. During the closing mo
ments of the game Cliff was hitting
the line like a steam roller. In the
fourth period he carried the ball 20
yards to Oxy's one-yard line, and
bucked it over for a score on the
succeeding play.
Injuries on the squad were com
paratively light. Chuck Johnston
wrenched a ligament in his neck. Jim
Lawson has two sore ribs, and Dennis
a bruised knee. They are not serious
enough to keep any of the players out
of the game with U. S. C. Saturday.
