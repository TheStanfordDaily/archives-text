# TRAGO WILL ATTEND FRATERNITY COUNCIL
## 
### 
Gene Trago will represent Stanford
Fraternities at the national Inter
fraternity Conference this year at
New York. Trago, president of the
local conference for this year, was
unanimously elected at its meeting
last night.
This is the first time that under
graduates have been invited to sit at
this conference. Formerly the mem
bers have all been graduates of the
various fraternities, and the active
men have had no voice. It was gener
ally felt that Stanford would eventu
ally send a delegate, and that in view
of the circumstances it would be ad
visable to send a man to the first
meeting. It will be held at the Hotel
Pennsylvania on November 30 and
December 1.
Rushing in various forms was also
discussed. It was definitely announced
that all infractions of the present
rushing rules, which were adopted
last year by the conference, would be
severely dealt with, and that the house
so violating the rules would be pun
ished by the board. Trago expressed
himself as being very well satisfied
with the way that the fraternities had
conducted themselves so far this year
in regard to the rushing system.
An amendment to the present con
ference constitution was proposed
providing that no man could be initi
ated into a fraternity who was on
scholastic probation.
