# WILDMAN TO TELL OF EXPERIENCES IN GERMANY OF TODAY
## 
### 
Professor M. S. Wildman, head of
the Economics department, will tell
some of his continental experiences
this evening in the Assembly hall, at
7:30, in a talk on "Germany from a
Car Window." This is one phase of
the many interesting incidents of his
seven months' tour of western Europe
and the Mediterranean.
Visiting France, Germany, England,
Ireland, Scotland, and Switzerland,
and making a tour of the Mediter
ranean countries, Professor Wildman
returned home about September 1
with half a trunkful of picture post
cards representing various scenes of
his tour. It is his intention, he says,
to keep an album record of the trip.
The month of May was spent in Ger
many, visiting a number of friends in
Berlin and Munich, and making an
extensive tour of the country, with
short stops in the most important
cities. Professor Wildman will recount
incidents of the trip this evening.
Among the places of interest visited
by Professor Wildman were the tomb
of Tut-Ankh-Amen in Egypt, Cairo,
Jerusalem, and Constantinople. The
Madeira Islands, where he stopped on
the journey over, impressed him as un
usually charming.
