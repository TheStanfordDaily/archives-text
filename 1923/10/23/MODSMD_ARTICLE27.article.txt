# SIGNED ON THE DOTTED LINE
## 
### 
About a week ago the campus busybodies made a
frightful discovery. They found out that the Exe
cutive Committee had actually done something.
This was such startling news that they immedi
ately decided something was wrong. So they fol
lowed the customary procedure of busybodies and
circulated a petition
In framing such a document one might reason
ably expect that consideration would be given to the
facts: that the proposed bleachers in the pavilion
would not take away one-third of the floor space,
and it would limit only one dance, of benefit
to one class, while it would give the revenue of
1200 additional seats in at least four basketball
games to an athletic fund which is much needed â€”
as any one knows who has ever tried to have any
thing done in the Department of Physical Education.
' One might expect the consideration of one dance
vs. four athletic contests to hold some weight in
the minds of ordinary people; but that is a little too
much to expect from the excited minority.
The signers of the bleacher referendum remind
one of those persons who once signed a petition
reading as follows:
"We, the undersigned, declare it our purpose to
remove the nasal appendices of those below named,
as a spite to the faces of the following:
"(Signed) "
Meanwhile, the noisy minority yowls at the moon.
