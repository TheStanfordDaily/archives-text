A communication to the Daily Palo Alto yes
terday regretted that no more editorials appeared
advocating the restoration of gymnasium credit to
upperclassmen.
The Daily Palo Alto has not changed its front
on the question of credit for physical betterment,
but is convinced after an interview last spring that
there is no hope for the re-establishment of such a
system on the honor system or any other basis as
long as the present athletic administration retains
his control over the situation.
Went to a movie last night. Saw a girl throw
a pie at an elderly gentleman. A child in the front
laughed loudly. The manager of the show, in the
rear, smiled. "That's the kind of stuff th' stoodunts
like," he said.
A classified ad on the back page says "Automo
bile for sale; good tires; reasonable." The last word
gives a clear vision of much argument—not the
kind of argument some people can win with one
hand tied behind them.
