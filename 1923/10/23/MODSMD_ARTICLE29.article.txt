HOW TO WATCH A TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
It is probably going to be a good hot day, so take
your overcoat Of course, if you want to, you can take
your palm-leaf fan and your palm-beach suit and your
palm-tree cigarettes and be prepared for the good hot
day, and have it turn cold on you and give you pneu
monia Take your choice —it's all right with us The
big idea of this paragraph is just to get you to the
match, and we don't particularly care how you get there,
just so you pay your fare.
Once there, you can pick out a seat in the shady
bleachers, or in the sunny bleachers .If you come
attired in your overcoat, sit in the sunny bleachers just
as everyone else does who brings an overcoat, and if
you come in knee-lengths then sit in the shady bleachers.
We will now consider that the match has started.
You'll have to admit that we've given you pretty good
service. You generally have to wait a good deal more
than two paragraphs for a real championship match
to start.
Well, this department doesn't know a great deal about
tennis, except that one mustn't touch the net with the
racquet, and over the backstop isn't a good play to make
from the back-lines. Consequently we will pass hurriedly
over the next couple of hours and tell you how to get
home again.
You can do this in two ways. You can either ride
with a friend in the friend's car, or you can take the
train. Of course you will ride with the friend in the
friend's car, and stop a couple of moments at Aunt
Ella's to get the cake to take over to Hank's, and then
of course the roads aren't so good and we aren't in a
hurry anyway so if you're lucky you can get home in
time to greet the boys on the way to their eight o'clocks.
No wonder tennis is a major sport. —N. E.

"And the queer part about it:" Pa talked very blunt,
"Was that evils were seldom our notion,
"But the Blue Laws have made it a quite clever stunt,
"To stir up some wind of commotion."
"It's time someone learned they can't make us be

HOW TO WATCH A TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
It is probably going to be a good hot day, so take
your overcoat Of course, if you want to, you can take
your palm-leaf fan and your palm-beach suit and your
palm-tree cigarettes and be prepared for the good hot
day, and have it turn cold on you and give you pneu
monia Take your choice —it's all right with us The
big idea of this paragraph is just to get you to the
match, and we don't particularly care how you get there,
just so you pay your fare.
Once there, you can pick out a seat in the shady
bleachers, or in the sunny bleachers .If you come
attired in your overcoat, sit in the sunny bleachers just
as everyone else does who brings an overcoat, and if
you come in knee-lengths then sit in the shady bleachers.
We will now consider that the match has started.
You'll have to admit that we've given you pretty good
service. You generally have to wait a good deal more
than two paragraphs for a real championship match
to start.
Well, this department doesn't know a great deal about
tennis, except that one mustn't touch the net with the
racquet, and over the backstop isn't a good play to make
from the back-lines. Consequently we will pass hurriedly
over the next couple of hours and tell you how to get
home again.
You can do this in two ways. You can either ride
with a friend in the friend's car, or you can take the
train. Of course you will ride with the friend in the
friend's car, and stop a couple of moments at Aunt
Ella's to get the cake to take over to Hank's, and then
of course the roads aren't so good and we aren't in a
hurry anyway so if you're lucky you can get home in
time to greet the boys on the way to their eight o'clocks.
No wonder tennis is a major sport. —N. E.

HOW TO WATCH A TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP
It is probably going to be a good hot day, so take
your overcoat Of course, if you want to, you can take
your palm-leaf fan and your palm-beach suit and your
palm-tree cigarettes and be prepared for the good hot
day, and have it turn cold on you and give you pneu
monia Take your choice —it's all right with us The
big idea of this paragraph is just to get you to the
match, and we don't particularly care how you get there,
just so you pay your fare.
Once there, you can pick out a seat in the shady
bleachers, or in the sunny bleachers .If you come
attired in your overcoat, sit in the sunny bleachers just
as everyone else does who brings an overcoat, and if
you come in knee-lengths then sit in the shady bleachers.
We will now consider that the match has started.
You'll have to admit that we've given you pretty good
service. You generally have to wait a good deal more
than two paragraphs for a real championship match
to start.
Well, this department doesn't know a great deal about
tennis, except that one mustn't touch the net with the
racquet, and over the backstop isn't a good play to make
from the back-lines. Consequently we will pass hurriedly
over the next couple of hours and tell you how to get
home again.
You can do this in two ways. You can either ride
with a friend in the friend's car, or you can take the
train. Of course you will ride with the friend in the
friend's car, and stop a couple of moments at Aunt
Ella's to get the cake to take over to Hank's, and then
of course the roads aren't so good and we aren't in a
hurry anyway so if you're lucky you can get home in
time to greet the boys on the way to their eight o'clocks.
No wonder tennis is a major sport. —N. E.

"You are old, Stilliam," the young man declared.
" You are older than many have thought you,
"But how, in your youth, could you safely have fared,
"With temptations around to besot you?"
"In my youth, "Papa Stilliam replied with a wink,
"Men were thought to have powers of resistance,
"If one wanted to ramble, or dance, —even drink,
"He could do it with greatest persistence."
"And the queer part about it:" Pa talked very blunt,
"Was that evils were seldom our notion,
"But the Blue Laws have made it a quite clever stunt,
"To stir up some wind of commotion."
"It's time someone learned they can't make us be
have ..."
Said Pa Stilliam, a smile on his lip,
"Just by writing a statute . . . "Pa pulled down the
shade,
And his hand stole around to his hip. —H. M.
