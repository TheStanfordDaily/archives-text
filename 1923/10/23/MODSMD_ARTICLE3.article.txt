# Pageant and Plot Are Called For by W. A. A.
## 
### 
A name and a plot are needed for
the spring pageant. They will be cho
sen under the auspices of the Women's
Athletic Association.
The type of plot desired is one that
is not too elaborate but also one in
which most of the 500 women will
have parts. It may be based on an
historical incident or it may be purely
imaginative. The action should consist
of plenty of dancing and should read
ily lend itself to picturesque and tab
leau effects.
The name may be anything that
will represent the spirit of a pageant.
It has been suggested that appropri
ate names might be found in mytho
logy, old English festivals, or the an
nual fetes of the Romanic countries.
Women with suggestions for the
name of the pageant should send them,
together with their own names, to
Box 702, campus.
