' INCONGRUITY
Down in the murky green
ooze of fathomless â€¢
submarine depths live
unnumbered cannibals
preying among the
strange plants that
undulate in the liquid
gloom of the ocean
forests. Here nature
both helps the strong
and protects the weak
by ingenious disguises.
But the strong survive.
Who will say that in the
world of human beings
above, nature has not
been so unpartisan in
equipping and so biased
in her final results?
