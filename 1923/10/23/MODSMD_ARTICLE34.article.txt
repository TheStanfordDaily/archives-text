# Found: Only Student Enterprise on Campus
## 
### 
Since Jack Meyer's departure from the
campus, James Delkin, '20, has the honor
of running the sole remaining student
store.
"Jim" started his Encina Haberdashery
three years ago, in an old telephone booth
on the first floor of Encina Hall. Last
Christmas, his store was enlarged by
breaking through the wall in back of the
booth. Now, most anything of imme
diate need in men's wearing apparel can
be secured there.
