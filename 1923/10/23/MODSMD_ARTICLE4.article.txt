## 
### 
Five coaches outlined the athletic
possibilities of Stanford to the fresh
men last night at the third Y. M. C. A.
"On the Boat" assembly in Encina
last night.
Harry Maloney, "Dink" Templeton,
''Husky" Hunt, Harry Wolter, and
Ernie Brandsten talked to the lirst
year men on opportunities offered in
the respective sports.
"You need not be ashamed or' what
Stanford has done in the past," said
Maloney. "You need not be afraid of
the future. Stanford develops its own
material, and that takes time. Foot
ball has arrived. Track will arrive
next spring, and so will baseball. As
for soccer, we have won twenty-three
games out of twenty-eight with Cali
fornia."
"Dink" Templeton, the next speaker,
was not so encouraging. "Stanford has
never won a Frosh track meet with
California. You fellows have a won
derful chance to make a name for
yourselves this year."
