# Interesting Tests are Made on Famous Silkworm Collection
## 
### 
Hundreds of thousands of silkworm l
eggs, and over 200 brooks of 100 insects
each, form the famous silkworm collec
tion of Dr. Isabel McCracken of the j
Entomology department. The original j
stock came from the Imperial Sericul
ture station of Japan several years ago,
and many interesting experiments liave
been made with these as a starting point.
"There are four kinds of silkworms,"
said Miss McCracken, "the normal, that
is, those with patterns; the noncolored;
the branded or zebra; and the dark. In
1921, a fifth type appeared in the labora
tory, a golden yellow. It may have been
a throwback to some distant ancestor.
We have made many broods from this
specimen. Occasionally a silk worm with
a mixed parentage of dark and white or
dark and zebra will have a dividing line
down the middle, one side resembling one
parent, one the other."
Acclimatization Experiment
Last year, according to Dr. McCracken,
an interesting experiment was made to
test the acclimatization of the silk worm.
The object of the experiment was to find
how an insect bred indoors for 1,000 years
could take care of itself outside.
"The silkworms have always been bred
inside," explained Miss McCracken. "The
original outdoor ancestor of the silkworm
is not known. We isolated the worms
on mulberry trees, protected by tents of
cheesecloth against birds and wasps,
which are their natural enemies. But we
did not count on field mice, snakes, and

ants, so very few came through the ex
periment. However, those tliat did, made
good cocoons, from which we concluded
that outdoor breeding did not affect the
quality of their spinning."
Mating Test
Last summer, an experiment was made
in mating. This usually occurs in July
and August, but means have been found
to hasten or delay the process. The
newly laid eggs can be kept on ice for
two months without losing their vitality.
"The idea of premature hatching was
known, but it was Dr. Kellogg who sug
gested the use of hydrochloric acid," says
Miss McCracken. "The eggs are dipped
in this, and immediately rinsed in water.
This results in their hatching in a few
days, although it is an uncertain method,
many eggs not hatching at all."
A machine for testing the breaking
strength of silk was invented by Burton
Stuart .technician of the Physics depart
ment. The apparatus consists of a grad
uated rod carrying a weight, and sus
pended by a small piece of silk. As the
weight is moved out the rod, the point
at which it becomes heavy enough to
! break the silk is used to determine the
j strength of the silk.
"Next year," said Miss McCracken,
"the hereditary value of color variation
will be tested. Of course any student of
genetics knows that color is dominant
over non-color in heredity, but the rela
tions of colors within themselves is not
known."

A machine for testing the breaking
strength of silk was invented by Burton
Stuart .technician of the Physics depart
ment. The apparatus consists of a grad
uated rod carrying a weight, and sus
pended by a small piece of silk. As the
weight is moved out the rod, the point
at which it becomes heavy enough to
! break the silk is used to determine the
j strength of the silk.
"Next year," said Miss McCracken,
"the hereditary value of color variation
will be tested. Of course any student of
genetics knows that color is dominant
over non-color in heredity, but the rela
tions of colors within themselves is not
known."
Hundreds of thousands of silkworm l
eggs, and over 200 brooks of 100 insects
each, form the famous silkworm collec
tion of Dr. Isabel McCracken of the j
Entomology department. The original j
stock came from the Imperial Sericul
ture station of Japan several years ago,
and many interesting experiments liave
been made with these as a starting point.
"There are four kinds of silkworms,"
said Miss McCracken, "the normal, that
is, those with patterns; the noncolored;
the branded or zebra; and the dark. In
1921, a fifth type appeared in the labora
tory, a golden yellow. It may have been
a throwback to some distant ancestor.
We have made many broods from this
specimen. Occasionally a silk worm with
a mixed parentage of dark and white or
dark and zebra will have a dividing line
down the middle, one side resembling one
parent, one the other."
Acclimatization Experiment
Last year, according to Dr. McCracken,
an interesting experiment was made to
test the acclimatization of the silk worm.
The object of the experiment was to find
how an insect bred indoors for 1,000 years
could take care of itself outside.
"The silkworms have always been bred
inside," explained Miss McCracken. "The
original outdoor ancestor of the silkworm
is not known. We isolated the worms
on mulberry trees, protected by tents of
cheesecloth against birds and wasps,
which are their natural enemies. But we
did not count on field mice, snakes, and

ants, so very few came through the ex
periment. However, those tliat did, made
good cocoons, from which we concluded
that outdoor breeding did not affect the
quality of their spinning."
Mating Test
Last summer, an experiment was made
in mating. This usually occurs in July
and August, but means have been found
to hasten or delay the process. The
newly laid eggs can be kept on ice for
two months without losing their vitality.
"The idea of premature hatching was
known, but it was Dr. Kellogg who sug
gested the use of hydrochloric acid," says
Miss McCracken. "The eggs are dipped
in this, and immediately rinsed in water.
This results in their hatching in a few
days, although it is an uncertain method,
many eggs not hatching at all."
