# Who's Got the Garter? New Fad Invades Quad
## At University of Wisconsin 
### 
A new fad is invading the campus.
It has many followers who swear that
it simplifies the dress, saves time, and
is a great deal "doggier" than the
previous fashion.
The great secret came to light not.
long ago when several men of the
campus got together and compared
notes. It seems that they had been
trying to buy this article-of-apparel at
several stores around town. They
were informed that due to the poor
demand for it, the article had been
discontinued.
After much discussion, pro and con,
the said persons decided to follow the
fad. Now they are walking around the
campus just like all the rest of the
men, without garters.
