### 
The Stanford Band will make its
first appearance Saturday at the U. S.
C. game. The new uniforms are not
to be worn until the Big Game.
Fifty men are signed up, and there
are still a few openings. Forty-nine
uniforms have been ordered through
Roos Bros, in Palo Alto, from an East
ern company. This permits a march
ing hand of six abreast and eight deep,
with one leader.
This year's aggregation will be the
best in eight years, believes Professor
E. S. Martin, director.
