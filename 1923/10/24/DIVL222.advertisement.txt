Overcoats
of distinction!
Advertising egotism aside, we believe vou'll
agree with us that we have an unusual distinc
tive overcoat showing for fall. *
If you are at all skeptical of this claim, it is the
easiest matter on earth to check us up. Simply
drop in and see the coats.
Even in the more conservative patterns you'll
find an air of smartness that shows expert se
lection.
j \ { '
Whatever your price or style ideas, it's a safe
wager that you'll find a number of coats that
you'll like.
Scotch and Irish hand-loomed homespuns, Shet
lands, tweeds, cheviots, camel's hair, Meltons,
and many novelty plaid back overcoatings.
Belted, half belt and beltless styles. Single and
double breasters.

A great variety at
$45 to $60
