# YEARLINGS LEAVE TOMORROW FOR TROJAN CONTEST
## Colored Fullback of U. S. C. Eleven Likely to Cause Trouble for Babes 
### Walter Campbell 
Coach "Husky" Hunt and his squad
of fresbman footballers will board the
Southern Pacific tomorrow night for
a little week-end jaunt witbTthe U. S.
C. peagreeners. Down at Los Angeles
the Trojan babes will be waiting with
wide-open arms, eagerly anticipating
Saturday's contest in the Los Angeles
Coliseum. Although optimists believe
to the contrary, the game will not be
an easy one.
The big ground-gainer on the U. S.
C. eleven is a colored boy named
Brice Taylor, who functions at full
back. Up in Seattle, Washington, Tay
lor was the big noise in high school
circles. Since his advent at U. S. C.
he has more than justified the press
reports of his home town. Taylor is
a natural line bucker, and gathers so
much momentum that he is hard to
stop.
Aiding Taylor in the backfield will
be Laranetta and Lee, products of Los
Angeles high schools. Laranetta is
slippery, and Lee is a ten flat man
in the hundred.
However. Coach Hunt has several
promising young men who should
cover just as much ground as the
southerners. Let Hyland get away in
an open field, and there will be no
stopping him short of the goal line.
Garthwaite, Phillips, and Trombetta
are just as fast.
If the Card babes win Saturday, it
will be because of the line work. The
backfield can hold its own against
the best U. S. C. can offer, but will
be rendered helpless if the line does
not hold. However, Coach Post has a
well-trained group of linemen, as is
shown by the fact that not a single
first down was made through the line
in the entire San Jose Teachers Col
lege game or in the last half of the
Davis Farm game.
