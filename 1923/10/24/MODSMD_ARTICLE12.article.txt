# Less Than One-Third of Dancing Space to Be Used By Bleachers, Says Davis
## 
### 
Exact figures on the area covered by
the proposed bleachers in the basketball
j pavilion were given out by Graduate
Manager Davis this morning.
"At present the floor space, not includ
ing that under the balconies, is 13,344
; square feet; the space taken by the or
j chestra amounts to 1000 feet.
• "The new bleachers will take away
I 4.116 feet around the side; remaining will
be an area of 9,108 square feet.
"Allowing for the customary 500 coup
les, which is the number of tickets or
{ dinarily sold for the largest dances, the
' amount of floor space for dancing under
; the new plan would be eighteen feet per
I couple.
"That is the entire effect on dancing—
a loss of 24 3-10 per cent of the space,
cutting down the dancers at the cotillion
j and prom to eighteen feet a couple."
Beneficial effects of the new arrange
ment will not only affect basketball, said
Davis, but will help alumni dinners, ral
lies, and aid in serving of refreshments
i at big dances. He spoke first of the help
to basketball, as being the most im
portant.
"The new plan would give very much
better facilities for handling the crowd."
said Davis. Last year at the basketball
games we had more complaints by peo
j pie attending the games than- at any other
| athletic contest during the year.
"Some say that this is not of vital ef
fect to Stanford, but I entirely disagree.
You can recall the Big Game two years
ago when our football team lost by a bin
score. Still, the geiural comments on the
game were, considering the conditions,
| very favorable. Several of the city writ
' ers wrote at great length about the cam

pus, how the crowds were handled and
how the people were treated.
'Therefore, to say that this is not of
importance to Stanford shows that the
person is not informed on the subject.
The new plan would allow for reserved
seats. Last year at the basketball game
the entire pavilion was sold out within
forty minutes after the tickets were
placed on sale.
"The demand for tickets for basketball
games has been steadily increasing every
year, and there is every reason to be
lieve this increase will continue. If we
have reserved seats it will relieve a great
deal of difficulty, assure a person a scat
and eliminate any necessity of his having
to come an hour or two early, bringing
his lunch with him, as happened last year,
in order to procure a seat in a good loca
tion.
"Two cross courts with the new plan
would be available if desired. The new
plan would be much better for the players
because they would have space of 9 feet
5 inches on the side lines in place of
approximately three feet as is allowed
under the present arrangement. Tt would
be much better for practice because the
players would have more room."
At the present time the new plan would
not in any way affect the alumni dinner,
said Davis. In the future, if the at
tendance increased, the same arrange
ment as suggested for the large dances
Could be carried out; that is, serving din
ner in the balconies, using one row of
seats for the diners, one row for tables,
and the third row for waiters.
For a small dance the new plan would
be 1 letter because it would tend to re
