# RAM'S HEAD PLOTS AND SONGS MUST BE IN BY DECEMBER 15
## 
### 
Ram's Head show plots and songs
must be in by December 15, says
Lewis Alabaster, president of Ram's
Head. The best of these will then be
selected so that work can commence
immediately after the beginning of
the winter quarter.
Plots must contain a general sce
nario of the action together with the
cast of characters and possible song
titles. At least one act must be writ
ten with completed dialogue. Songs
are not asked for at present but all
campus composers and lyric writers
should turn in their names to Alabas
ter, and song plots will be given out
after the play has been chosen.
The plot itself must be a comedy
burlesque suitable for male actors and
affording an opportunity for a great
deal of chorus work. Plots can be sent
to David Mannoccir until December 15.
