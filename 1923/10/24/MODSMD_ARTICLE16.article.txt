# CARDS HOLD SECRET PRACTICE FOR GAME WITH U. S. C. ELEVEN
## Andy Kerr Runs Varsity Through Trick Plays; Places Stress on Elimination of Fumbles 
### David Meiklejohn 
Secret practice preparatory to the U. S. C. game Saturday surrounded ihe
varsity field with mystery yesterday afternoon. Andy Kerr busied himself
by running the team through a series of trick plays which the public or
U. S. C. will know nothing of until the game begins at 2:30.
Although excluded followers could only glimpse the punts of Nevers, Cudde
back, and Cleaveland from outside the fence, one could imagine the gist of
Little Andy's afternoon talk: "Fumbles, fumbles "
There is no doubt but that the Card mentor is going to do his best to
eradicate this word from the squad's vocabulary, for a fumble against U. S. C.
may mean nothing and again it might mean everything.
Individually, the Stanford men look good. No team could hope for a
faster pair of ends than Lawson and Thomas, who follow the ball on kick-offs
and passes like the proverbial bloodhound. Dole is another dependable end.

It was Dole who recovered the ball
after Cravens had blocked Riderhoff's
kick, and with perfect interference
scored a touchdown.
Nevers' punting is far above par,
and Cleaveland is also a dependable
kicker. Cuddeback has not lost his
ability to place and drop kick. He
tried a 40-yard placement kick against
the Oxy eleven that just barely missed
the cross bars, and which would have
gone over had it had more height.
Evidently Andy Kerr's method of cur
ing fumbling, as advised by some
writers, is not to make the fumbler
carry a football around to class with
him. At any rate, no one has appeared
on the campus lugging a football, to
date .
Cleaveland is a heady backfield man.
If one analyzes Norm's style of open
running he will find the Card half
picks his hole in the line when an end
run is doomed to failure. Cleaveland
did this in the Oxy game. He scored
on a play that started out like an end
run, and seeing no opening he dashed
through tackle for a long gain and a
touchdown.
