# FIRST INTERCLASS GRIDIRON STRUGGLE SET FOR THURSDAY
## 
### 
The interclass football season will open
I Thursday afternoon at 4:15 when the
i junior team will meet the freshmen grid
ironers in the first game of the schedule.
Saturday contests scheduled for the
: freshmen made it necessary to change the
: opening date to Thursday.
The upset in the schedule came yester
day when it was learned that the third
i string freshmen will not go south for
the game with the U. S. C. babes, but
will play Oakland high Saturday. The
freshmen-junior contest was set for Sat
urday, but because of the conflict, C. W.
Davis, director of intramural athletics,
was forced to make the change.
j For two weeks the juniors have been
practicing on the interclass field. Twenty
j men have* been out working under the
j direction of Coach Virgil Cheek and more
than half of last year's team is back in
the lineup for the coming season. Last
1 year the class of '25 was runner-up in
i the interclass football series. The 1925
i team will average 170 pounds.
The freshmen eleven, which is made
: up of members of the third string of the
| freshmen varsity, has had considerable
1 experience during the present season and
J their showing in games during the last
; few weeks assures the juniors of strong
I opposition.
