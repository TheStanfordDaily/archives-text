Yesterday the Daily Palo Alto printed an in
terview with the captain of the basketball team.
The Daily was unable to find any one who would
admit being the leader of the sophomore cotillion
to take the rebuttal, but was fortunate in finding
one man rambling around the campus in flat hat
and kerchief coyly peeping out of the pocket of
his newly-pressed coat. The following dialogue
took place:
Q. What do you think about putting perma
nent seats in the basketball pavilion?
A. I'm agin it.
O. Why?
A. Oh, I don't know. It's a kind of a radical
change, isn't it? The pavilion is all right the
way it ik. I like it.
Q. You mean you are shying from it because
It is. a change, and you don't know how it will
come out?
A. Oh, dear me, no. I think it will spoil the
looks of the building to have all those seats in
there.
Q. Don't you think it will benefit the team?
A. Well, maybe it will. But I should think the
architects could think up some temporary
bleacher plan, so that we could dance under the
balconies when we wanted to.
Q. You think, then, that you could, without
any experience, go in and devise a better plan
than that of the architects to handle the crowds
and get additional seating capacity?
A. Aw, now, that isn't fair. I'm not an archi
tect. I just don't like what the architects have
done.
Q. You think we should try and worry along
with the temporary seats and let the crowds
whistle?
A. Well, we always have gotten by all right.
Why should we always be doing something new?
Q. How did you ever consent to wear long
trousers?
