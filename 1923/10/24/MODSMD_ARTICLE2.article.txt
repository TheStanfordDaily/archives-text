# HUGHES WILL TALK TO JOURNALISTS ON WRITING OF SPORTS
## 
### 
Ed R. Hughes, sports writer of the
San Francisco Chronicle, will be the
speaker at the first meeting of the Stan
ford Journalists' association at 7:30
o'clock tomorrow evening in the Alpha
Tan Omega house. Hughes has been a
sports writer and editor for more than
twenty years, and before that was a
general news reporter. For ten years he
was sporting editor of the Seattle Times.
His main topic will concern the re
quirements and experiences of a writer
on athletics. His own special fields are
football and baseball.
Hughes intends to come to the campus
early in the afternoon in order to watch
the Stanford football team in practice,
and Football Coach Kerr and Captain
Campbell have invited him to have dinner
with the sfjuad at the training table that
evening.
As usual, the journalists' association
invites all who are interested in the sub
ject to come to the meeting.
