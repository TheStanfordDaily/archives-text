# FALSE PROPHETS
## 
### 
Sati Francisco sport writers are almost unani
mous in the opinion that Stanford should win
from the University of Southern California Sat
urday by twenty-one points. Far be it from the
Daily Palo Alto to pack a wet blanket, but—The
Cardinal rooter who has such an idea in mind
would do well to either stay away from the game
or go prepared for a disappointment.
Granted that the Cardinal eleven, the strongest
on the Farm in years, has a good chance to win.
By how big a margin, no one can say. "Tiny"
Thornhill came back from the Washington-U. S.
C. game last Saturday with a stock of valuable
information and a great deal of respect for Gus
Henderson's team. He describes the southerners
as having a very strong defense. The fact that
Washinton won by a comfortable margin was
due to the fact that the northerners had a very
strong team —not that U. S. C. was particularly
weak.
One of the San Francisco scribes went so far
as to say that anything less than a twenty-one
point win for Stanford would be unsatisfactory.
All of which is pure and unadulterated bunk.
In the first place, a victory over U. S. C.is all
that is necessary or desirable. Stanford is not
pointing toward the game Saturday and it is
improbable that Andy Kerr will try to run up a
large score if it is possible. Inasmuch as the
University of Southern California is a conference
team it is an obstacle between the Cards and the
Pacific Coast Conference title, but Stanford is
pointing toward one game, which will take plaCe
in the new stadium at Berkeley November 24.
Over-confidence, of the type set forth by the
San Francisco newspapers, seems to be one
thing which may keep the Cardinal eleven from
going through the season undefeated. So far, it
has not shown itself among the players, and it
is to be hoped that it will be kept out of the
rooting section.
Let the Golden Bear and his cohorts do the
talking now, and Stanford supporters can drag
out the tin horns on the night of November 24.
