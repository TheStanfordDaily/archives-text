# CABBAGES and THINGS

Well, tomorrow comes the Big Election, where the
fate of the vice-presidency of the student body, the
basketball pavilion, and the point (not honor) system
hangs in the balance. So many outside requests have
come in begging for the straight dope, all the straight
dope, that Cabbages here presents a summary as to
how the student should vote (if so) at the big election:
The Basketball Question
Our stand on this has already been clearly defined.
Either this is a representative student body, or it is
not. In either case, those who really want to see per
manent bleachers installed will vote for temporary ones
because of fear of being branded athletic maniacs and
supporters of the Board of Athletic Control; and those
who in their hearts desire no permanent bleachers will
vote for them out of caution, to avoid being hooted
down as snakes and university demoralizers.
Our stand, as we have already said, has been already
clearly defined. Try and find it.
The Point System for Student Activities
Right here, let it be known that Cabbages is all for
this. The Point System will provide enough material
for this column to last at least 4 months (Pacific time).
Just take the case of Wilfred Hangnail, for example,
who is full of fire and wants to help the old alma mater
and all that. Wilbur, at the end of three years of prying
around, has amassed the following mass of points:
Class Treasurer 4.7 points
Cotillion Committee 003 points
Lotto Team, 2 seasons 9.00 points
Roughs' Day Committee, 1923 11.0 points
Class President - 1.819 points
Membership in 3 societies 3.1416 points
That brings Wilbur's total up to 28.6796 points, and
the total allowed is 30.
Then the big catastrophe comes. Wilbur is elected to
the Board of Athletic Control. As that counts 2 points
(for student members; for faculty members, 1.001
points), he is immediately disqualified, and is notified
that his presence in the University is no longer re
quired because of his grasping ambition.
Wilbur, however, sticks around anyway, since the
Committee on Credentials can't find his point chart
because it has been cross-indexed and thereby lost, in
the new and expensive filing system which is an abso
lute necessity. He finally, as an act of arrogant bravado,
accepts the chairmanship of the Senior flower committee,
thus bringing his record to the outrageous mark of
47.89 points, and escapes with impunity, as by this time
the filing system has become well systematized.
Patients visiting the Palo Alto Hospital have been
too noisy, reports the authorities. What can they expect
when the varsity rolls up 97 points in the last two
games?
Change of study list can be made by pink cards only
today. (So if you haven't done it now, you're out of
luck—liar, liar!) That's what the color system is coming
to in this University.
Surely we're not going to let a wonderful scheme
like that be recalled. It will give Stanford a unique
place among American universities.

who in their hearts desire no permanent bleachers will
vote for them out of caution, to avoid being hooted
down as snakes and university demoralizers.
Our stand, as we have already said, has been already
clearly defined. Try and find it.
The Point System for Student Activities
Right here, let it be known that Cabbages is all for
this. The Point System will provide enough material
for this column to last at least 4 months (Pacific time).
Just take the case of Wilfred Hangnail, for example,
who is full of fire and wants to help the old alma mater
and all that. Wilbur, at the end of three years of prying
around, has amassed the following mass of points:
Class Treasurer 4.7 points
Cotillion Committee 003 points
Lotto Team, 2 seasons 9.00 points
Roughs' Day Committee, 1923 11.0 points
Class President - 1.819 points
Membership in 3 societies 3.1416 points
That brings Wilbur's total up to 28.6796 points, and
the total allowed is 30.
Then the big catastrophe comes. Wilbur is elected to
the Board of Athletic Control. As that counts 2 points
(for student members; for faculty members, 1.001
points), he is immediately disqualified, and is notified
that his presence in the University is no longer re
quired because of his grasping ambition.
Wilbur, however, sticks around anyway, since the
Committee on Credentials can't find his point chart
because it has been cross-indexed and thereby lost, in
the new and expensive filing system which is an abso
lute necessity. He finally, as an act of arrogant bravado,
accepts the chairmanship of the Senior flower committee,
thus bringing his record to the outrageous mark of
47.89 points, and escapes with impunity, as by this time
the filing system has become well systematized.
Patients visiting the Palo Alto Hospital have been
too noisy, reports the authorities. What can they expect
when the varsity rolls up 97 points in the last two
games?
Change of study list can be made by pink cards only
today. (So if you haven't done it now, you're out of
luck—liar, liar!) That's what the color system is coming
to in this University.
Surely we're not going to let a wonderful scheme
like that be recalled. It will give Stanford a unique
place among American universities.

Well, tomorrow comes the Big Election, where the
fate of the vice-presidency of the student body, the
basketball pavilion, and the point (not honor) system
hangs in the balance. So many outside requests have
come in begging for the straight dope, all the straight
dope, that Cabbages here presents a summary as to
how the student should vote (if so) at the big election:
The Basketball Question
Our stand on this has already been clearly defined.
Either this is a representative student body, or it is
not. In either case, those who really want to see per
manent bleachers installed will vote for temporary ones
because of fear of being branded athletic maniacs and
supporters of the Board of Athletic Control; and those
who in their hearts desire no permanent bleachers will
vote for them out of caution, to avoid being hooted
down as snakes and university demoralizers.
