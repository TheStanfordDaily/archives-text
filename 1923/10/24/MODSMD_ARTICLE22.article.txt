To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Your comment last night on the proposal for bleachers
in the basketball pavilion represents the first sound
sense expounded on the matter since the Executive Com
mittee recommended the measure to the A. S. S. U. To
the considerations expressed by yourself and those of
McHose stated in the front page story I should like to
add:
I will leave the University in December, to live in
San Francisco, after which time I want to be able to
see the basketball games, and I do not want to make
the trip to Palo Alto for the purpose, only to find the
pavilion crowded with no chance of getting in, as was
the case with a number of prominent San Francisco
alumni last season, among them some of the best sup
porters of Stanford athletics in the world. George Pres
ley, for example, came to the campus several times to
be denied admittance to the games, because they were
crowded. Alumni interest in athletics is more vital to
our success than almost anything else, and if we can
make accommodations half way decent for graduate
visitors, we should do so. And from my own personal
standpoint, I want to be able to get in.
In the second place, the value of the proposed bleach
ers has been very much underestimated. FOUR basket
ball games were crowded LAST year, but why consider
this figure? If I know anything about athletics the
basketball team will be as much better this season as
the football team is now, and not only four games, but
EVERY conference game will be crowded. We will need
those 1200 extra seats for more than half the games.
Stanford teams are on the up-grade this season, and all
the old grads as well as the general public want to see
them play.
The proposition up for vote tomorrow is not four
games, but eight or ten. Will we turn away 1200 people
at ten basketball games so that a few ball-room athletes
may be more comfortable at two campus dances?
Dances about this campus seem to have flourished dur
ing the past four years despite numerous handicaps,
while athletics have not. If we have to pinch one or the
other slightly, why pinch athletics? You can't discourage
the campus snake. He will flourish in all his glory any
way. But if we are going to send track and swimming
teams East we have to have the money to do it with.
Twelve hundred extra admissions on several occasions
mean a great deal.
Every proposition in the Board of Athletic Control
meets the same answer. Where in H can we get
the money for it? Our budget for 1923 is already spent
on paper—there is no reserve. If the Board is willing to
spend money to put in bleachers, it is only because it
will bring in much more money for athletics. Let them
get the money. Stanford teams are going to be good
this season, and we want to send them against the best
in the country.
If the sophomores are worrying about their cotillion
this year, the belachers will not be put in before their
dance anyway. And when they are put in there will
still be adequate accommodation for 500 couples. There
are only 500 women on the campus, and each could
attend with a partner and not crowd the changed
pavilion. Are we going to send 1200 interested people
away from a number of important games in order to
allow a hundred imports in addition to the 500 attend
two formal dances? Not more than 400 of the 500 attend
anyway, and the 100 imports can come if necessary,
with enough room still. I'm doing my best, but can't
find a good reason for not making the change anywhere.
Let's use a little common horse sense in voting on
the bleacher proposition tomorrow. We're voting for the
thing we value most around this place. Which is it?

ley, for example, came to the campus several times to
be denied admittance to the games, because they were
crowded. Alumni interest in athletics is more vital to
our success than almost anything else, and if we can
make accommodations half way decent for graduate
visitors, we should do so. And from my own personal
standpoint, I want to be able to get in.
In the second place, the value of the proposed bleach
ers has been very much underestimated. FOUR basket
ball games were crowded LAST year, but why consider
this figure? If I know anything about athletics the
basketball team will be as much better this season as
the football team is now, and not only four games, but
EVERY conference game will be crowded. We will need
those 1200 extra seats for more than half the games.
Stanford teams are on the up-grade this season, and all
the old grads as well as the general public want to see
them play.
The proposition up for vote tomorrow is not four
games, but eight or ten. Will we turn away 1200 people
at ten basketball games so that a few ball-room athletes
may be more comfortable at two campus dances?
Dances about this campus seem to have flourished dur
ing the past four years despite numerous handicaps,
while athletics have not. If we have to pinch one or the
other slightly, why pinch athletics? You can't discourage
the campus snake. He will flourish in all his glory any
way. But if we are going to send track and swimming
teams East we have to have the money to do it with.
Twelve hundred extra admissions on several occasions
mean a great deal.
Every proposition in the Board of Athletic Control
meets the same answer. Where in H can we get
the money for it? Our budget for 1923 is already spent
on paper—there is no reserve. If the Board is willing to
spend money to put in bleachers, it is only because it
will bring in much more money for athletics. Let them
get the money. Stanford teams are going to be good
this season, and we want to send them against the best
in the country.
If the sophomores are worrying about their cotillion
this year, the belachers will not be put in before their
dance anyway. And when they are put in there will
still be adequate accommodation for 500 couples. There
are only 500 women on the campus, and each could
attend with a partner and not crowd the changed
pavilion. Are we going to send 1200 interested people
away from a number of important games in order to
allow a hundred imports in addition to the 500 attend
two formal dances? Not more than 400 of the 500 attend
anyway, and the 100 imports can come if necessary,
with enough room still. I'm doing my best, but can't
find a good reason for not making the change anywhere.
Let's use a little common horse sense in voting on
the bleacher proposition tomorrow. We're voting for the
thing we value most around this place. Which is it?

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Your comment last night on the proposal for bleachers
in the basketball pavilion represents the first sound
sense expounded on the matter since the Executive Com
mittee recommended the measure to the A. S. S. U. To
the considerations expressed by yourself and those of
McHose stated in the front page story I should like to
add:
I will leave the University in December, to live in
San Francisco, after which time I want to be able to
see the basketball games, and I do not want to make
the trip to Palo Alto for the purpose, only to find the
pavilion crowded with no chance of getting in, as was
the case with a number of prominent San Francisco
alumni last season, among them some of the best sup
porters of Stanford athletics in the world. George Pres
