# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Daily is printing the communica
tion below not because it has any Iterary
or forensic value, but because it is the
policy of the paper to publish all print
able communications property signed.'
Aside front the flag-waving references
to "Stanford democracy" the zvriter says
nothing beyond the fact that he, or she,
is not an athlete and can't see why the
athletes should have any help given them
because they represent Stanford. Some
one who can debate calmly on the sub
ject can answer that. If the Editor tried
it he zvould probably explode and pi
the type.
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Your editorial of yesterday entitled,
"Signed on the Dotted Line," is greatly
to be regretted. I do not know when I
have seen a statement more contro
versial to the spirit of Stanford demo
cracy. You intimate that the pavilion
should be devoted primarily to ath
letes, without the usual regard for
those who take no part in athletic
contests. It is very evident that ath
letic contests hold more weight in
your mind than the social benefits
which will come through the use of
the entire pavilion as a dance floor.
Dances give pleasure to many Stan
ford students. Basketball games
benefit only those few who have the
physical ability to represent the col-

lege. The pavilion is being paid for by
the entire student body. I believe that
dancing, in which the whole of Stan
ford takes part should have as much
consideration as basketball. Benefit of
the many was ever the noblest aim
of democracy. â€”A. B. R.
