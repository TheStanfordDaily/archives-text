"HOLLYWOOD," Varsity theater, Palo
Alto.
The man who \vrote s the plot, if there
is one to this moving picture, was killed
in a fatal accident just before the screen
ing began and so they took it without a
plot. Somehow or other, by lavish cut
ting, and the help of many feet of sub
titles, a general idea is conveyed that
somebody went to Hollywood (why God
knows, but most likely to go into the
movies) and from then on all is a succes
sion of shots of some of the leading
stars in the cinematic heavens. They

wander in without purpose (quite true to
life) and wander off after we have been
permitted to glimpse them shortly, to be
seen no more.
For which, after due consideration, we
were duly thankful.
