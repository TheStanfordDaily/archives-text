# SEVEN COLUMNS FOR DAILY IS CONSIDERED BY EXECUTIVE BODY
## Haley Says Further Student Support Is Requisite For Enlargement 
### 
Enlargement of the Daily Palo Alto
to seven columns was discussed at the
Executive Committee meeting last
night. Action was deferred until next
week, in order that members of the
committee can find out how student
opinion stands on the matter.
Cecil Haley, business manager of
the Daily, argued that the increase of
$11 a day in expense can partly be
covered by increased advertising.
However, in winter quarter, ads are
more scarce, and Haley feels that the
venture will not be safe unless either
the student body is taxed a small
amount per capita or money is drawn
from the student organizations fund.
The addition of an extra column would
make the Daily very nearly the size of
a regular city sheet
M. S. C. That copies of the A. S. S.
U. handbook be sent to the student
body presidents of Pacific Coast col
leges and universities.
M. S. C. That the action of the com
mittee in granting a German "S" to
second squad football men be suspend
ed for further consideration.
