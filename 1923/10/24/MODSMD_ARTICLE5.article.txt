# GERMAN POLO IN RUHR IS DECLARED CAUSE OF COLLAPSE

It is not French occupation but the
policy of passive resistance that has
ruined Germany in the Ruhr. This is
the conclusion of Professor M. T.
Wildman, who lectured on the situa
tion in Germany last evening.
As a basis for this statement, he
cited the fact that tons of paper
money had been sent to the Ruhr to
support idle people who did not need
to be kept unemployed. "The fall of
the mark affected each class of people
differently," said Wildman.
"Peasants sold their products out
side of Germany and were paid in gold.
Formerly most farms were operated
under an easy loan system, which
made it possible for the farmers to
borrow money at a very low rate of
interest."
Six months ago when the lecturer
was in Germany, a peasant could wipe
out his entire mortgage by selling
three pounds of butter at the nearest
town.
Industrial workers, too, have pros
pered. The idea of a right to a job
and a living wage has been incorporat
ed into law. Every fortnight the wages
are adjusted to keep the purchasing
power the same. The government is
undertaking large public works to em
ploy all surplus labor. "
The position of employers is much
the same as that of the peasants, in
his estimation, because of the low cost
at which it is possible to cancel bonds.
It is the owners of real estate and the
salaried class whose position is most
distressing. The best salaries paid now
are from $6 to $10 a month. Those
who receive fixed incomes from in
vested capital, called "rentiers," are
among the classes who suffer by the
depreciation of money value.
"This is true," Professor Wildman
explained, "in cases like that of the
