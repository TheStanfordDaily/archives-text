# GERMAN POLO IN RUHR IS DECLARED CAUSE OF COLLAPSE
## 
### 
It is not French occupation but the
policy of passive resistance that has
ruined Germany in the Ruhr. This is
the conclusion of Professor M. T.
Wildman, who lectured on the situa
tion in Germany last evening.
As a basis for this statement, he
cited the fact that tons of paper
money had been sent to the Ruhr to
support idle people who did not need
to be kept unemployed. "The fall of
the mark affected each class of people
differently," said Wildman.
"Peasants sold their products out
side of Germany and were paid in gold.
Formerly most farms were operated
under an easy loan system, which
made it possible for the farmers to
borrow money at a very low rate of
interest."
Six months ago when the lecturer
was in Germany, a peasant could wipe
out his entire mortgage by selling
three pounds of butter at the nearest
town.
Industrial workers, too, have pros
pered. The idea of a right to a job
and a living wage has been incorporat
ed into law. Every fortnight the wages
are adjusted to keep the purchasing
power the same. The government is
undertaking large public works to em
ploy all surplus labor. "
The position of employers is much
the same as that of the peasants, in
his estimation, because of the low cost
at which it is possible to cancel bonds.
It is the owners of real estate and the
salaried class whose position is most
distressing. The best salaries paid now
are from $6 to $10 a month. Those
who receive fixed incomes from in
vested capital, called "rentiers," are
among the classes who suffer by the
depreciation of money value.
"This is true," Professor Wildman
explained, "in cases like that of the
woman who, at the end of the war, |
was reputed the richest woman in
Germany. When I was there in May, 1
her income was worth $1.50 a month.
Today it is not worth 1% cents. The j
intellectuals, too, have had a hard
time. People who used to travel first |
class are staying home, and their chil-!
dren, who have succeeded them in
their professions, are working in fac-1
tories.

"I am not sure that the destruction
of Germany's upper classes is her ;
greatest loss. I think the destruction
of her moral standard is greater. This
started with the government when it
repudiated its engagement at Ver
sailles, and continued with the can- j
cellation of debts with worthless paper
by cities, the government, and indi
viduals."
Professor Wildman doubted whether '
the new class can take the place of ,
the old, and preserve the culture as it [
was in the past.
