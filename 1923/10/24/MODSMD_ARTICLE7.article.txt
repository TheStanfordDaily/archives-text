# BLEACHER STUNT TO BE REHEARSED AT RALLY TONIGHT
## Tryoutees for Yell Leader to Perform; Dancing Is to Be Part of Program 
### David Lamson 
Two opportunities will beat in the
proverbial style upon the doors of
Stanford men and women tonight at 7
o'clock.
One opportunity is to learn to wear
a rooter's hat in the fashion approved
by our best universities.
The other is to dance for almost an
hour to the music of Grinstead's or
chestra.
The placets the basketball pavilion;
the occasion, the rally preceding the
U. S. C. game next Saturday; the
whole affair is the arrangement of the
Rally Committee, which completed
final details of the joy-fest at a meet
ing last night.
Since the rally can last only an
hour, students are urged to be at the
pavilion promptly at 7 o'clock. Danc
ing will take place between numbers
of the rally program.
Plans for the bleacher stunts to be
used on Saturday will be explained by
Burt Lapp at this time, particularly
those relating to the use of rooters'
hats. It will not be necessary to have
the hats at the rally, but they will be
required for admission to the rooting
section on Saturday, according to
Lapp. They will be placed on sale in
Palo Alto on Thursday, and will be of
the same design as was used last year.
Tryoutees to Perform
The rally will also afford the last
chance for the student body to watch
the five tryoutees for assistant yell
leader perform previous to the Quad
elections on Thursday, when two of
the men will be chosen. The crowd
is urged to watch the five carefully, in
order that there shall be no doubt as
to their respective merits.
"Scotch" Campbell, the "wild bull of
the campus," will be the principal
speaker at tonight's affair. He will tell
of the condition of the Cardinal squad,
and, it is said, may predict the size of
the score in Saturday's game. Then,
again, he not.
Rehearsal of songs and yells, and
the explanation of bleacher stunts \vill
take up as little time as possible, ac
cording to Lapp. "It is the policy of
the rally committee to make rallies
not so much a drill or rehearsal as a
good time for everybody," he said to
day. "We have followed' this course
not because we feel that the Stanford
men and women need to be tolled
into the stadium or the pavilion, but
because a crowd has a lot more fire
when it is enjoying Itself, instead of
being whipped through its paces by
the yell leaders."
Stanford expects every man to do
his rooting.

Dramatics have been made a spe
cial department known as the Acad
emy of Dramatic Art at Columbia uni
versity.
