# Steam Whistle Goes Through "Daily Dozen"
## 
### 
Have any of the scientific minds on
the campus ever wondered why the
steam whistle at the Encina power
house blows every day at 5 o'clock,
and never at 8 or 12 o'clock as all
other well-behaved whistles do?
It is merely a case of preparedness.
Long ago it happened that there was a
fire on the campus, and the whistle
wouldn't blow to summon the neces
sary aid, thereby causing great con
sternation. Ever since that time, at 5
o'clock, the whistle goes through its
"daily dozen," so it will be in order
if another conflagration should sweep
the campus. Nice, isn't it?
