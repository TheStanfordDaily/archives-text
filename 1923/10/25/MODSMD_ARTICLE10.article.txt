# WEYMOUTH AIDS U. S. WITH CLAM INDUSTRY
## 
### 
Regulations designed to place the 1
clam industry of the Alaskan coast on
a permanent basis are being formu- j
lated by the Government as a result
of studies made this summer by Pro
fessor Frank R. Weymouth of the De- j
partment of Physiology.
Professor Weymouth spent two
months this summer studying the vari- j
ous productive clam beds in Alaska to '
determine their extent and growth, '
and make an estimate of the amount
that can be taken out annually for J
canning without, depleting the beds.
With this data in hand, the Depart
ment of Commerce will soon issue
regulations fixing the size of clams
that may be taken, and the amount
and location of beds.
The work is similar to that which !
j
has been carried on for a number of
years by Professor C. H. Gilbert to
bring about regulations with regard to
the salmon industry in Alaska. |
The Alaskan clam industry has been
expanding rapidly, with the result that
in some localities the beds have been
so worked out that their production is
impaired.
Professor Weymouth was accom
panied by H. B. Holmes, Stanford
graduate, who has been doing work
along this line for government bu
reaus. They brought to the campus
several thousand specimens of razor
clam shells, which is the species that
is canned, in order to determine ac- !
curately some points regarding the *
rate of growth in various localities.
