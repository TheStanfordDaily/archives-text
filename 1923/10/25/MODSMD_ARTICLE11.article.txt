# ENTRIES SLOW FOR CROSS COUNTRY RUN BEFORE IDAHO GAME
## 
### 
Entries for Stanford third annual cross
country run are coming in slowly, ac
cording to C. W. Davis, director of in
tramural athletics. As the date is three
weeks distant Davis is confident of a
large lineup at the starting gun, thirty
minutes before the Stanford-Idaho game.
Men intending to enter should begin
training immediately, says Davis. "One
cannot jaunt three miles and a half—
even a half mile—without good previous
training.
Davis has secured permission for the
entrants to use the varsity track for train
ing at any time.
The course as mapped out by "Dink"
Templeton last year and amounts to a
little under three and one-half miles.
Starting with one lap around the sta
dium oval, the contestants will go out the
open end of the stadium, jaunt down Pine
avenue, out Mirada, up to and around
Herbert Hoover's home, down Santa
Ynez, back of Toyon and the tennis
courts, and into the stadium, where the
winner will break the tape in front of
the rooting section just before the start
of the Idaho struggle.
Davis, in a letter sent to all organiza
tions on the campus, stressed the fact
that the winning teams' score would also
bring its organization credit on the intra
mural contest chart.
Rules as to eligibility state that "no
varsity men, nor any man who has won
a letter in track in any college granting
an A I'>. degree will be eligible to com
pete." Entries close November 14 at noon
and contests must report at 1:.?() p. m. on
the day of the run in the stadium.
