# See Red, but Don't Paint the 'C' Red; It's not Sporting

In view of the changing of the big
"C" on the Berkeley campus to "O"
by enthusiastic O. A. C. men attention
has been called to the fact that Stan
ford students have a definite agree
ment with the University of California
that neither college shall mark up the
grounds of the other.
Presidents of the two universities have
announced their own agreement to stop
inter-collegiate contests if the agreement
is violated.
Stanford students at the time the pledge
was signed took the ground that such
actions arc "prep school stuff." Older
students in both universities are familiar
with the situation. The Board of Ath
letic Control, in bringing the agreement
to student attention, believes that there
is less possibility now than ever before
that some younger members of the stu
dent body may "slop over" in their ig
norance and make trouble.
The board has received assurances from
the University of Southern California
that a similar sentiment prevails on the
Trojan campus, and that no paintbrush
vandalism will mar the success of the
coming Stanford-U. S. C. game.
