# Columbia Jester And Chappie to Combine Issues
## 
### 
Now comes word that one of Chap
pie's eastern playmates, the Columbia
Jester, seeks to induce the Old Gent
to span the continent with a combined !
issue of the two publications. Jester
asks that the issue include work of
the helpers of both gentlemen and
that the results be set forth in printed
form for the consumption of both
campuses about the first of the new
year.
Chappie smiles assent and states
that he will do all he can to put such
a fine idea into reality.
Jester took first place in Judge's
College Wits Contest in 1921 and
Chappie did the same trick in 1923.
Mike Ely, editor of Chappie, took the
individual cup for the best editorial
contribution in the contest last spring.
Bob Holmgren, contributor to Judge
and Life as well as head of Jester's
art staff, took the individual cup for
the best piece of art work.
The Big Game number will appear
November 24. Copy for that issue will
be received at any time within the
next two weeks.
