# GORDON DAVIS IS OPTIMISTIC OVER 'ANDROCLES' CAST
## 
### James Muir 
Gordon Davis walked up the Assem-1
bly hall aisle last night at 10 o'clock
and landed a mighty blow between
the shoulder blades of the dramatic
reporter of the Daily Palo Alto. The ;
battered press man picked himself up j
from the floor and demanded satisfac
tion. "That's no way to get publicity
for your show," he remarked.
"We don't need any publicity This j
show runs away with itself!" Thus
the enthusiastic director of "Androcles 1
and the Lion" answered. "I've never
put on a better play and the actors are
just made for their parts. What more
do you want?"
"Nothing," was the logical answer, j
Last night the comedy was run
through from beginning to end for the
first time with the entire cast of about
forty characters. Hardly a hitch was
observed in the acting of the princi
pals who have been at work only a
week and a half. The others, gladia
tors, soldiers, Christians, and slaves,
were appearing for the first time and
had little trouble in catching on to
their manoeuvers. No wonder Davis
was pleased.
The actors, he said, were made for
their parts. With Hollis Chalmers as
Androcles and Arnold Bailey as the
Lion, the two comedy parts are as
sured of success. The hardest job the
director has seems to be keeping the
rest of the cast from doubling up with
laughter when these two start to per
form.
Davis Pleased With Lavinia
Lavinia, the sweet and witty Chris
tian martyr, is ideally taken by Helen
Lewis, says Davis. She has the voice,
appearance and carriage and her in
terpretation seems to leave nothing to
be desired. Norris James plays oppo
site her as the "Handsome Captain"
with a serious aggressiveness that is
in direct contrast.
Costumes for the entire cast will
arrive from San Francisco Friday so
that pictures can be taken Saturday
morning. Rehearsals will last until 12
o'clock next week. Let's hope the show
will look as good to the coach then
as it does now.
