# FIRST FRESHMEN ELEVEN LEA VES TO PLAY TROJANS
## 
### 
With tickets marked "Los Angeles
and return," twenty-six freshman foot
ball men will leave tonight for Satur
day's game with the U. S. C. freshmen.
The contest will start at 2:30 in
the Los Angeles coliseum at Exposi
tion Park.
The tentative list of men to make
the trip is: Ends, Shipkey, Greisser,
Adams, and Hert.li; tackles, Swan,
Stockham, Poulson, and Toffelmier;
guards, Anderson, Mahan, Post, and
Scott; centers, Price and Matcher;
quarters, Baldwin, Mann, and Trom
betta; halves, Hyland, Ryan. Garth
waite, Bogue, Phillips, and Doerr;
fullbacks, Morrison, Moore, and Mc-
Millan.
Cardinal followers are pinning their
hopes on a fast, tricky backfield and a
heavy fighting line. With many good
men for every position, Coach Hunt
will find it difficult to make his final
selection.
Southern California has apparently
seized on all the high school stars
south of Tehachepei for their fresh
man team, from reports coming to

Stanford quarters. Coach Calland is
in his first year of coaching Methodist >
green peas, and has the best of inten
tions of using his prep school con- 1
stellation to wipe out the 10-9 Stan-1
ford victory- of last year.
Price and Natcher, Cardinal centers. t
have been showing up well. Although
Price has received the nod in starting
the important, games, Natcher is good
enough to keep him on his toes to
hold the position.
In Fred Swan at tackle, Hunt has
an able linesman. Swan played end on
the Olympic Club team which defeated
the varsity last year. The shift from
end to tackle has not affected his
game, and he should be the star of the
day next Saturday.
While the first, string men tackle
the U. S. C. freshmen, the stay-at
homes will play Oakland high school
as a preliminary to the varsity and
U. S. C. game. Although Oakland High
went down before the California babes
by a one-sided score, they should make
things interesting for second and ,
third choice men.

While the first, string men tackle
the U. S. C. freshmen, the stay-at

by a one-sided score, they should make
things interesting for second and ,
third choice men.
