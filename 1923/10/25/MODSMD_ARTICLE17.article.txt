# SECRET PRACTICE PREPARES CARDS FOR TROJAN TEAM
## Scores Prove 1923 Eleven Stronger Than Cardinal Squad of Last Seaosn 
### 
With three days of secret practice in
which to concoct new surprises for
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson's Trojans,
Andy Kerr probably feels that his new
Stanford eleven is more than prepared
for the first test of grid strength Sat
urday.
Former games have provided but
i light frolic for the Card eleven this
| year, and the U. S. C. contest looms
as the only hard game of the season
to date. Nevada, Santa Clara, and Oc
cidental were but secondary oppon
ents. What the stronger Stanford team
is capable of against first class compe
j tition remains as a problem for con
i jecture.
Comparative Scores Larger
In four games last year Stanford
was able to amass a total of but 19
points, but the opposition was of some
what different calibre. This season the
total points scored are 209, counting
the Mare Island contest. Without-this
walk-away Stanford points to 124 for
the three games, Nevada, Santa Clara,
I and Occidental.
Despite the fact that these games
have been comparatively easy meat
for the Cards, it goes to prove that
Stanford's potential strength is great
er this year than last.
Only Simple Plays Used
"Scotchy" Campbell has resorted to
■ nothing but straight football: simple
: end runs and off-tackle bucks, a few
passes here and there, and a criss
; cross for variation. Passes, however,
have been scarce in a Card game this
i season. This does not mean that Stan
ford is weak in this department of
the game. In fact what few attempts
Campbell has made to pass have
proved more or less successful. Three
tries in the Santa Clara contest re
sulted in three completed plays.
Substitutes Dependable
Stanford's real strength is on the
bench, in the list of substitutes which
Andy Kerr can rush in to take the
place of the regulars without qualms
of ruining his system.
The only consistent players on
which the coach depends materially
are Nevers, Campbell, Cravens, Ship
key, Baker, and Faville. Every other
position Andy can fill at leisure. Law
son and Johnston are two regular cogs,
but to replace these men are such
players as Dole, Ludeke, and Sholes.
No backfield man is ever sure of
his place. The favorites range from
Cleaveland, Murray, Cuddeback, Hey,
Mitchell, Woodward, Solomon, and
Wheat. All of them are dependable
ground gainers.

Wheat. All of them are dependable
ground gainers.
With three days of secret practice in
which to concoct new surprises for
"Gloomy Gus" Henderson's Trojans,
Andy Kerr probably feels that his new
Stanford eleven is more than prepared
for the first test of grid strength Sat
urday.
Former games have provided but
i light frolic for the Card eleven this
| year, and the U. S. C. contest looms
as the only hard game of the season
to date. Nevada, Santa Clara, and Oc
cidental were but secondary oppon
ents. What the stronger Stanford team
is capable of against first class compe
j tition remains as a problem for con
i jecture.
Comparative Scores Larger
In four games last year Stanford
was able to amass a total of but 19
points, but the opposition was of some
what different calibre. This season the
total points scored are 209, counting
the Mare Island contest. Without-this
walk-away Stanford points to 124 for
the three games, Nevada, Santa Clara,
I and Occidental.
Despite the fact that these games
have been comparatively easy meat
for the Cards, it goes to prove that
Stanford's potential strength is great
er this year than last.
Only Simple Plays Used
"Scotchy" Campbell has resorted to
■ nothing but straight football: simple
: end runs and off-tackle bucks, a few
passes here and there, and a criss
; cross for variation. Passes, however,
have been scarce in a Card game this
i season. This does not mean that Stan
ford is weak in this department of
the game. In fact what few attempts
Campbell has made to pass have
proved more or less successful. Three
tries in the Santa Clara contest re
sulted in three completed plays.
Substitutes Dependable
Stanford's real strength is on the
bench, in the list of substitutes which
Andy Kerr can rush in to take the
place of the regulars without qualms
of ruining his system.
The only consistent players on
which the coach depends materially
are Nevers, Campbell, Cravens, Ship
key, Baker, and Faville. Every other
position Andy can fill at leisure. Law
son and Johnston are two regular cogs,
but to replace these men are such
players as Dole, Ludeke, and Sholes.
No backfield man is ever sure of
his place. The favorites range from
Cleaveland, Murray, Cuddeback, Hey,
Mitchell, Woodward, Solomon, and
Wheat. All of them are dependable
ground gainers.
