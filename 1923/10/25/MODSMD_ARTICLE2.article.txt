# FEDERAL BOARD MEN SUSTAIN $64,000 LOSS
## 
### 
Property supplies for Federal students
will probably be diminished on account
of $64,000 lost by the Veterans' bureau
on plans for the Livermore hospital. This
was announced last night by T. W.
MacQuarrie, co-ordinator, at a meeting
of the Associated Federal students.
"The training period will probably end
in 1926," said MacQuarrie, "although
there may be a few trainees after that
year."
Lorenz Costello was elected president
of the association on the second ballot by
a two-vote majority over G. R. Vinson
haler. H. V. Douglas was elected vice
president on a white ballot. Victor Hard
ing and Robert Burnett were elected sec
retary and treasurer respectively.
The association will give a banquet
this quarter, the date and place to be de
cided by a special committee consisting of
G. R. Vinsonhaler, A. A. Ross, and
George Lusk.
