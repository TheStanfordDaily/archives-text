# "A STITCH IN TIME
## 
### 
Last Saturday when the Golden Bear met the Ore
gon Aggies the California rooting section appeared
with rooters' hats and executed several bleacher
stunts. They were not difficult combinations, but
the C on its gold background added an element of
unity to the mass of Californians as they gave the
"Oski."
This was the first time of the season that rooters'
hats had been requested and even this request was
made on only a few days' notice. Yet approxi
mately 3500 students brought their two-colored
headgear for the varsity contest.
Hark back to November 19 of last year and recall
the miserable failure of several attempts of the
Cardinal rooters to follow the directions of the
yell-leader. The rippling titter among the watching
thousands, as they asked "What is it ?" still lingers.
Why wait until the Big Game to show some
70,000 people how dumb the undergraduates can
be? It is a dead-sure shot that if the rooters have
a little practice right now in obeying instructions of
the yell-leader there will be less cause to worry
about blunders on November 24.
The rally committee has made it a requirement
that all rooters at the U. S. C. game have rooters'
hats which are now on sale. New members of the
student body can evidence their willingness to get
in step with Stanford by donning these Cardinal
colors. And it behooves the rest of us to make
sure at once that we still have last year's red and
white bonnets.
The use of the rooters' hats in several preliminary
contests will more surely prepare the Stanford root
ing section to dedicate in its own way the California
bowl. â€”R* E.
