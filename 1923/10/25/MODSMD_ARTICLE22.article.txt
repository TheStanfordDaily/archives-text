# THE ONWARD SWEEP

### 
Stanford songs and Stanford yells were given
last night with an enthusiasm and unity which be
speaks a student body solidly behind Stanford
teams. It is little things like united cheering, which
give proof that the students are this year backing
the team with whole-souled confidence and faith,
that show the spirit which pervades the campus this
y ear â€”the realization that Stanford is marching ir
resistibly to victory.
