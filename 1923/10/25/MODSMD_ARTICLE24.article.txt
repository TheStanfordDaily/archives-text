Our idea of poetic justice would be to force the per
petrators of the so-called Point System to sit down upon
a large number of their own points, after they hud been
highly sharpened.

The General Store will be open Sunday mornings.
Skipper wants to hold on to his early-rising habit, and
it's no trouble, anyhow. He just goes over and says,
"Sorry, but we're just fresh out of that. Here's some
nice Copenhagen."

We thought
that the open season
on Jolly-ups and
their joys and sorrows,
lasted only from
September until
June.
We were wrong ....
You can get just as jolly, do it cheaper, be just as
objectionable, meet as many new people, and get your
self in just as wrong at any small-town Montana public
dance hall. The latter is perhaps preferable, as you
don't for a moment suppose yourself to be among
friends. —B. W.

The Jolly-Up Furor is Started,
And roommates and friends all are parted
Concerning the merit
Of just as to where it
Should be, if the ladies are carted
To where the big*»battle commences;
Let's pen all the gents in with fences;
Avoid introductions,
For he who is stuck shuns
A subsequent shock to his senses.

So on with democracy's battle;
And furnish your own doll and rattle;
We're children again,
And we'll meet at our ren-
Dezvous, full of our Quadrangle prattle.
—HESPERUS.
