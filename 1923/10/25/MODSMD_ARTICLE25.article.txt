# THIS JOLLY-UP
## 
### 
The jolly-up this Saturday night will be watched with
supreme interest both by those inside and those outside
the white chalk mark that designates the limit over
which the eager may not step nor beyond which the
bashful may retire.
It is about time the jolly-up farce was given the rasp
berry crush once and for all, or reformed so as to make
it something more than an occasion for people who
know each other anyway to dance around while hun
dreds of interested, albeit fearful spectators, look on
with glee and witty remarks.
The truth is, that the jolly-up as handled at present
is too mechanical, too much like a sheep-herding, to
accomplish anything like democratic leavening or level
ing. The "good old days" may not have been such fine
days after all, and certainly the present days are
different. Get hundreds of strangers gathered together
under the beams of the pavilion, which is not exactly
meant for an informal social mix-up anyway, and it is
practically impossible to produce that happy "get-to
gether-even-if-you're-not-acquainted" spirit which the
jo!ly-up protagonists so strongly insist abounds plenti
fully.
This is merely destructive criticism, and that by
itself never did any good. So here's an effort to suggest
something in its stead, which is no doubt just as futile
as the present arrangement, but has the merit of being
new and untried.
Instead of one huge dance hall and one huge orchestra,
with one huge mob congealed around the edges of the
floor, there might be several smaller orchestras spread
around over several smaller dance floors, making
smaller crowds and more general break-up, and socia
bility. Suppose three- or four-piece orchestras were
placed in (1) the Women's Clubhouse, (2) the New
Union lobby, (3) the old Union lobby, and (4) possibly
in the court, for dancing underneath the arches.
Then there would be no concentrated mob of un
worthies standing around to give a brave man the horse
laugh when he does his bit for the University by asking
some woman he never met before if she would "mind
having this dance" with him; and the effect created by
moving from place to place would give the function an
air of sociability and geniality that the present mob
scene under the high pavilion roof certainly lacks.
At any rate, if everybody comes Saturday night they
will get a chance to form their opinions on the subject.
We might hope that the pavilion jolly-up would be a
model of the "good old days"—if we could only blind
ourselves to the fact that Stanford, like everything else,
changes; and not always for the worst, as some pessi
mists claim. If the jolly-up can't be bettered, it's better
dead. —DR. JEKYLL.

We might hope that the pavilion jolly-up would be a
model of the "good old days"—if we could only blind
ourselves to the fact that Stanford, like everything else,
changes; and not always for the worst, as some pessi
mists claim. If the jolly-up can't be bettered, it's better
dead. —DR. JEKYLL.
The jolly-up this Saturday night will be watched with
supreme interest both by those inside and those outside
the white chalk mark that designates the limit over
which the eager may not step nor beyond which the
bashful may retire.
It is about time the jolly-up farce was given the rasp
berry crush once and for all, or reformed so as to make
it something more than an occasion for people who
know each other anyway to dance around while hun
dreds of interested, albeit fearful spectators, look on
with glee and witty remarks.
The truth is, that the jolly-up as handled at present
is too mechanical, too much like a sheep-herding, to
accomplish anything like democratic leavening or level
ing. The "good old days" may not have been such fine
days after all, and certainly the present days are
different. Get hundreds of strangers gathered together
under the beams of the pavilion, which is not exactly
meant for an informal social mix-up anyway, and it is
practically impossible to produce that happy "get-to
gether-even-if-you're-not-acquainted" spirit which the
jo!ly-up protagonists so strongly insist abounds plenti
fully.
This is merely destructive criticism, and that by
itself never did any good. So here's an effort to suggest
something in its stead, which is no doubt just as futile
as the present arrangement, but has the merit of being
new and untried.
Instead of one huge dance hall and one huge orchestra,
with one huge mob congealed around the edges of the
floor, there might be several smaller orchestras spread
around over several smaller dance floors, making
smaller crowds and more general break-up, and socia
bility. Suppose three- or four-piece orchestras were
placed in (1) the Women's Clubhouse, (2) the New
Union lobby, (3) the old Union lobby, and (4) possibly
in the court, for dancing underneath the arches.
Then there would be no concentrated mob of un
worthies standing around to give a brave man the horse
laugh when he does his bit for the University by asking
some woman he never met before if she would "mind
having this dance" with him; and the effect created by
moving from place to place would give the function an
air of sociability and geniality that the present mob
scene under the high pavilion roof certainly lacks.
At any rate, if everybody comes Saturday night they
will get a chance to form their opinions on the subject.
