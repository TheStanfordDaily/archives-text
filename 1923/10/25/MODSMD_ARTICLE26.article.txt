It was a warm day,
especially in the
crowded aisles of the
big department store,
and he had taken his
hat off for a few
minutes of comfort,
as a man will, and
he didn't know where to
go for a spool of thread.
Suddenly a large woman
with a face like a red
moon raising over her
mountain of parcels
wheezed, "Floor-walker,
have you any notions?"
And the poor man
replied, "No, madam —
but I wish I had . . fact
is, I . . er . ." And he
put on his hat and ran.
