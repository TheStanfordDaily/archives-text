Captain "Scotchy" Campbell did not
give U. S. C. statisticans in Los Angeles
a chance to see what Stanford had up
her sleeve. Campbell kept well within the
realm of straight football during the en
tire game, using many end runs and off
tackle bucks, and a springling of passes
for variety.
Hey, who showed a world of
promise against Occidental is sure to get
a chance to show his wares in the U. S. C.
game. Hey is a iiard hitter and hard to
pull to the ground once he is started.
The 1927 team's ace-in-the-hole next
Saturday will be Morrison, plunging full
back. Although Morrison in an in-and
outer, when he is going good he is a hard
man to stop. If "Duke" has a good day,
the U. S. C. babes are apt to remember
him.
"A plunging line." That is what Andy
Kerr has developed more than anything
else. A line that can plow through and
block kicks; one that makes a hole as big
as a barn, and is capable of keeping the
opposing team from doing the same. That
is one asset of the Stanford team that
will buck U. S. C. Saturday.
Coach Hunt's freshmen gridders will
have to exhibit more punch than shown
in the Davis Farm and Modesto Junior
College games if they hope to defeat the
strong U. S. C. freshman outfit.
Everyone is wondering what Washing
ton will do to California. The "Huskies"
are indeed living up to their name. They
boast a 200 pound line from end to end,
and not much less than weight in the
backfield.
When the third freshmen tackle Oak
land high school as a preliminary to the
varsity and U. S. C. fracas, they will
offer an interesting comparison with the
California first year men. The Bruin
Cubs had but little trouble in running up
a heavy score on the trans-bay lads.
Ernie Nevers still holds the pole in
race for the full-back position, despite
the fact that his opposition is A1 mate
rial. Nevers seems to improve his kick
ing in every game, which speaks well for
"Dink" Templeton's coaching.
Much can be done to improve the
Cardinal interference. Several of the
back-field players failed repeatedly to
leave their feet against the Occidental
secondary defense.
The two Freds, Swan and Anderson,
at tackle and guard respectively, will be
well worth watching in action Saturday.
Swan, former Berkeley high and Olympic
Club performer, has been going "great
guns," and should smear up more than
one Trojan play before it is well started.

pull to the ground once he is started.
The 1927 team's ace-in-the-hole next
Saturday will be Morrison, plunging full
back. Although Morrison in an in-and
outer, when he is going good he is a hard
man to stop. If "Duke" has a good day,
the U. S. C. babes are apt to remember
him.
"A plunging line." That is what Andy
Kerr has developed more than anything
else. A line that can plow through and
block kicks; one that makes a hole as big
as a barn, and is capable of keeping the
opposing team from doing the same. That
is one asset of the Stanford team that
will buck U. S. C. Saturday.
Coach Hunt's freshmen gridders will
have to exhibit more punch than shown
in the Davis Farm and Modesto Junior
College games if they hope to defeat the
strong U. S. C. freshman outfit.
Everyone is wondering what Washing
ton will do to California. The "Huskies"
are indeed living up to their name. They
boast a 200 pound line from end to end,
and not much less than weight in the
backfield.
When the third freshmen tackle Oak
land high school as a preliminary to the
varsity and U. S. C. fracas, they will
offer an interesting comparison with the
California first year men. The Bruin
Cubs had but little trouble in running up
a heavy score on the trans-bay lads.
Ernie Nevers still holds the pole in
race for the full-back position, despite
the fact that his opposition is A1 mate
rial. Nevers seems to improve his kick
ing in every game, which speaks well for
"Dink" Templeton's coaching.
Much can be done to improve the
Cardinal interference. Several of the
back-field players failed repeatedly to
leave their feet against the Occidental
secondary defense.
The two Freds, Swan and Anderson,
at tackle and guard respectively, will be
well worth watching in action Saturday.
Swan, former Berkeley high and Olympic
Club performer, has been going "great
guns," and should smear up more than
one Trojan play before it is well started.
Captain "Scotchy" Campbell did not
give U. S. C. statisticans in Los Angeles
a chance to see what Stanford had up
her sleeve. Campbell kept well within the
realm of straight football during the en
tire game, using many end runs and off
tackle bucks, and a springling of passes
for variety.
Hey, who showed a world of
promise against Occidental is sure to get
a chance to show his wares in the U. S. C.
game. Hey is a iiard hitter and hard to
pull to the ground once he is started.
