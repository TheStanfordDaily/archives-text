# Famous Belgian Paper Is Reinforced by Librarian
## 
### 
Japanese tissue paper has been used
by the Hoover War Library to pre
serve the pages of "La Libre Bel
gique," famous Belgian newspaper
printed during the German occupa
tion of 1915-1918. The library has the
complete edition of 171 copies.
During the war paper became so
poor that it was feared none of the
leaves could be preserved. The New
York Public Library devised this meth
od, and has covered all of its papers.
The process is very expensive as it
involves much hand labor. "La Libre
Belgique" is the only newspaper which
the library has preserved in this way.
