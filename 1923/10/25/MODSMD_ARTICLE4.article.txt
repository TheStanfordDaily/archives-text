# Roughs Victorious In Pavilion Brawl After Noisy Rally
## 
### David Lamson 
Facing overwhelming odds, the wo
men of Stanford last night put up a
plucky battle in their attempt to dance
in the Basketball Pavilion, following
the rally held before the U. S. C. game
next Saturday.
Although it is reported that in a few
scattered instances dancing was suc
cessfully accomplished, the newspaper
decision went unanimously to the
roughs, who took the cast-iron dancing
slipper through sheer weight of num
bers. Forming a circle about the
dancers, the mob closed in upon itself
with crushing effect on those in the
center.
Regardless of this, it was a good
party. Yells and songs were freely
given and enthusiastically applauded
by the throng that packed the pavilion.
Burt Lapp, yell leader, emphasized
in particular the necessity for wear
ing rooters' hats to the game Satur
day. These hats may be secured at
Roos Bros, in Palo Alto. They are the
same design as used last year.
Lapp also introduced those whom
he termed the "green peas;" that is,
the five tryoutees for places as as-
sistant yell leaders, two of whom were
to be elected today.
Captain "Scotch" Campbell was un
able to make his scheduled appear
ance, as he was detained at a "chalk
talk."
Rehearsal of the rooting acts ended
at 7:30, leaving half an hour for the
use of Grinstead's orchestra. Some
hesitation was displayed by the wo
men in entering the arena; this was
overcome by a determined rush on the
part of the men, who escorted their
very temporary partners onto that
portion of the floor not in use by the
"stags."
A regrettable tendency shown by
some of the less hardy spirits among
the women to walk out on the party
was, as it were, nipped in the bud.
An admission charge of absolutely
nothing was made to the rally. Of
the sum thus obtained, the Rally Com
mittee, it is said, took $50,000 and
bought cough drops.
The third of the series of rollicking
rallies is planned for next week, prob
ably on Thursday.
