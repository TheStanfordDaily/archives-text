The Jolly-up!
You told him you'd meet him there.
Now what are you going to wear?
Why not cut your 11 o'clock and go
up to Livingston's and get that ador
able novelty sweater vest you saw for
only $8.95. It's such a pretty shade
of buff with such clever plaid stripes.
It ivill look so nice with that plain tan
camel's hair skirt.
And do get that smart English broad
cloth blouse with the peggy collar.
The skirt is only $10.75 and the blouse
$5.95. What a lucky thought!
