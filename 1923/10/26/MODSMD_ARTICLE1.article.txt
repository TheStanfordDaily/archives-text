# COACH 'HUSKY' HUNT'S BASES HAVE TWO BATTLES SCHEDULED
## First Freshmen Meet Trojan Yearlings 
### Walter Campbell 
The Cardinal freshmen face their
last real test before the California
freshman game tomorrow afternoon in
the Los Angeles coliseum, when they
meet the fast U. S. C. babes. The out
come is doubtful, although the Card
first year men should cross the south
erners' goal line some time during the
contest.
With twenty-six men to choose from,
Coach Hunt will have little trouble
finding available substitutes should
the going prove rough. And the going
will be rough, if predictions from the
South are true.
U. S. C. Supporters Confident
Supporters of the southern team are
so confident in their team's ability that
wagers are being offered that the Tro
jans will emerge victors by a 28-0
score. However, this does not ring
true when the comparative merits of
the teams are considered from an un
prejudiced viewpoint.
Man for man, the U. S. C. team has
more high school stars than the Cards.
Every high school football player of
note in Southern California, with a
few exceptions, seems to have regis
tered at the Methodist school. Follow
ers of the team boast that there are
twenty-two high school captains on
the freshman squad. But stars do not
make a co-ordinating machine. This
has been proved time after time. It is
on this fact that the Stanford babes
base their hopes.
Card Material Good
While so many stars are not found
in the ranks of the freshman eleven,
the material has been good. From it,
Coach Hunt has welded a machine
that will either show its power or its
defects tomorrow. Hunt has little need
to depend on stars for his gains, since
there are several men for every posi
tion and all are on par. He has taken
two complete lines and three sets of
backs to the southern city with him.
Which men will start the game is still
largely a problem.
Coach Hunt's line will average 171,
