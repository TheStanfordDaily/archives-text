# COACH 'HUSKY' HUNT'S BASES HAVE TWO BATTLES SCHEDULED
## First Freshmen Meet Trojan Yearlings 
### Walter Campbell 
The Cardinal freshmen face their
last real test before the California
freshman game tomorrow afternoon in
the Los Angeles coliseum, when they
meet the fast U. S. C. babes. The out
come is doubtful, although the Card
first year men should cross the south
erners' goal line some time during the
contest.
With twenty-six men to choose from,
Coach Hunt will have little trouble
finding available substitutes should
the going prove rough. And the going
will be rough, if predictions from the
South are true.
U. S. C. Supporters Confident
Supporters of the southern team are
so confident in their team's ability that
wagers are being offered that the Tro
jans will emerge victors by a 28-0
score. However, this does not ring
true when the comparative merits of
the teams are considered from an un
prejudiced viewpoint.
Man for man, the U. S. C. team has
more high school stars than the Cards.
Every high school football player of
note in Southern California, with a
few exceptions, seems to have regis
tered at the Methodist school. Follow
ers of the team boast that there are
twenty-two high school captains on
the freshman squad. But stars do not
make a co-ordinating machine. This
has been proved time after time. It is
on this fact that the Stanford babes
base their hopes.
Card Material Good
While so many stars are not found
in the ranks of the freshman eleven,
the material has been good. From it,
Coach Hunt has welded a machine
that will either show its power or its
defects tomorrow. Hunt has little need
to depend on stars for his gains, since
there are several men for every posi
tion and all are on par. He has taken
two complete lines and three sets of
backs to the southern city with him.
Which men will start the game is still
largely a problem.
Coach Hunt's line will average 171,
fans are concerned. The Trojans are
more or less "on" to the Golden Bears,
but Stanford has been proving an
enigma in local quarters.
Aud that is why some 30,000 local
fans, the great majority of whom were
Trojan supporters, journeyed to the
Los Angeles Coliseum last Saturday
to see the Cards annihilate Occidental.
They came away with a decided re
spect for the Northerners, to say the
least. Playing only the simplest sort
of game, straight-play, the Cardinals'
class stood out most impressively. Had
they opened up at all, they should eas
ily have beaten the Oxy team by twice
as large a score; 3nd the crowd
seemed quite aware of their potenti
alities.
Stanford Is Respected
Let there be no mistake. The Tro
jans have 100* per cent greater respect
for the 1923 Cardinals than they had
for the team of a year ago. And, also,
they are preparing for it with greater

zeal than they ever before exhibited.
Tlfey are back from Seattle with re
venge seething in their hearts. Stan
ford happens to be next on the list.
If the Trojan backfield works
against the Cardinals as it did in the
third quarter of the Nevada game,
then local fans will look for surprising
results even in the face of the Wash
ington disaster. The backfield men
have the stuff if they will just keep
going. The Trojan line is about as
good as it was last year.

the material has been good. From it,
Coach Hunt has welded a machine
that will either show its power or its
defects tomorrow. Hunt has little need
to depend on stars for his gains, since
there are several men for every posi
tion and all are on par. He has taken
two complete lines and three sets of
backs to the southern city with him.
Which men will start the game is still
largely a problem.
Coach Hunt's line will average 171,
fans are concerned. The Trojans are
more or less "on" to the Golden Bears,
but Stanford has been proving an
enigma in local quarters.
Aud that is why some 30,000 local
fans, the great majority of whom were
Trojan supporters, journeyed to the
Los Angeles Coliseum last Saturday
to see the Cards annihilate Occidental.
They came away with a decided re
spect for the Northerners, to say the
least. Playing only the simplest sort
of game, straight-play, the Cardinals'
class stood out most impressively. Had
they opened up at all, they should eas
ily have beaten the Oxy team by twice
as large a score; 3nd the crowd
seemed quite aware of their potenti
alities.
Stanford Is Respected
Let there be no mistake. The Tro
jans have 100* per cent greater respect
for the 1923 Cardinals than they had
for the team of a year ago. And, also,
they are preparing for it with greater

zeal than they ever before exhibited.
Tlfey are back from Seattle with re
venge seething in their hearts. Stan
ford happens to be next on the list.
If the Trojan backfield works
against the Cardinals as it did in the
third quarter of the Nevada game,
then local fans will look for surprising
results even in the face of the Wash
ington disaster. The backfield men
have the stuff if they will just keep
going. The Trojan line is about as
good as it was last year.
The Cardinal freshmen face their
last real test before the California
freshman game tomorrow afternoon in
the Los Angeles coliseum, when they
meet the fast U. S. C. babes. The out
come is doubtful, although the Card
first year men should cross the south
erners' goal line some time during the
contest.
With twenty-six men to choose from,
Coach Hunt will have little trouble
finding available substitutes should
the going prove rough. And the going
will be rough, if predictions from the
South are true.
U. S. C. Supporters Confident
Supporters of the southern team are
so confident in their team's ability that
wagers are being offered that the Tro
jans will emerge victors by a 28-0
score. However, this does not ring
true when the comparative merits of
the teams are considered from an un
prejudiced viewpoint.
Man for man, the U. S. C. team has
more high school stars than the Cards.
Every high school football player of
note in Southern California, with a
few exceptions, seems to have regis
tered at the Methodist school. Follow
ers of the team boast that there are
twenty-two high school captains on
the freshman squad. But stars do not
make a co-ordinating machine. This
has been proved time after time. It is
on this fact that the Stanford babes
base their hopes.

in the ranks of the freshman eleven,
the material has been good. From it,
