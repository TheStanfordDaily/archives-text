# World Peace After Armistice Possible Says Dr. Jordan
## 
### 
Peace could have been had immediately
after the armistice was signed if the op
posing factions liad co-operated in the
settlement of their difficulties. As it was,
"the breach was left open, and germs,
microbes, and senators got in."
Freedom to know the truth is the most
important aspect of freedom.
The only excuse for government is
that it improves conditions for the in
dividual man.
The races that average the highest
have individual freedom.
"Anything is fair in love or war," but
there are some things that are not fair
in war.
These are a few of the pertinent re
marks made by Dr. Jordan in a dis
cussion on "Why Is Freedom Worth
While?" at his home last evening.
"It is right that we should think well
of our country," Dr. Jordan said. "But
it is not right to believe in the theory,
'Our country, right or wrong'. Our
country may be right or she may be
wrong. If she is wrong, it is our duty
to make her right. The more we think
of our own inability the less evident it
is to other people.
"I #ecognized flaws in the German gov
ernment when everyone else was prais
ing it: the effect of such a government
was to destroy the individuality of the
people. Intelligence and education must
be had in government to insure freedom.
Justice is the condition of society that
enables every child to make the most out
of life.
"The war was a great mistake. It
didn't do us any good, nor Europe, either.
And as regards our policy, the Espionage
Act was the most humiliating thing in
our history, with the exception of the
Fugitive Slave Act."
