# CARDS READY FOR TROJAN INVASION
## STANFORD OPENS CONFERENCE SEASON AGAINST HENDERSON'S U. S. C. GRID SQUAD TOMORROW Cardinal Line Expected to Hold Heavy Southern Aggregation; Kerr Will Use New Plays 
### David Meiklejohn 
"Watch U. S. C. Watch Gloomy Gus Henderson!"
These admonitions have been staring us in the face more or less threaten
ingly all season, and now we are prepared to watch the mighty Trojan wield
his far-famed battle-axe. At the same time, Stanford has an axe to grind, and
it will all happen in the stadium at 2:30 tomorrow.
Washington boasts a well-found claim of having blunted the Trojan hatchet,
but Gloomy Gus is a fast worker as well as a pessimist ,and a few days of
practice would produce wonders. It remains for the Cards to burn the axe
handle and melt the head.
What Washington did to U. S. C.is all a closed book —closed and forgotten.
The new plot hinges on what Stanford will do to the same Trojan aggregation.
The Huskies proved themselves to.be a real eleven, aggressive, powerful,
and heavy. U. S. C. met her Waterloo, feut that doesn't lower her any in

'popular estimation. Instead, the Tro
jans must be dealt with all over again.
It means that Stanford is meeting a
team which realizes its weaknesses
and is making every effort to eradi
cate them. No overconfidence, no
cocksureness mar the U. S. C. team,
for it knows it is meeting a team
[ which is in many ways of equal if not
j superior calibre.
Will Be Punting Duel
It begins to look as if the stands
will be treated to a punting duel be
tween Otto Anderson, who boots the
pigskin some 65 yards, and Ernie
Nevers, who is capable of giving the
Swede a race for honors in yardage.
Both men are hard line plungers, and
also dependable passers.
Not only will it be a punting battle,
but a contest of brains as well: the
brains of two of the best field generals
on the coast, Captain "Scotchy" Camp
bell of Stanford, and Captain Chet
Dolley of U. S. C.
The Cards are not particularly in
terested in what the gloomy mentor
has up his sleeve. All faith is pinned
on Andy Kerr who, it is confidently
believed, has a bag of tricks all his
j own.
Cards Have Heavier Team
The U. S. C. team as a unit aver
ages 180 pounds as against 184 pounds
for the Cards. Line averages are 188
pounds for Stanford, and 185 pounds
for U. S. C. The Stanford backfleld
men tip the scales at 176 pounds, while
the Trojan backs average 171. Stan- :
ford therefore has one advantage, in
weight. But it is such a slight one
that it is highly improbable that it
will have much to do with the final
outcome.
"Chuch" Johnston is in critical con
dition, but his name on the line-up
means that Kerr probably will start
him at the tackle position opposing
Norman Anderson. In" case of emer
gency, Kerr can rely on Fred Ludeke
whose 207 pound* of beef would be a
•fitting competitor for Anderson's 208. !
Jim Lawson will be back in the lists
after an injury to his rib in the Oxy
fracas. Paul Murray is slated for a
halfback berth. Murray was out of the !
Occidental game with a sprained (
ankle.

Cards Have Heavier Team
The U. S. C. team as a unit aver
ages 180 pounds as against 184 pounds
for the Cards. Line averages are 188
pounds for Stanford, and 185 pounds
for U. S. C. The Stanford backfleld
men tip the scales at 176 pounds, while
the Trojan backs average 171. Stan- :
ford therefore has one advantage, in
weight. But it is such a slight one
that it is highly improbable that it
will have much to do with the final
outcome.
"Chuch" Johnston is in critical con
dition, but his name on the line-up
means that Kerr probably will start
him at the tackle position opposing
Norman Anderson. In" case of emer
gency, Kerr can rely on Fred Ludeke
whose 207 pound* of beef would be a
•fitting competitor for Anderson's 208. !
Jim Lawson will be back in the lists
after an injury to his rib in the Oxy
fracas. Paul Murray is slated for a
halfback berth. Murray was out of the !
Occidental game with a sprained (
ankle.
"Watch U. S. C. Watch Gloomy Gus Henderson!"
These admonitions have been staring us in the face more or less threaten
ingly all season, and now we are prepared to watch the mighty Trojan wield
his far-famed battle-axe. At the same time, Stanford has an axe to grind, and
it will all happen in the stadium at 2:30 tomorrow.
Washington boasts a well-found claim of having blunted the Trojan hatchet,
but Gloomy Gus is a fast worker as well as a pessimist ,and a few days of
practice would produce wonders. It remains for the Cards to burn the axe
handle and melt the head.
What Washington did to U. S. C.is all a closed book —closed and forgotten.
The new plot hinges on what Stanford will do to the same Trojan aggregation.
The Huskies proved themselves to.be a real eleven, aggressive, powerful,
and heavy. U. S. C. met her Waterloo, feut that doesn't lower her any in

'popular estimation. Instead, the Tro
jans must be dealt with all over again.
It means that Stanford is meeting a
team which realizes its weaknesses
and is making every effort to eradi
cate them. No overconfidence, no
cocksureness mar the U. S. C. team,
for it knows it is meeting a team
[ which is in many ways of equal if not
j superior calibre.
Will Be Punting Duel
It begins to look as if the stands
will be treated to a punting duel be
tween Otto Anderson, who boots the
pigskin some 65 yards, and Ernie
Nevers, who is capable of giving the
Swede a race for honors in yardage.
Both men are hard line plungers, and
also dependable passers.
Not only will it be a punting battle,
but a contest of brains as well: the
brains of two of the best field generals
on the coast, Captain "Scotchy" Camp
bell of Stanford, and Captain Chet
Dolley of U. S. C.
The Cards are not particularly in
terested in what the gloomy mentor
has up his sleeve. All faith is pinned
on Andy Kerr who, it is confidently
believed, has a bag of tricks all his
j own.
