# CARDS ARE PUZZLE TO TROJANS, SAYS U. S. C. SPORT CRITIC
## Stanford's Showing Against Oxy Inspires Respect for Varsity in South 
### Ross Wills, Sport Editor U. S. C. Trojan 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26. —"Gloomy
Gus" Henderson was aptly named. It
is all because of that Washington
game. He took his Trojans into that
game with the confidence of almost
the whole Pacific coast behind him.
I say "almost;" practically everyone
but eleven men of Washington thought
the Trojans superior, but those eleven
men were enough to provide the big
gest upset in the entire history of
Coast football.
If the Trojan team were a puzzle
after its first two games, it is more
than ever so now. Crepe is the popular
cloth worn down in these parts these
perilous days. Polks just can't believe
the plain facts about that Washington
game—but there they stand. And so
they're mumbling incoherently, "What
will Stanford and California do to
them!"
It may or may not be surprising to
learn that ever since Stanford
swamped Santa Clara by such a large
score, the big red team has actually
been discussed with more anxiety by
Trojan supporters than the Golden
Bears. The quite astonishing come
back of the Cardinals has been the
one real football phenomenon on the
Coast this year, so far as U. S. C.
