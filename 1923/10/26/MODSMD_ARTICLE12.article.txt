# CARDS ARE PUZZLE TO TROJANS, SAYS U. S. C. SPORT CRITIC
## Stanford's Showing Against Oxy Inspires Respect for Varsity in South 
### Ross Wills, Sport Editor U. S. C. Trojan 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26. —"Gloomy
Gus" Henderson was aptly named. It
is all because of that Washington
game. He took his Trojans into that
game with the confidence of almost
the whole Pacific coast behind him.
I say "almost;" practically everyone
but eleven men of Washington thought
the Trojans superior, but those eleven
men were enough to provide the big
gest upset in the entire history of
Coast football.
If the Trojan team were a puzzle
after its first two games, it is more
than ever so now. Crepe is the popular
cloth worn down in these parts these
perilous days. Polks just can't believe
the plain facts about that Washington
game—but there they stand. And so
they're mumbling incoherently, "What
will Stanford and California do to
them!"
It may or may not be surprising to
learn that ever since Stanford
swamped Santa Clara by such a large
score, the big red team has actually
been discussed with more anxiety by
Trojan supporters than the Golden
Bears. The quite astonishing come
back of the Cardinals has been the
one real football phenomenon on the
Coast this year, so far as U. S. C.
and his backfleld 161. The Trojans are
a trifle heavier than that. Those who
saw the heavy U. S. C. yearling team
go down to defeat before the light
1926 team last year, however, know
that weight means but little in the
face of fight, determination, and ex
perience. If these three factors still
hold good, the Stanford babes should
win tomorrow.
Trojans Have Good Backs
U. S. C. places the burden of her
ground gaining on two pairs of capa
ble shoulders. Said shoulders belong
to Mr. Taylor, fullback, and Laranetta,
halfback. Taylor, a colored boy, uses
his huge body to crash through the
line. Laranetta is said to be one of
the prettiest open-field runners seen
at U. S. C. in recent years. But with
Swan, Anderson, and Stockain to stop
Taylor, and Shipkey and Griesser to
stop Laranetta, it is doubtful if either
will run far in "the direction of the
Stanford goal-line.
On the other hand, let Hyland or

Garthwaite get into the open field
with the ball in their possession a few
times, and the timer may as well fire
his gun. The game will be over as
far as U. S. C.is concerned.

will run far in "the direction of the
Stanford goal-line.
On the other hand, let Hyland or

Garthwaite get into the open field
with the ball in their possession a few
times, and the timer may as well fire
his gun. The game will be over as
far as U. S. C.is concerned.
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 26. —"Gloomy
Gus" Henderson was aptly named. It
is all because of that Washington
game. He took his Trojans into that
game with the confidence of almost
the whole Pacific coast behind him.
I say "almost;" practically everyone
but eleven men of Washington thought
the Trojans superior, but those eleven
men were enough to provide the big
gest upset in the entire history of
Coast football.
If the Trojan team were a puzzle
after its first two games, it is more
than ever so now. Crepe is the popular
cloth worn down in these parts these
perilous days. Polks just can't believe
the plain facts about that Washington
game—but there they stand. And so
they're mumbling incoherently, "What
will Stanford and California do to
them!"
It may or may not be surprising to
learn that ever since Stanford
swamped Santa Clara by such a large
score, the big red team has actually
been discussed with more anxiety by
Trojan supporters than the Golden
Bears. The quite astonishing come
back of the Cardinals has been the
one real football phenomenon on the
Coast this year, so far as U. S. C.
and his backfleld 161. The Trojans are
a trifle heavier than that. Those who
saw the heavy U. S. C. yearling team
go down to defeat before the light
1926 team last year, however, know
that weight means but little in the
face of fight, determination, and ex
perience. If these three factors still
hold good, the Stanford babes should
win tomorrow.
Trojans Have Good Backs
U. S. C. places the burden of her
ground gaining on two pairs of capa
ble shoulders. Said shoulders belong
to Mr. Taylor, fullback, and Laranetta,
halfback. Taylor, a colored boy, uses
his huge body to crash through the
line. Laranetta is said to be one of
the prettiest open-field runners seen
at U. S. C. in recent years. But with
Swan, Anderson, and Stockain to stop
Taylor, and Shipkey and Griesser to
stop Laranetta, it is doubtful if either
will run far in "the direction of the
Stanford goal-line.
