# BABE SOCCER MEN TO OPPOSE RUSSIAN CLUB
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team will meet
the Russian Athletic Club team at 3:30
tomorrow afternoon on the varsity
soccer field in a scheduled game in
Section 2 of the University and Club
Soccer league. Maloney has not an
nounced the freshman line-up, and no
selections will be made until after
practice this afternoon.
The varsity will take a rest this
week, and prepare to resume its sched
ule next week. The lay-off is due to
the fact that the varsity had two
games last week, one of which was
with the Palo Alto American Legion.
It was played ahead of schedule as
part of the Legion sports program dur
ing the national convention.
