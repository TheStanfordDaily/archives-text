# The 						Standard of Action

When colleges followed the prep school ideal,
Stanford and California were continually stirred by
raids of rival student bodies onto the opposition
campus. Yellow and red paint brushes were wielded
with dazzling effect, the aim being a desecration of
beauty on the grounds and buildings of the college
being daubed.
History majors know the result. Something too
flagrant to be excused as "collegiate" took place,
Stanford and California broke off relations, and for
some years Stanford played her big games with the
college at Santa Clara.
Now Stanford and California have an agreement
pledging both student bodies to refrain from small
town vandalism, the penalty being cancellation of
the Big Game and severance of athletic relations.
Such a penalty is unnecessary, for all practical
purposes, as long as Stanford and California con
tinue to enroll men and bar children.
So fixed and common is this idea of respect for
rival campuses that no one on the Farm has even
thought it necessary to make a similar agreement
with the University of Southern California.
Truly Stanford is now more than ever engaged
in the education of men rather than the suppression
of boys.
