An exuberant horde of U. S. C. rooters will
swarm onto the campus tomorrow. To them the
Trojan-Cardinal contest is an event, rating as one
of their biggest games.
It is Stanford's privilege to give them a welcome,
see that they are properly cared for, and join as far
as possible in their enthusiasm. Ibis may be rather
difficult, for the game tomorrow is important to
Stanford only as a first test of Coast Conference
strength.
One rather doubts whether it will be even a real
test, in view of the 22-0 defeat Washington gave
the Trojans. But the southern rooters are coming
with the intention of showing Stanford how things
are done, both on the field and in the rooting section.
Every one knows what will happen on the field;
this is Stanford's year, and nothing on earth can
stop her from winning.
In the rooting section those wearing red hats can
also give the southerners a lesson in how a football
team should be supported, while practicing for the
real performance at Berkeley, November 24.
Meanwhile, Stanford welcomes the U. S. C. visi
tors, and hopes that their enthusiasm has not raised
their hopes too high.
