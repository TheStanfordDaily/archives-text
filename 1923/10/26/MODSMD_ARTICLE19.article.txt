A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Cecil
Cecil is the bath-and-shave warbler who
brings early morning sunshine into our sti
fled lives. He has eight o'clocks nine
times a week.
Under the shower Cecil blithely carols
"Oh, You Beautiful, Bee-yootiful Doll." A
ballad accompanies every turn of the blade
sharpener, a roundelay every stroke of the
razor. His jtoothbrush punctuates but does
not terminate a pessimistic melody on the
state of the banana market this morning.
As he knots his necktie he indulges in hum
ming some light harmony concerning moons
and Junes and doves, and whistles through
his teeth while shining his shoes.
Some day I'm going to revenge myself on
Cecil. I'll wake him up about four a. m. and
make him listen to me render "Only a Dog
catcher's Daughter" in my rare nasal obbli
gato.
Leroy
Leroy is known around the campus as
The Barber's Delight.
He can always be found sitting in num
ber one chair, saying "Yes" every time the
chief razor-waver asks him if he wants an
application of facial clay or his locks done
up in curl papers.
Once a rude engineer remarked that he
thought Leroy had his hair parted a bit
off-center. Leroy reported him to the Men's
Council for conduct unbecoming to a Stan
ford gent.

PASSION PLUS
"Go 'Way closer!" she cried,
As I sat by her side
In the dusk of the dawning day;
I kissed her, and then
She said "Stop it again!"
So I kept sitting closer away.

THE WELL-DRESSED HAM
Hints on Dress
For Those Who Care
Golf trousers are being worn a great deal this season.
So are the other kinds.
One leader of fashion brushes his teeth every day with
a brush especially designed for that purpose.
The index of the elite this year is the Hookawn
Cravat, which does away with all unnecessary care for
eight o'clocks.
A gentleman is always known by his shoe-laces. f>o
not permit a lace to be knotted more than seven times.
A new article of clothing is appearing in shop win
dows. It is quaintly named The Wickey, and is an
ingenious contrivance whereby cuffs are attached by
elastics to a false shirt-front. Buy one and fool your
friends. —G. D.

Hon. Head of Cabbage:
Let me ask 7 or 19 questions on game of golfing, which
it require special pant to play in.
Does player use for punishing instrument rifle and
other shot-guns? One (1) player say he yesterday shoot
birdie and other eagles. Some say golf is clubbed to
death. Some famus golf clubs are mashem, diblick,'
Mayfield and Golf of California. How he come?
—Satsuma Kimono.

THE SNOOZE-COURSE BIRD
In winter when the woods are white,
I never go to sleep at night;
In summer, quite the other way,
I get my slumber every day. —G. D.

A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Cecil
Cecil is the bath-and-shave warbler who
brings early morning sunshine into our sti
fled lives. He has eight o'clocks nine
times a week.
Under the shower Cecil blithely carols
"Oh, You Beautiful, Bee-yootiful Doll." A
ballad accompanies every turn of the blade
sharpener, a roundelay every stroke of the
razor. His jtoothbrush punctuates but does
not terminate a pessimistic melody on the
state of the banana market this morning.
As he knots his necktie he indulges in hum
ming some light harmony concerning moons
and Junes and doves, and whistles through
his teeth while shining his shoes.
Some day I'm going to revenge myself on
Cecil. I'll wake him up about four a. m. and
make him listen to me render "Only a Dog
catcher's Daughter" in my rare nasal obbli
gato.
Leroy
Leroy is known around the campus as
The Barber's Delight.
He can always be found sitting in num
ber one chair, saying "Yes" every time the
chief razor-waver asks him if he wants an
application of facial clay or his locks done
up in curl papers.
Once a rude engineer remarked that he
thought Leroy had his hair parted a bit
off-center. Leroy reported him to the Men's
Council for conduct unbecoming to a Stan
ford gent.

"Go 'Way closer!" she cried,
As I sat by her side
In the dusk of the dawning day;
I kissed her, and then
She said "Stop it again!"
So I kept sitting closer away.
