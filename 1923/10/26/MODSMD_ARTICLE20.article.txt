# ME AND KELLY

"Say, Kelly," I asks my friend after listening to a
lecture yesterday dealing supposedly with mycosis, "why
is it that these professors, some of them, and this here
prof of Tinchology especially, wanders around from the
subject so much, and never hits the nail on the head
more than once every so often?"
"What do you refer to now, sap?" Kelly asks me,
lighting up his pipe and getting ready to enjoy an argu
ment.
"Well," I says, "when I gets out of that course I expect
to make part of my living out of it. We has still 800
pages to cover, and here three weeks are gone, and we
have done 40. And all today the professor spends
arguing with some 'egg about a problem in sociology,
when we was talking about mycosis and Tinchology.
With the result that we cover 3 pages of text."
"Don't worry none, my son," Kelly says. "About the
last week you are going to cover 600 pages. The prof
will up and realize that he has quite a bit for you to do,
so he will it to you to read over and then give
it to you in the finals."
"But he's holding us up now . .
"Them kind of profs are the bandits on the royal road
to learning," Kelly explodes. "They require you to do
everything punctual or they raise hell and lower your
grade; yet they dally along and bunk you out of about
three-quarters of what you could get out of your course
by aimless chatter and brainless argument. I . .
"What do you know about college, Kelly?" I asks the
old man.
"Why, I had the same experience, with my Alma
Mater," he says. I took a correspondence course in
Engineering oncet, and the prof always was late in
gettin' the lecture into the mail!" —H. M.
