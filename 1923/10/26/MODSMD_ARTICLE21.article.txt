Two men, sitting in the
observation car of a
train speeding across
the desert, sat looking
out to the west. The
horizon sky was ablaze
with what might have
been the reflection of
the flames from some
great city burning over
on the curve of the world.
"Beautiful sunset," said
one of them. "Look at
that coloring!"
"Yeah—" from the other,
"about time that waiter
called dinner, isn't it ?"
"Beg pardon?"
"I say, it's about time
for dinner."
"Oh," said the first man,
turning his eyes back
to the west.
