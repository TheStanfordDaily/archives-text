### 
NORMAN, Okla. â€”In support of the
theory that university students are
impecunious, there is cited the recent
robbery ot the Sigma Chi house at
the University of Oklahoma, where the

burglar obtained $10 in cash and four
watches valued at $250. At the Sigma
Nu house the burgar fared better, ob
taining $36 as a regard. The Kappa
Sigma house yielded the lowest re
turns, since only $3 and a gold watch
were reported missing.
