# Workers Emancipated by Sign in University Shop
## 
### 
The slavery of the working man has
been abolished in at least one shop
in the Corporation Yards. This state
ment is not one of mere socialistic op
timism. but one subject to immediate
proof.
The evidence hangs in the first shop
to the left after the office. "Notice. No
work done in this shop without per
mission."
