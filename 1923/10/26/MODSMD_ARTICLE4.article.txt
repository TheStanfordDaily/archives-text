# SCORELESS TIE ENDS BABE-JUNIOR CLASH
## 
### 
A scoreless tie opened the interclass
football series yesterday afternoon, when
the weight and experience of the junior
eleven proved an exact match for the
slightly superior organization of the third
string freshman team, leaving the score
keeper with nothing to do.
As far as inter-class struggles go, the
affair was quite interesting—an unexpect
ed punch being displayed by the third
year men whereas pre-war predictions
gave the freshmen the benefit of the
doubt.
Like many teams with good material
but comparatively little practice, the up
perclassmen began several threatening
advances to the 1927 goal in good order,
but each time lost ground by the fum
bles or ignorance of signals. Skirting
the babe end, however, proved success
ful, and good gains were made by the
fast' backfield with a mediocre inter
ference.
The yearlings, on the other hand,
lacked the necessary punch. They began
by testing the junior line with bucks and
off-tackle smashes but as the third-year
wall was heavy and nearly impregnable,
they shifted the attack early in the game
to end runs and aerial plays with slightly
more success.
"Dutch" McAllister, embryo yell leader,
substituted a well-trained toe for his
windmill arms and gave an exhibition
of excellent punting when called upon.
Newkirk and Reese for the freshmen re
turned the favors for good yardage.
With but seven seconds to play in the
first half, McAllister dropped back and
attempted a fifty yard goal kick, the ball
falling but a yard short and wide.
In the passing department, the year
lings showed to their best advantage,
completing five passes for long gains.
Nothing of this kind was attempted by
the juniors.
Early in the struggle, Coaches Mixon
and Sproul began a wholesale substitu
tion of babes; nearly every man who
missed the U. S. C. jaunt with the first
string, in fact', being given a chance to
open holes in the junior forward line or
skirt her fast pair of ends.
The beginning lineup was:
JUNIORS— FRESHMEN—

Draper LTR Hayden
McKenzie v LCR Johnson
Myers C Wentz
Jergins RGL McAllister
