# EDDIE LAMB CHIEF OF TRUCK COMPANY IN SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
Stanford, like Sheba, is shorn of
her chief glory, and Lamb, verbose
and capable protector of the mythi
cal "fire hazard," which has noth
ing to do with a golf course, has
removed back to the city, and is
captain of a fire truck company
across the street from the Orpheum
theatre.
Lamb appreciates news from the
campus, and in return may be per
suaded to speak guardedly for a
few seconds on whatever topic hap
pens to be uppermost in his mind.
Upon learning of the golf-trou craze
the other day he walked over to a
hose-truck, bit a 42-inch tire in two
pieces, and gracefully fainted.
