# DISADVANTAGES OF NEWSPAPER WRITING RELATED BY HUGHES
## "Let Andy Kerr Run Football Team," Says Chronicle Sports Scribe 
### 
Stressing the disadvantages of a
journalistic career, especially with re
ference to the field of sports, Ed. R.
Hughes, sports writer for the San
Prancisco Chronicle, in his informal
talk to the American Journalists as
sociation at the .Alpha Tau Omega
house last night, advised all prospec
tive journalists to consider seriously
the demands of the profession before I
making it their life work.
Early editions ruin the disposition j
and impair the digestion, according to
Hughes, and are the source of much
evil in newspaper work so far as the
personal comfort of the reporter is
concerned.
"Let Andy Kerr Run Team"
Hughes' advice to campus correspon
dents was not to try to run the foot
ball team, but to let Andy Kerr man
age the team and Paul Davis the busi
ness department. Uncovering matters
of personal interest concerning the
football players is also advisable. He
deplored the fact that so many sports
writers do not know the game thor
oughly, and disapproved of the use of
vague terms when referring to speci
fic teams instead of using the correct
names. He also warned writers not to
try to "get funny" with the public as
the effort never is appreciated.
Discusses Morning Editions
In explaining the difficulty in get
ting sport news for morning editions,
Hughes stated that the Associated
Press dispatches cannot be used by
the morning papers since the after
noon papers have a monopoly up to a
certain hour in the evening. He cited
the instance of the $30 expended each
day for telegraphic service to cover
the recent baseball games when the
Oaks were away and the Seals were
at home.
Hughes stated that he considered
football so highly organized that it is
difficult to watch intelligently. In
forming his opinions of the relative
strength of various squads, he does
not believe that anything can be de
termined by watching secret practice.
"I want to see the team on the field
before I draw any conclusions," he
said.
"I prefer amateur sports to profes
sional. I always look forward to the
football season. Football is a wonder
ful game to write about and speculate
on. No one can prove you are wrong,
and your guess is as good as the other
fellow's."

Hughes stated that the Associated
Press dispatches cannot be used by
the morning papers since the after
noon papers have a monopoly up to a
certain hour in the evening. He cited
the instance of the $30 expended each
day for telegraphic service to cover
the recent baseball games when the
Oaks were away and the Seals were
at home.
Hughes stated that he considered
football so highly organized that it is
difficult to watch intelligently. In
forming his opinions of the relative
strength of various squads, he does
not believe that anything can be de
termined by watching secret practice.
"I want to see the team on the field
before I draw any conclusions," he
said.
"I prefer amateur sports to profes
sional. I always look forward to the
football season. Football is a wonder
ful game to write about and speculate
on. No one can prove you are wrong,
and your guess is as good as the other
fellow's."
