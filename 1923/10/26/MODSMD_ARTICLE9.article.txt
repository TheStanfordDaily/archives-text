# SHAW IS RICH IN THOUGHT
## 'Androcles' Created to Entertain Audiences While Stimulating Argument 
### 
Shaw is one of the few dramatists who
has written plays that are at once popu
lar and thoughtful. A Shaw play is
really a dramatic essay, a treatment of
this type of subject matter in such a
way as to amuse all kinds of theater
goers. There is enough on the surface
of such drama as "You Never Can Tell,'
and "Androcles and the Lion" to amuse
people who wish nothing but pure en
tertainment ; and yet there is sufficient
meaning behind the lines to engage the
most profound thinkers.

George Bernard Shaw is in heart an
essayist. The essay has been for many
generations an unpopular, and hence an
uninfluencial form of literature with the
masses of the people Shaw has been
keen cough to realize that to stimulate
public thought in both the legitimate
essay and the profound drama have
failed; and he has written with the in
tention of amusing in order to gain au
diences. and at the same time to present
material for thought. "Androcles and
the Lion" is an example of one of Shaw's
most successful attempts. The surface
is in itself amusing enough to entertain
anyone; and tlic satire on the practice of
Christianity is the thoughtful subject.

The second-act set of "Androcles" has

been constructed and is now in use. It
is one of the heaviest ever built on the
Assembly liall stage. It is an attempt at
the recreation of the Roman coliseum.
Hilly Fitzluigh, the plump and bluster
ing squire of Ram's Head's "Knightie
Knight," is running "Hock" Chalmers a
close second as a laugh-gatherer. His
burlesque of the hard-boiled Roman cen
turian will bring tears to the eyes of the
legion !>oys who were acquainted with the
A. E. F. drill sergeants.

It is a tradition in Stanford dramatics
that the last rehearsal should run off like:
I a nightmare if the play is to be a suc
cess. Yesterday Coach Davis was wild
about his show; last night it nearly drove
him wild. If this rotation keeps up prop
i erlv, the campus is due to see something
I good on week from tonight.
