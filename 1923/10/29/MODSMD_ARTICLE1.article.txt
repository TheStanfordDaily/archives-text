# STANFORD HOLDS U.S.C. BABES TO 10-0 SCORE AS LINEMEN STAR
## Trojan Fumbles Prevent More Scoring 
### 
Upsetting the dope as completely as
did their elder brothers, the Trojan
yearlings failed to display their touted
superiority in the Los Angeles Coli
seum Saturday and demolished the
Stanford 1927 team by the surprising
ly small score of 10 to 0. The Cardinal
line took a decided brace whenever
the ball was carried dangerously >
close, and the southern backs fum
bled disastrously within the 5 yard
line.
The kid Cards looked dangerous for
a few minutes after the opening
whistle, when "Dick" Hyland broke
around left end for 55 yards from a
punt formation. He was dropped on
the U. S. C. 21 yard line, and attempts
through the forward wall failed to
gain. Hyland then tried a place-kick
from the 18 yard line, but it went wide.
At no other time did the Redshirts
come close to scoring.
The first Trojan score came in the
first period. The Stanford line stif
fened in mid-field, and on fourth down
"Bob" Lee sent a pretty drop-kick from
the 48 yard marked. This precarious
3 point lead kept both teams at top
speed, and the Card babes furnished
enough opposition to keep the game
plenty interesting.
In the fourth quarter the Tx-ojans'
carried the ball steadily down the field,
aud a pass from Laranetta to Badgro
put it on the Stanford 3 yard line.
Laranetta carried on across the goal j
for the only touchdown of the game,
and Lee converted.
The U. S. C. first-year men had
things almost their own way through
out most of the game, but encoun-.
tered considerable opposition when
line-bucks meant touchdowns. Stan
ford's line-men played an erratic
game, but usually managed to hold in
a pinch. Most of the fumbles were due
to terrific tackling on the part of the i
Cardinals, but tlie babes were unable
to take advantage of the breaks. "Ted"
Shipkey and Fred Swan broke up play
after play on the line, and Hyland car
ried most of the burden in the back
field.

from the 18 yard line, but it went wide.
At no other time did the Redshirts
come close to scoring.
The first Trojan score came in the
first period. The Stanford line stif
fened in mid-field, and on fourth down
"Bob" Lee sent a pretty drop-kick from
the 48 yard marked. This precarious
3 point lead kept both teams at top
speed, and the Card babes furnished
enough opposition to keep the game
plenty interesting.
In the fourth quarter the Tx-ojans'
carried the ball steadily down the field,
aud a pass from Laranetta to Badgro
put it on the Stanford 3 yard line.
Laranetta carried on across the goal j
for the only touchdown of the game,
and Lee converted.
The U. S. C. first-year men had
things almost their own way through
out most of the game, but encoun-.
tered considerable opposition when
line-bucks meant touchdowns. Stan
ford's line-men played an erratic
game, but usually managed to hold in
a pinch. Most of the fumbles were due
to terrific tackling on the part of the i
Cardinals, but tlie babes were unable
to take advantage of the breaks. "Ted"
Shipkey and Fred Swan broke up play
after play on the line, and Hyland car
ried most of the burden in the back
field.

Upsetting the dope as completely as
did their elder brothers, the Trojan
yearlings failed to display their touted
superiority in the Los Angeles Coli
seum Saturday and demolished the
Stanford 1927 team by the surprising
ly small score of 10 to 0. The Cardinal
line took a decided brace whenever
the ball was carried dangerously >
close, and the southern backs fum
bled disastrously within the 5 yard
line.
The kid Cards looked dangerous for
a few minutes after the opening
whistle, when "Dick" Hyland broke
around left end for 55 yards from a
punt formation. He was dropped on
the U. S. C. 21 yard line, and attempts
through the forward wall failed to
gain. Hyland then tried a place-kick
from the 18 yard line, but it went wide.
