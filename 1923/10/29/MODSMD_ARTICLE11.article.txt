# Hole-in-One Club Formed With Rau As First Member
## 
### 
Stanford has a new society. No, it j
isn't a tiddly-wink club, nor even a
new sorority. Nothing like that, but
something that only those favored by j
the great God of Fortune can become
eligible for. Its name is the "Hole In
One Club," and its membership is
made up of the select few who are
fortunate enough to sink a tee shot.
So far, membership consists of Tom
Rau, the charter member, president,'
and brothers. According to Reg
Hirschman, captain of the golf team, i
no other student at Stanford has made
a hole in one while attending the in-;
stitution.
It all came about on the ninth hole
at the Menlo Country Club. Rau had j
a start on the grand army game—out J
in 61 and back in 65, and was begin-1
ning to think that he was a better
lawn mower than golfer, when zowee,
it happened, and the world was a good
place to live in once more. He had
made a hole in one!
