# TROJANS TRAMPLE CARDS 14 TO 7 IN CONFERENCE GAME
## FOUR BLOCKED PUNTS YIELD TWO TOUCHDOWNS Stanford Eleven Fails to Uncover New Plays As Southern Team Takes Offensive In Second Period of Contest 
### William Wright 
Stanford's first real football test of the year, Stanford's punt-blocking spe
cialty turned against her by the University of Southern California, and Stan
ford's failure by a 14-to-7 score!
Cold, cruel, matter-of-fact language puts it that way. Influenced by Cardinal
partisanship, one might say that Stanford's single touchdown was earned, but
the score usually tells who wins, and U. S. C. did it, against odds. Stanford
played offensive football during the first quarter and a part of the second,

encountered. The passing game fell
down considerably, six passes being
completed for an average of slightly
over 5 yards to the toss. Both teams
gained principally through the line,
with the Trojans totaling 129 yards
and Stanford trailing with 108. Both
outfits punted for an average of 46
yards, with four of Nevers' boots
blocked to the detriment of his dis
tance record for the game.
Stanford's first tough break came in
the first few minutes of piay, when
Murray, receiving a pass from Cleave
land, was brought down one yard short
of the U. S. C. goal line. The ball
