# TROJANS TRAMPLE CARDS 14 TO 7 IN CONFERENCE GAME
## FOUR BLOCKED PUNTS YIELD TWO TOUCHDOWNS Stanford Eleven Fails to Uncover New Plays As Southern Team Takes Offensive In Second Period of Contest 
### William Wright 
Stanford's first real football test of the year, Stanford's punt-blocking spe
cialty turned against her by the University of Southern California, and Stan
ford's failure by a 14-to-7 score!
Cold, cruel, matter-of-fact language puts it that way. Influenced by Cardinal
partisanship, one might say that Stanford's single touchdown was earned, but
the score usually tells who wins, and U. S. C. did it, against odds. Stanford
played offensive football during the first quarter and a part of the second,
and then returned to the old die-dog-or-eat-the-meat-axe desperation that has
sickened Redshirt rooters for a couple of years.
The Stanford team played through the game with comparatively few substi
tutions, and practically every man was "out" on his feet shortly after the
beginning of the second half. The Trojans recovered confidence fast after
their first touchdown, and the psychological reaction kept their strength at

•top speed throughout the match.
Though the Cards scored 8 first downs
against 7 for the Southerners, the Tro
jans waited for a chance to make the
breaks, made them, and then won on
them.
Card supporters received a shock
when the Stanford team failed utterly
to display anything new, and relied
upon the same four or five plays used
against the minor colleges previously
encountered. The passing game fell
down considerably, six passes being
completed for an average of slightly
over 5 yards to the toss. Both teams
gained principally through the line,
with the Trojans totaling 129 yards
and Stanford trailing with 108. Both
outfits punted for an average of 46
yards, with four of Nevers' boots
blocked to the detriment of his dis
tance record for the game.
Stanford's first tough break came in
the first few minutes of piay, when
Murray, receiving a pass from Cleave
land, was brought down one yard short
of the U. S. C. goal line. The ball
went on downs, Stanford was turned
back, and Otto Anderson kicked out
of danger. An interchange of punts,
with Stanford gaining largely through
"Scotchy" Campbell's returns of Gor
don Campbell's kicks, and Murray,
Cleaveland, and Nevers again brought
the ball to the U. S. C.1 yard line.
Just after the beginning of the second
period Murray carried the ball around
left end and over the goal, and Cudde
back, who had just replaced Cleave
ißßd, converted for Stanford's total of
? points.
From this play Stanford seemed to
voluntarily assume the defensive. The
Trojans suddenly realized that the
Card line was not invulnerable, and
Cummings proved this by blocking a
punt, recovering the ball himself on
Stanford's 25 yard line. Gordon Camp
bell gained a yard through the line,
then two yards, a pair of passes were
smeared, and the ball went to Stan
ford on downs. Nevers made a yard,
then attempted a punt. Harold Adams
percolated through the Stanford for
ward wall and bounced the ball off his
chest. Holly Adams followed the pig
skin across the Stanford goal and fell
on it. Hawkins registered the try-for
point, and the score was tied at 7 each
way.
Very little was accomplished until
the end of the half. The Trojans made
yardage once, but most of the time
was burned up in punting, with the
ball usually in Stanford territory. A
Stanford fumble gave U. S. C. the ball
well within the Stanford danger zone,
but the Card defensive stiffened, as
usual, and the second period ended
without further damage.
The Los Angeles team came back
after the whistle with another offen
sive spurt, which ended when Hawkins
failed at a kick from placement. A few
punts, and Norman Anderson blocked
a third kick on Nevers. Otto Anderson
recovered on Stanford's 35 yard
marker. U. S. C. tried the line three
times with small success, and Hawkins
again missed the goal-posts on a kick
from placement.
Another exchange of punts, coupled
with Ineffectiveness of both teams
through the line, put Nevers on his
own 20 yard line, attempting a punt.
Again Norman Anderson sifted
through the Cardinal line and blocked
the kick. Holly Adams picked up the
ball on a bounce and covered the in
tervening 20 yards without difficulty.
Hawkins converted, and Stanford was
in the hole, 14 to 7.
The Cards picked up slightly during
the rest of the game, and made three
first downs to one for the Trojans.
The punch was lacking, however, and
every Stanford advance was broken
up by an intercepted forward pass be
fore the Cards had a chance to become
dangerous. Dorsey attempted a drop
kick for U. S. C. but it fell short. The
game ended as the Southerners made
a 10 yard dash around right end.
