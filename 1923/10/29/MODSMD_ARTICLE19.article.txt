# SENIOR INTERCLASS ELEVEN DOWNS '26 GRID MEN, 13 TO 6
## Sophomores Score on 80 Yard Run in 12 Seconds, But Lose on Fumbles 
### 
An eighty-yard run by Morgan for
a touchdown opened the sophomore
senior interclass football game Satur
day morning, giving the former a lead
of 7 to 0 twelve seconds after the
opening whistle.
This lead of seven digits was the
only source of satisfaction to the
sophomores, however, for the seniors
later crossed their line for a touch
down and passed them with another
near the end of the struggle, ending
the game 13 to 7 with the sponsor ag
gregation on the large end of the
score.
Following the second-year run and
score, the seniors attempted to even
the count by straight football and a
series of line bucks but the heavy
sophomore line was firm and an ex
change of punts followed.
It was at this point that the first six
points were added to the senior side
of the scoreboard. Being held for
downs they punted and a sophomore
back reached for the pigskin, fumbled,'
allowed it to bounce over his own
goal-line—and a senior end pounced
upon it for a score.
The forward wall of the seniors was
outweighed by the opposing line and
was unable to open holes for offense,
necessitating the use of numerous
short passes by the senior backfield.
Four out of eight of these aerial at
tempts were successful during the first
two periods, and one out of two in the
second half. A fake punt also netted
them ten yards.
A chance to score was lost by the
upperclassmen in the fourth quarter
when they were held for downs on
the sophomore two-yard line. When
the latter were forced to punt under
their own goal posts, however, the sen
iors ran back the punt for good yard
age and with end runs and a pass for
ten yards, scored, making a total of
thirteen counts to their credit.
