# NEW REQUIREMENTS MADE FOR ENTRANCE TO LEGAL COURSES
## School to Admit Only Law Majors; 90 Units Set For Minimum 
### 
On account of the great increase in the!
number of students seeking admission toj
the Stanford Law School classes and in
accordance with the University's fixed j
policy to keep enrollment down to a point i
at which the highest grade of instruction
tnay be maintained, the faculty of the
law school announced that additional re
quirements for admission will go into ef
fect next quarter and that hereafter only
students whose major subject is law will
be admitted to the first-year professional
courses.
The regulations that go into effect
January are as follows:
First, 90 units of academic work will
be required. Second, enrollment in first]
year professional law classes will be re-1
stricted to major students in law. Third,
to be accepted as law majors undergrad
uate students must have made a minimum
grade point record of 1.1 in their entire!
previous college course. Undergraduate
transfers from other universities will be j
subject tn an equivalent requirement. For:
Stanford undergraduates this means that!
an average record higher that a minimum
"C" will be required.
"These limitations are rendered neces- i
sary by the great increase in the number j
of students seeking admission to law
classes," says Dean M. R. Kirkwood of
the Law School. "The number now en
rolled is so .great as to overtax the
facilities of the school. It is felt that the
first duty of the school is to professional
students and among such to those best
prepared to profit by instruction. For
these reasons the new requirements are
placed on a professional and scholarship
basis. It is the purpose of the school to
raise the scholarship requirements for
admission as rapidly as may be necessary
to keep the number of students enrolled
at a proper maximum for the most effi
cient instruction.
"It will be noticed that the exclusion
of students majoring in other departments
relates only to first-year courses. As
heretofore, the school will accommodate
advanced non-professional students who
arc qualified by the character of the work
they have done in their own fields to do
work in second and third-year law sub
jects. This relates particularly to work
in the field of public law. For students
desiring law for purposes of business
only, the Law School will continue to
give an extended non-professional course
in Business Law."

Another of the traditional under
class clashes at Cornell goes by the
board this year. By action of the Stu
dent Council there will be no rush be
tween the freshmen and the sopho
mores.
