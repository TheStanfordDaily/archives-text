# Facing Forward
## 
### 
Two men were climbing a mountain peak. It
was late in the day, the sun was hot, and both were
toiling slowly as they clambered up the rocks. The
top was plainly in sight, not more than half a mile.
They worked around a shoulder, jutting from the
peak, and saw raised up before them a pathless
granite cliff of broken, crumbling stone. One of
the climl>ers sank onto a rock, moaned to himself,
and said:
"Aw—this is too much! We've worked all day,
and here we meet this thing, on the hardest part of
the climb. Let's go back."
The other looked at him. Then he looked at the.
cliff, a grim and solid fact. Then he grinned.
"See that cliff?" he said. "That's a challenge, put
there to see if we have nerve enough to be counted
among those who reached the top. Those rocks <
are a dare to us to go ahead, not a set-back. Let's
Iff
go!
When the two men built their fire on the summit,
they realized that obstacles and disappointments are
placed in the way only to train one for more perfect
enjoyment of the final success.
To those confident of victory a wall across the
path only adds momentum to the onward sweep.

Stanford men who saw the team fighting back in
the last quarter, gaining ground toward the U. S. C.
goal only to lose the ball on intercepted passes, are
just as confident as ever before in their belief that
the Campanile is plainly in sight, ready to be con
quered.
