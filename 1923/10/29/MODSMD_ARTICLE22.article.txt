After the ceremonies were ended on the field
Saturday, the U. S. C. yell-leader walked over to
the Cardinal bleachers and said to a Stanford man:
"Your rooting section is the best I ever heard. I
wish I had one with that spirit—l never saw such
support of a team that wasn't on top."
Perhaps the Trojan yell-leader knew one of the
reasons for that united front—the Stanford spirit
which won't admit defeat. But what he didn't
know was that the rooters gave better support to
the Stanford yell-leader and stood firmer behind the
Stanford team than they have for three years.

At a rehearsal the other night one of the disciples
of Androcles insisted on giving his speeches me
chanically. He then slipped out of character and
became a pre-occupied gent in cords. As he exited
into the wings, after making, the director verbally
apoplectic, he was heard to mutter: "plaintiff then
alleged that defendant had failed to register the*
lease, whereas umphumphumph
There is only one thing less appropriate, and that
is to see the actor walk in on the examination next
morning, muttering: "Nay, good Androcles, blah
blahblah "

A graduated engineer stood on the Quad talking
to some of his old friends. "Yessir, that man is a
great musician," he said. "They are charging five
dollars to hear him in the city now.
"I wish I could have gone to his concert on the
campus last year. But you see, I was a rough, and
I was afraid the guys would razz me for it."

If it weren't for the fact that the campus is made
up of a number of comparatively small puddles, half
the large frogs in the student body wouldn't bother
to take part in undergraduate activity.

It is reasonable to suppose that no more moths are
flying at midnight than at any other time. But be
fore that hour one is so busy fending off people who
want to interrupt study to hold a bull session that
other insects pass unnoticed.
