# WHAT JOLLY-UP?

### 
Fortunately there are, and probably will continue
indefinitely to be, newspaper columns wherein various
individuals with surplus energy and a grievance may
work off one to the nourishment of the other. Otherwise
some of these windy~personages™ might have to go to
work, with which observation we arrive at the subject
of jolly-ups.
After three weeks of desultory and largely insulting
contributions to Stanford's already large list of imagi
native internal calamities and decays, Dr. Jekyll has at
last succeeded in making a constructive criticism. The
merits of this criticism are by no means guaranteed,
and will be touched upon later, but it is constructive,
and we congratulate! Strangely enough, however, it
seeks to improve the jolly-up—%possibly the only Stan
ford social institution which is 14 karat as it stands.
Dr. Jekyll avers that the jolly-up, as is, is "too much
like sheep-herding to accomplish anything like demo
cratic leavening or leveling." The application of the
term "leavening" is questionable, so its meaning in this
situation (if it has one) must be allowed to stand un
challenged. But "leveling!"
Dr. Jekyll has there opened up a question which, after
a little thought, puts his jolly-up argument completely
in the shade. Can Stanford be "leveled?" Concede that
it can, for the sake or argument. But should it be? Is it
healthy? Has it ever been done —anywhere, at any time,
by any social group? The good doctor opens this issue,
peers apprehensively within, and scuttles back to the
narrow and comparatively safe problem of the utter
deterioration of the Stanford jolly-up.
As a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong with the
jolly-up. It is attended by people who, probably, have
no wish to be "leveled," at least arbitrarily and by Dr.
Jekyll. The "hundreds of strangers" gather together
under the beams of the pavilion (which are unfortunate
enough to call forth anathema from the doctor, who pro
poses the beams of the moon in the Union court as
desirable substitutes) and they DO produce that happy
"get-together-even-if-you're-not-acquainted" spirit at
which Dr. Jekyll sneers with a sweeping gesture. Any
one capable of observance beyond the rims of his spec
tacles can see that. All that is necessary is to attend
a jolly-up, which, it would appear, the doctor has failed
to do.
The counter-proposal—a four-ringed circus to do away
with the "concentrated mob of unworthies" —is absurd
on the face of it. Four separate jolly-ups, four separate
orchestras, concentrated within the sound-range of a
well-bred society sneeze! The individual moans of the
orchestras would blend into a medley of sound capable
of tangling Irene Castle's feet in her hair-net, and quite
guaranteed to stand the callow college couple on its
beam-ends in a sea of conflicting and quadruple discord.
The moans of any organization footing the bill for four
distinct and mercenary orchestras would possibly drown
their combined wind-jamming, but would certainly not
be adaptable for dance-music.
To top all off, the "band of unworthies" would not be
dispensed with, but would only be divided so that their
acts of "unworthiness" would be vastly more conspicu
ous. Dr. Jekyll's plan filters down to a desire to be rid
of the Stanford man, rather than the jolly-up!

deterioration of the Stanford jolly-up.
As a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong with the
jolly-up. It is attended by people who, probably, have
no wish to be "leveled," at least arbitrarily and by Dr.
Jekyll. The "hundreds of strangers" gather together
under the beams of the pavilion (which are unfortunate
enough to call forth anathema from the doctor, who pro
poses the beams of the moon in the Union court as
desirable substitutes) and they DO produce that happy
"get-together-even-if-you're-not-acquainted" spirit at
which Dr. Jekyll sneers with a sweeping gesture. Any
one capable of observance beyond the rims of his spec
tacles can see that. All that is necessary is to attend
a jolly-up, which, it would appear, the doctor has failed
to do.
The counter-proposal—a four-ringed circus to do away
with the "concentrated mob of unworthies" —is absurd
on the face of it. Four separate jolly-ups, four separate
orchestras, concentrated within the sound-range of a
well-bred society sneeze! The individual moans of the
orchestras would blend into a medley of sound capable
of tangling Irene Castle's feet in her hair-net, and quite
guaranteed to stand the callow college couple on its
beam-ends in a sea of conflicting and quadruple discord.
The moans of any organization footing the bill for four
distinct and mercenary orchestras would possibly drown
their combined wind-jamming, but would certainly not
be adaptable for dance-music.
To top all off, the "band of unworthies" would not be
dispensed with, but would only be divided so that their
acts of "unworthiness" would be vastly more conspicu
ous. Dr. Jekyll's plan filters down to a desire to be rid
of the Stanford man, rather than the jolly-up!
—MR. HYDE.
Fortunately there are, and probably will continue
indefinitely to be, newspaper columns wherein various
individuals with surplus energy and a grievance may
work off one to the nourishment of the other. Otherwise
some of these windy~personages™ might have to go to
work, with which observation we arrive at the subject
of jolly-ups.
After three weeks of desultory and largely insulting
contributions to Stanford's already large list of imagi
native internal calamities and decays, Dr. Jekyll has at
last succeeded in making a constructive criticism. The
merits of this criticism are by no means guaranteed,
and will be touched upon later, but it is constructive,
and we congratulate! Strangely enough, however, it
seeks to improve the jolly-up—%possibly the only Stan
ford social institution which is 14 karat as it stands.
Dr. Jekyll avers that the jolly-up, as is, is "too much
like sheep-herding to accomplish anything like demo
cratic leavening or leveling." The application of the
term "leavening" is questionable, so its meaning in this
situation (if it has one) must be allowed to stand un
challenged. But "leveling!"
Dr. Jekyll has there opened up a question which, after
a little thought, puts his jolly-up argument completely
in the shade. Can Stanford be "leveled?" Concede that
it can, for the sake or argument. But should it be? Is it
healthy? Has it ever been done —anywhere, at any time,
by any social group? The good doctor opens this issue,
peers apprehensively within, and scuttles back to the
narrow and comparatively safe problem of the utter
deterioration of the Stanford jolly-up.
