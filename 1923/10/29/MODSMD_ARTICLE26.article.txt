SCIENCE AND RELIGION;
ROBLE SUNDAY NIGHT DINNERS
The recent discussion with refer
ence to the abolishing of Sunday night
suppers at Roble offers an illustra
tion of the eternal struggle between
material welfare and spiritual wel
fare or science vs. religion.
It seems that some of the women
argued they should have food Sunday
night, since an extra course of salad
at dinner would not last them until
Monday morning. They took the atti
tude that this was similar to eating
a large meal on Sunday to last the
rest of the week. The other faction
pointed out that food was a small item
in comparison to the spiritual en
lightenment of the people, as many
Roble women could attend Christian
Endeavor during the present dinner
hour, and above all the hashers could
go to church. The prophets of old
were in the habit of fasting when they
were on the point of discovering some
great spiritual truth, so it is possible
that if the inmates of Roble went to
church without any supper they might
discover anything, or something. One
never can tell!
It has been said that "Stanford is
a man's university." Men are generally
conceded to be more scientific than
spiritual, holding material welfare in
higher esteem than the spiritual. The
women seem to be partially converted
to the theories advanced by the men,
because the result, by an overwhelm
ing vote, shows that science won and
suppers still prevail.
So science goes up anothes rung in
the ladder of fame.

Princeton undergraduates, long
recognized as critics of the movies,
are soon to be known as producers
and actors. They are filming "Arthur
Penrose, or Cupid the Conqueror,"
which is a burlesque on Princeton un
dergraduate life.
