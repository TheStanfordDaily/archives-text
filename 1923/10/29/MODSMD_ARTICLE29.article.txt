"A pocket edition of the Big Game"
was the apt expression used by a student
to describe the bleacher spirit of the
game Saturday.
Early Friday afternoon ill? south
erners began to pour onto the campus and
they kept coming until by Saturday noon
it was hard to decide which were visitors
and which hosts. Over three sections of
the enemy's side of the stadium were
filled and a few Cardinal and Gold sym
pathizers were scattered through the
Stanford, where they frequently made
their presence known.
Five sections were packed with north
ern enthusiasts, eager to see the outcome
of the first real test of Stanford's
strength. Even after the game had be
gun and was well under way, the crowd
kept filling in empty seats, and dotting
new sections.
A feeling of intense suppressed excite
ment was evident before the game and
during the first and second quarters.
Yelling was spontaneous and enthusiastic
until the third quarter, when the rooters
sat tense and quiet, gripping their pro
grams. Every piece of luck for U. S. C.
was announced by their drummer with a
jubilant clash of symbols.
For the first time rooting caps and
stunts were seen at other than a Big
Game. Between halves, Stanford started
the demonstration with practice work in
changing a field of red to one of white,
finally forming a white "S" on a red
background. Songs and yells were fol
lowed by an exhibition of the U. S. C.
band in the field. Fifty men followed
their leader, skilfully manipulating his
baton. Their white suits made an effec
tive contrast with the green field.
After the final pistol shot had destroyed
all hopes of a last minute victory, Car
dinal supporters stoically watched the
U. S. C. serpentine and the triumphal
gathering before the Stanford rooting
section.
