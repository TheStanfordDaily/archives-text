# RUSSIAN ATHLETIC CLUB TRIMS BABES IN ONE-SIDED GAME
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team met defeat
at the hands of the Russian Athletic club
from San Francisco Saturday on the
varsity soccer field by a score of 5-0.
The frosh had not played together pre
viously and did not have a chance against
their older and more experienced oppo
nents.
Lew Forest was the bright light on
the freshman team. He took care of the
goal in a masterly fashion, and credit
must be given to him for holding the
score as low as it was. Time after time
he grabbed a fast one just as it was
going into the corner of the goal, and
kicked it a safe distance away.
Bailard, at center forward played a
good game, but was not given much help
by his mates on the forward line. The
Russians had little opposition when they
got the ball into Stanford territory, ibid
continually dribbled the ball past the babe
fullbacks without exerting themselves. It
was then forest's turn to do his stuff, and
most of the time he did, but only to
have the Russian forwards work the ball
to the goal again.
The freshmen showed flashes at times,
and with a little more experience should
develop into a good combination. Most
of the men are new at soccer.
The Russians scored once in the first
half, and did not repeat until the end of
the last period, when they shoved the ball
into the goal four times in rapid succes
sion. The freshmen had very few chances
to score.
