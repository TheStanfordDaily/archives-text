# Oakland Downed 23-0 by Third Yearlings
## 
### 
The third string freshman eleven
sent the Oakland High School gridders
back across the bay with a 23-0 trounc
ing in the preliminary to the Varsity-
U. 4 S. C. game Saturday. The frosh
presented a well-balanced team and
had the game well in hand at all times.
McDougall was the bright light on
the freshman team. He got away for
several long gains during the contest.
The most sensational of these came
at the close of the first half. The babe
back got the ball and started down
the field as the gun went off. He evad
ed the Oakland defense and hammered
through for a thirty-five yard gain,
ending by placing the ball behind the
Oakland goal line for a touchdown.
