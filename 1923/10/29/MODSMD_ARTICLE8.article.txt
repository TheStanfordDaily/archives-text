"It is a plain historic fact that the
teachings of Christ have elevated the
dignity of human nature, purified so
cial life, raised the standard of mar
riage, and lifted the status of women,"
said Dr. Gardner, in his sermon yester
day morning in the Memorial Church
on "The Christian Ideal of Marriage."
"Perhaps, first, we had better get
our definitions straight. A student said
not long ago: 'The Greeks had only
one wife, and that they called mono
tony.' The Christian rule of marriage
is the union of one man and one wo
man for life.
"English-speaking peoples are ro
manticists. We believe that the heart
of marriage is love, a spiritual quality
which helps good people to live for
one another. But love should not rob
us of our common sense. The first
requisite of a happy marriage is good
health.
''The second most important consid
eration in a happy marriage is this: a
man and a woman about to found a
home should have common intellectual
interests, because comradeship rests
upon intellectual equality."
Unity in religious belief should also
be considered, according to Dr. Gard
ner. A Christian woman should not
marry a pagan. The question of mar
riage between a Catholic and a Pro
testant is a grave question, for lack
of unity in religious belief is often a
cause of domestic unhappiness.
"I cannot deal with the economic
condition of marriage except to say
this: if people marry on faith and
hope thSy will probably end by living
on charity. But this does not mean
that it is necessary to wait for a for
tune before marriage."
