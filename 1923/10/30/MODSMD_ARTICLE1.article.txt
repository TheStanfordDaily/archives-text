# ROUGHS' DAY WILL BE STAGED UNDER COUNCIL RULINGS
## Senior Control Committee Decides That Modified Scheme Will Hold 
### 
Decision to have Roughs' Day this
year, to be held on November 22, two !
days before the Big Game, was made
at a meeting of the Senior Control
Committee yesterday noon in the Wo-,
men's Clubhouse.
Under the present plans undergradu-'
ates alone will participate; no stran
gers or women students are to be mo
lested; no women's costumes are to
lie worn; class attendance must be
kept inviolate; and activities must not
take place within the Quad or Univer-!
sity buildings.
Considerable agitation for making a
substitute for Roughs' Day has been
apparent on the campus, but the Sen
ior Control Committee was unanimous
in its decision to see the tradition pre
served as long as possible.
The decree of Men's Council is as
follows:
"Roughs' Day is a tradition of long
standing in the University and one
which we feel should be perpetuated.
In order that it survive as a tradition
and accomplish its original purpose
the following rules and - regulations
must, be adhered to:
"1. The activities of the day are to
be confined to the undergraduate men
of the student body. The utmost re
spect must be shown all visitors and
persons not connected with the stu
dent body, who are in no way to be
considered as participants.
"2. Members of the faculty must
also be shown due respect. Any at
tempt to force faculty members
through abuse or coercion to enter
into the spirit of the day will not be
tolerated.
"3. Women students must not be
annoyed in any way and dressing in
women's clothes will not be permitted.
The utmost courtesy and respect must
be shown them and any ridiculing or
abusive language or any ungentleman
ly actions will be severely dealt with.
"4. Class attendance must be kept
inviolate. Absences are not excused on
this day any more than on any other
day.
"5. The activities of the day must
not take place within the Quad or in
any of the University buildings. Noise
outside classrooms which interferes
with class work will not be tolerated.
"6. Property of the University or of
individuals must in no way be mo
lested or destroyed.
"7. As set forth in the constitution
of the Men's Council (Article 5, Sec
tion 1) it becomes the duty of the
Senior Class to see that Roughs' Day
is carried out in the proper and gen
tlemanly manner.
"Any infraction of the above regula
tions will subject the violators to dis
missal from the University upon the
recommendation of the Men's Coun
cil."
