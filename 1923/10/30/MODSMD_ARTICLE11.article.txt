## 
### 
Antonio de Grassi, violinist, Lucien
Cesaroni, basso, European artists, and
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
will give a joint musical recital in the
Memorial Church this evening at 7:30.
This concert is one of the regular
Tuesday lecture series.
Handel's "Sonata in E major" and
"Chaconne," by Bach, will be played
by de Grassi and Allen. Among Cesa
ronl's selections will be "Nature's
Praise of God," by Beethoven, and the
famous "Aria of the High Priest" from
Mozart's "Magic Flute."
Cesaroni is said to possess a voice
which lends itself perfectly to the
arias of Mozart. He has come to this
country from Australia, where he is
a member of the Australian Conserva
tory of Music. De Grassi has toured
the United States and Europe on the
concert stage, and is now giving violin
lessons in Berkeley.
