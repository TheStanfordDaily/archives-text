# STIFF SCHEDULE IS PROVIDED FOR CARD SOCCER PLAYERS
## Three Games Are Arranged For Varsity This Week; Babes Work Hard 
### 
Both the freshman and varsity soc
cer teams are hard at work preparing
for league games on Saturday. The
varsity has a hard week ahead, as it
has two practice games before Satur
day.
The Half Moon Bay high school will
meet the varsity Wednesday afternoon
on the soccer field. The high school
boys scrimmaged with the Cards last
week and held them to a scoreless tie.
Maloney hopes to turn the tables to
morrow and win.
On Friday the varsity will meet the
San Anselmo eleven from San Fran
cisco. This team represents a sectar
ian school in the city, and while it is
not a member of the University and
Club league, has played games with
the varsity in past years and given a
good account of itself.
The fifth league game comes Satur
day when the varsity tangles with the
Sons of Norway. At present Maloney's
charges have won two and lost two,
and in order to have a chance at the
pennant must win the remainder of
their games. The Sons of Norway are
reported to have a strong team, which
is fully capable of giving the varsity
some stiff competition.
Maloney feels that the men on the
varsity have found themselves at last,
and during the rest of the season will
chalk up more victories than defeats.
