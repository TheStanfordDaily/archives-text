### 
Complaint has been made that some
athletes are uniformed as to regulations
on wearing of awards. The Board of
Athletic Control is therefore making pub
lic the award rules of the Associated Stu
dents, as follows:
"Varsity sweaters awarded for the first
time must be cardinal in color and have
a white block "S" centered on the front.
Either V-neck or roll-neck may be or
dered. The standardized size for the let
ter will be 6 1 /2 by 9 inches.
"The second sweater in the same line
of sports may be either red as above or
white with a red *S\ the other to be worn
cither centered or on the left side. A
varsity 'S' medal may be taken for the
second award instead of a sweater.
"The man winning his third varsity 4 S'
in the same line of sport will be awarded
a cardinal blanket with a block 'S' and
three stars in the center.
