# COMPLAINTS MADE ABOUT WEARING OF ATHLETIC AWARDS
## 
### 
Complaint has been made that some
athletes are uniformed as to regulations
on wearing of awards. The Board of
Athletic Control is therefore making pub
lic the award rules of the Associated Stu
dents, as follows:
"Varsity sweaters awarded for the first
time must be cardinal in color and have
a white block "S" centered on the front.
Either V-neck or roll-neck may be or
dered. The standardized size for the let
ter will be 6 1 /2 by 9 inches.
"The second sweater in the same line
of sports may be either red as above or
white with a red *S\ the other to be worn
cither centered or on the left side. A
varsity 'S' medal may be taken for the
second award instead of a sweater.
"The man winning his third varsity 4 S'
in the same line of sport will be awarded
a cardinal blanket with a block 'S' and
three stars in the center.
"Freshman sweaters willjse similar to
the first varsity award (a red sweater
with a roll or V-neck). It will have
white intercollegiate block numerals cen
tered on the front of the sweater.
"Minor sports of the first class will
receive jerseys, red the first time and
white the second time. If winners of
awards desire they may add to the cost
of the jerseys enough to buy a sweater.
"For the minor sports of the second
class the emblem will be as at present.
No award of sweater or jersey will be
made but after the emblem is awarded it
may be sewn on a red sweater or jersey,
to be worn only in the center of the front
of same.
"All of the above will be awarded by
the executive committee and bought by
the sweater fund of the Board of Ath
letic Control.
"Interclass competition in varsity sports
to receive the complete class numbers
(1923, etc.) in small block numerals, to
be worn on the front of red jerseys only.
"No letters or insignia are to be worn
on the backs of sweater.
"A senior manager receives an award
of the sport letter with a bar below it."
