# Comedy Dominates Shaw Drama To Be Produced Friday Night
## 
### 
What would be the proper thing tOi
do if one were to he planted in the
center of the great Roman Coliseum
to await the arrival of a Lion? And
after the hungry King of Beasts had
heen turned loose and stood before
you wondering where to begin, how
would one meet the situation?
"Hock" Chalmers as Androcles an
swers the questions Friday night in
a way that will bring Caesar and the
rest of the Romans in the rooting sec
tion to their feet cheering, thumbs
held high in the air.
In the next scenes Androcles and
the Lion carry on a burlesque that
will keep the entire audience in an
uproar. Dignified Caesar running
around the stage closely pursued by
the Lion with Androcles hanging on
to his tail to prevent high treason is
the comic climax of the show.
Arnold Bailey will he seen in the
hit of his career as a Stanford come
dian when he appears as the Lion.
All his action has to be done on four
legs, which makes it all the more in
teresting when he tries to come down
stairs at full speed. Usually there
is a slip, a few bumps, and a bang as

Bailey lands in a heap on the floor. But
lie is up and going in an instant, tell
ing the emperor of the world what he
thinks of him in forceful lion language.
Shaw intended the play to be a
comedy but Bailey and Chalmers have
turned it into a howling farce. Kolb j
and Dill have nothing on them as a 1
laugh-producing comedy team.
