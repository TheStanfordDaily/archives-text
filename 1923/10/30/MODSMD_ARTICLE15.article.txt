## 
### 
Now is the time for all good men
and' true to come to the aid of the
varsity.
Which means that on Thursday eve
ning at 7 o'clock the second indoor
rally of the year will be staged in the
basketball pavilion, preliminary to the
Olympic Club game on Saturday.
As variety is popularly conceded to
be the spice of life, the coming event
will be highly seasoned, according to
Burt Lapp, yell leader, who is making
up the program. Following the policy
of the Rally Committee in providing
entertainment as well as work for the
rooters who turn out for the affair,
Lapp will use only a part of the eve
ning in rehearsing songs and yells.
Snappy amusement numbers, the exact
nature of which is being kept secret

"Stanford rooters proved Saturday
that they are solid in their support of
the football varsity," said Lapp today.
"There must be no slackening of that
support now. Stanford students have
been charged with admitting defeat in
advance. The best answer to that
charge will be found in the response
at Thursday's rally. No man or woman
who pretends to be a member of the
Stanford family will miss this chance
to show the team that we appreciate
their work and believe in their ability;
the spirit shown at the rally will have
a lot to do with the score in Satur
day's game.
"Stanford was defeated Saturday,
but we are not going into any twilight
zone for that reason. The season is
still in front of us, and what the result
of that season will be depends largely
on what the rooters are willing to
give in support of the players."
The program for the rally will be
announced tomorrow. As it can last
for only one hour, students are urged
to be at the pavilion promptly at 7
o'clock.
