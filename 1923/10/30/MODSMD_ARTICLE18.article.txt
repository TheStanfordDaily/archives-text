# CARD VARSITY FAILS TO EXHIBIT POWER EXPECTED BY KERR
## Nevers Not Wholly to Blame For Punts Blocked Saturday; Jim Lawson's Injuries Severe 
### David Meiklejohn 
It is a common saying in campus dramatic circles that if the dress
rehearsal of a play is particularly displeasing, the play the next evening will
be a success. This is because the principles have come to realize that they
are not all they have been cracked up to be. The Stanford varsity has had its
dress rehearsal, and it certainly was displeasing in the opinions of the football
critics and students. U. S. C. expected to lose, and the conduct of the Card
eleven in the first quarter of the game corroborated that belief.
The "play," of course, is the California game at Berkeley, November 24, and
now that the principles on the team have come to the realization that all is
not well, perhaps the dramatization will turn out to be a success for Stanford.
The team that let the Trojans walk all over, around, and through them was
not the team which Andy Kerr had expected to put on the field. It was not
the "real" eleven which alumni came miles to see. It was a sorry imitation.

No doubt but that the real eleven is
lurking somewhere in the background,
but it waited too long last Saturday to
put in an appearance.
Many are wondering, perhaps, if all
the blame is due Ernie Nevers, be
cause he failed to get his kicks off in
time. It was partly Ernie's fault to
ward the last of the game, but the
first blocked kick was the fault of the
"System." That is, on every kick for
mation U. S. C. would shift two men
to the flank of the line, and the Stan
ford men, playing their own game,
failed to shift accordingly, with the
result that two Trojans were always
bearing down on the kicker with only
one halfback to ward them off. In the
second half the line shifted, but still
U. S. C. players poured through. This
was indisputably the fault of the Card
defense.
Why this should have been is not
altogether clear. It was not due to a
weight advantage. The Stanford line
was as heavy if not heavier than the
Trojan. Something needs shifting on
the Card defense, that is sure.
Yesterday afternoon Andy Kerr gave
his first string varsity men a rest.
With the exception of "Scotchy"
Campbell only the second varsity
players were on the field.
Jim Lawson's injuries are severe.
The big Cardinal end will probably be
kept out of the line-up for some time
to come, due to torn muscles in the
ribs, adomen, and spine. Whether he
will be able to play in the California
game is still in doubt, but it is proba
ble that he may recover in time to
enter the classic contest on November
24.
