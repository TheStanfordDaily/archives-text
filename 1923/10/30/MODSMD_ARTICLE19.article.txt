# TRIANGULAR DEBATE DATE IS POSTPONED
## 
### 
The triangular debate with U. S. C.
and California which was to have taken
place during November, has been post
poned until January 24 at the request of
U. S. C. The southerners felt that the
November date did not give them suffi
cient time in which to prepare for the
contest.
"Resolved, That California criminal
syndicalism laws should be repealed," is
the subject for debate.
