An alumnus popped onto the campus yesterday
from Wisconsin, where he had been buried for three
years in the office of a grain corporation. He had
not seen the Farm since graduation, and had heard
only occasional news of happenings on the campus
after leaving. He looked at all the buildings, saw
the new plan for housing of freshmen, saw the foot
ball team in practice and thought of the loose-knit
outfit he had to watch when he was sitting in the
bleachers. Then he said: "Why Stanford is
going ahead so fast I can't keep up."
That alumnus will go back to Milwaukee with
the wonder of it in his mind, coupled with the
knowledge that men on the Farm today are in the
midst of things which were nothing but a hazy
dream when he was cutting his eight o'clocks.
Three years ago Encina was bulging at the walls
with the load of holding three in a room, and the
inmates were taking treatments for earache because
of the noise ensuing. Every day one heard on the
Quad some loose-lipped sophomore sing out: "Hey,
frosh! Go back and get my coat." At noon there
was a line extending almost to the Quad trying to
get into the Inn and eat some second-hand mashed
potatoes; for those with more delicate tastes, Count
Tagawa would serve watered soup to patrons of the
Union. Between the Union and the Women's Club
house, by the way, there was a most estimable vacant
lot, capable of filling up the toughest wool socks
with stickers in something under sixty seconds.
Those who went to football games were rapidly
carrying away the old and crumbling bleachers in
the seats of their respective trousers.
That was Stanford three years ago. No wonder
the Wisconsin alumnus thought it a poor idea to go
over to the R. O. T. C. headquarters for lunch.
