# Enthusiasm

### 
There are some qualities in the internal mechan
ism of human beings, which in combination, pro
duce a violent chemical reaction similar to that of
phosphorus and potassimu chlorate. When they meet
in two different individuals, there is often a fight,
as has been seen too much in the reaction of inde
pendence to assumed superiority. Combined under
the same skin, these two qualities fit one for the
rock-pile.
Many people are sustained by a calm and rugged
faith in some ideal, a sincere belief that what they
want will triumph, and go about with little interest
in the vicissitudes of everyday life because they
have an undertaker's certainty that their ends will
eventually be achieved.
Other citizens of the campus are continually on
the dead run, beating about and caroming off the
calm ones. They are full of energy, ready for any
thing, but they have no definite conception of what
they are ready for.
When these two qualities of energy and belief arc
combined in one individual, the result is Enthusiasm.
Organizations are run, A grades are made, football
games are won, by the presence of this quality. The
leaders of all the large and small groups that run
their meeting notices in the Announcement column
are more or less charged with this kind of spark.
A man so endowed has often been known to move
mountains, when there was something underneath
that he wanted. ,
