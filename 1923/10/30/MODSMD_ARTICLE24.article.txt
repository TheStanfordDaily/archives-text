# ALL ABOUT JOLLY-UPS
## 
### 
Jolly-Ups are given by Skull and Snakes. At least
there are always a mess of Snakes there, and here and
there a skull or two. The women go by themselves.
The only trouble is that after they get there they don't
stay by themselves. The men go by themselves, too,
and by the Brewery, too, mostly.
The other day the editor of the Daily ran a definition
of Jolly-Ups in which he said that it was a place where
guys with logging-camp ideals went. What do they do
when they go back to the logging camps, where Jolly-
Ups are almost unknown? How did they find out that
Jolly-Ups were where they wanted to go? Just imagine
a man from a logging-camp wandering into a movie.
Pretty soon he'd shake his head, sort of sadly, and
whisper softly to the gent next to him that this here
wasn't the place, stranger, no sir, it wasn't.
Then you can imagine him going into Sticky's, and
leaving a choc-malt half finished, just plumb listless.
A choc-malt wasn't the thing, either. He might try a
couple of games of pool, but that would be it, either.
But finally he would go out to the Campus, and lo and
behold there would be a Jolly-Up going on. Well, sir,
that would be just the thing. Maybe the first couple of
dances, before he found out that it was a Jolly-Up, he
wouldn't feel at home; but as soon as he found out that
at last he had found a real, dyed-in-the-wool, eighteen
carat, pre-war-bottled-in-bond Jolly-Up, this Logging
Camp Idealist would heave a sigh of real genuine joy
and write to the Los Angeles Examiner about it.
Just think what a blow it is going to be for the logging
companies when their men find out about Jolly-Ups.
Every time they read the Daily up there in a cold, frozen
logging camp—every single time—everybody will quit
work and take the first Pullman to Palo Alto, and the
lumber industry will be left flat on its back. We're
going to have to watch up this Jolly-Up thing. —N. E.

One day in 1912 a man got a bright idea.
He sent in a story to a humorous paper.
The story was about a man who lost all
his belongings in a cyclone, and when the
cyclone was over, bundled up the remains
of a tin roof and four wagon wheels and
sent the outfit back to the Ford factory
with a request that they repair his Ford,
and got back a bill for $48.29 and a note
asking what in hell hit him.
Well, that wasn't such a bad Ford joke
as Ford jokes went in those days, but the
other day that same man happened to leave
his Ford in front of his store and a safe fell
out of an eighteenth story window and lit on
the Ford and when the man sent the Ford
in to the factory to be fixed he got the Ford
back again with a note saying to put the
damn thing back on the roof and not try to
be smart about it as the Ford Company had
been the butt of the jest too long.
That might not scan well enough to be
poetic justice, but it is at least blank verse
justice. —N. E.
