# Athletes Are Entitled to Bigger Hats
## 
### 
Numerous campus nonentities are prone to criticize
the egotism of college athletes. Egotists are not to be
scorned. Achievement is entitled to acclaim. If a man
doesn't value himself, no one else will. Only the defi
nite, well-characterized people who know and believe in
themselves accomplish things. What would this world
be if no one were aggressive? Says A. C. Benson: Meek,
humble persons who accept things as they are, who
tread the beaten paths, who are cautious, prudent, and
submissive, who belittle themselves in false modesty,
leave this world very much as they found it. —R. Mcß.

Are we getting anywhere?
Man is a faulty structure. His sins, his diseases, his
mistakes, his stupidities, his fading instincts, all pro
claim his inferiority. Behold the ape, risen above meat
eating to a perfect fruitarian diet and total abstinence.
His instincts are alert, his teeth are sound, and he is
immune from most diseases. In the sheep all our vices
and offences are gone. The sheep is practically sinless.
And high above the sheep is the oyster. He has con
quered pain. He has ascended out of the reach of all
passions, falsehood, uncharitableness, and discord.
Highest above all, strain your vision to that microcosm
which is at the vanishing point between life and death.
There the last enemy is overcome!
Stephen Paget.
