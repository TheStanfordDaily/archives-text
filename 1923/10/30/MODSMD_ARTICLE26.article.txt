THE DESTROYING ANGEL: Stanford Theatre, Palo
Alto, Monday.
There are advantages in going to a picture expecting
the very, very worst. Usually you have the satisfaction
of reminding someone that you had predicted just such
a catastrophe; again, if the picture is at all good, it is
such a relief that the whole thing stands out as a rosy
dream.
Well, "The Avenging Angel" is like that. We were
agreeably thrilled at the beginning, pleased at the mid
dle, and surprised at the good tone maintained until the
final clinch. Still, after a careful consideration of the
component parts of the picture, the result ought not to
be so surprising. It was scenariocd by Beulah Mary
Dix, written by Louis Joseph Vance, and acted by
Mitchell Lewis, Ford Stirling, John Bowers, and Noah
Beery. Everything else was done by Leah Baird, and
it is quite a credible job for a woman.
She and Ford Stirling lift the play from mediocrity,
with the aid of some good camera work.
THE UNTAMABLE, Varsity Theatre.
For an hour we have searched our vocabulary, that
of Mr. Webster, and that of Mr. George Ade, for words
to describe "The Untamable." And now we must give
up by quoting a passage from Webster: "Rotten —char-
acterized by decay; see rot." But, having just seen
"The Untamable," wo considered that advice superflu
ous. —H. M.
