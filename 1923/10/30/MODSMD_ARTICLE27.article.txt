# Under the Sun

### 
C. N. 11.
Weeks of preparation,
training, teaching,
learning, men paid to
know how. . . blood spent,
bodies exhausted, pages
of dope created and
avidly read. . . then
twenty-two men, fighting,
falling, smashing,
thinking, rushing at
each other like deadly
planets at a celestial
signal. . .
Football. And hundreds
of throats hoarsely
exhorting the twenty
two men to make a
leather ellipsoid cross
an arbitrary line. The
best animal-to-animal
game in captivity.
