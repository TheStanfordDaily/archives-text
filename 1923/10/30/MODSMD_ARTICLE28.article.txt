Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
When Stanford met the San Jose
State Teachers College on the foot
ball field October 20, she did more
than pile up a big score against a
minor opponent; she created an im
pression that is worth calling atten
tion to.
P. Victor Peterson, who teaches
chemistry and physics at the Teachers
College, and who came up with the
Teachers College boys Saturday, said
to me today:
"There is one thing I want to say
about that game. Our boys got more
than just a thorough drubbing from
Stanford. They got an illustration of
Stanford spirit that they will never
forget. The spirit Stanford showed
our boys Saturday was the best I have
ever seen at any institution in all the
time I have been interested in foot
ball.
"When our boys arrived in Palo Alto
there were four Stanford fellows at
the train to take their equipment to
the dressing rooms, two more to take
them over to Larkin's where they
found waiting for them as good a meal
as money could buy. At every turn of
the game it was the same —and that
sort of spirit makes a mighty fine im
pression on a visiting team.
"Of course Stanford profits by that
sort of thing but it was awfully good
for our boys, a fact which was proven
by the way they played. We sent in
only two substitutes and yet the boys
played just as hard at the last of the
game as they did at the beginning and
that they couldn't have done under
the terrific pounding they were re
ceiving if they hadn't been so im
pressed by the spirit shown by Stan
ford."
It is worth while calling attention to
comments of this sort, not that we
may become unduly impressed by the
magnitude of our own goodness, but
that we, as Stanford students, may
realize the sort of reputation Stanford
has made and which it is our duty and
privilege to maintain. It ought not to
be possible for anyone to say any
thing less worthy of Stanford, not only
in athletics but in any field.
Incidentally, I might say that the
San Jose Teachers College is itself
to be commended. Any institution that
has an enrollment of but fifteen hun
dred, of which nearly three-fourths
are women, is to be complimented for
having nerve enough to put any kind

of a team into the field, to say nothing
of tackling one of the strongest teams
on the coast.
Sincerely yours,
CARL D. DUNCAN.

than just a thorough drubbing from
Stanford. They got an illustration of
Stanford spirit that they will never
forget. The spirit Stanford showed
our boys Saturday was the best I have
ever seen at any institution in all the
time I have been interested in foot
ball.
"When our boys arrived in Palo Alto
there were four Stanford fellows at
the train to take their equipment to
the dressing rooms, two more to take
them over to Larkin's where they
found waiting for them as good a meal
as money could buy. At every turn of
the game it was the same —and that
sort of spirit makes a mighty fine im
pression on a visiting team.
"Of course Stanford profits by that
sort of thing but it was awfully good
for our boys, a fact which was proven
by the way they played. We sent in
only two substitutes and yet the boys
played just as hard at the last of the
game as they did at the beginning and
that they couldn't have done under
the terrific pounding they were re
ceiving if they hadn't been so im
pressed by the spirit shown by Stan
ford."
It is worth while calling attention to
comments of this sort, not that we
may become unduly impressed by the
magnitude of our own goodness, but
that we, as Stanford students, may
realize the sort of reputation Stanford
has made and which it is our duty and
privilege to maintain. It ought not to
be possible for anyone to say any
thing less worthy of Stanford, not only
in athletics but in any field.
Incidentally, I might say that the
San Jose Teachers College is itself
to be commended. Any institution that
has an enrollment of but fifteen hun
dred, of which nearly three-fourths
are women, is to be complimented for
having nerve enough to put any kind

of a team into the field, to say nothing
of tackling one of the strongest teams
on the coast.

Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
When Stanford met the San Jose
State Teachers College on the foot
ball field October 20, she did more
than pile up a big score against a
minor opponent; she created an im
pression that is worth calling atten
tion to.
P. Victor Peterson, who teaches
chemistry and physics at the Teachers
College, and who came up with the
Teachers College boys Saturday, said
to me today:
"There is one thing I want to say
about that game. Our boys got more
than just a thorough drubbing from
Stanford. They got an illustration of
Stanford spirit that they will never
forget. The spirit Stanford showed
our boys Saturday was the best I have
ever seen at any institution in all the
