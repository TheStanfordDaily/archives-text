# MALONEY TO ADDRESS SONS OF ST. GEORGE
## 
### 
Harry Maloney will give a talk on
athletics at a smoker being given by 1
the Sons of St. George in San Mateo i
a week from tomorrow evening. Fol-1
lowing his talk he will present several
of his boxers and fencers in exhibi- '
tion matches.
Jake Irwin, middleweight on last I
year's boxing team, will probably mix
it with Schall, a newcomer this year,
in one of the bouts. Both of these men
are better than the average college
boxer, and they have both been train
ing since college started, and will be
in good condition for their exhibition.
Murphy, a star lightweight, is slated
to start the other exhibition match.
An opponent has not been selected for
him as yet.
The Sons of St. George is an ath
letic club, and has a soccer team en
tered in the University and Club
league. This team met the Stanford
varsity two weeks ago, and succeeded
in winning after a gruelling battle.

Plate rails for steins and pewter
mugs are being constructed as decora
tions in the new Encina dining hall.
