# YELL LEADER FOR WOMEN'S CONTESTS CHOSEN BY W. A. A.
## 
### 
Loraine Cleaveland was chosen wo
men's yell leader at a meeting of Wo
men's Athletic board last evening. She
will also act as a member of the
board. Elizabeth Williams was selected
as freshman representative.
W. A. A. decided not to take part
in the Triangle Conference field day
at California which has been planned
for April; because, with the pageant
to prepare for, the teams will not have
sufficient time to train for an Inter
collegiate meet In the spring.
California women are planning to
take up crew in place of basketball
during winter quarter. If they do so
there will be no intercollegiate basket
ball competition here this year.
An amendment to the Stanford W.
A. A. constitution was proposed pro
viding that holdovers be allowed to
play in interclass competition. Tri
angle rules already allow holdovers to
play in intercolegiate games. Gradu
ates are eligible to play on class teams.
Two hockey teams (one upperclass
and one underclass) will meet Cali
fornia on November J7 here and the
other two will meet Mills November
24 at Mills. The teams to play Cali
fornia will be announced later. The
sophomores will probably be the
underclass team.
