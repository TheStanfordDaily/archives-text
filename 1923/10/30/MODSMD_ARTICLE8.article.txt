# CALIFORNIA POLY GRIDDERS TO PLAY BABES SATURDAY
## San Luis Obispo Eleven Has Good Record for Year; Freshmen Ready 
### 
When the California Polytechnic
School eleven, of San Luis Obispo,
comes to Stanford next Saturday to
tackle the 1927 gridders, they will find
a determined group of freshmen awaits
ing them. The sting of that 10>-0 defeat
by the U. S. C. babes must be re
venged, say the freshmen, so Cali
fornia Poly will be the first to feel
the vengeance.
California Poly has a good team this
year, and it has succeeded in rolling
up some big scores this season. Last
Saturday they sent San Jose Teachers
College from the field with the short
end of a 7-0 score. Comparing this
with the 79-0 score rolled up by the
Card first year men, it doesn't look
so good. But the 7-0 score doesn't de
scribe the game. The Polytechnic
eleven had the advantage from start
to finish, but handicapped themselves
with numerous fumbles and numerous
substitutions.
Last Saturday's defeat should only
put the Cardinal freshmen on edge for
the University of California babe game
two weeks from now. In place of over-
confidence, the freshmen will feel that
they must defeat the Berkeley eleven
to hold up their prestige.
While the Card babes were facing
odds against the U. S. C. Trojans Sat
urday, the Berkeley first year men
spent a pleasant afternoon and beat
Modesto Junior College 43-7. One fact
was brought out clearly in the game
â€”that California has no freshman
place-kicker that is worthy of the
name. Of the seven touchdowns scored
only one was converted for the extra
point.
