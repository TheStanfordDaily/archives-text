# HOUSING PROBLEM FOR QUARTER IS SOLVED SAYS DEAN
## 
### 
With ovÂ£r 1000 men students accom
modated in the four University dormi
tories, the campus housing situation for
the autumn quarter has been practically
solved, according to the report of Dean
of Men George B. Culver. Students on
the waiting list have all been admitted to
the halls or have found living quarters
elsewhere with the result that the short
age of rooms which was so keenly felt
at the opening of college has been ended.
At present 590 men are living in En
cina, 160 in Toyon, 150 in Sequoia, and
125 in the Union. With the completion
of Branner Hall 125 upper classmen will
be transferred from Encina and Sequoia.
However, it will be impossible to remove
all upper classmen from Encina and 100
of the latter will be housed on the fourth
and fifth floors. Hereafter all freshmen
not living with relatives or working for
their board will be assigned to rooms in
Encina. Although this was the plan for
this quarter the failure to complete Bran
ner Hall made it necessary to put 30
freshmen in Sequoia. These will remain
there for the rest of the year but in the
future Sequoia will be for the upper
classes only.
