DO YOU WANT TO
"Go Out for Something?''
As an underclassman—maybe you have
been looking for something to get into. Pre
vious managerial experience on your high
school paper is desirable, but it isn't neces
sary. If you're a "live wire," maybe you
would like to fill one of the two or three posi
tions yet open on the managerial staff of the
Daily Palo Alto.
You will get practical experience in one of
two lines. You can study the needs of the
local market in relation to some commodity
or service of a merchant, and then TRY
YOUR HAND at writing copy—or you can
sell this copy (or other advertising space) to
local merchants.
Nowhere else in Stanford can you get such
experience. You have a chance of becoming
familiar with business problems; and you
make friends with SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
MEN. Moreover, in either of the positions
vou serve the student body in one of its most
IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS.
