# SOCIETY NEEDS TO BE LET ALONE BY SAVIORS-GOLDER
## Communism Has Resulted in Tyranny, According to Assembly Speaker 
### 
"Society needs nothing more than
to be let alone by saviors, both Red
and White," said Professor F. A. Gol
der, of the History department, during
his talk this morning at the student
assembly on "War and Revolution."
"A spiritual and material break
down has taken place in Russia," con
tinued Professor Golder. "Every
known system has been broken, so if
change brings happiness, Russia
should be the happiest country on
earth, instead of the most miserable.
Tyranny of Communism
"Under communism, the state owned
everything, even the bodies and souls
of the people. This resulted in the
greatest tyranny of modern times.
Such treatment was justified on the
grounds that it was for the public
good. Revolution brought the 'new'
economic policy, which was the old
right to buy and sell.
Intellectual Class Gone
Professor Golder told of the condi
tion of all men and women of the
finer type, not communists, who have
only misery and death in store for
them. The intellectual class has prac
tically disappeared. The young women
are particularly to be pitied, with no
careers open to them and with no
chance of marriage with decent men.
He cited the mistakes usually made
by reformers. They attempt to bring
about an ideal state by violence, pay
too much attention to the system, and
fail to understand the importance of
religion and social position, both of
which are established institutions.
