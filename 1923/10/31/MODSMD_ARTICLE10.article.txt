### 
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, and a member of two commit
tees for the coming Olympic games,
was surprised the other day to find a
letter addressed "Mr. Captain H. Ma
loney, Master to the University, Stan
ford, Calif., U. S. A." in his mailbox.
Upon opening the envelope he was
still in a quandary,, for the letter en
closed was in French, or maybe Greek,
he wasn't sure.
After a time a member of his fenc
ing class was able to translate the
letter, which was from E. Vanler
berghe, an architect, in Brussels. The
Belgian told Maloney that he was an
aspirant for the Belgian track team,
and that he had heard of Maloney's
reputation as a trainer, and would ap
preciate some hints from him on how
best to start training for the tryouts
for the Olympics.
As soon as Maloney finds a trans
lator to put his English into French,
or whatever they speak in Belgium,
he will send the desired information
to his admirer.
