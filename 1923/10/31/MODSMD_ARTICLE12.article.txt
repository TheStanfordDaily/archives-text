# Freshmen Decide To Build Annual Big Game Bonfire
## 
### 
The annual big bonfire will be built
again this year. This decision was
reached last night at a meeting of the
Freshman Class in Encina.
The sophomore slave-drivers of the
past years will be supplanted by a
freshman spanking machine. Class
members will be card-indexed and
carefully checked on amount of work
done.
Work will begin on November 11,
according to A. C. Stewart, class presi- j
dent. A committee of four seniors con-'
sisting of Earl May, Orville Tucker,
William Gage, and Fremont Schmei-;
der, will supervise the construction
through a freshman committee of
seven to be appointed by Stewart.
Gage explained the tradition of the
bonfire to the first year men. "Presi
dent Wilbur is perfectly willing that!
the freshmen should build a bonfire
providing that they are not compelled
to do the work by other class men.
