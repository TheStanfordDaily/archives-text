# CHAPPIE READY FOR THIRD BOW TOMORROW
## 
### 
Chappie is again ready for the
broadcasting act. He comes to the at-;
tention of the campus tomorrow morn-!
ing in a wholly new set of togs. The i
creations are the results of three j
months' collection of ideas and aug-j
gestions made through the summer.
The outer garment will be of the three
piece variety with a touch of the
oriental. This covering, contributed by
Julliand McDonald, has a little moral ;
all its own.
The shirt is loose at the collar and
shows a touch of vanity in the wearer 1
but Chappie is not unduly proud. Hap (
Kennedy has arranged this frontis
piece.
And in his coat pocket, Chappie con
tains the key to the new issue of
mirth. Chappie's grand mogul, Mike
Ely, contributes a delightful bedtime
story and McDonald has originated
several pieces of art work which are
worthy. Kenneth Ferguson and Arthur
Bragg have collaborated in a number
of thoughtful artistic endeavors. And
the exchanges are their same old
clever selves.
Chappie's manager, Jim Bullock,
also announces that in the near future
Chappie readers will be favored with
"some Boston Garter copy," and all
this just when garters have been an- j
nounced pass 6.
A little assistance is asked by Mike
Ely in putting out the Big Game Num
ber due to appeur on November 24.
Copy will be received until November
12 and stories and jokes for the com
bined Jester-Chappie number to come
out the first of the year will also re
ceive attention up to that date.
Chappie's efforts are now being
shown on the screen in Palo Alto in
"Fun from the Press."
