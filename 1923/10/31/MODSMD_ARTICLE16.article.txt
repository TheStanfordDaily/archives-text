through the show again in full dress.
The first act will begin at 7:30 and
the second act at 9.
Largest Cast of Late Years
"Androcles and the Lion" boasts the
largest cast of the last three or four
years. There are eight soldiers, eight
gladiators, eight Christian men, four
Christian women, six pack slaves, a
lady-in-waiting, an old man of the Em
peror's train, and fourteen principals.
In spite of the size of the cast Davis
finds less difficulty in handling the
mob scenes than was met in "If I
Were King," where the mob work
was more mechanical.
Greek Fable Basis of Plot
"Androcles and the Lion" is based
on an old Greek fable, first set down
by Aulius Gellius in his book, "The
Attic Nights." This collection was pre
pared by its author during the long
nights of a winter spent in Attica, and
the story of Androcles is credited by
him to Apion Pleistonices, a man fa
mous in his time.
According to Gellius* story, Apion
was in Rome at the time of a great
fight of wild beasts in the Circus Max
imus. Of beasts secured for the spec
tacle, one stood out from all the others
by reason of his ferocity, his dreadful
size, and his resounding roar.
Among those who were to be thrown
to the beasts was Androcles, a Greek
tailor. In time this victim entered the
arena, and the greatest of the lions
was released. The beast rushed from
his cage; but when he caught sight
of Androcles, he stopped suddenly, and
then, as if recognizing him, walked up
to the Greek quietly and allowed him
self to be fondled and petted.
Androcles, summoned before the
Emperor, told of living with this lion
for three years in a cave in the moun
tains, the lion protecting him and
bringing him food. The kindness of
the lion was occasioned by Androcles'
act of pulling a thorn out of the foot
of the beast.
Seneca, a Roman contemporary of
Apion, also reports the recognition of
a man by a lion in the arena, although
he credits the friendliness of the brute
to the fact that the man had once
been the keeper of the lion.
