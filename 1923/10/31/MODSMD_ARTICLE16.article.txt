# DRESS REHEARSAL FOR SHAW DRAMA TO BEGIN TONIGHT
## Plot of Sword and Sandals Comedy Is Taken From Old Greek Fable 
### 
The first of two dress rehearsals
preparatory to the presentation of
''Androcles and the Lion" Friday eve
ning, will be held tonight in the As
sembly hall. No make-up will be ap
plied, but as the costumes are on
hand and the stage sets are finished
all other elements of the finished show
will be present.
Tomorrow evening the cast is to run
through the show again in full dress.
The first act will begin at 7:30 and
the second act at 9.
Largest Cast of Late Years
"Androcles and the Lion" boasts the
largest cast of the last three or four
years. There are eight soldiers, eight
gladiators, eight Christian men, four
Christian women, six pack slaves, a
lady-in-waiting, an old man of the Em
peror's train, and fourteen principals.
In spite of the size of the cast Davis
finds less difficulty in handling the
mob scenes than was met in "If I
Were King," where the mob work
was more mechanical.
Greek Fable Basis of Plot
"Androcles and the Lion" is based
on an old Greek fable, first set down
by Aulius Gellius in his book, "The
Attic Nights." This collection was pre
pared by its author during the long
nights of a winter spent in Attica, and
the story of Androcles is credited by
him to Apion Pleistonices, a man fa
mous in his time.
According to Gellius* story, Apion
was in Rome at the time of a great
fight of wild beasts in the Circus Max
