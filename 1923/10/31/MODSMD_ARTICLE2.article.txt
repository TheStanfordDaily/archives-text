# ARCHITECT'S MIND IS EASED WHEN LIBRARY PILLARS REINSTATED
## 
### 
"It's too bad that the library can't be
kept quiet. What is a fellow going to
do when he has three exes to study for
and this place is turned into a rock
crusher or a boiler factory? It's too
much. Those stairs looked all right."
And all this because one man's mind
was troubled. Arthur Brown, original
designer of the library felt that the stairs
leading to the second floor needed a few
more pillars.
But this is not the first appearance of
pillars in the library. In 1918, wh\i!i
the building was half completed, the col
umns had been built. One day, several
of the trustees took a sudden dislike to
them. A conference of trustees, Presi
dent Wilbur. Comptroller Roth, and
Architect Brown was called, and the re
sult was that the pillars came out.
But Brown wasn't happy. "Those
columns ought to be there," was his
repeated comment. And he said it
often while building the new Stan
ford Union and the new men's halls.
He talked to President Wilbur.
*'As you look down the stairway the
width is too great for the height,"
Brown explained. And so it was finally
decided to put the columns back.
Brown ought to know. He has de
signed many buildings with success.
These include the Horticultural build
ing at the P. P. I. E., the new San
Prancislo City Hall, the Stanford
Union, and Toyon and Branner halls.
In 1921 the Institute of France con
ferred a degree on Brown. He is a
member of Beaux Artes.
