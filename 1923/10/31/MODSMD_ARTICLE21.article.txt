# Regulation of Self-Respect
## 
### 
Quotation from rules for Roughs' Day:
"A. Members of the faculty must be shown clue
respect. Any attempt to force faculty members
through abuse or coercion to enter into the spirit
of the day will not be tolerated.
"B. Women students must not be annoyed in any
way and dressing in women s clothes will not be
permitted. The utmost courtesy and respect must
be shown them and any ridiculing 01 abusive
language or anv ungentlemanly actions will be
severely dealt with."
That such regulations as the above are thought
necessary shows how far undergraduate thought
lessness may lead. Both the groups named in those
two rules are as much an integral part of the Uni
versity as its sandstone pillars.
To say that the roughs must respect these two
elements should be as unnecessary as decreeing that
no one shall speak disparagingly of his own right
hand.
The paragraph labeled "B" might well be taken
as a frank insult by men students, except that some
of them probably remember what occurred last year.
