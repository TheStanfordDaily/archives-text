Bill Brogan, who came a thousand miles to enter
Stanford with sixty dollars in his pocket, was asked

"Is there any reason why I shouldn't go to a rally
every night? This is the greatest University I've
ever heard of, and it has a team with the grittiest
fighters I ever saw. This 'Stanford spirit' I heard
about before I came is the finest ideal I know of.
Why, if they had a rally every five minutes to sup
port that team I'd be there with cough-drops."
