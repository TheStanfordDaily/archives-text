A Word to the Wise Is Sufficient
"You can't make a man fall until you have first
arrested his attention and the only way of being
sure of arresting his attention is by a shock. In
this age if you aren't conspicuous, you might as
well be dead." So soliloquizes one of Ellen Glas
gow's modern Eves. "If a girl wants to be a
perfect lady, nobody is trying to prevent her, but
she has got to realize just what she loses, and that
is all the fun. Nobody is hunting timid bunnies
these days. You've got to be bold game if you
want any attention. There isn't a popular girl
who doesn't get tired of the game sometimes, so
tired that she'd like to have a vacation in an old
ladies' home for a change. But it is as much as
her popularity is worth to drop out of the rush.
If the men really wanted the nice girl, the sweet
old-fashioned girl, if they would rush her at a
dance or keep her busy at the telephone, every
last one of us would begin wearing crinolines and
shying off when toddling.
Doesn't everything come back to the men? So
long as swooning brought every man in sight to
our side, didn't swooning come to us just as na
turally as the one-step? But as soon as swooning
ceased to do the trick and the men left us to old
ladies and sal volatile, we began to sit up and take
notice. Fashions change. That's all." —R. Mcß.

DO You ?????
Last week I met Aloysus Howe,
Leading a brand N. J. cow.
"How come?" says I.
Like this," says he,
"I won her playing Tenn.?" —R. Mcß.

"What did you think of the organ recital?"
"I couldn't make much of it. They gave it in German."
