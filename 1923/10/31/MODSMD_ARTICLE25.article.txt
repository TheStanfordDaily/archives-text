# WHOA, MR. HYDE!
## 
### 
Well, it appears that Mr. Hyde didn't go to the Jolly-
Up. His extravagant praise of last week-end's affair
shows that.
But to the great credit of those who staged the dance
it can truly be said that if any Jolly-Up can be worth
while, that one was. The clever way by which the males
present were inveigled into dancing with the unknown
and unknowable was certainly commendable, and this
is not meant as sarcasm, either. By eleven o'clock the
party was in full swing, everyone present was dancing,
and the whole affair gave the appearance of creating
almost as much enjoyment as a regular dance.
However, Mr. Hyde is requested to attend a Jolly-Up
and see if it is really the kind of a closed-date social
affair Stanford wants after all. Even at its best —and
there is no doubt it was at its best last Saturday night—
there are so many objections that it seems foolish to
exclude every other social event on a week-end night
so that an attempted revival of the "good old days"
(which are gone forever —and replaced by better —no
matter what the blind may claim) may be Btaged.
Leave your typewriter, Mr. Hyde, and try to get a
good dance at a Jolly-Up. . . . being careful, of course,
not to get a poor one. Then air your views again.
At least, if we must have our periodical Jolly-Up, let
it be under the same management it was Saturday night.
There's no use taking chances. —DR. JEKYLL.
