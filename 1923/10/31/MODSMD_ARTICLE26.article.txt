"RUGGLES OF RED GAP," Varsity Theater, Palo Alto.
Now playing.
We do not know when we have enjoyed a movie pro
gram more than the one now on at the Varsity Theater.
The comedy does credit to even Snub Pollard; it is of a
type which should set the standard for the so-called
laugh-makers.
But it was "Ruggles of Red Gap," which topped off
the program, like a well-done meat course after spiced
relish. After the first two reels, which drag a little in
many spots, the action and the laughter are cyclonic.
The first two reels may be excused by stating that
"Ruggles" is a comedy of situations, and it takes some
time to build them. But when they're built. . . !
Torrence, as Egbert of Red Gap, is superb. He does
not stand out so well in this particular picture, because
he is surrounded by a well-chosen cast, but a careful
follower of his would be more than satisfied with his
interpretation of the "Bringing Up Father" type of
husband. *
Edward Everett Horton, as Ruggles, was at least the
equal of Torrence, but was not given quite the oppor
tunity we should have liked, to display his wares.
Altogether, a better type of picture than has been
appearing at local show-houses; the manager is to be
congratulated on his raise in standards. Let us pray
the gods that it is maintained and that it does not give
the admission price highfalutin' notions!

If you like action, see this. Also sentimental girls
could work up quite a complex looking at Barthelmess,
the hero, in his Dutch cut. Another high-standard pic
ture. God help the admission price! —H. M.
