Paul Murray probably sacrificed his
services on the Card varsity when he
made the dive which resulted in a
touchdown for Stanford. Murray has
an injured arm and a sprained knee.

Critics are apt to "pan" Ernie Nev
ers too severely. All sorts of alibis
will serve to excuse the husky full-!
back, and not least among these are:
that Nevers was not well protected,
that the passes were too slow in two
instances, that the Cardinal line failed
to shift to meet the U. S. C. offense.

Bob Officer, star intermountain ten
nis player, has registered at Stanford
this quarter. Bob has entered the
sophomore tennis tourney, now being
played, and his progress will be
watched with interest by those who
have seen him in action in the inter-,
mountain region.

Lew Forrest showed class in the
freshman soccer game with the Sons
of Russia Saturday. Forrest played a
steady game at goal for the babes, ;
and if his first game at Stanford can
be considered an indication, he should
make good varsity material next year.

Vaughn Hosepian, intercollegiate
lightweight wrestler last year, is
coaching wrestling again this year.
Hosepian is no longer eligible for i
competition, but he hopes to develop
a winning team for the Cards before
he leaves for the city in April to con
tinue his medical work.

When the freshman football team ■
takes on the California Polytechnic!
School in the stadium next Saturday,
they are likely to catch a Tartar. The j
Poly team is light, but have developed
a passing game that is second to no
preparatory school in the state.
* ♦ *
The freshmen have all the advan-J
tage in weight against California Poly
next Saturday. The Poly line averages
161, while the heaviest backfield aver
age is 156. This is compared with 1711
and 161 for the freshmen.

Dole proved to the satisfaction of
many of the spectators that he is as
good an end as has appeared on the
Stanford line-up this year. In one in
stance Dole made a spectacular re
covery which would have cost Stan
ford the ball.

Four teams are unbeaten in the Pa
cific Coast Conference, namely: Cali-i
fornia, "Washington, Idaho, and Ore
gon.

Although the playing of the Card j
babe backfield against U. S. C. was
not up to expectations, it was still far
above the average performance. More j
confidence in the line would aid the !
backs considerably.

There were two upsets of dope on i
the Coast last week. U. S. C.'s victory j
over Stanford, and the inability of the j
Bear varsity to score more than nine
points on the Washington State eleven, i

Swede Leistner and Hal Boles are
working out several times a week, get
ting in trim for the track season.
Leistner came second to Lane Falk in

1 both the low and high hurdles in the
California meet last year, and Boles
won both events in the freshman meet.
With these two men entered, Temple
ton should have little trouble in cop
ping two places in most of the meets.

Among the sprinters out for track
| this quarter are Campbell, Gaspar, and
Miller. Campbell holds the Stanford-
California record in the furlong, and
placed fifth in the hundred at the
N. C. A. A. The other two mentioned
were stars on the freshman team last
: year.

The University of California has a
tough schedule ahead of her. Next
Saturday they meet the Trojan eleven
at Los Angeles, and the following
week the Washington Huskies at
Seattle. Following those two games
they will clash with Stanford on No
vember 24.

According to reports from the South,
Gordon Campbell, big U. S. C. fullback,
will be out of the line-up the rest of
j the season due to injuries received
in the Stanford game. Two ribs are
broken and a hip badly damaged.
* * *
A not unlikely shift in the line-up
| for Stanford Saturday would be
"Scotchy" Campbell at halfback and
j either Howard Mitchell or Dick Law
son at quarter.

Redeeming features of last Satur
day's contest were the playing of
j Swan, Shipkey, and Price on the line.
Swan was the star of the game, stop
ping everything that came in his direc
tion. Shipkey proved the hardest end
for the fleet-footed Bob Lee, Trojan
I halfback, to get around. One notice
able fact was that the southerners re
! lied on end runs for their gains in
stead of through the line.

With every man in good condition
from the U. S. C. freshman game,
Coach Hunt is beginning to point his
| babes toward the Little Big Game,!
November 10, in the stadium. If the
Bear cubs succeed in beating the
| southern outfit, they must be granted
a considerable edge over the Cards.

A live stock judging team from |
Washington State College will com
pete in the Pacific International Live
stock Exposition to be held in Port
land on November 1.
