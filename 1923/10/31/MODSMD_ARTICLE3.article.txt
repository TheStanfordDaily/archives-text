# DE GRASSI, ALLEN, AND CESARONI GIVE PLEASING CONCERT
## Violinist Presents Two Original Compositions to Large Audience 
### Miriam Hilton 
Dignity peculiar to the old masters
and a charm of rendition which was
individual made last night's recital
by Antonio de Grassi, Lucian Cesaronl,
and Warren D. Allen in the Memorial
Church a thing of beauty to be long
remembered.
De Grassi chose well in playing
Handel's "Sonata in E major" for his
first number. In it he revealed the
character of bis art. Of the four move
ments perhaps the Largo met with
greatest appreciation, for the singing
melody of G-string created a haunting
sweetness. The last allegro, with its
alternating melody, now carried by
violin, now by organ, gave a sunny
lightness to the majestic dignity of
Handel's sonata.
Cesaroni's Basso Rich
Cesaroni sang "Within These Sacred
Bowers" from Mozart's "Magic Flute"
first, and "Nature's Praise of God" by
Beethoven as his last number. His
deep basso contributed the required
richness to the aria and lent itself
particularly well to the solemnity of
Beethoven's hymn. The latter was
sung with a nice finish. The lowest
notes of the aria, however, required
almost too much of the basso.
"Berceuse," an original composition
of de Grassi's, was an exquisitely love
ly, floating melody. It perfectly suited
the violinist's delicate style. "Romance
in G major," by Beethoven, was played
with unusual expression and a nice
management of the double stops.
"Poem" of Fibich was possibly a little
too sentimental, but this was partly
the composer's fault.
In "Chaconne" de Grassi proved the
power of his technique. It is a most
difficult piece to execute well, for it
requires the violin to play its own ac
companiment, but was masterfully
rendered by the artist.
Allen did not play any solo numbers
but the excellence of his accompani
ment was noted throughout the con
cert.
