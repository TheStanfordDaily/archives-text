# AT 21 YEARS OF AGE
## President Wilbur Was Senior Class Head; Took Part in Athletic Contests 
### 
At 21 years of age, President Wil
bur was Senior Class president at
Stanford, a member of the Executive
committee, and was taking his pre
medical course in the Department of
Psysiology. He graduated with the
class of 1896 and continued his work
in medicine. During his last year he
was an assistant in his major depart
ment.
Dr. Wilbur came to Stanford from
Riverside, California, graduating from
the high school there. He had always
been interested in the collection of
birds and birds' eggs as well as small
animals, and had spent his summers
making collections before entering
college. During two of the summer
vacations President Wilbur gathered
specimens of animals and birds in
Arizona near the Mexican border.
These specimens are now in the Uni
versity in the Hopkins Collection.
While in college, Dr. Wilbur took
part in interclass athletics, devoted
some time to articles for the Sequoia,
and debated with the other members
of Euphronia. When he came to Stan
ford there was no such thing as hazing.
The students would not stand for any
thing but a fair fight in which the
opponents had an equal chance for vic
tory. Hazing came in with the fraterni

ties as part of initiation stunts a few
years after Dr. Wilbur graduated, but
it did not become violent and uncon
trolled until it was taken up in the
halls.
Competition between the Freshman
and Sophomore Classes when Presi
dent Wilbur was a senior, took the
form of athletic contests and not
physical combats. These contests were
intended to "point" the men for the
meets with California. Dr. Wilbur and
George Toombs, both of the same
build, entered the freshman-sophomore
mile-walk contest. When this became
known at California, the mile-walk was
cut out for that year.
Some of the problems and accom
plishments of Wilbur's regime as
Senior Class president were the re
organization of the student body and
the placing of the treasurer and mana
ger of the A. S. S. U. on a salaried
basis. This was to prevent such bodies
as the Glee Club and the baseball team
when away on a trip from contracting
hotel and other debts which were sent
to the A. S. S. U. for payment.
The first class plate under the Me
morial Church arcades was set by the
Class of 1896 when Wilbur was presi
dent, and the idea developed into a
tradition.

birds and birds' eggs as well as small
animals, and had spent his summers
making collections before entering
college. During two of the summer
vacations President Wilbur gathered
specimens of animals and birds in
Arizona near the Mexican border.
These specimens are now in the Uni
versity in the Hopkins Collection.
While in college, Dr. Wilbur took
part in interclass athletics, devoted
some time to articles for the Sequoia,
and debated with the other members
of Euphronia. When he came to Stan
ford there was no such thing as hazing.
The students would not stand for any
thing but a fair fight in which the
opponents had an equal chance for vic
tory. Hazing came in with the fraterni

ties as part of initiation stunts a few
years after Dr. Wilbur graduated, but
it did not become violent and uncon
trolled until it was taken up in the
halls.
Competition between the Freshman
and Sophomore Classes when Presi
dent Wilbur was a senior, took the
form of athletic contests and not
physical combats. These contests were
intended to "point" the men for the
meets with California. Dr. Wilbur and
George Toombs, both of the same
build, entered the freshman-sophomore
mile-walk contest. When this became
known at California, the mile-walk was
cut out for that year.
Some of the problems and accom
plishments of Wilbur's regime as
Senior Class president were the re
organization of the student body and
the placing of the treasurer and mana
ger of the A. S. S. U. on a salaried
basis. This was to prevent such bodies
as the Glee Club and the baseball team
when away on a trip from contracting
hotel and other debts which were sent
to the A. S. S. U. for payment.
The first class plate under the Me
morial Church arcades was set by the
Class of 1896 when Wilbur was presi
dent, and the idea developed into a
tradition.
At 21 years of age, President Wil
bur was Senior Class president at
Stanford, a member of the Executive
committee, and was taking his pre
medical course in the Department of
Psysiology. He graduated with the
class of 1896 and continued his work
in medicine. During his last year he
was an assistant in his major depart
ment.
Dr. Wilbur came to Stanford from
Riverside, California, graduating from
the high school there. He had always
been interested in the collection of
birds and birds' eggs as well as small
animals, and had spent his summers
