# Roble Adopts Cafeteria Style for Sunday Supper
## 
### 
Bread lines on the campus! We
have had "snakes' lines," "roughs' j
lines," even the greatly discussed
"jolly-up lines," but a line for the
hungry women is the latest innovation
at Roble hall.
The cafeteria style of service was
decided upon for the Sunday evening |
suppers, and now each week the wo-!
men will imitate the Russian bolshe
viks, with plates in hand, waiting in j
mob formation for inevitable food and
final satisfaction.
