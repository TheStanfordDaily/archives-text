# VARSITY ELEVEN WILL MEET O. C. SATURDAY

Saturday at 2:30 the Cardinal var
sity will meet the strong Olympic Club
eleven. Whether Stanford will have a
rejuvenated team, the same team
greatly strengthened, or the mediocre
eleven of former years, is the question.
It usually takes a surprise to bring
back an over-confident team, and
while the Cards were not altogether
over-confident last Saturday, there
was a touch of the "holier than thou"
spirit in the atmosphere, which, en
couraging as it was at first, proved to
be a decided setback.
One thing is certain. Stanford in the
last half forgot the very fundamentals
which Andy Kerr had been drilling
into them, and which he. and the
campus at large, felt reasonably sure
the team had mastered. The Cards not
only failed to follow the ball, but al
lowed the Trojans to follow it to their
advantage. U. S. C. fumbled and U. S.
C. recovered, but when Stanford fum
bled there was usually an opponent's
arm cuddled about the sphere.
Something is weak in the center of
the varsity line. That doesn't mean
that George Baker wasn't giving every
ounce of fight he possessed. He is the
lightest man on the squad and, every
thing considered, he is one of the i
headiest and most consistent of the
linesmen. But once the big colored
halfback, Riddle of U. S. C., discovered
the weakness, he made constant gains.
The team did not use the expected
bag of tricks. Aside from a fake drop
kick formation the plays were kept
within the bounds of straight football.
U. S. C.'s victory was a screeching
piece of good luck for Gloomy Gus
Henderson. He not only expected to
lose the game, but he wasn't alto
gether sure how big the score would
be. Therefore when the Trojans found
themselves favored by the breaks the
morale of the team furnished enough
incentive to keep back the somewhat
discouraged but determined Cardinal!
aggregation until the final gun was
sounded.
Monday night the varsity was given
a rest, and only the second string men j
were on the field. The substitutes are
scenting a shift, the pep which they (
displayed In lining up during signal
practice shows that they look for the
change any minute. Murray Cuddeback
especially deserves honorable men
tion. Leave it to Andy Kerr to find j
the weakness, and if there is any man j
on the squad who is more deserving'
of a position than his fellow "regular" j
that player will get the job.

Freshmen at. Williams College will
be compelled to wear a huge bow of
Patrick green ribbon tied to the peak
according to a recent order of the stu

It usually takes a surprise to bring
back an over-confident team, and
while the Cards were not altogether
over-confident last Saturday, there
was a touch of the "holier than thou"
spirit in the atmosphere, which, en
couraging as it was at first, proved to
be a decided setback.
One thing is certain. Stanford in the
last half forgot the very fundamentals
which Andy Kerr had been drilling
into them, and which he. and the
campus at large, felt reasonably sure
the team had mastered. The Cards not

lowed the Trojans to follow it to their
advantage. U. S. C. fumbled and U. S.
C. recovered, but when Stanford fum
bled there was usually an opponent's
arm cuddled about the sphere.
Something is weak in the center of
the varsity line. That doesn't mean
that George Baker wasn't giving every
ounce of fight he possessed. He is the
lightest man on the squad and, every

linesmen. But once the big colored
halfback, Riddle of U. S. C., discovered
the weakness, he made constant gains.
