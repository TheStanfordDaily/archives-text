# Postcard to Berlin Costs 750,000 Marks in Stamps
## 
### 
The cost of sending a letter from
Germany to the United States, five
cents in American money, has jumped
from one-fifth of a mark before the
war to 750,000 marks in September,
1923.
This depreciation of the mark as re
corded in Germany's postage is the
subject of a stamp exhibit in the Li
brary.
It now costs some 48,000,000 marks
to send a magazine to America.
A decided increase in the number
of marks equivalent to the five cent
postage rate began in November, 1922,
with 20 marks. From month to month
the number doubled until July, 1923,
when 800 marks were equivalent to
five cents. In September the number
jumped to 750,000.
Stamps of higher and higher de
nomination were printed, but now the
government cannot print stamps fast
enough to keep up with the deprecia

tion of the mark, and a rubber stamp
Is used.
The postal authorities in Berlin are
â– realizing the fihancial benefit to be
derived from new colors, values, and
designs, when collectors the world
over are paying untold amounts for
unused copies of stamps of Teutonic
manufacture,
Thousands of dollars from all over
the world are pouring into Germany
for stamps which she has been print
ing at almost no cost at all.
Germany has issued 74 varieties of
staps in 1922, and 175 varieties have
appeared since the beginning of the
war.
