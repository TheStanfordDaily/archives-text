# German 'S' Award Is Reconsidered By Ex Committee
## 
### 
The German "S" award for second
varsity men is being reconsidered by
the student executive committee in
the light of further evidence that has
just come up. It is possible that, if
such an award is given, playing on the
"goofs" will be considered as inter
collegiate competition by the Pacific
Coast Conference. This will mean that
any man who has played on the second
squad may be ineligible for just that
amount of service on the first squad.
The matter will be taken up with the
conference this week, and the execu
tive committee will make a final de
cision at its next meeting.
The following dates were granted:
Delta Upsilon, formal, Nov. 28; Kappa
Alpha Theta, informal, Nov. 28; Theta
Xi, informal, Nov. 17; Chi Psi, date for
Dec. 8 cancelled; Cap and Gown, in
formal dance in Women's Clubhouse,
Nov. 17.
