# SURPRISE PROGRAM PLANNED FOR RALLY IN PAVILION TONIGHT
## Football Authorities Will Discuss Prospects for Saturday's Game 
### 
Snappy entertainment, including:
comedy numbers, specialty acts, and
music by one of the leading campus
orchestras will be the distinguishing
feature of tonight's rally, the second
of the indoor jazz-fests of the year, to
be held in the basketball pavilion at
7 o'clock.
The exact program for this eve
ning is being kept secret by Burt Lapp,
yell leader. Like all Gaul, the affair
will be divided into three parts. The j
entertainment numbers will come first,
followed by a ten-minute practice of
songs and yells. The third part will
include short talks by prominent stu-1
dents and alumni on football men and j
football prospects.
Students will be asked to pass upon
a number of matters relating to the |
rooting section at future games, while
new dope on certain songs not yet j
rehearsed this season, and on some |
of the yells, will be explained by Lapp
and his assistants. The students will
also be asked to decide whether or not
the rooters's hats shall be worn to
other games preliminary to the main !
event on November 24, in order to
gain practice in staging bleacher
stunts effectively.
Authentic information relating to
the condition of the football team for
Saturday's game, and the prospscts of
the Cardinal squad for the coming
season, particularly the November 24
shindig, will be spilled by speakers
who, according to Lapp, have been se
lected for their familiarity with foot
ball conditions here. These talks;
should prove especially interesting in
view of the conflicting reports circu
lated on the campus and through the
press since the U. S. C. game last
Saturday.
By their attendance at the rally to
night, the Card supporters will show
whether or not they really have the !
old stuff back again, in the opinion
of Lapp. The party precedes the Olym- j
pic Club game on Saturday, and dope- j
sters expect to gauge the probable
size of the score by the spirit dis
played tonight.
