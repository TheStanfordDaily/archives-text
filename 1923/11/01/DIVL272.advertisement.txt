Stiegeler's Made-toOrder Clothes
are Clothes of Character
FINE materials, fine workmanship, good style,
and corred fit make character clothesâ€”and
nothing else can. Leave out any one of these
qualities and your suit will never give you the
service or satisfaction it should. You'll find some
particularly appropriate patterns here now, and
the start of the season is the logical time in which
to place your order.
This applies just as much to even
ing clothes as it does to everyday
clothes. fVe are ready, are you?
