Behind the pageantry of English history, from the time when the
early inhabitants discarded skin for woven cloth, the thump, and
rattle and buzz of British looms has played an important part in the
growth of the British Empire and Anglo-Saxon civilization, especially
since the introduction of power looms—Argincourt, Trafalger,
Waterloo; the Spanish armada, the Grand seas fleet; kings, soldiers,
poets, statesmen; men of letters and science are flashed on the
screen of history, but behind it all the looms have never ceased to
wave the fabrics worn round the world; fabrics that typify the
strength and solidarity of Britain. . . .
So, then, THE WHITE HOUSE, wishing to secure distinctive
and high quality fabrics to maintain the quality reputation of its
clothes, sends an expert to the British Isles to personally select fabrics
suited to its needs and has them tailored by skilled New \ork tailors
into the kind of suits and overcoats demanded by its patrons. . . .
