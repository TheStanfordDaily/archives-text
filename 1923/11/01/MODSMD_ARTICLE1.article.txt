## Representatives from All Over United States to Co-operate With Directors 
### 
The Board of Trustees has an
nounced election of the members of a
new board to co-operate with them in
the administration of the University,
known as the Stanford National Board.
This body is representative of all
parts of the country and its province
is to brfrig directly to the aid of
Stanford the information and ideas
of well-known public citizens and
alumni of all sections of the nation
in planning the policies and future of
the University.
For this purpose the National Board
will meet once or twice a year with
the Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity and will be kept constantly in
formed of actions taken by the Board
of Trustees.
Another and complementary func
tion of the members of the rational
Board will be to serve as
tive centers of information to tfie pub
lic and the alumni of Stanford in all
parts of the country.
Is Recognition of Wide Interests
Stanford has always drawn its stu
dent body from a wider geographical
range than is usual with American
universities, and this new board is a
recognition of the national character
of the University's interests as well
as the result of a desire by the Board
of Trustees to gain the benefit of the
broadest possible viewpoint in its ac
tions.
The National Board is composed of
thirty members elected by the Board
of Trustees for three-year terms on a
geographical basis. In addition, the
president of the alumni association of
the University is a member of the
National Board ex-officio.
Alumni Elect Two-Thirds
Twenty of the thirty members of the
National Board are elected by the
Board of Trustees from nominations
by the Advisory Board of the Stanford
Alumni Association, representative of
geographical regions. For this purpose
the country outside of California has
been divided into nine geographical
units, each of which has a representa
! tive on the Board, and there will be
: one representative also of each of the
eleven congressional districts of Cali
fornia,
The Board of Trustees elects ten
members upon nominations by its own
membership. To insure the national
i character of the National Board's
