orous opposition to the Poly outfit, but

quate defense for open plays.

sponsible for those ten first downs made
by the U. S. C. freshmen, have improved
enough to play a better game against the

entire line in himself. Shipkey, at end,
is another man that greatly strengthens
the freshman line.

and carried 40 yards over the line.
On the kick-off following, Hyland
caught the ball and carried it through the
entire Gray team and down the field for
a score.
The California Polytechnic school
eleven f>f San Luis Obispo will meet the
freshman team next Saturday in the pre
liminary to the vAity and Olympic Club
game. Although indications are that the
babes will emerge easy victors, the Poly
team may spring a surprise putting up a
fast game.
Although California Poly has won a
majority of her games in the California
Coast Conference, she is handicapped by
a light team. The only defeat in confer
ence games suffered by the San Luis
Obispo squad was hung there by "Swede"
Righter's team which played here yester
day. Righter's eleven won 23-0.
San Mateo Junior College offered vig
orous opposition to the Poly outfit, but
fell by a 6-9 score. In the other important
game, California Poly defeated the San
Jose State Teacher's College 14-0. Com
pared with the 79-0 score rolled up by
the Stanford frosh. the result of Sat
urday's game doesn't look to promising
for the state school.
California Poly has a light, fast team
using open formations, especially forward
passes. Saturday should show whether or
not the freshmen have developed an ade
quate defense for open plays.
The babe line, which was partially re
sponsible for those ten first downs made
by the U. S. C. freshmen, have improved
enough to play a better game against the
Poly team. Captain Fred Swan is an
entire line in himself. Shipkey, at end,
is another man that greatly strengthens
the freshman line.
Freshmen backfield sprinters rolled up
22 points on Swede Righter's College of
the Pacific eleven yesterday afternoon,
allowing them to smash through the left
side of the line for one touchdown.
The babes played erratically with the
left flank almost always good for a gain.
On the defensive there was d bad hole
in the center of the wall, and through
this the San Jose team pounded for its
single score, aided by 35 yards in pen
alties against the babes, usually for off
side.
After the Pacific team had been dis
posed of, Hunt's squad took on the Stan
ford Grays and allowed them a touch
down on a fumble, which was recovered
and carried 40 yards over the line.
On the kick-off following, Hyland
