istered against the Mare Island Hospital
aggregation two wqeks ago, the Card

thing of generalship but also proved to
be a consistent ground gainer. He is a
good punter, his kicks average around the
45 yard mark regularly; he is a passer,
and also a good man for interference.
Jack Erhorn and "Porky" Dwight are
slated for the half back positions, with
"Chuck" Stratton at full.
