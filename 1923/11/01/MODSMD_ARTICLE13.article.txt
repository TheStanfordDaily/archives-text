# CAMPBELL WILL PLAY HALF
## Mitchell to Be Shifted to Quarterback While "Scotchy" Calls Signals 
### 
According to the present plans of
Coaeh Andy Kerr, "Scotchy" Camp
bell, captain and quarterback of the
Stanford varsity, will play halfback
against the Olympic Club eleven next
Saturday. Howard Mitchell, who has
played a good accompaniment to the
Cardinal captain as second fiddle will
take over the reins of the .quarterback
position.
The shift was made necessary due
to the indefinite absence of Paul Mur
ray from the squad.
"Mitchell has done everything that
we have expected of him, and I am
convinced that he can cut the buck,"
was the claim of the Stanford coach.
Kerr think that Campbell will con
tinue to call signals and at the same
lime giv« the team more support by
making use of his ability to carry the
ball.
The change gives the varsity the
advantage of having a good open field
runner of the Art Wilcox type.
Shifting positions is nothing new in
the life of Campbell. During his term
on the Card team he has been tried at

end, guard, and at halfback.
Kerr also wanted to make it plain
that George Baker has been subjected
to much undue criticism because of
the blocked kicks in last Saturday's
game with U. S. C. which critics claim
were the fault of the center's end
over-end pass,
"We have always used these passes
at Pittsburgh with great success," con
; tinued Kerr. "California uses' the
spiral pass and the critics in this lo
cality cannot see any other method."
"Both methods are followed in the
East, and 1 am not willing to admit
that there is any advantage to the
i spiral."
In regard to the Olympic game Kerr
! stated:
"We are going to take that game
in our stride, and I will not use any
man who is not in perfect condition.
The intercollegiate games are the
ones we are anxious to win, and I will
refuse to do anything that may hurt
our chances against Idaho, Oregon,
and California."
"It is the future in which we are
j concerned —not the past."
