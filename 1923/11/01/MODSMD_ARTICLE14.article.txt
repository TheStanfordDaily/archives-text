# CAMPBELL TO SPEAK IN PAVILION TONIGHT
## Bayley Will Entertain at Rally; Davis, Templeton, DeGroot, Masters on Program 
### 
Arnold Bayley, pipe organist extraor
dinary and imitator supreme, and speakers
including "Scotchy" Campbell, Dudley
DeGroot, Paul Davis, "Dink" Templeton,
and A1 Masters, are the artists billed for
appearance at the Olympic Club game
rally, to be held in the Basketball Pa
vilion tonight at 7 o'clock.
Bayley, who has added a new noise to
his list as a result of his rehearsals for
"Androcles and the Lion," will appear
for a few minutes before rehearsal, ac
cording to Yell Leader Burt Lapp. He
will be given a free hand in arranging
his number, and will drag out his "pipe
organ," which has not been heard on the
campus since the Glee Club concert last
year. He will be aided by an orchestra,
which will also play during the rally.
The five speakers will give short talks

on subjects relating to football, particu
larly the Biff Game. They will deal not
only with the gridiron athletes, but with
those who gain their exercise by climbing
up and down the'stadium aisles on Sat
urdays.
Apoplexy Recommended
Those who feel that Chappie may have
warbled something pretty close to the
truth when he remarks in the current is
sue that the rooting section is "a proper
and fitting place for apoplexy" will be
able to get in good apoplectic training at
tonight's affair. Chappie announces that
"he does his doggonedest to throw a fit
any and every time he sits in the rooting
section." and advises those about to at
tend a game to "lower your brown, pin'
your ears back, and bray—and lay off
this sad shaking of the head at those of
us who like to swear copiously and tear
out a lung beseeching touchdowns."
Quality as well as quantity of noise is
highly desirable, in the opinion of Lapp,
and for that reason a part of the evening
will be given over to smoothing off the
rough spots on yells and sweetening up
some of the songs a fittle. New informa
tion will be spilled concerning some of
the organized rackets to be indulged in
next Saturday and other Saturdays, and
students who wish to be on the boat at
future games will be issued tickets to
night. The price is attendance at the
rally. «
The bleacher varsity will also be asked
to decide on how they want to do some
things, and if they want to do some
others, such as wear rooters' caps at
games previous to the Large Contest on
November 24.
Five Speakers on Program
As the third division of the program,
Scotchv & Co. will deliver extemporane
ous orations. No advance copies have
been issued by the secretaries of the
various speakers, as the men will say
what they have to say extemporaneously.
If the five may be judged by past per
formances, the talks will be worth hear
ing.
As captain of the 1922 varsity, DeGroot
established a reputation for twisting a
mean tongue.
A1 Masters sprang to fame by labelling
the present grid captain the "wild bull of
the campus" at a recent assembly.
"Scotchy" Campbell is billed to speak
briefly, forcibly, and to the point, accord
