# He Wants His Paddle Back

### 
The freshman class, meeting in Encina hall, de
cided that they would build a bonfire for the Big
Game rally this year. They laid plans to run the
construction under their own direction, with their
own methods of disciplining those who would rather
stand around and watch.
Cometh now, right into the office of the Daily,
one who objects. Not because the freshmen have
decided to build the bonfire, but because they have
been allowed to decide for themselves. "Looks as
if the frosh are just about running things," sezzee.
At this juncture it was pointed out that the fresh
men, when they are given the opportunity to decide
their own affairs themselves, usually come out right
side up. Whereupon the defendant grumbled some
thing about "traditions—ain't what they used to
be—grr."
