Argument and criticism has arisen over night
with the erection of the new pillars in the lobby of
the Library. Those who believe they are capable
to judge say that the addition of pillars will spoil
the beauty of the entrance, and mar the vista up
the stairs.
The Daily is not going to attempt any decision
on the artistic merits of pillars in entrances, pre
ferring to leave that to the architects who designed
the structure. However, it is worthy of commcnt
that so many people are appreciative of Stanford's
buildings and proud enough of their appearance to
bend their artistic tastes towards constructive criti
cism of innovations which they fear will detract
in the slightest from the beauty of design.
