# TRIP TO AUSTRALIA BY CARD BOXERS IS ALMOST CERTAINTY
## 
### 
Assurance that the proposed trip of
the Stanford boxing team to Australia
this summer will be enthusiastically wel
comed bv Australian authorities was
given in a letter received by Coach Harry
Maloney yesterday. A definite program
will be forwarded after the meeting next
week of their sports association.
Final plans arc now in the hands of
the graduate manager. They call for a
fourteen-man team in addition to Coach
Maloney and Manager Howard Bissell.
Two men will be taken for each of the
seven weights and these men will meet
the teams of the different amateur sport
ing associations, in addition to the team of
of the combined universities.
Instead of having the Stanford men
meet universities only as was at first
j planned, the boxers will meet teams rep
resenting the amateur sports associations
| in each of the different states, in addition
to a contest with a combined university
team. This change was made necessary
because of the weakness this year of the
j individual university teams.
H. Heydon, secretary of the Aus
tralian Universities Sports association,
! says in part regarding the trip:
"The council of the Australian Uni
i versitics Sports association considered
I reports from all the local universities,
| bearing on the proposed visit of a boxing
i team from Stanford University.
"If you bring a boxing team out under
j control athletic club conference, my coun
cil would lend its fullest support, and
! should be able to secure at least one con
test between your team and the combined
j Australian universities."
The sporting editor of the Sydney
Referee, the largest Australian sports
paper, is boosting the proposed trip, as
| well as a number of other prominent
j sporting agencies there.
