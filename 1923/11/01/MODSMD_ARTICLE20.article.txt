Week-end words we love to hear: "Linz bissy," "I'm
sorry but I have to go up to the city Friday night," "I'm
a little tired tonight—can't we do it some other time,"
"You know one of the funniest things happened up at
the house tonight " "I would love to, Charlie, but
some friends are coming down from the city. . . "Do
you like to sing when you dance?"
"What are you doing in laboratory now?"
"We're testing macadam."
"Oh—One of those Rhoades Scholars you read about!"
