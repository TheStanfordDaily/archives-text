# PRINCETON V. YALE

### 
Really, what is the difference between Eastern uni
versities and Western institutions of the same charac
ter? Western men brag repeatedly of the democracy
in their alma maters and of various other characteristics
in which their colleges are superior to those in the
East —but few have been at any representative Eastern
university, much less made a thorough investigation of
its atmosphere and character.
In order that these students in the future may intelli
gently compare the Pacific and Atlantic institutions,
the following, which recently appeared in The Forum
and written by Edmund Wilson, '16, of Princeton, is
printed:
Princeton Is Lax; Yale Serious
"The fundamental differences," begins Wilson,
"have their roots in profound local differences. Prince
ton, like New Jersey, is lax and easy-going; Yale, like
New England, is serious and a little grim. In the old
days * * * the tremendous efficiency of Yale was
largely expended upon athletics, * * * but now
literature and drama at Yale rank equally with athletics
and to all these pursuits they bring the same powerful
determination and relentless efficiency. * * * The
result is a quite professional daily paper, well-produced
and well-acted dramatics, and a monthly magazine of
solid resources and extremely high literary standards."
Princeton, on the other hand, according to Wilson, is
quite the opposite so far us grim efficiency goes. The
term begins with a few students casually drifting into
town until the classes begin when the men can be seen
walking back and forth between their eating clubs,
singing in the evening on the campus, the tennis courts,
or other athletic fields —all with the careless joy of
youth.
"The result is that one is periodically exasperated by
the meaningless casualness of life while at Yale. Life
is made dramatic whatever the cost."
Traditions Change at Princeton
Speaking of traditions, Wilson says that Yale believes
it is as iron-clad as parts of the constitution and should
never be tampered with —much less violated. Princeton,
however, enjoys frequent student revolutions and is con
stantly forming new so-called traditions and casting
aside others.
Intellectually speaking, Yale is a vast machine, the
cogs of which are students whose mentalities and in
telligences are likely to be forced into a mould, there
to stay and function one set of ideas of thinking. At
Princeton, on the other hand, if "one has the energy to
think it," as Wilson puts it, one can say nearly anything
and do nearly anything, but in the end, one is likely to be
softened and debauched by idleness.
"The mainsprings of the mechanisms of both Prince
ton and Yale are to be found in their respective social
systems." At Yale, the social climax comes at the eml
of the junior year when, after three years of unknown
censorship by upperclassmen, the student is elected to
a club or society. This censorship, according to Wilson,
arouses an almost religious veneration by the student
for the senior society into which he enters.
At Princeton, however, there are no such senior so
cieties and the men are elected to eating clubs early in
their sophomore year, eliminating the censorship of
three years. Th clubs are not character-forming but
only eating clubs which have no other purposes than
eating and occasionally giving agreeable house parties
in the spring.
Bemoans "Cheapened Education"
Wilson praises both institutions for the major princi
ples which they uphold and bemoans the increasing
tendency to cheapen education, and, perhaps, culture,
in the state universities. Princeton and Yale, he claims,
are two of a rapidly decreasing number of universities
that have attempted in the past to carry on the "tradi
tions of humanism and of an aristocratic training which
are fast disappearing from the world."
"These universities are now brought into competition
with state universities and technical schools and the
great Sears-Roebuck institutions like Columbia. I think
that it is important for the old culture to be preserved
somewhere with all of its subtlety and elegance, and its
beauty and strength."
