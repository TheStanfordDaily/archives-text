# GLEE CLUB BATTLES OVER SWALLOW-TAIL
## 
### 
"Monkey suit" or "Tux?" That's the
great unsolved problem of the Stan
ford Glee Club.
Forty-two members have the full
dress outfit. Twenty-one have tuxedos.
Fourteen have neither. Each year the
distressing problem turns up. New
members don't want to buy the nearly
obsolete swallow-tails. The old mem
bers had to buy them and want to
put them to some use.
It is a battle of pocketbooks. May
the lightest side win.
