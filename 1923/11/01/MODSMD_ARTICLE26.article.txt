# SIX RESERVE SPACE IN STANFORD HISTORY
## 
### 
The smooth expanse of the new pine
top table in the Union store offers an
opportunity unequalled since the days
of beer and the Larkin tables, for
students to carve their names where
future generations may read them.
The table is already beautified by
six carefully pencilled reservations,
awaiting the more permanent art of
the knife Cord wearers will have first
choice for the desirable locations on
top, but the storekeeper threatens to
give the underclassmen a chance at
everlasting fame if the oldtimers don't
do better.
