# SHAW COMEDY BURLESQUE WILL BE PRESENTED TOMORROW NIGHT
## 'Androcles and the Lion' Combines Laughter and Thought; Second Dress Rehearsal Tonight 
### 
"Androcles and the Lion" is more than a mere comedy written to bring a
few added smiles and laughs into the world. At times it seems to become
only broad farce, but Shaw, known as the greatest humorist among present-
day playwrights, had a few serious ideas of his own.
He knew that no one would read them if he wrote them out and labeled
them "Religion; as it is not and as it should be." So he wrote a farce to

j please his box office manager and assure himself a large audience, then Oiled
i his play with a clever undercurrent of satire that makes people sit up in their
seats and take notice.
The show that" startled, shocked, and amused all London" will be seen on
the Assembly hall stage tomorrow night. After dress rehearsal last night and
| a repetition of the same tonight its producers feel confident that they will

r give the campus something to talk
about.
After his drama had sufficiently
startled folk and created a furor in
London, New York, and elsewhere,
Shaw came out with his discussion on
J religion which is now incorporated as
the preface to "Androcles and the
Lion." Then his audience saw that
what they had thought was an attack
| on Christianity was, on the contrary,
something deeper and finer in support
of it #


Androcles (Hollis Chalmers) tries hard to appreciate the advantages of
martyrdom, while the Lion (Arnold Bayley) says grace.
