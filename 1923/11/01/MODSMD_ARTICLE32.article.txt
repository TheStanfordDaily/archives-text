# SENIORS WILL PLAY FROSH INTERCLASS GRID TEAM MONDAY
## 
### 
A second change was made in the
iuterclass football schedule yesterday
when the freshman-senior game an
nounced for Saturday morning was
postponed to Monday afternoon at
3:30.
The substitution was necessitated by
decision of the yearling coaching staff
to use the third string eleven in part
of the California-Polytechnic game
Saturday afternoon.
In the third freshman backfield,
Reise and Pegrim as halves can be de
; pended upon for gains either through
the line or around the opposing wings.
Rehm at full is also of this class. New
kirk reigns the favorite at quarter but
McDougall, his substitute, is fast and
lacks only weight. On the line, Sproul
and Felix both get down well under
punts and show to advantage on of
fense and defense.
As a whole the eleven usually func
tions well even against a heavier
squad, and are picked to give the
heavy sponsor aggregation a tough
! fight next Monday.
On this senior machine the head
liners are: Copeland, the husky full
back who hits hard and knows how
to top an opposing back on defense.
He is a former Arizona yearling and
varsity man, having made his "A" on
both football squads at the Wildcat
institution.
McHose has been taken out of in
terclass competition by Andy Kerr,
who wishes to save him for basket
ball, leaving Phelps, a fast open field
runner, to run the team. Farrish shows
up well at end as does Allen, who also
drops back to do the booting. Wren,
a member of the United States Rugby
team at the Olympic Games in 1920,
leads the field of halfbacks, which in
cludes Dills, Kennedy, Griffith, and
Hamilton. Playter usually starts at
1 center but is replaced occasionally by
Coach Jarvis, who would be good ma
terial for any 190-pound line.
Jarvis reported yesterday that the
seniors are experiencing a shortage
j of men and that any that wish to play
still have a chance by coming out Fri
| day afternoon for practice.
