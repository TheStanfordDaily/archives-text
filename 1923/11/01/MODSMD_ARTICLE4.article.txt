# League of Nations Is Moloney's Term For Soccer Teams
## 
### 
"The League of Nations" is 'what
i Harry Maloney calls the weekly meetings
| of the University and Club soccer league.
| He's right at that, for the club roster
! includes teams representing Norway,
' Denmark, Russia, England, Scotland,
j Malta, and Italy, in addition to the elevens
that are 100 per cent American.
Twenty-one teams are in the league this
'year, a greater number than ever before.
When delegates from each team meet to
j decide schedules or settle disputes soine-
I thing is bound to happen. Just imagine
j men swearing in eight different languages
in the same room! To hear it is a liberal
education.
Then there is another difficulty to be
I overcome. How can the referee prevent
| coaching from the side-lines >jdien he
| can't understand the language the coaches
| of the teams are speaking? But, even at
that a very cosmopolitan spirit usually
â–  prevails, according to Maloney.
For instance, it frequently happens that
I the teams meet, only to find that the
' referee is absent. Instead of a squabble
j the captain of one team will ask the cap
! tain of the other team to furnish one of
his own men to officiate. Few universi
! ties would dare to do that.
At other times, queer ideas are shown.
The other day one of the teams was
i scheduled to meet a team in another town
(in the morning. The manager of the home
j team at once said :
"Come over early and have breakfast
with our men, and then we will play
after eating." That might work, if the
! Italian could give up his tamale, and sip
a cup of tea with the Englishman. Or
i would it?
