# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRINTS AND ETCHINGS EXPLAINED BY LEMOS
## 
### 
Wlfet is the difference between a
print and an etching. Many people
interested in art are often confused
regarding art terms. This is the opin
ion of John Lemos of the Stanford
Art Gallery in speaking of the collec
tion of Robert M. Loeser prints now
on exhibition.
In reality, the word "print" covers
all the various forms of art work done
by transferring from a printing plate.
A print might be a lithograph, a dry
point, an etching, or a wood block.
On the other hand, etchings refer
to prints that are done by producing
a picture on a zinc or copper plate by
etching it in. The lines in these etch
ings are then filled with printing ink
and transferred by means of an etch
ing press to dampened paper. This
dampened paper pulls the ink from
the grooves in the etching, thus trans
ferring the picture to the paper.
Next to working directly on canvas
or paper with oil or water color, etch
ing is considered the artists' best
method of producing individual and
original work. Experienced etchers al
ways print a limited edition.
Collectors agree that a good print
is more desirable than a mediocre
painting. By means of etching a mas
ter artist is able to produce a number
of good presentations of his own work,
while with painting only one is gen
erally made.
Rembrandt and Whistler were mas
ter artists, who made etching one of
their hobbies. There is an old saying
which reads —"On an artist's off days
he paints, on his good ones, he etches."
