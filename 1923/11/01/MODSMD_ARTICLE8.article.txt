# Is a Dink a Hat? New Problem in Deportment Before Freshman Class

A great problem has presented itself
! to the freshmen. In fact, it is a prob
lem that has presented itself to all
Freshman Classes, in the dim past of
Stanford.
The question is as follows: Should
freshmen tip their "dinks" when greet
ing a lady on the street? On inter
viewing several of the most prominent
men of the peagreeners we were able
to draw the conclusion that it was
considered undesirable to raise the
'•dink" or make any motion towards it
with the hands when greeting a fair
damsel.
Or to quote Ezra Labonsky, one of
1 the thinkers of the class: "In the first
place, the Book of Etiquette says that
only wearing apparel for the head shall
; raised when passing a lady on the
street. The 'dink' is not wearing ap
j parel, it neither keeps off the rain or
the sun, nor does it shade the eyes,
or protect the face and neck from the
sun —in other words, it is an ornament.
"Secondly, its structure is unfit for
the time-honored custom of 'tipping
the hat.'
"However, some of the rougher ele
ments can be quoted as saying, 'Tip
the "dink," Say fellow, most of the
freshmen can't, they don't wear their
1 'dinks'."
