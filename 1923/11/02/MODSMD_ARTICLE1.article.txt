# SHAW'S 'ANDROCLES' IS SEASON'S FIRST OFFERING TONIGHT
## Bayley and Chalmers, in Comedy Roles, Are Expected to Add Forcefulness to Play 
### Allan Charles 
At 8:20 tonight, the curtain parts for "Androeles and the Lion," significant
to the campus as a satirical comedy by George Bernard Shaw, the opening
play of the dramatic season, and the first piece directed by Gordon Davis since
his return from the professional stage.
This play, which critics consider one of Shaw's select few, is an intellectual
farce in a romantic situation. The success of the farce alone can be secured
from a reading of the play; the efficacy is greatly increased when the per
sonalities of Arnold Bayley and Hollis Chalmers are added to the principal
comedy roles. "Androeles and the Lion" is in its entirety, comedy; although
there is a profundity of thought running continually underneath the play, it
never comes to the surface in disquisitive speeches. Shaw probably expects
that his audiences will do most of their reflecting on Christianity after the firm
grip of his farce has been released, which time should not come until the
curtains draw together after the last act.
Sword and Sandals has procured about as strong a cast for the presentation
as can be assembled on the campus for any one play. Besides Bayley and
Chalmers, who play the title roles, the cast includes David Mannoccir, David
Latnson, Norris James, Charles Parks and Murray Ward â€”all of whom have
appeared before in principal roles in Assembly hall shows. Helen Lewis,
who is new to the campus playgoer, carries the feminine lead. Her features,
expression, and poise ideally fit her for Lavinia, the fair Christian martyr
The surest comedy exchange runs between Bayley, the "Lion," and Chalmers,
the "Androeles." People who have seen the rehearsals assert that to see
these two Ram's Head veterans alone is worth a ten-mile walk.

Rehearsals Are Smooth
That Davis has been able to weld
the show together in less than three
weeks is some proof of the order, har
mony, and consequent smoothness
which pervades the Assembly hall dar
ing rehearsals, and which is strikingly
apparent to the outsider. Davis has
been able to concentrate for some time
on the expression of lines and situa
tions, and the loss of humorous lines
through inadequate emphasis will
surely be small.
Chrysella Dunker is in charge of
the art work of the play. In addition
to directing the painting and the mak
ing of the costumes, she has designed
the first-act set. The second-act set
was fashioned and constructed by Ed
ward Farmer. This play is also the
first one under the supervision of Ed
Butler, dramatic business manager,
and Fred Hughes, stage manager.
