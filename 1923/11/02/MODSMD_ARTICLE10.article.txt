gathering of college men and women
in the pavilion. There was 110 Andro
cles to tame him so he went wild and
set. everyone else wild —with delight.
Arnold Bayley. minus the lion's skin
for a few moments, addressed the
rooters at the rally on the "great fun
damental principles" which make up
college life. He showed how these
"two great forces" should he welded
together in support of a football team.
In conclusion, he gave the harmonious
selection, "We're Sailing Up the Bay,"

instrument of his own invention.

"Scotchy" Campbell in the final speech

of the evening. "That one defeat is

just as Washington's defeat of U. S. C
helped the southern team." With these ;
parting words and a promise that no

rooters to brace up the team. Stanford

on the nose and is more full of fight
now than before the blow took effect."
