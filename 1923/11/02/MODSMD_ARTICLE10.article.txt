### Howard Bissell 
A lion was rampant on the campus
last night and invaded a conventional
gathering of college men and women
in the pavilion. There was 110 Andro
cles to tame him so he went wild and
set. everyone else wild —with delight.
Arnold Bayley. minus the lion's skin
for a few moments, addressed the
rooters at the rally on the "great fun
damental principles" which make up
college life. He showed how these
"two great forces" should he welded
together in support of a football team.
In conclusion, he gave the harmonious
selection, "We're Sailing Up the Bay,"
on the Bayley pipe*organ, an intricate
instrument of his own invention.
With such a starter, the audience
gathered pep and evolved much noiso
before (lie grand finale.
"U. S. C. won the game last Satur
day, but that is no reason to think
they had the best team," said Captain
"Scotchy" Campbell in the final speech

of the evening. "That one defeat is
going to do us more good than harm,
just as Washington's defeat of U. S. C
helped the southern team." With these ;
parting words and a promise that no
! more punts will be blocked this sea
-1 son, Campbell retired from the plat
form. Real spontaneous cheering burst
forth from the rooters, giving a good
| idea of the revived spirit of the crowd,
j bolstered up marvelously by the in
vigorating speeches of the evening.
"The team is against the wall now,"
| said A1 Masters. "It rests with the
rooters to brace up the team. Stanford
i is like a boxer who has been cracked
on the nose and is more full of fight
now than before the blow took effect."

date 72.000 people have been made

the Big Game. One train has been se
cured for Stanford students and will
by those going. It will go north to

Dumbarton, cross the bridge, and then

M want to compliment Burt Lapp on
the performance of the rooting section
last Saturday," said Dud DeGroot. "I
have heard nothing like it in the four
years I have been here. But you were
too confident and then when we lost
became rather discouraged. Everyone
ought to keep up his spirit and have
something good to say to the members
of the team for their good perform
ances, even if they don't win.
"U. S. C. won the game Saturday,
but they did so on poor football," said
"Dink" Templeton. "It was simply luck
that blocked our punts and it was that
that made it hurt to lose. Our season
is not wrecked. Only one game can
wreck our season and that is the Cali
fornia contest on November 24. We
will go into that game with no false
idea of our strength. It will be a bet
ter team than the one on the field last
week, and it will be a team that will

present but one defeat."
Burt Lapp requested that students
continue to wear their rooting hats at
the games in order to practice for the
Big Game. The freshman orchestra
furnished music for the occasion and
the musicians' efforts added punch to
the rally.
