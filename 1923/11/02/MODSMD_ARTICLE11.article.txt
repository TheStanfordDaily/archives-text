California had a difficult time beat

16-0. The Bears had to be satisfied
with one touchdown and three drop
kicks by Blewett, all of which came
in the second half. The Agnetion Club
was able to hold the to a tie
score last Sunday.
In training, Stanford should be bet

this little item many times is enough
to decide a close contest. It was pre
