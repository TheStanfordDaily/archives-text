# CARDS, OLYMPICS BATTLE TOMORROW
## STANFORD VARSITY WILL PROFIT FROM TROJAN TROUNCING Bob Evans Is Sending His Strongest Team Against Kerr's Eleven; Many Stars Are in Lineup 
### David Meiklejohn 
Vol. G4. No. 25

Bob Evans, former Stanford coach and at present Olympic Club pigskin
mentor, confidently believes that his club eleven will give the Cardinal varsity
a worse trouncing than did U. S. C., when the two teams line up in the
otadium at 2:30 tomorrow.
Some critics are disposed to disagree politely with Evans. In the firstplace,
his Olympic Club squad has failed to make any startling showing this year,
and secondly, Stanford is prepared to forget the U. S. C. contest and give the
Olympics every ounce of football competition it possesses.
Stanford is more dangerous than ever after the defeat at the hands of the
Trojans. The players have come to realize that publicity, as the greatest
Card team ever produced on the Farm, will not win football games. Andy
Kerr is making shifts where shifting is needed, and in general the spirit of
the squad should be increased two-fold.
At the same time Andy Kerr recently stated that he refused to sacrifice his
men, to the extent of lasting injuries, in order to beat the Olympic Club.
There were glaring weaknesses in the Cardinal line last Saturday and it
took a hard contest to bring them to light. Stanford made a slight mistake

in selecting an easy pre-conference
grid schedule against secondary com
petition, but, Andy Kerr said recent
ly, "It is the future in which we are
concerned —not the past."
Club Has Good Kicker
Clyde King, Olympic Club captain
and left tackle, has recovered from in
juries received in former games and
will be in the line-up tomorrow. King
is a dependable drop-kicker
California had a difficult time beat
ing the Olympic Club three weeks ago,
16-0. The Bears had to be satisfied
with one touchdown and three drop
kicks by Blewett, all of which came
in the second half. The Agnetion Club
was able to hold the to a tie
score last Sunday.
In training, Stanford should be bet
ter advanced than the Olympics, and
this little item many times is enough
to decide a close contest. It was pre
cisely what was the matter with the
Club team against California. It held
out like a stone wall in the firßt half
and let the Bruins trample over it in
the second period due to poor condi
tion.
Last year, the club men defeated
Stanford 27-9 in a rather hectic con
test. It was the first game of the sea
son for the Cards, and experience of
the Olympic players gave them the
deciding push. This year they meet in
the middle of the season, and Stan
ford, with four games oif the schedule,
will have more than an even break.
Jim Lawson will not be at left end
on account of injuries; his place wiil
be taken by Norman Dole, one of the
fastest men oil the Card squad. Dole
does not possess the faculties of Jim
Lawson for getting under passes, but
aside from that, he is a hard tackier,
and a dependable linesman. Howard
Mitchell is taking Campbell's position
at quarterback.
Probable line-up:
Stanford— Olympic Club-
Thomas LE Logan
Shipkey LT King
Cravens LG Daly
Baker C Miller
Dole RE Dickey
Neill RT Avery
Ludeke RG P. Smith
