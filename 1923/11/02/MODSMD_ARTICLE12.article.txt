# SAN LUIS OBISPO IS SLATED FOR CLASH WITH FROSH ELEVEN
## Regulars Will Watch Bear Freshmen; Third Team To Play Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's babes will meet the Cali
fornia Polytechnic school eleven of
San Luis Obispo in a preliminary to
the varsity-Olympic game at 12:30 to
morrow afternoon. Second and third
string freshmen will be used in order
that the first team men may get a rest
before playing the California freshmen
in the "Little Big Game" a week from
tomorrow.
The San Luis Obispo team is strong
and fast and would probably give the
first team men some stiff competition.!
However, a victory tomorrow is not
worth risking injuries to first string
men, so Hunt is taking no chances
which might result in handicapping
the team in its most important game
of the season.
Babes to Watch Cubs Play
Since the California team is playing
at Berkeley tomorrow, Hunt is allow
ing the regulars to make the trip to
Berkeley to watch the Blue and Gold
youngsters in action. A few of the
first squad, who remain at Stanford
over the week-end may be used in
the game These men are Herth, end;
Mann, quarter; Poulson and Toffel
mier, tackles; Scott, guard; Doerr,
halfback; Maemillan, fullback.
