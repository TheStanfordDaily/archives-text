# SAN LUIS OBISPO IS SLATED FOR CLASH WITH FROSH ELEVEN
## Regulars Will Watch Bear Freshmen; Third Team To Play Tomorrow 
### 
Stanford's babes will meet the Cali
fornia Polytechnic school eleven of
San Luis Obispo in a preliminary to
the varsity-Olympic game at 12:30 to
morrow afternoon. Second and third
string freshmen will be used in order
that the first team men may get a rest
before playing the California freshmen
in the "Little Big Game" a week from
tomorrow.
The San Luis Obispo team is strong
and fast and would probably give the
first team men some stiff competition.!
However, a victory tomorrow is not
worth risking injuries to first string
men, so Hunt is taking no chances
which might result in handicapping
the team in its most important game
of the season.
Babes to Watch Cubs Play
Since the California team is playing
at Berkeley tomorrow, Hunt is allow
ing the regulars to make the trip to
Berkeley to watch the Blue and Gold
youngsters in action. A few of the
first squad, who remain at Stanford
over the week-end may be used in
the game These men are Herth, end;
Mann, quarter; Poulson and Toffel
mier, tackles; Scott, guard; Doerr,
halfback; Maemillan, fullback.
The babes will outweigh the south
erners by a comfortable margin. The
men on the freshman line will aver
age about 180, while the San Luis
team will not weigh more than 170.
With such an advantage in weight,
the freshmen should be given some
odds.
Raffetto to Start
Raffeto, a 200-pounder, is slated to
start at tackle for the Babes. He was
injured early in the season and is just
rounding into shape again. From ap
pearances, he seems to have lots of
possibilities and should develop into
a good man. Hodges, also a 200-pound
man, will start at guard for the Poly
team.
The Stanford team, as tentatively
selected by Hunt after practice yes
terday, is as follows: Graham, center;
Macabee and Chappelet, guards; Raf
fetto and Poulson, tackles; Herth and
Lumquist, ends; Smythe, quarter;
Doerr and Joseph, halfbacks; and
Wool, fullback.
Lumquist at end is a valuable man
and is expected to give a good account
of himself. In the backfield, the two
outstanding players are Doerr and
Smythe. Doerr has shown a lot of
class in practice, and has speed
enough to get away from opposing
tacklers.
Smythe at Quarter for Babes
Smythe will call the signals. He is
a heady leader, and will make a good
field general for the babes. In addi
tion to the men already mentioned,
Hunt expects to use many substitutes,
all of whom have had experience in
second and third team games during
the past month.
Little is known of the individuals
on the Poly team. E. Patchett, the cap
tain, will direct the team from the
quarterback position. He is big enough
to cause the '27 line some worry,
tipping the scales at 170. He is the
heaviest man in the backfield, the
weights of the other backs varying
from 138 to 165.
The probable line-up for the Poly
men will be: Young, center; Hodges,
Langenbeck, guards; Reich, Morison,
tackles; Carroll and Flugger, end; E.

Patchett, quarter; H. Patchett, Eve
leth, halfbacks; Lumley, fullback.
The Poly players have been defeated
but once this season. This came at
the hands of "Swede" Righter's Col
lege of the Pacific eleven, a team
which the first string babes had little
trouble in defeating. The San Jose
Teachers College team met defeat at
the San Luis boys' hands by a score
of 14-0. The babes won from this
team 71-0.

the game These men are Herth, end;
Mann, quarter; Poulson and Toffel
mier, tackles; Scott, guard; Doerr,
halfback; Maemillan, fullback.
The babes will outweigh the south
erners by a comfortable margin. The
men on the freshman line will aver
age about 180, while the San Luis
team will not weigh more than 170.
With such an advantage in weight,
the freshmen should be given some
odds.
Raffetto to Start
Raffeto, a 200-pounder, is slated to
start at tackle for the Babes. He was
injured early in the season and is just
rounding into shape again. From ap
pearances, he seems to have lots of
possibilities and should develop into
a good man. Hodges, also a 200-pound
man, will start at guard for the Poly
team.
The Stanford team, as tentatively
selected by Hunt after practice yes
terday, is as follows: Graham, center;
Macabee and Chappelet, guards; Raf
fetto and Poulson, tackles; Herth and
Lumquist, ends; Smythe, quarter;
Doerr and Joseph, halfbacks; and
Wool, fullback.
Lumquist at end is a valuable man
and is expected to give a good account
of himself. In the backfield, the two
outstanding players are Doerr and
Smythe. Doerr has shown a lot of
class in practice, and has speed
enough to get away from opposing
tacklers.
Smythe at Quarter for Babes
Smythe will call the signals. He is
a heady leader, and will make a good
field general for the babes. In addi
tion to the men already mentioned,
Hunt expects to use many substitutes,
all of whom have had experience in
second and third team games during
the past month.
Little is known of the individuals
on the Poly team. E. Patchett, the cap
tain, will direct the team from the
quarterback position. He is big enough
to cause the '27 line some worry,
tipping the scales at 170. He is the
heaviest man in the backfield, the
weights of the other backs varying
from 138 to 165.
The probable line-up for the Poly
men will be: Young, center; Hodges,
Langenbeck, guards; Reich, Morison,
tackles; Carroll and Flugger, end; E.

Patchett, quarter; H. Patchett, Eve
leth, halfbacks; Lumley, fullback.
The Poly players have been defeated
but once this season. This came at
the hands of "Swede" Righter's Col
lege of the Pacific eleven, a team
which the first string babes had little
trouble in defeating. The San Jose
Teachers College team met defeat at
the San Luis boys' hands by a score
of 14-0. The babes won from this
team 71-0.
Stanford's babes will meet the Cali
fornia Polytechnic school eleven of
San Luis Obispo in a preliminary to
the varsity-Olympic game at 12:30 to
morrow afternoon. Second and third
string freshmen will be used in order
that the first team men may get a rest
before playing the California freshmen
in the "Little Big Game" a week from
tomorrow.
The San Luis Obispo team is strong
and fast and would probably give the
first team men some stiff competition.!
However, a victory tomorrow is not
worth risking injuries to first string
men, so Hunt is taking no chances
which might result in handicapping
the team in its most important game
of the season.
Babes to Watch Cubs Play
Since the California team is playing
at Berkeley tomorrow, Hunt is allow
ing the regulars to make the trip to
Berkeley to watch the Blue and Gold
youngsters in action. A few of the
first squad, who remain at Stanford
over the week-end may be used in
the game These men are Herth, end;
Mann, quarter; Poulson and Toffel
mier, tackles; Scott, guard; Doerr,
halfback; Maemillan, fullback.
The babes will outweigh the south
