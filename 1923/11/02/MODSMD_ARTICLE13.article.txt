# BABE SOCCER MEN ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET RANGERS TEAM
## 
### 
The 1927 soccer team will have its
hands full tomorrow when it tackles the
speedy Rangers' eleven. The place of
meeting has not yet been definitely set
tled, although it will probably be in the
Golden Gate Park stadium or on St.
Ignatius field. This is a regular game in
the second division of the University and
Club Soccer League.
With a reorganized defense, the frosh
have an excellent chance of beating the
Rangers tomorrow. The shifting of
David to full-back has materially aided
in the strengthening process. Miron, who
played on the freshman eleven last year,
is eligible, and will play inside right.
Aside from these changes, and the shift
ing of Bushness to center half, the babes'
lineup will remain the same.
Those who will face the Rangers to
morrow are: Forrest, goal; C. Francis,
fullback; David, fullback; M. Smythe,
right half; Bushness, center half; Cole
man, left half; Page, outside left;
Strong, inside left; Bailard (captain),
center forward; Miron, inside right; and
West, outside right.
