# A 						Law School for Lawyers
## 
### 
The Law Department tossed a little bomb-shell to
the general culture students Tuesday when it an
nounced that requirements for admission to classes
in legal subjects would be raised to permit enrollment
only of men in search of professional law training.
f It is regrettable that students of business be barred
from the valuable insight into legal reasoning and
legal problems such as a thorough study of the law
of contracts gives. However, the general course in
"Business Law" will be offered as usual, and al
though the principles of contracts, agency, and ne
gotiable instruments are necessarily covered some
what hastily, still the future financiers and entre
preneurs will probably learn when to hike for a
lawyer.
The whole significance of the action of the law
faculty is that it indicates the growing strength of
Stanford's professional schools. The character of
the men on the faculty and the standard of training
maintained attract students from all parts of the
country. And when the resulting increase in the
enrollment of the professional schools overtaves fa
cilities and threatens the efficiency of instruction, it
is obviously necessary to limit classes to those choos
ing the particular profession for their life-work.
There is need to differentiate between Stanford
professional schools and the rest of the University.
This cannot be accomplished alone by the custom of
talking things over on the Law steps or "piping the
flight" at the Engineers' corner. In the professions
personal abilities are brought into sharper competi
tion than in the general field of commerce where
so many foreign factors enter into success. So it
is desirable that a more serious frame of mind be
developed by professional students and raising re
quirements and standards of scholarship is one
method.
• Stanford stands high among those American uni
versities which refuse to hand out learning to all
who can squeeze through the classroom door. Men
will be graduated from her professional departments
who are really trained in their work, even, if in
doing this, classes must be limited and some students
turned away.
Sometime in the near future a new law building
will rise on the corner opposite the engineering
structure, and perhaps by that time there will be
enough money to enlarge the teaching staff. Then
students wishing to complete their general education
or training for business with a few courses in law
will be welcomed. But in the meantime the Law
School must continue to concentrate its efforts in
turning out men fitted for practice at the American
bar. —R. E.

The Law Department tossed a little bomb-shell to
the general culture students Tuesday when it an
nounced that requirements for admission to classes
in legal subjects would be raised to permit enrollment
only of men in search of professional law training.
f It is regrettable that students of business be barred
from the valuable insight into legal reasoning and
legal problems such as a thorough study of the law
of contracts gives. However, the general course in
"Business Law" will be offered as usual, and al
though the principles of contracts, agency, and ne
gotiable instruments are necessarily covered some
what hastily, still the future financiers and entre
preneurs will probably learn when to hike for a
lawyer.
The whole significance of the action of the law
faculty is that it indicates the growing strength of
Stanford's professional schools. The character of
the men on the faculty and the standard of training
maintained attract students from all parts of the
country. And when the resulting increase in the
enrollment of the professional schools overtaves fa
cilities and threatens the efficiency of instruction, it
is obviously necessary to limit classes to those choos
ing the particular profession for their life-work.
There is need to differentiate between Stanford
professional schools and the rest of the University.
This cannot be accomplished alone by the custom of
talking things over on the Law steps or "piping the
flight" at the Engineers' corner. In the professions
personal abilities are brought into sharper competi
tion than in the general field of commerce where
so many foreign factors enter into success. So it
is desirable that a more serious frame of mind be
developed by professional students and raising re
quirements and standards of scholarship is one
method.
• Stanford stands high among those American uni
versities which refuse to hand out learning to all
who can squeeze through the classroom door. Men
will be graduated from her professional departments
who are really trained in their work, even, if in
doing this, classes must be limited and some students
turned away.
Sometime in the near future a new law building
will rise on the corner opposite the engineering
structure, and perhaps by that time there will be
enough money to enlarge the teaching staff. Then
students wishing to complete their general education
or training for business with a few courses in law
will be welcomed. But in the meantime the Law
School must continue to concentrate its efforts in
turning out men fitted for practice at the American
bar. —R. E.
