# The 						Backfire

Honest criticism is always welcomed by people
who realize their faults and are not afraid to admit
them. It is certainly unfair to criticize those whose
work cannot be up to the standard the critic expects,
but for the ones censured to stand up and claim
ignorance on the part of the critic is often a further
reflection on the ability and confidence of those
making- the claim.

Those who heard the new band give its first con
cert in the Union Court yesterday do not need to be
told that an organization which devotes itself ex
clusively to the pleasure of others is worthy of all
praise and much support.
