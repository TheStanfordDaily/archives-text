the sailor said when he fell from the top of the mast.
Horace, the sorority's confidant door-mat, said the
girls put a dictaphone in the rose garden the night of
their last informal —"just to find out what the roughs
really do say." Too bad some rough didn't know the

There are three kinds of girls: This kind, that kind,
and the other kind.
This kind says, "Isn't the moon lovely?"
That kind says, "I don't like to talk while I'm dancing,
do you?"
The other kind says—nothing (for a while).

We Swears Off
The other day
me and Henry
and Mike was
all struck
with the idear
of swearin' off
"'~t smokin'.
' r Bein' men of action we
decides to form a non
smokin' club, and I
makes the rules that
, none of us is to smoke
'"%■ until Big Game night,
and if any bozo does, he
is fined two bits for
""'l.. every jolt, and further
\ \ and more I is to be
treasurer. We is to
spend the kitty for a din
-7- ner on the night of the
-iS,:,nrr* t h e gamei "«♦,
How is we to find out if any
* bozo is breakin' the rule asts
Henry and Mike says we could
smell his breath every night.
Henry says that way ain't no
good because he could cover up
his breath and you couldn't
, / , | tell. I says sure, brush your
teeth first, and Henry answers
no that ain't no good—what
; ' should ought to do is to eat
• peanuts. So we has to let the
J**.i *
Honor System prevail.
We smokes up all our coffin-nails
that night, and bids a fond fare the
well to Nicotine.
Next day Henry comes to me and
says have I got change of a dollar
because he owes four bits to the
kitty. Mike only chips in a quarter.
The next day Henry was in six bits
worth and Mike one buck on account of
bein' around the Press Buildin' so much.
I gives 'em all receipts and a stick o'
chewin' gum, but it don't save 'em none.
Both of 'em comes around the next mornin'
and wants to withdraw. I offers to let them pay
their way out like they does in the navy, but
they says they're broke and you can't get no
blood out of a brick.
I don't see the both of 'em for a couple days,
and when I finely does they both smells strong
of peanuts. N
So I takes the kitty and buys me another carton of
weeds so as I won't be out of them when the boys ast
me for one. —SCORP.

The next day Henry was in six bits
worth and Mike one buck on account of
bein' around the Press Buildin' so much.
I gives 'em all receipts and a stick o'
chewin' gum, but it don't save 'em none.
Both of 'em comes around the next mornin'
and wants to withdraw. I offers to let them pay
their way out like they does in the navy, but
they says they're broke and you can't get no
blood out of a brick.
I don't see the both of 'em for a couple days,
and when I finely does they both smells strong
of peanuts. N

weeds so as I won't be out of them when the boys ast
me for one. —SCORP.
