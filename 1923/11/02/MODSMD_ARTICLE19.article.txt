# COME ALIVE, DR. JEKYLL

### 
It would seem that Dr Jekyll is incapable of reading
with ordinary intelligence and comprehension. His
statement regarding "extravagant praise of last week
end's affair" proves that. The Skull and Snakes jolly-up
was not. mentioned, and no isolated instance need ever
be mentioned in supporting the jolly-up tradition. Every
thing has its ups and downs, and scattered incidents of
a slightly unsavory nature have provided the doctor
with grounds upon which he may base his arguments.
The general average of jolly-up excellence, however, is
quite enough to Speak well for these maligned events,
without resorting to extraordinarily successful examples.
Dr. Jekyll is inclined to think that Saturday's party was
far above the average. Others think that it was un
usually well managed, but that the average good time
per capita was about as usual.
It is delightful to observe Dr. Jekyll slipping. He
devotes a paragraph to stunned admiration of the Skull
and Snakes blow-out, catches himself with a start, and
attempts to transfer the blame to (pardon my blushes)
Mr. Hyde. He asks me to "see if it is really the kind of
a closed-date social affair Stanford wants." Certainly
it is. I saw that last Saturday evening, and so would
Dr. Jekyll had he been willing too. If Stanford didn't
want it, would it have been the indisputable success that
it was? Perhaps Dr. Jekyll doesn't want it â€”that's a
horse of a different hue.
I think that the whole shriveled soul of Dr. Jekyll
cries out in the last paragraph of "Whoa, Mr. Hyde."
With the pertinent and penetrating comment "There's
no use taking chances," he prays that no other campus
organization be allowed to stage jolly-ups, as there
might be disastrous results. What daring spirit! What
a progressive policy! What utter bunk!
Or perhaps Dr. Jekyll realizes that, in the fulfillment
of his impossible scheme, the jolly-up would perish with
the graduation of the present members of Skull and
Snakes. Thus does he promote the welfare of Stanford.
