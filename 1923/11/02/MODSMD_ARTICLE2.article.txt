# SOPHOMORE ELEVEN WILL MEET JUNIORS SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
The sophomore and junior grid elevens
clash tomorrow morning at 10:15 in the
second round of the interclass football
series. Both squads have been put
through hard scrimmage this week, in
the attempt to eliminate the poor inter
ference and tackling displayed last Sat
urday, and both coaches have promised
better showings.
A number of men on both elevens are
showing up well. The juniors are led by
"Dutch" McAllister, captain. Behind him
in the backfield are Tom Alexander, who
is a powerful line plunger and shifty
open-field runner, and Mason, at full
back. It was the latter that caused the
yearling gridmen so much trouble in their
passing game last Saturday.
On the line are Shelly, left, who plays
end and is a consistent tackier;
Williston, guard, who opens most
of the holes on offense; Myers, centcr;
A1 Jergins, tackle; and Dick Coen, one
of the best all-around ends developed in
the interclass contests.
The second-year men began the season
with two of last year's frosh to form
the nucleus of the squadâ€”George Stev
enson, 'a fast wingman, and Cliff Cam
eron, duhbed by his team-mates "Gi
bralter," at tackle.
Maxwell Stevenson and Cole at guards
are developing rapidly as is Smith, right
end. In the center of this wall is Hood,
a man that is hard to get over, around,
or under and proves good interference
for his mates in the backfield.
Morgan, at half, is one of the few
triple-threat men in the series, and is
aided by Autcalt, who hits the line fast
and hard. Hastings, fullback, makes his
gains through the line also, and is worked
alternately at that position with Nichol
son.
A comparison of weights of the two
elevens shows that neither will have an
advantages in that direction in the back
field secondary walls tipping the scales
at an average of 160 pounds. The junior
line outweighs its opponents by five
pounds, however, weighing in at 165.

The entering class at Dartmouth
this year, consisting of 595 freshmen,
came from 329 different schools, with
186 schools represented by only one
student, and the largest delegation
from a single school but fourteen.
