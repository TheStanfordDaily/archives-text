# SOPHOMORE ELEVEN WILL MEET JUNIORS SATURDAY MORNING
## 
### 
The sophomore and junior grid elevens
clash tomorrow morning at 10:15 in the
second round of the interclass football
series. Both squads have been put
through hard scrimmage this week, in
the attempt to eliminate the poor inter
ference and tackling displayed last Sat
urday, and both coaches have promised
better showings.
A number of men on both elevens are
showing up well. The juniors are led by
"Dutch" McAllister, captain. Behind him
in the backfield are Tom Alexander, who
is a powerful line plunger and shifty
open-field runner, and Mason, at full
back. It was the latter that caused the
yearling gridmen so much trouble in their
passing game last Saturday.
On the line are Shelly, left, who plays
end and is a consistent tackier;
Williston, guard, who opens most
of the holes on offense; Myers, centcr;
A1 Jergins, tackle; and Dick Coen, one
of the best all-around ends developed in
