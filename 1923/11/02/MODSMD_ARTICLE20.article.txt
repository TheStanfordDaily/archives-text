# A 						WOMAN SAYS
## 
### 
Agreement is unanimous for once in
history, that nothing makes men look
worse than rooters' hats, but every
body likes to see the men wear them.
Is this just because the women are
catty and want to see the men at their
worst? Hardly! There is one occasion
on which all small prejudices are for
gotten, when the individual welfare is
merged into the good of the whole,
and that time is when Stanford as a
unit presents a united front to the
world —when any athletic contest is
in progress. One thinks of the rooting
section presenting a mass of red,
flaunting Stanford colors in the face
of the opponents, and not as individual
men the beauty of whose particular
style of facial architecture is not en
hanced by wearing a round nob on the
top of the head.
Women are more critical of appear
ances than men (at times), and are
particularly careful of how they look
themselves. So last year when at the
Big Game women wore their special
rooters' caps which made them look
as if they were doubling for bellhops,
there was a storm oC disapproval be
cause they looked "so awful." The
truth of the matter is that they didn't
care so much themselves what they
looked like as they did about how the
men thought they looked. Before the
game this year, it is certain that their
vanity will be overcome by their spirit,
and any woman will be only too glad
of the opportunity to wear a rooter's
cap and tell the world they're from
Stanford. The main consideration is
not how the individuals look but how
our rooting section looks to the oppos
ing calamity howlers. A woman's root
ing section would add considerably to
the appearance of the bleachers and
it's a pleasure to wear the Stanford
red anyway, so what's the odds!
