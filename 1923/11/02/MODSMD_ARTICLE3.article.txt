# First French Record Of Hoover's After-War Relief Work Received
## 
### 
The first French record of the
after-war relief work of Herbert
Hoover and the American Relief
Administration since the armistice
has been received by the Hoover
War Library. The data was com
piled by Suzanne Ferriere, assist
ant Secretary of the Save the Chil
dren Fund International Union, in a
volume entitled "Les Etats-Unis au
Secours de I/Europe, 1918-1923."
Miss Ferriere takes up the relief
work of the American Relief Ad
ministration in its initial stages
from November, 1918, to June, 1919.
She tells of the work of the Euro
pean Children's Fund, which up to
the summer of 1919 had fed 4,000,-
000 children in eleven different Eu
ropean countries. During 1919-21 the
administration fed a total of 5,910,-
04)0 children in addition to giving
aid to a large number of adults in
the war-ravaged countries.
The cost of this huge undertak
ing in philanthropy was met by the
voluntary subscriptions of hundreds
of thousands of individuals and so
cieties in the United States.
An account of the aid given Rus
sia, Poland, and Czecho-Slovakia
concludes Miss Ferriere's descrip
tion of the relief work.
