# KNICKERS WIN OVER CORDS
## Stanford Women Claim Knee-Lengths Are Neater; "Cords Are Too Dirty" 
### Aileen Hicks 
Stanford women prefer to see men
in knickers rather than cords, accord
ing to statements made by a number of
campus women Much dissension has
been stirred up over the proposition
and two parties have been formed.
"Cords!" shouts one faction. "Knick
ers!" shrieks the other,
A census of the "500" as to their at
titude on the question will be taken,
and so end the controversy forever.
In the meantime, the verbal battle
rages. Knickers made the men look
neat and clean, and also show their
legs to advantage, while cords do
neither. Good-looking men profit espe
cially from the innovation, it is con
tended, but of course if some are 1
blessed with bow-legs, people have to
overlook them. In other words, knick
ers are quite the Turkish.
"Cords Are Too Dirty"
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness"
is the feminine opinion, and since
Stanford men can never be expected
to attain the latter state of perfection,
they can at least be clean. The soiled,
besmeared condition of the cords
seems to be the main objection to
them.
Juniors never wash their cords be-1
cause they want the public to think
they are accustomed to wearing them
and seniors only wash them at distant (
intervals.
There is unanimous agreement on
the proposition that cords make for

democracy, because one cannot tell
the state of a man's pocketbook by the
kind of trousers he wears, if cords
are worn. The item of economy is also
important, because cords ARE cheap.
Although this is commendable, beauty
should not be sacrificed to economy.
"Overalls Would Be Ritzy"
Seniors and juniors could wear
knickers, sophomores, cords, and
freshmen, just pants, is the plan
evolved by some feminine Portia. Oth
ers contend that overalls for seniors
would be "Ritzy," because of Stanford
being known as the "Farm." The only
difficulty would be that overalls are al
ways associated with sunbonnets, so
senior women would have to don that
f-tyle of headgear, which wouldn't be
too good. The more facetious ladies
have suggested that Turkish bloomers i
or Scotch kilts would be a stunning
costume for the men.
But Cords Are Tradition
Opposition can always be found to
any idea, so the minority contends
that cords are a Stanford tradition and
distinctive of Stanford men, and there
fore should not be replaced. Further
more, cords tend to give Stanford a
businesslike air, where work and not
play is paramount.
The concensus of opinion, however,'
is that no matter what the women
think, the men will do just as they
please (as usual). But there's no harm
in voicing the feminine opinion "where
the winds of freedom blow."

they are accustomed to wearing them
and seniors only wash them at distant (
intervals.
There is unanimous agreement on
the proposition that cords make for

democracy, because one cannot tell
the state of a man's pocketbook by the
kind of trousers he wears, if cords
are worn. The item of economy is also
important, because cords ARE cheap.
Although this is commendable, beauty
should not be sacrificed to economy.
"Overalls Would Be Ritzy"
Seniors and juniors could wear
knickers, sophomores, cords, and
freshmen, just pants, is the plan
evolved by some feminine Portia. Oth
ers contend that overalls for seniors
would be "Ritzy," because of Stanford
being known as the "Farm." The only
difficulty would be that overalls are al
ways associated with sunbonnets, so
senior women would have to don that
f-tyle of headgear, which wouldn't be
too good. The more facetious ladies
have suggested that Turkish bloomers i
or Scotch kilts would be a stunning
costume for the men.
But Cords Are Tradition
Opposition can always be found to
any idea, so the minority contends
that cords are a Stanford tradition and
distinctive of Stanford men, and there
fore should not be replaced. Further
more, cords tend to give Stanford a
businesslike air, where work and not
play is paramount.
The concensus of opinion, however,'
is that no matter what the women
think, the men will do just as they
please (as usual). But there's no harm
in voicing the feminine opinion "where
the winds of freedom blow."
Stanford women prefer to see men
in knickers rather than cords, accord
ing to statements made by a number of
campus women Much dissension has
been stirred up over the proposition
and two parties have been formed.
"Cords!" shouts one faction. "Knick
ers!" shrieks the other,
A census of the "500" as to their at
titude on the question will be taken,
and so end the controversy forever.
In the meantime, the verbal battle
rages. Knickers made the men look
neat and clean, and also show their
legs to advantage, while cords do
neither. Good-looking men profit espe
cially from the innovation, it is con
tended, but of course if some are 1
blessed with bow-legs, people have to
overlook them. In other words, knick
ers are quite the Turkish.
"Cords Are Too Dirty"
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness"
is the feminine opinion, and since
Stanford men can never be expected
to attain the latter state of perfection,
they can at least be clean. The soiled,
besmeared condition of the cords
seems to be the main objection to
them.
Juniors never wash their cords be-1
cause they want the public to think
they are accustomed to wearing them
and seniors only wash them at distant (
intervals.
