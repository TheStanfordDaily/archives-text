# VARSITY SOCCERITES TO ENCOUNTER FAST NORWEGIAN ELEVEN
## 
### 
With a practice game and a league
contest scheduled for the week-end.
Coach Harry Maloney's soccer varsity
will spend a busy time. Tomorrow
afternoon at 4:15 on tho varsity field,
the fast Sons of Norway team will he
played in a regular game of the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League, while
the San Anselmo eleven will be tack-j
led in a practice set-to-this afternoon
at 4 o'clock.
With 2 games won and 2 lost, the
varsity must turn in a win over the,
Norwegian outfit if they wish to re
tain the championship won last year, i
At present, the Sons of Norway are
one of the top-notchers in the league,
so a fast contest should result. The
city team combines an accurate for
ward line with a steady backfield to a
great advantage. Earlier in the season
it defeated the Sons of St. George, who
in turn slipped over a 2-1 defeat on
the Cards.
However, the Cardinal eleven should
present a much stronger lineup than
in previous contests. During the past
week Coach Maloney has been experi
menting with the forward line, and a
co-ordinating offense should result.
The game with San Anselmo was
scheduled for the purpose of determin
ing the final selection for the game
with the Sons of Norway.
The San Anselmo team, represent
ing a small Presbyterian seminary
across the bay, should not offer much
competition. Two years ago, it suc
ceeded in throwing quite a scare into
the varsity, even though it was de
feated. Reports indicate a much
weaker team this year, however.
Although Maloney can make no final
selections, indications from practice
are that Captain Swayne will play
center forward. The rest of the for
ward line is uncertain, but Munford,
Richardson, and Hoover should be
seen in action some time during the
contests, Quigley and Cardoza are also
strong contenders for positions.
