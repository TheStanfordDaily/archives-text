## 
### 
Stanford's polo team yesterday de
feated Santa Cruz Polo club at Santa
Cruz 7-6. Cardinal men had difficulty in
the first three' periods of the game, but
before the last whistle, Barby, Irwin,
and Tremaine had scored sufficiently to
put the local mallet swingers ahead. The
second four from Stanford lost to the
substitute string of the clubmen, 7-0.
Return games with the two Santa Cruz
teams will be played tomorrow.
, Absence of side boards on the Santa
Cruz field, caused the Cardinal four some
difficulty during the first two periods,
and the clubmen had knocked in three
balls before Tremaine scored for Stan
ford in the fourth period. During the
rest of the game, the clubmen were out
played. Irwin made two goals in the
fourth, and Ralph Barby made three in
the fifth which put the locals in the lead.
Both teams scored once in the last few
minutes, giving Stanford the top side of
a 7-6 battle.
