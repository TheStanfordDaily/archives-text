# Scribes, Thespians To Compare Might In Great Grid Tiff
## 
### David Lamson 
"Ladies 'n gent'mun; The main!
event for this evening will be Ram's
Head varsity, undefeated champions!
of the Assembly hall, versus Sigma j
Delta Chi, terrors of the Press build
ing."
That is about the way it may sound
when the announcer does his stuff at
the rally scheduled for the Stadium at
4 o'clock Thursday, according to plans
of the Rally Committee.
Ram's Head versus Sigma Delta
Chi. Scribes vs: Thespians.
Both Teams Undefeated
Both teams are undefeated, neither
having played before. The prize at
stake is the championship of the Law
steps and the north corner of the
inner Quad. For this reason, the rival
squads are pointed squarely at each
other, and promise to stage the Battle
of the Century. If this is done, it will
be the fifty-seventh Battle of the Cen
tury to date.
Both teams are trained to a hair,
and the coming contest should be an
interesting exhibition of football as it
should not be played. The rival |
coaches, Andy Burr and Roomy
Cumbersome, are tapering their men
off this week. It is understood that
Sigma Delta Chi players are on a strict
diet of Bull Durham, while the Ram's
Head warriors have been going
through daily workouts on the pogo
sticks.
Lineups Are Uncertain
No hint of what the line-up will be
for either team has been given out by
coaches or captains It is certain that
the Ram's Head captain, "Kewp"
Sproul, will be tlifere or thereabouts;
while the Sigma Delta Chi skipper,
Norris James, one of the best ends
who ever spoiled a ribbon, will start
the game. Important revelations will
be made by both coaches before next
Wednesday.
"Whether or not we can find enough
pillows to pad our uniforms sufficient
ly is irrelevent, incompetent and im
material," said Carl Shoup, president
of Sigma Delta Chi, in speaking of the
game today. "The game will be played,
and will be played with might and
possibly main, although the eligibility
of the latter may be contested."
Rooters will be divided into two
sections, those who think Ram's Head
men are good actors on the right, and
those who believe Sigma Delta Chi's
to be good journalists on the left.
Stadium, 4 o'clock. Rally and exhi
bition game. Bring your own licorice.
