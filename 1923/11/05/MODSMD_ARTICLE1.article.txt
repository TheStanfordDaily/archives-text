# JOURNALISTS OF PRESS CLUB MERGE WITH SIGMA DELTA CHI
## TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED Both Groups Expect Benefit From Working as Single Unit 
### 
Sigma Delta Chi and Press Club have merged. Hereafter the name ''Press
Club" will be only a memory, but its power in campus activities is now com
bined with Sigma Delta Chi's national organization to make the Stanford
chapter of this nation-wide body the king-pin of campus journalistic organiza
tion.
The merger was effected simply enough, being the culmination of an efTort
started last year. The plan as brought forth in 1922 was to combine the
efforts of the two societies into one, instead of wasting energy by running in
parallel lines without co-operation. The membership of the societies had been,
hy this year, made practically the same, with the exception of Press Club's
more restricted policy of taking in men who were at the end of their junior
vear, or in their senior year.
Sigma Delta Chi announces now the pledging of William Gage, '24, and Ed
Landelß, '23. With the entry of these two men, every member of what was
the Press Club is now in the Stanford chapter of Sigma Delta Chi. Thus the
jnerger has been accomplished smooth-*— „

iy and with the unanimous approval
of all the members of both organiza
tions.
Efforts Centralized
The first obvious effect of the com
bination is the centering of campus
journalism in one society, so that all
the scribes of the University—off-cam
pus correspondents, as well as those
working on Stanford publications—
may give their united efforts to any
problem confronting campus journal
ism.
Sigma Delta Chi will now give its
united backing and active help to
Spectator, along with the English
Club. Press Club and English Club
were formerly the two organizations
sponsoring the magazine. Although the
society is not financially responsible
for the publication, its members will
be able, by their combined efforts, to
be of material assistance.
Sigma Delta Chi will henceforth be
an organization with two heads for
its two branches of activity. The presi
dent of the chapter, assisted by the
secretary-treasurer, will carry on the
necessary relations with the national
organization, and attend to the social
side of the local chapter's activities.
The other chief officer will be the man
chosen by Sigma Delta Chi and Eng
lish Club to edit Spectator. He will, by
virtues of his position, be enabled to
make available the resources of the
entire organization, outside of finan
cial matters, to keep the magazine up
to a high standard.
The present editor of Spectator is
Henry Mack, president of Press Club
and a member of Sigma Delta Chi. He
holds the editorship for the full year,
his successor for next year to be
chosen at the end of spring quarter.
The president of the local chapter,
Carl Shoup, leaves for Minneapolis
Friday to attend the annual national
convention of Sigma Delta Chi. The
convention will last three days, Nov.
19-21 inclusive. Last year the conven
tion was 'held at Kansas City, and
Kenneth Stewart was Stanford's con
vention delegate.
Norris James is the present secre
tary-treasurer of the Stanford chapter.
The first meeting of Sigma Delta
Chi since the fusion with Press Club
was effected was held last evening
when Coaches Kerr and Hunt were
guests of the organization at a supper
in the Union. Both Kerr and Hunt
gave talks to the journalists, explain
ing the way in which publicity for the
teams be used to best advan
tage.
Sigma Delta Chi holds its meetings
every Sunday evening, when the mem
bers gather for a special supper at
the Union.
Press Club Founded, 1894
Under the leadership of Carl S.
Smith, '93, editor of the Daily Palo,
Robert L. Donald, '94, and William
J. Nedig, 97, the pioneers of Stan
ford journalism gathered together in
October, 1894, and formed the first
journalistic society on the campus—
Press Club.
The personnel of the three campus
publications which were then existing,
the Daily Palo Alto, the Sequoia,
then a weekly, and the Quad, which
was compiling its first edition,
formed the list of charter members.
Smith war elected president, Donald,
vice-president.
During the first five years of
organization, from 1894 to 1899,
Press Club was chiefly concerned
with establishing itself as the leading
journalistic power on the campus
usurping the place held until then by
the literary societies.
Will Irwin President, '97
Among the earlier members were
such men as William J. Neidig, who
has since become nationally famous
as a writer of short stories; Edward
M. Hulme, '97,n0w a professor of his
tory at Stanford; Will Irwin, '98, and
Wallace Irwin, '98. Will Irwin headed
the organization in 1897.
Until late in the '90's Press Club
exercised no control over any of the
campus publications, except in an
advisory capacity. Later, the Sequoia
was edited and written by lpembers
of the club, though it was not its offi
cial publication. In Press Club meet
ings was fostered the first beginnings
of editorial policiesw hich had a deep
effect on moulding campus life, and a
journalistic tradition was built up
which kept the campus publications
alive under the discouragements and
disillusionments of weathering the
first years of existance.
During the school year of 1916 —
1917, Press Club took over and edited

"The Illustrated Review" then being
put out as an independent student
magazine.
Next year, the call to arms broke
up the club, and the "Illustrated" was
turned over to the alumni. Not until
February, 1919, did the members
again gather,and immediately re
sumed part control of the "Illustra
ted." During the following year the
failure of the dual control of the maga
zine was demonstrated, and in Octo
ber, 1920, the first issued of the "Stan
ford Pictorial" appeared as an inde
pendent magazine of student opinion.
But by now the campus had been
over-organized in journalistic endeav
ors. "Cardinal" and "Pictorial" solved
the situation by a combination of the
two magazines in February, 1923, un
der the dual control of Press and Eng
lish Clubs. The combination resulted
in the "Stanford Spectator," which
combined the best features of the two
magazines, and filled, within its pages,
the wants of all the campus.
Local Chapter Founded 1915
The Stanford chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi was chartered by the na
tional body on Jan. 5, 1915. The char
ter was granted to Edwin Ford, Milton
James Bennet, Harold Levy,
Glenn Hughes, and Robert Griffin, and
they formed the nucleus from which
the chapter has grown. At the present
time, the Stanford chapter has nine
teen members and five pledges. Initia
tion of the pledges will take place
Nov, 27.
The root idea behind Sigma Delta
Chi's existence has been that of a so
ciety active in campus journalism and
composed of members who are look
ing towards journalism as a. profes
sion. In this way the "honor society,"
founded purely for honor and nothing
else, has given way to the organiza
tion founded both as an honor society
and an active working unit. It has
been the policy of the national organi
zation to keep the professional aim
uppermost.
The present active roster of Sigma
Delta Chi is as follows, with the mem
bers listed in chronological order of
their initiation:
William Leiser, Thomas Irwin, Paul
Clyde, Robert Binkley, Charles Prior,
Carl Wilhelmson, Glenn Pollard, Carl
Shoup, Philip Newill, Andrew Boone,
Chester Hess, Norris James, Donald
Liebendorfer, Robert Edwards, North
cutt Ely, David Lamson, Bradley Riter,
Donald McKay, William L. Wright.
The following are pledges: Allan
Charles, William Gage, Ed Landels,
Henry Mack, John Marble.
Gordon Davis is the only faculty
member, and Charles K. Field and
Peter B. Kyrie are honorary members
of the chapter.
