# CAMPUS ACTORS SUCCEED IN DIFFICULT SHAW PLAY
## Helen Lewis, Bayley, and Chalmers Give Excellent Portrayals 
### Allan Charles 
When the Arnold Bayley lion lapsed
into slumber in the prologue of "An*
drocles and the Lion" Friday night he
awoke the sympathy (rather rare
lately) of a good-sized rooting sec
tion; and the good feeling remained,
expanding in the last act to a climax
with the triumphant Argentine-tango
entrance of this same beast and An
drocles.
The most encouraging consideration
of the presentation is not the realiza
tion that Gordon Davis and the cam
pus can successfully produce a diffi
cult Shaw play, or that the confidence
of the Stanford playgoer has been
strengthened; rather it is the sure
indication that there is going to be
much • less objectionable amateurish
ness this year than we are accustomed
to.
The subordination of the leading
humorists at the proper times to the
thought was one of the most admirable
points. There were many instances
when Bayley or Chalmers might eas- I

audience from speeches of other char
acters, and added laughs for them
selves.
The facial expression, of Chalmers
would have enabled any one who knew
the play to pick him out as Androcles
without any knowledge of his voice or
identity. Chalmers seemed naturally
so good that it is difficult to appreci
ate how easily he might have stepped
over his proper bounds and burlesqued
the part. The nearest approach to bur
lesque was when in the second act
he executed a Ram's Head flip-flop —
at that, his footwork was clever.
Helen Lewis was a fortunate selec
tion for Lavinia. Not only did her
countenance and poise adapt her
ideally to Shaw's fair martyr, but she
became so thoroughly engrossed in
the thought and emotion of her
speeches that when the action turned
again to broad farce, it seemed for a
moment insipid in comparison.
Arnold Bayley as the lion saw to it
that the play started off on the right
