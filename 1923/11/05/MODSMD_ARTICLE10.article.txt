# CAMPUS ACTORS SUCCEED IN DIFFICULT SHAW PLAY
## Helen Lewis, Bayley, and Chalmers Give Excellent Portrayals 
### Allan Charles 
When the Arnold Bayley lion lapsed
into slumber in the prologue of "An*
drocles and the Lion" Friday night he
awoke the sympathy (rather rare
lately) of a good-sized rooting sec
tion; and the good feeling remained,
expanding in the last act to a climax
with the triumphant Argentine-tango
entrance of this same beast and An
drocles.
The most encouraging consideration
of the presentation is not the realiza
tion that Gordon Davis and the cam
pus can successfully produce a diffi
cult Shaw play, or that the confidence
of the Stanford playgoer has been
strengthened; rather it is the sure
indication that there is going to be
much • less objectionable amateurish
ness this year than we are accustomed
to.
The subordination of the leading
humorists at the proper times to the
thought was one of the most admirable
points. There were many instances
when Bayley or Chalmers might eas- I

ily have taken the attention of the
audience from speeches of other char
acters, and added laughs for them
selves.
The facial expression, of Chalmers
would have enabled any one who knew
the play to pick him out as Androcles
without any knowledge of his voice or
identity. Chalmers seemed naturally
so good that it is difficult to appreci
ate how easily he might have stepped
over his proper bounds and burlesqued
the part. The nearest approach to bur
lesque was when in the second act
he executed a Ram's Head flip-flop —
at that, his footwork was clever.
Helen Lewis was a fortunate selec
tion for Lavinia. Not only did her
countenance and poise adapt her
ideally to Shaw's fair martyr, but she
became so thoroughly engrossed in
the thought and emotion of her
speeches that when the action turned
again to broad farce, it seemed for a
moment insipid in comparison.
Arnold Bayley as the lion saw to it
that the play started off on the right
foot. His recital of the progress of a
lion's emotions under pressure of a
thorn in the foot was a masterpiece
of vocal expression. A skin that looked
a little less like some unknown spe
cies of prehistoric animal and more
like the usual zoo specimen, would
have been more pleasing. One of Bay
ley's cleverest leonine interpretations
—his purring scene—seemed to es
cape appreciation by most of the audi
ence, probably because Bayley gave
as much volume to his purring as to
his half-sized growls.
David Mannoccir, as Ferrovius, was
very efficient iu the role of soul-saver.
The scene In which he applied his
efforts to convert Lentulus (Charles
Parks) was one of Shaw's most satiric
jabs at the practice of Christianity,
and one o? the best appreciated situa
tions in the Sword and Sandals pre
sentation. Whether Christian martyrs
of this period parted their hair in the
middle and used vaseline to keep it
down is a point on which Mannoccir
clearly differs with a number of his
torians.
Norris James succeeded in giving
an impressive portrayal of the hand
some captain, which was a difficult
role because of the number of didactic
speeches. He made a powerful figure,
although his clean-cutness reminded
one more of good Sir Galahad than
a hardy Roman captain. Caesar was
given sufficient dignity and assurance
by David Lamson, whose complete
ease and willingness to wait until the
audience was prepared to catch his
words suggested his considerable ac
quaintance with the Assembly hall
stage.
William Fitzhugh's treatment of the
Centurion kept the audience amused
during a large part of the first act. He
appeared, however to be giving an in
dividual performance, and seemed lit
tle aware of the thought of the play
beyond his own memorized lines.
One of the, most impressive touches
of "Androcles and the Lion" was the
coloring in the stage settings. The
slaves, soldiers, gladiators, Christians,
and attendants of the emperor all con
tributed color which harmonized with
the stage. Miss Chrysella Dunker di
rected the work of the theater work
shop class in preparation of the sets.
