# KERR'S VARSIIY SUBSTITUTES PULL COME-BACK ON OLYMPIC SQUAD AND WIN BY 40 TO 7
## Redshirts Protect Punter and Get Back on Old Footing; Cuddeback Scores on Spectacular Run 
### William Wright 
A Stanford varsity made up of eight substitutes and three regulars showed
a reusing comeback and an irresistible drive in the stadium Saturday after
noon, and crushed the clever Olympic Club eleven under a 40 to 7 score.
Aside from Baker, Shipkey, and Captain Campbell, no regular was used for
more than five minutes, and only three others were able to horn in even for
that length of time. "Little Andy" drew heavily on the third string, and these
third stringers jammed over three of the Cardinal tallies.
Cynics who watched for a repetition of the kick-blocking stunt saw Armour
block an Olympic punt, and nothing more. Once during the afternoon Cudde
back was dangerously rushed on a punt, but the rest of the time he might
have scoured the ball with Sapolio before booting it. The line held out their

the halfbacks blocked theirs, and
I "Cuddy" was serene and confident,
j Rub out the black mark against Stan
ford.
The Redshirts showed just about as
marked an improvement in general
offensive tactics. There was no let-
I down during the four periods. The
i Winged "O" put on a spurt of their
! own during the second and part of the
i third quarters, but once they had worn
I themselves out against the Stanford
i wall the Cards took charge again and
pounded out four more touchdowns. It
was the most encouraging football
game since the Nevada contest, and
should serve to bolster confidenca in
the Kerr machine.
Stanford made one first down after
receiving Clyde King's kick-off, and
then punted. The Club tried the line,
lost, and punted back. Wheat and
Cuddeback worked the ball 60 yards
in seven plays, and "Cuddy" went
through tackle for a touchdown, which
was not converted.
After a Stanford fumble on her 35
yard line, recovered by the Clubmen,
King attempted a drop-kick from a
point near the side-line. The ball went
to the other side of the gridiron and
dropped on the 20 yard marker, with
Cuddeback under it. Whirling in the
air, "Skipper" dashed 80 yards along
the chalk-line for the second Stanford
touchdown. Hastily-formed interfer
ence took care of a half dozen Olym
pians, and Cuddeback was hardly
jostled during his run. Campbell con
verted, and the score remained at
13 to 0 until nearly the end of the
third period.
The Post street men opened up their
attack at this point, and drove through
the line and in the air for five first
downs. Stanford got the ball in Olym
pic territory when Middleton recovered
a fumble, but a Stanford fumble on
the 2 yard line prevented • another
score. The Winged "O" was held back
without much chance to score.
Near the end of the third quarter
Stanford again stepped out. Solomon
lobbed a short pass over center to
Campbell, and the Scotchman dodged
and twisted his way for 35 yards to |
the goal line, through the whole Olym- !
pic team. He converted for a 20 point
total.
Another drive was immediately j
launched, and shortly after the begin-1
ning of the final period Kelly plunged j
through guard for another score. Cud
deback converted. Cuddeback kicked
off, the Club tried to punt, Armour
blocked it, and McDermont recovered
for a fifth tally. Just like that. •
The Club was hurling pass after
pass in an effort to complete one and
avoid a shut-out, and Needles finally
turned the trick. Cuddeback kicked
out of bounds, and the Clubmen took
the ball well down in Stanford's half
of the field. A pass and a plunge net
ted first down, and then Needles shot
the ball to Hauser, who caught it on
Stanford's 3 yard line and carried it
over. Luce converted.
Nevers went in for a few minutes,
and, with Kelly and Hey, took the
ball down to the 4 yard line. Dennis
passed to McDermont for a touchdown,
and that ended it.

EQUITATION CLASS FOR WOMEN:
The Military department offers to
admit twenty women to the Faculty
riding class which meets Tuesday
and Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Applica
tions for this class should be in the
Dean of Women's office by Tuesday
morning at 10. Graduate students,
seniors, juniors, and sophomores are
eligible to apply. The first meeting
of the class is Tuesday.
A Stanford varsity made up of eight substitutes and three regulars showed
a reusing comeback and an irresistible drive in the stadium Saturday after
noon, and crushed the clever Olympic Club eleven under a 40 to 7 score.
Aside from Baker, Shipkey, and Captain Campbell, no regular was used for
more than five minutes, and only three others were able to horn in even for
that length of time. "Little Andy" drew heavily on the third string, and these
third stringers jammed over three of the Cardinal tallies.
Cynics who watched for a repetition of the kick-blocking stunt saw Armour
block an Olympic punt, and nothing more. Once during the afternoon Cudde
back was dangerously rushed on a punt, but the rest of the time he might
have scoured the ball with Sapolio before booting it. The line held out their

the halfbacks blocked theirs, and
I "Cuddy" was serene and confident,
j Rub out the black mark against Stan
ford.
The Redshirts showed just about as
marked an improvement in general
offensive tactics. There was no let-
I down during the four periods. The
i Winged "O" put on a spurt of their
! own during the second and part of the
i third quarters, but once they had worn
I themselves out against the Stanford
i wall the Cards took charge again and
pounded out four more touchdowns. It
was the most encouraging football
game since the Nevada contest, and
should serve to bolster confidenca in
the Kerr machine.
Stanford made one first down after
receiving Clyde King's kick-off, and
then punted. The Club tried the line,
lost, and punted back. Wheat and
Cuddeback worked the ball 60 yards
in seven plays, and "Cuddy" went
through tackle for a touchdown, which
was not converted.
After a Stanford fumble on her 35
yard line, recovered by the Clubmen,
King attempted a drop-kick from a
point near the side-line. The ball went
to the other side of the gridiron and
dropped on the 20 yard marker, with
Cuddeback under it. Whirling in the
air, "Skipper" dashed 80 yards along
the chalk-line for the second Stanford
touchdown. Hastily-formed interfer
ence took care of a half dozen Olym
pians, and Cuddeback was hardly
jostled during his run. Campbell con
verted, and the score remained at
13 to 0 until nearly the end of the
third period.
The Post street men opened up their
attack at this point, and drove through
the line and in the air for five first
downs. Stanford got the ball in Olym
pic territory when Middleton recovered
a fumble, but a Stanford fumble on
the 2 yard line prevented • another

admit twenty women to the Faculty
riding class which meets Tuesday
and Thursday at 10:30 a.m. Applica
tions for this class should be in the
Dean of Women's office by Tuesday
morning at 10. Graduate students,
seniors, juniors, and sophomores are
eligible to apply. The first meeting
of the class is Tuesday.
A Stanford varsity made up of eight substitutes and three regulars showed
a reusing comeback and an irresistible drive in the stadium Saturday after
noon, and crushed the clever Olympic Club eleven under a 40 to 7 score.
Aside from Baker, Shipkey, and Captain Campbell, no regular was used for
more than five minutes, and only three others were able to horn in even for
that length of time. "Little Andy" drew heavily on the third string, and these
third stringers jammed over three of the Cardinal tallies.
Cynics who watched for a repetition of the kick-blocking stunt saw Armour
block an Olympic punt, and nothing more. Once during the afternoon Cudde
back was dangerously rushed on a punt, but the rest of the time he might
have scoured the ball with Sapolio before booting it. The line held out their

the halfbacks blocked theirs, and
I "Cuddy" was serene and confident,
j Rub out the black mark against Stan
ford.
The Redshirts showed just about as
marked an improvement in general
offensive tactics. There was no let-
I down during the four periods. The
i Winged "O" put on a spurt of their
! own during the second and part of the
i third quarters, but once they had worn
I themselves out against the Stanford
i wall the Cards took charge again and
pounded out four more touchdowns. It
was the most encouraging football
game since the Nevada contest, and
should serve to bolster confidenca in
the Kerr machine.
Stanford made one first down after
receiving Clyde King's kick-off, and
then punted. The Club tried the line,
lost, and punted back. Wheat and
Cuddeback worked the ball 60 yards
in seven plays, and "Cuddy" went
through tackle for a touchdown, which
was not converted.
After a Stanford fumble on her 35
yard line, recovered by the Clubmen,
King attempted a drop-kick from a
point near the side-line. The ball went
to the other side of the gridiron and
dropped on the 20 yard marker, with
Cuddeback under it. Whirling in the
air, "Skipper" dashed 80 yards along
the chalk-line for the second Stanford
touchdown. Hastily-formed interfer
ence took care of a half dozen Olym
pians, and Cuddeback was hardly
jostled during his run. Campbell con
verted, and the score remained at
13 to 0 until nearly the end of the
third period.
The Post street men opened up their
attack at this point, and drove through
the line and in the air for five first
downs. Stanford got the ball in Olym
pic territory when Middleton recovered
a fumble, but a Stanford fumble on
the 2 yard line prevented • another
score. The Winged "O" was held back
without much chance to score.
Near the end of the third quarter
Stanford again stepped out. Solomon
lobbed a short pass over center to
Campbell, and the Scotchman dodged
and twisted his way for 35 yards to |
the goal line, through the whole Olym- !
pic team. He converted for a 20 point
total.
Another drive was immediately j
launched, and shortly after the begin-1
ning of the final period Kelly plunged j
through guard for another score. Cud
deback converted. Cuddeback kicked
off, the Club tried to punt, Armour
blocked it, and McDermont recovered
for a fifth tally. Just like that. •
The Club was hurling pass after
pass in an effort to complete one and
avoid a shut-out, and Needles finally
turned the trick. Cuddeback kicked
out of bounds, and the Clubmen took
the ball well down in Stanford's half
of the field. A pass and a plunge net
ted first down, and then Needles shot
the ball to Hauser, who caught it on
Stanford's 3 yard line and carried it
over. Luce converted.
Nevers went in for a few minutes,
and, with Kelly and Hey, took the
ball down to the 4 yard line. Dennis
passed to McDermont for a touchdown,
and that ended it.
