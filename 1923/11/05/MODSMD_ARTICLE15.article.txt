The "United Campaign" for funds for
the Y. M. C. A. in China, Student Friend
ship Fund and Greek Relief will begin
its drive tonight with a dinner in the
Women's Clubhouse for all campaign
captains. Mr. C. VV. Riley, head of the
Student Friendship Fund on the coast,
and Mr. Charles Stallings, secretary of
the European Student Relief Committee,
will speak on relief work in Europe and
China. This is the only campaign for
funds permitted this quarter and has been
authorized by the Social Service Board
and approved by the executive committee.
Professor E. E. Robinson, Professor
Payson Treat, Professor G. G. Martin
and Dean Mary Yost will speak to the
women's living groups during the dinner
hour tonight on the importance of the
campaign, while the men will hear Pro
fessors O. M. Johnston, J. C. Clark, C.

Dr. O. L. Elliott, Warren D. Allen, J. G.

Students and faculty of thirty-nine dif
ferent universities in various countries
support the Student Friendship fund
which gives financial aid to self-help en
terprises, such as co-operative kitchens;
furnishes food and clothing to under
nourished students and professors in the
stricken districts of Europe, and gener
ally helps in reconstruction work.
The World's Student Christian Fed
eration with o....cers in various parts of
Europe has charge of the distribution of
| the relief funds from this source. At
present there are 14,000 refugee students
in strange lands, with no homes and no
funds, and 31,000 Russian students have
only one meal a day.
Herbert Hoover has particularly en
dorsed the work of the Student Friend
ship fund, commending the wisdom and
efficiency with which the work has been
carried on, and giving his unqualified
support to its continuance. "I hope that
it will not fail from want of funds and
that our people will give it the support it
should have," declared Mr. Hoover.
Elizabeth Simmons has charge of this
section of the United Campaign.
Don Chase is campaign captain for
that part of the drive involving the Y. M.
C.'A. in China. This organization helps
to give the students in Chinese Univer
sities a physical, moral, and spiritual
education, and thus enables them to cope
with the many problems which the up
heavel in China has brought to light.
The Greek Relief will be in charge of
Professor E. W. Martin, and the funds
will be devoted to the relief of the
stricken refugees from Smyrna who are
receiving no aid from the Near East
Relief and are thus in desperate straits.
