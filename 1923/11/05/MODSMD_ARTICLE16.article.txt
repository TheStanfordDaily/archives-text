# SOPHOMORES HAVE PREFERENCE IN SALE OF COTILLION TICKETS
## 
### 
Sophomores will be given first chance
in the Cotillion ticket sale which opened
today at the Stanford bookstore. The
tickets will not go on general sale until
Wednesday. A maximum of 350 tickets
for the dance, on November 16, has been
set. Â»
The cotillion is the bigest dance of the
autumn quarter. The 1923 class proposes
to make the affair even more elaborate
than it has been in previous years, if
decorations and programs mean anything.
I The programs will be an innovation, since
! they are entirely different than anything
' tried on the campus.
Music is to be furnished by the Fair
mont hotel orchestra of San Francisco.
.Ten full dances are promised during the
evening. Supper will be served at tables
j placed around the edges of the pavilion
! and under the balconies.
