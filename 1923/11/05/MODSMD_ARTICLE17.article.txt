# Scout Leadership Class Camps Out at Searsville
## 
### 
Thirty women, the majority of whom
are members of the class in Girl Scout
Leadership, hiked to Searsville Friday
afternoon to spend the night in the hills.
Miss Vaal Stark, instructor in the
course, chaperoned the party. Besides the
University women, ten Girl Scouts from
the Palo Alto troop attended.
The entire party slept in the open, on
the ground. They cooked dinner and
breakfast over the campfire.
