# "Huh!"
## 
### 
A;idy Smith sat in the bleachers last Saturday.
Andy Smith saw the Stanford varsity walk over,
under, around, and through the Olympic Club
eleven. Andy Smith also heard the report come
floating across the field: "California, 0; Nevada, 0."
Then Andy Smith pulled down his lip and said:
"Huh!" Just like that.
After that he went home full pi new ideas about
the power of Andy Kerr's second team.
Perhaps Mr. Smith's monosyllabic ejaculation was
addressed at the voice which announced that his
team had not crossed a goal line. Surrounding him
on several stadium seats were the main cogs in his
varsity machine, including the captain and the two
hardest hitters in the Bears' front defense. Also,
perhaps, he realized that the Nevada team was a
veteran eleven compared to that which met Stanford,
having learned well the lessons of three hard games.
When the atmosphere around the campanile ceases
to be quite so blue and gloomy Andy Smith will
tell the assembled populace just what that goo§e-egg
meant to his players—that it made them more
dangerous than ever before, for the same reason
that U. S. C.„ Nevada, and Stanford were dangerous
after being stung by defeat.
Anyway, Mr. Smith knows this much about 'the
Cards, no matter what else he learned during his
informal call: that the Redshirts have come to
realize they are no world-beating team, and with
that realization over-confidence and prima-donna
nervousness have vanished.
I he Stanford varsity, all twenty-two of them, are
now a hard-hitting, hard-fighting of athletes
who see they have a stiff battle ahead of them, and
are willing to scrap through a tough conference
season, knowing that no matter how the preliminary
games come out —good, bad, or uninteresting—they
will go across the bay just enough the underdogs to
fight California to a standstill and then topple her
over backwards.
No wonder Andy Smith said "Huh!" with his
face at half mast.
