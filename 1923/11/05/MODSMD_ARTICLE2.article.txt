# FRESHMEN DEFEAT POLY ELEVEN 33-0 IN FAST CONTEST
## Cardinal Substitutes Buck San Luis Obispo Line for Long Gains 
### 
Taking the lead early in the game,
and maintaining a battering offense,
the Cardinal frosh sent the San Luis
Obiscpo Polytechnic lads down the
coast with a 330-0 defeat, in the pre
liminary game played Saturday in the
stadium. Coach Hunt and most of the
first string men were at Berkeley
watching the U. S. C. frosh trample
over the Bear Cubs, and the defeat
was registered on the Poly gridders
by first string subs, and second and
third team men.
Neither team did much the first few
minutes, but after an exchange of
punts, the Poly kicker punted to Phil
lips who returned the ball 30 yards.
After a series of bucks and off-tackle
plays, Herth carried the ball over for
the first babe score. Phillips kicked
goal.
Pass Made Good
Phillips gained twenty yards on a
pass from Herth as the first quarter
ended. Score, Stanford frosh 7, Poly, 0.
At the start of the next quarter Herth
made first downs, and then he and
Phillips carried the ball to the Poly
five yard line. Doerr went through
guard for a touchdown, and Phillips
converted. Score, Stanford, 14, Poly, 0.
The next score came soon after
when Doerr started around left end.
evaded the Poly tacklers, and raced
down the field 38 yards for his second
touchdown. Phillips again converted.
This ended the scoring for the half,
with Stanford on the long end of a
21-0 score.
The babe backfield worked the ball
up the field after the start of the half
and Phillips went over for a score, but
missed his try at goal. This brought
the total up to 27 for the babes.
Third Team Scores
With the game safely tucked away,
Post sent in an entire new team at the
start of the final period. The new team
proved too much for the Poly men and
Baxter crossed the goal line for the
final score. The attempt at goal failed.
Ryan started at quarter for the
babes, and showed himself to be a
field general as well as a ground
gainer. The other first squad men who
played were Price, Poulson, Doerr,
Phillips, Toffelmier, and Mann.
