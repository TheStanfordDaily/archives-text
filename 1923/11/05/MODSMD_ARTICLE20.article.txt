# Consider the Dance

### 
A tag danQj well carried out has been strongly
advocated recently by various upholders of the
Jolly-up at Stanford.
One of the best examples of this form of social
recreation that the Daily has been pleased to call
before campus attention was that put on by the Lion
and Androcles in the arena.
The trouble- was, so much more that was excellent
appeared in "Androcles" that the Jolly-up feature
was somewhat overlooked. Careful, finished direc
tion, three people of real acting ability in the leads,
and a happy choice of a play opened the present
season with a promise of continued professional
standards in Stanford amateur drama.
An English professor last week told his class that
"every writer must be interpreted in the light of
the age in which he lives in." This is not to be
taken as an excuse for murder of the President's
English.
People should be more careful about throwing
wads of tinfoil in places where soup is being con
sumed.
