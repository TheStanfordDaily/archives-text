# A 						CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
## Cassius 
### 
Cassius is a sixteen neck in a fourteen collar. He is
the kid who always comes into the movies late and sits
down in front of you.
He bulges so much around the torrid zone that he has
to ask someone if his shoestring is untied.
To watch Cassius take on cargo three times a day
would make a training-table man tear out every one of
his hairs, and a South American anaconda curl up and
die of professional jealousy. A primrose on the river's
brim, to his mind, is hardly in it with seconds on straw
berry shortcake.
This talk about girth control, he says, is all the rocks.
Cassius falls hopelessly in love with someone else
every week-end, but as has been said somewhere,
"Snakes are made of slimmer stuff."
But down deep somewhere he has a heroic heart, and
he says that some day he will lay down his life for a
friend, or something. Then they'll all be sorry.
