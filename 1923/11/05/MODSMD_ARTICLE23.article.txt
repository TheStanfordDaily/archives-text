Little Joe goes about like a boy scout who hasn't done
his kind deed for today.
"You forgot to shave this morning," he'll say, and sure
enough you'll find you did. Or he will brighten your
day with, "Hard luck on that ex, old man. Oh, I only
got 96."
If ever I start murder on a business scale, I shall use
Joe to practice on. â€”SCORP.

"No women's clothes to be worn on Roughs' Day,"
warns Senior Control Committee. The fifty per cent who
were formerly more or less female impersonators must
now content themselves in joining the other half and
dressing as Jew peddlers and hoboes.
