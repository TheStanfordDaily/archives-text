"Marriage is a financial experiment," said Paul
Ashe's trap drummer in addressing a convention
of Palo Alto undertakers at Cupertino tomorrow
morning before breakfast. "During courtship the
potential bride is under a forbidding handicap in
spending all her man's money, inasmuch as it is
practically impossible for her to find out where
he keeps it. The wedding-bells ring out their
"Eureka" and the game of hide-and-keep com
mences. Often husbands do not embezzle money
until the fourth year of married life, but only in
case of the opportune death of a wealthy aunt.
(Cheers.)
"Clocks and cats should be shunned by matri
monial victims. The problem of winding and put
ting out respectively is a sure cause for trouble,
sooner or later. This leads either to divorce,
sweet matricide, or aggravatin' patricide, all of
which are bad form. Legal entanglements to one
side, suicide is the logical way out. This insures
the impossibility of another such experience and
leaves the party of the second part capable of
skidding into another collision. Revenge is in
disputably saccharine." —B. W.

Fashion is
a crool mistress and
causes more trouble than
examinations; to the women at
least. We men don't care about
that, but we hope that short skirts •
will remain long as at present. Do you
remember last year, when we were
unable to get a date for a
week because every
woman was making
her skirts
longer? . —B. W.
