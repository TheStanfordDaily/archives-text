C. N. H. â€¢
The newspapers carried
his name in headlines
on some days, and he
was always being called
upon to make a speech,
or plant a tree, or lay
a cornerstone, or honor
something. . . Certainly
he was a much respected
and dignified man. Yes,
he possessed a most
distinguished bearing,
and he seemed far
removed from the petty
things of the world.
Then one day I saw him
sitting on a box in his
back yard, quite red in
the face, and trying to
remove some sticky
chewing gum from the sole
of one of his shoes.
