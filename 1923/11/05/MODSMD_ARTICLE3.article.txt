# Somebody Going to Oregon: Is It You? Dime Pays Passage
## 
### 
Want to go to the Oregon game
next Saturday? ,
Here's your chance —all expenses
paid, and everything.
Two things are necessary. First,
you must get out the dime and pay
it to one of Mr. Lapp's assistants at
a booth on the Law steps.
Second, and most important, you
must be at the rally in the stadium
next Wednesday afternoon at 4
o'clock. At this time, Burt Lapp will
announce the man who will be sent
to Oregon on the dimes contributed.
No one knows who he or she will
be. The choice is in the lap of the
gods.
You get the idea? Pay ten cents,
and go to the rally, where the name
of the person chosen by the gods
will be announced. He will be pro
vided with a ticket to Oregon and
back, including a Pullman berth; a
ticket to the game, and a room for
one night at the Multnomah Hotel,
where the varsity men are to be
lodged.
The plan is not to be run for
profit, Lapp announces. In case
there are enough ten cent pieces
contributed, two men will make the
trip instead of one. No money will
go into the treasury from the deal.
The complete rally program In
cludes the Ram's Head-Sigma DeltA
Chi football game, 4 o'clock to 4:15;
selection of the Stanford rooter
to attend the game; a short work
out on songs and yells, and a pro
cession to the railroad station to
wave a fond farewell to the football
men.
