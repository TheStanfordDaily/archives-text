# JUNIOR ELEVEN WINS INTERCLASS BATTLE WITH '26 GRIDDERS
## 
### 
A punch when needed gave the juniors
their 14 to 2 victory over the sophomore
eleven Saturday in the second round of
the irrterclass football series.
The first junior score came five min
utes after the opening of the first quar
ter. Play had been even with few gains
for cither aggregation for three minutes
and an exchange of punts followed. On
the next play, Captain "Dutch" McAllis
ter took the ball around the sophomore
left end, plunged through a number of
second-year tacklers, stiff-armed the next
one whirled, and stumbled over the goal
line—a beautiful forty-yard broken-field
run. McAllister converted.
The junior's second toucrdown came in
the second period when Alexander ran
back a sophomore punt to the latter's
twenty-yard line and, following four line
bucks for good yardage, smashed his way
across the" line for the second score.
McAllister converted.
At the beginning of the third period
came the sophomore chance to score.
They had comc back from between halves
with more fight than they had previously
shown and with a steady drive advanced
tn the five yard line—Hastings and Mor
gan carrying the pigskin. With only one
down and five yards to go a score seemed
inevitable but the punch was lacking and
three plays placed the ball only thirteen
inches from the zero chalk mark and in
the juniors' possession.
Here the third-year men took the ball,
which was directly between the goal
prists, and, being forced by the cross-bar
to run instead of kick, tried a line-buck —
only to have the sophomore line hold and
force a safety.
