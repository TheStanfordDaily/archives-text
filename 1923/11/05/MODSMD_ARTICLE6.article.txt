# Scribes Sign Keen Coaches For Grid Tilt
## 
### 
If an expert coaching staff means a
winning football team, Sigma Delta Chi
should garner all the mothballs in the
stadium next Wednesday afternoon, when
the scribes take on Ram's Head for a
two-round go as a feature of the Oregon
game bleacher rally.
Andy Kerr, Gordon Davis, Peter B.
Kyne, and Charles Field arc the four
mentors who have the grid squad of ti:?
keypotinders under charge. Kerr gave
tilt- boyg a brief workout around the din
ner table last evening at the regular Sun
day evening feed of the organization.
Peter Kyne and Charles Field, both hon
orary members of the organization, have
turned out some of the best lines America
has ever seen. They will coach the S.
D. C. defense by telegraph, and will fol
low the game by radio.
Gordon Davis, who is responsible for
some of the best plays ever tried by
Stanford men, will be the fourth man
behind the scenes for the coming contest.
Davis' interests are now centered in the
Assembly hall, but in his undergraduate
days he was an active member of Sigma
Delta Chi, and the flame of loyalty still
burns brightly for the dear old organiza
tion.
It is understood that "Little Andy"
Kerr contributed large gobs of informa
tion and advice while being entertained
by the linotype lizards last evening. As a
result of this table-cloth tutelage, the
newspaper boys face the coming game
with superb confidence, even in the face
of the announcement from Ram's Head
that its line-up will include such man
mountains as Dave Mannoccir, "Kewp"
Sproull, and Gene Trago.
Agreements that no practices should be
held were called off yesterday, and Sigma
Delta Chi went through a snappy ten
minute signal practice on the turf in
front of the basketball pavilion. With
Carl Shoup, who will start the game as
coxswain, calling signals the first-string
players showed unexpected ability in the
face of no opposition. The practice lasted
until it was time for their pictures to be
taken for the 1925 Quad. Only two men
were laid out by the hard practice, and
no one was seriously hurt. The true
Sigma Delta Chi fighting spirit was dis
played, and it was necessary for the hoys
to remlize themselves three times for
unnecessary roughness in mussing neck
ties.
It is expected that Ram's Head will
stage a rehearsal on Monday or Tuesday.
The game will be played under Marquis
of Queensbury rules: Holding, gouging,
and biting in the clinches will not be
tolerated. The wearing of track shoes by
the players will be frowned upon, and
those doing so are requested to step on
the faces of opposing players not oftener
than necessary. Divots must he replaced.

no one was seriously hurt. The true
Sigma Delta Chi fighting spirit was dis
played, and it was necessary for the hoys
to remlize themselves three times for
unnecessary roughness in mussing neck
ties.
It is expected that Ram's Head will
stage a rehearsal on Monday or Tuesday.
The game will be played under Marquis
of Queensbury rules: Holding, gouging,
and biting in the clinches will not be
tolerated. The wearing of track shoes by
the players will be frowned upon, and
those doing so are requested to step on
the faces of opposing players not oftener
than necessary. Divots must he replaced.
If an expert coaching staff means a
winning football team, Sigma Delta Chi
should garner all the mothballs in the
stadium next Wednesday afternoon, when
the scribes take on Ram's Head for a
two-round go as a feature of the Oregon
game bleacher rally.
Andy Kerr, Gordon Davis, Peter B.
Kyne, and Charles Field arc the four
mentors who have the grid squad of ti:?
keypotinders under charge. Kerr gave
tilt- boyg a brief workout around the din
ner table last evening at the regular Sun
day evening feed of the organization.
Peter Kyne and Charles Field, both hon
orary members of the organization, have
turned out some of the best lines America
has ever seen. They will coach the S.
D. C. defense by telegraph, and will fol
low the game by radio.
Gordon Davis, who is responsible for
some of the best plays ever tried by
Stanford men, will be the fourth man
behind the scenes for the coming contest.
Davis' interests are now centered in the
Assembly hall, but in his undergraduate
days he was an active member of Sigma
Delta Chi, and the flame of loyalty still
burns brightly for the dear old organiza
tion.
It is understood that "Little Andy"
Kerr contributed large gobs of informa
tion and advice while being entertained
by the linotype lizards last evening. As a
result of this table-cloth tutelage, the
newspaper boys face the coming game
with superb confidence, even in the face
of the announcement from Ram's Head
that its line-up will include such man
mountains as Dave Mannoccir, "Kewp"
Sproull, and Gene Trago.
Agreements that no practices should be
held were called off yesterday, and Sigma
Delta Chi went through a snappy ten
minute signal practice on the turf in
front of the basketball pavilion. With
Carl Shoup, who will start the game as
coxswain, calling signals the first-string
players showed unexpected ability in the
face of no opposition. The practice lasted
until it was time for their pictures to be
taken for the 1925 Quad. Only two men
were laid out by the hard practice, and
no one was seriously hurt. The true
