# Scribes Sign Keen Coaches For Grid Tilt

### 
If an expert coaching staff means a
winning football team, Sigma Delta Chi
should garner all the mothballs in the
stadium next Wednesday afternoon, when
the scribes take on Ram's Head for a
two-round go as a feature of the Oregon
game bleacher rally.
Andy Kerr, Gordon Davis, Peter B.
Kyne, and Charles Field arc the four
mentors who have the grid squad of ti:?

Gordon Davis, who is responsible for
some of the best plays ever tried by
Stanford men, will be the fourth man
behind the scenes for the coming contest.
Davis' interests are now centered in the
Assembly hall, but in his undergraduate
days he was an active member of Sigma
Delta Chi, and the flame of loyalty still
burns brightly for the dear old organiza

It is understood that "Little Andy"
Kerr contributed large gobs of informa
tion and advice while being entertained
by the linotype lizards last evening. As a
result of this table-cloth tutelage, the
newspaper boys face the coming game
with superb confidence, even in the face
of the announcement from Ram's Head
that its line-up will include such man
mountains as Dave Mannoccir, "Kewp"
Sproull, and Gene Trago.
Agreements that no practices should be
held were called off yesterday, and Sigma
Delta Chi went through a snappy ten
