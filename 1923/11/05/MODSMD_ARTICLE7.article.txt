## 
### 
Eight touchdowns in the first half sup
plemented by three scores in the second
period enabled the Stanford Grays to beat
the ragged Fort Scott 74 to 3 on the
i varsity field last Saturday morning.
Fort Scott's score came in the last part
of the game against the second team. It
j was a result of a drop kick by the Fort
i fullback, Saunders.
The first three touchdowns were scored
lon a total of eight plays. Fort Scott
kicked off to Stanford, and tackled the
! runner fairly close to the goal line. The
i Fort team looked fast on getting down
1 under the kick, but the succeeding plays
| proved their calibre to be not much bet
ter than that of a first rate high school
team. On the first play Dwight took the
ball forty yards, and on the second play,
fifteen yards. Stratton five yards; Dwight
no gain, and Stratton for a touchdown.
Nick Kirwan scored another on the kick
off. Two plays later, after Fort Scott
had fumbled and Staiiford had recovered,
Dwight went for a third score.
Harvey Coverley staved off a possible
Fort Scott fumble in the last part of the
fourth quarter. He evaded four men on
interference and tackled the runner, who
had gotten away with an open field in
front of him.
It was a terrible exhibition of football.
Fort Scott outweighed the Stanford
team, but could get nowhere, showing
the lack of proper training and coaching.
The third varsity looked good, but the
team which Mike Reed sent in to replace
them was a little uncertain as to just
what to do.
