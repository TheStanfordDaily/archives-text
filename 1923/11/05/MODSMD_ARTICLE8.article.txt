# SONS OF NORWAY WIN FROM CARD SOCCERITES
## 
### 
Exhibiting no punch whatever the soc
! cer varsity lost to the Sons of Norway
Saturday afternoon on the varsity field,
3-1. The game was slow and uninterest
ing, and proved a lack of both offensive
| and defensive power on the part of the
I Cards.
Captain Bill Swayne, at inside right,
and Howe, at center half, did all the
j work for the Stanford team. The only
! resistance offered the Norweigans came
I from these two men.
Munford scored the single goal for
| Stanford on a lucky play. The Norway
goai keeper, in fielding a kick, made the
mistake of kicking the hall from the
! ground, instead of picking it up. The
! hall struck Munford on the chest, and
I bounded back for the one Card score.
Co-ordination on the defense was en-
tirely missing. Each time the Sons of
Norway scored, the fullbacks were drawn
entirely out of position, leaving no one
but the goal keeper to guard the goal.
Clark was far from his usual form,
while Schoen demonstrated that he has
not yet had time to learn the art of play
ing fullback.
The forward line was woefully weak.
Hoover and Richardson, although fast,
could not handle the ball in the same
manner as the Sons of Norway wings
did. Munford was in poor form, and
continually missed passes from the backs.
In a short practice game Friday, the
Card varsity had little trouble in beating
the San Anselmo eleven, 4-0. Although
holding themselves back, Coach Ma
loney's men scored whenever called on
to do so. Many substitutes were used.
On the basis of Saturday's showing,
Coach Maloney will undertake an entire
reorganization of his team. Both the for
ward wall and the defense must be re
constructed. With the California game
only a week ahead, Maloney will have
to use every man to the limit, to put the
full strength of the Stanford squad on
the field. Some of the men who have
warmed the bench heretofore will prob
ably be given a chance to show their
wares during the next week's practice, in
the hope of uncovering some promising
material.

Women at Pomona College will wear
rooters' caps and take part in the
organized rooting for the first time
in the history of Southern California
intercollegiate athletic contests.
