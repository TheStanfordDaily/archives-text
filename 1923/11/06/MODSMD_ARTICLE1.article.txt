# PROFESSOR SWAIN TELLS OF FOREIGN TRAVELS TONIGHT
## Social and Political State of European Countries to Be Emphasized 
### 
Comparing social and political condi
tions in Francc, Germany, and England,
Professor R. E. Swain, head of the
Chemistry department, will discuss his
travels through the countries of western
Europe this evening, at 7 :30 in the As
sembly hall.
Professor Swain left Stanford last De
cember to go to Columbia University as
lecturer and medalist under the Chandler
Foundation. In January, accompanied by
his family, he sailed for France, where
he spent six weeks. Leaving by way of
the Riviera, he toured Italy, Sicily, Swit
zerland and he made a long visit in
France, where he attended the celebration
at Strassburg m honor of the centenary
of the birth of Pasteur. Crossing Hol
land and Belgium, he remained in Eng
land six weeks, where he took part in the
International Congress of Pure and Ap
plied Chemistry at Cambridge.
On two previous irips, Professor
Swain toured the continent on a wheel,
riding 3500 miles, in 1909. "So on this
tour," he says, "I followed the old lure
of remote points, and we stayed in the
country districts and smaller cities most
of the time. Here we could get a more
accurate idea of the conditions."
"Construction in the devasted regions
of France is going on very rapidly, and
it is due largely to this fact that there is
scarcely any unemployment in France.
France gives every outward sign of being
very prosperous.
"England, on the other hand, is suf
fering from a severe condition of indus
trial depression and widespread unem
ployment," declares Professor Swain.
"The distress in Germany is chiefly
among the middle classes. A large per
centage of children, especially in the
cities, are. undernourished."
A reason for this shortage of available
food. Professor Swaid believes, is that
the people have no money with which to
buy their provisions. Many of his friends
among the professors he found greatly in
need of funds. Causes of these con
ditions, and the probable readjustments
will be discussed in his talk tonight.
