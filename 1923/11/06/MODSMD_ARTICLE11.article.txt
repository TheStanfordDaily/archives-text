# BASKETBALL BEGINS UNDER SUPERVISION OF CAPTAIN McHOSE
## 
### 
Varsity basketball practice is in full
swing, with workouts every afternoon un
der the direction of Captain "Nip" Mc-
Hose. Practice is held in the Encina
gym, due to the fact that the Quad pho
tographers are using the pavilion.
Prospects were never brighter for a
championship five. Four of the veterans
from the team that was defeated last year
by the California team only, will be back
in suits. Besides these, there is a wealth
of other available material.
Captain McHose will be at one of the
forward positions. Although exceedingly
light, McHose is one of the cleverest
floormen and most accurate shots on the i
coast. The other forward position will
be a question. The graduation of "Lefty"
Rogers left a position that will be hard |
to fill. The contest for the job will prob- '
ably lie between Hoffman, captain of the
1925 freshman outfit, and Nevers, of last
year's freshman team. Hoffman was kejit
from the floor last season by injuries, but j
should be in fine shape this year. Nevers
was the center of both the offense and
defense for the frosh a year ago.
At center will be the veteran Steele. |
Although Steele played second fiddle to
Jannsen most of last year, he should be
ready to take over the full duties of the
position now.
"Andy" Anderson and "Cow" Oliva are
two regulars from the '23 squad who
should fill the guard positions to a nicety.
Anderson is a running-guard who is sec
ond to none. To keep Oliva on his toes
to hold the position of standing guard
won last season, will be "Dud" DeGroot,
a veteran of two seasons, and Mcßurney,
a former substitute.
In addition to the men above mentioned,
there are many more men of promise,
who will likely win positions for them
selves. According to plans, the only out
side games scheduled for this quarter
will be played next month.

Varsity basketball practice is in full
swing, with workouts every afternoon un
der the direction of Captain "Nip" Mc-
Hose. Practice is held in the Encina
gym, due to the fact that the Quad pho
tographers are using the pavilion.
Prospects were never brighter for a
championship five. Four of the veterans
from the team that was defeated last year
by the California team only, will be back
in suits. Besides these, there is a wealth
of other available material.
Captain McHose will be at one of the
forward positions. Although exceedingly
light, McHose is one of the cleverest
floormen and most accurate shots on the i
coast. The other forward position will
be a question. The graduation of "Lefty"
Rogers left a position that will be hard |
to fill. The contest for the job will prob- '
ably lie between Hoffman, captain of the
1925 freshman outfit, and Nevers, of last
year's freshman team. Hoffman was kejit
from the floor last season by injuries, but j
should be in fine shape this year. Nevers
was the center of both the offense and
defense for the frosh a year ago.
At center will be the veteran Steele. |
Although Steele played second fiddle to
Jannsen most of last year, he should be
ready to take over the full duties of the
position now.
"Andy" Anderson and "Cow" Oliva are
two regulars from the '23 squad who
should fill the guard positions to a nicety.
Anderson is a running-guard who is sec
ond to none. To keep Oliva on his toes
to hold the position of standing guard
won last season, will be "Dud" DeGroot,
a veteran of two seasons, and Mcßurney,
a former substitute.
In addition to the men above mentioned,
there are many more men of promise,
who will likely win positions for them
selves. According to plans, the only out
side games scheduled for this quarter
will be played next month.
