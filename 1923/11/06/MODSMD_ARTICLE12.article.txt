# NEW TRACK MATERIAL WORKING OUT FRIDAY AFTERNOONS ON OVAL
## 
### 
With fifty or sixty candidates for
track positions running around the
oval every afternoon, Coach Temple
ton has again started the practice of
informal meets each Friday afternoon.
The first was held last Friday, and
the men did well for so early in the
season. As the time advances toward
the track season, the meets will gradu
ally tighten up until some star ma
terial is uncovered.
Almost all of last year's freshman
squad are on the cinderpath every
afternoon getting into condition. A
large majority of other veterans are
also back.
