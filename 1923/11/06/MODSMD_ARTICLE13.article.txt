# Little Big Game Heads Saturday Sport Program; Tradition Handicaps Dinks
## 
### 
With the pelt of the San Luis Obispo
Polytechnic gridders safely tucked away,
and with their preliminary schedule com
pleted, the Stanford Babes are hard at
work for the "Little Big Game" next
Saturday with the California freshmen.
Since the varsity is playing in Portland
Saturday, the freshman contest will head
the day's sporting card, starting at 2:30
in the stadium.
The Stanford frosh have never been
able to down the Golden Bear Cubs. The
team this year is better than usual. It
has not individual stars but is made up of
eleven experienced, well-coached young
sters, with plenty of dependable substi
tutes who are capable of meeting every
trick the Cubs can spring. The line is
heavy enough to keep the Blue and «£old
back, and the backfield has both weight
and speed.
The big problem before Coach "Husky"
Hunt now is to drive the element of dread
from the first year gridders. This sounds
like a joke, hut it is far from it. Last
year the freshmen were conceded an even
chance to win. but the strain of meeting
the highly-touted Bear eleven proved too
much for the Cardinals and they broke,
with the result that the Bears trampled
over them for a 56-0 victony.
Since the game is on the farm this
year, the Cards have an advantage inas

much as they will be hacked by the Stan
ford rooters, and playing a familiar field.
If the psychological handicap can be re
moved, the Cards should meet the Bears
on even terms, and since the teams are
almost equal, a Stanford victory may
ensue, for the first time.
Hunt .is not under-rating the Blue and
Gold team. They have downed every
eleven they have met, with the exception
of the U. S. C. team which defeated them
by the score of 14-7. The Cubs held the
Southern California freshman during the
first half but the southerners all-star ag
gregation proved too strong in the second
half and succeeded in crossing the goal
line once more than the Berkeley men.
As the U. S. C. frosh downed Hunt's
team 10-0, indications seem that the teams
are about equal.
The Babes showed their grit in the
U. S. C. game. They were expected to
lose by three or four touchdowns, but
they fought the southerners to a stand
still and held them to one touchdown.
This ability to fight may carry them
through to a victory this week.
Raffetto, a 200 Inund tackle, is one of
the dark horses. He has been handi
j capped all season because of injuries but
is rapidly roundit.iutn shape and is ex
nertcrl to be in in k1 condition bv Satur
day. He was given an opportunity last
week to show his ability and lived up to
what was expected of hi in.
Trombetta in the back lie id is another
man of whom the coach expects much.
He is not a flashy player, but lie is a
hard hitting half anu can stand a lot of
heavy work without tiring.
All in all the team is in good shape, and
most of the injured men are recovering
so that they will be able to play Satur
day. No lineup has been announced yet,
as Coach Hunt is experimenting with
different combinations, in an effort to get
the most efficient work from I lie team.
