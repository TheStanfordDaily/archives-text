### David Lamson 
1 If you want to see a football game—be there.
If you want to go to Oregon to see the game next Saturday—be there.
■ If you want to see the Stanford varsity start off to conquer a new world—
J be there.
I The occasion is the bleacher rally in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock. At this time Ram's Head will clash with Sigma Delta Chi in a.'
battle waged on a gridiron. Burt Lapp will announce the name of the person
I or persons who will be the guests of Stanford in witnessing Saturday's game.
Rooters are reminded that the person selected must be present at the rally to
' take advantage of the offer. And the gang will see the team off at the Palo
1 Alto station.
i On the eve of what bids fair to be the strangest struggle ever seen on a

• Stanford football field, varsity squads
of Ram's Head and Sigma Delta Chi
were resting today.
One Never Knows, Does One?
Experts who have been watching the
two teams are frankly at a loss to pre
j diet the winner of the new Battle of
! the Century. The situation is further
complicated by the fact that both cap
: tains are confident of victory. It is
generally believed that for both teams
to win would be impossible.
Nevertheless, "I am sure that Ram's
Head will have no difficulty in over
whelming the journalistic aggrega
tion," said Captain "Kewp" Sproull,
skipper of the actors, in an interview;
while Norris James, leader of the
scribes, stated that Ram's Head would
n't have a prayer once his gang of
ribbon-spoilers got loose.
Dempsey Holds Title
Glancing at the line-up, it would
j seem that Ram's Head has a broad
| edge on its opponents. "Kewp" Sproull
j formerly played on the varsity squad,
| and is one of the best distance men
! Ram's Head can boast. He should also
be good for points in the hurdles.
Dave Mannoccir is a ferocious player,
being especially good on bank shots
to the corner pocket. Gene Trago not
only trills a mean grace note, but has
I been with the varsity at every game in
j the home lot this season. (He is the
lad with the mysterious telephone. In
cidentally, it runs to the press box.)
Concerning the rest of the team,
j little is known, as Sproull has kept
his line-up secret; but a glance at the
Ram's Head rolls will give a fair idea
of the strength of the squad.
Copper Steady; Oil Down
Clarence "Clu" Carey may play at
goal. He is one of the best violinists
that ever handled a polo club. He will
constitute a serious menace to the
journalistic center, Don Liebendorfer.
Lewis Alabaster is a husky young fel
low who should show up well in the
plunge for distance. Horace Allison, in
spite of a tendency to top his muahie
shots, should win most of his serves,
while Jerry Powell is able to step the
distance in something under ten :f
the tide is favorable.
Arnold Bayley and Hollis Chalmers
are a pair that have worked well to
gether in the past, and with Bayley
at jumping center and Chalmers in
terfering, double-cross plays might be
worked successfully by Ram's Head.
Echo Says "Nothing"
Turning now to Sigma Delta Chi,
what shall we say of them? Norris
James, as the captain, has a difficult
role because of the number of didactic
speeches. He makes a powerful figure,
and might be described as a man
mountain. Glenn "Snub" Pollard has
the lowest handicap of any man play
ing, having gone around the course m
under 80. He is a man-mountain. That
man-mountain, Don Liebendorfer,
should place in the ten-foot spring
board competition. Northcutt "Mike"
Ely, a veritable man-mountain, is
clever at passing the buck.
Who's Sorry Now?
Carl Shoup bats around .350 and
fields almost without errors. He has
developed an accurate peg lately in
throws from short-stop to second base,
and he maintains an accurate stroke.
Tom Irwin rows a good bow oar. He
is a man-mountain. Bill Leiser is a
master at handling his craft, under
standing thoroughly the methods of
taking advantage of every breeze.
Allan Charles and John Marble are
man-mountains.
Sigma Delta Chi, being journalists,
are especially good at kicking. Several
of their players may be depended on
to get off puns in a pinch; Bill Wright
and "Pinky" Riter have taken prizes
in punning for distance.
Rain Predicted for Winter
Ram's Head may depend on a charg
ing line to carry the puck down the
alley. It is understood, however, that

the dramatic organization must leave
all four-legged mascots off the field.
So that's that. This football game
will be played at 4 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon, as a part of a bleacher
rally. Following the game, the rooter
who will go to Portland as the guest
of the University will be announced,
and the team will be escorted to the
station maintained by Mr. S. P. Jerry,
turn the crank.

• Stanford football field, varsity squads
of Ram's Head and Sigma Delta Chi
were resting today.
One Never Knows, Does One?
Experts who have been watching the
two teams are frankly at a loss to pre
j diet the winner of the new Battle of
! the Century. The situation is further
complicated by the fact that both cap
: tains are confident of victory. It is
generally believed that for both teams
to win would be impossible.
Nevertheless, "I am sure that Ram's
Head will have no difficulty in over
whelming the journalistic aggrega
tion," said Captain "Kewp" Sproull,
skipper of the actors, in an interview;
while Norris James, leader of the
scribes, stated that Ram's Head would
n't have a prayer once his gang of
ribbon-spoilers got loose.
Dempsey Holds Title
Glancing at the line-up, it would
j seem that Ram's Head has a broad
| edge on its opponents. "Kewp" Sproull
j formerly played on the varsity squad,
| and is one of the best distance men
! Ram's Head can boast. He should also
be good for points in the hurdles.
Dave Mannoccir is a ferocious player,
being especially good on bank shots
to the corner pocket. Gene Trago not
only trills a mean grace note, but has
I been with the varsity at every game in
j the home lot this season. (He is the
lad with the mysterious telephone. In
cidentally, it runs to the press box.)
Concerning the rest of the team,
j little is known, as Sproull has kept
his line-up secret; but a glance at the
Ram's Head rolls will give a fair idea
of the strength of the squad.
Copper Steady; Oil Down
Clarence "Clu" Carey may play at
goal. He is one of the best violinists
that ever handled a polo club. He will
constitute a serious menace to the
journalistic center, Don Liebendorfer.
Lewis Alabaster is a husky young fel
low who should show up well in the
plunge for distance. Horace Allison, in
spite of a tendency to top his muahie
shots, should win most of his serves,
while Jerry Powell is able to step the
distance in something under ten :f
the tide is favorable.
Arnold Bayley and Hollis Chalmers
are a pair that have worked well to
gether in the past, and with Bayley
at jumping center and Chalmers in
terfering, double-cross plays might be
worked successfully by Ram's Head.
Echo Says "Nothing"
Turning now to Sigma Delta Chi,
what shall we say of them? Norris
James, as the captain, has a difficult
role because of the number of didactic
speeches. He makes a powerful figure,
and might be described as a man
mountain. Glenn "Snub" Pollard has
the lowest handicap of any man play
ing, having gone around the course m
under 80. He is a man-mountain. That
man-mountain, Don Liebendorfer,
should place in the ten-foot spring
board competition. Northcutt "Mike"
Ely, a veritable man-mountain, is
clever at passing the buck.
Who's Sorry Now?
Carl Shoup bats around .350 and
fields almost without errors. He has
developed an accurate peg lately in
throws from short-stop to second base,
and he maintains an accurate stroke.
Tom Irwin rows a good bow oar. He
is a man-mountain. Bill Leiser is a
master at handling his craft, under
standing thoroughly the methods of
taking advantage of every breeze.
Allan Charles and John Marble are
man-mountains.
Sigma Delta Chi, being journalists,
are especially good at kicking. Several
of their players may be depended on
to get off puns in a pinch; Bill Wright
and "Pinky" Riter have taken prizes
in punning for distance.
Rain Predicted for Winter
Ram's Head may depend on a charg
ing line to carry the puck down the
alley. It is understood, however, that

the dramatic organization must leave
all four-legged mascots off the field.
So that's that. This football game
will be played at 4 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon, as a part of a bleacher
rally. Following the game, the rooter
who will go to Portland as the guest
of the University will be announced,
and the team will be escorted to the
station maintained by Mr. S. P. Jerry,
turn the crank.
1 If you want to see a football game—be there.
If you want to go to Oregon to see the game next Saturday—be there.
■ If you want to see the Stanford varsity start off to conquer a new world—
J be there.
I The occasion is the bleacher rally in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock. At this time Ram's Head will clash with Sigma Delta Chi in a.'
battle waged on a gridiron. Burt Lapp will announce the name of the person
I or persons who will be the guests of Stanford in witnessing Saturday's game.
Rooters are reminded that the person selected must be present at the rally to
' take advantage of the offer. And the gang will see the team off at the Palo
1 Alto station.

Glancing at the line-up, it would
j seem that Ram's Head has a broad
| edge on its opponents. "Kewp" Sproull
j formerly played on the varsity squad,
| and is one of the best distance men
! Ram's Head can boast. He should also
be good for points in the hurdles.
Dave Mannoccir is a ferocious player,
being especially good on bank shots
to the corner pocket. Gene Trago not
only trills a mean grace note, but has
I been with the varsity at every game in
j the home lot this season. (He is the
lad with the mysterious telephone. In
cidentally, it runs to the press box.)
Concerning the rest of the team,
j little is known, as Sproull has kept
his line-up secret; but a glance at the
Ram's Head rolls will give a fair idea
of the strength of the squad.
Copper Steady; Oil Down
Clarence "Clu" Carey may play at
goal. He is one of the best violinists
that ever handled a polo club. He will
constitute a serious menace to the
journalistic center, Don Liebendorfer.
Lewis Alabaster is a husky young fel
low who should show up well in the
plunge for distance. Horace Allison, in
spite of a tendency to top his muahie
shots, should win most of his serves,
while Jerry Powell is able to step the
distance in something under ten :f
the tide is favorable.
Arnold Bayley and Hollis Chalmers
are a pair that have worked well to
gether in the past, and with Bayley
at jumping center and Chalmers in
terfering, double-cross plays might be
worked successfully by Ram's Head.
Echo Says "Nothing"
Turning now to Sigma Delta Chi,
what shall we say of them? Norris
James, as the captain, has a difficult
role because of the number of didactic
speeches. He makes a powerful figure,
and might be described as a man
mountain. Glenn "Snub" Pollard has
the lowest handicap of any man play
ing, having gone around the course m
under 80. He is a man-mountain. That
man-mountain, Don Liebendorfer,
should place in the ten-foot spring
board competition. Northcutt "Mike"
Ely, a veritable man-mountain, is
clever at passing the buck.
Who's Sorry Now?
Carl Shoup bats around .350 and
fields almost without errors. He has
developed an accurate peg lately in
throws from short-stop to second base,
and he maintains an accurate stroke.
Tom Irwin rows a good bow oar. He
is a man-mountain. Bill Leiser is a
master at handling his craft, under
standing thoroughly the methods of
taking advantage of every breeze.
Allan Charles and John Marble are
man-mountains.
Sigma Delta Chi, being journalists,
are especially good at kicking. Several
of their players may be depended on
to get off puns in a pinch; Bill Wright
and "Pinky" Riter have taken prizes
in punning for distance.
Rain Predicted for Winter
Ram's Head may depend on a charg
ing line to carry the puck down the
alley. It is understood, however, that

the dramatic organization must leave
all four-legged mascots off the field.
So that's that. This football game
will be played at 4 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon, as a part of a bleacher
rally. Following the game, the rooter
who will go to Portland as the guest
of the University will be announced,
and the team will be escorted to the
station maintained by Mr. S. P. Jerry,
turn the crank.
1 If you want to see a football game—be there.
If you want to go to Oregon to see the game next Saturday—be there.
■ If you want to see the Stanford varsity start off to conquer a new world—
J be there.
I The occasion is the bleacher rally in the stadium tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock. At this time Ram's Head will clash with Sigma Delta Chi in a.'
battle waged on a gridiron. Burt Lapp will announce the name of the person
I or persons who will be the guests of Stanford in witnessing Saturday's game.
Rooters are reminded that the person selected must be present at the rally to
' take advantage of the offer. And the gang will see the team off at the Palo
1 Alto station.
i On the eve of what bids fair to be the strangest struggle ever seen on a

• Stanford football field, varsity squads
of Ram's Head and Sigma Delta Chi
were resting today.
One Never Knows, Does One?
Experts who have been watching the
two teams are frankly at a loss to pre
j diet the winner of the new Battle of
! the Century. The situation is further
complicated by the fact that both cap
: tains are confident of victory. It is
generally believed that for both teams
to win would be impossible.
Nevertheless, "I am sure that Ram's
Head will have no difficulty in over
whelming the journalistic aggrega
tion," said Captain "Kewp" Sproull,
skipper of the actors, in an interview;
while Norris James, leader of the
scribes, stated that Ram's Head would
n't have a prayer once his gang of
ribbon-spoilers got loose.
