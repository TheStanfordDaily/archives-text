A consolidation of two societies which have
hitherto looked upon each other with mutual disgust
was announced in yesterday's Daily Palo Alto.
Press Club and Sigma Delta Chi, long antagonistic
in sentiment and duplicate in interest, came together
without bloodshed by an agreement perfected last
week, and henceforth will continue as one body to
carry on the work they tried to do before under the
interlocking directorate system.
This consolidation plan, while not applicable to
a great many organizations on the campus because
their mutual interest and rivalry promotes their own
welfare, could just as well be applied to some of the
most ponderous of them. Leaving out the honor
societies whose chief function is initiation, there are
about ten groups on the campus who could, if they
would consent to give up excess jewelry, combine
into single organizations working towards a com
mon momentum. Three dramatic societies, two
frankly athletic organizations, two groups for those
men on the campus who think they are running
things, and a multitude of lesser bodies not so close
to the center of the solar system are now pictured
and listed in the Quad every year for no purpose
except that they cannot overcome their inherent
lethargy enough to combine their energy. With
the example already set, it is tentatively hoped that
other organizations* will see their way clear to a
combination for the benefit of the interests they
represent.
