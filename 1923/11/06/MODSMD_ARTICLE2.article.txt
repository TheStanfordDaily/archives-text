# ADVISORY BOARD FOR ENCINA DINING HALL HAS BEEN ELECTED
## 
### 
Inaugurating a new system, the men at
the Encina dining halls have elected rep
resentatives to act as an advisory board.
"We want student co-operation," says
Miss Handy, present manager of the din
ing halls, "and we think that by this
method we can get it."
There are to be fourteen members on
the board, two each from the two large
dining rooms, one each .from three
smaller dining rooms, one each from the
five eating clubs, Miss Handy, and Comp
troller Roth.
All complaints and suggestions are to
lÂ»e taken care of by the board. They are
to regulate the price of the meals. The
dining rooms are run on a non-profit plan
and if the board sees fit to low er the price
of the meal ticket below the present price
of a $1 a day, they may do so.
