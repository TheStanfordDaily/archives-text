# Scholarship by Desire
## 
### 
An English professor recently told of an audience
in a foreign quarter theater which contained more
copies of Shakespeare and the classics per pocket
than any American audience would think could be
transported. The foreigners appreciated the best
works of their adopted language, and had not as yet
acquired that artificial indifference which prevented
their saying so.
Americans, who are supposed to be the best edu
cated of peoples, have less of the scholarly attitude
and less of the desire of knowledge because the joy
derived, than the foreigners who land with nothing
more than a hope to succeed in a new country and
an English-Scandahoovian dictionary.
People who are supposed to have been educated
in the best high schools the country can provide do
not have the cultural ambition of these "illiterate"
foreigners with nothing but a thumbed dictionary
and an intense desire to learn. The result is, that
the foreigners often outstrip the education given
free to the high school attendants, simply because
the Americans don't want to learn, feeling that they
know enough to "get by" already. The mentality
required to appreciate artistic effort is too much of
a strain on their laziness.
The function of a college is to jar its students
out of this "get by" attitude. If such an awakening
is not accomplished, either the college or the student
lias failed in purpose.
