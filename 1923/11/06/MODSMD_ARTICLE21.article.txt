With an eye full of tears we call your
sympathetic attention to the plaint of the
University of Southern California. One of
their men got his ribs caved in. He says
one of our men kicked him. The audience
will please stop cheering while we go on
to say that the University of Southern
California says that they don't mind so
much the idea of one, of our men kicking
one of their men so much because they kick
them themselves once in a while but the
unsportsmanlike thing about this kicking
was that our man didn't give the University
of Southern California man time to get his
brass knuckles out of his vest pocket, with
the result that they were kicked right into
the middle of his left lung and didn't agree
with him. —N. E.

"I didn't know you could play."

used to." —N. E.

Men's Council asks us to deny the rumor that with
the prospects of mid-quarters the applications for early
trials are mounting. But they do say that in case any
one plans on doing any plain or fancy cribbing it would
be a good idea to put in their application for a trial
ahead of time, as there is bound to be a good deal of a
rush, and late applicants are liable to have to change
their week-end plans. —N. E.

With an eye full of tears we call your
sympathetic attention to the plaint of the
University of Southern California. One of
their men got his ribs caved in. He says
one of our men kicked him. The audience
will please stop cheering while we go on
to say that the University of Southern
California says that they don't mind so
much the idea of one, of our men kicking
one of their men so much because they kick
them themselves once in a while but the
unsportsmanlike thing about this kicking
was that our man didn't give the University
of Southern California man time to get his
brass knuckles out of his vest pocket, with
the result that they were kicked right into
the middle of his left lung and didn't agree
with him. —N. E.
