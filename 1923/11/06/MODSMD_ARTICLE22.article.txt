"THE COMMON LAW," Stanford Theatre. We would
wax poetic about this picture, but we've run out of wax.
Anyway, it's a nice, naughty picture, one that Robert
W. Chambers should be proud of, and we remember
it rightly. The general theme is that some scion of a
wealthy house is quite a painter, with a studio, etc. A
young girl comes in one day, looking for work as a
model. For this secene the camera man is shooed off
to the other side of the lot behind a pillar, where he
photographs it. Sadie is afflicted with a weak heart,
and the undue exposure of the cold studio quite over
comes her. She faints, and falls, pulling down a
voluminous tapestry in her descent. The camera man
rushes up, but it's too late. The young artist has
brought her to, and fallen madly in love with her.
His parents object to the marriage, and the girl de
clares that her love for him is such that she will be his
common law wife. Just about this time one of the
conventional things happens (I forget whether the par
ents repent, or the mortgage is paid off, or somebody
kills somebody) and the picture has one of those happy
endings such as is always tacked on the last of every
well-bred picture.
In a word, unless the censors get out the scissors
after reading this, a picture well worth thirty cents.
