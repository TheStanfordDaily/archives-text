The third act of the
season's latest play
droned on mercilessly,
at least for a certain
notable dramatic critic
who sat regarding the
players as if they were
pet Pomeranians at a
fashionable dog show.
Already he was forming
the damning phrases that
would bark from his
column in the morrow's
paper. Persiflage . . .
stark pathos . . . hokum . . .
During the fourth act he
became aware of people
around him. Not a few
were weeping; others
looked bored; some had
no expression; many
seemed entranced. He saw
the light: There were as
many plays being acted on
that stage as there were
people in the audience.
And for the week he was
eminently charitable
in all his reviews.
