### Marjorie Allen 
"The differences between American
and English colleges are the result of
the difference in the lower school sys
tem," says Dr. Terrot Reaveley Glover, j
fellow of St. John's College, Cam
bridge, and a recent lecturer on the
Stanford campus.
"It is only natural that the college
life of students educated in schools
maintained only for the purpose of
preparing them for the university
should be different from that of young
boys and girls who have been educated
in the lower grades under the Ameri
can system. Secondary schools in Eng
land specialize in ancient languages
and mathematics while a general edu
cation is given in America.
"College men do not wear corduroys
in England, The costume is quite dif-!
ferent there. Men who are attending
the university wear the regulation cap
and gown," Dr. Glover continues. "Of
course, athletics play an important
part in English college life. English
college men are as interested in their
games as you are in yours.
"Co-education? No we do not have
that in England. The women attend
their own colleges and the men attend
theirs. The men and women sometimes
attend the same lecture courses of
fered by the university as whole, how
ever.
"To come right down to it, though,
there is not much difference in the
college students," concludes Dr. Glo
ver. Then, in his English accent and
with a twinkle in his eye, he added,
"Except for the fact that American
college women use more 'coloring mat
ter' than the English girls."
