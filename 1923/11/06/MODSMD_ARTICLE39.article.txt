# Lost and Found Office Asks For Co-operation
## 
### 
The Lost and Found department, j
j conducted at the cashier's desk in the
Accounting department on the second
floor of the Administration building,
urges that all books, fountain pens,
and other articles found be turned in
as promptly as possible, and that in- ;
quiry for lost property be made im-j
mediately after losing. This will
facilitate the work of the department,
and it is hoped will help decrease the
large number of unclaimed articles. 1
