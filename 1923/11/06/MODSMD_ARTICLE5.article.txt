## 
### 
Members of the Freshman Class will
start collecting lumber for the con
struction of the annual Bonfire next
Saturday, according to Wallace Jayred,
chairman of the bonfire construction
committee. Material for the inside of
( the structure will be gathered up from
all the scrap piles on the campus and
I other available sources. Fraternities
i and sororities are requested to clean
[ up their premises and place the rub-
I bish outside where it can be collected
i easily by the freshmen either Supday
or Monday.
Each freshman will put in fifteen
hours of work on the fire and six hours
of guarding. A card index will be kept
1 and each man will be checked off for
; the time he works. Men can work at
any time during the day and someone
I will be present at all times to take
the time and to direct the construc
tion work. Those men who do not put
in the required time will be given a
little private entertainment by their
classmates, it is hinted.
