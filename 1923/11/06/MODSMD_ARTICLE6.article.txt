# SENIOR GRID ELEVEN LOSES TO FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Fumbling repeatedly, the senior inter
class grid eleven went down to defeat
yesterday before an organized yearling
offense, 6 to 2.
The sponsor aggregation exhibited a
strong offensive punch but its fumbles j
not only lost it the chance to score but j
started the freshmen on their march to!
the only touchdown of the game.
Within three minutes after the opening
whistle, the seniors were on the twenty- I
yard line and in striking distance of the j
goal. On the next play, however, a con- j
fusion of signals resulted in a fumble and j
the lost of the ball to the babes. Two
minutes more and the latter, through long
end runs, had the ball in senior territory
and Harvey, skirting the senior right end,
went scros for the touchdown. The year- j
lings failed to convert.
At the opening of the second half, it j
seemed as though a score would result — i
fumble or no fumble—from the new j
driving power exhibited by the seniors, j
With Copeland making long gains I
through the line and Benninger skirting j
the freshman end for considerable yard- j
age, the sponsors placed the pigskin on j
the two-yard line—only to lose ground
by two penalties and the ball to the first- J
year men.
The freshman line gave way 011 the ;
next yearling play and their backfield was j
thrown for a loss and a safety—giving j
the seniors their lone two points.
Undoubtedly, the yearling organization,
the result of long and thorough coaching
and practice, won the game for the babes,
for it was their ability to take advantage j
of the breaks as well as make gains
around the senior ends that gave them a
score.
Harvey on the open-field offense, and ,
Hunt at defense, did good work for the j
freshmen in the backfield while McAUis-!
ter and Carniato showed up well on the
line.
On the other hand, the individual play-1
ing of a number of senior gridmen was
exceptional}' good. On the line Coach!
Jarvis at center, Hays and Symonds as!
tackles made it nearly impossible for the ;
yearling backs to make headway through
the forward wall.
I In the backfield, Copeland hit the line;
! well, as usual, and Benninger made most,
I of the yardage around end.
One of the striking points of the game j
I was the punting of Allen, who averaged i
about 47 yards. Allen, by the way, has
j been averaging 58 yards in practice.

ter and Carniato showed up well on the
line.

Jarvis at center, Hays and Symonds as!
tackles made it nearly impossible for the ;
yearling backs to make headway through
the forward wall.
I In the backfield, Copeland hit the line;
! well, as usual, and Benninger made most,
I of the yardage around end.
One of the striking points of the game j
I was the punting of Allen, who averaged i
about 47 yards. Allen, by the way, has
j been averaging 58 yards in practice.
Fumbling repeatedly, the senior inter
class grid eleven went down to defeat
yesterday before an organized yearling
offense, 6 to 2.
The sponsor aggregation exhibited a
strong offensive punch but its fumbles j
not only lost it the chance to score but j
started the freshmen on their march to!
the only touchdown of the game.
Within three minutes after the opening
whistle, the seniors were on the twenty- I
yard line and in striking distance of the j
goal. On the next play, however, a con- j
fusion of signals resulted in a fumble and j
the lost of the ball to the babes. Two
minutes more and the latter, through long
end runs, had the ball in senior territory
and Harvey, skirting the senior right end,
went scros for the touchdown. The year- j
lings failed to convert.
At the opening of the second half, it j
seemed as though a score would result — i
fumble or no fumble—from the new j
driving power exhibited by the seniors, j
With Copeland making long gains I
through the line and Benninger skirting j
the freshman end for considerable yard- j
age, the sponsors placed the pigskin on j
the two-yard line—only to lose ground
by two penalties and the ball to the first- J
year men.
The freshman line gave way 011 the ;
next yearling play and their backfield was j
thrown for a loss and a safety—giving j
the seniors their lone two points.
Undoubtedly, the yearling organization,
the result of long and thorough coaching
and practice, won the game for the babes,
for it was their ability to take advantage j
of the breaks as well as make gains
around the senior ends that gave them a
score.
Harvey on the open-field offense, and ,
Hunt at defense, did good work for the j
freshmen in the backfield while McAUis-!
ter and Carniato showed up well on the
line.
