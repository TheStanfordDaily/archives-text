# SENIOR GRID ELEVEN LOSES TO FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Fumbling repeatedly, the senior inter
class grid eleven went down to defeat
yesterday before an organized yearling
offense, 6 to 2.
The sponsor aggregation exhibited a
strong offensive punch but its fumbles j
not only lost it the chance to score but j
started the freshmen on their march to!
the only touchdown of the game.
Within three minutes after the opening
whistle, the seniors were on the twenty- I
yard line and in striking distance of the j
goal. On the next play, however, a con- j
fusion of signals resulted in a fumble and j
the lost of the ball to the babes. Two
minutes more and the latter, through long
end runs, had the ball in senior territory
and Harvey, skirting the senior right end,
went scros for the touchdown. The year- j
lings failed to convert.
At the opening of the second half, it j
seemed as though a score would result — i
fumble or no fumble—from the new j
driving power exhibited by the seniors, j
With Copeland making long gains I
through the line and Benninger skirting j
the freshman end for considerable yard- j
age, the sponsors placed the pigskin on j
the two-yard line—only to lose ground
by two penalties and the ball to the first- J
year men.
The freshman line gave way 011 the ;
next yearling play and their backfield was j
thrown for a loss and a safety—giving j
the seniors their lone two points.
