# SCHOLARSHIP GIVEN IN MEMORY OF EARLY RESIDENT OF CAMPUS
## 
### 
As a memorial to her husband, the
late Orrin W. Dunn, a pioneer resi- j
dent of the Stanford campus, Mrs. |
Dunn has established the Orrin W. i
Dunn Scholarship at Stanford by pre
senting to the University a house and
lot in Palo Alto. The income from
this property assures a scholarship of
about $250 at the present time. The ;
University is given complete power
to control or dispose of the property
for the maintenance of the Scholar
ship.
The recipient of the scholarship,
according to the terms of the gift, is
to be a man student of at least junior
standing in engineering, chemistry,
geology, or medicine.
It has been awarded this year to
Norman Dole of Riverside, a present
day representative of the Doles
famous in Stanford athletic history,
himself a middle-distance man on the
track and end in football. Dole is an
engineering student.
Mr. and Mrs. Dunn were attracted
to the Stanford campus when they
visited it on a trip through California
in the first days of the University,
and in 1894 made it their permanent
residence. Mr. Dunn aided many
Stanford men and students enterpri
ses in a quiet way during the years he
lived at Stanford.
