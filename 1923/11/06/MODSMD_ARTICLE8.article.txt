# CARDINALS PLAY OREGON VARSITY ELEVEN SATURDAY
## Stanford Football Men to Leave for Portland Wednesday Night 
### 
The University of Oregon will be
j the next opponents of the rejuvenated
Cardinal varsity at Portland, Oregon,
next Saturday. Approximately twenty
six men, whose names have not yet
1 been announced, will take the north
ern trip. They will leave Wednesday
night after the football rally in the
stadium.
Some ambitious campus song-writer,
with an idea of becoming popular,
should write a few lines on the "Pass
ing of the Six-Minute Varsity." It
would be a wonderful think to hark
back to, now that the Stanford foot'
j ball team has become an-entire-game
j scorer, a real representative in the
field of football, and a team for Andy
Smith to keep his eyes on.
What left a bitter taste in Andy
Smith's mouth was not only the prac
tical defeat of his California eleven,
but the power and aggressiveness dis
played by the Cardinal team, com
posed as it was of eight substitutes,
and three regulars.
If the California mentor expected to
see any mysterious plays unravelled
by the Stanford men he must have
gone back sorely disappointed. Stan-:
ford, with the possible exception of
one fake play, kept within the usual
bounds of straight football. The team
didn't need surprise plays. The line
was punching hard, the ends were
under the kicks, back-field men were
gaining at will, and the kickers were
well protected.
The substitute line which was used
for the greater part of the game
weighed, on the average, exactly one
pound less than the regular defense.
The regulars average, from end to end,
187 pounds, and the substitutes 186.
The contest might well be termed
the comeback of Murray Cuddeback,
or the finding of Fred Solomon. Both
backs played the games of their lives.
The dash of the former had been evi
dent to. the onlookers all during prac
tice the week before the game, and
his playing Saturday left no doubt In
anyone's mind as to his ability to
continue as a star.
Solomon hit the line hard, and fast.
His speed was often enough to drive
him two or three yards farther than
he otherwise would have gone. With
the possible exception of Murray Cud
deback, Solomon played the best game
of any of the backfield men.
"Tex" Middleton also made a name
for himself, and Armour proved that
getting through the line to block punt 3
is not all luck. This is the second
time the big substitute tackle has torn
through and pulled the same trick.

pound less than the regular defense.
The regulars average, from end to end,
187 pounds, and the substitutes 186.
The contest might well be termed
the comeback of Murray Cuddeback,
or the finding of Fred Solomon. Both
backs played the games of their lives.
The dash of the former had been evi
dent to. the onlookers all during prac
tice the week before the game, and
his playing Saturday left no doubt In
anyone's mind as to his ability to
continue as a star.
Solomon hit the line hard, and fast.
His speed was often enough to drive
him two or three yards farther than
he otherwise would have gone. With
the possible exception of Murray Cud
deback, Solomon played the best game
of any of the backfield men.
"Tex" Middleton also made a name
for himself, and Armour proved that
getting through the line to block punt 3
is not all luck. This is the second
time the big substitute tackle has torn
through and pulled the same trick.

The University of Oregon will be
j the next opponents of the rejuvenated
Cardinal varsity at Portland, Oregon,
next Saturday. Approximately twenty
six men, whose names have not yet
1 been announced, will take the north
ern trip. They will leave Wednesday
night after the football rally in the
stadium.
Some ambitious campus song-writer,
with an idea of becoming popular,
should write a few lines on the "Pass
ing of the Six-Minute Varsity." It
would be a wonderful think to hark
back to, now that the Stanford foot'
j ball team has become an-entire-game
j scorer, a real representative in the
field of football, and a team for Andy
Smith to keep his eyes on.
What left a bitter taste in Andy
Smith's mouth was not only the prac
tical defeat of his California eleven,
but the power and aggressiveness dis
played by the Cardinal team, com
posed as it was of eight substitutes,
and three regulars.
If the California mentor expected to
see any mysterious plays unravelled
by the Stanford men he must have
gone back sorely disappointed. Stan-:
ford, with the possible exception of
one fake play, kept within the usual
bounds of straight football. The team
didn't need surprise plays. The line
was punching hard, the ends were
under the kicks, back-field men were
gaining at will, and the kickers were
well protected.
The substitute line which was used
for the greater part of the game
weighed, on the average, exactly one
pound less than the regular defense.
The regulars average, from end to end,
187 pounds, and the substitutes 186.
