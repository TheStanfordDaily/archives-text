# MALONEY PREPARES SOCCERITES FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## 
### 
With last Saturday's 3-1 defeat at the
hands- of the Sons of Norway still fresh
in mind, Coach Maloney is making a
few changes in his varsity soccer team
previous to the game with California next
Monday. Both the varsity and freshman
games will be played at Berkeley.
Maloney's latest change is the moving
of Schoen to left half, and changing
Franklin to fullback. As both these men
arc natural halfbacks, they are finding it
difficult to adjust themselves to the dif
ferent playing conditions in the fullback
territory. However, this should greatly
strengthen the backfield.
Munford has been moved from inside
right to right half, where he is replacing
Bucklin. Munford failed to show any
punch in the forward position last Sat
urday, and should render a better account
for himself in his new position.
With practice every night for both
freshmen and varsity, they should be in
good condition to face the Blue and Gold.
The freshmen should have little trouble
in winning, since they present the strong
est first year lineup in years. The var
sity, however, must show a vast improve
ment if they are to win.
