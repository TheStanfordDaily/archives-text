# PROFESSOR SWAIN BELIEVES FRANCE SELF-SUSTAINING
## Conditions Bad in England And Germany, Is Opinion Of Chemistry Head 
### 
Characterizing France as the "most'
nearly self-sustaining country of Eu
rope," Professor R. E. Swain, head of
the Chemistry department, compared
the economic condition of that nation
with the conditions of Germany and
England, in his talk yesterday eve
ning.
"France has the outstanding appear
ance of prosperity," he explained. "The
public markets are flourishing and at- !
tractive. Many millions of dollars are
coming to France from the iron mines
of Lorraine, and reconstruction of the
devastated area has solved the labor
problem."
Professor Swain commented on the j
fact that the cities were being rebuilt
just as they were before the war. The
new parts of Rheims have the same
narrow, crooked streets, and a num
ber of other places are being rebuilt
on the old lines. He condemned this :
method as inadequate and unattrac- ■
tive.
A visit to the grave of a Stanford
man in the cemetery near Belleau
Wood brought to Professor Swain's;
mind the reflection that another con
flict like the Great War ought never
to happen again. "There is something
wrong with a civilization that will per
mit this means of settling interna
tional difficulties," he said.
The situation in Germany is very 1
different from that of France, accord
ing to Professor Swain. In order to
help the labor situation, Germany, al- j
though so nearly bankrupt, is engaged
in a great building revival. Many peo
ple have been reduced from moderate
circumstances to poverty.
"I fepent an afternoon with a chem
ist whom I had known on my former
trips. We talked of the outside world, '
and he told me that in five years he
had not seen a foreign journal. He i
was hungry for news. His income was
reduced to $8 a month, and he felt 1
that his life's work was ended. This is
the situation and attitude of all the ;
middle class," he pointed out.
Professor Swain described England
as still suffering severely from the
effects of the war. This can be seen
by the number of families from which
one or more sons are gone. The peo- ■
pie are not so well dressed as formerly
and fewer pleasure excursions are ■
taken.
"The Englishman possesses the I
ability of attacking big things and I
everlastingly seeing them through." J
Although he works five months out of j
the twelve just to pay his taxes, he j
accepts all with good cheer and a ;
smile.','- - ,
Believing that the future of the 1
world lies in the continued friendship
of the United States and Great Britain,
Professor Swain urged a strengthen
ing of the bonds between the two na
tions.
