# BABES DETERMINED TO GIVE BERKELEY COBS FIRST DEFEAT
## Team Is Rounding Into Good Shape; Injuries Will Not Handicap Players

With the climax of their season but
three days away, the Babe footballers
are hard at work preparing for the in
vasion of the Bear cubß in the sta
dium Saturday afternoon. The '27
freshman eleven is determined to be
the first in the history of Stanford
football to turn the trick, and down
the Blue and Gold first-year men.
Light scrimmages will be in order
today and tomorrow. Coach "Husky"
Hunt will not allow much heavy work
before the game as he is taking no
chances on having any of his men in
jured. Dummy practice, work on the
charging machine, and passing and
punting practice featured the work
out last night.
All of the men appear to be in good
shape, and those who were injured
earlier in the season have, without ex
ception, recovered from their injuries.
By Saturday all of the men should be
in the pink of condition.
Coach Hunt received a setback the
other day when Stockholm, who
played at left tackle, decided to quit
school. The hole left in the line by his
loss will be filled by either Raft'etto or
Poulson.
The choice for center is still un
decided. Hunt has two of the best
centers turned out in southern Cali
fornia last year to choose from. Natch
er, who played for L. A. Poly, and
Price, who was pivot man on the Long
Beach eleven, are the players he must
choose between. Both know football,
but Natcher seems to have an advan
tage, as he is ten pounds heavier, and
