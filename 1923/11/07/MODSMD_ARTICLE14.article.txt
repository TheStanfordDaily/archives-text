# Stanford Man's "Line" Insipid And Hackneyed, Claim Women
## 
### 
What is a "LINE?" Several Stan-,
ford women were interviewed this
week on the question, especially as
regards the brand furnished by the
Stanford man. All report that on the
whole, it is a rather obvious and un
developed conglomeration of hack
neyed witticisms and attempted flat-!
teries causing much hilarity in the i
"sessions" which take place in sorority ;
attics.
"The average man around here,"
says one Roble woman, "talks like a 1
regular kid. Tie thinks he is givhig you :
a real treat, when most of the time it
is the same old stuff you have been
hearing since childhood. The Eastern
men have WONDERFUL lines. These
men have more polish and can really
make you believe what they are toll
ing you."
"A Stanford man will never admit
he is a snake," according to the sweet
heart of Kappa Gamma Phi. "His fa
vorite exercise is denouncing the in
creasing number of reptiles that are
invading the 'Farm.' lie savs that

campus women are highbrows and HE j
wouldn't be seen with one of them.
But when he is asked what he is doing
out on this occasion, his clever and
overwhelming comeback is always,
"O, you're different'!"
"The telephone LINE is the most
usual of all," another says. 'Some men
call you tip at about fi o'clock to ask
for a date that night and you feel it
coming before vou tell them that you
have one already. 'That's the trouble
with you co-eds,' they say, 'You're so
popular a fellow has to call you up a
month or so ahead of time. Next time
I'll have to see you on Registration
day.* That never fails to get by large
with us."
But. Cleo, the newly-initiated mem
ber of Delta Pi Alpha, has a good
word for the Stanford "Queener." "At
lenst they don't start in to tell you
about the rough and tough parties
they have been on. and the wild wo
ment they had out the night before.
They usually try some of their own
originality before they fall back on
that gag." 1
