# VARSITY FOOTBALL SQUAD LEA VES ON 5:19 TRAIN NORTH
## Twenty-nine Men Compose Cardinal Team Which Will Meet Oregon Next Saturday Afternoon 
### 
Andy Kerr's Stanford varsity foot
ball team will leave Palo Alto tonight
for Portland on the 5:19 train. The
team will eat dinner at the States I
restaurant in the city and take the
Shasta Limited from the Oakland pier
at 8:05 p. m.
Twenty-nine men have been selected
by Kerr to meet the University of Ore
gon next Saturday. They are: Armour,
Baker, Campbell, Cleaveland, Cravens,
Cuddeback, Dole, Dennis, Faville,!
!
Hunt, Hey, Johnston, Kelley, Kirwan, 1
Jim Lawson, Ludeke, Loomis, McDer-j

Mont, Middleton, Mitchell. Neill, Nev
ers, Shipkey, Solomon, Thomas, Van
Hook, Widaman, Woodward, and
Wheat.
Almost every man making the trip
will probably play against the Oregon
eleven at Portland. With only a few
exceptions the substitutes seem to be
as strong as the regulars.
It is uncertain whether or not Jim
Lawson will play. The three strained
muscles in his body have not yet com
pletely healed. To replace Lawson,
however, Kerr has the choice of Dole,
Middleton, McDermont, or Thomas.
Each of these men have proved them
selves to be valuable ends, lacking,
however, the Lawson knack for catch
ing passes, and precision in tackling.
In Portland, Andy Kerr will have
more of a chance to try out some of
the new plays, preparatory to the Cali
fornia game. The Card mentor has
had to be careful in using any trick
formations because of the watchful
eyes of Bear supporters who come pre
pared with pad and pencil.
Kerr would not announce the line-up
of the team in the Oregon contest. In
all probability there will fog a f ew
| changes, with the regulars back in
I their old berths. It is the coach's ob
ject, however, to save the men as
much as possible for the Berkeley
game, and rather than take a chance
on incurring damaging injuries he
might start with the same line-up as
j last Saturday.
