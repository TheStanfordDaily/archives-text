# GRAYS MEET BRUIN RESERVES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Mike Reed, Gray eleven coach, feels
that hip squad is in good condition to
j meet the strong California reserve
team in the stadium next Saturday.
The strength which the Cardinals
have displayed against the few com
petitors is indicative of the best re
serve team in many years. The fact
that Andy Kerr has been drawing
regularly on the reserves has made it
difficult for Reed to give the eleven
his constant attention and coaching.
Several members of the Stanford
squad ar'i of varsity calibre. "Nick"
Kirwan will leave with the varsity
for Portland, thus leaving the team
minus the bulwark and brains of the
offense. "Porky" Dwight and Jack Er
horn, both good ground-gainers, are
i
expected to start in the Gray line-up.
| "Chuck" Stratton, fullback, is a hard
line-hitter, and Harvey Coverley is a
dependable substitute.
Practice this week will consist
chiefly of scrimmages with the scrub
freshman squads, and signal practices.
The strength of the team consists
wholly of end runs and off-tackle
plays. The passing to date has been
very ragged and not at all consistent.
Should Andy Kerr decide to keep
members of the third varsity team on
the Gray team, California will meet
a formidable aggregation. Otherwise
the squad will be left weakened in
weight, and in offensive ability.
