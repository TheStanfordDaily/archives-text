# CARD BOXERS, FENCERS, TO PERFORM TONIGHT
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney will take four
boxers and three fencers to San Ma
teo tonight to put on an athletic show
for the Sons of St. George of that city.
These are the first scheduled matches
the men have appeared in this season.
Although the trio of fencers have
not yet been announced, Gardiner of
last year's varsity will be included.
Coach Maloney will also don the pad
ded vest for a short session.
A 115-pound match between Freeman
and Walsh should be the main attrac
tion of the evening. Freeman has re
turned to Stanford after a year's ab
sence at the Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, where he won the 115-pound
championship. Freeman is a fast man,
although not a heavy hitter. He should
improve in the hitting line, however,
and offer good competition to Brad
Simmonds, former varsity man who
has returned this year. Walsh is in
experienced, but may offer stiff compe
tition to Freeman.
Little is known of the work of
Heston or Nelson, middleweights,
both being new men this year. Reports
show that both have been showing up
well in practice, so a fast match should
result.
