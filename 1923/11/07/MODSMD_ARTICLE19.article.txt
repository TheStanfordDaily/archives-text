# SOPHOMORE COTILLION TICKETS SELL RAPIDLY
## 
### 
Nearly 200 tickets for the sophomore
cotillion on November 16 have been
sold this week. A maximum of 350
tickets has been set. The tickets are
now on sale to the entire student
body. It is expected that the next two
days will see the sale completed.
No particulars regarding the decora
tions have been released although it
is announced that the general scheme
will be colonial. The dance room will
represent an outdoor scene and the
entire effect is planned to give an at
mosphere of old Southern hospitality.
Music will be furnished by the Fair
mont hotel's eight-piece orchestra. The
Fairmont orchestra is noted for its
'â€¢worked-up" pieces, its cornet and ban
jo players being especially good.
Those wishing to secure tickets
should purchase them at once at the
Stanford bookstore.
