# Letter Award for First Team Players
## 
### 
An injustice to Stanford athletes, and a lowering
of the standard of athletic awards was abolished by
the Executive Committee last night.
The German "S" which was to have been granted
to players on the Gray football team was rescinded
on report from the Physical Education department
that almost all those coaches and sport leaders who
had in the first place signed the petition for the
award had changed their stand, feeling that the
award would be unfair to those members of the first
varsity squad who worked all through the year and
did not make their letters.
It was also pointed out that the Executive Com
mittee would have to award German "S" 's to bas
ketball, baseball, track, and tennis, and circle German
"S" 's. to swimming, soccer, and all other minor
sports which could get intercollegiate second-team
competition.
This shower of awards could do nothing but
cheapen the value of the present awards of block
and circle "S" 's.
The action was taken on recommendation of a
majority of the Physical Education staff without
waiting for a report on eligibility by the Coast
Conference. At one time it was thought that the
award might make the holders ineligible for varsity
competition one year, by Conference rules, but that
ruling had not as yet been made when the matter
was brought before the committee for reconsidera
tion.
