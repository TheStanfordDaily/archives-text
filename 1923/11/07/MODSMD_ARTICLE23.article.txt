# "A Word to the 'Wise'"

Two weeks ago, the Stanford varsity eleven went
down to defeat before the University of Southern
California team. The defeat itself, in the first con
ference game, was hard to take.
It was even harder to take because of the fact
that the "experts," before the game, had predicted
a twenty-one point victory for Stanford. It was
evident, after the game, that the critics had not
reckoned with the real strength of the southerners.
Stanford supporters will not be duped again.
They will not be led on by false hopes, nor will
they be fooled by gross underestimates of opponents'
strength.
Following the U. S. C. game, the Cardinal eleven
came back strong against the Olympic Club team.
Kerr's team entered the battle as the under dogs,
only three regulars being in the line-up. Still they
won handily by a 40-7 score.
Tonight the Stanford varsity leaves for Portland,
Oregon, where they will meet the University of
Oregon eleven Saturday. Several things will mili
tate against Kerr's team in this game. The long
trip, the game played on a sawdust field, to which
the Stanford players are wholly unaccustomed, and
the loss of several regulars from the line-up, will
be big handicaps.
Even the most optimistic Stanford supporter can
not expect a victory by a big score under such con
ditions. The Oregon team is strong, having played
a 0-0 tie with the fast Idaho eleven. Last Satur
day the Washington Huskies were pushed to the
limit to win from the Lemon Yellow.
A victory by any margin, no matter how small,
will be satisfactory in Saturday's game.
Stanford, this year, as in the past, is pointing at
but one game, and that is the one with California
on November 24. That game will be a battle worth
going many miles to see. The Cardinal eleven has
the best chance in five years to win. Injuries, bad
breaks, or hard luck may make a vast difference in
the way the two rivals line up two weeks hence, but
one thing that can absolutely wreck Stanford's
chances is overconfidence on the part of either
players or rooters or both. â€”D. E. L.

To the gentleman who won a trip to Portland:
Dear Sir:
The Daily Falo Alto wishes to congratulate you
on your potential power as a rooting section. By
the way, have you plenty of overshoes and um
brellas?
