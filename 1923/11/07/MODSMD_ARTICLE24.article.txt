Strange how the appearance of one more
man would cause such a sensation around Stan
ford. Cabbages turned a choice selection of
Cabbage-hounds loose after midnight last night
and discovered: '
(a) Strange knocks and thuds coming from the in
terior of the boathouse up at Lagunita. Subsequently
found to be an earthquake.
(b) Night watchman reported 25 apparently crazy
men walking to Roble bridge and back, accompanied by
unidentified persons.
(c) Memorial Church custodian claims that someone
came in the building, looked about, and went out yes
terday morning. Proved to be Ezra Hay, of Council
Bluffs, lowa.
(d) Report is being circulated to the effect that some
one claimed to have gotten good service at the Campus
bar and grocery store. "This is our man," said the Chief
of Police, upon learning this.
(e) Man found who offered odds favoring California
for November 24. He escaped, but the Cabbage drag-net
is tightening.

If one man did all these things, especially the Roble
bridge feature, he deserves to be appointed to a full
professorship at once. Cabbages is opening its campaign.

Maybe this is the bird. Straight goods,
boys and girls, the following was clipped
from a Northern collegiate newspaper, and
looks bad save for the fact that the man
seems to have been perfectly sane:
CLASSIFIED
LOST, A MAN—Will the gentleman who called a
freshman girl at Waldo on Monday about 5:30 and made
a date for the sophomore dance, kindly call again. He
met her at the commerce picnic.
Now this is either our man or else it ought to be.
Again, either the northern newspaper boys are kidding
us or else we are going to transfer to the university
concerned. Cabbages will furnish full details to anyone
interested. —B. W.

Homer Cayenne, '27, puts his tooth-brush in his pocket
and assumes a necktie, at the same time remarking that
the rest of the student body will go down to the stadium
this afternoon with suit-cases packed.

ODE TO A
f. PfcOWING PERIWINKLE NECKTIE
Twinkle, twinkle, periwinkle
Loving care in every wrinkle,
Flowing down across the shirt
Motivation —covers dirt!
See the little flowers and squares
(Thank the Lord, I'm color-blind,
Otherwise I'd lose my mind).
Still, the chubby knot impairs
My complete appreciation.
I prefer them long and slim
Tightened up with manly vim . . .
And single-purposed concentration.

EMOTING
"He turned with a sneer in his voice."—Story in S. F.
paper.
"You!" she eyebrowed, clutching the woodwork.
"Your face sounds familiar," he grappled, "but I didn't
catch the voice."
"I am lost!" she shrieked with paleness in her cry.
"Who are you?" he quickened. Then, sensing the
agony of her waving hair, he fireworked, "Little Nell!"
Her moan was like an Icicle. ("Yes, it is I—Little
Nell, whom you drove into the storm, telling her never
to darken your towel again!" Her ears quivered with
emotion.
"There, there, little gal," he oiled. "Father will watch
o'er thee."
"But, Fatheh, the ice jam is breaking!" she impacted
with a grasping noise.
"My God! Can Fantastic win the Kentucky Derby?"
he anguished, and there was a great sob in Mb eyes.
(Fifteenth and last episode next Sunday)

DEDICATED TO DISPORTERS OF THE DINK
There once was a freshman named Jas.
Over-fond of drink, ditties, and das.
So when he up and died,
It was freely prophesied,
That he'd be consigned to the flas.
