"ZAZA," Varsity Theater, Palo Alto, now playing.
Gloria Swanson in "Zaza" is like a bull in a china
shop—each tries awfully hard to do something well, and
succeeds in quite wrecking the place. Maybe that isn't
quite fair to Gloria, but how else can you explain her
belligerent tendencies towards all the female members
of the cast who happen to cross her meteoric path? This
would have been a nice picture for Viola Dana, but for
Gloria —well, she has the FORM, all right, but not the
finish. In a word, exciting but superficial.
"SMUDGE," coming. Charles Ray at his worst. This
picture is built on a problem, and we failed to get very
excited about it. The problem being that the smudge
pots of Southern California were simply ruining tho
dresses of the belles of the Orange Belt, while saving
the trees from frost. There are several things thrown in
at the front of the picture, such as a charity bazaar,
which is smudged out of existence; a race over valleys
and through deserts to light a smudge pot under a
far-off lemon tree; and a young boy (Ray himself) who
is an editor who writes what he thinks, and, quite oc
casionally, does think.
Well, after that, some crooked journalists are intro
duced, and they try to ruin the boy's paper, but he
succeeds in fooling them, ha! ha! And he marries the
heroine, who has been waiting around through several
scenes for just such an emergency, and the picture ends
as it began—terribly.
Really, this film is a smudge on Ray's escutcheon.
