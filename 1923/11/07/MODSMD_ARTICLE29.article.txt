### Oz, '23 
William Randolph Hearst and all of
his cohorts have been provided with
more food for patriotic blather. James
Truslow Adams has written another
of those most awful pro-British his-1
tories. "Revolutionary New England,";
(Atlantic Monthly Press) is but a con
tinuation of the work started by Mr.
Adams when he published the "Foun
dations of New England." In both
books the author has forgotten all of
the blurb and hurrah that has ob
scured the truths of our national be
ginning and has sought out the facts
as they are found in original sources.
He has recorded these facts without
regard for our national vanity, which
has been fed and bloated by genera
tions of historical liars.
From "Revolutionary New England"
we learn that all was not holy and just
with our illustrious forebears. They
resorted more than once to mob vio
lence. They found smuggling and il
licit trade very lucrative. They had
no respect for laws that interfered
with the accruing of profits. Even dear
old Samuel Adams is not held invio
late. He is pictured as merely a clever
politician.
The revolution is pictured as a civil
strife of English-speaking people on
both sides of the Atlantic. The poor,
and the frontier with its desire for I
liberty and impatience of restraint,
were aligned against those of property !
and culture. The struggle was between
the conservative capital holding east
and the radical credit needing west.
The prize was political power.
The book should be suppressed, not'
only because its truths may demoral
ize our noble citizenry, but also be
cause it may cause strife and conten
tion in the ranks of our leading boot
leggers. Imagine the confusion and the ,
dryness that would reign if one's fa
vorite hipper should spend more time
tracing his ancestry back to the May
flower than in running the golden
fluid over the border or through the
still. Hearst is right—we need truth
less than liquor.
We seriously hope, however, that
"Revolutionary New England" finds its
place on the library shelves along side
of "The Foundations of New England."

The Bookman's monthly score shows
that:

Hope has not died in the souls of
our spinsters. "Black Oxen," like Abu
somebody or other, leads all the rest
in the field of fiction.
It will not be necessary to give a
benefit for Edward Bok. Royalties from
"The Americanization of Edward Bok"
and the "Man from Maine" should
keep the author out of the bread line
for quite a while. Both books are
found among the first ten in General
Literature.
The American public has discovered
Upton Sinclair's "The Goose Step."
The book found its way into the magic
circle of the first ten.
In 'The Presbyterian Child," Joseph
Hergesheimer tells of his childhood.
He gives us a vivid and charming ac
count of a bygone time valuable
through its record of character seen
and measured by a. young mind which
has since developed into one of Ameri
ca's greatest contemporary writers.
The publishers (Knopfs) offer a very
great inducement to all freshmen. Buy
an autographed copy now at $7.50 net,
keep it until your senior year, sell it j
then for $15, and you'll have enough
to take your favorite queen to the
movies and Sticky's afterward.
Floyd Dell, author of "Moon Calf,";
gives us in 'Janet March" the life-;
story of a girl. The book is a convinc
ing vindication of Young America.
Among books announced, we find
two that should appeal especially to
the campus, The Borzoi Cook Book,
compiled and translated from Russian
sources by Princess Alezandre Garga
rine, and the "Banner of the Bull," by
Rafael Sabitini. The cuisine novelties
to be found in the former should be
potent factors in capturing or killing
fair unsuspecting rushees while
the latter book should find quite a
vogue on the law steps or between
flights at the Engineering corner.

to be found in the former should be

Calm yourself, Gerald, we said review,
not revue. The American Mercury, to

be published by Alfred Knopf and
edited by George Jean Nathan and H.
L. Mencken, will furnish a forum for
anyone who has an intelligent com
ment to make on any of the manifold
phases of art, literature, politics, or
business. It will be an energetic, in
teresting review of life.
William Randolph Hearst and all of
his cohorts have been provided with
more food for patriotic blather. James
Truslow Adams has written another
of those most awful pro-British his-1
tories. "Revolutionary New England,";
(Atlantic Monthly Press) is but a con
tinuation of the work started by Mr.
Adams when he published the "Foun
dations of New England." In both
books the author has forgotten all of
the blurb and hurrah that has ob
scured the truths of our national be
ginning and has sought out the facts
as they are found in original sources.
He has recorded these facts without
regard for our national vanity, which
has been fed and bloated by genera
tions of historical liars.
From "Revolutionary New England"
we learn that all was not holy and just
with our illustrious forebears. They
resorted more than once to mob vio
lence. They found smuggling and il
licit trade very lucrative. They had
no respect for laws that interfered
with the accruing of profits. Even dear
old Samuel Adams is not held invio
late. He is pictured as merely a clever
politician.
The revolution is pictured as a civil
strife of English-speaking people on
both sides of the Atlantic. The poor,
and the frontier with its desire for I
liberty and impatience of restraint,
were aligned against those of property !
and culture. The struggle was between
the conservative capital holding east
and the radical credit needing west.
The prize was political power.
The book should be suppressed, not'
only because its truths may demoral
ize our noble citizenry, but also be
cause it may cause strife and conten
tion in the ranks of our leading boot
leggers. Imagine the confusion and the ,
dryness that would reign if one's fa
vorite hipper should spend more time
tracing his ancestry back to the May
flower than in running the golden
fluid over the border or through the
still. Hearst is right—we need truth
less than liquor.
We seriously hope, however, that
"Revolutionary New England" finds its
place on the library shelves along side
of "The Foundations of New England."

tories. "Revolutionary New England,";
(Atlantic Monthly Press) is but a con
tinuation of the work started by Mr.
Adams when he published the "Foun
dations of New England." In both
books the author has forgotten all of
the blurb and hurrah that has ob
scured the truths of our national be
ginning and has sought out the facts
as they are found in original sources.
He has recorded these facts without
regard for our national vanity, which
has been fed and bloated by genera
tions of historical liars.
From "Revolutionary New England"
we learn that all was not holy and just
with our illustrious forebears. They
resorted more than once to mob vio
lence. They found smuggling and il
licit trade very lucrative. They had
no respect for laws that interfered
with the accruing of profits. Even dear
old Samuel Adams is not held invio
late. He is pictured as merely a clever
politician.
The revolution is pictured as a civil
strife of English-speaking people on
both sides of the Atlantic. The poor,
and the frontier with its desire for I
liberty and impatience of restraint,
were aligned against those of property !
and culture. The struggle was between
the conservative capital holding east
and the radical credit needing west.
The prize was political power.
The book should be suppressed, not'
only because its truths may demoral
ize our noble citizenry, but also be
cause it may cause strife and conten
tion in the ranks of our leading boot
leggers. Imagine the confusion and the ,
dryness that would reign if one's fa
vorite hipper should spend more time
tracing his ancestry back to the May
flower than in running the golden
fluid over the border or through the
still. Hearst is right—we need truth
less than liquor.
We seriously hope, however, that
"Revolutionary New England" finds its
place on the library shelves along side
of "The Foundations of New England."

The Bookman's monthly score shows
that:

Hope has not died in the souls of
our spinsters. "Black Oxen," like Abu
somebody or other, leads all the rest
in the field of fiction.
It will not be necessary to give a
benefit for Edward Bok. Royalties from
"The Americanization of Edward Bok"
and the "Man from Maine" should
keep the author out of the bread line
for quite a while. Both books are
found among the first ten in General
Literature.
The American public has discovered
Upton Sinclair's "The Goose Step."
The book found its way into the magic
circle of the first ten.
In 'The Presbyterian Child," Joseph
Hergesheimer tells of his childhood.
He gives us a vivid and charming ac
count of a bygone time valuable
through its record of character seen
and measured by a. young mind which
has since developed into one of Ameri
ca's greatest contemporary writers.
The publishers (Knopfs) offer a very
great inducement to all freshmen. Buy
an autographed copy now at $7.50 net,
keep it until your senior year, sell it j
then for $15, and you'll have enough
to take your favorite queen to the
movies and Sticky's afterward.
Floyd Dell, author of "Moon Calf,";
gives us in 'Janet March" the life-;
story of a girl. The book is a convinc
ing vindication of Young America.
Among books announced, we find
two that should appeal especially to
the campus, The Borzoi Cook Book,
compiled and translated from Russian
sources by Princess Alezandre Garga
rine, and the "Banner of the Bull," by
Rafael Sabitini. The cuisine novelties
to be found in the former should be
potent factors in capturing or killing
fair unsuspecting rushees while
the latter book should find quite a
vogue on the law steps or between
flights at the Engineering corner.

edited by George Jean Nathan and H.

anyone who has an intelligent com

phases of art, literature, politics, or
