# Under the Sun

C. N. H.
Once upon a time the
citizens of a certain
city became so proud
of their little gem
of a municipality
that they erected an
enormous sign where the
highway entered the
town, and proclaimed
thereon that for climate,
civic improvement,
business opportunities,
ad infinitum . . . this
particular spot was
unrivalled anywhere.
By night the words were
blazoned electrically.
By day the boast looked
the sun brazenly in the
eye. Then along came
a traveler with the
talcum of the road upon
his coat, who stood
before the sign and asked
a bystander what it said.
He could not read. But
there was no answer. The
bystander was thinking
of how silly signs were
when they could not be
read.
