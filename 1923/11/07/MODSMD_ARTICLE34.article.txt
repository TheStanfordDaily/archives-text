###

partment, entered Stanford as a spe-'
cial student in the Freshman Class of I

ing until he entered Stanford.

worked in factories during the day

Stanford. His work came to the notice
of the father of a Stanford man who
persuaded Hulme to come to Stanford
to study. Hulme left his newspaper
job and arrived on the campus with'
$35 in his pocket.
While in college he earned all of his
expenses by waiting on table and do
ing odd jobs. He was editor of the

editor of the Sequoia, then a weekly
magazine. At that time Will Irwin,
Wallace Irwin, Charles Field, Bristol
Adams, and Sarah Comstock were con
tributing stories. The paper was quot
ed in many other professional publica
tions.

in various hotels in the redwoods. He
bought high school books and studied
different subjects in his idle moments,
passing the examinations when he re
turned to the campus. He graduated
with the class of 1897.
