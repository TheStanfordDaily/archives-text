# ACTION TO RESCIND GERMAN "S" TAKEN BY EXECUTIVE BODY
## Reversal of Plan Is Brought About by Opinions of Athletic Coaches 
### 
The German "S" award which was
to be given to second squad football
men engaging in intercollegiate sec
ond-team competition was rescinded
by the Executive committee last night.
This reversal of this plan of the com
mittee came as the result of a report
by the Physical Education department
stating that a majority of the coaches
felt the award to be unfair. Under the
plan previously adopted second squad
players in football would get a Ger
man "S." At the same time there
would be some members of the first
string that would receive no award for
their efforts. Also the varsity awards
would be cheapened, since the German ]
"S" would have to be awarded for
second team competition in all other
major sports and in minor sports.
The action of the Executive commit
tee was taken before a report was ob
tained from the Coast Conference, re
garding the one-year eligibility rule in
its application to second team players
desiring to enter varsity competition.
