# 1926 PLAY TRYOUTS WILL BEGIN TONIGHT
## 
### 
Preliminary tryouts for the Sopho
more Play will be held tonight in the
Assembly hall from 7 o'clock to 10
o'clock. Only in a few exceptional
cases will first tryouts be held tomor
row afternoon, according to Delmer
Daves, chairman of the play commit
tee. Second tryouts will be held in
the afternoon and final tryouts tomor
row night so that rehearsals can com
mence immediately.
A large range of characters is pro
vided in the play selected by the
class. Some thirty parts in all are to
be filled. There are six principle male
roles ranging from the heavy villain
to the breezy youth. The female parts
range from a worldly-wise adventuress
and breaker-of-hearts to the pure and
unsullied maid that everyone loves.
Judging from the large and talented
turnout that he had for "Androcles
and the Lion" Coach Davis expects to
be able to pick an excellent cast from
among the sophomores. All the second
year men and women who turned out
for the Sword and Sandals production
were reserved for this, their own play,
wherever possible, he says. They are
especially urged to come out as their
names are on record in Davis' files.
According to tradition as much of
the production as possible will be
handled by the class. Only sophomores
are eligible for the cast. Stage work
will be handled by them under the
direction of the stage manager, and
the publicity will be broadcasted by
a second-year press agent. The direc
tor, dramatic manager, and stage
manager seem to be the only ones
outside the claSs who will be at all
concerned with the piece.
