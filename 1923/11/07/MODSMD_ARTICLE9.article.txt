# Police Searching for Student Missing From Campus Since Saturday
## 
### 
George K. Mauser of Hollywood, 18-
year-old freshman, who has been miss
ing from the campus since Saturday
afternoon, is believed by San Fran
cisco police to be wandering in the
city suffering from amnesia. The
freshman engaged in a boxing bout
in the gym Friday afternoon where he
suffered a severe blow on the head.
He complained about his head Friday
night during the performance of "An
drocles and the Lion," in which he
had a part.
He was last seen in San Francisco
at the home of his aunt, Mrs. Samuel
H. Boardman, on Saturday. He left
there with a dress suit which he in
tended to wear to a dance. When he
failed to reappear, police were noti
fied and the boy's father, George B.
Mauser, wealthy Los Angeles business
man, rushed to San Francisco to take
charge of the hunt.
No trace of the boy has yet been
found. Detectives and police are work
ing on the theory that Mauser is wan
dering in an unconscious state In the
city. The aunt who saw him last failed
to notice anything unusual in his ac
tions which would result from am
nesia.
Dean George B. Culver thinks that
the boy has gone East.
"I believe that Mauser has gone
east, possibly to Pennsylvania, where
he once lived," said the dean. "Practi
cally all of his clothes have been re
moved and I don't think he is wander
ing about unconscious."
