# CHECKS GIVE POLICE ONLY CLUE IN HUNT FOR GEORGE MAUSER
## 
### 
George K. Mauser, Stanford freshman
who has been missing from the campus
since Saturday afternoon, has not yet
been located by police and with the ex
ception of an envelope two
checks postmarked "Inyo, California," no
further trace has been found of the boy.
Albert Boardmann, roommate of Mauser,
received the letter yesterday and turned
it over to police and George B. Mauser,
father of the missing boy, who was on
the campus yesterday conducting the
search for his son. Mr. Mauser left for
the south as soon as the letter was re
ceived.
The contents gave no clue as to the
condition of the boy. It contained one
check made out to Albert Boardman for
$5. The other was made out to Mauser
by his roommate for a fountain pen sold
to him by Mauser for $4.50, and was en
dorsed by Mauser.
At least two theories arc being fol
lowed by the p s olice. One is that Mauser
is wandering about suffering from am
nesia. This condition is thought to have
resulted from a boxing bout Friday in
which Mauser received a severe blow on
the head.
t Another theory of police is that the
boy is perfectly normal, has a definite
destination in mind, and is concealing
himself for a purpose. He is theatrical

in nature, according to his friends, but is
sensible enough not to cause the worry of
his parents needlessly.
Still another theory is that the boy has
gone south with the intention of going
east to Pennsylvania where he formerly
lived. Inyo is on the El Paso branch of
the Southern Pacific and is southeast of
Los Angeles where Mauser lives. Police
are working on all the clues which have
presented themselves and the boy's father

has gone to Los Angeles to aid the
search in the southern part of the state.
