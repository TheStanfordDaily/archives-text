# VARSITY IN GOOD CONDITION TO MEET OREGON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's 1923 varsity left last
night to meet the University of Ore
gon football team with the assurance
of 2000 Cardinal rooters ringing in
their ears—the first Stanford team
which has left to meet a northern op
ponent with the odds in its favor. The
40-to-7 victory over the Olympic Club
has placed Stanford one step further
up the football ladder, and a victory
over the Oregon eleven will aid in
placing it at the top.
Olympic Club players have noticed
and are commenting on the strength
of the Cards. Bob Evans, "Winged O"
football coach, speaks of Stanford as
having "the punch that California once
had, and which the latter now lacks"
—which is pretty reasonable, coming
as it does from a man who had cen
tered his best efforts on making a
good showing against Stanford.
Evans went on to say, "Stanford
deserved to win from us Saturday. We
didn't let up; we were simply beaten
bv a better team." '

| Although the U. S. C. victory came
I as a surprise and disappointment, it
j is perhaps the best thing that could
: have happened, if the fight and punch
I of the Stanford team was due to the
j sting of the week before. Certainly it
awoke something which has lain dor
mant all season.
All that can be said for comparative
scores is that they are interesting, if
not reliable. The best comparison, and
in many ways one of the worst, will
be the California-U. S. C. game next
Saturday. It will be a one-sided com
parison if Stanford is brought to figure
in it, because it is now plain that
the score in the Stanford-Trojan game
might have been different if—alway3
] the inevitable "if."
Reports from the North say that
the Oregon varsity is working hard in
| preparation for the game with the
j Cards. Secret practice lias been held
all week, and the Oregon coaches are
1 preparing in every way possible for a
! northern victory.
