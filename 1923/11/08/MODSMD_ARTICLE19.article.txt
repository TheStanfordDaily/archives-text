# DEAN CULVER GOES NORTH WITH TEAM
## 
### 
Dean Culver journeyed north with the
team on a joint mission, as a speaker and
rooter.
Instead of stopping in Portland with
the team he continues his way on up to
Seattle. Friday night, at a banquet in the
Hotel Gowan he is going to tell the Stan
ford alumni all about the University,
what she is doing and what she expects
to do. After the banquet, the Dean again
embarks for Portland, arriving Saturday
in time for the game.
