# Sponsor System Is Protested By Sophomores
## 
### 
Senior sponsors have been asked more
rigorously to enforce freshman discipline
or place the matter in the hands of the
sophomores by a petition passed at a
meeting of the sophomore class yester
day.
The petition, which was passed only
after much heated debate, will be signed
and sent to President Wilbur and Dean
Culver, who will take action upon it if
they see fit.
Originators of the petition stated that
they were not opposed to the idea of the
senior sponsor system but objected to the
lack of frosh "discipline" under the pres
ent system.
In full, the petition reads as follows:
"We, the undersigned, do hereby wish to
register our disapproval of the sponsor
system as it is being enforced now in
regard to freshman discipline. We rec
ommend that the seniors take it upon
themselves to see that freshmen know
their places and that they live up to all
traditions. If the seniors are unwilling to
do this, we desire that freshman disci
pline be placed in the hands of the sopho
mores."
Freshmen to Regulate Own Conduct
In a speech advocating further trial of
the sponsor system, Howell Smith said
that the purpose of putting the freshmen
in one dormitory was to let them organ
ize and have their own government.
A house committee of twelve fresh
men has been chosen whose purpose it
i is to inform their classmen of Stanford
j traditions, to win their support and, if
| necessary, to mete out punishment to
i breakers of Stanford traditions and rules.
"If you will turn in to the sponsors
and the freshman disciplinary body names
lof those violating the rules, discipline
will be meted out. The freshmen are
anxious and willing to take disciplinary
measures."
I The concensus of opinion among those
opposing the passage of the petition was
i that the only defect in the sponsor sys
tem is the fact that freshmen are not as
yet informed of all Stanford traditions
and that they are not encouraged to carry
lout their'own disciplinary measures.
