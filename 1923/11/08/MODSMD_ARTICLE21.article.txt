# COACH HUNT CHOOSES LINE-UP FOR CARD-BRUIN FROSH GAME
## Either Ryan or Baldwin Will Call Signals; Herth, Trombetto and Hyland Are Other Backs 
### 
This afternoon will mark the last day of hard practice for the Stanford
tabes. Tomorrow the coaching staff will smooth off the rough edges, and
Saturday afternoon the players will meet the California Cubs in the stadium
to make one of the hardest fights ever seen between Stanford-California
freshmen,
A tentative line-up announced last night by Coach Hunt gives Shipkey and
Adams first choice at ends. Shipkey is a 170-pound lad hailing from Fullerton.
He is a brother of Harry Shipkey, varsity linesman, and has inherited his
brother's ability. Adams is from Sacramento and tops the scales at 155
pounds, being the lightest man on the line. Greisser, Ogden, and Lundquist

have been showing up well and may
all gent in the game.
Swan Experienced
Captain Fred Swan will start at left
tackle. He is a whole line in himself
when he gets going, and with his 185
pounds, is bound to cause the Bears
some worry. Swan had high school ex
perience at Berkeley and held down a
regular position on the Olympic Club
team which defeated the Stanford var
sity last year.
Either Poulson or Raffetto will start
at the other tackle position. Both men
are strong, but have not heen playing
regularly, due to the fact that Stock
ham, who recently left school, was the
regular tackle. Toffelmier and Evans
are other tackles who may be given an
opportunity to show their stuff.
Mahan and Post are the choices for
guards, Scott, Anderson, Chappellet,
and Macabee have been showing up
well in practice and will be held in
readiness Saturday.
Price and Natcher are still fighting
it out for center. Hunt is having a hard
time to make a selection, due to the
fact that both men are of about equal
ability. Natcher has a little the edge
due to his superior passing and ten
pounds more beef, and will probably
be on the field at the kick-off.
Herth Is Fullback
Herth looks to be the likely candi
date for fullback. He tops the scales
at 184 pounds, is a good tackier, and
can buck the line. He played an end
position early in the season, but was
given an opportunity at fullback in
the game against San Luis Obispo last
Saturday. His showing in that game
was sufficiently good to warrant his
being named as fullback in the "Little
Big Game."
Baldwin and Ryan are the contend
ers for halfbacks. Both men weigh the
same and should see service Saturday.
Smythe, a lad from Cleveland, Ohio,
is also working oub at quarter in the
scrimmages.
The halves will be selected from
Hyland, Trombetto, Doerr, Phillips,
and Garthwaite. The first two are the
likely ones to start. Trombetto is the
heaviest of the quintette, weighing 162
pounds. He can stand lots of heavy
work without tiring. Hyland will do
the kicking for the team. He is the
fastest man in the backfield, and
should be able to tear off some good
gains.

pounds more beef, and will probably
be on the field at the kick-off.
Herth Is Fullback
Herth looks to be the likely candi
date for fullback. He tops the scales
at 184 pounds, is a good tackier, and
can buck the line. He played an end
position early in the season, but was
given an opportunity at fullback in
the game against San Luis Obispo last
Saturday. His showing in that game
was sufficiently good to warrant his
being named as fullback in the "Little
Big Game."
Baldwin and Ryan are the contend
ers for halfbacks. Both men weigh the
same and should see service Saturday.
Smythe, a lad from Cleveland, Ohio,
is also working oub at quarter in the
scrimmages.
The halves will be selected from
Hyland, Trombetto, Doerr, Phillips,
and Garthwaite. The first two are the
likely ones to start. Trombetto is the
heaviest of the quintette, weighing 162
pounds. He can stand lots of heavy
work without tiring. Hyland will do
the kicking for the team. He is the
fastest man in the backfield, and
should be able to tear off some good
gains.
This afternoon will mark the last day of hard practice for the Stanford
tabes. Tomorrow the coaching staff will smooth off the rough edges, and
Saturday afternoon the players will meet the California Cubs in the stadium
to make one of the hardest fights ever seen between Stanford-California
freshmen,
A tentative line-up announced last night by Coach Hunt gives Shipkey and
Adams first choice at ends. Shipkey is a 170-pound lad hailing from Fullerton.
He is a brother of Harry Shipkey, varsity linesman, and has inherited his
brother's ability. Adams is from Sacramento and tops the scales at 155
pounds, being the lightest man on the line. Greisser, Ogden, and Lundquist

have been showing up well and may
all gent in the game.
Swan Experienced
Captain Fred Swan will start at left
tackle. He is a whole line in himself
when he gets going, and with his 185
pounds, is bound to cause the Bears
some worry. Swan had high school ex
perience at Berkeley and held down a
regular position on the Olympic Club
team which defeated the Stanford var
sity last year.
Either Poulson or Raffetto will start
at the other tackle position. Both men
are strong, but have not heen playing
regularly, due to the fact that Stock
ham, who recently left school, was the
regular tackle. Toffelmier and Evans
are other tackles who may be given an
opportunity to show their stuff.
Mahan and Post are the choices for
guards, Scott, Anderson, Chappellet,
and Macabee have been showing up
well in practice and will be held in
readiness Saturday.
Price and Natcher are still fighting
it out for center. Hunt is having a hard
time to make a selection, due to the
fact that both men are of about equal
ability. Natcher has a little the edge
due to his superior passing and ten
pounds more beef, and will probably
be on the field at the kick-off.
