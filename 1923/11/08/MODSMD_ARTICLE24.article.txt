Listen to this:
"We, the undersigned, do hereby wish to register
our disapproval of the sponsor system as it is being
enforced in regard to freshman discipline. We rec
ommend that the seniors take it upon themselves to
see that the freshmen know their places and that
they live up to all traditions. If the seniors are un

Except that the Daily Palo Alto knows the sopho
more class pretty well, and believes that it is rather
an unusual class due to the opportunity given it
last year to develop with less suppression than any
previous freshman class, the Daily might be led to
believe that the above surprising document repre
sents the sober thought of a majority of the class
of '26.
It is rather unfortunate that class meetings as
they are invariably run by sophomores of all genera
tions give so good an opportunity for a stampede
vote. It is well remembered by the present senior
class how many measures rode through on a high
horse two years ago.
It is particularly unfortunate that those who do
not know the present sophomore class should be
given such a poor impression of them as the petition
above would warrant. Students who have worked
with the present second-year men know that they
are as a rule a sane, intelligent bunch of fellows,
working for the best interests of the university with
an eye to future good and disregard of present in
conveniences.
The Daily Palo Alto would like to be the first to
defend the sophomores against those who are bound
to remark on the inappropriateness of people who
have been in the University one year disapproving
of the actions of those who have been here three
years. The sentence in which these same people
demand that their superiors teach the freshmen to
know their places certainly does not represent the
progressive and unassuming attitude which the class
of '26 has taken so far. Critics who will wonder just
what constitutes the proper place of a sophomore
are asked to remember their own shortcomings and
not judge too hastily.
