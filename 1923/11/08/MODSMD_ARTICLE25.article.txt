Rill Brogan, who hashes in Palo Alto and helps
run a laundry agency, overheard a member of an
undergraduate activity committee ask a man to help
with some work of benefit to the University.
"We—e—ll," drawled the student, "I'm pretty
busy. What do I get out of it?"
That was a little too much for Bill. He butted in
on the group.
"Say, you!" said Bill, "Haven't you enough spirit
to go out and help Stanford without any strings at
tached? Aren't you proud to be given the oppor
tunity for unselfish aid? I should think the fact
that you have helped to make this glorious place a
little better would be more than enough reward.
How have you been able to live around here so long
without wanting to do something to repay Stanford
for all she is doing for you?"
"Huh !" was the reply. "If you're so anxious, why
don't you do it yourself?"
Bill jumped at the chance.

sheepishly to a member of the Rally committee, and
asked to be given some work.
