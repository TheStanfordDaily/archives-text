MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB .... she was lucky,
at that.
Dear Cabbage Readers:
Please answer uiy question: Why are Stanford men
so much like sheep? One youth gives a girl a rush and
all the rest of 'em give her a rush. Their favorite game
seems to be "Follow-the-Leader" in respect to campus
queening. On this campus there are about sixty co-eds
who step to every formal, informal, Cotillion, Prom, and
Ball in these parts, to say nothing of innumerable ex
cursions to the big city. More power to them. BUT
how about the other four hundred and forty of us? If
we manage to step out once a week, we think we are
doing well. Once in a while one of us has a spectacular
flight and joins the sixty star performers. But lots of
us haven't the wherewith to make a comet's flight, no
one accords us a rush and . . . ergo . . . the men con
tinue to take out the sixty.
It's up to Stanford men to realize the truth of this
situation and stop wailing about the lack of Stanford
women. There are Five Hundred of us and only four
hundred and sixty get out at all. Fur coats and ex
pensive frocks are not particularly esential to making
one's escort have a good time, or to amusing conversa
tion. Why DO the men follow each other so stupidly?
Why are they so sheep-like? —Patty Gray.

The Daily Californian announces that the faculty at
U. C. have taken no steps to ban "drawing contests"
whereby students may be given a chance to take a free
trip with the football team.
Which is quite all right, as long as they are run as
squarely as the one Thursday was (loud cheers from the
two who went; silence 011 the part of everyone else).
The idea should not stop there, though. The following
"drawing contests" might be useful on the campus:
Sell 10,000 chances at 10c each. Winner of lucky
number is given leave of absence for rest of quarter.
Sell three chances at $100 each. Holder of winning
number gets three cuts in a row if a law major; other
wise, ten cuts.
Sell million chances at lc each. If holder of winning
number will be present at Tuesday evening lecture
when drawing is made, he shall be awarded medal for
bravery.
