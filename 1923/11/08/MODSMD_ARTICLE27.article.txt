ON BEING COLLEGIATE
The influence of college environment seems to leave
nothing untouched; it determines the cut of a student's
clothes, the way he parts his hair, the relative im
portance he attaches to football, fraternity social events,
the invasion of the Ruhr, and the very manner of his
speech.
To be "collegiate" seems to be the sum of ambition
for a certain type of college man. If it is necessary to
wear oxford shoes embellished with Scotch plaid woolen
hose through the winter snows to be really "collegiate,"
oxford shoes and Scotch plaid woolen hose he will wear.
The practice of mutilating a new felt hat into a shape
less head-piece, familiarly known as "ragging the hat,"
is merely the result of an attempt to be "collegiate."
And to the student's "collegiate" mind, the invasion of
the Haskell Indians is of far more significance than
presidential prospects for 1924. Upon picking up a news
paper, he invariably passes by current political or eco
nomic topics and turns at once to the sport page to get
the latest "dope" on the conference "gridiron warriors."
After the sport page, the comic section takes up his
attention; then, perhaps, University items on the society
page.
His speech matches his clothes —very "collegiate."
He "cuts" a class to sit in on a "rubber" of bridge. He
"sports" a pipe for it is "quite the dog." On Saturday
night he "throws" a party which boasts of several
"keen broads" —one of them a "darb." Perhaps just
prior to final "exams" he starts "hitting the books."
And at the end of four years, if he isn't first "given the
gate," he "grabs" a degree.
The "collegiate" collegian is a descendent of the
"rah! rah! boy" of the preceding generation. He is a
picturesque college type, but fortunately he is outnum
bered by his more sane and serious-minded fellows. —
