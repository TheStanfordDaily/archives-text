The weekly meeting
of the Emancipated
Women's League was in
full swing. One young
matron was calling
upon her sisters to
free themselves from
dependence upon the
male. Another deplored
the spectacle of
woman's initiative
crushed under the
heel of masculine
domination. The din
was terrific.
"Aye!" shrilled all
present, at the vote
for a campaign to
make females forever
independent of men.
"And now," said the
practical chairman of
the Committee on
Finance, after the
meeting was over,
"how are we to raise
the money for our
glorious cause?"
"Don't worry," one of
them whispered, "I'll
Bee to it that my
husband gives us a
check to cover expenses."
