# Roughs Appreciated
## 
### 
"Roughs." I had never thought much
o£ 'em until the other day. A girl
friend was visiting me, and went to a
campus dance with me. Seeing all of
the fellows hanging from the windows
of the clubhouse, and pouring onto the
stage, she turned to me and said:
"Who are they?"
I said, "Roughs."
This answer amazed her, and she
replied: "Roughs? What do you mean?
Are they Palo Alto fellows that can't
come?"
I explained that they were campus
men who did not desire to come. She
could not get over the fact that they
came to dances that way, and asked
me many questions the next morning.
One point struck me forcibly. When
my friend had first mentioned the
roughs, I was afraid she would not
understand them and would think
poorly of the custom which allows
them such liberties. But she did noth
ing of the kind. She thought the Idea

splendid, and wished that her college
could have the same custom.
After all, we women do appreciate
the roughs. Not that we want our
dresses and frocks admired, for we
want nothing of the sort, except from
our escorts. But, knowing that they
are there, and getting so accustomed
to seeing them hanging from the win
dows and roaring approval or disap
proval, makes us feel the spirit of
brotherhood and democracy back of
the whole thing.
Personally, I believe this talk about
the golf trousers supplanting the cords
is all nonsense. I would hate to see
such a thing happen. We have the cord
tradition and should not change it,
j just because some of the Eastern uni
versity students have returned to their
childhood and are wearing knee-length
trousers. Give us the rough, and do
not try to change his attire. He is a
i Stanford man, and we do not want
j him anything else. —G. A. R.
