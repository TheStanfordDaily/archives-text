# Women and "Hello"
## 
### 
Why not start the custom of having
| the women say "hello" to everyone
they meet on the campus, including
the men? I, for one, believe this would
start an excellent tradition, and would
give the women of the University a
chance to exhibit their loyalty.
Even as I write this, I can see the
hands of some of my more conserva
tive sisters raised in unfeigned horror.
"Why," they say, "it wouldn't be pro
per." Well, what of it? There is no
harm done, and possibly a great deal
of good can come from it. When you
are feeling down in the mouth as you
make your way to an 8 o'clock, a smile
j and a pleasant word will soon set you
right with the world again.
