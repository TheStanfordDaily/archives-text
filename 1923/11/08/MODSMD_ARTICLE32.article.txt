With fifty or sixty men out for track
every afternoon, Coach Templeton has
promises of a good squad. Although
this season's outfit will be handicapped
by the graduation of several '23 stars,
good men are showing up to take their
places. Hal Boles should have a good
year in the hurdles, and should press
Leistner closely. Bill Storie, a trans
fer from San Jose, has a big record
as a 440-yard man, and should look
good in a Cardinal suit next spring.
* * *
Entries for the annual cross-country
race which, will be run as a prelimi
nary to the varsity and Idaho football
game, are slowly coming in. Indica
tions are that a large field of starters
will face the tape.

"Tex" Middleton stuck his head into
the candle flame of fame last Satur
day and demanded to know why he
wasn't as good an end as the next
fellow. Popular opinion gives hearty
support to "Tex's" claim.

Fred Ludeke, veteran of more than
one Stanford football battle, aided ma
terially in uaking the Cardinal de
fense look like a stone wall. Loomis,
who replaced Ludeke, looked like a
competent fighter.

With the University of California
games slated for next Monday, both
varsity and freshman soccer elevens
are putting in a hard week's practice.
Since the games are played at Berke
ley, Maloney must have his men in
top-notch condition to offset the dis
advantage of playing on a strange
field. With a record of 23 wins in 28
encounters during the past fifteen
years, the Card varsity has adopted
the do-or'die attitude that should help
materially to win the game.

Murray Cuddeback was the big sen
sation of the Olympic Club contest.
Those who were dissatisfied with see
ing Cuddeback gracing the bench dur
ing the U. S. C. fracas had the pleas
ure of watching the star*of last year's
varsity prove that he still knows
something of football.

"Solly" Solomon made most of his
gains through the fake forward pass
buck. It is a difficult play, and only i

a fast backfleld man can pull the trick
with success. It was Solomon's speed
more than his weight that drove him
through the line for gains.

There is no quarterback on the
i squad who can best "Scotchy" Camp
bell when it comes to returning punts,
i Campbell naturally squirms, dodges,
ty yards on almost every kick. Seldom
and straight-arms his returns for twen
has the Card safety called for a free
catch, which speaks well for the Stan
ford defense, as well as for Campbell.

There is nothing accidental about a
team, which, practically composed of
substitutes in the last half, can roll
up a pair of touchdowns.
With fifty or sixty men out for track
every afternoon, Coach Templeton has
promises of a good squad. Although
this season's outfit will be handicapped
by the graduation of several '23 stars,
good men are showing up to take their
places. Hal Boles should have a good
year in the hurdles, and should press
Leistner closely. Bill Storie, a trans
fer from San Jose, has a big record
as a 440-yard man, and should look
good in a Cardinal suit next spring.

With the University of California
games slated for next Monday, both
varsity and freshman soccer elevens
are putting in a hard week's practice.
Since the games are played at Berke
ley, Maloney must have his men in
top-notch condition to offset the dis
advantage of playing on a strange
field. With a record of 23 wins in 28
encounters during the past fifteen
years, the Card varsity has adopted
the do-or'die attitude that should help
materially to win the game.

Murray Cuddeback was the big sen

Those who were dissatisfied with see

varsity prove that he still knows
something of football.

"Solly" Solomon made most of his
gains through the fake forward pass
buck. It is a difficult play, and only i

a fast backfleld man can pull the trick
with success. It was Solomon's speed
more than his weight that drove him
through the line for gains.
