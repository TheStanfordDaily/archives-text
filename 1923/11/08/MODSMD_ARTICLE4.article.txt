# Ram's Head Defeats Sigma Delta Chi Squad 6-0; Game Is Set-Up
## 
### Upson Downs 
(Special Staff Correspondent)
Overwhelming their adversaries by
a brilliant display of football skill, the
varsity squad of Ram's Head society
trampled on the team of Sigma Delta
Chi journalists by a 6-to-0 score in an
eight-minute game played in the sta
dium yesterday afternoon.
The size of the score is hardly an
indication of the superiority of the
Ram's Head team. The actors sur
passed the scribes in every depart
ment of the game, except on offense
and defense. The Ram's Head score
was made as the result of straight
football, end runs by Sproull and
Trago, and a completed pass to Carey
taking the ball over the line. The
touchdown made by Sproull was not
allowed by the referee, but that is a
minor matter.
Referee Sees It
Ram's Head started its triumphant
march early in the game, when Taylor
intercepted a pass and ran forty yards
for what would have been a touch
down if the referee could have seen it
that way. He called a penalty on tbe
play, however.
Sproull and Trago were the ground
gainers for the Ram's Head squad,
with Mannoccir a pillar of strength in
the center of the line. Liebendorfer at
center was one of Sigma Delta Chi's

to be sent to Portland as the guests
of the University for Saturday's game.
The rally later adjourned to the Palo
Alto depot, where the crowd fairly ran
wild In their enthusiasm as the team
started on their long trip.
Bayley Has Nosebleed
The alleged football game, staged
before a large and enthusiastic audi
ence, was the fiercest ever played by
thq rival squads. Both went into the
game to crush the other, and blood
ran deep over the turf and lapped
against the foot of the bleachers be
fore the carnage was done.
Sigma Delta Chi was superior to
Ram's Head in every department of
the game except on offense and de
fense. Ely and Pollard starred for the
scribes, while Sproull, Trago, and
Carey were Ram's Head's best play
ers. The actors' line was ragged, and
many penalties were called.
The journalists took the offensive
in the first four minutes of play, while
Ram's Head did its stuff during the
other half. On Sproull's kick-off, some
unidentified journalist ran the ball
back two or seventeen yards. The
second play was the old "dead-man"
trick pass, Wright being the dead man
and Charles the passee. It was a won
derful play, Charles dashing along the j
sidelines for numerous yardage. The j
pass was not completed.
Ely Has a Fit
Line bucks by Pollard and a mag-!
nificent end run by Ely, gave Sigma
Delta Chi two first downs. The scribes
lost the ball on an intercepted pass.
The half ended.
In the second period, Sproull carried
the ball over the line in a wide end !
run; but the linesman said it wasn't !
fair. Sigma Delta Chi let Ram's Head
kick just for fun, but Sproull failed to
find the cross bar. Pretty soon the
game ended. So that's that.
McHose Makes Yardage
"Nip" McHose and Barney Thole
Wright deserve special mention for
