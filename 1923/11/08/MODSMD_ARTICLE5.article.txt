# DR. JORDAN WILL TELL 'FISH STORY' TONIGHT
## 
### 
How does it feel to be a salmon?
i
By all rights, the answer to such a
question should be given on Friday, the
universal fish day, but Dr. Jordan will
explain the feeling in a discussion on
"How it feels to be a salmon" at his
home tonight at 7 :30.
Dr. Jordan, as a national fisli expert,
is well qualified to talk on this subject.
He was the United States commissioner
in charge of salmon investigation and in
ternational commissioner of fisheries
1908 to 1910.
On his recent trip to Japan Dr. Jordan
gathered many fish fossils and added
them to his large collection on his re
turn to Stanford last January.
Among the books which Dr. Jordan
has written on this subject are "Fishes
of North and Middle America," "A Guide
to the Study of Fishes," "Fossil Fishes of
Southern California" and "Genera of
Fishes," which was written in 1920.
