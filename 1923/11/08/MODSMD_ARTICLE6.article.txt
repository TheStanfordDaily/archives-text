# CARD-BEAR RESERVE CONTEST POSTPONED
## 
### 
Because members of the Blue and Gold
reserve eleven were desirious of seeing
the contest between the California and
U. S. C. varsities at Los Angeles, next
Saturday, the contest with the Stanford
Grays has been postponed until next
Thursday. The game, according to Mike
Reed, will probably be played at 4 p. m.
in the stadium on that date.
Postponement will no doubt give
'Nick" Kirwan, who lias gone north with
the varsity, an opportunity to play Thurs
day. Other members of the third varsity
are now eligible for the Gray squad.
