# CARD VARSITY CLASHES WITH OREGON TOMORROW IN NORTH
## Substitutes Form Main Defense of Rejuvenated Stanford Eleven; Injuries Weaken Oregon 
### David Meiklejohn 
Coach "Shy" Huntington, of the Oregon varsity, will again attempt to over
come a yearly repeated "jinx" tomorrow afternoon when his Webfoot eleven
meets Stanford at Portland.
Oregon has never been able to beat a Stanford eleven. Even when the
Cards were doomed to defeat, they always managed to squeeze ahead with a
victory. In 1920, when Big Bill Steers was with the Webfooters, and the
Cardinal team was reputed to have nothing whatever, Stanford recovered a
fumble near the goal line, and bucked the ball'over for a touchdown. "Dink"
Templeton added three extra points with a drop kick, and Stanford won 10-0.
Oregon, therefore, is after revenge. The only hindrance seems to be the fact
that Stanford has the strongest team in years, and unless Oregon comes up
with a spurt, the jinx is likely to continue at least for another season.
Card Substitutes Are Dependable
Stanford meets Oregon with twenty-two men of first team strength and
calibre. The aggressiveness and dependability of the substitutes shown in
the Olympic game proved that the Cards have not a team which can be
rightfully termed a "first" varsity. The substitutes are the mainstay of the
squad, and in the backfield this strength is most evident. Coach Kerr can
call on three quarterbacks: Mitchell, Campbell, and Kirwan; he has the choice
of three fullbacks: Nevers, Solomon, and Hey; and five halfbacks of varying
ability: Woodward, Cuddeback, Cleaveland, Dennis, and Wheat.
The shift of Campbell to half, and Howard Mitchell to a steady position at
quarter, did not materialize in the Olympic game. It is not likely that it
ever will materialize now that the backfield is going great-guns. Cuddeback

is a mainstay; his work during the<$
Olympic fracas has given him a right-1
ful claim to a steady berth.
Nevers to Do Punting
Nevers will likely do the kicking
against Oregon, unless Kerr decides i
to use Cuddeback on account o£,. the 1
latter's sped in getting the punts away.j
But Ernie is a valuable line plunger,
and Kerr cannot afford to do long j
without his services. Solomon has the
speed, but his weight handicaps him '
when the extra drive to put over a
touchdown or make yardage is needed. '
The backfield men on the Lemon-
Yellow squad, according to reports
from Eugene, are in bad physical '
shape. Terjesen, left half, has a
wrenched knee, but he will in allj
probability play tomorrow. Latham,
fullback, is still suffering from a bad
ankle received in the Washington
State game, and Karl Vonder Ahe,
veteran tackle, has a slight attack of
tonsilitis, which will probably prevent
him from participating. Chapman,
quarterback and mainstay of the team,
will not play because of the recent
death of his mother.
Kicking Has Improved
Blocked punts ought not to trouble
the Stanford style of play tomorrow.
Kerr has changed the kick formation;
has drilled the team constantly all
week in that particular defense; and
has trained his kickers in getting
punts off faster and more accurately.
Baker will continue to use the end
over-end pass to which so many critics
mistakenly objected.
Oregon has not gone through the
season without a defeat. Last Satur
day, the Washington State eleven out
played and beat the Webfooters 13-7.
A week before, Idaho held them to a
0-0 tie.
The Stanford rooting section will be
composed of "Swede" Leistner, and
"Red" Richardson, in addition to the
many Cardinal alumni who "live in
Portland. Stanford graduates are plan
ning a big celebration the evening be
fore the game, which includes a ban
quet for the varsity, and a parade
through the main streets of Portland
following the dinner.

when the extra drive to put over a
touchdown or make yardage is needed. '
The backfield men on the Lemon-
Yellow squad, according to reports
from Eugene, are in bad physical '
shape. Terjesen, left half, has a
wrenched knee, but he will in allj
probability play tomorrow. Latham,
fullback, is still suffering from a bad
ankle received in the Washington
State game, and Karl Vonder Ahe,
veteran tackle, has a slight attack of
tonsilitis, which will probably prevent
him from participating. Chapman,
quarterback and mainstay of the team,
will not play because of the recent
death of his mother.
Kicking Has Improved
Blocked punts ought not to trouble
the Stanford style of play tomorrow.
Kerr has changed the kick formation;
has drilled the team constantly all
week in that particular defense; and
has trained his kickers in getting
punts off faster and more accurately.
Baker will continue to use the end
over-end pass to which so many critics
mistakenly objected.
Oregon has not gone through the
season without a defeat. Last Satur
day, the Washington State eleven out
played and beat the Webfooters 13-7.
A week before, Idaho held them to a
0-0 tie.
The Stanford rooting section will be
composed of "Swede" Leistner, and
"Red" Richardson, in addition to the
many Cardinal alumni who "live in
Portland. Stanford graduates are plan
ning a big celebration the evening be
fore the game, which includes a ban
quet for the varsity, and a parade
through the main streets of Portland
following the dinner.
Coach "Shy" Huntington, of the Oregon varsity, will again attempt to over
come a yearly repeated "jinx" tomorrow afternoon when his Webfoot eleven
meets Stanford at Portland.
Oregon has never been able to beat a Stanford eleven. Even when the
Cards were doomed to defeat, they always managed to squeeze ahead with a
victory. In 1920, when Big Bill Steers was with the Webfooters, and the
Cardinal team was reputed to have nothing whatever, Stanford recovered a
fumble near the goal line, and bucked the ball'over for a touchdown. "Dink"
Templeton added three extra points with a drop kick, and Stanford won 10-0.
Oregon, therefore, is after revenge. The only hindrance seems to be the fact
that Stanford has the strongest team in years, and unless Oregon comes up
with a spurt, the jinx is likely to continue at least for another season.
Card Substitutes Are Dependable
Stanford meets Oregon with twenty-two men of first team strength and
calibre. The aggressiveness and dependability of the substitutes shown in
the Olympic game proved that the Cards have not a team which can be
rightfully termed a "first" varsity. The substitutes are the mainstay of the
squad, and in the backfield this strength is most evident. Coach Kerr can
call on three quarterbacks: Mitchell, Campbell, and Kirwan; he has the choice
of three fullbacks: Nevers, Solomon, and Hey; and five halfbacks of varying
ability: Woodward, Cuddeback, Cleaveland, Dennis, and Wheat.
The shift of Campbell to half, and Howard Mitchell to a steady position at
quarter, did not materialize in the Olympic game. It is not likely that it
ever will materialize now that the backfield is going great-guns. Cuddeback

is a mainstay; his work during the<$
Olympic fracas has given him a right-1
ful claim to a steady berth.
Nevers to Do Punting
Nevers will likely do the kicking
against Oregon, unless Kerr decides i
to use Cuddeback on account o£,. the 1
latter's sped in getting the punts away.j
But Ernie is a valuable line plunger,
and Kerr cannot afford to do long j
without his services. Solomon has the
speed, but his weight handicaps him '
when the extra drive to put over a
touchdown or make yardage is needed. '
