# CARD VARSITY CLASHES WITH OREGON TOMORROW IN NORTH
## Substitutes Form Main Defense of Rejuvenated Stanford Eleven; Injuries Weaken Oregon 
### David Meiklejohn 
Coach "Shy" Huntington, of the Oregon varsity, will again attempt to over
come a yearly repeated "jinx" tomorrow afternoon when his Webfoot eleven
meets Stanford at Portland.
Oregon has never been able to beat a Stanford eleven. Even when the
Cards were doomed to defeat, they always managed to squeeze ahead with a
victory. In 1920, when Big Bill Steers was with the Webfooters, and the
Cardinal team was reputed to have nothing whatever, Stanford recovered a
fumble near the goal line, and bucked the ball'over for a touchdown. "Dink"
Templeton added three extra points with a drop kick, and Stanford won 10-0.
Oregon, therefore, is after revenge. The only hindrance seems to be the fact
that Stanford has the strongest team in years, and unless Oregon comes up
with a spurt, the jinx is likely to continue at least for another season.
Card Substitutes Are Dependable
Stanford meets Oregon with twenty-two men of first team strength and
calibre. The aggressiveness and dependability of the substitutes shown in
the Olympic game proved that the Cards have not a team which can be
rightfully termed a "first" varsity. The substitutes are the mainstay of the
squad, and in the backfield this strength is most evident. Coach Kerr can
call on three quarterbacks: Mitchell, Campbell, and Kirwan; he has the choice
of three fullbacks: Nevers, Solomon, and Hey; and five halfbacks of varying
ability: Woodward, Cuddeback, Cleaveland, Dennis, and Wheat.
The shift of Campbell to half, and Howard Mitchell to a steady position at
quarter, did not materialize in the Olympic game. It is not likely that it
ever will materialize now that the backfield is going great-guns. Cuddeback

is a mainstay; his work during the<$
Olympic fracas has given him a right-1
ful claim to a steady berth.
Nevers to Do Punting
Nevers will likely do the kicking
against Oregon, unless Kerr decides i
to use Cuddeback on account o£,. the 1
latter's sped in getting the punts away.j
But Ernie is a valuable line plunger,
and Kerr cannot afford to do long j
without his services. Solomon has the
speed, but his weight handicaps him '
when the extra drive to put over a
touchdown or make yardage is needed. '
The backfield men on the Lemon-
Yellow squad, according to reports
from Eugene, are in bad physical '
shape. Terjesen, left half, has a
wrenched knee, but he will in allj
