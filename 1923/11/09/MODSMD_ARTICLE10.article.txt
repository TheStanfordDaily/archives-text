# Big Game Dinner Dance Planned By Rally Committee

. "So after the Market street serpentine,
we dashed up to the Fairmont for the
Big Game dinner dance, â€”and boy, it was
a cruel party, and I don't mean maybe."
Thereby anticipating what Bill Brogan
will have to say on the morning of No
vember 25. if plans now under way by
the Rally Committee are carried through.
These plans call for the holding of a
rip-roaring Cardinal celebration at a San
Francisco hotel on the evening of the
Big Game. The party will come alter a
scheduled serpentine up Market street
after the game, and will be strictly a
Stanford joy-jag.
Alumni and students will be invited to
attend the celebration, which is a tradi
tional affair after the game. Stanford
songs and yells, Stanford music, and the
Stanford yell leader will be included on
the program.
According to Bob Titus, chairman of
the committee in charge, the affair will
probably be staged at the Fairmont again.
Announcements concerning reservations
will be made later.
Any way you look at it the night of
November 24 is going to bear a flaming
Cardinal tinge; and the Stanford party
planned is going to be the reddest thing
in sight, if Titus isn't kidding.
