# CLEAR THOUGHT IS NEEDED
## Dr. Jordan Compares Temperamental People With Instinct-Controlled Salmon 
### 
Using the life history of the salmon
as the basis for his theme, Dr. Jordan
appealed for more clear thought in the
world today and less temperamentalism,
in a talk on "How It Feels to He a Sal

" The purpose of a university is to

there is no lake.
Jordan Lake in Alaska, where Dr. Jor

mon, is one of the favorite haunts of that
fish during the winter months. There
are three other lakes below it on the
Naha river, a switt, clear stream leading
to the sea. Dr. Jordan used this setting
last night in describing the reproduction
and instinctive actions of the salmon.
"The male furrows in the gravel and

about 2000 eggs which are later fertilized i
by the male. The red salmon spawns j
when it i - 4 years old. and then only oncc. i
