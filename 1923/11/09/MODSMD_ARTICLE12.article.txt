# CLEAR THOUGHT IS NEEDED
## Dr. Jordan Compares Temperamental People With Instinct-Controlled Salmon 
### 
Using the life history of the salmon
as the basis for his theme, Dr. Jordan
appealed for more clear thought in the
world today and less temperamentalism,
in a talk on "How It Feels to He a Sal
mon" at his home last evening.
" The purpose of a university is to
teach students to use the upper part of
their brain, and not the lower or tem
peramental. I here are a good many peo
ple who follow only their instincts; they
arc controlled by their subconscious minds
which is the cause of much divorci;,
" I he salmon's actions are all tempera
mental and instinctive. Fifty thousand
years agb, this fish acted just as it does
today: 50.000 years hence it will act in
the same way with no apparent change,"
Instinct Governs Salmon
Red salmon have a highly developed

instinct, I)r. Jordan explained. This type
of salmon never goes up a river in which
there is no lake.
Jordan Lake in Alaska, where Dr. Jor
dan made an extensive study of the sal
mon, is one of the favorite haunts of that
fish during the winter months. There
are three other lakes below it on the
Naha river, a switt, clear stream leading
to the sea. Dr. Jordan used this setting
last night in describing the reproduction
and instinctive actions of the salmon.
"The male furrows in the gravel and
pebbles, and the female then deposits !
about 2000 eggs which are later fertilized i
by the male. The red salmon spawns j
when it i - 4 years old. and then only oncc. i
It has but one set of germ cells and j
never develops more; when these cells
arc spent, it shrivels up and dies.
Hatch in Cold Water
"Hatching takes place when the water
gets colder —in the fall—which is quite
unlike most other fishes which hatch in
the spring and in warm water.
"The cells divide and reproduce, and
when the egg finally open, the little sal
mon about an inch long, come out and
take their chance in the world. They
stay an entire year in Jordan Lake and
are attacked by trout and ducks, several
hundred of them being eaten each day.
"In the springtime, the little salmon
drop down from Jordan Lake into the
other lakes with their heads always
pointed upstream. Their feed consists
mostly of insects, but there is greater
abundance of food in the sea. Salmon
are b to 8 inches in length when they
reach the ocean.
Hundreds of Fish Devoured
"Two-thirds of the fish are eaten on
their way to the sea, mostly by fish hawks
and the bald-headed eagle. The latter is
a 'piratical parasite' inasmuch as he pur
sues the hawk and takes the fish away
from him."
The further apart the concentric rings
are on the scale of the salmon, and the
more there are of them, the older the
fish is, Dr. Jordan said.
"At three years of age, the salmon
instinctively follow the river back from
which they first came, and they make
about twenty-five miles in three days.
They never head in on a stream which
has no lake."
The Big King salmon which flourishes
in the Columbia river and which is also
found in Monterey Bay, is the reddest,
the largest, and the best of all salmon,
Dr. Jordan said in explaining the dif
ferent varieties of this fish. When it is
four years old, it weighs about 20 pounds.
The Red _ Salmon averages about 10
pounds, while the Silver salmon weighs
five pounds. The Humpback is small and
has only been canned quite recently. The
Calico salmon is the poorest of all; the
flesh is pale and soft. The Landlock
never reaches the sea. Some of this va
riety are found in Lake Washington. At
lantic salmon are big trout and spawn a
number of times.

about 2000 eggs which are later fertilized i
by the male. The red salmon spawns j
when it i - 4 years old. and then only oncc. i
It has but one set of germ cells and j
never develops more; when these cells
arc spent, it shrivels up and dies.
Hatch in Cold Water
"Hatching takes place when the water
gets colder —in the fall—which is quite
unlike most other fishes which hatch in
the spring and in warm water.
"The cells divide and reproduce, and
when the egg finally open, the little sal
mon about an inch long, come out and
take their chance in the world. They
stay an entire year in Jordan Lake and
are attacked by trout and ducks, several
hundred of them being eaten each day.
"In the springtime, the little salmon
drop down from Jordan Lake into the
other lakes with their heads always
pointed upstream. Their feed consists
mostly of insects, but there is greater
abundance of food in the sea. Salmon
are b to 8 inches in length when they
reach the ocean.
Hundreds of Fish Devoured
"Two-thirds of the fish are eaten on
their way to the sea, mostly by fish hawks
and the bald-headed eagle. The latter is
a 'piratical parasite' inasmuch as he pur
sues the hawk and takes the fish away
from him."
The further apart the concentric rings
are on the scale of the salmon, and the
more there are of them, the older the
fish is, Dr. Jordan said.
"At three years of age, the salmon
instinctively follow the river back from
which they first came, and they make
about twenty-five miles in three days.
They never head in on a stream which
has no lake."
The Big King salmon which flourishes
in the Columbia river and which is also
found in Monterey Bay, is the reddest,
the largest, and the best of all salmon,
Dr. Jordan said in explaining the dif
ferent varieties of this fish. When it is
four years old, it weighs about 20 pounds.
The Red _ Salmon averages about 10
pounds, while the Silver salmon weighs
five pounds. The Humpback is small and
has only been canned quite recently. The
Calico salmon is the poorest of all; the
flesh is pale and soft. The Landlock
never reaches the sea. Some of this va
riety are found in Lake Washington. At
lantic salmon are big trout and spawn a
number of times.
Using the life history of the salmon
as the basis for his theme, Dr. Jordan
appealed for more clear thought in the
world today and less temperamentalism,
in a talk on "How It Feels to He a Sal
mon" at his home last evening.
" The purpose of a university is to
teach students to use the upper part of
their brain, and not the lower or tem
peramental. I here are a good many peo
ple who follow only their instincts; they
arc controlled by their subconscious minds
which is the cause of much divorci;,
" I he salmon's actions are all tempera
mental and instinctive. Fifty thousand
years agb, this fish acted just as it does
today: 50.000 years hence it will act in
the same way with no apparent change,"
Instinct Governs Salmon
Red salmon have a highly developed

instinct, I)r. Jordan explained. This type
of salmon never goes up a river in which
there is no lake.
Jordan Lake in Alaska, where Dr. Jor
dan made an extensive study of the sal
mon, is one of the favorite haunts of that
fish during the winter months. There
are three other lakes below it on the
Naha river, a switt, clear stream leading
to the sea. Dr. Jordan used this setting
last night in describing the reproduction
and instinctive actions of the salmon.
"The male furrows in the gravel and
pebbles, and the female then deposits !
about 2000 eggs which are later fertilized i
by the male. The red salmon spawns j
when it i - 4 years old. and then only oncc. i
