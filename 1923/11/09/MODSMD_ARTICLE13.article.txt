# CUBS HAVE SLIGHT EDGE OVER BABES
## COACH HUNT'S FRESHMEN ARE PRIMED FOR ANNUAL "LITTLE BIG GAME" GRIDIRON CLASSIC California Team Is Heavier Than Cards; Berkeley Has Biggest Advantage in Backfield 
### Wallace Knox 
For the first time in several years, the Stanford babes have a chance to
win the "Little Big Game" which takes place at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in
the stadium. The California Cubs are conceded a slight edge, but Blue and
Gold rooters do not consider the game a cinch. No preliminary will precede
the freshman game, which is the only event 011 the day's sporting program in
the stadium.
Hunt's men hope tomorrow will be their day. They have been steadily im
proving since they tasted defeat at the hands of the U. S. C. youngsters, and
will present a much better aggregation against the Bruins.
The Berkeley team outweighs the babes four pounds to the man, the Cards
averaging 170 pounds, while the Bears weigh 174 pounds. From tackle to
tackle, the lines are about equal, the figures being 182 pounds ror the Cubs,
and 181 pounds for the freshmen.
Ihe Cub ends and backfield have the biggest advantage, outweighing the
Redshirts by six pounds per man. Hunt's backfield averages 164 pounds,
and the Blue and Gold backs weigh 170. With the lines of equal weight, this

■ backfield weight advantage will not be
I of great assistance to the Cubs, for the
Babes have some fast enough backs to
overtake the Bears if they break away.
Scores Mean Little
While comparative scores are by no
means accurate methods of determin
ing the winner, they may give some
I light on the subject. U. S. C. freshmen
defeated both Stanford and California,
i the former by 10-0, and the latter, 14-7.
The scores do not indicate the type of
games played in each case, for Stan
ford was continually in danger of being
scored upon, while California lost
chances to score by inexcusable fum
bles. «
The Davis Farm gridders trounced
the Babes by a 7-6 score early in the
j season, and then lost to the Cubs, 18-0.
This score tends to indicate the superi
ority of the California team. The Davis
Farm players displayed a good brand
of football the day they beat Hunt's
gridders and deserved their victory,
even though the Babes seemed to be
having an off day.

California's freshmen had little
trouble in trouncing Modesto Junior
college, 43-0, while the Stanford year
j lings had a struggle to defeat them by
a one-touchdown margin, the score be
ing 7-0. Considering everything, the
results of the games with these three
schools point to a superiority for the I
Berkeley men. However, so far as
dope is concerned, it is well to remem
ber that the odds were even on the
Little Big Game last year, and Cali
fornia won by a 54-0 score.
Cubs Have Good Backfield
California has some good material
in its backfield. Walkie Mills, as a
kicker, is as good as most of the var-1
sity punters on the coast. He has out-1
punted every man he has kicked
against during the past season. Earl
Jabs, who plays full, is a good line
plunger, and a wonder on the second
defense.
Dick Blewitt, the '27 captain, is pro
-1 bably the best end on the team. He is '
a brother of Bill Blewett, the Bears'
j crack varsity backfield man, and is
doing his best to live up to his bro
ther's reputation, and is incidently i
succeeding. Bill Cowes, a colored half-1
back, has shown up well as a line
plunger.
, Hunt put his charges through their
paces in the Stadium yesterday after- :
noon. A light practice will be held this
afternoon, after which the team will
not meet until they line up against
their greatest rivals. The Stadium is
being used to let the frosh get the
"feel" of the turf upon which they will
have to play.
After practice yesterday, Hunt was
of the opinion that he would start
Ryan at quarter and Natcher at center, j
Baldwin and Price have been giving
some hard competition to the two se- j
lested, and may yet oust them. Ryan j
was given preference over "Baldwin, be
cause he is a little better field general
and has had more experience. Ryan ;
was on the Olympic Club team last
year. Natcher is a few pounds heavier
! than Price and is a better passer.
The line-up tomorrow will probably
be:
Stanford — California —
Shipkey LER Blewett (Capt.)
Swan (Capt.) LTR Green j
Mahan LGR Niswander'
Natcher C Barnard
Post RGL Perry
Poulson RTL Hoover
Adams REL Huber
