# CUBS HAVE SLIGHT EDGE OVER BABES
## COACH HUNT'S FRESHMEN ARE PRIMED FOR ANNUAL "LITTLE BIG GAME" GRIDIRON CLASSIC California Team Is Heavier Than Cards; Berkeley Has Biggest Advantage in Backfield 
### Wallace Knox 
For the first time in several years, the Stanford babes have a chance to
win the "Little Big Game" which takes place at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon in
the stadium. The California Cubs are conceded a slight edge, but Blue and
Gold rooters do not consider the game a cinch. No preliminary will precede
the freshman game, which is the only event 011 the day's sporting program in
the stadium.
Hunt's men hope tomorrow will be their day. They have been steadily im
proving since they tasted defeat at the hands of the U. S. C. youngsters, and
will present a much better aggregation against the Bruins.
The Berkeley team outweighs the babes four pounds to the man, the Cards
averaging 170 pounds, while the Bears weigh 174 pounds. From tackle to
tackle, the lines are about equal, the figures being 182 pounds ror the Cubs,
and 181 pounds for the freshmen.
Ihe Cub ends and backfield have the biggest advantage, outweighing the
Redshirts by six pounds per man. Hunt's backfield averages 164 pounds,
and the Blue and Gold backs weigh 170. With the lines of equal weight, this

■ backfield weight advantage will not be
I of great assistance to the Cubs, for the
Babes have some fast enough backs to
overtake the Bears if they break away.
Scores Mean Little

means accurate methods of determin
ing the winner, they may give some
I light on the subject. U. S. C. freshmen
defeated both Stanford and California,
i the former by 10-0, and the latter, 14-7.
The scores do not indicate the type of
games played in each case, for Stan
ford was continually in danger of being
scored upon, while California lost
chances to score by inexcusable fum
bles. «
The Davis Farm gridders trounced
the Babes by a 7-6 score early in the
j season, and then lost to the Cubs, 18-0.
This score tends to indicate the superi
ority of the California team. The Davis
Farm players displayed a good brand
of football the day they beat Hunt's
gridders and deserved their victory,
even though the Babes seemed to be
