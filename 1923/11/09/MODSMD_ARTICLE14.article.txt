# "BEAT BEAR CUBS" STRESSED IN TALKS BEFORE FRESHMEN
## Coach Hunt and Captain Swan Address First Year Men At Rally in Encina 
### 
"We arc going to whip the California
freshmen and then beat them."
"If you want to see a good bloody
battle, be on hand."
In these words, Coach "Husky" Hunt,
grid mentor, and Fred Swan, '27 captain,
told the boys what they thought about
j the prospects for the "Little Big Game."
I Coach Hunt is represented in the first
paragraph ; the second expresses Swan's
! sentiments.
The occasion was the freshman rally,
i held in the Encina club rooms last eve
| ning when about 400 first-year men as
sembled to give the freshman suad a
I cheer before the coming shindig. The
I rally, conducted by "Red" Bell and
i . .
"Dutch" McAllister, assistant yell leader.
was one of the noisiest brawls the fresh
! met) have ever staged. The babes proved
beyond a doubt that they can pipe up
when necessary, and "childish treble"
i doesn't apply to that piping, either.
"Everybody says before a game that
â€¢ they are going out there to fight," said
! Fred Swan in commenting on football
prospects. "In this case it is true, no
I fooling. We've got a great gang, and
| they're out to get those, fellows. If you
! want to see a nice bloody battle, be on
hand Saturday."
Swan also urged the bleacher athletes
to come out and give their lungs a work
out at the Little Big Game.
Entire confidence in the ability of the
freshman eleven to romp on the Berkeley
Cubs was expressed by Coach Hunt in
his brief talk before the rally. The Car
dinal youngsters have been slow to de
velop, he said, but the showing made by
them in the U. S. C. game indicates that
they have at last hit their stride.
