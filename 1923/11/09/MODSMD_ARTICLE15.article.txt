# RAM'S HEAD SHOW PLOTS TO BE TURNED IN BY NOVEMBER 15
## 
### 
Plots for Ram's Head's shows next
quarter should be turned in by next
Thursday. Only a scenario is expected at
this time. The best one will be selected
by the society to be worked out into the
finished play at a later date.
The play should not be just an ordinary
farce, says F. I). Manuoccir, who is re
ceiving them, but should be built to con
tain parts and situations that will be
laken by male actors in female roles. An
ordinary present-day burlesque with
plenty of local color is wanted rather than
something with a fantastical setting.
Songs and lyrics are asked for imme
diately by Lewis Alabaster. Several have
already been submitted by James Gillen,
Earl Glauber and Alabaster.
