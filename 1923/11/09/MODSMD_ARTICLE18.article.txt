# The 						Varsity of 1927
## 
### 
Stars of the future will meet their big test to
morrow. The Stanford freshman eleven has been
trained six weeks, essentially to give the incoming
generation of Cardinal athletes their first inkling of
the Warner system. That team will play California
in the stadium for the jellybean championship of
the bay, with whatever odds can be devised pointing
away from the Cardinal.
Lack of real information leaves the Stanford
freshmen in the usual position of being the weaker
team by tradition, with nothing tangible to back up
the assumption. Points of contact on comparative
score charts are so obscure as to leave even this
doubtful judgment without authority.
There is one basis on which a real comparison can
be made, and that is all in the Dinks' favor: the fact
that there are no press-agent stars in the write-ups
of the California Cubs' games; no Jimmy Dixons,
no "Smoke" Francis's, no Bill Blewetts. Last year
the Babes went against such an aggregation of
power-plus players with nothing but a species of
overconfidence to back them up. The result was
ghastly.
This year one hears nothing but "The California
frosh are good"—the usual thing to say about an
untried team. Tomorrow is the day of the trial, with
eleven potential Stanford varsity men sitting on the
jury.
Meanwhile Coach Hunt is snickering at the pessi
mists who fear a blue sunset.
