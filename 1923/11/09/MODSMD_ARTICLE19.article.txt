# Cooperation or Lung Exercise
## 
### 
The spirit of co-operation at Stanford is well en
trenched and it seems conducive to more satisfac
tory results than bombshell tirades of the I. W. W.
vintage. A little honest effort by those supposedly
receiving the benefits of any system or plan will go
a long way toward bringing the golden glow of
happiness to all concerned.
The most recent indication of co-operation is
shown in the formation of the advisory board for
the Encina dining halls. Eaters are now going to
have something to say about the victuals they con
sume for the price of*sl per day.
Kickers will probably calm themselves when they
remember that their student representatives are
trying to get them the best food for the money.
And so co-operation improves the digestion.
Comptroller Roth has always pursued the policy
of co-operation. The Union Board of Governors
which watches over the Stanford Union is another
example. Innumerable cases arise during the year
in which the students are asked to lend their abilities
and suggestions.
Evolution in the perfection of campus enterprises
seems to bring home more bacon than revolution or
eternal raillery at those in charge.
Which brings up the old subject of constructive
criticism. Limitations and imperfectations are al
ways with us, and it is easy to pick out the flaws
and exercise the lungs.
Rut we are supposed to take on the polish of the
educated at Stanford—and if not the polish, at least
the quality to think before "popping off" with ill
chosen ideas. Let us offer criticism which is in
tended as constructive in solving the campus ques
tions of the day. —R. E.

It does no good to advocate glasses for people
.who take notes on somebody else's cuff.
