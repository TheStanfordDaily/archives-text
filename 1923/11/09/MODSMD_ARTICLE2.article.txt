Armistice Day will be the occasion of
a special program at the regular Sunday
vesper at 4 o'clock in the Memorial
church. Winifred Estabrook, soprano,
and the Stanford Glee Club will assist

"My Country," Symphonic Poem, by
Smetana will be tlie first number. Clar
ence Dickinson, in his Excursions in
Musical History says this work is the
"noblest musical monument of the great
Bohemian Reformation." The first move
ment is called "Tabor," after Ziska's
armed camp on the top of Mt. Tabor,
which gave its name to a whole section
of Hussite believers, the Taborites.
The hymn "America" will then be sung
followed by a prayer. The "Improperia"
toy Palestrina will be the next number on
the program. The text of the "Im
properia" ( Reproaches), written partly in
Latin and partly in Greek, is designed to
illustrate the sorrowful remonstrance of
the Lord, concerning the ungrateful re
turn of the people for the benefits be
stowed upon them. Palestrina's simple
setting of these responses rank among
the most beautiful passages in sacred
music.
'A Prayer for Peace" by Paul Held,
is an expressive composition written dur
ing the late war by this gifted young
New York organist.
Handel's "Soprano's Aria" from "The
Messiah" will be followed by a selection
by Smetana, the second movement from
"My Country." The movement is called
"Blanik" after Mt. Blanik, within which,
legend says, the old Bohemian King
Wenceslas sleeps through the centuries,
to be awakened some day when his coun
try's need is greatest and when he will
then come to its aid.
