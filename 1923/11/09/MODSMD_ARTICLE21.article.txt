Consider, children, the gentle cabbage—
It never sleeps through eight o'clocks; ' n
It never has to wear a Tuxedo;
It never queens, -*«:
Plays poker for keeps,
Or crams for an ex;
And when it goes to its final rest,
It always has a nice slab of corned-beef
>' To recline upon. j
Oh, to be a gentle cabbage!
We should harp upon this theme
In a wild rapture of metrical poesy (|
Only
There is no word in the English tongue
That rhymes with "cabbage."
