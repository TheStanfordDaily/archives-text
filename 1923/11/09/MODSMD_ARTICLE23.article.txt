# A 						CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY Rosco
## 
### 
Rosco is another Social Problem. He is a radiomaniac.
His information is derived wholly from bedtime stories
for morons, market reports, and the rendering of "I Love
You Truly, Dear," by the Um-Pah Jazz Trio.
His speech is limited to static, auditotrons, electro
lytic interrupters, and hook-ups. His pockets are stuffed
with wiring diagrams, carborundum crystals, bakelite
panels, and assorted wave-lengths.
Perhaps some day Rosco will foist off his set on some
deluded amateur, and have enough left to pay me back
tht six bits I loaned him to buy condenser knobs.
Then I'll probably let him come around and sit on my
bed again.
Bobbie
Mortals, gaze on Bobbie, the Quad Rabbit!
Bobby is being collegiate.
Collegiate hatband, collegiate pipe, collegiate mous
tache. Much collegiate posing near sandstone arches or
under towering oaks, where tourists from loway can
stare at him and point him out for one of those wild
college youths.
The true test of the collegiate character, as exempli
fied by Bobby, is being on probation three quarters
straight.
Harry
Harry is a holdover.
The mere statement does not satisfy Harry. He blats
it to the world.
Holdovering, or holding-over, is his major sport. Listen
in on his frequent broadcasting:
"Yes, when the first class grabbed their sheepskins
in '59, all the famous birds decided to stay another year
and graduate by themselves, and it's been the same
ever since."
The only things Harry needs are a varsity sweater
and a flair for playing bridge at all hours.
