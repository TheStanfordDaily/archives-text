"What," we asked our roommate, of whom more mis
information can be gathered in one minute than one
Prohibition lecturer can put out in an hour, "is on at
the movies this week-end?" '
"Well, old bean" —you see, he reads the funny papers
too —"if what you want is for me to do your movie re
views for you, why, just say so, and I shall low-brow
our public (all three of them) for about the usual line
you hand them."
Overruling any protests we may have been about to
make by a violent attack upon the corpus delicti, or
whatever it is they are always looking for in the law
department, he sat down to the typewriter:
"Hoot Gibson is coming to one of the Paly theaters,
in a darned good story—l forget the name, but it is a
sea story you ought to see! (Laughter.) At the other
place in Paly is coming Charles Ray in 'Smudge," and
it is the worst blotch of a picture Charles Ray has run
for some little time, and he has gotten off a terrible
bunch lately. Quite an uneven balance for the week
end—one good picture with a real punch, and one that
those who don't get there early enough will have to go
to, if you get what I mean."
Here he left off to put some dope on his poison-oak,
and I left with the review. I was going to re-write it,
but I was bothered so darn much by my poison oak that
I forgot it!
