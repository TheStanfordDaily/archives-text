## 
### 
Ideas wanted.
Anyone having happy hunches concern
(ing amusing or spectacular stunts for the
| Big Game rally, for the bonfire, or for
i use by the Cardinal rooting sections at
i the Big Game, is requested to guard
i those hunches carefully.
I They may be valuable.
By submitting them to Phil Newill,
; Mike Ely, Henry Mack, Carl Shoup, or
S Bob Titus, the discovered may have his
I ideas assayed by hunch experts. 11" they
! prove to be high grade stuff, they will
J be adopted for use in connection with the
j out-size contest 011 November 24, to the
i glory of the University and the honor
j of the originator.
It is the intention of the rally commit
-1 tee to have the celebrations leading up
to the California brawl as distinctly dif
ferent and as inspiring as possible; and
it is particularly desired that the rooting
sections display some new and snappy
stuff this year. It is possible that a large
bag of loppy-pops will be awarded the
gent or lady contributing the'niftiest idea
for any of the events.
Plans for the rally are thus far rather
nebulous, although it is possible that
Rani's Head society will contribute some
thing to the gaiety of the affair. Stunts
and feature numbers are now being pre
pared by the society for use at this time.
