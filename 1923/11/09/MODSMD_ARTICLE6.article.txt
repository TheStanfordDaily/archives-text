# FORD MEETS FORD IN CRASH; $2 CASH SETTLES DAMAGE
## 
### 
A scraping of tin and the report of
a tire giving way to pressure were
heard when Ford hit Ford at the post
office yesterday afternoon.
Ray Pike, Sequoia hall, had parked
his coupe at the side of the post office
building while he went in to get his
mail. A stranger on the campus, driv
ing a new Ford sedan, turned the cor
ner from Lasuen. Then, fearing he
had turned too slowly and would run
into the curb by the Women's Club
house, he swerved sharply to his left
and rammed the rear wheel of Pike's
car. The impact shoved the car into
the side of the building, jammed the
fender, and blew out the inside rear
tire.
Both car owners were soon engaged
in a controversy as to the amount of
damage done. The stranger confessed
his fault and was willing to settle.
Pike looked the car over and with the
aid of expert advice from curious on
lookers, agreed to a settlement on the
spot. The stranger handed him two
dollars and the damage was compen
sated.
