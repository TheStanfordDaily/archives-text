In an attempt to come back following
its slow start this season, the Stanford
soccer varsity will go against the Cali
fornia eleven Monday afternoon on Cal
ifornia field in the first ame of the an
nual series. The varsity contest will be
preceded by a game between the fresh
man teams of the two institutions.
Although the Cards have dropped three
of their five starts this season, they are
now playing in the best form they have
shown this year. Coach Harry Maloney
has pointed the varsity for the California
game, and inspite of the Blue" and Gold
paper advantage, Monday's encounter is
expected to be one of the closest in years.
Stanford holds a big lead over Cali
fornia in the total of games won, the
kickers from the farm having won 23
of the 28 contests in which they have
met their Berkeley rivals. The Cards
dropped only two games during the last
three years, but the loss of eight regulars
from last year's squad has made it nec
essary for Maloney .to build up an en
tirely new machine.
Captain Bill Svvayne will start the
game at inside right while alongside of
him will be Wu Ta'am and Bing Moy,
the two speedy Chinese forwards. Ta'am

a transfer and formerly starred on Palo
Alto High teams. Don Clark at right
