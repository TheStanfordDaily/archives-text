### 
Seniors unexpectedly defeated the jun
iors in hockey scrimmage yesterday after
noon 7-0. The freshmen have been
showing up well in practice with the
sophomores and have scored against them
seve;dl times.
'T'he freshmen show possibilities of j
becoming one of the strongest first-year j
teams in several seasons," says Miss!
Bunting, hockey coach and director of j
Roble gymnasium.
Interclass scrimmage will continue to
day and the results will, in part, deter
mine which two of the four teams will
play against California November 17.*
The two teams which in the coaches' and
the hockey manager's judgment are
strongest will be chosen, so that the two
weaker teams will have an extra week to
practice before their intercollegiate game
with Mills November 24.
Team captains are as follows: Fresh- j
men, Marie Manchee; sophomores, Jean
Ward; juniors, Doris Harter, and sen
iors, Ruth Jamison.
