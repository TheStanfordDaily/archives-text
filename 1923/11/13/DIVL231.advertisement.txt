Dance Frocks
for the Sophomore Cotillion
as delightful as fairy dreams
I $29.75 to $75
Of Chiffon as light as the wings of a butterfly—of velvets that glow like captured
moonlight—of taffetas crisp as new blown roses. As for colors they go from burn
ing American beauty and glorious sunset hues to coral pink, pure rose, jade
. turquoise and maize as yellow as is Midas-beaten to pure gold. Your dream of
just the kind of frock you had in mind for the Cotillion will come true when you
consult the price tags on even the most exquisite—Beads, laces, flowers and velvet
ribbons will answer sparkling, festive lights—
