# STANFORD BABES DEFEAT CALIFORNIA CUBS 12-0
## Bogue Scores Two Touchdowns For Stanford in First and Second Halves; Hyland Stars 
### Wallace Knox 
Playing for the breaks that did not come, the California freshmen went down
before the Stanford yearlings in the stadium last Saturday by a 12-to-0 score.
The Cardinal babes held the line against four plunges within their 4-yard line
early in the first quarter, and the Bruins never seemed to recover their drive to
any dangerous extent.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's use of reserve strength entitles him to a large share
in the credit for the victory. Bogue's injured knee prevented him from hold
ing down a regular place in the line-up, but Hunt sent him in when scores
seemed imminent, and he carried the ball over for both touchdowns.
Adams and Shipkey are the sweetest pair of freshman ends seen here for
some time. Shipkey did not allow a single Bear play to get past him, and in
addition got under a 30-yard pass, which placed the ball within scoring distance
of the goal. Adams was everywhere.
Mills, who did the kicking for the Cubs, did not live up to his reputation as
the best freshman kicker on the Coast. He was outkicked by both Phillips
and Hyland, who gained consistently for the Babes on exchanges. Adams and

Swan were down the field on every
punt and nailed the safety man in his
tracks.
Captain Fred Swan played a whale
of a game at tackle. He had little
trouble in opening big holes for the
babQ backs,
California kicked to Hylftnd, who
punted after Herth had failed to gain
through guard. Cowes made first
downs but California lost the ball
when the next four plays failed to
gain.
Green blocked Hyland's kick, and
many thought the game was to be a
replica of the Stanford-U. S. C. varsity
game. Cowes and Jabbs made yardage
three times for California and placed
the ball on the babe six-inch line.
Jabbs tried the line for a touchdown
but the Stanford forwards stopped the
play and California was turned back.
Hyland kicked out of danger, and
the Cubs worked the ball to the 30-
yard line, where Dick Blewett attempt
ed a drop-kick, but failed. An exchange
of punts gained 8 yards for the Babes,
and then Hyland got off a 46-yard
punt as the quarter ended. Score, Stan
ford 0, California 0.
Mahan kicked to Mills on his 12-
yard line at the start of the second
half. Mills punted out of bounds on
the 36-yard line. Three exchanges of
punts followed, with Stanford gaining.
Phillips tossed a beautiful 30-yard
pass to Shipkey, putting the ball on
the 8-yard line. Bogue replaced Mor
rison and on his fourth attempt carried
the ball over the goal line for the sec
ond touchdown. Phillips failed to con
vert. Score, Stanford 12, California 0.
The period ended soon after with the
ball in California's hands.

ing down a regular place in the line-up, but Hunt sent him in when scores
seemed imminent, and he carried the ball over for both touchdowns.
Adams and Shipkey are the sweetest pair of freshman ends seen here for
some time. Shipkey did not allow a single Bear play to get past him, and in
addition got under a 30-yard pass, which placed the ball within scoring distance
of the goal. Adams was everywhere.
Mills, who did the kicking for the Cubs, did not live up to his reputation as
the best freshman kicker on the Coast. He was outkicked by both Phillips
and Hyland, who gained consistently for the Babes on exchanges. Adams and

Swan were down the field on every
punt and nailed the safety man in his
tracks.
Captain Fred Swan played a whale
of a game at tackle. He had little
trouble in opening big holes for the
babQ backs,
California kicked to Hylftnd, who
punted after Herth had failed to gain
through guard. Cowes made first
downs but California lost the ball
when the next four plays failed to
gain.
Green blocked Hyland's kick, and
many thought the game was to be a
replica of the Stanford-U. S. C. varsity
game. Cowes and Jabbs made yardage
three times for California and placed
the ball on the babe six-inch line.
Jabbs tried the line for a touchdown
but the Stanford forwards stopped the
play and California was turned back.
Hyland kicked out of danger, and
the Cubs worked the ball to the 30-
yard line, where Dick Blewett attempt
ed a drop-kick, but failed. An exchange
of punts gained 8 yards for the Babes,
and then Hyland got off a 46-yard
punt as the quarter ended. Score, Stan
ford 0, California 0.
Mahan kicked to Mills on his 12-
yard line at the start of the second
half. Mills punted out of bounds on
the 36-yard line. Three exchanges of
punts followed, with Stanford gaining.
Phillips tossed a beautiful 30-yard
pass to Shipkey, putting the ball on
the 8-yard line. Bogue replaced Mor
rison and on his fourth attempt carried
the ball over the goal line for the sec
ond touchdown. Phillips failed to con

Playing for the breaks that did not come, the California freshmen went down
before the Stanford yearlings in the stadium last Saturday by a 12-to-0 score.
The Cardinal babes held the line against four plunges within their 4-yard line
early in the first quarter, and the Bruins never seemed to recover their drive to
any dangerous extent.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's use of reserve strength entitles him to a large share
