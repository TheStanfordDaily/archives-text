# SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM TO MEET CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
The senior hockey team has been
chosen to represent the upperclassmen
in the Stanford-California hockey
match to be played here next Satur
day morning. The team to play in the
lower class game has not been of
ficially announced, but the sophomores
will probably be selected.
In field practices here last week the
seniors won from the juniors and
proved themselves the most able to
meet the Californians. The freshmen,
who have an unusually strong team,
have"scored against the sophomores
in several scrimmages. x
A week from Saturday morning the
two class teams which do not play in
the California game will meet Mills
on the Mills campus.
