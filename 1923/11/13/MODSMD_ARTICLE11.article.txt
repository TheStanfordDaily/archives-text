# SNAKE FOILS ATTEMPTS TO BURN FRESHMAN BONFIRE
## 
### 
The Stanford snake has at last vin

attack on Wilson's at eleven o'clock
last night, met in single combat seven
unknown thugs from a near-by (fampus

or seven guys who were sneaking
away towards the machine. They
make the machine about one-half a
