# SNAKE FOILS ATTEMPTS TO BURN FRESHMAN BONFIRE
## 
### 
The Stanford snake has at last vin
dicated himself. One of the greased
hair gentry, returning from a fierce
attack on Wilson's at eleven o'clock
last night, met in single combat seven
unknown thugs from a near-by (fampus
who had just set fire to the Big Game
bonfire, defeated them, sent them
scurrying back home with several
bruises and then proceeded to put out
the incipient combustion blazing at
the base of the bonfire.
Yes, Horace, every word of that is
true. Just put up that shotgun, and
listen while you get the straight dope.
Here was this queener, see? Well,
he was walking out to the campus
after having his fun in Paly, seeing
Harold Lloyd, and his lady, and tak
ing in Wilson's and the usual routine,
yuh know. As he passes the bonfire,
he notices a high-power touring car
standine in the road wiih ihn liirhia

off and the engine running and no one
in or around it.
Now this boy, being somewhat agile
both above and below the neck-line,
sneaks over to the bonfire to investi
gate. Not that he suspects that stu
dents from any nearby campus would
do any dirty work, or nothing like
that, see, but he's a great believer in
spontaneous combustion, see?
Well, just as he arrives at the near
ly-completed funeral pyre, a tiny blaze
leaps out at the base. He gets pretty
excited, see, and tears out after six
or seven guys who were sneaking
away towards the machine. They
make the machine about one-half a
jump ahead, and dash off into the
night.
After having scared off seven vali
ant sneaks, our hero then proceeds to
dash back, put out the fire with his
bare hands, getting them considerably
burnt in the process, and then strolled
ciJraly on to bed.
Now wait a minnit, Horace. Don't
make no rash moves with that shot
gun. Them fellers probably weren't
from where you think they were at
all. Besides, they are showing enough
interest in the Big Game bonfire to
make us feel SURE that they'll be
somewhere close to the stadium the
24th, even if not from where every
body thinks they were from, if you
get what I mean? If you saw the air
raid last year, you do.
Well, we'll give 'em our answer the
24th, not with buckshot, but with
something that will hurt worse.
Won't we, Horace?

After having scared off seven vali
ant sneaks, our hero then proceeds to
dash back, put out the fire with his
bare hands, getting them considerably
burnt in the process, and then strolled
ciJraly on to bed.
Now wait a minnit, Horace. Don't
make no rash moves with that shot
gun. Them fellers probably weren't
from where you think they were at
all. Besides, they are showing enough
interest in the Big Game bonfire to
make us feel SURE that they'll be
somewhere close to the stadium the
24th, even if not from where every
body thinks they were from, if you
get what I mean? If you saw the air
raid last year, you do.
Well, we'll give 'em our answer the
24th, not with buckshot, but with
something that will hurt worse.
Won't we, Horace?
The Stanford snake has at last vin
dicated himself. One of the greased
hair gentry, returning from a fierce
attack on Wilson's at eleven o'clock
last night, met in single combat seven
unknown thugs from a near-by (fampus
who had just set fire to the Big Game
bonfire, defeated them, sent them
scurrying back home with several
bruises and then proceeded to put out
the incipient combustion blazing at
the base of the bonfire.
Yes, Horace, every word of that is
true. Just put up that shotgun, and
listen while you get the straight dope.
Here was this queener, see? Well,
he was walking out to the campus
after having his fun in Paly, seeing
Harold Lloyd, and his lady, and tak
ing in Wilson's and the usual routine,
yuh know. As he passes the bonfire,
he notices a high-power touring car
standine in the road wiih ihn liirhia

off and the engine running and no one
in or around it.
Now this boy, being somewhat agile
both above and below the neck-line,
sneaks over to the bonfire to investi
gate. Not that he suspects that stu
dents from any nearby campus would
do any dirty work, or nothing like
that, see, but he's a great believer in
spontaneous combustion, see?
Well, just as he arrives at the near
ly-completed funeral pyre, a tiny blaze
leaps out at the base. He gets pretty
excited, see, and tears out after six
or seven guys who were sneaking
away towards the machine. They
make the machine about one-half a
jump ahead, and dash off into the
night.
