# RED SHIRTED GRIDDERS DOWN OREGON UNIVERSITY ELEVEN BY 14-3, ON SAWDUST FIELD
## Campbell Returns Punts for Total Of 128 Yards; Thomas Blocks Punt, Makes Touchdown 
### William Wright 
Fighting on a strange field before an enthusiastic section of Stanford
alumni, the Cardinal varsity came through in the pinches and defeated the
University of Oregon eleven, 14 to 3, in Portland Saturday. Captain Campbell's
returning of punts for a total gain of 128 yards was a great factor in the
Stanford triumph, and a blocked punt by "Tommy" Thomas served to make it
more decisive.
The Cardinal line and secondary defense were working at top speed, and
during the first three quarters Oregon was unable to penetrate into Stanford
territory. Nevers, not hurried in his punts, was booting the ball for an
average not far under 50 yards, and the Redshirt running and passing attack
was working perfectly in spite of the heavy sawdust field.
Nevers kicked oft' to Reed, who fumbled on Oregon's 14-yard mark. Stanford
recovered, and after gaining a couple of yards through the line Campbell
tried a kick from placement on the 21-yard line. The kick failed, and Oregon

t> punted back.
1 "Scotch" returned. Latham's punt for
! 26 yards, and the varsity cut loose for
; yardage, then punted. Latham replied
1 with a 40-yard boot, and the Cards
began passing.
j Wheat to Campbell netted 12 yards.
; Cleaveland passed to Lawson, who
' was knocked off his feet, but picked
himself up and went down to the Ore
gon 11-yard line before he was tackled.
Wheat went through tackle for six,
! and around Gfifl for <? ne more. With
! three yardsi to go, Nevers smashed
center for Stanford's first touchdown.
Campbell converted.
; Stanford reached Oregon's one-yard
line in the second quarter, but was
penalized 15 yards for illegal use of
| the hands. Cleaveland made up seven
yards, and Wheat tossed a pass to
Nevers, who caught it across the goal
line, took two steps, and had the ball
i knocked out of his arms by Chapman's
| tackle. It was a close decision, but
! the referee ruled it an incomplete pass
i and Stanford lost a score.
Two minutes after the second period
opened Stanford made her second and
last score. Nevers kicked off, and Ore
gon was held for three downs with
no gain. Thomas broke through,
blocked Latham's punt, recovered the
ball, and carried it 20 yards over the
line. The Scotchman again converted.
The summary of the game shows
j that Oregon gained more yards from
scrimmage than did Stanford, but the
Redshirts smashed the ball through at
| the right time and wasted no effort.
! Campbell gained more ground by his
running back of punts than either
team did from scrimmage, and Nevers
; kept the Webfooters punted well back.
Oregon's belated drive came in the
| final period, and accounted for her
