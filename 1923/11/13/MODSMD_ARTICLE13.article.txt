# Encina Diners Regulate Halls by Advisory Board
## 
### 
Brighton Cain was elected president
and Leonard Schwartz was chosen
secretary of the advisory board for
the Encina dining halls Thursday night.
Comptroller Roth outlined the past
and present policy of the University
in providing eating facilities for stu
dents.
The venture will be strictly co-oper
ative, according to Roth. All men eat
ing in the new halls will share equally
in any profits that accrue through
operations of the Board. The advisory
board will act in an administrative
capacity settling all matters of prices
and refunds.
