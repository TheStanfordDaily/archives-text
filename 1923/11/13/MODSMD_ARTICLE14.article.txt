"I am not singing lullabies. I am
blasting rocks," quoted Rev. Oswald
W. S. McCall, during his Armistice
Day sermon in the Memorial Church
on 'The Scandal of Our Time," the
first of six talks on "Christ or Arma
geddon" to be given on the campus,
"We have betrayed the dream for
which our men died," said Dr. McCall.
'The war is past, but its scars will
never pass. And, as long as we who
call ourselves enlightened permit such
conditions as exist today, of indiffer
ence and selfishness, I say with n poor
Austrailian mother who lost her two
sons in the Great War, 'Oh, my boys,
'tlsn't fair!"
