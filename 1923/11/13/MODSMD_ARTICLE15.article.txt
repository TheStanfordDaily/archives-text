By the light of the flickering torches

>iip for the Idaho game at a rally to
held at, in, and around Lagunita at
7:15 Thursday evening, says Mr. Lapp,
our genial yell leader.
The principal purpose of Thursday's
gathering will be to make great gobs
of noise. Details of the program have
not yet been worked out, but it will
include brief and intelligent speeches
by clever collegians. The torchlight
procession, reminiscent of the days
when Bryan first ran for president,
will be the chief entertainment fea
ture.
Burt Lapp returned from Oregon
with a new ambition. It is to develop
an undergraduate rooting section hav
ing the same fire shown by the Stan
ford alumni at the Oregon game last
Saturday, "The spirit shown by that
crowd of 300 was a revelation to me,"
said Lapp today. "That gang gave the
team more solid and continuous sup
port than I would have believed pos
sible, Many of them were gray-haired;
but that didn't stop them from cutting
loose with a Joyous abandon that un
dergraduates mighty envy.
"The alumni in Oregon are a great
bunch, and anything I can say or do
for them I certainly will."
