# The

"So the Oregon team walked off the field happy —
they had scored on Stanford."

Sport writers in the North talked about the
"mighty Red juggernaut," the "colossus of the
South," and other terms of endearment; but the
greatest praise of all was that sentence which indi
cated that Oregon, a team which had held the feared
Idaho eleven to zero, was happy that it could even
score on the Cardinal.
That sort of elation indicates the real power the
Red team displayed in Portland. It is refreshing
language to those who,, before the arrival of the
Warner system, were accustomed to console them
selves by similar statements.

Those who saw the California-Trojan game have
this to say: "California didn't make her two goals
on straight football; they used tricks, one of which
they could have well saved for the Big Game. But
say—California's going to be hard to beat."
* * *
Now, wtio ever heard of California when she
wasn't hard to beat? And who would want to go to
a Big Game which was a forty-point cinch ?
What has impressed the Daily in the events of
the last week-end is this: the Stanford eleven is
going to be hard to defeat.
The Cardinal team, composed of twenty-two first
string players, has the momentum of mid-season to
back it up, and anything that gets in the way will
be met by a mighty impact. This is Stanford's year,
and the Stanford drive will not be stopped.
