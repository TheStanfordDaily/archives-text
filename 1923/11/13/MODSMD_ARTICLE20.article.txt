# On the Four-Yard Line
## 
### 
Three minutes after the game started, the Cali
fornia freshmen had driven the Babes down the
field to a yard beyond the last white line. They had
four downs to make four yards.
On the fourth down the Red wall was still on
that four-yard line, and the Bears, thrown back by
the Stanford team, were beaten.
That fight under the shadow of the goal posts
marked the last swing of the pendulum. Thereafter
the freshmen of Encina hall had things their own
way. They had to throw the Bear Cubs back once
more, on their seven yard line, but the job was easy
compared to that first hard pull.
This being Stanford's year, the California drive
was stopped by men who had learned in six weeks
the lesson of Stanford spirit.
