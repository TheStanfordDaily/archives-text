S-h-li-h-h! Big plot afoot! Didja see the announce
ment that there would be a closed meeting of Lens and
Plate in the dark room soon?

Cabbages is here going to startle the educational
world! The attack we are launching on the old-fashioned
educational system will jar the launcher or the launchee
to its or his foundations. Did you ever see a big, husky
guy walk right up to a ten-story building and unmerci
fully kick it in the side? Effective, wasn't it? Well,
that's just how effective our attack on modern education
is going to be. Somebody is going to get hurt!
In the first place (we have never found out just where
this first place is, but it must be somewhere, probably
just across the way from "on the other hand") well, any
way, we think the whole system of mathematics is
fundamentally wrong. Take, for addition, subtraction.
The child is taught such problems as
89059
—41198
Now, to do this, first we take eight from nine, leaving
one. But this taking, no matter what it is, inculcated
in a child of tender years, is bound to lead to vicious
habits. Suppose he sees an elderly lady carrying a
bunch of bananas down the street. His prime impulse
will immediately be: "Take one —two—several." And
right before him he will have this mental example of
the classroom: take eight from nine and leave —in a
hurry.
To proceed: we cannot take nine from five, without
borrowing one from the n.ext figure. There you have it
again! Borrowing! Who does not hate a borrower?
Another vicious habit . . . alas, our roommate mu3t
have been a shark at mathematics at an early age . . .
I think we'd better drop this problem. Higher math
always was hard for us.

Anyway, education sure is in a hell of a mess. If you
don't believe it, come around and look at our law note
book some time.

Poor little co-ed! You, I mean, who weren't queened
any at all, at all, poor little girl. Cabbages extends his
heartiest congratulations—or, as we meant to say, con
dolences, and states that if you will leave your name
on the east side of the big oak in the center of the
cactus garden, he will start one of those rushes in your
direction which is so productive of the wriggling snake
and the red-ink entries in the date-book.
Only, however, if you will promise the following
things:
1. Never call up your escort at seven o'clock the
night of the date and tell him all about how many
troubles the family has been having, and you are so
sorry, but will Miss Blank do, she's such a sweet girl.. .
2. Write anything for the Daily about how feeble the
Stanford man's line is. Little lady, if you only knew
that all the flat tires in the University weren't on
bicycles . . . We admit that blowing up such a flat tire
is rather routine work, so what can you expect?
3. Promise that the rush of dates doesn't start a cor
responding rush of blood to the head, leading to partial
blindness, peculiarly to the gents who used to furnish
the "once-a-week" regular party. . . .
Little lady, if you could sign a pledge like the above,
and live up to it, we know you're a failure before you
start . . . you're too dang good for this campus.

Turning from this to more pleasant topics, Cabbages
would like to know when:
1. It will be possible for SOMEONE to put the frosh
on the boat in regard to the HELLO —we almost said
habit.
2. Ditto in regards to the dink.
3. Ditto in regards to queening on the Quad.
.. * * *
Cabbages doesn't like to kick, but he walked up to a
freshman on the Quad the other day, asked him to
cease conversation with the young lady, put on his dink,
and paddle on his way. "Go to Hell," was the succinct
rejoinder. We would have kicked the young gent loose
from his pants, but we didn't want to be jerked for
breaking rushing rules, or using harsh measures with
the tender young sprouts of twenty-seven.

A Compliment
"You play with so much feeling!
"You play with so much ease!"
"Thanks," said the modest pianiste,
"I'm feeling for the keys."

Ho, hum!
