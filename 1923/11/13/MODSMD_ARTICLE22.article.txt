"WHY WORRY," Stanford Theater, Palo Alto, now
playing.
Harold Lloyd at just a little below his best. It will be
a long time before he comes up to "Grandma's Boy"
pitch again, but nevertheless, his latest six-reeler has
many, many laughs tucked away in its celluloid heart.
If you are a devotee of the bespectacled comedian, you
might possibly recognize some of the "mechanics;" but
the old tricks are so few, and tucked so cozily away with
many news ones, that they do not protrude noticeably
Into attention.
Sam Turner, his stunt man, must either be a genius,
a darned hard worker, or a consistent violator of the
eighteenth amendment.
And as for Harold Lloyd's nurse —well, we only wish
we were sick in her hospital.
"YOUR FRIEND AND MINE," Varsity Theater, now
playing.
If you cannot get in to see Harold, and it's quite a
task at that, it is worth while seeing the excellent
acting In "Your Friend and Mine."
While we are at this critic business, we would like to
vary the usual method of greeting with a smile the
arriving picture, and take a flying kick at the back-end
of one just leaving. Honest-to-Allah, the world's worst
picture was here Sunday and Monday. Betty Blythe in
the "Darling of the Rich" was it Ham acting, ham
photography, terrible plot, if any. We merely refer you
to an unabridged "Webster Dictionary" for synonyms of
rotten ... be your own movie critic. —H. M.
