C. N. H. $
Scene: Meeting room of
the Board of Directors
of a large corporation.
The members are met to
transact some important
business â€”some very
important business.
The corpulent chairman's
salary is $25,000 per
annum. The others get
too much, also. They
fire up their cigars,
and the conclave is on.
First Director: "Yes, I
got in that damned
bunker just this side
of the water hazard . .
Second Director: "As I
say, I got this case of
bonded stuff for $100,
and believe me . .
Third Director: "Say, it
was a beauty! Took me
a half hour to land it;
weighed six pounds . .
Fourth Director: (Fill
this in yourself, and
so on for some of the
less vital issues of
the meeting).

Three inches of every pencil is
thrown away, two inches whittled
away and only the remaining two
inches of lead actually used, according
to a large pencil manufacturing com
pany. Pencil manufacturers say the
nation's annual pencil bill is more
than $50,000,000.
