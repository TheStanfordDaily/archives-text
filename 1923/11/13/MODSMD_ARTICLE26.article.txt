# AT 21 YEARS OF AGE
## Professor Treat of History Department Was Studying Law in New York Schools 
### 
At 21 years of age, Professor Payson
J. Treat, of the History department, was
studying law in the New York law school.
He had always intended to become a
lawyer and finished a year's work in the
school before suddenly changing his
mind. Professor Max Ferrand, profes
sor of history at Wesleyan, where Treat
took his undergraduate work, persuaded
him to take a position as history instruc
tor in Barnard Preparatory school, New
York. A year later, he came to Stanford
with Professor Farrand who became head
of the Stanford History department.
Treat graduated from Wesleyan Col
lege in Connecticut in 1000 at the age of
20. While there he edited the annual and
was student body treasurer. Parts of his
vacations were spent at the family sum
mer home on a Connecticut farm. One
summer he sold medical books to doctors,
having the usual experiences of the col
lege salesman.

While in college, Treat participated in
the annual intcrclass "scraps." Wes
•fyan had a freshman-sophomore fight on
Washington's birthday. The object of
contention was a Spanish War cannon
which the freshmen attempted to haul out
and fire in the face of opposition. To
avoid injuries this had to he done when
the sophomores were out of range.
Many sham and fake guns were con
structed by the first year men throughout
the year. These consisted of big logs
erected on wheels. The real gun was
concealed near the campus where it could
be quickly drawn out and fired at the
opportune time, when all of the sopho
mores were fighting over one of the de
coys.
Treat had each of the members of the
senior class tell in the year book what he
intended to do for a life work. Very
few of his classmates actually went into
the work they expected to follow.
