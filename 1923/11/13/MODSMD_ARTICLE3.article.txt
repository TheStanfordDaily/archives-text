# CARDS DROP 4-3 SOCCER CONTEST TO CALIFORNIA ELEVEN
## 
### 
In the most spectacular game staged
between the two institutions since the
war, the California varsity soccer team
defeated the Stanford eleven 4 to 3 at
Berkeley Saturday. Coming back
strong in the final moments of the
play the Cards scored two goals and
when the final whistle sounded had the
ball on the California goal line.
Going into the contest on the short
end of the dope the Stanford players
opened an attack which resulted in a
goal by Captain Bill Swayne five
minutes after the start but the Blue
and Gold forwards came back strong
and scored twice before the close of
the half. They kept the upper hand
after the start of the second period
aand ran the score to 4 to 1 before
Coach aloney's men could break up
their attack and start their closing
offensive.
The Stanford team played a
strong defensive game, great work
by the backs warding off many rushes
by the Berkeley forwards. In the mid
dle of the second half Mumford, Stan
ford's left full back, collided with
Hood of California and Mumford was
taken from the game with a bad gash
over one eye. His removal necessi
tated a switch in the Card line-up
but the now combination played strong
ball. Against the green Stanford play
ers was pitted the best combination
California has turned out in ten
years. Wong, star Chnese forward,
scored three of his teams goals while
Do Sousa at outside right was the
mainstay of the offense.
The crowd of six hundred tpeople
which witnessed the game were kept
on their toes throughout by the sen
sational play. Clean work featured the:
game all the way and penalties were
few. The varsity line-ups were:

The game between the frosh teams,
which preceded the varsity contest,
ended in a 1-to-l tie. The Cardinal
babes looked like the best team but
stage fright played havoc with their
teamwork and they missed a number
of easy tries. The Babes scored in the
first half when Miron shot the ball
into the net while the Cubs got theirs
in the same period on a penalty kick.
Forest at goal stood out above the
other freshmen for Stanford. Toward
the end of the game when the Cub
forwards were threatening he stopped
shot after shot and his steady work
helped to keep the whole team going
in tight places. Macaya and David at
fullback also helped to stop the Cali
fornia attack. Miron and West on the
right side of the forward line played
good soccer but the rest of the of
fense failed to live up to its work in
practice.
The California and Stanford teams

will meet again February 12 on the
local field. Next Saturday's game be
tween the varsity and the Barbarians
has been postponed on account of the
Idaho game.
