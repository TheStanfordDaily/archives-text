# CARD GRAYS PLAY BEAR RESERVES IN STADIUM THURSDAY
## 
### 
Coach "Mike" Reed will attempt to
take a second Bruin scalp when he
sends the Grays against the
California Reserves in the stadium
Thursday afternoon.
The Grays have the best material in
years. On the other hand, California
has needed all her reserve power on
the first team, leaving the two elevens
on a par for the first time in many
seasons.
The Card team is by this time fairly
well organized. Team work has de
veloped rather slowly because of the
fact that Kerr was playing as many of
the reserves as he could. They were
being used continuously against the
varsity for scrimmaging purposes, and
had little time to devote to the or
ganization, and fundamentals.
Men who were formerly on the-third
varsity will be eligible to play in the
Gray line-up. This means that the same
team which played and walloped Fort
Scott 74 to 3 a week ago will be put
on the field against the Bears.
The backfield is fast. Dwight and
Erhorn at half are both good ground
gainers, especially on end runs. Strat
ton, fullback, is a heavy line-plunger.
Kirwan is one of the best quarterbacks
on the campus, and if he is used in
this position Thursday he will be a
great asset to the team.
