# BABE ELEVEN WINS INTERCLASS SERIES
## 
### 
With an offensive attack that gained
through and around their opponents'
line nearly at will, the freshman in
terclass eleven defeated the sopho*
more gridders Saturday morning, 26
to 0, winning the interclass football
series.
At the same time, the senior squad
finished second by their Victory over
the juniors, 19 to 6.
The final standings of the teams
are:
W. L. T. Av. Points
Freshmen 2 0 1 I.ooo' 5
Seniors 2 1 0 .750 3
Juniors 11 1 .500 2
Sophomores 0 3 0 .000 1
The first two yearling touchdowns
came in the first quarter, Newkirk
scoring the first one on a screened
pass that completely outwitted the
sophomores. Riese went over for the
second six points after a series of end
runs. Pegram converted the first score
but Riese failed on the second.
Two minutes after the beginning of
the second half and following a num
ber of line bucks that forced the
sophomore line to give way, Hunt
picked a short pass out of the air and
raced thirty yards through a broken
field for the third touchdown.
Again in the fourth period, after an
exchange of punts, Harvey, yearling
left half, circled the second-year right
end and zig-zagged his way through
the latter's backfield for the last score.
At the same time that the babes
were trouncing the "last year's" a
hard-fought battle was in progress on
an adjacent field between the senior
and junior aggregations, who put for
ward the best interclass game of the
series. Both teams opened up with a
number of passes and displayed well
organized offensives.
The first senior touchdown was
made via the aerial route in the first
period—two passes, Clark to Kennedy
for twenty-five yards, and Coplen to
Beninger for eight yards—over the
goal. Coplen converted.
On the kick-off opening the second
half, Alexander made the most spec
tacular run of the morning—a ninety
yard break through a broken field for
the only junior score. They failed to
convert.
The second score for the fourth
year men was made in the third quar
ter by Coplen after a number of line
bucks, and the third came near the
close of the game when Griffith in
tercepted a pass for a forty-yard run
and touchdown.
Both elevens played an even game
with few breaks. When yardage was
made by either it was usually by a
pass or around end with good inter
ference.
Coplen and Wren accounted for
most of the senior gains. For the jun
iors, Jergins, McAllister, Alexander,
and Clark played a good game.
