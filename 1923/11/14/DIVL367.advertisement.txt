Floors-made beautiful
with pure linen
No matter how small or hamnm ymtAww "**OT
be, yon can give them new beauty purr Bmda
carpeting of Kkauflax.
Laid from wail to wail, Kfeaiflax gives spacious
dignity to the room- Padded well, it hushes all foot
steps. Its dose, tight weave makes it very easy to
dean, especially with the vacuum drainer, and with
no floor margins to bother with.
Think of your floors as one solid expanse of beanti
fal Klearflax color —rich single tones, or charming
Picwick mixtures! And remember, too, that in the
thick, heavy, reversible body of Klearflax is stored
the remarkable wear resistance for which linen is so
famous.
Other features could be mentioned —how moth
proof it is, or how its new linen roughness grow
smooth with use.
But, first, you should ste this unique floor covering.
We have a splendid assortment to show you. And
remember —the cost of Klearflax is very moderate
indeed.
