How Parker
Prevents Leaking
In Ways Other Pens Cannot Follow
%ead this—then try the new barker D. Q. made
for Students only, $3
GEO. S. PARKER entered the fountain pen business
31 years ago because he was able to discover the
two vital remedies for leaking. They are:
The Parker "Lucky Curve" feed, created and
patented by Mr. Parker, which induces capil
lary attraction, thus making a steady flow
while you're writing, and draining back the
unused ink when you're through.
The Parker "Duo-Sleeve" Cap which forms
an ink-tight seal with the barrel when kept
tightly screwed on.
These two engineering achievements are built in all
Parker pens regardless of price. The new Parker D. Q.
—the special pen made for students only—has, in addi
tion, an extra large ring to link to your note-book, or a
pocket-clip—either one included free. Also a metal girdle
that reinforces the cap.
It's produced by Parker Duofold craftsmen. Its point is 14k gold,
tipped with Native Iridium, polished to jewel-like smoothness. Mea
sured by all standards, it's far the finest pen value ever produced
under $5. You'll miss the newest thing out if you fail to ask for it.
