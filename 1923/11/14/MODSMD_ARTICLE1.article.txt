# ARTIST BRINGS TO LIFE PEOPLE OF DICKENS' STORIES
## Noted Characters of English Literature Interpreted By F. C. Thompson 
### 
Famous characters of literature
were brought to life yesterday eve
ning by Frank C. Thompson, of San
Francisco, who gave readings from a
number of Dickens' works, including
"Bleak House," "Our Mutual Friend,"
"David Copperfield," and "Pickwick
Papers."
Making his effects entirely without
atmospheric setting, Thompson suc
ceeded in presenting clear pictures of
the characters he represented. Al
though at times his words were indis
tinct, his tone and pantomine work
gave the audience the spirit of his in
terpretation. His transition work was
particularly effective, making distinct
the different parts in each scene.
"It was sometimes said that Dick
ens could not draw a gentleman, be
cause he took most of his characters
from the common people," said Thomp
son as an introduction to his reading
from Bleak House, of the personality
of Gentleman Turveydrop. "In Turvey
drop he gives us a true picture of the
English gentleman of his day."
One of the most sympathetic inter
preations of the program was that of
the mildly insane Barnaby Rudge.
The greater part of the characteriza
tions were made from David Copper
field. Mr. Creakle, Barkis, of "Barkis
is willing" fame, and the strong
minded and energetic Betsy Trotwood
were faithfully portrayed. Thompson's
rendition of the part of Uriah Heep,
presenting in lifelike way his cringing
manner and clammy hands, was one
of the best bits of work on the pro
gram.
The touching scene between David,
Ham, and Mr. Peggotty after the flight
of "little Emily" was given at the
suggestion of Professor R. M. Alden.
The dramatic possibilities of the
scene were nicely handled, and Thomp
son's next interpretation, that of the
character of Mrs. Micawber, was well
chosen as comedy relief.
