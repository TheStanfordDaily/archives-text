# BLOCK CIRCLE "S" WILL BE AWARDED TO POLO PLAYERS
## Intercollegiate Instead of Outside Competition to Be Letter Basis 
### 
A block circle "S" will be given to
those men (not more than six in num
ber) who play in intercollegiate com
petition in military horse polo and are
recommended by the military depart
ment, according to the decision of
the executive committee last flight.
When the question of a flfst class
aw2J4 fof military horse' polo was
presented year, the executive
committee decided that such an
award should be given for outside
competition. Intercollegiate competi-
tion was, at that time, very hard to
arrange, the nearest possible opponent
being Oregon Agricultural College.
This year, however, the military
department has succeeded in schedu
ling games with Oregon Agricultural
College, the University of Arizona,
and may have contests with Utah. A
Circle 'S" society asked that in the
future the polo award should be given
for intercollegiate competition, as is
the case with all other minor sports.
M. C. S. That the debate budget of
$200 for fall quarter be approved.
M. C. S. That the practice of writing
chalk notices on the Quad proper be
discontinued, and that the men's
council be instructed to take action
to prohibit such infringement in the
future.
No dates were granted.
