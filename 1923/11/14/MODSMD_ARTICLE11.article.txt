# BIG BUSINESS WILL BE DR. M'CALL'S SUBJECT

### 
Dr. Oswald W. S. McCall, chaplain
in the Australian army during the
Great War, will give his second cam
pus lecture, on 'Big Business and the
Blood of Men," tonight at 7:30 in the
Memorial Church.
Dr. McCall, who is pastor of the
First Congregational Church of Berke
ley, came here from Tasmania two
years ago. He was unknown, but mem
bers of the church heard him speak
and he was immediately called to the
pastorate. He is considered the most
brilliant pastor in this vicinity.
Dr. McCall will repeat in Londan,
by special request, the six addresses
which he is giving here. He has lec
tured in the English capital previous
