# IDAHO WILL PROVE STRONG OPPONENT FOR CARD SQUAD
## 
### 
When Stanford meets Idaho next
Saturday afternoon she will clash
with one of the strongest teams in
the Pacific Coast Conference. The
' light but fast Northern team has met
! more than one eleven this season, the
odds hopelessly against it, and gone
away the victor. Idaho has not lost
I one game on its schedule this season,
and with the exception of the tie with
Oregon two weeks ago, the scores
have shown it to be a coming team,
i Again the old problem of over-con
fidence is creeping in. Whether the
i Stanford eleven has had a touch of
this gridiron fever this season, or not,
| it is hard to say definitely. All that
we know is that the varsity is as sus
ceptible to the malady as any team.
In the U. S. C. game there were in
dications. But the defeat was not due
to overconfidence. U. S. C. got the
, breaks, and won a game which was by
every right, Stanford's. The Trojans'
victory served to counteract any spirit
of cockiness which might have crept
in, and the varsity stepped into tha
Olympic contest an entirely different
squad. At Oregon they played on a
widely-reputed slow sawdust field and
whipped the Webfooters 14 to 3.
Andy Kerr is not satisfied with that
Oregon victory. Stanford should have
had one, possibly two, more touch
downs.. That old fumble element is

always creeping in from nowhere to
spoil what might have been a com
plete triumph.
Stanford's chances for breaks in the
Idaho contest may or may not be
forthcoming. The Northerners' line is
lighter, but their punter has been
trained to get the kicks away accord
ingly. One of the Oregon scores was
made on a blocked kick by Shipkey.
It sounds nice, but when thrashed out
it seems an absurdity for any team to
depend on that particular break to
occur regularly. Better to figure the
victory on what Stanford accom
plished with straight football.
It comes as an enjoyable surprise
to hear that the Cards can now look
for an opening in the forward pass of
fensive. That something which has al
ways been lacking with the Stanford
forward pass, Andy Kerr has evidently
eradicated.
A hard week of practice is coming
to the varsity squad, especially in for
ward pass defense. The Idaho team
has an uncanny reputation of break
ing up games via the aerial route. The
ends will have to play their best game
to stop Wayne Davis, the fleety Idaho
halfback, who constitutes the Oregon
open field offensive. Reports have it
that Davis has been declared ineligi
ble. but it is not definite enough to
create excitement

Oregon two weeks ago, the scores
have shown it to be a coming team,
i Again the old problem of over-con
fidence is creeping in. Whether the
i Stanford eleven has had a touch of
this gridiron fever this season, or not,
| it is hard to say definitely. All that
we know is that the varsity is as sus
ceptible to the malady as any team.
In the U. S. C. game there were in
dications. But the defeat was not due
to overconfidence. U. S. C. got the
, breaks, and won a game which was by
every right, Stanford's. The Trojans'
victory served to counteract any spirit
of cockiness which might have crept
in, and the varsity stepped into tha
Olympic contest an entirely different
squad. At Oregon they played on a
widely-reputed slow sawdust field and
whipped the Webfooters 14 to 3.
Andy Kerr is not satisfied with that
Oregon victory. Stanford should have
had one, possibly two, more touch
downs.. That old fumble element is

always creeping in from nowhere to
spoil what might have been a com
plete triumph.
Stanford's chances for breaks in the
Idaho contest may or may not be
forthcoming. The Northerners' line is
lighter, but their punter has been
trained to get the kicks away accord
ingly. One of the Oregon scores was
made on a blocked kick by Shipkey.
It sounds nice, but when thrashed out
it seems an absurdity for any team to
depend on that particular break to
occur regularly. Better to figure the
victory on what Stanford accom
plished with straight football.
It comes as an enjoyable surprise
to hear that the Cards can now look
for an opening in the forward pass of
fensive. That something which has al
ways been lacking with the Stanford
forward pass, Andy Kerr has evidently
eradicated.
A hard week of practice is coming
to the varsity squad, especially in for
ward pass defense. The Idaho team
has an uncanny reputation of break
ing up games via the aerial route. The
ends will have to play their best game
to stop Wayne Davis, the fleety Idaho
halfback, who constitutes the Oregon
open field offensive. Reports have it
that Davis has been declared ineligi
ble. but it is not definite enough to
create excitement
When Stanford meets Idaho next
Saturday afternoon she will clash
with one of the strongest teams in
the Pacific Coast Conference. The
' light but fast Northern team has met

odds hopelessly against it, and gone
