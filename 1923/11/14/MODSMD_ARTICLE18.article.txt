# CARDINAL GRAYS MEET BEAR GOOF TEAM TOMORROW
## Squads Clash in Annual Game On Even Basis for First Time in Several Years 
### David Meiklejohn 
Coach "Mike" Reed's Stanford Grays
meet the California Reserves tomor
row in the stadium at 4:30. the first
Gray team in many years which has
met the Bears on an even basis.
Last year the Blue and Gold wal
loped the "Red" Bett's Gray team, 18
to 0. The Cards this year are in many
ways superior to last season's eleven.
It is a pleasure to watch the offensive
in play, and know that it is backed by
a strong defense. This season's contest
promises to turn out to be one of the
fastest games played in the stadium.
The Stanford men know football —an
exceptional thing for a "Goof" team.
"Porky" Dwight is easily the most
dependable ground-gainer. On end
runs and off-tackle plays Dwight in
variably will break away for a neat
gain. In the Fort Scott contest he
scored most of the touchdowns.
Fuller at end has shown marked
ability in getting down under punts
and snagging passes this year.
The fundamentals of the game have
be<en drilled into the squad through
out the season with frequent scrim
mages against the varsity. As the
"goats" of Andy Kerr's eleven they
have shown themselves to be a for
midable aggregation. This week's prac
tice has consisted mostly of signal
workouts, light scrimmage with the
freshman and varsity squads, and
blackboard talks on plays.
The Gray schedule has been broken
into continually, and postponement of
many games has left the team lacking
in much of the experience they other
wise would have received.
Against the Mare Island Marines
the team was woefully weak. There
was a punch lacking somewhere in
the ranks, due probably to inexperi
ence. The 27-to-0 victory of Stanford
over the Sailors was no indication of
the real strength of the squad.
Fort Scott met the Grays, confident
of victory, and trailed off the campus
with the short end of a 74-to-3 score.
The Grays offensive consists almost
entirely of end runs, and off-tackle
plays. Should they attempt to forward
pass, or criss-cross, or use any trick
plays, the results might prove dis
astrous.

dependable ground-gainer. On end
runs and off-tackle plays Dwight in
variably will break away for a neat
gain. In the Fort Scott contest he
scored most of the touchdowns.
Fuller at end has shown marked
ability in getting down under punts
and snagging passes this year.
The fundamentals of the game have
be<en drilled into the squad through
out the season with frequent scrim
mages against the varsity. As the
"goats" of Andy Kerr's eleven they
have shown themselves to be a for
midable aggregation. This week's prac
tice has consisted mostly of signal
workouts, light scrimmage with the
freshman and varsity squads, and
blackboard talks on plays.
The Gray schedule has been broken
into continually, and postponement of
many games has left the team lacking
in much of the experience they other
wise would have received.
Against the Mare Island Marines
the team was woefully weak. There
was a punch lacking somewhere in
the ranks, due probably to inexperi
ence. The 27-to-0 victory of Stanford
over the Sailors was no indication of
the real strength of the squad.
Fort Scott met the Grays, confident
of victory, and trailed off the campus
with the short end of a 74-to-3 score.
The Grays offensive consists almost
entirely of end runs, and off-tackle
plays. Should they attempt to forward
pass, or criss-cross, or use any trick
plays, the results might prove dis
astrous.
