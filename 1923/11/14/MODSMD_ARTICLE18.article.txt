# CARDINAL GRAYS MEET BEAR GOOF TEAM TOMORROW
## Squads Clash in Annual Game On Even Basis for First Time in Several Years

Coach "Mike" Reed's Stanford Grays
meet the California Reserves tomor
row in the stadium at 4:30. the first
Gray team in many years which has
met the Bears on an even basis.
Last year the Blue and Gold wal

"Porky" Dwight is easily the most
dependable ground-gainer. On end

gain. In the Fort Scott contest he
scored most of the touchdowns.
Fuller at end has shown marked
ability in getting down under punts
and snagging passes this year.

out the season with frequent scrim
mages against the varsity. As the
"goats" of Andy Kerr's eleven they
have shown themselves to be a for

freshman and varsity squads, and
