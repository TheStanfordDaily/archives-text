# FAIRY TALE CARDS BRIGHTEN PARTY AT CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
Little Red Riding Hood is over at
the Stanford Convalescent Home.
Jack-Be-Nimble, Little 80-Peep, the
Old Lady Who Lived in the Shoe, and
Humpty-Dumpty are there with her.
They were by far the most favored
guests at the birthday party Saturday
of Daniel Errigan, who had achieved
13 years of age. They looked as though
they might step right down from the
walls of the ward any minute, for
they were almost as big as life and
their dresses were of the brightest
and prettiest colors. And the jolly
Jack-o'-Lanterns winked and blinked
from the corners, as though they had
never seen such fun.
Twenty children are living at the
Convalescent Home this winter. This
was just about the right number for
each one to have his favorite Fairy-
Tale-Come-to-Life beside his cot.
All of which explains why the or
chestra at the Roble dance Friday
night played dee-dee-dum and the
leader asked, "Will the guests please
leave the fairy tale posters on the
walls? They are to be taken to the
Convalescent Home."
