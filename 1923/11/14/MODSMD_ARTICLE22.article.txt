# "Ties That Bind"

### 
Spectators at the Stanford-California freshman
game in the stadium Saturday saw several unusual
things. *In the first place, they saw the Bear Cubs
bow to the Cardinal yearlings in American football
for the first time since 1904.
While the rival freshman teams were playing one
of the hardest-fought games in years, on the turf
below, the rooting sections were passing bouquets
back and forth in a most pleasing manner.
First quarter reports from the north and south
showed both Stanford and California leading- by
seven points. When the yell leaders announced the
results to both sides of the stadium, it was hard to
tell which was the Stanford and which the California
rooting section. Both announcements were greeted
with loud outbursts from both sides and both sec
tions yelled for the Cardinal and Blue and Gold
varsities.
More results at half and three quarter time had
the same reaction. The fact that their freshmen
were losing 1 did not dampen the enthusiasm of the
Blue and Gold rooters when yelling for the Card
eleven and the Stanford supporters returned the
compliment with a vengeance.
Altogether, it was just the kind of an exhibition
which might have been expected. Stanford and Cali
fornia are traditional rivals but the bond of friend
ship between the two institutions is one which will
probably never again be severed.
It is just the kind of feeling which was evident
Saturday that makes it safe for a blue and gold hat
in Palo Alto and a red one in Berkeley. The two
institutions cannot risk their good names by indulg
ing in foolish horse-play which would lead to noth
ing but trouble. â€”D. E. L.
