# Geniuses For One Quarter
## 
### 
There is an undercurrent of resentment in every
class, sometimes almost amounting to a rip tide,
against those students who are able to get good
grades, without study, because of some magical gift
of intuition during examinations, while other stu
dents are forced to drive and grind hours on end
before their brains will hold the necessary informa
tion.
To some this seems a crying injustice, to others,
it is a symbol of real democracy. In a classroom
the students whose natural faculty for writing a
good examination is limited 1 are given a chance by
the use of another faculty—that of perseverance—
to overcome their handicap and take their place with
the most effulgent of geniuses. The trouble is that
too many assume themselves to be in the genius
class, and hold persistently to the notion until the
scholarship committee requests them to leave college.
The heroic defense of the freshman bonfire calls
to memory a similar occurrence three years ago.
The freshman class was turned out of bed to quell
a reported "California raid" and douse the begin
nings of a conflagration.
After the excitement had died some of the fresh
men returning to interrupted slumber overheard
this from a party of sophomores: "Well, I guess we
woke 'em up some. 11l bet they'll guard the thing
more carefully now."
