# SOB ON MILLY'S SHOULDER

### 
Dear Milly:
We hot hcame to Stanford in joy, filled with bliss,
And we sealed our love with a bashful kiss;
We pictured the days, that we'd spend all alone,
When studies were done, and knowledge was sowr.
Then one day she passed with her head rather high,
With a look, which I thought like a fool, was a lie;
She liked to play stubborn, that much I knew,
But my blood turned ice at her 'How-dee-you-u do!"
She is one of five-hundred in the realm of the blest,
Five hundred supreme, for snobbery their crest.
Too good for the Rough; the Stanford barbarian;
Their head in the air. The thought of such carrion'
How shall I die? —A. Flop.
O Flop your words do me astound,
They have mee all wound 'round,
My advice to such a woeful clout,
Is learn the motto: "Throw 'em out!" —Milly.
* * *
The Campanile tolls the knell of day;.
Each note resounds upon the Berkeley air;
The Bruin homeward plods his weary way,
And thinks of Big Game chances with despair.
Then comes a voice from far across the bay,
Which ghostly renders in a trumpet blare,
A hope, where once despair held tyrant sway,
O Brick, 'tis you! O Morse, still are you there!
Out past the sparsely wooded Berkeley hills,
Out past the blue and gleaming inland sea,
Until at last on shore its rumble thrills,
"A chance! A break! A moral victory!"
EPITAPH
Here sits Brick Morse, upon the lap of fame,
A scribe to many freshmen still unknown;
Fair Reason smiles not from his famous name
Though Berkeley marks him for her very own.
i
No further seek his wisdom to disclose,
Or bring his forecasts from the moral poise;
He gave to Stanford but a bloody nose;
He gained for Berkeley what she needs, a noise.
—Melancholy Moron.
