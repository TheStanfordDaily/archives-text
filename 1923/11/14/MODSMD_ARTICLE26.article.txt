Stanford would be a wonderful place if people wotild
mind their own business!
This has been said over and over again. AJI any one
seems to do in his spare time is to talk. He talks
about everything and everybody. No one is exempt.
Of course most of the gossip is not malicious, but little
things said unintentionally grow and become exagger
ated as they are repeated, sometimes causing a great
deal of harm. It is not only unfair to the person of
whom the remark was made (such remarks are known
to have ruined college careers) but it is unfair to
everyone.
There are two types of talk —the harmful and the
harmless. The slanderous remarks made by the men
on the campus about the women are the best examples
of the first type. They show an utter lack of respect
on the part of the men for the women students. If some
men cannot find something true to say about the latter,
it hurts their consciences not a bit to invent something
and broadcast it on the campus. They talk over every
woman as if she were a curiosity, and razz her to death
on general principles.
Then, there is that habit which everyone has of know
ing what every one else is doing. No one can make a
move without the entire campus learning of it. Many
people object to this. They feel that their business ia
their own and that no one else has a right to talk
about it.
It seems too bad that in such a wonderful place as
Stanford, a person's spare time should be spent in dis
cussing one's classmates, and although they do not
know it —ruining reputations and causing trouble. This
habit tends towards smallness and only causes outside
people to think a university's students narrow-minded.
If there would be less talk on the campus, a great
deal of unhappineBs would be avoided.
