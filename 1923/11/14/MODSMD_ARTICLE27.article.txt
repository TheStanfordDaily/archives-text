# Under the Sun

C. N. H.
Traffic was jammed
for five blocks
in the city's
busiest section;
policemen swore,
horns snorted
with rage, bells
clanged, exhaust
smoke and anathema
rose from the
confusion, and
a call was sent in
for the reserves.
Midway betwixt corners
was the source of
the trouble â€”a huge
maelstrom of curious,
pushing, perspiring
pedestrians, all
struggling to see
into the vortex,
where one small
kitten was keeping
one big dog at a
respectful distance.
