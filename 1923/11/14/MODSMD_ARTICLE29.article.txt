### 
All undestroyed copies of the famous
Los Angeles Times pictures of the
91st division in France have been re
ceived at the Hoover War library.
They are the gift of Harry Chandler,
recently appointed Stanford trustee
and manager of the Times. Harry A.
Williams was the Times photographer.
One of the most vividly expressive
pictures bears this caption: "Ninety
first Division troops at morning mess
near Verdun after an all-night march
from the front. They had been with
drawn after twelve days in the Ar
gonne-Meuse offensive in which they
had attained their objective. Arriving
at this spot after their all-night march
in a driving rain, the men threw them
selves down in the mud and slept
peacefull and with no ill effects."
