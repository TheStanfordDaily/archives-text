# ANDY KERR NAMED SPEAKER AT LAKE RALLY TOMORROW
## Torches, Fireworks, to Cast Reflections on Meeting 
### 
Coach Andy Kerr will speak.
The Stanford Band will play
Fireworks will be fired.
Torches will flare.
Shouting will be indulged in.
There we have the program as ar
ranged to date for the torch-light
rally to be held at Lagunita tomorrow
evening at 7.15.
Something for everybody will be
the keynote of the affair. The only
persons who will be strictly out of
luck are those who pine for canoeing
and swimming. Under present condi
tions, no water sports will be attempt
ed, it is announced.
The main idea of the rally is to get
the Idaho game off to a flying start.
Also, the ball will be started rolling
for a game scheduled for November
24. It is believed that this latter con
test should create quite a bit of inter
est among the students. Anyone wish
ing to know with whom the game will
be played will be supplied with the in
formation free of charge at Thurs
day's gathering.
Further and final details of the
brawl will be announced tomorrow,
according to Burt Lapp, yell leader.
Arrangements have been perfected
for handling quite a large crowd, he
stated today. Rooters are requested
not to wreck the boat house, and to
tear out no more pine trees than
necessary.
