# ZIMBALIST IS PUPIL OF RUSSIAN MASTER
## 
### 
Efrem Zimbalist, who will give a
violin concert in the Assembly hall to
morrow evening, is a pupil of Profes
sor Auer, the "master of master" vio
linists.
When Professor Auer was master
instructor of the violin at the Imperial
Conservatory of Petrograd, Zimbalist's
father, a noted conductor of opera and
orchestra at Rostov-on-Don, sent the
young violinist to study under him. It
was through his influence that Jascha
Heifetz, virtuoso, was admitted to the
Conservatory.
During the revolution in Russia,
Professor Auer escaped with his vio
lins and some of his music and came
to America, where he was met by his
former pupils, Zimbalist and Heifetz,
now wealthy, and eager to help him.
In Petrograd, while a pupil of Pro
fessor Auer, Zimbalist often disap
peared to the seclusion of outlying
estates, where he had permission to
practice alone in the gardens. Zimba
list now has a home on Fisher's Island,
where he keeps up his out-of-door
practice. "There is no more delightful
place in which to play the violin than
a garden or a forest," says Zimbalist.
