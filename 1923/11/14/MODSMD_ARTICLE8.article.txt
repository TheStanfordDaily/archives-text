# CAST OF 'CAPTAIN APPLEJACK' TO BE CHOSEN TONIGHT
## Play Selected by Sophomores Is Recent London and New York Success 
### 
"Captain Applejack, An Arabian 1
Nights Adventure," by Walter Hack
ett, has been chosen by the sopho
mores to be the next dramatic offer
ing on the Asembly hall stage. A final
tryout and the first rehearsal will be j
held tonight.
This play is one of the recent Lon
don and New York productions and is
at present being shown in moving pic-1
ture houses all over the country. It
first appeared in London where a two
years' run was experienced before its
popularity began to wane.
While still on in London all the 1
American producers tried to get the
production rights for this country, j
Walter Eddinger was the one to suc
ceed. By some mysterious coup he ob
tained the rights from the English
owner and started rehearsals in New
York with himself in the leading role
In tljis production Marian Ash took the
fem&le head, and the show lasted over
a year on Broadway. Tickets were
sold weeks in advance and the maga
zines were filled with gratuitous pub
licity.
Stanford also executed a singular
coup in getting the play for the sopho
mores. For over a year Coach Davis
had it in mind as an excellent campus
production. On his trip to the Orient
he was in the same company with
Miss Adele Blood, the leading woman
and star of "Everywoman." Through
his friendship with her he got permis
sion from Sam Harris, the owner, to
put it on here. It is a certainty, he
says, that no other college is able to
secure it.
The scene of the action is in a lone
ly old country place on the shores of
Cornwall. It is the home of a direct
descendent of Captain Applejack, an
old pirate who buried his treasure
somewhere in the house. Into the
house at night come Anna, a Russian
vampire, the villain Borolosky, and a
troop of mysterious visitors. The
treasure hunt keeps everyone in a
state of nervous expectancy.
A.flashback (in the order of a movie)
shows the old pirate ship with Cap
tain Applejack in command. The set
ting of this is colorful and spectacular.
An exciting denouement brings things
to the proper .end.
The following are to appear at the
Assembly hall tonight for the rehear
sal-tryout. A few others will be noti
fied to take minor parts.
Alfrida Poco, Peggy Lee, Patrice
Nauman, Aileen Burks, Adelaide
Kelly, Marjorie Allen, Rhoda Lewis,
A. Grove Day, Kenneth Chantry, Stan

zier, John Deffebach, Lloyd Nolan, j

first appeared in London where a two
years' run was experienced before its
popularity began to wane.
While still on in London all the 1
American producers tried to get the
production rights for this country, j
Walter Eddinger was the one to suc
ceed. By some mysterious coup he ob
tained the rights from the English
owner and started rehearsals in New
York with himself in the leading role
In tljis production Marian Ash took the
fem&le head, and the show lasted over
a year on Broadway. Tickets were
sold weeks in advance and the maga
zines were filled with gratuitous pub
licity.
Stanford also executed a singular
coup in getting the play for the sopho
mores. For over a year Coach Davis
had it in mind as an excellent campus
production. On his trip to the Orient
he was in the same company with
Miss Adele Blood, the leading woman
and star of "Everywoman." Through
his friendship with her he got permis
sion from Sam Harris, the owner, to
put it on here. It is a certainty, he
says, that no other college is able to
secure it.
The scene of the action is in a lone
ly old country place on the shores of
Cornwall. It is the home of a direct
descendent of Captain Applejack, an
old pirate who buried his treasure
somewhere in the house. Into the
house at night come Anna, a Russian
vampire, the villain Borolosky, and a
troop of mysterious visitors. The
treasure hunt keeps everyone in a
state of nervous expectancy.
A.flashback (in the order of a movie)
shows the old pirate ship with Cap
tain Applejack in command. The set
ting of this is colorful and spectacular.
An exciting denouement brings things
to the proper .end.

sal-tryout. A few others will be noti
fied to take minor parts.
