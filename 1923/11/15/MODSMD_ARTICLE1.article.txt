roles in "He Who Gets Slapped" and
"Will Shakespeare" last year.
Lloyd Nolan, who has the lead as

A Tale of Pirates and Bolsheviki
"Captain Applejack" is a rollicking
romantic play of sedate old England
and a pirate ship in the South Seas.
Ambrose Applejack, the English
hero, is so bored by monotonous com
forts that he advertises his home for
sale and quixotically determines to
seek romance and adventure abroad.
Aileene Burks as Anna Valeska
makes her first entrance from "the
black night" with a wild tale of fleeing
with some of the Russian crown jewels
from the terrible bolshevist, Boro
losky.
Marjorie Allen, playing the woman's
lead, Poppy Faire, Ambrose's ward,
has loved the hero all the time and
admits it, to the satisfaction of both.
