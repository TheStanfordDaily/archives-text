## 
### 
'I he success of the sponsor system as es
tablished this year at Stanford was an
important factor in the adoption of a res
olution by the Pacific Students' Presi
j dents' association for the elimination of
all hazing of freshmen, according to A1
Master's A. S. S. U. president.
"I outlined the sponsor system, and
told of its success from all angles," says
Masters. "The association was at once
impressed with the plan."
The resolution against hazing was
passed unanimously. It reads : "Whereas,
We, the members of the Pacific Students'
Presidents' association believe that more
good to our universities can be accom
plished by an appeal to the college loyalty
of our freshmen than by hazing or by the
use of strong arm methods,
"Therefore, be it resolved that the P.
S. P. A. go on record as opposing all
hazing of freshmen anH opposing the
handling of freshman discipline by the
sophomore class."
When the subject of freshman disci

pline was opened by William Monolian,
of California, president of the association.
Masters was called on first. His talk 011
Stanford's sponsor system was heard with
immediate interest.
"The adoption of the resolution means
that each student body president will go
back to his university on record against
hazing," says Masters.
"All of the universities represented at
the association were leaning toward the
abolition of hazing, although none have
gone as far as Stanford in this direction."
California, according to President
Monahan, lias abolished all "horse-play"
in dealing with freshmen, having only
one day of intcrclass fights. The Univer
sity of British Columbia has also done
away with hazing.
Sam Mullin, president from the Uni
versity of Washington, suggested that
the association work against the disci
plining of first year men in fraternities,
and he told of how it had been success
fully abolished in his house.
