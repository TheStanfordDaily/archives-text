"You can't keep order in your own !

"Nothing will hinder China more
greatly in the solution of her problems of
government than intervention by Euro
pean countries," said J. G. Maytin, in
structor in citizenship, when he addressed
the Stanford Student Forum on the sub
ject "Shall China Govern Herself?" last 1
night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Maytin, who was a resident of China
and Manchuria for fifteen years and who!
is an authority on conditions in the i
Chinese republic, pointed out that China 1
has been awakened and is now passing ■
through a transition period.
"We forget when considering the sit- '
uation in China that it took the United !
States fourteen years to frame a stable!
government," said Maytin. "Why then j
should we expect China, a country with j
far more difficult problems to deal with j
than the United States had in its first j
years, to have already solved its problems j
when it is only twelve years since the j
revolution that made China a republic?"
