# "WE PLACE DOLLARS ABOVE HUMAN LIFE," STATES DR. McCALL
## Big Business Is Doomed as World Power if Circle of War Continues 
### 
"Big business will cease to dominate
j the world if it continues its vicious circle
I of wars.
"I question the right of any nation to
provide for its own people by depriving
! weaker countries of their necessary re
| sources."
Dr. Oswald W. S. McCall thus indicted
! the present policy of national greed in
i the world in his third campus lecture on
! "Big Business and the Blood of men,"
j in Memorial church last night.
"No outrage in Belgium, no sinking of
the Lusitania, was sufficient to bring the
! United States into the World War," said
Dr. McCall. "But when the German sub
l marine menaced our commerce, we took
I notice. When Uncle Sam had his pockct
i picked he got up and hit Germany in the
| eye. Today we look down 011 hopelessly
entangled Europe. But we are virtuous
; because we arc detached from their in
j terests."
The opiate which we usually offer to
I our conscience is that the people must
; have adequate martial protection for their
, property, said McCall. Therefore war is
i largely a business proposition.
"Necessity is the most effective moral
j anodyne, it is the answer to all criticisms
of the present system. There is military,
I economic, and biological necessity. If
! there are deeper hells to be digged potent
| spades will be provided by this means."
| McCall paid tribute to the millions of
j men who went into the war with a real
spirit of sacrifice. Idealism is largely a
matter of the common people, he believes.
"I wish it understood that I cast no
reflection upon those who gave themselves
with a clean purpose to the great adven
ture," explained McCall.
