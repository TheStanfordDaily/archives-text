# "Lost Millennium" to Be Subject of Dr. Jordan's Thursday Evening Talk
## 
### 
With the "golden age" before the
war as his subject, Dr. Jordan will
discuss "The Lost Millenium" in the
Thursday evening conference at his
home tonight at 7:30.
Dr. Jordan believes that the period
before the war was the nearest that
the countries of the war have come to
a golden age. Science, chemistry, and
medicine were at the height of their
development, at this time. Knowledge
learned in one country was immedi
ately communicated to the other coun
tries. Men were trying to save lives
and the death rate was lower than it
has ever been before or after.
During the war millions of lives
were lost. The feeling of brothership
has been forgotten and the world has
retrogressed in respect to civilization.
The talk will be an after-Armistice
Day lesson, according to Dr. Jordan.
Students and faculty are invited.
