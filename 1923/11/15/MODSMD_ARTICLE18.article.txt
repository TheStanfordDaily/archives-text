# RESERVE STRENGTH OF CARD VARSITY WILL PROVE IDAHO'S BIGGEST HANDICAP SATURDAY
## Stanford Outweighs Light Vandal Squad Six Pounds to the Man; Team in Good Condition 
### 
Stanford's aggregation of A-1 substitutes, by far the strongest on the Coast,
will have a great deal to say in the Idaho game Saturday.
Twenty-two men, of whom only three or four loom as superior, will probably
see action against the fast Vandal team, and unless Idaho has an eleven which
can capably counteract this evident advantage, she will be somewhat handi
capped.
The heaviest team Idaho can place on the field will weigh but 176 pounds.
The heaviest line, taking players, substitutes, and regulars at random, averages
181 pounds. The beefiest backfteld that can be gleaned tips the scales at only
168 pounds. Stanford on the line outweighs the Vandals six pounds to the
man; in the backfield nine pounds.
Oregon sport writers are calling the Stanford varsity a red juggernaut, a
veritable human rolling tank, and other pleasing-to-the-ear expressions which

? listen well, but which must be taken
with the proverbial grain of salt.
Ernie Nevers is getting faster, is
hitting the line lower, and is putting
more steam into his kicks.
A picture in the "Oregonian," Port
j laud morning newspaper, shows Nev
ers, his nose almost touching the
ground, breaking through the Web
foot line for a gain. Nevers carried
the ball steadily against Oregon, and
each buck put Stanford further ahead.
Campbell Dependable Safety
"Scotchy" Campbell is by no means
wasting his ability as an open field run
ner in his position as safety man. No one
on the varsity squad is more dependable
for returning punts than the Card cap
tain. In the Oregon contest he returned
kicks for a total of 128 yards, dodging,
squirming, and straight arming opponents
in a method which has not been seen in
Portland since the days of Bill Steers,
i wh . starred several years ago for the
Web footers. Campbell's field-generalship
ability is unquestionable, and as long as
Andy Kerr has such a reliable squad of
substitute half backs, there is no reason
for shifting "Scotch" to halfback.
With the exception of the U. S. C. con
test, there is no game this year in which
the Cards have not scored on or profited
by a blocked punt. Blocking punts has
l>ccome a popular outdoor sport with the
varsity this year.
Blocked Punts Popular
Itâ€žhas been done so consistently this
quarter that it ceases to be simply a mat
ter of luck. It emphasizes a strength in
the line which bids well to prove a snag
for any opposing team.
Kerr has been conducting secret prac
tice in the stadium this week. Some sly
scribe announced in one of the San Fran
cisco papers that Andy Kerr had devel
oped a series of new plays, and even went
so far as to explain what some of them
were. Rather than take any chances on
knot-hole leaks, Andy has moved to the
closely guarded stadium field to conduct
practice in preparation for the Idaho
game.
