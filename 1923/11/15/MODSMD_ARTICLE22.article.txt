# Stanford Leads The Way
## 
### 
Student body presidents of Pacific Coast colleges
are now telling their various campuses of a new
plan in which Stanford is used as the standard.
That plan is the sponsor system, which was in
augurated among Coast colleges when Stanford
adopted it last year.
The scheme was explained to the assembled stu
dent body executives in session at Los Angeles last
week, and this was the result: the student leaders of
every college on the Coast went on record in a
unanimous resolution as favoring adoption of the
, ...
system in their own universities.
Stanford already has the reputation of leading
the way in student body progress. It was one of
the first to adopt the honor system, now in effect
in all but five Western colleges; the Stanford mass
athletics plan is considered one of the greatest ad
vances in undergraduate sport activities in the coun
try ; the Stanford "hello" and Stanford democracy
is the standard of campus conduct in almost every
Coast university.
When all Pacific Coast colleges abandon anti
quated "discipline" methods Stanford men can point
to their own campus as the leader in regulation by
sponsor control.
