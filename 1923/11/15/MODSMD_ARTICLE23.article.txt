Efretn Zimbalist, one of the few great violinists
of the world, who will appear in the Assembly hall
this evening, brings opportunity to the very door of
Stanford music-lovers. Those fortunately possessing
an appreciation of the finer things of life will enjoy
the touch of Zimbalist as he weaves together rare
harmonies of music. To those students who have
come here for an education Zimbalist offers for their
benefit the work of a master.
Last year 10,000 people crowded the Oakland
Auditorium to hear Zimbalist, and a capacity house
is promised for this evening's concert.
The student representation will not be large. It
would not be running true to the collegiate order of
things to have a chance to hear a master musician
noticeably lessen the attendance of those finding
mid-week recreation in the mirth-provoking antics
of a popular film comedian.
Philosophers arc fond of remarking on the un
satisfactory feeling of a vain regret. And so when
the undergraduate has left college and can look
back on his years of education it seems unfortunate
that perchance he should harbor a vain regret for
neglected opportunities. —R. E.

the fact that no dinks were worn in 1896.
