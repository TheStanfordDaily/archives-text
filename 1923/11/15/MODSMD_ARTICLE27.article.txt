# THE 						AISLE SEAT

### 
"THE FRENCH DOLL." Varsity Theater, now playing.
We have just about worn the leather (genuine imita
tion grain, bound in red, guaranteed-not-to-fade leather)
off the Aisle Seat looking at pictures this quarter. We
suspect that one of our law profs, has also been pre
paring his recitation at the movies this quarter, and we
are certain, after just having received back an examina
tion in the course, that the corrector has been at the
movies correcting papers there. And just before he
reached our paper he went and saw some bum movie
that put him in an awful, awful frame of mind.
All of which may seem a long way from the "French
Doll," but what we were about to say was, that if he
had just seen the "French Doll" we would have gotten
a better mark (assuming, of course, which seems likely,
that he does correct papers at the movies).
Some actresses are born great, some achieve great
ness, and others take off as many clothes as is legal and
act in French pictures. This latter is Mae Murray.
If the ordinary life afforded a woman as many chances
to change costumes and whirl around over a sea of
champagne bottles in New York, Paris, and Palm Beach,
as the plot does Miss Murray in her recent picture, the
average woman would either have deliriums within a
month or be so completely tired that she would never
want to see a bottle again, or a new dress, either, for
that matter. Well, that's the way the picture affected us
. . . it's just a little too too, as it were. Lots of pep, and
little brains; much money and little acting spent in
making "The French Doll." Result, a jazz picture which
will grate on nerves jazz-tired, but for others is delight
ful. —H. M.
