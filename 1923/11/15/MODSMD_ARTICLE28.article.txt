# Under the Sun

For months a noted
motion picture
director who had
long and faithfully
served hokum to the
appreciative public
had secretly planned
an artistic production
that would raise the
plane of the silent
drama to a hitherto
unattained peak.
Pictures had "played
down" to their
audiences for too
long. The people were
ready for finer things.
One evening he passed
by a crowded popular
music shop. A card
in the window read:
The Latest Song Hit â€”
"You Gotta Kiss Your
Sweetie Awful Nice"
(Or you can't kiss
your sweetie at all)
Over 300,000 Copies
Sold In Two Weeks.
Get Yours Now!
The director bow>ed
his head, and bleak
despair smote him.
