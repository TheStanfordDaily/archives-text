# Turtle Doves Double For Old Alarm Clock
## 
### 
The occupants of the third floor "B"
wing in Roble Hall have established
an enviable attendance record at
breakfast. There's a reason. They have
the most efficient alarm clock in ex
istence. It is human, but far from di
vine. Every morning at 6 o'clock the
cooing of two turtle doves who roost

on a certain window sill is audible and
insistent.
It continues indefinitely until every
one is forced to rise—sleep being im
possible—with murder in their hearts
and hunger in their "Innards" and
sally forth to breakfast. This is one
time when the cooing of turtle doves
does not have the generally accepted
romantic effect. In fact, it's far from
soothing, although it does yield ma
terial benefits.
