# Torchlight Parade For Rally Starts At Seven o'Clock
## 
### David Lamson 
If you have cheers, prepare to spill
them now.
The torchlight parade and rally at
Lagunita this evening is the main
event, and rooters are expected to turn
out in full force both to enjoy life as
it is lived and to make a loud noise
before the game.
A special consignment of fireworks
has been sent from San Francisco to
augment the vocal skyrockets.
The three sections of the parade
will start moving promptly at 7
o'clock. One division will come down
the Row from the Sigma Nu house,
headed by a part of the Stanford
band. The second section will proceed
from Encina and Toyon, also headed
by a part of the band. The third sec
tion, from Sequoia, will not have any
brass music because there isn't enough
band, according to Lapp. The groups
will meet at the postoffic-e.
Torches were to be distributed to
the different groups during the after
noon by members of the Rally Com
mittee.
Students are especially urged to join
