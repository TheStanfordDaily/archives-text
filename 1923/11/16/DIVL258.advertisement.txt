Gene, Does He Know
Why you look so wonderful? Of course because
you are brimming over with joy on general prin
ciples, but especially because you always look more
adorable titan ever, when you knozv you have that
"I-don' t-blame-you-f or-admiring-ii" feeling.
It certainly was lucky that you bought that excep
tionally smart sports hat for that most wonderful
house-partyâ€”and at such a moderate price! Of
course the Livingston Shop has loads of others in
orchid, beige, grey, red, blue and green, but I
think you took the smartest of all when you chose
that )iasturtium-colored one.
Besides being just the thing for house-parties, it
is "the" hat at the football games on Saturdays.
