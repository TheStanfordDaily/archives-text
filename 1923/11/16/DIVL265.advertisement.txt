Sg||gHE "Leeds" has caught
the American fancy. ;
It follows the popular
English trend in men's suits,

institution. The coat is a three
buttoned, short lapeled model,
with soft flowing body lines
and trim fitting neck and shoul
ders. The round pointed vest
and the full, wide bottomed
trousers that hang from the waist !
instead of the hips also carry out
the American idea of what Eng

colors are as pleasing as the cut,
and like all Roos suits, the "Leeds"
is unconditionally guaranteed.
