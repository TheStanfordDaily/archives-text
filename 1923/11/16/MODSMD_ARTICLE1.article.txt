# CARD GRAYS WALLOP BRUIN RESERVES IN FAST CONTEST, 20-6
## 'Porky' Dwight Runs Wild Through Bear Team; California Loses Punch as Stanford Scores 
### 
Stanford's Gray eleven rammed, outran, and outplayed California's Reserve
team yesterday afternoon, winning one of the hardest-fought football games
of the season, 20-6.
To "Porky" Dwight go the laurels. Whether it was passing, running the ends,
kicking, bucking the line, the husky Stanford halfback invariably tore through
the Bruin defense for gains which ate up the distance between the rival goal
posts. California could not stop Dwight. There was a flash of a nose guard,
and a pair of heels, and "Porky" was gone, to be tackled only after chalking
up a substantial gain.
Stanford Scores Early
Stanford scored the first touchdown eight minutes after California had
kicked off. Kirwan returned the kick-off twenty-five yards. A series of end
runs and off-tackle bucks placed the ball on the California thirty-yard line,
and the Bears forced Dwight to kick. The punt put the Bruins back forty-five
yards, the Card end nailing the safety in his tracks. California immediately
punted, and the Cardinal team began a march for a touchdown. Williamson
skirted right end for eight yards, Dwight no gain, and Stratton made downs

on a two-yard buck. A criss-cross, Wil
liamson to Dwight, made fifteen yards,
but a penalty on the next play slowed
up the squad. A fifteen-yard pass, Kir
wan to Foster, placed the ball on the
three-yard line. Stratton bucked the
sphere over for the first touchdown on
two succeeding plays. Dwiglit failed
to convert.
California Ties Score
In the second quarter California got
the ball and began a driving offensive.
The first play netted fifteen yards,
Smith's drop kick went wild, but the
next play gave the Bears fifteen addi
tional yards, and a minute later they
scored. Smith failed to convert. Stan
ford 6, California 6.
After the first scoring it was a ques
tion of which team had the ball. Both
lines were weak, and both backfields
strong. The Stanford ends were play
ing too close, and the Bears gained at
will on end runs.
Another Card Touchdown .
Stanford scored again in the second
half after Dwight had run 30 yards

twenty-yard line, Dwight scored on a
