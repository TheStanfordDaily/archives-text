# 'Outlaw War and Save Civilization,' Advises Dr. Jordan
## 
### 
"The only way to save civilization is to
outlaw war," declared Dr. Jordan in dis
cussing "The Lost Millennium" in the
weekly conference at his home last night.
Every civil, military, religious, and
moral force should work towards the
same goal—to end war forever. If we
cannot do that, and continue in our crude
notions of war as glory, and victory as
yielding financial and other benefits, we
are not worthy of the sacrifice of our
sons on the fields of Flanders. That is
our lesson. The soldiers have done their
part. It is for us to finish it, and prove
the cynical notion that is spread over the
world that war is to end war.
W/ar Is Great Enemy
"The people at large must come to
realize that war is the greatest enemy of
humanity, an absolute abomination. Every
crime is practiced under the cover of
war, and as such is countenanced by the
nation and sanctified by the church.
"In considering the first twelve years
of the century known as the "Golden
Age"—Dr. Jordan explained that the
same moral and financial standards pre
vailed all over the world at that time,
while education in the arts and sciences
was far advanced.
Whatever knowledge gathered in one
country was available in others, due to
efficient modes of communication, such as
the cable and telegraph. The perfection
of justice and equal opportunities for
everyone as well as the spreader of knowl
edge and Christianity were also the aims
of great groups of people. The knowl
edge of medicine and surgery had length
ened the life of the average man from 36
to 46 years.
Millennium Broken Up
This state of affairs was broken up
because of the fear on the part of the
aristocrats of the different countries, and
particularly in Germany, that they would
lose their power unless there was some
disturbance. As a result, the continent
of Europe became a maelstrom, more
suffering and confusion being caused than
ever before. Efforts were made to word
better things by violence, which is an
impossibility, since only peaceful effort
can gain the desired end.
"Our soldiers went to Europe to break
up a military organization which was
robbing other countries and doing great
mischief to the world," declared Dr.
Jordan. "They were successful in a war
to end war, but we have all forgotten
that soldiers cannot end war; they can
merely break up other armies; the ending
of war is the duty of civil authorities,"
concluded Dr. Jordan.
