# VANDALS HERE FOR STANFORD CLASH
## UNDEFEATED IDAHO TEAM WILL DEPEND ON OPEN OFFENSIVE Northerners Are Light But Fast; Cardinals Prepared to Check Forward Pass System 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford's driving offensive and weighty defensive power will be pitted
against the trickery, brains, and speed of the Idaho varsity tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 in the stadium.
The Cardinals' main strength will lie in their ability to break up open
field plays and forward passing. Idaho's chief lookout will be plunging
guards, and tackles through a lighter line.
Idaho —fast, tricky, full of surprises, and ability to pull the unexpected,
has knocked the props from under more than one ambitious coast champion.
Her record this season has been clean, with only a 0-0 tie game with Oregon to
mar an otherwise clean sweep. In defeating the Oregon Aggies 7-0 last w«ek,

Idaho resembled a whirlwind team;
the score should have been two touch
downs larger, according to reports.
The Vandals' handicap in the Aggie
game was the same as it is likely to
be tomorrow: The absence of Wayne
Davis, fleet halfback, from the line-up
Northerners Play Breaks
Idaho's style of play is to wait for
the unexpected fumble or dropped
punt. Pitzke, playing right half for
Idaho, is reported to be one of the best
long-distance kickers in the Confer
ence. Against the Oregon Aggies,
Fitzke averaged 50 yards on punts,
excelling any record made by a kicker
on a Coast team this season. Kerr is
depending chiefly on Ernie Nevers to
bear the brunt of the punting. The
Card line should encounter no difficul
ty in protecting the big fullback since
the Vandal line is outweighed seven
pounds to the man.
Nevers, in practice, is getting the
ball away with the usual speed, put
ting more drive into his punt, and on
the whole is averaging a greater dis
tance, according to Andy Kerr. The
entire Stanford squad is going into
the game with a determination to win
and enough confidence in their own
ability to cut the buck.
Watch Camp jell
"Scotchy" Campbell will be back
in the old berth at quarterback and
safety man. It is the popular opinion
of many sport critics that Campbell
is by far the best field general on the
Coast.
The Vandals will not be handi
capped by playing on a strange field.
Idaho's schedule this year has in
cluded three games away from home,
and the Northerners have made the
longest trip ever taken by a Coast
Conference team.
Lawson Will Start
Andy Kerr is using the same line-up
as in the Oregon game last week. Jim
Lawson, whom many predicted would
be out for the rest of the season with
injuries, is now back in his position
as end. Tommy Thomas will hold
down the other flank berth. Johnston
will start at right tackle, with Cleave
land and Wheat in the halfback posi
tions.

Idaho — Stanford —
Nelson LE Thomas
Haueer LT Shipkey
Goff LG Cravens
Kline C Baker
Tapper RG Faville
Quinn RT Johnston

excelling any record made by a kicker
on a Coast team this season. Kerr is
depending chiefly on Ernie Nevers to
bear the brunt of the punting. The
Card line should encounter no difficul
ty in protecting the big fullback since
the Vandal line is outweighed seven
pounds to the man.
Nevers, in practice, is getting the
ball away with the usual speed, put
ting more drive into his punt, and on
the whole is averaging a greater dis
tance, according to Andy Kerr. The
entire Stanford squad is going into
the game with a determination to win
and enough confidence in their own
ability to cut the buck.
Watch Camp jell
"Scotchy" Campbell will be back
in the old berth at quarterback and
safety man. It is the popular opinion
of many sport critics that Campbell
is by far the best field general on the
Coast.
The Vandals will not be handi
capped by playing on a strange field.
Idaho's schedule this year has in
cluded three games away from home,
and the Northerners have made the
longest trip ever taken by a Coast
Conference team.
Lawson Will Start
Andy Kerr is using the same line-up
as in the Oregon game last week. Jim
Lawson, whom many predicted would
be out for the rest of the season with
injuries, is now back in his position
as end. Tommy Thomas will hold
down the other flank berth. Johnston
will start at right tackle, with Cleave
land and Wheat in the halfback posi
tions.
Probable line-up:
Idaho — Stanford —
Nelson LE Thomas
Haueer LT Shipkey
Goff LG Cravens
Kline C Baker
Tapper RG Faville
Quinn RT Johnston
Fleeser RE Lawson
Stivers Q Campbell
Kleffner LH Cleaveland
Fitzke RH Wheat
Bucklin F Nevers
Stanford's driving offensive and weighty defensive power will be pitted
against the trickery, brains, and speed of the Idaho varsity tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 in the stadium.
The Cardinals' main strength will lie in their ability to break up open
field plays and forward passing. Idaho's chief lookout will be plunging
guards, and tackles through a lighter line.
Idaho —fast, tricky, full of surprises, and ability to pull the unexpected,
has knocked the props from under more than one ambitious coast champion.
Her record this season has been clean, with only a 0-0 tie game with Oregon to
mar an otherwise clean sweep. In defeating the Oregon Aggies 7-0 last w«ek,

Idaho resembled a whirlwind team;
the score should have been two touch
downs larger, according to reports.
The Vandals' handicap in the Aggie
game was the same as it is likely to
be tomorrow: The absence of Wayne
Davis, fleet halfback, from the line-up
Northerners Play Breaks
Idaho's style of play is to wait for
the unexpected fumble or dropped
punt. Pitzke, playing right half for
Idaho, is reported to be one of the best
long-distance kickers in the Confer
ence. Against the Oregon Aggies,
Fitzke averaged 50 yards on punts,
excelling any record made by a kicker
on a Coast team this season. Kerr is
depending chiefly on Ernie Nevers to
bear the brunt of the punting. The
