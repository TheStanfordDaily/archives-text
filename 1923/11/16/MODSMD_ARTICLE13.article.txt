# HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE ON CAMPUS-BARROW
## 
### 
Health conditions at Stanford are
above the average, according to a re
port to President Wilbur from Dr. W.
H. Barrow, Medical Advisor of Men.
The report contains statistics for
the month of October and shows that
there are no serious sicknesses preva
lent in the University, only a slight
epidemic of colds being noticed. These
colds, according to Dr. Barrow, are
usually evident at the beginning of
the University year and are due to
changes in climate and living condi
tions attendant on the entrance to
college.
Eleven hundred and forty-two calls
for attention or advice were made at
the Medical Advisor's office during
October as compared with 3500 made
last year. Of the 1142, 235 were made
because of athletic injuries. Of this
number, however, only two cases of
broken bones were reportedâ€”one from
the varsity and one from the freshman
squad.
Physical examinations are being
held daily and the office expects to
complete the entire list by the close
of the quarter.
A few other statistics from the re
port are as follows:
Men admitted to Palo Alto hos
pital 46
Days lost by these men 114
Men examined to determine fitness
for athletic competition 213
Excuses from class issued on ac
count of sickness 178
Total hours lost through excuses....4sB

California's Campanile can be
seen on clear days from the Lathrop
residence in the rear of the campus.
