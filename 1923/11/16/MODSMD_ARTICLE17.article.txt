Tomorrow afternoon you will have your last
chance to practice for the Big; Game. You will be
given some stunts to perform, to test your ability
to comprehend instructions, and a large amount of
yelling to unbosom, to test your spirit. After the
Idaho game you will have no further chance to
work in the bleachers until you are seated in the
Berkeley bowl.
So far this season you have given what might
be termed a fairly creditable performance. You are
better than last year —a little. But—you, the rooters
for the Stanford varsity, are not keeping up with
the team. You are not improving as the team has
improved, not yelling as the supporters of a team
like the 1923 varsity should yell You are timid,
hesitant, and afraid that perhaps that Red wall has
a fault somewhere. You are sitting back and wait
ing for the team to show that you will be justified
in breaking a lung by cheering after the game is
won.
Don't you realize that you are rfot wearing red
md white hats in the rooters' section to make a pretty
display ? Haven't you found out that you are there
to get behind the Red eleven, yell it on to victory,
and help—as Andy Kerr says it does help—put over
a touchdown by sending a skyrocket booming across
the field when the men are fighting in front of the
goal posts?
Tomorrow is your last opportunity to swing into
line back of the varsity in the onward sweep to
victory. Let's go!
