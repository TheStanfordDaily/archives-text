# How Not to Spend the Week-End
## 
### 
There are some people on the campus who haven't
the faintest idea of what the University looks like
aver the week-end, and no desire to find out. They
leave for San Francisco on Saturday, and often
don't return until Monday afternoon.
The intervening time is spent exploring various
pleasure resorts adjacent to the bay.
Most'of these commuters to the theater row leave
the campus in the afternoon, with no intention of
seeing any football games that might be offered as
an attraction to stay on the campus.
Stanford has become the close-knit, unified college
she now is because her students are set apart in a
community of their own, with no need or motive
to leave her environs. When certain members of
the community make it a weekly practice to get as
far away from the University as possible, they are
working to destroy that unified spirit; when these
same students leave the campus while the Stanford
eleven is playing football, they are working to bring
the spirit of Stanford into contempt.

It is impossible to appreciate properly an artistic
presentation in an auditorium whose closed windows
stifle the packed audience inside.
