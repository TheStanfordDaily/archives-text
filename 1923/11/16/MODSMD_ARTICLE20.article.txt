# CABBAGES TWENTY YEARS AGO TODAY
## 
### 
The first co-ed joke was cracked today. The one, you
know, which goes:
She—I just love dancing.
He—(supply your own answer).
Also the one that runs something like this:
There was a young fellow from Keeling,
Who had such a very queer feeling,
He slipped on the rug,
And busted his mug,*
Spilling water all over the ceiling.
♦Mug ni the sense of drinking-glasß. Now obsolete.
In glancing over the Cabbage column of 20 years ago
today, we are reminded of a sentence from Shakespeare:
What's that?
'Twas ever thus.
IF—
There had been water in the lake last night, some one
would have been drowned.
We don't drop th'is and get to class, our law prof will
be simply hurt to death. That old saw that "Absence
makes the heart grow fonder" has been awfully, awfully
overworked.
• * *
Now this ain't a joke, but we have to put it here
because the chief is kinda partial to writin' his editorials
hisself.
Now here we stand in front of the P. O. with an unlit
fag. No matches in the vest pocket; none in the hat
band; none sewed in the lining of my coat. Next
reaction, "FROSH—MATCH!"
Nine dinks march by in squad formation. "Sorry, but
I haven't!" they cry in chorus.
Six more. One stops. Ah, a hope! One, after looking
in his wallet next to his registration card, says he had
one last week, but it musta got lost.
Seventeen more hailed, and still no ashes on my
cigarette.
1 am crazy by this time. "Ain't there no fourth-class
gent in the assemblage what has a luclfer?" I shout.
Chorus: "Hell, no!" And then they wonder why I don't
say, "Thank you kindly."
Honest to Bhudda, it sure has faded away, this match
carrying—l almost said tradition.
