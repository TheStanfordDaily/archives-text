## Jean Pierce 
### 
Jean Pierce is a nice girl. She has a Kind face, a good
heart, and means well. She wears sensible clothes, in
cluding numerous Victorian undergarments, cotton sox,
fiat-heeled shoes, and rubbers when it rains. She has
many framed mottoes in her room but seldom smiles.
She weeps at sentimental movie matinees. After
graduation she hopes to secure a school down home at
Manteca. To her, audible exuberance is "unwomanly."
Hilarity is a sin. Jean Pierce is a nice girl.
