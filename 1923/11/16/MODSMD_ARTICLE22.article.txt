"DRIFTING," Stnaford Theater, Palo Alto, now playing.
This looks like a nice week-end at the movies. As we
said last night, Mae Murray, at the Varsity, is putting
on a good production for those who are not jazz-tired.
Now here we are, at the Stanford, "Drifting" with
Priscilla Dean. Her team lines up as follows:
Captainff P. Dean (herself):
Villain: W. Beery (himself).
Hero: Matt Moore (itself).
Dupe: Anna May Wong (in person).
About an eighty per cent picture, full of real thrills.
Just the anti-type of "The French Doll," being real
drama.
In the last number of the California "Occident." one
William E. Oliver enters into a long discussion, con
taining many nice theories, of "The Art of the Photo
play." His introduction is worth noting:
"The art of the photoplay is suffering from the wrong
point of view. The photoplay should not be dealt with
in* terms of the orthodox drama any more than painting
should be criticized in terms of sculpture . . And
then, towards the conclusion, another sentence worthy
of reproduction here:
"The next generation will contain the great masters
of the screen. We (speaking of present producers) are
the Heywoods, the Ben Johnsons, if you like —we are
making art forms . . . Among men who will come after
us will be 'Shakespeare,' 'Ibsen,' 'Moliore,' but it will
be worth while that we have tried to clear away the
snags, so that when the next generation comes an art
form will be ready for their hands which they will
develop as the real screen literature." If that be your
aim, oh present producers, Marlowea in the advance of
a new Shakespeare, then wo are heartily bhind you,
willing to appreciate and cheer when you succeed, and
willing, if not happy, to suffer when you fail! —H. M.
