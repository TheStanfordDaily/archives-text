# BARRISTERS BATTLE ON FRESHMAN TURF
## 
### 
Lawyers of the Union and Sequoia
will hold a legal controversy on the
freshman turf tomorrow morning at
10 o'clock. Both teams have been
practising this week. The Union
"tigers" claim a fast line, a secret
dropkicker, and an edge on beef. The
"lion tamers" of Sequoia have their
strength in the backs and ends and
allege a premium on brains.
"Alabi" Londahl will captain the
Sequoia eleven, while "Soak" Lewis
will head the tiger's charge.
All members of both teams are go
ing to the cotillion. Four new men
who sleep in the Union will probably
be declared ineligible tonight.
The rooting section will be led by
Cldude Minard, assisted by Burt
Lapp.
The winner of the contest will play
the Toyon "police dogs."
