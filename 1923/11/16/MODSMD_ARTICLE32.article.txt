# Peace by War—An IHusion Will Be Dr. McCall's Topic
## 
### 
"Peace by War —Another Great Il
lusion!" will be the topic of Dr. Os
wald W. S. McCall's third lecture Mon
day at 7:30 in the Memorial Church.
"War appeals to me very strongly,"
said Dr. McCall. "There is bound to
be a fascination about its pomp and
circumstance. But when it comes into
conflict with one's convictions, that is
another matter. War loses its savor
when one thinks of the heartbreaks of
women which it causes, of the suffer
ings of little children."
Dr. McCall has traveled widely. He
has been in nearly all parts of the
world, being especially familiar with
Australia, his birthplace. He was a
chaplain during the war, serving in
Australia and France.
