# FRATERNITY FUTURE DISCUSSED IN NEXT ISSUE OF SPECTATOR
## 
### 
"Has the Greek a Future?" an arti
cle dealing with the future of Stan
ford fraternities, will be the leading
story in the Big Game issue of the
Spectator which will appear on the
campus Monday. Two viewpoints are
expressed in the discussion, one that
of a fraternity man and the other that
of a sorority woman.
Two football stories will be included
in the issue. Bill Leiser has given a
highly optimistic view of the present
situation and Don Liebendorfer has
contributed a dope story compiled in
light of the recent games.
"Governments, Laws, and Politics"
will be the subject of an article by
Carl Wilhelmson. It is serious and
deals with the different forms of gov
ernments and their "evanescent"
character. A pictorial section made
up by the Spectator will be shown.
Among the views will foe action pic
tures of the varsity football games and
some additional gridiron stars. The
usual book reviews will appear.
"Bursted Bubbles," an editorial
which frankly discusses the new plan
of putting the freshmen in Encina
hall, will tell whether in the mind of
the editor the scheme has succeeded
or not. Another editorial, written by
Ed Landels and entitled "Credit Whore
Due," re-opens the controversy of gym
credits which are now refused to
upperclassmen. Some short poems
conclude the issue.
