# Band Acquires Drum Major for Big Game; New Uniforms Arrive
## 
### 
When the Stanford band goes
on to the field of California's Me
morial stadium, Big Game Day, it
will march as a band should march,
and it will be lead by a drum ma
jor.
The band has lacked a drum ma
jor for several years. This season,
George Kearns will swing the stick.
After every rehearsal, Kearns gets
the band out on the march for an
hour or so.
The new uniforms have arived at
Roos Bros, and are now being al
tered to fit the men. Professor E.
W. Martin's medley march is being
learned for the Big Game.
