# FINE TECHNIQUE OF ZIMBALIST DISPLAYED IN DIFFICULT PROGRAM
## 
### Miriam Hilton 
Remarkable technique, displayed in a
repertoire requiring masterful skill and
splendid support from the accompanist,
made Zimbalist's concert last evening six
encores longer, by popular demand.
"Symphonie Espagnole," probably the
most difficult number, of the program,
with its fickle changes of mood expressed
in sweeping runs and intricate trills, was
played with perfect mastery. The wist
fully mysterious "Havanaise" of Saint-
Saens gave the artist an opportunity for
beautiful double-stop runs; and {he old
gypsy melodies, "Zigeunerweisen," by
Sarsate, was presented vividly.
Zimbalist's fantasy 011 Rimski-Korsa
koff's "Co d'Or" was an interesting in
terweaving of airs, but was like a relish
in stimulating a desire for the original.
