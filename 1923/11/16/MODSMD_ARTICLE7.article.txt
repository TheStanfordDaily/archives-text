# FINE TECHNIQUE OF ZIMBALIST DISPLAYED IN DIFFICULT PROGRAM
## 
### Miriam Hilton 
Remarkable technique, displayed in a
repertoire requiring masterful skill and
splendid support from the accompanist,
made Zimbalist's concert last evening six
encores longer, by popular demand.
"Symphonie Espagnole," probably the
most difficult number, of the program,
with its fickle changes of mood expressed
in sweeping runs and intricate trills, was
played with perfect mastery. The wist
fully mysterious "Havanaise" of Saint-
Saens gave the artist an opportunity for
beautiful double-stop runs; and {he old
gypsy melodies, "Zigeunerweisen," by
Sarsate, was presented vividly.
Zimbalist's fantasy 011 Rimski-Korsa
koff's "Co d'Or" was an interesting in
terweaving of airs, but was like a relish
in stimulating a desire for the original.
A tier's arrangement of Tschaikowsky's
"Andante cantabile" was particularly
lovely in contrast to the technical display
of preceding numbers. The Bach "Pre
lude and Beethoven "Romance" were
played with understanding, although, on
several occasions in the first part of the
program, G-string had a slight tendency
to scratch.
Zimbalist did not use his famous "Ti
tian" violin, which is safely locked in a
vault in New York, but his instrument,
also a Stradavarius, left nothing to be
desired. He played to one of the largest
audiences ever crowded into the Assem
bly hall for a peninsula concert.
All of his encore numbers were of the
usually familiar type: "Salut d'Amour,"
Elgar; Saint-Saens' "Swan"; "Tam
bourin Chinois," Pugnani-Kreisler; Dro-
Ja's "Souvenir"; Drigo's airy "Valse
Bluette"; and "Zephyr" by Houbay.
