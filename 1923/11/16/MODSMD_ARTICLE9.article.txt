# FIRE! RALLY IS SQUELCHED
## Speakers Are Optimistic But Crowd Dashes Away When Alarm Is Turned In 
### 
The rally was transformed into an
impromptu cross-country event, with
the Stanford student body dashing
wildly across the campus spoiling for
trouble â€”only to find that there wasn't
any trouble, and the bonfire was safe.
Palo Alto High School students
were last night the innocent causes
one of the most gigantic hoaxes
ever perpetrated on the campus, off
the campus, or vice versa. Card root
ers were so absorbed in their own
rally that they never considered the
possibility of someone else staging a
rally at the same time. And when the
Paly High students touched off their
own personal bonfire as a preliminary
to their "Big Game" of the year, Stan
ford fans got all wrought up. With
the first cry of "Fire!" from the crowd
that thronged the lake bank, Stan
ford's rally was a total loss, while the
students rushed to "save" the bonfire.
Exciting Rally Nipped
The hoax terminated what was far
and away the most enthusiastic and
exciting rally the campus has known
for a long time. From the time the
parades formed to the moment the
crowd ran away muttering curses.
Stanford's "assistant varsity squad"
! demonstrated the return of the old
spirit. The yell leaders had the crowd
with them from the start.
' "The Stanford team is going to win

this year with your support," said
"Dutch" Roth in an impromptu ad
dress at the rally.
Victory Predicted
"Stanford is going to have two
teams at the California game. One
will be on the field, messing up those
blue boys. The other will be in the
rooting section." This was the message
given to the rooters by Coach Andy
Kerr through Burt Lapp. Kerr was
unable to be present at the rally, but
lie relayed his appeal for support on
the part of the students on November!
24.
"Stanford can win, but it is going to
be a hard fight, and it will take every
ounce of fight you've got for the squad
to put it over," Lapp continued.
Alibis Now Needless
The thing that the campus needs
most is a realization that this year
the Cardinal team can and will win,
Roth thinks. 'We've been going around
the last three or four years alibi-ins
ourselves for not winning. This year
is the year for us," he said; and he ;
referred to past game's of the season
in support of this.
Rooters must wear white shirts and
bow ties to the Big Game, Lapp said.
Rooters' hats must be worn at the
Idaho game, in order that more prac
tice may be had on bleacher stunts.
