# HOCKEY TEAMS DIVIDE HONORS WITH BERKELEY
## Stanford Seniors Win, 6-1 ; Card 1926 Squad Loses To California, 6-5 
### 
Stanford and California hockey
teams divided the victories in Satur
day's games when the Cardinal senior
squad defeated their Blue and Gold
rivals 6-1, and the Berkeley sopho
mores beat the Stanford eleven 6-5
in a closely contested clash.
Berkeley Begins Attack
In the first half of the senior tilt,
the Blue and Gold team took the offen
sive. The Berkeley women played
around and on all sides of the Card
squad. Long drives and consistent
dribbling kept the ball near the Berke
ley goal. Quick interference on the
part of the Stanford fullbacks held
the California team from scoring.
Vera Wallstrum, left-inside, carried
the ball down the field, slipped by the
Stanford defense, and netted the first
point for the Blue and Gold seniors.
The first half ended with a score of
1-0 in California's favor.
Seniors Use Speedy Passes
Something that the captain said
during the intermission, or some in
spiration from a Muse who was a
Stanford well-wisher, made the Card
team race into the second half of the
game with a determination to win.
Berkeley was forced to take the de
fensive. Speedy forward passing kept
the ball within the striking circle of
the Stanford goal. The California
seniors were unable to play their posi
tions or to form an effective blockade.
Stanford shot six goals with machine
gun rapidity.
Grace Strobel, Card center-forward,
broke through the Berkeley defense
and scored twice for Stanford. Clever
passing on the part of the Cardinal
forward line kept the ball from being
blocked by the California interference.
While the Berkeley seniors were try
ing to catch up with the quick forward
passes, Muriel Bell, left-inside, shot
through the California backfield for
a goal. She followed up this play by
hammering on the Berkeley blockade
until she was able to break through
for two more points.
Berkeley Scores for Cards
In trying to push back the Stanford
attack, the Berkeley defense shot the
ball into the Cardinal goal. The Cali
fornia eleven spent all its energy in j
attempting to keep the Card team J
from scoring and had no chance to j
carry the ball down the turf to their j
territory. #
The senior team line-up was: Eunice
Biddle, right wing; Isabella Muzzey,
right-inside; Grace Strobel, center for
ward; Muriel Bell, left-inside; Ruth
Jameson, left-wing; Carol Hyde, right
halfback; Alice Roth, center-halfback;
Josephine Franklin, left-halfback;
Geraldine Franklin, right-fullback;
Dorothy Brenholtz, goaler; Dorothy
Shepard, left-fullback.
Card Team Scores First
The sophomores started their game
by driving straight for their territory
and making a goal. Frances Jongeneel,
left-inside for the Cardinal team, add- j
ed the first point to the sophomores'
score. Immediately after this play
every one of the sophomores must
have decided to win the game alone.
There was no teamwork, and none of!
the players kept their positions. The
sophomores crowded around the ball
and blocked their own drives. Once
the California women recovered the
ball, they had a clear field and could
shoot for a goal without any inter
ference. The Berkeley eleven piled up
six points in the first half.
After the intermission the Card
squad held the ball in Stanford's ter
ritory. The sophomores made a des
perate effort to go over the score of
the Blue and Gold team. Cecile Feu
sier, right-wing, drove through the
Berkeley defense and scored for the '
Card sophomores. Two breaks in the ;
California backfield gave Stanford two I
more goals. Aileene Burks, Cardinal 1
center-forward, made another poifit j

for the sophomores by driving into the
goal from a penalty bully.
Sophomores Lack Teamwork
The sophomores defeated them
selves because of their poor teamwork.
This lack of co-operation caused them
to lose several chances to shoot goals.
They forgot to rush the ball when it
was within the striking circle, and the
Berkeley defense had a chance to
push the attack out of the twenty
five yard line.
The following women played on the
sophomore team: Cecile Feusier, right
wing; Millison Hardy, right-inside;
Aileene Burks, center-forward; Fran
ces Jongeneel, left-inside; Ruth Sned
don, left-wing; Jean Ward, right-half
back; Ruth Vredenburgh, center-half
back; Aileen Tognazzini, left-halfback;
Susan Hyde, right-fullback; Marion
Ebright, left-fullback; Pauline Hoff
man, goaler.

Freshmen at the College of Business
Administration of Boston University have
proven their valor, and need no more

The fine spirit displayed in the college
and at the annual flag rush is responsible
for lifting the ban.

and making a goal. Frances Jongeneel,
left-inside for the Cardinal team, add- j
ed the first point to the sophomores'
score. Immediately after this play
every one of the sophomores must
have decided to win the game alone.
There was no teamwork, and none of!
the players kept their positions. The
sophomores crowded around the ball
and blocked their own drives. Once
the California women recovered the
ball, they had a clear field and could
shoot for a goal without any inter
ference. The Berkeley eleven piled up
six points in the first half.
After the intermission the Card
squad held the ball in Stanford's ter
ritory. The sophomores made a des
perate effort to go over the score of
the Blue and Gold team. Cecile Feu
sier, right-wing, drove through the
Berkeley defense and scored for the '
Card sophomores. Two breaks in the ;
California backfield gave Stanford two I
more goals. Aileene Burks, Cardinal 1
center-forward, made another poifit j

for the sophomores by driving into the
goal from a penalty bully.
Sophomores Lack Teamwork
The sophomores defeated them
selves because of their poor teamwork.
This lack of co-operation caused them
to lose several chances to shoot goals.
They forgot to rush the ball when it
was within the striking circle, and the
Berkeley defense had a chance to
push the attack out of the twenty
five yard line.
The following women played on the
sophomore team: Cecile Feusier, right
wing; Millison Hardy, right-inside;
Aileene Burks, center-forward; Fran
ces Jongeneel, left-inside; Ruth Sned
don, left-wing; Jean Ward, right-half
back; Ruth Vredenburgh, center-half
back; Aileen Tognazzini, left-halfback;
Susan Hyde, right-fullback; Marion
Ebright, left-fullback; Pauline Hoff
man, goaler.

Stanford and California hockey
teams divided the victories in Satur
day's games when the Cardinal senior
squad defeated their Blue and Gold
rivals 6-1, and the Berkeley sopho
mores beat the Stanford eleven 6-5
in a closely contested clash.
Berkeley Begins Attack
In the first half of the senior tilt,
the Blue and Gold team took the offen
sive. The Berkeley women played
around and on all sides of the Card
squad. Long drives and consistent
dribbling kept the ball near the Berke
ley goal. Quick interference on the
part of the Stanford fullbacks held
the California team from scoring.
Vera Wallstrum, left-inside, carried
the ball down the field, slipped by the
Stanford defense, and netted the first
point for the Blue and Gold seniors.
The first half ended with a score of
1-0 in California's favor.
Seniors Use Speedy Passes
Something that the captain said
during the intermission, or some in
spiration from a Muse who was a
Stanford well-wisher, made the Card
team race into the second half of the
game with a determination to win.
Berkeley was forced to take the de
fensive. Speedy forward passing kept
the ball within the striking circle of
the Stanford goal. The California
seniors were unable to play their posi
tions or to form an effective blockade.
Stanford shot six goals with machine
gun rapidity.
Grace Strobel, Card center-forward,
broke through the Berkeley defense
and scored twice for Stanford. Clever
passing on the part of the Cardinal
forward line kept the ball from being
blocked by the California interference.
While the Berkeley seniors were try
ing to catch up with the quick forward
passes, Muriel Bell, left-inside, shot
through the California backfield for
a goal. She followed up this play by
hammering on the Berkeley blockade
until she was able to break through
for two more points.

Vera Wallstrum, left-inside, carried
the ball down the field, slipped by the
Stanford defense, and netted the first
point for the Blue and Gold seniors.
The first half ended with a score of
1-0 in California's favor.
Seniors Use Speedy Passes
Something that the captain said
during the intermission, or some in
spiration from a Muse who was a
Stanford well-wisher, made the Card
team race into the second half of the
game with a determination to win.
Berkeley was forced to take the de
fensive. Speedy forward passing kept
the ball within the striking circle of
the Stanford goal. The California
seniors were unable to play their posi
tions or to form an effective blockade.
Stanford shot six goals with machine
gun rapidity.
Grace Strobel, Card center-forward,
broke through the Berkeley defense
and scored twice for Stanford. Clever
passing on the part of the Cardinal
forward line kept the ball from being
blocked by the California interference.
While the Berkeley seniors were try
ing to catch up with the quick forward
passes, Muriel Bell, left-inside, shot
through the California backfield for
a goal. She followed up this play by
hammering on the Berkeley blockade
until she was able to break through
for two more points.
Berkeley Scores for Cards
In trying to push back the Stanford
attack, the Berkeley defense shot the
ball into the Cardinal goal. The Cali
fornia eleven spent all its energy in j
attempting to keep the Card team J
from scoring and had no chance to j
carry the ball down the turf to their j
territory. #
The senior team line-up was: Eunice
Biddle, right wing; Isabella Muzzey,
right-inside; Grace Strobel, center for
ward; Muriel Bell, left-inside; Ruth
Jameson, left-wing; Carol Hyde, right
halfback; Alice Roth, center-halfback;
Josephine Franklin, left-halfback;
Geraldine Franklin, right-fullback;
Dorothy Brenholtz, goaler; Dorothy
Shepard, left-fullback.
Card Team Scores First
The sophomores started their game
by driving straight for their territory
and making a goal. Frances Jongeneel,
left-inside for the Cardinal team, add- j
ed the first point to the sophomores'
score. Immediately after this play
every one of the sophomores must
have decided to win the game alone.
There was no teamwork, and none of!
the players kept their positions. The
sophomores crowded around the ball
and blocked their own drives. Once
the California women recovered the
ball, they had a clear field and could
shoot for a goal without any inter
ference. The Berkeley eleven piled up
six points in the first half.
After the intermission the Card
squad held the ball in Stanford's ter
ritory. The sophomores made a des
perate effort to go over the score of
the Blue and Gold team. Cecile Feu
sier, right-wing, drove through the
Berkeley defense and scored for the '
Card sophomores. Two breaks in the ;
California backfield gave Stanford two I
more goals. Aileene Burks, Cardinal 1
center-forward, made another poifit j

for the sophomores by driving into the
goal from a penalty bully.
Sophomores Lack Teamwork
The sophomores defeated them
selves because of their poor teamwork.
This lack of co-operation caused them
to lose several chances to shoot goals.
They forgot to rush the ball when it
was within the striking circle, and the
Berkeley defense had a chance to
push the attack out of the twenty
five yard line.
The following women played on the
sophomore team: Cecile Feusier, right
wing; Millison Hardy, right-inside;
Aileene Burks, center-forward; Fran
ces Jongeneel, left-inside; Ruth Sned
don, left-wing; Jean Ward, right-half
back; Ruth Vredenburgh, center-half
back; Aileen Tognazzini, left-halfback;
Susan Hyde, right-fullback; Marion
Ebright, left-fullback; Pauline Hoff
man, goaler.

The fine spirit displayed in the college

Stanford and California hockey
teams divided the victories in Satur
day's games when the Cardinal senior
squad defeated their Blue and Gold
rivals 6-1, and the Berkeley sopho
mores beat the Stanford eleven 6-5
in a closely contested clash.
Berkeley Begins Attack
In the first half of the senior tilt,
the Blue and Gold team took the offen
sive. The Berkeley women played
around and on all sides of the Card
squad. Long drives and consistent
dribbling kept the ball near the Berke
ley goal. Quick interference on the
part of the Stanford fullbacks held
the California team from scoring.
Vera Wallstrum, left-inside, carried
the ball down the field, slipped by the
Stanford defense, and netted the first
point for the Blue and Gold seniors.
