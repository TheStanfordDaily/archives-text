## Stanford Seniors Win, 6-1 ; Card 1926 Squad Loses To California, 6-5 
### 
Stanford and California hockey
teams divided the victories in Satur
day's games when the Cardinal senior
squad defeated their Blue and Gold
rivals 6-1, and the Berkeley sopho
mores beat the Stanford eleven 6-5
in a closely contested clash.
Berkeley Begins Attack
In the first half of the senior tilt,
the Blue and Gold team took the offen
sive. The Berkeley women played
around and on all sides of the Card
squad. Long drives and consistent
dribbling kept the ball near the Berke
ley goal. Quick interference on the
part of the Stanford fullbacks held
the California team from scoring.
Vera Wallstrum, left-inside, carried
the ball down the field, slipped by the
Stanford defense, and netted the first
point for the Blue and Gold seniors.
The first half ended with a score of
1-0 in California's favor.
Seniors Use Speedy Passes
Something that the captain said
during the intermission, or some in
spiration from a Muse who was a
Stanford well-wisher, made the Card
team race into the second half of the
game with a determination to win.
