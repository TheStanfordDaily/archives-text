# BIG GAME RALLY, BONFIRE PLANNED FOR WEDNESDAY
## 
### Dave Lamson 
A rally will be held in the stadium on
Wednesday evening.
All students of the University are in
vited by Burt Lapp, head of the commit
tee in charge, to attend the affair.
The rally is intended as a preliminary
to the football game on November 24, and
will open with a monster parade down
the Row from the Alpha Delta Phi
house, residence of Captain John Donald
Campbell. At the close of the stadium
rally, the bonfire, built by freshmen for
the occasion, will be burned.
Grid Men to Attend
Rooters will see the team on Wednes
day night for the last time before the
California game* as Andy Fvrr's charges
leave for camp on Thursday.
If it were necessary to urge students
to attend the Hig Game rally, the program
for Wednesday's fiesta would present a
lot of arguments in favor of going.
"Something different," the watchword of
the rally committee, will be fully realized
here, according to Hurt Lapp.
New Stunts Promised
In the first place, a night rally in the
stadium is somewhat unusual. Entertain

ment numbers, including a comedy spe
cialty by the Ram's Head society, have
been arranged. The list of speakers has
not yet been completed, but Lapp prom
ises that it will be a good one.
Freshmen maintain that the bonfire
itself is distinctly different from previous
pyres. That the ceremony of the creama
tion of California's hopes will include
new stunts is the promise of the rally
committee.
The parade from the football captain's
house, in which all students are particu
larly urged to join, will begin at 7 o'clock
sharp. Headed by the band, the line will
move to the stadium, where the first part
of the program will take place. The bon
fire and serpentine will conclude the rally.
In another column of today's daily ap
pear two songs, which living groups are
earnestly requested to practice after din
ner tonight. "Sing each song twice over,"
Burt Lapp asks. "There arc two things
wrong with the singing by Stanford
rooters: First, they do not know the
songs, and second, they do not watch the
j leader throughout the piece. These dif
! Acuities may be easily overcome with a
j little practice. A short rehearsal will im
j prove the singing to a marked degree."

A rally will be held in the stadium on
Wednesday evening.
All students of the University are in
vited by Burt Lapp, head of the commit
tee in charge, to attend the affair.
The rally is intended as a preliminary
to the football game on November 24, and
will open with a monster parade down
the Row from the Alpha Delta Phi
house, residence of Captain John Donald
Campbell. At the close of the stadium
rally, the bonfire, built by freshmen for
the occasion, will be burned.
Grid Men to Attend
Rooters will see the team on Wednes
day night for the last time before the
California game* as Andy Fvrr's charges
leave for camp on Thursday.
If it were necessary to urge students
to attend the Hig Game rally, the program
for Wednesday's fiesta would present a
lot of arguments in favor of going.
"Something different," the watchword of
the rally committee, will be fully realized
here, according to Hurt Lapp.
New Stunts Promised
In the first place, a night rally in the
stadium is somewhat unusual. Entertain

ment numbers, including a comedy spe
cialty by the Ram's Head society, have
been arranged. The list of speakers has
not yet been completed, but Lapp prom
ises that it will be a good one.
Freshmen maintain that the bonfire
itself is distinctly different from previous
pyres. That the ceremony of the creama
tion of California's hopes will include
new stunts is the promise of the rally
committee.
The parade from the football captain's
house, in which all students are particu
larly urged to join, will begin at 7 o'clock
sharp. Headed by the band, the line will
move to the stadium, where the first part
of the program will take place. The bon
fire and serpentine will conclude the rally.
In another column of today's daily ap
pear two songs, which living groups are
earnestly requested to practice after din
ner tonight. "Sing each song twice over,"
Burt Lapp asks. "There arc two things
wrong with the singing by Stanford
rooters: First, they do not know the
songs, and second, they do not watch the
j leader throughout the piece. These dif
! Acuities may be easily overcome with a
j little practice. A short rehearsal will im
j prove the singing to a marked degree."
