# CAMPUS RAZORS ARE IDLE AS ROUGHS' DAY DESCENDS ON "FARM"
## 
### 
Roughs' Day! The day of the year!
The day when bearded men and heavy
woolens grace the campus. The primer
for the go-gettem spirit of the week-end!
! Wednesday is the time, three days before
the Big Game at Berkeley, where such
j appearance would make the heart of the
I Oski Wa Wa tremble.
All classes will stroll forth on Wed
nesday morning with gala day apparel,
remembering, however, to omit women's
costumes and avoid the heckling and an
noyance of professors and visitors. It is
Roughs' Day, for men undergraduates
I only, and the intelligence, which makes
â€¢ Stanford men individual, should appear
in the novel costumes of the occasion.
Activities must be limited to the cam
pus off-Quad. Classroom disturbances
will he the cause of some drastic action
by Men's Council, according to its own
last year. The tradition is on
trial. Violation of rules and regulations
will mean disappearance of Rough's Day
from among the few remaining campus
costumes.
There must be individual and not mob
action, thus giving opportunity ffir the
timid youth to wear his golf trousers,
that chic sweater his mother picked out
for him, or the neck tie his girl sent him
last Christmas. No one can massacre
him with impunity on Roughs' Day. All
for one, one for all. That is what the
day is for, and the undergraduates have
the chance to express their wishes as to
its preservation of destruction by their
actions on the campus Wednesday.
