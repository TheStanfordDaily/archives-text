# YOUTH FORGETS LIMIT OF SAFETYâ€”SCHWARTZ
## 
### 
"Youth today is likely to throw dice
with the devil.'
This was the assertion of Dr. Herman
F. Swartz, president of the Pacific School
of Religion, in his sermon yesterday
morning in Memorial Church.
"Youth climbs to great heights to see
life, and the view gained is in no pro
portion to the danger entailed," he con
tinued. Many people advocate an atti
tude of moderation in all things, but in
some things there is no moderation pos
sible, there is no border line or margin
of safety. Many issues are either right
or wrong. Who shall say that modera
tion is safe in lying, chastity, or pro
fanity?"
The text was from the story of the
! wise and foolish virgins who awaited the
coming of the bridegroom. The foolish
virgins were without oil when the groom
i arrived and were left outside of the
j church. Dr. Swartz showed how the
[ foolish had prepared for the minimum or
usual needs for oil and the wise ones for
| any emergency which might arise. He ap
! plied the text to modern life by saying
that people should maintain a maximum
I of morality, not a minimum.
"If our attitude is questioned, we should
I not leave any room for doubt as to our
stand." Dr. Swartz said. "We should de
clare ourselves so positively that there can
be no doubt, and not let our position be
contused with the twilight zone between
right and wrong."
