###

Spanish influence of California and har
monizes with the mission architecture of
Stanford.
The committee decided that a classical
name would not fit in with the spirit of
the University or the type of pageant
which the women give here. They thought
a more informal name would express bet
ter the idea of a spring fete given on the
green banks of a small lake.
"La Fiesta" was typical of the Spanish
reign in the west. Festivals of all sorts
are the national traditions of the Spanish
people. Since it is planned to give the
pageant at the lake "Lagunita" was also
incorporated in the title.
Although the name of the pageant is
Spanish, the character of the plot need
not necessarily be Spanish. The action
may be original, fanciful, or historical
and may concern any country at any
period of history.
Plots for the pageant must be sent to
W. A. A. campus, by the Monday after
Thanksgiving.

and which will decide on the plot is com
posed of the following members: Dean
