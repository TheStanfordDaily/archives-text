# FRESHMAN JUMPERS SHOW UP WELL IN FRIDAY TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Dink Templeton has some first class
high jumpers in this year's freshman
class. That fact was proven Friday when
Fred Richraann, a.lanky babe from L.
A. high, cleared the bar at 5 feet 6 inches
using a new form. This jump took first
in the weekly track meet. When Rich
tnann gets used to the new form he
should be able to add several inches more.
After the meet Dink had Tom Work,
who hails from Pacific Grove, clearing
5 feet 9 without much difficulty. This lad
shows the prettiest form seen on the farm
for some time, and from his past per
formances he should be able to clear the
six foot mark by spring.
Wells, a transfer from the Fresno Jun
ior College, took first in the broad
jump, first in his heat in the hundred,
and first in the hurdles. He did 20 feet
3 inches in the broad and 0:10 4-5 in the
century. He will be eligible for varsity
