Burial Song

We're going to bury you, Ca-li-for-ni-a.
To the grave-yard we'll carry you,
Ca-li-for-ni-a.
California. California, with your colors
gold and blue.
Down on the Stanford Quad, under the
red, red sod,
We're going to bury you.
California. California, we have sound
ed your alarm.
We'll have a bear or two for a barbe
cue
Down on the Stanford Farm.
We're going to bury you, Ca-li-for-ni-a.
To the grave-yard we'll carry you,
Ca-li-for-ni-a.
