# The 						Song of the Vandal Invader
## 
### 
When the Idaho team was back in its training
quarters after the game Saturday, beaten, exhausted,
and sick at heart, the captain called them together.
"We are going to sing the Idaho hymn," he said.
When the song was finished the men had for
gotten the defeat of half an hour before, remember
ing only the spirit that had brought them a thousand
miles full of hope and determination. The captain
had, by that command, turned their faces forward
toward the future and the battle with, U. S. C.
It was that fighting spirit that buoyed up Stan
ford in her years of defeat and disappointment. It
is that same spirit that is carrying her forward on
the crest of the wave to victory.
If that incident represents the feeling on the cam
pus of the University of Idaho, we'can expect great
and glorious things from her teams in the future.
For the present, Vandals, we hope you knock the
tin helmet off the head of the Trojan into the to
bacco-stained corner where it belongs.
