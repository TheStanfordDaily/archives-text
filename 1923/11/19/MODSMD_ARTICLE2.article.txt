# O'CONNER SMASHES 400 METER RECORD IN "WINGED 0" TANK
## 
### 
Wallace O'Conner, husky Cardinal
swimmer, surprised experts at the Olym
pic Club pool Friday evening when he
placed first in the 400-meter race, mak
ing the distance in 5:18 2-5, a new Pa
cific Coast record.
Lester , Smith of the "Winged O,"
Frank Mooney from Santa Clara, and
Clyde Goldwater, also a clubman, fin
ished second, third, and fourth respec
tively.
The former 400-meter record of 5:19
was hung up by Norman Ross, formerly
of Stanford and present holder of the
national title, by his time of 5:14 4-5
made under the Illinois Athletic Club
colors at Chicago.
O'Conner by his victory becomes the
Pacific Coast champion and looms as a
likely candidates from the west for the
Olympic games team. The formal tryouts
•will be held in May.
The Card entrant led the field after
the first hundred yards had been turned
and finished with a nineteen-yard lead.
Ernie Brandsten, Stanford coach, de
veloped of O'Conner from a strong, but
untrained, swimmer to the place he now
holds in western swimming circles.
"For some time previous to Friday
evening," said Brandsten this morning,
"there had been much discussion as to
the relative merits of the four men —
O'Conner, Smith, Mooney, and Gold
water —so the Olympic Club made the
400-meter race the feature of the eve
ning's card. We now have a line on our
prospects next May."
