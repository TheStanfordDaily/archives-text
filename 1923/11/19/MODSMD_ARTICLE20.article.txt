The Stanford campus, looked upon through the
microscope of the economist, seethes and buzzes
with the activities of students engaged in amassing
small fortunes. Laundry agents, haberdasheries,
fixed and perambulating, salesmen of soap and sand
wiches, and officials busy with various jobs for
which they are given great or small remuneration
in proportion to their work, may be seen through
the glass.
Over a half of the entire student body is engaged
in some form of money-making scheme, either the
conventional '"hashing'' or the less conventional
method of selling peanuts to the roughs at formal
dances. With so many opportunities for self-support
about, it is a wonder that some of the more ancient
hold-overs are not now in the millionaire class.
Only through that kind of evolution will Stanford
be known as a rich man's college.
