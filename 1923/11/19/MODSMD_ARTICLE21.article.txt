Bill Brogan, hurrying to his eight o'clock at 8 :20
this morning, stopped to laugh at a decrepit auto
mobile limp around a turn in the road and stop
with a bang as a tire blew off. As he stood in the
middle of the road exploding in several choice guf
faws, he was hit in the back by a member of the
R. O. T. C. hurrying to the stables on a bicycle,
and knocked just far enough to avoid being run
over by a one-lunged motorcycle carrying its owner
to a chemistry laboratory.
"Huh!" said Bill, as he unscrambled himself from
the geraniums, "if those guys didn't depend on
machines to get them to class they wouldn't be so
late." Then he gathered up his books and sprinted
for the last of his eight o'clock.
