BIG GAME STUNTS
By special arrangement with the Rally Committee
Cabbages is enabled to present a of the
Big Game Stunts. If we get around to do it we- may
do a few of them for you in the last paragraph. Number
One: At the count of one the entire rooting section will
change their cards to Red. At the count of two they will
all bury their hats in the loose gravel just under the
stadium seats. At the count of three they will quietly
rise and walk, not run, to the nearest exit. Number Two:
This stunt is complicated, and has never been tried
before. At the count of one the entire rooting section
will reach back with the right hand and draw from
right-hand hip pocket a six-shooter. At the count of
two each rooter will aim at a California rooter, < ailing
his shots. At the count of three all will fire. Each rooter
is requested to sit down while doing this, as the Rally
Committee is afraid there would be a spattering, if
anyone stood up.
Number Three: At the count of one each rooter will
take off his necktie. At the count of two each rooter
will lightly massage his Adam's apple, as silently as
possible. By this time California will be completely
puzzled, and probably Yale will be, too. At the count of
three each rooter will suddenly stand on his head and
impersonate an ostrich, the idea being to show Cali
fornia where she gets off at.
The Rally Committee asks us to request each living
group to get together right after dinner and practice
these stunts. All are simple, s?nd with the aid of a piano
and a traveling crane, can be picked up in no time.

RULES OF CONDUCT AT THE BIG GAME
1. Bottles must be quietly buried, and not thrown.
Anyone hitting a spectator with a bottle which has con
tained more than alcohol will receive attention
from the Men's Council. 4
2. Kicking of the vertebrae of the gentleman in front
will not be countenanced, at least by him, because he is
looking the other way, and how can you countenance a
thing when you were facing the other way? Parse this
sentence to suit yourself.
3. Those desiring to swear will please sit in the first
eight rows. In the past there has been a lot of good
talent going to waste because of lack of concentration.
This ygar it is hoped to get the very best Stanford has
to offer in this important line of student activity out
in front.
4. Queeners will not be allowed to wear tuxedos, un
less they really want to.
5. Anyone calling a taxi from the Associated Press
phone in the Press Box will get his in the Sunday
Chronicle, and if you know? of anythfhg worse than
that, keep it to yourself.
6. California men are requested not to sit in the
Stanford rooting section, because it isn't fair to put us
on our company manners and make us look out for
guests when we are busy.
7. The. serpentine will start promptly at 5:15. The
well-dressed man will wear a Stanford rooter's hat.
* * ♦
What would a Big Game be without the good old get
together banquet the night before? Simply splendid.
But we must have banquets, and Cabbages would be the
last to hang back. We would rather shoot back. Ban
quets are gotten up by well-meaning alumni for the
purpose of getting together with the student body. They
lorget that most of the student body, a living group at
a time, has been earnestly trying to get together with
the alumni more or less constantly in matters financial
for the last thirty years.
The banquet always starts out with a few well-chosen
speeches and a vigorous search by the high-spirited
alumni for some undergraduate who can lead yells.
After awhile the undergraduate who can lead yells will
be found hiding under a napkin, and will be dragged
forth. The rest of the evening will be spent in giving
one yell after another with the impromptu yell leader
just keeping company. He is just there for appearances,
anyway, and what is better than a little spur-of-the
moment yelling like we used to yell in '99? When the
evening is half over the place will be fairly full of
impromptu yell leaders anyway, and the dukes will be
in for a drafty evening.
Well, eleven o'clock the passes (the lino
typer was supposed to put an accent over that "e" so as
to make it sound ''passays," which makes a pretty fair
pun out of it) will be congregated down in the lobby.
Presumably the banquet is being given in a Club be
longing to somebody else, and the brethren congregated
down in the lobby will be trying earnestly to persuade
the club members to register for a few units, even if it
be only Greek Literature.
When the evening is over there will be a couple of
dozen brethren to round up, and the balance of the
evening can be spent on the way home in pointing out
to the inebriates the advantages of a little fresh air as
seen from the outside as an antidote to nausea.

eight rows. In the past there has been a lot of good
talent going to waste because of lack of concentration.
This ygar it is hoped to get the very best Stanford has
to offer in this important line of student activity out
in front.
4. Queeners will not be allowed to wear tuxedos, un

5. Anyone calling a taxi from the Associated Press
phone in the Press Box will get his in the Sunday

6. California men are requested not to sit in the
Stanford rooting section, because it isn't fair to put us
on our company manners and make us look out for
guests when we are busy.

What would a Big Game be without the good old get
together banquet the night before? Simply splendid.
But we must have banquets, and Cabbages would be the
last to hang back. We would rather shoot back. Ban
quets are gotten up by well-meaning alumni for the
purpose of getting together with the student body. They
lorget that most of the student body, a living group at
a time, has been earnestly trying to get together with
the alumni more or less constantly in matters financial
for the last thirty years.
The banquet always starts out with a few well-chosen
speeches and a vigorous search by the high-spirited
alumni for some undergraduate who can lead yells.
After awhile the undergraduate who can lead yells will
be found hiding under a napkin, and will be dragged
forth. The rest of the evening will be spent in giving
one yell after another with the impromptu yell leader
just keeping company. He is just there for appearances,
anyway, and what is better than a little spur-of-the
moment yelling like we used to yell in '99? When the
evening is half over the place will be fairly full of
impromptu yell leaders anyway, and the dukes will be
in for a drafty evening.
Well, eleven o'clock the passes (the lino
typer was supposed to put an accent over that "e" so as
to make it sound ''passays," which makes a pretty fair
pun out of it) will be congregated down in the lobby.
Presumably the banquet is being given in a Club be
longing to somebody else, and the brethren congregated
down in the lobby will be trying earnestly to persuade
the club members to register for a few units, even if it
be only Greek Literature.
When the evening is over there will be a couple of
dozen brethren to round up, and the balance of the
evening can be spent on the way home in pointing out
to the inebriates the advantages of a little fresh air as
seen from the outside as an antidote to nausea.

BIG GAME STUNTS
By special arrangement with the Rally Committee
Cabbages is enabled to present a of the
Big Game Stunts. If we get around to do it we- may
do a few of them for you in the last paragraph. Number
One: At the count of one the entire rooting section will
change their cards to Red. At the count of two they will
all bury their hats in the loose gravel just under the
stadium seats. At the count of three they will quietly
rise and walk, not run, to the nearest exit. Number Two:
This stunt is complicated, and has never been tried
before. At the count of one the entire rooting section
will reach back with the right hand and draw from
right-hand hip pocket a six-shooter. At the count of
two each rooter will aim at a California rooter, < ailing
his shots. At the count of three all will fire. Each rooter
is requested to sit down while doing this, as the Rally
Committee is afraid there would be a spattering, if
anyone stood up.
Number Three: At the count of one each rooter will
take off his necktie. At the count of two each rooter
will lightly massage his Adam's apple, as silently as
possible. By this time California will be completely
puzzled, and probably Yale will be, too. At the count of
three each rooter will suddenly stand on his head and
impersonate an ostrich, the idea being to show Cali
fornia where she gets off at.
The Rally Committee asks us to request each living
group to get together right after dinner and practice
these stunts. All are simple, s?nd with the aid of a piano
and a traveling crane, can be picked up in no time.

RULES OF CONDUCT AT THE BIG GAME
1. Bottles must be quietly buried, and not thrown.
Anyone hitting a spectator with a bottle which has con
tained more than alcohol will receive attention
from the Men's Council. 4
2. Kicking of the vertebrae of the gentleman in front
will not be countenanced, at least by him, because he is
looking the other way, and how can you countenance a
thing when you were facing the other way? Parse this
sentence to suit yourself.

pun out of it) will be congregated down in the lobby.
Presumably the banquet is being given in a Club be
longing to somebody else, and the brethren congregated
down in the lobby will be trying earnestly to persuade
the club members to register for a few units, even if it
be only Greek Literature.
When the evening is over there will be a couple of
dozen brethren to round up, and the balance of the
evening can be spent on the way home in pointing out
to the inebriates the advantages of a little fresh air as
seen from the outside as an antidote to nausea.

BIG GAME STUNTS
By special arrangement with the Rally Committee
Cabbages is enabled to present a of the
Big Game Stunts. If we get around to do it we- may
do a few of them for you in the last paragraph. Number
One: At the count of one the entire rooting section will
change their cards to Red. At the count of two they will
all bury their hats in the loose gravel just under the
stadium seats. At the count of three they will quietly
rise and walk, not run, to the nearest exit. Number Two:
This stunt is complicated, and has never been tried
before. At the count of one the entire rooting section
will reach back with the right hand and draw from
right-hand hip pocket a six-shooter. At the count of
two each rooter will aim at a California rooter, < ailing
his shots. At the count of three all will fire. Each rooter
is requested to sit down while doing this, as the Rally
Committee is afraid there would be a spattering, if
anyone stood up.
Number Three: At the count of one each rooter will
take off his necktie. At the count of two each rooter
will lightly massage his Adam's apple, as silently as
possible. By this time California will be completely
puzzled, and probably Yale will be, too. At the count of
three each rooter will suddenly stand on his head and
impersonate an ostrich, the idea being to show Cali
fornia where she gets off at.
The Rally Committee asks us to request each living
group to get together right after dinner and practice
these stunts. All are simple, s?nd with the aid of a piano
and a traveling crane, can be picked up in no time.

RULES OF CONDUCT AT THE BIG GAME
1. Bottles must be quietly buried, and not thrown.
Anyone hitting a spectator with a bottle which has con
tained more than alcohol will receive attention
from the Men's Council. 4
2. Kicking of the vertebrae of the gentleman in front
will not be countenanced, at least by him, because he is
looking the other way, and how can you countenance a
thing when you were facing the other way? Parse this
sentence to suit yourself.
3. Those desiring to swear will please sit in the first
eight rows. In the past there has been a lot of good
talent going to waste because of lack of concentration.
This ygar it is hoped to get the very best Stanford has
to offer in this important line of student activity out
in front.
4. Queeners will not be allowed to wear tuxedos, un
less they really want to.
5. Anyone calling a taxi from the Associated Press
phone in the Press Box will get his in the Sunday
Chronicle, and if you know? of anythfhg worse than
that, keep it to yourself.
6. California men are requested not to sit in the
Stanford rooting section, because it isn't fair to put us
on our company manners and make us look out for
guests when we are busy.
7. The. serpentine will start promptly at 5:15. The
well-dressed man will wear a Stanford rooter's hat.
* * ♦
What would a Big Game be without the good old get
together banquet the night before? Simply splendid.
But we must have banquets, and Cabbages would be the
last to hang back. We would rather shoot back. Ban
quets are gotten up by well-meaning alumni for the
purpose of getting together with the student body. They
lorget that most of the student body, a living group at
a time, has been earnestly trying to get together with
the alumni more or less constantly in matters financial
for the last thirty years.
The banquet always starts out with a few well-chosen
speeches and a vigorous search by the high-spirited
alumni for some undergraduate who can lead yells.
After awhile the undergraduate who can lead yells will
be found hiding under a napkin, and will be dragged
forth. The rest of the evening will be spent in giving
one yell after another with the impromptu yell leader
just keeping company. He is just there for appearances,
anyway, and what is better than a little spur-of-the
moment yelling like we used to yell in '99? When the
evening is half over the place will be fairly full of
impromptu yell leaders anyway, and the dukes will be
in for a drafty evening.
Well, eleven o'clock the passes (the lino
typer was supposed to put an accent over that "e" so as
to make it sound ''passays," which makes a pretty fair
pun out of it) will be congregated down in the lobby.
