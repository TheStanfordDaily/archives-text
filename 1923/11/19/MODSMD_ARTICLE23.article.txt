"THE VICTOR," Stanford Theater, Monday.
Herbert Rawlinson at his best; which is about like
saying a rotten egg at its sweetest. It is all right if you
like Rawlinson . . . we don't.

"THE GOLD DIGGERS," Varsity, Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday.
Judgment suspended until tonight's showing. We are
going to risk our thirty cents; why not you?

"GOING UP," with Douglas Mac Lean. Stanford Theater,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
About Wednesday, interest in pictures is going to
wane in favor of a more gripping exhibition at Berkeley
Saturday. This is just the sort of picture to amuse the
nervous multitudes, who are waiting for the pop of the
timer's gun Saturday.
Mac Lean has done better. "Forty-Eight Hours' Leave,"
for example. But if this were his worst, it's a darn sight
better than some other's best —if you get what we mean.
If a picture fan, you do.
The start drags. Things don't get going at all. The
plot must be built, of course, but we wish he had had
a little more fun in building it. But the picture, in that
respect, is like one of those roller-coaster thing., you've
ridden on. Takes quite a while to pull the car up the
incline, but when it's there things start happening. Fast.
Takes your breath away. What's on the advertising pro
gram is true for once. See it. We don't guarantee you'll
like it. But we hope«so. Just for your sense of humor's
sake. I
