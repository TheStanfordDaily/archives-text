<$> C. N. II <}>
One Sunday a lot of
sightseers came to
a university in a
big rubberneck bus.
They wanted to see
some real, honest
to-goodness college
boysâ€”the kind that
smoke bulldog pipes,
play mandolins all
day and put cows in
the deans' offices.
And they said so
to their guide.
So he showed them the
campus. But all the
students seemed to
have disappeared.
They must be at the
chapel, thought the
visitors. The guide
said no, and led
them to the library.
There they saw a room
filled with normal
young men who were
studying. College
boys, they were told.
