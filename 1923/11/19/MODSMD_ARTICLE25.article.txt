# Dr. McCall to Speak on Illusion of Peace and War
## 
### 
Dr. Oswald \V. S. McCall is to give
his third campus lecture on "Peace by
Warâ€”Another Great Illusion!" tonight
at 7 :30 in the Memorial church.
Though each address is a complete talk
in itself, all of the six are bound together
by a common objective. The general title
of the series is "Christ or Armageddon."
"When I have finished my talks, I hope
that my audience will feel that they were
not entirely unrelated, hut are really
cumulative," said Dr. McCall.
