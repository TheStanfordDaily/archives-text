### 
Future literary geniuses are now hav
ing their work published in the Gridiron,
a magazine issued by merrfl>ers of Mrs.
Russell's advanced composition class. The
first volume of the Gridiron was pub
| lished ten years ago, and received its
) name from Mrs. Russell for two reasons :
It signified a battle of wits analogous to
j a contest on the gridiron, and it meant
i the gridiron upon which one was roasted
I if mistakes were seen in his composition.
Many of the former students of the
j University who had articles in the maga
zine are now becoming famous in the
i literary world. Among them are journal
ists writing for New York papers, and
; one who is doing critical work for a
I London newspaper. Others are travel
! ing about the world writing for maga
zines, and some have been writing and
j publishing verse.
Among the local representatives of for
mer Gridiron fame are Marjorie Driscoll
; of the San Francisco Call, Ed Kneasa of
i the United Press in San Francisco, and
Eleanor Cogswell, assistant editor of the
' Palo Alto Times.
The Gridiron is published twice a quar-
I ter, and is composed of compositions se
: Iccted by a board of editors on which
every member of the class serves for
two weeks.
Mrs. Russell intends to edit, as an
example of college composition Work, a
; volume containing the best material of all
the Gridirons, at some future date when
sin is not actively engaged as a professor
