# VARSITY LOOKS GOOD IN 17-7 WIN OVER VANDALS
## Idaho Air Game Falls Short Near Goal Line; Nevers May Be Able To Start California Game 
### William Wright 
Out-passed by the Vandals during
most of the game, the Cardinal var
sity rose supreme in the pinches and
forward-passed its way to a 17 to 7
victory in the stadium Saturday.
Idaho's aerial offensive was nearly
! perfect—in mid-field. Inside the 20-
| yard line the Stanford secondary de
fense smothered the would-be receiv
| ers with one exception, and that ex
: ception was Idaho's touchdown.
Idaho passed 23 times, completed an
! even dozen, netted 118 yards, and
; made one touchdown. The Cards tried
five and completed three, one for no
gain and two for 35 yards and an
immediate touchdown. The Vandals
have a beautiful and spectacular pass
ing game, but Stanford got all the
percentage.
Ernie Nevers got off a 75-yard punt,
hit the line for the first score, and
then was assisted from the field with
the ligaments torn from several ribs.
He is expected to leave the hospital
today or tomorrow, and may be able
to play almost his usual game against
California Saturday.
Fitzke (who, by the way, is the
back-bone and heavy artillery of the
Vandal eleven), kicked off to Cudde-
I back, who returned 15 yards. The first
ten minutes of the game were monopo
lized by a punting duel between

Nevers and Fitzke, with the honors
going to the big blonde Redshirfc, de
spite the fact that Idaho's ends were
covering so well that Captain Camp
bell was unable to get away for his
usual long returns. Both teams made
tentative stabs at the line without
much success, and waited for the
other to break the ice.
Cuddeback cracked it by circling an
end for nine yards, and Nevers broke
through guard for 15. Cuddeback
reeled off five more, and the Idaho
defense stiffened. "Cuddy" then tried
a kick from placement on the 42-yard
line, but the ball went low. Fitzke
punted to Campbell, who returned
eight yards.
The Cards made yardage once, and
were turned back. Cuddeback missed
another long place kick, and Stivers
kicked out of bounds.
Nevers and Cuddeback pounded out
15 yards between them, and then
"Cuddy" dropped back and lobbed a
pass to Campbell, away over on one
end. The Scotchman sprinted 35 yards,
but finally out-ran his interference
and was brought down on the Vandal's
three-yard stripe. On the following
play Thomas, Loomis, and Neill broke
Idaho wide open, and Nevers galloped
through the breach for a touchdown.
Cuddeback converted.
The Vandals promptly launched a
