# VARSITY LOOKS GOOD IN 17-7 WIN OVER VANDALS
## Idaho Air Game Falls Short Near Goal Line; Nevers May Be Able To Start California Game 
### William Wright 
Out-passed by the Vandals during
most of the game, the Cardinal var
sity rose supreme in the pinches and
forward-passed its way to a 17 to 7
victory in the stadium Saturday.
Idaho's aerial offensive was nearly
! perfect—in mid-field. Inside the 20-
| yard line the Stanford secondary de
fense smothered the would-be receiv
| ers with one exception, and that ex
: ception was Idaho's touchdown.
Idaho passed 23 times, completed an
! even dozen, netted 118 yards, and
; made one touchdown. The Cards tried
five and completed three, one for no
gain and two for 35 yards and an
immediate touchdown. The Vandals
have a beautiful and spectacular pass
ing game, but Stanford got all the
percentage.
Ernie Nevers got off a 75-yard punt,
hit the line for the first score, and
then was assisted from the field with
the ligaments torn from several ribs.
He is expected to leave the hospital
today or tomorrow, and may be able
to play almost his usual game against
California Saturday.
Fitzke (who, by the way, is the
back-bone and heavy artillery of the
Vandal eleven), kicked off to Cudde-
I back, who returned 15 yards. The first
ten minutes of the game were monopo
lized by a punting duel between

Nevers and Fitzke, with the honors
going to the big blonde Redshirfc, de
spite the fact that Idaho's ends were
covering so well that Captain Camp
bell was unable to get away for his
usual long returns. Both teams made
tentative stabs at the line without
much success, and waited for the
other to break the ice.
Cuddeback cracked it by circling an
end for nine yards, and Nevers broke
through guard for 15. Cuddeback
reeled off five more, and the Idaho
defense stiffened. "Cuddy" then tried
a kick from placement on the 42-yard
line, but the ball went low. Fitzke
punted to Campbell, who returned
eight yards.
The Cards made yardage once, and
were turned back. Cuddeback missed
another long place kick, and Stivers
kicked out of bounds.
Nevers and Cuddeback pounded out
15 yards between them, and then
"Cuddy" dropped back and lobbed a
pass to Campbell, away over on one
end. The Scotchman sprinted 35 yards,
but finally out-ran his interference
and was brought down on the Vandal's
three-yard stripe. On the following
play Thomas, Loomis, and Neill broke
Idaho wide open, and Nevers galloped
through the breach for a touchdown.
Cuddeback converted.
The Vandals promptly launched a
counter-offensive, beginning with
Fitzke's 25-yard dash around end, and
ending when the Redshirts held with
in the 5-yard line and Nevers punted
out from behind his own goal line.
Fitzke went around end for 15, and
Nevers was injured in making the
tackle, being replaced by Solomon.
The Vandals marched steadily to the
goal line, making most of their gains
through the air with line-bucks scat
tered with an occasional end run.
Stivers passed to Fitzke for 10 yards
and the touchdown. Fitzke converted,
tying the score.
With "Porky" Dwight almost hold
ing his own in punting against Fitzke,
the rest of the first half was fairly
evenly balanced. The Cards cut loose
with a passing game in the closing
minutes, but only one toss was com
pleted and that for no gain.
Dwight kicked off to open the sec
ond half, and Stanford went into ac
tion. Fitzke punted off to Campbell,
who returned 10 yards. Gains by
Campbell, Solomon, and Dennis
brought the ball to Idaho's 18-yard
line, and on fourth down Cuddeback
registered a perfect goal from place
ment, standing on the 25-yard mark.
Stanford led, 10 to 7.
Another punting session followed
Cuddeback's kick-off, and Idaho was
forced far back into her own terri
tory. The Vandals launched a hail of
forward passes, but the Stanford sec
ondary defense was learning the trick
of it, and only one, for a 15-yard gain,
was completed. Then Campbell inter
cepted one of tliem on Idaho's 45-
yard line, and the Cards were off
again.
Cuddeback was thrown for an eight
yard loss, but Solomon contributed 11
on two plunges. On fourth down, for
the second time this season, the
Scotchman ordered a screened pass,
Cuddeback to Campbell, and
"Scotchy" snagged it just about on
the line of scrimmage. He lit out for
the Idaho goal line, 35 yards away,
and nobody was good enough to stop
him. Cuddeback converted for a fairly
safe lead of 17 to 7.
The rest of the game was a succes
sion of Idaho passes, Stanford punts,
and more passes. The Vandals were
not completing consistently, but when
they did it usually meant yardage,
and the Cards never stiffened until
the ballw ia adsnegosrutaoinshrdlut
the ball was dangerously close. An
other Idaho score was narrowly avert
ed when Stivers' pass went just over
Davsion's head on the 3-yard line, bat
most of the tosses were so long that
the Card back had plenty of time to
get under them and knock them down.
The game ended with Campbell and
Cuddeback gaining through Idaho's
line.

and more passes. The Vandals were
not completing consistently, but when
they did it usually meant yardage,
and the Cards never stiffened until
the ballw ia adsnegosrutaoinshrdlut
the ball was dangerously close. An
other Idaho score was narrowly avert

Davsion's head on the 3-yard line, bat
most of the tosses were so long that
the Card back had plenty of time to
get under them and knock them down.
The game ended with Campbell and

Out-passed by the Vandals during
most of the game, the Cardinal var
sity rose supreme in the pinches and
forward-passed its way to a 17 to 7
victory in the stadium Saturday.
Idaho's aerial offensive was nearly
! perfect—in mid-field. Inside the 20-
| yard line the Stanford secondary de
fense smothered the would-be receiv
| ers with one exception, and that ex
: ception was Idaho's touchdown.
Idaho passed 23 times, completed an
! even dozen, netted 118 yards, and
; made one touchdown. The Cards tried
five and completed three, one for no
gain and two for 35 yards and an
immediate touchdown. The Vandals
have a beautiful and spectacular pass
ing game, but Stanford got all the
percentage.
Ernie Nevers got off a 75-yard punt,
hit the line for the first score, and
then was assisted from the field with
the ligaments torn from several ribs.
He is expected to leave the hospital
today or tomorrow, and may be able
to play almost his usual game against
California Saturday.
Fitzke (who, by the way, is the
back-bone and heavy artillery of the
Vandal eleven), kicked off to Cudde-
I back, who returned 15 yards. The first
ten minutes of the game were monopo
lized by a punting duel between

Nevers and Fitzke, with the honors
going to the big blonde Redshirfc, de
spite the fact that Idaho's ends were
covering so well that Captain Camp
bell was unable to get away for his
usual long returns. Both teams made
tentative stabs at the line without
much success, and waited for the
other to break the ice.
Cuddeback cracked it by circling an
end for nine yards, and Nevers broke
through guard for 15. Cuddeback
reeled off five more, and the Idaho
defense stiffened. "Cuddy" then tried
a kick from placement on the 42-yard
line, but the ball went low. Fitzke
punted to Campbell, who returned
eight yards.
The Cards made yardage once, and
were turned back. Cuddeback missed
another long place kick, and Stivers
kicked out of bounds.
Nevers and Cuddeback pounded out
15 yards between them, and then
"Cuddy" dropped back and lobbed a
pass to Campbell, away over on one
end. The Scotchman sprinted 35 yards,
but finally out-ran his interference
and was brought down on the Vandal's
three-yard stripe. On the following
play Thomas, Loomis, and Neill broke
Idaho wide open, and Nevers galloped
through the breach for a touchdown.
Cuddeback converted.
The Vandals promptly launched a
counter-offensive, beginning with
Fitzke's 25-yard dash around end, and
ending when the Redshirts held with
in the 5-yard line and Nevers punted
out from behind his own goal line.
Fitzke went around end for 15, and
Nevers was injured in making the
tackle, being replaced by Solomon.
The Vandals marched steadily to the
goal line, making most of their gains
through the air with line-bucks scat
tered with an occasional end run.
Stivers passed to Fitzke for 10 yards
and the touchdown. Fitzke converted,
tying the score.
With "Porky" Dwight almost hold
ing his own in punting against Fitzke,
the rest of the first half was fairly
evenly balanced. The Cards cut loose
with a passing game in the closing
minutes, but only one toss was com
pleted and that for no gain.
Dwight kicked off to open the sec
ond half, and Stanford went into ac
tion. Fitzke punted off to Campbell,
who returned 10 yards. Gains by
Campbell, Solomon, and Dennis
brought the ball to Idaho's 18-yard
line, and on fourth down Cuddeback
registered a perfect goal from place
ment, standing on the 25-yard mark.
Stanford led, 10 to 7.
Another punting session followed
Cuddeback's kick-off, and Idaho was
forced far back into her own terri
tory. The Vandals launched a hail of
forward passes, but the Stanford sec
ondary defense was learning the trick
of it, and only one, for a 15-yard gain,
was completed. Then Campbell inter
cepted one of tliem on Idaho's 45-
yard line, and the Cards were off
again.
Cuddeback was thrown for an eight
yard loss, but Solomon contributed 11
on two plunges. On fourth down, for
the second time this season, the
Scotchman ordered a screened pass,
Cuddeback to Campbell, and
"Scotchy" snagged it just about on
the line of scrimmage. He lit out for
the Idaho goal line, 35 yards away,
and nobody was good enough to stop
him. Cuddeback converted for a fairly
safe lead of 17 to 7.

evenly balanced. The Cards cut loose
with a passing game in the closing
minutes, but only one toss was com
pleted and that for no gain.
Dwight kicked off to open the sec
ond half, and Stanford went into ac
tion. Fitzke punted off to Campbell,
who returned 10 yards. Gains by
Campbell, Solomon, and Dennis
brought the ball to Idaho's 18-yard
line, and on fourth down Cuddeback
registered a perfect goal from place
ment, standing on the 25-yard mark.
Stanford led, 10 to 7.
Another punting session followed
Cuddeback's kick-off, and Idaho was
forced far back into her own terri
tory. The Vandals launched a hail of
forward passes, but the Stanford sec
ondary defense was learning the trick
of it, and only one, for a 15-yard gain,
was completed. Then Campbell inter
cepted one of tliem on Idaho's 45-
yard line, and the Cards were off
again.
Cuddeback was thrown for an eight
yard loss, but Solomon contributed 11
on two plunges. On fourth down, for
the second time this season, the
Scotchman ordered a screened pass,
Cuddeback to Campbell, and
"Scotchy" snagged it just about on
the line of scrimmage. He lit out for
the Idaho goal line, 35 yards away,
and nobody was good enough to stop
him. Cuddeback converted for a fairly
safe lead of 17 to 7.
The rest of the game was a succes
sion of Idaho passes, Stanford punts,
and more passes. The Vandals were
not completing consistently, but when
they did it usually meant yardage,
and the Cards never stiffened until
the ballw ia adsnegosrutaoinshrdlut
the ball was dangerously close. An
other Idaho score was narrowly avert
ed when Stivers' pass went just over
Davsion's head on the 3-yard line, bat
most of the tosses were so long that
the Card back had plenty of time to
get under them and knock them down.
The game ended with Campbell and
Cuddeback gaining through Idaho's
line.

Out-passed by the Vandals during
most of the game, the Cardinal var

forward-passed its way to a 17 to 7
victory in the stadium Saturday.
Idaho's aerial offensive was nearly

fense smothered the would-be receiv

: ception was Idaho's touchdown.
Idaho passed 23 times, completed an
! even dozen, netted 118 yards, and
; made one touchdown. The Cards tried
five and completed three, one for no
gain and two for 35 yards and an
immediate touchdown. The Vandals
have a beautiful and spectacular pass
ing game, but Stanford got all the
percentage.
Ernie Nevers got off a 75-yard punt,
hit the line for the first score, and
then was assisted from the field with
the ligaments torn from several ribs.
He is expected to leave the hospital
today or tomorrow, and may be able
to play almost his usual game against
California Saturday.
Fitzke (who, by the way, is the
back-bone and heavy artillery of the
Vandal eleven), kicked off to Cudde-
I back, who returned 15 yards. The first
ten minutes of the game were monopo
lized by a punting duel between

Nevers and Fitzke, with the honors
going to the big blonde Redshirfc, de
spite the fact that Idaho's ends were
covering so well that Captain Camp
bell was unable to get away for his
usual long returns. Both teams made
tentative stabs at the line without
much success, and waited for the
other to break the ice.
Cuddeback cracked it by circling an
end for nine yards, and Nevers broke
through guard for 15. Cuddeback
reeled off five more, and the Idaho
defense stiffened. "Cuddy" then tried
a kick from placement on the 42-yard
line, but the ball went low. Fitzke
punted to Campbell, who returned
eight yards.
The Cards made yardage once, and
were turned back. Cuddeback missed
another long place kick, and Stivers
kicked out of bounds.
Nevers and Cuddeback pounded out
15 yards between them, and then
"Cuddy" dropped back and lobbed a
pass to Campbell, away over on one
end. The Scotchman sprinted 35 yards,
but finally out-ran his interference
and was brought down on the Vandal's
three-yard stripe. On the following
play Thomas, Loomis, and Neill broke
Idaho wide open, and Nevers galloped
through the breach for a touchdown.
Cuddeback converted.
The Vandals promptly launched a
counter-offensive, beginning with
Fitzke's 25-yard dash around end, and
ending when the Redshirts held with
in the 5-yard line and Nevers punted
out from behind his own goal line.
Fitzke went around end for 15, and
Nevers was injured in making the
tackle, being replaced by Solomon.
The Vandals marched steadily to the
goal line, making most of their gains
through the air with line-bucks scat
tered with an occasional end run.
Stivers passed to Fitzke for 10 yards
and the touchdown. Fitzke converted,
tying the score.
With "Porky" Dwight almost hold

the rest of the first half was fairly

defense stiffened. "Cuddy" then tried
a kick from placement on the 42-yard
line, but the ball went low. Fitzke
punted to Campbell, who returned
eight yards.
The Cards made yardage once, and
were turned back. Cuddeback missed
another long place kick, and Stivers
kicked out of bounds.
Nevers and Cuddeback pounded out
15 yards between them, and then
"Cuddy" dropped back and lobbed a
pass to Campbell, away over on one
end. The Scotchman sprinted 35 yards,
but finally out-ran his interference
and was brought down on the Vandal's
three-yard stripe. On the following
play Thomas, Loomis, and Neill broke
Idaho wide open, and Nevers galloped
through the breach for a touchdown.
Cuddeback converted.
The Vandals promptly launched a
counter-offensive, beginning with
Fitzke's 25-yard dash around end, and
ending when the Redshirts held with
in the 5-yard line and Nevers punted
out from behind his own goal line.
Fitzke went around end for 15, and
Nevers was injured in making the
tackle, being replaced by Solomon.
The Vandals marched steadily to the
goal line, making most of their gains
through the air with line-bucks scat
tered with an occasional end run.
Stivers passed to Fitzke for 10 yards
and the touchdown. Fitzke converted,
tying the score.
With "Porky" Dwight almost hold
ing his own in punting against Fitzke,
the rest of the first half was fairly
evenly balanced. The Cards cut loose
with a passing game in the closing
minutes, but only one toss was com
pleted and that for no gain.
Dwight kicked off to open the sec
ond half, and Stanford went into ac
tion. Fitzke punted off to Campbell,
who returned 10 yards. Gains by
Campbell, Solomon, and Dennis
brought the ball to Idaho's 18-yard
line, and on fourth down Cuddeback
registered a perfect goal from place
ment, standing on the 25-yard mark.
Stanford led, 10 to 7.
Another punting session followed
Cuddeback's kick-off, and Idaho was
forced far back into her own terri
tory. The Vandals launched a hail of
forward passes, but the Stanford sec
ondary defense was learning the trick
of it, and only one, for a 15-yard gain,
was completed. Then Campbell inter
cepted one of tliem on Idaho's 45-
yard line, and the Cards were off
again.
Cuddeback was thrown for an eight
yard loss, but Solomon contributed 11
on two plunges. On fourth down, for
the second time this season, the
Scotchman ordered a screened pass,
Cuddeback to Campbell, and
"Scotchy" snagged it just about on
the line of scrimmage. He lit out for
the Idaho goal line, 35 yards away,
and nobody was good enough to stop
him. Cuddeback converted for a fairly
safe lead of 17 to 7.
The rest of the game was a succes
sion of Idaho passes, Stanford punts,
and more passes. The Vandals were
not completing consistently, but when
they did it usually meant yardage,
and the Cards never stiffened until
the ballw ia adsnegosrutaoinshrdlut
the ball was dangerously close. An
other Idaho score was narrowly avert
ed when Stivers' pass went just over
Davsion's head on the 3-yard line, bat
most of the tosses were so long that
the Card back had plenty of time to
get under them and knock them down.
The game ended with Campbell and
Cuddeback gaining through Idaho's
line.
