## 
### 
Three picture rolls illustrating the life
of Tokugawa Iyeyasu, first shogun of
the Tokugawa dynasty in Japan, have
been received by the Stanford library as
a gift from Mrs. David Starr Jordan.
The originals of these pictures were
painted by Kano Tanyuo, last of the
| famous Kano school of classical art.
Depict Founder's Life
It is the life story of the founder of
| the great dynasty that is told in the pic
tures. They begin with his birth as an
aristocrat, depict his long struggle to
gain the power to rule, and cuLminate in
j his brief reign from 1600 to 1616.
The pictures as found as mural paint
i ings in one of thirty buildings. They
ings in one of the thity buildings. They
j are a work of most elaborate description
:on which the famous artist, Kano
j Tanyuo, spent five years. The paintings
I were dotie by special order of the third
I shogun. Tokugawa Iyemitsu, the hero's
grandson.
I The last of this famous family, Kano
Tani|uo, was a very versatile and orig
i inal type of man, and his work has left a
I permanent impress on the architecture,
painting, sculpture, and decorative art of
Japan. The pictures illustrating the life
oi the shogun were his own creation, and
many of the artistic effects of the temple
buildings were obtained under his direc
tion.
Before the Meiji restoration of 1868,
the pictures were inspected by successive
shoguns on the occasion of their periodi
cal visits to the temples at N'ikko, but no
other persons .were permitted to view
them. Quite recently the pictures were
registered among the national treasures
oi Japan.
The Stanford pictures, which were
given to Mrs. Jordan by Viscount Eir
chin Shibusawa in 1915, are mounted on
three rolls. The Japanese explanations
have been omitted and the rolls are ac
companied by a brief English version of
I the descriptions contained in the orig
inal.
