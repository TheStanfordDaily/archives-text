# SPONSORS ADDRESS FRESHMAN PROTEGES AT ENCINA MEETING
## 
### 
Five sponsors addressed their pro
teges in Encina hall last night. J. H.
Smith, "Kewp" Sproull, Bill Leiser,
George Baker, and "Peabody" Cleave
land talked to the freshmen.
Smith asked the first-year men to
get into closer touch with the spon
sors. "You fellows should come to us
with your troubles," he said. "The main
thing is to get your studies. That's
what you're here for."
Sproull told the freshmen to ob
serve the two main things of hitting
the books and going out for some ac
tivity. "Then come the traditions," he
said. "These traditions are for the
purpose of getting new men out of
the senior-in-high-school idea. "They're
easy to learn, and should cause you
fellows no trouble." He told the fresh
men of the agreement with California
regarding invasions of the rival cam
puses, and warned them against paint
ing the "C."
Leiser's talk was chiefly on the
workings of the freshman house com
mittee, which will have all of the
powers over the freshmen that the
old Encina house committee had.
Baker explained the relations be
tween the freshmen and the student
council. Cleaveland urged the fresh
men to study harder, and reported that
an unusually large number of "smoke
ups" had been sent out to members
of the class of '27.
