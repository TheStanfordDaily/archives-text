# ATTITUDE TOWARD LIFE IS TOPIC OF ASSEMBLY SPEAKER
## Song Practice for Big Game To Precede Lecture by Professor Smith 
### 
"A Personal Attitude Toward Life,"
as conceived by Professor A. W.
Smith, former member of the Stan
ford department of mechanical engi
neering, will be discussed by him at
the University assembly tomorrow
at 10 o'clock.
Before the lecture, the Glee Club
will lead a practice of songs for the !
California game. All members of the
club are asked to take the reserved
seats in the front of the auditorium.
Professor Smith is the author of
the words of "Hail, Stanford, Hail,"
written while he was a member of
the Stanford faculty. He was here,
from 1892 to 1904. He has always been
interested in literary work and com- i
posed several songs for Cornell during
his years of teaching there. It has
been said that he is more interested
in literary than mechanical construc
tion.
He served as acting president of
Cornell for a year. Previous to this,
he was dean of Sibley College, the
mechanical and electrical engineering
school of Cornell. Smith retired from
the faculty thore in 1921.
Since that time he has been writing
a biography of Professor John E. i
Sweet, formerly of Corn-ell, one of the
founders and the past president of
the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers. This hook is now on the
press.
Professor Smith is spending the
winter in Palo Alto with a life-long
friend, Professor C. D. Marx, of the
civil engineering department. The two
we're classmates at Cornell, both being
graduated in 1878.
