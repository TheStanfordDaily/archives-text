# DICKENS DID NOT EXAGGERATE IN DEPICTION OF HUMAN NATURE, CLAIMS DRAMATIC ARTIST
## 
### 
Dickens did not exaggerate ii'i his de
piction of human nature, is the opinion
of Frank ( . Thompson, character artist,"
who gave readings of famous literary
types last week. "All of us have our
peculiarities, and Dickens merely gives
us an insight into some which we never
see in ourselves.
"I believe Dickens had a real purpose
in writing the stories he did," Thompson
explained. "Dickens wanted to accomp
lish some reform by projecting a strong
character upon the page, to represent lii>
ideas. Like Shakespeare or the Bible, any
page of his writings is filled with inter
esting characters.
"School children usually think Dickens
dry reading. That is a great deal the

fault of the way literature is taught them.
Dickens' worths are not merely high
brow and full of amusing character
sketches, but also ebbing, flowing life.
The personalities of Traddles and Stcer
forth in David Coppcrfield show his un
derstanding of human nature, lie traces
the development of their characters from
the time they are in school on through
their lines, analyzing their individual
traits.
"Most people do not see the deeper
significance of Dickens' portrayals,"
Thompson maintains. The average audi
ence especially one composed of men, pre
fers comedy to pathos, Mrs. Micawber to
little F.mily."
