# Roughs' Day Postponed Until Thursday Because Of University Assembly
## 
### 
Roughs' Day has been postponed
from tomorrow until Thursday on ac
count of the University Assembly ar
ranged for 10 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. The change was made last night
after Professor E. E. Robinson, in
charge of assemblies, protested that
he had been told Roughs' Day would
be on Thursday and had carefully
avoided that date in setting the time
for this week's student gathering. The
agreement to change the time for
Roughs' Day came after Burt Lapp
had discussed the situation carefully
with Professor Robinson.
Members of the Senior Control Com
mittee, which has Roughs' Day in
charge, will visit the various fraternity
houses and men's living groups to give
detailed information on the rules and
regulations for the festive occasion.
The talks before the living groups
will be made either tonight or tomor
row night and questions as to the
proper costumes and actions permit
ted on that day can be referred to
