# ETIQUETTE REVISED TO MEET FOOTBALL MENACE ON LASUEN
## 
### 
Footballs make it advisable to
change established rules of eitiquette!
It has always been the custom for a
man when walking with a woman to
take the outside of the street, but the
old position must be reversed on the
Row now and the man must walk on
the inside.
This is made necessary for protec
tive purposes, since several women re
port they have received rather severe
jolts the last few days from footballs
bouncing around the fraternity lawns.
And, of course, the only chivalrous
thing left for the gentleman to do
under the circumstances is to station
himself as a shield to meet the on
slaught, and receive all bumps and
blows in a manly manner!!!
