# HOCKEY TEAMS HOLD ELIMINATION MATCHES FOR GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
By popular vote, Stanford hockey
players decided to send to the Mills
game Saturday the upperclass and
the underclass hockey teams which
prove themselves strongest in scrim
mage this week.
For a while the coaches considered
sending the two teams, juniors and
freshmen, which did not compete in
the California games, so that all
squads would have the benefit of ex-'
perience in intercollegiate games. i
Elimination games are being played;
this afternoon between the seniors
and juniors, and the freshmen and
sophomores. In the practices last week;
the seniors and sophomores came out
ahead and if they should win by de
cisive scores today they will be
chosen without further interclass|
scrimmage to play Mills.
However, if the scores are close!
enough so that there is doubt as to
which are the better teams, the suc-J
cessful squads will not be chosen until;
after second competition matches to-j
morrow afternoon.
