# ODDS IN FAVOR OF CALIFORNIA NEXT SATURDAY
## Bears Only Undefeated Team On Coast; Nevers Will Be In Shape for Big Game 
### 
California will enter the Big Game
next Saturday backed by a reputa
tion of three years of championships,
besides the fact that it remains the
only undefeated team in the Pacific
Coast Conference. Stanford will op
pose California as a team "which has
arrived" in football circles, and with
only a defeat by the Trojans to mar
an otherwise clean sweep.
The Bears are conceded an edge.
Headlined to be a has-been team at
the beginning of the season they have
shown enough force to beat strong
teams.
Stanford is conceded a chance to
defeat California. Some difference to
the condescension of two years ago,
when the Cards were doomed to de
feat and the betting was all on wheth
er or not Stanford could score!
Stanford against Idaho showed a
powerful defensive ability, and a
strong offensive which was effective
enough to beat the Vandals at their
own game. Idaho's passing offensive
was the best that has been seen on
the Coast for a great while, but it
failed to penetrate the Card defense
