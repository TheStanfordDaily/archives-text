# FAILURE OF WAR TO BRING WORLD PEACE STRESSED BY McCALL
## 
### 
"That by the use of the sword we
may carve out a world of peace is an
illusion.
"There is a sleeping pugnacity in
herent in all human beings which is
awakened by war, for the attitude of
the fighter brings the feelings of the
fighter," said Dr. Oswald W. S. Mc-
Call in his third lecture, "Peace by
Warâ€”Another Great Illusion!" last
night in'the Memorial Church.
"History should have taught us that
the ending of war is always disap
pointing. But we are unable to think
clearly in times of strife and stress."
McCall likened the war prevention
problem to the question of rebuilding
Berkeley houses with wooden or fire
proof roofs. During the fire, houses
may have been dynamited unnecessar
ily, he said, but the business now at
hand is to guard against the future.
Likewise, now is the time for a fresh
construction of the world, for tomor
row the sparks mya fly again.
