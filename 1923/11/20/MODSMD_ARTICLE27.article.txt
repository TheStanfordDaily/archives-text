# The 						Freshman Pyre
## 
### 
After a few more boxes and a little lubrication
have been added to the freshman bonfire, the Class
of '27 will be ready to stand back and say: "There
it is; how do you like it?"
When that happens, the Daily Palo Alto wants
to be the first to congratulate the freshmen on their
efforts, which have resulted, without sophomore
slave-driving, in erection of the biggest prye for the
Golden Bear the campus has yet seen.
The bonfire is really a small thing, one of the
incidents in the surge of progress on the campus
this quarter. But when one considers that this
same freshman class put a football team on the field
which defeated the California freshmen so badly it
will take four years for them to recover from the
blow; that this same class of new arrivals, after
living six weeks in Encina hall under conditions
totally new and strange to them, have organized
their affairs to such good purpose that things are
running smoothly and easily in the freshman dormi
tory, the fact that the freshmen sometimes forget
themselves and do not carry matches for the con
venience of lazy upperclassmen is a small matter.
In the short space of time they have been on the
Farm, the freshmen seem to have swung into line
with the true Stanford spirit of progress and better
ment.
If the freshman class had not felt this influence
and had not successfully climbed aboard the boat,
seniors and juniors would not today be looking with
surprise on a freshman bonfire fully ten feet higher
than the biggest structure they can remember.
