# The 						Day of the Rough
## 
### 
Stanford is to witness another Roughs' Day on
Thursday, this time, we hope, with less of the re
grettable lapses into hoodlumism which dis
tinguished last year's affair. How much the men
with South-of-Market instincts will be able to re
strain themselves under the anual threat of punish
ment will determine whether there will be another
Roughs' Day after this one is passed.
Fundamentally, we believe that the idea under
lying Roughs' Day is, wrong in principle, no matter
how restrained it may be this year in practice.
It is practically a permit to a large section of the
student body to do a little of what they know is not
ordinarily countenanced in decent society. llow far
they may go in fracturing of the law of common
sense is left to their own discretion. Unfortunately,
several people proved last year that they left their
discretion at home with their regular clothes, and
felt themselves, in their disguise of hoodlums, able
to "get away with" as much rough talk and action
as they saw fit.
Roughs' Day, in principle, is an announcement to
certain elements that the roof is off, but must not
be raised too high.
We hope that those people who arc in the habit of
taking advantage of such announcements will not
make it necessary for another tradition, worthy or
not, to lie thrown into summary discard.

In compliance with a request from a joint com
mittee from Stanford and California, the Board of
Directors of the Pacific Coast Jockey Club has an
nounced the postponement of the Tanforan Derby
from Saturday until Sunday.
With the elimination of the horse races, which
was the only competitor of the Big Game, the
annual grid classic has the limelight. If the directors
of the Club attend the game, the Daily Palo Alto
believes that they will be fully repaid for their
kindness. —D. E. L.
