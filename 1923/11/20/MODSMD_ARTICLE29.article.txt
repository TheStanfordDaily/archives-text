Dear Cabbages:
You haven't answered my question yet!
I wanted to know why Stanford men rush just sixty
out of Five Hundred women. You said that if I signed
a promise never to break dates or substitute other girl 3,
or neglect my old friends, why, you'd give me a rush
like some o fthe stellar steppers of Stanford receive.
It's too funny! All, each, and every one, of those
stellar steppers break dates at the eleventh hour and
fifty-ninth second. It is they alone who can afford to
substitute one from the Four Hundred and Forty when
a more delectable date is proferrert. Only the star per
formers forget old friends. And it's queer as it is true
that these same snubbed friends grow more persistent
, . . one-wants what-one-can't-have, you know.
The qualifications you hold up as desirable, are the
very ones the Non-Steppers possess! Popular maidens,
the ones you like to take out most, do not. You like
to be .abused, you like to be mistreated . . . why, of
COURSE you do . . . or you all wouldn't keep coming
back to the Sixty for more.
I wanted to know why some of the Stanford men
won't trouble to discover new stars instead of gazing
raptly at the old? —PATTY GRAY.

I wish I had a magic ship,
With sails of rose and gold,
I'd cut my classes all today
And seek adventures bold.
I'd ride upon a dolphin's back
And race with purple whales,
I'd pillage mermaid's dresser drawers
To tie pink bows on minnows' tails.
Maybe I'd buy an air ship
And soar up very high
To take tea with the angels
And sample their celestial pie.
I'd teach Saint Peter how to golf
And swing upon the pearly gates.
Perhaps I'd stay indefinitely
If God would make me special rates!
