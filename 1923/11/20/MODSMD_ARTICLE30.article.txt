# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The communication following came to the attention of
the editor this morning. The Daily Palo Alto heartily agrees
ivith the writer that the freshmen should, perhaps, know
more about Stanford "traditions," and such customs as
survive from the age of collegiate foolishness, after having
lived at Stanford for six weeks. The editor is also heartly
in favor of the suggeston made by the writer that the
surzninng miscellany of traditions, whose usefulness passed
when the sophomore class decided that they no longer
wished to use them for their own personal "disciplinary"
amusement, should be done away u>ith and attention cen
tered 011 those customs whose advantages to Stanford
democracy are unquestioned.
Hoivever, in order to test some of the statements as to
freshman laxity, a freshman was asked to report upon the
"hello" situation on the Quad, which report he made to
the Daily office at noon today. The report, which may be
taken as an indictment against upperclass spirit or a prece
dent to freshmen for similar laxity, follows:
Upperclassmen who speak 60
Upperclassmen who don't 2
Freshmen who speak 75
Freshmen who don't 1
Remarks:
1. On the Quad, about half the people speak that pass.
2. Nearly everybody will speak if spoken to, but
upperclasmen are more apt to pass without speak
ing than freshmen.
3. Nearly always, when two people together are
spoken to, only one answers.

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
It is to be noted with regret that the various student
body presidents of the Pacific Coast Colleges have
unanimously adopted resolutions favoring the 'sponsor"
system of freshman discipline, as advocated, and re
cently put in practice by Stanford.
Before going on record too strongly in favor of such
a system, it would no doubt have been a wise move for
the assembled delegates attending the presidential con
clave to have spent a single morning on the Stanford
Quad.
However the proud inauguraters of the sponsor sys
tem may blind themselves to its deficiencies, the fact
remains that the class of '27 is rapidly getting out of
hand, if considered in the light of many time-honored
traditions —traditions which have made the Stanford
spirit what it is known to be. This statement may be
indisputably proven by considering statstics gathered
on the quad in a single day.
Out of 50 freshmen, met consecutively, 17 volunteered
a cheerful "hello."
Of 50 other freshmen, 26 were able to oblige the in
vestigator with matches.
Four groups of frosh were observed, between classes,
openly and unconcernedly "queening" on prominent
parts of the Quad.
It was noticed that six freshmen were spoken to as
regards wearing the distinguishing "dink;" and it is a
remarkable thing that so many were discerned to be
freshmen, for the large majority of the class have gone
"dinkless" for so long as to be generally identified with
our sophomores.
These instances simply and conclusively demonstrate
a situation painful in the extreme to those who have
been taught to respect such Stanford customs as were
once commonly observed by incoming classes. This
complainant would be the last person to recommend the
old-time "horseplay" hazing, as a system of discipline,
but there are several harmless, even admirable, customs
remaining on the "Farm," and so long as they remain
with us, let there be some means of constraining ob
servance of them.
On the other hand, if it be true that the majority of
us favor the complete abolition of the possibly inane
customs remaining to us after the decadence of a long
established system, let us have a strong, positive cam
paign to render the surviving miscellany of traditions
completely inoperative. But above all, let there be a
consistent policy regarding freshmen and freshman
discipline on this campus—may we do away with tradi
tion, or combine, as a unit, to enforce such freshman
regulations as wo may find advisable to continue.
