# Organ Recital
## 
### 
"Two Dramatic Pedal Studies" by
MacDougall will be included In the
program of the organ recital played by
Warren D. Allen in the Memorial
Church this afternoon.
One part is in the Handelian Style
and the other is in the Violoncello
Solo. Mr. MacDougall, of Wellesley
College, has written six studies of
real musical worth, in which the ped
al organ is assigned an unusual melo
dic importance.
The second number will be the
"Praeludium in F" by Jarnefelt. This
sprightly orchestral number by the
Finnish composer was arranged by
Gordon B. Nevin.
The "Evening Song" by Schumann
and the "Toccata from the Fifth Or
gan Symphony" by Widor will com
plete the program.
