# Rehearsals Commence On "Captain Applejack;" Technical Staff Chosen
## 
### 
Following the completion of cast
and technical appointments, rehears
ing has commenced for "Captain Ap
plejack," this year's sophomore play,
to be offered in the Assembly hall De
cember 7. Rehearsals will be held
from 7 to 10 o'clock every night this
week, except Friday and Saturday,
and the cast will remain on the cam
pus over the Thanksgiving vacation in
order to acquire the exacting finish
demanded by this "Arabian Nights
Adventure."
Miriam Ebright will play the role of
Mrs. Whatcomb, one of the principal
feminine parts of the cast, which was
not named after tryouts last week.
Davis has appointed John Dillman
property man for the 1926 production.
The art work will be directed by
Chrysella Dunker.
Alfrida Poco is in charge of the
costuming, which is of more than the
usual weight in this presentation. In
the first and last acts an elaborate
and gorgeous display of feminine ap-
parel is required, while the second act
demands the fitting out of a complete
pirate crew.
Cast Must Work
A considerable amount of hard work
is anticipated in the preparation of
"Captain Applejack" by Coach Davis,
not because the cast is raw, but for
the reason that the play demands both
brilliant acting and a clean-cut and
flawless production. The appearance
of matter-of-fact realism in this
comedy necessitates far more work
than does even the sensational drama
with its mob scenes, says Davis.
