### Oz, '23 
This might be called "In Pursuit
of the Scotch." Stephen Leacock, who
is a professor by decree of fate and
a writer of pleasing nonsense by
choice, has returned recently from
Scotland. He reports that on the na
tive heath of scHOOtCh mon whiskey
is anything but a beverage. The Scot
regards his whiskey with dignity and
imbibes it with the same feeling.
There are seventeen reasons for im
bibing: 1, because one is coming in
out of the weather; 2, because one is
going out into the weather; 3, because
it is raining; 4, because it has just
stopped running and, finally, 17, (the
best and most employed reason), be
cause it can do you nae harm nae how.

We must be a tremendously ig
norant lot for we are always discover
ing things that we didn't know ex
isted. The latest is that one may oc
casionally find pleasure in studying in
the Reference Room. We used to think
that the library was a place given
over wholly to librarians and queeners.
But 'tis not so, for we have found in
the biographies of Dupleix, and Clive,
and Babar tales that are as thrilling
as Stevenson, as romantic as Sabatini.
We found them on the reference
shelves of History 27.

Marionettes and Puppets
We have made an interesting dis
covery. We have learned that Marion
ettes are not diminutive Marions and
that puppets are decidedly not small
pups. They are, on the contrary, the
actors and actresses who provide the
casts for a distinctive branch of dra
matic art, the puppet shows.
Originating probably in Asia, these
inanimate actors and their plays and
theaters have spread to Europe and to
some degree to America. The Turks,
the Chinese, the Greeks, have their
puppet shows; the Javanese have
their wayangs, silhouettes projected
upon a screen.
The French have their guignols, the
English have their Punch and Judy.
In Italy the art of the puppet theater
has been developed to a very high
degree.
* * ♦
In America the greatest impetus
given to this type of art has come
from Tony Sarge, who has adapted the
Javanese wayang to the moving pic
ture screen. Sarg has also loaned his
personality to the development of this
art by presenting plays acted out by
his wire-controlled silhouettes, in sev
eral cities in this country.
On the Pacific coast Perry Dilley of
Los Angeles has made use of the
Italian burattini, a democratic carica
ture of humanity that possesses all of
the warmth of simple, deep, human
emotion. This type of puppet differs
from the marionette in that it is con
trolled entirely by the hand while the
other is controlled from above by
wires.

Although Richard Teschner, a Vien
ese artist, has brought forth the most
finished marionettes, it is in Czecho
slovakia that the puppet theater has
achieved its greatest significance.
Teschner has given to these inarticu
late little mannikins a grace of move
ment, a smoothness of operation that
closely rivals the grace of Pavlowa at
her best.

During the war, when Hapsburg
censors closed the movies, the thea
ters, and the concert halls; when
newspapers appeared, with columns
and even whole pages and editions
blank, the puppet shows continued,
and through the agency of a typical
Czech character, Kasparek, a wise,
gay, clear-thinking clown, kept up the
national spirit of the Bohemians, en
couraged them to revolutionary steps,
and prophesied the early collapse of
the Austrian monarchy. Kasparek
preached his gospel of independence
not only in Pilsen and Prague but car
ried the campaign into enemy country,
voicing his thoughts even in Sofia.
♦ * *
In 1918 there were in Czechoslo
vakia 1500 theaters devoted to puppet
plays. The National Minister of De
fense is introducing the art into the
army; the schools are using puppets
as a means of education; political and
social opinion is swayed by propa
ganda released in the public theaters.
Puppet shows are decidedly a national
institution, as much so as movies are
with us.
