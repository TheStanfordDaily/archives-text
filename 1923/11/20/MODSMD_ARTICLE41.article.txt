# STANFORD FOSTERS "LINES"
## Women Noted for Intriguing Conversation Adapted to Campus Queeners 
### 
A "line" is a closely-connected series !
of conglomerate utterances in such
form as to be audibly impressive to '
the listener, either favorably or other-1
wise.
Stanford women are noted for their
lines. They have every opportunity to
foster and nourish them on the
wealthy abundance of credulous male
beings on the Stanford "Farm." There
are several types of lines which fit
the several types of women. Every!
woman who is not literally dumb can
be considered to have a line, no ifTatter
how condensed, weak, effusive, or
sophisticated it may be.
The First-Time-Out Line
The girl who is out for the first
time with a man she has no affection
for, will probably say, "I don't think
there will be a dance tonight on ac
count ol' the show in the Assembly
hall," thereby hinting that she prefers
to t;«ke in said show. When the ho
goat refuses to yield to the plea. sh<>
adds, "And I forgot to tell you that I
must be in by 9:80 on week nights,
even Fridays. It is a new hous-j rule.
I'm sorry." This usually comes after!
she finds out how little she really likes
him.
She is usually the type who looks up
your record, place of residence at;
home and on the campus, your middle
name, and kids you about one or all
of them during the evening. "So you
come from Morgan Hill? How did I
guess it? Oh, a friend of yours told me
all about you." Then she springs the
Phi Bete record stuff, says she thinks
bla-bla-bla pins are the only kind, and
ends by spending the rest of the eve
ning on your middle name which you
can't help and never use.
She may also tell you what the sif
ters say about this or that man. Then,
after giving you the once-over twice,
she will state that her sisters think
the best men on the campus don't!
queen, that it is only the rough
"roughs" who try to "step out."
Freshman Woman's Attack
The freshman woman with whom:
you have the first date will tell you
how wonderful it is at Stanford and
what she has been doing to make it
seem wonderful. "You can't believe
how dates I've had. I've been
out every night but two since I arrived
on the campus, and I've turned down
four invitations to the Cotillion." This
gag is used usually with intent to pull
out an invitation which the freshette
can then refuse.
Another woman will bubble over and
tell you that you are the first Stanford
man she ever met and that her im
pression of him is quite favorable.
This is used only by those who try
to find out what kind of man they are
tampering with. Usually the women
on the campus maintain an astute si
lence until the men have broken the
ice with a wise crack or some more
or less conventional remark. Any!

woman, no matter of what type, will
give you a chance to show your hand
first, if you are a man. Then she will
be politely inquisitive but not confi
dentially communicative.
Talk About the Weather
Usually if the woman is left to her
own devices to make conversation or
oil the line, she will remark conven
tionally about college work, the
weather, music, or decorations—if it
is a dance. She may ask you about
your summer vacation. And she may
even surprise you and be one of the
few-and-far-between kind who is really
interested in what you have to say;
she will not look dead while you are
talking, and she will not interrupt you
in your choicest narrative to tell you
about hockey, shin guards, and train
ing rules.
There are plenty of gold-diggers on
the campus who have a mo&i alluring
line. The "2200" are here for them to
play with and they start with a rush
of words pleading for a "nice little
drive to Monterey where you can get
such wonderful ahalone steaks at Pop
Ernst's on the ocean." The doe on
dancing and if you can't dance at
Pop's you can go to the Highland Inn.
Makes You Value a Date
Then the girl who desires to make
you value your date by placing a high
value on herself in her own opinion.
She politely asks where it was she
met you before, and you have only
been introduced to her three times
already. And another type starts in by
telling you how much she has heard of
you. She has always wanted to meet
you. "When I saw your name on my
program I knew it could be no one
else. 1 feel as if I had known you a
long time." This is rather flattering
until she tells you how many dates
she has fixed up for scores of other
fellows who call up at the last minute;
she ends by making you feel that she
has asked you to patronize her queen
ing agency.
Study, Weather, Popular Topics
College work and the weather are
the two most used topics of women's
lines. Women never fail to put them
on the board when men hesitate an in
stant. It is difficult to impress favor
ably a man who is taking a girl out
for the first time, the weak stabs
at lines may be excused on that
ground. Some girls feel they do not
have to furnish the conversational en
tertainment in return for the edible
entertainment provided by the man.
An etiquette authority in her book
says that the woman's part is to show
the man a good time in return for his
outlay of coin. But some of the cam
pus queens feel that the man should
provide the line as well.
Some women are clever, for some
men like to talk. If these men got out
with women who know how to be po
litely inquisitive and who can laugh at
the right time in a broad-minded way,
the men think they have queens.

gag is used usually with intent to pull

can then refuse.
Another woman will bubble over and
tell you that you are the first Stanford
man she ever met and that her im

This is used only by those who try
to find out what kind of man they are
tampering with. Usually the women
on the campus maintain an astute si
lence until the men have broken the
ice with a wise crack or some more
or less conventional remark. Any!

woman, no matter of what type, will
give you a chance to show your hand
first, if you are a man. Then she will
be politely inquisitive but not confi
dentially communicative.
Talk About the Weather
Usually if the woman is left to her
own devices to make conversation or
oil the line, she will remark conven
tionally about college work, the
weather, music, or decorations—if it
is a dance. She may ask you about
your summer vacation. And she may
even surprise you and be one of the
few-and-far-between kind who is really
interested in what you have to say;
she will not look dead while you are
talking, and she will not interrupt you
in your choicest narrative to tell you
about hockey, shin guards, and train
ing rules.
There are plenty of gold-diggers on
the campus who have a mo&i alluring
line. The "2200" are here for them to
play with and they start with a rush
of words pleading for a "nice little
drive to Monterey where you can get
such wonderful ahalone steaks at Pop
Ernst's on the ocean." The doe on
dancing and if you can't dance at
Pop's you can go to the Highland Inn.

you value your date by placing a high
value on herself in her own opinion.
She politely asks where it was she
met you before, and you have only

already. And another type starts in by
telling you how much she has heard of
you. She has always wanted to meet
you. "When I saw your name on my
program I knew it could be no one
else. 1 feel as if I had known you a
long time." This is rather flattering
until she tells you how many dates
she has fixed up for scores of other
fellows who call up at the last minute;
she ends by making you feel that she
has asked you to patronize her queen

Study, Weather, Popular Topics
College work and the weather are
the two most used topics of women's
lines. Women never fail to put them
on the board when men hesitate an in
stant. It is difficult to impress favor
ably a man who is taking a girl out
for the first time, the weak stabs
at lines may be excused on that
ground. Some girls feel they do not
have to furnish the conversational en
tertainment in return for the edible
entertainment provided by the man.
An etiquette authority in her book
says that the woman's part is to show
the man a good time in return for his
outlay of coin. But some of the cam
pus queens feel that the man should
provide the line as well.
Some women are clever, for some
men like to talk. If these men got out
with women who know how to be po
litely inquisitive and who can laugh at
the right time in a broad-minded way,
the men think they have queens.
A "line" is a closely-connected series !

Stanford women are noted for their
lines. They have every opportunity to
foster and nourish them on the
wealthy abundance of credulous male
beings on the Stanford "Farm." There
are several types of lines which fit
the several types of women. Every!
woman who is not literally dumb can
be considered to have a line, no ifTatter
how condensed, weak, effusive, or
sophisticated it may be.
The First-Time-Out Line
The girl who is out for the first
time with a man she has no affection
for, will probably say, "I don't think
there will be a dance tonight on ac
count ol' the show in the Assembly
hall," thereby hinting that she prefers
to t;«ke in said show. When the ho
goat refuses to yield to the plea. sh<>
adds, "And I forgot to tell you that I
must be in by 9:80 on week nights,
even Fridays. It is a new hous-j rule.
I'm sorry." This usually comes after!
she finds out how little she really likes
him.
She is usually the type who looks up
your record, place of residence at;
home and on the campus, your middle
name, and kids you about one or all
of them during the evening. "So you
come from Morgan Hill? How did I
guess it? Oh, a friend of yours told me
all about you." Then she springs the
Phi Bete record stuff, says she thinks
bla-bla-bla pins are the only kind, and
ends by spending the rest of the eve
ning on your middle name which you
can't help and never use.
She may also tell you what the sif
ters say about this or that man. Then,
after giving you the once-over twice,
she will state that her sisters think
the best men on the campus don't!
queen, that it is only the rough
"roughs" who try to "step out."
Freshman Woman's Attack

Study, Weather, Popular Topics
College work and the weather are
the two most used topics of women's
lines. Women never fail to put them
on the board when men hesitate an in
stant. It is difficult to impress favor
ably a man who is taking a girl out
for the first time, the weak stabs
at lines may be excused on that
ground. Some girls feel they do not
have to furnish the conversational en
tertainment in return for the edible
entertainment provided by the man.
An etiquette authority in her book
says that the woman's part is to show
the man a good time in return for his
outlay of coin. But some of the cam
pus queens feel that the man should
provide the line as well.
Some women are clever, for some
men like to talk. If these men got out
with women who know how to be po
litely inquisitive and who can laugh at
the right time in a broad-minded way,
the men think they have queens.
A "line" is a closely-connected series !
of conglomerate utterances in such
form as to be audibly impressive to '
the listener, either favorably or other-1
wise.
Stanford women are noted for their
lines. They have every opportunity to
foster and nourish them on the
wealthy abundance of credulous male
beings on the Stanford "Farm." There
are several types of lines which fit
the several types of women. Every!
woman who is not literally dumb can
be considered to have a line, no ifTatter
how condensed, weak, effusive, or
sophisticated it may be.
The First-Time-Out Line
The girl who is out for the first
time with a man she has no affection
for, will probably say, "I don't think
there will be a dance tonight on ac
count ol' the show in the Assembly
hall," thereby hinting that she prefers
to t;«ke in said show. When the ho
goat refuses to yield to the plea. sh<>
adds, "And I forgot to tell you that I
must be in by 9:80 on week nights,
even Fridays. It is a new hous-j rule.
I'm sorry." This usually comes after!
she finds out how little she really likes
him.
She is usually the type who looks up
your record, place of residence at;
home and on the campus, your middle
name, and kids you about one or all
of them during the evening. "So you
come from Morgan Hill? How did I
guess it? Oh, a friend of yours told me
all about you." Then she springs the
Phi Bete record stuff, says she thinks
bla-bla-bla pins are the only kind, and
ends by spending the rest of the eve
ning on your middle name which you
can't help and never use.
She may also tell you what the sif
ters say about this or that man. Then,
after giving you the once-over twice,
she will state that her sisters think
the best men on the campus don't!
queen, that it is only the rough
"roughs" who try to "step out."
Freshman Woman's Attack
The freshman woman with whom:
you have the first date will tell you
how wonderful it is at Stanford and
what she has been doing to make it
seem wonderful. "You can't believe
how dates I've had. I've been
out every night but two since I arrived
on the campus, and I've turned down
four invitations to the Cotillion." This
gag is used usually with intent to pull
out an invitation which the freshette
can then refuse.
Another woman will bubble over and
tell you that you are the first Stanford
man she ever met and that her im
pression of him is quite favorable.
This is used only by those who try
to find out what kind of man they are
tampering with. Usually the women
on the campus maintain an astute si
lence until the men have broken the
ice with a wise crack or some more
or less conventional remark. Any!

woman, no matter of what type, will
give you a chance to show your hand
first, if you are a man. Then she will
be politely inquisitive but not confi
dentially communicative.
Talk About the Weather
Usually if the woman is left to her
own devices to make conversation or
oil the line, she will remark conven
tionally about college work, the
weather, music, or decorations—if it
is a dance. She may ask you about
your summer vacation. And she may
even surprise you and be one of the
few-and-far-between kind who is really
interested in what you have to say;
she will not look dead while you are
talking, and she will not interrupt you
in your choicest narrative to tell you
about hockey, shin guards, and train
ing rules.
There are plenty of gold-diggers on
the campus who have a mo&i alluring
line. The "2200" are here for them to
play with and they start with a rush
of words pleading for a "nice little
drive to Monterey where you can get
such wonderful ahalone steaks at Pop
Ernst's on the ocean." The doe on
dancing and if you can't dance at
Pop's you can go to the Highland Inn.
Makes You Value a Date
Then the girl who desires to make
you value your date by placing a high
value on herself in her own opinion.
She politely asks where it was she
met you before, and you have only
been introduced to her three times
already. And another type starts in by
telling you how much she has heard of
you. She has always wanted to meet
you. "When I saw your name on my
program I knew it could be no one
else. 1 feel as if I had known you a
long time." This is rather flattering
until she tells you how many dates
she has fixed up for scores of other
fellows who call up at the last minute;
she ends by making you feel that she
has asked you to patronize her queen
ing agency.
