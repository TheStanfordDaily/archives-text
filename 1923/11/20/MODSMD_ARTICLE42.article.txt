# Knowledge Runs High; Loss of 53 Cents Every Time a Class Is "Cut"
## 
### 
Are you getting your 53 cents' worth
of knowledge every time you go to
class? For this is the average cost to
every student, on the basis of a fifteen
hour, twelve-week quarter at $96 per.
Figure it out yourself. This doesn't
mean, however, that every time a
"prof" cuts a class you should go up
and demand your 53 cents back.
From carefully-drawn deductions, it
is shown that 98 per cent of all stu
dents enrolled do not get more than
10 cents' worth out of every class;
1 per cent gets 11 cents' worth; and
1 per cent flunk.
The money left over from this de

duction is to be used to support an
elevator boy in Toyon.
