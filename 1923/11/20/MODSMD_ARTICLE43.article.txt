# JUNIOR CLASS SHINES UP OREGON STUDENTS
## 
### 
EUGENE, Ore. â€”Shoe polishers in
stead of apple polishers predominated
last week on the University of Oregon
campus when the Junior Class staged
the second annual shine day for the
purpose of raising money for Thanks
giving baskets for the poor. The spirit
of Italy predominated, an accent,
bright-colored bandanas, curtain rings,
and scarfs lending a foreign and fes
tive air to the work of the bootblacks.
All customers were given a numbered
ticket the morning of the "shiny day"
and a raffle was then held, the holder
of the lucky number receiving a hand
some shoe-shining kit.
