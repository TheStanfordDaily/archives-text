# Berkeley's Tombstone
## 
### 
(Key of F—Starting note C)
The writing on the tombstone
Of the husky Berkeley crowd
Will be carved a little deeper
While our shouting rings out loud:
Old Berkeley's dead and buried
Underneath the red, red sod,
And the Card'nal waves supremely
Above the Stanford Quad.
A lively air putting emphasis on
such words —husky, deeper, red, etc.
