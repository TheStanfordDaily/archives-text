(Key of B-flat —Starting note F)
Get a quick, easy swing. Yell
"WHIP" and "WHIPPED," pausing a
little after each.
The Cardinal is waving over the field,
Our men are fighting with a spirit that
will not yield.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Farewell, old Berkeley—we're after
you.
Once again the Cardinal will WHIP
the Gold and Blue.
When the game is over and the foe
has fled,
The Cardinal is triumphant and the
Oski Bear is dead.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
Farewell, old Berkeley—we're after
you.
Once again the Cardinal has WHIP
PED the Gold and Blue.

University of Chicago introduced
the practice of sending "iove notes" or
congratulatory notices to students who
have received high grades. They also
show no hesitancy in sending the well
known "cinches" or "smoke-ups."
