# STANFORD RALLIES TOMORROW NIGHT FOR BRUIN GAME
## Parade Starts at 7 O'clock From Alpha Delt House; Ends at Stadium 
### 
Tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Cardi
nal rooters will have their last chance
to give the vocal chords a workout
before the "second varsity" takes the
bleachers next Saturday. /
Follow the band and see the rally.
Practice the songs and take part
in it.
The jubilee to be held in the sta
dium will be, as usual, THE rally—
the one big event of the sort. It is
taken for granted that 2,600 and some
thing students will be there, accord
ing to Burt Lapp, host at the gather
ing; but, he says, attendance will
not be only a duty but a pleasure.
To coin a phrase, a good time will
be had by all.
Things will commence with a par
ade from the Alpha Delta Phi house,
headed by the band. It will be per
missible to make a noise at any time
while the parade is in progress, and
it is essential that the parade be a
parade and not a profession. For
this reason, Lapp urges everyone to
join in, instead of steaming to the
stadium in motor vehicles.
The main event will take place in
the stadium, with speeches, enter
tainment numbers, and songs and
yells all mixed up together. The bon
fire will be lighted and the serpentine
held at the close of the stadium ses
sion.
Members of Ram's Head society
are working on the principal enter
tainment stunt of the evening, the
exect nature of which is being kept
secret. It will be of timely interest,
and, it is reported, will take a wide
swing at the Berkeley brotherhood.
The "cast" will include such perform
erfs as Arnold Bayley, Hollis Chal
mers, Dave Maunoccir, Gene Trago,
and Lewis Alabaster. In the face of a
coming law examination, the men of
the society held first rehersals last
evening, and will meet again tonight.
It is believed that the stadium is
large enough to accomodate almost
any crowd that will, turn out for the
rally, and attendance will not be re
stricted to students. Tickets will not
be necessary, according to the rally
committee. "Bring "em along," says
Burt Lapp. "The more the merrier.
They can occupy any seats except
those reserved for the rooters, the
team and the band."
The team will go into retirement,
not to say hiding, at the close of the
rally. Nobody knows but *Andy Kerr

just where they will retire to; and he
is famous for his habit of saying
nothing. So the rooters will look their
last on the team before it trots onto
the field Saturday.

ade from the Alpha Delta Phi house,
headed by the band. It will be per
missible to make a noise at any time
while the parade is in progress, and
it is essential that the parade be a
parade and not a profession. For
this reason, Lapp urges everyone to
join in, instead of steaming to the
stadium in motor vehicles.
The main event will take place in
the stadium, with speeches, enter
tainment numbers, and songs and
yells all mixed up together. The bon
fire will be lighted and the serpentine
held at the close of the stadium ses
sion.
Members of Ram's Head society
are working on the principal enter
tainment stunt of the evening, the
exect nature of which is being kept
secret. It will be of timely interest,
and, it is reported, will take a wide
swing at the Berkeley brotherhood.
The "cast" will include such perform
erfs as Arnold Bayley, Hollis Chal
mers, Dave Maunoccir, Gene Trago,
and Lewis Alabaster. In the face of a
coming law examination, the men of
the society held first rehersals last
evening, and will meet again tonight.
It is believed that the stadium is
large enough to accomodate almost
any crowd that will, turn out for the
rally, and attendance will not be re
stricted to students. Tickets will not
be necessary, according to the rally
committee. "Bring "em along," says
Burt Lapp. "The more the merrier.
They can occupy any seats except
those reserved for the rooters, the
team and the band."
The team will go into retirement,
not to say hiding, at the close of the
rally. Nobody knows but *Andy Kerr

just where they will retire to; and he
is famous for his habit of saying
nothing. So the rooters will look their
last on the team before it trots onto
the field Saturday.
Tomorrow night at 7 o'clock Cardi
nal rooters will have their last chance
to give the vocal chords a workout
before the "second varsity" takes the
bleachers next Saturday. /
Follow the band and see the rally.
Practice the songs and take part
in it.
The jubilee to be held in the sta
dium will be, as usual, THE rally—
the one big event of the sort. It is
taken for granted that 2,600 and some
thing students will be there, accord
ing to Burt Lapp, host at the gather
ing; but, he says, attendance will
not be only a duty but a pleasure.
To coin a phrase, a good time will
be had by all.
Things will commence with a par
ade from the Alpha Delta Phi house,
