# "INSECT PLAY" IS RATED GREATEST MODERN DRAMA
## H. D. Gray P raises Production Of Capek's Work, and Unabridged "Hamlet" 
### 
"The Insect Play,"-by Capek, was
described by Professor H. D. Gray
in his lecture last evening as the,
greatest drama he had seen outside
Shakespeare and the Bible. But its
complete pessimism and its terrible!
sincerity doomed it to failure from
the first. The play is a symbolic com
parison of humans to insects. Act I is
the Butterfly scene, representing the
pathos, frivolity, and utter lack of any
thing real in the society world.
Then come the creepers and crawl
ers, showing the commonplace trage
dies of the middle classes. The ants
represent the workers, with their con
tinuous line marching by with pick
and shovel. In this scene they battle
over the ground between two blades
of grass, symbolic of the Great War.
Even the beautiful mayflies dance J
ouly a few seconds before they droop â– 
and sink to the ground.
Gray gave detailed accounts of some
of the more significant plays of last|
season, including "Robert E. Lee," and
the performances of the Roman Mari-j
onettes.
"Robert E. Lee" Drama-less
Drinkwater's "Robert E. Lee" he 1
characterized as drama-less, express- j
ing as his belief that "Lincoln" was
a greater play because the central'
figure was a greater man in real life!
than Lee.
Professor Gray saw a number of
performances of Podrecca's Roman
Marionettes. The first time he at
tended, the figures, three feet in
height, seemed life-size from where!
he sat in the back. They were re-'
, vealed as very ugly from seats nearer
i the front, and their movements seemed
awkward.
"Hamlet" Seen in Entirety
In speaking of the revivals of old
plays, Professor Gray expressed his
appreciation of the "Hamlet" which
he saw in London. It was given, in his
| opinion, as it was written, without any
attempt to put original interpretations
into the character of the hero. No
one in the audience thought to raise
i the questions brought up by students
of Shakespeare, but seemed to accept
its meaning without question, and
with perfect sympathy and under
standing. That, Gray believes, is what
Shakespeare intended the audience to
do.
Describing the theaters of London
1 as more eozv than the American ones,
i the speaker told of many unusual de
tails of theater-going in England.
Highly specialized begging goes on
in front of the queue line formed to'
buy tickets. After watching them per
form, he declared that any entertain
ment in the theater seemed good by
comparison. During the intermission
| between the second and. third acts, j
I which comes punctually at 4:30 p. m.,
the ushers take orders for tea, and
every one drinks it.
