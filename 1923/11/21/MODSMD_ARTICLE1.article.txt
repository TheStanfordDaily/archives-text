# "INSECT PLAY" IS RATED GREATEST MODERN DRAMA
## H. D. Gray P raises Production Of Capek's Work, and Unabridged "Hamlet" 
### 
"The Insect Play,"-by Capek, was
described by Professor H. D. Gray
in his lecture last evening as the,
greatest drama he had seen outside
Shakespeare and the Bible. But its
complete pessimism and its terrible!
sincerity doomed it to failure from
the first. The play is a symbolic com
parison of humans to insects. Act I is
the Butterfly scene, representing the
pathos, frivolity, and utter lack of any
thing real in the society world.
Then come the creepers and crawl
ers, showing the commonplace trage
dies of the middle classes. The ants
represent the workers, with their con
tinuous line marching by with pick
and shovel. In this scene they battle
over the ground between two blades
of grass, symbolic of the Great War.
Even the beautiful mayflies dance J
ouly a few seconds before they droop ■
and sink to the ground.
Gray gave detailed accounts of some
of the more significant plays of last|
season, including "Robert E. Lee," and
the performances of the Roman Mari-j
onettes.
"Robert E. Lee" Drama-less
Drinkwater's "Robert E. Lee" he 1
characterized as drama-less, express- j
ing as his belief that "Lincoln" was
a greater play because the central'
figure was a greater man in real life!
than Lee.
Professor Gray saw a number of
performances of Podrecca's Roman
