# Campus Tradition To Be Upheld As Roughs Celebrate Tomorrow
## 
### 
Roughs' Day, one of the few remain
ing campus traditions, will be cele
brated tomorrow by the male under
graduate studenfe body with the re
mainder of the campus, faculty and
females, looking on in sympathetic
ecstacy.
The occasion, like the present
Fourth of July celebrations, will be
safe and sane. Skyrockets there may
be but no reverting back to the days
of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence when scant Indian cos-|
tumes were in vogue in the Golden
West. No female costumes will be per
mitted to adorn the huge frames of
bulky Adonises.
Mass action cannot be resorted to
and activity on the Quad and in the
classrooms has been forbidden by
rulings of the Men's Council and Ex
ecutive Committee accepted by Psesl

dent Wilbur. The husky toredors and
vibrant Romeos are epeeted to attend
classes as usual and cuts will be as
inexcusable as on ony other day. Due
respect must be shown strangers and
property must not be destroyed or
else the wrath of excommunication
from the Stanford portals will be
visited upon the wrong-doers by Men's
Council.
Complete information concerning
the liberties of the day and the re l
strictions placed on the occasion by
the student rulings will be given in
each fraternity house and living group
tonight by some member of the Senior
Control Committee. It is the duty of
this body to see that the affair is pre
served as onpi of Stanford's traditions
and is not sullied by ungentlemanly
or improper conduct on the part of
indiscreet individuals.
