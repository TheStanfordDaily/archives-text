# CHEERFUL MOURNERS TO CARRY OUT LAST GOLDEN BEAR RITES
## Campbell and Kerr Will Speak At Cremation Services Tonight 
### Dave Lamson 
Mourners for the Golden Bear will gather with bowed heads tonight.
At the close of the ceremonies, the bear will be cremated on the funeral
pyre opposite Encina gymnasium.
The funeral will start with a parade from the Alpha Delta Phi house
at 7 o'clock. Headed by the band and the football team, the student body will
proceed to the stadium, where services will be read by Andrew Kerr,
"Scotchy" Campbell, Ed Cunha, Parmer Fuller, and the Ram's Head society.
The students will all join in on the chorus.
There, briefly stated, is the program for the rally which will celebrate the
event that every Stanford man and woman is sure will transpire—the death of

California's hopes. The affair, accord
ing to those in charge, will be quite the
biggest and best the campus has ever
known, as is quite fitting, since it is
held in honor of the 1923 Stanford foot
ball varsity.
Large Crowd Expected.
In addition to the undergraduates
present, a good-sized crowd is ex
pected to attend from San P'rancisco
and neighboring cities, according to
Burt Lapp. Scores of alumni and
friends of the University have signi
fied their intention of adding their bit
to the general commotion attendant
on the passing of the Golden Bear.
Among those who will speak at the
rally will be Ed Cunha, '07, who was
yell leader in 1905 and president of the
suden body in 1905 and 1906. He is
now a practicing attorney in, San Fran
cisco. Another speaker will be Par
mer Fuller, '10, at one time editor of
the Daily Palo Alto. He also took
part in campus dramatics. Although
Fuller did not play rugby, he was con
sidered an authority on the game, and
was one of the leading officials on the
Pacific coast. Comptroller "Dutch"
Roth will introduce the speaker.
Coach Andy Kerr and Captain
"Scotchy" Campbell need, one might
almost say, no introduction to a Stan
ford audience. This will be the last
public appearance of the two, as well
as of the entire varsity squad, before
the game on Saturday.
Bonfire in Stadium
For the first time in the history of
the University, a bonfire will be built
in the stadium. The fire will not be
as large as that built by the freshmen,
but it will compare favorably with the
Greek theater bonfire built for the
California rally, according to Mike Ely,
who is in charge of its construction.
By means of a quite remarkable bit
of detectivating, our perspiring re
porter has discovered the nature of
the act to be staged by Ram's Head at
tonight's party. But, pledged to
secrecy, it is possible only to announce
that the stunt will be good. Paul
Claflin and Hollis Chalmers and Ar
nold Bayley are going to work in it,
together with other members of Ram's
Head and a mob of about fifty.
Magnavox Planned
Loud speakers were to be installed
in the stadium this afternoon in order
that everyone might hear the words
of the speakers and the lines of the
actors. Lights—quite unusual lights,
some of them—have also been ar
ranged so that a clear view may be ob
tained. The lights have been kept dark
by Lapp, if I know what I mean; how
the stadium will be illuminated is not
anounced.
New departures in noise-making
methods are also promised by Lapp,
who promises something quite startling
along this line.
No heating system has been in
stalled in , the stadium, however; and

students are warned to pull on an
extra sweater in order that their voices
may be whole at the game. Extra
wraps will be necesary only during the
stadium program; it will be possible to
get warm when the bonfire is lighted

and the serpentine begins.

Loud speakers were to be installed
in the stadium this afternoon in order
that everyone might hear the words
of the speakers and the lines of the
actors. Lights—quite unusual lights,
some of them—have also been ar
ranged so that a clear view may be ob
tained. The lights have been kept dark
by Lapp, if I know what I mean; how
the stadium will be illuminated is not
anounced.
New departures in noise-making
methods are also promised by Lapp,
who promises something quite startling
along this line.
No heating system has been in
stalled in , the stadium, however; and

students are warned to pull on an
extra sweater in order that their voices
may be whole at the game. Extra
wraps will be necesary only during the
stadium program; it will be possible to
get warm when the bonfire is lighted

and the serpentine begins.
Students Asemble at 7
Living groups serve dinner at 6
o'clock. The student body assembles
at the Alpha Delta Phi house at 7
o'clock. The Alpha Delta Phi house,

by the \ is bounded on the north by
the Ro' n the east by the school
house, ; in the west l>y the Alpha.
Phi hoi
arace, the glasses! They'ie
off!
Mourners for the Golden Bear will gather with bowed heads tonight.
At the close of the ceremonies, the bear will be cremated on the funeral
pyre opposite Encina gymnasium.
The funeral will start with a parade from the Alpha Delta Phi house
at 7 o'clock. Headed by the band and the football team, the student body will
proceed to the stadium, where services will be read by Andrew Kerr,
"Scotchy" Campbell, Ed Cunha, Parmer Fuller, and the Ram's Head society.
The students will all join in on the chorus.
There, briefly stated, is the program for the rally which will celebrate the
event that every Stanford man and woman is sure will transpire—the death of

California's hopes. The affair, accord
ing to those in charge, will be quite the
biggest and best the campus has ever
known, as is quite fitting, since it is
held in honor of the 1923 Stanford foot
ball varsity.
Large Crowd Expected.
In addition to the undergraduates
present, a good-sized crowd is ex
pected to attend from San P'rancisco
and neighboring cities, according to
Burt Lapp. Scores of alumni and
friends of the University have signi
fied their intention of adding their bit
to the general commotion attendant
on the passing of the Golden Bear.
Among those who will speak at the
rally will be Ed Cunha, '07, who was
yell leader in 1905 and president of the
suden body in 1905 and 1906. He is
now a practicing attorney in, San Fran
cisco. Another speaker will be Par
mer Fuller, '10, at one time editor of
the Daily Palo Alto. He also took
part in campus dramatics. Although
Fuller did not play rugby, he was con
sidered an authority on the game, and
was one of the leading officials on the
Pacific coast. Comptroller "Dutch"
Roth will introduce the speaker.
Coach Andy Kerr and Captain
"Scotchy" Campbell need, one might
almost say, no introduction to a Stan
ford audience. This will be the last
public appearance of the two, as well
as of the entire varsity squad, before
the game on Saturday.
Bonfire in Stadium
For the first time in the history of
the University, a bonfire will be built
in the stadium. The fire will not be
as large as that built by the freshmen,
but it will compare favorably with the
Greek theater bonfire built for the
California rally, according to Mike Ely,
who is in charge of its construction.
