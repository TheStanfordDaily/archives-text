# PROMPT PAYMENT OF ENDOWMENT FUND PLEDGES IS URGED
## 
### 
The Endowment Comittee is sending
out notices to the comparatively small
number of subscribers who have not
met pledges, urging that payments be
made when they are due, since for
every dollar received by the Endow
ment Committee the General Educa
tion Board contributes three-tenths of
a dollar to the fund. According to a
representative of the Endowment
Committee, "The splendid response
of alumni, professors, students, and
friends in making pledges for sub
scriptions to the 'First Million* has
been followed for the most part by
payment of pledges at the
time when they are due. The Endow
ment Committee sends out notices to
subscribers to remind them of their
debt.
"The necessity for prompt payment
has been explained in the letter sent
out by the Endowment Committee, in
which the terms under which the
'First Million' was raised are ex
plained. The gift of the General Edu
cation Board was subscribed after the
$700,000 had been raised among those
interested in the University. The gift
of $300,000 is paid in proportion to the
money received by the committee.
Therefore the most effective way of
offering help to the future of Stanford
University is to meet Endowment
Fund payments promptly.
