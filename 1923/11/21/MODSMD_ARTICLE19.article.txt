# Official Capacities

### 
It is interesting to watch certain student body
officials in the performance of their duties. Severe,
strict, conscientiousâ€”you know instinctively that
you could trust them with the cares of the entire
University. Duty to constituents is to them a re
ligion.
Other officers taking authority from the student
body vote offer a contrast unpleasant but obvious.
They have taken their adventure in government as
a lark, accept their duties as a good joke, and attend
meetings only for the opportunity given to make
inappropriate witticisms. They have no thought or
concern for those who felt enough trust in their
abilities to elect them. They prefer to call attention
to the honor given them by telling how neglectful
they are of the duties attached.
At rare intervals one sees a man in a student
body office who calmly attends to business, without
invocation of the god of duty or attempt to slide
out the exit of irresponsibility. When such a man
holds office for the students one feels renewed faith
in the system of student government despite all that
is forced upon it by carelessness or excess of zeal.
