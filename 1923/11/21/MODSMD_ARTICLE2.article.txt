## 
### 
The Class of '26 voiced its approval
of ihe proposed increase in the size
of the pages of the 1925 Quad by
passing a motion to that effect at the
class meeting yesterday.
Donald Mc Kay, editor of this year's
Quad, spoke to the sophomores on the
proposed change which increases the
size of the pages of the annual from
eight by ten inches to nine by twelve.
"It is essential that the change be
approved by the Class of '26 before
it takes place as this class will edit
next year's annual." said McKay. "We
do. not want to institute a change
which will not be continued by other
classes. The present size of the Quad
will make the book very difficult to
bnd if it becomes much larger. A
thinner book with larger pages is
much easier to bind. There will also
be considerable saving from such a
change will enable us to improve the
book in some other way, especially in
design.
"All pictures will run across the
width of the page, eliminating the ne
cessity of turning the book around
while looking at pictures; the larger
page will permit captions to be printed
on the same page.
"Stanford is not the only university
changing the shape of its annual. Ihe
Blue and Gold is using the new size
this year. The Michigan and Wiscon
sin year books have already adopted
the change. There is a decided trend
towards the thinner, larger-paged an
nual. Members of the Quad staff have
been investigating the change for
three months. They hav>e consulted
engravers, printers, and experts in
this line and were urged by all of
them to make the change."
