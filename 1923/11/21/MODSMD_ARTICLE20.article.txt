# Old Hats
## 
### 
There is a student now in the University who is
the legal owner of seven hats. All these hats are
old, all are battered, and all give the owner the
appearance of a half-lit candle wearing a leaky
snuffer.
Yet this student wears all his hats alternately,
takes great pride in their knocked-up aspect, and
offers to fight any one who suggests that he either
acquire new head-gear or get rid of some of his
antiques. To him the hats are old friends and links
to the past. He wears each of them in turn as he
feels the mood which they represent. No one could
get that man to give up his hats, until they fall
apart and return to dust. They are his hats and he
likes them, regardless of how they affect his ap
pearance.
On the Farm there are several customs, glorified
by long possession into "traditions" about which no
one can suggest anything ill without a loud roar
from the proud advocates of the "tradition." Re
gardless of present usefulness, appearance, and ap
propriateness of the attire, some residents of Stan
ford will continue to wear these relics of the days
of rah-rah colleges until they moulder and fall apart.
Even then will the sentimentalists wail and groan,
and hold sobbing wake over what they conceive as
"the sacrifice of glorious tradition."

The Daily Palo Alto has been asked to advocate
that all students attend the rally tonight as a
patriotic duty. Being 1 most complaisant to requests,
the Daily hereby asks those people who were plan
ning to spend the evening in study to prevent inter
ruption by purchase of plenty of cotton for the ears.
