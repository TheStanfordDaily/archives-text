Dear Cabbages:
I've noticed lately that co-ed's questions are being
answered by you and we may now express our ideas in
your column.
Well, I'd like to say a few words.
The local taxi companies will probably issue a war
rant for me forthwith but Annabelle must speak her
mind.
College men complain that queening is so expensive.
The other day I had the privilege to talk with a junior
who wasn't afraid to speak his good and substantial
mind. He said the reason men go to the movies by
themselves was that girls expect to be conveyed up
and down Palm Avenue in a motor car, and Stickey's
must of necessity be visited!
Now that is perfectly ridiculous.
If the men would only give the co-eds a chance to be
good pals their efforts would be more than repaid.
Just because the numerical relation of men and wo
men is artificial here ... is no reason that the women
themselves and their social relations should be. Except
for the most elaborate of the cake-eaters, we are all
most willing to stroll along and eat a Hershey on the
way home instead of all this elegent treatment you seem
to think is necessary to a little excursion to the village
cinema.
Ask your leading lady if she wouldn't rather do this
than stay at home or queen to the movies with other
queens . . . Just ask . . . Don't be afraid to be frank.
She'll be your leading lady more than ever when you
hear her reply.
•'No more taxis except on state occasions" will be her
motto. —Annabelle Lee Smith.

CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Elinor Ayres
Everyone likes Elinor Ayres. She is not as beautiful
as most. She has no chic or dash. She is in no way
spactacular. She is not brilliant. She is not accomplished.
Thoes who are jealous of her popularity, call her "drab"
or "negative." She is popular, in spite of all these things
that she is not. The gods forgot to endow her with most
of the graces of her sex. But they bestowed upon her
ONE of their rarest and most golden gifts. Elinor
Ayres is a Good Listener.

Far be it from us to criticize the color scheme of the
Strawberry Canyon stadium designers, but isn't a
blending of red, yellow, blue, and green rather radical?
