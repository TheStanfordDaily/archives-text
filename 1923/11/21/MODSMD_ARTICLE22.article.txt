# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: —
No doubt you will agree with me that an editorial is
■worth while only when based on fact rather than fiction.
Yet, the Stanford Spectator, ostensibly published by
sticklers for fact, includes in its chaste columns this
month an editorial so condemnatory in its utter lies and
half-truths that Ananias is for the nonce forgotten. If
you have time to spend on idle browsing in editorial
fields, do not overlook the opportunity to read that
editorial labeled "Bursted Bubbles" in the last Spectator.
Intended as it is to tell a story of a tragedy, it cannot
but get howls of laughter because of its burlesque exag
geration.
To begin with, the editorial in question starts off with
the assumption that the sponsor system is a failure,
that the "balloon" has been punctured by Experience.
The sophomoric blobber which took the form of a stam
peded resolution last week is the tool which accom
plished this strategic piece of work. Laughs number
one and two. In the first place, the sponsor system did
not even feel this "devilish" pricking and has not col
lapsed, and in the second place, the sophomores are in
the majority against a resolution that passed in a
meeting with less than a third of their members present.
To continue: "One freshman out of five will speak;
one of three will have his 'dink;' one out of ten will be
queening some woman, taking a short cut up the Law
Steps in order the sooner to meet her." This is, of
course, a whole-cloth fabrication. It is mere exaggera
tion for effect. Perhaps one freshman out of thirty
doesn't speak; perhaps one out of twenty doesn't wear
his dink; perhaps one occasionally meets a co-ed from
his home town and talks to her. What of it? Ever
since the writer of that editorial has been in college,
such things have been. It has become a tradition to
complain about freshmen and this particular under
graduate feels that he should breathe into it further
sparks of life. Again: "Spectator for the first time this
year, witnessed a wholesale booing of a referee from
a Stanford audience, and that audience was composed
exclusively of freshmen! Swallow that as you can, you
who claim that this is but the idle waving of a scare
crow."
Challenge accepted. I, for one, cannot let this state
ment even get close to my nose, not to mention swal
lowing such a profound batch of gab. In the first place,
the only game at which a preponderance of freshmen
could be in attendance was at the "little big" game. If
that audience was "composed exclusively of freshmen,"
then many a friend of mine has gone back to his second
childhood. In the second place, what is wrong with
"Stanford men," which it appears freshmen are not,
that they refuse to attend such an important game? And
in the third place, at least six upperclassmen who sat
in the press box where everything can be seen and
heard, flatly deny that any booing occurred. Was the
editor of the Spectator at the game? If he was, how
can he stretch fact as to say that the audience was
"exclusively" composed of freshmen?
In another editorial, mention is made of the "fact"
that by winning the game in question, the freshmen
won "the first victory a Stanford first-year team ever
scored against California." This is more tradition based
on fiction. Like a number of other sacred traditions, it
has no foundaton, but merely sprung into being without
cause. Stanford and California freshmen are now even
on football games won. Twenty years ago, Stanford
freshmen won football four years in a row. Ask any
old-timer.

In the way of justification for his injudicious yipping,
the writer of the editorial in question remarks, "But the
fact that a system exists has never prevented the discus
sion of its faults, and will not as long as the winds of
freedom blow. As soon as discussion is stopped, we
are working under a system of enforced drafts, con
trolled hy a head engineer, and the winds of freedom are
junked." Just so. But unless this all-wise party has
improvements to offer, what good will come from pro
vocative and prevaricative discussion? —T. 1., '23.
