### 
Does the spectacle
of over 70,000
human beings
sitting in a
concrete saucer
to watch a
handful of men
play a game
called football
mean anything
more to you than
that so many
people are very
much interested
in that particular
contest?
:
To some it means
more than that:
It means that the
average mortal is
always wanting to
do something better
than someone else
can do it. And if
he can't be in the
fight himself he
wants to watch
others, and have
his side win. For
rivalry springs
from the bone-deep
urge for conflict.
