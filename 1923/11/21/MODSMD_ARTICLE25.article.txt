# A 						WOMAN SAYS

Stanford has many traditions. Many
are good and, as the alumni say, the
"eld Farm" wouldn't be the same with
out them.
However, there is one tradition that
could easily be dispensed with, and
that is the studied lack of common
politeness on the part of the men on
the Quad. They consider themselves
an object of mirth if they are polite,
so they restrain their acquired cul
tural instincts.
There are several concrete examples
of this lack of consideration on the
part of the men. When a woman falls j
down the Library steps (and it has
been done) why should the men all
stand around uneasily on one foot and
wait until another woman rushes to
the rescue? We admire the sporting
instinct in men but any disinterested
outsider would think these masculine
spectators were betting on how long
it would take her to get up without
any assistance, and that's carrying it |
a little 'too far.
The other day one of our feminine
campus bicyclists took "a mean spill" i

just opposite a large group of sons of
the Stanford Red. She lay on the
ground for several minutes in a dazed
condition and nobody came to the
rescue. Their minds were probably so
occupied with their problems in high
er mathematics and they were liguring
out the number of degrees the curve
described by the bicycle as it left the
ground.
Alas! and Alack! our Sir Walter
Raleighs have left us, and we have
to study medieval literature to find
any signs of chivalry.
It is noticeable, though, that any
men of foreign descent on the campus
are always polite and considerate.
When we refer to chivalry we cer
tainly don't expect men to go around
playing drop-the-handkerchief, but
merely suggest that they remember
the etiquette that mother inculcated
in them in the days of long ago.
A man always leaves a woman flat
when she falls figuratively, but why
leave her flat when she falls literally ?

Berlin has joined the list of
dying cities by reporting 628 children
born last week in the German capital
compared with 810 deaths.
