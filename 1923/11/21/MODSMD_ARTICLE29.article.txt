THURSDAY
P. L. U. meets at 7:15 in Old Union.

DEAN YOST will he at home as usual.
WOMEN'S CONFERENCE will meet
at 7 p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse.
CHAPARRAL BUSINESS STAFF will

in the Press building. All those who
are to sell Chappies at the Big Game
are requested to be present in addi

Bears Show Strength in Pinch
But the Bears have always shown
their strength in the pinches. They
went South to play U. S. C. with the
odds even. They came back with a 13
to 7 victory. Washington was slated
to give the Bears the game of their
lives, and according to reports were
not in the race at any part of the
contest.
Andy Smith against Nevada used the
regular backfleld, but his line was
composed mostly of substitutes.
Those who argue that California
has depended a great deal on her
reputation are not arguing about any
thing. No football team can fight on
a reputation no matter how good or
how poor it is. Stanford has usually
been made the goat, but Stanford did
not lose any games this year because
the other colleges realized that last
year the University had a second rate
team.
Teams Even in Weight
The Stanford line outweighs Cali
fornia but one pound, on paper. The
Cardinal backfield has an advantage
of six pounds. Neither fact is strong
enough to begin building hopes upon.
Nor will either team have an advan
tage in fighting spirit. Both squads
are going to tear at each other's
throats until the final gun goes off;
until either Stanford or California has
dedicated the new jVlemorial Stadium.
Andy Kerr will probably use his
regular line-up at the start of the
game, with Lawson and Thomas at
ends; Johnston and Shipkey, tackles;
Faville and Cravens at guards; Baker,
center; Campbell, quarterback; Nev
ers, fullback, and Cleaveland and
Wheat at halfback.

Bears Show Strength in Pinch
But the Bears have always shown
their strength in the pinches. They
went South to play U. S. C. with the
odds even. They came back with a 13
to 7 victory. Washington was slated
to give the Bears the game of their
lives, and according to reports were
not in the race at any part of the
contest.
Andy Smith against Nevada used the
regular backfleld, but his line was
composed mostly of substitutes.
Those who argue that California
has depended a great deal on her
reputation are not arguing about any
thing. No football team can fight on
a reputation no matter how good or
how poor it is. Stanford has usually
been made the goat, but Stanford did
not lose any games this year because
the other colleges realized that last
year the University had a second rate
team.
Teams Even in Weight
The Stanford line outweighs Cali
fornia but one pound, on paper. The
Cardinal backfield has an advantage
of six pounds. Neither fact is strong
enough to begin building hopes upon.
Nor will either team have an advan
tage in fighting spirit. Both squads
are going to tear at each other's
throats until the final gun goes off;
until either Stanford or California has
dedicated the new jVlemorial Stadium.
Andy Kerr will probably use his
regular line-up at the start of the
game, with Lawson and Thomas at
ends; Johnston and Shipkey, tackles;
Faville and Cravens at guards; Baker,
center; Campbell, quarterback; Nev
ers, fullback, and Cleaveland and
Wheat at halfback.
