# Milkshake Apparatus Is Installed in Union Store
## 
### 
"It won't be long now!" So cries
little Chester Gump, son of the well
known Andy, standing at the fountain
in the Old Union Store, waiting for a
milkshake.
According to Miss Handy, director
of the New Union, the apparatus for
mixing some of the well-known soft
drinks has been installed and will be
soon putting out "choc-malts" and
"shakes" by the dozen. It is not known
definitely just when operations will
start, because of a few minor changes
to be made in the store. These should
be completed in a few days, however.
