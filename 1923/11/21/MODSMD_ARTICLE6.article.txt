# KERR WILL REST VARSITY BEFORE GAME SATURDAY
## Squad Will Leave for Quiet Resort After Big Game Rally in Stadium 
### 
Tonight after the Big Game rally
in the stadium, Coach Andy Kerr will
take his squad to some quiet moun
tain resort nearby, where light work
outs and signal practice will be held
in preparation for the California con
test Saturday. Ernie Nevers left the
hospital Monday and was in a suit
last night for the first time this week.
His injuries are not serious, and he
is expected to show all his old strength
and drive against the Bears.
And while the team is resting for
the big fight, comparative scores will
hog all the space.
Comparisons Interesting
It is a pleasure to dally with com
parisons of what Stanford and Cali
fornia has done, despite the fact that
they usually indicate nothing what
ever of the real strength of the two
teams.
Stanford has lost one game, and
California has lost none. California
has been scored on but once, and
Stanford in every game except two.
Nevada Scared Bruins
The plucky little Nevada eleven
gave the Bruins an awful scare. While
Andy Smith watched a Stanford game
his team came near going down to
defeat before a desperate college
team which didn't have any consider
ation for the psychological effect of
the great Bear's former reputation.
The Olympic Club held the Bears
to a 16 to 0 score, while Stanford suc
ceeded in trouncing the same team
40 to 7. Stanford defeated Santa Clara
55 to 6, after the Bears had beaten
them 48 to 0.
