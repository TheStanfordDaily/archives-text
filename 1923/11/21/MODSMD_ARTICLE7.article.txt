# Fairclough's Article Takes First Place in Philological Magazine
## 
### 
"Poems of Appendix Vergiliana," a
discussion of the authorship of verses
often attributed to Virgil, written by
Professor H. R. Fairclough of the
Classical department, holds first place
in the annual publication of the
American Philological Association,
which just appeared. Professor Fair
clough, in spite of the fact that half a
dozen articles or books published in
the last two years by professors of
Harvard and Johns Hopkins Univer
sities, claimed that Virgil was the
author of the poems, has rejected the
theory in his discussion. Professor
Fairclough is particularly well-fitted to
discuss the subject, on account of the
"Virgil" he was asked to arrange for
the Loeb Classical Library. He proved
that apart from the Eclogues, Georgics
and Aeneid I, nothing else' survives
from Virgil.
The subject created more discus
sion at the annual meeting last Christ
mas at Yale than any other of the
articles. Professor Fairclough's proof
of his side of the subject shatters the
arguments advanced by the books of
the opposite view. The discussion fol
lowed the lines of modern research
for authorship of* the Bible and cer
tain Shakesperian works.
The articles published by the Ameri
can Philological Association are cho
seA by an executive committee as the
best of those presented at the annual
meeting.
