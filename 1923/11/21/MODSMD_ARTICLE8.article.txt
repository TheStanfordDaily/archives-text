# IMPORTANCE OF LIFE AIM RECOGNIZED BY PROFESSOR SMITH
## Direction in Which You Are Going Is Big Thing, Says Assembly Speaker 
### 
"A man may be near to Heaven,
yet be moving toward Hell, while an
other may be near Hell and moving
heavenward. The latter is compara
tively safe.
"The direction in which you are mov
ing is the essential thing. Therefore
a definite purpose is necessary, though
you cannot always see the end toward
which you are working. Go as far as
you can, then see how far you can go."
This was the advice of Professor A.
W. Smith in his address on "A Per
sonal Attitude Toward Life," before
the University assembly this morning.
Stresses Kindliness.
Kindliness is another vital factor.
Professor Smith likened its function to
that of oil in a piece of machinery,
which reaches all points of possible
friction. It is right for those in author
ity to demand' results from their infer
iors, but it is wiser to make these re
quests in a kindly manner.
All the elements of tragedy are pres
ent when there is a conflict of wills
between employer and employee, for
there can be no rea' success without co
operation. When an employee criti
cizes his chief, questions his decisions
or accuses him of favoritism, it is
time for a change.
Civilization Advancing
"Civilization has advanced because
of the legnthening of the period of
preparation for life. The time of edu
cation should be life-long. One mis
guided student, upon finally gaining his
diploma, exclaimed. "Educated at
last."
Professor Smith advocated the plan
of reserving one-half hour a day for
reading on some subject which is
neither amusement or concerned with
one's work. After books of this type
have been discovered it soon becomes
a matter of mere'y selecting from the
vast material presented.
The greatest amount of attention
should be given to the development of
character, rather than to physical well
being or to orderliness of mind,
though the last two are important.
However, even in the presence of
these factors a man may fail to reach
success because he has neglected char
acter development.
Success Means Responsibility.
The successful man is the one who
is willing to assume responsibility.
Professor Smith told of the office boy
who was asked if he knew the loca
tion of a certain building. "No, but I
can find out," he answered. That boy
is now head of a great industry.
Songs for the California game were
practiced before and after the lecture.
The assembly concluded with "Hail,
Stanford, Hail," words of which were
written by Professor Smith more than
twenty years ago. The music for the
hymn was arranged by his wife, who
based it on an old Spanish melody.
The song was originally intended to
interpret the carefree spirit of Califor
nia and was inspired by the beauty of
Stanford's setting.
