# BABE SOCCER ELEVEN TO PLAY HIGH SCHOOL
## 
### 
The freshman soccer team will meet
the Half Moon Bay high school team
in a practice game on the varsity field
this afternoon. The Half Moon Bay
lads have a strong aggregation and
Should give the freshmen some stiff
competition although the Babes are
expected to emerge victorious.
Early in the season the varsity
played two practice games with the
Half Moon team. The first was a tie,
and in the second the varsity won by
a narrow margin. The freshmen are
playing about as good a game now as
the varsity did then, and these scores
should give an indication of what the
game today will be like.
The same line-up will start for the
freshmen that started in the California
freshman game. This line-up will be:
Forest, goal; Macaya and David, full
backs; Smith, Bushnell and Coleman,
halfbacks; and Strong, Bailard (capt.),
Mun, West, and Coleman, forwards.
