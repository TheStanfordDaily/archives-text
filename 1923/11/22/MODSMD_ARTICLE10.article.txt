## 
### David Lamson 
"Hey, frosli!"
"Kiss the Law Steps!"
"Sing! Dance! Your prep school
yell!"
"Hooray! Whee-e-e-e-e!"
The lines, repeated indefinitely, sum
up the events of Stanford's first de
natured Roughs' Day. The occasion
was celebrated for the most part at
the Law Steps, with a few demonstra
tions at Engineering Corner.
Freshmen were almost the only per
formers during the morning. The frosh
got their first intensive work-out of
the quarter; the spanking machine
wont into action early in the day.
Senior Control Performs
Little attempt was made by upper
classmen to stage stunts, although at
least one member of the Senior Con
trol Committee, as well as the leading
-exponent of the senior sponsor system,
were involuntary contributors to the
general festivities.
Bizarre and original costumes were
fewer in number than in former years.
The great majority of the roughs con
sidered whiskers and no neckties a
sufficient concession to the day. The
usual number of tramps and nonde
script outfits were in evidence, while
a few costumes showed commendable

ingenuity on the part of their origi
nators.
The crowd showed, on the whole, a
willingness to abide by the rules laid
down for conduct. Activities were kept
from the Quad, and no instances of
violation of other regulations have
been reported.
"Mercury" Arrives on Roller Coaster
Mercury with a little roller coaster
and a flirtive whirlagig on his air
plane hat; a "hug© black one-eyed
man;" Columbus with his atlas, his
simple hat, and his flowing coat; the
golf artist with laundry bay trousers,
a crutch and a bat for club; a Cali
fornia football man. limping on
crutches; a jockey; a constabul-e; the
personification of that school-girl com
plexion; soldiers from anywhere and
everywhere; cowboys; the übiquitous
drunk; the organ grinder; and fifty
others supplied color. "Dr. Franklin's
oil" was widely and humorously ad
vertised by one of the few upperclass
entertainers. Quart photogr iphers
were busy with cameras, eenteriiiK
chiefly about the Law steps. The an
nouncement that no Economics class
es would meet brought the main crowd
to the steps, with a short adjournment,
to the Library.
