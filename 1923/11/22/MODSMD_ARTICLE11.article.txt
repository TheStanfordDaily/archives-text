# HIGH SCHOOL HOLDS BABE SOCCER TEAM TO SCORELESS TIE
## 
### 
The freshmen and Half Moon Bay
high school soccer teams battled to a
0-0 tie yesterday afternoon on the
varsity soccer field.
The freshmen had the ball in the
high school team's territory most of
the time, but the forward lliie lacked
the punch to put over scores when
the goal was within striking distance.
The high school forwards were fast,
and the entire team displayed a good
brand of teamwork which kept the
babes busy to keep their goal from
being crossed. The score yesterday
was the same that the varsity and the
Half Moon Bay team registered early
in the season.
Forest played his usual good game
at goal for the babes. Time after time
he caught the ball as it was about to
enter the net, and drove it out a safe
distance from the goal. David at left
full played a good defensive game, and
gave Forest considerable aid in keep
ing the high school men from scoring.
The backs showed the best straight
soccer. Smith at right half and Bush
nell at center half showed ability in
tasking the ball away from the high
school team and sending it down to
the forwards.
With the exception of Mison. who
played inside right, the forward line
proved ineffective. They carried the
ball down the field, but couldn't get
it by the Half Moon Bay goalkeeper.
