# Three Faculty Members To Go on Private Hunt After Bears; All Armed
## 
### 
The "bear" hunting fever has spread
even to the faculty. After watching
the team chase the "Bears" around
the new Berkeley Stadium, Saturday,
pean Culver, Dr. Alonzo Taylor, and
Professor Stewart Young are going to
do a little bear hunting themselves,
just to get the limit.
A machine will be waiting outside
the stadium, all ready for camping,
and as soon as the game ends the
party starts for the Klamath River,
Siskiyou County, in the northern part
of the state, for trout fishing and bear
hunting. The Dean is especially anx
ious to get some of the fine "steel
head" trout that are in that part of
the country. However, the other mem
bers of the party are not worrying,
as a 500-pound bear was killed in that
county only a short time ago, accord
ing to the San Francisco Chronicle.
The Dean states that he and his
fellow campers intend to stay about
a week, spending Thanksgiving in the
mountains. They ought to be able to
tell some pretty good ones when they
get back, after being out after both
fish and bear.
