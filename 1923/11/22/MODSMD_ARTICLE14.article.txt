# STAGE IS SET FOR 1923 BIG GAME ON SATURDAY
## Contest Will Be First Real Proof of Warner System; Entire Pacific Coast Awaits Final Outcome 
### 
The stage is set for the biggest football play in the history
of Stanford and California gridiron combats. Seventy-six
thousand tickets have been sold, and seventy-six thousand
people will be pulling for either the blue or red shirted war
riors until the new Memorial stadium has been dedicated
with victory by one or the other.
Both elevens are in the pink of condition. California has
the edge, both physically and psychologically; both teams
have fight, and Stanford especially will make a superhuman
effort to prove that there is a place on the football map for
Cardinal gridmen.

r ' Overconfidence the Cards do not
countenance. Confidence they have,
to be sure, but they realize at the
same time they are bucking against
one of the most formidable elevens
on the Pacific Coast. It is not the
best football team California has
ever turned out, but it is one which
i has been sufficiently powerful to
whip decisively every opponent this
season, with the exception of
Nevada.
There will be blundefs, many of
them. Imagine waiting to catch
the punt that might mean the game,
with 76,000 eyes rivted upon your
next move! That's what makes the
psychological theories seem so ra
tional. Only the experienced player
is able absolutely to ignore the
crowd, and it is the greenhorn who j
nervously glances toward the
bleachers. Who will take advantage!
of the blunders depends, of course, 1
upon who pulls the brodie.
This is Andy Kerr's last season
as head coach. There is no need
to discuss the wonders that the little
mentor has wrought of what
seemed hopeless material last year.;
Now Andy is ready to step out of i
the van and let his team show what j
one year of training under a new sys
tem, with competent coaching can do
against competition which has devel
oped for four years under one method.
Kerr has made brilliant open field
runners out of second-rate backfield
men; he has built up a defense which
is a Chinese wall in the pinches, and
with all this he has paved the way
for the real Big Game, not the Big
Game for Stanford and Berkeley, but
for the entire Pacific Conference.
Nothing Stanford has used this year
could be classed as anything but
straight football, and it may be that
in the strong, driving style game lies
Stanford's fundamental strength.
Sport writers are saying that Stan
ford will have the advantage on Cali
fornia in the forward passing offens
ive. The Cards have not depended a
great deal on this method of gaining,
but in few instances have been able
to work a pass to good advantage. But
Stanford is relatively weak in this de
partment; they have not the brilliant
passing system displayed by Washing
ton and Idaho, and to lean too strong
ly on this advantage would be fool
hardy.
The encouraging part of it all is
that this is Stanford's greatest chance
for victory in five years. Moral vic
tories and alibis are buried with the
coming of the Warner system. There
will be good, possibly better, Stanford
teams in the future, but this is Stan
ford's first chance to really prove that
wonder teams have and can be de
feated.

with victory by one or the other.
Both elevens are in the pink of condition. California has
the edge, both physically and psychologically; both teams
have fight, and Stanford especially will make a superhuman
effort to prove that there is a place on the football map for
Cardinal gridmen.

r ' Overconfidence the Cards do not
countenance. Confidence they have,
to be sure, but they realize at the
same time they are bucking against
one of the most formidable elevens
on the Pacific Coast. It is not the
best football team California has
ever turned out, but it is one which
i has been sufficiently powerful to
whip decisively every opponent this
season, with the exception of
Nevada.
There will be blundefs, many of
them. Imagine waiting to catch
the punt that might mean the game,
with 76,000 eyes rivted upon your
next move! That's what makes the
psychological theories seem so ra
tional. Only the experienced player
is able absolutely to ignore the
crowd, and it is the greenhorn who j
nervously glances toward the
bleachers. Who will take advantage!
of the blunders depends, of course, 1
upon who pulls the brodie.
This is Andy Kerr's last season
as head coach. There is no need
to discuss the wonders that the little
mentor has wrought of what
seemed hopeless material last year.;
Now Andy is ready to step out of i
the van and let his team show what j
one year of training under a new sys
tem, with competent coaching can do
against competition which has devel
oped for four years under one method.
Kerr has made brilliant open field
runners out of second-rate backfield
men; he has built up a defense which
is a Chinese wall in the pinches, and
with all this he has paved the way
for the real Big Game, not the Big
Game for Stanford and Berkeley, but
for the entire Pacific Conference.
Nothing Stanford has used this year
could be classed as anything but
straight football, and it may be that
in the strong, driving style game lies
Stanford's fundamental strength.
Sport writers are saying that Stan
ford will have the advantage on Cali
fornia in the forward passing offens
ive. The Cards have not depended a
great deal on this method of gaining,
but in few instances have been able
to work a pass to good advantage. But
Stanford is relatively weak in this de
partment; they have not the brilliant
passing system displayed by Washing
ton and Idaho, and to lean too strong
ly on this advantage would be fool
hardy.
The encouraging part of it all is
that this is Stanford's greatest chance
for victory in five years. Moral vic
tories and alibis are buried with the
coming of the Warner system. There
will be good, possibly better, Stanford
teams in the future, but this is Stan
ford's first chance to really prove that
wonder teams have and can be de
feated.
The stage is set for the biggest football play in the history
of Stanford and California gridiron combats. Seventy-six
thousand tickets have been sold, and seventy-six thousand
people will be pulling for either the blue or red shirted war
riors until the new Memorial stadium has been dedicated
with victory by one or the other.
