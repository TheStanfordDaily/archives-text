# STANFORD ATHLETIC SYSTEM IS PRAISED BY DR. W. B. BOVARD
## 
### 
"I have seen no university where rec
reational sport is as well developed as it
is at Stanford," was the statement made
by Warren B. Bovard who was a visitor
on the Stanford campus for a few days
last week. Dr. Bovard is the director of
the physical education and personal hy
giene departments at the University of
Oregon.
He is a member of thq Presidents'
Committee of Fifty, which was appointed
by the combined university presidents in
the country to investigate health condi
tions in American universities.
Dr. Bovard says of Stanford, "The
physical education departments in other
schools have a more highly developed sys
tem of classwork, but the admirable
spirit of having general participation in
all branches of. competitive sports is
more notable here than anywhere else I
have seen."
Figures compiled by the Physical Edu
cation department from a complete cen
sus taken during the first two weeks in
November show that slightly more than
1600 men report regularly for some kind
of athletic work, 979 of these men ful
filling lower division requirements and
622 giving voluntary attendance. Men
who arc taking military work, who are
physically unqualified, or who are non
resident students are estimated at 400.
This leaves only about 200, from the 2200
men enrolled in the University. Hence,
only 1 out of every 9 men are not regu
larly enrolled in some physical education
class.
Three possible explanations for this
remarkable showing in athletics have
been advanced. The University's fine
grounds and equipment; the policy of
keeping away from formal gymnasium
work; and the exceptional climate of the
region in which the campus is situated.
