"When that team needs a few yards, when that
few yards means the difference between a score and
a loss, we want you up there in the bleachers to get
back of the team, and grunt, and heave, and help to
gain those yards."
So said Andy Kerr to 4000 people in the stadium
last night. To the crowd of alumni, undergraduates,
and plain Stanford supporters, that statement meant
one thing: that the Stanford varsity was counting
on the rooting to help in the pinches, that the team
NEEDED that support, and that when they felt
the force of the rooting section solidly behind them
they could make those extra yards.
When the varsity trots out on the field, amid the
din, confusion, and varied hopes of 76,000 people,
they will know that one solid block of that roaring
mass of humanity is placing all its hope and all its
confidence in their efforts.
When the varsity is battling against the blue with
one plunge left to hold its offensive, it will feel the
unwavering, unquestioning support of 2500 people
up in the stands. With that combination back of
them, with the bleachers pulling in time with the
Cardinal line down on the field, Stanford men can
not fail on the night of November 24 in their hope
to dine on bear meat.
