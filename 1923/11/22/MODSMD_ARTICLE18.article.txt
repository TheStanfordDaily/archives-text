# The 						Moonlight Rally
## 
### 
The barking echo of a united Stanford cheering as
it has never cheered before, the boom of guns of
the R. O. T. C., the spotlights, the fireworks, the
crowd of 4000 filling up the west bleachers â€”all
gave proof that the Big Game rally this year, located
in the stadium, was the biggest noise assembly Stan
ford has ever witnessed.
When a brilliant idea develops like using the
stadium for the final outburst of Stanford's pent up
enthusiasm, one doesn't stop to question its effective
ness, one wonders why nobody thought of it before.
The possibilities of the stadium as a setting for
the Big Game rally were only touched in the cele
bration last night. Yet so successful was this year's
gathering of noise fiends that one thought only of
the new "stunts" that could be put on with the
I)enefit of a year's experience of a rally by moonlight
to help them.
