# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: â€”
Just a word, Mr. Editor, to Mr. Spectator, who
laments the time-worn manner in which fax-seeing stu
dents stimulated interest and support for bleachers in
the basketball pavilion, and who yet uses far more out
of-date tears and slams in his editorial column to stimu
late interest in a magazine. What's the matter with Mr.
Spectator? Can't he build on a decently solid foundation
without the bla-bla bursted bubble type of stuff. We'll
agree it is, in his own words, "admittedly successful,"
but if he must do it why not admit it, as Hearst does?
"Facts" by Mr. Spectator
And he tears into the freshmen (bla-ing the sponsors)
because they sometimes do not carry matches or speak
to him, and in his whole dissertation of condemnation
forgets what is mentioned in his own next column, these
same freshmen beat California. The discredit for mythi
cal booing which no one heard goes to an audience "ex
clusively freshmen" (were they the only members of the
University interested enough to attend the game), and
the credit for winning is not for them. They did not win
for the first time, as Mr. Spectator, who seeks facts,
said. His research for fact in the criticism of sponsors
was as evident as that in the comment of the game, in
which he overlooked a whole string of victories. Could
not Mr. Spec leave his desk and find out a few things
about both sponsors and freshman games before he
wrote?
Is the Upper-Class Standard Better?
And now Mr. Spectator, about meeting the freshman
wjio did not speak. How about the freshman who goes
out cheerily to speak to all upperclassmen, and fails to
get a nod out of six in the first ten. How is he, a new
comer, to feel about it? Try, Mr. Spectator, at your
leisure when you have not any "facts" to investigate,
waiking from the Engineers corner to the postoffice,
as three old timers did separately last week] Here are
the averages. Ten of eighteen upperclassmen spoke AF
TER THEY SPOKE FIRST. "Swallow that, and criticize
the sponsors because some of the freshmen are dis
couraged. And set up a 100 per cent standard for fresh
men. when the rest of the university can't live up half
that well.
Who Made Matches a Tradition?
Did ou. Mr. Spec, at any time during the last week,
see large trucks, drawn by fifty or sixty freshmen,
most of them with dinks on though they were working,
carrying material for a bonfire. A pretty rotten spirit.
And come back with that criticism we have heard
recently, three 'freshmen did rrot carry matches.
Matches, may I suggest, go with pledge pins and not
with Stanford traditions. They are a fraternity idea.
No non-fraternity freshmen were ever asked to carry
matches, in my day. and I have been here fully as long
as you or "A. C. M." I feel safe in saying.
Judge By the Standard Of Tradition
Continually hollering about freshmen. I was here in
the good old tubbing days, have been tubbed, and
helped tub others, and there never was any less com
plaining than right now. As long as we must hold
forth traditions all the time, let's judge by the standard
tradition itself has set. No group of freshmen in my
tfme ever spoke more, wore more dinks, or queened
less, or told upperclassmen to go to hell less, than
this present bunch. Maybe you, Mr. Spectator, with
your uncanny ability to get facts, can point out a class
which was better, but I can tell you that your own was
not, and neither was the present sophomore class.
The Freshmen Are Trying
Too bad, Mr. Spectator, that the freshman does not
enjoy an opportunity to meet upperclassmen. But Mr.
Spectator, how many older men does a freshman meet
when he joins a fraternity, the only alternative to the
present plan, which you condemn? Not any more than
now, and you know it. And how many more of the men
of his own class will he know well, when the year is
over, if he stays where he is? A lot more, and you
know that too. And which is the most important, that
he should develope friendships among his own class
men, of his own choice, or friendships of three or four
freshmen and the same number of other classes, of
some one's else choice for him. Better wait the year
out, Mr. Spec, and see how many people these freshmen
know, of all classes.
And when talking of freshmen, give them credit for
one thing. As a group they are TRYING, mighty hard,
to get in the right swing. They are doing aa well as
any class has done in the first two months, and whole
sale criticisms, without suggestions for improvement,
do not help them one bit. We know you are helping
the circulation of your magazine, Mr. Spectator, and
maybe you need it, but you are not helping the freshmen.
W. L., '21.
