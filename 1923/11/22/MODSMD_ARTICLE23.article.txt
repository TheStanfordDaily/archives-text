Somewhere today a
dignified, aloof
man goes about his
business with an
impregnable reserve
in his manner. You
would hardly expect
a charging lioness
to ruffle his
perfect poise.

utterly bourgeois.
But witness this
same gentleman at
A Certain Football
Game on Saturday—
A jumping, purple
faced, bellowing,
arm-slinging maniac
hammering the derby
of the man in front
of him with all the
aborignal insanity
of the normal male.
