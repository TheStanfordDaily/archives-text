# BIGGEST AND BEST RALLY CELEBRATED
## Crowd of 5,000 Hears Campbell, Kerr, and Alumni In Stadium 
### David Lamson 
"T* hell with the Gold and Blue!"
Wherein is summed up the spirit of Stanford's biggest, best and noisiest
Big Game rally, held in the stadium last evening. Whether that spirit was
expressed in speeches, in gun fire, or in lour and unintelligible chant, it all
amounted to the same thing.
Record Crowd Present
More than 5000 people jammed the west bank of the stadium, and they all
joined in on the chorus. .(See above.) Everyone for five miles around knew
what Stanford thinks of its team and of the Big Game; and the echoes of that
sentiment hust have been clearly heard across the bay. ,
The affair started with a rip-roaring parade to the stadium. Even before
the rooters arrived, the bleachers were well filled. The band played; six
shooters vied with cannon in creating a disturbance; fireworks flared and
sparkled—and the crowd yelled. Boy, they yelled. "The spirit shown here

tonight is the finest thing I have ever
seen," Coach Andy Kerr said.
"Will Win" Says Kerr
The coach predicted a Stanford vic
tory Saturday—with two "ifs" in his
statement. "If the team plays as it is
capable of playing, and if you give it
the right sort of support, we will dedi
cate the new bowl," he said. "Rooters
must play the game with the team. If
you want two yards, you've got to get
in and grunt and heave and live the
play with the squad."
Other speakers, with the exception
of Captain "Scotchy" Campbell, were
less conservative in their remarks.
