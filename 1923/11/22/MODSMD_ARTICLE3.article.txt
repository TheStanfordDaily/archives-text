# BIGGEST AND BEST RALLY CELEBRATED
## Crowd of 5,000 Hears Campbell, Kerr, and Alumni In Stadium 
### David Lamson 
"T* hell with the Gold and Blue!"
Wherein is summed up the spirit of Stanford's biggest, best and noisiest
Big Game rally, held in the stadium last evening. Whether that spirit was
expressed in speeches, in gun fire, or in lour and unintelligible chant, it all
amounted to the same thing.
Record Crowd Present
More than 5000 people jammed the west bank of the stadium, and they all
joined in on the chorus. .(See above.) Everyone for five miles around knew
what Stanford thinks of its team and of the Big Game; and the echoes of that
sentiment hust have been clearly heard across the bay. ,
The affair started with a rip-roaring parade to the stadium. Even before
the rooters arrived, the bleachers were well filled. The band played; six
shooters vied with cannon in creating a disturbance; fireworks flared and
sparkled—and the crowd yelled. Boy, they yelled. "The spirit shown here

tonight is the finest thing I have ever
seen," Coach Andy Kerr said.
"Will Win" Says Kerr
The coach predicted a Stanford vic
tory Saturday—with two "ifs" in his
statement. "If the team plays as it is
capable of playing, and if you give it
the right sort of support, we will dedi
cate the new bowl," he said. "Rooters
must play the game with the team. If
you want two yards, you've got to get
in and grunt and heave and live the
play with the squad."
Other speakers, with the exception
of Captain "Scotchy" Campbell, were
less conservative in their remarks.
"Scotchy" refused to come right out
and say Stanford would win; but he
promised a fight worth walking miles
for.
Alumni Speak
Parmer Fuller, '10, has seen Cali
fornia play three times and Stanford
play five times this season.
"Stanford is conceded a fifty-fifty
chance, and Stanford always plays
thirty per cent better against Cali
fornia than against any other team,"
he said. "The wonderful Golden Bear
is going to be a mangey-looking ani
mal next Saturday." Ed Cunha, '05,
urged the rooters to give the team the
support it deserves, and predicted a
Stanford dedication. "It is Stanford's
turn," he said, "and this is the year."
"Dutch" Roth. University comptrol
ler, introduced the speakers. "Whether
you pay no tuition or double tuition
liext year depends on the outcome of
Saturday's game," he said. Calm down,
though; he was only fooling.
Roth read telegrams from alumni
groups in Portland, Phoenix, Laramie,
Seattle, and Minneapolis, all pulling
for a Stanford dedication of the new
bowl. He also read a telegram to Cap
tain Campbell from President Wilbur.
"Pajamarino" Burlesqued
Ram's Head society staged what
proved to be one of the most popular
stunts of the rally in its burlesque of
the California pajamarino rally. The
bonfire, the student body, the different
classes, Coach Andy Smith and his
Wonder Team were caricatured, to
the huge delight of the bleachers.
At the close of the more or less
formal program, the rooters rehearsed
the serpentine on the field, in prepara
tion for after the game next Satur
day. The serpentine proceeded to the
bonfire, the highest ever built. A final
group of songs and yells, ending with
the Hymn, another brief serpentine
about the dying fire —and the rally
was over.
