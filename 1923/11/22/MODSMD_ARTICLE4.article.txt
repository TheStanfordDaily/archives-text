strong Olympic Club team tomorrow

considered the strongest swimming or
ganization west of Chicago.

tionaly known record-holders who un
doubtedly will give Stanford plenty of
competition," said Brandsten yesterday.
"Lester Smith is one of the best
220-yard men in the United States;
Jack Robertson in the hundred has
been making remarkably fast time;
Jack Hall in the breast stroke was a
member of the United States team at
the Antwerp Olympic Games; Phil
Austin is a former Stanford star; while
Clarence Pinkston has held the world's
high diving championship title for the
last four years.
O'Conner Expected to Place First
"Of the Cardinal swimmers, we have
Wallace O'Connor in the two-twenty
who will probably repeat his victory
of last Friday over Smith of the
"Winged O," from whom he took the
Pacific Coast championship kit that
distance. I believe that, this with the
relay, will be the deciding race of the
meet."
A1 White, runner up to Pinkerton in
last year's diving championship meet,
it is hoped, will make the latter go ex
tend himself to take first in that event.
Dave Fall, a new man from Oregon,
is coming along well and may place.
James Hawley, Pacific Coast cham
pion in the plunge for distance, has the
edge in this event. Rolland Langley
