# Chappie Will Appear on Quad in Football Togs Early Tomorrow Morning
## 
### 
You can expect to see Chappie on
the campus tomorrow morning at 8
o'clock sharp in a wholly new set of
football togs and a shiny bearskin.
This time Chappie is not going to
stay at home. He is going to Berkeley
Saturday with all the rest of the boys
and can be obtained as a seat partner
at the entrance, to the new stadium
from any of his worthy assistants.
The cover shows the Cardinal full
back getting away with a big kick
while the husky Bear serenely moseys
along. Chappie's formal title heads the
page with nine little figures of cele
brating bleacher athletes in different
poses.
Ely Writes on Thanksgiving
A clever little ditty on Thanksgiving
by Chappie's editor, Mike Ely, opens
the issue. Following it is a frontispiece
of neat design by George Thompson,
with a not-clearly-original caption. L.
Stanley Wheate exhibits an attractive
drawing with an intriguing ftey to the
picture. Plenty of local color is pre
sented in the double-page picture by
"Hap" Kennedy, who shows just how
the BeVkeley campus is apt to look to
the average student, win or lose.
Fred Fisher and Henry Mack have
contributed a page of food for thought
presenting the possibilities of the Fair
mont Hotel aftermath of the Big
Game.
A long-short story about Sir Gawaine
and the Merlin Coaching System is
similar to "Why Cows Moo" in the last
Chappie.
