# Oil Paintings By Typical American Artists Exhibited
## 
### 
Representative oil paintings by
American artists are now on exhibi
tion at the Thomas Welton Stanford
Art Gallery. Landscapes, sea scenes,
still life and portraits are included in
the collection which was made up in
the East from contributions of the
artists.
"Water Ways," by E. M. Ashe, re
presents flat decorative detail in
"spot" painting. In this style artists
use the three primary colors, red, blue,
and yellow, in distinct spots. The vi
bration of the three colors placed near
together give an effect of all colors in
the rainbow. In "The Plougher," by
M. J. Rice, the vibrations are even
more pronounced.
"Eucalyptus Trees," by Cornelius
Botke, a Carmel artist, is painted in
the decorative style. A touch of scar
let in the branch of leaves gives char
acter to the grey background of the
trees, and a little path in the fore
ground is said, to show a fine effect
of distance.
Howard Hart gives an idea of the
impressionistic in his "Hay Stack and
Poppies." Contrary to the old detailed
style of 1883, the artist paints only
what one sees of the landscape at the
first glance—the first impression.
There is a reminder of Keith's rich
dark tones in "Rolling Hills." Modern
painters get the effect of the aged
paintings of the masters by giving
their canvasses * a coat of asphaltum
paint before beginning the real paint
ing of the picture.
An example of vigorous painting is
given in "Coast Scene," by Edward F.
Rook, showing the strong sea breakers
on the rocks. There is a solemn mono
chrome in the "Sea Scape" of S. M.
Chase, with its deep blues and grey
greens.
The exhibition will remain at the
gallery until December 9. It will be
followed by a collection of water
colors by American painters.
