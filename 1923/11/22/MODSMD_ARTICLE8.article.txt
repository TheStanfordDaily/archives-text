struction and cruelty," says Dr. Jordan.
"The Ruhr invasion is as unjust as it is
illegal and futile and if continued, will
insure a terrible revenge.
"When national defense becomes the
instrument for the collection of bad debts,
tliere is a condition as dangerous as it
isj immoral and unjust.' Nothing could
btjmore hopeless than the situation abroad
tofcay. With its lawless invasion, its sec
r<Jt struggles for iron and oil, the domin
ation of «;ach nation" by sinister group's,
the starvation, and bankruptcy of people
everywhere.
"A year ago [ said that the condition
of continental Europe was just as bad as
it could be and would steadily grow
worse. I repeat the same prophecy today,
hoping against hope that it will not be
fulfilled."
