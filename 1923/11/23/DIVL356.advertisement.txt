"We know that Saturday's game
with Stanford will be a battle until
the end. The 1923 Stanford Varsity
has proven that it is a dangerous
and powerful team, one that can
do the unexpected and unlooked for.
The California Varsity, on the other
hand ,is going into the game not
over-confident, but with a deter
mined idea of winning.
"We are going to try to dedi
cate our new Stadium properly, but
which ever team wins, it should be
a battle royal."
CAPTAIN DON NICHOLS.
