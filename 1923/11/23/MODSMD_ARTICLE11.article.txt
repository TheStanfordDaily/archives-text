# THE 						COLOR OF LIFE IS RED

Two catnpfires are burning" tonight somewhere off in the California
hills. Around them are grouped the men on whom the hopes of 76,000
people are centered. The Stanford and California varsities, taken away
from the din and cheers of their respective campuses, are being urged
by their coaches to think of anything and everything but football.

Over at Berkeley, in a canyon in the brown hills, a huge bowl lies
waiting in the moonlight; its tiers of seats, rising in gleaming steps,
await the crowds that will surge to its gates with the coming of morning.
In twelve hours its slopes will be a seething, throbbing bank of humanity,
holding itself in impatient restraint for one small sound: the crack of
a starter's gun down on the turf below.

Beneath glowing yellow lamps, amid the click of telegraph keys and
the rustle of papers, sporting writers in tall office buildings are pounding
out their last columns of prophecies, statistics, and invocations, which
will flood the city and its suburbs by morning, to be read by thousands
journeying across the bay, and other thousands who will wish they could
join the pilgrimage.

Under red-tiled roofs of Stanford the hearts of 2700 students are
beating high with the hope of seeing the Cardinal wave once more
supremely, after four years of biting, sodden defeat. In the minds of
every student is a picture of a thin red line, dancing, weaving, twisting,
over a green field in the serpentine of victory, while California rooters
stand and watch their magnificent stadium dedicated by the foe.
Somewhere, deep in the being of every man under those red roofs, is
the certain knowledge that nothing can stop that Red machine of battle
in its onward sweep to triumph.

That is the setting for the 1923 Big Game between the Cardinal and
the Ciold and Blue. On its result hangs not only the Championship of the
West, but the vindication of a spirit which has made a college small and
isolated, with a student body puny in proportion, always the feared and
hated foe of a state university whose masses of students make it second
in size in the United States.
After it is all over, and nothing remains but scattered papers and torn
turf, telegraph wires over the land will hum with the old story of the
underdog who finally triumphed over the crushing weight of years of
defeat, or they will tell the country of a gallant battle ending in postpone
ment of final victory for yet another year.
Meanwhile, let us remember, with the men around that fire off in
the darkening hills, that nothing can stop the Cardinal team while the
spirit of life is left.
