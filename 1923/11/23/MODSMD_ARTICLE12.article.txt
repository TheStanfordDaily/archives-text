It is the year 1993 A. D.
Assembled on the eve of the Big
Game, to he played at Stanford, is the
Stanford Club of Mooscjaw, Alaska, a
vast city producing almost the entire
world's supply of radium used to power
the great liners of the air and turn the
wheels o findustry. The Club is in the
midst of a monster dinner and rally in
preparation for the journey southward
on the morrow. Present at the meet
ing arc some of the Farm's most dis
tinguishing alumni, including such fig
ures as John Donald Campbell, Jr.,
aged president of the Amalgamated Air
Lines of the Globe, and Bill Brogan
111, secretary of the Allied Waiters of
the World.

After cocktails are served, one of the
old grads delivers a stirring account
of the Big Game in 'S3, the last con
test held in the old Stanford Stadium,

which only held a scant 65,000 peo
ple. The Cards won, 28-0. "And now,
men of Stanford," finished the old
man, "we have another great opportu
nity to defeat the Golden Bear and
dedicate our wonderful new stadium,
with its unparalleled capacity of 300,-
000 souls!" (deafening cheers and
clinking of glasses).
i $ *
Just as the men, filled with great
spirits, are about to leave, a messenger
dashes into the hall and hands an
ethergram to the president. He reads
it hastily, his normally ruddy face
blanching as the words leap at him
from the page. There is an ominous
rumble among the throng. The presi
dent's clenched hand goes up for
silence. "Listen, men of Stanford!"
he commands in a voice like authumn
thunder, 'We have just received word
from our scout at Berkeley. He says:
"By a unanimous vote of the student

body here today, it was irrevocably de
cided that the Bear varsity would score
three points on Stanford. The decision
came about only after the greatest
courage had been summoned by the
students'."
* * *
Red fire leaped from the president's
eyes. "Are we going to allow Califor
nia to score against us for the first time
since the fall of 1922, men of Stan
ford?'
jHELL NO!" exploded a thousand
throats, and the mighty shout rose
through the roof, split the welkin in
twain and traveled to the uttermost
outposts of the earth. Stanford had
decided.
"Then let us sail within the hour to
the red-roofed home of our Alma
Mater, in the "Flaming Ave," the
leviathan of the skies which Mr. Camp
bell has prepared for our convenience.
Two hours are required for the trip to
Palo Alto, where every loyal son is
needed immediately to help thwart
this new danger." (Cheers, and the
roar of giant motors, warming up, in
the distance.)

decided.
"Then let us sail within the hour to
the red-roofed home of our Alma
Mater, in the "Flaming Ave," the
leviathan of the skies which Mr. Camp
bell has prepared for our convenience.
Two hours are required for the trip to
Palo Alto, where every loyal son is
needed immediately to help thwart
this new danger." (Cheers, and the
roar of giant motors, warming up, in
the distance.)
It is the year 1993 A. D.
Assembled on the eve of the Big
Game, to he played at Stanford, is the
Stanford Club of Mooscjaw, Alaska, a
vast city producing almost the entire
world's supply of radium used to power
the great liners of the air and turn the
wheels o findustry. The Club is in the
midst of a monster dinner and rally in
preparation for the journey southward
on the morrow. Present at the meet
ing arc some of the Farm's most dis
tinguishing alumni, including such fig
ures as John Donald Campbell, Jr.,
aged president of the Amalgamated Air
Lines of the Globe, and Bill Brogan
111, secretary of the Allied Waiters of
the World.

After cocktails are served, one of the
old grads delivers a stirring account
of the Big Game in 'S3, the last con
test held in the old Stanford Stadium,

which only held a scant 65,000 peo
ple. The Cards won, 28-0. "And now,
men of Stanford," finished the old
man, "we have another great opportu
nity to defeat the Golden Bear and
dedicate our wonderful new stadium,
with its unparalleled capacity of 300,-
000 souls!" (deafening cheers and
clinking of glasses).

Just as the men, filled with great
spirits, are about to leave, a messenger
dashes into the hall and hands an
ethergram to the president. He reads
it hastily, his normally ruddy face
blanching as the words leap at him
from the page. There is an ominous
rumble among the throng. The presi
dent's clenched hand goes up for
silence. "Listen, men of Stanford!"
he commands in a voice like authumn
thunder, 'We have just received word
from our scout at Berkeley. He says:
"By a unanimous vote of the student

body here today, it was irrevocably de
cided that the Bear varsity would score
three points on Stanford. The decision
came about only after the greatest
courage had been summoned by the
students'."
* * *
Red fire leaped from the president's
eyes. "Are we going to allow Califor
nia to score against us for the first time
since the fall of 1922, men of Stan
ford?'
jHELL NO!" exploded a thousand
throats, and the mighty shout rose
through the roof, split the welkin in
twain and traveled to the uttermost
outposts of the earth. Stanford had
decided.
