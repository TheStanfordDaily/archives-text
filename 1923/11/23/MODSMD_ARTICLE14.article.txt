## PSEUDO-PSYCHOPATHIC FACTORS OF THE BIG, GAME, AND ALL THAT 
### 
Cheering causes the team to take heart and a few touchdowns, says Andy.
The light of science has brought these further facts from the notebook of our
ptych. expert, who got an A in the mid-quarter and hasn't gotten over it yet:
Hoo-rah Yell is better for scoring field goals.
Noticing will get a touchdown quicker than a locomotive, except, possibly
singing "Writing On the Tombstone" off-key.
Two good ways of weakening the opponents' defense are (1) using a
machine gun, and (2) giving a skyrocket for the Stanford freshmen.
Color has a decided influence upon victory. Saying that "The stands
were a blaze of color" always scores big with news editors.
Protective coloration is exemplified by a red-headed California man.

I pledge the kiss
Whose poignant bliss
Comes from the microbes, so they say.
A microbe, ho!
If this be so,
It pleaseth in a ticklish way!
And so I say:
"Since men must die
Of microbe that and microbe this,
I'd like to sip
The fatal lip
And take my microbe in a kiss."
—Melancholy Moron.

Last night we dusted off the old Weigie board, and let our idle fingers
take this dictation from Pocohonta's grand-son, Ikie:
"California no damn good. Indian heap better. Bear too much bone;
bone, all time bone. Him licked him have moral bone; him win him have
ticklish bone. Me bettum six tomahawk to one Squaw Indian skin Bear.
Bear color heap yellow. Indian color heap red. Bear all same papoose.
Make lotta noise."

During struggle of I. U. R. vs. C. A. W., 1,000,000 rooters will vociferously
cheer representative organizations on to murder. Such yells, led by Haig
Brothers, as 'Go I, Go U, R-I-and-U-going. Horseradish!" and "Caw! Woof!
Caw! Old Crow —hie!" will rent air and clothing. Remaining three members
of C. W. C. (Contributors to Worthy Caws) will wonder which ring is main
attraction.
No. I—Single Threat —Wrong halfback draws "cinch" notice from behind
left ear and waves furiously in air. Such demonstration causes opposing
organization to frantically retreat to side-lines for books. Halfback then
extricates wheelbarrow from remaining ear and rides for touchdown.
No. 2 —Thermoplae Pass —Center underslungs pass to left-out who immedi
ately, with due caution, tosses it to right-behind who takes shaving mug and
razor and by close shave rings up six points.
No. 3—Quadruple Threat, used on Marshall Field by College of Bang team
captained by Billy—Front line trench assumes horizontal position while
quarterback either takes Napoleonic attitude, winds wrist watch, uses putter,
or otherwise. This strategy greatly confuses opposing organization which
thinks he is about to begin a Red Cross drive and he is easily able to throw
himself for a home-run.
