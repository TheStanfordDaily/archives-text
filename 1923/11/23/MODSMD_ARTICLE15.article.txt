# Barbers to Give Free Haircut and Shave for Blocked Punt or Score
## 
### 
"Shave 'n hair cut —six bits" has
undergone a revision on the "Farm"
of late.
Ted and Louis of the "Block S"
tonsorial establishment in Palo Alto
have changed the ditty to "Shave 'n
haircut—blocked punt." Or, if one
wishes, according to the pair, it may
be warbled "shave 'n haircut—touch
down."
In other words Ted and Lewis have
made an offer to Cardinal gridsters—
namely, that whoever succeeds in
stopping an opposing punt or cross
ing an opposing goal will receive a
"Block S" haircut and shave gratis.
Real spirit, we'd say .
