# Feminine Fans Thrilled Over Berkeley Game
## 
### Katherine Capell 
Every member of the Minority-who
may-not-yell is looking forward to the
event of tomorrow as anxiously as are
members of the Majority-who-may,
whether it is her first Big Game, or her
last.
First of the thrills that await her,
of course, is the new Memorial Sta
dium, whose dedication she is attend
ing. Of course she is curious to see
whether it is at all like she has imag
ined it, and especially whether it has
so many stairs to be climbed up and
down, as the one at home, or even—
Heaven prevent!—more.
Visiting a foreign campus, seeing
the enemy in its native haunts, de
scending upon "our Cal chapter" for
a meal or two, will give extra touches
to a day of breathless action. Then
there is the question, shall she come
straggling home to a deserted campus,
or stay at her chum's in the city, piled
in with six or eight to the bed, and all
chattering at once?
She sighs with relief at the an
nouncement that she need not top her
holiday raiment with a tipsy-looking
rooter's cap. To be sure, last year's
hats were fairly becoming. But it is
one thing to wear a rakish flannel af
fair with a sports costume, at home on
the Stanford campus. It has an air
of Welcome-to-our-city that exudes

hosptality. It is quite another to don
satin slippers, silken garments, furs,
and those oh-so-rarely-worn gloves,
and then perch a red-and-white horror
above, like a wad of chewing gum
stuck on a hand-painted vase.
Besides, there is the dinner-dance
at the Fairmont afterwards, and she
wants to do justice to the occasion by
wearing that new hat. He has never
seen it. If it isn't the Fairmont, it will
be dinner some where, which brings up
the fervent prayer that he will win
those ten dollars, so that she can cele
brate without feeling like a gold-digger.
A casual mention of "some of the
fellows," and a "party" after the game,
inspired her with a fear that He will
participate, leaving her dateless while
he frolics through the streets of San
Francisco. But behind all the side
shows of the day, lies the same hope in
her mind as lies in that of every man
—to see a Stanford serpentine on the
field after the game.

nouncement that she need not top her
holiday raiment with a tipsy-looking
rooter's cap. To be sure, last year's
hats were fairly becoming. But it is
one thing to wear a rakish flannel af
fair with a sports costume, at home on
the Stanford campus. It has an air
of Welcome-to-our-city that exudes

hosptality. It is quite another to don
satin slippers, silken garments, furs,
and those oh-so-rarely-worn gloves,
and then perch a red-and-white horror
above, like a wad of chewing gum
stuck on a hand-painted vase.
Besides, there is the dinner-dance
at the Fairmont afterwards, and she
wants to do justice to the occasion by
wearing that new hat. He has never
seen it. If it isn't the Fairmont, it will
be dinner some where, which brings up
the fervent prayer that he will win
those ten dollars, so that she can cele
brate without feeling like a gold-digger.
A casual mention of "some of the
fellows," and a "party" after the game,
inspired her with a fear that He will
participate, leaving her dateless while
he frolics through the streets of San
Francisco. But behind all the side
shows of the day, lies the same hope in
her mind as lies in that of every man
—to see a Stanford serpentine on the
field after the game.


California's standbys. Left to right,

Don Nichols. Lower, Jack Witter.
Every member of the Minority-who
may-not-yell is looking forward to the
event of tomorrow as anxiously as are
members of the Majority-who-may,
whether it is her first Big Game, or her
last.
First of the thrills that await her,
of course, is the new Memorial Sta
dium, whose dedication she is attend
ing. Of course she is curious to see
whether it is at all like she has imag
ined it, and especially whether it has
so many stairs to be climbed up and
down, as the one at home, or even—
Heaven prevent!—more.
Visiting a foreign campus, seeing
the enemy in its native haunts, de
scending upon "our Cal chapter" for
a meal or two, will give extra touches
to a day of breathless action. Then
there is the question, shall she come
straggling home to a deserted campus,
or stay at her chum's in the city, piled
in with six or eight to the bed, and all
chattering at once?
She sighs with relief at the an
nouncement that she need not top her
