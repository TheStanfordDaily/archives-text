ments of good drama he thinks, for
conflict, thrills, mystery and surprise
will combine to keep the audience on
its toes with interest, while the happy
ending will guarante its remaining in
the minds of Stanford play-goers for

"All the actors in this dramatic clas
sic know their lines perfectly," said
Davis after witnessing a recent re
hearsal. "They have been drilled in the
mass action until the spectacular effect
of the grouping should be achieved
without a flaw, while the work of the

peal seldom reached in this section."
Although Davis has directed most
of the dramatic plays here in recent
years he has only been an ardent and
critical observer of this particular pro
