SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22—About
all the sport writers could say about
the Stanford team the week before
the Big Game for the last four years
was that "Stanford Will Fight." The
result was a foregone conclusion.
This year it is different. This year
Stanford has a real football team,
and the man who can guess the score
is a better man than I am Gordon Gin.
I know that Andy Smith, head coach
at California, will be content to win.
The score does not interest him.
It has been a long, hard pull at
Stanford to get a place in the sun,
but Stanford has arrived now, thanks
to Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill,
"Dink" Templeton, and the wonderful
spirit for which Stanford has always
been famous. The Big Game tomorrow
will be all that the words imply. The
two best teams on this Coast will be
battling and right now it looks to me
like a toss-up.
The game will be played in one of
the finest stadiums in the world; the
rooting and the stunts will surpass
anything of the kind in the country,
for nowhere do the rooters put on the
stunts that they show at the Cali-1
fornia-Stanford game. I have seen j
Yale and Harvard play and Chicago |
