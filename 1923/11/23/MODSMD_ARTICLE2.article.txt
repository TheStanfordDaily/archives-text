# ED HUGHES BALKS AT GUESSING BIG GAME FINAL COUNT
## 
### Ed R. Hughes 
of the San Francisco Chronicle
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22—About
all the sport writers could say about
the Stanford team the week before
the Big Game for the last four years
was that "Stanford Will Fight." The
result was a foregone conclusion.
This year it is different. This year
Stanford has a real football team,
and the man who can guess the score
is a better man than I am Gordon Gin.
I know that Andy Smith, head coach
at California, will be content to win.
The score does not interest him.
It has been a long, hard pull at
Stanford to get a place in the sun,
but Stanford has arrived now, thanks
to Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill,
"Dink" Templeton, and the wonderful
spirit for which Stanford has always
been famous. The Big Game tomorrow
will be all that the words imply. The
two best teams on this Coast will be
battling and right now it looks to me
like a toss-up.
The game will be played in one of
the finest stadiums in the world; the
rooting and the stunts will surpass
anything of the kind in the country,
for nowhere do the rooters put on the
stunts that they show at the Cali-1
fornia-Stanford game. I have seen j
Yale and Harvard play and Chicago |
and Michigan and a lot of the other
big teams, but nowhere have I heard
auch organized rooting as at the Cali
fornia-Stanford game and no place
have I se-en such stunts.
The splendid stadium at Stanford
was dedicated by a California victory.
Stanford scored the first touchdown
in that stadium, however.
Will history repeat next Saturday
by Stanford dedicating the new Cali
fornia stadium with a Stanford vic
tory?
Be sure of one thing, if Stanford
gets a touchdown next Saturday as
early as Stanford made that touch
down to dedicate the Stanford sta
dium, the Cardinals will be hard to
stop. The California team this year
is not the all-star aggregation that
played the first game in the Stanford
stadium, and an upset such as Cali
fornia got that day, might play havoc
with the California team of this year.
All California is proud of two such
teams as California and Stanford have
this year and a big portion of Cali
fornia's population will be at the new
stadium to see the gladiators do their
stuff.
May the best team win; may the
best of spirit prevail before, during,
and after the game.

"Up here in Berkeley we think
the California Varsity is a
pretty fair team. At tlie beginning
or the season we all had our doubt
about Stanford's, but the Cardinals
have shown beyond doubt that they
will give or any team a hard
battle. Ihe result is plainly a toss
up with the ever present breaks
much for the team that gets them.
"Our boys are ready to give their
best which may or may not be suf
ficient."'

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22—About
all the sport writers could say about
the Stanford team the week before
the Big Game for the last four years
was that "Stanford Will Fight." The
result was a foregone conclusion.
This year it is different. This year
Stanford has a real football team,
and the man who can guess the score
is a better man than I am Gordon Gin.
I know that Andy Smith, head coach
at California, will be content to win.
The score does not interest him.
It has been a long, hard pull at
Stanford to get a place in the sun,
but Stanford has arrived now, thanks
to Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill,
"Dink" Templeton, and the wonderful
spirit for which Stanford has always
been famous. The Big Game tomorrow
will be all that the words imply. The
two best teams on this Coast will be
battling and right now it looks to me
like a toss-up.
The game will be played in one of
the finest stadiums in the world; the
rooting and the stunts will surpass
anything of the kind in the country,
for nowhere do the rooters put on the
stunts that they show at the Cali-1
fornia-Stanford game. I have seen j
Yale and Harvard play and Chicago |
and Michigan and a lot of the other
big teams, but nowhere have I heard
auch organized rooting as at the Cali
fornia-Stanford game and no place
have I se-en such stunts.
The splendid stadium at Stanford
was dedicated by a California victory.
Stanford scored the first touchdown
in that stadium, however.
Will history repeat next Saturday
by Stanford dedicating the new Cali
fornia stadium with a Stanford vic
tory?
Be sure of one thing, if Stanford
gets a touchdown next Saturday as
early as Stanford made that touch
down to dedicate the Stanford sta
dium, the Cardinals will be hard to
stop. The California team this year
is not the all-star aggregation that
played the first game in the Stanford
stadium, and an upset such as Cali
fornia got that day, might play havoc
with the California team of this year.
All California is proud of two such
teams as California and Stanford have
this year and a big portion of Cali
fornia's population will be at the new
stadium to see the gladiators do their
stuff.
May the best team win; may the
best of spirit prevail before, during,
and after the game.

"Up here in Berkeley we think
the California Varsity is a
pretty fair team. At tlie beginning
or the season we all had our doubt
about Stanford's, but the Cardinals
have shown beyond doubt that they
will give or any team a hard
battle. Ihe result is plainly a toss
up with the ever present breaks
much for the team that gets them.
"Our boys are ready to give their
best which may or may not be suf
ficient."'
