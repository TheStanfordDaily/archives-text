# Somebody Forgot Football At First Card-Bruin Grid Contest
## 
### 
"At 4 o'clock of a Saturday after
noon* the 19th of March, 1892, at the
old recreation grounds near the end of
Haight street in San Francisco, the
referee's whistle sounded the opening
of the first intercollegiate football
game between the elevens of California
and Stanford." So begins the old book,
"The Games of California and Stan
ford. Nine years of Intercollegiate
Athletic Contests, 1892 to 1900,'" long
forgotten and but recently rescued from
the dust of a Stanford basement.
"The eleven of the new Stanford
were loath to test the prowess of the
men of California, where the gridiron
game had flourished for almost a de
cade. But emboldened by an unex
pectedly close contest with the crack
Olympic team they were determined to
get the ball of intercollegiate games
a-rolling at once.
"So without the training of a pre
liminary season, without the tutelage
of a regular Eastern coach, with lit
tle cleverness, but much brawn and
strength and grit and will, the rival
teams faced each other, and glowered.
Some One Forgot the Ball
"They set twenty-two strong young
physiques ready for instant action,
only to relax them when it was dis
covered that no one had provided the
very essential article in a football
game—a pigskin ball; but it came in
due time and the rush was on. And
the victory was Stanford's.
"The western slope felt its first
touch of intercollegiate enthusiasm,
the western college world its first keen
thrill of rivalry. Over 8000 people
wore the cardinal and blue and gold
that memorable day of the inaugural
struggle."
During the next nine years Stanford
was to win four, lose two, and tie three
games with California.
By the fall of 1892 the western col

leges had welcomed Eastern coaches.
Walter Camp, the "Father of Foot
ball," offered his services to Stanford
gratis and loin McClung, famous
Vale half-back, had come to Califor
nia. The teams met for the second
time on a December afternoon in
1892. The score was tied, perhaps, to
quote an eastern paper "as a matter
of courtesy to the two famous ex
perts, coaching rival schools under an
i identical system—that of Yale."
In the Thanksgiving game of 1893,
Kennedy, the full-back, famous in the
Stanford song, "YV hen Kennedy
Kicked the Goal," had arrived. Har
relson, recently elected supervisor in
San Francisco, was playing at quarter
back.
Haight Street Park was chosen for
the scene of the struggle. It was a
rainy, windy day. but "masses of
madly excited people" watched the
rival college elevens roll into the
grounds on omnibus coaches, and
shouted through till the final score—
a tie of six for Stanford and Califor
nia.
One of Yale's All-American tackles,
G. O. Gill, an ordained minister, was
secured to coach the California team
for the 1894 game, which proved a
victory for Stanford.
The sixth game played Thanksgiv
ing Day, 1896, marked the first of the
one-sided contests between the two
universities. Stanford was to win two
and California two.
The game of 1899 ends the narra
tive of the early contests between
Stanford and California. There have
been many such struggles since, but
none have been any more thrilling to
write of than these that Jack Sheehan,
'95, and Louis Honig, '95, tell about,
till we come to the contest of 1924.
That should be the most thrilling of
all.

In the Thanksgiving game of 1893,
Kennedy, the full-back, famous in the
Stanford song, "YV hen Kennedy
Kicked the Goal," had arrived. Har
relson, recently elected supervisor in
San Francisco, was playing at quarter
back.
Haight Street Park was chosen for
the scene of the struggle. It was a
rainy, windy day. but "masses of
madly excited people" watched the
rival college elevens roll into the
grounds on omnibus coaches, and
shouted through till the final score—
a tie of six for Stanford and Califor
nia.
One of Yale's All-American tackles,
G. O. Gill, an ordained minister, was
secured to coach the California team
for the 1894 game, which proved a
victory for Stanford.
The sixth game played Thanksgiv
ing Day, 1896, marked the first of the
one-sided contests between the two
universities. Stanford was to win two
and California two.
The game of 1899 ends the narra
tive of the early contests between
Stanford and California. There have
been many such struggles since, but
none have been any more thrilling to
write of than these that Jack Sheehan,
'95, and Louis Honig, '95, tell about,
till we come to the contest of 1924.
That should be the most thrilling of
all.
"At 4 o'clock of a Saturday after
noon* the 19th of March, 1892, at the
old recreation grounds near the end of
Haight street in San Francisco, the
referee's whistle sounded the opening
of the first intercollegiate football
game between the elevens of California
and Stanford." So begins the old book,
"The Games of California and Stan
ford. Nine years of Intercollegiate
Athletic Contests, 1892 to 1900,'" long
forgotten and but recently rescued from
the dust of a Stanford basement.
"The eleven of the new Stanford
were loath to test the prowess of the
men of California, where the gridiron
game had flourished for almost a de
cade. But emboldened by an unex
pectedly close contest with the crack
Olympic team they were determined to
get the ball of intercollegiate games
a-rolling at once.
"So without the training of a pre
liminary season, without the tutelage
of a regular Eastern coach, with lit

strength and grit and will, the rival
teams faced each other, and glowered.
Some One Forgot the Ball
"They set twenty-two strong young
physiques ready for instant action,
only to relax them when it was dis
covered that no one had provided the
very essential article in a football
game—a pigskin ball; but it came in
due time and the rush was on. And
the victory was Stanford's.
"The western slope felt its first
touch of intercollegiate enthusiasm,
the western college world its first keen
thrill of rivalry. Over 8000 people
wore the cardinal and blue and gold
that memorable day of the inaugural
struggle."
During the next nine years Stanford
was to win four, lose two, and tie three
games with California.
By the fall of 1892 the western col

leges had welcomed Eastern coaches.
Walter Camp, the "Father of Foot
ball," offered his services to Stanford
gratis and loin McClung, famous
Vale half-back, had come to Califor
nia. The teams met for the second

1892. The score was tied, perhaps, to
quote an eastern paper "as a matter
of courtesy to the two famous ex
