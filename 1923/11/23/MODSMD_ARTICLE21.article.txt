"Cavour .said, 'You can do anything
with bayonets except sit on them.' |
That is what France is trying to do
in the Ruhr now," wak Dr. Jordan's
comment in a talk at his home last!
evening.
"Poincare and other Frenchmen like'
him were waiting for Germany's pay
ment of reparations to slacken. When
they did, these gentlemen went into
the Ruhr valley and took possession j

of the coal mines. They felt it was !
easier to take the coal needed to oper- 1
ate the iron mines of Lorraine than to,
buy it. The French people were back
of them," said Dr. Jordan, "because
they believed these men could get
enough money from Germany to pay
the debts of France. Then they could
go into Russia and collect the debt
that Russia owed to France.
