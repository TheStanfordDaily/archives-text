# CARDINALS OUT TO DEDICATE BERKELEY STADIUM WITH WIN
## 
### 
Stanford dedicated her stadium a
little more than two years ago, on
November 19, 1921, bj' scoring the
first touchdown of the game on the
California Wonder team. California
won, 42-7, but the Cards had the honor
of scoring the first touchdown in the
new stadium.
The Redshirts were not supposed
to have a chance, but the breaks came
early in the contest, and they took ad
vantage of them. Stanford shoved
over the first score in less than two
minutes! it happened this way:
Douglas kicked to Toomey. The
Bruin back carried the ball back ten
yards when he was tackled so hard
by "Scotchy" Campbell that he
fumbled, and Stanford recovered, plac
ing the ball on California's two-yard
line. Three thrusts at the Bear line
put the ball a scant foot away from
the chalk line, and Art Wilcox took the
ball for the last try. The lines hit
and fell, but Wilcox saw his chance
and plunged over the heap for the first
score. The try at goal was successful.
Stanford's flash of scoring football
was short lived, for the Berkeley
eleven went into action .-yid by steam
roller tactics proceeded to roll up a
ponderous score. The California men
bigger, more experienced, and the bet
ter team won. It was not Stanford's
fault, they gave all they had, but that
wasn't enough to conquer the Bear.
That was two years ago. Tomor
row California is dedicating a stadium,
and the Cards are the guests, or foes,
or honor. Both teams are well drilled
in football, both have had successful
seasons, both are determined to win.
The game is a toss-up.
Will history repeat itself, only in a
reverse order? Indications lead the
superstitious to believe that it will. The
heretofore invincible Stanford soccer
varsity has tasted defeat at the hands
of the Gold and Blue. The freshmen
and gray footballers, supposed to be
the under dogs, came from behind and
registered victories over the Golden
Bear. To make the chain complete
should not the Stanford varsity win?
The believers in omens say yes.
But, the Gods of Fate do not need
to intervene in behalf of the boys from
the Stanford farm. The varsity this
year is as well, big and powerful as
the California varsity was two years
ago, it uses the same steam roller
tactics, it has the power and drive to
win. With this material foundation,

backed by the hand that controls "the
door to which there was no key" the
Cards should win, but the difference
tomorrow will be that the Bruins will
not score first.

fumbled, and Stanford recovered, plac
ing the ball on California's two-yard
line. Three thrusts at the Bear line
put the ball a scant foot away from
the chalk line, and Art Wilcox took the
ball for the last try. The lines hit
and fell, but Wilcox saw his chance
and plunged over the heap for the first
score. The try at goal was successful.
Stanford's flash of scoring football
was short lived, for the Berkeley
eleven went into action .-yid by steam
roller tactics proceeded to roll up a
ponderous score. The California men
bigger, more experienced, and the bet
ter team won. It was not Stanford's
fault, they gave all they had, but that
wasn't enough to conquer the Bear.
That was two years ago. Tomor
row California is dedicating a stadium,
and the Cards are the guests, or foes,
or honor. Both teams are well drilled
in football, both have had successful
seasons, both are determined to win.
The game is a toss-up.
Will history repeat itself, only in a
reverse order? Indications lead the
superstitious to believe that it will. The
heretofore invincible Stanford soccer
varsity has tasted defeat at the hands
of the Gold and Blue. The freshmen
and gray footballers, supposed to be
the under dogs, came from behind and
registered victories over the Golden
Bear. To make the chain complete
should not the Stanford varsity win?
The believers in omens say yes.
But, the Gods of Fate do not need
to intervene in behalf of the boys from
the Stanford farm. The varsity this
year is as well, big and powerful as
the California varsity was two years
ago, it uses the same steam roller
tactics, it has the power and drive to
win. With this material foundation,

backed by the hand that controls "the
door to which there was no key" the
Cards should win, but the difference
tomorrow will be that the Bruins will
not score first.
Stanford dedicated her stadium a
little more than two years ago, on
November 19, 1921, bj' scoring the
first touchdown of the game on the
California Wonder team. California
won, 42-7, but the Cards had the honor
of scoring the first touchdown in the
new stadium.
The Redshirts were not supposed
to have a chance, but the breaks came
early in the contest, and they took ad
vantage of them. Stanford shoved
over the first score in less than two
minutes! it happened this way:
Douglas kicked to Toomey. The
Bruin back carried the ball back ten
yards when he was tackled so hard
by "Scotchy" Campbell that he
fumbled, and Stanford recovered, plac
ing the ball on California's two-yard
line. Three thrusts at the Bear line
put the ball a scant foot away from
the chalk line, and Art Wilcox took the
ball for the last try. The lines hit
