# WARNER GRID STYLE OPENS WIDE FIELD OF POSSIBILITIES
## 
### Dud De Groot 
The Warner system first came to
the attention of the Stanford Board of
Athletic control after efforts had been
made by that body under the leader
ship of Dr. Tom Williams, a Stanford
graduate and many years ago an Ail-
American center, to find a consistent,
as well as progressive, method of foot
ball style.
In the winter of 1921-22 negotiations
were opened in the East to secure the
best coach in the football field who
could be' induced to enter Western
athletics under a five-year contract.
After much angling "Pop" Warner, one
of the fathers of the modern school
of football, was induced to make a
trip West to talk matters over. The
five-year contract was agreed upon the
first two years of which were to con
sist of spring football practice in
charge of "Pop" Warner, and the re
mainder of the season under the su
pervision of his two assistants, Andy
Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill.
Thus far Warner has had charge of
two spring football practices, and next
fall will find him in complete charge
of the gridiron destinies of Stanford.
Both Kerr and Thornhill will remain
at Stanford as assistants. Andy will
be in charge of basketball and 1 horn
hill will act as head line coach.
The Warner system is based on a
thorough knowledge of fundamentals,
how to tackle from any angle, how to
block, clip, interfere, catch a ball, fall
on it, pick it up, and how to follow the
sphere. Perhaps more stress is placed
on interference than in any other sys
tem of play and undoubtedly a lines
man, particularly a guard, must be a
faster, quicker man this is expected
by other methods. This is so because

the guards and tackles are brought out
to form the interference on several
plays.
Anothr peculiarity of the Warner
system is the style of pass from center
to back—always an end-over-end pass,
never a spiral... This is particularly
noticeable in an era of spiral passes.
Still another peculiarity of the sys

tem, quite obvious to any one who has
watched a team coached under Warner
tactics, is the number and type of for
ward passes used, many of which differ
from the average run of forward passes
seen hereabouts.
A great deal of time is spent in the
early part on the pure fundamentals,
i and through the season on keeping in

practice on these basic requirements, j
Setting-up exercises comprises a part of j
the daily grind while at least twice a
' week, and generally oftener, chalk
talks are held after training table.
Many intricate and wholly unnotice
able things such as how backs start,
h<sw linesmen come out of the line,
how the end is clipped, how the tackle

is taken care of, who hits the full-back,
and how to protect a passer, comprise
the finer points.
Everything considered, there is very
little that the average rooter wilt see
in a team using the Warner method
which will differ to an appreciable or
visible extent from the fundamentals
employed by other systems.

Anothr peculiarity of the Warner
system is the style of pass from center
to back—always an end-over-end pass,
never a spiral... This is particularly
noticeable in an era of spiral passes.
Still another peculiarity of the sys

tem, quite obvious to any one who has
watched a team coached under Warner
tactics, is the number and type of for
ward passes used, many of which differ
from the average run of forward passes
seen hereabouts.
A great deal of time is spent in the
early part on the pure fundamentals,
i and through the season on keeping in

practice on these basic requirements, j
Setting-up exercises comprises a part of j
the daily grind while at least twice a
' week, and generally oftener, chalk
talks are held after training table.
Many intricate and wholly unnotice
able things such as how backs start,
h<sw linesmen come out of the line,
how the end is clipped, how the tackle

is taken care of, who hits the full-back,
and how to protect a passer, comprise
the finer points.
Everything considered, there is very
little that the average rooter wilt see
in a team using the Warner method
which will differ to an appreciable or
visible extent from the fundamentals
employed by other systems.
The Warner system first came to
the attention of the Stanford Board of
Athletic control after efforts had been
made by that body under the leader
ship of Dr. Tom Williams, a Stanford
graduate and many years ago an Ail-
American center, to find a consistent,
as well as progressive, method of foot
ball style.
In the winter of 1921-22 negotiations
were opened in the East to secure the
best coach in the football field who
could be' induced to enter Western
athletics under a five-year contract.
After much angling "Pop" Warner, one
of the fathers of the modern school
of football, was induced to make a
trip West to talk matters over. The
five-year contract was agreed upon the
first two years of which were to con
sist of spring football practice in
charge of "Pop" Warner, and the re
mainder of the season under the su
pervision of his two assistants, Andy
Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill.
Thus far Warner has had charge of
two spring football practices, and next
fall will find him in complete charge
of the gridiron destinies of Stanford.
Both Kerr and Thornhill will remain
at Stanford as assistants. Andy will
be in charge of basketball and 1 horn
hill will act as head line coach.
The Warner system is based on a
thorough knowledge of fundamentals,
how to tackle from any angle, how to
block, clip, interfere, catch a ball, fall
on it, pick it up, and how to follow the
sphere. Perhaps more stress is placed
on interference than in any other sys
tem of play and undoubtedly a lines
man, particularly a guard, must be a
faster, quicker man this is expected
by other methods. This is so because

the guards and tackles are brought out
to form the interference on several
plays.
