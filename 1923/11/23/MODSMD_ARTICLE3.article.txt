# President Wilbur Wires Message to Varsity Men
## 
### BY WESTERN UNION 
Have had diffi
culties in keeping
away from railroad
stations leading
West. Want par
ticularly to see
Captain Campbell
and his team do

what they are capable of doing, that
is, win that game. Only hard luck can
defeat us this year. Our men are
t hampions and know it, Besides I was
given a rabbit's foot yesterday by a
white-eyed negro mammy born at the
time of the great comet.
RAY LYMAN WILBUR.
