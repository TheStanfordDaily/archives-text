Because it suits the occasion to be
impartial we wish to go on record as
stating that the dope strongly favors
a Stanford victory in this year's Big
Game. This is anticipating the plans
i of the Stanford coaching staff by a
year—the team was not supposed to
"arrive" until Glenn Warner took com
! plete charge—but Time and football
results do not wait on coaches.

Stanford has it
within its power to
take the first fall
out of the mighty
Bear of Berkeley
and it all depends
on whether the

players realize that fact. If the Red
shirts will chuck the ancient criss
cross, together with their defensive
style of play, and go out to beat their

ancient rivals, I believe it can be
done. This is the year—and as things
size up at California —it is the only
year when Stanford will havo such a
glorious opportunity. Waiting for
Warner to arrive on the Pacific Coast
will not help. Because, Andy Smith
will have developed both a team and


Gil Wheat
a punch in another season. Then a
whole flock of Warners will not be
able to stop him.
A man who knows a lot of football
warned us when Ernie Nevers was
first substituted for Kelly at fullback
that the Santa Rosa player was only
a makeshift. "Don't fall too strongly
for Nevers," he said. "You may find
that he has been overtouted."
Lo, and behold, Nevers is the only
great football prospect Stanford has
had in the last fhree or ( . four years.
Stanford ought never to have lost that
game with U. S. C. And there is no
discredit coming to Nevers because
half a dozen of his punts were blocked.
Nor is there an excuse possible for
a team that curled up as Stanford did
that day.
Bill Blewett and Ernie Nevers, the
two most valuable men in either line
up, were not even considered as regu
lars when the season started. So much
for the judgment of the rival coaches.
They are today the "punch" of both
varsities. I believe Stanford has great
er offensive strength than California.
That is based on the comparative
scores of the two teams. There is no
doubt that it abounds in more reserve
power, and that may be the deciding
factor.
If Stanford decides to wait around
until the Bear pulls his tricks you
will find the Cardinal on the short end
of the score again. If it goes out as
Dempsev did, to trade punches with
the enemy, it stands a good chance
of victory. It may be scored against,
but I think the Cardinal players have
more scoring power than California.
There need be no fear of California
leading its "aces" against Stanford.
The fact is, the Bears haven't many
"aces" to lead.
If we didn't think Stanford could
win, we wouldn't write these lines.
The California team has been a credit
to the whole state. It has fought hard
and brilliantly. It stands to go on to
even greater heights. Its followers,
however, are in a quandary this year.
There is a new football team coming
up from Stanford. Instead of writing
about Stanford spirit this year, you
have got to consider Stanford players.
We'll be over cheering California
and dreading a Stanford victory.
One touchdown may turn the tables.

for the judgment of the rival coaches.
They are today the "punch" of both
varsities. I believe Stanford has great
er offensive strength than California.
That is based on the comparative
scores of the two teams. There is no
doubt that it abounds in more reserve
power, and that may be the deciding
factor.
If Stanford decides to wait around
until the Bear pulls his tricks you
will find the Cardinal on the short end
of the score again. If it goes out as
Dempsev did, to trade punches with
the enemy, it stands a good chance
of victory. It may be scored against,
but I think the Cardinal players have
more scoring power than California.
There need be no fear of California
leading its "aces" against Stanford.
The fact is, the Bears haven't many
"aces" to lead.
If we didn't think Stanford could
win, we wouldn't write these lines.
The California team has been a credit
to the whole state. It has fought hard
and brilliantly. It stands to go on to
even greater heights. Its followers,
however, are in a quandary this year.
There is a new football team coming
up from Stanford. Instead of writing
about Stanford spirit this year, you
have got to consider Stanford players.
We'll be over cheering California
and dreading a Stanford victory.
One touchdown may turn the tables.
of the San Francisco Call
Because it suits the occasion to be
impartial we wish to go on record as
stating that the dope strongly favors
a Stanford victory in this year's Big
Game. This is anticipating the plans
i of the Stanford coaching staff by a
year—the team was not supposed to
"arrive" until Glenn Warner took com
! plete charge—but Time and football
results do not wait on coaches.

Stanford has it
within its power to
take the first fall
out of the mighty
Bear of Berkeley
and it all depends
on whether the

players realize that fact. If the Red
shirts will chuck the ancient criss
cross, together with their defensive
style of play, and go out to beat their

ancient rivals, I believe it can be
done. This is the year—and as things
size up at California —it is the only
year when Stanford will havo such a
glorious opportunity. Waiting for
Warner to arrive on the Pacific Coast
will not help. Because, Andy Smith
will have developed both a team and


Gil Wheat
a punch in another season. Then a
whole flock of Warners will not be
able to stop him.
A man who knows a lot of football
warned us when Ernie Nevers was
first substituted for Kelly at fullback
that the Santa Rosa player was only
a makeshift. "Don't fall too strongly
for Nevers," he said. "You may find
that he has been overtouted."
Lo, and behold, Nevers is the only
great football prospect Stanford has
had in the last fhree or ( . four years.
Stanford ought never to have lost that
game with U. S. C. And there is no
discredit coming to Nevers because
half a dozen of his punts were blocked.
Nor is there an excuse possible for
a team that curled up as Stanford did
that day.
Bill Blewett and Ernie Nevers, the
two most valuable men in either line
up, were not even considered as regu
lars when the season started. So much
for the judgment of the rival coaches.
