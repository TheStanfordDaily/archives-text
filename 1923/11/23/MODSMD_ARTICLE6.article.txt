# THREE DIFFERENT ROUTES TO REACH CALIFORNIA BOWL
## 
### 
Stanfor d rooters
Berkeley-bound tomor
row will have an op-'
tion of several ways to j
reach tlve California
stadium. The Boosters
Special, going over the
Dumbarton bridge di
rect to Berkeley; the

Southern Pacific to the Third street j
station and then across the bay; and J
privat-e automobiles either going
around the bay or across the bay will
transport their share of the football
enthusiasts.
For those wishing to leave Saturday
morning the Boosters Special is un
doubtedly the best and quickest way
to reach the game. The first section
of this train will leave the Southern
Pacific station in Palo Alto at 9:55,
and by traveling over the Dumbarton
Bridge, will reach the Oakland Pier at
12:05. The second section will leave at
10:15 and arrive at 12:30. Transfers
can be made to either the Shattuck
street or the Ellsworth street cars
from this train, or a stop may be made
in Berkeley for lunch.
Return by Either Route
This train will return to Palo Alto
immediately after the game but those'
so desiring may return by way of the
Peninsula route. Return tickets will
be good until Monday. The fare is

$2.00 round trip.
Those desiring to
go by way of San
Francisco should
leave Palo Alto on
not later than the
10:55 train. This
train arrives at the

Third street station at 12:05, giving
ample time to cross the city and catch!
a ferry in time to reach the stadium 1
before the kick-off. If no time is lostj
making connections the game may j
be reached 011 the 11:31 train, but
crowded last-minute conditions may


Nevers


Shipkey
make it impossible to see the kick-off
by traveling on this train.
Leaving the Third street station the
quickest time to the ferry building
ran be made by catching street car
No. 28 on Third street, which goes
direct to the ferries. Normally this
street car will make the distance in
eight minutes but crowded conditions
"will probably add considerably to the
time.
S. P. Ferry Best
The Southern Pacific ferry will
prove the best on which to reach
Berkeley. Arriving at the pier 'take
the Ellsworth street street car.
The Key Route makes the trip in
slightly less time, but to reach the
stadium from this route it is neces
sary to transfer to the Berkeley street j
cars at Alcatraz avenue, which run
out College avenue to within two
blocks of the bowl. This is two blocks
nearer than the Southern Pacific Ells
worth street cars go, but more time
will be lost in reaching Bancroft by
transferring than will be saved in dis
tance. For this reason it is suggested
that all students travel by way of the
Southern Pacific. The 1 o'clock ferry
is the last one that will enable stu
dents to reach the game on time.
Students traveling to San Francisco
by automobile should leave their cars
in the city, rather than attempt to take
them across the bay. The moving of
so many people to the stadium will
cause congestion which can best be
avoided by parking the cars near the
ferry building, and completing the rest
of the journey by ferry and electric
car.
Colored Markers Will Guide

red or green. Those who arrive in
Berkeley by automobile will be guided
to parking places by guide posts
which correspond in color to their 1
tickets. Holders of red tickets must
park south of Bancroft way and be
tween Shattuck and Telegraph ave
nues. Holders of green tickets should
park south of Dwight Way and be
tween Telegraph avenue and College;
avenue. Colored markers will guide j
the ticket holders to their proper'
place in the stadium —if the ticket is j
red follow red markers, and if gre-en;
follow green markers.
Holders of blue and yellow tickets!
wilt park east of College avenue and;
north of the campus, respectively, j
Stanford students wishing to. although!
they hold red tickets, may park their!
machines north of the campus along;
Hearst avenue.

out the letter or number of the
stunt; rooters will look on the
small card nailed to their seats,
and at his whistle, turn the color
cards, which are red on one side
and white on the other, so that the
color marked on the nailed card op
posite the stunt number will be
OUT. For example, the yell leader
will call for No. 3; rooters will look
on the cards tacked to their seats,
and turn outwards at the whistle
the color of their stunt cards which
corresponds to the color marked on
the nailed instruction cards. The
instruction cards will have a color
marked in crayon after each stunt
(No. 3 —red), etc.
Fourth —On stunt No. 1 a small
part of the rooting section will
throw their cards in the air. This

else is expected to throw away
their cards. Do not turn around to
watch them, as you will be called
upon to continue the stunt imme
diately afterward and MUST watch
the yell leader. Do not throw cards
in air until told to do so by the

Berkeley-bound tomor
row will have an op-'
tion of several ways to j
reach tlve California
stadium. The Boosters
Special, going over the
Dumbarton bridge di
rect to Berkeley; the

Southern Pacific to the Third street j
station and then across the bay; and J
privat-e automobiles either going
around the bay or across the bay will
transport their share of the football
enthusiasts.
For those wishing to leave Saturday
morning the Boosters Special is un
doubtedly the best and quickest way
to reach the game. The first section
of this train will leave the Southern
Pacific station in Palo Alto at 9:55,
and by traveling over the Dumbarton
Bridge, will reach the Oakland Pier at
12:05. The second section will leave at
10:15 and arrive at 12:30. Transfers
can be made to either the Shattuck
street or the Ellsworth street cars
from this train, or a stop may be made
in Berkeley for lunch.
Return by Either Route
This train will return to Palo Alto
immediately after the game but those'
so desiring may return by way of the
Peninsula route. Return tickets will
be good until Monday. The fare is

$2.00 round trip.
Those desiring to
go by way of San
Francisco should
leave Palo Alto on
not later than the
10:55 train. This
train arrives at the

Third street station at 12:05, giving
ample time to cross the city and catch!
a ferry in time to reach the stadium 1
before the kick-off. If no time is lostj
making connections the game may j
be reached 011 the 11:31 train, but
crowded last-minute conditions may


Nevers


Shipkey
make it impossible to see the kick-off
by traveling on this train.
Leaving the Third street station the
quickest time to the ferry building
ran be made by catching street car
No. 28 on Third street, which goes
direct to the ferries. Normally this
street car will make the distance in
eight minutes but crowded conditions
"will probably add considerably to the
time.
S. P. Ferry Best
The Southern Pacific ferry will
prove the best on which to reach
Berkeley. Arriving at the pier 'take
the Ellsworth street street car.
The Key Route makes the trip in
slightly less time, but to reach the
stadium from this route it is neces
sary to transfer to the Berkeley street j
cars at Alcatraz avenue, which run
out College avenue to within two
blocks of the bowl. This is two blocks
nearer than the Southern Pacific Ells
worth street cars go, but more time
will be lost in reaching Bancroft by
transferring than will be saved in dis
tance. For this reason it is suggested
that all students travel by way of the
Southern Pacific. The 1 o'clock ferry
is the last one that will enable stu
dents to reach the game on time.
Students traveling to San Francisco
by automobile should leave their cars
in the city, rather than attempt to take
them across the bay. The moving of
so many people to the stadium will
cause congestion which can best be
avoided by parking the cars near the
ferry building, and completing the rest
of the journey by ferry and electric
car.
Colored Markers Will Guide
All Stanford tickets colored either
red or green. Those who arrive in
Berkeley by automobile will be guided
to parking places by guide posts
which correspond in color to their 1
tickets. Holders of red tickets must
park south of Bancroft way and be
tween Shattuck and Telegraph ave
nues. Holders of green tickets should
park south of Dwight Way and be
tween Telegraph avenue and College;

the ticket holders to their proper'
place in the stadium —if the ticket is j
red follow red markers, and if gre-en;

Berkeley-bound tomor
row will have an op-'
tion of several ways to j
reach tlve California
stadium. The Boosters
Special, going over the
Dumbarton bridge di
rect to Berkeley; the

Southern Pacific to the Third street j
station and then across the bay; and J
privat-e automobiles either going
around the bay or across the bay will
transport their share of the football
enthusiasts.
For those wishing to leave Saturday
morning the Boosters Special is un
doubtedly the best and quickest way
to reach the game. The first section
of this train will leave the Southern
Pacific station in Palo Alto at 9:55,
and by traveling over the Dumbarton
Bridge, will reach the Oakland Pier at
12:05. The second section will leave at
10:15 and arrive at 12:30. Transfers
can be made to either the Shattuck
street or the Ellsworth street cars
from this train, or a stop may be made
in Berkeley for lunch.
Return by Either Route
This train will return to Palo Alto
immediately after the game but those'
so desiring may return by way of the
Peninsula route. Return tickets will
be good until Monday. The fare is

$2.00 round trip.
Those desiring to
go by way of San
Francisco should
leave Palo Alto on
not later than the
10:55 train. This
train arrives at the

Third street station at 12:05, giving
ample time to cross the city and catch!
a ferry in time to reach the stadium 1
before the kick-off. If no time is lostj
making connections the game may j
be reached 011 the 11:31 train, but
crowded last-minute conditions may


Nevers


Shipkey
make it impossible to see the kick-off
by traveling on this train.
Leaving the Third street station the
quickest time to the ferry building
ran be made by catching street car
No. 28 on Third street, which goes
direct to the ferries. Normally this
street car will make the distance in
eight minutes but crowded conditions
"will probably add considerably to the
time.
S. P. Ferry Best
The Southern Pacific ferry will
prove the best on which to reach
Berkeley. Arriving at the pier 'take
the Ellsworth street street car.
The Key Route makes the trip in
slightly less time, but to reach the
stadium from this route it is neces
sary to transfer to the Berkeley street j
cars at Alcatraz avenue, which run
out College avenue to within two
blocks of the bowl. This is two blocks
nearer than the Southern Pacific Ells
worth street cars go, but more time
will be lost in reaching Bancroft by
transferring than will be saved in dis
tance. For this reason it is suggested
that all students travel by way of the
Southern Pacific. The 1 o'clock ferry
is the last one that will enable stu
dents to reach the game on time.
Students traveling to San Francisco
by automobile should leave their cars
in the city, rather than attempt to take
them across the bay. The moving of
so many people to the stadium will
cause congestion which can best be
avoided by parking the cars near the
ferry building, and completing the rest
of the journey by ferry and electric
car.
