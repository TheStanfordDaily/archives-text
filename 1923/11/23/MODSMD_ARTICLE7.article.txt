Thirty-one years ago, a record-break
ing crowd of 7000 spectators gathered
at the old Haight street football field
in San Francisco to watch California
and Stanford battle to a 10-10 tie.

Tomorrow after
noon when the
whistle of the re
feree sends two
•evenly f matched
teams into action,
some 76,000 people
will have gathered

to watch the Cardinal and the Golden
Bear battle in a. magnificent new
stadium —California's Memorial to her
fallen World War heroes.
It was just eighteen years ago
today that Stanford won her last Big
Game of American football. For after
the field of action had been cleared
the scoreboard read Stanford 12, Cali
fornia 5. In stepped tha grim sceptre
of Rugby and it held the Pacific Coast
dormant in football circles until 1915.
Stanford, sticking grimly to the Eng
lish game for two years, finally weak
ened and the Big Game went on its
usual course.
Tomorrow's game will not only be
unusual from the standpoint of at
tendance but it will mark the first
time in four years that the two teams
go into action evenly matched. Rela
tive scores have meant little this year.
Upset has followed upset. But in the
long trend of things California and
Stanford have shown that they are
superior to any other two teams on
the Pacific Coast.
California's defeat of Washington
9-0 and Stanford's defeat of Idaho 17-7
removed the only obstacles in the
path. It has been a strange thing this
year. Stanford has been rooting for
California in all of its games and Cali
fornia has been responding in like
terms.
Tomorrow it will be different. The
rivalry that has been storing itself all
season for this one game will be un
leashed and the teams and the rooters
will go after each other in all of their
old-time fury,
Wednesday night Stanford burned
in effigy the corpse of California. To
night the warriors of the Golden Bear
will gather around the tackling dum
my and sing for the last time this
year the hymns dear to the hearts of
all Californians and as a fitting climax
burn the old tackling dummy, symbol
of the season's activity.
There will be no alibis after tomor
row's game. Both teams are in the
prime of their condition. Injuries are
at a minimum. Both teams have been
worked up into the best possible shape
for this game.
Comparative scores would seem to
indicate that California is stronger on
defense than is Stanford but, on the
other hand, indicate that Stanford is
the stronger on offense. On the other
hand, critics who have seen both
teams in action, say otherwise So
there you are. At best, preliminary
"dope" on a Big Game never runs true
to form.
The statements of the coaches, as
always, express confidence. Their at
titudes are reflected in the work of the
team.
The California Alumni are rallying
