# CARDS HAVE CHANGE TO WIN
## Teams At Full Strength BRUINS GIVEN DECIDED EDGE, BUT REDSHIRTS ARE NOT OUTCLASSED CAMPBELL, NICHOLS TO MATCH SKILL AT RUNNING BACK KICKS Bears Strong On Defensive; Cardinal Offense Has Shown Up Better 
### WILLIAM WRIGHT 
TomorroAv morning a score of men will leave the
profound silence of the foothills to enter an atmos
phere of nerve-racking tension and exhausting en
thusiasm. Upon these men Stanford pins her hopes.
Shortly afterward the first of 70,000 rooters will
enter California's million-dollar stadium, glance at
the non-committal face of the scoreboard, and sit him
self down to wait for the first really worth-while
Big Game in the memory of the present college
generation.
And at five o'clock that scoreboard will tell whether

or not "Little Andy" Kerr, "Scotch" Campbell, and fifty men in the ranks

have achieved the almost-impossible.
Stanford will enter this Big Game of 1923 with the
odds in favor of the Bruin. California's name is im
pressive, California's team must be given the same
classification. The Cardinal eleven must perform a
double duty—battling a team stronger than itself on
paper, in results, and in consciousness of power, and
battling something that practically amounts to tradi
tion. Call it a jinx. 'And the men are in a big hurry
to get at it.
Both elevens will be at full strength. Captain Don
Nichols, who was troubled with illness and minor

injuries during the early season, demonstrated during the Washington game

that he was quite his old self, or a little better. The only
set-back of the Cardinal is the absence of Paul Murray,
who was forced to take out leave just after the U. S. C.
contest. Wallace Denny will have Nevers' ribs in fighting
trim very shortly, and "Peabody" Cleaveland reports no
more trouble with his charley-horse. Lawson's knee will
be in shape, and Cravens, Shipkey, and the few other
men with slight hurts, will be able to perform at top
speed.
"Don't let Nichols get a chance" seems to be the first
letter in the Cardinal alphabet for the game. The Bruin

skipper practically won the Washington contest with his passing and return-

ing of punts, and seems to parallel Campbell closely in
these lines of activity. With Ludeke, Lawson, Thomas,
Shipkey, and Faville covering punts just a little better
than they have during the season —as they win doubtless
do —Nichols should find himself seriously hampered. And
the Vandal game was the best kind of practice at knock
ing down forward passes.
The duel between these two captains should be a
worthy affair. They will meet on common ground, so far
as their immediate specialties are concerned, and the
aggressiveness of the ends matched against the protec-

tion of the halfbacks in allowing them to get started on their punt-returns
