# CARDS HAVE CHANGE TO WIN
## Teams At Full Strength BRUINS GIVEN DECIDED EDGE, BUT REDSHIRTS ARE NOT OUTCLASSED CAMPBELL, NICHOLS TO MATCH SKILL AT RUNNING BACK KICKS Bears Strong On Defensive; Cardinal Offense Has Shown Up Better 
### WILLIAM WRIGHT 
TomorroAv morning a score of men will leave the
profound silence of the foothills to enter an atmos
phere of nerve-racking tension and exhausting en
thusiasm. Upon these men Stanford pins her hopes.
Shortly afterward the first of 70,000 rooters will
enter California's million-dollar stadium, glance at
the non-committal face of the scoreboard, and sit him
self down to wait for the first really worth-while
Big Game in the memory of the present college
generation.
And at five o'clock that scoreboard will tell whether

or not "Little Andy" Kerr, "Scotch" Campbell, and fifty men in the ranks

have achieved the almost-impossible.
Stanford will enter this Big Game of 1923 with the
odds in favor of the Bruin. California's name is im
pressive, California's team must be given the same
classification. The Cardinal eleven must perform a
double duty—battling a team stronger than itself on
paper, in results, and in consciousness of power, and
battling something that practically amounts to tradi
tion. Call it a jinx. 'And the men are in a big hurry
to get at it.
Both elevens will be at full strength. Captain Don
Nichols, who was troubled with illness and minor

injuries during the early season, demonstrated during the Washington game

that he was quite his old self, or a little better. The only
set-back of the Cardinal is the absence of Paul Murray,
who was forced to take out leave just after the U. S. C.
contest. Wallace Denny will have Nevers' ribs in fighting
trim very shortly, and "Peabody" Cleaveland reports no
more trouble with his charley-horse. Lawson's knee will
be in shape, and Cravens, Shipkey, and the few other
men with slight hurts, will be able to perform at top
speed.
"Don't let Nichols get a chance" seems to be the first
letter in the Cardinal alphabet for the game. The Bruin

skipper practically won the Washington contest with his passing and return-

ing of punts, and seems to parallel Campbell closely in
these lines of activity. With Ludeke, Lawson, Thomas,
Shipkey, and Faville covering punts just a little better
than they have during the season —as they win doubtless
do —Nichols should find himself seriously hampered. And
the Vandal game was the best kind of practice at knock
ing down forward passes.
The duel between these two captains should be a
worthy affair. They will meet on common ground, so far
as their immediate specialties are concerned, and the
aggressiveness of the ends matched against the protec-

tion of the halfbacks in allowing them to get started on their punt-returns

should balance about even-up between the two teams.
During the Idaho game Campbell rarely had time to get
away before the Vandal ends were upon him, but Idaho
sported a rarely fast set of wing-men.
Nevers and Witter will stage another pretty bout in the
punting department. The Stanford sophomore has an
unusually bulky average in booting, and unless he suffers
from buck fever inspired by his first Big Game he should
be able to keep the Bruin at a safe distance from the
Stanford goal. Several times during the season he has
gained 20 yards or so by uncorking a 75-yard punt that
caught the safety man too close, and such a break goes

a long way in any close game.
Cuddeback, as the best field-goal man Kerr has in the
shop, will see service tomorow. It would be no sur
prise to see "Cuddy" and "Bill" Blewett engaged in
private warfare for a situation as hero of the day, and
a three-point victory for the Alma Mater. Both teams
are pretty sure to come within kicking distance more
than once during the game, and three points will look
good to either rooting section.
With at least three private struggles for supremacy
going on in the backfield, there will be seven of them
constantly waged in the line, of which the spectator

will see little. Both forward walls have shown a decided ability to stiffen

in defense within the 20-yard mark, and also to open
holes on offensive under the same circumstances. What
will happen tomorrow is a question for the writers to
detour and the opposing linemen to settle on the field.
Including the backs with the line. Stanford has shown
better on offense than on defense, and California vice
versa. Offensively the Bruin has shown a one- or two
touchdown superiority over the Cardinal; defensively,
from their common opponents, they have eaten one
score each, on so-called "straight football." Stanford
must also acknowledge Santa Clara's touchdown on a

fumble, and the two scores by the Trojans On blocked punts.

Stronger in advancing the ball, and still stronger at
guarding the all-important goal, California seems to
have a smug margin of safety. Stanford teams never
fail to play better than know how when they
meet California, however, and it is this quality upon
which the Cardinal legions are basing their hopes.
Man for man, the Redshirts seem to slightly edge
the Bruins, but the long reign of Andy Smith's system
has given the Blue and Gold a machine-like smooth
ness and precision that the Kerr-men lack. Jim Law
son, one of Stanford's outstanding ends for all time,

has a definite margin over Hufford, who will probably oppose him. "Chuck"

Johnston and Newmeyer are just about matched, as are
Baker and Horrell at the center position. Horrell's pass
ing may give him a slight edge, though Baker has been
coming up rapidly throughout the season. Faville is
superior to Don Perry, and will compensate for "Stew"
Beam's crowding Shipkey on the other side of the line.
Thomas and Mell are a toss-up.
Captain Campbell excels "Hoggy" Evans at quarter,
and will fight it out with Don Nichols as an open-field
runner. Nichols stands out over Wheat and Cleaveland,
and Nevers stands about even with Witter at punting,

surpassing him at bucking the line. Blewett and Cuddeback, substitute right
halfbacks, will decide the question of drop-kicks versus goals from placement
on the field tomorrow.
Stanford's chance is straight football, and possibly forward passes. Cali
fornia is tricky. And "Don't let Nichols get a chance."
