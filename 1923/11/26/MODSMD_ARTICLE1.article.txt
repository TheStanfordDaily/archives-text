# PAN-HELLENIC EXPLANS RULES ON NEW WOMEN
## "When in Doubt, Be Natural" Says Sorority Council Of Regulations 
### 
To clear up misunderstandings which
have arisen as to the exact meaning
of certain clauses in the present sor
ority bidding contract, Pan-Hellenic
has drafted an official interpretation of
the sections most misunderstood. This
statement represents the attitude of
the intersorority organization toward
the relations of sororiy members antd
new women.
A. There may be intercourse be
tween sorority and new women, as
limited below, in any activity of the
student body ,of the faculty, or of the
university as a whole;
1. No sorority may entertain the new
women on or off the campus or
may accept the invitation of an alum
ni or friend to do it for them.
2. No sorority women may visit the
new women in their rooms in Roble.
3. No new women may visit in the
sorority houses.
4. No invitations to college func
tions may be extended between the
sorority and the new women. But,
a. Pan-Hellenic rules do not affect
sorority and new women while
attending church on the campus
or in Palo Alto.
b. Phoning and writing are per
missaile between sorority and new
women provided they concern
committee work. Sponsors may
phone sponsorettes concerning
student activities.
B. It is resolved that the Alumnae
Council of Pan-Hellenic be thanked for
its cooperative attitude and informed
that Pan-Hellenic now feels that the
Council restrictions on the sorority
alumnae may be removed. Pan-
Hellenic, however, begs the Council to
rlo all in its power to inform the soror
ity alumnae that the sororities do not
wish any rushing done for them.
C. Pan-Hellenic wishes it clearly
understood that it claims no jurisdic
tion over any one who is not a mem
ber, active or alumna, of Pan-Hellenic.
Pan-Hellenic wishes to make it clear
that it has no intention of interfering
with such natural intercourse between
row and new women as will inevitably
come about in the course of ordinary
campus existence. It especially wishes
to emphasize the fact that sponsors,
in caring for sponsettes and keeping
them posted as to campus activities,
are performing a university function,
and are thus not affected by these reg
ulations.
The contract makes no attempt to
regulate all the situations in which sor
ority and new women may find them
selves together. If a sorority and a
new women are thrown together in a
manner not provided for in the con
tract, Pan-Hellenic urges them to do
the natural and logical thing, and to
report the matter to the president of
Pan-Hellenic.
