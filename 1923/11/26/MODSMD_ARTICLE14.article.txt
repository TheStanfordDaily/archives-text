# BLOCKED PUNT AND SAFETY GIVE BRUINS 9-0 VICTORY OVER CARDS
## BEARS FOLLOW BALL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF COSTLY BREAKS Nevers Leads Sensational Offensive At Close Of Second Quarter 
### William Wright 
California has been drilled to play the "breaks" ever since Andy Smith
took charge, and has until now been strong enough to win, with or without.
It w?>s this training alone that enabled the Golden Bear to dedicate his new
stadium by a 9 to 0 victory over Stanford last Saturday.
The Bruins followed the ball as closely as the stitches on the cover, and
snapped down on it as often as an opportunity offered—which was by far too
frequently. A punt blocked and recovered by Horrell behind the Stanford
goal line gave California a touchdown late in the second quarter, and a bit
of butter-finger work coupled with California alertness yielded a safety in
the last quarter.
During the rest of the game the Bruins did little but go through the
motions of a high-class football team, with Stanford doing most of the gaining.
The Cards gained more ground from scrimmage, by punts, and in most
<$>departments of the game, but they

threatened on only one occasion. A
fumble, intercepted pass, or stiffening
of the California offense just at the
crucial point, kept the ball in Stan
ford territory most of the time.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's sophomore
fullback, practically ran away with
the game from a ground-gaining
standpoint. Nevers carried the ball
17 times, gained 86 of the Stanford
total of 118 yards from scrimmage,
and was only once held for no gain
by the California line. His 20 yard
dash through tackle put the ball with
in striking distance of the California
goal, and only lack of time, which
forced the use of forward passes, pre
vented a seemingly certain touchdown.
In addition to this Nevers played a
steady defensive game, and was ap
parently bothered very little by his
broken rib.
Witter was out-punted by about five
yards to the kick, but Nichols brought
this department to an even break by
his longer returns. The California
wing-men usually arrived right with
the ball, and Captain Campbell was
usually forced to call for a fair catch
or be smothered in his tracks by two
or three tacklers. Don Nichols made
a few good returns, but the Card ends
kept him far below his standard of
the Washington game.
California could not reach the goal
on straight football, but she didn't
need to. Five times the famous Mr.
Blewett essayed a Brickley, and times
equally numerous he failed to loft the
bloated pig between the pillars. One
of these tries was converted into a
safety by three Bears who tackled
Campbell behind the line for a safety,
but Blewett was a fizzle. Several times
he got himself up in battle formation
and "Hoggy" Evans tried trick plays,
which hints that the publicity given
"Bill" as a drop-kicker was merely a
smoke-screen issued by the wily
Smith.
"Scotchy" Campbell had one of the
off-days that come to everybody, and
his head was the only thing that
worked with the usual precision. The
team as a whole played real football,
but. California was on her toes by a
slight but sufficient margin over the
Cardinal.
Stanford received the kick-off, and a
fumble was balanced by an inter
cepted pass to give the teams a fairly
even battle during the first period.
Late in the second quarter California
made 40 yards when Nichols' punt
was fumbled and recovered by a Cali- i
fornia man. An offside penalty put
the Bruins 5 yards nearer to their ob
jective, and three line-bucks added
only six yards. A drop-kick put the
ball on Stanford's five-yard line, and
Nevers dropped back to punt from
behind his own goal.
In the first quarter California had
blocked a punt, but "Scotchy" re
covered. Now California had her op
portunity, and "Babe" Horrell took it.
He blocked the kick squarely, followed
it, and fell on. it for a California vic
tory. Blewett converted.
California kicked off with about four
minutes to play, and the Cards un
leashed an offensive that was irre
sistible, but unfortunately timed.
Campbell returned Beam's kick-off 11
yards, and Stanford went 70 yards
down the field in a march that was
interrupted only when Newmeyer in
tercepted a on California's 7
yard marker. If ever a team looked
good, the Varsity did in those four
minutes.
Wheat, Nevers, and Wheat hit the
line for a first down. Two passes and
a plunge by Nevers yielded another.
Nevers made 7 yards in two bucks,
and then slashed through Harry Ship
key and into the Bruin safety-man for
a 20 yard gain. His 3 yard buck put the
ball on the 7 yard line, a pass was
incomplete, and Cuddeback fumbled.
With five seconds to play, Campbell
called for a forward pass. Newmeyer,
California left tackle, intercepted it
and ran it back to the 40 yard line as
the half ended.
Another Stanford fumble early in
the third quarter put the Cards again
in their own territory, but the Bruins
failed to come close enough to try
another drop-kick. Blewett attempted
two in the final period, however, and
the second brought the additional
points for California. The ball was

partly blocked by a Stanford lineman,
and dropped on the ten-yard line.
Rolling between two Stanford players
it bounced across the goal, where It
was recovered by Campbell. "Scotchy"
brought it back a few yards, but three
California men were upon him and he
was brought down for a safety.
Taking the ball on the 30* yard line
the Redshirts launched an eleventh
hour passing attack, and lost the ball
on downs. Blewett missed another
drop-kick, and the game ended with
the ball in Stanford's possession and
deep in her own territory.

blocked a punt, but "Scotchy" re
covered. Now California had her op
portunity, and "Babe" Horrell took it.
He blocked the kick squarely, followed
it, and fell on. it for a California vic
tory. Blewett converted.
California kicked off with about four
minutes to play, and the Cards un
leashed an offensive that was irre
sistible, but unfortunately timed.
Campbell returned Beam's kick-off 11
yards, and Stanford went 70 yards
down the field in a march that was
interrupted only when Newmeyer in
tercepted a on California's 7
yard marker. If ever a team looked
good, the Varsity did in those four
minutes.
Wheat, Nevers, and Wheat hit the
line for a first down. Two passes and
a plunge by Nevers yielded another.
Nevers made 7 yards in two bucks,
and then slashed through Harry Ship
key and into the Bruin safety-man for
a 20 yard gain. His 3 yard buck put the
ball on the 7 yard line, a pass was
incomplete, and Cuddeback fumbled.
With five seconds to play, Campbell
called for a forward pass. Newmeyer,
California left tackle, intercepted it
and ran it back to the 40 yard line as
the half ended.
Another Stanford fumble early in
the third quarter put the Cards again
in their own territory, but the Bruins
failed to come close enough to try
another drop-kick. Blewett attempted
two in the final period, however, and
the second brought the additional
points for California. The ball was

partly blocked by a Stanford lineman,
and dropped on the ten-yard line.
Rolling between two Stanford players
it bounced across the goal, where It
was recovered by Campbell. "Scotchy"
brought it back a few yards, but three
California men were upon him and he
was brought down for a safety.
Taking the ball on the 30* yard line
the Redshirts launched an eleventh
hour passing attack, and lost the ball
on downs. Blewett missed another
drop-kick, and the game ended with
the ball in Stanford's possession and
deep in her own territory.

California has been drilled to play the "breaks" ever since Andy Smith
took charge, and has until now been strong enough to win, with or without.
It w?>s this training alone that enabled the Golden Bear to dedicate his new
stadium by a 9 to 0 victory over Stanford last Saturday.
The Bruins followed the ball as closely as the stitches on the cover, and
snapped down on it as often as an opportunity offered—which was by far too
frequently. A punt blocked and recovered by Horrell behind the Stanford
goal line gave California a touchdown late in the second quarter, and a bit
of butter-finger work coupled with California alertness yielded a safety in
the last quarter.
During the rest of the game the Bruins did little but go through the
motions of a high-class football team, with Stanford doing most of the gaining.
The Cards gained more ground from scrimmage, by punts, and in most
<$>departments of the game, but they

threatened on only one occasion. A
fumble, intercepted pass, or stiffening
of the California offense just at the
crucial point, kept the ball in Stan
ford territory most of the time.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's sophomore
fullback, practically ran away with
the game from a ground-gaining
standpoint. Nevers carried the ball
17 times, gained 86 of the Stanford
total of 118 yards from scrimmage,
and was only once held for no gain
by the California line. His 20 yard
dash through tackle put the ball with
in striking distance of the California
goal, and only lack of time, which
forced the use of forward passes, pre
vented a seemingly certain touchdown.
In addition to this Nevers played a
steady defensive game, and was ap
parently bothered very little by his
broken rib.
Witter was out-punted by about five
yards to the kick, but Nichols brought
this department to an even break by
his longer returns. The California
wing-men usually arrived right with
the ball, and Captain Campbell was
usually forced to call for a fair catch
or be smothered in his tracks by two
or three tacklers. Don Nichols made
a few good returns, but the Card ends
kept him far below his standard of
the Washington game.
California could not reach the goal
on straight football, but she didn't
need to. Five times the famous Mr.
Blewett essayed a Brickley, and times
equally numerous he failed to loft the
bloated pig between the pillars. One
of these tries was converted into a
safety by three Bears who tackled
Campbell behind the line for a safety,
but Blewett was a fizzle. Several times
he got himself up in battle formation
and "Hoggy" Evans tried trick plays,
which hints that the publicity given
"Bill" as a drop-kicker was merely a
smoke-screen issued by the wily
Smith.
"Scotchy" Campbell had one of the
off-days that come to everybody, and
his head was the only thing that
worked with the usual precision. The
team as a whole played real football,
but. California was on her toes by a
slight but sufficient margin over the
Cardinal.
Stanford received the kick-off, and a
fumble was balanced by an inter
cepted pass to give the teams a fairly
even battle during the first period.
Late in the second quarter California
made 40 yards when Nichols' punt
was fumbled and recovered by a Cali- i
fornia man. An offside penalty put
the Bruins 5 yards nearer to their ob
jective, and three line-bucks added
only six yards. A drop-kick put the
ball on Stanford's five-yard line, and
Nevers dropped back to punt from
behind his own goal.

snapped down on it as often as an opportunity offered—which was by far too
frequently. A punt blocked and recovered by Horrell behind the Stanford
goal line gave California a touchdown late in the second quarter, and a bit
of butter-finger work coupled with California alertness yielded a safety in
the last quarter.
During the rest of the game the Bruins did little but go through the
motions of a high-class football team, with Stanford doing most of the gaining.
The Cards gained more ground from scrimmage, by punts, and in most
<$>departments of the game, but they

threatened on only one occasion. A
fumble, intercepted pass, or stiffening
of the California offense just at the
crucial point, kept the ball in Stan
ford territory most of the time.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's sophomore
fullback, practically ran away with
the game from a ground-gaining
standpoint. Nevers carried the ball
17 times, gained 86 of the Stanford
total of 118 yards from scrimmage,
and was only once held for no gain
by the California line. His 20 yard
dash through tackle put the ball with
in striking distance of the California
goal, and only lack of time, which
forced the use of forward passes, pre
vented a seemingly certain touchdown.
In addition to this Nevers played a
steady defensive game, and was ap
parently bothered very little by his
broken rib.
Witter was out-punted by about five
yards to the kick, but Nichols brought
this department to an even break by
his longer returns. The California
wing-men usually arrived right with
the ball, and Captain Campbell was
usually forced to call for a fair catch
or be smothered in his tracks by two
or three tacklers. Don Nichols made
a few good returns, but the Card ends
kept him far below his standard of
the Washington game.
California could not reach the goal
on straight football, but she didn't
need to. Five times the famous Mr.
Blewett essayed a Brickley, and times
equally numerous he failed to loft the
bloated pig between the pillars. One
of these tries was converted into a
safety by three Bears who tackled
Campbell behind the line for a safety,
but Blewett was a fizzle. Several times
he got himself up in battle formation
and "Hoggy" Evans tried trick plays,
which hints that the publicity given
"Bill" as a drop-kicker was merely a
smoke-screen issued by the wily
Smith.
"Scotchy" Campbell had one of the
off-days that come to everybody, and
his head was the only thing that
worked with the usual precision. The
team as a whole played real football,
but. California was on her toes by a
slight but sufficient margin over the
Cardinal.
Stanford received the kick-off, and a
fumble was balanced by an inter
cepted pass to give the teams a fairly
even battle during the first period.
Late in the second quarter California
made 40 yards when Nichols' punt
was fumbled and recovered by a Cali- i
fornia man. An offside penalty put
the Bruins 5 yards nearer to their ob
jective, and three line-bucks added
only six yards. A drop-kick put the
ball on Stanford's five-yard line, and
Nevers dropped back to punt from
behind his own goal.
In the first quarter California had
blocked a punt, but "Scotchy" re
covered. Now California had her op
portunity, and "Babe" Horrell took it.
He blocked the kick squarely, followed
it, and fell on. it for a California vic
tory. Blewett converted.
California kicked off with about four
minutes to play, and the Cards un
leashed an offensive that was irre
sistible, but unfortunately timed.
Campbell returned Beam's kick-off 11
yards, and Stanford went 70 yards
down the field in a march that was
interrupted only when Newmeyer in
tercepted a on California's 7
yard marker. If ever a team looked
good, the Varsity did in those four
minutes.
Wheat, Nevers, and Wheat hit the
line for a first down. Two passes and
a plunge by Nevers yielded another.
Nevers made 7 yards in two bucks,
and then slashed through Harry Ship
key and into the Bruin safety-man for
a 20 yard gain. His 3 yard buck put the
ball on the 7 yard line, a pass was
incomplete, and Cuddeback fumbled.
With five seconds to play, Campbell
called for a forward pass. Newmeyer,
California left tackle, intercepted it
and ran it back to the 40 yard line as
the half ended.
Another Stanford fumble early in
the third quarter put the Cards again
in their own territory, but the Bruins
failed to come close enough to try
another drop-kick. Blewett attempted
two in the final period, however, and
the second brought the additional
points for California. The ball was

partly blocked by a Stanford lineman,
and dropped on the ten-yard line.
Rolling between two Stanford players
it bounced across the goal, where It
was recovered by Campbell. "Scotchy"
brought it back a few yards, but three
California men were upon him and he
was brought down for a safety.
Taking the ball on the 30* yard line
the Redshirts launched an eleventh
hour passing attack, and lost the ball
on downs. Blewett missed another
drop-kick, and the game ended with
the ball in Stanford's possession and
deep in her own territory.

Campbell returned Beam's kick-off 11
yards, and Stanford went 70 yards
down the field in a march that was
interrupted only when Newmeyer in
tercepted a on California's 7
yard marker. If ever a team looked
good, the Varsity did in those four
minutes.
Wheat, Nevers, and Wheat hit the
line for a first down. Two passes and
a plunge by Nevers yielded another.
Nevers made 7 yards in two bucks,
and then slashed through Harry Ship
key and into the Bruin safety-man for
a 20 yard gain. His 3 yard buck put the
ball on the 7 yard line, a pass was
incomplete, and Cuddeback fumbled.
With five seconds to play, Campbell
called for a forward pass. Newmeyer,
California left tackle, intercepted it
and ran it back to the 40 yard line as
the half ended.
Another Stanford fumble early in
the third quarter put the Cards again
in their own territory, but the Bruins
failed to come close enough to try
another drop-kick. Blewett attempted
two in the final period, however, and
the second brought the additional
points for California. The ball was

partly blocked by a Stanford lineman,
and dropped on the ten-yard line.
Rolling between two Stanford players
it bounced across the goal, where It
was recovered by Campbell. "Scotchy"
brought it back a few yards, but three
California men were upon him and he
was brought down for a safety.
Taking the ball on the 30* yard line
the Redshirts launched an eleventh
hour passing attack, and lost the ball
on downs. Blewett missed another
drop-kick, and the game ended with
the ball in Stanford's possession and
deep in her own territory.

California has been drilled to play the "breaks" ever since Andy Smith
took charge, and has until now been strong enough to win, with or without.
It w?>s this training alone that enabled the Golden Bear to dedicate his new
stadium by a 9 to 0 victory over Stanford last Saturday.
The Bruins followed the ball as closely as the stitches on the cover, and
snapped down on it as often as an opportunity offered—which was by far too
frequently. A punt blocked and recovered by Horrell behind the Stanford
goal line gave California a touchdown late in the second quarter, and a bit
of butter-finger work coupled with California alertness yielded a safety in
the last quarter.
During the rest of the game the Bruins did little but go through the
motions of a high-class football team, with Stanford doing most of the gaining.
The Cards gained more ground from scrimmage, by punts, and in most
<$>departments of the game, but they

threatened on only one occasion. A
fumble, intercepted pass, or stiffening
of the California offense just at the
crucial point, kept the ball in Stan
ford territory most of the time.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's sophomore
fullback, practically ran away with
the game from a ground-gaining
standpoint. Nevers carried the ball
17 times, gained 86 of the Stanford
total of 118 yards from scrimmage,
and was only once held for no gain
by the California line. His 20 yard
dash through tackle put the ball with
in striking distance of the California
goal, and only lack of time, which
forced the use of forward passes, pre
vented a seemingly certain touchdown.
In addition to this Nevers played a
steady defensive game, and was ap
parently bothered very little by his
broken rib.
Witter was out-punted by about five
yards to the kick, but Nichols brought
this department to an even break by
his longer returns. The California
wing-men usually arrived right with
the ball, and Captain Campbell was
usually forced to call for a fair catch
or be smothered in his tracks by two
or three tacklers. Don Nichols made
a few good returns, but the Card ends
kept him far below his standard of
the Washington game.
California could not reach the goal
on straight football, but she didn't
need to. Five times the famous Mr.
Blewett essayed a Brickley, and times
equally numerous he failed to loft the
bloated pig between the pillars. One
of these tries was converted into a
safety by three Bears who tackled
Campbell behind the line for a safety,
but Blewett was a fizzle. Several times
he got himself up in battle formation
and "Hoggy" Evans tried trick plays,
which hints that the publicity given
"Bill" as a drop-kicker was merely a
smoke-screen issued by the wily
Smith.
"Scotchy" Campbell had one of the
off-days that come to everybody, and
his head was the only thing that
worked with the usual precision. The
team as a whole played real football,
but. California was on her toes by a
slight but sufficient margin over the
Cardinal.
Stanford received the kick-off, and a
fumble was balanced by an inter
cepted pass to give the teams a fairly
even battle during the first period.
Late in the second quarter California
made 40 yards when Nichols' punt
was fumbled and recovered by a Cali- i
fornia man. An offside penalty put
the Bruins 5 yards nearer to their ob
jective, and three line-bucks added
only six yards. A drop-kick put the
ball on Stanford's five-yard line, and
Nevers dropped back to punt from
behind his own goal.
In the first quarter California had
blocked a punt, but "Scotchy" re
covered. Now California had her op
portunity, and "Babe" Horrell took it.
He blocked the kick squarely, followed
it, and fell on. it for a California vic
tory. Blewett converted.
California kicked off with about four
minutes to play, and the Cards un
leashed an offensive that was irre
sistible, but unfortunately timed.
Campbell returned Beam's kick-off 11
yards, and Stanford went 70 yards
down the field in a march that was
interrupted only when Newmeyer in
tercepted a on California's 7

Wheat, Nevers, and Wheat hit the

and ran it back to the 40 yard line as
