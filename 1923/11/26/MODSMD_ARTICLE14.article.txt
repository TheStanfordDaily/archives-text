# BLOCKED PUNT AND SAFETY GIVE BRUINS 9-0 VICTORY OVER CARDS
## BEARS FOLLOW BALL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF COSTLY BREAKS Nevers Leads Sensational Offensive At Close Of Second Quarter 
### William Wright 
California has been drilled to play the "breaks" ever since Andy Smith
took charge, and has until now been strong enough to win, with or without.
It w?>s this training alone that enabled the Golden Bear to dedicate his new
stadium by a 9 to 0 victory over Stanford last Saturday.
The Bruins followed the ball as closely as the stitches on the cover, and
snapped down on it as often as an opportunity offered—which was by far too
frequently. A punt blocked and recovered by Horrell behind the Stanford
goal line gave California a touchdown late in the second quarter, and a bit
of butter-finger work coupled with California alertness yielded a safety in
the last quarter.
During the rest of the game the Bruins did little but go through the
motions of a high-class football team, with Stanford doing most of the gaining.
The Cards gained more ground from scrimmage, by punts, and in most
<$>departments of the game, but they

threatened on only one occasion. A
fumble, intercepted pass, or stiffening
of the California offense just at the
crucial point, kept the ball in Stan
ford territory most of the time.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford's sophomore
fullback, practically ran away with
the game from a ground-gaining
standpoint. Nevers carried the ball
17 times, gained 86 of the Stanford
total of 118 yards from scrimmage,
and was only once held for no gain
by the California line. His 20 yard
dash through tackle put the ball with
in striking distance of the California
goal, and only lack of time, which
forced the use of forward passes, pre
vented a seemingly certain touchdown.
In addition to this Nevers played a
steady defensive game, and was ap
parently bothered very little by his
broken rib.
