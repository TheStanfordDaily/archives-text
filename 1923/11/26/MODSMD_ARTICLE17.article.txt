# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY ONE OF FOUR GREAT WORLD COLLECTIONS
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library is receiv
ing recognition abroad as one of the
four great war libraries of the world.
In a recent issue of Revue de Synthese
Historique, devoted entirely to the his
tory of the great war, there is an
article by the French historian Pierre
Renouvin on "La Documentation de
Guerre a L'Etranger." In this the his
torian discusses the three great li
braries outside of France, omitting the
Paris collection, which is the most
complete and the finest, of the four.
Renouvin gives a long and favorable
description of the Hoover library, and
makes special mention of Professorg
E. D. Adams, Frank A. Golder, and R.
H. Lutz. "These missions in the field,"
he says, "give to the Hoover collec
tion a particular originality and
value."
Summarizing the collections in all
countries of the world, the historian
says: "The Hoover war collection, the
Imperial War Museum library at Lon
don, and Weltkriegsbucherei at Stutt
gart (and the Paris collection) are
actually the great collections of the
documentation of the war. Besides
these grand institutions the other na
tions are able to present only limited
acquisitions."
Since this article was written the
collection at Stuttgart has come to
grief, because its funds were invested
in marks. The collection has been re
moved to the University of Jena.
