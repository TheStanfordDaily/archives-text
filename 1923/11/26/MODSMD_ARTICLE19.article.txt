# THE 						FOG LIFTS
## 
### 
Bill Brogan is going about the campus today carrying a dull, deaden
ing load of gloom. The hope on which he had builded, the hope which
he raised perhaps too high, was shattered as the blue haze began to
thicken in the Berkeley bowl last Saturday. He saw a team which he
thought to be better lose a grim fight. His thoughts for weeks had been
centered on that team's winning. Today Bill is going to his classes as
usual, rushing down to his hashing job in Palo Alto as usual, and bark
ing his usual "hello gents," but he is going about wrapped in some of
that blue fog which hung over the Berkeley hills.
Sometime tomorrow the fog will lift. Bill will look around, see the
same old Stanford campus, solid and strong as ever, hear again the
comments —to which he wouldn't listen before—of people who frankly
admired the Stanford varsity for their wonderful fight; he will realize
that for the first time the Cardinal was actually of the same strength
and drive as the Gold and Blue, he will hear from old-timers of that
14 to 10 game four years ago, and he will be told that the 1923 Big
Game was better than the classic fight of 1919.
Then, perhaps, Bill Brogan will realize what a feat the Cardinal has
accomplished in a year under Warner's guidance. He will remember
that Warner himself will take charge in the spring, with that splendid
roster of able substitutes and seven of the present varsity to mould into
a team. The fog will raise, and Bill will see ahead into a future in which
the Cardinal is constantly ascending, while the Gold and Blue, which
reached its peak last year, goes stil further down the other side.
For today, though, Bill is still wrapped in the deadening fog. Keep
out of his way.
