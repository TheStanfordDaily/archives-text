# TRADITION HAMPERS OLD WORLD COLLEGE STATES DR. McCALL
## Oxford, Living the Life of Her Ancients, Has Only Educational Color 
### 
Individuality is more apt to be im
periled by Old World universities
than by our western institutions, in
the opinion of Dr. Oswald W. S. j
McCall, who is delivering a series af
six lectures on the campus, dealing
with the various phases of war.
Dr. McCall has traveled in all parts
of the world. He was born and edu-1
rated in Melbourne, Australia. He has j
been in the United States for the past i
two years,after serving as a chapialn j
during the war.
Oxford Too Intellectual
'Oxford, for example, places its
mark upon those who stud there," i
said Dr. McCall. "At. Oxford, where
intellectual giants of the past ages
have studied and taught, something of
their attitude is caught today, some
thing of their way of thinking. The
testimony of the Oxford tradition is
not, always good.
"In fact, the real contrast between,
the old and the new university lies in j
the matter of tradition. There is no!
tendency here to color the mind apart
from the educational stress."
Dr. McCall referred to an incident
of the Great War which he thought
significnt. A gallery of photographs
of men who had won distinction for
special bravery was printed in a Mel
bourne paper. All of these faces were
mild and intelligent, not at all the
belligerent type. The bully and the
prize fighter were conspicuous by
their absence.
Moral Force Is Courage
"This seemed to show that intel
lectural and moral force supplied
courage in the last Avar, taking the
place of mere physical strength on
occasions. The champion pugilist
availed little before the terrible
machinery of those times. If a man did
not have those qualities of character
which would stay with him even in
the presence of Hell let loose, he had
nothing left to fall back upon."
Dr. McCall considers the universi
ties a testimony to the existance of a
higher strength than mere brawn.
During his college years the student
is preparing himself, by gaining all
the ethical and intellectural reinforce
ment possible, for later achievements
which require daring and tenacity.
Collosal enterprises of today, or of
war times, demand these qualities in
the highest sense if a man is to be a
success.
