# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
. Nov. 23, 1923.
To the Editor of
The Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:
May I impose on your patience with
another viewpoint on the treatment of
freshmen? My suggestion is that we
have been taking ourselves too ser
iously.
It is only natural that the author of
the sponsor system should become
bellicose when the institution he
founded is criticized, and it is not
strange that a one-time campus leader,
become an "old timer" without ever
having left college, should combine a
graduate's knowledge of campus cus
toms with a sophomore's interest in
them. The warmth with which these
gentlemen have conducted the discus
sion is thus easily explained, but is
none the less confusing. Perhaps both
writers have been misled by a one
sided sort of interest in the problem.
Sponsor Value Symbolic
The problem we are discussing,
stated in its most general terms, is
the question of how to help the fresh
man make the most out of their time
here. No one would suggest that the
sponsor system as such, or even the
traditions themselves, are anything
more than a means to this end.
Whether or not the sponsors do much
good, they arc certainly doing no
harm, and the traditions we have are
probably about as good as any others
would be. There is nothing final about
them; their importance is not intrinsic,
but rather symbolic. In nothing docs
a newcomer more quickly reveal his
attitude toward the school than in the
spirit with which he acccpts or rejects
the little practices current among us.
The matter of attitude is important.
Let there be no mistake about this:
it may not make much difTercncc to
a Frosh whether or not he wears a

dink, but whether or not he learns the
value of modesty and adaptability is
of tremendous importance to him. The
office boy who after a week's work can
tell the manager how to run the busi
ness and the freshman who remains
"cocky" both express their youth in
a healthy and normal manner, but both
must learn better before they can get
very far. It is not only at college
that people have to "get on the boat,"
and the punishment for failure outside
of college is often more severe than a
paddling or a cold bath.
Conditions are Different
It is not easy to determine how well
the class of '27, as compared with
previous classes, is learning its lesson.
Mr. Spectator who came here three
years ago thinks that '27 is getting a
bad start; "W. L. "21" who has been
here six years declared in yesterday's
Daily that his view was the exact con
trary; the present writer, who wore his
dink eight years ago, agrees with Mr.
Spectator. "W. L. '21" is under the
disadvantage of having entered with
a war-time class and spent his fresh
man and sophomore years here in a
time when most of our traditions
lapsed. In those days the older men
were away in the army, the students
were drafted into the Students' Army
Training Corps, classes were conducted
under military discipline, women
walked up and down the Law steps,
and student government was sus
pended. The class of '27 could be
far above '21 and '22 in the observance
of tradition and still be well below
standard. But whether or not the
present freshman class is behaving as
well as previous classes, it is pretty
clear that the sponsors are doing them
no harm. The most that can be said
against the sponsors is that they are
not doing as much good as we thought
they would.
Why do we need a "system" for
controlling and disciplining the fresh
men? Let the Men's Council stop

babying them and contributing to their
feeling of importance by throwing a
mantle of extraordinary protection
around them. In the old days the trouble
was that freshmen were punished when
they did not deserve it; now it seems
that they go unpunished when a little cor
rection would do them good. What of
the raw youth who gave three for Cali
fornia on Rough's Day from the library
steps? Does not the poor judgment and
atrocious taste he showed in choosing
such a way of displaying his individuality
indicate that for two months he has been
unduly sheltered from the consequences
of his attitude. If the freshmen are just
allowed to bear the responsibility for
their conduct, they will more quickly get
rid of such spirit.

the question of how to help the fresh
man make the most out of their time
here. No one would suggest that the
sponsor system as such, or even the
traditions themselves, are anything
more than a means to this end.
Whether or not the sponsors do much
good, they arc certainly doing no
harm, and the traditions we have are
probably about as good as any others
would be. There is nothing final about
them; their importance is not intrinsic,
but rather symbolic. In nothing docs
a newcomer more quickly reveal his
attitude toward the school than in the
spirit with which he acccpts or rejects
the little practices current among us.
The matter of attitude is important.
Let there be no mistake about this:
it may not make much difTercncc to
a Frosh whether or not he wears a

dink, but whether or not he learns the
value of modesty and adaptability is
of tremendous importance to him. The
office boy who after a week's work can
tell the manager how to run the busi
ness and the freshman who remains
"cocky" both express their youth in
a healthy and normal manner, but both
must learn better before they can get
very far. It is not only at college
that people have to "get on the boat,"
and the punishment for failure outside
of college is often more severe than a
paddling or a cold bath.
Conditions are Different
It is not easy to determine how well
the class of '27, as compared with
previous classes, is learning its lesson.
Mr. Spectator who came here three
years ago thinks that '27 is getting a
bad start; "W. L. "21" who has been
here six years declared in yesterday's
Daily that his view was the exact con
trary; the present writer, who wore his
dink eight years ago, agrees with Mr.
Spectator. "W. L. '21" is under the
disadvantage of having entered with
a war-time class and spent his fresh
man and sophomore years here in a
time when most of our traditions
lapsed. In those days the older men
were away in the army, the students
were drafted into the Students' Army
Training Corps, classes were conducted
under military discipline, women
walked up and down the Law steps,
and student government was sus
pended. The class of '27 could be
far above '21 and '22 in the observance
of tradition and still be well below
standard. But whether or not the
present freshman class is behaving as
well as previous classes, it is pretty
clear that the sponsors are doing them
no harm. The most that can be said
against the sponsors is that they are
not doing as much good as we thought
they would.
Why do we need a "system" for
controlling and disciplining the fresh
men? Let the Men's Council stop

babying them and contributing to their
feeling of importance by throwing a
mantle of extraordinary protection
around them. In the old days the trouble
was that freshmen were punished when
they did not deserve it; now it seems
that they go unpunished when a little cor
rection would do them good. What of
the raw youth who gave three for Cali
fornia on Rough's Day from the library
steps? Does not the poor judgment and
atrocious taste he showed in choosing
such a way of displaying his individuality
indicate that for two months he has been
unduly sheltered from the consequences
of his attitude. If the freshmen are just
allowed to bear the responsibility for
their conduct, they will more quickly get
rid of such spirit.

Dear Sir:
May I impose on your patience with
another viewpoint on the treatment of
freshmen? My suggestion is that we
have been taking ourselves too ser
iously.
It is only natural that the author of
the sponsor system should become
bellicose when the institution he
founded is criticized, and it is not
strange that a one-time campus leader,
become an "old timer" without ever
having left college, should combine a
graduate's knowledge of campus cus
toms with a sophomore's interest in
them. The warmth with which these
gentlemen have conducted the discus
sion is thus easily explained, but is
none the less confusing. Perhaps both
writers have been misled by a one

office boy who after a week's work can
tell the manager how to run the busi
ness and the freshman who remains
"cocky" both express their youth in
a healthy and normal manner, but both
must learn better before they can get
very far. It is not only at college
that people have to "get on the boat,"
and the punishment for failure outside
of college is often more severe than a
paddling or a cold bath.
Conditions are Different
It is not easy to determine how well
the class of '27, as compared with
previous classes, is learning its lesson.
Mr. Spectator who came here three
years ago thinks that '27 is getting a
bad start; "W. L. "21" who has been
here six years declared in yesterday's
Daily that his view was the exact con
trary; the present writer, who wore his
dink eight years ago, agrees with Mr.
Spectator. "W. L. '21" is under the
disadvantage of having entered with
a war-time class and spent his fresh
man and sophomore years here in a
time when most of our traditions
lapsed. In those days the older men
were away in the army, the students
were drafted into the Students' Army
Training Corps, classes were conducted
under military discipline, women
walked up and down the Law steps,
and student government was sus
pended. The class of '27 could be
far above '21 and '22 in the observance
of tradition and still be well below
standard. But whether or not the
present freshman class is behaving as
well as previous classes, it is pretty
clear that the sponsors are doing them
no harm. The most that can be said
against the sponsors is that they are
not doing as much good as we thought
they would.
Why do we need a "system" for
controlling and disciplining the fresh
men? Let the Men's Council stop

babying them and contributing to their
feeling of importance by throwing a
mantle of extraordinary protection
around them. In the old days the trouble
was that freshmen were punished when
they did not deserve it; now it seems
that they go unpunished when a little cor
rection would do them good. What of
the raw youth who gave three for Cali
fornia on Rough's Day from the library
steps? Does not the poor judgment and
atrocious taste he showed in choosing
such a way of displaying his individuality
indicate that for two months he has been
unduly sheltered from the consequences
of his attitude. If the freshmen are just
allowed to bear the responsibility for
their conduct, they will more quickly get
rid of such spirit.
