GREAT LITERARY CRIMES
The Robin Murder Mystery
"Fluggs," said Ashley-Fluffington to me as I sat in his study waiting for
scoops to come along for my paper, the Daily News-Times-Star, "I can see that
you are thinking at this moment that there are many great enigmas that have
never been fully cleared up."
"Marvelous!" I cried. That always goes over big.
"Ah, my deduction is correct! You are furthermore thinking of the great
Robin Murder Mystery in particular. Now, don't deny it!"
I didn't.
"As it happens, 1 am in full possession of all the facts. If you have a few
moments and care to listen, perhaps 1 can clear up this case which has long
been a puzzle to the stupid police."
I had and did.
"Well, first we have the record of the police blotter. Mr. Cockran J. Robin
was found dead in his home, stricken with a blunt instrument. Percy Sparrow,
man-about-town, gave himself up with the story that he had slain the deceased
with the mediaeval weapon of a bow and arrow. A bow and arrow. Fluggs!
Think of the simplicity of it!"
It did seem extremely simple, for a fact.
''At the coroner's inquest it was discovered that a man named Fly claimed
to have actually witnessed the murder. His words, as I remember, were to
the effect that with his little eye, he saw him die.
® "The testimony of the attending physician who claimed to have caught
the blood in his little bowl, and the sexton named Bull, who tolled the bell,
may be disregarded.
"Sparrow's giving himself up was an entirely quixotic thing to do. In my
opinion, he was doing it to shield a woman, who I have reason to believe, was
the baneful Jenny Wren."
"Jenny Wren!" 1 exclaimed. "Then who did commit this crime?"
"Fluggs," enunciated the master, "it was myself. I did the deed with a
spethogyrinetoscope!"
I walked quietly out. I was afraid that I might forget myself and say that
I suspected as much all the time.
