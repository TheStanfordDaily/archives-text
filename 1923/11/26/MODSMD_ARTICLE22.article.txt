# Under the Sun
## 
### 
C. N. II
In the amber warmth
of an arternoon sun
a fierce hope blazes
cardinal in the heart
of a host that for
the time lives and
thinks as a single
being. Life is there,
and sound out of
all measure. Red
Will drives the
Cardinals, and hot
blood is the whip
lash.
Blue-zvhite moonlight
discovering a vast,
empty bowl. Silence,
and no living thing.
Shadows where colors
flashed few hours
before. On the
bleachers sit the
wraiths of fighting
cardinal hopes. On
the silvered field
a ghostly team
moves noiselessly.
