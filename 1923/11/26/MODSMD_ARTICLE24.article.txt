# BLUE "C" GOES UP IN SMOKE AS CARDINAL LIGHTNING STRIKES
## 
### 
There was a little blue "C" in a great
field of white, tucked nicely into a corner
of the rooting section. Across the white
background there flashed a jagged bolt of
red —and the "C" disappeared in a puff
of blue while a red "S" appeared and
grew steadily larger.
From the California bleachers the old
"Axe" yell boomed. And in the Stanford
section a red padlock and key was formed
against the white background of rooters'
hats and cards. The lock was a model of
that in the San Francisco bank which
guards the old hatchet.
These two stunts set a new standard
for bleacher activities at the Big Game.
The stunts are unknown at other col
leges, and those used this year were
cU verly planned and executed.
The Stanford stunts, the most ambitious
ever attempted here, worked almost per
fectly, acording to those fortunate ones
who were able to see what it was all
about. The spelling of the name was
particularly good both in the formation
of the letters and the speed with which
the spelling was run through.
Another unique touch was the appear
ance of the bagpipers, playing "The
Campbells are Coming." The Stanford
band rated a cheer on the new uniforms,
designed after the British army officers'
uniforms. The massing of the two
bands to play the national anthem was
particularly effective.
