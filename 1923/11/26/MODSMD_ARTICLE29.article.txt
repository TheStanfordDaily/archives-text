# A
						WOMAN SAYS
## SENIOR DISTINCTION FOR WOMEN 
### 
Senior women as well as senior men
should have something to distinguish
them from the rest of the students. One
can tell a senior man anywhere by his
sombrero, but there is no way of telling
to what class in the University a woman
belongs. Numerous senior women on the
campus, especially those who have trans
ferred to Stanford, are daily taken iyr
sophomores and juniors.
Some distinction would help to draw
the senior women nearer together. The
chief fault now is that there is too little
co-operation, and to make the senior year
a success, it is necessary to at least know
who belongs to one's own class. Then,
too, if everyone knew who the senior
women were, the latter would probably
get more respect paid to them by the
younger women.
It has been suggested that a senior
ring or pin be used. It could be of any
design and could carry out any idea. It
also would be something to look forward
to by all underclass women and would
grow to be considered an emblem of
honor and distinction.
