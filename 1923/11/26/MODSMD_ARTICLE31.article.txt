# Hoover Library Receives Norwegian War Documents
## 
### 
Four cases of government war docu
ments, pamphlets and books have been
received from the Norwegian govern
ment by the Hoover War library. This
contribution comes as a result of the
visit to that country last summer by Pro
fessor Frank A. Colder of the Stanford
history department.
