# "Five Hundred" Contribute To Arena Conflict
## 
### 
The feminine element, not having
celebrated the night before, arises early
Saturday morning, packs her over
night case, decides the eternal what
shall-I-wear? question, and, having for
once in her life managed to be ready,
sits down to fret because the train is
late. With every passing moment her
excitement increases, until, when Oak
land comes into sight, she is all pre
pared for action.
The crowds, the street venders, the
noise and rush, as she arrives at Ber
keley, give her the thrill of a child at
a circus. She struggles through,
guided by hugh signs everywhere, un
til she reaches Strawberry Canyon.
There the magnificent dignity of the
stadium fills her with a momentary
feeling of awe, soon dispelled by the
sight of the cellar-like entrance. Then
she must find her place, locate her
friends, and exclaim about the two
hugh score-boards that rise above the
ends of the bowl.
Plenty of Dead-heads
"Roman gladiators," she thinks as
she sees imposing architecture ,and
shudders involuntarily at the thought
of what may happen to her "secret
sorrow" on the field. She looks with
wonder at the vast multitude seated
around the side of the bowl, and then
suddenly, "Good gracious, Agnes!
Look at all those people on the hill
side! There are 'most as many as in
the seats along the other side. I bet
nobody buys tickets next } r ear, wh#i
they can get a free view up there!"
If she is superstitious, there seems
to her a strange significance in the re
fusal of the blue and yellow balloons
to lift the hugh "C," which the Ber
keley rooters bring on the field. The
Scotch bag-pipes thrill her with a
sense of impending conflict, and as she
recognizes the tune they are playing,
she shrieks, "Oh-h-h, 'Scotchv' Camp
bell, of course!" and, with the other
499, goes temporarily insane.
Finally Figures it Out
The picture-making by the rooting
sections she thinks "positively WON
derful!" By using her imagination and
those of everyone around her, she is
at last able to decipher the streak of
blue across a golden background, a
cordial, if illegible, "Welcome." It is
a disappointment not to be able to
see the Stanford side, but careful in
quiry afterward tells her that those
blue cards made a "C," struck with
red lightning, a clever retort to the
picture of the Bear gobbling up the
Cardinal "S."
After the slaughter, she stands in
the chill evening air, watching the
writhing mass of blue-and-gold-capped
humans that form the serpentine, grad
ually coming to a stand-still before the
Stanford side. Surreptitiously wiping
a tear away as she listens to "Palms
of Victory," she joins in the Stanford
hymn with something like religious
fervor. Then once again, she dives
into tliQ crowd, to emerge hours later,
crushed, bruised, and down-cast, but
ready to begin the fray again at the
Fairmont.
Arriving home laden with crumpled
programs, torn picture sections, pen
nant remnants, bedraggled ribbons,
and wilted flowers, she has just enough
breath left to gasp. "Oh my DEAR!
I'm simply dead! I got SO excited!
Wasn't it MARvelous!!!...?..."
