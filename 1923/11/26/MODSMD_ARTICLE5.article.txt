## 
### 
Stanford and Mills hockey teams broke
even in last Saturday's games that were
played on the Mills campus.
The Cardinal seniors defeated the Mills
junior squads 4-1, the Stanford sopho
mores lost to the Mills 1926 eleven 3-2.
By good teamwork and passing the
ball to avoid the enemy's interference, the
cardinal seniors were able to keep the
lead. Mills was forced to plav a defensive
game most of tbe time. Even with most
of the rival team helping the backfield
players, Stanford broke through the de
fense for four goals.
The sophomore game was a closely
contested one. If the Card eleven had
played with as much speed and teamwork
at the first of the game as they did
during the last half, the match would
have ended with a cardinal victory.
