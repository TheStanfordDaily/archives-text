# Few Women Receive "Smoke Ups" This Year
## 
### 
Judging from the mid-quarter reports,
the scholastic standard of the women
this year is high, since only seventeen
women received "smoke ups" in academic
subjects, and only two of these were for
more than one subject. It must be taken
into consideration, however, that not all
departments resort to the "smoke up"
method as a hint to students concerning
the condition of their class averages.
