# SPONSORS TO DISCUSS PAN-HELLENIC RULES
## 
### 
All sponsors of new women will
meet in the Women's Clubhouse at 7!
o'clock tomorrow evening. The meet
ing has been called by Carolan j
Strouse, Head Sponsor, so that spon
sors may discuss any problems which
have come up regarding the relations'
between sponsors and sponsettes.j
Since Pan-Hellenic has declared that
its regulations barring certain forms
of contact between sorority and new
women do not apply to sorority wo
men who are sponsors, those spon
sors will have more freedom of ac
tion in the future.
