Makes her curtsey to smart Co-Eds
JOSETTE is a lover of style and fashion. She shops
only for The White House. She roams in the
Pans shops, attends the big openings, the races, the
premieres. She saunters through England, Italy, Aus

the different. She is an artist, but her sense of the
beautiful never obliterates that of the practical.
She has just sent us the most interesting letter until her recent
purchases. II e mention these smart, fashions as she suggests
them—

Makes her curtsey to smart Co-Eds
JOSETTE is a lover of style and fashion. She shops
only for The White House. She roams in the
Pans shops, attends the big openings, the races, the
premieres. She saunters through England, Italy, Aus
tria, through all Europe, in quest of the fashionable,
the different. She is an artist, but her sense of the
beautiful never obliterates that of the practical.
She has just sent us the most interesting letter until her recent
purchases. II e mention these smart, fashions as she suggests
them—
