"Helen Wills, National Tennis
Champion, who, at the age of 18,
has but recently entered Leland
Stanford University as a freshman,"
is the caption beneath the laughing
picture of Miss Wills in the current
copy of Vanity Fair. Strange! She
hasn't made known her presence on
the campus.
Could Mr. Conde Nast and his
magazine have made a slip? Quite
impossible, you say. Such maga
zines don't do that sort of thing.
Exactly. Nast could not possibly
be mistaken. And why? Because
almost everybody in the East —as
far east as New York —takes for
granted that Leland Stanford Uni
versity is the only university in
California.
