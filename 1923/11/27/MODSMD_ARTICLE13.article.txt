Saturday. His men had a tryout on
the Stanford horses yesterday morn
ing and practice started in the after-!
noon. Captain Charles Bole had the
Stanford men working on the practice
hold south of the Military headquar-;

Oregon Four Strong
The Oregon four has gained con
siderable strength since its game with
Stanford at Corvallis in October when
it was defeated by the Cards, 1(M.
The first three games of the season
played by the Aggies were defeats, j
but in the fourth, the mallet swingers
found themselves and since that time
have taken the top side of the scores.
The Northern four hold the polo cham
pionship of Oregon and make up the
only other college polo team other >
than Stanford on the Pacific Coast.
Thursday's and Saturday's games
should be the beest seen on the local
field this year, according to Captain j
Boyle. Both teams are working in
good form. The Oregon team is famil-J
iarizing itself with the highway field
and with the horses equally distribu
ted between the two groups.
Teams Evenly Matched
Both teams should go into the
Thanksgiving Day battle on equal
footing. Three of the best horses will
not be -used in the two games this
week. One horse was seriously in
jured in a game with the Thirtieth In
fantry at San Francisco when it trip
ped and fell, tearing several ligaments
in the shoulder. The other two horses
are being used by Captain Boyle for
coaching purposes and will be saved
for future games.
