# PIRATES, DAGGERS TO REIGN
## Weird Costumes For "Captain Applejack" Will Arrive On Campus Friday 
### 
Swashbuckling pirates with big
clanking boots and glittering daggers;
dignified ladies In gorgeous evening
dresses; a wicked Russian vampire in
a vivid creation; such are some of the
many varied players and their cos
tumes to be seen in "Captain Apple
jack," the sophomore play, to be of
fered December 7.
All of the picturesque pirate cos
tumes, daggers, knives. Chinese cos
tumes, and wigs have been ordered
from the Normans Costuming com
pany in San Francisco, formerly the
De Recat Costuming company. How
ever, all of the evening gowns used
by the ladies in the play will come
from Livingston's, a leading costume
designer who furnishes all of the wo

men's costumes for San Francisco
theaters. Madame Valeskri will be at
tired in an especially "vampy" eve
ning gown, it is understood.
Costumes Will Arrive Friday
It is expected that most of these
costumes will arrive on the campus
Friday afternoon. At the same time,
the young women will be in the city
' to try on their evening gowns.
The costumes in the first and 'bird
acts of "Captain Applejack" are to be
strictly modern â€”striking evening
gowns for the ladies and evening
clothes for the men. It is during the
second act that the bloody pirates
hold sway and flash back and forth
on the stage with their many weird
costumes, leering looks, and wicked
wayii - id* 1 *
