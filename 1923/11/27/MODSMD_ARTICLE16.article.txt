# SOCCER VARSITY TO OPPOSE ITALIA VIRTUS
## 
### 
The Stanford soccer varsity will
open up again after a two weeks' lay
off when it meets the Italia Virtu 3
team of San Francisco Saturday on
the Stanford soccer field. The fresh
man eleven is scheduled to meet the
De Molay team, but it is doubtful if
this game will take place, since most
of the freshmen will be away from
the campus.
Coach Harry Maloney was unable to
announce the varsity line-up last night.
The majority of the regulars intend
to spend Thanksgiving at their homes,
and as a result Maloney cannot choose
a team until all the players announce
their Thanksgiving programs.
Italians Have Good Team
The Italia Virtus team is a well
working organization, even though it
has not fared too well in previous
games. Maloney has been working the
varsity overtime trying to round the
men into shape to finish the rest of
the season on the winning side.
Football broke into the schedule,
making it necessary to postpone two
league games in order that the men
could see the conference grid battles
with Idaho and California. These two
postponed games will probably be
played sometime during December.
