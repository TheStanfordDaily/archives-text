# ISABEL CAPPS PLAYS FOUR MAJOR SPORTS ON WISCONSIN TEAMS
## 
### 
Isabel Capps, instructor in Roble
gymnasium, was varsity player in four
sports when she attended the Univer
sity of Wisconsin where she graduated
last year. She was also active in wo
men's student body activities and Y.
W. C. A. work. At present she is
president of the Y. W. C. A. National
Students' Association.
"The spirit that Stanford women
show in their athletics is admirable,
I think," says Miss Capps. "Their co
operation and loyalty is probably due
in part to the fact that all women in
terested in athletics know one another
personally. In a larger school, where
the living groups are more scattered,
it is not possible for the first team
to know all of the second teams, for
instance, and the spirit of unity is
lessened.
Hockey Is Recent Sport
"Organized sports for women are
a recent institution in comparison
with men's athletics, especially in this
country. Hockey has been played only
about twenty-five years by American
women. As time goes on women will
make sports part of their ordinary
life, and with experience and training,
they will improve their speed and en
durance until they become more near
ly equals of the men in sports.
"I believe that women can train
themselves up to the point where they
can play as fast a game as men in
nearly all sports."
Miss Capps played on her varsity
basketball and baseball teams. She
was captain of her senior hockey team
and her class teams won the women's
championships for three years con
secutively. She, herself, gained honors
in tenuis and was one of the star
swimmers.
Wins Highest Athletic Award
In her senior year she was given the
highest award that a Wisconsin wo
man can win in sports, a symbolic
medallion which is awarded yearly to
one or two women who are singularly
active in sports and whose spirit has
been particularly helpful to her teams.
She also won a varsity "W" and was
given several minor athletic awards.
Especially interested in Y. W. C. A.
while in the university, Miss Capps
was a cabinet member and director of
the freshman cabinet. Her two-year
term as president of the National
Students' Association will expire next
April.
Advocates Point System
Miss Capps is an advocate of the
point system to govern women's ac
tivities in student body affairs. She
says, "Men like to give all the work
to one man and let him do it alone,
but women prefer to run their activi
ties differently.
"I think that it is more efficient,
fairer, and makes for a better spirit
among women to divide the activities
and have a greater number working
together for the school. This is best
accomplished by a point system which
will restrict the number of activities
that a woman may engaged in at one
time."
Miss Capps, with Miss Burk, at
tended Miss Applebee's hockey camp
in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsyl
vania this summer. Miss Applebee, an
English woman, introduced hockey in
America. She also studied for several
weeks at Miss Drew's Central School
of Corrective Gymnastics in New York
City. Her home is in Brooklyn, N. Y.
