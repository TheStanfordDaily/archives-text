# ISABEL CAPPS PLAYS FOUR MAJOR SPORTS ON WISCONSIN TEAMS
## 
### 
Isabel Capps, instructor in Roble
gymnasium, was varsity player in four
sports when she attended the Univer
sity of Wisconsin where she graduated
last year. She was also active in wo
men's student body activities and Y.

president of the Y. W. C. A. National
Students' Association.
"The spirit that Stanford women
show in their athletics is admirable,

lessened.
Hockey Is Recent Sport
"Organized sports for women are
a recent institution in comparison
with men's athletics, especially in this
country. Hockey has been played only

women. As time goes on women will
make sports part of their ordinary
life, and with experience and training,
they will improve their speed and en

ly equals of the men in sports.
"I believe that women can train
themselves up to the point where they
can play as fast a game as men in
nearly all sports."
Miss Capps played on her varsity
basketball and baseball teams. She
was captain of her senior hockey team
and her class teams won the women's
championships for three years con

in tenuis and was one of the star
swimmers.
