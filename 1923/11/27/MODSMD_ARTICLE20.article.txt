# CARD GOLF PLAYERS PREPARE FOR MEET WITH CALIFORNIANS
## 
### 
The Stanford golf team will meet
California on the links of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club Sat
urday to determine the golf supremacy
between the two institutions. Neither
team will be allowed to play around
the course before the matches come
off, which means that neither will
have the advantage of being on famil
iar ground.
Twosomes will be played in the
forenoon and foursomes in the after
noon, making 36 holes in all. In the
past California has had the best of
things, winning a majority of the
times the two teams have met. Cap
tain Reg Hirschman has a good bunch
of men to pick from this year and
a good team should result.
Hirschman, Ditzler Stars
Besides Hirschman, "Fritz" Ditzler
is one of the mainstays of the team.
Ditzler shoots par golf when called
upon to do it. Two freshmen. Lang and
Byerly, will also be on the team. Both
of these men showed up well in the
fall golf tournament recently held on
the course of the Burlingame Country
Club. Other men who will make a
bid for places on the team are Clark,
Hines, Hinckley, Conduit, and Chase.
California's team has not been an
nounced yet. Captain Haight is re
ported to have a bunch of fellows
with good amateur records, who are
capable of giving the Stanford men
some hard competition. Jacobs, Up
son, Vallain, and Nounan are some of
the Bruin golfers who will probably
see action against the Cardinal play
ers.
