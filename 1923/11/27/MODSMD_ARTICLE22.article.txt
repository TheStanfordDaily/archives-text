# WHO ARE THEY?

### 
The columns of the Daily Palo Alto have in the past week been in
momentary danger of curling up and turning a crisp brown because of
discussion in the "viewpoint" department on the system of freshman
sponsors.
Following the Stanford Spectator's editorial entitled "Bursted Bub
bles," which was the first attack on the new plan, writers for and writers
against the scheme have had their opinions freely expressed in the Daily.
In order to clear up possible misunderstandings and in fairness to
people attacking the system, the Daily is publishing the list of those in
Encina hall who are acting as sponsors to the freshmen, so that those
inveighing against the sponsors may have a complete knowledge of the
men they are attacking.
Fifteen men representing all branches of university activity were chosen
last spring by the president of the University to help the freshmen—who
in the future will live by themselves in one dormitory—to become accus
tomed to the traditions of independent self-reliance upon which Stanford
prides herself.
Th men selected for this task were: A1 Masters, president of the
A. S. S. U.; Herbert Hoover, vice-president of the A. S. S. U.; Howell
Smith, manager of the 1922 football team; "Kewp" Sproull, football
block "S" man; Norman Cleaveland, football block "S" man; Otto
Barby, polo circle "S" man; Orville Tucker, manager of the 1923 track
team; Percy Heckendorf, assistant graduate manager; George Baker,
president of the Men's Council; Fred Loomis, football block "S" man;
Don Liebendorfer, managing editor of the Daily Palo Alto; "Nip"
McHose, captain of the 1924 basketball team; Tom Irwin, editor of the
Daily Palo Alto in 1922; Dud DeGroot, captain of the 1923 football
team; William Leiser, editor of the Daily Palo Alto in 1921.
Upon these fifteen men rests the responsibility of aiding the freshmen,
gathered together from all parts of the country into a single body in
Encina hall, towards a realization and observance of Stanford customs.
It is the opinion of the Daily Palo Alto that, however much indepen
dence the sponsors give to the freshmen, one must assume a great deal
before advancing the proposition that sophomores or those with sopho
more ideas can better inculcate Stanford ideals than those now chosen
for the task.

The man whose social service ideals prompted him to put up the
banner "Beware of Cops" now seen in front of the postoffice might he
induced to place a similar banner over the door of a certain class in
which the professor announced last Friday that there would be an exam
ination on Monday—and the sign would have much more point, for the
Santa Clara officers have proven themselves to be good fellows.

people attacking the system, the Daily is publishing the list of those in
Encina hall who are acting as sponsors to the freshmen, so that those
inveighing against the sponsors may have a complete knowledge of the
men they are attacking.
Fifteen men representing all branches of university activity were chosen
last spring by the president of the University to help the freshmen—who
in the future will live by themselves in one dormitory—to become accus
tomed to the traditions of independent self-reliance upon which Stanford
prides herself.
Th men selected for this task were: A1 Masters, president of the
A. S. S. U.; Herbert Hoover, vice-president of the A. S. S. U.; Howell
Smith, manager of the 1922 football team; "Kewp" Sproull, football
block "S" man; Norman Cleaveland, football block "S" man; Otto
Barby, polo circle "S" man; Orville Tucker, manager of the 1923 track
team; Percy Heckendorf, assistant graduate manager; George Baker,
president of the Men's Council; Fred Loomis, football block "S" man;
Don Liebendorfer, managing editor of the Daily Palo Alto; "Nip"
McHose, captain of the 1924 basketball team; Tom Irwin, editor of the
Daily Palo Alto in 1922; Dud DeGroot, captain of the 1923 football
team; William Leiser, editor of the Daily Palo Alto in 1921.
Upon these fifteen men rests the responsibility of aiding the freshmen,
gathered together from all parts of the country into a single body in
Encina hall, towards a realization and observance of Stanford customs.
It is the opinion of the Daily Palo Alto that, however much indepen
dence the sponsors give to the freshmen, one must assume a great deal
before advancing the proposition that sophomores or those with sopho
more ideas can better inculcate Stanford ideals than those now chosen
for the task.

The man whose social service ideals prompted him to put up the
banner "Beware of Cops" now seen in front of the postoffice might he
induced to place a similar banner over the door of a certain class in
which the professor announced last Friday that there would be an exam
ination on Monday—and the sign would have much more point, for the
Santa Clara officers have proven themselves to be good fellows.
The columns of the Daily Palo Alto have in the past week been in
momentary danger of curling up and turning a crisp brown because of
discussion in the "viewpoint" department on the system of freshman
sponsors.
Following the Stanford Spectator's editorial entitled "Bursted Bub
bles," which was the first attack on the new plan, writers for and writers
against the scheme have had their opinions freely expressed in the Daily.
In order to clear up possible misunderstandings and in fairness to
people attacking the system, the Daily is publishing the list of those in
Encina hall who are acting as sponsors to the freshmen, so that those
inveighing against the sponsors may have a complete knowledge of the
men they are attacking.
