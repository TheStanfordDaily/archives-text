# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir:
The marksmen of this University
are petitioning to have their sport
recognized.
Why should there be any question?
Rifle-shooting is one of the finest
sports known. It iB age-old, having
grown out of the ancient archery con
tests of the olden days. But rifle-Bhoot
ing is essentially a non-spectacular
sport. It must be painstaking, deliber
ate, with no excitement. It must be
carried on AWAY from the crowds —
to avoid endangering lives.
In what other sport could two hun
dred men spend an entire day (as is
the case many times a year within
fifty miles of Stanford)—and have so
little attention of the pres*? It is not
a lack o£ interest in the sport but a
lack of publicity. And this lack of
publicity is due to the non-spectacular
element of the sport.
The Stanford Rifle Club should be
recognized with the other sports. It
should be given the chance it de
serves. It is not a part of the military
curriculum but an entirely student
activity open to all the students.
