# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
! To the Editor of the Daliy Palo Alto,
j Dear Sir:
Gasp again, Mr. Editor, this is
| further comment on sponsors.
"R. C. 8.," one-time editor of The
CARDINAL Magazine, agrees with the
editor of SPECTATOR, and he's two
years older than "W. L." who doesn't
| so agree, so there!
R. C. B. doesn't mean to say that
the '21 class was drafted as freshmen
into the S. A. T. C. etc. with mili
tary rule, for it wasn't. It WAS sub
jected to the old time weekly tub
bing and all that, and was no better
than the present freshmen in observ
ing traditions. And there were plenty
of old timers about at that time who
hadn't yet gone to war.
R. C. B. points out that the last
six years with which the writer is
familiar do not count, as freshmen
before that time were much better.
In other words, this lapse in fresh
men observance has been of six
years duration. And now the spon
sors are blamed because the sixth
year is in its first two months not
much better than the five years
which went before. Perhaps the cau
ses which made for five years' laxity
also contribute to that of the sixth,
and perhaps before the sixth is
over the sponsors can do what no
one did during the foregoing five,-
show a little improvement.
Neither Mr. Binkley nor Mr. Specta
tor cares to consider the present
position in which the freshman is
placed. The whole university is not
as careful as it was in the time of
which R. C. B. talks. Take one exam
ple. If a freshman speaks and gets

no answer, how can he be expected
to be as enthusiastic about saying
hello next time? It isn't the sponsor's
fault that the whole student body has
gone down in this matter. The pres
ent freshman will improve the whole
university in this and other customs,
but they cannot do it over night. And
there must be a little cooperation on
the part of upperclass students.
Freshman Committes Working
Now Henry Mack is not hollering
about freshmen, but sponsors. What
is the holler to sponsors about if not
about freshmen deficiencies ? Surely
the sponsors do not take credit for
the freshmen football victory. But Mr.
Mack, if you noticed, these freshmen
held a mighty good exclusively 1923
rally for their team before the game,
which was never done before. They
took hold better than any former class
in building a bonfire. They have more
men out for athletics. And the spon
sors do not want credit for this

either, they do not care a whoop for
all the commendation ppectator
could give from cover to cover, but
the point is that in many praiseworthy
ways at least the freshmen do feel
their responsibility which R. C. B.
says they should feel. They have com
mittees among themselves working
out ways to secure general enforce
ment of traditions you value so highly,
and before the year is over they will
show more uniformity in these things
than any of the five classes before
them. And even now they are no
worse.
Can't Be Helped
Mr. Mack, you do not want fresh
men to live together in the Hall. They
will live there, with or without spon
sors. If after this year students in gen
eral want sponsors out, I for one am
for removing them. But then, Mr.
Mack, you will go ahead complaining
about freshmen as others before have
done for years, and there will be no
sponsors to blame. What is your
proposition for improvement?
From the fraternity standpoint the
grouping of freshmen together at En
cina is (to some) objectionable, as it
is to many old Hall men. This fact
cannot be included as you have in
cluded it as a part of the objectionable
feature of the sponsor idea, as the
freshmen stay in the hall, even if
without sponsors. Another thing: a
student Saturday thought the system
no good because he could find no spon
sor to get permission to talk to a
freshman. There is no rule in the
world against visiting a freshman, ex
cept that of the inter-fraternity con
ference, and sponsors can hardly ac
cept among other duties that of keep
ing office hours to enforce a rule of
this conference, though they are of
course willing to co-operate in a rea
sonable way. But as- far as sponsors are
concerned, permission to visit is auto
matically granted at any decent hour.
Now lets get a hit straight. Mr. Spec
tator hasn't any group of men dashing
madly to typewriters to protect them
selves against his attacks, or those of
an old Cardinal editorial writer, though
the hitter's two years' added experience
make insignificant the writer's humble
six, which in themselves are admittedly
too d long for any man to remain
parked hereabouts.
Let the Student Body Decide
If Mr. Spectator had confined him
self to attack of sponsors' methods and
manner of doing their work, nothing
from this writer should have been said.
Mr. Spectator did not take trouble to
learn anything about sponsor's work, but
did tear into the freshmen, which makes
it all the harder for freshmen leaders
who are trying to get somewhere.
The sponsor system is no brain child
of the writer's , and he cares little
when it is discontinued. He has no per
sonal interest in it. He did not even in
tend to be a sponsor, and is merely
filling in as such until January. There's
nothing to be wildly excited about. If
at the end of the year the sponsors have
done no good, take them out. But the
writer would like to see students talk
more sanely of freshmen, and take meas
ures calculated to get somewhere rather
than those used. And he quite readily
admits that his own answers to Specta
tor's and his cohorts' attacks have been
as childish as the attacks themselves,
purposely so .as Mr. Spectator undoubt-1
edly prefers them so, as he chose this
very tone to open discussion in his own
dignified magazine.
And Mr. Spectator, if you really have
some real wood on this question, would
you care to present it in open student
body meeting? Sponsors would be will
ing to select a representative to lay down

their purpose, work, and development of
the system to date, and give the student
body a chance to judge. Sponsors are
not responsible to the A. S. S. U., but to
the president of the University, but there
is no reason why the dope on the thing
shoufd not be presented to students as a
whole, if they are really interested, which 1
I doubt. But if they are not, there is no
purpose in this comment or your edi-1
torials. Would you care to present your j
"facts" in such a way, or will you try |
to make the writer ridiculous for sug-1
gesting this?
And Mr. Editor of the D. P. A., i
will you not be pestered with further
comment from this source on the spon
sor system.

Can't Be Helped
Mr. Mack, you do not want fresh
men to live together in the Hall. They
will live there, with or without spon
sors. If after this year students in gen
eral want sponsors out, I for one am
for removing them. But then, Mr.
Mack, you will go ahead complaining
about freshmen as others before have
done for years, and there will be no
sponsors to blame. What is your
proposition for improvement?
From the fraternity standpoint the
grouping of freshmen together at En
cina is (to some) objectionable, as it
is to many old Hall men. This fact
cannot be included as you have in
cluded it as a part of the objectionable
feature of the sponsor idea, as the
freshmen stay in the hall, even if
without sponsors. Another thing: a
student Saturday thought the system
no good because he could find no spon
sor to get permission to talk to a
freshman. There is no rule in the
world against visiting a freshman, ex
cept that of the inter-fraternity con
ference, and sponsors can hardly ac
cept among other duties that of keep
ing office hours to enforce a rule of
this conference, though they are of
course willing to co-operate in a rea
sonable way. But as- far as sponsors are
concerned, permission to visit is auto
matically granted at any decent hour.
Now lets get a hit straight. Mr. Spec
tator hasn't any group of men dashing
madly to typewriters to protect them
selves against his attacks, or those of
an old Cardinal editorial writer, though
the hitter's two years' added experience
make insignificant the writer's humble
six, which in themselves are admittedly
too d long for any man to remain
parked hereabouts.
Let the Student Body Decide
If Mr. Spectator had confined him
self to attack of sponsors' methods and
manner of doing their work, nothing
from this writer should have been said.
Mr. Spectator did not take trouble to
learn anything about sponsor's work, but
did tear into the freshmen, which makes
it all the harder for freshmen leaders
who are trying to get somewhere.
The sponsor system is no brain child
of the writer's , and he cares little
when it is discontinued. He has no per
sonal interest in it. He did not even in
tend to be a sponsor, and is merely
filling in as such until January. There's
nothing to be wildly excited about. If
at the end of the year the sponsors have
done no good, take them out. But the
writer would like to see students talk
more sanely of freshmen, and take meas
ures calculated to get somewhere rather
than those used. And he quite readily
admits that his own answers to Specta
tor's and his cohorts' attacks have been
as childish as the attacks themselves,
purposely so .as Mr. Spectator undoubt-1
edly prefers them so, as he chose this
very tone to open discussion in his own
dignified magazine.
And Mr. Spectator, if you really have
some real wood on this question, would
you care to present it in open student
body meeting? Sponsors would be will
ing to select a representative to lay down

their purpose, work, and development of
the system to date, and give the student
body a chance to judge. Sponsors are
not responsible to the A. S. S. U., but to
the president of the University, but there
is no reason why the dope on the thing
shoufd not be presented to students as a
whole, if they are really interested, which 1
I doubt. But if they are not, there is no
purpose in this comment or your edi-1
torials. Would you care to present your j
"facts" in such a way, or will you try |
to make the writer ridiculous for sug-1
gesting this?
And Mr. Editor of the D. P. A., i
will you not be pestered with further
comment from this source on the spon
sor system.

! To the Editor of the Daliy Palo Alto,
j Dear Sir:
Gasp again, Mr. Editor, this is
| further comment on sponsors.
"R. C. 8.," one-time editor of The
CARDINAL Magazine, agrees with the
editor of SPECTATOR, and he's two
years older than "W. L." who doesn't
| so agree, so there!
R. C. B. doesn't mean to say that
the '21 class was drafted as freshmen
into the S. A. T. C. etc. with mili
tary rule, for it wasn't. It WAS sub
jected to the old time weekly tub
bing and all that, and was no better
than the present freshmen in observ
ing traditions. And there were plenty
of old timers about at that time who
hadn't yet gone to war.
R. C. B. points out that the last
six years with which the writer is
familiar do not count, as freshmen
before that time were much better.
In other words, this lapse in fresh
men observance has been of six
years duration. And now the spon
sors are blamed because the sixth
year is in its first two months not
much better than the five years
which went before. Perhaps the cau
ses which made for five years' laxity
also contribute to that of the sixth,
and perhaps before the sixth is
over the sponsors can do what no
one did during the foregoing five,-
show a little improvement.
Neither Mr. Binkley nor Mr. Specta
tor cares to consider the present
position in which the freshman is
placed. The whole university is not
as careful as it was in the time of
which R. C. B. talks. Take one exam
ple. If a freshman speaks and gets

no answer, how can he be expected
to be as enthusiastic about saying
hello next time? It isn't the sponsor's
fault that the whole student body has
gone down in this matter. The pres
ent freshman will improve the whole
university in this and other customs,
but they cannot do it over night. And
there must be a little cooperation on
the part of upperclass students.
Freshman Committes Working
Now Henry Mack is not hollering
about freshmen, but sponsors. What
is the holler to sponsors about if not
about freshmen deficiencies ? Surely
the sponsors do not take credit for
the freshmen football victory. But Mr.
Mack, if you noticed, these freshmen
held a mighty good exclusively 1923
rally for their team before the game,
which was never done before. They
took hold better than any former class
in building a bonfire. They have more
men out for athletics. And the spon
sors do not want credit for this

either, they do not care a whoop for
all the commendation ppectator
could give from cover to cover, but
the point is that in many praiseworthy
ways at least the freshmen do feel
their responsibility which R. C. B.
says they should feel. They have com
mittees among themselves working
out ways to secure general enforce
ment of traditions you value so highly,
and before the year is over they will
show more uniformity in these things
than any of the five classes before
them. And even now they are no

And Mr. Spectator, if you really have
some real wood on this question, would
you care to present it in open student
body meeting? Sponsors would be will
ing to select a representative to lay down

their purpose, work, and development of
the system to date, and give the student
body a chance to judge. Sponsors are
not responsible to the A. S. S. U., but to
the president of the University, but there
is no reason why the dope on the thing
shoufd not be presented to students as a
whole, if they are really interested, which 1
I doubt. But if they are not, there is no
purpose in this comment or your edi-1

"facts" in such a way, or will you try |
to make the writer ridiculous for sug-1
gesting this?

will you not be pestered with further

! To the Editor of the Daliy Palo Alto,
j Dear Sir:
Gasp again, Mr. Editor, this is
| further comment on sponsors.
"R. C. 8.," one-time editor of The
CARDINAL Magazine, agrees with the
editor of SPECTATOR, and he's two
years older than "W. L." who doesn't
| so agree, so there!
R. C. B. doesn't mean to say that
the '21 class was drafted as freshmen
into the S. A. T. C. etc. with mili
tary rule, for it wasn't. It WAS sub
jected to the old time weekly tub
bing and all that, and was no better
than the present freshmen in observ
ing traditions. And there were plenty
of old timers about at that time who
hadn't yet gone to war.
R. C. B. points out that the last
six years with which the writer is
familiar do not count, as freshmen
before that time were much better.
In other words, this lapse in fresh
men observance has been of six
years duration. And now the spon
sors are blamed because the sixth
year is in its first two months not
much better than the five years
which went before. Perhaps the cau
ses which made for five years' laxity
also contribute to that of the sixth,
and perhaps before the sixth is
over the sponsors can do what no
one did during the foregoing five,-
show a little improvement.
Neither Mr. Binkley nor Mr. Specta
tor cares to consider the present
position in which the freshman is
placed. The whole university is not
as careful as it was in the time of
which R. C. B. talks. Take one exam
ple. If a freshman speaks and gets

no answer, how can he be expected
to be as enthusiastic about saying
hello next time? It isn't the sponsor's
fault that the whole student body has
gone down in this matter. The pres
ent freshman will improve the whole
university in this and other customs,
but they cannot do it over night. And
there must be a little cooperation on
the part of upperclass students.
Freshman Committes Working
Now Henry Mack is not hollering
about freshmen, but sponsors. What
is the holler to sponsors about if not
about freshmen deficiencies ? Surely
the sponsors do not take credit for
the freshmen football victory. But Mr.
Mack, if you noticed, these freshmen
held a mighty good exclusively 1923
rally for their team before the game,
which was never done before. They
took hold better than any former class
in building a bonfire. They have more
men out for athletics. And the spon
sors do not want credit for this

either, they do not care a whoop for
all the commendation ppectator
could give from cover to cover, but
the point is that in many praiseworthy
ways at least the freshmen do feel
their responsibility which R. C. B.
says they should feel. They have com
mittees among themselves working
out ways to secure general enforce
ment of traditions you value so highly,
and before the year is over they will
show more uniformity in these things
than any of the five classes before
them. And even now they are no
worse.
Can't Be Helped
Mr. Mack, you do not want fresh
men to live together in the Hall. They
will live there, with or without spon
sors. If after this year students in gen
eral want sponsors out, I for one am
for removing them. But then, Mr.
Mack, you will go ahead complaining
about freshmen as others before have
done for years, and there will be no
sponsors to blame. What is your
proposition for improvement?
From the fraternity standpoint the
grouping of freshmen together at En
cina is (to some) objectionable, as it
is to many old Hall men. This fact
cannot be included as you have in
cluded it as a part of the objectionable
feature of the sponsor idea, as the
freshmen stay in the hall, even if
without sponsors. Another thing: a
student Saturday thought the system
no good because he could find no spon
sor to get permission to talk to a
freshman. There is no rule in the
world against visiting a freshman, ex
cept that of the inter-fraternity con
ference, and sponsors can hardly ac
cept among other duties that of keep
ing office hours to enforce a rule of
this conference, though they are of
course willing to co-operate in a rea
sonable way. But as- far as sponsors are
concerned, permission to visit is auto
matically granted at any decent hour.
Now lets get a hit straight. Mr. Spec
tator hasn't any group of men dashing
madly to typewriters to protect them
selves against his attacks, or those of
an old Cardinal editorial writer, though
the hitter's two years' added experience
make insignificant the writer's humble
six, which in themselves are admittedly
too d long for any man to remain
parked hereabouts.
Let the Student Body Decide
If Mr. Spectator had confined him
self to attack of sponsors' methods and
manner of doing their work, nothing
from this writer should have been said.
Mr. Spectator did not take trouble to
learn anything about sponsor's work, but
did tear into the freshmen, which makes
it all the harder for freshmen leaders
who are trying to get somewhere.
The sponsor system is no brain child
of the writer's , and he cares little
when it is discontinued. He has no per
sonal interest in it. He did not even in
tend to be a sponsor, and is merely
filling in as such until January. There's
nothing to be wildly excited about. If
at the end of the year the sponsors have
done no good, take them out. But the
writer would like to see students talk
more sanely of freshmen, and take meas
ures calculated to get somewhere rather
than those used. And he quite readily
admits that his own answers to Specta
tor's and his cohorts' attacks have been
as childish as the attacks themselves,
purposely so .as Mr. Spectator undoubt-1
edly prefers them so, as he chose this
very tone to open discussion in his own
dignified magazine.
And Mr. Spectator, if you really have
some real wood on this question, would
you care to present it in open student
body meeting? Sponsors would be will
ing to select a representative to lay down

their purpose, work, and development of

Freshman Committes Working
Now Henry Mack is not hollering
about freshmen, but sponsors. What
is the holler to sponsors about if not
about freshmen deficiencies ? Surely
the sponsors do not take credit for
the freshmen football victory. But Mr.
Mack, if you noticed, these freshmen
held a mighty good exclusively 1923
rally for their team before the game,
which was never done before. They
took hold better than any former class
in building a bonfire. They have more
men out for athletics. And the spon
sors do not want credit for this

either, they do not care a whoop for
all the commendation ppectator
could give from cover to cover, but
the point is that in many praiseworthy
ways at least the freshmen do feel
their responsibility which R. C. B.
says they should feel. They have com
mittees among themselves working
out ways to secure general enforce
ment of traditions you value so highly,
and before the year is over they will
show more uniformity in these things
than any of the five classes before
them. And even now they are no
worse.
Can't Be Helped
Mr. Mack, you do not want fresh
men to live together in the Hall. They
will live there, with or without spon
sors. If after this year students in gen
eral want sponsors out, I for one am
for removing them. But then, Mr.
Mack, you will go ahead complaining
about freshmen as others before have
done for years, and there will be no
sponsors to blame. What is your
proposition for improvement?
From the fraternity standpoint the
grouping of freshmen together at En
cina is (to some) objectionable, as it
is to many old Hall men. This fact
cannot be included as you have in
cluded it as a part of the objectionable
feature of the sponsor idea, as the
freshmen stay in the hall, even if
without sponsors. Another thing: a
student Saturday thought the system
no good because he could find no spon
sor to get permission to talk to a
freshman. There is no rule in the
world against visiting a freshman, ex
cept that of the inter-fraternity con
ference, and sponsors can hardly ac
cept among other duties that of keep
ing office hours to enforce a rule of
this conference, though they are of
course willing to co-operate in a rea
sonable way. But as- far as sponsors are
concerned, permission to visit is auto
matically granted at any decent hour.
Now lets get a hit straight. Mr. Spec
tator hasn't any group of men dashing
madly to typewriters to protect them
selves against his attacks, or those of
an old Cardinal editorial writer, though
the hitter's two years' added experience
make insignificant the writer's humble
six, which in themselves are admittedly
too d long for any man to remain
parked hereabouts.
Let the Student Body Decide
If Mr. Spectator had confined him
self to attack of sponsors' methods and
manner of doing their work, nothing
from this writer should have been said.
Mr. Spectator did not take trouble to
learn anything about sponsor's work, but
did tear into the freshmen, which makes
it all the harder for freshmen leaders
who are trying to get somewhere.
The sponsor system is no brain child
of the writer's , and he cares little
when it is discontinued. He has no per
sonal interest in it. He did not even in
tend to be a sponsor, and is merely
filling in as such until January. There's
nothing to be wildly excited about. If
at the end of the year the sponsors have
done no good, take them out. But the
writer would like to see students talk
more sanely of freshmen, and take meas
ures calculated to get somewhere rather
than those used. And he quite readily
admits that his own answers to Specta
tor's and his cohorts' attacks have been
as childish as the attacks themselves,
purposely so .as Mr. Spectator undoubt-1
edly prefers them so, as he chose this
very tone to open discussion in his own
dignified magazine.
And Mr. Spectator, if you really have
some real wood on this question, would
you care to present it in open student
body meeting? Sponsors would be will
ing to select a representative to lay down

their purpose, work, and development of
the system to date, and give the student
body a chance to judge. Sponsors are
not responsible to the A. S. S. U., but to
the president of the University, but there
is no reason why the dope on the thing
shoufd not be presented to students as a
whole, if they are really interested, which 1
I doubt. But if they are not, there is no
purpose in this comment or your edi-1
torials. Would you care to present your j
"facts" in such a way, or will you try |
to make the writer ridiculous for sug-1
gesting this?
And Mr. Editor of the D. P. A., i
will you not be pestered with further
comment from this source on the spon
sor system.

! To the Editor of the Daliy Palo Alto,
j Dear Sir:
Gasp again, Mr. Editor, this is
| further comment on sponsors.
"R. C. 8.," one-time editor of The
CARDINAL Magazine, agrees with the
editor of SPECTATOR, and he's two
years older than "W. L." who doesn't
| so agree, so there!
R. C. B. doesn't mean to say that
the '21 class was drafted as freshmen
into the S. A. T. C. etc. with mili
tary rule, for it wasn't. It WAS sub
jected to the old time weekly tub
bing and all that, and was no better
than the present freshmen in observ
ing traditions. And there were plenty
of old timers about at that time who
hadn't yet gone to war.
R. C. B. points out that the last
six years with which the writer is
familiar do not count, as freshmen
before that time were much better.
In other words, this lapse in fresh
men observance has been of six
years duration. And now the spon
sors are blamed because the sixth
year is in its first two months not
much better than the five years
which went before. Perhaps the cau
ses which made for five years' laxity
also contribute to that of the sixth,
and perhaps before the sixth is
over the sponsors can do what no
one did during the foregoing five,-
show a little improvement.
Neither Mr. Binkley nor Mr. Specta
tor cares to consider the present
position in which the freshman is
placed. The whole university is not
as careful as it was in the time of
which R. C. B. talks. Take one exam
ple. If a freshman speaks and gets

no answer, how can he be expected
to be as enthusiastic about saying
hello next time? It isn't the sponsor's
fault that the whole student body has
gone down in this matter. The pres
ent freshman will improve the whole
university in this and other customs,
but they cannot do it over night. And
there must be a little cooperation on
the part of upperclass students.
