# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
! To the Editor of the Daliy Palo Alto,
j Dear Sir:
Gasp again, Mr. Editor, this is
| further comment on sponsors.
"R. C. 8.," one-time editor of The
CARDINAL Magazine, agrees with the
editor of SPECTATOR, and he's two
years older than "W. L." who doesn't
| so agree, so there!
R. C. B. doesn't mean to say that
the '21 class was drafted as freshmen
into the S. A. T. C. etc. with mili
tary rule, for it wasn't. It WAS sub
jected to the old time weekly tub
bing and all that, and was no better
than the present freshmen in observ
ing traditions. And there were plenty
of old timers about at that time who
hadn't yet gone to war.
R. C. B. points out that the last
six years with which the writer is
familiar do not count, as freshmen
before that time were much better.
In other words, this lapse in fresh
men observance has been of six
years duration. And now the spon
sors are blamed because the sixth
year is in its first two months not
much better than the five years
which went before. Perhaps the cau
ses which made for five years' laxity
also contribute to that of the sixth,
and perhaps before the sixth is
over the sponsors can do what no
one did during the foregoing five,-
show a little improvement.
Neither Mr. Binkley nor Mr. Specta
tor cares to consider the present
position in which the freshman is
placed. The whole university is not
as careful as it was in the time of
which R. C. B. talks. Take one exam
ple. If a freshman speaks and gets

no answer, how can he be expected
to be as enthusiastic about saying
hello next time? It isn't the sponsor's
fault that the whole student body has
gone down in this matter. The pres
ent freshman will improve the whole
university in this and other customs,
but they cannot do it over night. And
there must be a little cooperation on
the part of upperclass students.
