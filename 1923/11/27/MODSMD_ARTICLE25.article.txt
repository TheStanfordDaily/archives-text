"The Greeks had one wife—this they called monotony."—Exerpt from
sermon. Here's the fraternity viewpoint:
I always have a "dearest hope"
I've never yet upset the dope;
At times a girl—at times a song
Or anything that comes along.
My dearest hope on March the first
Was Mae—I thought my heart would burst,
But when the seventh came around
Marcel was sweeter far, I'd found.
"La Rond des Lutins" claimed my soul
But lost it soon to "Barcarolle."
In two more weeks, by Heaven's truth
1 gazed with love at George (Babe) Ruth.
To fully paint my dearest hopes
I'd need a few kaleidoscopes—
If I combine them in a wife
I'll lead a most eventful life.
