C. N. II
The bank president
stepped upon an
upturned thumb-tack
as he got out of
bed in the morning.
That pleased him
immensely. His
breakfast cup of
coffee was nearly
cold, and the toast
soggy. By this
time he was in a
buoyant mood.
When he reached the
bank a customer
plead for a time
extension on a note.
The president would
have seen desperation
in the man's face,
but he was thinking
of the thumb-tack.
He said nothing doing.
An hour later the
unfortunate debtor
shot himself in the
library. But that
happened about the
middle of the third
reel, as I recall.
