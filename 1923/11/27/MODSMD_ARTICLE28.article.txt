Porto Rico, one of the United States'
playground possessions, is fast becom
ing one of this country's most valuable
colonies from a commercial as well as
a social viewpoint, according to Clar
ence Ferguson, expert on trade condi
tions in the island, who has been visit
ing on the campus for a few days.
'Our island colony has extremely
moderate climate, making it a fine win
ter resort for Americans," he said.
"It's surroundings are picturesque and
historic and no more delightful vaca
tion spot could be found. Among the
many sights is San Juan with its an
ctent forts and buildings where Colum
bus landed in 1492. Her Ponce de
Leon built a palace in which he
dreamed of his fountain of eternal
youth, and here his bones lie today.
The ancient Cathedral, from whose
towers the bells have been ringing
since 1540, is situated in San Juan.
'Casa Blanca, the former home of
Ponce de Leon, is now occupied by the
commanding officer of the military
forces and overlooks the city wall
erected in 1525 and the San Juan Gate,
formerly the only entrance to the
walled city.
"At the western extremity of the
island, guarding the entrance to the
harbor, stands the celebrated Morro
Castle, and at the eastern end of San
Juan is the huge Fort San Cristobal,
with the attractive little fort of San
Geranimo at the channel inlet. At
Aguadilla is a monument in honor of
Columbus, who filled his water casks
at a nearby spring.

"Besides scenic beauty Porto Rico
has much commercial value," said
Fergusan, who has spent ten years in
making the island possession better
known in the United States. "Porto
Rico is credited with having the best
coffee in the world, with only one-half
per cent of caffeine in it compared
kith five per cent in the Barzilian
product which Americans purchase.
The colonial crop goes chiefly to Eu
rope. Total exports from Porto Rico in
1922 amounted to $250,000,000 of
which only a small part came to the
United States. Yet imports to Porto
Rico came largely from the United
States during the same time and
amounted to $150,000,000.
"The islanders speak both English
and Spanish and are an important
link between this country and South
America. The island sends many stu
dents to America and a number of
these come to Stanford. Porto Rico
has a population of 1,300,000 and is
100 miles long and 62 miles wide. In
the twenty-five years Porto Rico has
been a possession of this country, the
administration has been on the whole
quite peaceful. At present, Horace M.
Towner, former chairman of the Com
mittee on Insular Affairs at Washing
ton, D. C., is governor of the island.
"With the co-operation now started
in commercial, social, and educational
activities, the relationships between
the United Slates and its small island
possession should increase and bring
the two peoples into closer sympathy
with each other."
