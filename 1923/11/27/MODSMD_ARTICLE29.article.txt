Jim Lawson, fast Cardinal end, was
one outstanding player last Saturday.
To watch Lawson wait for the inter
ference, ward it off, and tackle the
runner, was a sight worth going miles
to see. Nichols failed to make even a
dent around Jim's end.

Harry Shipkey made a strong bid for
All-Pacific tackle in the California
game. The way he knocked "Stew"
Beam out of the competition to make
a hole for Ernie Nevers, made the
famous California linesman take a
lower berth.
* * *
Bob Cravens was knocked out cold
twice during the game, but each time
he came back to take more, and gave
as much. This was Bob's last year and
his showing on the line Saturday puts
him among the stars of the classic.

Neither "Scotchy" Campbell nor
Don Nichols got away for big gains
in running back punts. Both teams
were concentrating their efforts on
getting the safety men, and both suc
ceeded.
