# RAIDS! MONOPOLY! FINANCIERS HOARD NINE â€“ CENT FAGS
## 
### 
Stanford is well known for her
financiers, but it appears that she
also has some super-financiers.
A few of those will be smoking
"Lucky Strikes" at the meagre
price of 9 cents a package for some
time to come, because of their
cleverness in getting the monopoly
on the campus offered by the Amer
ican Tobacco company in its large
advertisement, run in the Daily
Palo Alto last week.
The New York Times refused to
run the ad because it feared a raid
on the papers on the stands in New
York.
