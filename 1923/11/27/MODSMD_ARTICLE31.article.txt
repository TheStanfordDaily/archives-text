# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
Since the last issue of Spectator ap
peared on the campus two rather con
demnatory "Viewpoints" have ap
peared in your columns, and I take
this opportunity of pointing out some
of the false positions taken by the
writers thereof. Not that it really
makes any difference; after both they
and I have written all that we may
care to, probably none of us shall
have budged an inch from our origi
nal proposition: mine, that the spon
sor system is not working as it
should; theirs, that the editor of Spec
tator is an Ananias, an "all-wise"
party with nothing constructive to
offer.
Well, anyway: both Mr. T. I. and
W. L. jumped to a conclusion after
having read "Bursted Bubbles," and
dashed madly to the typewriter to
kick lusty kicks at the shins of the
writer. Unfortunately, their conclusion
was wrong; which will probably not
deter their vociferous defense of it.
My whole proposition was, not "a con
tinual and traditional howl about
freshmen," but a howl about the spon
sors, using the freshmen to point to
the failure of the system.
Solidify Freshman Class
There are probably reasons for the
conclusion taken by the two gentle
men in question. In the first place, it
would solidify opinion in the Fresh
man Class that the sponsor system is
a thing to be maintained at all haz
ards if the writers could convince the
freshmen that I was attempting to
kick the freshmen, and not the spon
sor system, in the teeth.
"The freshmen are trying," says Mr.
W. L. We know that as well as you
do. dear sir, but what we want to
tell you is that they haven't the
chance they should have, no matter
how they try, and that through no
fault of their own.
Who Won Little Big Game?
You have cited the winning of'the
Little Big Game by '27 as an example
of what the freshmen are doing. Grant
ed. Unfortunately you go on to assume
most of the credit of the victory for
the sponsor system; but I somehow
can't see the connection.
We were somewhat disappointed in
Mr. T. I.'s "Viewpoint." Especially
where he attacks the statement that
we had witnessed booing of a referee
from a freshman audience, and "as
sumes" that it was at the Little Big
Game. In view of the fact that 1 had
informed him three days before his
viewpoint appeared that the booing
was done at an early-season inter
class game, his statement seems
somewhat startling. We know, as well
as he, that there was no booing of
the referee at the Little Big Garrve;
that. too. is not due to the sponsors,
but to the men who have refused to
countenance it in Stanford rooting
sections.
T. I. Says '26 Vote Stampeded
T. 1. refuses to look at the vote
cast by the class of '26 after a talk
by a sponsor explaining the system,
but claims that, it was "stampeded."
By whom? Byt the sponsor? If so, why
was it not cast in favor of the sys
tem, instead of against it? We shall
hurry to T. I.'s defense by stating
that he has had so much experience
with stampeded votes during the last,
year that he cannot realize that now
and again one "goes through" without
someone tipping the scale by some
underhanded means, such as waving a
big stick at twenty or so members of
the voting body!
Both of you writers set the per
centage of freshmen who speak higher
than we, but then both of you are
known to freshmen, and could walk
around collecting "data" until your
shoes wore out and it wouldn't mean
a thing. Perhaps there are upperclass
men who do not speak first; perhaps
there are upperclassmen who do not
speak at all. Grant that; yet each year
this group of upperclassmen who re
fuse to answer will grow as it is fed
by the underclassmen who refused to
speak when they were new here. And
again we say that maybe it does not
matter at all, except as being indica
tive of something deeper . . . some
thing that does matter.
Frosh Not Up to Standards
You claim that the freshmen are
living up to the same standards as
before. We claim that they aie not,
and blame the sponsor system, not
the freshmen, for it. Hurling invec
tive at someone who has dared to
contradict you has never yet succeed-

Ed in (loins more than disgust some,
amuse others, and weary still more.!
We are sorry that we cannot agree,
with you; but, as we stated in the!
first paragraph, your fundamental
proposition being what it is, we could
hardly be expected to do so. You have
demanded something constructive, but
an architect never begins to rebuild j
until he has satisfied the owner that
some other architect yells "Ananias"!
does not bother a great deal. He will
go on working until some governing
body passes laws prohibiting remod
eling, or until the owner decides very
definitely that he is tired of remodel
ing, himself.
If I were giving a word of advice to
the architect who yelled "Ananias.",
f would toll him for God's sake (and
his own, too) to shut up, get out his I
slide rule and compass, and go to
work to prove the faults in the plans i
for rebuilding, or to prove that the j
quate. Then, if I were still called
on for advice, I would tell the archi-j
tect bent on rebuilding that, if his
rival proved his plans unsound, HE
had better be a sport and throw his |
plans away, and go back to the I
drafting room awhile.
Need Constructive Criticism
And, after I had given all that
nice advice, I would probably be |
called a sensible man by both part- j
ies, and they would go 011 just as i
they had before. Which is often the
way people have.
I shall not take up more space
which had better be used in Cab
bages, and I hope that, unless T. I.
and W. L. have "something constru
ctive to offer," they will realize that
"no good can come from provo-!
cative and prevaricative discussion." j
I say I hope so, but hasn't some wise!
man said that "Hope is at best a 1
fleeting thing?"
Thank you, Mr. Editor of the
Daily, for your space.
â€”Henry iUaek.
