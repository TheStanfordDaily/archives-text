# Red Cross Is Conducting Drive for Membership
## 
### 
The anual drive for membership in
the Red Cross is being conducted
among all residents on the campus,
except students, and will continue
until November 29, when the National
Red Cross Campaign proclaimed by
President Coolidge will end. Students
are not being asked to pay dues at
this time on account of the United
Campaign which was in progress last
week.
The first part of December, how
ever, solicitors will be sent among
the students. Those residents of the
campus who desire to pay dues but
do not know who is authorized to re
ceive them, may send their money to
Professor Fairclough of the Classical
department, who is directing the cam
paign.
