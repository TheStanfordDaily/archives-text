# McCALL TO TALK ON NEXT WAR IN LECTURE TONIGHT
## "Christ and Armageddon" Series Will Be Continued In Assembly Hall 
### 
Dr. Oswald "W. S. McCall will give the
fourth of his series of lectures on
"Christ or Armageddon" in the As
sembly hall this evening, instead of
in the Memorial Church. The lecture,
which is included as one of the regu
lar Tuesday evening talks, will com
mence at 7:30.
In his talk, Dr. McCall will discuss
America and the next war, bringing
out the thought that it is impossible
to build a lasting peace on war. His
attitude toward war with its horrors
and needless suffering is a result of
his own experience on the front during
the last war.
Due to Thanksgiving vacation, there
will be no other lectures this week.
Following Dr. McCall's address,
Captain E. L. Beach will report on
the recent meeting of the World Alli
ance for Peace, held in Chicago. It
was at this convention that the Palo
Alto peace plan, known as the People's
International Movement for Peace,
was endorsed for adoption over the
world.
