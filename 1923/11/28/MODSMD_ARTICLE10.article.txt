# 1925 QUAD STAFF CREATES POSITION OF WOMEN'S EDITOR
## Highest Woman Candidate Will Rank Third on Staff of Annual 
### 
A woman's editorship has been
created by the 1925 Quad manage
ment as a new executive position for
next year's staff. The office will be
appointive and will rank third after
the editor and assistant editor.
This year's Quad management with
the consent of the men tryoutees on
the 192G staff will appoint the 1926
woman's editor. It is hoped, however,
to make the office a permanent fea
ture of the Quad organization. In this
case the women's editor will be ap
pointed by the six members of the try
out board at the same time they make
nominations for editor and manager.
Members of the 1925 Quad staff
look upon this new office as a signifi
cant change. Up to this time women
tryoutees have had no definite office
on the Quad staff. They have had
nothing to work for except a place
on the staff. But next year, the woman
tryoutee who ranks highest may be
certain of a definite executive posi
tion.
