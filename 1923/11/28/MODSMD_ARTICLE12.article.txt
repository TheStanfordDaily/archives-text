# Executive Committee Endorses New Size For 1925 Junior Quad
## 
### 
The change in page size to be ef
fected in the 1925 Quad which was
endorsed last night by the Executive
Committee, calls for a page measuring
nine inches by twelve inches as com
pared with the present size of eight
inches by ten inches.
The change has been approved by
the junior board of control and by the
sophomore class, with the assurance
that the new size will be continued
next year.
The advantages of the new size are
three: (1) advantages arising from
the fact that with the larger page, the
book can be made considerably thin
ner and will still contain the same
amount of material; (2) better "lay
out" and greater variety of page ar
rangements; and (3) better results
from the standpoint of artistic design.
New Size Easier to Bind
With the book materially thinner, it
will bind more satisfactorily; it will
be more easily handled, and a sub
stantial saving will be effected in cer
tain of the technical processes of book
manufacture.
These savings are being put back
into the book in such forms as the
purchase of higher grade book paper,
more expensive engraving, and a more
extensive outlay in commercial art
work.

All pictures in this year's book will
face in the direction in which the 1
book opens and not at right angles,
as has been the case in the past with
such pictures as those of living groups, j
This phase of the change eliminates
one of the awkward features inherent
in the smaller size. The actual num
ber of square inches within the bor- 1
ders of the new size varies in differ-1
ent parts of the book from once and a
half to twice as many as in the former j
size. This feature makes it possible;
to run such groups as fraternities and
honorary societies one to a page, with
out any crowding.
Trend Is Toward Change
The management believes that the
change in page-size is in keeping with
the general trend among leading col
lege annuals.
The principal objection to the
change thus far voiced is that the
new size can not be accommodated on
the same shelf with the smaller vol
umes, that it will "break up" the Bet.
The Quad management believes, how
ever, that the advantages of the new
size will more than compensate for
this inconvenience, more especially
since only three classes (sophomores,
Juniors, and seniors) will be affected,
and these only for the present.

amount of material; (2) better "lay
out" and greater variety of page ar
rangements; and (3) better results
from the standpoint of artistic design.
New Size Easier to Bind
With the book materially thinner, it
will bind more satisfactorily; it will
be more easily handled, and a sub
stantial saving will be effected in cer
tain of the technical processes of book
manufacture.
These savings are being put back
into the book in such forms as the
purchase of higher grade book paper,
more expensive engraving, and a more
extensive outlay in commercial art
work.

All pictures in this year's book will
face in the direction in which the 1
book opens and not at right angles,
as has been the case in the past with
such pictures as those of living groups, j
This phase of the change eliminates
one of the awkward features inherent
in the smaller size. The actual num
ber of square inches within the bor- 1
ders of the new size varies in differ-1
ent parts of the book from once and a
half to twice as many as in the former j
size. This feature makes it possible;
to run such groups as fraternities and
honorary societies one to a page, with
out any crowding.
Trend Is Toward Change
The management believes that the
change in page-size is in keeping with
the general trend among leading col
lege annuals.
The principal objection to the
change thus far voiced is that the
new size can not be accommodated on
the same shelf with the smaller vol
umes, that it will "break up" the Bet.
The Quad management believes, how
ever, that the advantages of the new
size will more than compensate for
this inconvenience, more especially
since only three classes (sophomores,
Juniors, and seniors) will be affected,
and these only for the present.
The change in page size to be ef
fected in the 1925 Quad which was
endorsed last night by the Executive
Committee, calls for a page measuring
nine inches by twelve inches as com
pared with the present size of eight
inches by ten inches.
The change has been approved by
the junior board of control and by the
sophomore class, with the assurance
that the new size will be continued
next year.
The advantages of the new size are
three: (1) advantages arising from
the fact that with the larger page, the
book can be made considerably thin
ner and will still contain the same
amount of material; (2) better "lay
out" and greater variety of page ar
rangements; and (3) better results
from the standpoint of artistic design.
