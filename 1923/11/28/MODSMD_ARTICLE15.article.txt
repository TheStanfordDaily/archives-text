# World Peace or Downfall To Be Dr. McCall's Topic
## 
### 
"World-Peace or Downfall!" will be
discussed by Dr. Oswald W. S. McOall
in his fifth lecture at Stanford, Mon-j
day at 7:30, in the Memorial Church.
The general title of his six addresses
is "Christ or Armageddon."
Civilization is facing its most seri
ous crisis, in the opinion of Dr. Mc-
Call. It is necessary to achieve last
ing and universal peace to prevent
disaster, for the world can not stand.

All this talk about sponsors and
freshmen has at least made the tirst
year men speak more cheerfully and
more frequentlyâ€”those who would
speak anyway, and a little Senior Con
trol of upperclassmen might help a
I few oldtimers to speak when spoken
i to.

"Home is just a woman's sympathy
surrounded by four walls."
