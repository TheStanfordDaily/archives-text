Six Cardinal football men took po
sitions on All-Pacific teams picked by
George T. Davis of the San Francisco
! "Bulletin." Captain "Scotchy" Camp
, bell, Ernie Nevers, and Bob Cravens
: were placed on the first eleven which
is as follows:
Ends, Phythian (U. S. C.) and
Hickey (W. S. C.); tackles, Beam (C)
, and Locey (O. A. C.) guards, Cravens
i (S) and Bellman (W); center, Hor
rell (C); quarterback, Campbell (S);
I halfbacks, Nichols (C) and Wilson
|(W); fullback, Nevers (S).
Two Cards on Second Team
Jim Lawson at end and Dick Faville

at guard would play on Davis' second
mythical eleven, while Harry Shipkey,
Cardinal tackle, was placed on the
third team.
Stanford, California, and Washing
ton led the Pacific Coast institutions
in representatives, each contributing
six men. U. S. C. and Idaho followed
with four apiece, W. S. C. with three,
and O. A. C. and Oregon brought up
the list with a pair of gridmen.
In commenting upon his selection
for the position of general for his pre
mier team, Davis said, "A three-cor
nered fight for the quarterback job
was one of the keenest of the season.
Campbell is given the honor for his
fine leadership and running back of
punts, with the exception of the Cali
fornia game when the Cardinal cap
tain had an off-day.
"Cravens Best Guard"
"Cravens stands out as the best
guard on the Coast and the fight for
the other position was a close one be
tween Faville and Bellman. However,
an injury to the Stanford man handi
capped him early in the season, while
Bellman was one of the mainstays in
the strong Washington line."
As to the selection of the All-Coast
fullback, Davis says: "If there was
any doubt about the fullback position,
it was settled in the Stanford-Cali
fornia game, when Nevers did some
splendid playing.
"The only fault with his playing is
that he took too much time on his
kicks, but the poor passes and lack
of protection given him were largely
responsible for so many blocked
punts.
"His powerful line bucking was mag
nificent, while he backed up the Cardi
nal line in wonderful fashion."
Summarizing his choices, Davis
said: "The idea of selecting a 'playing
team,' even though it is mythical, is
kept in mind. Each combination pos
sesses a varied attack; has a good
kicker, a capable receiver of punts, a
fast open-field runner, and valuable
players for a forward passing game."
