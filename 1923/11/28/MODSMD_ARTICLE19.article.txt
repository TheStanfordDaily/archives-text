# THE 						QUAD EXPANDS
## 
### 
Sanction was given the 1925 Quad by the Executive Committee last
night for an increase in page size from eight by ten inches to nine by
twelve. The Quad management had previously received the approval of
the Junior Class, and had received assurance from the sophomores that
they would continue the new form.
In another part of the Daily appears an explanation of the change and
reasons for making it. The arguments which influenced the Executive
Committee to endorse the plan were two: first, that the bigger page
would allow for a better display, and do away with the plan of having
group pictures at right angles so that one must turn the book to see
them; second, that the bigger book would be thinner in proportion, and
much less unwieldy than last year's dictionary size.
Only one argument was presented against the new size: that a few
of the faculty and alumni had complete sets, whose esthetic beauty in
the bookshelves would be ruined if a longer Quad were inaugurated.
Aside from the fact that this argument was the same used in favor of
the retention of narrow gauge railroads and gas lights, the committee
felt that the students' best interests were to be considered in the year
book rather than the alumni bookshelves, and so endorsed the change for
the student benefit.
