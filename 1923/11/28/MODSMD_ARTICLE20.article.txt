# LAURELS FOR ROOTERS AND YELL-LEADER
## 
### 
An excellent example of how hard work can overcome difficulties is
offered in the success of Stanford's head yell-leader. Alumni and students
have commented frequently during the past few weeks on the co
operation and enthusiasm of the Cardinal rooting section, and the ability
of the cheer-leader.
Confidence in the red-shirted team to play real football added a joyful
zest to the staccato barking of the 1923 leather-lungs. It has been said
that the work of the rooters was far above average during the football
season just closed. Last Saturday members of the rooting section indi
vidually and together played the game every minute that the Cardinal
varsity was fighting on the gridiron.
However, the present yell-leader has undoubtedly eclipsed many of
his predecessors in his unceasing effort to improve yells and songs—in
concentrating Stanford spirit into a tangible aid to the varsity. He
deserves considerable credit for the results obtained.
The smooth manner in which the bleacher stunts formed colorful
defiance to the Golden Bear at the 1923 Big Game was gratifying after
several memorable failures in the past. It is doubtful that the average
intelligence of the University has risen, but it is certain that there was
careful planning and clear direction by cards and voice. —R. E.
