# THE 						BERKELEY BOWL
## 
### 
""Stanford supporters last Saturday were able to get their first glimpse
of the new stadium upon which a great part of the University of Cali
fornia has been expending its efforts for the past three years. They
were able to see the stadium, watch a clean, hard game not marred by
unsportsmanlike practices, and admire the beauty of a great bowl in a
setting of brown hills, without the hindrances, petty delays, and red tape
technicalities which one usually associates with the handling of crowds
at football games. That this was possible was due to the efforts of the
California graduate manager and his assistants, whose perfected and
smooth-running organization was the last touch required to make a
visitor's first impression of the Berkeley Bowl in every way pleasing.
