First Century
"Has the Garden of Eden a future?"
"Yes, of course. We always have lived in the Garden and we always shall.
It is here to stay. All things that have been must continue to be. They are
facts."
First Century
"Has Idol-worship a future?"
"Yes, of course. We always have worshiped idols and we always shall.
What else is there to worship? Idols are facts."
Tenth Century
"Has Feudalism a future?"
"Yes, of course. Feudalism is here and here to stay. How else could we
get our work done and carry on our social and political affairs? Feudalism
is a fact."
Twelfth Century
"Has the Inquisition a future?"
"Yes, of course. How else could we wring the truth out of these rascal
heretics? Any attempt to abolish the system would wreck our religion and
send the world to perdition. The Inquisition is a fact."
Sixteenth Century "
"Has Duelling a future?"
"Yes, of course. We always have decided our disputes by duelling and we
always shall. How else could a man vindicate his honor? Duelling is a fact."
Twentieth Century
"Has the College Greek a future?"
"Yes, of course. Fraternities are here and here to stay and multiply. They
are so deeply rooted that they cannot be pulled up. Those are facts."
Envoi
"Has the human race a future?"
"Yes, of course. It always had had a future and it always will. But since
nothing that once exists can ever cease or change, its future will be simply
More of the Same. In the lexicon of humanity there's no such word as novelty
or improvement. Facts are immutable and traditions are sacro-sanct. What
ever was, is, and evermore shall be. Let it alone!" —F. T. R.
