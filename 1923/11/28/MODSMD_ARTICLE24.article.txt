"Ten Seconds Sooner"
A Drama of Fate
John Benton, an
honest wage-earner
and a good husband,
bade his wife and
nine loving children
an affectionate good
bye at his door, and
strode away to work,
little realizing what
was in store for him.
He was soon in the
relentless City.
Not many steps ahead
a huge safe hung over
the sidewalk directly
above the spot (marked
X) that Benton was to
cross over. He stopped
to tie his shoe-lace.
The act took just ten
seconds. Precisely at
the end of that time
the safe fell on the X.
John Benton's face
turned an ashen hue.
And at that moment he
was tagged for the
Eskimo Gum Drop Relief
Fund. "Just my luck!"
he growled savagely.

I The telepnone switchboard in Toyon
hall was tested recently in completing
connections and forty or fifty students
in their rooms ran bewildered into the
hall to seek the solution of the buzzes
j up and down the corridor, thinking
1 the noise to be a general fire alaYm.
"R. U. R.," a play by Karel Capek,
depicting artificial beings without
souls, has been produced on the stage
