THE VIRGINIAN—Stanford Thea
ter. Even if you know the book, you
will still enjoy the picture. Praise can
go no further. The spirit of the story
has been kept, and only the necessary
changes in action have been made. It
is, of course, not perfect;but it is far

and away the best Western film we
have seen in many moons.
Florence Vidor Is one of the few
real actresses on the screen. Select
ing her for the feminine lead was
one of the wisest things the director
ever did. The choice of Kenneth
Harlan for the Virginian was not
quite so happy. He is satisfactory in 1
the role; but his face lacks the cha
racter that Wister's Virginian pos-.

sessed. He is a charming boy, and his'
grin is lovely.
The picture would be worth the
price if only for the settings. There
is one scene, that of the hanging,
that is just about as effective as a
movie scene could be. And the sub
titles, being taken for the most part
from the book, are not objectionable— i
which is enough in itself to mark the j
ordinary.

MOTHERS IN-LAW—Varsity thea
ter. Almost as bad as its title. We
need quote only the blurb: "A story
of a daughter-in-law who forgot her
marriage vows, and of a mother-in
law who made her remember them."
Of course, if you like that sort of
thing .

One-third as many women commit
suicide ear li year as men.
