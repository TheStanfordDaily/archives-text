### Clarence Osborn, '23 
The way of a woman with a man is
quite remarkably illustrated by an anec
dote by Johan Bojer. The principals of
the story are Bjornstjern Bjornson and
Jonas Lie, and the time dates back to
student days in Paris before either of the
gentlemen in question became famous.
It happened that Bjornson and Lie
were promenading on one of the
Parisian boulevards when they were ac
costed by a beggar. Lie turned to
Bjornson and said: "Bjornson, give the
man a franc; I haven't a sou in my
pockets."
"But I have not a sou either, Jonas,"
replied the burly Bjornson.
"What? No money?" »
"No, you see my Karoline—. Why is
it that you have no money, Jonas?"
"Well, you see my Thomasine never
gives me more than carfare."
"It is the same with me, Jonas. You
see, although we can both write, our
wives hold the reins."
"Yes, Bjornson, they treat us as though
we were ordinary human bengs. But
what is the object of their treatment of
us ?"
"It must be, Jonas, that when they
know that we have no money they feel
safe in letting us go out upon the boule
vards."
Both Decide to Rebell
So the two decided to kick over the
traces. They entered the best cafe they
knew, ordered the best meal and the best
wines possible, and when the bill was
presented they explained to the pro
prietor their identity and their financial
condition. Their host displayed the
usual kindliness of such hosts to such
impoverished guests and threatened them
with dire calamity and ruin. It was
finally agreed upon that Lie should stay
as hostage and face the wrath of the
Tiger, while Bjornson should go and face
the Lady Karoline and attempt to obtain
from the "Boss of the Family" money
enough to pay the bill and keep the gay
revellers out of jail. Bojer does not re
veal the domestic scene that followed,
nor does he suggest that Bjornson and
Lie ever attempted another rebellion
against their marital domination.
