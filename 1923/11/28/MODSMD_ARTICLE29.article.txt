# Who Is Bojer?
## 
### 
Johan Bojer was born March 6, 1872,
near a little village on the northwest
coast of Norway. His mother was a
servant girl, too poor to care for her
young son, and so he was put out to
nurse. He spent his time, when a
youngster, in fishing, herding cattle, go
ing to school once a week, and attending
church every Sunday. At the age ot
fifteen he heard for the first time that
something called poetry. It was reading
of Peer Gvnt in such a way as "to
even the strongest boys cry."
A later turn of fortune enabled him to
attend a school for non-commissioned
officers, and it was there that he discov
ered the vitality and power of literature.
He learned English from a porter, who
was subsequently sent to prison for man
slaughter. He took courses in the his
tory of European literature. He heard
two lectures, one by Herman Bang and
the other by Knut Hamsun, and by the
force of these two lectures his ambitions
were swung from a choice between farm
ing and the army to an intense desire to
create literature.
Work Was Varied
From 1894 to 1895 he was, successively,
a fisherman, a clerk, and a sewing ma
chine agent. In 1894 his first literary at
tempt, a play, was produced in his native
village. For this presentation of
"Mother" he received an horonarium
(when we used to get such a thing on the
first and fifteenth of each month we
called it "wages") of 600 kronen (in
our language 175 berries) and from this
start lie has built up his literary career.
Since then he has been a newspaper
correspondent, a student in Paris; he has
lived three years in Italy, five years in
France, and has wandered over Den
mark, Germany, and England. He has
slept under straw stacks in Holland, has
learned the art galleries of Belgium by
heart. Then lie returned to Norway bet
ter equipped to pursue his art.
Bojer's Marriage Happy
He was married in 1899 and has three
children. Unlike his Raider Bang in
"Life" his marital relations have been
extremely happy. But it was not until
1915 that he settled down. At that time
lie built a home in Christianna, and after
forty-three years of wandering he is situ
ated comfortably in his native northland.
He studies there in winter and writes
during the summer months: He draws
his conception of literature from a broad
knowledge of French, Italian, German,
and English masterpieces as well as from
a keen interpretation of the classics.
Although he lias written dramas and
novels, lie has never attempted poetry.
Bojer explains this lapse by saying, "[
tried to write poetry when my wife was
my fiancec. It was not a success. And
if a man cannot write poetry when in
love, when can he ?"
