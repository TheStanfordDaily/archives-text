# SPIRIT OF STRIFE DUE TO AMERICA SAYS DR. MCCALL
## United States Can Save or Break Heart of World Asserts Lecturer 
### 
Of all the influences today working
toward a new embroilment, American
isolation is the greatest, according to
Dr. Oswald W. S. McCall, who gave
his fourth lecture on the subject of
peace yesterday evening.
"If the last war was encouraged by
the official class of Germany, the
strongest tendency today toward strife
is the official attitude of this repub
lic," he declared.
America Can Save the World
"America can save the world or
break its heart. She is able to stand
with normal frankness before the na
tions and protest that the day is past
for international distrust. But she has
parried advance after advance, de
clined invitation after invitation to
step into leadership. As the nations
look upon us, it is not surprising that
they find us a dismaying spectacle"
Anferica never stood higher in the
appreciation of the world than at the
close of the last war, Dr. McCall be
lieves. The world heard the President,
with a voice not unworthy of a pro
phet, pleading with humanity for a!
better frame of mind among men, till
a recurrence of such an experience
would be impossible.
Felt America Had Failed
Then something happened, and thej
great voice died away. People felt that
this country was still true, that be
cause the League of Nations was not
free from old world ideas, America
would not offer stone for bread, but
would come back with a better propo
sition. So the world waited. But Ameri
ca put on the brakes when the world
wanted to advance. The nations felt
that America had failed.
"The world is crying for the light
of a new days and the fraternity of a
new humanity," asserted Dr. McCall.
"Only one principle can hope to lead
the world to a condition of rest and
peace. That is the principle enunciated
by the Galilean, of fraternity practi
cally lived."
Captain Beach Speaks
After Dr. McCall's lecture, Captain
E. L. Beach of the History department
told the audience about the People's
Movement for International Peace. He
pointed out that this movement was
an answer to Dr. McCall's question,
"What can the common man do?" The
Palo Alto peace movement is an im
portant part of the plan. Captain
Beach urged everyone interested in
permanent peace to join the move
ment.

told the audience about the People's
Movement for International Peace. He
pointed out that this movement was
an answer to Dr. McCall's question,
"What can the common man do?" The
Palo Alto peace movement is an im
portant part of the plan. Captain
Beach urged everyone interested in
permanent peace to join the move
ment.
Of all the influences today working
toward a new embroilment, American
isolation is the greatest, according to
Dr. Oswald W. S. McCall, who gave
his fourth lecture on the subject of
peace yesterday evening.
"If the last war was encouraged by
the official class of Germany, the
strongest tendency today toward strife
is the official attitude of this repub
lic," he declared.
America Can Save the World
"America can save the world or
break its heart. She is able to stand
with normal frankness before the na
tions and protest that the day is past
for international distrust. But she has
parried advance after advance, de
clined invitation after invitation to
step into leadership. As the nations
look upon us, it is not surprising that
they find us a dismaying spectacle"
Anferica never stood higher in the
appreciation of the world than at the
close of the last war, Dr. McCall be
lieves. The world heard the President,
with a voice not unworthy of a pro
phet, pleading with humanity for a!
better frame of mind among men, till
a recurrence of such an experience
would be impossible.
Felt America Had Failed
Then something happened, and thej
great voice died away. People felt that
this country was still true, that be
cause the League of Nations was not
free from old world ideas, America
would not offer stone for bread, but
would come back with a better propo
sition. So the world waited. But Ameri
ca put on the brakes when the world
wanted to advance. The nations felt
that America had failed.
"The world is crying for the light
of a new days and the fraternity of a
new humanity," asserted Dr. McCall.
"Only one principle can hope to lead
the world to a condition of rest and
peace. That is the principle enunciated
by the Galilean, of fraternity practi
cally lived."
