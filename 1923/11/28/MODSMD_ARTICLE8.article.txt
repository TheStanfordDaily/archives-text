# CARDS, AGGIES WILL BATTLE FOR COAST POLO CHAMPIONSHIP
## Players Complete Practice for Thanksgiving Day Title Contest 
### 
Stanford and the Oregon Agricul-j
(ure College polo fours had their final
workout today in preparation for the
first Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Polo
championship contest, scheduled to
morrow afternoon on the local high
way field. The Cards and the Aggies
will meet in a second and final game!
011 Saturday afternoon. Both games'
will start at 3 o'clock.
The Oregon team has been practic
ing since arriving from the North lasti
Monday and having "felt out" the
strange field and horses, it declares
itself ready for the championship
battle. Stanford polo men gave the j
green turf a last try this afternoon'
and are confident that they will play
their best game, fully aware of the
fact that the Northern men are a
much stronger opponent than when
the two teams met at Corvallis earlier
In the season.
Oregon-Stanford Lineups
The Cardinal mallet swingers have
the edge in experienced players. Two
men of the Northern team are playing
their first year on the varsity while
the Cardinal four have all had at least
two years' experience. Fred Bacher,
who plays position No. 1, and Harvey
Dick at No. 4â€ž who is comparatively
new at the game, have convinced Cap
tain Glen Finley, the Oregon coach,
that they can permanently occupy
their respective positions. John Deley
and Modesti, who play- at positions
No. 2 and No. 3 have had previous
experience. Deley played with an army
team during the war.
Captain Charles Boyle, Cardinal polo
coach, stated today that he will use
the same lineup as that playing during
most of the season. Ray Tremaine will
play No. 1. He has shown exceptional
work at this position since Captain
Otto Barby was forced to withdraw
because of a recent operation. Rumor
to the effect that Otto would be back
in the game tomorrow is without af
firmation, Captain Boyle states. Barby
will not be back at No. 1 position until
the winter quarter. John Irwin, who
has shown real aggressiveness and
hard riding qualities, will occupy his
regular position at No. 2. Ralph Barby,
who is temporarily filling his brother's
position as captain of the team, will
swing the mallet at No. 3. Barby has
been showing good stroke work and
judgment, and Captain Boyle holds
him as one of the best student players
he has coached. Ed Lamb at No. 4 has
had little chance to star, but his work
has been an important factor in the
Stanford defense.
Ooaches Make Statements
When asked what he thought the
outcome of tomorrow's game would be,
Captain Boyle skid, "I think the Stan
ford team has been seasoned in the
games with the Santa Cruz Polo club
and the Thirtieth Infantry at San
Francisco. They should play the best
game they have played this year.
Stanford should win by several goals."
In a similar statement, Coach Finley
of the Oregon Aggies said, "Since last
playing Stanford at Corvallis, I have
changed the lineup and expect to beat
Stanford by a small score. I make this
statement with full appreciation of
the fact that Stanford has a particu
larly well-balanced team, but I believe
that, everything else being equal, the
climatic conditions, which are a tonic
to us, will put us over the top."

tration office and also in Palo Alto.

body cards will be 50 cents. Twenty
