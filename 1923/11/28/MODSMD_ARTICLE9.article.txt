# 'Captain Applejack' Cast To Rehearse During Holidays
## 
### 
Thanksgiving vacation will be a period
of hard work for the cast of "Captain
Applejack," according to present plans of
Gordon Davis. Commencing tonight, re
hearsals will be held twice a day with
the exception of Thursday.
Friday morning the costumes will ar
rive from the city. After the morning
rehearsal the actors will get their pirate |
clothes and other raiment in readiness j
for the pictures which are to be taken in I
the afternoon.
Davis says that the play is beginning
to look like something real and by the
end of the holidays should be all set for !
the final week of finishing. All the play
ers know their lines and are fitting bet-1
ter into their parts every day, he says.
Chrysella Dunker is making a new cx- j
perimcnt in the style of stage painting I
of the sets for the first and third acts, j
This new idea will make the scenes ap- 1
pear more realistic, and will do awa\ j
with the flimsy, unnatural effect that
stage settings usually give.
Five men were selected yesterday to i
play the parts of pirates in the seconci !
act of the drama. They are Charle '
Benedict, Hartley Devlin, Kenneth Hess,!
Gordon Williams, and Horace Pastorius. i
Another man will be chosen later.
