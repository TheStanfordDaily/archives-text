# CARDINAL POLO VARSITY CAPTURES COAST TITLE
## Stanford Team Wins From Oregon Agricultural College Four In Two Games, 8-3, 8-4 
### Donald Adams 
Stanford's polo team holds the intercollegiate championship of the Pacific
Coast as the result of defeating the Oregon Agricultural College four by a
score of 8-3 in a Thanksgiving Day game played on the highway field. The
Cardinal mallet swingers were victorious in a second game with the Aggies
played Saturday, when they won 8-4. Both games were well attended by
local polo enthusiasts and Oregon followers.
Ralph Barby was the star of Thursday's game with five of the eight goals
to his credit. Tremaine scored two of the Stanford goals. The remaining
point was scored by Modesti of the Oregon team, when he accidentally
pushed the ball between the Card goal posts in the third period. At no time
during the game did the Northern team threaten to take the lead. In the
fourth the Oregon poloists showed a slight spurt in scoring when Modesti and
Dick made two points, but the Cards had a lead of six points, and were able

to hold their opponents scoreless dur
ing the remaining two periods. Mo
desti made the first goal for the visi
tors in the third period.
Cards Better Players
The Stanford horsemen showed su
perior riding and playing from the
beginning. The first part of the con
test was slow, with a lack of long
drives. After the rest period between
the third and fourth chukkers, Irwin
and Barby managed to keep the ball
rolling in the open, which resulted in
several long drives and fast riding.
Increased familiarity with field and
mounts on the part of the Oregon
team made Saturday's game hotly con
tested. Despite the fact that the North
ern quartet threatened to take the
lead in the third chukker, the Stan
ford men were able to add another
game to the list of season victories'
defeating the Aggies S-4. Open field
riding with long drives were more in
evidence in this contest than in that
of Thursday. Twice during the last
half Stanford and Oregon riders were
nearly thrown from their horses.
Irwin and Barby Lead
Irwin and Ralph Barby each scored
three times for the Cards. Tremaine
made the remaining two goals. Bacher
was high goal man for the Oregon
four, making three of the four scores.
Modesti made the fourth. Stanford
held their opponents scoreless in the
last two periods.
Captain Otto Barby played the final
chukker in the place of Tremaine.
This was Barby's first appearance on
the field since his recent operation.

Stanford's polo team holds the intercollegiate championship of the Pacific
Coast as the result of defeating the Oregon Agricultural College four by a
score of 8-3 in a Thanksgiving Day game played on the highway field. The
Cardinal mallet swingers were victorious in a second game with the Aggies
played Saturday, when they won 8-4. Both games were well attended by
local polo enthusiasts and Oregon followers.
Ralph Barby was the star of Thursday's game with five of the eight goals
to his credit. Tremaine scored two of the Stanford goals. The remaining
point was scored by Modesti of the Oregon team, when he accidentally
pushed the ball between the Card goal posts in the third period. At no time
during the game did the Northern team threaten to take the lead. In the
fourth the Oregon poloists showed a slight spurt in scoring when Modesti and
Dick made two points, but the Cards had a lead of six points, and were able

to hold their opponents scoreless dur
ing the remaining two periods. Mo
desti made the first goal for the visi
tors in the third period.
Cards Better Players
The Stanford horsemen showed su
perior riding and playing from the
beginning. The first part of the con
test was slow, with a lack of long
drives. After the rest period between
the third and fourth chukkers, Irwin
and Barby managed to keep the ball
rolling in the open, which resulted in
several long drives and fast riding.
Increased familiarity with field and
mounts on the part of the Oregon
team made Saturday's game hotly con
tested. Despite the fact that the North
ern quartet threatened to take the
lead in the third chukker, the Stan
ford men were able to add another
game to the list of season victories'
defeating the Aggies S-4. Open field
riding with long drives were more in
evidence in this contest than in that
of Thursday. Twice during the last
half Stanford and Oregon riders were
nearly thrown from their horses.
Irwin and Barby Lead
Irwin and Ralph Barby each scored
three times for the Cards. Tremaine
made the remaining two goals. Bacher
was high goal man for the Oregon
four, making three of the four scores.
Modesti made the fourth. Stanford
held their opponents scoreless in the
last two periods.
Captain Otto Barby played the final
chukker in the place of Tremaine.
This was Barby's first appearance on
the field since his recent operation.
