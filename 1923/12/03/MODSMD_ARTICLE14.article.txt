# PROSPECTS FAVORABLE FOR MING QUINTET
## California and U. S. C. Strongest Competitors On Card Schedule; McHose Best Forward Bet 
### 
Prospects for a strong basketball team this season are brighter in many
ways than at the same time last year despite the loss of many first string
players. Just what Andy Kerr can develop from the 1926 stars is problem
atical, but the possibilities are in favor of his turning out a squad which,
with experience, speed, and weight, should make even a better showing than
the 1922 quintet.
What a year's coaching under the Warner system has done for the football
players is bound to have the somewhat same effect in basketball. Kerr took
charge of basketball for the first time last year, and with material which was
very promising to begin with, developed a squad which went through the
season undefeated until the crucial California series.
McHose at Forward
Captain "Nip" McHose is the best prospect for a forward position; the
other key place will be open more or less to competition. Frazier of the 1925

J team is a good goal shooter, but his
record is inconsistent. Nevers should
make a good forward, but is hardly
fast enough for the position and might
be used to better advantage as a guard
or center. He has the height and
weight requisite of a good pivot man,
and is an accurate shot.
Dave Oliva is eligible this season,
and is certain to be seen back in his
old place at guard, with Freddie An
derson holding down a corresponding
position as running safety.
Trojans Have Same Team
Stanford's strongest opponents will
be California and U. S. C. The Tro
jans have practically the same team
as last year, which .while defeated
repeatedly by the Cards, was never
theless a formidable aggregation. It is
hard to say just what the Bears will
have in shape of another champion
ship team. There is always enough good
material wandering about the Berke
j ley campus to warrant a good squad,
| and to say that the Bruins will again
be strong contenders is only to fore
cast the inevitable.
The first game on the schedule will
, be played against the Stanford alumni
a week from next Saturday. Then fol
low contests with the College of the
Pacific, the Olympic Club, and Santa
I Clara, before the first two-game series
with U. S. C. at Stanford. Two con
tests with Nevada precede the first
game with California on the Card
court. The rest of the schedule is
taken up with U. S. C. and California.

hard to say just what the Bears will
have in shape of another champion
ship team. There is always enough good
material wandering about the Berke
j ley campus to warrant a good squad,
| and to say that the Bruins will again
be strong contenders is only to fore
cast the inevitable.
The first game on the schedule will
, be played against the Stanford alumni
a week from next Saturday. Then fol
low contests with the College of the
Pacific, the Olympic Club, and Santa
I Clara, before the first two-game series
with U. S. C. at Stanford. Two con
tests with Nevada precede the first
game with California on the Card
court. The rest of the schedule is
taken up with U. S. C. and California.
Prospects for a strong basketball team this season are brighter in many
ways than at the same time last year despite the loss of many first string
players. Just what Andy Kerr can develop from the 1926 stars is problem
atical, but the possibilities are in favor of his turning out a squad which,
with experience, speed, and weight, should make even a better showing than
the 1922 quintet.
What a year's coaching under the Warner system has done for the football
players is bound to have the somewhat same effect in basketball. Kerr took
charge of basketball for the first time last year, and with material which was
very promising to begin with, developed a squad which went through the
season undefeated until the crucial California series.
McHose at Forward
Captain "Nip" McHose is the best prospect for a forward position; the
other key place will be open more or less to competition. Frazier of the 1925

J team is a good goal shooter, but his
record is inconsistent. Nevers should
make a good forward, but is hardly
fast enough for the position and might
be used to better advantage as a guard
or center. He has the height and
weight requisite of a good pivot man,
and is an accurate shot.
Dave Oliva is eligible this season,
and is certain to be seen back in his
old place at guard, with Freddie An
derson holding down a corresponding
position as running safety.
Trojans Have Same Team
Stanford's strongest opponents will
be California and U. S. C. The Tro
jans have practically the same team
as last year, which .while defeated
repeatedly by the Cards, was never
theless a formidable aggregation. It is
hard to say just what the Bears will
have in shape of another champion
ship team. There is always enough good
material wandering about the Berke
j ley campus to warrant a good squad,
