# CLASS BASKETBALL SERIES WILL OPEN TOMORROW EVENING
## Juniors, Freshmen Will Play First and Second Team Games This Week 
### 
The 1923-24 interclass basketball sea
son will be officially opened tomorrow
evening when the freshman first and sec
ond teams swing into action against the
sophomore quintets on the Pavilion floor.
The second team game will start at 7:15,
the first team clash following at 8
o'clock.
Class practice has been held the past
two weeks and, according to C. W.
Davis, director of intramural athletics,
some lively competition will be forth
coming during the season. The yearlings
lead the classes in numbers turning out
and in interest shown, but the second
year men are not far behind. Few
seniors and juniors have made their ap
pearance for pre-season skirmishes, but
Davis hopes for better turnouts this
week.
Interclass meets only will occupy the
center of the basketball stage this quar
ter, leaving intramural competition until
January and February. However, this
interclass practice and work will enable
house men and living groups to get in
a few workouts, according to Davis, who
further urges all men to turn out for
the class games this quarter. "As third
and fourth-year men are conspicuous by
their absence, this urging is directed at
them," said Davis.
A call lias been sent out by Davis to
all representatives of intramural organi
zations in regard to a meeting on Tues
day, December 11, to arrange a schedule
of practices and games.
All interclass games will he played on
the Pavilion door unless otherwise
stated, as in the case of two games to be
played later in the season in Encina
Gymnasium. Every clash is to be a
double-header, both first and second
teams to play, except on December 8 and
12, when the first teams will settle their
arguments as preliminaries to varsity
clashes.
The same is true of the scheduled
times for the games, the first squads
playing at 8 p. m. and the seconds at
7:15, except upon the dates mentioned
and December 11 and 14. when the sec
ond fives meet at 4:45 on Encina floor.
The game schedule, which applies to
both first and second team games unless
otherwise stated, is as follows:
Tuesday, December 4 —Sophomores vs.

them," said Davis.
A call lias been sent out by Davis to
all representatives of intramural organi
zations in regard to a meeting on Tues
day, December 11, to arrange a schedule
of practices and games.
All interclass games will he played on
the Pavilion door unless otherwise
stated, as in the case of two games to be
played later in the season in Encina
Gymnasium. Every clash is to be a
double-header, both first and second
teams to play, except on December 8 and
12, when the first teams will settle their
arguments as preliminaries to varsity
clashes.
The same is true of the scheduled
times for the games, the first squads
playing at 8 p. m. and the seconds at
7:15, except upon the dates mentioned
and December 11 and 14. when the sec
ond fives meet at 4:45 on Encina floor.
The game schedule, which applies to

The 1923-24 interclass basketball sea
son will be officially opened tomorrow
evening when the freshman first and sec
ond teams swing into action against the
sophomore quintets on the Pavilion floor.
The second team game will start at 7:15,
the first team clash following at 8
o'clock.
Class practice has been held the past
two weeks and, according to C. W.
Davis, director of intramural athletics,
some lively competition will be forth
coming during the season. The yearlings
lead the classes in numbers turning out
and in interest shown, but the second
year men are not far behind. Few
seniors and juniors have made their ap
pearance for pre-season skirmishes, but
Davis hopes for better turnouts this
week.
Interclass meets only will occupy the
center of the basketball stage this quar
ter, leaving intramural competition until
January and February. However, this
interclass practice and work will enable
house men and living groups to get in
a few workouts, according to Davis, who
further urges all men to turn out for
the class games this quarter. "As third
and fourth-year men are conspicuous by
their absence, this urging is directed at
them," said Davis.
