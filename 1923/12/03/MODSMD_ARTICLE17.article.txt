# A 						GARMENT OF WHOLE CLOTH
## 
### 
A man comes to college in search of an education. Granted? Thanks.
Let us suppose he is given an education rounded and complete. He has
a technical knowledge which fits him to be leader in whatever profession
he chooses, has enough energy and practical experience of the world to
take his place as leader, has enough diversity of interest to know how to
spend wisely the money he earns, and is able to carry on an intelligent
conversation in all classes of society.
That is what a college does for its students. To bring this ideal
training to completion a college gives to every man equally a variety of
technical courses, a still greater variety of cultural courses, both of the
highest standards, furnishes enough incentive to hard work and enough
of a taste of the scramble for a living "off the campus" to let every
student know what he will have to face later.
By these means the college previously supposed gives its students an
ideal education, rounded and complete.

The garment above fabricated fits the university curriculum of Stan
ford to the last seam—except that there is one sleeve too many.
Stanford's technical courses are the best on the Pacific Coast and
second in the United States; her cultural courses are given by scholars
known all over the world, her democratic ideals give all her students an
equal opportunity.
The extra sleeve, tagged "earning ability," will continue to dangle
useless and unfilled until there is some regulation providing that all men
students earn at least a part of their expenses while receiving their other
training.
The student who always walks into his classes late and then wonders
why lie receives low grades will later on be wondering why he is the first
to be laid off when his company is cutting down expenses.
A man returned to the campus this week-end with the wish-bones
of two turkeys in his pocket. He answered all inquiries by saying that
he intended to wish for more turkey. The method may be censured or
passed, depending on how greatly you condemn vicious circles or approve
of turkeys.
Any one who constantly carries a large attack of books under his
arm is either a book agent, a hypocrite, or a freshman.
The momentum required to overcome fundamental inertia is not
always supplied by a chimes ringing eight o'clock.
