A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Elbert
Elbert is a smart boy. When he went out for journalism they thought he
was good material, and he agreed with them. He had picked up a few neat
devices, short-cuts to smartness: to invert proverbs, to begin and end a
paragraph with the same phrase, to use unusual systems of spelling or
punctuation, and to coin new words. That was his repertoire. He was con- I
sistently smart. No one would have guessed that he was not satisfied with
his success.
But in fact he secretly acknowledged himself a failure, and the conscious
ness of it gnawed at his heart. For he had never become a Power on the
campus. Clever .as his writing was, it was never talked about.
Sometimes he would try to discuss things he had written with people who
did not know he had written them. He invariably found that they had not
read them. Even when he sacrificed good taste or wrote things that
injured people he was disappointed in the result.
If anyone had told Elbert that his writing Was ineffective because it was
fundamentally shallow, he would have replied that it was necessary to meet
people on their own level, and not shoot over their heads. He is far too smart
to realize that he stopped growing some time ago, and is now incapable of
telling people anything they do not already know.
It is the tragedy of his life that Elbert is a smart boy.
(To the Editor: i ask as a matter of right rather than as a favor, that this

Please do not publish my name, however, since you did not publish the name
of other writers in the column.—Jean, the nice girl).

Egbert
His major sport, as he screamingly puts it, is kidding the co-eds. He will
steal a vanity-case and carry it for days. This always gets a big laugh. Once
he put a girl's fur boa about his neck, and looked just too laughable for words!
All of us just roared!
Everybody says he should go on the stage, and make a lot of jack shaking !
laughs out of T. B. M.'s. Gee, I wish I was born a wise-cracker like Egbert.
* * *
Oh, well.
* * »
Now, this Egbert can be pushed so far, but then he goes ahead under his
own steam. He is the Funny Man of the Campus—he named himself.
Egbert's pet line, today, is: "Yes, we have none." By tomorrow he wilj
have thought out something good like "Nothin* but," or, "You ain't heard
nothin' yet!"
For instance, you might mention that there was a possibility that he might
not get seven letters from his sweetie this week. Without hardly thinkin* at
all, he will come right back with, "Where d'ya get that licker? I sure will,,
and I don't mean maybe."

injured people he was disappointed in the result.
If anyone had told Elbert that his writing Was ineffective because it was
fundamentally shallow, he would have replied that it was necessary to meet
people on their own level, and not shoot over their heads. He is far too smart
to realize that he stopped growing some time ago, and is now incapable of
telling people anything they do not already know.
It is the tragedy of his life that Elbert is a smart boy.

Egbert
His major sport, as he screamingly puts it, is kidding the co-eds. He will
steal a vanity-case and carry it for days. This always gets a big laugh. Once
he put a girl's fur boa about his neck, and looked just too laughable for words!
All of us just roared!
Everybody says he should go on the stage, and make a lot of jack shaking !
laughs out of T. B. M.'s. Gee, I wish I was born a wise-cracker like Egbert.

Oh, well.

Now, this Egbert can be pushed so far, but then he goes ahead under his
own steam. He is the Funny Man of the Campus—he named himself.
Egbert's pet line, today, is: "Yes, we have none." By tomorrow he wilj
have thought out something good like "Nothin* but," or, "You ain't heard
nothin' yet!"
For instance, you might mention that there was a possibility that he might
not get seven letters from his sweetie this week. Without hardly thinkin* at
all, he will come right back with, "Where d'ya get that licker? I sure will,,
and I don't mean maybe."

A CAMPUS ANTHOLOGY
Elbert
Elbert is a smart boy. When he went out for journalism they thought he
was good material, and he agreed with them. He had picked up a few neat
devices, short-cuts to smartness: to invert proverbs, to begin and end a
paragraph with the same phrase, to use unusual systems of spelling or
punctuation, and to coin new words. That was his repertoire. He was con- I
sistently smart. No one would have guessed that he was not satisfied with
his success.
But in fact he secretly acknowledged himself a failure, and the conscious
ness of it gnawed at his heart. For he had never become a Power on the
campus. Clever .as his writing was, it was never talked about.
Sometimes he would try to discuss things he had written with people who
did not know he had written them. He invariably found that they had not
read them. Even when he sacrificed good taste or wrote things that
injured people he was disappointed in the result.
If anyone had told Elbert that his writing Was ineffective because it was
fundamentally shallow, he would have replied that it was necessary to meet
people on their own level, and not shoot over their heads. He is far too smart
to realize that he stopped growing some time ago, and is now incapable of
