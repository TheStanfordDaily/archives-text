SCARMOUCHE — Now Showing a t
Capitol Theater, San Francisco
Rex Ingram presents a high-priced
picture in a high-class way. Scara
mouche, taken from the novel by Rafael
Sabatini, strikes one as an excellent his
torical drama portraying an age-old
theme, the French RevolutioH ,in an en
tirely new and actionable light. Alice
Terry in the lead is a rich nobleman's
daughter who is in love with the same
nobleman's adopted son, played by
Ramon Novarro. The young fellow,
who is a lawyer, becomes incensed at the
injustice of special license for wrong
granted noblemen. He deserts tlie fold,
especially when his sweetheart receives;
the attentions of his hated rival, a mar
quis, played by Lewis Stone. The lawyer
is wanted by the authorities for his radi
cal speeches and is condemned to hang, i
but he escapes and takes the part of
Scaramouche, a comedian, in a company'
of traveling player?. As the revolution j
ripens he becomes a leader, and when I
the assembly meets he, with Danton and |
Marat, deliver fiery speeches. A num-l
ber of leaders are disposed of by the!
skilled noblemen fencers, who challenge
their hated rivals to duels. Novarro suc
ceeds in putting his opponents, including
the marquis, out of the way. During
these scenes the flight of King Louis
XVI is shown, the storming of the
Tuillerics, the mob scene in the streets
of Paris, and the calm disposition of Na
poleon who watched the fray from the 1
sidelines. Marie Antoinette and Robe
spierre are also depicted. The char
acterizations are accurate, as are the his
torical incidents. The play works up to
the climax, hut has an almost cataclysmic
finale. The whole play is dramatic, but
is so well done as not to verge on the
melodramatic. Nothing is shown which
is not logical and could not be a possi
bility. Lewis Stone, playing the part of
the villain, acts as only Stone can. The:
settings are rich, as is the display of
wealth. It is a show well worth seeing
if you want to be kept in suspense |
throughout. The plot is interestingly
complicated and simply worked out. ;

LITTLE OLD NEW YORK—Now-
Playing at the Imperial, San Francisco
Marion Davies is remarkably attractive
in "her role of Patricia O'Day in "Little
York." Her wealthy uncle
leaves all his estate to her brother, Pat
rick, who sails with his sister and father \
from Ireland to America to take pos-l
session. The uncle's adopted son hoped j
to inherit the money, but instead is.!
named guardian. He is a reprobate.
However, Patrick dies on the way
across, but his sister assumes his cos
tume in disguise. She falls in love with
her guardian, who considers her a young
boy. He needs money to give Robert
Fulton for his first steamboat experi- J
ment and places all on a fight to be held |

in the Fire house. The fight scene is
typical of the age, showing the kind of
fighting then used, where a round was
ended when one was knocked down, and
the fight ended when one or the other
couldn't fight any more. The young girl
in disguise rings the fire bell to save her
guardian's man from defeat and her
guardian from the loss of his house,
which he has wagered as his last pos
session. The crowd rushed out, discov
ers the hoax, and the young girl is
forced to reveal her identity when she is
lashed by the infuriated fighter at the
whipping post.
* * *
Several scenes are exceedingly well
done. The first trip of the Clermont, or
"Fulton's Folly," is very well shown with
a boat very like the original, specially
built for the picture. The stocks and
the whipping post are typical of Little
Old New York, as arc the colonial homes
and the equipages and costumes. The
fight scene is clearly one of the times.
The most unnecessary effort to thrill the
audience was to have the girl come to
receive her inheritance about fifteen min
utes before it would revert to her guar
dian. She might just as well have come
two months earlier as far as the picture
was concerned. Vanderbilt and Astor
were among the historical characters de
picted. Fulton and Livingstone, who
once were granted the exclusive water
rights on the Hudson river, were among
the characters. Ttne picture was edu
cational and accuately so, but this fact
lent to the picture instead of taking from
it. You can't see a better picture in the
country for 35 cents, widi such an at
tractive prologue sketch and good, ap
propriate music. No unnecessary ex
planations are made and the plot is al
lowed to work itself out without effort.

Several scenes are exceedingly well
done. The first trip of the Clermont, or
"Fulton's Folly," is very well shown with
a boat very like the original, specially
built for the picture. The stocks and
the whipping post are typical of Little
Old New York, as arc the colonial homes
and the equipages and costumes. The
fight scene is clearly one of the times.
The most unnecessary effort to thrill the
audience was to have the girl come to
receive her inheritance about fifteen min
utes before it would revert to her guar
dian. She might just as well have come
two months earlier as far as the picture
was concerned. Vanderbilt and Astor
were among the historical characters de
picted. Fulton and Livingstone, who
once were granted the exclusive water
rights on the Hudson river, were among
the characters. Ttne picture was edu
cational and accuately so, but this fact
lent to the picture instead of taking from
it. You can't see a better picture in the
country for 35 cents, widi such an at
tractive prologue sketch and good, ap
propriate music. No unnecessary ex
planations are made and the plot is al
lowed to work itself out without effort.
SCARMOUCHE — Now Showing a t
Capitol Theater, San Francisco
Rex Ingram presents a high-priced
picture in a high-class way. Scara
mouche, taken from the novel by Rafael
Sabatini, strikes one as an excellent his
torical drama portraying an age-old
theme, the French RevolutioH ,in an en
tirely new and actionable light. Alice
Terry in the lead is a rich nobleman's
daughter who is in love with the same
nobleman's adopted son, played by
Ramon Novarro. The young fellow,
who is a lawyer, becomes incensed at the
injustice of special license for wrong
granted noblemen. He deserts tlie fold,
especially when his sweetheart receives;
the attentions of his hated rival, a mar
quis, played by Lewis Stone. The lawyer
is wanted by the authorities for his radi
cal speeches and is condemned to hang, i
but he escapes and takes the part of
Scaramouche, a comedian, in a company'
of traveling player?. As the revolution j
ripens he becomes a leader, and when I
the assembly meets he, with Danton and |
Marat, deliver fiery speeches. A num-l
ber of leaders are disposed of by the!
skilled noblemen fencers, who challenge
their hated rivals to duels. Novarro suc
ceeds in putting his opponents, including
the marquis, out of the way. During
these scenes the flight of King Louis
XVI is shown, the storming of the
Tuillerics, the mob scene in the streets
of Paris, and the calm disposition of Na
poleon who watched the fray from the 1
sidelines. Marie Antoinette and Robe
spierre are also depicted. The char
acterizations are accurate, as are the his
torical incidents. The play works up to
the climax, hut has an almost cataclysmic
finale. The whole play is dramatic, but
is so well done as not to verge on the
melodramatic. Nothing is shown which
is not logical and could not be a possi
bility. Lewis Stone, playing the part of
the villain, acts as only Stone can. The:
settings are rich, as is the display of
wealth. It is a show well worth seeing
if you want to be kept in suspense |
throughout. The plot is interestingly
complicated and simply worked out. ;

LITTLE OLD NEW YORK—Now-
Playing at the Imperial, San Francisco
Marion Davies is remarkably attractive
in "her role of Patricia O'Day in "Little
York." Her wealthy uncle
leaves all his estate to her brother, Pat
rick, who sails with his sister and father \
from Ireland to America to take pos-l
session. The uncle's adopted son hoped j
to inherit the money, but instead is.!
named guardian. He is a reprobate.
However, Patrick dies on the way
across, but his sister assumes his cos
tume in disguise. She falls in love with
her guardian, who considers her a young
boy. He needs money to give Robert
Fulton for his first steamboat experi- J
ment and places all on a fight to be held |

in the Fire house. The fight scene is
typical of the age, showing the kind of
fighting then used, where a round was
ended when one was knocked down, and
the fight ended when one or the other
couldn't fight any more. The young girl
in disguise rings the fire bell to save her
guardian's man from defeat and her
guardian from the loss of his house,

the villain, acts as only Stone can. The:
settings are rich, as is the display of
wealth. It is a show well worth seeing
if you want to be kept in suspense |
throughout. The plot is interestingly
complicated and simply worked out. ;

LITTLE OLD NEW YORK—Now-
Playing at the Imperial, San Francisco
Marion Davies is remarkably attractive
in "her role of Patricia O'Day in "Little
York." Her wealthy uncle
leaves all his estate to her brother, Pat
rick, who sails with his sister and father \
from Ireland to America to take pos-l
session. The uncle's adopted son hoped j
to inherit the money, but instead is.!
named guardian. He is a reprobate.
However, Patrick dies on the way
across, but his sister assumes his cos
tume in disguise. She falls in love with
her guardian, who considers her a young
boy. He needs money to give Robert
Fulton for his first steamboat experi- J
ment and places all on a fight to be held |

in the Fire house. The fight scene is
typical of the age, showing the kind of
fighting then used, where a round was
ended when one was knocked down, and
the fight ended when one or the other
couldn't fight any more. The young girl
in disguise rings the fire bell to save her
guardian's man from defeat and her
guardian from the loss of his house,
which he has wagered as his last pos
session. The crowd rushed out, discov
ers the hoax, and the young girl is
forced to reveal her identity when she is
lashed by the infuriated fighter at the
whipping post.
* * *
Several scenes are exceedingly well
done. The first trip of the Clermont, or
"Fulton's Folly," is very well shown with
a boat very like the original, specially
built for the picture. The stocks and
the whipping post are typical of Little
Old New York, as arc the colonial homes
and the equipages and costumes. The
fight scene is clearly one of the times.
The most unnecessary effort to thrill the
audience was to have the girl come to
receive her inheritance about fifteen min
utes before it would revert to her guar
dian. She might just as well have come
two months earlier as far as the picture
was concerned. Vanderbilt and Astor
were among the historical characters de
picted. Fulton and Livingstone, who
once were granted the exclusive water
rights on the Hudson river, were among
the characters. Ttne picture was edu
cational and accuately so, but this fact
lent to the picture instead of taking from
it. You can't see a better picture in the
country for 35 cents, widi such an at
tractive prologue sketch and good, ap
propriate music. No unnecessary ex
planations are made and the plot is al
lowed to work itself out without effort.
SCARMOUCHE — Now Showing a t
Capitol Theater, San Francisco
Rex Ingram presents a high-priced
picture in a high-class way. Scara
mouche, taken from the novel by Rafael
Sabatini, strikes one as an excellent his
torical drama portraying an age-old
theme, the French RevolutioH ,in an en
tirely new and actionable light. Alice
Terry in the lead is a rich nobleman's
daughter who is in love with the same
nobleman's adopted son, played by
Ramon Novarro. The young fellow,
who is a lawyer, becomes incensed at the
injustice of special license for wrong
granted noblemen. He deserts tlie fold,
especially when his sweetheart receives;
the attentions of his hated rival, a mar
quis, played by Lewis Stone. The lawyer
is wanted by the authorities for his radi
cal speeches and is condemned to hang, i
but he escapes and takes the part of
Scaramouche, a comedian, in a company'
of traveling player?. As the revolution j
ripens he becomes a leader, and when I
the assembly meets he, with Danton and |
Marat, deliver fiery speeches. A num-l
ber of leaders are disposed of by the!
skilled noblemen fencers, who challenge
their hated rivals to duels. Novarro suc
ceeds in putting his opponents, including
the marquis, out of the way. During
these scenes the flight of King Louis
XVI is shown, the storming of the
Tuillerics, the mob scene in the streets
of Paris, and the calm disposition of Na
poleon who watched the fray from the 1
sidelines. Marie Antoinette and Robe
spierre are also depicted. The char
acterizations are accurate, as are the his
torical incidents. The play works up to
the climax, hut has an almost cataclysmic
finale. The whole play is dramatic, but
is so well done as not to verge on the
melodramatic. Nothing is shown which
is not logical and could not be a possi
bility. Lewis Stone, playing the part of
the villain, acts as only Stone can. The:
settings are rich, as is the display of
wealth. It is a show well worth seeing
if you want to be kept in suspense |
throughout. The plot is interestingly
complicated and simply worked out. ;
