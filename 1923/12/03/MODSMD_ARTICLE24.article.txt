# Red Cross Christmas Seals Are Put on Sale
## 
### 
The annual Christmas sale of tuber
culosis seals is open. It is hoped by
those In charge of the work on the
campus that each student will buy
at least twenty-five cents worth of the
stamps.
The money derived from the seals
is to be used in this district for the
support of a dental clinic in the pub
lic schools. The clinic has been very
successful and is maintained almost
entirely by the sale of stamps. Seven
ty-five per cent of the proceeds is re
tained for local purposes, while the
remainder goes to the national head
quarters of the Tuberculosis Associa
tion.
From 1910 to 1919 the Red Cross
and the Tuberculosis Association were
allied in the sale of seals. Since that
time the work has been done entirely
by the association. The movement has
been in progress since the Civil War,
when the "charity stamp" helped care
for the wounded soldiers.
Harriet Oliver is general chairman
of the sale at Stanford. Working with
her is a representative from each liv
ing group.
