Who Won the War?
The Rt. Hon. Winston S. Churchill,
in "The World Crisis, 1915," tells what
he would have done to win the war if
someone or other hadn't raised the rent

on him in Downing street. He argues
rather convincingly that the Dardanelles
expedition would have been a success it
what happened hadn't happened, and it
the allies had done what they should have
done instead of what they did. The hook
is Mr. Churchill's apologia, and it prob
ably indicates that he was not one whit
dumber than any one else connected with
the cabinet winning of the war.

Rafael Sabatini has turned his "port
able" from "Scaramouche" and "Captain
Blood" to biography. He has chosen as
his subject the most romantic figure ot
the Italian Renaissance, Cesare Borgia.
We are informed that Mr. Sabatini for
gets a little of the blood and poison
usually connected with Cesare, and gives
a vivid account of that gentleman as a
public benefactor and a patron of the
arts.

"Woman, a Vindication," by Anthom
M. Ludovici (Knopfs), ought to provide
the Wranglers with something to talk
about. The burden of Ludovici's book
is that woman is a perfected mechanic
for the perpetuation of the race and that
all of her actions, whether good or evil,
are but natural expression of the free
exercise or the inhibition of her natural
function.

John Drinkwater, the author ot "Abra
ham Lincoln," is now trying his hand at
synthetic (don't get us wrong on this)
literature. He is following Well's Out
line of History and Thomson's Outline
of Science with an Outline of Literature.
The information we have on hand leads
us to advise Mr. Drinkwater to stick to
drama and leave synthetic production to
the new American aristocracy.
