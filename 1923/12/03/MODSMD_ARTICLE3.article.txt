# GLEE CLUB RETURNS FROM HOLIDAY TRIP
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club returned this
morning from Chico, after its first tour
of the season. The Thanksgiving tour
was taken after only six weeks' prepara
tion, which speaks very well of the chili's
organization, according to Warren D.
Allen, director.
The club left the campus Thursday
morning for Marysville, where they sang
to a large audience in spite of the heavy
rain. Friday night the club sang at
Colusa, and Saturday they went to
Chico, where they were admirably en
tertained.
