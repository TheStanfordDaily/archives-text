that he will be able to take a power
ful aggregation north during the holi
days.
In addition to the trip to Canada,
rugby has added incentive this year
due to the fact that a rugby team
will be selected next spring to repre

interest in rugby has waned but with
the announcement of a possible trip
it seems to be gaining impetus, and
all men now in the University, whether
graduate or undergraduate, can try
for places on the team.
Maloney predicts that he will have
the strongest team that has ever repre
sented Stanford in an international
contest.
Templeton To Go

can always be depended upon to put
the ball out of danger. Templeton has
been to Canada on one of the rugby
trips.
Jim Kelly, Tiny Lynn, George Cary,
A1 Hazletine, and Lefty Rogers are
the outstanding backs. All of these
men were on the last Canadian tour,
and from their past experience should

this Christmas.

Wren have placed before, and Malo
ney is expecting Porky Dwight, Dud
DeGroot, and Dick Hyland to show up
well enough to make the team.

trips.
Jim Kelly, Tiny Lynn, George Cary,
A1 Hazletine, and Lefty Rogers are
the outstanding backs. All of these
men were on the last Canadian tour,
and from their past experience should
be able to make places on the team
this Christmas.
Farish, Marlowe, Campbell, and
Wren have placed before, and Malo
ney is expecting Porky Dwight, Dud
DeGroot, and Dick Hyland to show up
well enough to make the team.
