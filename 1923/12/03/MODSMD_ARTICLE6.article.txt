# PROFESSOR WILLIS TO TELL STORY OF EARTHQUAKE CHASE
## Investigation in Northern Chile Shows Different Type of Temblors 
### 
The greatest danger of earthquakes
is the subsequent fire, in the opinion
of Professor Bailey Wills, professor
emeritus of the Geology department,
who will speak tomorrow evening at
7:30 in the Assembly hall on the sub
ject, "To Chile and Back Chasing an
Earthquake."
Convinced that there is no reason
why people should be afraid of earth
quakes, Professor Willis will explain
in his talk how to avoid danger. "Safe
houses are possible," he says, "even
without building them expensively. If
people would build their homes of
fireproof material half the danger
would disappear."
Studied Earthquakes in Chili
Professor Willis went to Chile last
year to study the earthquake of No
vember 10, 1922, which shook all
northern Chile. This earthquake was
much more extensive than the recent
one in Japan. An area of 300,000
square miles was shaken by the
Chilean earthquake, while the Japan
quake shook not more than 50,000
square miles.
"It was very unfortunate," said Pro
fessor Willis, "that while I was catch
ing a big one, a little one got away and
attacked Japan. Earthquakes are dif
ficult things to hunt since they exist
chefly deep under the ground."
