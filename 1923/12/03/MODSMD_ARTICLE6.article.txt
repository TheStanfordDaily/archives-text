# PROFESSOR WILLIS TO TELL STORY OF EARTHQUAKE CHASE
## Investigation in Northern Chile Shows Different Type of Temblors 
### 
The greatest danger of earthquakes
is the subsequent fire, in the opinion
of Professor Bailey Wills, professor
emeritus of the Geology department,
who will speak tomorrow evening at
7:30 in the Assembly hall on the sub
ject, "To Chile and Back Chasing an
Earthquake."
Convinced that there is no reason
why people should be afraid of earth
quakes, Professor Willis will explain
in his talk how to avoid danger. "Safe
houses are possible," he says, "even
without building them expensively. If
people would build their homes of
fireproof material half the danger
would disappear."
Studied Earthquakes in Chili
Professor Willis went to Chile last
year to study the earthquake of No
vember 10, 1922, which shook all
northern Chile. This earthquake was
much more extensive than the recent
one in Japan. An area of 300,000
square miles was shaken by the
Chilean earthquake, while the Japan
quake shook not more than 50,000
square miles.
"It was very unfortunate," said Pro
fessor Willis, "that while I was catch
ing a big one, a little one got away and
attacked Japan. Earthquakes are dif
ficult things to hunt since they exist
chefly deep under the ground."
Compared Wth Local Quakes
One of the objects of Profssor
Willis' trip to South America was to
compae the Californian earthquakes
with the Chilean variety. He reports
quite a difference in the types found
in these two places. Those of Cali
fornia come straight up along a verti
cal fault plane. Professor Willis looked
for the same conditions in Chile but
could not find them. It was only after
several months' work exploring in the
Andes that he discovered a big flat
fault plane which underlies the moun
tain range in which the movements
occur.
In his lecture tomorrow evening

Professor Willis will attempt to ex
plain the causes of these phenomena.
He will illustrate his talk with slides
of scenes on the trip, together with
views taken in the desert region of
Chile and the oases where towns were
wrecked. The slides will include pic
tures of Rio de Janeiro and the har
bor.
Journey Covers 20,000 Miles
Professor Willis made a journey of
20,000 miles which included 1,000 miles
on horseback in the Andes. He visited
the Volcanic Islands 500 miles off the
Chilean coast. His route passed
through the tropics into deserts where
the nitrate fields are located, and up
into the snowy heights of the Andes,
and back across the pampas of Argen
tina.

one in Japan. An area of 300,000
square miles was shaken by the
Chilean earthquake, while the Japan
quake shook not more than 50,000
square miles.
"It was very unfortunate," said Pro
fessor Willis, "that while I was catch
ing a big one, a little one got away and
attacked Japan. Earthquakes are dif
ficult things to hunt since they exist
chefly deep under the ground."
Compared Wth Local Quakes
One of the objects of Profssor
Willis' trip to South America was to
compae the Californian earthquakes
with the Chilean variety. He reports
quite a difference in the types found
in these two places. Those of Cali
fornia come straight up along a verti
cal fault plane. Professor Willis looked
for the same conditions in Chile but
could not find them. It was only after
several months' work exploring in the
Andes that he discovered a big flat
fault plane which underlies the moun
tain range in which the movements
occur.
In his lecture tomorrow evening

Professor Willis will attempt to ex
plain the causes of these phenomena.
He will illustrate his talk with slides
of scenes on the trip, together with
views taken in the desert region of
Chile and the oases where towns were
wrecked. The slides will include pic
tures of Rio de Janeiro and the har
bor.
Journey Covers 20,000 Miles
Professor Willis made a journey of
20,000 miles which included 1,000 miles
on horseback in the Andes. He visited
the Volcanic Islands 500 miles off the
Chilean coast. His route passed
through the tropics into deserts where
the nitrate fields are located, and up
into the snowy heights of the Andes,
and back across the pampas of Argen
tina.
The greatest danger of earthquakes
is the subsequent fire, in the opinion
of Professor Bailey Wills, professor
emeritus of the Geology department,
who will speak tomorrow evening at
7:30 in the Assembly hall on the sub
ject, "To Chile and Back Chasing an
Earthquake."
Convinced that there is no reason
why people should be afraid of earth
quakes, Professor Willis will explain
in his talk how to avoid danger. "Safe
houses are possible," he says, "even
without building them expensively. If
people would build their homes of
fireproof material half the danger
would disappear."
Studied Earthquakes in Chili
Professor Willis went to Chile last
year to study the earthquake of No
vember 10, 1922, which shook all
northern Chile. This earthquake was
much more extensive than the recent
one in Japan. An area of 300,000
square miles was shaken by the
Chilean earthquake, while the Japan
quake shook not more than 50,000
square miles.
"It was very unfortunate," said Pro
fessor Willis, "that while I was catch
ing a big one, a little one got away and
attacked Japan. Earthquakes are dif
ficult things to hunt since they exist
chefly deep under the ground."
