# FRESHMEN DEFEAT DE MOLAY ELEVEN BY SCORE OF 5â€”0
## 
### 
Playing a fast offensive game, the
Stanford freshman soccer team downed
the De Molay eleven from San Fran
cisco by the score of 5-0 last Saturday.
This was a scheduled contest in Section
2 of the University and Club Soccer
League. The Varsity-Italia Virtus game
was forfeited to the Cardinal players]
when the Italians did not arrive to play. |
The freshmen had the ball in the De 1
Molay territory throughout the contest, i
Although they entered the game with a 1
crippled line-up, the babes showed good,
teamwork and were never in danger of!
being headed. Miron at center forward
accounted for two of the goals and was l
one of the most consistent players. j
Strong, playing inside left, made the'
third goal. Not content with allowing j
the freshmen three goals, the De Molavsj
scored two for the babes. One came j
when Baird, the De Molay goalkeeper, l
caught the ball on the wrong side of his i
foot and rolled it back in the goal in-'
stead of out on the field. The yearlings;
then worked the ball up near the goal.;
and in an effort to kick it back one of the
De Molay men knocked it into the Stan-'
ford goal.
