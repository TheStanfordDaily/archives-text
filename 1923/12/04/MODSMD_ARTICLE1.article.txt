# CARDINAL POLO TEAM TO MEET PRESIDIO FOUR
## Redshirted Riders Favorites In Return Match With Thirteenth Infantry 
### 
By virtue of winning the Pacific
Coast intercollegiate title against Ore
gon Agricultural College last Satur
day, the Stanford Polo team will be
heavy favorites against the 30th In
fantry four when the two teams meet
in a two-game series tomorrow and
Saturday on the highway polo field.
Both games will start at 2:30.
It is expected that the army men
will put up a much stronger game
than when previously played. They
have strengthened their line-up con
siderably by moving Captain Scott,
their star player, up from number 4
position to number 2, where his par
ticular style of playing will be of
greater advantage to the team. The
older army men met defeat at the
hands of the Cardinal team on No
vember 14 and 16 by the scores of
11-5 and 10-5 in two games played at
the Presidio, and have been practic
ing since with revenge in their hearts.
Game Should Be Even
However, the game will be an even
toss. The Stanford team will have bet
ter and faster horses than they have
had before. In previous games held at
Stanford, the troop of horses had to
be split, half going to the visiting
team which meant fewer good horses
to pick from. The Presidio team is
sending their own horses down by
trucks which will arrive this after
noon. Otto Barby, captain of the Stan
ford team, will probably get to play at
some time during the game, according
to Captain Boyle, polo coach. Barby
has been unable to ride much this sea
son due to injuries, and his presence
in the line-up will materially strength
en the team.
Stanford eSason Successful
The Stanford four has had a very
successful season so far. defeating the
Berkeley Polo Club 11-2, the Santa
Cruz Polo Club 5-4, but was forced to
take a defeat on the next game 4-5,
the only game Stanford has lost so
far. As previously stated, the 30th In
fantry met defeat 10>-5 and 11-5, and
O. A. C. in a three-game series, was
walloped to the tunes of 10-4. 8-3, 8-4.
The Palo Alto Polo Club also fell be
fore Stanford by the scores of 6-4, 4-3.
The Wednesday game will be free
but an admission charge of 25 cents
with A. S. S. U. cards or 50 cents alone i
will be charged.
The line-up will probably be:
Presidio Stanford
Edgar 1 Tremaine, or
O. Barby
Scott 2 Irwin j
Beatty 3 R. Barby j
Weaver 4 Lamb 1
