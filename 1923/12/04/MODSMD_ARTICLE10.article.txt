# SEAT SALE FOR SOPHOMORE PLAY STARTS TOMORROW
## All Costumes Are on Hand; Davis Will Hold Two Dress Rehearsals 
### 
Scats for "Captain Applejack," the
1926 sophomore play, to be presented in
the Assembly Hall Friday night, will go
on sale at the Administration building
and at Crandall's in Palo Alto at 1
1 o'clock tomorrow. Prices are $1 anc'l
$1.25. After the sale Wednesday tickets
| may be secured from the alumni secre
j tary's office upstairs in the Administra
tion building at any time until Friday
evening. Faculty members may also pur
chase their seats at this office after 1
o'clock Wednesday.
As all costumes for the production are
on hand, Davis intends to hold two full
dress rehearsals, the first on Wednesday
night, and the second Thursday.
According to dramatic reports from
London, the play was the most exciting
and gripping, as well as successful show
that was produced at its time on a Lon
don stage. American producers tried
every means to get the production rights
for this country, but Walter Eddinger
was the only one to succeed. He pro
duced "Captain Applejack" in New York
with more than ordinary results, for the
play only completed its run there last
year, after several hundred perform
ances. i
Gordon Davis secured the college
rights through special connections with
the owner, and Stanford is the first col
lege to present the play. It is also being
shown in moving pictures as "Strangers
of the Night."
A lonely estate on the Cornish shores
is the setting of the first act. Ambrose
Applejohn is discovered leading a very
ordinary existence, but this life does not
last long after the curtain rises. A troup
of mysterious strangers enter his home
in the dead of night and there the excite
ment commences, which holds the audi
ence until the final crush.
The second act is a flashback to the
days of wooden-legged pirates and the
robber ship of Captain Applejack.
Mutiny, attempted murder, a royal bat
tle and a touch of romance keep this
scene at the highest pitch of intensity
with a series of unexpected thrills.
Act three goes back to the setting of
the first act, adds more mystery and
complications until with one crash light
breaks through, everything is cleared up,
and Ambrose Applejohn is not much
worse off for his thrilling experiences.

don stage. American producers tried
every means to get the production rights
for this country, but Walter Eddinger
was the only one to succeed. He pro
duced "Captain Applejack" in New York
with more than ordinary results, for the
play only completed its run there last
year, after several hundred perform
ances. i
Gordon Davis secured the college
rights through special connections with
the owner, and Stanford is the first col
lege to present the play. It is also being
shown in moving pictures as "Strangers
of the Night."
A lonely estate on the Cornish shores
is the setting of the first act. Ambrose
Applejohn is discovered leading a very
ordinary existence, but this life does not
last long after the curtain rises. A troup
of mysterious strangers enter his home
in the dead of night and there the excite
ment commences, which holds the audi
ence until the final crush.
The second act is a flashback to the
days of wooden-legged pirates and the
robber ship of Captain Applejack.
Mutiny, attempted murder, a royal bat
tle and a touch of romance keep this
scene at the highest pitch of intensity
with a series of unexpected thrills.
Act three goes back to the setting of
the first act, adds more mystery and
complications until with one crash light
breaks through, everything is cleared up,
and Ambrose Applejohn is not much
worse off for his thrilling experiences.
