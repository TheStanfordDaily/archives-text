# BRANDSTEN TO COACH U. S. DIVING TEAM FOR OLYMPIC GAMES
## 
### 
Ernie Bransten, Stanford swim
ming mentor, has been selected as the
coach for the American diving team
at the Olympic games. It is possible
that he will also be appointed coach
for American water polo.
America's comparatively poor show
ing in the latter sport at the last
Olympic games was due largely to
poor coaching, according to Brand
sten. The team lost to both England
and Belgium.
Brandsten has not yet been defi
nitely approached on the matter as
yet, but by virtue of the excellent
teams he has turned out at Stanford
during the last few years, it is not
unlikely that he will receive the ap
pointment.
