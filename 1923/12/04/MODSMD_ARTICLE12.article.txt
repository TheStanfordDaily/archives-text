# Art Terms Are Discussed And Defined By Director John Lenos
## 
### 
"Cubistic, futuristic, impressionistic, J
and similar terms arc often the cause of
much confusion to persons who are in
terested in art, but who have never
studied it personally," says John T.
Lemos, director of the Stanford Art!
Gallery.
"So many schools of art have come
and gone in reccnt years that it is diffi
cult to keep track of them all. It was
not so many years ago that all artists
painted in what is known as the 'realis
tic' style. These paintings were as close
an imitation of Nature as possible, down
to the most minute detail. Every blade
of grass and every nail in a picket fence)
were almost individually represented.
"Artists and art lovers complained I
that such pictures lacked spirit and in
spiration. A good camera could do the
work of many artists, they argued. Soon
the 'impressionistic' type developed.
"Jn this new type, the artist sought to
put the impression of light and atmos
phere into his painting. All the objects
in the composition were painted in
broken bits of light rather than in map
like areas of different colors. This
method became known as 'vibration,' and
is much used by modern artists. Bril
liant spots of blue and red painted next

to one another become fused into a soft
purple when viewed at a short distance,
and likewise with other arrangements of
color. This method gives to the im
pressionistic type a sensation of spirit
and color impossible to obtain by the |
old method.
"Before impressionism had been in!
vogue long, artists argued that a good
painting should not be held down to a
representation of nature, but should be
allowed the same freedom that is given!
poetry. As a result, such schools as the
'cubistic* and 'futuristic' sprang into ex
istence.
" I he cubist paints everything in planes, j
since he believes all subjects around him
are composed of tlat surfaces. In the 1
cubistic drawings one finds many flat
areas painted next to each other to pro-!
duce optical effects. It takes imagina
tion to catch the spirit of a cubistic!
painting. Due to this, most observers j
dubbed the 'Nude Descending the Stairs'
as an explosion of a shingle factory.
"The 'futurist' was so called because
he claimed to be the artist of the future.
He believes in recording on canvas his
reaction from the life about him. He
does not restrict his efforts to recording
only things that he sees, but he also in
cludes the mental reaction from sounds
and similar sensations. If he is painting
a factory scene he is more apt to include
a series of jazzy daubs indicating the
toot of the factory whistle than he is to
paint the trees that may be growing on
the front lawn.
"An artist once compared the various
schools in this way. A group of artists
spend an evening in a cafe. The realist,
if asked to paint the place, will make a
faithful representation of everything,
while the impressionistic painting will be
one viewed from the standpoint of play
of color and general effect.
"The cubist will paint rectangular
patches of white, black, orange, and red
showing in a somewhat airplaine view
the main areas of the cafe. The futurist
paints anything that comes into his mind
as a reaction from the evening; spurts
of red and yellow for the lights, blotches
of white for the tables, circular dahbs
of varied colors to represent the orches
tra music, and possibly some pale green
spots to indicate the morning after."

not so many years ago that all artists
painted in what is known as the 'realis
tic' style. These paintings were as close
an imitation of Nature as possible, down
to the most minute detail. Every blade
of grass and every nail in a picket fence)
were almost individually represented.
"Artists and art lovers complained I
that such pictures lacked spirit and in
spiration. A good camera could do the
work of many artists, they argued. Soon
the 'impressionistic' type developed.
"Jn this new type, the artist sought to
put the impression of light and atmos
phere into his painting. All the objects
in the composition were painted in
broken bits of light rather than in map
like areas of different colors. This
method became known as 'vibration,' and
is much used by modern artists. Bril
liant spots of blue and red painted next

to one another become fused into a soft
purple when viewed at a short distance,
and likewise with other arrangements of
color. This method gives to the im
pressionistic type a sensation of spirit
and color impossible to obtain by the |
old method.
"Before impressionism had been in!
vogue long, artists argued that a good
painting should not be held down to a
representation of nature, but should be
allowed the same freedom that is given!
poetry. As a result, such schools as the
'cubistic* and 'futuristic' sprang into ex
istence.
" I he cubist paints everything in planes, j
since he believes all subjects around him
are composed of tlat surfaces. In the 1
cubistic drawings one finds many flat
areas painted next to each other to pro-!
duce optical effects. It takes imagina
tion to catch the spirit of a cubistic!
painting. Due to this, most observers j
dubbed the 'Nude Descending the Stairs'
as an explosion of a shingle factory.
"The 'futurist' was so called because
he claimed to be the artist of the future.
He believes in recording on canvas his
reaction from the life about him. He
does not restrict his efforts to recording
only things that he sees, but he also in
cludes the mental reaction from sounds
and similar sensations. If he is painting
a factory scene he is more apt to include
a series of jazzy daubs indicating the
toot of the factory whistle than he is to
paint the trees that may be growing on
the front lawn.
"An artist once compared the various
schools in this way. A group of artists
spend an evening in a cafe. The realist,
if asked to paint the place, will make a
faithful representation of everything,
while the impressionistic painting will be
one viewed from the standpoint of play
of color and general effect.
"The cubist will paint rectangular
patches of white, black, orange, and red
showing in a somewhat airplaine view
the main areas of the cafe. The futurist
paints anything that comes into his mind
as a reaction from the evening; spurts
of red and yellow for the lights, blotches
of white for the tables, circular dahbs
of varied colors to represent the orches
tra music, and possibly some pale green
spots to indicate the morning after."
"Cubistic, futuristic, impressionistic, J
and similar terms arc often the cause of
much confusion to persons who are in
terested in art, but who have never
studied it personally," says John T.
Lemos, director of the Stanford Art!
Gallery.
