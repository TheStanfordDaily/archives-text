# DON'T ROCK THE BOAT PLEADS SPEAKER ON U. S. CONSTITUTION
##

"Don't rock the boat. Keep her;
steady. She has stood the test of time.
and shown herself seaworthy, though she
is not as beautifully painted as some
others."
This was the plea for the United j
States constitution made by Miss Her-J
mine Sclnved, field secretary of the Na-|
tional Association for Constitutional i
Government, who spoke this '
before the American History class on j
"Men Who Made the Constitution."
Miss Schwed considers the American j
Socialist much more dangerous than the
foreign, for the latter at, least works in
the open. However, Emma Goldman and j
her followers study the constitution so
that they can pick flaws in it.
After studying the constitution her
self, Miss Schwed found that it protects
the workingman, despite the accusations
of the radicals. She brought a warning
to the students of today, who will be the
voters of tomorrow, not to he fooled |
about their instrument of government.
The speaker was formerly influenced
by clever radicals and almost believed
their teaching that the constitution was
out of date. She read Karl Marx and
nearly became a Socialist. However, not
understanding her own government or
its teachings, she did not join.
