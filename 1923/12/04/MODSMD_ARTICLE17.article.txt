# SLIDES Will BE SHOWN IN TALK ON EARTHQUAKES
## Professor Willis to Explain Results of Study in South America 
### 
Lantern slides of South American
scenes, including Rio de Janeiro, and
many of the towns of Chile which
were wrecked by the earthquake last
year, will illustrate the lecture to be
given by Professor Bailey Willis, of
the Geology department, on the sub
ject of the Chilean temblor. The talk
will be given this evening at 7:30 in
the Assembly hall.
Professor Willis compared the study
of the earthquake to a hunt for big
game. "Big game chasing always has
the fascination of the unexpected," he
explained, "and in this respect the
earthquake search was very success
ful."
In his lecture this evening, Profes
sor Willis will explain the differences
between the California temblors and
those of Chile, which he found to have
a horizontal fault plane instead of the
vertical plane of the local earth
quakes.
In addition to describing the results
of his study in South America, Profes
sor Willis will give suggestions for
building homes in such a way that
the chief danger from earthquakes
and fire will be practically eliminated.
It is his belief that this is possible
without great expense, and if the
people of California would make their
homes safe, they would have nothing
to fear from the occasional temblors.
