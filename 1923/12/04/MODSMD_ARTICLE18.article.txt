# CLUBHOUSE RECEIVES $260 OUT OF $5,000 BOOKSTORE REBATES
## 
### 
The Women's Clubhouse received a
little over $260 in rebates from the
Stanford Bookstore this fall. The total
amount refunded to all organizations
exceeded $5000.
"The Clubhouse belongs to the stu
dents of the University and it is used
by the large majority of them. It is
in no sense merely for the women, in
spite of its name," said Mrs. E. R.
Ewell, who is in charge of the build
ing.
"The men use it almost as much as
the women, for meetings, practicing,
and studying. We are always glad to
have them and hope that they feel free
to come."
"But we wish they would remember
the clubhouse debt when disposing of
their rebate slips. The debt is still
large and even the interest is not a
small sum to pay. If the students, and
particularly the men, who are most
! numerous, would remember the club
house box in the bookstore I am sure
| that the debt would soon be paid."
I ""The rebate plan was inaugurated in
! 1913. It has been in operation every
I year since, with one exception, when
1 there were no profits. For the last
three years the amount refunded has
i been ten per cent of the original pur
' chase. The rebate is based on the
amount of profit for the year.
