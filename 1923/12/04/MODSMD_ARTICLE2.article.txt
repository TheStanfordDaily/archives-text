# CIVILIZATION GOES IF PEACE DOES NOT COMEâ€”DR. McCALL
## 
### 
Mankind must be turned from can
nibalism to fraternalism and peace be
fore civilization is safe. This was the
opinion expressed by Dr. Oswald W.
S. McCall who spoke last nght in the
Memorial Church on "World-Peace or
Downfall!"
There are four great forces which
work with war for the downfall of
civilization, according to Dr. McCall.
First, the mechanical destruction of
strife is enormous. Second, the edu
cational system decays while wealth
is being lavished on warlike enter
prises. And poverty, with its resulting
misery, often leads to revolution.
Also, war is a great moral crime.
"Civilization exists in the mind or
not at all. It is not a matter of ex
ternals. If the mind is darkened, of
what avail will be our navies, our
literature, our art?"
"War is the master crime of our
time. Formerly it could be conducted
as a sort of sideshow, but now its lash
falls upon the heads of all. This must
be realized and war outlawed."
Revolution may come and bring with
it a new social order, but this regime
must make for the cessation of war
fare or civilization will be lost. Im
partial but daring judgment and enter
prise are most needed today.
Dr. McCall places the world at the
crossroads, in a position to make its
most momentous decision. He com
pared its situation with that depicted
in a famous painting, the "Last
Chance," where a mortal gambles with
the devil for his soul. It was suggested
that the picture should be called
"Check-Mate."
