# POST-SEASON FOOTBALL

### 
The Pacific Coast Conference, meeting at Berkeley on Friday, ex
pects to have a miniature Fourth of July celebration when the fuse is
touched to the post-season game question. Several members of the con
ference are set against any Christmas or New Year's college football
spectacle. They believe, and rightly, that the extra training and danger
to the grades of the players does not warrant the publicity.
However, the Coast Conference has, in the past few years, assumed
to have control over the private affairs of colleges in the body which
could not be entirely justified. It is the belief of the Daily Palo Alto
that Stanford's position on the coming issue, as expressed in another part
of the paper today, is the only tenable stand for an institution that believes
in each college having free right to conduct its own affairs.
The only possibl'e regulation which the conference could make with
any justice would be to prevent any college taking part in a so-called
"East-West" game from assuming itself to be the representative of the
Pacific Coast. a.
