It is to be observed that a great many of the people whose regular
attendance at classes is a source of pride to them and of despair to normal
beings carry notebooks of almost complete disintegration. These models
of student erudition are constantly losing pages, such is the size of their
notebooks. These, when retrieved, are jammed back into whatever por
tion of the folder looks as if it would hold an extra page.
Such students are also to be observed using quarts of ink in taking
notes. Whatever the lecturer says goes down on paper; if it's interest
ing, it is verbatim; if it has no bearing on the subject, it is taken down
anyway, just to be on the safe side.
The best part of the observation of such student encyclopedias is
to set the grades they receive as the result of their work. When you ask
them al)out it, they say: "Well, it was in my notes somewhere, but I for
get what is said."
The truth of the matter is that two-thirds of the scrawls on every
course are of no more value to the student than so many cobwebs
hindering the view out a library window.
