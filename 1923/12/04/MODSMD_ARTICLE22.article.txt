# STOP THIEF!

The artist in charge of putting out posters advertising the seat sale
for "Captain Applejack," thinking to put out some cards having a real
attraction to the eye, spent eight hours on Sunday designing seven
posters for the occasion. On Monday morning he put them up.
On Monday night he went around to see how they looked, and found
none. So well done were they that people with collegiate ideas on the
decoration of upoms had taken them from their places for their own
private uses.
The artist, who is a busy man besides, arrived at the office of the
Daily Palo Alto early this morning ,and between bursts of rage an
nounced that he would be willing to design some more posters at a
nominal cost for those who are really interests in mural decoration.
He suggested further that if the students put their names on the posters
and return them, they may have them back again after Wednesday night.
This was hardly thought possible, however, as people who make a prac
tice of such stealing undoubtedly would not want their names published,
for fear they would be hounded by the authorities for the return of
reserve books, notes, dope sheets for use in examinations, and similar
articles acquired by those without moral responsibility.
