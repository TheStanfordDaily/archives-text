# WHAT TO GET
## (Not How To Pay For It) 
### 
1. Something nice for the roommate—say a pair of padlocks for the
closet and.bureau drawer; or a bunch of clothes labels with your name
stamped on plainly. Especially valuable for tux's and neckties.
2. A little tid-bit for the house manager—three tubes of hydro
chloric acid, marked "X X X" on the outside.
2. Something for your professor to remember you by. A shot
gun or bear trap always does nicely if given in the proper way.
4. For the "best" girl: Three bottles of ink, a f-ew postage
stamps, and one gross of compacts. Distribution of the latter to
be spread out over the year, one after each "party."
5. For yourself—a handsome glass mirror.
