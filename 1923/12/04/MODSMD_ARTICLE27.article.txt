Red-gold autumn leaves
in gentle tail-spins;
a meteor's hissing
track across the night;
the forest patriarch's
booming fall; withering
cornflowers on the stalk;
last soundings of a
symphonyâ€”all these are
deaths . . . but deaths
that live and die again
with each fresh tree,
day, flower, or resonant
string ... in the tireless
cycle.
Men also are dying always.
Thousands of them. And
their passing may be as
silent as the dropping
of leaves, or as heraldric
as a giant tree's fall.
Hosts of men are born
With every leap of time.
New bodies, and a soul
for each. But the
crumbling earth of each
man snuffs out forever
the inner Flame, the
unshared genius, that
is never duplicated.
