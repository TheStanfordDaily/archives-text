San Francisco Symphony Concert
The Sunday afternoon concert of
the San Francisco Symphonj present
ed Rachmanioff's Symphony No. 2, in
E minor, as its major offering, a so
norous and rich work suggestive of
Wagner but with modern harmonies
that even Wagner would not have at
tempted. The Adagio is especially
charming.
For the second part of the program
there was Arensky's graceful and me
lodious variations 011 a theme of
Tchaikowsky, for String Orchestra
only, and the Lalo F minor Concerto
for the violin, with Mr. Persinger as
soloist. Mr. Persinger was using a
famous Guarnerius violin, the "Scot
tish Joseph," loaned by Mr. J. A. Og
den of Johnstown, Pa., who is passing
the winter in San Francisco. The in
strument has tonal quality of great
beauty, well suited to the brilliant and
delicate style of the performer.
