# Organ Recital
## 
### 
Mendelssohn's "Sonata in D minor"
was the first number of the organ recital
played by Warren D. Allen this after
noon at the Memorial Church.
organ sonatas form
a link between the music of Bach's day
and the organ works of modern times.
They are classic in form, romantic in
sentiment, and paved the way for mod
ern organ technique. In this sonata there
are four well-contrasted variations on
the beautiful Chorale, and the Fugue is
based upon the opening and closing
measures of the tune.
"Roulade," by Seth Bingham, was a
joyous conception by one of the profes
sors of music at Yale University.
"Cradle Song" and "March of the
Coventers," by Hailing, completed the
program. The last number is based on
the Psalm tune, "Culross," a typical ex
ample of the psalmody of the ancient
Scottish Kirk. The tune on its first
entry .in the middle section is heard
pianissimo suggesting the Coventers'
worship on the hillside, as heard from
a distance. After the recurrence of the
march theme, the tune reappears, played
on the full organ. Mr. Hailing is a
noted organist of Edinburgh, Scotland.
