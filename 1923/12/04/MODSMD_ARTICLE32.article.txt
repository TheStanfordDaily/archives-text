# TICK TOCKS

### 
Bookman's Monthly Score for this
month intrigues us. We wonder what it
is all about, for in a single month Harold
Bell Wright's "The Mine With an Iron
Door" and Gene Stratton Porter's "The
White Flag" have far outstripped, in
popular demand, Willa Cather's "One of
Ours" and Zona Gales' "Faint Perfume."
While in general literature "Etiquette,"
by Emily Post, is more in demand than
"The Mind in the Making" or Up
Stream," by Lewisohn. Perhaps we were
more intelligent when we were a child.
We read Harold then. Now we prefer
Zona and Willa.
