# SORORITY SYSTEM SCORED
## Women Should Not Subordinate University Believes Social Hygiene Expert 
### 
Because women are divided into
sorority groups, instead of standing as
a unit for a university, was the one
criticism of Dr. Edith Swift, of the
American Social Hygiene Association,
who recently gave four lectures on
the campus.
"The University is the big and per
manent thing in the life of the stu
dent and it should be first," said Dr.
Swift. "There are so few of you here
that it seems sad to me that there are
any divisions. Every woman who
passes the entrance requirements is
worthy of the friendship of every
other woman without any artificial
barriers."
Stanford Women Fortunate
"Stanford women are unusually for
tunate, even among college women,
and I only wish that there were more
of you to enjoy and profit by this
wonderful University. The setting
here is perfect and must be an in
spiration to every student."
Dr. Swift suggested a plan of action
which might be followed by each
member of the "500." First, each Stan
ford woman must find some philan
thropically inclined person who is de-

Hirous of a way to dispose of his
money. This individual must be per
suaded that the best place for about
$10,000 is here at Stanford. If this sug
gestion were followed, it would soon
be possible to have more women here.
Naturalness Impressive
Dr. Swift was impressed by the na
turalness of the women here. She
heartily approved of their sensible
mode of dressing and remarked par
ticularly upon the lack of cosmetics.
"Their complexions are their own and
not Hudnut's," she said.
One of her present problems is
where she shall send her two daugh
ters to college. After the stay here,
she is seriously considering sending
them for two years to her own Alma
Mater, Radcliffe, and two years to
Stanford.
Dr. Swift received her A.B. at Rad
cliffe and her master's at Johns Hop
kins. She also studied in Germany
and practiced medicine for ten years
in Boston.
Since she has been lecturing, she
has visited universities in all the
states of the union. From here she
goes to Southern California, visiting
Pomona and Redlands.

be possible to have more women here.
Naturalness Impressive
Dr. Swift was impressed by the na
turalness of the women here. She
heartily approved of their sensible
mode of dressing and remarked par
ticularly upon the lack of cosmetics.
"Their complexions are their own and
not Hudnut's," she said.
One of her present problems is
where she shall send her two daugh
ters to college. After the stay here,
she is seriously considering sending
them for two years to her own Alma
Mater, Radcliffe, and two years to
Stanford.
Dr. Swift received her A.B. at Rad
cliffe and her master's at Johns Hop
kins. She also studied in Germany
and practiced medicine for ten years
in Boston.
Since she has been lecturing, she
has visited universities in all the
states of the union. From here she
goes to Southern California, visiting
Pomona and Redlands.
