# Edward A. Ross Publishes Brief Text on Sociology
## 
### 
"Outlines of Sociology" by Edward
A. Ross, professor of sociology at
Stanford 1893 to 1900, is among the
recent publications on the new book
shelf in the library. The new work is
a brief revision of Ross's "Principles
of Sociology," and is intended for a
college text.
"Clio and the Chateau de Vaux-le-
Vicomte," by Anatole France has just
been received in translation. The vol
ume includes five short stories and a
description of the Chateau de Vaux-le-
Vicomte, built under Louis XIV by
Nicholas Foucquet, attorney-general of
the Paris parliament.
H. J. Chaytor, fellow of St. Cathe
rine's College, Cambridge, opens a new
field in "The Troubadours and Eng
land." He discusses conditions under
which the English lyric was evolved,
the influence of the professional min
strels; the French names and forms;
medieval Latin poetry, and Provincial
lyric poetry on English lyric poetry.
The latter is especially apparent in
the construction of the stanza and the
distribution of rhymes.
An old volume of "Servian Popular
Poetry," translated by John Bowring
i n1827 is also among the recent acqui
sitions of the library.
