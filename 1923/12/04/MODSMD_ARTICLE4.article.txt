# CARDS, BEARS MEET THURSDAY IN ANNUAL CROSS COUNTRY RUN
## 
### 
The annual Stanford-California cross
country meet will be run Thursday at 4
o'clock over the Stanford course. It was
originally planned to hold the meet last
Saturday, but due to the fact that many
of the Bruin harriers were away over
the holidays, the California officials re
quested that it be postponed for a week.
The race will begin and end at the old
track oval.
Coach "Dink" Templeton's squad of
runners is headed by Captain Hayes, and
includes Paul Murphy, who placed sec
ond in the meet last year; Allan Charles,
who was the first Stanford man to finish
in the Olympic Club meet, and Bill Kerr,
distance star of the Class of 1926. The
time over the course has been reduced
during the past three weeks, and Temple
ton hopes to avenge the 1922 defeat at
the hands of the Bear squad.
A1 Smith and Paul Murphy finished
first and second last year, but California
men took the majority of points between
second and eighth jiJaces.
The Stanford runners who will face
the tape are Captain Hayes, Kerr, Clif
ford, Smith, Murphy, Cypher, Thayer,
Charles, Swain, and Daly.
