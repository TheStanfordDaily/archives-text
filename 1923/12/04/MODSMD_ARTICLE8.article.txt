# STANFORD NOT TO PROTEST NAVY-WASHINGTON GAME
## Post Season Games Arranged Under Conference Rules Favored by Barrow 
### 
"Stanford will not enter a protest
on the Washington-Navy game in
Pasadena," says Dr. W. H. Barrow,
official representative for Stanford in
the Pacific Coast Conference. "Our
attitude is that of an interested on
looker, wondering how Washington's
action can be reconciled with the Con
ference ruling that definitely prohi
bits post-season games promoted or
managed by other than college au
thorities."
Stanford is in favor of post-season
games when they are arranged accord
ing to Conference rulings, played on
college grounds, according to Barrow.
When the Conference meets in
Berkeley next Friday and Saturday,
the post-season game question will
probably be discussed. However,
Graduate Manager Paul Davis, who
will attend all sessions of the Con
ference, anticipates no trouble. "Stan
ford's attitude is that of the Con
ference," says Davis.
Delegates from eight colleges will
be represented at the Conference â€”
California, Stanford, University of
Southern California, Washington, Ore
gon, Oregon Agricultural College,
Washington State, and Idaho.
California is said to be leading the
fight against any member of the Con
ference participating in a post season
game, desiring a resolution similar to
that of Harvard, Princeton, and Yale,
forbidding any games after the Satur
day preceding Thanksgiving Day. The
Big Ten in the Middle West has a
similar agreement.
If such an agreement is carried out,
there will be no more holiday football
games in Pasadena and Los Angeles.
However, several members of the
Conference favoring post-season
games, at least when aranged under
the conditions now included in Con
ference rulings, may make the coming
session a lively and interesting one.
