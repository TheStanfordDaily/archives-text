# JOURNALISTS PLAN STATE-WIDE HIGH SCHOOL CONCLAVE
## Sigma Delta Chi Will Meet Editors, Managers Here In Spring Quarter 
### 
Plans for a state -wide convention of
high-school editors and managers, to be
held at Stanford the first of the spring
quarter, were adopted last night at a
meeting of the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, national- professional
journalistic society. The meeting, held
at the Phi Delta Theta house, was pre
ceded by initiation ceremonies. The fol
lowing five men were admitted to mem
bership: Allan Charles, William Gage,
Edward Landels, John Marble, and
Henry Mack.
Conventions Succeed in East
The convention of high school jour
nalists will be the first move of its kind
to be made by any university in the
state. The fundamentals of the idea are
patterned after the plans worked out
and employed successfully by many East
ern universities. At present there is no
state-wide organization in California for
high school journalists, and this year's
convention will give a basis for the per
fection of such organization.
Definite plans have not been completed,
but as outlined at present the convention
will include all editors and managers of
high school papers published in the state;
and will provide for a prize contest for
the best high school paper. The conven
tion will probably last for two days, and
may be held at the time of the track
meet with California.
Chairmen Appointed
Committee chairmen were appointed to (
the different activities of the convention.
Andrew Boone lias charge of choosing 1
the delegates and arranging â€¢ ior their i
attendance; John Marble is chairman of!
the food and housing committee; Brad
ley Riter will conduct the prize contestj
for the high school newspapers; Norris!
James will arrange the program of the j
convention.
The principal aims of the convention |
will be, first, to aid the high school jonr-i
nalists in improving the quality of their j
papers by giving practical suggestions;!
and secondly, to form the papers into
some type of organization that will en
able them to work together to mutual j
advantage. In this way the high school
journalists, when they enter the uni
versity, will have an advanced standard
of news' works that will raise the effi
ciency of university journalism.
In the East and Middle West uni
versities, such as Nebraska, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, Maine, and Colorado, have
annual conventions of high school jour
nalists. Colorado holds a three-day ses
sion for the delegates. At Wisconsin
last year over 800 high school editors
and managers attended the convention.
W. S. C. Given Charter
A report of the activities of the ninth
annual convention of Sigma Delta Chi,
held at Minneapolis, November 19-21,
was given by Carl Shoup, the Stanford
chapter's delegate. He reported that
Washington State College had been
granted a chapter, bringing the total
number up to thirty-seven. The first in
ternational move made by the society
was in the early part of November, when
a chapter was installed at the University
of Toronto, Canada.
Plans were also made for an All-
University dance to be given by the
chapter on January 11.
