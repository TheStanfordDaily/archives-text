# JOURNALISTS PLAN STATE-WIDE HIGH SCHOOL CONCLAVE
## Sigma Delta Chi Will Meet Editors, Managers Here In Spring Quarter 
### 
Plans for a state -wide convention of
high-school editors and managers, to be
held at Stanford the first of the spring
quarter, were adopted last night at a
meeting of the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, national- professional
journalistic society. The meeting, held
at the Phi Delta Theta house, was pre
ceded by initiation ceremonies. The fol
lowing five men were admitted to mem
bership: Allan Charles, William Gage,
Edward Landels, John Marble, and
Henry Mack.
Conventions Succeed in East
The convention of high school jour
nalists will be the first move of its kind
to be made by any university in the
state. The fundamentals of the idea are
patterned after the plans worked out
and employed successfully by many East
ern universities. At present there is no
state-wide organization in California for
high school journalists, and this year's
convention will give a basis for the per
fection of such organization.
Definite plans have not been completed,
but as outlined at present the convention
will include all editors and managers of
high school papers published in the state;
and will provide for a prize contest for
the best high school paper. The conven
tion will probably last for two days, and
may be held at the time of the track
meet with California.
