### 
John E. Stoll, one of the foremost
pen and ink artists in the country, whose
work has appeared in the Quad for the
last two years, has printed a collection
of twelve of his drawings of campus
scenes.
The drawings are printed on hand
made Japanese rice paper in loose leaf
binding, which will permit the insertion
of additional drawings as they are print
ed from time to time.
Quad tryoutees are selling the books
on the campus for $2.50.
