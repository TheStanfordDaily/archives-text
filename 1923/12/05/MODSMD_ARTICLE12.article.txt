# QUAKE RISK UNRECOGNIZED
## Dr. Bailey Willis Believes Danger Is In Poorly-Constructed Buildings 
### 
"One of the most important ques
tions affecting Californian welfare and
business is that of earthquake risk.
Business men of San Francisco and
Los Angeles have shown their appre
ciation of this subject by trying to
smother it," says Doctor Bailey Willis,
professor emeritus of the Geology de
partment.
Since 19(16 and until quite recently,
it has been almost impossible to get
any public recognition that such risk
exists, but records for more than 100
years show that California is liable to
frequent earthquakes. The chief
sources of danger in this and other
countries are from the falling of poor
ly-constructed buildings and from the
disastrous conflagrations to which
earthquakes give rise.

Quakes Are Sudden
"We have learned," explains Doctor
Willis, "that an earthquake is an elas
tic vibration in solid rock caused by a
sudden spring along a plane of frac
ture that is called a fault. Planes of
that kind stand vertically in California
and run for scores of miles from
southeast, to northwest in general.
"There are areas in the central val- â– 
ley where no severe shock has ever'
been recorded or is every likely to be,
but on the other hand the Coast Range [
is peculiarly liable to them.
Quake-Measuring Instruments
"We have recently succeeded <n
constructing instruments that will
measure the elastic vibrations of the
earth, so that we may know when they'
increase and may determine when!
they come to the danger point. Thus
we may be able to give warning of j
approaching earthquakes. There is
reason to believe that this can eventu
ally be accomplished."
In the last few weeks, the United
States Coast Survey has shown a new
method of determining the condition
of the earth's crust. Surveyors, in mak
ing maps of large areas, mark out
relative positions of mountain peaks
often thirty or more miles away. An
exact spot on each peak is located
and the distance between any two
points is measured within a possible
error of a foot br two.
Surveys Made in State
"Surveys of this kind were made in
California a half century ago and have
been repeated 'from time to time.
Measurements taken last year show
that since 1900, Mount Tamalpals has
moved 5 feet south, Mount Diablo 3V6
feet southeast, and Point Reyes 11 feet
north. The greatest movement is near
San Luis Obispo, where the station
moved 15 feet north.
"The movements indicate a read
justment of great rock masses since
the disturbance in 1906, and also con
ditions of presure south of San Juan
Bautista. As long as the movement is
southward in the vicinity of San Fran
cisco, as it is now, there is no indica
tion of pressure and consequently no
probable danger of earthquake.
Knowledge Now Advanced
"With the recent advance of our
knowledge of the causes and local con
ditions which govern earthquakes, we
are in a position to discuss the subject
of earthquake risk in California. We
may consider it historically, or with
reference to the actual conditions of
pressure as shown by instruments and
measurements.
"Records of severe earthquakes in
California show shocks destroying San
Juan Capistran in 1812, an earthquake
which shook the country between
Santa Barbara and Monterey in 1857,
one in Oakland in 1868, and one that
set Are to San Francisco in 1906. In
1910, there was a severe shock in the
vicinity of L'os Angeles. Besides these
major shocks there have been hun
dreds of lesser intensity.
Build Shock-Proof Houses
"Though we may conclude that
there is not much chance of one
generation experiencing more than
one severe shock in Los Angeles or
San Francisco, yet the possibility is
sufficient to make it reasonable to
i build houses to withstand great
shocks. It is quite possible to do this
without steel frames and reinforced
| concrete. Frame buildings can be made
safe if they are well tied together in
all parts, although the plaster may
fall.
During the winter Doctor Willis is
going to publish, under the auspices of
the Seismological Society of America,
a series of articles on the earthquake
I risk in California.
