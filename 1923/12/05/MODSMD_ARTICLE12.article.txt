# QUAKE RISK UNRECOGNIZED
## Dr. Bailey Willis Believes Danger Is In Poorly-Constructed Buildings 
### 
"One of the most important ques
tions affecting Californian welfare and
business is that of earthquake risk.
Business men of San Francisco and
Los Angeles have shown their appre
ciation of this subject by trying to
smother it," says Doctor Bailey Willis,
professor emeritus of the Geology de
partment.
Since 19(16 and until quite recently,
it has been almost impossible to get
any public recognition that such risk
exists, but records for more than 100
years show that California is liable to
frequent earthquakes. The chief
sources of danger in this and other
countries are from the falling of poor
ly-constructed buildings and from the
disastrous conflagrations to which
earthquakes give rise.

Quakes Are Sudden
"We have learned," explains Doctor
Willis, "that an earthquake is an elas
tic vibration in solid rock caused by a
sudden spring along a plane of frac
ture that is called a fault. Planes of
that kind stand vertically in California
and run for scores of miles from
southeast, to northwest in general.
"There are areas in the central val- ■
ley where no severe shock has ever'
been recorded or is every likely to be,
but on the other hand the Coast Range [
is peculiarly liable to them.
Quake-Measuring Instruments
"We have recently succeeded <n
constructing instruments that will
measure the elastic vibrations of the
earth, so that we may know when they'
increase and may determine when!
