# Boulder Dam Is Feat Of Engineeringâ€”Durand

### 
"The Boulder Dam Project is one of
the greatest engineering feats ever
completed," was the assertion made by
W. F. Durand, professor of mechani
cal engineering, in his talk to the
Mechanical Engineering Society last
night.
Dr. Durand divided the benefits of
the dam project into three main heads.
The dam will keep the terrific flood
waters of the Colorado river under
control during the period of melting
snows. It will hold the onrush of flood
water, and can be used as an irriga
tion project. A total of nearly 6,000,000
acres will be made possible for culti
vation in both the upper reaches of
the river and in the lower valley from
Needles to Yuma, instead of the 2,-
000,000 acres now under cultivation. In
addition, it will be possible to com
mand a great supply of hydro-electric
power.
