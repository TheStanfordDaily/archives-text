# Cross Country Teams Will Race Tomorrow Over Stanford Course
## 
### 
The annual Stanford-California cross
country run will be held tomorrow aft
ernoon at 4 o'clock on the Stanford
course. As little is known of the Cali
fornia men as a team, the result of the
meet is indefinite.
The most likely winners of the race
appear to be Jensen, Murphy, Kerr,
and Hayes. Jensen, who is probably
California's strongest distance man,
has been in training since and during
the last summer, when he several
times ran the two mile in under ten
minutes.
Paul Murphy, who placed second in
the race last year, and Bill Kerr, who
won the long distance events in the
1926 freshman meet, appear to be well
conditioned for the grind. Both men
have a great deal of strength and more
endurance than the rest of Temple
ton's men. Captain Frank Hayes is
also in fine condition, and stands a
good chance of winning the event.
The remaining Stanford runners are
Clifford, Charles, Cypher, Thayer,
Swain, McClelland, and Daly.
