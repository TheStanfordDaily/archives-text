# SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM OUTPLAYS FRESMEN; WINS BY 9-0 SCORE
## 
### 
By a score of 9-0, the senior hockey
team, playing a fast offensive game, de
feated the freshmen team yesterday aft
ernoon on the Roble turf in the the first
interclass game of the season. The
freshmen's principal trouble was lack of
teamwork.
During most of the game the seniors
kept the ball near their opponents' goal,
and the freshmen were able only a few
times to bring the play far into the field.
At no time were the seniors in serious
danger of being scored on.
Isabelle Muzzey, scoring four goals in
the first half, and Muriel Bell, making
one tally in the first half and three in
the last, were the most spectacular play
ers of the game. Alice Roth scored the
remaining point in the first half.
All players of the senior team arc con
sistent, of nearly equal hockey ability,
and they work together with precision.
The freshmen are better perhaps than
the usual first-year team, which is always
under the overwhelming disadvantage of
being'composed almost entirely of mem
bers who have never played before.
Following arc the line-ups:
Freshmen—Louise Whitaker, Margaret
Schaufelberger, Marie Manehe, Louise
Shepherd, Charlotte Lovekin, Frances
Gooden, Barbara Fenwick, Lydia Mur
ray, Lucile Burlingame, Ruth Sievers,
