# FOR THE TENTH MAN
## 
### 
It has been announced by the Department of Physical Education that
1600 of the 1800 men students qualified to take gymnasium work are
enrolled in classes at Encina gym. Of these 1800 over a half are
freshmen and sophomores whose attendance is compulsory, and more
than a fourth more are those trying out for places on different major
and minor sport teams. Two hundred men never go near the gym
nasium.
The proportion, then, is nine out of ten, counting compulsory at
tendants and varsity athletes. While there seems to be no way at
present to accommodate the tenth man, it is known that there are
plans under way to so increase the effectiveness of the gymnasium staff
that competent supervision may be given every man who wishes to
enroll in physical education classes.
When these plans are completed—a prospect which seems very near
realization—one may expect from the raised standard of supervision
and competent training for men of mediocre ability, that university
credit for work in the gymnasium will follow as a matter of course. .
