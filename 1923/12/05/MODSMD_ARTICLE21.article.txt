# A 						DEGREE IN PHYSICAL TRAINING
## 
### 
Far greater than any increase in classes in the present Physical
Education department is the prospect, explained in a summer issue of
the Daily Palo Alto, of establishing a school of Physical Education at
Stanford, granting a regular university diploma with an S.B. degree,
for work in the theory and practice of all elements of physical training.
At present the plan is nothing more than a hope for the future, no
nearer realization than was solution of the campus housing problem
two years ago.,
When such a school is inaugurated, it will mean that Stanford will be
the first college on the Coast to recognize that training of men and boys
in physical betterment has become a profession, which should be carried
on by men of university training.
The student who leaves Stanford with a degree in the school of
physical education will have, besides his Lower Division training and
incidental cultural courses, a coaching knowledge of all sports played on
the Farm, a knowledge of hygiene, anatomy, chemistry, dietetics, cor
rective exercises, and all other subjects required to give a man full ability
to take his place in any institution in the country as a coach or physical
instructor.
