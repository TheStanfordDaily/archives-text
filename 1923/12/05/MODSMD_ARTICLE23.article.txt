C. S. S.

Oh don't you remember Sweet Alice's Bent Bolt,
Sweet Alice whose Ford coup was brown,
Who cooed with delight when it actually ran
But wept when the old wreck broke down;
Ah . . . one day while racing along at top speed
This Bent Bolt gave way with a groan . . .
They towed the Ford coup to the nearest garage
But Sweet Alice lies under that stone.
