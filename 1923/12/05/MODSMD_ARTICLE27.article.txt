# COLLEGE EDUCATION AND CRIME
## 
### 
College educated men turn criminals in the same proportion as their less
learned brothers and there are more lawyers in American prisons than college
men of other callings, Professor Carl Murchison of Clarke College declared
in a report to Johns Hopkins University. He has just completed three years
of comprehensive research work in American prisons, his inquiries being
confined to 7,000 college men behind the bars.
Mr. Murchison stated that few educated men serve more than one term,
while uneducated men of equal intelligence frequently repeat. Forty or more
is the danger age, he said, and in nearly every case the college-bred criminal
is of middle age and serving his first term.
Among the facts Dr. Murchison adduced were these:
Ministers rank with doctors and lawyers as offenders against the law and
98 per cent of educated criminals are church members.
Educated criminals were held for premeditated, well-planed crimes, such
as forgery and swindling, hut not often for crimes of violence such as murder
and burglary.
Not a single college professor or highly-trained scientist is a convicted and
imprisoned criminal, though a number of secondary school instructors were
found.
•Unpremeditated or impulsive offenses are committed by the emotional type,
usually musicians.
Of the few women of college education in prison most had committed
murder.
California prisoners are more intelligent than those of any other state. —
