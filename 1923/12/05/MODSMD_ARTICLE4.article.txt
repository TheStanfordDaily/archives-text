# PROPOSED CANADIAN RUGBY TRIP CALLED OFF, SAYS BARROW
## Faculty Committee Refuses to Recognize Activity as Stanford Sport 
### 
"The proposed Stanford University-
British Columbia rugby games which
were to have taken place during the
Christmas- holidays have been cancell
ed, said Dr. W. H. Barrow.
The trip was authorized by the
Board of Athletic Control at its meet
ing last week. Several reasons for
abandoning the trip were expressed by
Dr. Barrow. The first being that it is
not advisable to send out a team bear
ing the Stanford name in a sport that
si not recognized at Stanford.
Dr. Barrow's full statement is this:
"In disapproving the proposed rugby
trip to British Columbia the faculty
committee on athletics felt that rugby
was not a recognized undergraduate
sport, and it seems inadvisable to send
out a team bearing the Stanford name
in a sport that is not a recognized
undergraduate activity. It is also felt
that in view of limited time, the ap
proaching examinations, and the pos
sible interference with regular sports,
an attempt to get together and train a
team for games three weeks hence
would be inadvisable."
The statement fixes the responsibi
ty with the Faculty committee on
athletics.
Olympic Material Expected
With the granting of permission by
the Board of Athletic Control early
last week, Coach Harry Maloney be
gan conducting intensive practices
with a large turnout. Thirty men were
at the first workout. It was hoped that
this training would develop several
Stanford men for the United States
rugby team for the Olympic games
this summer, as well as giving Stan
ford an opportunity to participate in
an international contest, at which it
has previously had a good record.
However, the Faculty Committee j
felt that rugby was not a recognized ;
undergraduate sport, and that the ap- j
propriations should not be made to!
