# SOPHOMORES WIN TWO BASKETBALL GAMES FROM BABE QUINTETS
## Price, Shipkey, and Newkirk Appear Most Formidable Of Babe Players 
### 
Opening the 1923 interclass basketball
series, the first and second sophomore
fives downed the freshman quintets last
evening by scores of 12-5 and 11-9.
Sprinting exhibitions, with little de
fensive work, were the principal occu
pation of both the second teams that
opened the evening's games. However,
Fairchild, the lanky second-year forward,
had a better eye for the baskets than
did any of the yearlings. He accounted
for eight of the eleven sophomore tallies.
Morgan also displayed good offensive
talent for the sophomores.
Among the yearlings, Southworth
shows promise at forward, and Clark at
guard.
In the first-string game that followed,
five were sent in for the freshmen,
These kept the sophomores busy, but the
latter, though winded, played a better
average game throughout.
Perhaps the best competition offered
the second-year men was by the second
of the five teams, substituted soon after
the opening whistle. Price, former Long
Beach High School basketball and
gridiron man, forced Campbell, the fight
ing sophomore coach and guard, to ex
tend himself to the utmost. Shipkey, a
fast running guard, kept the second-year
men busy, as did Newkirk at center*
Other yearlings that showed well were
Newhouse, Joseph, Reese, and George.
Frank, the diminutive sophomore for
ward, accounted for three of their goals,
and Knox at center proved himself a
fighter on offense. Fane also showed
well at forward on both defense and
offense.
