# WILLIS DESCRIBES QUAKE TRAGEDY IN CHILEAN VILLAGES
## Six Hundred People Killed Out of Population of Three Thousand 
### 
Three minutes of violent ground
rocking killed 600 people out of a
population of 3000 in one of the cities
described by Professor Bailey Willis,
of the Geology department, in his talk
on the Chilean earthquake yesterday
evening.
During this time and the next seven
minutes before the shaking had stop
ped, people were killed before they
had time to awaken.
Slides were shown of the damage
done. Professor Willis pointed out a
two-story house standing among the
ruins of several smaller houses, and
indicated that it often happened that
the larger ones remained. He told of
an old chapel which had stood through
disasters of this kind for over 100
years. The foundation was laid near
the rocks, and the walls were firmly
built.
Twisting Movement Characteristic
Another slide represented a statue
which had fallen with its head toward
the pedestal. This showed that it had
not pitched forward, but had fallen
with a twisting movement, which Pro
fessor Willis explained was character
istic of earthquake action.
Exhibiting a picture of a crack in
the earth's surface, which he reported
to be a mile long, Professor Willis
claimed that, contrary to the belief
of most people that the earth opened,
it was merely the alluvial covering
that had cracked.
"Under the Pacific 20,000,000 square
miles were shaken by the temblor,"
he estimated. "This is partly the re
sult of gravitation, partly the mole
cular forces of recrystalization."
Reactions Were Curious
"The reactions of different people to
the earthquake at the time it occurred
were curious," declared Professor Wil
lis. "One American told me that he
made up his mind that the best place
was in bed. If he were to get up, he
decided he would be apt to stub his
toe. A wall fell, and he thought 'That's
