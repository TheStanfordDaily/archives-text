# Chappie Desires Much Copy Before Christmas For "Midsummer" Issue
## 
### 
Chappie will come out in mid-summer
togs on Registration Day at the first of
the year. Hut his appearance is de
pendant upon an unusual amount of
copy. That elusive product of a can
tankerous disposition is much needed by
Mike Ely, Chappie's master mind, if he
and his charge are to make a success of
the next issue entitled "Mid-Summer
Number." The deadline for art and lit
erature is December 15. Ye Editor re
marks that no one should wait until just
before the institution shuts down for
vacation to hand in material for the pub
lication, since finals and the usual Christ
mas shopping must needs consume con
siderable of that last-minute time.
Copy for the combined issue of Chap
pie and Columbia Jester is also due on
December 15, although the combination
will not appear until February 1.
