" Christmas Oratorio," by Bach, to
be given ( in the Memorial Church
December 15, is the first work of this
famous composer to be used in one of
the annual oi'atorios celebrating
Christmas.
Ten members of the San Francisco
Symphony, and four soloists will
assist the University choir and
orchestra in the presentation. The
soloists are: Miss Winifred Esta
brook. soprano; Mrs. Esther H.
Allen, contralto; Carl Edwin Ander
son. tenor; and Austin Sperry.bass.
The "Christftias Oratorio" is con
sidered not only one of Bach's great
est choral works, but one of the
masterpieces of all time. In its en-!
tirety it is a monumental work, con-j
sisting of six parts, one for each day!
of the Christmas festival as it was ce-j
lebrated in Germany. Each part is a
half hour in length. Only the first two
parts will be included in the Stanford
performance.
Music Different
The music, as is characteristic of
Bach, is difficult of interpretation
and will tax the utmost skill of the
performers.
in the parts to be given at Stanford
there are two magnificant choruses,
"Christians, Be Joyful," and "Glory
to God in the Highest," which calls
for virtuoso efforts on the part of the
choir. There are two solos for alto,
"Prepare Thyself, Zion," and the j
"Slumber Song"; one for tenor,;
"Haste Ye Shepherds;' and one for
bass, "King all Glorious."
Interspersed with the solos and
choruses are recitatives narrating the!
Christmas story, and linking the whole
into a complete masterpiece.
This oratorio was chosen by War
ren I). Allen in the hope of the spirit
of Christmas as celebrated in song in
all the countries. The oratorios of
England are said to be particularly
magnificent. Choruses from three
great cathedrals combine in the pre
sentation of an oratorio. The great
singers of the time provide the solo
work. General voices are chosen for
tone quality with extreme care, often
from different sections of the country,
Tenors traditionally come from Corn
wall and basses from Yorkshire. The
character of the climate seems to give
their voices a different tone quality.
First Bach Performance
For more than twelve years Christ
mas oratorios have been given in Me
morial Church. "The Creation," "Eli
jah," and the "Hymn of Praise" will
be especially remembered.
