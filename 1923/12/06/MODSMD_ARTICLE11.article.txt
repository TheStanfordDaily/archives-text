# "APPLEJACK" IS PLAY OF ARABIAN NIGHTS
## Vivid, Difficult Acting To Be Seen In Sophomore Comedy Offering; Pirate Scenes Thrilling 
### Allan Charles 
"Captain Applejack" will be the most entertaining of all plays to be given
this college year.
This suggestion is offered in advance of the presentation tomorrow night by
Coach Gordon Davis on the basis of his knowledge that this "Arabian Nights
Adventure" is the best of the entertainment type of play obtainable this
year, and on his acquaintance with the ability of the sophomore cast.
The first dress rehearsal, which was held last night, seems to corroborate
this estimate both in the quality of the play and the character of the players.
"People who want to see a first-class, purely-engaging show now have their
opportunity," says Davis. " 'Captain Applejack' is among the first of modern

comedies, absorbing and really humorous. If this is what the student prefers,!
r )\v is his best chance."
Realism Displaces Comedy
Although "a strain of humor runs through the structure of the entire play, j
the fanciful situations make room for realism that requires (and seems here
to receive) vivid, difficult acting. In the second act the passionate scene |
between the Portuguese captive (Aileene Burks) and Captain Applejack
(Lloyd Nolan) is so thrilling and intense that all memory of the wild, fan-

»tastical nature of the circumstances
vanishes.
Among other intense situations
which require serious acting is that
between Applejohn and Anna Valeska
(Aileene Burks in her other role); the
encounter of the Russian gentleman
(played by Delmer Daves) with
Applejohn; and the fatal card-cutting
act between Captain Applejack and
the pirate conspirators' leader (Del
mer Daves in a second role). All these


"Gamblers' luck or we scuttle the ship—yo ho for a deck of cards" —Apple-
jack wins the second cut for the captaincy of the pirate sloop and possession
of the captive; the third drawing decides his fate.
The cap'n and the crew, from starboard to larboard: Kenneth Chantry,
Charles Benedict, Hartley Devlin, Delmer Daves, Marjorie Allen, Lloyd Nolan,
Aileene Burks.
.
are sufficiently realistic to break away
from the comedy.
Feminine Cast Promising
The feminine members of this soph
omore cast show great promise.
Aileene Burks, although a little young
for her part, is considered by Davis to
be a great find.
Marjorie Allen is adapted happily
to the part of Poppy Faire, the hero
ine of the romantic drama. She
changes to a cabin boy in the second
I act quite readily. Patrice Naumau in
the part of a feminine crook fits her
characterization better than any mem
ber of the cast.
A double quartet from the Glee Club
has been secured for back-stage music.
Tickets for the play may be ob
tained tomorrow morning and after
noon at the office of the alumni secre
tary in the Administration building.
Prices are $1 and $1.50.
