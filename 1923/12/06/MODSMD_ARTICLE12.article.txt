# Modern Medicine To Be Discussed By Dr. Jordan Tonight
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will tal kon "Modern Med
icine" at his home at 7 :30 this evening.
He will describe the rapid growth of*
modern medicine since Pasteur and Lis
ter proved the germ theory of disease,
and will explain the many ramifications
of present-day science.
"There wasn't so much to learn when
I went to medical college," said Dr.
Jordan. He graduated in medicine be
fore anyone knew definitely about bac
teriology. His first scientific paper was
written about diseases in sheep, and at
the time no no one knew what the virus
was that caused the disease.
"The discovery of bacteriology and the
germ theory has dispelled our notions of
the past that all diseases should be
treated alike, and that each has a remedy
somewhere in nature.'' said Dr. Jordan.
"Now we know that disease is caused by
parasitic plant and animal life and that
not all the charms in the world—not
even a camphor bag—will keep it away."
