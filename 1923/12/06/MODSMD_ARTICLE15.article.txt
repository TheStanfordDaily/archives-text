## Varsity Aspirants to Have Regular Competition on Saturday Morning 
### 
j "Tiny" Hartranft, varsity track star
| of two years ago, will be back in col
lege next quarter, Coach "Dink" Temple-
I ton announced yesterday.
Hartranft took first place in the discus
I and shotput at the I. C. A. A. A. A. two
i years ago, and his presence on the Stan
; ford track team should give the Cards
j first in these two events. Hartranft is
j also a sprinter of considerable merit.
Templeton will give his track men an
opportunity to show their stuff at 10:30
Saturday morning, when the first regu
lar fall track meet will be held on the
| old varsity track field.
Everyone May Participate
All events will be run. with the pos
sible exception of the mile and two-mile
runs. All men in the University will be
' eligible, and Templeton desires a large
; turnout.
Campbell, Hale, Gaspar, and Miller are
j the chief entrants in the century. Camp
bell has not been doing much so far, but
Hale has been covering the distance in
0:10 1-5 in most of the Friday afternoon
[ meets. These same men will be the con
tenders in the 220-yard dash.
Van Judah, the track captain, will be
lon hand to run the quarter. Shermund,
j Storey, Nixon, and Coverley will also
t make bids for honors in this race. The
lhalf-milers will be Richardson, Daly,
! Dole, Smith, Mcintosh, and Swayne.
i Competition should be keen in this
! event, as all of these men are capable oi
I doing about two minutes flat.
Richards Best in Shot
Leistner, Boles, and Wells will com
pete in the low and high hurdles. Well,
is a transfer, but will be eligible for
varsity competition this year.
Richards is the best shotputter on
hand, and he, "Scotchy" Campbell, am,
Wankowski are the principal discus
throwers. The weight-throwing depart
ment will be strengthened when "Tiny"
Hartranft and Jim Arthur return. Farish
looks to be the best bet in the javelin,
throwing th spear around the 180-fou
mark.
Macßae, Wells, Wright, and Bragg are
vicing for honors in the broad jum
They are all landing about twenty feet
from the take-off. The pole vaulters,
handicapped by the loss of Bill Black,
will put forth Dennis and Schofield, both
of whom vault higher than twelve feet.
Lloyd, the freshman vaulter last year,
is getting up higher than eleven feet, but
is not in the class of the older men yet.
In the high jump Kemnitzer, Work,
Anderson, and Richman are the best
men. Work and Anderson are fresh
men. but are doing practically as well
as the varsity jumpers.

' eligible, and Templeton desires a large
; turnout.
Campbell, Hale, Gaspar, and Miller are
j the chief entrants in the century. Camp
bell has not been doing much so far, but
Hale has been covering the distance in
0:10 1-5 in most of the Friday afternoon
[ meets. These same men will be the con
tenders in the 220-yard dash.
Van Judah, the track captain, will be
lon hand to run the quarter. Shermund,
j Storey, Nixon, and Coverley will also
t make bids for honors in this race. The
lhalf-milers will be Richardson, Daly,
! Dole, Smith, Mcintosh, and Swayne.
i Competition should be keen in this
! event, as all of these men are capable oi
I doing about two minutes flat.
Richards Best in Shot
Leistner, Boles, and Wells will com
pete in the low and high hurdles. Well,
is a transfer, but will be eligible for
varsity competition this year.
Richards is the best shotputter on
hand, and he, "Scotchy" Campbell, am,
Wankowski are the principal discus
throwers. The weight-throwing depart
ment will be strengthened when "Tiny"
Hartranft and Jim Arthur return. Farish
looks to be the best bet in the javelin,
throwing th spear around the 180-fou
mark.
Macßae, Wells, Wright, and Bragg are
vicing for honors in the broad jum
They are all landing about twenty feet
from the take-off. The pole vaulters,
handicapped by the loss of Bill Black,
will put forth Dennis and Schofield, both
of whom vault higher than twelve feet.
Lloyd, the freshman vaulter last year,
is getting up higher than eleven feet, but
is not in the class of the older men yet.
In the high jump Kemnitzer, Work,
Anderson, and Richman are the best
men. Work and Anderson are fresh
men. but are doing practically as well
as the varsity jumpers.
j "Tiny" Hartranft, varsity track star
| of two years ago, will be back in col
lege next quarter, Coach "Dink" Temple-
I ton announced yesterday.
Hartranft took first place in the discus
I and shotput at the I. C. A. A. A. A. two
i years ago, and his presence on the Stan
; ford track team should give the Cards
j first in these two events. Hartranft is
j also a sprinter of considerable merit.

opportunity to show their stuff at 10:30
Saturday morning, when the first regu
lar fall track meet will be held on the
