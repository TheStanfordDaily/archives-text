### 
Dr. Margery Bailey of the English
department has written an article, "Bos
well as Essayist," which is printed in a
recent issue of "The Journal of English
and Germanic Philology," a quarterly
publication of the University of Illinois.
In the article, Dr. Bailey offers proof
against the argument set forth by Dr. J.
T. T. Brown in his article on "James
Boswell as Essayist," which appeared in
the "Scottish Historical Review for Jan
uary, 1921.
In the light of Boswell's "Life of Sam
i uel Johnson," he discusses the seventy
numbers of the essay series which Bos
well published anonymously under the
title of "The Hypochrondriak," in the
London Magazine from October, 1777, to
August, 1783.
Dr. Bailey's theory is that Boswell did
not write these "ingenuous and charming
pages" merely in preparation for his
"Life of Samuel Johnson," but that the
reason for the appearance of parts of the
essays in the biography was that lie took
a pride in reprinting certain choice bits
at times when lie became discouraged in
his great work.
I he author writes, "The more t con
sider the proportion of parallel passages,
the more I become convinced that Bos
well's whole interest in these essays is
I Boswell, not Johnson." This was before
i he started his work of the biography, in
I which his whole interest centered around
I Samuel Johnson.
