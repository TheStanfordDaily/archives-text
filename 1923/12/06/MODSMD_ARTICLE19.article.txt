# "WHADDAYA KNOW?"

### 
Two students were arguing yesterday, as students sometimes do, on the
question of whether Stanford gave her graduates a broad interest and a
knowledge of contemporary events.
"Certainly!" said one, emphatically. "Look at the courses in History,
Economics, Political Science—all the very latest practical instruction
that any college could offer.
"Look at the interest in undergraduate affairs, which presages similar
interest in community affairs afterwards.
"Guess we college students have about as broad a background as pos
sible when we leave this place."
* * *
"Wrong," was the reply. "This campus is a narrowing influence.
Students never look or think beyond it. Their interests are all centered
on the Farm, and they never bother to keep themselves posted on what
goes outside their own little circle. Perhaps they read a sporting page
once in a while, but that's all.
"Say—do you know anything about how the deadlock in Congress
came out? Whether Coolidge or Johnson are leading in the primary
race? Why Los Angeles lost the motion picture ball? Whether the
United States will be given a Roman Catholic cardinal by the pope? If
the Palais Royal is really going to be closed? 'How many men France
has withdrawn from the Ruhr?"
* * *
The answer to this extemporaneous questionnaire was typical of
Stanford students, wjiose world is bounded by the limits of the farm.
"I have a class now, goodbye," was the reply of the affirmative.

A man was surprised the other day having his picture taken in his
brand new uniform. lie blushed almost the color of his coat, whether
because of modesty, because he was posing in the cactus gardens, or be
cause he had the Mausoleum as a background is open to conjecture.
