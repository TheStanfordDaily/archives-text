The Chain of Causation
A and B meet in an elevator, going up. A says: "B, your father is a sneak
thief and a mud-slinger." B says to A: "That's nothing, your uncle is a horse
thief and practices medicine." A says: "Well, your father is a slob of the
first order." B says, "Yes, but your uncle eats his horseradish with a knife."
At this A becomes incensed, temporarily losing control of one of his arms,
which flies up and hits B just below the mouth. The elevator man thereupon
stops the car, causing 2XY, a dry-goods salesman, to lose his train connection,
thereby spoiling a $10,000 sales. As a result, 2XY's employer, Pb, commits
suicide by chewing dynamite. In so doing lie blows up a building where
A's father is working. A's father dies immediately.
Question: Is B's father responsible for causing A's father's
death? Was he not negli- <s>

gent in being a horse
thief? Who said so? Did
the dynamite break the
chain of causation?
