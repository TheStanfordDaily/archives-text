The street car motorman
blanged his bell with
two short, staccato jerks
on the cord, and started
the heavy car on its
grinding way. He whistled
blithely. "There's a happy
man .evidently contented
with his job," remarked a
passenger to his companion.
"No; 1 know him," from the
other. "He wants to be a
traffic policeman." They
stopped at an intersection.
The traffic cop shrilled
his whistle, his big arms
semaphored the change in
right-of-way, and the
street car rumbled
forward. As it passed
the officer, the motorman
and he exchanged smiles.
Real smiles. A news
urchin on the corner
said: "Y'see that there
copâ€”he wants to be a
motorman. Told me bo
hisself, he did."
