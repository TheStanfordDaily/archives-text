# "THE WORLD IS MINE"
## 
### From McGill Daily 
At the time of Convocation last May
a skilled cartoonist represented the
graduating student in the following man
ner : with a parchment in his hand and
wearing a self-satisfied grin on his vis
age, with his chest prominently stuck
out. with his feet set firmly on the earth
and saying, "The world is mine." Bey
side this was another representation of
the graduate in later life with the world
having its foot on and crushing to death
the unhappy college man.
While this drawing, together with oth
ers of a similar nature which appear in
various publications, may he of humor
ous intent, they exemplify a common and
absurd estimation of the college man in
the minds of many who are either too
prejudiced or too small mentally to pass
an unbiased judgment. It is true that
a student experiences a certain amount
of exhilaration on receiving a degree.
Why should he not after spending a
quarter of a lifetime in procuring it?
But to represent him as considering the
world at his feet is dealing with broad
generalities. There may he one, among
many, whose idea of the power of accu
mulated knowledge is rather contorted.
When the time comes for such to meet
his fellow men on a practical basis he
will probably find himself shoved into
the discard until his attitude of mind
changes. But this type is not repre
sentative of the mass. Are we not right
when we say that a graduating student,
who has passed through the process of
finding out what a great difference there
is between what he has learned and what
may be learned, is a rather humble indi
vidual to whom worldly power seems
far beyond his horizon?
And to depict the graduate being
crushed by the world when embroiled in
its maelstrom of activities is not adher
ing to facts. Statistics show that a large
percentage of the high positions in a
country are held by university gradu
ates, and they are not, except in the case
of failing health, overpowered by their
burdens. We admire a man who, though
lacking a good education, can climb to
the heights in his sphere of work. Too
often, however, such a one becomes ob
sessed with the idea that higher educa
tion produces priggish self-satisfied,
good-for-nothing types of manhood who
cannot adapt themselves to their environ
ment in practical life. Hence is the
origin of many arguments against the
over-criticized college student.

its maelstrom of activities is not adher
ing to facts. Statistics show that a large
percentage of the high positions in a
country are held by university gradu
ates, and they are not, except in the case
of failing health, overpowered by their
burdens. We admire a man who, though
lacking a good education, can climb to
the heights in his sphere of work. Too
often, however, such a one becomes ob
sessed with the idea that higher educa
tion produces priggish self-satisfied,
good-for-nothing types of manhood who
cannot adapt themselves to their environ
ment in practical life. Hence is the
origin of many arguments against the
over-criticized college student.
At the time of Convocation last May
a skilled cartoonist represented the
graduating student in the following man
ner : with a parchment in his hand and
wearing a self-satisfied grin on his vis
age, with his chest prominently stuck
out. with his feet set firmly on the earth
and saying, "The world is mine." Bey
side this was another representation of
the graduate in later life with the world
having its foot on and crushing to death
the unhappy college man.
While this drawing, together with oth
ers of a similar nature which appear in
various publications, may he of humor
ous intent, they exemplify a common and
absurd estimation of the college man in
the minds of many who are either too
prejudiced or too small mentally to pass
an unbiased judgment. It is true that
a student experiences a certain amount
of exhilaration on receiving a degree.
Why should he not after spending a
quarter of a lifetime in procuring it?
But to represent him as considering the
world at his feet is dealing with broad
generalities. There may he one, among
many, whose idea of the power of accu
mulated knowledge is rather contorted.
When the time comes for such to meet
his fellow men on a practical basis he
will probably find himself shoved into
the discard until his attitude of mind
changes. But this type is not repre
sentative of the mass. Are we not right
when we say that a graduating student,
who has passed through the process of
finding out what a great difference there
is between what he has learned and what
may be learned, is a rather humble indi
vidual to whom worldly power seems
far beyond his horizon?
And to depict the graduate being
crushed by the world when embroiled in
its maelstrom of activities is not adher
ing to facts. Statistics show that a large
percentage of the high positions in a
country are held by university gradu
ates, and they are not, except in the case
of failing health, overpowered by their
burdens. We admire a man who, though
lacking a good education, can climb to
the heights in his sphere of work. Too
often, however, such a one becomes ob
sessed with the idea that higher educa
tion produces priggish self-satisfied,
good-for-nothing types of manhood who
cannot adapt themselves to their environ
ment in practical life. Hence is the
origin of many arguments against the
