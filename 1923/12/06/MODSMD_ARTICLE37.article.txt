# Stanford Band to Earn Shoes Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
v â€”
The Stanford Band will earn its
shoes tomorrow night by playing for
the Palo Alto Merchants' Associ
ation Christmas, party. The band
needed the new shoes for the Big
Game. The rather conservatively
allotted funds of the Board of Ath
letic Control were insufficient for the
necessary footwear.
So the band must turn out tomor
row night fifty strong to pay its just
debts.
