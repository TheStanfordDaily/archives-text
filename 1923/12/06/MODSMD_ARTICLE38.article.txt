ITHACA, N. Yâ€”"When Caesar
camped in Briton, he introduced the
first game of soccer, which as the
Roman soldiery played it, was a com
bination of American football and soc
cer, played as a part of war training,"
declares Coach Nick Bawlf, varsity
coach of soccer, hockey, and lacrosse
at Cornell University.
The evolution of soccer into Ameri
can football came when the league of
English soccer players who moved to
Canada challenged Harvard, and as a
result of the game Harvard changed
their sport of soccer to that of original
football.
At Cornell soccer was the original
game until the freshmen decided to
play according to the new rules of
picking up the ball and running with
it, which was first introduced at
Rugby.
After a class war of five years,
introduced modern football into Cor
nell.
Hockey is the result of a gradual
improvement of the Canadian game of
shinny, and lacrosse is the national
sport of the Indians as interpreted by
Americans.
