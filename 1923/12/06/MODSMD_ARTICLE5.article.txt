# UPPERCLASSMEN SPLIT CLASS COURT MATCHES
## Junior Second Team Wins 15-9; Senior Firsts Come Back, 19-11 
### 
The senior and junior class quintets
divided victories last night, playing the
second night of the interclass series.
The junior second team took their
battle, 15-9, and the senior firsts won,
9-11.
The second team game was short of
any defense at all for the opening half,
but in the second half the third-year men
tightened and allowed only three points
through their hoop.
The offensives were good, and Fletcher,
the tall senior center, with De Bach and
Colgati, repeatedly had the ball in
junior territory. Middleton, Hobro, and
Bigelow, for the latter, also played the
ball around the senior goal continually.
In the first team clash, the same fives,
with only a few substitutions, again
came together. This time better team
work was displayed, and both were able
to pierce the opposing defense with criss
cross passes.
At the end of the first period, the
senior quintet led, 10-7. In the second
half Cunningham and De Bach account
ed for eight additional senior tallies.
Steward Bigelow and Middleton again
showed up well for the third-year five
and often threatened the senior goal.
