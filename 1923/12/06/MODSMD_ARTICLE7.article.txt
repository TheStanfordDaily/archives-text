# CANADIAN RUGBY TOUR DEFINITELY REFUSED SANCTION
## Faculty Committee Vetoes Motion to Reconsider Proposed Trip 
### 
A motion to reconsider the proposed
Stanford University-British Columbia'
rugby trip was promptly voted down by j
the Faculty Athletic Committee in a J
meeting this morning.
The proposal had been previously
sanctioned by the Board of Athletic Con
trol in a meeting last week, and had been
nullified by the faculty committee.
Reasons for disapproving the rugby
trip were to the effect that the committee
did not feel that rugby was a recognized
undergraduate sport, and it seemed in-;
advisable to send out a team bearing j
Stanford's name in a sport which was i
not officially recognized at the University, i
Some members of the committee also j
felt that the student body in general was
opposed to the trip, and under such con
ditions there was no necessity for
sanction.
Trip Might Interfere With Studies
The committee decided also that it
would be undesirable to send a hastily
collected team of graduate students on a
long and expensive tour to represent the
undergraduate student body.
Rugby training would take most of
the men away from their university work
endangering their scholastic standing. ,
The trip would likewise take many of
the men away from major sports, where
they would be able to represent the Uni
versity more capably.
Immediately after the trip had been
sanctioned by the Board of Athletic Con
trol many of the students reported for
practice under Coach Harry Maloney,
and prospects for a strong team were
assured.
