# LAST GOALS MADE IN DARK AS '26 HOCKEY TEAM BEATS JUNIORS
## Sophomores Unite to Run Up Score of 5-2 Against 1925 Class Team 
### 
Exhibiting better team-work than
j they have shown this quarter, the
; sophomore hockey team defeated the
j juniors 5-2 in the second match of the
| interclass series yesterday afternoon
; on Roble field.
The sophomores made the last two
j goals after it became so dark that no
1 one but the player driving the ball
j could see it.
The juniors were favored to win
j and played unusually well but the
I flukes of the game were against them.
On three occasions they had the ball
within six inches of the, sophomore
goal and each time something hap
pened and the sophomores recovered.
One chief trouble with the juniors
was that they did not push after the
ball hard enough and allowed the
sophomores to get away with it.
Both teams played a faster and
more finished game of hockey than
they have shown in previous scrim
mages this fall. The sophomores were
a good deal better than in either of
their intercollegiate contests. They
will play the seniors for the interclass
championship.
Following are the line-ups:
Sophomores—Lois Wilbur, Mildred
Worswick, Miriam Ebright, Susan
Hyde, Jean Ward, Ruth Vredenburgh,
Cecile Feusier, Ruth Snedden, Milli
son Hardy, Florence Stanley, Aileen
Tognazzini; substitutes, Frances Lau
rence, Margaret Earle.
Juniors —Margaret Watson, Mabel
McKibbin, Carol Davis, Doris Harter,
Sarah Meskimons, Carolan Strouse,
Carolyn Peirce, Violet Balcomb, Dor
othy Dahler, Edith Burlingame, Mar
garet Raymond.
