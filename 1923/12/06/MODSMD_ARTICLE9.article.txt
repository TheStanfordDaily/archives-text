# VARSITY TAKES FORM IN CONTEST WITH FRESHMEN
## McHose and Nevers Are Fastest Forwards; McBurney Is Good Prospect For Running Guard Position 
### 
Stanford's 1924 basketball team is
slowly developing some semblance of
strength and unity, under the constant
attention of Andy Kerr.
The squad is holding regular practice
every night in the Pavilion, with some
twenty-five or thirty players reporting.
In a scrimmage with the freshman
team yesterday afternoon the varsity
showed possibilities of becoming a fast
defensive and offensive aggregation.
Many goals were missed, but the
guarding and passing were above par
for this early in the season.
The lirst team men started with Gur
don Steele at center. "Nip" McHose, and
Ernie Nevers at forwards, Dave Oliva
and Harry Shipkey at guards. Ray Mc-
Burney, who replaced Shipkey shortly
after the scrimmage had begun, looks to

be one of the most promising of the
guard candidates.
He should easily develop into the lack
ing running guard which was made nec
essary because of the loss of Fred
Anderson.
"Nip" McHose is swiftly hitting his
old stride. His dodging, squirming, and
clusivencss are the features of every
practice, and it looks as if "Nip" will
have even a greater year than last. Mc-
Hose was one of the best forwards on
the Pacific Coast last year, and his ability
to shoot goals brought comments from
every part of the country where the
Stanford team played.
Ernie Nevers is the opposite type to
McHose. He will depend mostly on his
slashing, dribbling offensive to get him
in position for a shot. Ernie looks even
faster than he did in his freshman year.
His weight and height, as well as speed,
will all be assets to the big boys' game.
Only injuries could possibly keep the
former fullback from being used regu
larly in the line-up.
Gurdon Steele, when he gets down to
good condition, will keep things moving
around the pivot job. Warren Moody,
a transfer from Fresno State College, is
going to make things hot for Steele, and
at present it looks like an even break.
It is hardly pssible that any one will
oust Dave Oliva out of his steady job a*
guard. Dave has proven to be one of
the best defensive men ever /developed
at Stanford, and every year he has im
proved to a considerable degree; this
year should prove no exception.
The team as a whole is composed of
two heavy men at guards; one fast, the
other a good standing safety. A heavy
man at center; a heavy and light man
at forwards. Both forwards being the
fastest men on the team, there is no
reason to doubt consistent scoring
throughout the season.

have even a greater year than last. Mc-
Hose was one of the best forwards on
the Pacific Coast last year, and his ability
to shoot goals brought comments from
every part of the country where the
Stanford team played.
Ernie Nevers is the opposite type to
McHose. He will depend mostly on his
slashing, dribbling offensive to get him
in position for a shot. Ernie looks even
faster than he did in his freshman year.
His weight and height, as well as speed,
will all be assets to the big boys' game.
Only injuries could possibly keep the
former fullback from being used regu
larly in the line-up.
Gurdon Steele, when he gets down to
good condition, will keep things moving
around the pivot job. Warren Moody,
a transfer from Fresno State College, is
going to make things hot for Steele, and
at present it looks like an even break.
It is hardly pssible that any one will
oust Dave Oliva out of his steady job a*
guard. Dave has proven to be one of
the best defensive men ever /developed
at Stanford, and every year he has im
proved to a considerable degree; this
year should prove no exception.
The team as a whole is composed of
two heavy men at guards; one fast, the
other a good standing safety. A heavy
man at center; a heavy and light man
at forwards. Both forwards being the
fastest men on the team, there is no
reason to doubt consistent scoring
throughout the season.
Stanford's 1924 basketball team is
slowly developing some semblance of
strength and unity, under the constant
attention of Andy Kerr.
The squad is holding regular practice
every night in the Pavilion, with some
twenty-five or thirty players reporting.
In a scrimmage with the freshman
team yesterday afternoon the varsity
showed possibilities of becoming a fast
defensive and offensive aggregation.
Many goals were missed, but the
guarding and passing were above par
for this early in the season.
The lirst team men started with Gur
don Steele at center. "Nip" McHose, and
Ernie Nevers at forwards, Dave Oliva
and Harry Shipkey at guards. Ray Mc-
Burney, who replaced Shipkey shortly
after the scrimmage had begun, looks to

be one of the most promising of the
guard candidates.
He should easily develop into the lack
ing running guard which was made nec
essary because of the loss of Fred
Anderson.
"Nip" McHose is swiftly hitting his
old stride. His dodging, squirming, and
clusivencss are the features of every
practice, and it looks as if "Nip" will
have even a greater year than last. Mc-
