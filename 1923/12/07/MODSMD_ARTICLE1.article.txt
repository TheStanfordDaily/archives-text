# STORMY SESSION IS IN STORE FOR COAST CONFERENCE
## Representatives Will Discuss Post-Season Games at Conclave Today 
### Douglas Meservey 
The Pacific Coast Conference Ath
letic Committee opens what promises
to be a stormy meeting today at
Hcrkeley to consider questions relating
to Pacific Coast intercollegiate ath
letics.
Dr. W. H. Barrow left this morning
to attend the gathering as one of Stan
ford's representatives. Paul Davis, the
other representative, left yesterday to
be present at a meeting held today of
the graduate managers of the institu
tions represented at the conference.
To Discuss Post-Season Games.
According to Dr. Barrow ,only one
question—outside of the routine mat
ters —will be of important, but this in
itself, has prospects of causing a rup
ture among the conference delegates.
This will be the discussion on post
season games, renewed from last year
and brought into the limelight of late
by the decision of the University of
Washington to accept an offer of the
Navy to play New Year's Day at Pasa
dena. contrary to a more or less defi
nite policy adopted last year in re
gard to post-season games.
The policy, or ruling, was to the ef
fect that the conference was against
the engaging of a conference member
in a post-season game that was man
; aged or promoted by other than col
; lege or conference authorities.
Problem Arose Last Year.
It will be remembered that the same
| situation arose last year, after Stan-
I ford had scheduled a Christmas game
with Pittsburg, and assumed serious
proportions when Stanford withdrew
from the conference because of disap
; proval registered by a majority of the
members. However, an official com
promise was effected by both parties
and Stanford re-entered the confer
ence.
The opinions upon the matter seem
to be split three ways this year. Cali
; fornia is dead-set against post-season
! games while, on the other hand, U. S.
C. and Washington, particularly the
latter since its acceptance of the Navy
game offer, will probably defend the
opposite view in favor of the games.
| Stanford and the other members, how-
I ever, up to this time, have been con
j tent to sit back and look on, putting
j forth no definite policies.
National Committee Problem.
Another question which will receive
i consideration is the fact that the con
ference has no representation on the
, national rules committee which means
that the Pacific coast has absolutely no
| voice in the making or interpretation
; of rules for intercollegiate athletics.
I Among the minor questions to be
| dealt with are: The framing of the
1924 schedules, freshman eligibility
' rules and the advisability of freshman
j intercollegiate competition, the encour
; agement of minor sports, uniform con
tracts for games, and amount to be
| paid football officials.
Tomorrow evening, a banquet will be
j given the attending delegates and man
j agers by the University of California
j student body. This will be held in
I Berkeley and will close the conference
meeting.

The Pacific Coast Conference Ath
letic Committee opens what promises
to be a stormy meeting today at
Hcrkeley to consider questions relating
to Pacific Coast intercollegiate ath
letics.
Dr. W. H. Barrow left this morning
to attend the gathering as one of Stan
ford's representatives. Paul Davis, the
other representative, left yesterday to
be present at a meeting held today of
the graduate managers of the institu
tions represented at the conference.
To Discuss Post-Season Games.
According to Dr. Barrow ,only one
question—outside of the routine mat
ters —will be of important, but this in
itself, has prospects of causing a rup
ture among the conference delegates.
This will be the discussion on post
season games, renewed from last year
and brought into the limelight of late
by the decision of the University of
Washington to accept an offer of the
Navy to play New Year's Day at Pasa
dena. contrary to a more or less defi
nite policy adopted last year in re
gard to post-season games.
The policy, or ruling, was to the ef
fect that the conference was against
the engaging of a conference member
in a post-season game that was man
; aged or promoted by other than col
; lege or conference authorities.
Problem Arose Last Year.
It will be remembered that the same
| situation arose last year, after Stan-
I ford had scheduled a Christmas game
with Pittsburg, and assumed serious
proportions when Stanford withdrew
from the conference because of disap
; proval registered by a majority of the
members. However, an official com
promise was effected by both parties
and Stanford re-entered the confer
ence.
The opinions upon the matter seem
to be split three ways this year. Cali
; fornia is dead-set against post-season
! games while, on the other hand, U. S.
C. and Washington, particularly the
latter since its acceptance of the Navy
game offer, will probably defend the
opposite view in favor of the games.
| Stanford and the other members, how-
I ever, up to this time, have been con
j tent to sit back and look on, putting
j forth no definite policies.
National Committee Problem.
Another question which will receive
i consideration is the fact that the con
ference has no representation on the
, national rules committee which means
that the Pacific coast has absolutely no
| voice in the making or interpretation
; of rules for intercollegiate athletics.
I Among the minor questions to be
| dealt with are: The framing of the
1924 schedules, freshman eligibility
' rules and the advisability of freshman
j intercollegiate competition, the encour
; agement of minor sports, uniform con
tracts for games, and amount to be
| paid football officials.
Tomorrow evening, a banquet will be
j given the attending delegates and man
j agers by the University of California
j student body. This will be held in
