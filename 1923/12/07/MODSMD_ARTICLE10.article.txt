# CAPTAIN APPLEJACK, PIRATES WILL WEAVE COLORFUL STORY OF ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE
## Marjorie Allen and Aileene Burks Considered Dramatic "Finds"; 1926 Cast Is Promising 
### Allan Charles 
M "Captain Applejack" will be presented tonight in the Assembly hall at 8:20.
- The play, which is a romantic comedy by William Hackett, is recognized as a
* fine piece of entertainment; and the sophomore cast is neither ordinary in
ability nor lacks experience to handle the humor and emotional situations.
: The class of 1926 comes to dramatic distinetion early in its career. Lloyd
Nolan and Delmer Daves, who carry the heaviest male roles, are already
- beyond the sophomore period of the acting school, having been tried last
year in leading roles.
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks Are Finds
The attention of the audience tonight should be divided between Marjorie
Allen and Aileene Burks, who are known in the vulgar tongue as possible
I "finds." They have the opportunity (and the dress rehearsals suggest the

decided tendency) to exemplify in absorbing fashion two distinct forms of
feminine charm.
Poppy Faire—Marjorie Allen
The sincerity of Marjorie Allen's acting in this ingenue part and as heroine
of the play, is surely the most refreshing element of "Captain Applejack."
Her delightful boyishness as Applejack's cabinboy makes this the most
attractive and distinctive of her several roles.
Anna Valeska—Aileene Burks
There is intensity in all of Anna Valeska's scenes. Aileene Burks gives a
fine emotional portrayal and handles remarkably well some really passionate
acting. She comes through all her scenes well. Most to be remembered is
her adventure with Applejack in the ship's cabin In the second act.
Ambrose Applejohn—Lloyd Nolan
Although this part is intended for a man of forty-five years, Nolan interprets
is in the juvenile as a youth of the upper twenties. His portrayal is well done
throughout. To the character of the pirate captain, he adapts himself the best.
Ivan Borolsky—Delmer Daves
Daves, the villain, appears as the most seasoned' and reliable of the


The butler has his own standard of etiquette for the treatment of strange
Russian women who visit country homes in the dead of night—and then faint.
Players from left to right are: A. Grove Day, Lloyd Nolan, Aileene Burks,
and Mary-Virginia Dungan. ,
sophomore players. His facial expression offers more subtle changes than a
stock villain; and in all three acts he works successfully for dramatic in
tensity, which is the large piece of the duty of Ivan, besides that of playing
the dark cards.
Mrs. Whatcombe —Miriam Ebright
As the proud mistress of the ancestral home of Ambrose Applejohn,
Miriam Ebright secures effectively the regal bearing which is her paramount
function.
Mrs. Pengard—Patrice Nauman
Patrice Nauman is probably the most perfect fit of the cast and handles well
the most complete transition of character required by the comedy.
Mr. Pengard—Kenneth Chantry
Chantry, who is one of the more experienced of the players, has the duty
of impressing the audience with mystery. In the first act, especially, he
helps form the atmosphere of expectancy.
Lush—A. Grove Day
Day seems to be a butler with a personality which carries him beyond the
difficult-to-avoid "stick" class. He lacks only the weather-worn features of
the Applejohn home, which he seems to have overlooked.
Mary Virginia Dungan as Palmer is a very attractive servant for any
audience to follow. The breezy juvenile, Johnny Jason, is interpreted by
John Deffebach in a satisfying manner as may be also said of Dennet, taken
by George Frazier.
Costumes Are Stunning
The costumes, which have been arranged under direction of Alfrida Poco,
are more than unusually stunning, as both their color and the bills indicate.
Chrysella Dunker is in charge of the general art work of the production, Fred
Hughes is the stage manager, John Dillman will control the properties, and 1
Hume West will run the switches.
The Background of the Play
Having romance and adventure as the powerful motive of the play, William
Hackett, the author, has cleverly woven a thrilling adventure in with an
unusual romance. Hackett, in working out his theme, has struck deep into
human nature, for who has not felt the urge of a'dventure or the need of
romance? He places his main character, Ambrose Applejohn, in a stately old
English mansion, ties him down with ancestral traditions, and then proceeds
to inflame him with the desire to throw off the shackles, sell his home, and
seek the unknown. Ambrose, in unburdening his soul to Poppy, his ward,
brings to light this great surge of discontent that is sweeping through him.
Ambrose Craves Romance
"All my life I've lived in a back-water, Romance has passed me by. I've
only read of it in books. I've never even felt the need of it, but now I realize
that it is the one thing worth living for. That searching for it is the only
way to spend your time.
"As Jason said to me, you are not selling this house for money—you are
trading it for the lure of the open road —the gypsy quarter in Seville —a
moonlight night in Tanquier, the Mysterious East —Adventure—Romance!
"I crave adventure, Poppy—l should like to match my wits against an arch
villain —and then —love at first sight—l want to rescue a beautiful young
woman —from some terrible danger—preferably a foreign Princess."

sophomore players. His facial expression offers more subtle changes than a
stock villain; and in all three acts he works successfully for dramatic in
tensity, which is the large piece of the duty of Ivan, besides that of playing
the dark cards.
Mrs. Whatcombe —Miriam Ebright
As the proud mistress of the ancestral home of Ambrose Applejohn,
Miriam Ebright secures effectively the regal bearing which is her paramount
function.
Mrs. Pengard—Patrice Nauman
Patrice Nauman is probably the most perfect fit of the cast and handles well
the most complete transition of character required by the comedy.
Mr. Pengard—Kenneth Chantry
Chantry, who is one of the more experienced of the players, has the duty
of impressing the audience with mystery. In the first act, especially, he
helps form the atmosphere of expectancy.
Lush—A. Grove Day
Day seems to be a butler with a personality which carries him beyond the
difficult-to-avoid "stick" class. He lacks only the weather-worn features of
the Applejohn home, which he seems to have overlooked.
Mary Virginia Dungan as Palmer is a very attractive servant for any
audience to follow. The breezy juvenile, Johnny Jason, is interpreted by
John Deffebach in a satisfying manner as may be also said of Dennet, taken
by George Frazier.
Costumes Are Stunning
The costumes, which have been arranged under direction of Alfrida Poco,
are more than unusually stunning, as both their color and the bills indicate.
Chrysella Dunker is in charge of the general art work of the production, Fred
Hughes is the stage manager, John Dillman will control the properties, and 1
Hume West will run the switches.
The Background of the Play
Having romance and adventure as the powerful motive of the play, William
Hackett, the author, has cleverly woven a thrilling adventure in with an
unusual romance. Hackett, in working out his theme, has struck deep into
human nature, for who has not felt the urge of a'dventure or the need of
romance? He places his main character, Ambrose Applejohn, in a stately old
English mansion, ties him down with ancestral traditions, and then proceeds
to inflame him with the desire to throw off the shackles, sell his home, and
seek the unknown. Ambrose, in unburdening his soul to Poppy, his ward,
brings to light this great surge of discontent that is sweeping through him.
Ambrose Craves Romance
"All my life I've lived in a back-water, Romance has passed me by. I've
only read of it in books. I've never even felt the need of it, but now I realize
that it is the one thing worth living for. That searching for it is the only
way to spend your time.
"As Jason said to me, you are not selling this house for money—you are
trading it for the lure of the open road —the gypsy quarter in Seville —a
moonlight night in Tanquier, the Mysterious East —Adventure—Romance!
"I crave adventure, Poppy—l should like to match my wits against an arch
villain —and then —love at first sight—l want to rescue a beautiful young
woman —from some terrible danger—preferably a foreign Princess."
M "Captain Applejack" will be presented tonight in the Assembly hall at 8:20.
- The play, which is a romantic comedy by William Hackett, is recognized as a
* fine piece of entertainment; and the sophomore cast is neither ordinary in
ability nor lacks experience to handle the humor and emotional situations.
: The class of 1926 comes to dramatic distinetion early in its career. Lloyd
Nolan and Delmer Daves, who carry the heaviest male roles, are already
- beyond the sophomore period of the acting school, having been tried last
year in leading roles.
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks Are Finds
The attention of the audience tonight should be divided between Marjorie
Allen and Aileene Burks, who are known in the vulgar tongue as possible
I "finds." They have the opportunity (and the dress rehearsals suggest the

decided tendency) to exemplify in absorbing fashion two distinct forms of
feminine charm.
Poppy Faire—Marjorie Allen
The sincerity of Marjorie Allen's acting in this ingenue part and as heroine
of the play, is surely the most refreshing element of "Captain Applejack."
Her delightful boyishness as Applejack's cabinboy makes this the most
attractive and distinctive of her several roles.
Anna Valeska—Aileene Burks
There is intensity in all of Anna Valeska's scenes. Aileene Burks gives a
fine emotional portrayal and handles remarkably well some really passionate
acting. She comes through all her scenes well. Most to be remembered is
her adventure with Applejack in the ship's cabin In the second act.
Ambrose Applejohn—Lloyd Nolan
Although this part is intended for a man of forty-five years, Nolan interprets
is in the juvenile as a youth of the upper twenties. His portrayal is well done
throughout. To the character of the pirate captain, he adapts himself the best.

The Background of the Play
Having romance and adventure as the powerful motive of the play, William
Hackett, the author, has cleverly woven a thrilling adventure in with an
unusual romance. Hackett, in working out his theme, has struck deep into
human nature, for who has not felt the urge of a'dventure or the need of
romance? He places his main character, Ambrose Applejohn, in a stately old
English mansion, ties him down with ancestral traditions, and then proceeds
to inflame him with the desire to throw off the shackles, sell his home, and
seek the unknown. Ambrose, in unburdening his soul to Poppy, his ward,
brings to light this great surge of discontent that is sweeping through him.
Ambrose Craves Romance
"All my life I've lived in a back-water, Romance has passed me by. I've
only read of it in books. I've never even felt the need of it, but now I realize
that it is the one thing worth living for. That searching for it is the only
way to spend your time.
"As Jason said to me, you are not selling this house for money—you are
trading it for the lure of the open road —the gypsy quarter in Seville —a
moonlight night in Tanquier, the Mysterious East —Adventure—Romance!
"I crave adventure, Poppy—l should like to match my wits against an arch
villain —and then —love at first sight—l want to rescue a beautiful young
woman —from some terrible danger—preferably a foreign Princess."
M "Captain Applejack" will be presented tonight in the Assembly hall at 8:20.
- The play, which is a romantic comedy by William Hackett, is recognized as a
* fine piece of entertainment; and the sophomore cast is neither ordinary in
ability nor lacks experience to handle the humor and emotional situations.
: The class of 1926 comes to dramatic distinetion early in its career. Lloyd
Nolan and Delmer Daves, who carry the heaviest male roles, are already
- beyond the sophomore period of the acting school, having been tried last
year in leading roles.
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks Are Finds
The attention of the audience tonight should be divided between Marjorie
Allen and Aileene Burks, who are known in the vulgar tongue as possible
I "finds." They have the opportunity (and the dress rehearsals suggest the

decided tendency) to exemplify in absorbing fashion two distinct forms of
feminine charm.
Poppy Faire—Marjorie Allen
The sincerity of Marjorie Allen's acting in this ingenue part and as heroine
of the play, is surely the most refreshing element of "Captain Applejack."
Her delightful boyishness as Applejack's cabinboy makes this the most
attractive and distinctive of her several roles.
Anna Valeska—Aileene Burks
There is intensity in all of Anna Valeska's scenes. Aileene Burks gives a
fine emotional portrayal and handles remarkably well some really passionate
acting. She comes through all her scenes well. Most to be remembered is
her adventure with Applejack in the ship's cabin In the second act.
Ambrose Applejohn—Lloyd Nolan
Although this part is intended for a man of forty-five years, Nolan interprets
is in the juvenile as a youth of the upper twenties. His portrayal is well done
throughout. To the character of the pirate captain, he adapts himself the best.
Ivan Borolsky—Delmer Daves
Daves, the villain, appears as the most seasoned' and reliable of the

Russian women who visit country homes in the dead of night—and then faint.

sophomore players. His facial expression offers more subtle changes than a
stock villain; and in all three acts he works successfully for dramatic in
tensity, which is the large piece of the duty of Ivan, besides that of playing
the dark cards.
Mrs. Whatcombe —Miriam Ebright
As the proud mistress of the ancestral home of Ambrose Applejohn,
Miriam Ebright secures effectively the regal bearing which is her paramount
function.
Mrs. Pengard—Patrice Nauman
Patrice Nauman is probably the most perfect fit of the cast and handles well
the most complete transition of character required by the comedy.
Mr. Pengard—Kenneth Chantry
Chantry, who is one of the more experienced of the players, has the duty
of impressing the audience with mystery. In the first act, especially, he
helps form the atmosphere of expectancy.
Lush—A. Grove Day
Day seems to be a butler with a personality which carries him beyond the
difficult-to-avoid "stick" class. He lacks only the weather-worn features of
the Applejohn home, which he seems to have overlooked.
Mary Virginia Dungan as Palmer is a very attractive servant for any
audience to follow. The breezy juvenile, Johnny Jason, is interpreted by
John Deffebach in a satisfying manner as may be also said of Dennet, taken
by George Frazier.
Costumes Are Stunning
The costumes, which have been arranged under direction of Alfrida Poco,
are more than unusually stunning, as both their color and the bills indicate.
