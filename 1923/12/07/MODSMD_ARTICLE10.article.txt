### Allan Charles 
M "Captain Applejack" will be presented tonight in the Assembly hall at 8:20.
- The play, which is a romantic comedy by William Hackett, is recognized as a
* fine piece of entertainment; and the sophomore cast is neither ordinary in
ability nor lacks experience to handle the humor and emotional situations.
: The class of 1926 comes to dramatic distinetion early in its career. Lloyd
Nolan and Delmer Daves, who carry the heaviest male roles, are already
- beyond the sophomore period of the acting school, having been tried last
year in leading roles.
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks Are Finds
The attention of the audience tonight should be divided between Marjorie
Allen and Aileene Burks, who are known in the vulgar tongue as possible
I "finds." They have the opportunity (and the dress rehearsals suggest the

decided tendency) to exemplify in absorbing fashion two distinct forms of
feminine charm.
Poppy Faire—Marjorie Allen
The sincerity of Marjorie Allen's acting in this ingenue part and as heroine
of the play, is surely the most refreshing element of "Captain Applejack."
Her delightful boyishness as Applejack's cabinboy makes this the most
attractive and distinctive of her several roles.
Anna Valeska—Aileene Burks
There is intensity in all of Anna Valeska's scenes. Aileene Burks gives a
fine emotional portrayal and handles remarkably well some really passionate
acting. She comes through all her scenes well. Most to be remembered is
her adventure with Applejack in the ship's cabin In the second act.
Ambrose Applejohn—Lloyd Nolan
Although this part is intended for a man of forty-five years, Nolan interprets
is in the juvenile as a youth of the upper twenties. His portrayal is well done
throughout. To the character of the pirate captain, he adapts himself the best.
Ivan Borolsky—Delmer Daves
Daves, the villain, appears as the most seasoned' and reliable of the


The butler has his own standard of etiquette for the treatment of strange
Russian women who visit country homes in the dead of night—and then faint.
Players from left to right are: A. Grove Day, Lloyd Nolan, Aileene Burks,
