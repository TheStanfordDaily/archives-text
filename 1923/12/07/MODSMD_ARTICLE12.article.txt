# THORP NAMES ALL-AMERICAN
## Nichols, Blewett of California; Anderson of U. S. C. Are Given Positions 
### 
The Pacific coast received recogni
tion in the selection of an All-Amcrican
football eleven yesterday by Tom
Thorp, well-known eastern writer and
referee. The three mentioned by
Thorp are Don Nichols (California),
Bill Blewett (California), and Norman
Anderson (U. S. O
While Blewett and Anderson re
ceived only passing mention, Nichols
was rated by Thorp as one of the two
best halfbacks in the country and was
paired with Grange of Illinois at that
position. *
Praises Don Nichols.
"In Nichols, he (Andy Smith) gives
the game one of the best present day
backs," says Thorp. "Nichols is a hard
runner with the ball .... and is
never down until at least two or three
rivals are piled upon him.
Thorp's mythical eleven as it would
go into action, is composed of Ecklund
(Minnesota), and Mcßae (Syracuse),
at ends; Milstead (Yale), and Bach
(Notre Dame), as tackles; Welsch
(Colgate), and McMillan (Illinois), as j
guards; Garbisch (Army), as center; j
Pfann (Cornell), for quarter; Grange
(Illinois), and Nichols (California), as I
halves; and Mallory (Yale), as full i

and captain.
Horrell Is Ignored.
"Babe" Horrell of California, rated
by the majority of sports critics on the
coast as All-American timber, was re
fused even favorable mention by
Thorp.
Thorp ,aside from personal selec
tions, commented upon western and
eastern elevens and added his voice to
those endeavoring to compare the two
types.
"The west advanced with rapid
strides (in the introduction of the for
ward pass) because of its grasping of
the great possibilities of the open
; game," says Thorp. "It has been only
! of late that the forward pass was made
an offensive weapon by our big east
ern schools «f learning.
"The writer has made an intensive j
I study of conditions in the East. West,
i and Pacific coast sections. After a
personal observation of the important
games in each section, we are ready
to say that the East would have plenty
to do to beat Michigan, Minnesota, or
( California in any intersectional con
| test that might be arranged. Andy
Smith's California pupils displayed a
game of ball that makes them figure
! witli the best at the game."

rivals are piled upon him.
Thorp's mythical eleven as it would
go into action, is composed of Ecklund
(Minnesota), and Mcßae (Syracuse),
at ends; Milstead (Yale), and Bach
(Notre Dame), as tackles; Welsch
(Colgate), and McMillan (Illinois), as j
guards; Garbisch (Army), as center; j
Pfann (Cornell), for quarter; Grange

Horrell Is Ignored.
"Babe" Horrell of California, rated
by the majority of sports critics on the
coast as All-American timber, was re
fused even favorable mention by
Thorp.
Thorp ,aside from personal selec
tions, commented upon western and
eastern elevens and added his voice to
those endeavoring to compare the two
types.
"The west advanced with rapid
strides (in the introduction of the for
ward pass) because of its grasping of
the great possibilities of the open
; game," says Thorp. "It has been only
! of late that the forward pass was made
an offensive weapon by our big east
ern schools «f learning.
"The writer has made an intensive j
I study of conditions in the East. West,
i and Pacific coast sections. After a
personal observation of the important
games in each section, we are ready
to say that the East would have plenty
to do to beat Michigan, Minnesota, or
( California in any intersectional con
| test that might be arranged. Andy
Smith's California pupils displayed a
game of ball that makes them figure
! witli the best at the game."
The Pacific coast received recogni
tion in the selection of an All-Amcrican
football eleven yesterday by Tom
Thorp, well-known eastern writer and
referee. The three mentioned by
Thorp are Don Nichols (California),
Bill Blewett (California), and Norman
Anderson (U. S. O
While Blewett and Anderson re
ceived only passing mention, Nichols
was rated by Thorp as one of the two
best halfbacks in the country and was
paired with Grange of Illinois at that
position. *
Praises Don Nichols.
"In Nichols, he (Andy Smith) gives
the game one of the best present day
backs," says Thorp. "Nichols is a hard
runner with the ball .... and is
never down until at least two or three
rivals are piled upon him.
