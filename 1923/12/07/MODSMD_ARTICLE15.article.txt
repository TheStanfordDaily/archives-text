# STANFORD SOCCER VARSITY READY FOR OLYMPIC CLUB TILT
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team will
match its offensive and defensive with
the Olympic Club outfit on the Old
soccer field turf tomorrow afternoon
at 3 o'clock.
The varsity was slow in getting
started this season, since Coach Harry
Maloney had to develop an almost
completely new team. The American
i. Legion and Sons of Norway met de
feat at the hands of Stanford hut the
j Cardinal eleven dropped four other
close games to league opponents. The
i Olympic Club stands first in the Uni
versity and Club Soccer League in a
tie with the Viking outfit.
Victory Will Have Bearing
A victory for the Redshirts will show
how fast the eleven has progressed
since the opening of the season. Ma
loney believes that advancement will
continue so that the varsity will de
feat the California team when it plays
its second game with the 13ears on
I February 12.
All-Stars to Be Selected
i Several members of the Selection
Committee of the California Soccer
Association will attend the game to
| look over the team with a view of se
i lecting men for the Northern Califor
nia All-Star team. This aggregation
will tackle a similar group of South
ern California stars in the South dur
ing the Christmas vacation. Men for
the northern outfit will be selected
from San Francisco, Bay region, Sac
i ramento, and Grass Valley teams,
J which number nearly seventy-five. If
Stanford can place even one man on
, the squad of fifteen which will go
South it will show that the varsity
compares favorably with other coast
teams.
The freshman team will go to San
Anselmo to play the San Anselmo sem
inary outfit tomorrow afternoon at the
same time as the varsity meets the
Olympic Club here. Since the first
year men are playing nearly as good
soccer as the varsity was at the time
it defeated the seminary team, they
should return victorious.
