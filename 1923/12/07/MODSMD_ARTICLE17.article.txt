# THE 						FIRST MOVE
## 
### 
At various times different people have ventured the idea that it would
be a good thing if the faculty and the students could get together. Where
upon the venturesome person gets severely sat upon, and is told that the
students and the faculty are together too much already, and who wants
to have anything to do with some of those old guys anyway?
At which point the current originator of the idea gives up in disgust.
All concerned consider the question settled—which it most distinctly is
not.
Occasionally one hears from the more bald-headed of the alumni of
the fellowship between faculty and students which existed on the Farm
when the Universityy consisted of an incomplete Inner Quad. One listens
and marvels at the tales of professors who used to invite students to their
houses, go with them on various expeditions, and generally make them
selves one of the gang without any attempt at upholding false dignity.
Then one tries to think of the faculty members who do the same
things now, and doesn't get through the fingers of one hand before the
total is reached. *
There are several reasons for this split in what should be a united
family; the first is the fault of the students, who are only slowly growing
away from the current collegiate icka of 1910, in which the undergraduate
was supposed to exist for the purpose of making faculty lives miserable,
and vice versa; the second is also blameable on the students, because their
own natural fear of ridicule prevents their becoming friendly with those
professors they would really like to laiow.
Upon the faculty, though, rests the chief blame for the present keep
your-place-and-l'll-keep-mine attitude. For a student to come up to a
professor, even one who is known to be human, and announce that he
would like to become better acquainted would be absurd. Students recog
nize it as such, and so would the faculty if the students didn't.
If there is to be any of the real friendship, any offering of a touch of
home-life to men miles from their own families and friends, any attempt
to work in common harmony, the first move must come from the indi
vidual members of the faculty.
A man who spends his time telling how talented his friends are usually
has a pretty good opinion of himself.
The person who tells the truth because he says it is easier may be
trusted further than the one who makes a point of capitalizing the word
"tuty,"
To the man who lias not studying for finals: how much do you
want for your pipe, room decorations, and ten-ride book ?

own natural fear of ridicule prevents their becoming friendly with those
professors they would really like to laiow.
Upon the faculty, though, rests the chief blame for the present keep
your-place-and-l'll-keep-mine attitude. For a student to come up to a
professor, even one who is known to be human, and announce that he
would like to become better acquainted would be absurd. Students recog
nize it as such, and so would the faculty if the students didn't.
If there is to be any of the real friendship, any offering of a touch of
home-life to men miles from their own families and friends, any attempt
to work in common harmony, the first move must come from the indi
vidual members of the faculty.
A man who spends his time telling how talented his friends are usually
has a pretty good opinion of himself.
The person who tells the truth because he says it is easier may be
trusted further than the one who makes a point of capitalizing the word
"tuty,"
To the man who lias not studying for finals: how much do you
want for your pipe, room decorations, and ten-ride book ?
At various times different people have ventured the idea that it would
be a good thing if the faculty and the students could get together. Where
upon the venturesome person gets severely sat upon, and is told that the
students and the faculty are together too much already, and who wants
to have anything to do with some of those old guys anyway?
At which point the current originator of the idea gives up in disgust.
All concerned consider the question settled—which it most distinctly is
not.
Occasionally one hears from the more bald-headed of the alumni of
the fellowship between faculty and students which existed on the Farm
when the Universityy consisted of an incomplete Inner Quad. One listens
and marvels at the tales of professors who used to invite students to their
houses, go with them on various expeditions, and generally make them
selves one of the gang without any attempt at upholding false dignity.
Then one tries to think of the faculty members who do the same
things now, and doesn't get through the fingers of one hand before the
total is reached. *
There are several reasons for this split in what should be a united
family; the first is the fault of the students, who are only slowly growing
away from the current collegiate icka of 1910, in which the undergraduate
was supposed to exist for the purpose of making faculty lives miserable,
and vice versa; the second is also blameable on the students, because their
own natural fear of ridicule prevents their becoming friendly with those
professors they would really like to laiow.
