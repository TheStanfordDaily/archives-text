# TEMPLETON'S TRACK MEN WILL COMPETE TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton's track and field
charges will compete in the first regu

tomorrow morning at. 10:30, giving the
cinder path aspirants their first oppor

Van Judah, track captain, with Sher

in meets last year as did Richardson
for the first year men. The time will
probably not be fast.
