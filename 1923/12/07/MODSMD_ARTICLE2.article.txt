# TEMPLETON'S TRACK MEN WILL COMPETE TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
"Dink" Templeton's track and field
charges will compete in the first regu
lar fall meet on the varsity track field
tomorrow morning at. 10:30, giving the
cinder path aspirants their first oppor
tunity to disclose their capabilities.
All men enrolled in the* University are
eligible to compete. This competiton
will take the place of the regular Fri
day afternoon informal meet.
All events will be run with the pos
sible exception of the mile and two
mile runs, which may be eliminated
on account of the cross-country match
with California yesterday afternoon,
in which the distance men competed.
Hale Good Sprinter
Male is the outstanding sprinter in
the 100-yard dash, covering the dis
tance regularly this fall in 0:10 1-5
seconds. With him will be Campbell,
Caspar, and Miller, all fast men, who
should reach the tape close together
and in nearly the time made by Hale.
The same men will compete in the
220-yard dash and should finish just
as closely.
Van Judah, track captain, with Sher
mund, Storey, Nixon, and Coverly will
enter the 440-yard dash and, while
Van Judah should place first, pre-sea
son form makes the outcome doubtful.
Richardson. Daly, Dole, Smith, Mcin
tosh, Swayne, and Pastorius will show
their condition in the half-mile run.
Swayne and Dole both showed up well
in meets last year as did Richardson
for the first year men. The time will
probably not be fast.

Leistner in Hurdles

The hurdles will be run by Leistner,
who pressed Falk closely in these
events in the California meet last
year; Boles, freshman star of last
year; and Wells, a transfer now eligi
ble for varsity competition. Richards,
Campbell, and Wankowski will heave
the shot and discus while Farish will
throw the javelih.
In the broad-jump, Mcßae, Wells,
Wright, and Bragg will vie for honors,
and Dennis and Schofleld will compete
in the pole vault. Kenmitzer, Work,
and Anderson will clear the bar in
the high jump.

Three crews representing three col
leges of the University of Washington

probably not be fast.

Leistner in Hurdles

The hurdles will be run by Leistner,
who pressed Falk closely in these
events in the California meet last
year; Boles, freshman star of last
year; and Wells, a transfer now eligi
ble for varsity competition. Richards,
Campbell, and Wankowski will heave
the shot and discus while Farish will
throw the javelih.
In the broad-jump, Mcßae, Wells,
Wright, and Bragg will vie for honors,
and Dennis and Schofleld will compete
in the pole vault. Kenmitzer, Work,
and Anderson will clear the bar in
the high jump.

Three crews representing three col
leges of the University of Washington
recently held a test crew race which
resulted in a victory for the Engineer
ing-Law shell.
"Dink" Templeton's track and field
charges will compete in the first regu
lar fall meet on the varsity track field
tomorrow morning at. 10:30, giving the
cinder path aspirants their first oppor
tunity to disclose their capabilities.
All men enrolled in the* University are
eligible to compete. This competiton
will take the place of the regular Fri
day afternoon informal meet.
All events will be run with the pos
sible exception of the mile and two
mile runs, which may be eliminated
on account of the cross-country match
with California yesterday afternoon,
in which the distance men competed.
Hale Good Sprinter
Male is the outstanding sprinter in
the 100-yard dash, covering the dis
tance regularly this fall in 0:10 1-5
seconds. With him will be Campbell,
Caspar, and Miller, all fast men, who
should reach the tape close together
and in nearly the time made by Hale.
The same men will compete in the
220-yard dash and should finish just
as closely.
Van Judah, track captain, with Sher
mund, Storey, Nixon, and Coverly will
enter the 440-yard dash and, while
Van Judah should place first, pre-sea
son form makes the outcome doubtful.
Richardson. Daly, Dole, Smith, Mcin
tosh, Swayne, and Pastorius will show
their condition in the half-mile run.
Swayne and Dole both showed up well
in meets last year as did Richardson
for the first year men. The time will
probably not be fast.
