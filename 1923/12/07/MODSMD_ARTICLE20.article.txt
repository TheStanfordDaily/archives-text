Did you notice that statement of a prison investigator that "not a
single college professor ... is a convicted and imprisoned criminal?"
It used to be the beautiful women the juries grew sentimental and
compassionate over. But times have changed.
NOTICES WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE—No. 1
Excuses For Low Scholarship
Students Handicapped to Report to Scholarship Committee.
The scholarship committee urgently requests that all students in the
University turn in their excuses for poor grades this week, so that those
who prove they could not pass the finals may be excused from them. Those
who expect to get good grades are advised to turn in excuses anyway. The
following will be considered good reasons for poor work: (1) Queening;
(2) Drinking; (3) Swearing; (4) Lack of time to study; (5) Uninteresting
courses; (6) Poor professors; (7) Bridge; (8) Death. The aim of the scholar
ship committee is to get every man, woman, and child through Stanford.
Help us in this aim by handing in your alibis at once.

Of These Things.
