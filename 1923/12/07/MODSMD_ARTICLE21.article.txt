# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## ED WYNN IN "THE PERFECT FOOL," NOW SHOWING AT THE COLUMBIA THEATER, S. F. 
### 
Ed Wynn is literally a perfect
scream in "The Perfect Fool" and
without his efforts the refreshing com
edy would lapse into just a good danc
ing cast, which is not much of a de
terioration after all.
Ed Wynn makes the laughs from
the time he steps on the stage until
he makes his last bow with his face
wreathed in grins and glasses.
Every pther act is a dance skit, a
pageant, or a tableau with some very
pretty dancers. The costumes are
pleasing to the eye and the various
sets contribute to the harmonious
color schemes of the whole play. The
alternate acts are decidedly a happy
foresight since no one can stand two
consecutive acts with Ed Wynn with
out giving one's sides and lungs a rest.
One of the best things one can say
for the show is that there are no jokes
of a questionable variety. It is all per
fectly clean humor; also there are no

plays the nose protector for cheese
eaters which he says will lit the uose
of any nationality.
Ed Wynn shines as the acrobat and
draws a few screams from his famous
patented eating articles. His acts be
fore the curtain with two other char
acters are the real thrillers. Ed Wynn
can do a few stunts himself, ho can
play the piano well, and he can even
sing. But there is nothing which can
surpass his grins and his conventional
spectacles.
