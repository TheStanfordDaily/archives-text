# DEARTH OF ENTRIES POSTPONES JUNIOR POLO CHAMPIONSHIPS
## 
### 
The Junior National water polo
championships to have been held at
Stanford tomorrow have been can
celled by the Pacific Athletic Associa
tion because of lack of entries.
The original list of prospective en
trants included California, Olympic
Club, Neptune, Pacific City, and Stan
ford, but one by one they dropped out,
leaving only Stanford and Pacific City
to compete. However, as a P. A. A.
ruling states that at least three teams
must compete, the championships
were declared postponed until a later
date.
