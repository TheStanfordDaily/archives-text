"Heh!" Ye News Editor shouts
rambunctiously. "We gotta have a
'break' quick."
And so after much investigation,
perusal, and conscientious thought,
here 'tis:
"The news editors of the Daily
Palo Alto now have their own sanc
tum. It's in a corner of the old
office and is surrounded by four
gray walls. There's an opening
with a small sliding door, in one
wall, and on this door, there ap
pears, 'Slide Kelly Sliue.' Through
this opening, the news copy passes
into the hands of the desk editor for
mutilation and nearly complete de
struction.
"On the entrance to the sanctum,
this rather uninviting invitation ap
pears: 'This room is designed to
maintain the peace of His Holiness,
the News Editor, and should not be
invaded without a specific invita
tion. If you consider yourself suf
ficiently important to violate this
rule, you will probably get away
with it—once." •
