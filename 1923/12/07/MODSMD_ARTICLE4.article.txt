# FRESHMAN FIRST AND SECOND FIVES DEFEAT 1925 TEAMS
## Babes Batter Weak Junior Defensives and Win 24-3 and 11-9 
### 
The freshman first and second fives
j defeated the junior quintets last even
' ins in the third night of the inter-class
series, winning 24-3 and 11-9.
An overwhelming defeat was admin
istered by the babe seconds, who put
j forward a better brand of team work
than did the junior five. Repeatedly,
: the freshman forwards broke through
the weak third-year defense with short,
accurate passes.
Southworth, Dunfee, and Cox ac
counted for a majority of the babe
points and Clark proved himself a
| stellar guard with a good deal of speed.
Eva and Stevenson did good work
for the third-year men.
Game Starts Listlessly.
The first team game began with
j neither five exerting itself and both
j unable to retain the ball long. The
half ended 3-0 with the juniors in the
I lead.
A strong rally was made by the
yearlings in the second half and by the
end of the game they had piled up a
two-point margin. The juniors, how
ever, made them fight for every tally
and several times gave the yearling
supporters a scare by running neck
and neck with the freshmen for a few
minutes.
George Good Material.
George, for the freshmen, was the |
main attraction for it was around his
accurate shooting that the babe rally I
was staged. Todd, Holman, and New- 1
house also showed to advantage.
For the juniors, Coen and Eva at
guard. Steward at forward, and Cramer
at center pressed the freshmen at every
opportunity.
