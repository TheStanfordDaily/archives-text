## 
### 
Stanford poloists yesterday defeated
the Thirtieth Infantry quartet of San
Francisco, 7-6 on the highway field, in
the first of a two-game series to be
played at Stanford.
The game was the most hotly con
tested battle the Cardinals have had
this season. John Irwin, playing posi
tion No. 2, was the star of the game,
with 6 of the 7 Stanford scores to his
credit. Tremaine made the remaining
goal in the second period.
Cards Take Lead Early.
At ;he beginning of the game, the
Card took the lead, Irwin scoring two
goals in the first chukker. Lieuten
ant Edgcr made the Presidio team's
first score in the opening period. In
the second, Tremaine and Irwin
brought the count to 4-1 in favor of
the Cardinals. During the remainder
of the game, with the exception of the
sixth, the Infantry held Stanford
scoreless. Irwin made three points in
the sixth bringing the total to 7.
Beginning in the fourth chukker, the
Thirtieth Infantry men drove the ball
between their goal posts once each
period. Captain Scott and Lieutenant
Edger tied for high goal honors, mak
ing two each. Major Weaver and
Lieutenant Beatty knocked in one
apiece in the last half of the game.
The army men played a steadier game
than did the Cards, hut they were un
able to make up for the lead the Stan
ford men took in the first two periods.
Boyle Plays Good Game.
Captain Charles Boyle, Card polo
coach, played at No. 2 position in place
of T remaine. in five of the eight
periods. Captain Boyle was a strong
factor in the Cardinal defense and
more than once drove the ball out of
Stanford territory when the army men
were dashing toward the goal posts.
Irwin Gets Fall.
Irwin was thrown from his horse in
the fourth period when he attempted
to ward off one of the army men, but
he sustained no injury and continued
to play.

ford four and the Thirtieth Infantry
team will be played Saturday after
