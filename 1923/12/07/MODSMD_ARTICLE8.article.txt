# Medicine On Firing Line Of Our Modern Scienceâ€”Dr. Jordan
## 
### 
"The word 'bacteriorology' still
slumbered in the Greek lexicon,its
component parts widely seperated,
when I received the scarcely earned
degree of Doctor of Medicine in
1875," said Dr. Jordan in a talk on
modern medicine at his home last
night.
"We didn't have as much to learn
as the medical students of today. I
had no idea of practicing, but thought
I could teach physiology better if I
learned what they taught the doctors.
"In 1875 medical science was still
in the medieval period. Almost noth
ing of what constitutes modern medi
cine was known. Antiseptic surgery
was unheard of. Nothing more im
portant was done in operations than
cutting off a dog's tail. You could put
tar on that and be sure it would heal.
But a cut an inch deep in any other
place was a gamble whether morti
fication would set in or the patient
would pull through.
Microbes Discovered
"About this time, however, Tyn
dall, the great English physicist,
was making his studies of microbes
at rest, in dust, or floating in air. In
1877. I wrote a review of Tyndall's
'Floating Matter in Air', remarking
that now we were beginning to find
out what our enemies were, we should
be able to fight them. That statement
proved prophetically true; medicine
at present stands on the firing line of
science. In no department of human
knowledge has the forward movement
been more sound or more impressive.
"Lister has shown the amazing re
sults tt>*be derived from clean hands,
pure air, and antiseptics in tho oper
ating room. And Pasteur, greatest of
all these scientists had discovered that
a plant was the cause of mildew in the
silkworms of France. He first prac
tised the theory of segregation at this
time. The net result of all this effort
was the discovery of myriads of ani
mal and plant organisms, too minute
for the naked eye, but readily studied
under the microscope, and easily
reared in artificial cultures. All phe
nomena of fermentation, putrefaction,
and infectious disease were seen to
be due to the presence and growth of
infinitesimal parasites.
"Bad Air" Not Malaria Cause
"It was discovered that not 'bad air'
but the malaria bacillus carried by a
certain kind of mosquito was the
cause of Roman fever. Quinine was
found to be the remedy as it is a
deadly poison to the slender worm
like animal. If these parasites come
in contact with it, it knocks them
stiff. Not very stiff, of course, because
they are so small."
Dr. Jordan deplored the damage
done by the patent medicine men with
the "mother's soothing syrup" of
opium which guaranteed to keep chil
dren quiet. "Yes," said Dr. Jordan,
"and if they gave them enough it
would keep them quiet for good."
Disease Differences
The difference between disease
caused by bacteria and functional dis
orders was explained. Some of these
are imaginary, and the Indian medi
cine man of the north who, by varied
incantations, gets the diseas.e out of a
man into his own mouth and spits it
out as a two-inch trout or a lizard,
can work effective cures. Other func
tional disorders are caused by bad \
habits of diet. Dr. Jordan recom-'
mends that every man who has arrived |
at between 40 and 50 "when the ma-i
chine begins to run down like an old
Ford," go to a hospital on his birth
day and get looked over. "Then he'll
be sure," he said, " 'for the goblins '11
get you if you don't watch out'."
