# What Ho! Campus Kluxers Harken To The Fiery Summons
## 
### 
Rumors concerning activities of the
Ku Klux Klan on the campus seem to
boil down to a semi-official and wholly
insignificant meeting of Klan "pro
spective members," called in the En
gineering building by Robert Burnett,
graduate student in Civil Engineering.
The meeting was held without sanc
tion by University authorities, and
was therefore illegal.
Professor C. B. Wing, head of the
Civil Engineering department, stated
that it was not customary for students
to hold meetings without permission
from his staff, or from the administra
tive officers of the University. None of
these parties were consulted prior to
the meeting, and none have any of
ficial knowledge of it.
Where and How to Sign the Pledge
Burnett, when questioned by a re
porter for the Daily, did not care to
state whether or not the meeting was
held in this building, but in his letter
to the Editor, printed elsewhere, he
refers to the "meeting recently held
in the Engineering building." He also
refused to state whether or not he
was a member of the Klan, and said
that the only constructive measure
during the meeting was his own state
ment that he could tell any interested
person where and how to "sign up"
with the Klan.
About forty attended the meeting.
The President's office states that no
student organization, unless recog
nized by the University authorities,
has any rights whatever in University
buildings, and that no such organiza
tion as the Ku Klux Klan has ever
been authorized here.
A statement from President Wilbur
runs, "It is not my policy to tell stu
dents what they may or may not do,
but we have the right to say what
organizations can use the name of the
University. Any organization of the
Klan on the campus which uses the
name of the University or purports to
be a part of the University through
its membership will find itself in trou
ble with University authorities."
