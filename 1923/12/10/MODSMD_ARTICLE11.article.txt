army team during the past week. Dur
ing the first half the Presidio team threat-1
ened to take the lead in scoring. Though
the score was not as close as in the
Thursday battle, when the Cards won by
a 7-6 score, the army men more than
once had their opponents playing 011 the
defense.
Captain Charles Boyle, Cardinal
mentor, played position No. 1 in seven
of the eight periods and was a strong
factor in the Stanford defense. Ralph
Barby was high goal man of the game,
making three of the six goals for
Stanford. Captain Boyle made two
points and John Irwin one.
Although Stanford took the lead in
the opening chukker when Barby
knocked in for a point, the Infantry
four was able to tie with Stanford in
the fourth with two scorings made by
Lieutenant Edger.
However, Captain Boyle broke the
tie in the fifth period by knocking the
ball through the goal posts twice in
rapid succession. Barby followed with
another point in the sixth and another
in the seventh. Captain Scott of the
army made the last goal for his team
in the seventh. Both teams were score
less in the closing chukker.
Captain Boyle anonunced that be
cause of the poor condition of the
Stanford horses the local team will
play no more games until after the
Christmas vacation. During the past
two weeks the horses have been se
verely overworked in the four hard
games, one of which gave the Cards
the intercollegiate championship title
of the Pacific Coast.
