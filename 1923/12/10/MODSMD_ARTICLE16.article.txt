# MONTANA IS ADMITTED TO CONFERENCE
## Washington And Navy Game Is Approved; Restrictions On Management 
### 
One new member—Montana—admitted
and the post-season game question set
tled is a resume of the important work
accomplished by the Pacific Coast Con
ference, which adjourned its meeting at
Berkeley Saturday evening.
Washington, whose action in sched
uling a game on New Year's with the
Navy eleven without consulting the Con
ference had threatened to disrupt the
Conference, received an O.K. on its game
with the proviso that the event be man
aged by Navy and Washington officials.
The decision of the Conference was
made as follows:
"Resolved, That the Pacific Coast Con
ference approves of a game between the
United States Naval Academy and the
University of Washington to be held on
January 1, 1924, provided that the con
tract for the game shall be made directly
between the two institutions and that the
entire management and control of the
game shall be in the hands of these two
institutions."
The resolution was necessary, in view
of the fact that a ruling was made last
year which forbade post-season games
that were not managed by the conference
or by some member college of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
The University of Montana put for
ward its application, without previous
notice, Saturday evening, and was ac
cepted into the ranks with but a few
hours' debate.
Montana, which has a limited enroll-i
ment of 1500, has been a member of the
Pacific Northwest Conference, which has!
the same rules as the P.C.C., and was ad-;
mitted mainly because of its high scho
lastic requirements.
Of interest to Stanford gridiron fans!
is the 1924 Cardinal schedule, which is as j
follows:
October 18—Oregon at Stanford;!
October 25—Idaho at Idaho; November!
I—open; November B—U. S. C. at Los|
Angeles; November 15—open; Novem-,
ber 22—California at Berkeley.
Just before adjourning Saturday eve-'
ning, a piece of legislation was put!
through which is considered by some as:
the most radical in the history of the |
Conference and which has to do with |
fraternity pledging in high school.
The rule is that no high school student
pledged by a college fraternity while still
in higli school shall be eligible for ath-1
letic competitions on teams of a Con-j
ference member.
Other resolutions adopted by the Con
ference were: Conference athletes will
be permitted to participate on church l
teams; uniform contracts were adopted ;
for use among Conference members;
and salaries were standardized and I
methods of selection adopted lor game
officials.
