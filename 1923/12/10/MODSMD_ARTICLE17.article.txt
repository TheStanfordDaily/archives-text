# RICHMAN CLEARS SIX FEET IN TRACK CONTEST SATURDAY
## Dick Richards Is High Man On Points; Leistner Takes Hurdles 
### 
Fred Richman was the sensation of
the fall track meet on the varsity field
Saturday morning, when he cleared the
bar at 6 feet in the high jump. Richman
is a freshman jumper and never did
better than 5 feet 8 inches before "Dink"
Templeton took him in hand.
Dick Richards was high point man of
the meet, taking first in the shot and
discus, and third in his heat of the 100-
yard dash. He got the shot out 42 feet
and the discus 114 feet.
Swede Leistner was the only varsity
"S" man who participated in the meet.
He had little trouble in winning both of
the hurdle races. He covered the 120
high® in 16 flat and the 220-yard low
hurdles in 25 3-5, both of which are good
early season times.
Art Bragg and Dick Macßae has quite
a light in the broad jump. Bragg man
aged to win on his last jump, going 21
feet 7 inches, which was just an inch bet
ter than Macßae's best jump. Bragg
should add distance to his jumps with a
little more practice, as he is falling back
instead of forward now.
The sprints were won in mediocre
time. The cold morning and the carli
ness of the season must be taken into
consideration, however. Storey, a trans
fer from junior college, took first in the
440 and first in his heat of the century.
He won the quarter in 0:52 2-5, with
! a strong sprint at the end. Mixon, who
I was second, was a score of yards behind. !
