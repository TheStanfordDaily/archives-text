# A 						PERSONAL LETTER
## 
### 
To Mr. Robert Burnett,
Misguided Patriot.
My dear Sir:
Allow us to congratulate you 011 your attempt to establish something
on the campus besides an honor society. Your letter, published according
to your request in another part of this issue of the Daily, sets at rest
several rumors, among them the statement that your meeting was not
given any advance publicity, and that the campus as a whole did not
know of it.
You also request that! no derogatory comment on the Klan be made
until after you have made a speech. This we will adhere to strictly, more,
however, because we believe it impossible to make derogatory comment on
such an organization than because of your request.
We note that you have taken pains to discover the "ideals" of the Klux.
We hope the discovery did not give you as much pain as it has given us.
\s it happens, we have from personal experience learned a lot about
the "ideals" of the Kluxers, through seeing these "ideals"i npractical
operation; and we believe that such things as manipulated ballots, spoils
systems in government offices, such violence as taking men out and
stringing them up until they are almost dead and then telling them to
run along home would provide excellent diversions for the present Stan
ford undergraduates—provided you can get enough sheets to go around.
We could mention all these notable examples, with dates and names,
except that it is hardly appropriate here to bring up the rotten politics of
another state.
Admittedly, though, the situation on the Stanford campus is so bad
that it needs the helpful influences of a gang of sheet-knights who go
about in disguise after dark and break the law to secure the peace.
You seem somewhat doubtful about the University authorities grant
ing you the right to make your speech in the Assembly hall. If they con
tinue this obstinate policy, we would like to make a suggestion : we believe
that you might hold your meeting at the barn which was the scene of the
baseball fight, this being the place where enflamed youths who were also
in the habit of wearing laundry bag coiffures saw fit to gather and ex
press violently their somewhat muddled opinion of other students.
We likewise note that on the cards which you sent out there was a
statement implying that all white, Protestant Christians could join the
order and partake of the "ideals."
This rather definitely expresses the prejudices of the Kluxers, does it
not? We are not sure but what we would agree with you in any move to
refuse to play California until all negros, Jews, or members of the
Knights of Columbus were removed from the line-up; this might elimi
nate some dangerous players, and make "Pop" Warner's chances of a
1924 victory still more certain.
With these arguments to advance, we believe you could secure a large
and enthusiastic audience to listen to your speech, especially if you sent
out cards beforehand to all sophomores and people with sophomore ideas.
Again, my dear sir, allow the Daily Palo Alto to congratulate you on
your attempt to form something that most distincly is NOT an honor
sociey.

several rumors, among them the statement that your meeting was not
given any advance publicity, and that the campus as a whole did not
know of it.
You also request that! no derogatory comment on the Klan be made
until after you have made a speech. This we will adhere to strictly, more,
however, because we believe it impossible to make derogatory comment on
such an organization than because of your request.
We note that you have taken pains to discover the "ideals" of the Klux.
We hope the discovery did not give you as much pain as it has given us.
\s it happens, we have from personal experience learned a lot about
the "ideals" of the Kluxers, through seeing these "ideals"i npractical
operation; and we believe that such things as manipulated ballots, spoils
systems in government offices, such violence as taking men out and
stringing them up until they are almost dead and then telling them to
run along home would provide excellent diversions for the present Stan
ford undergraduates—provided you can get enough sheets to go around.
We could mention all these notable examples, with dates and names,
except that it is hardly appropriate here to bring up the rotten politics of
another state.
Admittedly, though, the situation on the Stanford campus is so bad
that it needs the helpful influences of a gang of sheet-knights who go
about in disguise after dark and break the law to secure the peace.
You seem somewhat doubtful about the University authorities grant
ing you the right to make your speech in the Assembly hall. If they con
tinue this obstinate policy, we would like to make a suggestion : we believe
that you might hold your meeting at the barn which was the scene of the
baseball fight, this being the place where enflamed youths who were also
in the habit of wearing laundry bag coiffures saw fit to gather and ex
press violently their somewhat muddled opinion of other students.
We likewise note that on the cards which you sent out there was a
statement implying that all white, Protestant Christians could join the
order and partake of the "ideals."
This rather definitely expresses the prejudices of the Kluxers, does it
not? We are not sure but what we would agree with you in any move to
refuse to play California until all negros, Jews, or members of the
Knights of Columbus were removed from the line-up; this might elimi
nate some dangerous players, and make "Pop" Warner's chances of a
1924 victory still more certain.
With these arguments to advance, we believe you could secure a large
and enthusiastic audience to listen to your speech, especially if you sent
out cards beforehand to all sophomores and people with sophomore ideas.
Again, my dear sir, allow the Daily Palo Alto to congratulate you on
your attempt to form something that most distincly is NOT an honor
sociey.
To Mr. Robert Burnett,
Misguided Patriot.
My dear Sir:
Allow us to congratulate you 011 your attempt to establish something
on the campus besides an honor society. Your letter, published according
to your request in another part of this issue of the Daily, sets at rest
several rumors, among them the statement that your meeting was not
given any advance publicity, and that the campus as a whole did not
know of it.
