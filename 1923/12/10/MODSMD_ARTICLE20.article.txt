To The Editor of The Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—On Thursday, December 6,
the San Francisco Chronicle published
an article which stated that rumor is
abroad on the Stanford campus to the
effect that a unit of the Ku Klux Klan
is in process of formation here.
I desire to set that rumor at rest by
confirming it. But at the same time I
want to correct the impression conveyed
by the Chronicle's article that the meet
ing recently held in the Engineering
building was a "secret affair." Written
invitations were mailed to a number of
my personal friends and each was asked
,to bring with him as many others as he
might desire. I deny that there was any
element of secrecy in that procedure.
Admittedly I am interested in the Ku
Klux Klan, as any man must be who

takes the pains to discover for himself
what that order stands for and what its
policies are.
I desire now to extend an open invi- i
tation to the entire student body, women '
included, and to the faculty, to hear an
authoritative and unbiased discussion of
the Ku Klux Klan, on an evening to be '
announced later (after the coming week
of examinations).
I will endeavor to procure the Assem
bly Hall for the purpose of this meeting, j
The Ku Klux Klan has been openly de
nounced in some of the regular class
rooms of this University in the past, and
fair play could demand no less than that
an opportunity be given for its defense
in the same place. If, however, the Uni- j
vcrsity authorities deny my request, an-1
other place of meeting will be provided [
and will be announced later. Sincerely, !
ROBERT BURNETT.
