# CABBAGES and THINGS
## EVERY NIGHT-SHIRT NUMBER

—c. s. s.

The Fiery Announcement that the Klan has organized locally was received
with hallelujahs, rejoicings, and salutations, not to mention an occasional
hallucination and hoorah, by the local dealers in sheets, pillow-cases, and
accessories. •

Think what a boost this is going to be for the industrious students handling
laundry agencies. What with the approach of the wet season it is going to
be practically impossible to stage even the most informal hanging or even
burning at the stake without getting more or less mud and a little blood on
the uniform.
If the Klan would appreciate it, this column can give them the names of
three traitors, in the clothing business, who are arranging to furnish the
Klan with woolen robes. And then, when the first rain comes along, the
Klansmen are going to have to spend the rest of the night, after satisfactorily
dealing out hempen justice, in the hen-coop, or else adopt the good old bbl.
as the official garment.
Figure the shrinkage on a six-foot woolen robe, and judge for yourself.

And another thing—Mr. Kleagle—how many of the Klansmen can ride a
horse? And what is a Klansman without a horse? Just the same sort of a
lame-brain that he is with one, probably, but that is beside the point. A horse
is essential to his proper equipment, just as soap is essential to a shower-bath.
Cabbages offers ten-point money that the first campaign for membership is
directed at the polo team.
It is Cabbages' opinion that the Klan has gone just one step too far, even
for a Cyclops. Day before yesterday the Klux secretly aranged (this is
straight) with the Laundry Czar over at Encina for free laundry-bags for use
as head-gear.
Now the other laundry agents are up in arms, and the first time the Klans
men sally out the sally-port they are going to find their robes in just the same
disassembled state that your shirts are when they come back from the laundry.
