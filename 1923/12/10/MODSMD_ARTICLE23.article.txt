_C. N. H

There once lived a
renowned scholar,
a man venerable by
his seventy years
of profound study
and full experience.
Little of life had
eluded him, and few
werd the pages of
the world's thoughts
that he had not read,
He had no illusions.
Universal knowledge
was virtually his.
After he had passed
to perhaps a greater
understanding, his
journal was shared
with the world.
Somewhere within its
pages may be found
the words which form
the sole excuse for
this writing. They
are: "After a life
of learning, I have
found that there is
yet as much more
left by me unlearned."
