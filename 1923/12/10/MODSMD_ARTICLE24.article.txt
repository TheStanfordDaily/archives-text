# BISHOP LAUDS FORCE OF FRATERNAL TIES

### 
University fraternal life counteracts j
the growing lack of faith in humanity ;
which comes with wider experience in j
life, according to the Right Reverend j
Nichols, Bishop of California, who spoke
in the Memorial Church yesterday.
"A baby begins life a blue-eyed be- j
liever in every one, but often he leaves j
the world a soitr, crabbed cynic, with
faith in no one," said Bishop Nichols.
Faith is the great dowry given us at
the beginning of life. The feeling of
brotherhood which comes with the com
panionship of fraternity and sorority life
helps us to keep this feeling. Such
group associations may be renewed in
after years because they are based on i
this feeling of absolute trust.
The Bishop quoted as a definition of
faith, "It is not a substitute for reason,
nor a supplement to reason, but it is
reason raised to its highest power."

Faith is the primary notion back of
heroism. In every man the struggle be
tween the coward and the hero is per
petual. In the words of William James,
"There are two souls within my breast.
1 see the better thing, but in seeing it I
do the worse." *
