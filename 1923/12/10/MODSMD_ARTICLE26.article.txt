### 
The Stanford soccer varsity went j
down, 2-0, before the Olympic Club
eleven in a well-played game Saturday, j
The game ended the Stanford schedule I
in the University and Club Soccer
League for this year.
The Olympics, the league leaders, were
on the offensive most of the time. They j
continually worked the ball down the ]
field, only to have the play broken up by
Clark, Muinford, Howe, or Franklin,
Cardinal backs.
The first Olympic score came when the j
referee called a penalty for charging.!
McCallum, playing left back, made the
penalty kick good. The next score came
a few minutes later when Velisaratos got
the ball past the Card goalkeeper
During the second half the Olympics '
were repeatedly in a position to score, j
hut the Stanford backs got in some good \
work and averted any more goals. Stan- !
ford had only once chance to score dur- j
ing this period.
Mumford, Ta'am, and Richardson'
brought the ball the length of the field,
and Swayne made the try for goal, but I
the Olympic goalkeeper knocked the ,
ball out.
