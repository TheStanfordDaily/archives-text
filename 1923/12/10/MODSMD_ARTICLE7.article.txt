# "CAPTAIN APPLEJACK'' BRINGS OUT TALENT
## Lloyd Nolan Given Highest Honors; Aileene Burks; Marjorie Allen Are Dramatic Finds 
### JAMES MUIR 
With a cast of unquestionable ability the sophomores last Friday evening
presented "Captain Applejack" in a manner that finds the campus still talking
about it. Outside of one or two technical slips the critics could discover
nothing that did not place the play at par with anything that has been seen
on the Assembly hall stage in recent years. The only element that marred
the success of "Captain Applejack" was the smallness of the house, showing
a decided need for something in the way of low-priced gallery seats.
To Lloyd Nolan, who played the part of Ambrose Applejohn, go the highest
honors for individual acting. The play itself was centered around him and if he
had failed in any way it would not have been a success. Nolan has more than

ordinary ability in the art of securing
comic effects. He can get more laughs
out of an audience by his interpreta
tion than the book itself might show
to be possible.
Aileene Burks surpassed all expec
tations of a dramatic "find." In a part
that demanded two cultivated foreign
accents as well as good acting, she
proved herself to be a real actress. It
is seldom in amateur theatricals that
actors or actresses can be found who
can bury their own personalities in
portraying a character of the drama.
It would be safe to bet that none of
Miss Burks' intimate friends could
have recognized her in Anna Valeska
had they not seen her name on the
program.
Sophomore plays have long been
the means of uncovering new dramatic
material. "Captain Applejack" was no
exception. While Marjorie Allen, in
the role of Poppy Faire, Applejohn's
ward, is still 011 the campus Director
Davis will not have far to look when
he wants an ingenue lead expertly
filled. Miss Allen had the audience
with her from the moment of her first
speech until the final curtain.
Delmer Daves has appeared in lead
ing roles so many times that his ability
as an actor is not to be questioned. He
had a difficult job in interpreting the
arch villain and mutineer, Ivan Borol
sky, but he carried it out in a con
vincing manner, injecting so much
realism into his acting that he was
able to hold the audience breathless
in moments of suspense.
Patrice Nauman is also to be classed
with the other sophomore "finds." She
