# Lack Of Substitutes May Hamper Card Basket Men; Bears To Have Great Team
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
will have to be the strongest five in'
many years to defeat the reputed 1924 1
hoop squad from the University of'
California. Reports from the Berkeley 1
campus say that the Hears will hate
one of the fastest teams ever groomed.
The California five is composed of

just the right height to make shooting
easy; a sort of reach-up-and-drop-the

ries the opposing safety men.
The Card's squad of reserve men is
not any too strong, but there are
several players who loom up as possi
bilities. Ted Steffan, who played such
a consistent game for the 145-pound
team last season, is a fast, dodgy little
forward, full of fight, and although a
bit hasty in his shots, he ought to im
