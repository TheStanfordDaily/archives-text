# Lack Of Substitutes May Hamper Card Basket Men; Bears To Have Great Team
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
will have to be the strongest five in'
many years to defeat the reputed 1924 1
hoop squad from the University of'
California. Reports from the Berkeley 1
campus say that the Hears will hate
one of the fastest teams ever groomed.
The California five is composed of
two speedy forwards, Talt and Hou
venin; a heavy center, with two letter
men at running guard to choose from;
Kincaid is back as defensive guard.
Stanford, on the other hand, is sup
plied with two fast forwards, who will
undoubtedly make It warm for Cali
fornia's "wonderful array of running
guardß."
"Nip" McHose and Ernie Nevers arej
easily the equal of any pair of goal
tossers to be found in these parts.
"Nip" will have more speed, accu-'
racy, and confidence this year, as his
practice performances already begin
to show. There is a certain drive about,
McHose which, coupled with his well-,
known squirming ability, always puts

him in a position to shoot, and it will
take a corkng good guard to keep him
from sticking the ball through the
loop at the needed intervals.
Nevers is all speed and drive. To
watch that two hundred pounds of
beef rushing a ball down the court
ought to make any defense man think
twice before he steps in to tackle it.
And Ernie is no mean goal shooter.
His drive puts him in a shooting posi
tion, and once there he has the ability I
to put the ball in the basket. He is
just the right height to make shooting
easy; a sort of reach-up-and-drop-the
ball-through style, which always wor
ries the opposing safety men.
The Card's squad of reserve men is
not any too strong, but there are
several players who loom up as possi
bilities. Ted Steffan, who played such
a consistent game for the 145-pound
team last season, is a fast, dodgy little
forward, full of fight, and although a
bit hasty in his shots, he ought to im
prove steadily under watchful coach
ing.
"Mugs" Mitchell has as good a
chance for guard as the next man.
Mitchell has not reported for practice
this quarter but he will be on the
court following the final examinations.
Of the new arrivals, however, Moody
and Mcßurney seem to have the edge.
Both follow the ball like trained play
ers. Mcßurney at present looks like
the best bet for the running guard
position, although it is hard to judge
so early in the season. Mooney will
give Steele a hot run for the center
position.
But on the whole the Cardinal team
begins to look like a five-man affair.
Last year it proved unsafe to use
many substitutes because of lack of
calibre. This year the same situation
is present. Five men are dependable,
and perhaps one or two of the sub
stitutes experienced enough for a trial
in one or two games.
Lack of substitutes on the squad last
season nearly proved fatal in the Cali
fornia series.
The regulars, especially the for
wards, were forced to remain on the
court all during the grind, while the
Bears substituted at will to good ad
vantage. It is to be hoped, therefore,
that Andy Kerr will find enough prom
ising material in the ranks of the try
outees to overbalance this evident
disadvantage.

The day of the Brahmins is divided
by their clocks into sixty hours of
twenty-four minutes each.
