Home Builders!
Here is a Way to Have Ttco or
Three Fireplaces at the Cost of One
Why build a home without a fireplace when you can
Install one complete, including a beautiful Radiantfire
gas heating unit for from one half to a third the cost
I of the ordinary fireplace?
Think what this means from a quick selling stand
point ! Think what a saving it means in building a
2-flat, a four-flat or an apartment!
The saving comes from the elimination of the expen
sive brick flue and ash pit. With a Radiantfire you need
only a copper or terra-cotta vent. It means a saving
of $100 to $300 on every fireplace.
And the Radiantfire heating unit costs no more than
the usual fireplace equipmentâ€”fire basket, screen and
tools.
The Radiantfire equipped fireplace is used ten times
as often as a wood or coal fire and gives infinitely
more heat and satisfaction. More attractive than an
old fashioned fire whether in use or unlighted. Costs
less to operate.
