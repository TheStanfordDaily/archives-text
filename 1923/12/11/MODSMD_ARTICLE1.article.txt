# PHYSICAL TRAINING CHANGES WILL BE MADE BY BARROW
## Registration Limited to Two Days; No Transferring In Winter Quarter 
### 
Interesting and important changes
will be made in the schedule of work
in the Department of Physical Educa
tion for Men beginning next quarter.
Two Men May Be Added to Staff
If plans which have been worked out
by the director and approved by the
Board of Athletic Control materialize
and are approved by the Board of
Trustees, two additional men will be
added to the members of the staff, and
these men will assist with minor
sports, gymnasium work and intra
mural sports.
Incidental to this increase in the
staff is the fact that with courses prop
erly supervised and instructed by
members of the staff in minor sports
as well as major, it will be possible to
restore University credit for men regu
larly enrolled in work in the depart
ment.
Classes in gymnasium work and in
formal games will be increased in
number and will be held both morning
and afternoon at various hours if the
demand is sufficient to warrant it.
The idea is to make the work of these
classes so varied and interesting that
the man of mediocre ability who has
not yet found himself may here de
velop his possibilities and also take
enjoyable exercise. There will be, of
course, the regular class for gym
nastics for the development of the
gymnastic team.
The Basketball Courses Open
In addition to the varsity and fresh
man basketball there will be a regular
basketball class which will combine
theoretical instruction and floor work
for a limited number of men who are
anxious to learn the game. This course
will be held Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday at 2, and will be given by C. W.
Davis.
Two courses on the Quad will be
offered by the department during the
coming quarter. Andy Kerr will
give a two-unit course in the theory
and coaching of basketball, and Dr.
Barrow will give his regular course in
elementary physiology and hygiene.
Owing to the limited number of ten
nis courts and the impossibility of
properly supervising the sport or of
arranging for good competition among
a large group of men, certain changes
are necessary jn the tennis work.
There will be a class in tennis for
men who wish instruction in the game
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 11. Enrollment on the varsity or
freshman squad will be limited to men
served for these men on the after
of ability and the courts will be re
noons of onday, Wednesday, and Fri
day.
Handball Class Discontinued
Owing to the limited space and the
interference with basketball, as well
as the impossibility of properly super
vising the sport, it has been found nec
essary to drop handball for the present
from the schedule of courses. This
does not mean that handball enthusi
asts may not use the courts, but no
regular class work will be given.
The following instructions for en
rollment in work In the Department
of Physical Education next quarter
should be carefully observed by men '
registered either for the fulfillment of
requirement or for credit.
Enrollment in these courses must be i
made on one of the first two days fol-1

lowing registration day. Unless a rea
sonable excuse is presented, late en-1
rollment will not be allowed in the case I
of men desiring to take the work for
credit.
Transference to Be Restricted.
A change in the rules as regards
transferring from one activity to an
other lias also been found advisable
since the staff has found that constant
shifting of certain men from one activ
ity to another greatly handicaps them.
Therefore in the case of men taking
work for the fulfillment of require
ment, if a limited transfer seems advis
able or necessary it may be made.
Men enrolled for credit will not be
allowed to transfer from one sport to
another.

Transference to Be Restricted.
A change in the rules as regards
transferring from one activity to an
other lias also been found advisable
since the staff has found that constant
shifting of certain men from one activ
ity to another greatly handicaps them.
Therefore in the case of men taking
work for the fulfillment of require
ment, if a limited transfer seems advis
able or necessary it may be made.
Men enrolled for credit will not be
allowed to transfer from one sport to
another.
Interesting and important changes
will be made in the schedule of work
in the Department of Physical Educa
tion for Men beginning next quarter.
Two Men May Be Added to Staff
If plans which have been worked out
by the director and approved by the
Board of Athletic Control materialize
and are approved by the Board of
Trustees, two additional men will be
added to the members of the staff, and
these men will assist with minor
sports, gymnasium work and intra
mural sports.
Incidental to this increase in the
staff is the fact that with courses prop
erly supervised and instructed by
members of the staff in minor sports
as well as major, it will be possible to
restore University credit for men regu
larly enrolled in work in the depart
ment.
Classes in gymnasium work and in
formal games will be increased in
number and will be held both morning
and afternoon at various hours if the
demand is sufficient to warrant it.
The idea is to make the work of these
classes so varied and interesting that
the man of mediocre ability who has
not yet found himself may here de
velop his possibilities and also take
enjoyable exercise. There will be, of
course, the regular class for gym
nastics for the development of the
gymnastic team.
The Basketball Courses Open
In addition to the varsity and fresh
man basketball there will be a regular
basketball class which will combine
theoretical instruction and floor work
for a limited number of men who are
anxious to learn the game. This course
will be held Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday at 2, and will be given by C. W.
Davis.
Two courses on the Quad will be
offered by the department during the
coming quarter. Andy Kerr will
give a two-unit course in the theory
and coaching of basketball, and Dr.
Barrow will give his regular course in
elementary physiology and hygiene.
Owing to the limited number of ten
nis courts and the impossibility of
properly supervising the sport or of
arranging for good competition among
a large group of men, certain changes
are necessary jn the tennis work.
There will be a class in tennis for
men who wish instruction in the game
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
at 11. Enrollment on the varsity or
freshman squad will be limited to men
served for these men on the after
of ability and the courts will be re
noons of onday, Wednesday, and Fri
day.
Handball Class Discontinued
Owing to the limited space and the
interference with basketball, as well
as the impossibility of properly super
vising the sport, it has been found nec
essary to drop handball for the present
from the schedule of courses. This
does not mean that handball enthusi
asts may not use the courts, but no
regular class work will be given.
The following instructions for en

of Physical Education next quarter
