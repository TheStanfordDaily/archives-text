# PHYSICAL TRAINING CHANGES WILL BE MADE BY BARROW
## Registration Limited to Two Days; No Transferring In Winter Quarter 
### 
Interesting and important changes
will be made in the schedule of work
in the Department of Physical Educa
tion for Men beginning next quarter.
Two Men May Be Added to Staff
If plans which have been worked out
by the director and approved by the
Board of Athletic Control materialize
and are approved by the Board of
Trustees, two additional men will be
added to the members of the staff, and
these men will assist with minor
sports, gymnasium work and intra
mural sports.
Incidental to this increase in the
staff is the fact that with courses prop
erly supervised and instructed by
members of the staff in minor sports
as well as major, it will be possible to
restore University credit for men regu
larly enrolled in work in the depart
ment.
Classes in gymnasium work and in
formal games will be increased in
number and will be held both morning
and afternoon at various hours if the
demand is sufficient to warrant it.
The idea is to make the work of these
classes so varied and interesting that
the man of mediocre ability who has
not yet found himself may here de
velop his possibilities and also take
enjoyable exercise. There will be, of
course, the regular class for gym
nastics for the development of the
gymnastic team.
