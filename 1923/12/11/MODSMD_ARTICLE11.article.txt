Alpha Sigma Phi house is a colored
cook who is also a literary genius.
Frank Foster is his name. He was
born in Indianapolis, Indiana, is 27
years of age, and has already pub
lished two books.
''Frank" has had the desire to hold
a pen ever since he was a child. His
first literary efforts began six years
ago in San Diego, however, when he
wrote a poem entitled, "A Slave Moth
er's Prayer."
Has Written a Play
Since then he has been writing
steadily whenever time permitted. In
Arizona he once wrote and staked a
play, "A1 Amin's Tale of the Jungles,"
a dramatization of the native African.
He has published a book of poems,
"Cabin Lights and Candle Flickers,"
written In his native dialect.
"Brown Fairies" is the name of Pas
ter's latest book. It is a collection of
fairy tales written in a style that is
"different." The book is said to be the
first collection of fairy stories written
by a colored author. Foster says it is
a gift to the children.
Life Has Been "Queer"
Foster's life has been interesting
and runs like a "story book" life.

When he was nine, his father, an in
ventor, died, and young Frank was
placed in an orphans' home. But, crav
ig excitement, he left the institution
and from then on fought his way
through life alone. His experiences
have placed him in contact with the
lowest and highest types of people.
But let him tell it:
"When I left the orphan home I
wandered around lowa with shoes that J
had no soles. At one time T worked
with shows that were going the rounds
of country fairs. At another, I became
connected with a band of gypsies and
was kept busy for a while.
Was Arrested
"One winter I could find no place
to sleep so I spent the night in a
depot roundhouse in hopes of getting
a freight train to Springfield. I was
placed under arrest but the kind
hearted detective let me go. I was
thirteen then.
"But such good fortune didn't last.
I was re-arrested by another detective
and taken before the judge. I told him
I was eighteen so that I wouldn't be
sent to reform school. My sentence
was fifteen days in the city jail. I
spent two there and caught a freight
train to Toledo, Ohio, arriving there
nearly frozen to death and with only
two cents in my pocket."
Began Fight in Toledo
It was in Toledo that Foster began
fighting his way up. While a bus boy
in a Detroit hotel he had an oppor
tunity to go on a Grand Trunk diner
on the International Limited running
from Montreal and Quebec to Chicago.
Ever since then he has lived in the
kitchen.
Prior to his coming to Stanford, Fos
ter cooked at the Saratoga Inn. Before
that, he was chef on the Western
Division superintendent's private diner
on the El Paso and Southwestern Rail
road. He also worked for Mrs. William
Jennings Bryan, Jr., in Arizona.

Foster was married when he was
17. He has one daughter, age 8.
Likes Stanford Men
"Although my knowledge of the
men of Stanford is somewhat lim
ited, I find them fair and broad-mind
ed, not bowing to any petty preju
dices," Foster says. "After having
mingled with every type of humanity,
1 have come to realize that there is
always a chance to learn more. Since
I coming here, I have found that those
who have ambitions are not jealous
of the other fellows' ambitions.
"I like Stanford and the sort of men
who are going to college here."

BERKELEYâ€”Work will begin soon
on the new Hearst Hall, the half-mil
lion dollar gymnasium, which is the
gift of William Randolph Hearst. The
building will probably Ilave two storier
and will be entirely fireproof.
