# CONVERT WORLD MIND FOR PEACE--M'CALL
## 
### 
Conversion of the mind of the world
is the first step toward universal
peace, according to Dr. Oswald W. S.
MeCall, who gave his final campus
address last night.
Dr. McCall outlined a plan by which
this end may be accomplished. Salva
tion begins at home, therefore be sure
that your own mind is free from
thoughts of war, always inflammable
material. Sparks are sure to fly and
such ideas are as dangerous as gun
powder.
"Secondly, cure the minds of others.
Though we can't all write clever arti
cles, or go to Congress, we are able to
work in whatever corner we are
placed.
"Also, keep a clear head among the
thick dust of politics. The question is
not a political issue, there should be
no axe-grinding here. It is a matter of
international life or suicide. Therefore
when we go to the ballot box we must
keep out politicians who will not take
steps toward better international feel
ing.
"The Church could change the face
of the world within ten years if she
insisted that war be outlawed. She has
not entirely missed the lesson of the
last strife, but her vision must be
clearer or she will allow the oppor
tunity to swing the mind of the world
to slip through her fingers.
"Today the church has been en
trusted with the keys of Heaven and
Hell and before this generation is
spent she will have opened one of
them to the children of men."
