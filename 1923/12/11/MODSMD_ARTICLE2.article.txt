# ASHBURNER EVALUATES UNIVERSITY EDUCATION
## 
### 
"A collegc education gives a man the
tools with which to work his way in the
world," says C. E. Ashburner, city man
ager of Stockton, and founder of the
city manager system in the United
States. "The type of man who gets to
college has a mind that can be trained
and developed. His training there should
make him better able to adjust himself
to conditions and to meet situations with
greater success.
"Put a college trained man beside a
non-college man in the same job, be it
business or government, and the college
trained man should come out on top.
He is way ahead of the other man at the
start, and if he doesn't make good he
isn't worth —well he just ISN'T. The
man without the college education
may be just as good but he never can
catch up with the man of superior
training.
Start at the Bottom
"No matter what budding genius
the college man may thing he is at
graduation, he has to start his job at
the bottom. We need men with prac
tical exparience, with balance, and
ability to weigh the importance of a
transaction. We need more men who
know their fellow men. The success
of an engineering project, for instance,
depends not alone on the safeness of
the structure or the method of con
struction, but on the salesmanship of
the engineer—on his ability to con
vince business men that the project is
sound from a business point of view.
"Be willing to take the job that's in
front of you." is Ashburner's advice to
college men. "Put that job across to
day, and the jobs you want will come
to you. I believe in the job seeking
the man rather than the man the job.
And it will."
Urges Interest in Government
Ashburner urges greater interest on
the part of college men and women
in government and public welfare.
"The greatest problem of public work
today is the indifference of the aver
age citizen," he said. He wakes up
and wonders what has been happen
ing around him if a great calamity
turns on the alarm. He is contrite,
and says he have done some
thing if he had only known.
"But every city gets just the govern
ment it deserves. If its citizens would
go to the polls, they could get what
they want. This is the missionary
work for college people. Vote and get
others to vote with you."

business or government, and the college
trained man should come out on top.
He is way ahead of the other man at the
start, and if he doesn't make good he
isn't worth —well he just ISN'T. The
man without the college education
may be just as good but he never can
catch up with the man of superior
training.
Start at the Bottom
"No matter what budding genius
the college man may thing he is at
graduation, he has to start his job at
the bottom. We need men with prac
tical exparience, with balance, and
ability to weigh the importance of a
transaction. We need more men who
know their fellow men. The success
of an engineering project, for instance,
depends not alone on the safeness of
the structure or the method of con
struction, but on the salesmanship of
the engineer—on his ability to con
vince business men that the project is
sound from a business point of view.
"Be willing to take the job that's in
front of you." is Ashburner's advice to
college men. "Put that job across to
day, and the jobs you want will come
to you. I believe in the job seeking
the man rather than the man the job.
And it will."
Urges Interest in Government
Ashburner urges greater interest on
the part of college men and women
in government and public welfare.
"The greatest problem of public work
today is the indifference of the aver
age citizen," he said. He wakes up
and wonders what has been happen
ing around him if a great calamity
turns on the alarm. He is contrite,
and says he have done some
thing if he had only known.
"But every city gets just the govern
ment it deserves. If its citizens would
go to the polls, they could get what
they want. This is the missionary
work for college people. Vote and get
others to vote with you."
"A collegc education gives a man the
tools with which to work his way in the
world," says C. E. Ashburner, city man
ager of Stockton, and founder of the
city manager system in the United
States. "The type of man who gets to
college has a mind that can be trained
and developed. His training there should
make him better able to adjust himself
to conditions and to meet situations with
greater success.
"Put a college trained man beside a
non-college man in the same job, be it
business or government, and the college
trained man should come out on top.
He is way ahead of the other man at the
