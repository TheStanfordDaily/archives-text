# MONTANA IN THE CONFERENCE
## 
### 
The entrance of Montana into the Pacific Coast conference may be
taken as a step forward or a step sideways according to where you
stand when viewing the move. However, no amount of viewpoints
will now change the situation.
Undoubtedly several members of the conference rose to their feet
in wrath when the subject was broached, and announced that the
organization was already too unwieldy, and that additional members
would only increase the complications and railroad expenses. This
might be true, and very probably would be, even at present, except
that arangements have already been made for the most distant teams to
meet at halfway intervals. Stanford, for instance, plays Idaho at
Portland next fall.
If the move to take more colleges into the conference continues, it
is logical to suppose that the representatives will do with football what
they have done to basketballâ€”divide the conference into two sections,
with an intersectional game to determine the coast champion. Logically
this would be the only outcome of the situation if Nevada were ad
mitted to the same body with Stanford and California.
There would be no occasion for a split and formation of two separate
conferences, for the Pacific Coast Conference is a body designed to
represent the whole Western coast, whether its members all play each
other or not.
