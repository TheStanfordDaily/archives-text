# VERY SORRY

Some criticism of the Daily Palo Alto has been made because of its
inability to take seriously the desire of several apparently serious-minded
people to join the Klux. We are truly sorry that we cannot think about
the advent upon the Stanford campus of sheet-kniglits in night-shirts
without shattering the dignity of the editorial sanctum with a few choice
guffaws.
The fact that three thousand more or less of the citizenry of Santa
Clara county indulged in a publicly secret initiation into the Invisible
Empire is no reflection on Santa Clara county, and the fact that the
half-educated excitables of the shoe-clerk variety found a new thrill and
a new emotional work-out in donning the regalia of hard-working ghosts
only shows that some people will take anything seriously.
