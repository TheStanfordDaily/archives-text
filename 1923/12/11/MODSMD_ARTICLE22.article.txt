# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
I think your editorial on the Klan
last night was entirely un-kalled for.
Now I am no Klansman myself—we
are out of flour-sacks just now—but I
do think new honor societies should
be established on the campus. We need !
a few. And along here comes a regu
lar, 100% Protestant honor society,
guaranteed to give the kampus a little
amusement, and you jump all over it.
There are certainly a lot of things
the Klan kan do around here. What
about hooding up some night and in- (
ducing the authorities to hurry up
with that soft drink bar in the Union?
Or visiting the kourse korrektors the
night the papers are korrekted? Or
taking the place of the sponsor kom
mittee to chastise the freshmen? Let' 9
be kareful about krushing such a po
tentially valuable organization as this.
Now, personally, I don't want to
Join the Klan right now, because I've
got an Uncle that is a Katholic, my
best friend Is a Jew, and I want to be
free to go and see a negro minstrel
show when I want to. But I hope every
body else with nothing to do on week
ends will join, and write "K. K. K. (1,
2, 3, 4)" after their name in their
Senior record. Anyway, I'll bet you're
a Kleagle or a Klaxon yourself, or

you wouldn't be giving it so much
publicity.
Yours for komradeship—
"k."
