Dear Sir:
Permit me to suggest that a "personal letter" should bear the signature of
its writer. Tam not inclined to engage in the recriminatory and undignified
sort of twaddle which your editorial —by the example it sets, would seem to
invite.
I do claim to be a patriotic American —passionately so, and f I am "mis
guided," gp also are more than seven million native-born American men who
constitute the Ku Klux Klan today. If this be true, God help our Nation!
* ♦ *
You charge a number of atrocious acts to the Ku Klux'Klan. Is it not
remarkable that no Klansman ever has been conyicted of such crime? Your
personal prejudice might be explained by your evident ignorance of fact, but
your bald statement of that prejudice discloses the regrettable truth that
your College education has been in vain—in that it has not trained you to
refrain from discussing a subject about which you know nothing.
* * *
You contend that my action in addressing supplementary invitations to
Protestant members of the white race, expresses the "prejudice" of the Klan
against all other people. The Knights of Columbus' exclude all protestants;
The Y. M. H. I. is open only to Hebrew men; The Society for the Advancement
of the Colored Race is for negroes, and is devoted to the laudable purpose
of advancing the interests of the negro. But —when the Ku Klux Klan
exercises that right, freely conceded all other orders, of banding together
certain classes of men for the purposes, among others, of advancing the
interests of the WHITE RACE and of Protestantism, you cry "prejudice!"
* * *
What manner of reasoning takes place in your mind, Mr. Editor?
Sincerely,
ROB'T BURNETT.
