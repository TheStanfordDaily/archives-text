Sundown. Red tiles of
the Quad roofs burn
with the reflected lire
of a seething world now
dropping below the western
hill range above whose
mauve mistiness the sky
mounts from brilliant
salmon to coral . . . from
faintest turquoise to
cobalt and defep azure.
Impatient moon, a huge
silvered scimitar hung
high in the south, is
companion to a solitary
star. A quail cries from
a pine tree. And Night
waits patiently in the
shadows for Evening to
depart.
Strong-tongued chimes
speak the hour as the
Quad grows dim, and
electric scissors cut
yellow squares out of the
Library. Students are
crossing Memorial court
with dusk-shod feet.
Twilight overtakes . . .
passes them. Two hundred
miles to the east a train
hurries over the desert
with one aboard who knew
these sundowns —who will
not forget their
ineffable peace. He
has bade Stanford
farewell . . .

The football budget for this year at
j the University of Washington esti
] mated a gain of $13,000 in receipts
I over last year.
