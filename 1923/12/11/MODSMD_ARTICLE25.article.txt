ARE YOU ABSENT MINDED?
The Daily Texan
Scientists in New York have just
discovered, according to press dis
patches from that city, that "many
persons occasionally are absent mind
ed and, while their wits are wool
gathering, the motions of their bodies,
as recorded by photography, are strik
ingly similar to those of the weak
minded or subnormal * * * lead
ing to the conclusion that absent-mind
ed persons temporarily indulge in mo
tions and behavior of imbeciles."
While The Texan usually accepts
the statements of scientists, especially
New York scientists, as true to the
very letter, it is very doubtful if this
newest discovery, as it is termed,
should be interpreted literally. To do
so would lead to the inevitable con
clusion that your room-mate, who ab
sentmindedly wears your only clean
shirt, is occasionally insane, and that
your favorite professor, who often for-j
gets when your class meets, should
really be listed among the weak-mind
ed and subnormal.
