# THE
						GRAND ORDER OF BANANAS

A Grand Order of Bananas has been
started in New York, open only to peo
ple who have a sense of humor.
It is to be hoped that this fruitful
organization will, in the course of
time, establish bunches or branches on
the campuses of various colleges and
universities. A real sense of humor is
such a rare thing and yet so useful
that no modern student can afford to
be without it. If the new Banana order
does nothing more than to disperse
the heavy, cloud-like vapors of damp
melancholy, dejection, irascibility, and
despondency, which so often sweep
over the campus classes, study-halls,
and dormitories, it will have given an
invaluable boon to the world.
Pensiveness Also Exists
Beneath the somewhat frolicsome
and superficial exteriors of the mod
ern students there often lies a pen
sive, dismal inner nature. The stings
and arrows of professional sarcasm,
the calamitous and lamentable deluges
of examination books and blue slips,
and the almost hopeless scholastic
competition against greater and nobler
minds, have given a mournful tinge to
the character of every student. It is,

in fact, no great wonder that suicide
is too frequent among the intellectual
classes.
Humor Would "Re-Create"
A sense of humor would re-create
the student of today. It would mark a
mental Renaissance in his life, the
beginning of a happier era. The fran
tic struggles for fame and popularity
on the campus, the soaring ambitions
to "make" sororities and fraternities,
the honeyed desires to be president of
a dozen societies at one time, and the
delectable dreams of being a combined
athlete, prophet, scholar, social peer,
and actor, would then appear to him
as absurdities, irrational, fantastic,
preposterous incongruities.
Won't some ingenious student, whoj
has the welfare of his university at
heart, organize a "Bunch of Bananas"
at Minnesota?
