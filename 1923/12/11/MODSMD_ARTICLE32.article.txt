# AT 21 YEARS OF AGE
## Professor Foster Was Library Assistant and a Sophomore at Stanford 
### 
Professor Benjamin O Foster, of the.
Classical Literature department, was
a sophomore at Stanford in the class
of 1895 when he was 21 years old.
He was a library assistant during
his first year—the second after the
founding of the University. There were
no card catalogues at the time and
each of the three assistants had to
know practically every book and its
location by heart. One day a student
entered and asked for "Socrateß' Art
ists," but Foster soon guessed that it
was "Sartor Resartus" which was
wanted, since the book had been in
heavy demand for some time.
Also Attended Harvard
Professor Foster completed his un
dergraduate work in three years and
went to Harvard where he spent five
years in graduate work, finally taking
his Ph.D. degree after traveling a year
in Europe as a Harvard Fellow. While
abroad, he attended the American
School of Classical Studies in Rome,
where he met a Michigan Normal
School professor in Italy who invited
him to take his course in e Classical
Literature for a year since he wanted
to continue his travels. After spending
a year in Michigan, Foster came to
Stanford where he has been ever
since.
Foster was born in Maine and took
part of his high school work in the
Boston Latin School. He finished at
the Salt Lake Collegiate Institution
since there were no public schools in

Salt Lake at the time. He came to ;
Stanford in 1892 because it had been
well advertised and was nearer home
than the Eastern institutions. He liked
it and finished his course here.
Arrived at Stanford in 1892
Foster and his sister arrived shortly
before the beginning of the fall quar
ter in 1892 and left the train at May
field since it did not stop at the Palo
Alto flag station. They walked to Palo
Alto, asked for the restaurant where
they were allowed to wash in a tin
basin on a soap box, and were given!
a substantial meal. Foster went to
Encina hall to live and his sister to |
Sequoia hall which was then Roble
hall, the women's dormitory.
In his senior year, Foster taught~a
beginners' class in Latin and also did
some tutoring.
Camped With Professor Cathcart
One of his summer vacations he'
spent camping with Professor Arthur
M. Cathcart, of the Law department,
who was then his roommate, and two
other fellows. The four hiked into
Yosemite park and spent six weeks
there, returning to the campus
"broke."
Social activities on the campus were
few and far between in 1893. Occa
sionally the Stanfords would invite
the "Encina boys" over to their home,
where the Convalescent Home now is
located, give them refreshments, and
shake hands with them.

well advertised and was nearer home
than the Eastern institutions. He liked
it and finished his course here.
Arrived at Stanford in 1892
Foster and his sister arrived shortly
before the beginning of the fall quar
ter in 1892 and left the train at May
field since it did not stop at the Palo
Alto flag station. They walked to Palo
Alto, asked for the restaurant where
they were allowed to wash in a tin
basin on a soap box, and were given!
a substantial meal. Foster went to
Encina hall to live and his sister to |
Sequoia hall which was then Roble
hall, the women's dormitory.
In his senior year, Foster taught~a
beginners' class in Latin and also did
some tutoring.
Camped With Professor Cathcart
One of his summer vacations he'
spent camping with Professor Arthur
M. Cathcart, of the Law department,
who was then his roommate, and two
other fellows. The four hiked into
Yosemite park and spent six weeks
there, returning to the campus
"broke."
Social activities on the campus were
few and far between in 1893. Occa
sionally the Stanfords would invite
the "Encina boys" over to their home,
where the Convalescent Home now is
located, give them refreshments, and
shake hands with them.
Professor Benjamin O Foster, of the.
Classical Literature department, was
a sophomore at Stanford in the class
of 1895 when he was 21 years old.
He was a library assistant during
his first year—the second after the
founding of the University. There were
no card catalogues at the time and
each of the three assistants had to
know practically every book and its
location by heart. One day a student
entered and asked for "Socrateß' Art
ists," but Foster soon guessed that it
was "Sartor Resartus" which was
wanted, since the book had been in
heavy demand for some time.
Also Attended Harvard
Professor Foster completed his un
dergraduate work in three years and
went to Harvard where he spent five
years in graduate work, finally taking
his Ph.D. degree after traveling a year
in Europe as a Harvard Fellow. While
abroad, he attended the American
School of Classical Studies in Rome,
where he met a Michigan Normal
School professor in Italy who invited
him to take his course in e Classical
Literature for a year since he wanted
to continue his travels. After spending
a year in Michigan, Foster came to
Stanford where he has been ever
since.
Foster was born in Maine and took
