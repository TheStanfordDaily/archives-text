Stanford will open the 1923-24 bas
ketball season against the San Jose
Y. M. C. A. in the pavilion Wednesday
night at 8 o'clock.
Kerr's object in scheduling the game
was to see how the varsity squad lines
up this early in the season. Substitu
tions will likely be made at will, the
chief object being to determine which
players are better fitted to survive
the first cut next quarter.
Cards Should Win
The starting line-up will probably
be, McHose and Nevers at forwards,
Steele at center, Mcßurney and Oliva
at guards. With this combination the
Cardinals should show enough class to
defeat the Y. M. C. A. squad which
has been practicing steadily during
the winter. Three men on the line-up
have had varsity experience, while
Nevers played on the freshman team
last year. Mcßurney is a new prospect,
and his work will be watched with in
terest; for dependable candidates for
the running guard post are yet to be
found.
Moody will be certain to get a trial
at center or forward at some stage
during the game, and Steffan a chance

at some forward position. Both are
promising.
Last year's team was strong because
the men knew how to handle the ball.
The feature of many of the games,
especially those against U. S. C., was
the passing of the Cardinal five.
"Roughing it" never gave the Stan
ford team any impetus because the
team was lighter and had to depend
chiefly on the pass formations to ad
vance the ball. In this respect the
Janssen-Rogers-Anderson trio was the
most efficient. This group will all be
missing in the lineup this season, and
how to replace them is one of the out
standing problems. Nevers is the ideal
man to take "Lefty" Rogers' place.
With his weight, speed, and his knack
of handling the bal, he will fit into
of handling the ball, he will fit into
maining two cogs in the wheel will
be the hardest to substitute. "Nip"
will work better stationed under the
basket. Steele might do, but whether
he has the necessary speed is doubt
ful. As for the running guard, that
person has not yet been determined.
He will have to be fast, know how to
pass the ball, and be a fairly good goal
shooter.
