Tailored'to'Order Clothes in the
Styles that College Men Prefer
'
BECAUSE we have been serving the college
man for so many years we know the kind
of clothes he prefers. We have the kind of pat
terns he likes and we fashion his clothes ex
actly in accordance with his preferences. And
we tailor them to give lasting and satisfactory
service.
Need an overcoat? You'll see some
new models here—ready-to-wear—
that'll probably prompt you to say '
Hke that one—wrap it up."
