# WILLIAM F. LARAIA AND ELSIE HUGHES GIVE DUO-RECITAL
## Beauty and Imagination of Numbers Combined With Finished Technique 
### 
Imagination and beauty of tone
marked the playing of Elsie Cook
Hughes and William F. Laraia, San I
Francisco artists, in the recital which
they gave last evening in the Assem
bly hall.
Of the two performers, Mrs. Hughes
proved the more skillful. Her tech
nique showed to best advantage in the
variations of the Kreutzer Sonata, and
in the Presto movements of the same'
number. Laraia's interpretation of the'
Sonata was interesting, if not quite 1
adequate to the strength of the piece, j
His beautiful tone was particularly I
good in the slow movements and dou
ble stops. All through the program his!
handling of double stops was excel-;
lent.
Saint-Saens' Etude en forme de
valse, played by Mrs. Hughes, gave j
her an opportunity to display her j
brilliant technical skill. Her remark-i
ably sure toueli gave finish to the per
formance. The Chcpin Waltz in C !
sharp Minor was given as encore.
The Slavonic Dance of Dvorak-Kreis
ler was perhaps the most enjoyable:
number on the program. It possessed!
the imagination and sweetness of mel
ody distinctly lacking in the Sonata.;
and showed both artists at their best. I
Laraia's playing of the Polonaise |
was his finest interpretation. In spite!
of a hesitancy noticeable once or
twice, he seemed to have warmed upi
and become more absorbed in the j
spirit of the piece. As encore, he |
played Tartini-Kreisler's Variations on;
a Theme by Correlli.
