The performance of Bach's "Christ
mas Oratorio," Parts I and 11, to be
given Saturday evening, December 15,
at the Memorial Church, will be the
first complete presentation, with or

which will commence at 7:MO, is open
to the public.
Bach's work consists in its entirety
of six parts, one representing each day
of the Christmas festival as it was
celebrated in his native country. Only
the first two parts will be included in
the performance Saturday.
In this section are two great chor
uses, "Christians, Be Joyful," and
"Glory to God in the Highest." Inter
spersed with these choruses and the
solos are recitatives telling the Christ
inas story.
No pains are being spared to make
the performance conform to the old
traditions. Those in charge hope to
have the Memorial Church that eve
ning partake of the atmosphere of the
historic Thomas Kirche in Leipzic,
where Bach himself was cantor for
many years.
Ten members of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra and four soloists
have been secured for the vocaliza
tion. In addition, part of the Symphony
Orchestra of San Francisco will pro
vide a reproduction of the instrumen
tation called for by the composer.

for oboe d'amore. a rare and beautiful,
instrument which is practically obso
lete. Mach used this instrument as an
appropriate companion for the con
tralto voice, the two examples in the
oratorio being "Prepare Thyself. Zion,"
and the famous Slumber Song.
Miss Myrtle Shafer, of San Jose, will
preside at the organ, and Warren D.
Allen, University organist, will direct
the performance.
This is the twelfth Christmas ora
torio to be given in the Memorial
