# CARDS TO MEET SAN JOSE FIVE TONIGHT
## Game To Be First Season Test For Cardinal Quintet; Invaders' Squad Well Organized 
### 
s> The first test of the worth of the
j 1924 varsity basketball squad will be
applied tonight, when the San Jose
Y. M. C. A. engages Kerr's men in a
practice game at tbe pavilion at 8
o'clock.
Although no importance is attached
to the game, nearly all of the strong
candidates lior the varsity will get a
chance to indicate something of their
ability. Kerr will be able, through the
competition, to size up the squad a
little better and will make the first cut
of the squad next quarter with the
showing of the players in this game
in mind.
Bert Mills, center on the 1920 and
1921 Stanford basketball lives and one
of the best offensive forwards ever de
veloped here, is the outstanding star
of the Y. M. C. A. squad. The San Jose
men have been working out regularly
j since the fall and have had a number
| of practice games. The strength of
: the varsity's opponents has not been
; determined accurately, but the varsity
! men are expected to run up at least
a majority of the counts.
Students will find the doors of the
pavilion open to them, but Kerr does
not wish the game to have any bear
ing upon the season, except so far as
the internal structure of the team is
concerned. The first schedule game
will be held early next quarter, with
' an alumni team.
The circumstance of one bulky for
j ward and one light may turn out to
! be fortunate. Last year McHose was
so closely guarded that he had few
chances for open shots toward the end
of the season, but Nevers will prevent
two men being put on "Nip" again
this season. One of these men will
probably be left in the clear on many
of the plays, and either of them will
I be able to cash in on the advantage.
