# USE OF POSTERS ON QUAD TO BE LIMITED
## 
### 
Executive Committee rulings against
chalking up the Quad with advertise
ments for plays and dances and plac
ing posters promiscuously around the
campus will be strictly enforced by
Men's Council in the future, according
to a recent decision of that body.
. The rule which prohibits chalking
on the Quad proper and the placing of
posters on other than billboards erect
ed for the purpose has been violated
on numerous occasions in the past.
The most recent case for adjudication
was that concerning advertisements
for the Sophomore Play.
