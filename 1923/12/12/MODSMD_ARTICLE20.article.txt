Although the teapot seems to be in no danger of exploding, and the
tempest has not assumed any of the qualities of an honest-to-goodness
tea-time hurricane, the "advent" of the Ku Klux Klan on the campus
seems to have struck several people as something on which there is
large room for doubt.
Aside from the absurdity of a Klonklave of the Klux on the campus,
it is the purpose of this editorial to point out the reasons for condemna
tion of the organization as it exists in other communities. The facts to
be given are taken from the personal experience of the writer with the
Klan in Oregon, where this body runs city politics, state politics, and
educational politics.
As to the methods of the Klux; to be entirely fair one must leave
out of the discussion the means by which the Klan performs its self
appointed offices, and consider only its aims. The fact is, it is as impossible
to prove that the disguised men who cleaned out the oil fields in
Southern California were Kluxers as it is impossible to prove that the
men who, in the same disguise, strung up a citizen in Medford, Oregon,
were members of the same secret organization. When both good and
evil can be attributed to the Klux with equal doubt, no one can justify
a method which leaves so much leeway for evil, mob rule, and frank
breaking of the law.
As to the aims of the Klux; if they were the same, as they claim to be,
as the Roman Catholic, Jewish, and negro organizations, no one would
have any cause for kick. But they are not. Their purpose is not so
much for their own good as it is definitely against the people whom they
exclude. This statement is not generalization, hut fact, known to the
writer to be true.
As to the personnel of the Klux; whether because of suspicion, shame,
or simply to add to the effectiveness of the claptrap, the Klan as a rule
does not make its membership known, and especially keeps its face hidden
when on "official business." The fact that there is no provision for
maintaining the standard of membership, as shown in the fact that the
Klan does good work—although bv wrong methods—in one part of the
country, and commits fiendish crimes in another part, makes the member

ship at once open to suspicion, a suspicion which will not be refuted
until the Klan abandons its policy of secrecy, and comes out in the open
with its intolerant policies.
All of which i<* a great waste of space when one considers sanely the
possibility of be-sheeted horsemen on the Quad.

to prove that the disguised men who cleaned out the oil fields in
Southern California were Kluxers as it is impossible to prove that the
men who, in the same disguise, strung up a citizen in Medford, Oregon,
were members of the same secret organization. When both good and
evil can be attributed to the Klux with equal doubt, no one can justify
a method which leaves so much leeway for evil, mob rule, and frank
breaking of the law.
As to the aims of the Klux; if they were the same, as they claim to be,
as the Roman Catholic, Jewish, and negro organizations, no one would
have any cause for kick. But they are not. Their purpose is not so
much for their own good as it is definitely against the people whom they
exclude. This statement is not generalization, hut fact, known to the
writer to be true.
As to the personnel of the Klux; whether because of suspicion, shame,
or simply to add to the effectiveness of the claptrap, the Klan as a rule
does not make its membership known, and especially keeps its face hidden
when on "official business." The fact that there is no provision for
maintaining the standard of membership, as shown in the fact that the
Klan does good work—although bv wrong methods—in one part of the
country, and commits fiendish crimes in another part, makes the member

ship at once open to suspicion, a suspicion which will not be refuted
until the Klan abandons its policy of secrecy, and comes out in the open
with its intolerant policies.
All of which i<* a great waste of space when one considers sanely the
possibility of be-sheeted horsemen on the Quad.
Although the teapot seems to be in no danger of exploding, and the
tempest has not assumed any of the qualities of an honest-to-goodness
tea-time hurricane, the "advent" of the Ku Klux Klan on the campus
seems to have struck several people as something on which there is
large room for doubt.
Aside from the absurdity of a Klonklave of the Klux on the campus,
it is the purpose of this editorial to point out the reasons for condemna
tion of the organization as it exists in other communities. The facts to
be given are taken from the personal experience of the writer with the
Klan in Oregon, where this body runs city politics, state politics, and
educational politics.
As to the methods of the Klux; to be entirely fair one must leave
out of the discussion the means by which the Klan performs its self
appointed offices, and consider only its aims. The fact is, it is as impossible
to prove that the disguised men who cleaned out the oil fields in
Southern California were Kluxers as it is impossible to prove that the
men who, in the same disguise, strung up a citizen in Medford, Oregon,
were members of the same secret organization. When both good and
evil can be attributed to the Klux with equal doubt, no one can justify
a method which leaves so much leeway for evil, mob rule, and frank
