# PROMOTION
## 
### 
Starting* next quarter, Howard Bissell, '24, will be in charge of
Exchanges and will edit the news of the Daily once a week.
For those who know the talent and hard work required for promotion
to the rank of news editor, mention of the capability and willingness
which Rissell has displayed in all his work on the Daily is unnecessary.

Hugo, the midnight moth, has returned to the campus rejoicing that
he can hereafter make a midnight lunch off perambulating sheets and
laundry bags.

This issue of thp Daily Palo Alto will be the last until January 2.
