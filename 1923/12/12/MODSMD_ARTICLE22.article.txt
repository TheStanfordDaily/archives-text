# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,,
Dear Sir:
Mr. Wells was right. In his "Out
line of History" we find the following: j
"We are beginning to understand
something of what the world might be,
something of what our race might be-|
come, were it not for our still raw j
humanity . . . Make men and women]
only sufficiently jealous or fearful or
drunken or angry and the hot red eyes
of the cavemen will glare out at us
today. We have writing and teaching,
science and power; we have tamed
the beasts and schooled the lightning;
but. we are still only shambling to
wards the\light. We have tamed and
bred the beasts, but we still have to
tame and breed ourselves."
Ten years ago we should have said
that he was putting things somewhat!
strongly, but the events of the pasti
few years have been such as to shake'
the foundations from beneath our
blind complacency and to loose a sus
picion in our minds that all is not
as it should be.
For once more there has arisen j
among us the Ku Klux Klan, born of
the passion and prejudice, the jealousy
and hatred of the stormiest period of
American history; an organization
which, if we may believe our his
torians, has left in its wake an almost'
unparalleled record of outrages 1
against American citizens.
Once more it comes with its "holier
than thou" attitude and furnishes us
with an example of supreme egotism
in arrogating to itself the right to ad
minister "justice" independently of I
the laws of the land, a "justice"
warped by intolerance and conditioned
by race prejudice.
And now, with a past so question
able that its sponsors must needs an
ticipate a denial of their request even
that it be given a hearing, it seeks
admittances to Stanford. Its sponsors
would have us believe the Klan has
had a rebirth. They prate of ideals.
Ideals indeed! Of what avail is talk
of ideals if it is not bolstered up by a
record of performances in accordance
with those ideals?
If the organization has ideals why
should it tie about its neck such a
millstone as the name it bears? Since
when has it become necessary for any
organization with ideals to carry on
its activities under the cover of dark
ness and the protection of a mask?
Such professions of ideals move one
to cry out as has been done more
than once in the past:
"How can I hear what you SAY
when what you DO rings like thunder
in my ears?"
Sincerely yours,
CARL D. DUNCAN.

picion in our minds that all is not
as it should be.
For once more there has arisen j
among us the Ku Klux Klan, born of
the passion and prejudice, the jealousy
and hatred of the stormiest period of
American history; an organization
which, if we may believe our his
torians, has left in its wake an almost'
unparalleled record of outrages 1
against American citizens.
Once more it comes with its "holier
than thou" attitude and furnishes us
with an example of supreme egotism
in arrogating to itself the right to ad
minister "justice" independently of I
the laws of the land, a "justice"
warped by intolerance and conditioned
by race prejudice.
And now, with a past so question
able that its sponsors must needs an
ticipate a denial of their request even
that it be given a hearing, it seeks
admittances to Stanford. Its sponsors
would have us believe the Klan has
had a rebirth. They prate of ideals.
Ideals indeed! Of what avail is talk
of ideals if it is not bolstered up by a
record of performances in accordance
with those ideals?
If the organization has ideals why
should it tie about its neck such a
millstone as the name it bears? Since
when has it become necessary for any
organization with ideals to carry on
its activities under the cover of dark
ness and the protection of a mask?
Such professions of ideals move one
to cry out as has been done more
than once in the past:
"How can I hear what you SAY
when what you DO rings like thunder
in my ears?"
Sincerely yours,

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,,
Dear Sir:
Mr. Wells was right. In his "Out
line of History" we find the following: j
"We are beginning to understand
something of what the world might be,
something of what our race might be-|
come, were it not for our still raw j
humanity . . . Make men and women]
only sufficiently jealous or fearful or
drunken or angry and the hot red eyes
of the cavemen will glare out at us
today. We have writing and teaching,
science and power; we have tamed
the beasts and schooled the lightning;
but. we are still only shambling to
wards the\light. We have tamed and
bred the beasts, but we still have to
tame and breed ourselves."
Ten years ago we should have said
that he was putting things somewhat!
strongly, but the events of the pasti
few years have been such as to shake'
the foundations from beneath our
blind complacency and to loose a sus
picion in our minds that all is not
as it should be.
