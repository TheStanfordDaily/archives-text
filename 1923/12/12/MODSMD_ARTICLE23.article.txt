"THE BAD MAN,, —Stanford Theater.
Holbrook Bllnn and "The Bad Man."
The two are inseparable as Siamese
twins. Blinn, as the Mexican bandit
Lopez, captures the picture as com-|
pletely as he did the play. If you can't!
imagine yourself thoroughly liking a
caricature of the famous Pancho Villa,
see Holbrook Blinn.
Under the direction of Edwin Ca
rewe this screen version of the play
by Porter Emerson Browne is a really,
good picture. The dialogue is faithful,
and you can almost hear Lopez and j
his curiously-twisted English. On the!
stage it was this latter that brought j
most of the laughs. This and the gouty!
ravings of one Uncle Henry, who rides,
a wheelchair all over the scene.
There is an entertaining situation
in the story: The hero loves the girl,
but her husband is the insect in the
cuticura. Lopez laughs it off with the
simple border expedient of having hisj
man shoot the husband. He doesn't!
kill him. But later, when it is believed j
that Lopez is dead, the incorrigible
bandit appears just as friend husband
is about to send the hero and his
beloved into the great Guess, and
shoots him for good this time, coolly
lighting a cigarette as he does so. The
scene gets by big, and you'll enjoy
every foot of the film. —C. N. H.
