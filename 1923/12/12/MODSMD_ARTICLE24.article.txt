# THORNHILL TO ASSIST KERR IN COACHING BASKETBALL
## "Tiny" Experienced in College and Professional Court Game; McHose, Steele, and Oliva Are Only Three Letter-Men Back 
### William F, Leiser 
Coaches Andrew Kerr and C. E.
Thornhill have a real task before them
in building a basketball five which
will compete evenly with other Coast
Conference teams for the champion
ship of Pacific Regions.
The big varsity line coach, "Tiny,"
has not been generally heralded as a
director of basketball, but he is never
theless an official assistant to Kerr,
and will take up active duties at the
gymnasium in January.
is experienced in both
university and professional basketball,
he is thoroughly familiar with the
Kerr court game, and his addition to
the coaching stuff should do much to
build a winning five.
Heretofore basketball coaches have
been without assistants at Stanford.
Three Veterans Back
Captain McHose, Gurdon Steele,
center, and Dave Oliva, guard, are the
three veterans present on the squad.
The captain is very light, but pos
sessed of sufficient ability to be won
derfully effective when working with
the right sort of a heavy teammate.
Tn all probability Ernie Nevers will
be that teammate, and the two at for
wards have far more than the average
native ability, though Kerr and Thorn
hill must do a great deal of work be
fore the two may become an ideal
pair.
If one as humble as the writer may
presume to point out present faults
which will be corrected, he notices the
following: Though fast, McHose. is
still small, and he therefore cannot af
ford to be too deliberate. To date he
has not avoided the fault of trying too
hard to be shifty. Kerr will undoubted
ly coach him to rely more on speed
and quick passing, as the worst fault
a basketball man may commit is in
being caught with the ball, or in being
too slow in making the proper pass.
Mcl-lose has a natural eye, and as
he is perfectly at home on the court,
he may become one of the best for
wards in the conference before the
sason is over.
Nevers-McHose Combination
In Nevers the coaches another
player of excellent ability, and also
with certain faults. Nevers is too
quick. This error is not a bad one,
particularly when the player has an
eye as good as has Nevers, but never
theless he will hit the basket more
often if he is a bit more deliberate.
On the floor both Nevers and McHose
are fast and effective. The former is

big enough to make up what the cap
tain lacks in weight. Undoubtedly he
will figure strongly in starting plays
from the center of the floor, and if he
gets to hitting the hoop with fre
quency opposing teams can be counted
on to keep more than one man watch
ing him, which may allow McHose
a chance for very deadly work. The
old Righter-Davies combination may
be repeated.
Steele and Mooney will likely work
a great deal at center. Neither one is
an experienced player. Steele is a
figliter and his best work is excellent.
If he could play always as he did at
U. S. C. last season he would be hard
to beat.
Oliva is the original "tough guard."
Strong and heavy, he can do his full
share of work in the defensive end
of the court, and he has been known


Gurdon Steele, veteran at center
to drop long shots through the basket.
He is not too experienced.
Hoffman Injured
Hoffman in the writer's opinion was
one of the best bets for the present
season until he hurt his knee. His
work showed considerable training
and experience, he was fairly heavy,
and neither too fast nor too slow. He
was very good in field shots, and could
have made either a guard or forward.
In basketball a bad knee is among the
worst of handicaps, and likely he will
not get into the game until late sea
son at least. Mc√üurney looks rather
well in the role of a fast guard, and
may make the berth. Mitchell may
look as strong when he reports. for
practice. Shipkey may alternate with
Oliva. Reserves are not at all plenti
ful.
With good luck and without fur
ther accidents Kerr and Thornhill may
develop a great team before the sea
son is over. However, the usual pre
liminary prospect stories which al
ways talk of "wonder teams" should
be discredited.
If we have a great team this season
it will be only because Kerr, Thorn
hill, and McHose, by virtue of hard
work, will iron out the difficulties and
get a smooth working outfit together.
They may be able to do this, but stu
dents should not expect phenomenal

success at the first of every season.
There is a lot of labor and worry con
nected with the production of any
winning team.
California Better Than Last Year
California this season has a system
trained outfit, with experienced men.
Kincaid is one of the best guards in
the conference, and Talt Is a danger
ous forward. Other experienced play
ers are on hand, and Coach Wight has
shown before that he is to be re
spected as an opponent.
There is a good quantity of native
ability in Coach Kerr's squad, and
with proper breaks and no accidents
development may reach the point of
"making the grade."
The reserves, who include several
men of potential ability, are: Alabas
ter, Alexander, Atwell, Bragg, Dris
col, Coen, Frazier, Grace, Granger,
Hodkinson, Logan, Mannoccir, Mor
rison, Mooney, Neer, O'Hara, Smith,
Steele, Steffan, Stewart, Campbell,
Cleaveland, Mitchell, Kirwan, and
Middleton.
