## THE 						SHINING PYRAMID 
### Arthur Machen 
It was said of old, by a person so
wise that I fancy it must have been
Adam speaking directly after the first
bite of apple, "A man's friends are his
worst enemies." The remark holds
true for Mr. Arthur Machen, whose
enthusiastic acquaintances have col
lected his works in an elegant and
costly limited edition, in order to bring
him before the elect with dignity.
This view deals with the volume
called "The Shining Pyramid," which
contains essays and short tales written
for various periodicals from about 1890
up to the present time. Mr. Vincent
Starrett, the editor, emphasizes in an
affectionate foreword his personal re
sponsibility for digging these bits out
of the musty magazine files (in some
cases, those of magazines now defunct)
in which they lay hidden and forgotten
even by the author; but he emphasizes
also the importance of the collection
as showing the "beginnings of genius."
Gratuitous Rattling of Bones.
He does not say the thing that
strikes the reader most strongly in
looking through the volume; as an
"ardent Macheniac," which he allows

himself to be, he is perhaps not con
scious of it; but the fact is, that these
sketches are less the buddings of a
new and lusty genius than they are
historical curiosities from a literary
age now past and gone. They are
typical of the decadent nineties, and
if they are truly typical of Arthur
Machen too, why then Arthur Machen
is no more than a disconsolate ghost,
and his friends are showing a mistaken
zeal in rattling his bones.
It is only to be expected that this
general air of regret for old forgotten
far-off things, this petulant rejection
of everything young and modern,
should foster in him the art which the
pessimist creates—art not for man's
sake, but for art's sake only.
Reality Avoided.
In all of these skits, the conscious
elcgance of expression, and the labor
iously deft turning of a phrase are of
far greater importance than any sense
of actual contact with life; in fact,
even in the contemporary tales, Mr.
Machen seems deliberately to avoid it.
Two stories in the book, "Out of the
Earth" and "The Shining Pyramid,"
go even further. The editor considers
them of great importance; he says so
in his foreword, gives them the initial
position in the volume, and names it
from one of them. We may take them
as characteristic of the whole Machen,

since "The Shining Pyramid" was
written in the eighteen-nineties, and
"Out oi the Earth" during the late
war. They are almost exactly alike.
Both give, behind a clever screen of
apparent realism, a creeping loathe
some suggestion of fleshly forces
which live in the bowels of the earth,
and crawl out to debauch human be
ings with the sight and sound of their
unspeakable orgies. This is the clev
erest, the most artful, the most skillful,
original, and finished of Mr. Machen's
work in this book.
I am afraid that Mr. Machen might

be scandalized to hear that he is false
to his own standards of beauty, and
that Sandburg and Van Loon and
Lindsay and Hudson and Milliken—
even in some sense Edwin Lewis and
Kipling and Tarkington—are true to it.
But these are a few of the modern men
who regard life with delicate senses,
too fearless to resent or desert it, and
keen to perceive behind it the implica
tions and mysteries that will persist in
any age, as long as men are healthy
minded enough to seek them out.
Those that have ears to hear will al
ways hear.—M. B.
