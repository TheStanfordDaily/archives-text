# Constantinople Keen For Many Holidays Despite Prohibition
## Bosphorus City Becomes Modern Municipality Under Turkish Republic, Says Letter Received by By Hoover War Library 
### 
Constantinople! Fifteen, ten years
ago a city of breathless mystery and
dark intrigue. Today, a modern mu
nicipality with prohibition and its own
postal service. Indications now are
that all of Turkey will progress rapidly
under the new republican government
—providing the people can learn to
love work more and holidays less.
The Turk is evidently a glutton for
gala days, judging from a letter re
ceived by the Hoover War Library
from one of its Constantinople corre
spondents. In addition to the general
secular celebrations for all the popula
tion, there are numerous national and
religious days otJfcerved by the differ
ent communities. The number of bank
holidays is declared to be "scandal
ously large." Schools ,too, are given
frequent holidays.
"On October 6, we had a general
college holiday to help celebrate the
triumphal entry of the Kemalist troops
into Constantinople," says the letter.
"Today is the first day of an enforced
three-day holiday, ordered by the Min
ister of Public Instruction, in honor of
the declaration of the Turkish Re
public, and the schools are under the
necessity of stopping classes for three
days."
The city has been beautifully deco

rated during the last week. At night
the mosque minaret is sharply outlined
by electric illumination, now in wide
use. The villages along the Bosphorus
are gay with street dances, to the mu
sic of flute and drum, and the crowds
of merrymakers are so large that it is
impossible to drive through the thor
oughfares.
Meanwhile, Christians, Ottoman
subjects as well as others, are being
forced from their positions. Firms are
ordered and compelled to employ only
Turks. Foreigners, who have for
years controlled the wealth of Con
stantinople. are literally ordered to
turn over to the Turks the commerce,
trade and industry, in an effort to
create an opportunity for native enter
prise. But the Turk is busy celebrat
ing his newly won political freedom.

Oriental festivities, coupled with orien
tal indolence, have thus far proved
disastrous to any steady or effective
work. The Turkish press continually,
and without apparent result, empha
sizes the need of the population to

"buckle down."
If the Turk were to embrace Chris
tianity, it would be little more surpris
ing. than his turning prohibitionist.
Nevertheless, Constantinople is now
"dry."

Constantinople! Fifteen, ten years
ago a city of breathless mystery and
dark intrigue. Today, a modern mu
nicipality with prohibition and its own
postal service. Indications now are
that all of Turkey will progress rapidly
under the new republican government
—providing the people can learn to
love work more and holidays less.
The Turk is evidently a glutton for
gala days, judging from a letter re
ceived by the Hoover War Library
from one of its Constantinople corre
spondents. In addition to the general
secular celebrations for all the popula
tion, there are numerous national and
religious days otJfcerved by the differ
ent communities. The number of bank
holidays is declared to be "scandal
ously large." Schools ,too, are given
frequent holidays.
"On October 6, we had a general
college holiday to help celebrate the
triumphal entry of the Kemalist troops
into Constantinople," says the letter.
"Today is the first day of an enforced
three-day holiday, ordered by the Min
ister of Public Instruction, in honor of
the declaration of the Turkish Re
public, and the schools are under the
necessity of stopping classes for three
days."
The city has been beautifully deco

rated during the last week. At night
the mosque minaret is sharply outlined
by electric illumination, now in wide
use. The villages along the Bosphorus
are gay with street dances, to the mu
sic of flute and drum, and the crowds
of merrymakers are so large that it is
impossible to drive through the thor
oughfares.
