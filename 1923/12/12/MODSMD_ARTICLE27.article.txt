# THE 						IMPORTUNATE
## ADRIAN, a country boy. RUTH, his friend. 
### 
SCENE:
(A country road. An old rail fence sags along beside
it. At R. C. the fcnce is broken by a narrow gate; at
L. C. a tangle of blackberry vines climbs over it. It is
night. Moonlight glistens on the white dust of the
road; the blackberry thicket is an ominous black mass.
Ruth is seated on a stump by the gate. Adrian lies
at her feet, facing the blackberry thicket. He is taller
than Ruth, and is perhaps a year older.
Adian: There is a rabbit in those bushes.
Ruth: Is there? Oh, where? Throw a stick, so
that I may see him run.
Adrian: No. Why should I? Resides, he might
not be there.
Ruth: But you said there was a rabbit in the brush.
Didn't you see him?
Adrian: No.
Ruth: Then how—?
Adrian: Well, there might be .you know. I can
think there is, and that is just as good as if there really
was one there, because I can imagine i see his big brown
eyes and wiggly nose—. But if I threw a stick, then I
would know that there was 110 rabbit there.
Ruth: Ho, you are funny. If you threw a stick and
there should happen to be one there, then you might
catch it and have it for dinner —in a stew, or fried,
maybe with onions—
Adrian: Oh, hush! Don't talk about onions.
Ruth: Why not?
Adrian: (Hesitatingly.) Well, it is a nice night,
and then —the moon is full.
Ruth: What of that? Onions are onions, whether
the moon is full or not.
Adrian: (Disgusted.) Ah —
Ruth: But it is pretty, isn't it? Like a—like a big
cheese.
Adrian: Cheese? Heavens, do you think only of
things to eat?
Ruth: Well, isn't it? Just because you write poems
about me, you needn't to be so—so squeegee.
Adrian: (Somewhat embarrassed.) Well, yes, it is
like a cheese.
Ruth: There! That's what I said. (She pauses.)
They used to tell us that the moon was made of green
cheese. You remember? I wonder what it really is—
so yellow"—>
Adrian: Green cheese, if you like.
Ruth: You don't really believe that? Or are you—
you're making fun of me!
Adrian: No, I'm not. It is green cheese, if you
want it to be. It is whatever you wish—a cheese, or a
fairy ship, or—or anything.
Ruth: What is it to you? (Adrian is silent.) Tell
me. Say something, Grumpy.
Adrian: What?
Ruth: Anything; I don't—oh, be still.
(Another pause. Ruth stirs impatiently.)
Ruth: Well, I ought to go in. I've all that algebra
to do over. I don't see why Miss Ryan had to make
me do that. She just picks on me.
Adrian: (Absently.) 'S too bad.
Ruth: (On the verge of tears.) Well,.she does. She
don't need to make me do that. What good is algebra
ever going to do me? I won't need algebra after —
after I'm grown up, will I, Adrian?
Adrian: I don't know —I guess not, maybe.
Ruth: Well, I won't. Anyway, she—but then, you
don't care.
Adrian: Why, Ruth, I do too. I like you a lot. You
know that.
Ruth: You don't. You can't. If you do, why are
you so still, and —and mean? Why don't you ever tell
me you do?
Adrian: Why, I don't mean to be—mean. Honest,
Ruth. It's just that I—(he hesitates, fumbles for a
word, and stops.)

Ruth: And you do—you do care about me?
Adrian: (With an unhappiness that he gallantly con
ceals.) You know I do.
Ruth: Then tell me—tell me now. Truly!
Adrian: Ruth, I—T— (He cannot say the words.
Instead, he kisses her suddenly. She clings to him.)
Ruth: Adrian—
Adrian: (Turning away suddenly.) Oh, I shouldn't
—It's no good, now, Ruth. Why did you— Oh, hang
it all.
Ruth: Why, Adrian, what—
Adrian: Look, you know a while ago I said there
Was a rabbit there?
Ruth: Yes.
Adrian: And you wanted me to throw a stick?
Ruth: Why, yes; but—
Adrian: Well, look! (He seizes a stick from the
ground, and hurls it into the tangle of vines. It drops
to the earth; there is silence.)
Adrian: There, you see? There was nothing there.
Nothing there at all. There never is—if you make sure.
You—you always want to make sure. And there was
nothing there.
Ruth: Adrian—please! (She sinks to the stump and
weeps, childlike, her head suifk in her arms.)
Adrian: (Instantly demoralized.) Ah, Ruth, I'm
sorry. I didn't metn—You see, I— Don't cry, Ruth.
Ruth: (In a terrible, albeit muffled voice.) Go
away, you—you BOY!
Adrian: Well, —all right. I'm sorry. But you al
ways want to make sure. (He pauses helplessly. The
sobbing continues.) Well, goodbye. (There is no an
swer. He sighs, and starts slowly off. N*ear the exit
he pauses wistfully.) Goodbye, Ruth. (There is no
answer.) —D. L.

ever going to do me? I won't need algebra after —
after I'm grown up, will I, Adrian?
Adrian: I don't know —I guess not, maybe.
Ruth: Well, I won't. Anyway, she—but then, you
don't care.
Adrian: Why, Ruth, I do too. I like you a lot. You
know that.
Ruth: You don't. You can't. If you do, why are
you so still, and —and mean? Why don't you ever tell
me you do?
Adrian: Why, I don't mean to be—mean. Honest,
Ruth. It's just that I—(he hesitates, fumbles for a
word, and stops.)

Ruth: And you do—you do care about me?
Adrian: (With an unhappiness that he gallantly con
ceals.) You know I do.
Ruth: Then tell me—tell me now. Truly!
Adrian: Ruth, I—T— (He cannot say the words.
Instead, he kisses her suddenly. She clings to him.)
Ruth: Adrian—
Adrian: (Turning away suddenly.) Oh, I shouldn't
—It's no good, now, Ruth. Why did you— Oh, hang
it all.
Ruth: Why, Adrian, what—
Adrian: Look, you know a while ago I said there
Was a rabbit there?
Ruth: Yes.
Adrian: And you wanted me to throw a stick?
Ruth: Why, yes; but—
Adrian: Well, look! (He seizes a stick from the
ground, and hurls it into the tangle of vines. It drops
to the earth; there is silence.)
Adrian: There, you see? There was nothing there.
Nothing there at all. There never is—if you make sure.
You—you always want to make sure. And there was
nothing there.
Ruth: Adrian—please! (She sinks to the stump and
weeps, childlike, her head suifk in her arms.)
Adrian: (Instantly demoralized.) Ah, Ruth, I'm
sorry. I didn't metn—You see, I— Don't cry, Ruth.
Ruth: (In a terrible, albeit muffled voice.) Go
away, you—you BOY!
Adrian: Well, —all right. I'm sorry. But you al
ways want to make sure. (He pauses helplessly. The
sobbing continues.) Well, goodbye. (There is no an
swer. He sighs, and starts slowly off. N*ear the exit
he pauses wistfully.) Goodbye, Ruth. (There is no
answer.) —D. L.
(From the Gridiron)
SCENE:
(A country road. An old rail fence sags along beside
it. At R. C. the fcnce is broken by a narrow gate; at
L. C. a tangle of blackberry vines climbs over it. It is
night. Moonlight glistens on the white dust of the
road; the blackberry thicket is an ominous black mass.
Ruth is seated on a stump by the gate. Adrian lies
at her feet, facing the blackberry thicket. He is taller
than Ruth, and is perhaps a year older.
Adian: There is a rabbit in those bushes.
Ruth: Is there? Oh, where? Throw a stick, so
that I may see him run.
Adrian: No. Why should I? Resides, he might
not be there.
Ruth: But you said there was a rabbit in the brush.
Didn't you see him?
Adrian: No.
Ruth: Then how—?
Adrian: Well, there might be .you know. I can
think there is, and that is just as good as if there really
was one there, because I can imagine i see his big brown
eyes and wiggly nose—. But if I threw a stick, then I
would know that there was 110 rabbit there.
Ruth: Ho, you are funny. If you threw a stick and
there should happen to be one there, then you might
catch it and have it for dinner —in a stew, or fried,
maybe with onions—
Adrian: Oh, hush! Don't talk about onions.
Ruth: Why not?
Adrian: (Hesitatingly.) Well, it is a nice night,
and then —the moon is full.
Ruth: What of that? Onions are onions, whether
the moon is full or not.
Adrian: (Disgusted.) Ah —
Ruth: But it is pretty, isn't it? Like a—like a big
cheese.
Adrian: Cheese? Heavens, do you think only of
things to eat?
Ruth: Well, isn't it? Just because you write poems
about me, you needn't to be so—so squeegee.
Adrian: (Somewhat embarrassed.) Well, yes, it is
like a cheese.
Ruth: There! That's what I said. (She pauses.)
They used to tell us that the moon was made of green
cheese. You remember? I wonder what it really is—
so yellow"—>
Adrian: Green cheese, if you like.
Ruth: You don't really believe that? Or are you—
you're making fun of me!
Adrian: No, I'm not. It is green cheese, if you
want it to be. It is whatever you wish—a cheese, or a
fairy ship, or—or anything.
Ruth: What is it to you? (Adrian is silent.) Tell
me. Say something, Grumpy.
Adrian: What?
Ruth: Anything; I don't—oh, be still.
(Another pause. Ruth stirs impatiently.)
Ruth: Well, I ought to go in. I've all that algebra
to do over. I don't see why Miss Ryan had to make
me do that. She just picks on me.
Adrian: (Absently.) 'S too bad.
Ruth: (On the verge of tears.) Well,.she does. She

Adrian: No. Why should I? Resides, he might
not be there.
Ruth: But you said there was a rabbit in the brush.
Didn't you see him?
Adrian: No.
Ruth: Then how—?
Adrian: Well, there might be .you know. I can
think there is, and that is just as good as if there really
was one there, because I can imagine i see his big brown
eyes and wiggly nose—. But if I threw a stick, then I
would know that there was 110 rabbit there.
Ruth: Ho, you are funny. If you threw a stick and
there should happen to be one there, then you might
catch it and have it for dinner —in a stew, or fried,
maybe with onions—
Adrian: Oh, hush! Don't talk about onions.
Ruth: Why not?
Adrian: (Hesitatingly.) Well, it is a nice night,
and then —the moon is full.
Ruth: What of that? Onions are onions, whether
the moon is full or not.
Adrian: (Disgusted.) Ah —
Ruth: But it is pretty, isn't it? Like a—like a big
cheese.
Adrian: Cheese? Heavens, do you think only of
things to eat?
Ruth: Well, isn't it? Just because you write poems
about me, you needn't to be so—so squeegee.
Adrian: (Somewhat embarrassed.) Well, yes, it is
like a cheese.
Ruth: There! That's what I said. (She pauses.)
They used to tell us that the moon was made of green
cheese. You remember? I wonder what it really is—
so yellow"—>
Adrian: Green cheese, if you like.
Ruth: You don't really believe that? Or are you—
you're making fun of me!
Adrian: No, I'm not. It is green cheese, if you
want it to be. It is whatever you wish—a cheese, or a
fairy ship, or—or anything.
Ruth: What is it to you? (Adrian is silent.) Tell
me. Say something, Grumpy.
Adrian: What?
Ruth: Anything; I don't—oh, be still.
(Another pause. Ruth stirs impatiently.)
Ruth: Well, I ought to go in. I've all that algebra
to do over. I don't see why Miss Ryan had to make
me do that. She just picks on me.
Adrian: (Absently.) 'S too bad.
Ruth: (On the verge of tears.) Well,.she does. She
don't need to make me do that. What good is algebra
ever going to do me? I won't need algebra after —
after I'm grown up, will I, Adrian?
Adrian: I don't know —I guess not, maybe.
Ruth: Well, I won't. Anyway, she—but then, you
don't care.
Adrian: Why, Ruth, I do too. I like you a lot. You
know that.
Ruth: You don't. You can't. If you do, why are
you so still, and —and mean? Why don't you ever tell
me you do?
Adrian: Why, I don't mean to be—mean. Honest,
Ruth. It's just that I—(he hesitates, fumbles for a
word, and stops.)

Ruth: And you do—you do care about me?
Adrian: (With an unhappiness that he gallantly con
ceals.) You know I do.
Ruth: Then tell me—tell me now. Truly!
Adrian: Ruth, I—T— (He cannot say the words.
Instead, he kisses her suddenly. She clings to him.)
Ruth: Adrian—
Adrian: (Turning away suddenly.) Oh, I shouldn't
—It's no good, now, Ruth. Why did you— Oh, hang
it all.
Ruth: Why, Adrian, what—
Adrian: Look, you know a while ago I said there
Was a rabbit there?
Ruth: Yes.
Adrian: And you wanted me to throw a stick?
Ruth: Why, yes; but—
Adrian: Well, look! (He seizes a stick from the
ground, and hurls it into the tangle of vines. It drops
to the earth; there is silence.)
Adrian: There, you see? There was nothing there.
Nothing there at all. There never is—if you make sure.
You—you always want to make sure. And there was
nothing there.
Ruth: Adrian—please! (She sinks to the stump and
weeps, childlike, her head suifk in her arms.)
Adrian: (Instantly demoralized.) Ah, Ruth, I'm
sorry. I didn't metn—You see, I— Don't cry, Ruth.
Ruth: (In a terrible, albeit muffled voice.) Go
away, you—you BOY!
Adrian: Well, —all right. I'm sorry. But you al
ways want to make sure. (He pauses helplessly. The
sobbing continues.) Well, goodbye. (There is no an
swer. He sighs, and starts slowly off. N*ear the exit
he pauses wistfully.) Goodbye, Ruth. (There is no
answer.) —D. L.

SCENE:
(A country road. An old rail fence sags along beside
it. At R. C. the fcnce is broken by a narrow gate; at
L. C. a tangle of blackberry vines climbs over it. It is
night. Moonlight glistens on the white dust of the
road; the blackberry thicket is an ominous black mass.
Ruth is seated on a stump by the gate. Adrian lies
at her feet, facing the blackberry thicket. He is taller
than Ruth, and is perhaps a year older.
Adian: There is a rabbit in those bushes.
Ruth: Is there? Oh, where? Throw a stick, so
that I may see him run.
