# Complete Freedom Given To Students in Middle Western Universities
## Comparison Made Between Wisconsin and Stanford Universities by Professor Graham, H. Stuart 
### 
"The Co-ed's Paradise" is the
name given to the University of
Wisconsin, according to Professor
Graham H. Stuart of the Political
Science department, lately trans
ferred from Wisconsin, where he
taught for six years.
"There are no restrictions as to
the number of dances a living
group may give a year." he said.
The social activities of the students
are not limited to any noticeable
extent."
In spite of this social freedom,
the students of Wisconsin work
much harder than those at Stan
ford, Stuart believes. Having once

passed the more difficult requirements of Stanford, a
student feels he can "rest 011 his oars" in his work.
"It may be in part the climate," he added. "When it
is twenty below zero in Wisconsin, there is nothing to
do but work, while here the weather is too nice to feel
like settling down."
Professor Stuart expressed surprise at the absence of
interests in politics and international questions at Stan
ford. At the University of Wisconsin, located at Madi
son, the state capital, there is a sustained interest on
the part of the students in political issues, he said. The
attitude at Stanford may be due to the lack of attention
given to this field by the University. He remarked on
the relatively few women who study political science
here.
