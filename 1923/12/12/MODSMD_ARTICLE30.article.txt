### 
A large letter of foreign shape, plas

last zveck.
Enclosed was the following story,
written within sound of rifle fire, of
the conditions in Germany under mob
rule. The signature was "IV. Ernest
Aitken, cx-'25."
Aitken, zvho zi'as registered in me
chanical engineering, was forced to
leave college and go to England because
of illness in his family. Erom there the
family zvent to Hamburg, where they
were caught in the mob uprisings.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this oppor

On Sunday, October 28, the unrest,
long felt in Hamburg, began to be
noticed by a subtle undercurrent of
restlessness to be seen in most of the
lower classes. The working classes,
paid in the ever-falling mark, were
hardly able to buy their necessary
food, and prices had risen day by day.
Early Monday morning there was a
series of small riots, and a few gro
cery stores raided. Prepared as we
were for trouble, we were, however,
astonished at the suddenness and in
tensity of the outbreak which oc
curred in Bambeck, a suburb of Ham
burg.
Egged on by their needs, and helped
by Russian Soviet agents, the Com
jnunits broke into a large riot on.
Monday evening. They stormed and
took the district police station, and
stole all the weapons they could lay
hands on.
The next day the police watchmen
were found, their throats cut from ear
to ear.
Trench Dug Across Streets
In a night the town was transformed.
Trees were chopped down, barricades
thrown up, trenches dug across the
streets and the paving stones used to
build the parapets.
Then started the bitter struggle be
tween police and rioters, a struggle
which lasted a week.
The police rushed armored cars,
tanks, and machine guns to the scene
of the conflict. The Communists Were
helped by their women folk, who took
them food, etc., right into the trenches.
Only the lack of an able leader and
concentrated action among the Com
munists enabled the police to gain
an upper hand.
Bullets flew around the streets like
hail, and many a harmless passerby
fell, a victim to some stray projectile.
Especially vivid is the memory of a
young girl who left her home to cross
the street to the bakery; no sooner
had she set her foot outside the door,
when a stray bullet caught her in
the side of the and she dropped
without a sound, and lay in an ever
spreading pool of blood, before the
very eyes of her terror-stricken moth
er. who watched her from a window.
Besides the actually pitched battles,
there took place a guerilla warfare
through the whole of Hamburg, and
sudden bursts of shooting could be
heard at all times in different quar
ters of the city. Here, a policeman, his
ears torn off, was found hanging to a
lamp post, dead. There, a Communist
was huddled in a corner in the street,
slowly bleeding to death from gun
shot wounds. Every minute, ambu
lances passed whizzing by.
Guerillas Snipe at Police
Out of a darkened window a Mauser
spat viciously, and four of a earful of
police passing by, were added to the
ever-growing list of victims. Follow
ing this a proclamation was issued
that all windows not kept shut after
dark would be shot at.
Ten was the curfew hour and no one
might walk the streets after that time.
If caught doing so the penalty was a
fine and imprisonment, and if one was
challenged by a policeman and tried
to get away the police shot to kill. It
was not healthy to try—the police are
not half bad shots.
When finally things calmed down,
disheartened and disillusioned Com
munists were made prisoners by the
dozens. The hospitals were full of
wounded and dying while carts piled
high with rude, unpainted coffins kept
rolling by my house.
The result: Houses torn down, men
killed, hundreds wounded, money that
could have been used for bread wast
ed on ammunition.

A BIG REWARD
Kolb and Dill, Now Playing at the Curran
"A BIG REWARD" with Kolb anil Dill at the Curran
this week offers thrills as well as fun. This new play
is a three-act mystery comedy, being a satire on the
craze for mysterious plots, although its own mystery is
not explained until the very end. And it is so cleverly
written that you are laughing one minute and guessing
the next.
"A Big Reward" is a crook story. It has to do with
the theft of a valuable painting, its recovery and the
conviction of the thief, which brings a reward of
$200,000. William Kolb has the part of a man who plans
to raise money for his friend by sending him to prison
as the discovered thief, collecting the reward, and pre
senting it to him when he comes out. Max Dill is a
waiter in a hotel, and if you aren't laughing at Kolb's

clever lines, you laugh at his partner.
The cast is a good one. May Cloy as the Norwegian
hotel maid, and Rose Ludwig as the woman detective,
interpret their parts very well. Better still, they speak
with the most beautiful distinctness, all of which is
particularly soothing. Edward Woods as the desperate
young man, and Richard Allan as the rough-neck de
tective, measure up to the demand put upon them.
Even the orchestra is different. Under the direction
of Leo Flanders, it opens the play with the members
coming out individually from the stage. Each soloist
carries the instrument he plays—even the pianist brings
out a small piano. Miss Geneve Butler sings several
selections between the second and third acts, although
it is somewhat painful to hear. "Yes, We Have No
Bananas," sung with operatic paraphrase. But then
Kolb and Dill make you forget that. —M. A. C.

tensity of the outbreak which oc
curred in Bambeck, a suburb of Ham
burg.
Egged on by their needs, and helped
by Russian Soviet agents, the Com
jnunits broke into a large riot on.
Monday evening. They stormed and
took the district police station, and
stole all the weapons they could lay
hands on.
The next day the police watchmen
were found, their throats cut from ear

Trench Dug Across Streets
In a night the town was transformed.
Trees were chopped down, barricades
thrown up, trenches dug across the
streets and the paving stones used to
build the parapets.
Then started the bitter struggle be
tween police and rioters, a struggle
which lasted a week.
The police rushed armored cars,
tanks, and machine guns to the scene
of the conflict. The Communists Were
helped by their women folk, who took
them food, etc., right into the trenches.
Only the lack of an able leader and
concentrated action among the Com
munists enabled the police to gain
an upper hand.
Bullets flew around the streets like
hail, and many a harmless passerby
fell, a victim to some stray projectile.
Especially vivid is the memory of a
young girl who left her home to cross
the street to the bakery; no sooner
had she set her foot outside the door,
when a stray bullet caught her in
the side of the and she dropped
without a sound, and lay in an ever
spreading pool of blood, before the
very eyes of her terror-stricken moth
er. who watched her from a window.
Besides the actually pitched battles,
there took place a guerilla warfare
through the whole of Hamburg, and
sudden bursts of shooting could be
heard at all times in different quar
ters of the city. Here, a policeman, his
ears torn off, was found hanging to a
lamp post, dead. There, a Communist
was huddled in a corner in the street,
slowly bleeding to death from gun
shot wounds. Every minute, ambu
lances passed whizzing by.
Guerillas Snipe at Police
Out of a darkened window a Mauser
spat viciously, and four of a earful of
police passing by, were added to the
ever-growing list of victims. Follow
ing this a proclamation was issued
that all windows not kept shut after
dark would be shot at.
Ten was the curfew hour and no one
might walk the streets after that time.
If caught doing so the penalty was a
fine and imprisonment, and if one was
challenged by a policeman and tried
to get away the police shot to kill. It
was not healthy to try—the police are
not half bad shots.
When finally things calmed down,
disheartened and disillusioned Com
munists were made prisoners by the
dozens. The hospitals were full of
wounded and dying while carts piled
high with rude, unpainted coffins kept
rolling by my house.
The result: Houses torn down, men
killed, hundreds wounded, money that
could have been used for bread wast
ed on ammunition.

A BIG REWARD
Kolb and Dill, Now Playing at the Curran
"A BIG REWARD" with Kolb anil Dill at the Curran
this week offers thrills as well as fun. This new play
is a three-act mystery comedy, being a satire on the
craze for mysterious plots, although its own mystery is
not explained until the very end. And it is so cleverly
written that you are laughing one minute and guessing
the next.
"A Big Reward" is a crook story. It has to do with
the theft of a valuable painting, its recovery and the
conviction of the thief, which brings a reward of
$200,000. William Kolb has the part of a man who plans
to raise money for his friend by sending him to prison
as the discovered thief, collecting the reward, and pre
senting it to him when he comes out. Max Dill is a
waiter in a hotel, and if you aren't laughing at Kolb's

clever lines, you laugh at his partner.
The cast is a good one. May Cloy as the Norwegian
hotel maid, and Rose Ludwig as the woman detective,
interpret their parts very well. Better still, they speak
with the most beautiful distinctness, all of which is
particularly soothing. Edward Woods as the desperate
young man, and Richard Allan as the rough-neck de
tective, measure up to the demand put upon them.
Even the orchestra is different. Under the direction
of Leo Flanders, it opens the play with the members
coming out individually from the stage. Each soloist
carries the instrument he plays—even the pianist brings
out a small piano. Miss Geneve Butler sings several
selections between the second and third acts, although
it is somewhat painful to hear. "Yes, We Have No
Bananas," sung with operatic paraphrase. But then
Kolb and Dill make you forget that. —M. A. C.
A large letter of foreign shape, plas
tered over with stamps totalling 200,000,-
000 marks, arrived on the editor's desk
last zveck.
Enclosed was the following story,
written within sound of rifle fire, of
the conditions in Germany under mob
rule. The signature was "IV. Ernest
Aitken, cx-'25."
Aitken, zvho zi'as registered in me
chanical engineering, was forced to
leave college and go to England because
of illness in his family. Erom there the
family zvent to Hamburg, where they
were caught in the mob uprisings.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this oppor

Besides the actually pitched battles,
there took place a guerilla warfare
through the whole of Hamburg, and
sudden bursts of shooting could be
heard at all times in different quar
ters of the city. Here, a policeman, his
ears torn off, was found hanging to a
lamp post, dead. There, a Communist
was huddled in a corner in the street,
slowly bleeding to death from gun
shot wounds. Every minute, ambu
lances passed whizzing by.
Guerillas Snipe at Police
Out of a darkened window a Mauser
spat viciously, and four of a earful of
police passing by, were added to the
ever-growing list of victims. Follow
ing this a proclamation was issued
that all windows not kept shut after
dark would be shot at.
Ten was the curfew hour and no one
might walk the streets after that time.
If caught doing so the penalty was a
fine and imprisonment, and if one was
challenged by a policeman and tried
to get away the police shot to kill. It
was not healthy to try—the police are
not half bad shots.
When finally things calmed down,
disheartened and disillusioned Com
munists were made prisoners by the
dozens. The hospitals were full of
wounded and dying while carts piled
high with rude, unpainted coffins kept
rolling by my house.
The result: Houses torn down, men
killed, hundreds wounded, money that
could have been used for bread wast
ed on ammunition.

A BIG REWARD
Kolb and Dill, Now Playing at the Curran
"A BIG REWARD" with Kolb anil Dill at the Curran
this week offers thrills as well as fun. This new play
is a three-act mystery comedy, being a satire on the
craze for mysterious plots, although its own mystery is
not explained until the very end. And it is so cleverly
written that you are laughing one minute and guessing
the next.
"A Big Reward" is a crook story. It has to do with
the theft of a valuable painting, its recovery and the
conviction of the thief, which brings a reward of
$200,000. William Kolb has the part of a man who plans
to raise money for his friend by sending him to prison
as the discovered thief, collecting the reward, and pre
senting it to him when he comes out. Max Dill is a
waiter in a hotel, and if you aren't laughing at Kolb's

clever lines, you laugh at his partner.
The cast is a good one. May Cloy as the Norwegian
hotel maid, and Rose Ludwig as the woman detective,
interpret their parts very well. Better still, they speak
with the most beautiful distinctness, all of which is
particularly soothing. Edward Woods as the desperate
young man, and Richard Allan as the rough-neck de
tective, measure up to the demand put upon them.
Even the orchestra is different. Under the direction
of Leo Flanders, it opens the play with the members
coming out individually from the stage. Each soloist
carries the instrument he plays—even the pianist brings
out a small piano. Miss Geneve Butler sings several
selections between the second and third acts, although
it is somewhat painful to hear. "Yes, We Have No
Bananas," sung with operatic paraphrase. But then
Kolb and Dill make you forget that. —M. A. C.
A large letter of foreign shape, plas
tered over with stamps totalling 200,000,-
000 marks, arrived on the editor's desk
last zveck.
Enclosed was the following story,
written within sound of rifle fire, of
the conditions in Germany under mob
rule. The signature was "IV. Ernest
Aitken, cx-'25."
Aitken, zvho zi'as registered in me
chanical engineering, was forced to
leave college and go to England because
of illness in his family. Erom there the
family zvent to Hamburg, where they
were caught in the mob uprisings.
The Daily Palo Alto takes this oppor
tunity to thank Mr. Aitken for zi'hat
we believe to be the most znvid picture
of conditions in Germany under riot
rule that has come before college read
ers.

On Sunday, October 28, the unrest,
long felt in Hamburg, began to be
noticed by a subtle undercurrent of
restlessness to be seen in most of the
lower classes. The working classes,
paid in the ever-falling mark, were
hardly able to buy their necessary
food, and prices had risen day by day.
Early Monday morning there was a
series of small riots, and a few gro
cery stores raided. Prepared as we
were for trouble, we were, however,
astonished at the suddenness and in
tensity of the outbreak which oc
curred in Bambeck, a suburb of Ham
burg.
Egged on by their needs, and helped
by Russian Soviet agents, the Com
jnunits broke into a large riot on.
Monday evening. They stormed and
took the district police station, and
stole all the weapons they could lay
hands on.
The next day the police watchmen
were found, their throats cut from ear
to ear.
Trench Dug Across Streets
In a night the town was transformed.
Trees were chopped down, barricades
thrown up, trenches dug across the
streets and the paving stones used to
build the parapets.
Then started the bitter struggle be
tween police and rioters, a struggle
which lasted a week.
The police rushed armored cars,
tanks, and machine guns to the scene
of the conflict. The Communists Were
helped by their women folk, who took
them food, etc., right into the trenches.
Only the lack of an able leader and
concentrated action among the Com
munists enabled the police to gain
an upper hand.
Bullets flew around the streets like
hail, and many a harmless passerby
fell, a victim to some stray projectile.
Especially vivid is the memory of a
young girl who left her home to cross
the street to the bakery; no sooner
had she set her foot outside the door,
when a stray bullet caught her in
the side of the and she dropped
without a sound, and lay in an ever
spreading pool of blood, before the
very eyes of her terror-stricken moth
er. who watched her from a window.
