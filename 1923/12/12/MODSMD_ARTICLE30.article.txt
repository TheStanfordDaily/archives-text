A large letter of foreign shape, plas
tered over with stamps totalling 200,000,-
000 marks, arrived on the editor's desk
last zveck.
Enclosed was the following story,
written within sound of rifle fire, of
the conditions in Germany under mob
rule. The signature was "IV. Ernest
Aitken, cx-'25."
Aitken, zvho zi'as registered in me

leave college and go to England because
of illness in his family. Erom there the
family zvent to Hamburg, where they
were caught in the mob uprisings.

On Sunday, October 28, the unrest,
long felt in Hamburg, began to be
noticed by a subtle undercurrent of
restlessness to be seen in most of the
lower classes. The working classes,
paid in the ever-falling mark, were
hardly able to buy their necessary
food, and prices had risen day by day.
