tion of three University projects says
Comptroller A. E. Rotli. Branner hall,
a new soda fountain in the old Union,
and permanent bleachers in the bas
ketball pavilion will be added to Uni
versity equipment.
Rooms in Branner will be ready for
occupancy at the beginning of the
quarter, although the club rooms, din

open until later.
The dormitory will hold 139 men,
now living in Encina hall. Their places
will be filled from the long waiting
list of men living in Palo Alto.
Accommodations for all off-campu^

Roth.
The Branner rooms are similar to
those of Toyon, providing a suite com
posed of bedroom and study, to be
shared by two students. Room rent
will be the same as for the other hall.
New Soda Fountain Next Quarter
Other innovations which will be
completed by the University for next
quarter are the soda fountain and the

has, been ordered and is already on

A conference with architects will
decide the question of whether the

ately, or not until after the basketball
