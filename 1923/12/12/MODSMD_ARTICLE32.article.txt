The senior hockey team may meet
a live Chinese puzzle when it plays j
the sophomores for the interclass
hockey championship next Friday.
Four years of teamwork with hardly j
a change in the line-up has made the:
1924 squad a machine which has j
pretty regularly waltzed over oppon

ents with a number of goals to spare.
But the '26 team, in three unofficial
practice games with the seniors last
week, tied one match, were defeated
once, and won the third scrimmage.
The seniors are undoubted favorites
by a wide margin, on account of their
superiority in outside matches. They

defeated Mills College, 4-1, and Cali
fornia, 6-1, whereas the sophomores
were defeated in both of these con
tests.
These games happened a month ago.
Last week the sophomores unexpected
ly trimmed the junior team, 5-2, there
by earning the chance to fight for
the interclass title.

WASHINGTON, D. Câ€”The White
House has been declared unsafe. Con
ditions there are such as to require
that immediate remedial measures be

taken to prevent a possible calamity.
These conditions have been called to
the attention of the President and his
authority for the inclusion of $400,000
in the budget has been requested.

The Jordan athletic field of
Indiana university, Bloomington, Ind.,
named for Dr. David Starr Jordan, at
one time president of Indiana, was
used for the last time this fall for
the football game with Purdue uni
versity; and that Indiana teams won
75 out of 95 games played on the field
in the twenty-seven years since its
dedication?


SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM, FAVORITE TO WIN
INTERCLASS CHAMPIONSHIP
