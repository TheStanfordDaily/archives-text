## THE
						CLIMAX Guy Bates Post, Now Playing at the Columbia 
### 
Guy Bates Post opened an engagement
for two weeks, Monday night at the
Columbia, playing in E. J. Locke's strong
play, THE CLIMAX.
In the character of the temperamental
music master, Luigi, with all his hopes
centered on making a prima donna of
Adelina, his favorite pupil, Mr. Post gives

one of his finest portrayals. The finesse of his acting
is perfect, being rather of an indescribable artistry.
Luigi's son, Pietro, and Raymond, a young medical
student, are in love with Adelina. Raymond, however,
does not believe that her voice will ever amount to any
thing, and wants her to give up singing and a career
to become his wife. After she has had an operation on
her throat, she finally falls under his mental suggestion,
believing that she has lost her voice.
Myra Lee plays the part of Adelina, J. Parke Jones,
Pietro, and Gerald Pring, Raymond. Miss Lee has a
sweet though not a large voice. However, if she lacks
the voice of a prima donna, she has the ability to
interpret her part most charmingly. Prince's acting is
well studied, and Mones makes an ideal Pietro, des
perately in love with Adelina.
