# HANDCUFFED
## Belle Bennett, Now Playing at the Alcazar 
### 
How would you like to be handcuffed
to a man as a pledge that he will not
escape while the sheriff is away? That is
what Belle Bennett does in the star
role of "Handcuffed," an interesting and
a psychological melodrama by Owen
Davis, now playing at the Alcazar.
The scenes of this play are laid near
the Mexican border where the characters

have had very little contact with the outside world. It
is a drab tale, dealing with a stranger and with a
sordid situation.
When the story opens, Kate Larkin, the legal ward
of a brutal guardian, knows that her stepfather has
murdered her mother, although he insists that she had
merely struck her head in falling. Brace, the stepfather,
wants his wife out of his way so that he can have Kate.
Although she loves the sheriff, Lance Henderson, she
sends him away because she cannot understand why
he has officially killed men. She gives food to a fleeing
stranger, a doctor, who is wanted for manslaughter by
the sheriff.
Action moves swiftly. Ridley, the doctor, is found,
brought back, and while he sees what he can dj for the
mother, Kate is handcuffed to him that he may not
escape. But he persuades her to go with him in the
world, and both slip out of the window. It is only when
he kills the blacksmith that she realizes what kind of
man he is, and forces him to return with her to the
sheriff. Finally, after she, herself, kills Brace to save
Lance, she slips one bracely of a pair of handcuffs
over her wrist, and attaches the other to Lance's.
