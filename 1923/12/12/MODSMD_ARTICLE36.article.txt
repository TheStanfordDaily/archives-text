An exclusive alleged interview with the Prince of IValcs
on the occasion of his recent alleged visit to Stanford.
Scooped by C. N. H.
The Prince of Wales!
At last *1 was to interview "the most popular man in the
world," the royal lad who had been feted all over the globe,
and who was now honoring Stanford University with an
especial visit. And I was to get his opinions of our institu
tion.
I learned that he was camping out with his retinue some
where in the Arboretum. This was not surprising to me,
for the Prince is noted for his love of the great outdoors;
and he shuns the conventions of the world to become
better acquainted with his fellow men. In fact, I later
learned that he was found one day near Roble mending a
hose foi; a gardener when he should have been speaking in
the Assembly hall.

When I arrived at the camp, the Prince was just return
ing from a horseback ride in the hills. He is to ride in a
derby at Dublin soon, and the mount he was on now must
have heard about it. and have been Irish, for he suddenly
turned an admirable somersault. The Prince described a
beautiful figure-eight in the air and landed squarely at my
feet, none the worse, apparently, for his graceful dismount
ing. The Prince is a superb horseman.
Prince Receives Informally
"Won't you sit down?" he asked, still lying on the ground
the way he had dismounted. I sat down opposite him,
Indian fashion, to be truly American in contrast to the
English of his posture. He offered me a cigarette, then pro
duced his Dunhill and lit it with elaborate care, evidently
waiting for me to shoot my questions at him. So I opened
fire:
"What do you —ah—think of our University?" I inquired
guardedly.
"Oh, charming—charming!" the Prince hastened to reply
graciously. "Marvelous game preserve. Why, only this
morning I went out to bag some quail, and one of the
deuced things came and perched right on the muzzle of
my fowling-piece. I was delighted to find your birds so
accommodating." (I quickly wrote the incident down in
my notebook. What a story!)
"Rut, of course, you know that no hunting is ever
allowed here," I ventured timidly.
Wild Life at Stanford Intriguing
"Oh, mercy, I didn't intend to shoot anything. We were
merely taking some pictures to illustrate my new book,
'Big Game Hunting in Western America'." He laughed
ingenuously. I was beginning to like this slender, fair-eyed
youth, who was doing more for Great Britain than H. G.
Wells. His candor was refreshing.
"But; our buildings," I pressed, "the atmosphere here, the
democratic spirit we have, the beauty of the campus—
what do you think of these things?" Noiv I was getting into
my story.
The Prince flipped a burr from the sleeve of his baggy
riding jacket, before replying. The sartorial perfection of
the man! Small wonder that America had taken up his
styles so enthusiastically. I made a note of this. How
wonderful that fat American business men would soon look
as well as the Prince, in their English-cut clothes.
But he was speaking. "Ah, yes; the buildings arc gor
geous—so like the Bastile, with its great, massive stones.
And your—cr —Jolly-Ups, I believe it is—where the men
and women have a really cheerio time once a semester!
Your campus ... it is—is a knockout, I should say."
(knockout! I hurriedly put this down. Who said the Prince
did not use red-blooded, virile language, the same as any
ordinary man?)

"Well, I must toddle along," I said, putting him at his
ease with my tactful use of the verb. 1 almost expected
him to offer to sharpen my pencil; but we had been fra
ternizing so famously anyway, that I was not disappointed
when he did not suggest it.
We bade good-bye to each other, and I got up and
walked briskly away, impatient to get at my typewriter
to record my remarkable interview. I looked back for a
final glimpse of the camp; and saw four servants bearing
the Prince to his tent on a stretcher. How fortunate he
was to enjoy such comfort and attention!
