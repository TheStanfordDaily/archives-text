# HARTRANFT AND BRIDE RESIDE IN PALO ALTO
## 
### 
"Tiny" Hartranft, Stanford weight
man,* and prospective member of the
Cardinal 1924 track team, arrived on
the campus yesterday from Southern
California with his bride, formerly
Miss Ruth Crawford of Anaheim. The
Hartranfts will live in Palo Alto at
176 Cowper street.
Following their marriage at Fuller
ton last Wednesday, the newly-mar
ried couple spent a short honeymoon
in the South.
In all probability, Hartranft will
register for the Winter quarter and
will be added to "Dink" Templeton's
track squad of next year.
