# New Daily Staff Members Prepare For Celebration
## 
### 
New members of the Daily Palo Alto
staff will give a banquet to the old
members tonight at the Delta Gamma'
I
sorority house. After keeping their j
collective noses to the grindstone for;
the entire quarter, the staff must cele
brate.
About forty journalists will sit
around the table, dancing between
courses and demanding entertainment
from the new people on the staff.
Incidentally, the new members have
planned something of an innovation
for amusement. They will present a
little skit culminating in the appear
ance of a "Daily," novel and appropri-,
ate in several ways.
The banquet is a quarterly affair, ar
ranged by the new members of the
staff. In the past, it has been given the
night before the final edition of the
quarter. Owing to the difficulty of get
ting out a paper "the morning after,",
the staff has postponed their celebra
tion one day.
