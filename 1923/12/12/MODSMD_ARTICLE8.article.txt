# FIRST SOPHOMORE BASKETBALL FIVE WINS FROM JUNIORS
## 
### 
The sophomores continued their
winning streak last night when they
clowned the junior five by an 8 to 5
score. The senior seconds had little
difficulty in winning from the sopho
more seconds. The score of this game
was 20 to 3.
The sophomores got going with a
rush, and Faine scored the first goal
soon after the game started. Frazier
followed with another and then Faine
got his second counter from under the
basket. Frazier added one more to the
total with a free try.
Hobro got the only junior score in
the first half. His shot was from tbc
middle of the floor. The half ended
with the sophomores on the long end
of a 7-2 score.
The juniors got going a little better
in the final half and managed to hold
the sophs to one foul goal, which was
made by Mangin. Hobro scored an
other long shot, and Dole made the
odd point from the foul line.
Hobro was the bright light for the
losers. His floor work was good and
he was the only junior who could lo
cate the hoop. The sophomore play
was featured by the passing of Fra
zier and Faine, forwards. Mangin
played a good defensive game at run
ning guard.
The sophomore seconds held the
seniors for a few minutes, but after
that the fourth year men scored at
will. The half ended 11-3, and the
sophs were unable to locate the hoop
in the second half.
