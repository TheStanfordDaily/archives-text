# YEARLING COURT MEN FIGHT FOR POSITIONS
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt has an aggrega
tion of twenty freshmen hoopsters hard
at work preparing for the coming sched
ule. All of the men are well drilled in
the fundamentals of basketball, and Hunt
is confident of developing a winning team.
Not a single individual star is on the
found squad, but all of the men are so
evenly matched that Coach Hunt is at a
loss to select a first five. In fact, he has
decided to delay the matter a while longer
by having two first teams, each of which
will have a regular schedule with neigh
boring high school teams.
If schedules can be arranged, one team
will play every Wednesday night and the
other team will see action on Saturday
nights. This plan will give Hunt an op
portunity to develop ten men instead of
five, and by the time of the California
series he will have selected a first five
from the two teams. The men not se
lected for the first five will be more avail
able as substitutes because of the expe
rience gained playing outside games dur
ing the season.
The California freshmen will have a
strong team this year. A majority of the
stars on the Piedmont, Fremont, and Oak
land high schools last year have regis
tered at the Berkeley university, and they
will form the nucleus of the Gold and
Blue five. >
Sliipkey, Holman, and Clarke are the
three best bets for running guard. All of
these men are fast and handle die ball
well. Holman seems to have the edge, but
little can be said as to the most likely
candidates this early in the season. At
standing guard Hunt has four dependable
players, Newhousc, Haverside, Rowles (
and matin.
Menzies, Jayred, and Newkirk will
fight it out for center. The most prom
ising forwards are Southworth, Blazier,
Price, George, Parsons, and Riese. As
individual players all of the forwards are
of about the same merit, and the men
who are chosen as regulars will be those
who fit into the cogs of the machine best.
If two teams are carried through the
early part of the season Hunt will drill a
squad of about twenty-five. Hoffman,
who hails from Petaluma, will register
for the first time this quarter and is ex
pected to give the men already out a
hard fight for their places. Anderson and
David, two hoopsters from southern Cal
ifornia, will report for practice this week.
