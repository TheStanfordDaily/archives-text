# CARD FIVE TO PLAY C. OF P. SATURDAY
## Stanford Quintet Shows Signs of Strength In Preliminary Game Against Ellery Arms Five 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford's 1924 basketball team will begin one of the most doubtful hoop
seasons of many years against the College of the Pacific in the Pavilion next
Saturday night. The avrsity has already displayed signs of strength against the San
Jose Y. M. C. A. and the Ellery Arms quintets in unscheduled games. Stanford
nosed out the Y. M C. A. by a score of 21 to 13 ,and defeated the Ellery Arms
team 26 to 13.
The Y. M. C. A-. game was a ragged exhibition, and ran true to the usual
first-game-of-the-season style, but it showed that the Cards had something of the
fundamentals necessary for a good quintet. The San Jose aggregation had been

practicing several weeks before the Car
dinals had donned the basketball regalia.
Long shot's featured the contest. Nei
ther team seemed to be able to penetrate
the other's defense, and San Jose
especially had difficulty in nosing around
the bulky Oliva at standing guard. Oliva
was easily the outstanding player of the
Stanford team. "Nip" McHose and
Ernie Nevers were responsible for most
of the baskets tossed. Nevers proved to
be living up to his flashing form which
he showed while a freshman at the Uni
versity, and McHose, although having
trouble in getting close under the basket
managed to keep the rival guards on the
hop.
Stanford was more flashy in the Ellery
Arms game. The Arms team, confident
because of two victories over the Califor
nia varsity, expected to trim the Cards,
and in the first few minutes of the play
it looked to be a plausible expectation.
Stanford began to forge ahead, however,
in the second quarter, and the third quar
ter was a walk away for the Red Shirts.
Substitutions were made freely, and
more than one of the reserves played
well enough to warrant careful watch
ing in the future.
Stanford's chief setback is still a run
ning guard. Mc√üurney, who started at
this position against the Arms quintet
played somewhat of a ragged game. His
passing was poor, and he was caught re
peatedly running with the ball. These
latter of Censes, however, arc minor this
early in the season and with practice they
would be easily eradicated.
Dave Oliva again proved to be the
flash of the game. He broke up the op
ponents passing offensive with case,
blocked the dribbling, and directed the
passing on the Stanford team like a
veteran general.
"Nip" got in some close shooting, and
Ernie played a steady offensive game.
All the worry about a good center got'
a dousing of cold water. Steele, who
managed the pivot position for the Cards
played circles around his opponent, and
was vastly superior to any of the sub
stitutes which replaced him.
Of the reserves, Ted Steffan and Tom
Alexander showed marked possibilities.
Roth are small men, but fast and squirmy.
Three preliminary games are scheduled
before Stanford meets U. S. C. in the
first conference games. After the game
with the College of the Pacific Saturday
contests with the Olympic Club and Santa
Clara will be played. This gives the Card?
a good preliminary season, and allows
Andy Kerr to find out just where the team
stands. The game with the Stanford
Alumni has been indefinitely postponed.
Fouls will play a less important part
in the scoring due to the new ruling which
forces every man to shoot his own fouls.
Those who can recall the U. S. C. series
of last season will remember the rough
and tumble scramble which
referee's whistle warm from blowing so
many fouls. In this series practically
half of the score was made from free
goals. In the California series, also, fouls
mounted up the final total, and in two
of the contests they proved to be deciding
factors. Whether the new ruling will
handicap the Stanford quintet is hard to
say. In "Nip" McHose Stanford had one
of the best free-goal tossers on the coast,
and it was always a good bet to say that
"Nip" could account for one out of every
two fouls with a point for Stanford.
California made quite a slash in a ser
ies of games played in the South during
the Christmas vacations. Johnny Talt,
the flashy little Bear forward accounted
for most of the Bruin scores. He forms
practically the entire California offensive,
and it will take a good guard to keep Talt
away from scoring distance.
With Dave Oliva and Gurdon Steele
showing up so well in the preliminary
games, it seems that the Cards should be
able to turn out a good five-man quintet.
But usually it takes more than five good
men to bolster up a team. Reserves who
are to be depended upon are lacking on
the Stanford team. The situation looks
to be on a par with last year, when five
men played throughout four quarters be
cause of weak substitutes.
California beat Stanford last year be
cause the Bears had a wealth of substi
tutes which were almost' if not as good
as the first string players. Stanford
had five good men, and California had
ten, and the strength which the Bear
substitutes were able to furnish in the
last few minutes -of play was often
enough to swing the score in favor of
California.
