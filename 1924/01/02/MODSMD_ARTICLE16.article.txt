# Resolutions
## 
### 
Bill Brogan arrived back on the campus New Year's Eve after
an evening spent in the city, a little the worse for wear but chuck full
of new ideas that blossomed forth into resolutions yesterday morning.
Bill wants to know if we don't think that the campus would be a
better place to hang around if his resolutions were written into the diary
of every member of the five hundred and posted in a conspicuous place
in every room in Encina, Branner, Toyon, Sequoia, the Union, and
the fraternity houses.
We do!
Here are a few of Bill's most worthy resolutions:
1. To allot at least a few minutes each day to study. 2. To give
my morris chair a rest, get out for some activity and stay out. 3. To
greet everybody 1 meet on the campus with a cheery hello. 4. To go
to every athletic contest and root. 5. To quit knocking and do a little
boosting instead. 6. To toss that box of poker chips into the waste basket
and mislay every deck of cards 1 own. 7. To queen a few times —not
too often —possibly once or twice a week, preferably Friday or Saturday
night. 8. To get acquainted with all my professors—they're a pretty
good bunch as a whole;
Of course, Bill points out that all these do not apply to everybody
and there are a few exceptional individuals to which none of them
apply. But, on the whole, he thinks that if everyone on the campus
lives up to the ones that concern him or her, 1924 will be a mighty
good year on the Farm.
And the Daily Palo Alto agrees.
