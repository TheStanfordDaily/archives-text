# Another Quarter
## 
### 
Now that the "glad to see you—what kind of a vacation did you
have" period is over and everyone who is fortunate enough to be able
to register has done so, the Winter Quarter is about to begin in earnest.
Advance rei>orts from the Registrar's office indicate that the casual
ties among the freshmen last quarter were comparatively low. Those
who survived their first quarter and remained in the university by a
small margin have a good chance to pull up this quarter. Football took
a good bit of time from both players and spectators last quarter and
with that sport out of the way and plenty of rainy days coming, there is
a good chance for high marks.
The student who wears a smile instead of a frown along towards
final examination week is the one who does the assigned work each
day and week and doesn't let things slide.
