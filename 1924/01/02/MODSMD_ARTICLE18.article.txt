# Football Critics Harp
## 
### 
Many footb.ill critics take delight in pointing out the gridiron contests
held throughout the country yesterday on the first of the year as additional

proof of the menace of commercialized sport to American colleges. They ,
might make effective use of the happy anticipation of the Washingtonians
to net some $50,000 from their game with the Navy at Pasadena yesterday.
But it might be replied in favor of the pigskin sport that such criti
cism is better directed at those post-season games which smack of young
America's money making proclivities rather than at the sport itself.
College presidents in the past have refused to allow a team to travel j
about the country simply to kick and carry about an inflated oval. Dr.
Stewart Paton, a lecturer on neuro-biology at Princeton, has gained
national publicity through his statement that football has become a menace
to our colleges, and unless checked must soon be abolished.
However, those engaged in this form of athletics constitute so small
a percentage of the student body that the university scholarship on the
whole is not affected. At Stanford especially, students participate in other
various forms of athletics and are not merely a cheering section for the
gridiron stars. Moreover, football seems to give a solid unity to the
members of a university and to weave a spirit of loyalty and enthusiasm
among thousands. The Big Game is a magnetic lodestone which draws
alumni to their alma mater, bringing them into contact again with the
undergraduates.
Football has many faults but it also has many desirable qualities,
and comment unfavorable to the sport such as produced by yesterday's
gala occasions can be passed by without dire effects.
