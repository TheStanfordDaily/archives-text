People often make fun of the polished
manners and the courtly behavior of their
forefathers of the days of Queen Eliza
beth. They laugh at the tale of how Sir
Walter spoiled his costly cloak. They
smile at the custom of bending low over
the hand of one's lady or backing away
from the presence of a superior. It's all
out of date now. New customs have quite
naturally taken their places. Civilization
changes, and with it changes the mode of
life and the mannerisms of the people.
Still, with all the advancement and the
change we have lost something, something
tangible, something which is now essen
tially lacking in our prevent civilization.
That something is the courtesy of olden
days. From "The Colums" of University
