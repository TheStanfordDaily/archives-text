# CHAPPIE MIDSUMMER NUMBER WILL MAKE APPEARANCE FRIDAY
## 
### 
NOW THAT we are right in the heart
of a cold, cold, California winter, Chap
pie comes forward with a breezy mid
summer issue, which makes its first ap
pearance on the campus Friday. Summer
follows winter, and midsummer comes
after spring, but the Old Boy doesn't fol
low any one. He is even seven months
ahead of Old Man Weather.
In the midsummer issue, there is no
langur that usually accompanies the warm
days, but a lot of hot stuff. In fact the
Old Hoy swings the hammer with a great
deal of vivacity.
Any woman who thinks she knows why
there is a leap year is mistaken. Chappie
comes forth with a new idea for the rea
son that every fourth year can be divided
into quarters.
Just to show that Chappie likes one
year as well as another the cover of the
midsummer number will be used annually.
The Old Boy has something for prac
tical people this month. There is a page
of art work that illustrates the angles of
everyday life.
Next month the Old Boy will play host
and be a guest at the same time. The
Columbia Jester will travel across the
continent to combine forces with Chappie,
and the Old Boy will take the train back
to little old New York. So, with Amer
ican college wit, East will have a chance
to meet West.
The exact time for the party isn't set
yet, but the humorists are working hard
so that the big affair will be ready for
about February 10.
