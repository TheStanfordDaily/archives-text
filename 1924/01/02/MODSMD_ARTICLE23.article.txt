# IT'S LEAP YEAR!
## 
### 
It's leap year! Nineteen twenty-four is
upon us and for the first time in four
years the women have come into their
own!
'Tis true they have done so every four
years for centuries. In fact, a law as
enacted in Scotland in 1288 declaring that,
"it is statut and ordaint that during the
rein of hir blissit majeste, for ilk yere
knowne as lepe yere, ilk mayden ladye of
bothe higlie and lowe estait liae liberte to
bespeke ye man she likes." But those
were the days when women were con
sidered retiring and were dependent on
the men. One wonders if many gained
courage enough to take advantage of this
right!
A word of warning to those young men,
especially the campus sheiks, who know
themselves to be admired by the fairer
sex—they may expect an exceptionally
great rush; and to those young ladies
who have long possessed a secret sorrow
or a crush — well, now this is their
chance! ! !
