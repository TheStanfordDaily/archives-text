1 am a poseur. It is my sole purpose
to appear that which I am not. My
best pose is that of an intellectual. I
assume the dignity and the air of one
who lives upon a higher mental plane
than my fellow man. Why shouldn't I?
My background is not the same as
theirs. They are pure American, with
all the crudenesß and crassness of a
new people; while my background is
peculiarly European.
My ancestors, that is my almost im
mediate ancestors, were born in
France and England, where culture
and art and all the nicer refinements
are the very epitome of life. (I like
that word "epitome," it is so intellec
tual.)
If course I, myself, was born in Win
tersett, lowa, as were my father and
mother; but my background, you see,
is foreign.
My friends tell me that my ideals
and expressions are distinctly Euro
pean. I often quote Anatole France
or Nietzsche. I have never read them,
but merely to mention their names im

presses my friends with the fact that
I am an intellectual.
When in a social gathering, 1 give
my acquaintances the impression that
I am with them but not of them. As
they discuss matters, in their crude
uninteresting manner, I sit apart with
a smile of condescension on my face..
Occasionally I interrupt with an ex
. clamation' in French. «
When I go to the opera (I always
go to operas, for they are so intellec
tual, although I really do not appre
ciate a note of music) I sit there with
a rapt expression on my face; try to
| make my very soul appear in my eyes. j
. If anybody makes even a slight noise!
I turn on him and glare.

j adopt, but an intellectual is my favo

;of overcoming the disadvantage of
having been born in crude America.
