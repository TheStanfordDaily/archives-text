personal experiences while traveling with i
her husband in India, Australia, and j
Polynesia, and the islands of the South I
Seas. In India she spent two years, dur-1
ing which she journeyed about 50,0001
miles, studying especially the life of the j
women.
In the Bismark Archipelago Mrs. Bain-1

only white woman to witness the whole j
of the Duk Duk ceremony, having been
present at the initiation of her husband. (
In a letter to Professor Robinson, j
chairman of the Committee on Public |
Exercises, Dr. David Starr Jordan, who !
knew her husband in London, before his j
death, describes Mrs. Bainbridge as a!
woman of attractive manners and liberal,
views, and recommends her as a speaker. ;
Although her husband was English, Mrs. i
Bainbridge was originally from Ohio, and j
after her husband's death she returned to |
America. Her son expects to enter Stan- j
ford next year.
