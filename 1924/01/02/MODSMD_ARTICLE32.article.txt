# ARE STANFORD MEN MORE VAIN THAN THE WOMEN?
## 
### 
Vanity of vanities ! All is vanity ! So
most Stanford men think about the much
maligned Stanford women. The basic and
fundamental reason for thy women's
exaggerated state of their own importance
(that's one definition for vanity or con
ceit.—n. b., see dictionary—if you are in
terested enough), according to the men,
is because they are out-numbered in such
proportions. If they were more evenly
matched (in number) there would be
less opportunity for conceit because they
would appreciate small favors. Now
they don't.
The freshmen are presumably more hu
man than the uppcrclassmen because they
haven't been here long enough to realize
how good they are. When they attain the
dignity of a senior, all hope is lost, be
cause women have to he pretty good to
get into Stanford in the*first place, and
the longer they stay, the more they real
ize it. Women by natural construction, are
more vain than men, and the Stanford
campus offers no possibilities for over
coming this vice, although under favor
able circumstances it might be possible.
So say most of the men. Some, however,
have other convictions on the subject, and
even go so far as to say that if the men
weren't more conceited than the women
they wouldn't keep on making such a fuss
about how helpless the women are.

This brings up to the distinction be
tween vanity and conceit. There 4ems to
be some difference in the minds of the
crowd although it is difficult to determine
it from such an authority as Webster. It
is vain for a woman to be well-dressed—
to powder her nose—and to do countless
other things, but not necessarily conceited.
Conceit seems to pertain more to brain
capacity or natural ability (and it is sur
prising the number of men who seem to
admit they are conceited—but never vain,
while the women admit they may be a bit
vain but they are NOT conceited). You
have to "hand yourself something" if you
expect other people to do likewise say
some of the male contingent, but that is
not considered conceit. That is plain, or
dinary common sense.
The women think the men are more
conceited (what could be more logical?).
In the first place, the Stanford man is
conceited because he is a Stanford man.
( Somebody even suggested that the whole
student body was conceited because they
were the student body.) When he re
turns to his old haunts he keeps his hands
in his pockets not to jingle any stray
coins or keps but to display his Stanford
belt. This does not indicate that lie is
ashamed of it. In the second place, wom
en contend that men are usually con
ceited because they are pampered so much,
and that they arc more so here because
they have such freedom and independence.

This brings up to the distinction be
tween vanity and conceit. There 4ems to
be some difference in the minds of the
crowd although it is difficult to determine
it from such an authority as Webster. It
is vain for a woman to be well-dressed—
to powder her nose—and to do countless
other things, but not necessarily conceited.
Conceit seems to pertain more to brain
capacity or natural ability (and it is sur
prising the number of men who seem to
admit they are conceited—but never vain,
while the women admit they may be a bit
vain but they are NOT conceited). You
have to "hand yourself something" if you
expect other people to do likewise say
some of the male contingent, but that is
not considered conceit. That is plain, or
dinary common sense.
The women think the men are more
conceited (what could be more logical?).
In the first place, the Stanford man is
conceited because he is a Stanford man.
( Somebody even suggested that the whole
student body was conceited because they
were the student body.) When he re
turns to his old haunts he keeps his hands
in his pockets not to jingle any stray
coins or keps but to display his Stanford
belt. This does not indicate that lie is
ashamed of it. In the second place, wom
en contend that men are usually con
ceited because they are pampered so much,
and that they arc more so here because
they have such freedom and independence.
Vanity of vanities ! All is vanity ! So
most Stanford men think about the much
maligned Stanford women. The basic and
fundamental reason for thy women's
exaggerated state of their own importance
(that's one definition for vanity or con
ceit.—n. b., see dictionary—if you are in
terested enough), according to the men,
is because they are out-numbered in such
proportions. If they were more evenly
matched (in number) there would be
less opportunity for conceit because they
would appreciate small favors. Now
they don't.
The freshmen are presumably more hu
man than the uppcrclassmen because they
haven't been here long enough to realize
how good they are. When they attain the
dignity of a senior, all hope is lost, be
cause women have to he pretty good to
get into Stanford in the*first place, and
the longer they stay, the more they real
ize it. Women by natural construction, are
more vain than men, and the Stanford
campus offers no possibilities for over
coming this vice, although under favor
able circumstances it might be possible.
So say most of the men. Some, however,
have other convictions on the subject, and
even go so far as to say that if the men
weren't more conceited than the women
they wouldn't keep on making such a fuss
about how helpless the women are.
