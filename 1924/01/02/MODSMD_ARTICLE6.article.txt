# TRACK MEN WILL START WORK WITH "DINK" TEMPLETON
## Varsity Should Be Strong in Weights; Greatest Weakness Found in Jumps 
### 
With the start of the new year, "Dink" I
Templeton will commence rounding his
track men in shape for the coming meets.
The most pleasing prospect in sight is the
return of "Tiny" Hartranft, brilliant star
of two years ago. Tiny is one of the best
discus and shot men in the country, and in
addition is a fast sprinter.
"Tiny's" return should mean at least ten I
points to Templeton in the California
meet. These ten points may prove the
deciding factor, as the teams have ap
peared evenly matched this year.
High calibre track athletes are found
in all events, with the possible exception
of the three jumps. There is abundant
material in these and with three months'
training "Dink" may be able to develop
first place winners.
Six men of better than the average j
ability are practicing in the sprints. Lan j
Campbell and Marshall Hale are the two j
outstanding stars. Campbell won the 220-
yard .dash and placed second in the cen- j
tury in the California meet last year, and
also placed fifth in the 220 at the N. C.
A. A. meet at Chicago. Hale ran the 100-
yard dash in :10 1-5 several times last
quarter. Hartranft, Miller, Gaspar, and
Storey are the other sprinters on whom
Templeton pins his hopes. Miller and
Gaspar are from the 1926 frosh team, and
Storey is a transfer.
Judah, track captain, with Shermund,
Storey, Mixon, and Coverley will repre
sent the Cardinal in the 440. Judah is a
powerful 440 men and can be counted
upon for points in all of the meets.
One of the largest galaxies of half mile i
stars ever in college at one time will be
seen in the half mile. Smith, Richardson,
Dole, Swavne, Mcintosh, Daly, and Pas
torius will contend for honors. With
competition so great this race may be run i
in less than 1:58.
In the distances Kerr, Charles, Hayes, j
Murphy, Clifford, Cypher, and Thayer!
look like the best. Kerr and Charles ap- j
pear to be the best in the mile, while j
Hayes looks strongest in the two mile.
With Leistner and Boles Stanford will j
be strong in the hurdles. These men j
should place first and second in every \
meet. Wells, a transfer, should also show j
up well.
Hartranft will be the best bet in the
shot and discus. Scotcliy Campbell. Wan
kowski, Richards, and Arthur can also be
counted upon. Arthur was not out last
quarter, but he is a comer in the discus.
Farish is the most prominent of the i
javelin throwers.
Macßae, Bragg, and Wells are the j
broad junipers. All three of them should
be doing 22 feet before many weeks. Den
nis and Schoefield, veterans of last year,
will perforin in the pole vault. With
Norris and Wright gone this year the
oole vaulters of California and Stanford
will not have to jump so near 13 feet to
place as they did last year. While there
are several good freshman high jumpers
out, the varsity will be lacking a good
man fotj this event, from present indi
cation.

Hayes looks strongest in the two mile.
With Leistner and Boles Stanford will j
be strong in the hurdles. These men j
should place first and second in every \
meet. Wells, a transfer, should also show j
up well.
Hartranft will be the best bet in the
shot and discus. Scotcliy Campbell. Wan
kowski, Richards, and Arthur can also be
counted upon. Arthur was not out last
quarter, but he is a comer in the discus.
Farish is the most prominent of the i
javelin throwers.
Macßae, Bragg, and Wells are the j
broad junipers. All three of them should
be doing 22 feet before many weeks. Den
nis and Schoefield, veterans of last year,
will perforin in the pole vault. With
Norris and Wright gone this year the
oole vaulters of California and Stanford
will not have to jump so near 13 feet to
place as they did last year. While there
are several good freshman high jumpers
out, the varsity will be lacking a good
man fotj this event, from present indi
cation.
With the start of the new year, "Dink" I
Templeton will commence rounding his
track men in shape for the coming meets.
The most pleasing prospect in sight is the
return of "Tiny" Hartranft, brilliant star
of two years ago. Tiny is one of the best
discus and shot men in the country, and in
addition is a fast sprinter.
"Tiny's" return should mean at least ten I
points to Templeton in the California
meet. These ten points may prove the
deciding factor, as the teams have ap
peared evenly matched this year.
High calibre track athletes are found
in all events, with the possible exception
of the three jumps. There is abundant
material in these and with three months'
training "Dink" may be able to develop
first place winners.
Six men of better than the average j
ability are practicing in the sprints. Lan j
Campbell and Marshall Hale are the two j
outstanding stars. Campbell won the 220-
yard .dash and placed second in the cen- j
tury in the California meet last year, and
also placed fifth in the 220 at the N. C.
A. A. meet at Chicago. Hale ran the 100-
yard dash in :10 1-5 several times last
quarter. Hartranft, Miller, Gaspar, and
Storey are the other sprinters on whom
Templeton pins his hopes. Miller and
Gaspar are from the 1926 frosh team, and
Storey is a transfer.
Judah, track captain, with Shermund,
Storey, Mixon, and Coverley will repre
sent the Cardinal in the 440. Judah is a
powerful 440 men and can be counted
upon for points in all of the meets.
One of the largest galaxies of half mile i
stars ever in college at one time will be
seen in the half mile. Smith, Richardson,
Dole, Swavne, Mcintosh, Daly, and Pas
torius will contend for honors. With
competition so great this race may be run i
in less than 1:58.
In the distances Kerr, Charles, Hayes, j
Murphy, Clifford, Cypher, and Thayer!
look like the best. Kerr and Charles ap- j
pear to be the best in the mile, while j
Hayes looks strongest in the two mile.
