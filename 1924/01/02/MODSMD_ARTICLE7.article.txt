# BRANNER HALL, NEW MEN'S DORMITORY, IS OPEN FOR OCCUPATION
## 
### 
Branner hall, the new men's dormitory
which opened today, is being filled by stu
dents who sent applications in the fall
quarter, and by those whose applications
are first in the long list of those applying
for rooms. There will be no discrimina
tion in the selection at applicants, except
that n<s freshmen will occupy the hall.
There are 133 rooms in the building, and
of these rooms, all arc in finished condi
tion, except those in the basement. P. I.
Spencer is the head custodian of the dor
mitory.
Branner hall, though not wholly fin
ished, is in a better condition than Tovon
hall was at the time of its opening. The
room numbers have not been painted on
the doors yet. This has causcd men to
wander about the seeming maze of halls
with a room chart in hand as an aid to
their hazy memories of room locations.
Dean O. L. Waller, acting president
at Washington State College, has an
nounced that plans have been made
for a permanent skating rink, which
can be flooded whenever desired. Agi
tation for a winter sports carnival has
been started on the campus and the
plans include skiing, coasting, skating,
toboganning, and other events.
