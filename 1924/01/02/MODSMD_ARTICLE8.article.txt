# Ernie Nevers Placed on Walter Camp's Third All-American Grid Team
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers, Stanford fullback, and
"Stew" Beam, California tackle, who
were placed on Walter Camp's third 1923
All-American eleven were the only Pa
cific Coast gridders to receive places
among the former Yale coach's selections.
Three teams were picked as usual by
Camp comprising thirty-three men. Of
this number, only eight were from col
leges and universities not in the East,
Beam and Nevers, as third string men,
being the only two from the Far West.
Camp's first mythical eleven as it would
trot on the field would be: Bomar (Van
derbilt) and Hazel (Rutgers), ends; Mil
stead (Yale) and Sundstrom (Cornell),
tackles; Hubbard, (Harvard) and Be
denk (Penn State), guards; Blott (Mich
igan), center; Pfann (Cornell), quarter
back; Grange (Illinois), and Martineau
(Minnesota), halfbacks; and Mallary
(Yale), fullback.
Relative to Camp's selection, Franklin
(Brick) Morse, former All-American
halfback from Princeton, 1893, wrote that
it "had been dubbed 'the annual disap
pointment'." Explaining this, he says,
"Every institution that makes any kind of
a showing during the year expects at least
one of its players to be included. . . but
it is obvious that there are to be some
heartaches in view of the fact that there
are 61<S recognized universities and col
lege in the United States."
On the other hand, in refutation of the
view that an All-American should liter
ally be an All-American, Morse writes
that those holding this view lose sight of
the fact that the players are selected on
the basis of "getting together the best
players and it is a possibility that an ail-
American team may be made up entirely
of the players of a single institution."
Nevertheless, Morse expressed himself
as disappointed in Camp's 1923 selection
and regrets the fact that Lawson of Stan
ford, and Phythian of U. S. C. were not
given the honorable mention which was
accorded Anderson of U. S. C.„ Horrell
of California, Campbell of Stanford,
and Witter of California.

(Minnesota), halfbacks; and Mallary
(Yale), fullback.
Relative to Camp's selection, Franklin
(Brick) Morse, former All-American
halfback from Princeton, 1893, wrote that
it "had been dubbed 'the annual disap
pointment'." Explaining this, he says,
"Every institution that makes any kind of
a showing during the year expects at least
one of its players to be included. . . but
it is obvious that there are to be some
heartaches in view of the fact that there
are 61<S recognized universities and col
lege in the United States."
On the other hand, in refutation of the
view that an All-American should liter
ally be an All-American, Morse writes
that those holding this view lose sight of
the fact that the players are selected on
the basis of "getting together the best
players and it is a possibility that an ail-
American team may be made up entirely
of the players of a single institution."
Nevertheless, Morse expressed himself
as disappointed in Camp's 1923 selection
and regrets the fact that Lawson of Stan
ford, and Phythian of U. S. C. were not
given the honorable mention which was
accorded Anderson of U. S. C.„ Horrell
of California, Campbell of Stanford,
and Witter of California.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford fullback, and
"Stew" Beam, California tackle, who
were placed on Walter Camp's third 1923
All-American eleven were the only Pa
cific Coast gridders to receive places
among the former Yale coach's selections.
Three teams were picked as usual by
Camp comprising thirty-three men. Of
this number, only eight were from col
leges and universities not in the East,
Beam and Nevers, as third string men,
being the only two from the Far West.
Camp's first mythical eleven as it would
trot on the field would be: Bomar (Van
derbilt) and Hazel (Rutgers), ends; Mil
stead (Yale) and Sundstrom (Cornell),
tackles; Hubbard, (Harvard) and Be
denk (Penn State), guards; Blott (Mich
igan), center; Pfann (Cornell), quarter
back; Grange (Illinois), and Martineau
(Minnesota), halfbacks; and Mallary
(Yale), fullback.
