# MALONEY WILL TAKE CHARGE OF VARSITY BOXERS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Boxing practice will start in earnest
| next week when 1 larry Maloncy takes i
j charge of the boxing team aspirants. Jake I
i Irwin has been training them for the past |
! three months, while Maloncy was work- J
| ing with the soccer team, and lie lias the ;
I men well lined up for Maloney.
The boxers have no scheduled bouts as ;
yet, but the California matches will take
place in April, at Berkeley. If possible,
[ a freshman team will be organized which
j will compete with the Blue and Gold
J yearlings. A freshman team has never
I represented the college before, but due to
I the large number of freshmen who have
turned out this year, it is hoped expe
rienced men can be found for each
weight.
Th'c Australian authorities have not j
been heard from regarding the proposed]
i trip to Australia this summer, but Ma-
I lonev believes that the trip can lie ar
ranged.
A number of veterans wf last year are
on the squad again. In the heavyweight
group Robinson is again on deck. He has
been out for football and is in good shape.
Van Hook should lead in the light heavy
weight class.
Irwin will fight in the middleweight
I class again. He had little trouble winning
! his matches last year and is going better
than ever now. Armbuster, the intercol
legiate featherweight champion, has been
going through workouts all year and is in
fine shape to defend his title.
The welterweights who are fighting it
j out for places-arc Adams, Penepacker,
kind Hall. Adams and Penepacker were
j evenly matched last year and Maloney
will have a hard timy'selecting between
them. Hall was a lightweight last year
but has put on weight since then and will
have to fight in a heavier class.
Schall, a freshman middleweight, who j
i hails from Colorado, is one of the best j
boxers seen for some time in the Stan- j
ford ring, Maloncy says. This man will •
be a sure winner for the fnjshmen this
year, and will also be a find for the next l
varsity. None of the other freshmen have i
shown much ability yet, but as material I
abounds in the 1927 class good men should |
be found for each class.

Boxing practice will start in earnest
| next week when 1 larry Maloncy takes i
j charge of the boxing team aspirants. Jake I
i Irwin has been training them for the past |
! three months, while Maloncy was work- J
| ing with the soccer team, and lie lias the ;
I men well lined up for Maloney.
The boxers have no scheduled bouts as ;
yet, but the California matches will take
place in April, at Berkeley. If possible,
[ a freshman team will be organized which
j will compete with the Blue and Gold
J yearlings. A freshman team has never
I represented the college before, but due to
I the large number of freshmen who have
turned out this year, it is hoped expe
rienced men can be found for each
weight.
Th'c Australian authorities have not j
been heard from regarding the proposed]
i trip to Australia this summer, but Ma-
I lonev believes that the trip can lie ar
ranged.
A number of veterans wf last year are
on the squad again. In the heavyweight
group Robinson is again on deck. He has
been out for football and is in good shape.
Van Hook should lead in the light heavy
weight class.
Irwin will fight in the middleweight
I class again. He had little trouble winning
! his matches last year and is going better
than ever now. Armbuster, the intercol
legiate featherweight champion, has been
going through workouts all year and is in
fine shape to defend his title.
The welterweights who are fighting it
j out for places-arc Adams, Penepacker,
kind Hall. Adams and Penepacker were
j evenly matched last year and Maloney
will have a hard timy'selecting between
them. Hall was a lightweight last year
but has put on weight since then and will
have to fight in a heavier class.
Schall, a freshman middleweight, who j
i hails from Colorado, is one of the best j
boxers seen for some time in the Stan- j
ford ring, Maloncy says. This man will •
be a sure winner for the fnjshmen this
year, and will also be a find for the next l
varsity. None of the other freshmen have i
shown much ability yet, but as material I
abounds in the 1927 class good men should |
be found for each class.
