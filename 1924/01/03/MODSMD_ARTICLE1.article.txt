A new record for the first clay of the i
winter quarter registration was made 1
yesterday according to reports from the j
Registrar's office. Â» j
The number who completed their reg- j
istration in the University yesterday j
reached 2371 as compared with 2290 j
on the first day of registration last Jan
uary. Of this number yesterday, 478 I
were women and 1893 were men.
In addition to the reported number of |
2371, 120 students partially completed |
their registration but final enrollment
is being delayed by routine matters. It 1
is also known that a considerable num- j
ber who intended to enroll in the Uni-j
versity this quarter have not yet !
reached the campus.
Contrary to the usual occurrence,!
the falling off in total registration is j
smaller this year. Registration enroll- j
mentis less by 269 at the present time j
than it was on the first day of the aut- '
nmn quarter this year, whereas the dif- i
ference between the two quarters last j
year was 334.
