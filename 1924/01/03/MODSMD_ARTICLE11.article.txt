# VARSITY QUINTET TO BEGIN SEASON TOMORROW NIGHT
## Cardinal Five Will Tackle College of Pacific in First 1924 Game 
### 
Basketball season opens officially
on the campus tomorrow night when
the Stanford varsity quintet meets the
College of the Pacific in the Pavilion
in the first scheduled game of the
1924 season.
Swede Righter's Tigers have a
reputation of being proficient in the
art of tossing a leather ball about a
hoop court, and it is believed that
they will give the varsity some fairly
tough opposition in the first contest.
Last year Righter's quintet managed
to hold the Cards to a close score. He
had developed a well-balanced team,
lacking in experience but full of fight.
Running Guard in Doubt
After a good workout during the
Christmas holidays, which included a
practice game with the Ellery Arms
quintet, the Cards should be capable
of giving the San Jose aggregation
some stiff opposition. With Ernie
Nevers and "Nip" McHose working
along together, and Gurdon Steele and
Dave Oliva bolstering up the center
and standing guard posts there is no
reason to believe that Stanford will
have a weaker team than last year.
It is true that the running guard ques
tion is still open to conjecture and
candidates for the position seem to be
scarce, but there are a few men on
the squad, who with careful training,
should work up to a first team place.
Bears and U. S. C. Strong
The hardest games of the schedule
are against U. S. C. and California.
Both of these universities are reported
to have a bright outlook. The Bears
especially seem to have a wealth of
capable basketball material from
which to draw.
Dave Oliva and "Nip" McHose are
the two stars on the Stanford varsity
which can be depended upon to fur
nish most of the telling competition
against the opposing teams. Both are
experienced players, and playing as
they are at the opposite ends of the
court, they balance the squad in such
a way that any offensive passing can
easily be started, and any defensive
passing effectively blocked.
The new rooting sections in the
pavlion are being completed, and will
be ready some time in the next two
weeks, if not for the opening game.

tough opposition in the first contest.
Last year Righter's quintet managed
to hold the Cards to a close score. He
had developed a well-balanced team,
lacking in experience but full of fight.
Running Guard in Doubt
After a good workout during the
Christmas holidays, which included a
practice game with the Ellery Arms
quintet, the Cards should be capable
of giving the San Jose aggregation
some stiff opposition. With Ernie
Nevers and "Nip" McHose working
along together, and Gurdon Steele and
Dave Oliva bolstering up the center
and standing guard posts there is no
reason to believe that Stanford will
have a weaker team than last year.
It is true that the running guard ques
tion is still open to conjecture and
candidates for the position seem to be
scarce, but there are a few men on
the squad, who with careful training,
should work up to a first team place.
Bears and U. S. C. Strong
The hardest games of the schedule
are against U. S. C. and California.
Both of these universities are reported
to have a bright outlook. The Bears
especially seem to have a wealth of
capable basketball material from
which to draw.
Dave Oliva and "Nip" McHose are
the two stars on the Stanford varsity
which can be depended upon to fur
nish most of the telling competition
against the opposing teams. Both are
experienced players, and playing as
they are at the opposite ends of the
court, they balance the squad in such
a way that any offensive passing can
easily be started, and any defensive
passing effectively blocked.
The new rooting sections in the
pavlion are being completed, and will
be ready some time in the next two
weeks, if not for the opening game.
