# NEW THEATRE SUGGESTED
## Guy Bates Post, Famous Actor, Advocates Novel Plan For Campus Dramatics 
### Beatrice Flesher 
Guy Bates Post, known for his char
acterizations, both 011 stage and
; screen, in "The Masquerader" and
; "Omar the Tentraaker," and who re
cently starred at the Columbia Thea
ter in San Francisco in "The Climax,"
gives a novel suggestion in an inter-,
! view for enlarging the scope of dra
matic study at Stanford.
"Why don't you build a new thea-j
ter?" he asks. "And invite well known
stars to come for a single perform
ance? I think it would be a wonderful
thug if it were encouraged. Invite
stars who are worthy; it will dignify
them as well as the University. Prom
ise to fill the house to the doors, so
that they would want to come. At
first, it might be rather difficult, but
; after the idea has been given sufficient,
publicity, it will be much easier.
Should Be Exclusive
"If you would make it an occasion,
and if the stars knew that only cer
tain ones were to be invited, perhaps
for only three or four performances a
year, they would welcome the oppor
tunity to accept your invitation. I
moan this to be an educational fea
ture," says the actor. "The play may
be a classic, and it may be good with
out having been written by Gals
worthy, as some people thing is neces
sary. If the standard of the actor is
high he will be able to appear in a
play that is worth while studying."
After discussing the value of mov
• ing pictures, Post laughs and makes

I
a further suggestion for the Univer
sity. "I think the play department
should develop a moving picture sce
nario department."
Does Best Work on Stage
When asked whether he enjoyed
working in pictures as well as in plays,
Mr. Post replied in the negative. The
reason, he says, is because his work
1 in motion pictures is inferior to that
on the speaking stage.
' After having spent the last two
years in California where he was en-j
gaged in making movies, Post is now;
returning to the legitimate stage, in!
the play in which lie appeared in San |
Francisco. He is now on his way to
several Eastern and Southern cities,
and, eventually, to New York.
Cinema Has Possibility
"I think the movies have great pos
sibilities, and sometime in the future
they will be as a changeing procession
viewed from the top of a mountain, in
the opalescent light of the sky."
Post is an admirer of Stanford, and
thinks it is unlike any other college
in the United States. Of the campus, j
he says, "I shall never forget my visit
to Stanford —that long ride up to the
circle, and then that magnificent
chapel beyond. I never drive by the
campus without stopping, if only to
go up Palm Drive and back."
Dislikes "Soup" Interviews
In giving his opinion of newspaper
reporters, the actor complains of poor
interviews. "I don't like the kind
which mentions the person in question,
and adds that he took a swallow of
soup before answering the next ques
tion." He said that, even though some
reporters can not write an interview,
from a conversation, there are other
men who write wonderful stories from
the same kind of a conversation. "My
manager is a newspaper man, and he
can write a story out of a look."
"I am going South where cotton is
36 cents a bale. Did you know that?"
And then he explained that he must
be more than an actor. He must be
well versed in everything else, be
cause he has to think of costumes,
scenes, and the many other things
which go on "behind the scenes" be
fore a play is complete for presenta
tion.

"I think the movies have great pos
sibilities, and sometime in the future
they will be as a changeing procession
viewed from the top of a mountain, in
the opalescent light of the sky."
Post is an admirer of Stanford, and
thinks it is unlike any other college
in the United States. Of the campus, j
he says, "I shall never forget my visit
to Stanford —that long ride up to the
circle, and then that magnificent
chapel beyond. I never drive by the
campus without stopping, if only to
go up Palm Drive and back."
Dislikes "Soup" Interviews
In giving his opinion of newspaper
reporters, the actor complains of poor
interviews. "I don't like the kind
which mentions the person in question,
and adds that he took a swallow of
soup before answering the next ques
tion." He said that, even though some
reporters can not write an interview,
from a conversation, there are other
men who write wonderful stories from
the same kind of a conversation. "My
manager is a newspaper man, and he
can write a story out of a look."
"I am going South where cotton is
36 cents a bale. Did you know that?"
And then he explained that he must
be more than an actor. He must be
well versed in everything else, be
cause he has to think of costumes,
scenes, and the many other things
which go on "behind the scenes" be
fore a play is complete for presenta
tion.

acterizations, both 011 stage and

cently starred at the Columbia Thea
ter in San Francisco in "The Climax,"
gives a novel suggestion in an inter-,
! view for enlarging the scope of dra
matic study at Stanford.
"Why don't you build a new thea-j
ter?" he asks. "And invite well known
stars to come for a single perform
ance? I think it would be a wonderful
thug if it were encouraged. Invite
stars who are worthy; it will dignify
them as well as the University. Prom
ise to fill the house to the doors, so
that they would want to come. At
first, it might be rather difficult, but
; after the idea has been given sufficient,
publicity, it will be much easier.
Should Be Exclusive
"If you would make it an occasion,
and if the stars knew that only cer
tain ones were to be invited, perhaps
for only three or four performances a
year, they would welcome the oppor
tunity to accept your invitation. I
moan this to be an educational fea
ture," says the actor. "The play may
be a classic, and it may be good with
out having been written by Gals
worthy, as some people thing is neces
sary. If the standard of the actor is
high he will be able to appear in a
play that is worth while studying."

a further suggestion for the Univer
sity. "I think the play department
should develop a moving picture sce
nario department."
Does Best Work on Stage
When asked whether he enjoyed
working in pictures as well as in plays,
Mr. Post replied in the negative. The
reason, he says, is because his work
