# BASEBALL PRACTICE TO BEGIN ON MONDAY
## 
### 
Baseball practice will begin Monday
afternoon on the varsity field undei
the direction of Coach Harry Wolter.
Several of the varsity players and
candidates have already had one quar
ter of practice, and more are expected
to turn out for the first workout. The
first game of the year is scheduled for
January 19. The opponent has not yet
been named.
The infield, which was the weakest
link in the 1923 nine, will be bolstered j
considerably by players from last 1
year's freshman team, and transfers
from other universities. The outfield
veterans are Tom McCanless and
Frank Deffebach.
Strong Infield
The infield will probably be gar-|
nered from most of the last year candi-j
dates, including Captain Patterson,
"Bud" Woodward, "Shorty" Robert-1
son, and Roland Muchay.
Besides these players are "Chuck" i
Johnston, who played tackle on the i
varsity football team and has had ex-|
perience as a catcher, Bert Green, cap
tain of last year's freshman team, who j
is a good hitter and third baseman,!
and Jim Lawson, who is eligible to j
compete this year behind the mask.
The catching department is far from j
being weak. Patterson,; Johnston, andj
Jim Lawson are all A1 players, andj
three of the strongest hitters among (
the list of candidates. Patterson will
no doubt be shifted back to his old
position at first base, leaving the back
stop position open to Johnston and
Lawson. This leaves third base open
to "Bud"Woodward, who played at
that post for a while last season.
Hitters Needed
Hitters are something that Coach j
Wolter needs, and he needs them I
badly. There is no doubt but that sev-1
eral good fielders will be sacrificed to
put in strong batters.
Candidates from last year's fresh-1
man team are woefully weak in this |
department of the game. The 1912G
team lost many easy games last sea
son because of the lack of telling hits,
and improvement from this list ap
pears doubtful.

first game of the year is scheduled for
January 19. The opponent has not yet
been named.
The infield, which was the weakest
link in the 1923 nine, will be bolstered j
considerably by players from last 1
year's freshman team, and transfers
from other universities. The outfield
veterans are Tom McCanless and
Frank Deffebach.
Strong Infield
The infield will probably be gar-|
nered from most of the last year candi-j
dates, including Captain Patterson,
"Bud" Woodward, "Shorty" Robert-1
son, and Roland Muchay.
Besides these players are "Chuck" i
Johnston, who played tackle on the i
varsity football team and has had ex-|
perience as a catcher, Bert Green, cap
tain of last year's freshman team, who j
is a good hitter and third baseman,!
and Jim Lawson, who is eligible to j
compete this year behind the mask.
The catching department is far from j
being weak. Patterson,; Johnston, andj
Jim Lawson are all A1 players, andj
three of the strongest hitters among (
the list of candidates. Patterson will
no doubt be shifted back to his old
position at first base, leaving the back
stop position open to Johnston and
Lawson. This leaves third base open
to "Bud"Woodward, who played at
that post for a while last season.
Hitters Needed
Hitters are something that Coach j
Wolter needs, and he needs them I
badly. There is no doubt but that sev-1
eral good fielders will be sacrificed to
put in strong batters.
Candidates from last year's fresh-1
man team are woefully weak in this |
department of the game. The 1912G
team lost many easy games last sea
son because of the lack of telling hits,
and improvement from this list ap
pears doubtful.
