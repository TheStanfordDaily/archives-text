# APPOINTMENT OFFICE LIBRARY NEEDS BOOKS
## 
### 
Durng the five quarters that the j
Appointment Office has maintained its,
free lending library of text books, only
one book has not been returned. The
library consists of almost four hun
dred books donated to the office, and
loaned to men and women who need
them.
More than 150 students have used
the library during the past year.
But the demand exceeds the supply.
Students who still have their text
books are urged to send them to the
appointment office. The books are
loaned without charge, students mere-j
ly being required to sign up l'oÂ«* them.
