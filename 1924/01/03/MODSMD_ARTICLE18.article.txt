To the Union Board of Governors, a body composed of students,
alumni, and faculty:
Here are a few things the Daily Palo Alto would like to know :
To begin: When are the promises that the new soda fountain will be
ready by the first of the quarter going to come true? Or when are you
going to stop making promises ?
Next: When are the reduced prices and better service going to ma
terialize that were promised after the departure of Wilson's—if at all ?
And then: When is the Union store going to fulfill the purpose for
which it was opened, namely, to be a store which would accommodate the
needs of the entire university, provide more than a bar (often rather
dirty), and a place to get something to eat because there is no other place.
In other words, are you ever going to cease taking advantage of your
monopoly by providing a store fully as unsanitary looking as "that ter
rible Sticky's," without seats, tables, or the stock and accommodations nec
essary to satisfy the wants of students?
Finally: Do you really expect that your store will take the place of
the service which Jack Meyers, with all his many faults, gave to the stu
dents living in Encina Hall ? Do you believe that students wanting some
thing to eat after the dining halls are closed would rather walk over to the
Union than have a store in their own building ?
The Daily Palo Alto would be very pleased to find out about
details, and if the knowledge acquired can dam the wave of protest which
has risen in the student body over the management of its store, the Daily
will be very glad to praise this same Union Board of Governors for the
excellent work it has done with its restaurant and cafeteria.
