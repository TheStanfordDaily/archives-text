The departure of John Maxson Stillman from the Stanford circle has
taken away an influence which for more than a quarter of a century has
moulded generations of Stanford men and women.
From the time of the founding of the University in 1891, when lie be
came executive head of the Chemistry department, Dr. Stillman served
Stanford wisely, tactfully, unselfishly as a trusted adviser to the trustees,
a counselor to presidents of the University, a generous executive, and an
inspiring teacher. He was vice-president from 1913-1917. Dr. Still
man's death occurred on December 13, the day after the final publication
of the Daily Palo Alto last quarter.
When Senator Stanford turned over to Dr. Jordan a trunk tilled with
thousands of applications for teaching positions in the new university, he
suggested that the trunk !* kept closed until after the appointments. But
he requested that consideration lie given to the qualifications of young
Stillman, then a chemist in a large sugar refinery at Boston. One inter:
view settled the matter.
Always keeping foremost the development of his department, Dr. Still
man often sacrificed his personal ambitions and desires for the production
of inspiring instructors and excellent scholars. Credit was given where
credit was due. An esprit de corps and loyalty to the department head
existed in the chemistry building second to none in the University.
In an address in 1916 Dr. Wilbur distinguished him as "Dr. Stillman,
that prince of men."
Stanford men and women ofifer tribute to the memory of Dr. Stillman
as a kindly, sympathetic, courteous gentleman whose disinterested, un
ceasing labor as a teacher and administrative officer has helped Ins col
leagues, his students, and the University.
