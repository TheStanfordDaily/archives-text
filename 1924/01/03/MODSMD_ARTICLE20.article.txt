The merrie rushing season is now on. Take heed, lirst yearlings; ,
learn to sign on the dotted line when asked if you will swear to join
any other house; make no comments on the food; and don't pull the
old one about—"Oh —so many names, you know —guess I can't remember
them all —but I'll know the faces." Let the fatherly seniors advise you
as to just what courses to take, so that you what to avoid;
feign interest in the fraternity history, even asking how the founders
spelled their names . . . and unless you can play the piano well, don't
play it at all.

EDITORIAL
There are several signs of the approaching decay
of a student's moral integrity. One of these is the
habit of registering on time. It should be checked
immediately. The University is losing thousands of
dollars every quarter just because a certain number
of students insist always on registering on time and
thus avoiding the fee of two dollars that would other
wise go to the University.
If 2,000 students registered late each
quarter, Stanford would receive 4,000
dollars extra per quarter —$12,000 extra
per year. And with so much surplus
money, perhaps the tuition could be
reduced.
So let us all get together and see if we
can not register late consistently, and
thus eventually reduce our tuition fees.
It is the only way we can save ourselves
money.

It is quite obvious that this monopoly of the bookstore coupons by the
Women's Clubhouse Fund is going to lead to a sorry state of affairs. It is
estimated that at the rate the coupons are beng collected now. it will be a
mere matter of years until the Women's Clubhouse controls the bookstore.
Then what. No more law books; no more slide rules (except
for dancing); no more Economic Histories —in short, no more of
anything that has made life so pleasant and bearable for us all
in the past.
Instead, there will be undoubtedly treatises on the Fox Trot as contrasted
with the Paris Twitch, and innumerable books on forms of Jazz Music and
how to distinguish them; not to mention pamphlets on the Proper Serving of
Tea and Guidance of Matrons of Honor.
Oh, well —it's lucky the Women's Clubhouse did it instead of
the new Union bar.
