# BLEWETT LEADS LIST OF COUNTRY'S DROP KICKERS
## 
### 
Bill Blewett, University of Califor
nia, stands at the top of the list of
drop kickers for the 1923 football sea
son. In one game he made three drop
kicks out of the four attempted. This
ties him with two others for the num
ber of successful kicks made in one
game. Arnold, of the University of
Virginia, and Rutherford, of Virginia
Polytechnic, each succeeded in putting
the ball between the posts three times

lin the same gam. Mallory of Yale
scored two drop kicks in the Yale-
Princeton game and two more in the
Yale-Harvard game.
