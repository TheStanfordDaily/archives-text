# JAMES SWINNERTON EXHIBITS SKETCHES AT ART GALLERY
## Hopi Indians Are Depicted; Japanese Paintings by Old Masters Shown 
### Allene Thorpe 
Two art exhibitions, one a series of
about thirty sketches recently made
by James Swinnerton in the Hopi
reservation of Arizona, and the other
a display of twenty-two original Japa
nese paintings done by old masters,
will be on exhibition at the Stanford
Art Gallery until January 7.
The Swinnerton sketches were made
during an unusual stormy season, and
the artist painted under many difficult
conditions in order not to miss the
unusual atmospheric effects. These
paintings are full of the crisp, virile
color typical of the Indian country.
The rare atmosphere in this district
make the colors stand out with a
brilliancy that hardly seems possible
