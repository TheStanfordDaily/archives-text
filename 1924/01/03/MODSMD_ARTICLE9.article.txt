# JAMES SWINNERTON EXHIBITS SKETCHES AT ART GALLERY
## Hopi Indians Are Depicted; Japanese Paintings by Old Masters Shown 
### Allene Thorpe 
Two art exhibitions, one a series of
about thirty sketches recently made
by James Swinnerton in the Hopi
reservation of Arizona, and the other
a display of twenty-two original Japa
nese paintings done by old masters,
will be on exhibition at the Stanford
Art Gallery until January 7.
The Swinnerton sketches were made
during an unusual stormy season, and
the artist painted under many difficult
conditions in order not to miss the
unusual atmospheric effects. These
paintings are full of the crisp, virile
color typical of the Indian country.
The rare atmosphere in this district
make the colors stand out with a
brilliancy that hardly seems possible
to one who v .6 not been down in
the Indian -ands.
Sk'.ohes Show Spirit of Desert
Ine sketches show that without
doubt Swinnerton has caught the
spirit of this locality. Even in these
field paintings one can sense the big
ness and grandeurs of the desert coun
try. Among the Indian inhabitants
Swinnerton has established himself as
a "man who knows how to paint rain."
Several very effective sketches show
ing rain and rain clouds on the desert
are among the collection.
The original Japanese paintings
done by old masters date from the
fourteenth century and include such
artists as Mitsunari, Sosen, Keibun,
Mokkai, Eiga, and Matahei.
All the wall pictures are known as
kakemonos and are oblong pieces of
silk framed in strips of brocade,
mounted on a long narrow strip of
canvas with wooden rollers. They are
done in water color with the direct
stroke of a master artist.
Pictures Painted on Silk
The pictures are painted on silk
which has first been rubbed over with
fine powder which makes the sur
face very much like paper. When the
artist works he places this drawing
on the floor with weights at the four
corners. The artist kneels in front of
it and holds the brush In a perpen
dicular position. The brush is held
three or four inches from the painting
end, allowing for a free swinging
stroke.
In a case with this exhibition are
being shown the rare Tosho-Gu picture
rolls which were presented to Dr. Jor
dan by the Society for the Celebration
of the Tercentenary of the To-aho-gu.
These books are works of the most
elaborate description on which the
great artist Kang Morinobu spent five
solid years of his life. They represent
incidents in the life of Tokugawa
Iyeyasu, a great man in Japanese his
tory.
Owing to the length of the picture
rolls only a portion of them can be
shown at one time. These books are
the ones recently donated to the Stan
ford library by Dr. Jordan, and are
now on public display at the art gal
lery.
