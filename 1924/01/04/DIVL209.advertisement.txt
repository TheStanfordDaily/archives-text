The Merry, Merry
Maiden
need not fear if site cannot track the wily Greek
verb right down to its principal parts, at least she
can startle the Prof out of his erudite lethargy
with her hat! Consider the possibilities of a hat
in the Classroom!
Adorable little cloches, and larger shapes which
curve gracefully from the facc are among the
new spring hat models at the Livingston Shop.
Done in Angora Wool and Swiss Milan Straw
in most adaptable color combinations, and so
comfortable! Also, hearken to the price, only
$10!
