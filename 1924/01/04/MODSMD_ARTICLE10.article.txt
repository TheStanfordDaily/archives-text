# HISTORY TOLD BY STAMPS
## Postage Issues Of Russia, Collected by Stanford Man, Now In Library 
### 
From government of Tsar to that
of peasant in ten years has been the
history of Russia, and the postage
stamps of the country tell the story.
On the stamps of the Romanoff
Centenary issue of 1913, Tears and
Tsarinas of the Romanoffs are shown
—rulers from Peter the Great to
Nicholas 11, with pictures of the Krem
lin, the Petersburg winter palace, and
the old Romanoff family house in
Moscow. On the Soviet issues of 1923,
the worker, the red-army soldier, and
the peasant stand forth.
Late Romanoff postage, with stamps
of the First Republic and the Soviet,
collected by Robin Lampson, '23, while
in Russia in 1922, is now on exhibi
tion in the Library.
Money Values Decrease
The rise and fall of money values is
clearly shown in these stamps. The
last four stamp issues of the Tsar in
1916 showed a decided rise in value,
marking the loss in value of the
ruler's money. Through the revolu
tionary days of the First Republic and
Soviet control, postage values were

constantly increased to meet the de
creasing money values until letters
were covered with whole sheets of
stamps. With the union of the Soviet
Republics in 1923 and the advent of
the gold ruble, postage values are
gradually coming back to normal.
Charity Stamps Sold
Stamp issues were many and differ-
J
ent in character and color. Charity
stamps, sold above the postage value
for the aid of soldiers and their fami
lies or the famine-stricken, were nu
merous. One issue—a slate-colored
forty-ruble stamp, depicts the Russian
worker who has just finished killing
"the jobberwock of capitalism." The
stamps of Azerbaijan, a small but rich
petroleum state in the Caucasus on
the Caspian sea, made autonomous by
the League of Nations but which later
joined the Russian soviet union, pic
ture the capital city of Baku, and show
a peasant cutting grain indicating that
I the people engage extensively in agri
culture.

last four stamp issues of the Tsar in
1916 showed a decided rise in value,
marking the loss in value of the
ruler's money. Through the revolu
tionary days of the First Republic and
Soviet control, postage values were

constantly increased to meet the de
creasing money values until letters
were covered with whole sheets of
stamps. With the union of the Soviet
Republics in 1923 and the advent of
the gold ruble, postage values are
gradually coming back to normal.
Charity Stamps Sold
Stamp issues were many and differ-
J
ent in character and color. Charity
stamps, sold above the postage value
for the aid of soldiers and their fami
lies or the famine-stricken, were nu
merous. One issue—a slate-colored
forty-ruble stamp, depicts the Russian
worker who has just finished killing
"the jobberwock of capitalism." The
stamps of Azerbaijan, a small but rich
petroleum state in the Caucasus on
the Caspian sea, made autonomous by
the League of Nations but which later
joined the Russian soviet union, pic
ture the capital city of Baku, and show
a peasant cutting grain indicating that
I the people engage extensively in agri
culture.
