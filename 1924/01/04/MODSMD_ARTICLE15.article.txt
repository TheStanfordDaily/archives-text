# BABES WILL MEET PLACER IN FIRST BASKETBALL GAME
## Freshmen Show Class in Scrimmages Against Varsity Five 
### 
Freshman basketballers will 1)6
given their first test tomorrow eve
ning when they meet the strong Placer
High School five from Auburn in a
preliminary to the varsity game.
Placer comes with a record of six
straight victories this season with no
defeats chalked up against it. In addi
tion to this, the Auburn players were
the North Valley champions in the
C. I. F. last year.
The freshmen have played a
regular game as yet, but they have
been sent against the varsity in scrim,
mages several times. Yesterday after
noon, the Babes played the varsity to
a standstill, which is a good indication
that Hunt has the material for a good
team.
No Line-up Announced
Encina gymnasium has been
swamped with freshmen aspirants for
the class team. From some fifty odd
players, Hunt has picked fifteen out
standing players, all of whom are
likely to get in the game tomorrow.
A combination which worked
smoothly against the varsity last night
had Jayred at center, Price and David
at forwards, and Shipkey and New
house at guards. While Hunt has an
nounced no lineup, it is probable that
most of these men will start the game.
Substitutions will be frequent, in
order that the coach may ftet a bettei
line on his men.
Newhouse Good Guard
Newliouse is the heaviest man on
the team, yet he also has lots of speed
combined with his weight. He plays
standing guard. Sheipkey at running
guard is a fast floor man as well as a
capable defensive player.
Jayred, Menzies, and Newkirk will
fight it out at center. Jayred may
start, but both of the other men are
of high calibre and Hunt may start
any of them.
David showed up well last night. He
turned out later than the rest, but is
fast rounding into shape. He is a
player of the Jimmie Davies type, and
is a consistent shooter. Price at the
other forward position, plays a fast,
flashy floor game, and is also an ac
curate shot. Other forwards who may
get in are Southworth, Blazier, George,
Parsons, and Riese.
