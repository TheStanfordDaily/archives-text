# Opportunity For Journalists
## 
### 
Tryouts for 1 the staff of the Daily Palo Alto will begin on Monday.
They will last one week.
During that week a test will be made which will lay emphasis on
literary ability, on the faculty of seeing "news" and writing it in proper
journalistic style, and on skill in writing feature stories. Previous
experience may be a help, but it is not in the least necessary.
After the test has been made, about half a dozen people will be added
to the staff.
In warning to those who are looking for honor without work it can
be announced now that students who want only student body honors may
best further their small causes by staying away from the Daily office.
The editorial staff of the Daily Palo Alto is run throughout on the
tryoutee system. Reporters on the News Staff are given "beats" cover
ing all the important news sources on the campus, and their standing on
the staff is determined by the manner in which they cover their assign
ments, the number of extra stories they turn in, the literary quality of
their feature writing, and their work in the office on the mechanical
details of putting out the paper.
News Editors are chosen from those who stand at the top of the list
of reporters. They are each in charge of one department of the paper,
and have a staff under them to whom they assign the work of the
department. Reporters hand in their "copy" to the department heads,
who read the stories, correct mistakes, and prepare the news for publica
tion. They are the judges of the work done by the reporters under them.
In addition, each News Editor has charge of putting out the paper
once a week. While on the news desk the News Editor looks over all
copy, designs the make-up of the front page, and makes sure that all
news which should be published on that day is handed in, corrected and
accurate.
The Managing Editor and Associate Editor are equal in standing on
the staff, and are chosen from the most capable of the News Editors.
The Managing Editor has charge of putting the type into the forms,
inspecting the paper for typographical errors in headlines, and other
jobs connected with the printing end of a newspaper.
The Associate Editor has supervision over the work in the Daily
office, inspects the headlines each day, and orders necessary corrections
in the make-up.
The Editor is elected by the editorial staff. Usually either the
Associate Editor or the Managing Editor is chosen in the staff election.
In case of a close contest the defeated candidate may appeal to a Quad
election.
The Editor has general supervision over the whole staff organization,
assigns beats, makes appointments in co-operation with the Associate
Editor and Managing Editor, and determines the policy of the paper.
By this system of selection the most capable people, from new try
outees upward, are always assured of advancement.
