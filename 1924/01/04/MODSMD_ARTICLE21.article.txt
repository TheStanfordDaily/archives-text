# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## 
### 
Wild Bill Hickok, featuring William
S. Hart, at the Varsity Theater, is one
of those historical pictures which lend
arguments for remaining at home to
study calculus considerable effective
ness. It is a desperate film.
Carefully culling over the sheaves
of comment which litter this depart
ment, we find that one man who used
to live in Garden City, Montana, where
the scene is laid, casts a vote of ap
proval with reservations. Near the
aisle seat, a certain satisfaction was
overheard at the incessant slaughtei
of extra-bad actors. That's the best
we could do after hours of search.
As usual, frozen-faced Bill scatters
unerring death from both guns as he
crouches unscathed beneath a hail ol
bullets. If that's the stuff you like, by
all means see this film. Mr. Hart out
does every one of his previous at
tempts in this portrayal of fierce vir
tue, hurling all consideration of cost
sheets to the winds in the discharge
of enormous quantities of ammunition.
It is too bad that the Green Goddess,
with George Arliss, could not have
stayed over the week-end at t|ie Stan
ford Theater. That is a good evening's
entertainment. â€”H. R.
