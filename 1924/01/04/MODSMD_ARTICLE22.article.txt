# To Cut Or Not To Cut
## 
### 
A student who cuts classes for an
invalid reason is apt to remind one of
the Biblical quotation—"casting pearls
before swine," though every student
would undoubtedly resent such an im
plication.
Why do they do it?
Probably, in most cases, because
they feel that one cut doesn't make
any difference. But this attitude is apt
to resolve itself into another before
the semester ends —the "I don't care
whether I go to that class or not"
attitude.
The "cutter" finds himself getting
farther and farther behind, and when
he returns is baffled at the progress
the class has made while lie was
away. The things discussed are new
and strange to him; the final looms up
menacingly and he begins to wish he
had never begun the course.
"cutter" usually cuts because
he hasn't prepared his assignment and
is little apt to catch up later. But
what he loses by not attending the
recitation or lecture far overbalances
the censuring he might have received
for the unprepared assignment.
Cutting is a habit. Like most other
habits, it can be broken with a little
personal, persistent effort. —University
