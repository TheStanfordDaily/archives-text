# JUNIOR PROM ABOLISHED AT PRINCETON AS MENACE
## 
### 
Conditions at dances at Princeton
have caused the abolition of the an
nual Junior Prom from that campus.
The Council of 1923, after considering
the past history of Princeton dances
and the future menace which they
presented to the University's good
name, decided to abolish the annual
big dance. This action was confirmed
by the present council and sustained
by the administration.
