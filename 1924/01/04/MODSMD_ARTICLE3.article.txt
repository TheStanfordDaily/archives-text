was married to Miss Violet M.
Curry, of San Jose. The pair be
came acquainted at Pacific Grove
high school where they attended
and from which they graduated.
The elopement took place without
the knowledge of any of Work's
friends or his parents.
Work, senior, who is president
of the First National Bank of Mon

his son yesterday confirming the
rumor of his marriage. It simply
stated that the couple had been
united. The Stanford man gave his
age as 21 in obtaining the license,
but his real age could not be
learned from his father, nor was
any other comment forthcoming.
