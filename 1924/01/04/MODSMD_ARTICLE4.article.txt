# ECONOMIC FUTURE OF UNITED STATES IS BRIGHT-HOOVER
## Wide-Spread Improvement in Condition of Country Noted Since War 
### 
"In 1923, the United States wit
nessed the highest total productivity
and movement of commodities since
the war, with full employment, high
wages, greatly increased savings, large
additions to home building, and the
largest increase in railway equipment
since the war," declares Herbert
Hoover, Secretary of Commerce, in a
statement concerning economic condi
tions which has just been officially 1
issued.
Hoover believes that economic
prospects for 1924 are favorable be
cause of the general spirit of prudence,
the absence of speculation, complete
employment, high production, and the
great financial strength and stability
of the important states in the Western
Hemisphere. The extraordinary finan
cial strength and progress exhibited
by the United States is indicated by (
the following:
The national debt has been reduced
about one billion dollars during the
year; bank debits to individual ac
counts, except in New York, have in
creased about twelve per cent. The
money in circulation increased about
6 per cent, while member banks show
an increase of aboyt 6 per cent in
loans and discounts. Savings increased
about 10 per cent and life insurance 1
sales amount to 22 per cent.
Excess of Exports Exists
A detailed examination of our eco
nomic situation indicates that our for-j
eign trade will show about $4,100,000,-i
000 in exports and about $3,800,000,000!
in imports. The merchandise balance!
will be about $300,000,000 in our favor.
Net gold and silver imports will al
most liquidate the trade balance.
An increase of 15 per cent in our
manufactured production is expected.,
Tn agricultural products, cotton pro
duction has increased about 3 per
cent, pork products about 2 per cent, j
beef about 5 per cent with a slight
increase in dairy products.
Car loadings were increased by,
about 15 per cent, cargo traffic through .
the Panama Canal doubled, increased'
40 per cent through Sault Ste. Marie j
and 30 per cent through the Erie
Canal, indicating the great increase in
transportation. Building construction
has increased 15 per cent in residen
tial buildings but has decreased 20
per cent in pxiblic buildings. Price
levels maintained comparative stabil
ity. ,
Europe Less Stable
European conditions are less stable
because the German collapse has in

less degree affected every other part
of the world in the opinion of
Hoover. However, the pending negoti
ations for settlement of the German
problem promise well for the future.
Russia is slowly making progress, as
are Greece and Turkey. Mexico is the
only foreign country which has not
shown an increase in political and so
cial stability.

"The basis of healthy business ac
tivity lies in balanced budgets, stable
currency, high production accompanied
by proportionate consumption and sav
ings with an absence of speculation,
extravagance, and inflation. These
things we have in the United States,
which with the hope of decreasing
taxes, indicate favorable economic *
odds in 1924," is the conclusion of the!
Secretary of Commerce.

Hoover believes that economic
prospects for 1924 are favorable be
cause of the general spirit of prudence,
the absence of speculation, complete
employment, high production, and the
great financial strength and stability
of the important states in the Western
Hemisphere. The extraordinary finan
cial strength and progress exhibited
by the United States is indicated by (
the following:
The national debt has been reduced
about one billion dollars during the
year; bank debits to individual ac
counts, except in New York, have in
creased about twelve per cent. The
money in circulation increased about
6 per cent, while member banks show
an increase of aboyt 6 per cent in
loans and discounts. Savings increased
about 10 per cent and life insurance 1
sales amount to 22 per cent.
Excess of Exports Exists
A detailed examination of our eco
nomic situation indicates that our for-j
eign trade will show about $4,100,000,-i
000 in exports and about $3,800,000,000!
in imports. The merchandise balance!
will be about $300,000,000 in our favor.
Net gold and silver imports will al
most liquidate the trade balance.
An increase of 15 per cent in our
manufactured production is expected.,
Tn agricultural products, cotton pro
duction has increased about 3 per
cent, pork products about 2 per cent, j
beef about 5 per cent with a slight
increase in dairy products.
Car loadings were increased by,
about 15 per cent, cargo traffic through .
the Panama Canal doubled, increased'
40 per cent through Sault Ste. Marie j
and 30 per cent through the Erie
Canal, indicating the great increase in
transportation. Building construction
has increased 15 per cent in residen
tial buildings but has decreased 20
per cent in pxiblic buildings. Price
levels maintained comparative stabil
ity. ,
Europe Less Stable
European conditions are less stable
because the German collapse has in

less degree affected every other part
of the world in the opinion of
Hoover. However, the pending negoti
ations for settlement of the German
problem promise well for the future.
Russia is slowly making progress, as
are Greece and Turkey. Mexico is the
only foreign country which has not
shown an increase in political and so
cial stability.

"The basis of healthy business ac
tivity lies in balanced budgets, stable
currency, high production accompanied
by proportionate consumption and sav
ings with an absence of speculation,
extravagance, and inflation. These
things we have in the United States,
which with the hope of decreasing
taxes, indicate favorable economic *
odds in 1924," is the conclusion of the!
Secretary of Commerce.
"In 1923, the United States wit
nessed the highest total productivity
and movement of commodities since
the war, with full employment, high
wages, greatly increased savings, large
additions to home building, and the
largest increase in railway equipment
since the war," declares Herbert
Hoover, Secretary of Commerce, in a
statement concerning economic condi
tions which has just been officially 1
