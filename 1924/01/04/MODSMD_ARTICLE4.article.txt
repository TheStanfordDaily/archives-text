# ECONOMIC FUTURE OF UNITED STATES IS BRIGHT-HOOVER
## Wide-Spread Improvement in Condition of Country Noted Since War 
### 
"In 1923, the United States wit
nessed the highest total productivity
and movement of commodities since
the war, with full employment, high
wages, greatly increased savings, large
additions to home building, and the
largest increase in railway equipment
since the war," declares Herbert
Hoover, Secretary of Commerce, in a
statement concerning economic condi
tions which has just been officially 1
issued.
Hoover believes that economic
prospects for 1924 are favorable be
cause of the general spirit of prudence,
the absence of speculation, complete
employment, high production, and the
great financial strength and stability
of the important states in the Western
Hemisphere. The extraordinary finan
cial strength and progress exhibited
by the United States is indicated by (
the following:
The national debt has been reduced
about one billion dollars during the
year; bank debits to individual ac
counts, except in New York, have in
creased about twelve per cent. The
money in circulation increased about
6 per cent, while member banks show
an increase of aboyt 6 per cent in
loans and discounts. Savings increased
about 10 per cent and life insurance 1
sales amount to 22 per cent.
