# Glee Club Will Give Dance in Clubhouse
## 
### 
"Dance for a dollar tomorrow
night at the Women's Clubhouse,"
is the slogan of the Stanford Glee
Club.
Expenses for the trip to Los
Angeles spring vacation are going
to be partly met by the proceeds of
this dance, for which Ambrose
Whitmer and his orchestra will fur
nish the music. As a financial in
ducement to the "Queeners," the j
10 cent war tax is left off the ad
mission charge and taken out of
the dollar.
