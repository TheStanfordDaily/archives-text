# COLLEGE OF PACIFIC OPENS CARD COURT SEASON TOMORROW
## Stanford Quintet Expected To Make Good Showing In Initial Game Against Righter's Tigers 
### 
Pavilion doors will be thrown open tomorrow night at 8 o'clock for the first
scheduled basketball game of the season between Swede Righter's College
of the Pacific five and the Stanford quintet.
The probable line-up of the Cardinal court men will be: "Nip" McHose and
Ernie Nevers, forwards; Steele, center; Oliva and Mcßurney, guards.
Owing to a misunderstanding, the game was announced in last night's
Daily for tonight instead of tomorrow night.
Team Intact
Just what kind of a showing will be made by the Stanford aggregation is of
interest to more than a few. The scholarship ax landed lightly on the list
of basketball candidates last quarter, and Kerr still has the choice of men
who reported for practice after the football season. The choice is admittedly
small, but there are at least six or seven men who can be relied upon to
furnish the basic strength of the 1924 quintet.
It is difficult to judge any team turned out by Kerr early in the season.
The miracle that the football mentor performed with the gridiron material last
year, when Stanford's pigskin outlook was blackest, is an old story to
University students. But the fact still remains, and if Kerr can bolster up a

S>seemingly hopeless football team and
make one of the strongest showings
in years, there is no reason to doubt
that the Card coach can make a less
hopeless basketball situation seem
still less black.
Well Balanced Quintet
Fundamentally the basketball pros
pects are darker than last season. But
it will not take a miracle to develop
five men who can swing into action
favorably with any quintet on the
Pacific Coast. Four men are veteran
players, and one candidate has had
experience in another college.
The team is even better balanced
than last year's. A light and heavy
man as forwards, a tall, heavy and
fairly fast mau at center, and a pair
of heavy guards, is the way the squad
evens up at present.
The 1923 team always faced the odds
by having two light men, Rogers and
McHose, at forwards. Both were clever
shooters when the ball was near the
basket, but neither were heavy enough
to rush the leather past the safety
guard and take the advantage of the
close shot. Ernie Nevers offsets this
handicap. He is a whirlwind dribbler;
he is fast, and his height makes a shot
easier when within close shooting dis
tance.
Three heavy men on the squad will
also tend to discourage any "rough
and tumble" style which an opposing
team might introduce.

The appointment office of Columbia
University has provided employment
for 2,357 students during the past year.
Out of this number 1,500 were men
whose tasks ranged from play acting
to detective work, and 857 women
were employed in work ranging from
stenographers to artists' models.

make one of the strongest showings
in years, there is no reason to doubt
that the Card coach can make a less
hopeless basketball situation seem
still less black.
Well Balanced Quintet
Fundamentally the basketball pros
pects are darker than last season. But
it will not take a miracle to develop
five men who can swing into action
favorably with any quintet on the
Pacific Coast. Four men are veteran
players, and one candidate has had
experience in another college.
The team is even better balanced
than last year's. A light and heavy
man as forwards, a tall, heavy and
fairly fast mau at center, and a pair
of heavy guards, is the way the squad
evens up at present.
The 1923 team always faced the odds
by having two light men, Rogers and
McHose, at forwards. Both were clever
shooters when the ball was near the
basket, but neither were heavy enough
to rush the leather past the safety
guard and take the advantage of the
close shot. Ernie Nevers offsets this
handicap. He is a whirlwind dribbler;
he is fast, and his height makes a shot
easier when within close shooting dis
tance.
Three heavy men on the squad will
also tend to discourage any "rough
and tumble" style which an opposing
team might introduce.

The appointment office of Columbia
University has provided employment
for 2,357 students during the past year.
Out of this number 1,500 were men
whose tasks ranged from play acting
to detective work, and 857 women
were employed in work ranging from
stenographers to artists' models.
Pavilion doors will be thrown open tomorrow night at 8 o'clock for the first
scheduled basketball game of the season between Swede Righter's College
of the Pacific five and the Stanford quintet.
The probable line-up of the Cardinal court men will be: "Nip" McHose and
Ernie Nevers, forwards; Steele, center; Oliva and Mcßurney, guards.
Owing to a misunderstanding, the game was announced in last night's
Daily for tonight instead of tomorrow night.
Team Intact
Just what kind of a showing will be made by the Stanford aggregation is of
interest to more than a few. The scholarship ax landed lightly on the list
of basketball candidates last quarter, and Kerr still has the choice of men
who reported for practice after the football season. The choice is admittedly
small, but there are at least six or seven men who can be relied upon to
furnish the basic strength of the 1924 quintet.
It is difficult to judge any team turned out by Kerr early in the season.
The miracle that the football mentor performed with the gridiron material last
year, when Stanford's pigskin outlook was blackest, is an old story to
University students. But the fact still remains, and if Kerr can bolster up a

S>seemingly hopeless football team and
make one of the strongest showings
in years, there is no reason to doubt
that the Card coach can make a less
hopeless basketball situation seem
still less black.
