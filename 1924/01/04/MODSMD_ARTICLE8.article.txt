# COLLEGE OF PACIFIC OPENS CARD COURT SEASON TOMORROW
## Stanford Quintet Expected To Make Good Showing In Initial Game Against Righter's Tigers 
### 
Pavilion doors will be thrown open tomorrow night at 8 o'clock for the first
scheduled basketball game of the season between Swede Righter's College
of the Pacific five and the Stanford quintet.
The probable line-up of the Cardinal court men will be: "Nip" McHose and

Daily for tonight instead of tomorrow night.
Team Intact
Just what kind of a showing will be made by the Stanford aggregation is of
interest to more than a few. The scholarship ax landed lightly on the list
of basketball candidates last quarter, and Kerr still has the choice of men
who reported for practice after the football season. The choice is admittedly
small, but there are at least six or seven men who can be relied upon to
furnish the basic strength of the 1924 quintet.
It is difficult to judge any team turned out by Kerr early in the season.
The miracle that the football mentor performed with the gridiron material last
year, when Stanford's pigskin outlook was blackest, is an old story to
University students. But the fact still remains, and if Kerr can bolster up a

S>seemingly hopeless football team and
make one of the strongest showings
in years, there is no reason to doubt
that the Card coach can make a less
hopeless basketball situation seem
still less black.
Well Balanced Quintet
Fundamentally the basketball pros
pects are darker than last season. But
it will not take a miracle to develop
five men who can swing into action
favorably with any quintet on the
Pacific Coast. Four men are veteran
players, and one candidate has had
experience in another college.
The team is even better balanced
than last year's. A light and heavy
man as forwards, a tall, heavy and
