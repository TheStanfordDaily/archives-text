# CONDITIONS IMPROVING IN RUSSIA-MISS FRY
## 
### 
Although actual starvation is still
going on in some parts of Russia, con
ditions there are rapidly improving,
and it is possible that relief work will
no longer be necessary after next
summer.
This was the statement of Miss
Ruth Fry, field worker for the English
Society of Friends, speaking yester
day in the Little Theater. For the past
nine years, Miss Fry has been engaged
in relief work in France, Germany,
Poland, and Russia.
Relief Work Continues
"Relief work will be continued as
long as is necessary, certainly through
this winter," Miss Fry said in telling
of the work of the Quakers in the
war districts. The society at present
is active in Russia, Germany, and
Poland.
In every country the field agents
have been engaged in reconstruction
work, using mass feeding only as a
last resort, Miss Fry stated. "In spite
of the fact that famine conditions still
hold in a few districts, the Russian
government has very wisely put an
end to mass feeding, because of the
demoralizing effect on the people,"
she continued. "All efforts are to make
the people self-supporting, and both in
Russia and Poland the peasants have
recovered with remarkable speed."
Describes Evacuation Horrors
The speaker told of the horrors of
evacuation, and the disappointment to
the peasants of their homecoming,
when they returned to find their farm
lands either a flourishing young forest
or a desolation of shell-holes and
barbed wire entanglements. Typhus
and tuberculosis took thousands, she
said. Although typhus has been
brought under control, a new scourge
has come in the form of malaria, a
disease which the Friends are now
combating with some success.
Conditions Â»are worse in Germany
than in any other country, in the
opinion of Miss Fry. She spent several
weeks in the Ruhr district just before
sailing for the United States last fall.
German Conditions Bad
Miss Fry told of financial conditions
in Germany, emphasizing the hardship
worked on the salaried classes by the
fall of the mark. She pointed out that
the official quotations on the mark
has little to do with the actual rate
of exchange, and stated that notes of
less than a million marks face value
are practically useless.
"The average wage in the districts
I visited is sufficient to buy about
one and three-quarters pounds of meat
a day," the speaker said. "The average
wage in California will buy about forty
pounds."
Coal Shortage Serious
The shortage of coal is also serious,
according to Miss Fry. "It is practi
cally impossible to get fuel, and as a
result tuberculosis has been greatly
increased. To add to this, the hospi
tals are unable to keep open; many
are already closed. Even the insane
asylums are forced to send home those
not violently insane. The insurance
companies, as well as the towns and
the districts, are bankrupt."
General world conditions may only
be improved by a mental attitude of
the people, in the opinion of Miss Fry.

She pointed out that the Friends have
worked independently of any politi
cal considerations, and as a result
they are welcomed in any country.
"We may criticise; but that has noth
ing to do with aid. 'You don't get rid
of an enemy by killing him, but if
you help him you make him your
friend'."
"Forces of good will have never
been tried in international relations,"
she continued. "Without some change
in the mental attitude of the world,
I see little hope for the future. If you
will help alter the mental attitude of
America, the change will reach
Europe and help toward a change
there. It is only in this way that de
struction may be avoided."
