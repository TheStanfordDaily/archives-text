ALBERT F. KAHN, Architect
(Terms Drawn by Hugh Ferriss
the Colossal"
'"THE co-ordination of commercial strength, arch
x itectural vision and engineering skill which
created this titanic quadruple office building repre
sents the motive and creative force which has turned
the eyes of the world toward this type of American
architecture.
This, the largest office building in the world, pos
sesses fundamentally magnificent largeness in its
conception, and a clean-cut directness in its execu
tion which place it among the most significant of
American buildings.
With such existing structural achievements no arch
itectural future is impossible, no project too vast
or too complex to come readily to our imagination.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering
skill and organization, will prove more than equal
to the demands of the architecture of the future.
