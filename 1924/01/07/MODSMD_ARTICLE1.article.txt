# GRECIAN PLOT SELECTED FOR SPRING FIESTA
## Evelyn Brownell Is Author of Pageant Based on Two Classic Myths 
### 
The Grecian pageant plot submitted
by Evelyn Brownell has been chosen j
by the faculty-student committee for ,
presentation in the women's spring
Fiesta. Miss Brownell is a sophomore
and member of Chi Omega.
Eight Plots Submitted
All eight plots submitted were so
good, according to the committee, that
selection was difficult.
Besides the interest of the plot it-'
self, and its adaptability to the setting'
on the banks of Lagunita, such other
elements were considered as artistic
effects, opportunities for a large num
ber of dancers, and simplicity of ac
tion and stage appointments.
Action Based on Myths
Miss Brownell says the purpose of
her plot is to give the audience a
glimpse of the typical Grecian festival, j
This she has done through the pre
sentation of two Greek myths, in
which the true spirit and atmosphere ;
of ancient Greece may be found. She
consulted authorities on ancient
Greece and Greek mythology in order
that the plot and characters should
be authentically Grecian.
The plot may be produced on a
simple or elaborate scale and many
persons as desired. The cast is made |
lip of eight principal characters and
any number of Grecian priestesses, |
water sprites, satyrs, archers, shep-1
herds, and villagers who give both im
promptu and character dances.
Because the natural setting of Lagu-;
nita is ideal few stage properties are ,
necessary.
The character of the songs and
dances calls for a stringed orchestra.
Plans for Production
The date for the Fiesta has not yet
been decided.
Tryouts for the leading roles will be
held and every woman in the Univer
sity will have some part in the pageant
itself and in its production. There is
a great deal of work to be done on
the pageant before actual practice
commences. Music must be selected
and dances arranged. If songs iare
used, they must be written.
