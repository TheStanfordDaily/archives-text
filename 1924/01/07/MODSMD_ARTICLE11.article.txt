# CARDINAL POLO TEAMS BEGIN PRACTICE TODAY
## 
### 
I With the opening of the new year,
i the Stanford polo varsity will begin
i the biggest season in its history as
ian activity on the campus, according
to a statement made today by Captain
! Charles E. Boyle, coach of the local
i mallet swingers. The polo season in
California is just starting and Captain
Boyle is lining up a heavy schedule
for the Cards to face during the last
few weeks of the present quarter and
in the spring. The games will prob
ably commence with the close of the
winter rains.
Although the season is just begin
ning the local horsemen have been
working hard during the past three
months and have played twelve games
with polo teams of the Coast, winning
eleven of them by a decisive score.
The Cardinals won the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Polo Championship in
November when they defeated a team
representing the Oregon Agriculture
College.
Twenty men will report this after
noon for the first workout on the prac
tice field east of Encina hall. Included
in this number will be the four men
who played on the championship team.
Captain Otto Barby, who is considered
one of the strongest local players, will
take his old position at No. 1, after
an absence of two months because of

illness. Tremaine, Laub, Irwin, and
Ralph Barby are four more men who
will be back in the saddle.
It is expected that a challenge will
be sent to the University of Arizona
polo fo%r for a tournament to be
played at Stanford some time in the
spring. The Arizona team won the in
tercollegiate championship of the
Southwest recently at the annual mid
winter polo tournament held at San
Antonio, Texas. The southern team de
feated horsemen representing Colo
rado, Texas, Oklahoma, and New
Mexico.
Several games will be scheduled
with polo clubs on the coast and very
likely a series of contests will be
played with the Eleventh Infantry of
San Francisco.
