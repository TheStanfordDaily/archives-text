I. Enter the Permanent Court
That the United States adhere to
the Permanent Court of International
Justice for the reasons and under the

conditions stated by Secretary Hughes
and President Harding in February,
1923.
11. Cooperate With the League of
Nations, Without Full Membership
at Present.
That, without becoming a member of
the League of Nations as at present
constituted, the United States Govern
ment should extend its present co
operation with the League and pro
pose participation in the work o£ its
Assembly and Council under the fol
lowing conditions and reservations.
Safeguarding of Monroe Doctrine
1. The United States accepts the
League of Nations as an instrument
of mutual counsel, but it will as
sume no obligation to interfere with
political questions of policy or in
ternal administration of any foreign
state.
In uniting its efforts with those
of other States for the preservation
of peace and the promotion of the
common welfare, the United States
insists upon the safeguarding of the
Monroe Doctrine and does not aban
don its traditional attitude concern
ing American independence of the
Old World and does not consent to
submit its long-established policy
concerning questions regarded by
it as purely American to the recom
mendation or decision of other
Powers.
No Military or Economic Force
2. The only kind of compulsion which
nations can freely engage to apply
to each other in the name of Peace
is that which arises from confer
ence, from moral judgment, from
full publicity, and from the power
of public opinion.
The United States will assume no
obligations under Article X in its
present form, or under Article XVI
in its present form in the Covenant,
or in its amended form as now pro
posed, unless in any particular case
Congress has authorized such ac
tion.
The United States proposes that
Article X and XVI be either drop- 1
ped altogether or so amended and >
changed as to eliminate any sug
gestion of a general agreement to
use coercion for obtaining conform
ity to the pledges of the Covenant.!
No Obligations Under
Versailles Treaty
3. The United States will accept no
responsibilities under the Treaty of
Versailles unless in any particular
case Congress has authorized such
action.
League Open to All Nations
4. The United States Government
proposes that Article I of the Cov
enant be construed and applied, or,
if necessary, redrafted, so that ad
mission to the League shall be as
sured to any self-governing State
that wishes to join and that re
ceives the favorable vote of two
thirds of the Assembly.
Development of International Law
5. As a condition of its participation
in the work and counsels of the
League, the United States says that
the Assembly and Council consent
—or obtain authority—to begin col
laboration for the revision and de
velopment of international law, em
ploying for this purpose the aid of
a commission of jurists. This Com
mission would be directed to formu
late anew existing rules of the law
of nations, to reconcile divergent
opinions, to consider points hither
to inadequately provided for but
vital to the maintenance of interna
tional justice, and in general to de-

fine the social rights and duties of
States. The recommendations of the
Commission would be presented
from time to time, in proper form
for consideration, to the Assembly
as to a recommending if not a law
making body.
Final selection of the winner of the

even among those judging the awards,
knows the successful entrant whose
number is 1,469.
All publications in the country are
asked to aid in taking the referendum.
Ballots have been sent to Stanford
| and the referendum will be taken by
i Professor Graham 11. Stuart, of Politi
j cal Science department, in charge of
I the Stanford tally, with the aid and
I co-operation of the campus organiza-
I tions and the Daily Palo Alto.
The plan selected is as follows:
I. Enter the Permanent Court
That the United States adhere to
the Permanent Court of International
Justice for the reasons and under the

conditions stated by Secretary Hughes
and President Harding in February,
1923.
11. Cooperate With the League of
Nations, Without Full Membership
at Present.
That, without becoming a member of
the League of Nations as at present
constituted, the United States Govern
ment should extend its present co
operation with the League and pro
pose participation in the work o£ its
Assembly and Council under the fol
lowing conditions and reservations.
Safeguarding of Monroe Doctrine
1. The United States accepts the
League of Nations as an instrument
of mutual counsel, but it will as
sume no obligation to interfere with
political questions of policy or in
ternal administration of any foreign
state.
In uniting its efforts with those
of other States for the preservation
of peace and the promotion of the
common welfare, the United States
insists upon the safeguarding of the
Monroe Doctrine and does not aban
don its traditional attitude concern
ing American independence of the
Old World and does not consent to
submit its long-established policy
concerning questions regarded by
it as purely American to the recom
mendation or decision of other
Powers.
No Military or Economic Force
2. The only kind of compulsion which
nations can freely engage to apply
to each other in the name of Peace
is that which arises from confer
ence, from moral judgment, from
full publicity, and from the power
of public opinion.
The United States will assume no
obligations under Article X in its
present form, or under Article XVI
in its present form in the Covenant,
or in its amended form as now pro
posed, unless in any particular case
Congress has authorized such ac
tion.
The United States proposes that
Article X and XVI be either drop- 1
ped altogether or so amended and >
changed as to eliminate any sug
gestion of a general agreement to
use coercion for obtaining conform
ity to the pledges of the Covenant.!
No Obligations Under
Versailles Treaty
3. The United States will accept no
responsibilities under the Treaty of
Versailles unless in any particular
case Congress has authorized such
action.
League Open to All Nations
4. The United States Government
proposes that Article I of the Cov
enant be construed and applied, or,
if necessary, redrafted, so that ad
mission to the League shall be as
sured to any self-governing State
that wishes to join and that re
ceives the favorable vote of two
thirds of the Assembly.
Development of International Law
5. As a condition of its participation
in the work and counsels of the
League, the United States says that
the Assembly and Council consent
—or obtain authority—to begin col
laboration for the revision and de
velopment of international law, em
ploying for this purpose the aid of
a commission of jurists. This Com
mission would be directed to formu
late anew existing rules of the law
of nations, to reconcile divergent
opinions, to consider points hither
to inadequately provided for but
vital to the maintenance of interna
tional justice, and in general to de-

fine the social rights and duties of
States. The recommendations of the
Commission would be presented
from time to time, in proper form
for consideration, to the Assembly
as to a recommending if not a law
making body.
Final selection of the winner of the
Edward Bok Peace Prize has been
made by the Policy Committee from
22,165 plans submitted to the commit
tee and adjudged by the Jury of
Awards.
The author of the plan will remain
unknown until a referendum has been
taken among the people of the United
j States through the newspapers and
magazines. The referendum will de
i tennine whether or not the winner
will be awarded the second $50,000.
If the verdict of the people is favor
able, the total amount of $100,000 will
be given the winner. Only one person,
even among those judging the awards,
knows the successful entrant whose
number is 1,469.

conditions stated by Secretary Hughes
and President Harding in February,
1923.
11. Cooperate With the League of
Nations, Without Full Membership
at Present.
That, without becoming a member of
the League of Nations as at present
constituted, the United States Govern
ment should extend its present co
operation with the League and pro
pose participation in the work o£ its
Assembly and Council under the fol
lowing conditions and reservations.
Safeguarding of Monroe Doctrine
1. The United States accepts the
League of Nations as an instrument
of mutual counsel, but it will as
sume no obligation to interfere with
political questions of policy or in
ternal administration of any foreign
state.
In uniting its efforts with those
of other States for the preservation
of peace and the promotion of the
common welfare, the United States
insists upon the safeguarding of the
Monroe Doctrine and does not aban
don its traditional attitude concern
ing American independence of the
Old World and does not consent to
submit its long-established policy
concerning questions regarded by
it as purely American to the recom
mendation or decision of other
Powers.
No Military or Economic Force
2. The only kind of compulsion which
nations can freely engage to apply
to each other in the name of Peace
is that which arises from confer
ence, from moral judgment, from
full publicity, and from the power
of public opinion.
The United States will assume no
obligations under Article X in its
present form, or under Article XVI
in its present form in the Covenant,
or in its amended form as now pro
posed, unless in any particular case
Congress has authorized such ac
tion.
The United States proposes that
Article X and XVI be either drop- 1
ped altogether or so amended and >
changed as to eliminate any sug
gestion of a general agreement to
use coercion for obtaining conform
ity to the pledges of the Covenant.!
No Obligations Under
Versailles Treaty
3. The United States will accept no
responsibilities under the Treaty of
Versailles unless in any particular
case Congress has authorized such
action.
League Open to All Nations
4. The United States Government
proposes that Article I of the Cov
enant be construed and applied, or,
if necessary, redrafted, so that ad
mission to the League shall be as
sured to any self-governing State
that wishes to join and that re
ceives the favorable vote of two
thirds of the Assembly.
Development of International Law
5. As a condition of its participation
in the work and counsels of the
League, the United States says that
the Assembly and Council consent
—or obtain authority—to begin col
laboration for the revision and de
velopment of international law, em
ploying for this purpose the aid of
a commission of jurists. This Com
mission would be directed to formu
late anew existing rules of the law
of nations, to reconcile divergent
opinions, to consider points hither
to inadequately provided for but
vital to the maintenance of interna
tional justice, and in general to de-

fine the social rights and duties of
States. The recommendations of the
Commission would be presented
from time to time, in proper form
for consideration, to the Assembly
as to a recommending if not a law
making body.
Final selection of the winner of the
Edward Bok Peace Prize has been
made by the Policy Committee from
22,165 plans submitted to the commit
tee and adjudged by the Jury of
Awards.
The author of the plan will remain
unknown until a referendum has been
taken among the people of the United
j States through the newspapers and
magazines. The referendum will de
i tennine whether or not the winner
will be awarded the second $50,000.
If the verdict of the people is favor
able, the total amount of $100,000 will
be given the winner. Only one person,
even among those judging the awards,
knows the successful entrant whose
number is 1,469.
All publications in the country are
asked to aid in taking the referendum.
Ballots have been sent to Stanford
| and the referendum will be taken by
i Professor Graham 11. Stuart, of Politi
j cal Science department, in charge of
I the Stanford tally, with the aid and
I co-operation of the campus organiza-
I tions and the Daily Palo Alto.
The plan selected is as follows:
I. Enter the Permanent Court

the Permanent Court of International
Justice for the reasons and under the

conditions stated by Secretary Hughes
and President Harding in February,
1923.
