# CARD FIVE EASILY BEATS COLLEGE OF PACIFIC TEAM 38-9
## Tigers Offer Little Opposition For Cards In Opening Contest; Steele Stars For Stanford 
### David Meiklejohn 
With little opposition the Stanford varsity basketball team swamped
"Swede" Righter's College of the Pacific five under the convincing score of
38 to 9 in the pavilion last Saturday night.
More than 2,000 people saw the game.
Aside from being fairly interesting the game showed that Stanford at least
has the possibilities of becoming a strong scoring team in the future.
The opposition was not very strong; in fact it was pitifully weak. The
size of the score could not very well be said to indicate the strength of the
Cardinal quintet, rather to emphasize the weakness of the opponents. But
it brought out many bright spots, and trampled several murky predictions
into oblivion.
Nevers and Steele Star
Gurdon Steele and Ernie Nevers were two bright stars throughout the game.
Steele, playing for the second year on the varsity, and Nevers, for the first
time against college competition, showed exceptional possibilities. Both men

» played a heady and rushing game,
handled the hall easily, and dribbled
with some precision.
Nevers, especially, shows rare talent
in bouncing the ball along the spring
court, but his style is just a trifle too
hasty to warrant certainty.
Steele, on the other hand, awaits an
opening and dribbles easily within
scoring distance. It was Steele who,
in the second half, scored five straight
baskets, each following close on the
heels of the other. Nevers scored three
consecutive times in the second period
on two field goals and a foul.
McHose Consistent
It took "Nip" McHose several min
utes to get the ball going through the
basket, but even in this interval the
attempts were so close that the ball
rolled around the hoop and then fell
into the hands of a mixed melee of
players. "Nip" got going in the second
quarter when lie totalled nine points
with three field goals and three fouls.
The first Cardinal score came early
in the first quarter when the referee
called a foul on Westfield, Tiger cen
ter, and Gurdon Steele sank the free
throw for Stanford.
Nevers followed it up with a clean
goal from the floor, and Stanford took
a lead which was never headed.
Passing Effective
Righter's Tigers had difficulty in
penetrating the Card five-man de
fense. Invariably the Red Shirts took
the ball away from their slower op
ponents, and falling into a routine
passing offensive, usually Nevers to
Mcßurney to Steele, they advanced
the ball with a rush toward the Stan
ford basket. The passing was not all
that could be asked, but for an early
season game it was encouraging.
With Dave Oliva feeding the pass
ing combination of Nevers to Mcßur
ney to Steele, the big Card center
dropped the ball into the basket five
times in succession.
Then McHose began to score, and
Mcßurney advanced from defensive
territory to try a hand in the drive
and managed to mount the total with
a field goal. Nor was this the only
time in the game that Mcßurney dis
played prowess as a running safety.
He scored two points soon after his
first score, and repeated in the sec
ond half with a long shot from the
center of the floor.
Reserves Weak
The first half ended, 24 to 3, in
favor of the Cards. In the second
period the Tigers were able to add to
their total by six points, most of them
results of free throws. Kerr substi
tuted freely, and only two men on the
squad were left sitting on the bench.
The strength of the reserves was
clearly not on a par with the class dis
played by their team mates before
them.
Of the substitutes, perhaps those
deserving the most mention were
Harry Shipkey and Tom Alexander.
Shipkey was sent in for Mcßurney
late in the first half. Alexander re
placed Nevers both in the first and
second periods.
Passing and floor work will have to
be improved a great deal if the Cards
expect to make a strong showing
against the Olympic Club quintet,
which plays its flrst game of the sea
son in the pavilion next Saturday.
