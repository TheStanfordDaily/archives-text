# CARD FIVE EASILY BEATS COLLEGE OF PACIFIC TEAM 38-9
## Tigers Offer Little Opposition For Cards In Opening Contest; Steele Stars For Stanford 
### David Meiklejohn 
With little opposition the Stanford varsity basketball team swamped
"Swede" Righter's College of the Pacific five under the convincing score of
38 to 9 in the pavilion last Saturday night.
More than 2,000 people saw the game.
Aside from being fairly interesting the game showed that Stanford at least
has the possibilities of becoming a strong scoring team in the future.
The opposition was not very strong; in fact it was pitifully weak. The
size of the score could not very well be said to indicate the strength of the
Cardinal quintet, rather to emphasize the weakness of the opponents. But
it brought out many bright spots, and trampled several murky predictions
into oblivion.
Nevers and Steele Star
Gurdon Steele and Ernie Nevers were two bright stars throughout the game.
Steele, playing for the second year on the varsity, and Nevers, for the first
time against college competition, showed exceptional possibilities. Both men

» played a heady and rushing game,
handled the hall easily, and dribbled
with some precision.
Nevers, especially, shows rare talent
in bouncing the ball along the spring
court, but his style is just a trifle too
hasty to warrant certainty.
Steele, on the other hand, awaits an
opening and dribbles easily within
scoring distance. It was Steele who,
in the second half, scored five straight
baskets, each following close on the
heels of the other. Nevers scored three
consecutive times in the second period
on two field goals and a foul.
McHose Consistent
It took "Nip" McHose several min
utes to get the ball going through the
basket, but even in this interval the
attempts were so close that the ball
rolled around the hoop and then fell
into the hands of a mixed melee of
players. "Nip" got going in the second
quarter when lie totalled nine points
with three field goals and three fouls.
The first Cardinal score came early
in the first quarter when the referee
called a foul on Westfield, Tiger cen
ter, and Gurdon Steele sank the free
throw for Stanford.
Nevers followed it up with a clean
