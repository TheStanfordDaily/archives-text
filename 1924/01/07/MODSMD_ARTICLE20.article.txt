# Plan For World Pcace
## 
### 
Today there is presented for the consideration of the American public
the best practicable plan by which the United States may co-operate with
other nations for the prevention of war. This plan was selected from
22,165 by the jury of the Edward Bok Peace Award.
Stanford men and women, together with the members of other uni
versities, will be asked to vote on the merits of the winning plan in the
national referendum to be carried on shortly.
The plans, coming from every group in American life, whether from
life-long students of history and international law or from those unlearned
in these fields, expressed or implied the same conviction that nations must
frankly admit war as a crime and withdraw the moral and legal sanction
too long permitted to it as a means for settling international disputes.
Throughout the thousands of plans run three dominant currents:
Expressed in the words of Elihu Root, chairman of the jury of award,
"It is the unanimous hope of the jury that the first fruit of the mutual
counsel and co-operation among the nations which will result from the
adoption of the plan selected will be the general prohibition of the manu
facture and sale of all materials of war."
Secondly, there must be some machinery of co-operation among the
nations, open discussion of the real causes of the dispute being relied on to
make co-operation effective.
Finally, there must be some means of defining, recording, interpreting
and developing the law of nations.
The winning plan was considered as most effectively reflecting the
general trend of thought. It safeguards the Monroe Doctrine, requires the
revision and development of international law, and completely separates
the League from the Versailles treaty. These are definite steps in advance.
Inasmuch as this is a league of states the entrance of self-governing states
is assured, which probably would mean the admission of Germany which is
requisite for world unity.
In careful observance of former national discussions, the United
States is kept out of European entanglements by refusing to assume any
obligations to maintain the territorial integrity or political independence
of any foreign state.
The whole crux of the proposed plan is in the elimination of all mili
tary force and economic boycott in the maintenance of peace. Reliance is
made on conferences, moral judgment, publicity, and the power of public
opinion.
Military force might well be cast aside, but it seems objectionable to
remove also the power of an economic lx)ycott to bring an obstinate of
fender to terms.

The plans, coming from every group in American life, whether from
life-long students of history and international law or from those unlearned
in these fields, expressed or implied the same conviction that nations must
frankly admit war as a crime and withdraw the moral and legal sanction
too long permitted to it as a means for settling international disputes.
Throughout the thousands of plans run three dominant currents:
Expressed in the words of Elihu Root, chairman of the jury of award,
"It is the unanimous hope of the jury that the first fruit of the mutual
counsel and co-operation among the nations which will result from the
adoption of the plan selected will be the general prohibition of the manu
facture and sale of all materials of war."
Secondly, there must be some machinery of co-operation among the
nations, open discussion of the real causes of the dispute being relied on to
make co-operation effective.
Finally, there must be some means of defining, recording, interpreting
and developing the law of nations.
The winning plan was considered as most effectively reflecting the
general trend of thought. It safeguards the Monroe Doctrine, requires the
revision and development of international law, and completely separates
the League from the Versailles treaty. These are definite steps in advance.
Inasmuch as this is a league of states the entrance of self-governing states
is assured, which probably would mean the admission of Germany which is
requisite for world unity.
In careful observance of former national discussions, the United
States is kept out of European entanglements by refusing to assume any
obligations to maintain the territorial integrity or political independence
of any foreign state.
The whole crux of the proposed plan is in the elimination of all mili
tary force and economic boycott in the maintenance of peace. Reliance is
made on conferences, moral judgment, publicity, and the power of public
opinion.
Military force might well be cast aside, but it seems objectionable to
remove also the power of an economic lx)ycott to bring an obstinate of
fender to terms.
