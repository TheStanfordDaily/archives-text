# Standing Room Only

### 
Last night about 9:20, the writer of this editorial stood at the junction
of the Southern Pacific tracks and University Avenue in Palo Alto wait
ing for a street car. The usual Sunday night crowd, made up this time of
about fifty men and two women (un-escorted), was gathered.
The car arrived, already so full that many were standing. Did the
men stand back and wait for the women to board the car first? No!
There was a mad rush, in the midst of which the two women were caught,
hurried along and jostled as they might have been in a New York subway.
Finally, through sheer pluck, they managed to fight their way to the steps
and get on the car, which, by this time held twice as many people as it was
ever intended to hold.
Did any of the men in the car scramble to their feet, and offer the two
women seats? No! They sat still, these Stanford gents, and the women
stood as still as was possible in the crowded car.
The part that set the writer to thinking was the fact that the women
didn't seem to mind the occurrence. They neither seemed surprised nor
chagrined. Why? Because they have learned to expect just such treat
ment from a certain class of men who go to Stanford (not STANFORD
MEN.)
This incident is neither unique nor unusual. The same kind of thing
happens daily at the Library, Bookstore, and in classes. It is not every
man who forgets himself in this way; probably not even a majority of the
men do.
Maybe such things come as the result of thoughtlessness. It is to be
hoped that lack of "fetchin' up" is not the cause.
