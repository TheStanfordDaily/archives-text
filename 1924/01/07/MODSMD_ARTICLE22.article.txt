There is a belief in the minds of many students that the powers that at
present be are opposed to any store for the accommodation of the new
group of dormitories. That belief the Daily Palo Alto hopes to be mis
taken. Because of this hope the Daily is venturing to offer a scheme.
In the new dining halls back of Branner Hall there is a certain amount
of space for which no use has been provided. This space the Daily would
like to see utilized as a store run by the Board of Athletic Control (notably
in need of funds), for the benefit of students in Branner, Toyon, and En
cina Halls. Such a store, besides accommodating students who now re
sent I>eing forced to walk over to the Union at night, would net possibly
$3000 for the Board, which could be used in payments on the dormitory.
If such a plan is adopted, it is to be hoped that the employees in the store
will not have to work under the difficulty of poor facilities and indiffer
ence of management which has given rise to unjust criticism of the men be
hind the counter in the Union.
