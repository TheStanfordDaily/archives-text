ERNEST
Ernest is a serious student. He expects to win a high place in the engineering
profession through his industry, application, and sterling integrity. He is
taking a correspondence course in Memory Training and Will Power, because,
as he says, an aggressive yet pleasing personality is bound to command the
respect of any prospective employer. He also queens systematically, on alter
nate week-ends, because one is able in this way to acquire a certain social
polish. As he expresses it, "I shall be a leader in my community, and the
social standards of my townspeople will be set by my conduct. I must be
an example." When well established in his profession he intends to marry
an intelligent, though attractive woman who will assist him gracefully in
this matter of social leadership, where he feels, somehow, that his own
talents are not at their best. Ernest is careful not to become involved with
co-eds. In case one seems to be falling for him he tells her, gently but firmly,
being a man of honor, that his intentions are not serious. A certain ruthless
ness, he believes, is characteristic of great men. While he admits that he
may fail of greatness, he will be very much disappointed if he does, very
much disappointed. It is not certain that anyone else will be, however.

FRANK
Frank has a butterfly complex. He is afraid he will be taken for a
dry-bawl, since his bawl-out record points to Phi Beta Kappa. So he
engages loudly in activities, competes with the snakes, and goes in
quite emphatically for college clothes. His favorite quotation is from
Don Marquis:
"My mind is as frail as a lily,
It would break with the weight of a thought."
Maybe he's right at that. Grade points don't prove everything.
