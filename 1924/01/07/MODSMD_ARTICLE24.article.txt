# NEW REGULATION OF FACULTY REMOVES UNIT RESTRICTION
## 
### 
By a revision of faculty regulations

governing the amount of scholastic
work a student may carry at Stanford
during any one quarter, the Academic
Council of the University has made it
possible for students to gain their de
grees in less than the usual four years,
according to a bulletin issued by the
registrar today.
15 Hours Remains Average
Fifteen hours of work a week, spent
in recitations or lectures, is regarded
as an average amount for each quar
ter. For the first quarter in residence
at the University only 16 units may
count towards graduation. In case a
student has incurred a condition or a
failure during one quarter he may not
receive credit for more than 16 units
in the next quarter, while if his work
for three quarters falls below an aver
age of "B" he may take no more than
18 hours toward graduation.
The exceptions to the restrictions
given above are found in section 4 of
the new regulations, readings as fol
lows :
"Any student who has received
credit for at least 123 of the 180 units
required for graduation, and whose
previous record does not fall below a
C plus average may, upon application
to the Committee, be given permis
sion to undertake the completion of
"his work for the A.B. degree in three
quarters; if he has received credit for
140 units, in two quarters; if he has
received credit for 159 units, in one
quarter."
Thirteen-Hour Minimum
Thirteen hours remains as the mini
mum amount of work each quarter,
unless the student is doing outside
work for self support or is in poor
health, when special permission may
be granted by the Committee to take
fewer hours.

Two new professors have been added
to the Stanford faculty for this quarter.
George Philip Krapp is acting professor
of English for the winter and spring
quarters. Hugh McD. Clokie from Ox
ford and Harvard, and a resident of San
R&fael, will give a seminar course in the
Economics department.
