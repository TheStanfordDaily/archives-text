# INTRAMURAL SERIES BEGINS
## Five Games To Open Series; Each League Will Put Forward Strong Teams 
### 
Five games will begin Round I of
the University intramural basketball
series this afternoon. Beginning with
the El Toro-Sequoia clash at 4:15 in
Encina gymnasium, three contests will
be played in the afternoon and two
in the evening.
The scheduled games for today are
as follows:
Round I
Jan. 7 —El Toro vs. Sequoia II 4:15
Delta Upsilon vs. Inde
pendents 4:55
Chinese Club vs. Theta Xi 5:30
Kappa Alp'ia vs. Siga Nu7:3o
Sigma Chi vs. Encina, 4th 8:15
The entire list of teams has been
divided into seven leagues and a per
centage basis will be used in de
termining the winners of the leagues
and the University champion. The
schedule calls for one game a week
by each team, which gives plenty of
intervening time for practice.
Betas 1923 Champs
Beta Theta Pi won the champion
ship banner last year by defeating
Delta Tau Delta, 11-7, in a close game
which preceded the first Stanford-
California varsity clash in the pavil
ion. Previously, the winners of the six
leagues had been declared as follows:
Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, and Sigma Chi.
A few teams stand out in each
league, although it is certain that
there will be as many upsets this
year as usual. Delta Upsilon is about
as strong as last year and will give
the other five quintets in League 1 a
hard battle.

Strong Teams in League 2
In League 2, three teams appear as
possible winners. Sigma Chi has the
same five as last year; Sigma Nu looks
able to give its opponents a run; and
Phi Delta Theta will undoubtedly put
forward the same strong quintet that
represented it last year.
In League 3, Delta Chi and Beta
Theta Pi will probably fight it out in
the finals, although both are weaker
than a year ago, the former having
lost Tritle through graduation and the
latter Alabaster and Mannoccir to the
varsity.
League 4 Winner Doubtful
In League 4, Phi Kappa Sigma and
Phi Kappa Psi will probably give the
same exhibition, although the former
has lost Coen to the varsity squad.
Kappa Sigma appears at the pres
ent to be the only formidable team in
League 5.
Three aggregations will fight it out
in League 6 —Alpha Delta Phi, which
is somewhat weaker than last season;
Delta Tau Delta, with the same outfit
which put it in the finals last year;
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which also
will have practically the same team.
Halls Are Uncertain
In League 7, Alpha Sigma Phi will
probably put up a good bid.
Encina and have been
left out of the above forecast because,
in the case of the former, all are new
men and a line on prospects is diffi
cult; and, in regard to the latter, such
a large number from which to select
the two teams makes the matter again
difficult.

Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, and Sigma Chi.
A few teams stand out in each
league, although it is certain that
there will be as many upsets this
year as usual. Delta Upsilon is about
as strong as last year and will give
the other five quintets in League 1 a
hard battle.

Strong Teams in League 2
In League 2, three teams appear as
possible winners. Sigma Chi has the
same five as last year; Sigma Nu looks
able to give its opponents a run; and
Phi Delta Theta will undoubtedly put
forward the same strong quintet that
represented it last year.
In League 3, Delta Chi and Beta
Theta Pi will probably fight it out in
the finals, although both are weaker
than a year ago, the former having
lost Tritle through graduation and the
latter Alabaster and Mannoccir to the
varsity.
League 4 Winner Doubtful
In League 4, Phi Kappa Sigma and
Phi Kappa Psi will probably give the
same exhibition, although the former
has lost Coen to the varsity squad.
Kappa Sigma appears at the pres
ent to be the only formidable team in
League 5.
Three aggregations will fight it out
in League 6 —Alpha Delta Phi, which
is somewhat weaker than last season;
Delta Tau Delta, with the same outfit
which put it in the finals last year;
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which also
will have practically the same team.
Halls Are Uncertain
In League 7, Alpha Sigma Phi will
probably put up a good bid.
Encina and have been
left out of the above forecast because,
in the case of the former, all are new
men and a line on prospects is diffi
cult; and, in regard to the latter, such
a large number from which to select
the two teams makes the matter again
difficult.
Five games will begin Round I of
the University intramural basketball
series this afternoon. Beginning with
the El Toro-Sequoia clash at 4:15 in
Encina gymnasium, three contests will
be played in the afternoon and two
in the evening.
The scheduled games for today are
as follows:
Round I
Jan. 7 —El Toro vs. Sequoia II 4:15
Delta Upsilon vs. Inde
pendents 4:55
Chinese Club vs. Theta Xi 5:30
Kappa Alp'ia vs. Siga Nu7:3o
Sigma Chi vs. Encina, 4th 8:15
The entire list of teams has been
divided into seven leagues and a per
centage basis will be used in de
termining the winners of the leagues
and the University champion. The
schedule calls for one game a week
by each team, which gives plenty of
intervening time for practice.
Betas 1923 Champs
Beta Theta Pi won the champion
ship banner last year by defeating
Delta Tau Delta, 11-7, in a close game
which preceded the first Stanford-
California varsity clash in the pavil
ion. Previously, the winners of the six
leagues had been declared as follows:
Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Phi Kappa Psi, Delta Chi, Delta Tau
Delta, and Sigma Chi.
