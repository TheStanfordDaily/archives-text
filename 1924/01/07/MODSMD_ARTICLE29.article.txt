San Francisco Symphony Concert
The Overture to Rienzi, typically
Wagnerian, brought out the full power
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the fifth popular concert
yesterday.
The beautiful clarity and smooth
ness of playing of the string section
was shown in Tschaikowsky's An
dante, whose lovely melody is a gen
eral favorite.
It was a pleasure to have another
Wagner number on the program. Al
though the English Horn solo was not
particularly interesting in itself, it
was very well played by V. Schipilliti.
The Selections from the Damnation
of Faust and the Percy Grainger num
bers were, perhaps, the most enthusi
astically received. The lightness and
grace of the selections from Faust
were charming, and the Percy Grain
ger numbers were very satisfactory.
The orchestral arrangement of "Molly
on the Shore" is not as attractive as
the arrangement for quartette, but it
is always full of life and fun.
