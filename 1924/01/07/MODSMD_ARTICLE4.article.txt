# Coue Gains Convert As Little Old Lady Proves Theory True
## 
### 
Every evening for over two months
a little old lady had entered his street
car and invariably and painstakingly
chosen the same seat. Cheeks pink
from the cold, and buttoned closely,
she would look under the seats until
she found the one sought, and then
settle herself therein with an air of
utter contentment.
Although accustomed by long ex
perience to the little idosyncracies
found among any group of passengers,
the curiosity of the motorman finally
got the better of him, and one evening
he asked her, "Madam, would you
mind telling me just why you choose
that particular seat?"
"Because I like to put my feet 011
the heater under the seat in front of
it to keep them warm," she graciously
explained. "They get so cold other
wise."
The motorman looked at her puz
zled, then peered under the seat in
questionâ€”then grinned.
"I guess that proves there's some
thing in this auto-suggestion all right,"
he announced. "That's not a heater,
madam. It's the sandbox."
And Coue had gained another con
vert to greet his return to America!
