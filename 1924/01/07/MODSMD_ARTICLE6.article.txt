# Toyon Phone Signals Create Excitement
## 
### 
Mufflers are much in demand for
(he telephone buzzer system lately in*
; stalled in Toyon.
When one of the inmates gets a call
the private buzzer within his room
becomes a public nuisance and every
body in the hall wakes up long enough
to run around pushing buttons and
I answering dead telephones. If the for
tunate ono doesn't happen to be
around, all work ceases while the
whole hall is treated to a noise that
sounds like an army of barbers in ac
tion with the electric clippers.
A private buzzer that works like a
broadcasting station proved an eye
opener for the "first man." He was
aroused early one morning during va
' cation by its persistent vocal gyra
tions. To prevent its continuance, he
answered the call, thinking only that,
the workmen were playing or at most
testing out the system. But the call
was good and now everyone jumps to
the dashboard at the signal for fear
; of missing something.
