man hoopsters won from the Placer
Junior High School in the pavilion

14.
The game was the first that the
freshmen have played this season, and
their victory over the seasoned Au- j
burn players points to a successful
year.
At the start the game looked as if j
it would be a nip-and-tuck affair, but
the Babes gradually pulled away until
they had a comfortable margin.
With the score 6-1 for the Babes j
Hunt sent in a fresh five at the start
of the second period. The Placer men ;
had a little the edge over this team
and brought the score up to S-7 at the
end of the half. At the start of the
second period a foul shot enabled the j
high school team to tie things at 8-all, j
but from then on the freshman score
quickly piled up.
Southworth Good Sub

the bright lights for the freshman I
team. These men are exceptionally ac- :
curate shots and play a dazzling floor
game. Southworth, who went in as a
substitute forward, also showed good
form.
Jayred played a steady game at cen-
ter. He added two baskets to the total
with follow shots from under the bas
ket. Newhouse and Shipkey did good
work at guard. With the exception of
Southworth, none of the men who
went in as substitutes showed the
ability of the first five.
Price made the first score for the
Babes from the foul line about four
minutes after the game started, and
scored the second point a minute later
in the same way. Dyer of Placer made

made by Shipkey. David made a bas
ket from the floor as the quarter end
ed. Score 4-1.
Three Teams Used

Southworth got away for a score, and
then the Placer five started going.
Dyer and Dixon both made baskets.
Barnwell dribbled the length of the
floor, but was fouled when he tried to
shoot. He made both of the foul tries
and brought the score to 8-7 for the
Babes. The score remained the same
at the end of the half.

ed the second half and soon began
