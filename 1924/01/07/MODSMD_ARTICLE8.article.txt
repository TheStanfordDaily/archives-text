### 
Mary Fox Clark, a graduate student j
living at Madrona hall, was killed Sat
urday afternoon as a result of being
thrown from her horse while she was
riding with three other women from
Madrona on the Menlo-La Honda road.
Captain White, of the Menlo Rid
ing Academy, from whom Miss Clark
had obtained the horse, had ridden a
short way with her to show her the j
road. Miss Clark galloped ahead of
the rest of the party. Captain White j
called to her to warn her that she was [
coming to a paved cross-road. Either
she did not hear or could not stop the j
horse. The horse slipped on the pave- i
ment and Miss Clark was thrown for
ward on her head and the horse kicked j
her at the base of the skull.
A car which had been watching the
supposed race took Miss Clark to the
Peninsula hospital where she died a
few minutes later. The accident oc
curred between 5:30 and 6 o'clock.
