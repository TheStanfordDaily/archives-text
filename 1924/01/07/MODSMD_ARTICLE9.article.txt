Since everyone has now had time
to attend all his classes and get the
"lay of the land" for the new quarter's
work, the Administration building is
besieged by scores of wild-eyed, hat
less students who are bent on reno
vating their schedules.
Appalled by the first day's custom
ary outline of the quarter's work, the
frenzied students, with sinking hearts,
form mental resolutions for a quick
and terrible revenge upon those
friends who assured them of the ease
in which the course could be recon
noitered for at least a "B," without
even cracking a book.
And so it goes, with the first of
every quarter. These 'pipes" seem to
be elusive things.
