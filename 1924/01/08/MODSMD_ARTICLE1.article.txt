# MASQUERS CHOOSE "MILESTONES" AS WINTER OFFERING
## Comedy Drama of Bennett's Brings Unique Plot of Three Ages to Stage 
### 
"Milestones," a comedy drama by
Arnold Bennett and Edward Knob
lauch has been announced by Mas
quers as their annual play to be pro
duced 'about the first of February.
Because of the large number of
leading characters, tryouts are still in
progress. Final selections will be an
nounced tomorrow.
The conflict between youth and age
has never before been introduced
upon the stage in quite the same
tense, direct way that Mr. Bennett
presents it, and it is liis novel treat
ment that has given this very quiet
play an almost sensational quality.
Three Ages Portrayed
"Milestones" deals with three suc
cessive generations of youth, with its
enthusiasm, dreams and ideas com
ing up against the unimaginativeness
and fading mental visions of age.
Although the acts of the play are
twenty-five years apart, the playwrites
have preserved tjie dramatic unities
exceedingly well. While the dialogue
is simple and the lines commonplace,
the situations are dramatic, not in
themselves, but because one is inter
ested in the characters concerned in
them.
Age Versatility Required
It is in this novel situation that
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, expects
to get some real acting from the play
ers, besides affording the audience the
unusual spectacle of seeing nearly
the whole cast play three distinct
ages—youth, middle age, and senility.
"In most plays," says Davis, 'the
actors play only one part or age, and
often times they are chosen because
of some physical set-up, some natural
charm or some other little thing that
may fit them to the part. Physical ap
pearance is perhaps one of the most
important items in an actor's make-up
when he is chosen for a part in most
plays. However, due to the fact that
nearly every player is required to play
three widely different ages we have
had to take special care in selecting
the main characters for 'Milestones.'
We ought to get some real acting."
