Culver Pleased With System
Dean Culver states that he is
pleased with the sponsor system be
cause he feels that the small number
of freshman flunk-outs this quarter,
namely, twelve, compared with forty
last quarter, are due in part to the
sponsor system. He also believes that
the freshman athletic victories can
be attributed in a considerable degree
to the spirit which the freshmen gain
from association in the hall.
