# INTRAMURAL FIVES SHOW TEAM WORK FIRST DAY OF PLAY
## 
### 
A good showing of team-work mark
ed the firwt day of intramural basket
ball yesterday, and only one default
lfiarred the card of five games. El
Toro, Delta Upsilon, Tlieta Xi, Sigma
Chi, and Kappa Alpha carried off the
initial victories of the season, the lat
ter by default of the Sigma Nu team.
Time out was taken frequently on
account of the poor condition of some
men and a number of fouls were called
for roughness.
El Toro and Sequoia began the day's
play with a fairly fast game of basket
ball. The first half was even as far as
scoring, the count being 4-4, but El
Toro was able to keep the ball in
Sequoia territory most of the time.
Clifford, for El Toro, made the four
counts.
In the second half, on two lucky
shots by Ludeke —one on a tip-off near
the basket and the other a one-handed
throw —El Toro took the lead and held
it to the end, winning 10 to 8. May,
Strong, Cooper, and Brown each
scored two points for Sequoia 11.
The Delta ITpsilon-Independents
game started at a fast clip but the
men were forced to slow the pace for
lack of wind after a few minutes of
play. Hyland made the first Delta
Upsilon score at the start and Hub
bard, substituting for Coverly at
guard, accounted for the second two
points on the half.
Hyland and Atwill, for Delta Upsi
lon, formed a combination which kept
the Independents fighting for the ball
under their own basket most of the
time. The half ended 4-2 with the fra
ternity men in the lead.
Beginning the second half, the Inde
pendents took a lead of one point
when Acheson tossed in a free throw
and followed with a short shot for
two points. Later, however, Hyland
and Atwill made a Delta Upsilon lead
of three points, and Hyland, near the
end of the half, tossed in another field
goal—ending the game 12-5.
Van Vorhis injured his nose at the
first of the Theta Xi-Chinese Club
contest and Porterfield was substi
tuted. The game started with a rush
but the Chinese fumbled often and
Ashley scored first for Theta Xi.
For the rest of the half, the ball
was repeatedly in the- Club territory
through the fast work of Porterfield
and Mulchay. Sail, for the Chinese,
scored four points on lucky long shots
near the end of the half which ended
12-4 after a streak of basket-shooting
on the part of Theta Xi. The heavier

Theta Xi players wore out their small
er opponents in the second half and
won, 24 to 6.
Sigma Nu defaulted to Kappa Alpha.
Sigma Chi, in their win of 14-4 over
Encina, fourth floor, scored six points
within two minutes of the opening
whistle. With practically the same
five as last year, they managed to
keep the ball in Encina, 4th, territory
most of the time. The latter, not hav
ing practiced together, were unable to
penetrate the Sigma Chi defense often.
Through the able efforts of Tim
mons, Sigma Chi forward, they fin
ished the half, leading 9-1.
The second period was merely a
repetition of the first with the ball
near the Encina basket most of the
time, and Sigma Chi won, 14-4. Tre
maine at center, Krogness at forward,
and Dryen at guard seconded Tim
mons in his offensive work in Encina
territory.

The second period was merely a
repetition of the first with the ball
near the Encina basket most of the
time, and Sigma Chi won, 14-4. Tre
maine at center, Krogness at forward,
and Dryen at guard seconded Tim
mons in his offensive work in Encina
territory.
A good showing of team-work mark
ed the firwt day of intramural basket
ball yesterday, and only one default
lfiarred the card of five games. El
Toro, Delta Upsilon, Tlieta Xi, Sigma
Chi, and Kappa Alpha carried off the
initial victories of the season, the lat
ter by default of the Sigma Nu team.
Time out was taken frequently on
account of the poor condition of some
men and a number of fouls were called
for roughness.
El Toro and Sequoia began the day's
play with a fairly fast game of basket
ball. The first half was even as far as
scoring, the count being 4-4, but El
Toro was able to keep the ball in
Sequoia territory most of the time.
Clifford, for El Toro, made the four
counts.
In the second half, on two lucky
shots by Ludeke —one on a tip-off near
the basket and the other a one-handed
throw —El Toro took the lead and held
it to the end, winning 10 to 8. May,
Strong, Cooper, and Brown each
scored two points for Sequoia 11.
The Delta ITpsilon-Independents
game started at a fast clip but the
men were forced to slow the pace for
lack of wind after a few minutes of
play. Hyland made the first Delta
Upsilon score at the start and Hub
bard, substituting for Coverly at
guard, accounted for the second two
points on the half.
Hyland and Atwill, for Delta Upsi
lon, formed a combination which kept
the Independents fighting for the ball
under their own basket most of the
time. The half ended 4-2 with the fra
ternity men in the lead.
Beginning the second half, the Inde
pendents took a lead of one point
when Acheson tossed in a free throw
and followed with a short shot for
two points. Later, however, Hyland
and Atwill made a Delta Upsilon lead
of three points, and Hyland, near the
end of the half, tossed in another field
goal—ending the game 12-5.
Van Vorhis injured his nose at the
first of the Theta Xi-Chinese Club
contest and Porterfield was substi
tuted. The game started with a rush
but the Chinese fumbled often and
Ashley scored first for Theta Xi.
For the rest of the half, the ball
was repeatedly in the- Club territory
through the fast work of Porterfield
and Mulchay. Sail, for the Chinese,
scored four points on lucky long shots
near the end of the half which ended
12-4 after a streak of basket-shooting
on the part of Theta Xi. The heavier

Theta Xi players wore out their small
er opponents in the second half and
won, 24 to 6.
Sigma Nu defaulted to Kappa Alpha.
Sigma Chi, in their win of 14-4 over
Encina, fourth floor, scored six points
within two minutes of the opening
whistle. With practically the same
five as last year, they managed to
keep the ball in Encina, 4th, territory
most of the time. The latter, not hav
ing practiced together, were unable to
penetrate the Sigma Chi defense often.
Through the able efforts of Tim
mons, Sigma Chi forward, they fin
ished the half, leading 9-1.
