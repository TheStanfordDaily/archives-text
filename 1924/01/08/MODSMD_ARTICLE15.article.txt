# FORTY APPEAR FOR FIRST PRACTICE OF BASEBALL SEASON
## Eight Varsity Players Report For Initial Workout Under Wolter 
### 
Baseball season started out in full
swing yesterday afternoon, when over
| forty players reported to Coach Harry
Wolter for the first workout of the
; quarter.
Captain Patterson took charge of
the candidates late in the afternoon.
| Seven other varsity players, besides
the captain, also reported, including:
Robertson, Mulchay, Johnston, Mc-
Candless, Cuddeback, Lawson, and
Teague.
Pitchers Fail to Appear
Members of the varsity pitching
staff of last year failed to put in an
appearance, but they are expected to
report early in the week. Teague was
the only regular hurler on the field.
The loss of Lefty May and Dick
Lawson will force Wolter to change
his plans concerning the outfield to a
( considerable degree. There is plenty
i of outfield material on hand, however,
and if Fuller and McCandless perform
as expected, only one member will be
I needed to fill in the gap. As there is
I a preponderance of infield material
Wolter might shift some heavy hitter
from this department to the outer gar
dens.
The first date on the schedule as an
nounced yesterday calls for a game on
! February 2 with the Olympic Club.

i fore that period.
