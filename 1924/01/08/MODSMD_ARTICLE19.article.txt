# Proof Of The Pudding
## 
### 
To those people who looked upon the radical changes involved in
adoption of the sponsor system with some doubt and trembling as to its
practicability, the result of the first quarter under the new plan should
give rise to equal parts of pleasure and surprise.
The scholarship record of the freshmen in the autumn quarter, higher
than ever before, is the final test on the plan of allowing new men to
develop through supervision instead of by coercion methods. The fact
that only a dozen new students were dropped by the scholarship com
mittee —a record lower than ever before—combined with such things as
bonfires, football victories, and the progress of self-government in Encina
hall, gives proof that sponsor control is as effective as its advocates
would have had us believe last October.
