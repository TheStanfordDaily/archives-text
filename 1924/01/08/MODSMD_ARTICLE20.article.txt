# How High Is The Student

### 
There is a myth, as hallowed as any of the "traditions" which clutter
the Farm, that a "Stanford gent" may not attend organ recitals, lectures,
or concerts, because of some vague stigma of indignity attached to esthetic
appreciation.
Like most traditions, it is important only in the minds of those who al
low themselves to be cheated out of pleasure because of blind adherence to
its precepts.
An example of how much influence the idea really has was given the
other night in Toyon hall. A man came into the lobby with a friend, and
sat down at the piano, which had previously been jangling out jazz.
lie started to play, with considerable technique and feeling, "high
brow" pieces, including such well-known classics as "Polonaise," Rach
maninoff's Prelude in G minor, and others.
When he had finished his repertoire at the end of an hour a crowd of
a dozen had gathered around the piano. An athlete, an engineer, a busi
ness manager, an economics major, and a graduate student were included.
Many of the unexpected audience did not know the names of the
pieces, more did not understand any of the technical methods of apprecia
tion, but all were so insistent on encores that the concert lasted almost
another hour.
When the artist again ran out of pieces the Stanford gents reluctantly
departed, not in the least abashed that they had shown considerable more
elevation of brow than is consistent with the semester shirt tradition.

Two officers in San Pedro recently came upon what appeared to I>e a
radical meeting, with a man on a soap-box violently denouncing the gov
ernment. He was arrested for seditious utterances.
In court it developed that the "seditious utterances" were excerpts
from the Declaration of Independence.
Upton Sinclair is now out of jail, but the incident was an ample proof
of how easy it sometimes is to make an agitator's lfving by publication of
the half-truths contained in abridged quotations from speeches and letters
in which no inkling is given of the context or circumstances.
