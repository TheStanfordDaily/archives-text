# THE 						AISLE SEAT

### 
The debut of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.,
in "Stephen Steps Out," now showing
at the Varsity theater, marks the first
venture of movie producers in the use
of seventeen-year-old actors. With
Jackie Coogan pre-eminent among the
child prodigies and with Wesley Barry
and Spec O'Donnell portraying emo
tions of the young incorrigibles in the
early teens, the only gap between the
natal hour of mankind and the juve
nile lead period which has been hith
erto undeveloped by producers is
downy-chinned youth as found in the
preparatory school. Young Fairbanks
breaks through into the promised land
with a very entertaining offering.
Strangely enough, the picture is not
over acted in any way. Fairbanks' con
duct is exemplary. If there is any

thing wrong with the picture It is tho
fault of the man who cemented the
incidents into the alleged plot, and
there is but little variance from speci
fications in that.
The story has to do with the diffi
culties a prep-school youth has with
budgeting his time between pranks
and Turkish history. The history suf
fers horribly and when the diploma is
forfeited as a result, the frightfully
wealthy father of the lad sends him
and a tutor to the summer capito of
that country to learn the stuff. The
boot-licking trustees fire the profes
sor who has affronted tho money god,
as is not inconceivable, and after a
certain amount of acrobatic effort,
which is not yet as effective as the
elder Fairbanks', the young hero
straightens things out for the old pe
dant. . â€”H. R.
