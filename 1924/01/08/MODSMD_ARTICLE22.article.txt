MA & PA'S CHRISTMAS
A Simple Drama of Life

yuletide fire. Kettle singing the "Christmas Noel" in the hearth but
hearth itself quiet.
Time —Christmas Eve.
Characters —Ma

Sheriff
Scene y, Act 1. (Pa discovered reading Bible. Ma knitting industriously on
a sock. Pa lays aside Bible with little gesture of impatience).
Pa: What time is it, Ma?
Ma: Half past eleven. (Heaves tremendous sigh, and after quieting
cat, lays aside sock.) In half an hour, the sheriff will be here to
take our little home away from us and turn us out into the cold,
cold street. (Business of shuddering, and gazing fondly about
their little love nest.)
Pa: I hate to see the old homestead go.
Ma: (Tremulously, and watching Paoofu f of the corner of her eye.)
Me too. I wish Josl would come home. I wonder if he has
succeeded in the cruel city. If he

woman! Don't ever speak the name of your son in my house
again. (Falls into paroxysm on the floor and bites a leg off the
dining room table.) He shall never cross my threshold again.
Ma: (Persistently.) Just the same I know my Joel will come yet, and
pay off the mortgage, and maybe buy me a new black silk dress.
(Dodges stove lid hurled by Pa, and just then door opens and
Sheriff enters in a pair of black whiskers and a cloud of snow
flakes.)
Sheriff: Ah ha! Have you got the money?
Pa: No.
Sheriff: 'Swell. Out you go then.
Pa: (Trying to bluff him.) Not much. On a stormy night like this? j
You must be crazy.
Sheriff: Don't get fresh, or I'll sock you one. (Laughs in approved villain
ous fashion.)
(Pa and Ma realize there is no hope in thwarting the relentless sheriff,
and sadly go to get their toothbrushes. Suddenly Pa make%a dive for the
sheriff, and jerks off his whiskers.)
Pa: (Cries exultantly) These whiskers are false! You're not going
to throw us out, you big piece of cheese. (Then recognition
dawns in his face, and he reels weakly against the wall.) Why—

But here we feel we should stop, dear reader. We don't want you to know
the whole story, because we feel that would only spoil it for you. Was
the be-whiskered villain their long-lost son back from the city with his
pockets stuffed full of ten-dollar bills, and masquerading as the sheriff
just to surprise the old folks? Or was it someone else?
Just in the way o* a hint, you know, we might tip you off that it wasn't
the long-lost son as you might suppose. As a matter of fact, it was the
sheriff after all. He had lost his earmuffs, and had borrowed the whiskers
to keep his ears warm.
As an afterthought, we might add also, that the son never did show up to
this day. The old couple were turned out the snow, and were found
the next morning by the milkman. They were clasped in each other's
arms, frozen stiff, with a picture of their son between them, also stiff.
