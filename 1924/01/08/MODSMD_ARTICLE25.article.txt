Hanging on the back of a street car j
after the fashion of the campus
"rough" riders, she rode from the j
Roble station past the Union and
bookstore down the long track to Palo
Alto, past the brilliantly-lighted busi
ness district, and out to the end of the !
line somewhere near Runnymede. But
this lady, having the finer moral sensi- !
*
bilities than her corduroyed, unshaven
brother, paid her fare first.
Her name is a secret, as is also the
particular night last week and the
time of the night; yet she alleges it 1
was done in honorable satisfaction of:
a bet made in a moment of madness j
and carried out with courage.
The motorman supposes that many
campus women will be losing similar
bets often this spring, and repeats the
instructions which he gave the initial j
daring "co-ed" —That the railway com
pany assumes no responsibility for
accidents that might occur as the re
sult of riding on the back steps.
