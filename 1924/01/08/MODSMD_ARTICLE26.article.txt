# ALLIGATOR HUNT DESCRIBED
## Student Tells How Party Of Hunters Killed Reptiles In Florida Everglades 
### 
How a party of four students killed
and skinned seven full-grown alliga
tors and captured three small ones
alive in the everglades of Lake Wash
ington, thirteen miles back from Eau
Gallie, Florida, is the story told by
Oscar Paine, a junior at Stanford.
Lake Washnigton does not have
what is ordinarily termed ji "shore,"
since the marshland along the edges
suddenly drops off into deep water. It
is where the growth of the palmettos
becomes thinner, and the trellas of
the lake with occasional sand banks
begin, that alligators are found.
'Gators Found by "Shining"
"After cooking supper and making
our bunks, we decided to 'shine' 'ga- (
tors. Our party was divided into two
boats. One fellow in each boat poled
it'through the swamps. The other cast
the 'flare' —a bunch of pine knots burn
ing in an oil can.
"We had been making our way slow
ly through the marsh for some time
when our flares finally shined some |
'gators. Taking the 'pikes'—instru-!
ments with long nine-foot wooden han
dles and a blade with four or five (
prongs on it —we stepped to the front I
of our boats, and threw them. From
the noise and splashing, it sounded as
if a submarine were taking water. The
'gator gave a weird grunt and hissed.
Two more drives and we had him.
Throwing a rope around his head, we
pulled him on to a sand bank to be
skinned the next morning.
Discover Reptiles' Nest
"Shortly after we sighted our next
'gator, it disappeared beneath the sur
face of the water. We thought we
were near a nest of the reptiles, so
out into the water we went. We again
spotted the 'gator, and after a bit
of prodding, one of the fellows piked
her. She came $o the surface like a

water hog, thrashing, grunting, and
splashing. We shot her."
The party then noticed a nauseating
odor, and on close investigation, dis
covered that the last 'gator killed had
come out of a nest —the odor was from
numerous fish which had been caught
as food for the baby reptiles. The
small 'gators were frantically swim
ming around in the nest trying to
escape. "After tying the mother 'gator,
and throwing the trio of little ones
into our boats to take back to camp,
we quit for the niglit.
Rifles Bring Better Success
"The next morning we skinned our
reptiles—three of them—since the
other boat also got one.
"About noon, we set out to try to
shoot a few, since this method is much
safer and surer. In the middle of the
day the 'gators usually sun themselves
on the sand banks. At the first bank
we sighted, we we»e too anxious, and
before we could get a shot at any
of the reptiles, like big black logs, they
slipped off into the deep water.
"On the next bank that we came
to, there were six on the sand asleep.
We drifted as as possible, each
picked out a reptile, and using a 30
calibre U. S. Springfield rifle, aimed
for the 'gator's head. We got four, but
the largest—the bull of the bunch —
slipped over the edge of the bank and
into the water, wounded. And a
wounded 'gator is rather a ticklish
proposition, and so we immediately
left that part of the swampland with
a reptile apiece."
All in all, the party killed seven
'gators which they skinned, and cap
tured alive three small ones. The
largest reptile killed weighed 350
pounds—and that isn't a " 'gator"
story, either.

out into the water we went. We again
spotted the 'gator, and after a bit
of prodding, one of the fellows piked
her. She came $o the surface like a

water hog, thrashing, grunting, and
splashing. We shot her."
The party then noticed a nauseating
odor, and on close investigation, dis
covered that the last 'gator killed had
come out of a nest —the odor was from
numerous fish which had been caught
as food for the baby reptiles. The
small 'gators were frantically swim
ming around in the nest trying to
escape. "After tying the mother 'gator,
and throwing the trio of little ones
into our boats to take back to camp,
we quit for the niglit.

"The next morning we skinned our
reptiles—three of them—since the
other boat also got one.
"About noon, we set out to try to
shoot a few, since this method is much
safer and surer. In the middle of the
day the 'gators usually sun themselves
on the sand banks. At the first bank
we sighted, we we»e too anxious, and
before we could get a shot at any
of the reptiles, like big black logs, they
slipped off into the deep water.
"On the next bank that we came
to, there were six on the sand asleep.
We drifted as as possible, each
picked out a reptile, and using a 30
calibre U. S. Springfield rifle, aimed
for the 'gator's head. We got four, but
the largest—the bull of the bunch —
slipped over the edge of the bank and
into the water, wounded. And a
wounded 'gator is rather a ticklish
proposition, and so we immediately
left that part of the swampland with
a reptile apiece."
All in all, the party killed seven
'gators which they skinned, and cap
tured alive three small ones. The
largest reptile killed weighed 350
pounds—and that isn't a " 'gator"
story, either.

How a party of four students killed
and skinned seven full-grown alliga
tors and captured three small ones
alive in the everglades of Lake Wash
ington, thirteen miles back from Eau
Gallie, Florida, is the story told by
Oscar Paine, a junior at Stanford.
Lake Washnigton does not have
what is ordinarily termed ji "shore,"
since the marshland along the edges
suddenly drops off into deep water. It
is where the growth of the palmettos
becomes thinner, and the trellas of
the lake with occasional sand banks
begin, that alligators are found.
'Gators Found by "Shining"
"After cooking supper and making
our bunks, we decided to 'shine' 'ga- (
tors. Our party was divided into two
boats. One fellow in each boat poled
it'through the swamps. The other cast
the 'flare' —a bunch of pine knots burn
ing in an oil can.
"We had been making our way slow
ly through the marsh for some time
when our flares finally shined some |
'gators. Taking the 'pikes'—instru-!
ments with long nine-foot wooden han
dles and a blade with four or five (
prongs on it —we stepped to the front I
of our boats, and threw them. From
the noise and splashing, it sounded as
if a submarine were taking water. The
'gator gave a weird grunt and hissed.
Two more drives and we had him.
Throwing a rope around his head, we
pulled him on to a sand bank to be
skinned the next morning.
