# TRAGO REPRESENTS STANFORD IN GREEK LETTER CONFERENCE
## Alabaster New Conference Secretary; Rushing Rules Modified 
### 
At a meeting of the Interfraternity
Council last night, President Gene
Trago gave a report of his recent trip
to New York City, where he attended
the National Interfraternity Confer
ence held at the Hotel Pennsylvania
from November 30th to December Ist.
Lewis Alabaster was elected secre
tary of the council to succeed Russell
Langford who did not return to col
lege this quarter.
The rushing rules were thoroughly
gone over, and one change was an
nounced in the existing regulations.
This new ruling allows fraternity men
to enter Encina Hall and visit fresh
men there anytime during regular
rushing hours. At all other times they
are strictly forbidden to enter the hall
except through special permission
from one of the sponsors.
According to President Trago, the
meeting of the National Interfraternity
Conference was the largest ever held.
A total of 372 were in attendance,
representing 87 institutions of learn
ing throughout the entire country.
Stanford and the Oregon Agricultural
College were the only colleges west of
lowa to be present at the conference.
National Council Organized
One of the most important features
of the conference was the founding of
a new organization to be known in
the future as the National Undergradu
ate Interfraternity Council. This or
ganization was conceived by the un
dergraduates who were attending the
conference on the invitation of the
National Interfraternity Conference,
which is a graduate body.
The undergraduates who were in in
formal attendance of the national con
ference for the first time, decided to
organize within themselves, and to
work in conjunction with the national
conference. A committee of three was
appointed, of which Trago was a mem
ber, to draw up a plan of permanent
organization for the proposed council.
This plan was adopted by the under
graduates, approved by the national
conference, and is now a permanent
organization. It meets two days previ
ous to the meeting of the regular na
tional conference. It discusses com
mon problems and subjects and sub
mits such proposals as it may deem
advisable for consideration of the
regular graduate body of the National
Interfraternity Conference.
The National Interfraternity Confer
ence will in turn keep in close touch
with the individual interfraternity
councils at the various schools; advise
them on local problems; submit nation
al data of general fraternity value and
in general assist the local organiza
tions in every way possible.
Stanford Praised
At the visitation officer's dinner, at
which the subject of college interfra
ternity councils was discussed, the sys
tem now at use at Stanford was point
ed out exclusively and met with gen
eral commendation. The present sys
tem at Stanford calls for undergradu
ate control through the Board of Con
trol which has included within its
membership five undergraduates sit
ting with two faculty members, two
alumni, and the Dean of Men who has
no vote. The Board of Control has
legislative and disciplinary powers.
This plan was regarded so favorably
that the University of Michigan and
also Ohio are taking steps to adopt it
almost word for word.
New Fraternities Created
Due to the enormous increase in
college enrollment following the war,
the conference thought it wise to
create at least one new national fra
ternity in order to extend to more
college men the advantage of a na
; tional organization. Invitations were
j issued to 000 local fraternities through
out the United States to send repre
! sentatives to a special conference of
i locals, held concurrently with the
Interfraternity Conference. Delegates
; from seventy-seven local fraternities
; responded.
On the last day of the conference,
twelve locals, acting entirely on their
own volition, created a new national
fraternity to be known as Phi Kappa
Pi. Membership at the outset of this
new fraternity will number over 300'.
Theta Nu Epsilon Recognized
Theta Nu Epsilon, hitherto regarded
as antagonistic to Greek Letter fra
ternities and not recognized by them,
is at the present time undergoing a
thorough renovation. At a conference
in Philadelphia last summer, the fra
ternity was entirely re-organized, the
ritual re-written, and every step taken
to eliminate the old reputation of the
organization and make it into a legiti
mate national fraternity. At present
there are ten recognized chapters and
the fraternity is making rapid strides
towards recovery.
Coincident to the reorganization of
Theta Nu Epsilon, the conference
made formal resolutions of displeasure
against Kappa Beta Phi and the Ku
Klux Klan, both of which are con
sidered as antagonistic to legitimate
Greek-letter fraternities. In regard to
the latter organization, Dean Thomas
Arkle Clark, who is the educational
advisor of the Interfraternity Confer
ence, made the following statement:
"The Ku Klux Klan, whatever may be
said for or against it, is gaining a
rapid foothold in our colleges and is
entitled to some serious considera
tion." In this connection, it was recom
mended to all members of the confer-1
ence that it prohibit membership in
Kappa Beta Phi or the Ku Klux Klan
to regular members of a Greek-letter
fraternity.
