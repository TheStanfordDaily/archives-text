# NEGRO DIALECT IS LECTURE TOPIC OF PROFESSOR KRAPP
## Language Authority Declares American Freedom Cause Of Slang Expressions 
### 
That American slang has its his
torical counterpart in the language of
the Elizabethan age, is one of the
interesting facts noted by Professor
G. P. Krapp, visiting professor of Eng
lish from Columbia university, in his
study of modern American language.
Professor Krapp will lecture this eve
ning at 7:30 in the Assembly hall on
the subject of Negro dialect.
In his lecture, Professor Krapp will
attempt to show that the language
spoken by the negroes is pure, but
otherwise obsolete English.
"There is no trace of any foreign
language in America, except for a few
isolated words," he declares. "Ameri
can English is a traditional survival
of an older English. The differences
between our language and that spoken
in England are due to the fact that of
the older forms retained here, many
have been lost in the mother country,
while our speech has dropped forms
retained in England."
Slang Develops -in Time of Freedom
Elizabethan slang developed in the
sporting life of London, in a time of
great freedom of thought and action.
American slang hegan about 1830, with
the spread-eagle period, when people
were feeling large-minded and were
developing an expansive national spirit.
This state of mind combined with a
humorous and rough-and-ready atti
tude, is necessary to the development
of slang, is Professor Krapp's opinion.
What will become of slang is a
question with which he is concerned.
As soon as notably differentiated
groups disappear, highly-colored slang
goes. The use of sland is more appar
ent in the West than in the East, and
with the passing of the old picturesque
frontier life and sectional isolation,
colloquial phrases are rapidly being
lost, says Professor Krapp.
Slang Does Not Affect Language
Very few slang words survive more
than a few years, and the real lang
uage of America is little affected by
them, he believes. British slang is less
picturesque than American, because
the English have a more conservative
feeling for the use of the language.
But in cultivated society there is no
noticeable difference in speech among
the different sections, or between the
two countries.
