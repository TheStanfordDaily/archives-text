There are a number of things entering into
the filling of prescriptions, the most important
of which are:
1 —Accuracy.
2—Purity of drugs.
3—Promptness.
4—Courtesy.
Much of our reputation as "dependable drug
gists" is due to our being our own hard task
masters on these four essential things.
Your drug needs are safe in our hands.
You may depend on us.
