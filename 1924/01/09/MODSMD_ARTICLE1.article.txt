# WINGED '0' CLUB QUINTET MEETS CARDS SATURDAY
## Lauterwasser Will Be Most Formidable Scorer on Olympic Machine 
### 
Olympic Club warriors will open j
their 1924 basketball schedule against \
the Stanford varsity in the pavilion
next Saturday night.
The Winged "O" aggregation is after |
revenge. For three consecutive years 1
Stanford has managed to come out
on the winning side of the score, and j
according to reports from the San |
Francisco Club, unless the Cards can
deliver more forcibly than ever the,
Olympics are out to do a little head- j
chopping of their own.
1923 Score Close
In 1923 Stanford managed to nose .
out the Olympic Club" by the close!
score of 18 to 14 in one of the most
spectacular games played that season.
Many of last year's stars have re
ported to the Winged "O" ranks, be
sides a wealth of new and more 1
formidable material, which promises
to keep the veterans on the hop for
their positions.
Previous scores were also more hair-!
raising than convincing. In 1922 Coach
Courtwriglit's aggregation held the
Cards to 25-21, and only a last-minute
rally gave the Stanford five the win
ning edge. In 1921 the score stood 39
to 34 in favor of Stanford.
Penaluma Is Confident
Ed Penaluma, who is coaching the
Olympic Club this year, has faith
enough in his proteges to schedule a
series of games with the University of
Missouri, to be played later in the
season.
Penaluma, by the way, is placing
most of his faith in the prowess of his
veteran forward, Lauterwasser. Lau
terwasser is no mean goal shooter; he
covers the floor with the speed of an
Oklahoma cyclone, and his dribbling,
it is claimed, will penetrate any
known defense.-Which is saying either
a great deal or nothing for the Olym
pic forward. At least it was Lauter
wasser who scored the greatest num
ber of points against Stanford in the
past two years, and it will be Lauter
wasser who will be closely watched
by the Cardinal guards Saturday.
Boyle Will Be Back
Another veteran and mainstay on
Penaluma's five is Boyle, who has held
down the center job for the Club team
for several years. Boyle is one of
these fellows who "shoots," when the
balcony echoes the well-known plea,
and who usually lands the ball in the
hoop from mid-court or close there
abouts.
The choice of the other Club for
wards lies between Begley, Bonney,
Anderson, and Barbes. The guards will
be picked from Berndt, Donovan, Jen
sen, and Schweitzer.
