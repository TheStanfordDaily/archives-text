# BOK'S IDEALS ALTRUISTIC
## Editor's Offering Of Peace Plan Award Unselfish Desire To Help World 
### Esther Greenacre 
It. was the same idea of improving j
conditions of human welfare running
through Edward Bok's autobiography,
"The Americanization of Edward i
Bok," that prompted him to offer the.
Edward Bok Peace Prize in July, 1023. I
Since the publishing of his autobiogra
phy three years ago, Bok has enlarged
his scope of reformation until, instead
of limiting his activities to this coun
try alone, he now considers the better
ment of world affairs.
The two most important chapters in
Bok's autobiography are undoubtedly
those entitled, "Where America Fell
Short With Me" and "What I Owe to
America." In these chapters, Bok
points out particulars in which Amer-}
ica is lacking in the treatment of her
foreign-born, declaring that American- j
ization is merely a "lip service" while
the real spirit is lacking.
Practical Thrift
Bok devotes a chapter to each ques- |
tion with homely and concrete illus- I
trations. Thus, looking back, he sees
that he had to practice thrift in a >
land of waste, that there was too much
emphasis on quantity and not enough I

on quality, that lack of thoroughness
was the "curse of America," that pub
lic schools failed to provide correctly
for the education of the child of for
eign birth, and there was not enough
respect for law and order, and that
America did not teach its young voters
rightly as to the significance of the
franchise.
On the other hand, Bok states that
America offered education, high ideal
ism, and "the most priceless gift that
any nation can offer, and that is op
portunity."

"The Americanization of Edward
Bok, the Autobiography of a Dutch
Boy Fifty Years After," contains nu
merous good and new stories of fa
mous people with whom Bok came in
contact during his youth and journal
istic career. As a boy, be was an en
thusiastic collector of autographs and
obtained those of many noted people.
Through his naive simplicity and
sincerity, he attracted President
Hayes' attention when a boy. We see
him calling on General Grant, going
to Boston to see Oliver Wendell
Holmes, interviewing Longfellow, and
having friendly talks with Wendell
Phillips, Phillips Brooks, and Henry
Ward Beecher. Personages receiving
letters and questions from the boy
were amused and interested but never
offended. Bok's early encounters with
such people furnished him with ex
cellent literary material throughout
his career and form a big feature of
his autobiography.
Came to U. S. at Age of Six
In addition to this element in the
book, Bok has stressed the title, "An
Autobiography of a Dutch Boy Fifty
Years After," tracing the life of the
little Dutch boy who came to this
country at the age of six, accompanied
by his parents and unable to speak a
word of English. While in school, Bok
earned money by selling buns and
bread, delivering newspapers, and
peddling ice water to passengers on
the Coney Island trains. When thir
teen yearß of age, he left school and
took his first real position with the
Western Union Telegraph Company.
Gradually working up, he became
stenographer to Holts & Scribners, be
ing soon placed in charge of an ad
vertizing department of Scribner's
Magazine and Presbyterian Review.
Bok began and edited the Brooklyn
Magazine and afterwards the Ameri
can and Cosmopolitan. Rising in the
journalistic field, he finally became
editor of the Ladies Home Journal, in
1889, in which position he earned his
big reputation.
Knew What People Wanted
It was Bok's uncanny instinct for
what the people wanted that enabled
him to widen the distribution of the
Ladies Home Journal until it ranks
among the most popular magazines in
the country. The same instinct led him
to surmise that the American people
were strongly averse to war and that
they were eager to express their senti
ments and submit their plans for im
proving international situations.
That this conjecture was correct is
proven by the 22,165 plans submitted
for the Edward Bok Peace Prize.

Since the publishing of his autobiogra
phy three years ago, Bok has enlarged
his scope of reformation until, instead
of limiting his activities to this coun
try alone, he now considers the better
ment of world affairs.
The two most important chapters in
Bok's autobiography are undoubtedly
those entitled, "Where America Fell
Short With Me" and "What I Owe to
America." In these chapters, Bok
points out particulars in which Amer-}
ica is lacking in the treatment of her
foreign-born, declaring that American- j
ization is merely a "lip service" while
the real spirit is lacking.
Practical Thrift
Bok devotes a chapter to each ques- |
tion with homely and concrete illus- I
trations. Thus, looking back, he sees
that he had to practice thrift in a >
land of waste, that there was too much
emphasis on quantity and not enough I

on quality, that lack of thoroughness
was the "curse of America," that pub
lic schools failed to provide correctly
for the education of the child of for
eign birth, and there was not enough
respect for law and order, and that
America did not teach its young voters
rightly as to the significance of the
franchise.
On the other hand, Bok states that
America offered education, high ideal
ism, and "the most priceless gift that
any nation can offer, and that is op
portunity."

"The Americanization of Edward
Bok, the Autobiography of a Dutch
Boy Fifty Years After," contains nu
merous good and new stories of fa
mous people with whom Bok came in
contact during his youth and journal
istic career. As a boy, be was an en
thusiastic collector of autographs and
obtained those of many noted people.
Through his naive simplicity and
sincerity, he attracted President
Hayes' attention when a boy. We see
him calling on General Grant, going
to Boston to see Oliver Wendell
Holmes, interviewing Longfellow, and
having friendly talks with Wendell
Phillips, Phillips Brooks, and Henry
Ward Beecher. Personages receiving
letters and questions from the boy
were amused and interested but never
offended. Bok's early encounters with
such people furnished him with ex
cellent literary material throughout
his career and form a big feature of
his autobiography.
Came to U. S. at Age of Six
In addition to this element in the
book, Bok has stressed the title, "An
Autobiography of a Dutch Boy Fifty
Years After," tracing the life of the
little Dutch boy who came to this
country at the age of six, accompanied
by his parents and unable to speak a
word of English. While in school, Bok
earned money by selling buns and
bread, delivering newspapers, and
peddling ice water to passengers on
the Coney Island trains. When thir
teen yearß of age, he left school and
took his first real position with the
Western Union Telegraph Company.
Gradually working up, he became
stenographer to Holts & Scribners, be
ing soon placed in charge of an ad
vertizing department of Scribner's
Magazine and Presbyterian Review.
Bok began and edited the Brooklyn
Magazine and afterwards the Ameri
can and Cosmopolitan. Rising in the
journalistic field, he finally became
editor of the Ladies Home Journal, in
1889, in which position he earned his
big reputation.
