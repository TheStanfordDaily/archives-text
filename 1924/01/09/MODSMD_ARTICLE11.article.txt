# BOK'S IDEALS ALTRUISTIC
## Editor's Offering Of Peace Plan Award Unselfish Desire To Help World

It. was the same idea of improving j
conditions of human welfare running
through Edward Bok's autobiography,
"The Americanization of Edward i
Bok," that prompted him to offer the.
Edward Bok Peace Prize in July, 1023. I
Since the publishing of his autobiogra
phy three years ago, Bok has enlarged
his scope of reformation until, instead
of limiting his activities to this coun
try alone, he now considers the better
ment of world affairs.
The two most important chapters in
Bok's autobiography are undoubtedly
those entitled, "Where America Fell
Short With Me" and "What I Owe to
America." In these chapters, Bok
points out particulars in which Amer-}
ica is lacking in the treatment of her
foreign-born, declaring that American- j
ization is merely a "lip service" while
the real spirit is lacking.
Practical Thrift
Bok devotes a chapter to each ques- |
tion with homely and concrete illus- I
trations. Thus, looking back, he sees
that he had to practice thrift in a >
land of waste, that there was too much
emphasis on quantity and not enough I

on quality, that lack of thoroughness
was the "curse of America," that pub
lic schools failed to provide correctly
for the education of the child of for
eign birth, and there was not enough
respect for law and order, and that
America did not teach its young voters
rightly as to the significance of the
franchise.
On the other hand, Bok states that
America offered education, high ideal
ism, and "the most priceless gift that
any nation can offer, and that is op
portunity."
Interesting Storjes Told
"The Americanization of Edward
Bok, the Autobiography of a Dutch
Boy Fifty Years After," contains nu
merous good and new stories of fa
mous people with whom Bok came in
contact during his youth and journal
istic career. As a boy, be was an en
thusiastic collector of autographs and
obtained those of many noted people.
Through his naive simplicity and
sincerity, he attracted President
Hayes' attention when a boy. We see
him calling on General Grant, going
to Boston to see Oliver Wendell
