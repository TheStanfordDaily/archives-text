# RAM'S HEAD WILL CONDUCT TRYOUTS FOR ANNUAL SHOW
## Cast of Over Twenty Men to Be Chosen For New Type Of Burlesque 
### 
Ram's Head society will take the |
first step towards the production of j
its annual musical burlesque when
tryouts are held for the cast in the
Assembly hall tomorrow afternoon
from 3 to 6, tomorrow night from 7
to 10, and Friday afternoon from 3 to
6.
Although the construction of the
show plot differs considerable from
the type presented in the last few
years, the traditional characteristics
of Ram's Head's "all male" cast will
be religiously adhered to. All men in
the University are eligible to take
part, and the society is anticipating !
the use of a number of freshmen for
ingenue and other roles. The cast, in
cluding the choruses, will probably
number in the twenties.
Four Acts in Show
The three authors of the burlesque
are Carl Shoup, Northcutt Ely, and
Henry Mack. There are four acts to
the show this year. The name and plan J
of the plot will be kept in darkness 1
until next week when tryouts will be j
completed.
A meeting of Ram's Head was held
this noon in the Union at which time
Louis Alabaster, head of the organiza
tion, outlined the plans of presenta
tion, and described the characteristics
of the play.
Alabaster Directs Music
Alabaster will have musical direc
! tion of the production, as well as gen
j eral supervision. The regular director
j has not yet been announced. Themes
| have already been received from a
number of campus composers, among
the best of which are pieces by Carey,
Glauber, Alabaster, and Lowenstein.
| Original music, which may be con
tributed by any men, must be for
warded to Alabaster within a short
time. The pieces must be light and
catchy, as there is little place in the
play for sentimental, slow melody.
