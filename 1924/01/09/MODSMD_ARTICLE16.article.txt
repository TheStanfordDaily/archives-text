## El Tigre-Delta Chi Contest Goes Extra Period to Determine Winner 
### 
One upset featured yesterday's play
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment when the Japanese Club won
over Phi Kappa *>'he ether vic
tors of the day were: Phi Delta Theta,
Beta Theta Pi. Alpha Kappa Lambda,
and El Tigre.
All the five games were hard and
close, one being forced to go an extra
five-minute period.
Breakers Headed Early
Both quintets of the Breaker-Phi
Delta Theta game were well-matched
and began the contest at a fast pace.
The Phi Delta Theta forwards, Logan
and Playter, were able to break
through more often into their terri
tory and scored four points to the
Breakers' none during the first half.
A new team was substituted by the
leaders to begin the second period but
as the Breaker forward threatened
to score too often the first five was
replaced by Phi Delta Theta. Follow
ing this, Fletcher and Playter man
aged to toss in two goals, although
the Breakers pressed them every min
ute, ending the game, 8 to 4.
Beta Theta Pi Wins
Good team-work and passing was
displayed in the Beta Theta Pi-Phi
Gamma Delta game which ended with
the former in the lead, 11 to 8. The
winners, however, last year's intra
mural champions, were able to break
through the Phi Gamma Delta defense
oftener, but neither side could find the
hoop, and the first half ended 4 to 2.
Near the end of the second half,
Phi Gamma Delta climbed up with
two goals tossed in by Condit, and
forced Beta Theta Pi to extend them
selves, which they did, managing to
hold a three-point lead for three min
utes, winning 11 to 8.
Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated En
cina first floor, 14 to 2, in the third
game of the day. The hall men were
outclassed in weight and teamwork
but fought continually. Anawalt, a fast
forward, was responsible for the lone
Encina score, while Cornell, Howe,
and Hardwick divided honors for
Alpha Kappa Lambda.
Club Finally Wins
One of the closest games of the day
and one which went an extra period
to play off a tie, was the El Tigre-
Delta Chi contest. Two long shots,
placed by Suffern for Delta Chi and
Lowe for El Tigre, began the first
half. After 15 minutes of irregular
play up and down the floor with Suf
fern and Coplen forming a fast com
bination for Delta Chi, the half ended,
3 to 3.
The second half uncovered more
fight in both teams which fought des
perately for the breaks but the game
ended in a 7 to 7 tie, necessitating the
extra period. Butterfield cinched the
game for El Tigre by tossing in a field
goal near the end of the five minutes
and the club won 10 to 8.
Japanese Club Fast
The fastest and closest contest of
the day—and even the tournament
thus far —was won by the Japanese
Club over Phi Kappa Psi, a last year's
league winner, 18 to 12.
The Japanese displayed a brand of
basketball that kept Phi Kappa Psi
guessing and winded, and which will
prove dangerous to future opponents.
The first half the Phi Psi'e weight,
coupled with excellent teamwork, en
abled them to force the ball into their
own territory most of the time, but
if a' slip was made, the Japanese im

mediately carried it back out of dan
ger with a quickness and passing
ability that is very seldom seen in
intramural competition. The half end
ed 7 to 1 with Phi Kappa Psi in the
lead through the efforts of Knox, their
center.
The second half, however, the Japa
nese took the lead and held it to the
end, winning 18 to 12. Time after time
they carried the ball into their terri
tory and scored with great accuracy.
Koba and Kiton at forward were re
sponsible for a majority of the shots.

One upset featured yesterday's play
in the intramural basketball tourna
ment when the Japanese Club won
over Phi Kappa *>'he ether vic
tors of the day were: Phi Delta Theta,
Beta Theta Pi. Alpha Kappa Lambda,
and El Tigre.
All the five games were hard and
close, one being forced to go an extra
five-minute period.
Breakers Headed Early
Both quintets of the Breaker-Phi
Delta Theta game were well-matched
and began the contest at a fast pace.
The Phi Delta Theta forwards, Logan
and Playter, were able to break
through more often into their terri
tory and scored four points to the
Breakers' none during the first half.
A new team was substituted by the
leaders to begin the second period but
as the Breaker forward threatened
to score too often the first five was
replaced by Phi Delta Theta. Follow
ing this, Fletcher and Playter man
aged to toss in two goals, although
the Breakers pressed them every min
ute, ending the game, 8 to 4.
Beta Theta Pi Wins
Good team-work and passing was
displayed in the Beta Theta Pi-Phi
Gamma Delta game which ended with
the former in the lead, 11 to 8. The
winners, however, last year's intra
mural champions, were able to break
through the Phi Gamma Delta defense
oftener, but neither side could find the
hoop, and the first half ended 4 to 2.
Near the end of the second half,
Phi Gamma Delta climbed up with
two goals tossed in by Condit, and
forced Beta Theta Pi to extend them
selves, which they did, managing to
hold a three-point lead for three min
utes, winning 11 to 8.
Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated En
cina first floor, 14 to 2, in the third
game of the day. The hall men were
outclassed in weight and teamwork
but fought continually. Anawalt, a fast
forward, was responsible for the lone
Encina score, while Cornell, Howe,
and Hardwick divided honors for
Alpha Kappa Lambda.
Club Finally Wins
One of the closest games of the day
and one which went an extra period
to play off a tie, was the El Tigre-
Delta Chi contest. Two long shots,
placed by Suffern for Delta Chi and
Lowe for El Tigre, began the first
half. After 15 minutes of irregular
play up and down the floor with Suf
fern and Coplen forming a fast com
bination for Delta Chi, the half ended,
3 to 3.
The second half uncovered more
fight in both teams which fought des
perately for the breaks but the game
ended in a 7 to 7 tie, necessitating the
extra period. Butterfield cinched the
game for El Tigre by tossing in a field
goal near the end of the five minutes
and the club won 10 to 8.
Japanese Club Fast
The fastest and closest contest of
the day—and even the tournament
thus far —was won by the Japanese
Club over Phi Kappa Psi, a last year's
league winner, 18 to 12.
The Japanese displayed a brand of
basketball that kept Phi Kappa Psi
guessing and winded, and which will
prove dangerous to future opponents.
The first half the Phi Psi'e weight,
coupled with excellent teamwork, en
abled them to force the ball into their
own territory most of the time, but

the day—and even the tournament
thus far —was won by the Japanese
Club over Phi Kappa Psi, a last year's
league winner, 18 to 12.
The Japanese displayed a brand of
basketball that kept Phi Kappa Psi
guessing and winded, and which will
prove dangerous to future opponents.
The first half the Phi Psi'e weight,
coupled with excellent teamwork, en
abled them to force the ball into their
own territory most of the time, but
if a' slip was made, the Japanese im

mediately carried it back out of dan
ger with a quickness and passing
ability that is very seldom seen in
intramural competition. The half end
ed 7 to 1 with Phi Kappa Psi in the
lead through the efforts of Knox, their
center.
The second half, however, the Japa
nese took the lead and held it to the
end, winning 18 to 12. Time after time
they carried the ball into their terri
tory and scored with great accuracy.
Koba and Kiton at forward were re
sponsible for a majority of the shots.
