# After Forty Minutes
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity basketball team trotted out onto the floor for its
game against the College of the Pacific Saturday night, a more or less un
known quantity in spite of the fact that it had won two preliminary games.
After forty minutes of fast milling, the Cardinals emerged on the long
end of a 38-9 score. That game showed the rooters that in spite of the
flock of wet blankets flying through the air, Andy Kerr has made a good
start towards putting out a real basketball team this year.
The two things that interested Stanford supporters most in the first
intercollegiate game were the playing of Steele and Mcßurney. Both were
second-string men last year. Both were on the "doubtful" list at the start
of this season. Steele played a wonderful defensive game and on four dif
ferent occasions split the Pacific defense wide open, dribbled through and
sunk a basket.
Mcßurney, at running guard, supposedly the weak position on the
team, played a sensational floor game and caged three baskets. His show
ing not only gives him an edge on the running guard job but indicates that
his work will be up to the standard of former victorious Cardinal teams.
Captain McHose and Ernie Nevers worked well together at forward,
exceedingly well for so early in the season. Oliva, of course, played his
usual consistent and brainy game under the basket.
Kerr is still worrying about capable substitutes, but there is plenty of
material among the reserves from which the Cardinal coach may build
future stars, as he has built from last year's substitutes. Stanford sup
porters have learned to expect the unusual from Andy.
