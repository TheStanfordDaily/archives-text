# TIMOTHY HOPKINS GIVES LETTERS TO RAILWAY LIBRARY
## Collection Deals With Early California History of Transportation 
### 
Timothy Hopkins, a trustee of Stan
ford University and for many years
treasurer of the Southern Pacific Rail
road, has given to the University a
collection of manuscripts which will
materially increase the historical
value of the special collection in the
Stanford Library dealing with rail
roads.
This most recent gift consists large
ly of correspondence between Mr. Hop
kins' father, Mark Hopkins, Leland
Stanford, and Collis P. Huntington
during the late sixties and early seven
ties. These letters from Stanford to
Huntington to Hopkins and mn
terial in the collection will be of great
use to students of the early develop
ment of railroads in this state.
Collection Dates From 1892
Stanford has in the Hopkins railway
library one of the two or three best
collections dealing with railroads in
this country. It was established in
1892 by Mr. Hopkins, who presented to
the University his private library on
railroads, consisting of about 2,000
books. For many years he provided
the money for maintenance and up
building of this collection.
At the present time the Hopkins
railway library numbers approximate
ly 10,000 volumes and pamphlets deal
ing with the economic, engineering,
and historical phases of railway trans
portation. Many of the items in the
collection, especially reports of rail
roads in the United States and Eu
rope, and some state and government
reports, are no longer available.
