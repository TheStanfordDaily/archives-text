January 6, 1914 —Professor E. D.
Adams, of the History department, left
for Washington, D. C., to collaborate
with Charles Francis Adams in pre
paring a book to treat of the relations
between England and the United
States during the American Civil War.
The work was to require seven or
eight months.
Much of the book was barred on in
formation contained in the diary of
Charles Francis Adam's father, who
was American minister to England
during the Civil War. The parts of
the diary to be used had been selected
and Professor Adams had spent a
great deal of time in Washington
studying secret diplomatic messages
which were to be disclosed for the
first time.

The January Sequoia was off the
press under new business manage
ment and new editorial control. The
magazine was sold at the Registrar's
office and the Bookstore. The special
article of the edition was "Safeguard
ing the Stanford Spirit," by E. W.
Smith, '99.
* * *
Twenty-four Glee Club men arrived
on the campus after completing a two
weeks tour of the Northwest on which
they gave twelve concerts and trav
eled nearly 2500 milcß. Much favorable
newspaper comment was gained by a
lively vaudeville show which was
staged instead of the customary cut
and-dried concert usually given by
Glee Clubs.
♦ • *
Eighteen students were barred from
registering in the University on ac
count of failure in the December
finals. The total number of delinquent
students was 102, one less than the

number which received flunks from
the registrar's office the year before.
One-tenth of the fraternity men failed,
while only thirteen of the non-fra
ternity students fell below.
♦ * *
Over 1700 students were enrolled
although no statistics were obtainable.
Approximately 100 students registered
for graduate work, and it was expec
ed an additional 100 would be the
day's total.
• * *
January 7 —"The Fortune Hunter,"
an American comedy in four acts by
Winchell Smith, was formally chosen
by the 1916 play committee as the
sophomore production for the year. It
was a type of the American comedy
less farcical in nature than former
second year productions, but it was
strikingly modern and was interwoven
with a pleasing proportion of pathos.
• * *
Activity in construction was caus
ing much new work on the campus.
The organ had been moved from the
Assembly hall to the Memorial Church
and the organ was to be used at the
next Sunday service. Later in the
year an echo organ, together with a
concert harp and cathedral chimes,
was to be installed near the west
gallery.
The interior of the new Applied
Mathematics building awaited the
painter and was to be completed as
soon as the desks and blackboards ar
rived from the East.
Electric lights were to be installed
on the roads of the campus as soon
as the ordered equipment arrived.
Near the Quad, the lamp standards
were of an ornamental type, while
those on the Row were less elaborate.
