COUNTRY WEEKLY NUMBER
Social Items
Classes were held two days last week.
, Our genial young Klanner sent out some letters this week. A number of
our young townsmen were honored. We wish to suggest that the letters be
printed on softer paper in the future, so that they can be used for blotters.
Ah, there, Robert!
The youth and beauty of the campus gathered at the ladies' club last week
at the ball given by our Glee Club. A good time was reported as being had
by all. Ambrose Whitmer supplied the syncopation in his usual fluent style.
Ham sandwiches and coffee were served in the Union store this week. Our
merchants are always up to date.
Our popular young opera hall manager, Gordon Davis, says that he is start
ing work on a new play, "Millstones," this week. Gordon says the play will
be put on with customary eclat and finish.
Classes are being held this week.
A number of our students are sporting new neckties this w>eek. 'Twas the
week after Christmas, and under our hats appeared a vast number of gaudy
cravats. Ah, there, Lew!
Jim Delkin says he has some nice new goods in this week. One and kll are
invited to come in and look things over. Visitors welcome, says Jim.
Motion pictures were shown in both Paly theaters last week. Our theaters
are always up to date.
It is reported that one of the fraternity houses has a cigarette rolling
machine installed. Things have come to a pretty pass when the boys are too
lazy to roll 'em by hand. Such practices should be frowned on, say we.
Classes will be held next week. —D. L.

Guy Bates Post says that what Stanford needs for a successful dra
matic department is a new theater, full houses for every show, and a
few Broadway stars to give individual performances. Now, why didn't
somebody think of that before. Our officials should be up on their toes
more, and not leave it to outsiders to show them where they fail.
On the strength of the Post interview, Cabbages dashed out and gathered
a few interviews of his own. As a result, we are able to announce:
That the best way to become rich is to make a lot of money.
That to be a successful merchant one should sell lots of goods at high prices.
That to be a successful artist it is best to paint beautiful and original
pictures.
Here's What They Mean
When They Talk of
A Fine Artistic
Frenzy, See?
(Guy Bates Post in our own D. P. A.)
"I think the movies have great possibilities, and some time iw the future
they will be as a changing procession viewed from the top of a mountain in
the opalescent light of the sky." —D. L.
