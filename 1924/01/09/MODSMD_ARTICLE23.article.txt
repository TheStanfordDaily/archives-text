# COLLEGE MEN COMMENDED
## Two Business Men Claim Graduates Are Superior And Get Better Jobs 
### Donald Adams 
That the college graduate is much
in demand for positions of responsi
bility in the business world is made
evident by the statements in inter
views of two business men of South
ern California.
J. R. *Gabbert, president of the
Southern California Editorial associa
tion, and George T. Bigelow, assistant
general agent of the Southern Sierras
Power Company of Riverside, both be
lieve that the college-trained man is
the one and only person on whom the
problems and responsibilities of man
agement can be placed.
"College Men Best Journalists"
Gabbert, who is a newspaper editor,
speaks of the college graduate from
the journalistic point of view. "I like
to have a college man come into my
newspaper organization, partly be
cause I am a college man and more
especially because my experience has
been that a larger part of newspaper
men who succeed are college gradu
ates. Particularly has this been true
of men and women who have taken
their college courses with the hope of
entering journalism and who have en
tered this work immediately follow
ing graduation and not as a second
choice after semi-failure in some
other line."
Gabbert finds that men and women
who have tried out and made good in
college journalism are usually success
ful in practical newspaper work. They
already have a foundation on which to
work and do not have to build up this
foundation after taking up the work
at the expense of the newspaper for
which they are working.
Have Better Background
"A college graduate," Gabbert states,
"has a better background for the daily
newspaper grind than the average
man and woman with lesser training.
The power of concentration he has
developed in making a success of con
quering the various problems he has
had to meet in his academic work, is
one of the biggest assets he has. The
mere mechanics of the job he has to
master is small compared with the
tools he brings to it from a well
rounded college course."
When asked concerning the capa
bility of college graduates Mr. Bigelow
summed his answer in the following
statement: "The college man gets the
big things and the untrained man does
not. The Southern Sierras Power Com

pany has, for the past several years,
conducted a school in connection with
its business of supplying electric ener
gy for a large part of California. The
practical failure of the lower division
of the school conducted for students
who had no college training and the
success of the upper division for stu
dents who had had college training, is
an example, Bigelow says, of the su
periority of college graduates over the
untrained students.
Graduates Are Superior
"They know how to apply them
selves to the problems they must
face," Bigelow states. "The training
in the use of their mind besides the
facts they have gathered, are the most
valuable assets to their work for us
and they save ub time and money."
