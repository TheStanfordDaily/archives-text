# TRACK MEN PREPARE FOR COMING MEET
## 
### 
The members of the track squad are
going through light work-outs every
afternoon on the varsity field under
the direction of Coach "Dink" Temple
ton. As soon as the weather becomes
warmer, intense training will start
in preparation for the competitive
"Season.
Infformal meets are scheduled to
take place every Friday afternoon,
in which all of the talent 011 the Farm
will take part. The annual interclass
track meet will take place on March
8. No other dates for track meets
have been announced yet.
The return of "Tiny" Hartranft has
caused the Stanford stock to take a
big upward jump. Hartranft is one of
the best shot and discus men in the
country and also covers the hundred
in fast time as a side issue.
Plenty of Sprinters
The most outstanding sprinters are
Campbell, Hale, Miller, and Gaspar.
Campbell set a new Stanford-Califor
na record in the 220 last year, and
took second in the century.
Hale has been running the hundred
in :10 1-5 consistently all year, which
marks him as a dangerous contender.
Gaspar and Miller are the men who
did the sprinting for 1926 last year,
and, while they are not considered
as fast as the two older men, both of
them will bear watching. Gaspar is
better in the century and Miller in
the furlong.
Van Judah, the track captain, is the
best bet in the 440. He does the dis
tance in about :50 flat. He is a power
ful runner, and does a good race in
the relay after running a strenuous
quarter. Storey, Coverly, Mixon, and
Richardson are also candidates for
this distance.
Experienced Half Milers
Daly, Swayne, Richardson. Dole, and
Smith are the half milers. All of these
men have shown about equal ability
in the past and to pick the winner is a
precarious job.
Templeton has a strong array of
milers. The list includes Kerr, Pas
torious, Hayes, Smith, Cypher, and
Clifford. The two mile men may also
be selected from this number.
Leistner, Boles, and Wells will re
present Stanford in the hurdles. Leist
ner and Boles are very evenly matched
and seem to be the most likely first
and second place winners in both
hurdles in most of the meets. Wells is
a new man but has shown good early
season form.
Macßae and Bragg in Jump
Macßae and Bragg are the broad
jumpers. Both of them have been do
ing better than 21 feet and will prob
ably hit the 22 foot mark before the
season starts. Kemnitzer and Ander
son are the high jumpers. They have
not had an opportunity to do their best
high jumping yet this year, but clear
ing the six foot mark is not an im
possibility for them.
Dennis, Scofield, and Lloyd will do
the vaulting. They rate in the order
named. Dennis and Scofield were on
the varsity last year, while Lloyd was
the freshman vaulter. Farish and Nev
ers are the most promising javelin
candidates. Farish will do 185 feet.
Nevers has great possibilities and may
develop into a first-class javelin throw
er, with a little practice.
Richards, Hartranft, Arthur, Nevers,
and Ludeke will do the shot putting.
The same group plus Scotchy Camp
bell will perform in the discus. Hart
ranft and Arthur are probably the two
most outstanding stars in these events.

in which all of the talent 011 the Farm
will take part. The annual interclass
track meet will take place on March
8. No other dates for track meets
have been announced yet.
The return of "Tiny" Hartranft has
caused the Stanford stock to take a
big upward jump. Hartranft is one of
the best shot and discus men in the
country and also covers the hundred
in fast time as a side issue.
Plenty of Sprinters
The most outstanding sprinters are
Campbell, Hale, Miller, and Gaspar.
Campbell set a new Stanford-Califor
na record in the 220 last year, and
took second in the century.
Hale has been running the hundred
in :10 1-5 consistently all year, which
marks him as a dangerous contender.
Gaspar and Miller are the men who
did the sprinting for 1926 last year,
and, while they are not considered
as fast as the two older men, both of
them will bear watching. Gaspar is
better in the century and Miller in
the furlong.
Van Judah, the track captain, is the
best bet in the 440. He does the dis
tance in about :50 flat. He is a power
ful runner, and does a good race in
the relay after running a strenuous
quarter. Storey, Coverly, Mixon, and
Richardson are also candidates for
this distance.
Experienced Half Milers
Daly, Swayne, Richardson. Dole, and
Smith are the half milers. All of these
men have shown about equal ability
in the past and to pick the winner is a
precarious job.
Templeton has a strong array of
milers. The list includes Kerr, Pas
torious, Hayes, Smith, Cypher, and
Clifford. The two mile men may also
be selected from this number.
Leistner, Boles, and Wells will re
present Stanford in the hurdles. Leist
ner and Boles are very evenly matched
and seem to be the most likely first
and second place winners in both
hurdles in most of the meets. Wells is
a new man but has shown good early
season form.
Macßae and Bragg in Jump
Macßae and Bragg are the broad
jumpers. Both of them have been do
ing better than 21 feet and will prob
ably hit the 22 foot mark before the
season starts. Kemnitzer and Ander
son are the high jumpers. They have
not had an opportunity to do their best
high jumping yet this year, but clear
ing the six foot mark is not an im
possibility for them.
Dennis, Scofield, and Lloyd will do
the vaulting. They rate in the order
named. Dennis and Scofield were on
the varsity last year, while Lloyd was
the freshman vaulter. Farish and Nev
ers are the most promising javelin
candidates. Farish will do 185 feet.
Nevers has great possibilities and may
develop into a first-class javelin throw
er, with a little practice.
Richards, Hartranft, Arthur, Nevers,
and Ludeke will do the shot putting.
The same group plus Scotchy Camp
bell will perform in the discus. Hart
ranft and Arthur are probably the two
most outstanding stars in these events.
The members of the track squad are
going through light work-outs every
afternoon on the varsity field under
the direction of Coach "Dink" Temple
ton. As soon as the weather becomes
warmer, intense training will start
in preparation for the competitive
"Season.
Infformal meets are scheduled to
