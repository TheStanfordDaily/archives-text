# BAND EXPELLED FROM ENGINEERING BIDING
## 
### 
After fifteen years of unmolested
noise-making in the attic of the En
gineering building, the Stanford Band
has been forced to haul up its stakes
and move.
Nobody to like the band well
enough to be within hearing distance
of the two rehearsals a week. The
new band manager, Claude Bryner, is
searching, but never finding, suitable
quarters for the organization.
Nearly every year the Engineering
department has threatened to oust the
band from its midst, but nothing ever
came of it. Last quarter some di'awing
tables were moved into the band room.
They proved to be birds of ill omen,
for no sooner had the present quarter
started than the ultimatum was
served.
Fifteen years is a long time to hold
a room. It was considered the home
of the band; almost an integral part of
it. Last night the band found a tem
porary rehearsing place in the audi
torium of the Zoology building, the
old library.
The staid, arched roof echoed and
re-echoed at the indignity of college
marches and jazz. It echoed so much
as to make the music one grand,
blurred noise. So the band must move
again. Where it will end up, nobody
knows. One thing is certaiif. In the
words of Professor Ernest Whitney
Martin, of the Classical Literature de
partment and head of the band, "No
room, no music!"
