# BABES TO CLASH WITH SAN MATEO QUINTET TONIGHT
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt wilt send his
Babe basketball quintet against the
strong San Mateo. Junior College five
tonight in Uia pavilion. The contest
will start promptly at 7 o'clock,
The freshmen are fast rounding into
a formidable aggregation. The showing
made by them against the Placer high
school last Saturday was about all
that could be asked for.
Price and David work well together
at forward. They are both deliberate
in their shooting, and as a result get
a good per cent of their shots. They
have had plenty of high school ex
perience, and this, coupled with their
natural ability, bids fair to make them
as good a pair of freshman forwards
as has been seen here for some time.
Riese and Southworth have the edge
on the other forwards who are trying
to oust the two regulars from their
positions. Both of these men played
against Placer, and they will probably
get in the game tonight.
Jayred Is Center
Jayred is expected to start at cen
by no means cinched his position.
Menzies, Newkirk, Hoffman, and An
derson are all capable men, and any
one of them may finally win out at
this position.
Shipkey is slated to open the game
at running guard, and Newhouse will
start at standing guard. Both of them
did well against Placer. Shipkey plays
the floor well but has not been able
to locate the hoop with much luck yet.
Newhouse is big and heavy and can
stand lots of roughing. He is fast for
a man of his size, and makes a valu
able addition to the team.
Oakland Next Opponent
The Babes will meet the Oakland
Tech five Saturday, according to
present plans. The Oakland boys al
ways have a powerful aggregation,
and from reports, this year will be
no exception.
Hunt has given up the plan of hav
ing two teams, one to play on Wednes
days, and the other to play Saturdays.
He intends to carry as many hoopsters
as possible throughout the season, in
order to help develop future varsity
stars. There will probably be no great
cut in the squad for some time.
Little is known about the San Mateo
team. It is reputed to be the strongest
team in San Mateo, which doesn't lend
much light to the subject. If the fresh
men show up, to their form of last
week they should come through with
another victory.
