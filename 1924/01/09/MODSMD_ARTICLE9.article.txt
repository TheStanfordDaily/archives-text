# DIALECT OE NEGRO IS ENGLISH, SAYS KRAPP
## 
### 
"Pronunciation of such words as
'waterinellion' is not distinctly negro !
dialect, but was a common part of :
nineteenth century speech," was the i
statement made by Professor Krapp
yesterday evening in his lecture on
negro English.
"The fruit, which is customarily as
sociated with the darkey also seems
to have been the occasion of moral
delinquency among the people of New
England, according to the court rec
ords of the times, which show numer
ous cases of persons taking 'water
mellions'."
No Trace of Alien Speech
According to Professor Krapp, it is
safe to say that not a single detail
of negro syntax or pronunciation has
another origin than English. There
are no traces of any alien speech
which they had in the beginning.
While it is possible that such words
ter. He is the choice now but he has
as "voodoo" and 'hoodoo" may be of
real negro origin, "jazz," "mosey," and
"tote" are not truly negro words, but
ancient English.
People often say they can tell a
negro by his voice. Experiment has
shown that this is a mistaken idea,
Professor Krapp asserted. One hears
the speech of negroes more illiterately
than that of a white, It; there were no
anticipation, their speech would not
seem so different.
When negroes first came to Arner-
ica, their white overlords spoke a
very much simplified English to make
them understand, using no verb
tenses, making no distinction of nouns
and pronouns, and reducing their vo
cabulary to its lowest elements. This
type of infantile English is still used
by a tribe of negroes in South Caro
lina called the Gulla negroes. Their
dialect had practically no other sour
ces than English.
"Two hundred years ago all the
negroes in America must have used a
dialect like the Gulla," Professor
Krapp estimated. "However, there are
no records of any negro dialect until
the period of the Revolution."
Early Writers Use Little Dialect
Cooper, Irving, Poe, and other first
class literary artists of the early nine
teenth century used the dialect form
very sparingly in their negro charac
terizations. In "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
the main character, having a special
dramatic significance, speaks with
little dialect. The other characters are
more dialectic but their speech resem
bles very closely the colloquialisms of
New England.

Nearly 5,000,000 licenses were grant
ed to persons in the United States last
year for the privilege of hunting and
fishing. Fees paid by sportsmen and
sportswomen amounted to approxi
mately $5,700,000.

No Trace of Alien Speech
According to Professor Krapp, it is
safe to say that not a single detail
of negro syntax or pronunciation has
another origin than English. There
are no traces of any alien speech
which they had in the beginning.
While it is possible that such words
ter. He is the choice now but he has
as "voodoo" and 'hoodoo" may be of
real negro origin, "jazz," "mosey," and
"tote" are not truly negro words, but
ancient English.
People often say they can tell a
negro by his voice. Experiment has
shown that this is a mistaken idea,
Professor Krapp asserted. One hears
the speech of negroes more illiterately
than that of a white, It; there were no
anticipation, their speech would not
seem so different.
When negroes first came to Arner-
ica, their white overlords spoke a
very much simplified English to make
them understand, using no verb
tenses, making no distinction of nouns
and pronouns, and reducing their vo
cabulary to its lowest elements. This
type of infantile English is still used
by a tribe of negroes in South Caro
lina called the Gulla negroes. Their
dialect had practically no other sour
ces than English.
"Two hundred years ago all the
negroes in America must have used a
dialect like the Gulla," Professor
Krapp estimated. "However, there are
no records of any negro dialect until
the period of the Revolution."
Early Writers Use Little Dialect
Cooper, Irving, Poe, and other first
class literary artists of the early nine
teenth century used the dialect form
very sparingly in their negro charac
terizations. In "Uncle Tom's Cabin,"
the main character, having a special
dramatic significance, speaks with
little dialect. The other characters are
more dialectic but their speech resem
bles very closely the colloquialisms of
New England.

Nearly 5,000,000 licenses were grant

year for the privilege of hunting and

statement made by Professor Krapp
yesterday evening in his lecture on
negro English.
