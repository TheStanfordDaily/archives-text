times that each neared their baskets,

offensive games, the former also
breaking up many Encina plays, but
could not seem to find the basket, and
the half ended 5 to 4 with the hall men
leading.

tie, 11 to 11, through well-placed shots
by Meeks, the fast offensive forward,
and Semons of Encina and Deffebach
and Middleton for Kappa Sigma.
Meeks saved the game for Encina in
the second period by tossing in two
field goals, being helped by Smythe
and Semons.
For Kappa Sigma, Symonds, Middle
ton, and Deffebach played a fast,
strong game.
Sequoia I Wins
Sequoia I overwhelmed Encina sth
floor, in their game, 16 to 2. Although
the former displayed a better passing
game in the first half and were able
to keep the ball in their own territory
most of the time, they showed no eye
for the basket and barely made a lead
of 3 to 2 at the end of the half.
More fight was shown by the Se
quoia five beginning the second half
and they were able to amass thirteen
points with ease, at the same time
allowing no further scoring by the
Encina quintet.
Fortune led the scoring with eight

points, and O'Donnell followed with
six.
Club Teams Ragged
Little team-work was used in the
El Capitan-El Campo contest which
was won by the former —7 to 5. Men
on both teams preferred to dribble or
shoot rather than pass and the ball
was continually changing hands. After
several exhibitions of fairly good indi
vidual work, the half ended 6 to 2 with
El Capitan leading.
In the second period, El Campo man
aged to work better on offensive and
was able to gain three points, but El
Capitan accounted for one more and
won the contest —7 to 5.
Fair, White, and Evans each scored
for El Capitan.
Hobro and Pearce accounted for the
two El Campo goals.
Theta Delta Chi defaulted to Zeta
Psi.
