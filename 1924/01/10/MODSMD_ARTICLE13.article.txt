# All-University Dance Promised By Press Gang
## 
### 
An All-University dance is not a
Jolly-up. Sigma Delta Chi, according
to Dr. Jekyll, does not approve of
Jolly-ups but is heartily in favor of an
All-University affair of a more pleas
ing nature.
Accordingly the "man-mountains"
will be hosts at just such an affair in
the Women's Clubhouse tomorrow
evening, beginning at 9 o'clock and
terminating only when the Alabaster
melody association runs out of atmos
phere.
The only point of similarity between
the Sigma Delta Chi foot-stutter and
a Jolly-up is in the invitation list. The
reception committee will wrap up and
deliver a warm welcome to every man
and woman on the campus, nor is
there any embargo on imports.
Doubters and adherents of the Jolly
up will find food for thought in the
radical changes planned by the jour
nalists by way of constructive criti
cism. Women will be admitted free,
provided that each one is accompanied
by an escort equipped with the usual
dollar and the usual war tax.
