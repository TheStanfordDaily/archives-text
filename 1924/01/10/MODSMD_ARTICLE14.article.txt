# PRESIDENT WILBUR ADDRESSES PASTORS
## Theological Conference in Los Angeles Hears Talk by Eminent Scientist 
### 
President Ray Lymatj Wilbur was I
one of the speakers at the opening ses- !
sion yesterday of a three-day Pacific :
Southwest Theological conference
held at Los Angeles. This conference
is participated in by clergymen of all
denominations from California, Ari- '
zona, and New Mexico, and its object |
is announced as being "to promote !
Christian Thinking" and to be "a de- j
monstration of fellowship between
leaders of education, science, and re
ligion." Various leading scientists and
educators ,as well as well-known
clergymen are among the speakers.
Dr. Charles R. Brown, dean of the
School of Religion at Yale and a mem- ;
her of the recently created Stanford i
National Board, who will preach in the
Stanford Memorial Church next Sun
day, is on the program at Los Angeles i
for a number of addresses.
President Wilbur's topic was "The j
Field of Sciente." He sketched the !
developement of man as a social ani- j
mal who has grown into a realization
of the need of cooperation, altruism,
and idealism.
"The relation of idealism, interde
pendence, self-sacrifice, religion, to
fact is absolute", Dr. Wilbur said, "no
matter how we may delude ourselves
with dogma, prejudice, choked thought
processes, or ignorance.
"The effects of new discoveries are
slow upon the thought process of
many. Readjustments are difficult and
require constant mental effort. Many
desire relief from mental fatigue, un
certainty and worry, and choose to
shunt their minds off into the placebo
or anodyne of some special formula
or creed. They have sort of a dark
cyclone cellar to run their minds into
when they become turbulent with un
solved and disturbing thoughts."
We must express our religion, Dr.
Wilbur said, in service to our neigh
bor and in moral and spiritual deve
lopment of ourselves. Religion, he de
clared, is primarily unselfish and can
no longer be viewed merely as a
selfish process to save one's soul.
"There are unknown factors all
about us", he said. "We must grope
ahead, seeking the truth, and be
thankful for the sweet leadership of
the Man of Gallilee."

many. Readjustments are difficult and
require constant mental effort. Many
desire relief from mental fatigue, un
certainty and worry, and choose to
shunt their minds off into the placebo
or anodyne of some special formula
or creed. They have sort of a dark
cyclone cellar to run their minds into
when they become turbulent with un
solved and disturbing thoughts."
We must express our religion, Dr.
Wilbur said, in service to our neigh
bor and in moral and spiritual deve
lopment of ourselves. Religion, he de
clared, is primarily unselfish and can
no longer be viewed merely as a
selfish process to save one's soul.
"There are unknown factors all
about us", he said. "We must grope
ahead, seeking the truth, and be
thankful for the sweet leadership of
the Man of Gallilee."
President Ray Lymatj Wilbur was I
one of the speakers at the opening ses- !
sion yesterday of a three-day Pacific :
Southwest Theological conference
held at Los Angeles. This conference

Christian Thinking" and to be "a de- j
monstration of fellowship between

ligion." Various leading scientists and
educators ,as well as well-known

Dr. Charles R. Brown, dean of the
School of Religion at Yale and a mem- ;
her of the recently created Stanford i
National Board, who will preach in the
Stanford Memorial Church next Sun
day, is on the program at Los Angeles i
for a number of addresses.
President Wilbur's topic was "The j
Field of Sciente." He sketched the !
developement of man as a social ani- j
mal who has grown into a realization
of the need of cooperation, altruism,
and idealism.
"The relation of idealism, interde
pendence, self-sacrifice, religion, to
fact is absolute", Dr. Wilbur said, "no
matter how we may delude ourselves
with dogma, prejudice, choked thought
processes, or ignorance.
"The effects of new discoveries are
slow upon the thought process of
many. Readjustments are difficult and
require constant mental effort. Many
desire relief from mental fatigue, un
certainty and worry, and choose to
shunt their minds off into the placebo
or anodyne of some special formula
or creed. They have sort of a dark
cyclone cellar to run their minds into
when they become turbulent with un
