# EUROPE STILL UNCHANGED
## Professor Stanley Smith Back On Campus After Fifteen Months Abroad 
### Ray Spangler 
Stanley A. Smith, professor of
French, has returned to the campus
after fifteen months in Europe. With
his wife and three sons. Professor
Smith spent eight months in France,
three and one-half months in Italy,
and the balance of the period in Bel
gium.
"I went to Europe with misgivings.
I was told that I would find a very
different Europe from the one I new
in 1912, I was warned that the people
were so changed as to be almost a
new race.
Living Conditions Unchanged
"But I found that living conditions
haven't changed much. Prices are
higher, and life isn't as comfortable
as it was- before the war, but as far
as American visitors are concerned,
things are much as they were ten
years ago.
"The people are going ahead as bos!
they can, earnestly and in a dignified
manner, rebuilding devastated areas
largely at their own expense. In Italy,
Mussolini is the man of the hour.
There is some criticism against him
by the communists and the bolshevists
because he is a dictator. But Italy
needs a dictator. If Mussolini had not
come, Italy would have gone bolshe
vist," declares Professor Smith.
Fascist! Make Changes
"The Fascisti have Introduced radi
cal economic changes. They have
eliminated some of the government

plums, and have done more than either
France or Belgium towards keeping
up a favorable rate of exchange.
"To this end, tipping has been large
ly standardized. Tips are taken as a
certain percentage of the total bill
and added to it. In many places, luxury
and sojourn taxes are also added. This
tends to make living more expensive
for the traveler in Italy than in
France or Belgium.
"Although I am not primarily a
political economist, I consider France
the most stable country of all those I
visited. What criticism there is against
the. government is made largely by
the communists and bolshevists on
petty internal policies. France is solid
ly behind Poincare in his foreign
policy. *
France Collecting Bad Debt
"As r see it, France in the Ruhr is
merely trying to collect a bad debt
by (he only possible means left it.
France has received practically noth
ing from Germany towards rebuilding
the war areas."
Regarding Belgium, Professor Smith
says that the poignant, question now
is the Flemish-Wallons controversy.
During the war, the Germans made a
fiasco attempt, at Flemindizing all of
Belgium, to separate them entirely
from French influence. The Flemish
speak a language derived from Dutch,
and the Wallons speak French. The
German attempt failed, but it is now
