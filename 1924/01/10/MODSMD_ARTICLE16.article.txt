## Yearlings Take Lead From Start and Steadily Pile Up Total 
###

College by a score of 28-11.
The freshmen took the lead at the
start of the game and piled up their
score steadily throughout the contest.
The San Mateo men were never dan
gerously near the lead.
Hunt used eighteen men during the
game, in an effort to find the smooth
est working combination. Price and
David both did well at forward. Riese,
who substituted at forward and later
at center, got away for several points.
The freshmen did especially well on
I defense. The San Mateo men were not
able to score a field goal until the
latter part of the third quarter when
| Tunberg managed to cage a shot from
the side line. Tunberg followed Man
i waring's shot in the final period for
another counter. With these two ex
ceptions the Babes held the San Mateo
team scoreless from the floor. The rest
I of their points came as the result of
j foul shots.
Fast Start
j The first freshman score came about
a minute after the start of the game.

as he shot. He got one of his two foul
j tries. David made the next point from

! shot. Jarvis scored the first San Mateo
: shot when a foul was called on Jayred.

good. On the next play David dribbled
| down and passed to him under the
| basket. The first quarter ended 9-2 for

foul shots and Southworth got a bas
j ket, bringing the Babe score to 17-6
