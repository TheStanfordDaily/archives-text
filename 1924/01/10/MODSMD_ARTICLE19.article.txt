About 4 o'clock in the afternoon, any afternoon the week, beehive
activities commence in a certain building on the campus. Swarms of men
run in and out, dash up and down the corridors, stand around and buzz in
groups, slam iron doors, throw shoes, and otherwise add to the commotion.
Encina gymnasium has accommodations for almost every man on the
campus. In spite of figures which say that only two-thirds of the campus
go near the place, at 4 p. m. it seems as if the entire bawl-out personnel is
on hand for some kind of activity.
Men in track suits dash out for the oval; baseball players by the dozen
clatter their cleats on the cement floor as they start for practice; swim
mers run for the pool without quite so much noise; boxers, wrestlers,
fencers and others are yelling in their training room; tennis fiends hurry
out the door and around the corner to get a court before they are all taken ;
soccer players talk over Olympic possibilities as they trail across the fields
to practice; hundreds of intramural, freshman, and varsity basketball
players start tentative dribbles on the gymnasium and pavilion floor; Bill
Brogan breaks a shoe lace; somebody wants the graduate manager on the
telephone.
Stanford's policy of athletic opportunity for all brings athletes and am
bitious athletes swarming to the beehive at 4p. m.; the product of their in
dustry is sweet both to those who want victorious varsities and to the men
who plan an educational system by which Stanford may turn out graduates
whose standards are of the highest mentally and physically.
"I will not apologize!" says Charlie. "You will so apologize!" say
A. A. U. officials. Both sides seem to overlook the fact that it is they who
should apologize, to the public whom they have disgusted by their piffling
squabbles.
Hugo, the midnight moth, dribbled the moth-ball the length of the
floor and remarked in passing that Paradise to certain people has two es
sentials: breakfast and eight o'clock classes both served in bed.
Neckties should be seen and not heard.
