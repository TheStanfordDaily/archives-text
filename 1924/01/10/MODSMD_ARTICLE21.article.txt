# University Is Saved From Flood by Woman's Bravery
## 
### 
The story of the bravery of the
Dutch child who saved Holland from
a disastrous inundation by plugging
the leak in the dyke with his finger is
paralleled by the heroism of a Stan
ford woman who today averted a simi
lar catastrophe which was threatening
the campus.
The deed was performed about 10
o'clock this morning when she braved
the terrors of a spouting water hy
drant which was gushing vigorously
in frtmt of the bookstore. She intrep
idly turned it off.
Let it not be said, either, that Stan
ford is any less appreciative than
Holland. Hearty cheers from an un
usually large gathering of roughs at
the engineering corner rewarded her
efforts.
