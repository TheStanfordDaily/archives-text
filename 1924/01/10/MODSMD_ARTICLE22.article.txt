FOR IMPROVING TRYOUT3
The method of choosing the cast for campus plays is at present all wrong.
If you want proof of this statement, ask any of those who didn't get in the
first time.
Having proved that the system is wrong, it remains to prove that a new
systemm is needed. That is very simple.
Having proved that a new system is needed, the only thing to be discussed
is whether the system here advocated is the proper one. That is easy to
decide.
Having concluded that this new system should be adopted, the only
point not yet covered is: what is this new system? Although a com
paratively unimportant point, it should receive some mention.
In the first place, it's all wrong to make the candidates for positions stand
up and r.ecite "All the world's a stage." The true test of a campus actor is:
can he (or she) carry off embarrassing moments, such as when the scenery
totters or the curtain sticks—with savoir faire, not say poise and coolness?
If he can, he is entitled to the lead.
Some suitable tests are easily devised. Take the candidate to the
Women's Clubhouse and stuff his ears full of cotton. When the music
stops, he, not knowing it has ceased, will dance right on. Then sud
denly remove the cotton. If he smiles and asks for the next dance, he
is suitable material for the lead in any play, with the possible exception
of the "Will Shakespeare" type.
For this kind of play, a more severe test may well be devised. Announce an
awards assembly. Call the candidate up to the platform, and present him
with a watch fob in token of the University's appreciation of his activities in
trying out for the drama. If he accepts with thanks, Will Srakespeare or
anything else will be easy to him.

Wid all do apologies to the gum drop at runs the "I'll Seat," I craves to
rave about the sellaloyed jubilee I sit through up to the Grandady movie
show in Frisco.
Twas the night before New Year's Eve, and about curfew time I breezes
in with a Loge ticket, mind ya, figurin as how all the early birds has got
their seats. They was a gang lined up four deep and a mile long waitin for
balcony space, and I gives em all the merry go by.
I arrives in the balcony lobby. They was an awful mob, but I put my
money on the blue and saunters up majestic to a little Alice and hands her
the little red stub. She looks at me as if I was some kind of a stray dog,
and hands me another ticket with neat little numbers 101 writ thereon. I
asks her where I cashes this one in, and she puts on a telephone operator
tone and tells me to park down at the last Isle to the right.
I stands around kind of dumb for a whiles, when I finely gets on. Little
Uultrymarine yodles "Loges five to ten." I looks at my ticket again to be
sure at they was no mistake, and settles down for a nice long wait. I got it.
Spite of all the gabbin that was burstin forth real careless around, I got in
some sleep. I wakes u pto the tune of "Loges fifty-five to sixty." Well,
things progressed. After ten cigarettes had passed, and the last show started,
the oosherette had counted up to a hundred.
I grabs my coat real excited and lines up close so as not to miss any number
at all. But that little girl surely was stupid. Seems as how she had forgot
how to count beyond the century mark, and whilest she was learnin how, the
last show kept gettin nearer and nearer the final curtain. At last she
vociferates the necessary numerals, and I dashes through the velvet for the
last alley to the right.
But all was not yet. They was a mob in that isle that made the balcony
bunch look like a Ford meeting in a synagogue.
I got in range of the stage just in time to pipe Dorothy De Dore doing a
juvenile with Saul Ashes. She admits real graceful that she's a movie
( queen, and as far as I could see she looked the part. But she rooned it all
with try in to sing. The management must a framed her into telling fans that
she had a terrible cold. Well, if she didn't have a cold, I'd hate to here her
when she did. She sang that little ditty about "Somebody's Rong." Somebody
was.
As for the feature, I been tryin to feature it ever since. Five reels of Dom
Poor in the "Big Brother." It sure was a sleep producer when the guardeen
puts the boy to bed at "one in the evening."
