# Americans Great Travelers; Pay Little Attention To Costs
## 
### 
Americans are the greatest travelers
on earth, and it is the Americans who
have brought about the degree of
luxurious comfort which is to be found
in foreign travel all over the world
if we accept the opinion of Joseph L.
Young, general manager of the Cook
and Son travel agency.
"The American traveler does not
question so small a subject as 'price'
in his world wanderings. He is willing
to pay well for the luxury he demands.
"Fifty years ago," says Young, "we
took out small groups of tourists, for
a trip across the Atlantic was quite
an adventure then. As to a journey to
the more remote parts of the world,
that was a life event which came to
very few.
Travel Cheaper
"Travel was cheaper, though, in the
old days, for $80 in gold would carry
one across the ocean in the best of
style to be had on a nine-day to two
v/eeks trip in vessels only one-ninth
the size of those today. Letters of
credit were unknown, and every care
ful traveler hid his gold in securely
fastened money belts.
"The iirst party we took to Egypt
and Palestine," says Cook's manager,

"was made up of Masons. That was in
1874, and it was not until three years
later that we booked a party of tour
ists up the Nile. The first around-the
world tour set out in 1873. There were
but ten persons in the party. It took
eight months to make the trip. The
average cost to an individual for the
long trip was $500.
Whole Ship Chartered
"Compare this with the travel of
today. A whale monstrous ship is char
tered, and the travel party consists
of 500 to 600 instead of the original
ten. And in 130 days as much is seen
as in the eight months of the earlier
trip.
"In 1923 it is estimated that Ameri
can tourists in Europe spent $360,000,-
000 to $500,000,000. The average tour
ist spends $1270 abroad.
"In spite of the vast increase of
\ravel trade, the new Cook quarters
in New York have a much scanter
space in front of the counter. This is
another sign of the change of the
times," says Young, "for the hooped
and bustled women of former days re
quired much more standing room when
they came to make arrangements for
the momentous trip across the seas."
