# David Starr Jordan to Discuss Europe Tonight
## 
### 
"Conditions in Europe" will be dis
cussed by Dr. Jordan at his new home,
Serra house, tonight at 7:30. The eco
nomic, moral, and political troubles of
Europe will be reviewed.
"Economic conditions are bad," says
Dr. Jordan, "and they make all others
bad, especially in Germany where
money values have been destroyed and
bank deposits made impossible. This
situation has an unhappy moral effect
on the people. There is no desire to
save, and the people spend madly the
earnings of each day, lest on the mor
row the value should have decreased.
"There will be 110 stability for Ger
many, unless the nations will agree to
give her a start. If the United States
would enter the League of Nations, it
would aid Germany and the other na
tions of Europe materially. I believe
the American people are in favor of
the League and if it were put to a
popular vote we would enter it."
