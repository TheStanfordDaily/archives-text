# STANFORD THANKED FOR RECENT HELP IN JAPANESE DISASTER
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur of
Stanford University has received a
letter from the president of the Tokyo
Imperial University expressing his
grateful appreciation of Stanford's
prompt response to the appeal that
was sent out for aid in rehabilitating
the Japanese institution's library
which was completely destroyed in the
fire which followed the earthquake of
September 1.
President Wilbur notified the Japa
nese president that Stanford would
send copies of all the Stanford Uni
versity publications as well as 500
other volumes from Stanford's dupli
cate collections.
"When your despatch of books will
reach here," the Japanese educator
wrote, "they will fill the new shelves
and be remembered as one of the first
gifts of great importance coming
across the sea soon after the great
loss we have sustained." Later in his
letter he says, "I have also the pleas
ure to inform you that sympathetic
helps are coming from all sides and
now we may hope with confidence a
speedy recovery of our loss."
The library of the Tokyo Imperial
University contained 500,000 volumes,
and in his appeal to sister universities
throughout the world the president
said it was hoped to gather at least
a tenth of that number in as short a
time as possible. Some parts of the
Tokyo collection cannot be replaced.
When George T. Clark, the Stanford
librarian, visited the Japanese univer
sity during a tour of the world gather
ing material for the Stanford library a
few years ago he was shown docu
ments in the Tokyo collection dating
back a thousand years and not in ex
istence elsewhere.
