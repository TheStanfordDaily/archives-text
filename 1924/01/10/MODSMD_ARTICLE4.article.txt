# Canines Register And Are Pledged By Two Sororities
## 
### 
Among the new people matriculat
ing in the University last week were
two members of the canine species,
Jerry and Benny Airdale. Owing to
the lack of rooms in Roble, the two
entries were allowed to move at once
into the groups with which they were
previously affiliated and are now re
siding at the Delta Delta Delta and
Pi Beta Phi houses respectively.
The sisters report that the new
pledges are great additions to the
houses and have disturbed the peace
only twice, when they howl lustily
throughout the night. This is not un
usual among pledges, it is said.
Jerry and Benny display a prefer
ence for masculine company and fol
low every pair of cords that passes
their kennels, the Pi Phi's pup spend
ing most of his time at the A. T. O.
house. This also is said to be not
unusual.
