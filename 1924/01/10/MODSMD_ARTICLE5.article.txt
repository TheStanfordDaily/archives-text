## Varied Program Will Be Given By Trio of Musicians In Assembly Hall 
### 
According to the custom of the |
Griffes Group, a composition by j
Charles T. Griffes will be included in j
the program which they are to present

sembly hall.

Steeb, pianist; Sascha Jacobinoff, vio-,
linist, and Lucy Gates, soprano. Miss ,
Gates is substituting for Edna Thomas, |

Griffes was a young American com
poser, recently deceased. Out of ad
miration for his work, this trio of
musicians took his name and give one ;
of his pieces in each program. "The
Lake at Evening," an impressionistic |
study, is the number selected for the
concert tonight. Tliiy' is the only piece
by an American composer on the pro
gram.
Deßussy's Sonata is a work of the
modern .French school, while "Una
Voce Poco Fa," from Rossini's Barber

atic style. Lucy Gates, who will sing
the latter, iias appeared at Stanford
before, with the Barrere Trio.
"La Campanella" is a Liszt trans
cription of a Paginini etude for the
violin. The piece is very brilliant and,
as the name, which means Little Bells,
implies, it represents chiming bells.
Olga Steeb, the pianist of the group,
has been described as a remarkable
musician, and is a native of California.
Chanson Indoue is one of the most
familiar of the works on the program.
Although many people do not know it
by name, not only is the original com
position often heard, but the theme is
used in many modern dance pieces.
Sarate's Gypsy Airs, one of the vio
lin numbers to be given by Sascha
Jacoblnoff, is similar to the collection
of gypsy melodies by the same com
poser played in the Laraia-Hughes re
cital presented here before Christmas,
and is full of the imaginative quality
which distinguishes Sarate's work.

Faculty recreative exercise is be
coming one of the big things that the
Department of Physical Education is

gon campus. Over fifty per cent of the
faculty are engaged in some sort of
recreative activity.

sembly hall.
The Griffes Trio is composed of Olga
Steeb, pianist; Sascha Jacobinoff, vio-,
linist, and Lucy Gates, soprano. Miss ,
Gates is substituting for Edna Thomas, |
who is ill.
Griffes was a young American com
poser, recently deceased. Out of ad
miration for his work, this trio of
musicians took his name and give one ;
of his pieces in each program. "The
Lake at Evening," an impressionistic |
study, is the number selected for the
concert tonight. Tliiy' is the only piece
by an American composer on the pro
gram.
Deßussy's Sonata is a work of the
modern .French school, while "Una
Voce Poco Fa," from Rossini's Barber
of Seville, is of the old Italian oper
atic style. Lucy Gates, who will sing
the latter, iias appeared at Stanford
before, with the Barrere Trio.
"La Campanella" is a Liszt trans
cription of a Paginini etude for the
violin. The piece is very brilliant and,
as the name, which means Little Bells,
implies, it represents chiming bells.
Olga Steeb, the pianist of the group,
has been described as a remarkable
musician, and is a native of California.
Chanson Indoue is one of the most
familiar of the works on the program.
Although many people do not know it
by name, not only is the original com
position often heard, but the theme is
used in many modern dance pieces.
Sarate's Gypsy Airs, one of the vio
lin numbers to be given by Sascha
Jacoblnoff, is similar to the collection
of gypsy melodies by the same com
poser played in the Laraia-Hughes re
cital presented here before Christmas,
and is full of the imaginative quality
which distinguishes Sarate's work.

Faculty recreative exercise is be
coming one of the big things that the
Department of Physical Education is
forwarding on the University of Ore
gon campus. Over fifty per cent of the
faculty are engaged in some sort of
recreative activity.
