# FINALS IN BOXING TOURNAMENT TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 8
## Preliminary Elimination Contests Will Start on January 28 
### 
Final bouts to determine the Uni
versity boxing champions in each of
the eight weights open for competition
will be held in Encina gymnasium on
Friday, February 8.
Preliminary elimination bouts will
start on Monday. January 28, and con
tinue until the end of the week when
all but two contestants in each weight
will have been eliminated. One week
will then be allowed to permit the men
to get into the best of condition before
the finals take place.
A tentative date of February 15 has
been set for a boxing match with
Davis Farm here at Stanford. The
men winning the intramural elimina

They are: Featherweight, 119 lbs.
and under; bantamweight, 119 to 127

ior welterweight, 144 to 154 lbs.; mid
dleweight, 154 to 166 lbs.; light heavy
weight, 166 to 179 lbs.; and heavy
weight, over 179 lbs.

packer fights in the 145-lb. class but
last year was. in competition with
Adams who had a little the better of
the deal throughout the season.
This year Adams is heavier though
in good condition, and by advancing
the 155-lb. class will be in competi
