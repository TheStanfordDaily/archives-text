# FINALS IN BOXING TOURNAMENT TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 8
## Preliminary Elimination Contests Will Start on January 28 
### 
Final bouts to determine the Uni
versity boxing champions in each of
the eight weights open for competition
will be held in Encina gymnasium on
Friday, February 8.
Preliminary elimination bouts will
start on Monday. January 28, and con
tinue until the end of the week when
all but two contestants in each weight
will have been eliminated. One week
will then be allowed to permit the men
to get into the best of condition before
the finals take place.
A tentative date of February 15 has
been set for a boxing match with
Davis Farm here at Stanford. The
men winning the intramural elimina
tion contests will represent the Uni
versity in these bouts, providing they
are not freshmen or others ineligible
for ■ varsity competition.
Due to the fact that there are a
number of men in the different
weights, especially in the lightweight,
welterweight, and middleweight class
es, who will have difficulty in making
the correct weight this early in the
season, intermediate weights have
been arranged.
Instead of the seven regular boxing
weights adopted and used in Pacific
Coast Conference boxing tournaments,
eight weights will be used in the in
tramural competition. .
They are: Featherweight, 119 lbs.
and under; bantamweight, 119 to 127
lbs.; lightweight, 127 to 135 lbs.; jun
ior welterweight, 135 to 144 lbs.; sen
ior welterweight, 144 to 154 lbs.; mid
dleweight, 154 to 166 lbs.; light heavy
weight, 166 to 179 lbs.; and heavy
weight, over 179 lbs.
The greatest difficulty in weights
occurs between 143 and 155 lbs. Penny
packer fights in the 145-lb. class but
last year was. in competition with
Adams who had a little the better of
the deal throughout the season.
This year Adams is heavier though
in good condition, and by advancing
the 155-lb. class will be in competi
tion with Irwin. Irwin, however,
weighs in now at 152 lbs. and can prob
ably reduce to the 145-lb. class which
allows a 3-lb. margin for overweight.
Hall fought in the lightweight class
after Ross left school and
Circle "S" in that weight. This year
he is also heavier and must fight in
the welterweight class, thus forcing
competition into a keenly-contested
triangle with Irwin and Pennypacker.
All University students are eligible
for competition in the intramural
meet, as long as they are registered
for work here. Freshmen, transfers,
regular students, or varsity boxers
can all take part in the contests.
Medals will be awarded the winners
of the different weights by former
Stanford boxers who have won laurels
in their respective classes. The awards
will be made after the finals on Feb
ruary 8.

to captain the Washington State Col

They are: Featherweight, 119 lbs.
and under; bantamweight, 119 to 127
lbs.; lightweight, 127 to 135 lbs.; jun
ior welterweight, 135 to 144 lbs.; sen
ior welterweight, 144 to 154 lbs.; mid
dleweight, 154 to 166 lbs.; light heavy
weight, 166 to 179 lbs.; and heavy
weight, over 179 lbs.
The greatest difficulty in weights
occurs between 143 and 155 lbs. Penny
packer fights in the 145-lb. class but
last year was. in competition with
Adams who had a little the better of
the deal throughout the season.
This year Adams is heavier though
in good condition, and by advancing
the 155-lb. class will be in competi
tion with Irwin. Irwin, however,
weighs in now at 152 lbs. and can prob
ably reduce to the 145-lb. class which
allows a 3-lb. margin for overweight.
Hall fought in the lightweight class
after Ross left school and
Circle "S" in that weight. This year
he is also heavier and must fight in
the welterweight class, thus forcing
competition into a keenly-contested
triangle with Irwin and Pennypacker.
All University students are eligible
for competition in the intramural
meet, as long as they are registered
for work here. Freshmen, transfers,
regular students, or varsity boxers
can all take part in the contests.
Medals will be awarded the winners
of the different weights by former
Stanford boxers who have won laurels
in their respective classes. The awards
will be made after the finals on Feb
ruary 8.

Joe Burks, center, has been elected
to captain the Washington State Col
lege grid team for 1924.
Final bouts to determine the Uni
versity boxing champions in each of
the eight weights open for competition
will be held in Encina gymnasium on
Friday, February 8.
Preliminary elimination bouts will
start on Monday. January 28, and con
tinue until the end of the week when
all but two contestants in each weight
will have been eliminated. One week
will then be allowed to permit the men
to get into the best of condition before
the finals take place.
A tentative date of February 15 has
been set for a boxing match with
Davis Farm here at Stanford. The
men winning the intramural elimina
tion contests will represent the Uni
versity in these bouts, providing they
are not freshmen or others ineligible
for ■ varsity competition.
Due to the fact that there are a
number of men in the different
weights, especially in the lightweight,
welterweight, and middleweight class
es, who will have difficulty in making
the correct weight this early in the
season, intermediate weights have
been arranged.
Instead of the seven regular boxing
weights adopted and used in Pacific
Coast Conference boxing tournaments,
eight weights will be used in the in
tramural competition. .
They are: Featherweight, 119 lbs.
and under; bantamweight, 119 to 127
lbs.; lightweight, 127 to 135 lbs.; jun
