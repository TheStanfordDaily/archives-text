Encina Shows Team Work
In the past, hall teams have stood
little show against club or fraternity
fives that have played together before,
but the Encina second floor men over
came their handicap in their game
with the Panthers and displayed a
little team work.
The contest opened at a fairly fast
pace, but neither five could keep the
ball in its territory long enough to
score often. The half ended 8-5 with
the freshmen leading through the fast
work of George, Blazier, and Hanley.
Beginning the second period, the
ball was again worked up and down
the floor but the Encina squad dis
played a more accurate eye for the
basket and took the lead early. Kel
log scored the lone field goal for the!
Panthers, while Hanley and Blazier
"helped to make the final Encina win
of 14 to 7.
Dekes Show Fight
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon struggled through a j
slow game which the former finally,
won 11-6. However, though the floor-:
work of neither was of the lightning
variety, both fought hard for their
points and the half ended 7-2 after j
good work for the Dekes by Ogden and
Welch.
Beginning the second half, the Deke j
added more team-work to their tight |
and increased their lead slowly, at j
the same time allowing S. A. E. but 1
four more points, winning the game;
11 to 6.
Nolan proved himself a fast guard
and Ogden and Welch accounted for a j
majority of the Deke's points.
Mathews scored the lone goal for 1
S. A. E.'s in the first half, and Gibbons
the four points tallied for them in 1
the second period.
