### 
Another hall team won against a
club five in yesterday's play of the
intramural basketball tournament,
when Eneina second floor beat the
Panthers, 14 to 7.
The other winners of the day were:
Delta Tau Delta, Delta Kappa Epsilon,
and Chi Psi.
Encina Shows Team Work
In the past, hall teams have stood
little show against club or fraternity
fives that have played together before,
but the Encina second floor men over
came their handicap in their game
with the Panthers and displayed a
little team work.
The contest opened at a fairly fast
pace, but neither five could keep the
ball in its territory long enough to
score often. The half ended 8-5 with
the freshmen leading through the fast
work of George, Blazier, and Hanley.
Beginning the second period, the
ball was again worked up and down
the floor but the Encina squad dis
played a more accurate eye for the
basket and took the lead early. Kel
log scored the lone field goal for the!
Panthers, while Hanley and Blazier
"helped to make the final Encina win
of 14 to 7.
Dekes Show Fight
Delta Kappa Epsilon and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon struggled through a j
slow game which the former finally,
won 11-6. However, though the floor-:
work of neither was of the lightning
variety, both fought hard for their
points and the half ended 7-2 after j
good work for the Dekes by Ogden and
Welch.
Beginning the second half, the Deke j
added more team-work to their tight |
and increased their lead slowly, at j
the same time allowing S. A. E. but 1
four more points, winning the game;
11 to 6.
Nolan proved himself a fast guard
and Ogden and Welch accounted for a j
majority of the Deke's points.
Mathews scored the lone goal for 1
S. A. E.'s in the first half, and Gibbons
the four points tallied for them in 1
the second period.
Delt-Alpha Delt Game Fast
Colgan, for Delta Tau Delta, opened
the Delt-Alpha Delta Phi contest with
a long throw from center. The Delta
Taus were able to score only once
more, however, against the strong
Alpha Delt defense, while the latter
counted four points by Phelps and
Pollard.
Both squads played hard and fast
but had a tendency to dribble rather
than pass and lost the ball frequently.
The half ended 4-4.
Basket Hard to Find
The second half began at a fast pace
with an improvement in team-work
but neither quintet could find the bas
ket for five minutes. Collett put Delta
Tau in the lead finally, however, and
de Bach and Phelps followed, scoring
alternately. Collett, aided by de Bach
and Colgan, saved the game for the
Delta Tau by accounting for one more
goal, and they won by a 11-9 count.
For Alpha Delt, Neer, Pollard, and
Phelps played a good defensive game.
Both fives were well-matched in the
Alpha Tau Omega-Chi Psi contest and
played a good open game. Much pass
ing was tried but the mark was not
always found and the game developed
into an up-and-down-tlie-floor contest.
A good many shots were tried, but the
basket could not be found by either
five in proportion to the attempts, and
the half ended 8-5.
Chi Psi's Run Up Lead
Both quintets improved their game
the second half and played hard and
fast. The A. T. O.'s, however, could
keep the ball only a short time, while
Chi Psi played a good offense and ran
up a good lead.
Chi Psi, through the efforts of King
and Hays, increased its lead and won
17-9.
Phelps and Stratton showed up well
on offense for the A. T. O's.
