# Masquers Women Have Good Record In Dramatic Work
## 
### 
"Milestones," the forthcoming dra
matic production by Arnold Bennett,
brings into the limelight one of the
well-known women's organizations of
the campusâ€”Masquers, an honorary
dramatic society. It is made up en
tirely of women who have proved their
ability in the line of acting, playwrit
ing, or play directing.
Headed by Edythe Baylis, who has
taken important parts in a number of
campus productions such as "Upon a
Ladder," last year's Junior Opera, and
"You Never Can Tell," every member
of the organization stands out in dra
matic prominence.
Attainments Are Varied.
A brief summary of their attain
ments would read something like this:
Chrysella Dunker. stage settings and
art direction; Evelyn Van Horn, lead
in "Three Live Ghosts;" Helen Whit
ney, Junior Opera, "You Never Can
Tell, and "If I Were King;" Alice
Dodds, music writer for operas; For
esta Hodgson, Junior Opera and
"Three Live Ghosts;" Augusta Corey,
"The Charm Girl;" Margaret Bailie,
co-director Women's Pageant, and
Margaret Richardson, two Junior
Operas, and lead in last year's Masquers
play, "He Who Gets Slapped."
Changing the policy of the organiza
tion in the last few years, the Masquers
have become exceedingly liberal to
wards the campus regarding the
choosing of characters. Formerly, the
women characters for the society's an
nual production were chosen only from
among the Masquers themselves, but
of late all women students have been
eligible for parts.
