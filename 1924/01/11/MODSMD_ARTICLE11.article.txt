# BASKET SHOOTING CONTEST ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
A basketball shooting contest is the
newest thing to be announced by
Charles W. Davis, director of intra
mural sports. The contest will take
place Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs
day of next week and all men in the
University are eligible to take part.
The shots will be taken from the
foul line, and the six men making the
highest scores will compete in the
finals. The winner of the finals will be
given some suitable award, the nature
of which has not been announced.
The reason for holding the contest is
to interest intra-mural basketball play
ers in accurate foul shooting. The new
rules this season make it necessary for
each man to be able to score consist
ently from the foul line, and the con
test is expected to interest men in prac
ticing this part of basketball.
