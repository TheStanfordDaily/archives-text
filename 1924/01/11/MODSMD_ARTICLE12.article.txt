# OLYMPICS HAVE STRONG COURT FIVE
## INVADERS PROMISE CARDINALS STIFF CONTEST TOMORROW Cards Have Slight Edge on Winged "O" Team Despite Experience Of Penaluna's Veterans 
### David Meiklejohn 
Notwithstanding the fact that Coach Ed Penaluna boasts more basketball
material than he knows what to do with, the Cardinal quintet enters the con
test with the Winged "O" aggregation in the pavilion tomorrow night, the
odds slightly in its fabor, because this is the Olympics' first game ot' the
season.
The game is scheduled to start promptly at 8 o'clock after the freshman
preliminary game.
The odds are so slight, however, that the experience of the Winged "O"
five might easily outweigh superior team work on the part of Stanford.
Panaluna has three veterans on his team who are in every sense of the word
basketball players. Lauterwasser has bolstered the scoring total of more

>than one Olympic victory.
Clubmen After Revenge
This veteran has witnessed two
dousing Stanford victories against the
Club team and if there is any chance
for the Olympics to reap revenge no
one will be more responsible or tena
cious in his eorts than Penaluna's
mainstay.
Boyle, playing at center for the
Club, is noted for his long shots, and
his passing ability. Begley, who will
probably play the other forward post,
recently saw action with the St. Igna
tius five which boasts a big array or
basketball stars. Begley played on the
Saint quintet which all but defeated
Stanford last year, and was one of
the most consistent scorers in the
line-up.
Cards Have Stars, Too
Speaking of strong forwards and
centers, Stanford boasts a few of her
own. With Ernie Nevers and "Nip"
McHose on the Card offensive the
Olympic Club will have a few worries
to ponder over. McHose proved against
the College of the Pacific that he has
not lost a great deal of his old time
form in planting the ball in the cage
when the occasion demands. He pos
sesses all the quickness and agility of
Lauterwasser and more than an even
break when it comes to scoring.
Ernie Nevers has a heavy edge over
any candidate 011 the Card five for
the other forward job. and promises
to keep it for some time. Two hun
dred pounds of beef dribbling down
the court will make any guard look
for an opening. Nevers believes in the
commendable policy of waiting until
he is under the basket before attempt
ing to shoot.
Steele Is All Form
And centers —Boyle will have more
than the lion's share when he jumps
against Gurdon Steele Saturday night.
Steele was a susprise to almost every
one in the College of the Pacific con
test. But his work was far from being >
accidental. There is such a thing as
form and accident, and Steele was all
form. It will be a treat to watch the
pair pitted against each other.
If Mcßurney keeps up the good work
there will be little more worry about
a running guard to fit into the Card
machine. It is a hard job to play both
on defensive and offensive. Ray han
dled the job beyond criticism against
"Swede" Righter's Tigers. Mcßurney's
real test will come tomorrow against
much stronger and more skilled com
petition.
Oliva Formidable Guard
A word might be said in passing on
the way Dave Oliva handles himself
at the standing guard post. It would
not be stretching facts too much to
say that Oliva is one of the most
formidable guards on the Pacific
Coast. He has the height and the
"weight. He is all over the court and
apparently not a play seems to get by
the watchful eyes of the Card defense
star.
The probable line-up for the game
is: McHose and Nevers at forwards,
Steele at center, Oliva and Mcßurney,
guards.
