# LIGHTWEIGHT HOOP SQUAD ENCOUNTERS SAN JOSE TONIGHT
## Quartet of Veterans Form Mainstay of Thornhill's 130-Pound Five 
### 
Coach Tiny Thornhill's 130-pound
quintet opens the season at 7 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion against the fast
130's of San Jose High school.
With four members of last year's
team, which overcame all opposition
and trounced California, back in har
ness there is every reason to expect
another banner year for the light
weights. Hence, tonight's encounter
will be more in the nature of a workout
for the men and will give Thornhill a
line on the strength of his reserves. It
will expose any rough spots which may
be present and give him a chance to
eliminate them before they become
serious.
