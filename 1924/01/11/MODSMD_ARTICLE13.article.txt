# LIGHTWEIGHT HOOP SQUAD ENCOUNTERS SAN JOSE TONIGHT
## Quartet of Veterans Form Mainstay of Thornhill's 130-Pound Five 
### 
Coach Tiny Thornhill's 130-pound
quintet opens the season at 7 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion against the fast
130's of San Jose High school.
With four members of last year's
team, which overcame all opposition
and trounced California, back in har
ness there is every reason to expect
another banner year for the light
weights. Hence, tonight's encounter
will be more in the nature of a workout
for the men and will give Thornhill a
line on the strength of his reserves. It
will expose any rough spots which may
be present and give him a chance to
eliminate them before they become
serious.
Young and Blosser Back.
Young, 1923 manager, and Blosser
will be back in their old places at for
ward. These fellows have had a whole
season to develop ability at finding the
basket and are a mighty hard pair to
stop when they get going.
Captain Meyer and Hobro form a de
fensive combination that is well nigh
impregnable, and have a tendency for
shooting goals when they get a chance
that has a good elevating influence on
the score.
Only One Veteran Not Back.
Shaw, last year's center, is the only
member of the old aggregation not on
hand, but there are a number of new
men who have shown up well in prac
tice. Several will probably be given a
chance to show thir stuff against com
petition in order that a permanent as
signment may be made.
The tentative schedule for the rest of
the season is as follows:
Jan. 16—Palo Alto High 130's.
Jan. 23—San Jose Y. M. C. A. 130's.
Feb. 13—California 130's at Berkeley.
Feb. 20—California 130's at Stanford.
If necessary a third game of the
California series will be played here,
but as last year's five trimmed the
Berkeleyites, 25-23 and 28-15, and four
of the Cardinal five are back on the
job. such a necessity will probably not
arise.

Residents of the Panama canal zone
must have permits to maintain gar
dens.

serious.
Young and Blosser Back.
Young, 1923 manager, and Blosser
will be back in their old places at for
ward. These fellows have had a whole
season to develop ability at finding the
basket and are a mighty hard pair to
stop when they get going.
Captain Meyer and Hobro form a de
fensive combination that is well nigh
impregnable, and have a tendency for
shooting goals when they get a chance
that has a good elevating influence on
the score.
Only One Veteran Not Back.
Shaw, last year's center, is the only
member of the old aggregation not on
hand, but there are a number of new
men who have shown up well in prac
tice. Several will probably be given a
chance to show thir stuff against com
petition in order that a permanent as
signment may be made.
The tentative schedule for the rest of
the season is as follows:
Jan. 16—Palo Alto High 130's.
Jan. 23—San Jose Y. M. C. A. 130's.
Feb. 13—California 130's at Berkeley.
Feb. 20—California 130's at Stanford.
If necessary a third game of the
California series will be played here,
but as last year's five trimmed the
Berkeleyites, 25-23 and 28-15, and four
of the Cardinal five are back on the
job. such a necessity will probably not
arise.

Residents of the Panama canal zone
must have permits to maintain gar
dens.
Coach Tiny Thornhill's 130-pound
quintet opens the season at 7 o'clock
tonight in the Pavilion against the fast
130's of San Jose High school.
With four members of last year's
team, which overcame all opposition
and trounced California, back in har
ness there is every reason to expect
another banner year for the light
weights. Hence, tonight's encounter
will be more in the nature of a workout
for the men and will give Thornhill a
line on the strength of his reserves. It
will expose any rough spots which may
be present and give him a chance to
eliminate them before they become
serious.
