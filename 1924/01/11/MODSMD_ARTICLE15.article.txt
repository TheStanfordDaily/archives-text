# SIX SELECTED FOR TRI-STATE DEBATE CONTESTS MARCH 9
## 
### 
Six men were selected yesterday to
represent Stanford in the Tri-State de
bate scheduled for March 9 between
Stanford, Washington and Oregon on
the question "Should the United States
Join the World Court?"
George Crocker and Tercy Spencer
will take the affirmative side of the
question in the debate at Stanford with
Oregon. Ronald Button and Robert
Lewis will represent Stanford at Seat
tle in the debate with Washington, the
Stanford men taking the negative.
Hugh Lindsey and Louis Jaffe were
selected as alternates.
The tryouts held yesterday in the
Little Theatre were the biggest in local
debating activities for several years.
Professor J. G. Emerson, debating
coach, believes that the large number
present yesterday is evidence of in
creasing interest in debating at Stan
ford. It is probable that an increase
will be made in the number of debates
scheduled for this year.
The men selected for the Tri-State
debate will start at once preparing
their material for presentation on
March 9.
