# The 						First Threat

### 
Al)out a week ago a story appeared on the sporting page of one of the
San Francisco papers announcing that the Olympic Club basketball team
had one of the best fives on the coast, and was already contemplating the
national amateur championship. Followed long explanations of just why
the team was so good, written in a style which seemed to indicate that the
author was at least an honorary member of the organization.
The Olympic Club undoubtedly has one of the strongest teams it has
put on a court in many years. Coach Penaluna is counting on Lauter
wasser, forward, and Boyle, center, both veterans, and both stars, to crash
the Card defenses so flat that memories of Stanford victories for three
years straight will be jarred off the records.
Against this team, which already looks forward towards a national
title, is the new, unhonored, and unsung Stanford varsity, composed of
five good men and a few substitutes. None of the five are stars, none are
expecting a nation to bow before thin, and only two are much experienced.
But this squad, under Kerr's coaching, is playing a team game, fighting
hard, and in condition to take all the punishment any other team can offer.
The game tomorrow is the first test of the varsity against real rivals.
If the gang can make it four straight against the Winged "O," much
cheers will ensue; if they keep the clubmen on the jump, also excellent; if
they play the kind of game that a Stanford team should play early in the
season, every one will be satisfied.
Tomorrow's tilt is not merely the old line-up of brains and experience
vs. youth, teamwork, and training, but is a chance for the first blow to be
delivered by a team of unknown power at another team whose strength
leads them to hope for an unbroken list of victories up to the national
finals.

Plans for the fountain in the Union court call for a centerpiece in the
shape of a wine-glass; it has been suggested that benches be placed around
the fountain in the shape of pretzels.
