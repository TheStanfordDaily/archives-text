# SHAKE HANDS!

At a recent conference a friendly
professor extended his hand to a dele
gate in an effort to make the stranger
feel comfortable and at home. He
was embarrassed when the delegate
ignored this advance and merely nod
ded her head.
Every day this incident occurs many
times, causing much embarrassment
and confusion for both parties. Often
it happens through carelessness or
thoughtlessness. It occurs not only
when dealing with outsiders, but with
university students. Many who Bhake
hands do it so limply that the person
who is just meeting them receives a
poor impression.
Although shaking hands at the time
of introduction, or upon meeting a
friend is not the proper thing to do in
all places, long practice has made it
the custom in the university. Certain
ly one of the first things that a person
coming to the university should learn,
if he has not learned it before, is to
shake hands properly, for "by your
handshake you shall be judged."
