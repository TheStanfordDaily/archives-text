# CHEATING THEMSELVES
## 
### 
IVashington Univcrsity
Cheating themselves of their man
hood and their womanhood, of their
self-respect and the respect of others.
Cheating themselves of all the good
to be gotten out of their college career,
of the knowledge and character con
struction to be gotten out of hard, hon
est work, i
Cheating themselves of their sense
of moral values, of their ability to
sense the difference between right and
wrong, of the qualities that go to
make up good citizens.
Cheating themselves of the training
essential to life's battle when they
leave college; of the good sportsman
ship innate in every man; of the
ability to stand up under hard knocks.
Enforcement of the honor code!
Just why it should be necessary to
hold the club of "enforcement" over
the heads of would-be cheaters is
more or less of a mystery. If they
only realized that in cheating they in
jure 110 one but themselves, every stu
dent would become his own enforcing
agency.
Whom does the cheater injure? The
faculty? Their paychecks continue no
matter how many cheat. His fellow
students? Hardly, unless they're too
weak to withstand a bad example.
The cheater can only injure himself,
then, and those dear to him who ex
pect great things of him. In cheating,
he cheats only himself.

More than half the oil produced in
Europe to date has come from an area
of less than fifty square miles.
