KABBAGES' KLAN CONTEST
Were You Raised In A Klannery?
If So Take This Chance
In order to foster the old spirit of get-up-and-go in our new organization,
Kabbages anounces a series of prizes, lo be won as follows, by the Kampus
Klansmen:
1. For the most practical hood, considering cheapness and availability.
Flour-sacks, table-cloths, laundry-bags, and Ford tops barred. Prize: Two
buckets of tar, with brush, and a job as track-walker.
2. For the best slogan—such as "I'd Walk A Mile For A Klammel," "You
Klan If You Say You Klan," or "Are You A Ku-Ku Yet?" Prize: Fifty unsigned
poison-pen letters, unassorted.
♦ * *
There seems little real danger to fear, however, unless the Klux gets
control of campus spelling ... or the Daily Palo Alto. Imagine a news
item:
"Konrad K. Kavendish had his kollarbone krushed yesterday in a
kollision between his Kadillac and a street-kar, near the korner of
Kowper St. A krowd of kurious spectators krammed the streets as
Kavendish was karried away, ..Kavendish was certainly kareful enough,
say kountless onlookers. He was registered on the kampus, and his
kurrikulum inkluded khemistry and kontrakts. This katastrophe is
likely to rekast his kareer. Kareful, Konrad, Kareful!"
* * ♦
There's one thing to it: a •
few burnings at the stake
here and there would cer
tainly prove popular these
cold mornings. We know
quite a few who would be
willing victims about 7 a. m.
when they cut their feet on
the icicles in the shower
room.
Minutes of meeting: Ku Klux Klan, Stanford Kouncil:
Kleagle K , presiding. Ritual read. Open motto—"Think what we

buckets of tar, with brush, and a job as track-walker.
2. For the best slogan—such as "I'd Walk A Mile For A Klammel," "You
Klan If You Say You Klan," or "Are You A Ku-Ku Yet?" Prize: Fifty unsigned
poison-pen letters, unassorted.

There seems little real danger to fear, however, unless the Klux gets
control of campus spelling ... or the Daily Palo Alto. Imagine a news
item:
"Konrad K. Kavendish had his kollarbone krushed yesterday in a
kollision between his Kadillac and a street-kar, near the korner of
Kowper St. A krowd of kurious spectators krammed the streets as
Kavendish was karried away, ..Kavendish was certainly kareful enough,
say kountless onlookers. He was registered on the kampus, and his
kurrikulum inkluded khemistry and kontrakts. This katastrophe is
likely to rekast his kareer. Kareful, Konrad, Kareful!"
