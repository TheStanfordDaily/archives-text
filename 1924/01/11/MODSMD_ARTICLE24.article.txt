The celluloid "Six' Days," at any
rate, is no worse than the original
story as sold under Elinor Glynn's
name in novel form. It is playing at
the Varsity theater. At the time of
the first printing the publishers had
the opportunity of characterizing the
plot as daringly original. It seemed so
to us, at the time. We regret to say,
however half-heartedly, that other and
better pornographers have been dis
covered among both the ancients and
moderns since.
Considering the appalling number
of pamphlets of the nature of Whiz
Bang, we predict a great run for this
cinema shocker. If the producers could
have induced Avery Hopwood to in
troduce a few sub-titles of snappy
comedy gags to relieve the excruciat
ing tension on the well-known with
ers, the profits might have gone even
bigger. This is unofficial.
The Great War has been introduced
into the film, a change which is not out
of accord with the spirit of the piece.
However uncalled for the war may
seem, the effect is scarcely noticeable.
The whole thing seems so. It is as
good a way as any to insure the illicit
lovers privacy for six days by block
ing them in a dug-out at the explosion
of an undiscovered German mine. The
book was somewhat less circumstan
tial although no less enthusiastic. In
the original version they simply went
boating to a neighboring chalet in
Switzerland.
Of course, if one likes this sort of
thing, it is as good a way as any to
kill an evening over the week-end.
"Anna Christie," plaything this week
at the Alcazar with Pauline Lord in
the title role, brings with it quite a
representation from New York and
London as a powerful drama of real
life. It tells a sea and water-front story
of the East coast in which the spiritual
effect of the sea upon the lives of men
and women who have battled with life
brings about a dramatic situation that
is intense and real.
Eugene O'Neill fills this play with
the atmosphere of impending fate,
lightened with spots of humor that
are in contrast to the very serious and
dramatic development of the plot.
After reaching an impressive climax
and conclusion at the end of the third
act, O'Neill adds a fourth and not-too
convincing act.

The population of the Philippine Is
lands has increased from 700,000 to
10,000,000, or more than fourteen
times, since 1591.

troduce a few sub-titles of snappy
comedy gags to relieve the excruciat
ing tension on the well-known with
ers, the profits might have gone even
bigger. This is unofficial.
The Great War has been introduced
into the film, a change which is not out
of accord with the spirit of the piece.
However uncalled for the war may
seem, the effect is scarcely noticeable.
The whole thing seems so. It is as
good a way as any to insure the illicit
lovers privacy for six days by block
ing them in a dug-out at the explosion
of an undiscovered German mine. The
book was somewhat less circumstan
tial although no less enthusiastic. In
the original version they simply went
boating to a neighboring chalet in
Switzerland.
Of course, if one likes this sort of
thing, it is as good a way as any to
kill an evening over the week-end.
"Anna Christie," plaything this week
at the Alcazar with Pauline Lord in
the title role, brings with it quite a
representation from New York and
London as a powerful drama of real
life. It tells a sea and water-front story
of the East coast in which the spiritual
effect of the sea upon the lives of men
and women who have battled with life
brings about a dramatic situation that
is intense and real.
Eugene O'Neill fills this play with
the atmosphere of impending fate,
lightened with spots of humor that
are in contrast to the very serious and
dramatic development of the plot.
After reaching an impressive climax
and conclusion at the end of the third
act, O'Neill adds a fourth and not-too
convincing act.

The population of the Philippine Is
lands has increased from 700,000 to
10,000,000, or more than fourteen
times, since 1591.

The celluloid "Six' Days," at any
rate, is no worse than the original
story as sold under Elinor Glynn's
name in novel form. It is playing at
the Varsity theater. At the time of
the first printing the publishers had
the opportunity of characterizing the
plot as daringly original. It seemed so
to us, at the time. We regret to say,
however half-heartedly, that other and
better pornographers have been dis
covered among both the ancients and
moderns since.
Considering the appalling number
of pamphlets of the nature of Whiz
Bang, we predict a great run for this
cinema shocker. If the producers could
have induced Avery Hopwood to in

comedy gags to relieve the excruciat
ing tension on the well-known with
