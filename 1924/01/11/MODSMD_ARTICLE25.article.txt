# UNDER THE LID
## 
### 
It would seem that there are a num
ber of men on the campus who have
something under the old hat, whether
you believe it or not.
Did you ever lift up one of those
head coverings which repose in the
racks provided for them in the Li
brary? Try it some day and see what
a flock of surprises awaits you.
Under one sombrero lay a copy of
a standard book of etiquette, with the
chapter on "What a Well-Dressed Man
Should Wear," especially well
thumbed.
An old felt hat, bearing a Riverside
haberdasher's name, when moved from
its place, disclosed a copy of "How to
Run the Half-Mile," a dance program,
and a jeweler's box probably contain
ing a fraternity sister pin. The Stan
ford man, whoever he is, is probably
learning to run the half before mar
riage. It will save him that much after
he takes the leap.
The more hats you move to discover
what they hide, the more you decide
that there is indeed reason to think
that all Stanford men have something
"under the lid."

In France, paper is used for making
windows in hothouse frames.
