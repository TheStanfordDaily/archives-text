# Moloney Was Sergeant In South African Boer War When a Youth
## 
### 
On the plains of South Africa as
first sergeant of scouts in the Boer
war, Harry W. Maloney, Associate Di
rector of Encina Gymnasium, cele
brated his twenty-first birthday.
"I had graduated from the British
Army School of Physical Education at
Dublin, Ireland, and was serving in
one of the British cavalry regiments
specializing in fencing, horsemanshrip,
and boxing. Here I won the lightweight
boxing championship of all troops sta
tioned in Ireland.
Spent Two Years in Africa
"My twenty-second birthday was
also spent in South Africa, awaiting
the final determination of the Boer
war, which lasted two years and four
months.
"In the latter part of 1902, I was
once again a civilian with an honor
able discharge and a first-class pas
sage to England tucked away in my
inside pocket.
"In August, 1902, I sailed from Eng
land for New York, to join my brother

in far-off California, living at that time
in Pasadena.
Conducted Private Gym
"From 1903 to 1908, I conducted a
private gymnasium in Pasadena for
medical and corrective gymnastics. In
1908, I was appointed instructor at
Stanford. Since that time I have
served here continuously, excepting
the war period, when I joined Uncle
Sam's army."
Before going overseas, Maloney was
physical director at Camp Fremont.
Since the war he has carried on his
work at Stanford, coaching soccer,
rugby, fencing, boxing,and wrestling.
When speakers are sought at the
beginning of each autumn quarter to
instruct the new men in the history
and traditions of Stanford, Maloney
is invariably called upon. His success
ful record as a coach of minor sports
was one of the few pegs strong enough
to support optimism with regard to
Stanford athletics during the slump
of the past few years.
