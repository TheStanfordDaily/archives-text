# Fond Hopes For Union Swimming Pool Blasted; "Hold-Overs" in Gloom
## 
### 
The men living In the Union are dis
appointed. Their illusions have been
rudely shocked, and tlveir dreams
shattered.
For some time now, they have
watched with interest a certain piece
of excavating in the courtyard of the
New Union. To their eager eyes, it
revealed itself as a spacious tiled
swimming pool, luxuriously appointed
and equipped with every detail. Every
man had expressed the resolution to
take a good swim every morning be
fore his 8 o'clocks, mentally painting
a brilliant picture of himself executing
a graceful swan dive from his study
window into the limpid pool below.
(Some plunge!)
But alas! One of the more enter
prising students discovered to his con
sternation that there was to be no
swimming pool. Instead, an artistic
fountain with pond lilies was being
put in—a gift from the class of 1922,
and executed with attention to simple
and aesthetic beauty by Bakewell and
Brown, regular University architects.
George Wagner, constructor of the
New Union and Encina Dining halls,
is casting the fountain.
Heavy with these astounding details,
the heart-broken youth groped his way
Union-ward where the whole sad story
was sobbed out. Gloom descended, and
how, hardened old "hold-overs" daily
wander about the courtyard, peering
with wan, sad faces into the half-com
pleted graveyard of their fondest
hopes.
