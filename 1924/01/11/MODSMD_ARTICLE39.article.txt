# PRELIMINARY RAM'S HEAD TRYOUTS START PLAY TOWARD PRESENTATION FEBRUARY 15
## 
### 
Preliminary tryouts for Ram's
Head's annual burlesque, to be pre
sented on February 15, were concluded
this afternoon in the Assembly hall.
On Monday and Tuesday, final tryouts
will be held, the cast selected, and
rehearsals begun.
Like Masquers' production, the
Ram's Head burlesque will take four
weeks for preparation instead of the
usual three. No director has been se
lected as yet, but the society expects
to secure some one off the campus to
aid in the chorus work.
Plot Approaches Perfection
The four-act plot, which will furnish
the outline of humor for the male fe
males and male males to burlesque
through, and which will weave the
light musical numbers together, has
been re-written iind re-cast by its au
thors, Carl Shoup, Northcutt Ely, and
Henry Mack.
Although a quantity of musical
themes have been pouring into the
hands of Louis Alabaster, who will

again direct, the music for the show,
pieces will be accepted for another
week. Alabaster hopes to secure work
from composers who have not con
tributed before, as well as from the
"standbys."
1923 Show by Ely, Newill
Last year's Ram's Head show, writ
ten by Northcutt Ely and Philip New
ill, was called "Knightie Knight."
The story was built around the
awakening of Sir Gavador, medieval
knight, in a modern English society
atmosphere. The three acts of the
play carried him through the lives of
many people, which he influenced
strangely, as only a chivalrous gentle
man of the age of King Arthur.
The villain was defeated by the
hero, the knight attained his beloved
by his chivalrous deeds, and even tol
erated the spoiled child.
The most popular musical numbers
of "Knightie Knight" were "Inn of the
Gold Horn," by Dick Malaby, "Just
Susie," by Myron Higby, and "Tally
Ho," also written by Malaby.
