Combine excellent technique, clarity
of tone, and the charm of person
ality with a program which includes
many favorite numbers, and you have
a recipe for the satisfying concert
given by the Griffes group last even
ing.
The program, as announced, was
changed at the last minute, although
several numbers of the original were
retained or used as encores.
Olga Steeb's brilliant but well-con
trolled playing of "La Campanella"
by Paginini-Liszt, Lucy Gates' smooth
clearness of tone in such difficult
songs as Mozart's "El Rey Pastore"
and the first aria from Donizetti's
"Lucia", and Jacobinoff's charming
violin solo, Walter's Prize Song" from
"the Meistersinger" of Wagner are
particularly memorial.
Perhaps the most distinctive select
ion was in the final group on the pro
gram, Mozart's famous Aria. "El Rey
Pastore", by the three artists.
