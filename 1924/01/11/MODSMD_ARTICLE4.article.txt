# VIOLIN, VOICE, AND PIANO ARTISTICALLY BLENDED BY TRIO
## Smooth Technique, Clarity of Tone Combined in Well Chosen Program 
### Miriam Hilton 
Combine excellent technique, clarity
of tone, and the charm of person
ality with a program which includes
many favorite numbers, and you have
a recipe for the satisfying concert
given by the Griffes group last even
ing.
The program, as announced, was
changed at the last minute, although
several numbers of the original were
retained or used as encores.
Olga Steeb's brilliant but well-con
trolled playing of "La Campanella"
by Paginini-Liszt, Lucy Gates' smooth
clearness of tone in such difficult
songs as Mozart's "El Rey Pastore"
and the first aria from Donizetti's
"Lucia", and Jacobinoff's charming
violin solo, Walter's Prize Song" from
"the Meistersinger" of Wagner are
particularly memorial.
Perhaps the most distinctive select
ion was in the final group on the pro
gram, Mozart's famous Aria. "El Rey
Pastore", by the three artists.
The blending of violin and voice
and the fine piano accompaniment
summed up the individual excellence
of the performers. "Le Bonheur est
chose Legere" of Saint-Saen√ü, and an
encore, "Le Nil" by Leroux were pre
sented in this final group.
Piano, Violin Divide Honors
The opening selection, by Jacoboff
and Miss Steeb was Dvorak's Sona
tina in G major, in which honors were
nicely divided between violin and
piano.
The violinist's solo numbers includ
ed such familiar pieces as "The Cane
brake" by Gardner, and "Snake
Dance" of Cecil Burleight. "Danish
Songs" by Herman Sanby was note
worthy, played with delicacy and
understanding. Kreisler's "Tamborin
Chinois" and "Prize Song" were en
cores.
Touch in Piano Solos
Miss Steeb's solo numbers were
"Hark, Hark, the Lark," Schubert-
Liszt; "White Peacock," by Charles
Gries; and "La Campanella," Paga
nini-Liszt. Her sure, light touch made
possible the beauty and precision
which was characteristic of her per
formance. She generously played
three encores: Chopin's Waltz in G,
the air, shadowy "Rigaudon" by Mac-
Dowell, and "Seguidilla," by Albinez.
Lucy Gates' dramatic soprano voice
is of a delightful quality and showed
to advantage in the numbers selected.
After tlve "Lucia" Aria, she gave "A
Little Bird" by Bainbridge-Crist as an
encore.
