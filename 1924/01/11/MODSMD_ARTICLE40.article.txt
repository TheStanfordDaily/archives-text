# Bawlout Proofs to Be Completed Next Week
## 
### 
Bawlout proofs will be displayed on
the bulletin board on the Quad in front
of the Administration building next week
on either Tuesday or Wednesday, accord
ing to an announcement made today by
Charles B. Goddard, assistant registrar.
The proofs are on the press now and
should be finished so that corrections can
be made by the middle of the week. The
proofs will be posted for one day only,
and all corrections must be made to the
registrar and not on the proof itself.
Final changes in the lists will be made
by the registrar's office a short time after
and the finished bawlouts should be placed
on sale by the middle of the following
week, January 23.
The greatest delay after the lists are
posted comes in the changes in type,
which are necessary as a result of the
various mistakes in the records of the
students.
