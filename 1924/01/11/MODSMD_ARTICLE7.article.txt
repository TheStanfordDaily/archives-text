# 1927 BASKET MEN OPPOSE FORMIDABLE OAKLANDERS
## Frosh Regulars Improving And May Participate in All of Contest Bay Squad Has Been Going Strong All Year; Will Be Fast Game 
### 
Freshman hoopsters encounter the
Oakland Technical high school team
at 7 o'clock tomorrow evening in the
pavilion, as a preliminary to the Var
sity-Olympic Club game. The Babes
are fast rounding into shape and
should give the strong Oaklanders a
hard fight.
The Oakland Tech quintet has been
going strong all year and presents a
formidable line-up. Hunt's men have
had little opposition in their first two
games, but from the way the piled up
the score against their weaker op
ponents, it is safe to say that they can
give the Oakland boys lots of competi
tion.
Babe Regulars Improving
So far, Hunt has been rather spar
ing with his five regulars, taking them
out at the end of the quarter. How
ever, they are getting nto tip-top con-,
dition and, if necessary, will be able
to go the whole game tomorrow with
out tiring.
Price and David are the likely start-:
ers at forward. These men are as fast;
a pair as could be desired, and are â– 
dependable shooters. David has a habit
of caging a few from the center of j
the floor in each game. Riese is a
good forward, and will undoubtedly!
get in the game for a while. South
worth and Hoffman may get an op
portunity to play also.
Jayred Has Edge at Center
Jayred has the edge over Anderson j
at center. Jayred is rangy, but is of j
the Bob Janssen type. He is good for
awhile, but can't keep up the pace j
throughout tlve game. Anderson sub- 1
stituted for him in the San Mateo
Junior College game last Wednesday.
Shipkey will start at running guard.
He plays the floor well but has not
done too well in the scoring end of
the game so far. Newhouse, the big
boy from Hollywood, is the choice at
standing guard.
