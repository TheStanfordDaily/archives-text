# TRACK MEN WILL HOLD MEET TODAY
## 
### 
The first Friday afternoon track
meet of the new year is to be held at
4 o'clock today on the varsity track
field. All the men registered for track
and a number of varsity and freshmen
track men competed.
Due to the weather, a number of the
varsity men have not been working
out, and so were not in the competition
today. "Tiny" Hartranft has been tak
ing things easy and is not expected to
put in an appearance in the meets for
a few weeks.
Coach Will Size Up Babes.
The meet today gave Coach "Dink" i
Templeton a chance to get a line on
some of the freshman stars. Up to j
now, little talent had been discovered j
in the class, and "Dink" anxiously j
waited for some of the freshmen to j
show their stuff.
Fred Richmann, in the high jump, is j
about the only man in the class who has
shown any ability. Richmann has been (
clearing six feet without much trouble. !
A setback came during the holidays :
when Work, considered good for a
first or second in this event, left col
lege.
The varsity and freshman aspirants j
will be given another chance to dem- !
onstrate theih ability a week from to
morrow when a regular informal meet
will be held.
