# RUHR BANKRUPTS FRANCE
## Peasants Happily Ignorant of Political Questions Declares Dr. Jordan 
### 
"France is like the man who got
hold of a bear's tail —bear's haven't
any, but that doesn't affect the story
—he was all right as long as he held
on." This was the characterization
drawn by Dr. Jordan in his talk last
night 011 "Conditions in Europe."
"France seized the Ruhr to put a
levy on Germany. She has put an end
to all reparations and has obtained
nothing out of the Ruhr. But she can
not come out with nothing; so she
hangs 011 to affect a semblance of
prosperity, though she be bankrupt.
"Fortunately, the people of France
can take care of themselves because
they have always lived off the land,
and, happily for their peace of mind,
the peasants know nothing of interna
tional politics and its troubles. The
power of France is concentrated in
Paris, where iron is manufactured ]
along with luxuries. There, are the
French iron men, who, after the war,
traded iron for German coal, and
waited until Germany was a little
short in delivering coal and telegraph
poles to seize the Ruhr. All the intel
ligencia of France is opposed to this |
invasion. Even Poincare is not such |
a bnd fellow. It is the capitalists who!
control him who are unscrupulous.
"Some men in Germany have made j
money, but they have made it out of |
the rest of the people. There were a |

few individuals who had their money
in foi'eign banks. It was not taken by
the German government when it took
everything after the war.
"But the many others who put their
money in savings banks or govern
ment bonds —the aged, the profession
al men, the scholars —have lost every
thing. The farmers can still raise pro
duce from their land, and those next,
to Holland and Denmark can got renl
money for it. The others can not even
.save —since money values depreciate
so rapidly—and there is a mad fever
of spending. Many able men are starv
ing. Austria lost three of her greatest
men through starvation.
"Meanwhile, England is up against
it with so many unemployed men. Tire
greater part of English labor is em
ployed in the manufacture of goods for
sale to other countries. Russia and
Germany are not buying, and France
is purchasing but little. The United
States-has carefully put up barriers
so (hat its own manufacturers may
supply its needs.
"But the time to expect reform is
not after a war when everything is
torn up. The general effect of war is
to put conservatism on its feet —put
back the 'man on horse-back.' Voltaire
was asked during the French Revolu
tion: 'How is it going to end?' And
he said, 'I never foretell the future —
there never was any'."
