# DR. BROWN OF YALE DISCUSSES RELIGIOUS DUTY
## Says Seriousness, Honesty Are Necessary to Any Theological Work 
### 
"The intellectual seriousness and hon
esty, which are taken as a matter of
course in other things, should be present
in the study of religion," said Reverend
Mr. Charles R. Brown, D.D., Dean of
the Divinity School, Yale University, and
a member of the Stanford National
Board, in the Memorial Church yester
day morning.
Religion cannot be settled in the time
it takes for a quick lunch, or for the
burning of a cigarette, according to Dr.
Brown. He emphasized the fact that the
study of religion is necessary, because if
we study other field.-, it is surely essen
tial to gather information about the seri
ous business of living life.
Dr. Brown said that if one were to
speak on the subject of chemistry, for
example, with as little knowledge of it
as some people have when they speak of
religion, they would be accused of giving
an "indecent intellectual exposure of
themselves."
"The study of religion," he said, "could
be divided into three parts: the first, the
habit of study, the second, the habit of
discrimination, and third, the search for
divine appraisal."
Advises Books on Religion
Dr. Brown advised that one should
read books concerning religion, but
which are written in terms that could be
understood by the layman. He also rec
ommended reading on the subject of
prayer, for which an intelligent attitude
is necessary. Dr. Brown quoted a former
president of Harvard who defined prayer
as the transcendent effort of the human
mind. He added that there were children
from five to fifty years of age going
about with the idea that prayer is the
act of a skillful beggar, undertaking to
get something for nothing.
Preaches Moderation
Discussing discrimination, Dr. Brown
censored the attitude of the person who
claims that he believes every word of the
Bible. "It is," he said, "the duty of the
intelligent to separate that which is local
from the universal in scope, the tempor
ary from the timeless, the incidental from
the essential. The Bible is a record of
progressive revelations, not dictated, but
wrought in every soul."
In the search for divine appraisal, Dr.
Brown advises that we follow Caesar's
example, and appeal to the highest court.
"If the beliefs of Christian people were
human inventions, they will come to
nough, but if the aspiraitons have the lift
and urge of a great moral order,, then
they are unable to be fought against, for
they stand for God. We gain, not by
mere intelligent scrutiny, but by living the
religious life," he said.

about with the idea that prayer is the
act of a skillful beggar, undertaking to
get something for nothing.
Preaches Moderation
Discussing discrimination, Dr. Brown
censored the attitude of the person who
claims that he believes every word of the
Bible. "It is," he said, "the duty of the
intelligent to separate that which is local
from the universal in scope, the tempor
ary from the timeless, the incidental from
the essential. The Bible is a record of
progressive revelations, not dictated, but
wrought in every soul."
In the search for divine appraisal, Dr.
Brown advises that we follow Caesar's
example, and appeal to the highest court.
"If the beliefs of Christian people were
human inventions, they will come to
nough, but if the aspiraitons have the lift
and urge of a great moral order,, then
they are unable to be fought against, for
they stand for God. We gain, not by
mere intelligent scrutiny, but by living the
religious life," he said.
"The intellectual seriousness and hon
esty, which are taken as a matter of
course in other things, should be present
in the study of religion," said Reverend
Mr. Charles R. Brown, D.D., Dean of
the Divinity School, Yale University, and
a member of the Stanford National
Board, in the Memorial Church yester
day morning.
Religion cannot be settled in the time
it takes for a quick lunch, or for the
burning of a cigarette, according to Dr.
Brown. He emphasized the fact that the
study of religion is necessary, because if
we study other field.-, it is surely essen
tial to gather information about the seri
ous business of living life.
Dr. Brown said that if one were to
speak on the subject of chemistry, for
example, with as little knowledge of it
as some people have when they speak of
religion, they would be accused of giving
an "indecent intellectual exposure of
themselves."
"The study of religion," he said, "could
be divided into three parts: the first, the
habit of study, the second, the habit of
discrimination, and third, the search for
divine appraisal."
Advises Books on Religion
Dr. Brown advised that one should
read books concerning religion, but
which are written in terms that could be
understood by the layman. He also rec
ommended reading on the subject of
prayer, for which an intelligent attitude
is necessary. Dr. Brown quoted a former
president of Harvard who defined prayer
as the transcendent effort of the human
mind. He added that there were children
from five to fifty years of age going
about with the idea that prayer is the
act of a skillful beggar, undertaking to
get something for nothing.
