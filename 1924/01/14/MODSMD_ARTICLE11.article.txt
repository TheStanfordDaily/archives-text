# APRIL 26 IS SET FOR CALIFORNIA DIAMOND AND TRACK CONTESTS
## 
### 
April 26 has been set as the date
for the Big Meet of California-Stanford
spring track and field competition, it
was announced at the graduate mana
ger's office this morning. On the same
day both freshman and varsity base
ball nines will meet in the third game
of the annual inter-collegiate series.
As the regular University Alumni
Day, Sigma Delta Chi's state conven
tion of high school editors, and a num
ber of other gatherings are now plan-1
ned for this date, it is believed that
April 26 is destined to become one of
the great days in the history of the
university.
Card Teams Strong
From the student standpoint the
newly set date is of particular impor
tance in bringing to a climax spring
competition on track and baseball, in
both of which sports Stanford at this
time appears stronger than for many j
seasons. Sport critics who make it a
point never to be fooled already have
their eyes on Coach R. L. Temple
ton's squad of oval candidates, and
noticing such stars as Leistner,
Hartranft, Smith, Boles, Richardson,
Arthur and Kerr in training, they have
it that the 1924 Cardinal team is due
to rate almost top standing.
