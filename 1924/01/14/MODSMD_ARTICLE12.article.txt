First Half Ends 5-4
I The first half was an even battle up
and down the floor but neither was able
to take a great advantage of its few
opportunities to score and the first half
ended 5 to 4 with Phi Gamma Delta
leading.
A little rough play was displayed the
second half through the increase in fight
of both fives but scoring was even less
than the first period, each tossing in one
goal apiece with an additional free
throw credited to Delta Chi.
The 7 to 7 tie necessitated an extra
five-minute period in which the Delta
Chis were able to score four points, and
win the contest by an 11 to 8 count.
Coplen played his usual good game at
forward for Delta Chi and was well sec
onded by Hood at forward and Whit
field at center.
For the Fijis, Condit, Hunt, and Chase
showed up well.
