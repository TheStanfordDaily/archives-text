# STANFORD-U. C. RING RELATIONS ARE UNSETTLED
## Attempt to Resume Annual Boxing Tournament Is Unsuccessful 
### 
In a recent meeting of Graduate Man
ager Paul Davis of Stanford and Ray
Corteleau, graduate manager of the Uni
versity of California, an attempt was
made to resume the annual boxing con
test between the two institutions. No
definite conclusion was reached, and
Stanford authorities believe there will
be difficulty in ironing over the existing
differences of opinion.
The boxing meet was called off last
year due to disagreements as to the
eligibility of California boxers. Condi
tions under which the bouts might be
given, and notably the advisability of
arranging bouts between white and col
ored boxers. The latter question from
time to time has been apparently settled
only to arise again for controversy.
It was thought that the athletic rela
tionship between the two universities
were too valuable to warrant the con
tinuation of these conditions, and it
seemed best to discontinue the boxing
relations between the two institutions un
til a definite understanding could be
reached.
To the Stanford authorities this step
seemed wisest, and it was hoped that re
lations might be resumed again this year
if the condition could be remedied.
