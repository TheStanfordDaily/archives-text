## 
### 
Playing a close guarding game, the
freshman five defeated the Oakland
Technical high school team by the
score of 10-7. The freshmen took the
lead at the start and were never
headed, although the Oakland boys
managed to ti-e the score towards the
end of the first half.
Numerous fouls and very mediocre
shooting featured the contest. Shipkey
was taken from the game at the end
of the first half for an excessive nuni j
her of personal fouls. Williams, who
substituted for him at running guard,
played a very creditable game.
Substitutes Play Good Game
Andersofl played half of the game
at center, taking Jayred'ti place; and
Riese played a good portion of the
time in place of David. All three of
the substitutes played like veterans,
This looks good for the California
series as one of the handicaps of the
team last year was the absence of
dependable substitutes.
Newhouse played his best game of
the year at standing guard. He got the
ball from the back board every time
the Oakland players made an attempt
al goal, and got the bail into the Stan
ford players' hands, where it could
easily be carried down the floor.
Price started the scoring two min
utes after the start of the game with
a shot from near the basket. Jayred
made another a few minutes later, and
the Oakland team garnered one point
from the foul line, the period ending
soon after with the score 4-1.
Frosh Score in Last Quarter
The freshmen made one basket in
the final period on an out-of-bounds
play. Riese tossed the ball to Williams
who scored. Oakland got a point from
the foul line when a foul was called
on Price, and Horon made his try

Playing a close guarding game, the
freshman five defeated the Oakland
Technical high school team by the
score of 10-7. The freshmen took the
lead at the start and were never
headed, although the Oakland boys
managed to ti-e the score towards the
end of the first half.
Numerous fouls and very mediocre
shooting featured the contest. Shipkey
was taken from the game at the end
of the first half for an excessive nuni j
her of personal fouls. Williams, who
substituted for him at running guard,
played a very creditable game.
Substitutes Play Good Game
Andersofl played half of the game
at center, taking Jayred'ti place; and
Riese played a good portion of the
time in place of David. All three of
the substitutes played like veterans,
This looks good for the California
series as one of the handicaps of the
team last year was the absence of
dependable substitutes.
Newhouse played his best game of
the year at standing guard. He got the
ball from the back board every time
the Oakland players made an attempt
al goal, and got the bail into the Stan
ford players' hands, where it could
easily be carried down the floor.
Price started the scoring two min
utes after the start of the game with
a shot from near the basket. Jayred
made another a few minutes later, and
the Oakland team garnered one point
from the foul line, the period ending
soon after with the score 4-1.
