Stanford rooters have, off and on, roundly berated because some
thoughtless people in their midst have come out with a tentative "Boo!"
directed at the referee. The Daily Palo Alto has several times been
obliged to call attention to this lapse.
It is extremely pleasant, therefore, to be able to say that last Satur
day night there was a total absence of such oubursts.
Stanford is one of the few colleges on the Coast with a reputation for
the sportsmanship of its rooting sections. To maintain this reputation
should be a matter of pride for those who sit in Stanford bleachers.
The Daily wishes to thank the rooting section for this opportunity to
give praise where it is due.
