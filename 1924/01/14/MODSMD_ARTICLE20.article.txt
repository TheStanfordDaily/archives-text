It is amusing, though not often instructive, to hear an engineer telling
about how he can stand on his corner and see the whole co-educational
world pass before him in review.
One wonders, however, if the engineer stands on his corner so much
to watch the parade as to appear on parade himself. The Econ major,
perched on his steps, tries sometimes to imitate the hardy engineer, but
mostly is present to sun himself, to give his tired brain a rest—and to
watch the ladies, though he is not conspicuous about it.
The engineer, to maintain his position of rough, tough bluff, must as
sume the pose of hardiness, wear his hat at an angle, shew his plug, and
appear on his corner for the five hundred to admire, fie of course be
lieves himself an object of admiration, or he would have long since aban
doned the pose.
