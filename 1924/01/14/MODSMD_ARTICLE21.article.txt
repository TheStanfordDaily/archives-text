"Studied Carelessness" says a prominent young Englishman, is the
proper motif for men's dress. Shoes, and clothes should look as if they
were slightly worn. Hats should have that indefinable touch lent by al
lowing an elephant to step on them. Buttons should be loose and button
holes should be open at both ends.

Some professors do not take the class roll every day, not because they
have faith in their students, but because they know that their courses are
interesting enough to make attendance by compulsion unnecessary.
