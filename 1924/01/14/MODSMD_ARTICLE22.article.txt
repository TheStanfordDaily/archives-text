# SPORTSMANSHIP
## 
### 
Boston College Heights
Many have misconceived ideas on
thia subject Come, consider what true
sportsmanship is. Sportsmanship is
not the mere acceptance of defeat, dis
appointment, or failure; sportsman
ship is giving the victor, with all sin
cerity, his due praise, sportsmanship
is bearing up under disappointment
or failure; sportsmanship is giving the
victor, with all sincerity, his due
praise, sportsmanship is bearing up
under disappointment and attempting
again with indomitable spirit that in
which we have failed. Furthermore
sportsmanship is not confined to the
athletic field. Acts of sportsmanship can
be performed in every walk of life.
In the Classroom
We shall confine ourselves to sports
manship in and about the college, ex
clusive of on the athletic field. First
we shall consider the classroom. Are
there not many opportunities "to be a
sport" in the classroom. When you
have tried your best at some subject
and being called upon to recite actu
ally "fizzle," do you become discour
aged and say you "can't get" the sub
ject, or speciously say the "prof" is
unreasonable and did not give you a

fair chance, or do you in true manly
fashion become determined to master
that obstacle ih the path of your
progress and say, 'You can't keep a
good man down"?
Considerate Towards Professor
Agani do you try to thwart, as far as
lies in your power, the work of your
professor? Do you co-operate with him
or do you act after the fashion of "a
kid" and try to make the life in the
classroom a bore to the professor?
There are altogether too many of this
kind of thoughtless youths, who never
stop to realize that they have entered
these portals of learning and have
donned the togs which signifies that
they are able to think for themselves.
The days when we considered it a
great feat to perform boyish pranks in
the classroom have sunk into the dark
and hazy past. "Cutting up" in the
classroom does not belong to college
life. Some have the false idea that it
does. Come now ye hitherto thought
less ones, remember at all times that
you are now college men. Be consider
ate of others. • * •
Come now, forget yourselves, be con
siderate of others; in short. Be a
Sport.

classroom does not belong to college
life. Some have the false idea that it
does. Come now ye hitherto thought
less ones, remember at all times that
you are now college men. Be consider

Come now, forget yourselves, be con

Sport.
Boston College Heights
Many have misconceived ideas on
thia subject Come, consider what true
sportsmanship is. Sportsmanship is
not the mere acceptance of defeat, dis
appointment, or failure; sportsman
ship is giving the victor, with all sin
cerity, his due praise, sportsmanship
is bearing up under disappointment
or failure; sportsmanship is giving the
victor, with all sincerity, his due
praise, sportsmanship is bearing up
under disappointment and attempting
again with indomitable spirit that in
which we have failed. Furthermore
sportsmanship is not confined to the
athletic field. Acts of sportsmanship can
be performed in every walk of life.
In the Classroom
We shall confine ourselves to sports
manship in and about the college, ex
clusive of on the athletic field. First
we shall consider the classroom. Are
there not many opportunities "to be a
sport" in the classroom. When you
have tried your best at some subject
and being called upon to recite actu
ally "fizzle," do you become discour
aged and say you "can't get" the sub
ject, or speciously say the "prof" is
unreasonable and did not give you a

fair chance, or do you in true manly
fashion become determined to master
that obstacle ih the path of your
progress and say, 'You can't keep a
good man down"?
Considerate Towards Professor
Agani do you try to thwart, as far as
lies in your power, the work of your
professor? Do you co-operate with him
or do you act after the fashion of "a
kid" and try to make the life in the
classroom a bore to the professor?
There are altogether too many of this
kind of thoughtless youths, who never
stop to realize that they have entered
these portals of learning and have
donned the togs which signifies that
they are able to think for themselves.
The days when we considered it a
great feat to perform boyish pranks in
the classroom have sunk into the dark
and hazy past. "Cutting up" in the
classroom does not belong to college
life. Some have the false idea that it
does. Come now ye hitherto thought
less ones, remember at all times that
you are now college men. Be consider
