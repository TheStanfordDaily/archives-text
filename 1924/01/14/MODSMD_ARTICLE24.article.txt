"LITTLE OLD NEW YORK" opens
at the Varsity Theater tonight riding a
wave of publicity which has been built
up for some months. The best picture
ever made could scarcely conform to all
i of the specifications announced for this
Marion Davies film, but whether or not
one feels stuffed with blurb, it is a good
show. That is> it was when last seen
j by the minions of this department.
Old man O'Day starts the action by
drafting an upsetting will before he dies
which leaves his considerable fortune to
Irish relatives providing his brother's
son claims it in New York within the
year. The family is met just after an
eviction by a hard-hearted landlord with
a disregard for the beneficiaries illness
and they hustle off to New York just in
i time to gloom up a party celebrating the
suspected forfeiture of the money.
( The heir dies on the voyage, how
ever, and his sister is made to claim the
fortune masqueraded as her brother. It
( .is this pretty mess which Cupid is left
to straighten out. The rest invloves Rob
ert Fulton's steamboat and other his
torical matters of interest and the up
roarious fight between the Hoboken Ter
ror and Bully Boy Brewster.
Bully Boy Brewster is the gem of the
show. Mary will recall having seen him
before on the Orpheum circuit. This
time he fights for the honor and glory
of the original volunteer fire department.
His stuff alone is worth more than
thirty cents.
