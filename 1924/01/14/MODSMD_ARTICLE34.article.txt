Art Gallery. The work is a result of
a system worked out by Pedro J.
Lemos, of the Stanford gallery, and
Miss Bess Foster, supervisor of art for
Minneapolis.
The work being done there has at
tracted nationwide attention. The art
work is organized progressively from
grade to grade, and shows the steps
by which drawing and color are re

work produced from the first grade to
the senior school in high school.
The exhibit will remain here through
