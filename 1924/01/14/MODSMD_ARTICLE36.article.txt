## GOERTZ, QUARTER-MILER, RESUMES WORK AT U. C. 
### 
Clifford Goertz, member of the Cali
fornia varsity track team, is reported to
have entered the Berkeley university for
the spring semester, having taken out a
leave of absence for the fall term. By
taking some make-up work, Goertz will
be able to enter track competition this
spring.
Coach Christie will find him a valuable
man in the quarter-mile event, since the
loss of Elmer Boyden through scholastic
difficulties. Goertz was one of the best
in his class last year and during his fresh
man year won the quarter-mile event in
the annual California-Stanford meet.
