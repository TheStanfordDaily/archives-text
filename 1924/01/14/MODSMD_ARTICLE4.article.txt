# HAMMER AND COFFIN MEMBERSHIP SOUGHT BY WISCONSIN, TEXAS
## 
### 
Following on the heels of the instal
lation of the University of Chicago
"<Phoenix" as a chapter of Hammer and
Coffin, petitions have been received by
the local chapter for the installation of
the Wisconsin "Octopus" and the Texas
"Ranger" as member publications.
Founded at Stanford
Hammer and Coffin is a national honor
society comprising the staffs of leading
college comics. Founded at Stanford the
night before the earthquake—April 17,
1906—it expanded to include first the
leading college comics of the Coast, and
later some of the leaders of the middle
west.
The installations of these chapters,
however, were not attended by earth
quakes, and, in order to eliminate any
east-west friction, it has been adopted
as a national policy that no college shall
receive a chapter until its president shall
have submitted a sworn statement that
the comic of that institution has made
every effort to secure an earthquake for
the occasion and has fialed. Action on
the two petitions is consequently being
held up.
Chappie, Jester Issue
The Old Boy appeared in the Daily
office this morning clad in knickers, golf
sox, and galoshes, and inquiring the way
to Morningside. When he had been re
duced to sanity, he explained that he
was celebrating the completion of pre
liminaries for his combined issue with a
leading citizen of the east —the "Jester"
of Columbia University.
In his hand lie bore a telegram from
the eastern comic conveying the glad tid
ings that Mr. Jack Holmgren, well
known in the art offices of both Life
and Judge, had consented to paint the
cover, and that the Jester contributions
would include such bits as a frontispiece
poem by David Cort. "Jester's" versatile
editor, and art work by Slavik and Hag
lund—big guns of the battery which
"Jester" trains each year 011 "Judge's
College Wits Cup.
Chappie Art Features
And with that the Old Boy retired to
don liis more comfortable red flannels,
leaving the parting information that
Stanford, not to be outdone, would fea
ture a full page by Wheate and drawings
by Thompson, McDonald, and Ferguson
—themselves 110 mean pop-guns when
national competition comes around.
Provisions are being made to bind
the issue in asbestos in order to keep the
fire of competition from scorching the
cover. Each college comic has brought
home the national championship—Jester
in 1921 and Chappie in 1923—and com
fortables facilities will shortly be pro
vided for those caring to laugh them
selves into apoplexy on publication day
—February 10.
