# HAMMER AND COFFIN MEMBERSHIP SOUGHT BY WISCONSIN, TEXAS
## 
### 
Following on the heels of the instal
lation of the University of Chicago
"<Phoenix" as a chapter of Hammer and
Coffin, petitions have been received by
the local chapter for the installation of
the Wisconsin "Octopus" and the Texas
"Ranger" as member publications.
Founded at Stanford
Hammer and Coffin is a national honor
society comprising the staffs of leading
college comics. Founded at Stanford the
night before the earthquake—April 17,
1906—it expanded to include first the
leading college comics of the Coast, and
later some of the leaders of the middle
west.
The installations of these chapters,
however, were not attended by earth
quakes, and, in order to eliminate any
east-west friction, it has been adopted
as a national policy that no college shall
receive a chapter until its president shall
have submitted a sworn statement that
the comic of that institution has made
every effort to secure an earthquake for
the occasion and has fialed. Action on
the two petitions is consequently being
held up.
