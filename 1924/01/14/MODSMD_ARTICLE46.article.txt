# SEAMEN WANT BOOKS
## STUDENTS MAY LEAVE FICTION, TEXTS, AT Y. W. C. A. 
### 
A plea for books has been sent out
by the library of the Seaman's Insti
tute in San Francisco. Students are
requested to leave old books in the
Y. M. C. A. rooms or in the Y. W. C. A.
room on the third floor of the Wo
men's Clubhouse. In addition to good
fiction, biographies, books of travel,
and high-class magazines, the seamen
in the merchant ships need simple text
books, dictionaries, atlases, and books
on engineering, navigation, radio, and
electricity.
The cellar in the Institute building
was flooded during a recent fire, and
many books ruined so that the need
for books is especially urgent this
year. The library wishes books not
only for the use of men on shore, but
also to supply libraries to ships. Last
year 219 ships were furnished reading
materials by the Institute's library.
Over 100,000' seamen in the United
States merchant ships have nothing to
read. Their appreciation of books is
shown by the way they exchange in
all ports of the world the small li
braries which the institute provides,
them.
Students are urged to contribute to
tire library.
