# VARSITY TRIMS OLYMPIC CLUB QUINTET 31 TO 11
## Winged "0" Warriors Outclassed By Card Teamwork and Strong Stanford Offensive Drive 
### David Melklejohn 
Credentials are not always flawless, and credentials from a determined, but
woefully unbalanced Olympic Club, did not suffice to check a mad rushing
Cardinal offensive or penetrate a stone-wall defense last Saturday in the
pavilion. Stanford won, 31 to 11. Nothing sensational, but certainly over
whelming and convincing.
Team-work enabled the Cards to mount the score consistently throughout
the contest. Individualism made the Olympic showing ragged and unskillful.
One of the largest crowds that has ever been sheltered under the pavilion
roof waited in tense excitement to see an eye-for-eye, and a tooth-for-a-tooth
game. Instead, they witnessed a murder.
Stanford scored almost as soon as the ball had been tossed up between the
rival centers for the first time. A foul on Boyle, Winged "O" center, a
conversion by Steele, and Stanford had drawn first blood.
McHose and Nevers scored soon after on free throws. The first field goal
came as a result of pretty passing formation, Oliva to Nevers to McHose to

>Mcßurney, and McHose dropped the
ball through the net.
Winged "C" Ragged
The Olympics played raggedly.
Nevers chalked up a free throw on a
foul by Bonney and followed it on the
next play with a long field goal.
' With five minutes to go in the first
period, Stanford lead 10 to 0. Lauter
wasser was substituted for Bonney on
the Olympic team. The substitute
missed two easy shots under the bas
ket, but managed to make the first
scores for his team on a free throw
1 and a field goal. "
The score at the end of the first
half was 14 to 3 in favor of the Cards.
Game Gets Rough
Rough playing and a great deal of
passing featured the second period.
For fully two minutes at one stage of
the game the Cards played a lone
some game of "kitty wants a corner,"
with some determined Olympic player
; doggedly acting as the "kitty."
Stanford scored regularly. The
Winged "O" quintet seemed to find the
basket oftener than in the first half,
but not consistently enough to keer
up with the Cardinal drive.
