New Dance Steps Come Easy
with
The New EDISON
THE fascinating melody and persuasive rhythm of the New
Edison records will prompt you to try the new dance
steps without hesitation.
The latest dance hits from the Great White Way are listed
among the catchy New Edison one-steps, fox-trots and waltzes.
They are the kind of dance hits that have distinguished Edison
Records from the start.
Edison laboratories release their records as soon as manu
factured (not periodically) in order that owners of the New
Edison may have the latest and best selections always available.
Edison records afford nearly twice as much dance music as do
average records. They give 150 lines of music to the inch instead
of 90.
Come in today and hear the new dance records.
