# 0. C.—Bear Game To Give Early Season Line On Card Chances
## 
### 
Followers of intercollegiate basketball |
will be greatly interested in the outcome j
of the Olympic-California game tonight.
The result of this game will give dope
sters a basis of comparison between the j
Stanford and California quintets.
Last week the Cardinal five completely
upset the dope by winning a 31-11 victory j
from the Winged "O" team. Kerr's team
had not been given better than a fifty-;
fifty chance, and, in spite of the fact j
that the club team failed 'to live up to
expectations, made a most creditable
early season showing.
The basis of comparison between j
Coach Wright's and Coach Kerr's teams
will not he as reliable after tonight's
game as it would seem at first glance.
Last year the Card quintet swept
through a tough preliminary season with
out a setback, winning a tight game from
the Olympic Club. This same club team
went to Berkeley a few weeks later and
defeated the Golden Bear quintet by a
fairly safe margin. This naturally made
Stanford the favorite over California
in the four-game series.
What happened in that series is a mat
ter of history. The Cardinal five, worn
out from a hard prclminary season and
a wearing trip to Los Angeles could not
weather the storm.
The explanation of this seems to be
that Stanford is the Olympic Club's jinx.
Regardless of the outcome of the game
tonight, the Card-Bear basketball series
this year will be decided when the two
teams meet and cannot be figured out
on paper.
Fears that Andy Kerr was to have a
five-man team this year thus far seem

to be justified. The regular combina
tion which has started nearly every game
includes Captain McHose, Nevcrs,
Steele, Mcßurney, and Oliva. These are
practically the only experienced men on
the squad.
These men seem to be standing the
gaff very well. All of them are in good
condition and are working together bet- j
ter every game. Back in 1921, a six- j
man team brought the Pacific Coast title j
to Stanford. With the improvement i
shown by several of Kerr's substitutes.'
it begins to look like at least two or ■
three of them will be ready to take the
places of the regulars without weaken
ing the team by the end of the season.
Mitchell and Shipkey have been show
ing better dail yat the running guard j
position. With a little more experience j
Moody may be able to relieve Steele at j
center. Steffan and Alexander are both j
light, but Kerr is bringing them to the j
front fast, and they can be sent in to j
relieve McHose and Nevers at the for- j
ward positions.
"Nip" and Ernie are working together
in fine shape and with the help of Steele j
and Mcßurney have developed into a (
formidable offensive combination, i
Steele's work, both on defense and of-1
fense, is good. Oliva, under the basket, j
is a hard man to get around, and he j
seems to be getting over his fouling
habit.. Mcßurney is fitting into the run
ning guard position in great shape. He
is picking up the one thing he has lacked
most —confidence.
Saturday night, the Santa Clara quin
tet is scheduled to meet the varsity in the
pavilion.
