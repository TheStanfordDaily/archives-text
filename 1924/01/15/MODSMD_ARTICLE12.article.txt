## Arnold Bayley in Charge of Production by Shoup, Ely, and Mack 
### 
Many a star twinkles unseen and
a lot twinkled last night in the sec

sided ovpr by Arnold Bayley, the
three playwrights, "Mike" Ely, Carl
Shoup, and "Hank" Mack, behind
closed doors, the production began to
take on the appearance of dark mys
tery.

ous plot or its characters but was

night. All he got was a list of the
