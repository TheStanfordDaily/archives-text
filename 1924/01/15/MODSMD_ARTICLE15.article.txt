# "DINK" TEMPLETON OUTLINES POLICIES FOR TRACK SEASON
## Men to Get in Condition Early; First Interclass Meet to Be in March 
### 
Track season moved underway yester
day afternoon, when Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton announced the varsity track squad,
and spoke to both varsity and freshmen
men on his definite plans of training for
the California meets.
This year the men will get in condi
tion early so that they will be in shape
a little before the big meet. The first
meet will be an interclass affair which
will take place about the first week in
March.
Until the weather warms up, light
workouts will be in order. In about a
month, when the men begin to get in
shape, informal meets will be held Sat
urday mornings for the varsity and
freshman squads and class meets will
be held every Friday for the track class.
"Dink's" plan of getting the men in
shape early is in direct contrast to Wal
ter Christie's methods. Christie does not
start strenuous training until much later.
Instruction for early training in each
event was given yesterday. Meetings
will be held from time to time for the
track men, at which problems of train
ing will be considered.
Members of the squad last year who
are back at college, and new men who
have shown ability have been named as
a tentative track squad. Men will be
added to the varsity and freshman lists
whenever they show talent in an event.
Freshmen stars have so far remained
under cover. The track managers are
at work now hunting them, and as soon
as a full list of experienced Babes can
be prepared "Dink" will start working
with them in the hope of preparing a
winning 1927 team this year.
After outlining his scheme of train
ing for the season, Templeton briefly
covered the early work to be don«
by the men of each event.
A considerable portion of the train
ing done by the sprinters will con
sist of starting practice. Although'the
weather will be of some hindrance,
Templeton expects to spend much of
his time teaching the men to get off
on a quick start. Besides working on
starts the sprinters were urged to
develop their stomach muscles by
regular hard exercises. The varsity
men have, the past two weeks, been
taking the setting up exercises to
gether with the physical education
track classes, and Templeton advised
the squads to continue this for a
month more.
Both Charley Paddock and Morris
Kirksey, according to "Dink," were
slow starters in the early part of
their running careers, and their com
petitors could always figure in get
ting the jump on them; but through
steady starting practice th<e two men
picked up so much that in the last

few years no man has been able to
get off ahead of them regularly. Tem
pleton has in the past few years de
voted much attention to starting, and
he expects to increase the value of
the varsity printers considerably. He
has already been working with Camp
bell, Hale, Gaspar, and Miller.
Leistner and Boles have been work
ing on the hurdles for some time, and
are in good enough shape to begin
fast work. Boles, under Templeton's
coaching, has been practicing his
strides to th<e first hurdle, and seems
to be getting off to a much faster start.
The middle distance and long dis
tance men will take it easy for several
weeks yet, just running enough to
get in sufficient condition to step into
the competition squad meets to begin
next month. The men in each event
will run three-quarters of their re
spective distnaces in these meets.

Canadian railroads paid employes
more than $241,000,000 in 1923, an in
crease of $18,000,000 over 1922.

the varsity printers considerably. He
has already been working with Camp
bell, Hale, Gaspar, and Miller.
Leistner and Boles have been work
ing on the hurdles for some time, and
are in good enough shape to begin
fast work. Boles, under Templeton's
coaching, has been practicing his
strides to th<e first hurdle, and seems
to be getting off to a much faster start.
The middle distance and long dis
tance men will take it easy for several
weeks yet, just running enough to
get in sufficient condition to step into
the competition squad meets to begin
next month. The men in each event
will run three-quarters of their re
spective distnaces in these meets.

Canadian railroads paid employes
more than $241,000,000 in 1923, an in

Track season moved underway yester
day afternoon, when Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton announced the varsity track squad,
and spoke to both varsity and freshmen
men on his definite plans of training for
the California meets.
This year the men will get in condi
tion early so that they will be in shape
a little before the big meet. The first
meet will be an interclass affair which
will take place about the first week in
March.
Until the weather warms up, light
workouts will be in order. In about a
month, when the men begin to get in
shape, informal meets will be held Sat
urday mornings for the varsity and
freshman squads and class meets will
be held every Friday for the track class.
"Dink's" plan of getting the men in
shape early is in direct contrast to Wal
ter Christie's methods. Christie does not
start strenuous training until much later.
Instruction for early training in each
event was given yesterday. Meetings
will be held from time to time for the
track men, at which problems of train
ing will be considered.
Members of the squad last year who
are back at college, and new men who
have shown ability have been named as
a tentative track squad. Men will be
added to the varsity and freshman lists
whenever they show talent in an event.
Freshmen stars have so far remained
under cover. The track managers are
at work now hunting them, and as soon
as a full list of experienced Babes can
be prepared "Dink" will start working
with them in the hope of preparing a
winning 1927 team this year.
After outlining his scheme of train
ing for the season, Templeton briefly
covered the early work to be don«
by the men of each event.
A considerable portion of the train
ing done by the sprinters will con
sist of starting practice. Although'the
weather will be of some hindrance,
Templeton expects to spend much of
his time teaching the men to get off
on a quick start. Besides working on
starts the sprinters were urged to
develop their stomach muscles by
regular hard exercises. The varsity
men have, the past two weeks, been
taking the setting up exercises to
gether with the physical education
track classes, and Templeton advised
the squads to continue this for a
month more.
Both Charley Paddock and Morris
Kirksey, according to "Dink," were
slow starters in the early part of
their running careers, and their com
petitors could always figure in get
ting the jump on them; but through
steady starting practice th<e two men
picked up so much that in the last

few years no man has been able to
get off ahead of them regularly. Tem
pleton has in the past few years de
voted much attention to starting, and
he expects to increase the value of
the varsity printers considerably. He
has already been working with Camp
