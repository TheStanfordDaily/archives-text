# "DINK" TEMPLETON OUTLINES POLICIES FOR TRACK SEASON
## Men to Get in Condition Early; First Interclass Meet to Be in March 
### 
Track season moved underway yester
day afternoon, when Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton announced the varsity track squad,
and spoke to both varsity and freshmen
men on his definite plans of training for
the California meets.
This year the men will get in condi
tion early so that they will be in shape
a little before the big meet. The first
meet will be an interclass affair which
will take place about the first week in
March.
Until the weather warms up, light
workouts will be in order. In about a
month, when the men begin to get in
shape, informal meets will be held Sat
urday mornings for the varsity and
freshman squads and class meets will
be held every Friday for the track class.
"Dink's" plan of getting the men in
shape early is in direct contrast to Wal
ter Christie's methods. Christie does not
start strenuous training until much later.
Instruction for early training in each
event was given yesterday. Meetings
will be held from time to time for the
track men, at which problems of train
ing will be considered.
Members of the squad last year who
are back at college, and new men who
have shown ability have been named as
a tentative track squad. Men will be
added to the varsity and freshman lists
whenever they show talent in an event.
Freshmen stars have so far remained
under cover. The track managers are
at work now hunting them, and as soon
as a full list of experienced Babes can
be prepared "Dink" will start working
with them in the hope of preparing a
winning 1927 team this year.
After outlining his scheme of train
ing for the season, Templeton briefly
