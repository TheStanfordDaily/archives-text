# AUDIENCE WILL BE JUDGE OF STANFORD-CALIFORNIA DEBATE
## 
### 
There will be no judges at the
Stanford-California debate to be held
in the Little Theater, January 24. In
stead, each member of the audience
will be given a ballot and his vote
will be gathered at the close of the
debate.
The debate will be on the ques
tion, "Should the California criminal
syndicalism law be repealed?" Stan
ley Weigel, '26, and Thomas Bailey,
'24, have been chosen to represent
Stanford.
The question is of interest because
it has to do with the I. W. W. prob
lem in California, and the radical
problem generally.
Aim to Interest Audience
It will be the aim of the speakers to
make the debate interesting to the
audience. Heretofore, speeches have
been directed at the judges and have
been noteworthy for their dryness. It
will be necessary for the speakers on
January 24 to bold the individual
members of the audience, which ne
cessity will probably alter the type
of speeches presented.
