# AUDIENCE WILL BE JUDGE OF STANFORD-CALIFORNIA DEBATE
## 
### 
There will be no judges at the
Stanford-California debate to be held
in the Little Theater, January 24. In
stead, each member of the audience
will be given a ballot and his vote
will be gathered at the close of the
debate.
The debate will be on the ques
tion, "Should the California criminal
syndicalism law be repealed?" Stan
ley Weigel, '26, and Thomas Bailey,
'24, have been chosen to represent
Stanford.
The question is of interest because
it has to do with the I. W. W. prob
lem in California, and the radical
problem generally.
Aim to Interest Audience
It will be the aim of the speakers to
make the debate interesting to the
audience. Heretofore, speeches have
been directed at the judges and have
been noteworthy for their dryness. It
will be necessary for the speakers on
January 24 to bold the individual
members of the audience, which ne
cessity will probably alter the type
of speeches presented.
It is probable also that questions
put by members of the audience will
be presented to the debaters for
answer.
Audience decision debating had its
initiation to the Pacific Coast in a
contest last March when the Univer
sity of British Columbia won from
California in Wheeljer hall, Berkeley,
before a packed house.
In judging the debate, Professor
J. G. Emerson, debating coach, ad
vises that the following points be
kept in mind: "It is important that
members fo the audience appreciate
the necessity of an impartial judg
ment. It has been the contention of
those of us sponsoring this style of
debating that university students can
be depended upon to forget university
and personal loyalties, and to give
their decision to the man who does
the most effective debating even
though it may mean defeat for the
home university.
Partisan Votes Undesirable
"Members of the audience must
understand that the home team does
not care for a victory made possible
by partisan votes. It is a question of
good sportsmanship which quite tran
scends the mere winning of a debate.
"Of course, there is such a thing
as standing up so straight that one
leans backwards. That also should be
avoided. Both teams desire victory,
but neither desires it as a result of
any advantage of position or locality.
"The ideal state of mind is the one
that detaches itself from all consider
ations of school or locality and comes
to its conclusions in the cold light of
absolute impartiality."

to its conclusions in the cold light of
absolute impartiality."
There will be no judges at the
Stanford-California debate to be held
in the Little Theater, January 24. In
stead, each member of the audience
will be given a ballot and his vote
will be gathered at the close of the
debate.
The debate will be on the ques
tion, "Should the California criminal
syndicalism law be repealed?" Stan
ley Weigel, '26, and Thomas Bailey,
'24, have been chosen to represent
Stanford.
The question is of interest because
it has to do with the I. W. W. prob
lem in California, and the radical
problem generally.
Aim to Interest Audience
It will be the aim of the speakers to
make the debate interesting to the
audience. Heretofore, speeches have
been directed at the judges and have
been noteworthy for their dryness. It
will be necessary for the speakers on
January 24 to bold the individual
members of the audience, which ne
cessity will probably alter the type
of speeches presented.
It is probable also that questions
put by members of the audience will
be presented to the debaters for
answer.
Audience decision debating had its
initiation to the Pacific Coast in a
contest last March when the Univer
sity of British Columbia won from
California in Wheeljer hall, Berkeley,
before a packed house.
In judging the debate, Professor
J. G. Emerson, debating coach, ad
vises that the following points be
kept in mind: "It is important that
members fo the audience appreciate
the necessity of an impartial judg
ment. It has been the contention of
those of us sponsoring this style of
debating that university students can
be depended upon to forget university
and personal loyalties, and to give
their decision to the man who does
the most effective debating even
though it may mean defeat for the
home university.
Partisan Votes Undesirable
"Members of the audience must
understand that the home team does
not care for a victory made possible
by partisan votes. It is a question of
good sportsmanship which quite tran
scends the mere winning of a debate.
"Of course, there is such a thing
as standing up so straight that one
leans backwards. That also should be
avoided. Both teams desire victory,
but neither desires it as a result of
any advantage of position or locality.
"The ideal state of mind is the one
that detaches itself from all consider
ations of school or locality and comes
to its conclusions in the cold light of
absolute impartiality."
