# The 						Big Day
## 
### 
April 26, 1924, should be recorded as one of the biggest days in Stan
ford's history.
The Rig Meet, Stanford-California baseball games to decide winners
of both varsity and freshman series, Alumni Day, and a statewide conven
tion of high school editors will combine to make the day one long to be
remembered.
Three Stanford-California athletic contests in one day should create
a great deal of interest at any time. This year, they should be even more
interesting than ever before in view of the fact that Stanford will be rep
resented in the spring sports by some of the strongest teams in her history.
"Dink" Templeton has gathered together a track team that is conceded
an excellent chance of winning from the Golden Bear.
Harry Wolter, in his second year as baseball coach has material which
he is expected to weld into a winning nine. Cardinal baseball stock has
risen rapidly since Wolter took the helm and this year should be the logical
one for his team to turn on the Blue and Gold.
University Day, which has always drawn in the neighborhood of one
thousand old timers back to the campus, will undoubtedly bring even more
this year. With track and baseball victories in prospect, it will be hard for
any loyal alumnus to resist the call of his Alma Mater.
One of the most important and far reaching events of the week-end
promises to be the convention of high school editors sponsored by Sigma
Delta Chi, professional journalistic fraternity. The conclave will end on
April 26, according to present plans. Stanford is one of the first universi
ties in the west to attempt such a thing and it is probable that editors and
managers of high school papers from all parts of the state will attend.
The Graduate Manager, his assistants, the administration of the uni
versity, the faculty, Sigma Delta Chi, and all other organizations that will
take part in the program, deserve a great deal of credit for planning and
making possible such a program. If it is carried out as planned, it will be
one of the greatest events in the history of the university.
Much of the planning and a great deal of the work involved can be
done by the men and organizations in charge. The co-operation of the en
tire student body is an absolute necessity if the arrangements are carried
out smoothly. Thousands of visitors will be on the campus. Many of
these must be provided meals and lodging because of inadequate accom
modations in Palo Alto.
Every student in the university will have to appoint himself as a recep
tion committee of one. April 26 is still more than three months away but
by boosting at every opportunity, each Stanford man and woman may
begin right now to help make the day a big success.
