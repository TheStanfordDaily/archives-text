"Yeh, looka that guyâ€”polishin' apples again." This from a hard egg
on the English corner, pointing a dirty finger of scorn "at a man who was
walking up Quad with a professor, and for some reason seemed to be in

do you know about professors? Did you ever try to talk to any of them?
Or are you one of the silly sheep who tries to stop what little progress is
being made towards meeting of faculty and students on a common ground
by your damfool notions and catch phrases that heap unthinking contempt
on the people who are trying to get an education ? Who are you to slam real
students in fruit-peddlers' jargon?"
