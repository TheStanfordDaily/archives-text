# CAMPUS TO VOTE ON PEACE PLAN AWARD
## 
### 
Balloting on the Bok Peace Plan
selected by the Jury of Awards will
start on the campus as soon as the
ballots arrive, which will be not later
than January 18, according to word
received this morning from New York
by Professor Graham 11. Stuart, in
charge of the voting on the campus.
The ballots were shipped from New
York on January S and will arrive
within ten days, according to a tele
gram from the East this morning.
Three thousand ballots and 3,000 plans
in booklet form were in the consign
ment from the Bok Peace Plan head
quarters.
Balloting has already been started
in the East and the returns show a
decided vote in favor of the selection
of Elihu Root's committee. Palo Alto
residents have been asked to express
their opinions concerning the sug
gested plan of peace by ballots in the
daily papers, by ballots distributed
by the churches among their mem
bers, and by ballots given out by
business houses to their employes.
The Palo Alto merchants will meet
tonight to discuss the proposition pre
sented by the Bok committee and
votes of the Palo Alto residents will
be received by the Chamber of Com
merce. the official agency for their
collection.
Campus to Vote in Groups
Campus voting will be done by liv
ing groups. Professor Stuart will ap
point some member of each group to
conduct the voting in his house or
hall and to present the plan to liis
fellow-students. The results of this
group voting will he returned to Pro
fessor Stuart's office in the Political
Science department building. Ballots
will be available for those outside of
campus living groups at the Y. M.
| C. A., Professor Stuart's office, and
| in the columns of the Daily Palo Alto.
The freshmen will vote through their
citizenship classes.
The United States Senate is re
ported to have demanded a senate in
vestigation of the Bok Peace Plan
idea and its operation, since charges
that Chairman Elihu Root of the Jury
of Awards has been unable to attend
to the selection on account of sickness
have been rampant. Brand Whitlock
of the same committee is charged to
have been abroad for some time and
also unable to work on the plan.
Senate Fails at Appreciation
"The Senate does not appear to ap
preciate the true value of the Bok
Peace Plan," said Professor Stuart
today. "They are trying to laugh it
out of court as the last resort,when
they have become actually scared by
the intense seriousness of the plan.
What action the Bok committees will
take depends on the action of the
Senate investigating committee and
the response of the people of the
country in the voting which is now
going on."
There are seven members on the j
Jury of Awards which has had sole
charge of the selection of the win
ning plan from among approximately
165,000 plans submitted. Elihu Root is
the chairman of the Jury. Edward M.
House, ex-President Wilson's intimate
friend, is on the body. Roscoe Pounds,
dean of the Harvard Law School;
William Allen White, editor of the
Emporia (Kansas) Gazette; Brand
Whitlock, former United States am
bassador to Belgium; James Guthrie

Harbord; and Ellen P. Pembleton,
complete the committee.
A meeting to discuss the Bok plan
will be held in the Women's Club
house tomorrow night at 7:30. Pro
fessor Stuart will deliver a short ad
dress to acquaint the students with
the plan and will then turn the meet
ing over to a student chairman who
will conduct an informal discussion
i of the subject. Men and women are
i till cordially invited to attend and ex
| press their views of the matter. The
I meeting is being held under the aus
: pices of the Y. M. C. A., Y. W. C. A.,
| Cosmopolitan Club, Forum, Nestoria,
| Euphronia, and Wranglers.
