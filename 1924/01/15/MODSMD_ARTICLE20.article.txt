MIDNIGHT NUMBER
1. Poem About Midnight
Often o'er the stilly night
I hear an echo calling;
It is, alas, a saddening sight
The temperature is falling.
2. Essay About Midnight
Midnight comes exactly half-way between six o'clock p.m. and six o'clock
a.m. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for it—it might just as
well come half way between eight o'clock p.m. and eight o'clock a.m., or
half-way between ten o'clock p.m. and ten o'clock a.m. But it doesn't. No,
sir. It comes half-way between six o'clock p.m. and six o'clock a.m.
Midnight is when witches are at their best. The early part of the evening
is too damp, and if there is any one thing that bothers witches it is asthma.
And then any time after midnight the poor things just can't keep awake, so
what are they to do. They just have to pick on midnight, that's all. A witch
has no opportunity to run down to the Union and take on a couple of cups of
coffee and dash away on a new broom, slightly refreshed. A witch just has to
depend on an occasional fried pixie sandwich or pickled hobgoblin for
nourishment.
Midnight is also, as luck would have it, just fifteen minutes after the
Theater Train leaves San Francisco. Consequently anyone arriving at Third
and Townsend at midnight misses the Theater Train. It looks as though
there was something sinister about that coincidence, doesn't it? There is,
too. The sinister thing is that the next train leaves at two-thirty and they
won't let you sleep on the benches in the station.
3. A Short History of Midnight
Midnight was firfet mentioned in an early Celtic ballad. Knlghlndwm, king
of the West Goths, was spending the week-end with Wlpdehx, king of the
East Goths. One night he said to the king of the East Goths, "It is midnight."
The king of the East Goths had replied, "Yes, it is midnight." That settled
that. And down through the ages has come the saying. It is unnecessary
to trace its progress through the middle ages—except to say that Henry II
once remarked: "It is midnight" and Queen Victoria is reported unofficially
to have said: "It looks like midnight." At any rate, the term is still with us.

a.m. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for it—it might just as
well come half way between eight o'clock p.m. and eight o'clock a.m., or
half-way between ten o'clock p.m. and ten o'clock a.m. But it doesn't. No,
sir. It comes half-way between six o'clock p.m. and six o'clock a.m.
Midnight is when witches are at their best. The early part of the evening
is too damp, and if there is any one thing that bothers witches it is asthma.
And then any time after midnight the poor things just can't keep awake, so
what are they to do. They just have to pick on midnight, that's all. A witch
has no opportunity to run down to the Union and take on a couple of cups of
coffee and dash away on a new broom, slightly refreshed. A witch just has to
depend on an occasional fried pixie sandwich or pickled hobgoblin for
nourishment.
Midnight is also, as luck would have it, just fifteen minutes after the
Theater Train leaves San Francisco. Consequently anyone arriving at Third
and Townsend at midnight misses the Theater Train. It looks as though
there was something sinister about that coincidence, doesn't it? There is,
too. The sinister thing is that the next train leaves at two-thirty and they
won't let you sleep on the benches in the station.
3. A Short History of Midnight
Midnight was firfet mentioned in an early Celtic ballad. Knlghlndwm, king
of the West Goths, was spending the week-end with Wlpdehx, king of the
East Goths. One night he said to the king of the East Goths, "It is midnight."
The king of the East Goths had replied, "Yes, it is midnight." That settled
that. And down through the ages has come the saying. It is unnecessary
to trace its progress through the middle ages—except to say that Henry II
once remarked: "It is midnight" and Queen Victoria is reported unofficially
to have said: "It looks like midnight." At any rate, the term is still with us.

Often o'er the stilly night
I hear an echo calling;
It is, alas, a saddening sight
The temperature is falling.
