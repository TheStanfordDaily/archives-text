# PRINCETON HOCKEY PLAYER IS KILLED
## 
### 
PRINCETONâ€”HaroId B. Reese, a
member of the Princeton freshman
hockey team, died last night as the
result of an injury received Saturday
when he was struck on the head by
a hockey stick during a game between
the Princeton freshmen and the New
York branch of the Canadian Royal
Bank.

The sun's heat will last for another
billion years or so, say the scientists.
There need be no fear of the sun's
"dying" too quickly, and of the earth's
getting cold.
