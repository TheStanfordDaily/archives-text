# HONOR SYSTEM AT CORNELL QUESTIONED; FAILS AT ILLINOIS
## 
### 
"The Honor System is passing through
its most severe trial since its inaugura
tion at Cornell," says the Cornell Alumni
News. "The first enthusiasm of its sup
porters is waning, or at least is not as
ardentiy active as at the inception of the
plan.
The cheaters —some of whom are al
ways with us—are chafing under the re
straint undoubtedly imposed, and they
are bent on devising methods to circum
vent it. The main body of the students
is impassive and somewhat inert as com
pared with its attention when the sys
tem was a more commanding subject for
discussion. * * * The one salient fact
about the system is that mor-e violations
have been reported by the faculty than
by fellow students."
Few Cases Reported by Students
At Stanford very few cases have been
reported by students, other than those
on the Council, especially in cases of
cheating, according to A1 Masters, stu
dent body president. He says: "Pro
fessors are in a better position to detect
cheating by finding duplicate papers.
However, I must admit that the fact
that the students fail to report cases of
cheating is a bad feature of our system."
At the University of Illinois, the honor
system has been abandoned, and the old
proctor system of examination resorted
to.
"When the system was started it was
with the expectation that the students
would report violations, but experience
seems to have proved that not only have
most of the violations been reported by
the faculty, but that many persons have
escaped altogether. * * * Another diffi
culty is that students simply won't
'squeal','' says an alumni publication of
the University of Illinois.
Successful on Pacific Coast
Despite these results at other institu
tions, the honor system on the Pacific
Coast is progressing. It has been suc
cessful so far at the University of Cali
fornia, Pacific University, University of
Southern California, University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch. University of
Washington, Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, Occidental, and Davis Farm. The
University of British Columbia, Wash
ington State, Oregon, and Nevada are
the only ones that have not the honor
system. It was defeated at Nevada be
cause of the form in which it was pre
sented rather than upon principle.
Convention Approves Code
The Pacific Student Presidents' Asso
ciation convention at Idaho last spring
went on record as favoring the honor
system "insofar as it was fortified by
sentiment among the students and the
faculty, rather than by code and enforce
ment of code."
"I think that the honor system at Stan
ford depends on the Council," says
Masters. "They can make or break it.
So far, I think that the honor system
here has been successful. Our system is
not perfect; far from it. But its oper
ation should be on the basis of an un
written code, rather than junder rules
and regulations."

vent it. The main body of the students
is impassive and somewhat inert as com
pared with its attention when the sys
tem was a more commanding subject for
discussion. * * * The one salient fact
about the system is that mor-e violations
have been reported by the faculty than
by fellow students."
Few Cases Reported by Students
At Stanford very few cases have been
reported by students, other than those
on the Council, especially in cases of
cheating, according to A1 Masters, stu
dent body president. He says: "Pro
fessors are in a better position to detect
cheating by finding duplicate papers.
However, I must admit that the fact
that the students fail to report cases of
cheating is a bad feature of our system."
At the University of Illinois, the honor
system has been abandoned, and the old
proctor system of examination resorted
to.
"When the system was started it was
with the expectation that the students
would report violations, but experience
seems to have proved that not only have
most of the violations been reported by
the faculty, but that many persons have
escaped altogether. * * * Another diffi
culty is that students simply won't
'squeal','' says an alumni publication of
the University of Illinois.
Successful on Pacific Coast
Despite these results at other institu
tions, the honor system on the Pacific
Coast is progressing. It has been suc
cessful so far at the University of Cali
fornia, Pacific University, University of
Southern California, University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch. University of
Washington, Oregon Agricultural Col
lege, Occidental, and Davis Farm. The
University of British Columbia, Wash
ington State, Oregon, and Nevada are
the only ones that have not the honor
system. It was defeated at Nevada be
cause of the form in which it was pre
sented rather than upon principle.
Convention Approves Code
The Pacific Student Presidents' Asso
ciation convention at Idaho last spring
went on record as favoring the honor
system "insofar as it was fortified by
sentiment among the students and the
faculty, rather than by code and enforce
ment of code."
"I think that the honor system at Stan
ford depends on the Council," says
Masters. "They can make or break it.
So far, I think that the honor system
here has been successful. Our system is
not perfect; far from it. But its oper
ation should be on the basis of an un
written code, rather than junder rules
and regulations."
"The Honor System is passing through
its most severe trial since its inaugura
tion at Cornell," says the Cornell Alumni
News. "The first enthusiasm of its sup
porters is waning, or at least is not as
ardentiy active as at the inception of the
plan.
The cheaters —some of whom are al
ways with us—are chafing under the re
straint undoubtedly imposed, and they
are bent on devising methods to circum
vent it. The main body of the students
is impassive and somewhat inert as com
