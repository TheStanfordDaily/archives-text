# In the Good Old Days

Eleven thousand years ago in the Prehistoric World's Series, Babe Flintclub,
pride of the Stone Age, came to bat with the bases full and his team needing
two runs to win the championship. It is carved on the stones that have come
down through the ages that Babe struck out and that Bob Sabretooth, pride
of the Meusel-Age, saved the day with a soul-splitting single.
Three thousand years ago a Kink named Tut lost his ball in the water
hazard of the 18th hole of the Kings' Valley course, when he topped his drive.
It went smack into the open mouth of an alligator. Being a golfer, he was a
liar, and so told his caddy and his daddy and his mummy that he had made the
hole in one. As he was a king, they dared not question him.
Fifty years from now the boxing records show that Harry Wills finally got
a fight with Dempsey. The two veteran battlers met in wheel-chairs and
pasted each other with a crutch and an umbrella until their false teeth fell
out and the fight was stopped on account of brutality.
In about four hundred years the world watched with interest the big
International event of the season â€”the aerial polo match between America
and Britain, held at flie Polo Skies, New York. America won; the English
team being handicapped because their ribbed and slotted polo mallets were
ruled out at the last minute by the rules committee.
