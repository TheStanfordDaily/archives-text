## 
### 
One default yesterday marred the j
first day's play of the second week, |.
officially called Round 2, in the in- j
| tramural basketball tournament, j
; Breakers defaulting to Sigma Nu.
The winners of the day were: Phi J
| Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Beta j
Theta Pi; Delta Chi having won over j
Phi Gamma Delta Sunday in a game !
advanced from yesterday's schedule, i
Sigma Too Fast
Sigma Chi proved too fast for Kap
pa Alpha and overwhelmed it in a.
mediocre game by 26 to 2. The Kappa
! Alpha five was able to show very j
! little team work and passed seldom, j
while the Sigma Chi quintet made a
'creditable showing in that d,epart
; ment.
Timmons led the winners, scoring
j twelve points the first half and the
period ended 21 to 2 with Sigma Chi
j in the lead.
Sigma Chi put in a new team in ■
1 the second half, but the showing of j
the first period was not repeated,
and only five tallies were made.
The Phi Delta Theta five won from
the Encina fourth floor quintet 14 to
13, in a game that went an extra five
minute period.
The Phi Delts had the larger end
of the scoring in the first period
through their ability to carry (the
hall down the floor. The half ended
10 to 3, Phi Delts leading, after
several good shots by Fletcher.
Encina Men Improve
The Encina five began the second
half on the jump and scored on the
first play. Phi Delta Theta had start
ed its second string men but were
forced to put the regulars in after
the hall team carried the ball down
into their territory and scored five
points. Near the end of the second
half, Encina tied the score by a
long shot necessitating an extra
five-minute period.
Avery, for Encina, scored three
points, but Fletcher dropped in two
field goals and saved the game for
the Phi Delts.
Playter and Fletcher tied in
honors in scoring for Phi Delta The
ta—each being credited with six
points. Logan also played a good
game and accounted for two points.
For the Encina five, Morril, at
guard, Avery, the fast center, and
Fletcher, at guard, showed up well.
Betas Use Team Work
Good team work kept the \Alpha
Kappa Lambda five guessing and won
for the Betas 18 to 7.
Scoring was slow in the first half
hut the Betas, after three minutes of
play, tossed in a field goal. Follow
ing this play, superior passing kept
the ball in Beta territory most of
the time, while A. K. L. was unable
to take advantage of its few oppor
j Utilities to score.
Howe tallied the only field goal for
A. K. L. and the first half ended 12
to-3.
Betas Retain Lead
Lack of wind forced a slowing up
in the Beta's speed in the second
period but, nevertheless, they man
aged to retain the lead. Howe scored
four additional points for A. K. L.
the second half but the good Beta
defense prevented further scoring. The
game ended 18 to 7.
Alabaster, Smith, and Tibbe made
a fast combination for the winners,
Alabaster leading the scoring with
eight points, Tibbe following with six,
and Smith with four.
Cornell, Milliken, and Howe showed
up well for Alpha Kappa Lambda.

from 10,000 to 60,000 seeds.

the Encina fourth floor quintet 14 to
13, in a game that went an extra five
minute period.
The Phi Delts had the larger end
of the scoring in the first period
through their ability to carry (the
hall down the floor. The half ended
10 to 3, Phi Delts leading, after
several good shots by Fletcher.
Encina Men Improve
The Encina five began the second
half on the jump and scored on the
first play. Phi Delta Theta had start
ed its second string men but were
forced to put the regulars in after
the hall team carried the ball down
into their territory and scored five
points. Near the end of the second
half, Encina tied the score by a
long shot necessitating an extra
five-minute period.
Avery, for Encina, scored three
points, but Fletcher dropped in two
field goals and saved the game for
the Phi Delts.
Playter and Fletcher tied in
honors in scoring for Phi Delta The
ta—each being credited with six
points. Logan also played a good
game and accounted for two points.
For the Encina five, Morril, at
guard, Avery, the fast center, and
Fletcher, at guard, showed up well.
Betas Use Team Work
Good team work kept the \Alpha
Kappa Lambda five guessing and won
for the Betas 18 to 7.
Scoring was slow in the first half
hut the Betas, after three minutes of
play, tossed in a field goal. Follow
ing this play, superior passing kept
the ball in Beta territory most of
the time, while A. K. L. was unable
to take advantage of its few oppor
j Utilities to score.
Howe tallied the only field goal for
A. K. L. and the first half ended 12
to-3.
Betas Retain Lead
Lack of wind forced a slowing up
in the Beta's speed in the second
period but, nevertheless, they man
aged to retain the lead. Howe scored
four additional points for A. K. L.
the second half but the good Beta
defense prevented further scoring. The
game ended 18 to 7.
Alabaster, Smith, and Tibbe made
a fast combination for the winners,
Alabaster leading the scoring with
eight points, Tibbe following with six,
and Smith with four.
