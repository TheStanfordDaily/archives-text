# "MILESTONES" CAST HOLDS REHEARSALS IN ZOOLOGY LOBBY
## Marjorie Allen,"Poppy Faire" Of "Captain Applejack" Has Amusing Role 
### 
"Milestones," as yet in a formative
stage, is being rehearsed each evening in
the lobby of the Zoology building, while
the Assembly hall rings with Ram's Head
"Smiles."
In its present condition the most in
teresting element of the Masquers' play
is the acting of Marjorie Allen. Last
quarter she was seen in the very juvenile
role of Poppy I'aire in "Captain Apple
jack," while now she appears in the last
of her "three ages" as a very old grand
mother. The contrast is remarkable.
"A Play of Three Ages" was the sub
caption on the billboards when "Mile
stones" was first produced in New York.
The framework of the plot is entirely
contained in that title. Buster Keaton's
recent cinema comedy bearing the same
headline derived much of its human and
historical interest from the fact that
the same persons were seen doing similar
things in three distinct centuries. For
the same reason "Milestones" was a suc
cess with the same people in different
decades.
First is the age of crinolins and wood
en ships, 1860, aud we find young John
Rhead (Cecil Morris) defying his elders
and marrying the girl of his choice
whether or no; 1885 is the time of the
next scene, where iron ships and bustles
are the commonplace things of life in
the Rhead household. John Rhead here
is as hard-shelled as his step-father was
before him and forces his daughter to
marry a chuck-headed lord.
In the last act we are brought down
to the present day, in which the younger
generation has a few ideas of its own
on certain subjects. When grandfather
Rhead tries to manage his granddaugh
ter's matrimonial future and forbids her
marriage to her dashing lover she re
plies, "I said we were going to get mar
ried." and the matter is settled. "We
live to learn," sighs the old man. "Yes,
John," answers his wife, and the curtain
falls.
