clothes show good
taste
Don't forget that most folks judge
you by your clothes; not your brains,
nor strength, nor intelligence; they
judge your taste.
It makes the selection of a suit some
thing more than just buying clothes.
Hart Schaffner & Marx clothes
offer so many good styles and
fabrics and so much certainty
of quality, that you'd better
buy no other clothes.
