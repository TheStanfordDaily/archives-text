# FRESHMAN DEBATERS WILL MEET TEAMS FROM TWO COLLEGES
## 
### 
Arrangements for dual debates with
the freshman teams of the University
of California and the College of the
Pacific are now heing made by Fresh
man Debating Manager Charles Scott.
No definite dates for the two debates
have been selected.
Tryouts for the freshman debating
team will take place January 30 at
7:30 p.m. in the Little Theater. The
tryouts will be held under the direc
tion of the Euphronia and Nestoria
debating societies and Delta Sigma
Rho, honorary debating fraternity.
In case of a large turnout ten men
will be selected for the teams.
The question for the tryouts is:
"Resolved, that the United States
should recognize the present govern
ment of Russia."
Speeches by tryoutees will be lim
ited to five minutes with three-minute
rebuttals.
Last year the freshman class won
both the affirmative and the negative
side of the question in the debate with
the University of California freshmen.
Because of the increased interest be
ing shown this year in forensic work,
it has been decided that the class will
be able to increase the schedule.
