# ENGLISH CLUB NOT TO PRESENT ANNUAL PLAY THIS SEASON
## 
### 
As the result of a confusion of dates,
the English Club will not present its
annual play this year, it was an
nounced today, following action of the
Executive Committee at its meeting
last night. The date announced for
the English Club production, March 7,
was given the Glee Club last quarter.
The records were subsequently lost,
and the date tentatively granted Eng
lish Club. This action was reversed
last evening, when the closed date was
restored to the Glee Club for a con
cert and dance.
Two assistant yell leaders will be
elected in June rather than in the fall,
was the recommendation of the Execu
tive Committee last night. No action
was taken on the suggestion, the mo
tion being laid on the table for further
consideration.
The purpose of the change would be
to give the senior yell leader and his
assistants more time in which to work
up the bleacher stunts for the Big
Game. Work on the stunts could be
begun during the summer.
Under the new plan tryouts for the
assistant leaders would be held dur
ing the basketball season and the
men would be voted upon during the
regular spring elections.
M. S. C. That Beverly Baillard be
appointed chairman of the election
board vice Jake Irwin.
M. S. C. That the Executive Com
mitte recommend to Men's Council
that all punishments meted out by
that body should be printed in the
Daily Palo Alto.
The committee considered the pro
position of urging merchants to with
draw their support from the ad blot
ters which are dispersed on the cam
pus by individuals since their dis
persal tends to injure the advertising
business of campus publications.
The following dates were granted:
Union Club, formal, January 25; Glee
Club, concert and dance, March 7;
Theta Xi, informal (changed from
March 1), February 22; Masonic Club,
