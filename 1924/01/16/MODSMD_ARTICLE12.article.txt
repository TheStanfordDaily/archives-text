# MEN'S COUNCIL PUNISHES DANCE RULE VIOLATORS
## 
### 
Two men were penalized for vio- [
lation of rules during vacation at the
regular meeting of the Men's Coun-!
cil yesterday afternoon.
The Council recommended that all;
organizations be particularly careful;
to instruct their members thoroughly
about the rules governing campus
dances. The rules made by the
Associated Students which prohibit
the giving of dances by individuals for
private profit and the regulations
about chaperones are in force
throughout the year on the campus,
including all vacations.
In addition to this action, the Coun
cil reprimanded a fraternity for vio
lating the rule requiring a list of
chaperones to be handed in to the
office of the Dean of Women at
least three days prior to the dance.
