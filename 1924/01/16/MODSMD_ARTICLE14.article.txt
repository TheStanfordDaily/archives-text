# CARD, FRIAR, FIVES TO MEET SATURDAY
## Fawke, Santa Clara Guard, Expected to Star on Mission Line-Up 
### David Meiklejohn 
Santa Clara and Stanford quintets
meet next Saturday night in the pa-:
vilion in what promises to be a third
victory for the Card five.
Although the Friars are always full
of surprises it is doubtful if they
will be able to put over a winning
punch against the strong Cardinal
quintet that laced the Olympic Club
31 to 11 last Saturday.
Last year the Santa Clara aggrega
tion put up a game fight, but the best
it could do was to carry a 26 to 16
defeat at the hands of the varsity j
cage men. The season before, however,
Santa Clara unexpectedly held the
Stanford team 23 to 22. The dope be-!
fore the contest indicated that Stan
ford should have won by a large mar-|
gin.
"Moose" Fawke, of Santa Clara foot
ball fame, will possibly start at stand
ing guard. The big Friar fullback
caused no end of trouble in last year's j
game. He was one o fthe main rea
sons why Stanford did not score so
consistently as in previous games that |
season.
Mcßurney is shaping up so well at
running guard for Stanford that it j
looks as if the doubtful question of a
strong defense, which was so preva
lent at the beginning of the season, j
can soon be thrown in the discard.
Mcßurney is showing all the form that
is expected of a man in that position,
and there is little doubt but that lie ■
will keep the other candidates for the i
job on the hump.
Howard Mitchell is also a possi- i
bility for running guard that cannot
be lightly passed up. Mitchell is going
great guns in practice. He has the
speed, and the ability to shoot bas- :
kets, as well as to pass accurately
about the court. It is somewhat of a
relief to find a dependable substitute
for the position; for it is one 'that
requires all the stamina that a player
possesses, and to have a reserve handy,
gives the varsity that much addod
strength.
Ernie Nevers has found a perma
nent place on the varsity. He has
come through with everything that
was expected of him, and perhaps a
♦ rifle more. His playing in the Olym
pic game was above par as the total,
of his scoring in the game goes to
prove.

about the court. It is somewhat of a
relief to find a dependable substitute
for the position; for it is one 'that
requires all the stamina that a player
possesses, and to have a reserve handy,
gives the varsity that much addod
strength.
Ernie Nevers has found a perma
nent place on the varsity. He has
come through with everything that
was expected of him, and perhaps a
♦ rifle more. His playing in the Olym
pic game was above par as the total,
of his scoring in the game goes to
prove.
Santa Clara and Stanford quintets
meet next Saturday night in the pa-:
vilion in what promises to be a third
victory for the Card five.
Although the Friars are always full
of surprises it is doubtful if they
will be able to put over a winning
punch against the strong Cardinal
quintet that laced the Olympic Club
31 to 11 last Saturday.
Last year the Santa Clara aggrega
tion put up a game fight, but the best
it could do was to carry a 26 to 16
defeat at the hands of the varsity j
cage men. The season before, however,
Santa Clara unexpectedly held the
Stanford team 23 to 22. The dope be-!
fore the contest indicated that Stan
ford should have won by a large mar-|
gin.
"Moose" Fawke, of Santa Clara foot
ball fame, will possibly start at stand
ing guard. The big Friar fullback
caused no end of trouble in last year's j
game. He was one o fthe main rea
sons why Stanford did not score so
consistently as in previous games that |
season.
Mcßurney is shaping up so well at
running guard for Stanford that it j
looks as if the doubtful question of a
strong defense, which was so preva
lent at the beginning of the season, j
can soon be thrown in the discard.
Mcßurney is showing all the form that
is expected of a man in that position,
and there is little doubt but that lie ■
will keep the other candidates for the i
job on the hump.
Howard Mitchell is also a possi- i
bility for running guard that cannot
be lightly passed up. Mitchell is going
great guns in practice. He has the
speed, and the ability to shoot bas- :
kets, as well as to pass accurately
about the court. It is somewhat of a
relief to find a dependable substitute
for the position; for it is one 'that
requires all the stamina that a player
possesses, and to have a reserve handy,
