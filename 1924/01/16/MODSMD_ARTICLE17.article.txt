# PROFESSOR NOYES COMPARES POLISH WORKS TO RUSSIAN
## 
### 
The peculiar contrast between Rus
sian and Polish literature was brought
out by Professor George R. Noyes, of
the University of California, in his
lecture yesterday evening.
Russian literature he characterized
as rational, pessimistic, and sticking
close to facts, while he considers
Polish literary works to be of the
highest imaginative quality, poetic,
and optimistic, of a buoyancy that
seems to be hoping against hope.
Polish Literature Optimistic
"The literature of Poland is pre
eminently optimistic in quality, and
imbued with a high degree of a
patriotic spirit," he declared. "This is
one of the reasons why Polish litera
ture is less known outside that coun
try than the literature of any other
country. Its beauty and charm dis
appear in translation. It is poetic in
form, and those who know Polish to
translate it, are not poets."
The national life of the divided and
enslaved country has found expres
sion almost entirely in its literature,
according to Professor Noyes. He dis
cussed the work of three outstanding
Polish authors, Mickiewicz, Krasvisti,
and Sienkiewicz.
Poland Called Christ of Europe
"Mickiewicz is the national poet of
Poland. His works are better known
among the Poles than Shakespeare's
among the English," said Professor
Noyes. "He evolved the fantastic idea
that Poland is the Christ of the Euro
pean countries, crucified for the sins
of the others, and awaiting a glorious
resurrection. The discrepancies in
this comparison lie in the fact that
Christ's sacrifice was voluntary, while
Poland's was forced."
Sienkiewicz is the only one of the
writers who has become known out
side of Poland. Professor Noyes ex
plained this as due to the kind of
literature which Sienkiewicz writes,
a "blood and thunder" type of story,
like Ivanhoe to the Nth power. His
stories are gorgeous and gaudy, but
are relieved from vulgarity and coarse
ness by the strain of patriotism char
acteristic of Polish authors, and the
optimism peculiar to his countrymen.
"The literature of Poland has been
the one great factor in keeping alive
the spirit of the nation," concluded
Professor Noyes. "It expresses the
will to live, the will to be independent,
pride in the past, and confidence in
the future."
