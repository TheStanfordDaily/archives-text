"Bawl-Out" proofs, which were posted on the bulletin hoard of the
administration building today, may or may not indicate just what a man
or woman is getting out of college.
While the Daily Palo Alto does not minimize the value of academic
work, it does believe that a great deal of benefit can be derived from extra
curricula activities. Fifteen plus 30, 90 plus 180 or 100 plus 0 may mean
a great deal or very little.
It is a truism that a college student's first and most important obliga
tion is to his studies. However, getting out for some activity and staying
out. is second in importance, only to "hitting the books."
By systematically arranging his or her time, a student may find more
time for a good share of outside activities. Associations made in athletics,
journalism, dramatics, debating and other activities are to any one's ad
vantage. The man who comes to Stanford, buries his nose in a book his
first week here and does not remove it until he graduates will undoubtedly
get good marks.
What he will obtain in addition to those good marks is questionable.
He neither will have the value of associations gained in activities, nor
friendships cultivated in the ordinary course of campus life.
He will accept his diploma with "distinction" or "great distinction,"
walk calmly out into the world, and proceed to get the experience he
should have gotten while in college. D. E- L-
