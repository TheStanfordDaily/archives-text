"What arc you going to do when you
graduate?" we asked of a senior the
other day.
He removed bis sombrero and
scratched his head thoughtfully.
"Well, I dunno. I'm going home after
commencement, rest up a little while, and
then look around."
Last year one of the well-known
seniors of the class of '23 tried precisely
the same experiment. He is still "look
ing around."
Real effort toward getting a job
should be begun many months before
commencement day. The hardest time
in the year to obtain work is after the
various colleges of the state pour their
graduates into the commonwealth, and
expect them to cam a living.
A word to the wise is sufficient.

$20 a month.
