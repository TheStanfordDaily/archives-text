# THERE IS A PLACE FOR THE CRANK

A typical American characteristic is
the fact that there are so many persons
not satisfied with things as they arc.
They are always advocating changes or
even worse are merely "crabbing" with
out even offering any constructive sug
gestions.
But after all, is not this an admirable
and beneficial characteristic? Our gov
ernment, our laws, our institutions and
our mode of living arc not perfect.
Tliere is, therefore, a place for the one
who advocates a change, unless he be
comes too radical in his viewpoint.
Being dissatisfied with conditions as
they are is a mark of ambition. There
is a place for the crank, but there is no
place for the "crab."

The first marriage in the White
House was that of a sister-in-law of
President Madison.
