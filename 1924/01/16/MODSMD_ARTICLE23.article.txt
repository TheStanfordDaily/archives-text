Classes wei>e held last week.
The Silver Cornet Coneert band was expelled from its traditional quarters
in the Engineering building last week. Prof. Martin, our genial band leader,
is wearing a frown these days.
The Union store served snails and coffee this week. Our merchants
are always up to date.
A false alarm was turned in to the local fire department last week.
The gallant firemen responded with customary efficiency. From the
number of false alarms around these parts, it's funny that no more of
them get in to the fire house, say we.
A number of engagements was announced last week. Ye editor extends
to one and all of the young folks his happiest felicitations. Good luck, say we.
Rushing is being carried on by sororities this week. It is being viewed
with considerable interest by all and sundry.
Classes are being held this week.
Motion picture films are on view at both Paly theaters this week. Our
dramatic magnates are always up to date.
Our popular young president, Mr. Ray Wilbur, made a speech last week
He is always welcome on whatever platform.
Ram's Head is getting ready this week to put on the annual show.
The wit of the campus has been engaged in writing said show for some
time past. Ah, there, Mike!
It is rumored that Gene Trago, our popular young vocalist, will direct the
Ram's Head show. Gene is a young man with a great future, we predict.
ft is reported that one of our fraternities is in difficulties over rushing
rules on account of a freshman forgetting to remove the pin before going to
gym. Such practices must and shall be tramped out.
A concert was held in the town hall last week. A number of charm
ing pieces was beautifully rendered by the talented artists.
Classes will be held next week. —D. L
