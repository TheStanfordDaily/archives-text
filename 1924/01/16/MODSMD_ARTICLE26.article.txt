# STUDENTS APPRECIATE FOOD WITH CLASSES
## 
### 
The general unrest of students en
rolled in the free reading classes of
the English department may be due
to the news about the "five o'clock
tea" at which one of the instructors
treated his section at its meeting last
week. All those students except the
lucky few have been intrigued by the
idea of discussions accompanied by
the stimulation of food and are se
cretly wishing that this wise example
be followed by other sections of the
class.

Nineteen iwenty-three was a big
year for Yale in athletics. In addition
to winning the Eastern football cham
pionship, Yale teams captured the in
tercollegiate basketball and baseball
S championships and the Big Three
| track and rowing titles.
