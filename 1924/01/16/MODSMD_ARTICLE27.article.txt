# CAMERA WORK IS AMUSING
## Palo Alto Artist Cites Incidents Which Offer Study Of Human Nature 
### Bradley Riter 
In all probability, there is no more
difficult and perplexing profession
than the science of taking pictures or
making portraits from behind the
camera. Nor is there any professional
who receives as little credit for his
efforts. However, it is an interesting
vocation with unlimited fields of
progress.
So says William Edward Newton,
Palo Alto artist, and photographer of
many of the most noted people of the
world.
Success Depends on Talent
"Success depends chiefly upon tal
ent, a thorough understanding of art,
and the application of this art. A suc
cessful artist must be a keen student
of human nature and have the ability
of putting soul into his work by bring
ing out the inner man. Anyone can
photograph his shell, but it takes an
artist to portray the real man."
But this profession also has its
humorous side, and the amusing inci
dents encountered under the skylight
offer a keen insight into human na
ture.
"For example," Mr. Newton says,
"a young lady enters the studio. She
says she would like her portrait made,
but wishes first, to explain that she
has never had a successful picture
taken before, and adds, 'If you succeed,
you will be the first,' which story is
as old as frost-bitten whiskers.
The Know-lt-AII Type
"Of course she says that the pho
tographer knows his business, but
rambles on that she cannot take a
profile because her nose is too long,
and her mouth is too large for a front
view; she cannot look up because her
eyes are too light, and she cannot
look down because of that horrid dou
ble chin. Now she will leave the rest
to the artist.
"After carefully arranging all de
tails and the photographer is about
to press the bulb, the fair one jumps
about two feet out of focus, and with
her face beaming with expectancy,
wonders if you think she would
'screen' well. Of course you say 'yes,'
all the time thinking of the kind \ised
in caging up fowls, commonly called
'chickens.'
Another Brings Along Chum
"Then comes the girl who brings
along her chum to make her smile,"
Mr. Newton continues. '"She's so
funny, you know.'
"And then there's the red-headed
200-pounder with the starched white
waist and plaid skirt, who brings in
Mary Pickford's picture and requests
that you make one just like it.
"Following this, comes the 'old
young mother' with her first baby
which is the nicest little darling in
the world.
"And the newlyweds who slip over
a kiss when they think you are taking
a nap tinder the camera blanket.
Smile Practicers Many
"And the subject, which is not al

ways a woman, who practices a smile
thinking you are adjusting screws or
something on the back of the camera,
while in reality you are carefully
weighing and studying every feature.
"Not infrequently, the photographer
is instructed by the subject as to just
what to do and what not to do; thus
the quotation, 'A little knowledge is
a dangerous thing."
Artist Needs Confidence
The most successful portrait, Mr.
Newton says, is obtained by the sub
ject placing complete confidence in
the artist's ability. "If he is not quali
fied, why patronize him?"
After photographing many different
types of people, Mr. Newton contends
that the most difficult subjects to
portray are the great singers, prob
ably because of being temperamental
and high-strung. And the easiest of
all are children, "who are made to
forget themselves more readily than
adults and come closer to that good
old natural self."
