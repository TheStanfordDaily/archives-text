# Junior Women's Basket Appears on Field With Ferocious Mascot
## 
### 
A growling leopard made its ap- J
pearance on the basketball field in ;
back of the Roble gymnasium yester-'
day afternoon. The proud owners of j
the diminutive boast are the women
of the Junior class who insist that
the animal will bring luck to '25.
The grand entry of the mascot was
made amidst the cries of admiration
from all those who could catch a
glimpse of the orange and black hide
and furiously-brandished tail. The
leopard bears the class numerals on
both sides so that there could be no
doubt about its identity.
The idea of a mascot and its se
lection were decided upon last quar
ter when the junior hockey squad had
their annual dinner.
