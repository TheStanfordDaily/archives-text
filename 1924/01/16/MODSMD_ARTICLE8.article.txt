# FROSH SQUAD CUT FOR GAME TONIGHT WITH SANTA CLARA
## 
### 
The thrice-victorious Stanford fresh
men will meet the Santa Clara fresh
men in the pavilion at 8 o'clock this
evening. This will be the main game
of the evening, and will be preceded
by a 130-pound team game against
the Palo Alto High School 130-pound
team.
Coach "Husky" Hunt reduced the
possible, most of these men will be
squad to nineteen men yesterday. If
given an opportunity to play tonight,
and from the showing made the squad
will be cut to fifteen men.
Those who survived the cut are:
Anderson, Blazier, Clark, David, Dun
fee, Hoffman, Holeman, Jayred, Jo
seph, McCormick, NewhousÂ«, Post,
Price, Riese, Shipkey, Southworth,
Taylor, Walker, and Williams.
Babes Confident
Little is known of the strength of
the Santa Clara yearlings. The fresh
men are not worried but are confident
of emerging from the game on the
long end of the score. The Babes have
already defeated teams generally con

sidered to be stronger than the Santa
Clara quintet.
The yearlings had an off night last
Saturday when they barely defeated
the Oakland Tech team by a 10 to 7
score. The guarding was good in this
contest, but the forwards weren't able
to get a very good percentage of
their shots.
Even at that, the team was entitled
an off night because it had played
such good ball in the first two games.
If the men get going tonight the way
they did in the first two encounters
there will be no doubt but that the
Forwards Fast
score will be top heavy for the Babes.
David and Price are working well
together at the forward positions.
They seem to have these jobs cinched.
Riese has been playing good ball and
will not weaken the team in the least
if he gets in.
Jayred and Anderson are having a
hard fight at center; Both of them
did well against Oakland. It is a toss
up which one will start, but the ad
vantage is with Jayred, as he has
played the most to date. Anderson
was late in starting practice but is
rapidly improving. He is heavier than
Jayred, but has not been so lucky in
the scoring department so far.
Newhouse Plays Well
Shipkey and Newhouse have the
edge at the guard positions. New
house played his best game Saturday.
He got the ball from the back board
every time the Oakland men missed
a shot, and passed to a Babe player.
It was largely through his work that
the Oakland team scored but two bas
kets.
Shipkey was removed in the first
half Saturday for an excessive num
ber of personal fouls. Williams played
the rest of the game at running guard,
and looked almost as good as Shipkey.
Shipkey does not score much, but
his knowledge of the game makes him
a valuable man. Williams may get in
the game, but it is probable that Ship
key will start.
