"Be gorra and I thought he was
dead!" But Cliff Ireland stoutly denies
the assertion, claiming that while he
might be more dead than alive he is
still able to manage a ball club and
take a part in the proceedings. He
has scheduled a practice tilt with
Coach Wolter's varsity baseball team
to take place January 23 on the var
sity field.
Cliff Ireland's Independents have
been coming to Stanford to play base
ball for such a long time that only
the aged watchmen who have been
on the campus have any recollection
of the first contest.
The game on the twenty-third will
be the thirty-second year that Cliff
and his nine shamrocks, garnered
from the elite of the Coast and Win
ter leagues, will have participated
against a Stanford baseball team.
Cliff's aggregation of harps, hod
carriers and politicians, won a three
game series with the Cardinals last
year. The first game went to the Hi
bernians 3 to 2. The second game
lasted fourteen innings, the final score
in favor of the Irelands' 6 to 4. Stan
ford managed to nose ahead in the
third contest with a 12 to 8 victory.
Cliff is getting pretty old to play
the old national pastime, but without
him the game would be like chile con
carne in English. And although Cliff's
knees are as shaky as a Phi Bete
average, he declares his name will
be on the starting list if he has to
hire a couple of freshmen and a
stretcher to carry him out to home
plate. His two hits, unexpected to the
bleachers and himself, last year,
proved that old Father Time hasn't
robbed the ancient pilot of any of his
eye-sight.
