# TROPHY ROOM PLANS SENT TO ARCHITECTS
## Union Board Votes Approval Of Plan; Question of Finance Obstacle 
### 
Tentative plans for the building and
equipping of a new trophy room at
Stanford took on a more definite as
pect last night when the Union Board
approved a proposition calling for the
installation of the new room in the
main clubroom of the Old Union.
The original blueprints, which were
drawn up by Chauncey T. Keefer,
University engineer, have been taken
to Bakewell and Brown, the regular
University architects, who will submit
final plans for general approval.
Plans have been made in past years
to set aside one trophy room in which
all kinds of prizes, pictures, and ban
ners could be kept together. But until
the matter was taken up by students
and alumni a month ago, nothing defi
nite had been decided.
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, is in charge of gathering to
gether everything that will go in the
trophy cases.
The only question confronting the
workers who are active on the plan
is one of finance. Several organiza
tions have already agreed to donate
definite sums, while the remainder
will have to be subscribed by the
student body and alumni.
Circle "S" Society has agreed to
donate $150, "Nip" McHose will pre
sent the proposition to the Senior
Class, and this organization is ex
pected to give something toward the
plan.
The Union Club considers subscrib
ing at least $300, and the Student
Body, through the executive commit
tee, has approved of the plan. Skull
and Snakes, Quadrangle Club, and the
Board of Athletic Control, are in favor
of giving definite sums to aid the
proposition.
