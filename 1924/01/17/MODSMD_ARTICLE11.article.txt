# Bok Peace Plan Is Subject Of Talk By Dr. Jordan Tonight
## 
### 
The Bok Prize Peace Plan will be
the subject of a talk by Dr. Jordan
at the new home, Serra house, to
night at 7:30. Dr. Jordan will explain
the conditions under which Edward
Bok first decided to offer the prize,
together with a summary of the plan
and the probable outcome if it is
adopted.
Dr. Jordan says of the plan: "It
does not call for a well-armed agency
to wallop the nation that makes war,
but for a place to talk things over in
a friendly way, and an opportunity to
develop a world opinion.
"War will go on until we learn t<s
abominate it, and refuse to have any
thing to do with it. As we know it
today, war is no longer based on a
competition of arms and individual
contact and bravery. It is a struggle
to the death with poison gases and
every form of brutality known to man.
"Civilization must put an end to
war or else it will wipe out civiliza
tion. We have now come to the final
crisis. Shall our civilization endure
or must we call In the masses of Asia
and Africa to take our place?"
Jordan heartily endorses the new
plan. He feels that it represents a
new and better league of nations,
divested of all the objectionable fea
tures of the present league.
