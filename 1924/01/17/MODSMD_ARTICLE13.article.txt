# ANDERSON MAKES FIVE BASKETS AS BABES DEFEAT MISSIONITES
## YEARLINGS LEAD BY 2-2 SCORE AT END OF HALF Substitutions Slow Down Scoring Machine, But Santa Clara Is Unable To Take Lead 
### Wallace Knox 
The freshmen played better than ever last night and easily defeated the
! Santa Clara freshmen in a one-sided game by the score of 22 to 9.
The Babes took the lead at the start and piled up 20 points at the end of
the first half, while allowing the Missionites but 2.
Anderson was the star of the game for the freshmen. He was everywhere
and made 12 of the 20 points during the first half. His passing was good, and
his shooting almost perfect. He made five baskets out of eight attempts
during the first half, and none of them were easy shots . Three were long
j shots and two were follows.
Price Scores Three Times
Price got away for three goals during the first half. He played the floor
! well, and also did some good work on the defense. The strength of the
Stanford defense was proved when the yearlings did not allow the Mission

>players to make a goal until towards
the middle of the third quarter.
Wallace scored two points from the
foul line for the Santa Clara year
lings at the start of the game, but
from then until the end of the half
none of the Friars got near enough
to score.
Price and Anderson alternated in
the scoring. First one and then the
other of the Long Beach stars got an
opening and usually made his shot
good. David had a little trouble with
his shots and failed to put any o£
them through the ring.
The team took things easy during
the thii'd quarter, making but one
point.
Wallace, the clever Santa Clara for
ward, dribbled half the length of the
floor and scored. He was charged by
Riese and made his try good. The
score at the end of this quarter stood
21 to 5 for the Babes.
Many Substitutions
During the final period, Coach
"Husky" Hunt made frequent substi
tutions. Practically every member of
the squad got in for several minutes.
Joseph, who was playing at stand
ing guard, scored once from the foul
line. Devine made three points for
Santa Clara and Casanova caged a
foul shot before the end of the game.
The final score was 22 to 9.
