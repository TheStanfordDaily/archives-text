# HUGO'S BREADTH OF VISION PICTURED IN DRAMA 'MILESTONES'
## Masquers' Play Is Season's Hit When Presented in London, America 
### 
Arnold Bennett and Edward Knob-1
lock, the authors of "Milestones," have
pictured in drama what Victor Hugo
had years before accomplished in fic-1
tion. This is the opinion New York
reviewers held when they first were
treated to the season's hit.
London critics said of the play that
"although family history repeats itself
in the three acts we are never bored
for a moment." In depicting the three
ages of history and the progress of a
family through them, "Milestones" re
veals with exquisite irony how the
progressives of today are the conserva
tives of tomorrow, and although fash
ions may change, human nature ever
I
remains the same.
In choosing "Milestones" for their
1924 dramatic production, Masquers
Society picked a play that was the
rage of London for the whole season
in which it was staged. Then, after its
big run there, it was brought to
America, opening simultaneously at
New York and Chicago under the
management of Klaw and Erlanger.
It takes a weight of 4500 pounds to
crush a cubic inch of the best brick.
