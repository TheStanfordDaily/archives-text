# PAVLOWA FINDS AMERICAN PEOPLE GROWING APPRECIATIVE OF BALLET
## Russian Dancer Thinks We Need More Schools Of Dancing To Develop Artists And Educate Public 
### Beatrice Flesher 
"I find American audiences better
able to appreciate the ballet than ten
! years ago when I first came to Amer
ica," said Mme. Anna Pavlowa, the
famous Russian dancer now appearing
with her company of artists at the
Curran Theater in San Francisco.
"Since that time," continued Mme.
Pavlowa, "the Americans have had
more opportunity to judge dancing,
and to understand it better. Especially
since the war do I find this change
i noticeable in audiences over here.
"The critics used to complain that
the ballets were very beautiful, but
! that they did not understand them.
America Needs Ballet School
The dancer explained the reason
why the public here had had little op
portunity to witness many balleP per
formances, except the few times when
artists came over from Europe. "There
is no school of dancing in America
which compares with the Russian Im
perial School, and that is why only a
few famous dancers have come from
this country. It is important to have,
a good school where every ono may
briirg his child to learn correctly.
"Sometimes the child's dancing is
spoiled if he starts too young, at the
age of four or five, and is not properly
taught, for at that time his bones are
still tender and are shaped according
to the way in which he dances.
"It is different in Russia," she said,
"where we have the traditions of an
imperial ballet school which was es

| tablished 200 years ago. These schools,
j in the time of the czars, were at
Petrograd, and at Moscow, and each
j contained about 200 members, whose
I ranks were renewed yearly with from
; fifteen to twenty new dancers.
"Ballet performances were given the
year round in these two cities, and
sometimes a few artists left to per
form elsewhere. The whole company
never had the opportunity to leave
! Russia."
Mme. Pavlowa told of the incon
veniences of training which a dancer
must undergo. She said that the work
is hard, the art difficult, for one never
attains perfection. The dancer must
keep a strict diet, cannot eat before
performances, and must spend time to
j get the muscles in condition and under
' control before dancing.
Likes Interpretive Dancing
When asked what kind of dancing
she preferred, Mme. Pavlowa quickly
replied that< she, liked interpretive
work, when she could throw her whole
being into the spirit of the dance. She
mentioned the "Swan Dance" and
"California Poppy" among her favo
rites, and added that she loved to
dance when feeling was necessary for
the interpretation.
Many of the women and most of the
nwn in Mme. Pavlowa's ballet are
Russian. Some of the women are Eng
lish girls whom Mme. Pavlowa trained
from the age of eleven in her school
which she formerly conducted in Lon
