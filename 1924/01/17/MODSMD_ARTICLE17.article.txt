						MERE MATTER OF POLICY
## 
### 
When the dining halls back of Branner are completed, plans are
ready to install a store in one of the Encina dining rooms for the benefit
of the students in the three dormitories. The Branner hall dining rooms
will not be open until October 1, 1924.
It is the policy of the Union Board of Governors, as voiced by its
Executive Committee, to make the Union store accommodate all students
on the campus. The money raised from this store will go to benefit all
students bv lifting the debt now incurred to the Board of Trustees on
the Union furniture.
The Union Board believes its store will serve the whole campus, for
the time being. It does not want to start a temporary store in any of the
dormitories, for fear that this store, being by its nature temporary
until the new dining halls will throw open one of the Encina dining
halls for store purposes, will cause rage because of its temporary and
probably insufficient accommodations. Because of this fear the students
must wait two quarters for service closer than the Union.
Meanwhile the money which the Union Board might have from a
store in Encina or Toyon is wasted in rage. The men in the Union are
working under the handicap of serving people who are resentful because
they are forced to buy at the Union whether they will or no.
So be it.
