# "WE WILL NOW HEAR THE STUDENTS"
## 
### 
Students on boards composed of alumni, faculty, and undergrad
uates in proportionate representation are now talking about a radical
change in tbe attitude of the older members of their different bodies.
Formerly the student members on such boards, while figuratively
given full voice and vote, were treated as tryoutees who should be taught
gradually the inner workings and brought along carefully in the hope
that before they graduated they would be sufficiently intelligent to take
a real part in the proceedings.
That was the situation not so many years ago. Now something
has happened. The faculty and alumni members, apparently realizing
that the undergraduate members, representing a large body which, aside
from its present status, would very shortly be in a position to com
mand considerable respect as alumni, and further realizing that these
student representatives were talking and voting as they saw student
opinion, have changed their policy. Student members on such boards
are now not only accorded equal voice in important decisions, but their
opinions are respected as representing the student body.
The Daily Palo Alto is heartily in favor of the tryoutee system, but
cannot see its advantages in the consideration of elected representatives.
The change which has come about in the attitude of the majority is an
assurance that the minority now has the rights usually accorded in such
bodies.
San Francisco papers printed a wild conjecture this morning rela
tive to Center's offering "Tiny" Thornhill the position of head coach.
Regardless of whether it is true or not, and still further regardless of
"Tiny's" announced intention to stay on the Farm, as expressed by his
signature on a three-year contract, Stanford should feel flattered that
another college is again making a futile attempt to secure one of the
Cardinal coaches.
