# WOMEN MAY COMPETE IN INTERCOLLEGIATE SWIMMING MATCHES
## 
### 
Stanford women may compete in in
tercollegiate swimming matches dur
ing the spring quarter. The Women's
Athletic Association Board last night
discussed plans, and the matter will
be taken up at the triangle conference
of Mills, California, and Stanford, in
San Francisco Saturday.
Plans to have all four class teams
in hockey and in basketball play on
a single date with Mills and another
single date with California were dis
cussed by the board. If approved, this
will mean that there will be only two
dates for intercollegiate competition
in each sport, once in a four-game
series with California, and once with
Mills.
The Board advised that outside
games be followed by the 'interclass
series as they did this year, and that
extra practices be held before the
intercollegiate games, with perhaps an
early closing of the hocltey season in
December.
Credit towards a Block "S" will now
be given for hikes of five miles or
over with a maximum of thirty credits
a quarter and a minimum of ten cred
its a quarter in place of the twenty
formerly required, according to a re
vision jn the point rules of the W.
A. A.

William Henry Harrison was the
oldest man ever chosen for the presi
dency of the United States. He was
68 at the time of his inauguration in
1841.
