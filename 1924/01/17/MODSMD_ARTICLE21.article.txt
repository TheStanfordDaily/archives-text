NOTHING TO READ
"Nearly 10,000 American merchant seamen have nothing to read." —Daily
Palo Alto.
In the days when the Pinafore scoured the blue,
To while away the nasty journey,
The captain read to his knitting crew
The works of Mrs. Fannie Burney.
Dick Deadeye would sit on a coil of rope *
And read in a voice that all could follow,
From the bos'n tight to the midshipmite,
Of the hopes and fears of Little Rollo.
Alas for the joys of those fond days!
For now our bluff forecastle hand
No more can learn, in rapt amaze,
What Alice did in Wonderland.
MacMillan's' not for such as he,
Bobbs-Merill also is denied him;
No volumes free his drudgery
He has no books to read beside him.
!
From bilge to heaving pinnacles
From dawn to dusk he daily races
To scuttle all the binnacles
Or batten down the trouser-braces;
To holystone the whiffletree,
Or grog the scupper hatches for'ard,
Or maybe cast the starboard mast
To port, or something just as horrid.

How can our tarry salts advance
When dumb as any cavern-dwellers?
Their minds are drowned in ignorance
They do not know the six best sellers.
Poseidon, hearken to our plea
And raise, for Jack's alleviation,
Some Carnegie from out the sea
To save our salts from deep darnation! —G. D.
