# Advertising Club Will Hear Franklin Discussed
## 
### 
'Benjamin Franklin and Advertis
ing" will be Professor Buford O.
Brown's topic this evening before the
Stanford Advertising Club of Palo
Alto.
Since today is the one hundred and
eighteenth anniversary of Franklin's
birthday, college advertising clubs
throughout the country will listen to
talks on some angle of the famous
publisher's life in celebrating the oc
casion. Professor Brown, as a mem
ber of the Stanford journalism faculty,
is in a good position to discuss the
advertising policy of the founder of
"Poor Richard's Almanac."
The club will meet promptly at 6
o'clock in the Russell Cafeteria in
Palo Alto.

California can now boast of a pre
historic race of mound builders exist
ing some 3,000 years ago through dis
coveries in the lake of the
southern San Joequin Valley reported
by University of California scientists
in anthropology. Excavations were
made in and near Tulare, Goose,
Buena Vista, and Kern Lakes.
