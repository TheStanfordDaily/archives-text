## Jack Takes the Count—in 1891 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Don't be alarmed, Jack, this isn't a peep into the future, forecasting your
knockout by that young heavyweight and sparring partner of Firpo's, Bob
Fitzsimmons' son and namesake. You've just gotten hold of a thirty-three
year old paper telling about Ruby Robert's defeat of the great fighter whose
name you carry.
Jack Dempsey, "The Nonpareil," was recognized king of the lightweights in
1884. He advanced into the welterweight and middleweight classes, and in
1884 won the middleweight title by defeating George Fulljames in twenty-two
rounds. He also beat Jack Fogarty, George La Blanche, and Johnny Reagan,
fighting in forty-six fights (over 2SO rounds) in his first four years as middle
weight champion. Compare this to the modern Jack Dempsey's four-year
record as champion—six fights with a total of thirty-nine rounds.
In 1889 Georgfe La Blanche defeated Jack Dempsey in thirty-two rounds by
using the foul pivot blow which was afterwards barred. Dempsey was again
recognized as middleweight champion, and in 1891 he mets Fitzsimmons in
the aforementioned battle. He made his last public appearance at a benefit
in New York in June, 1895, and died later on at Portland, Oregon.
Come on, Jack, let's see you fight more than two fights each year; we don't
care how short you make 'em!
