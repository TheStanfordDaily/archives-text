Delta Tau-Encina Match Close
i
Displaying a good offensive, Delta
! Tau Delta beat Encina, fifth floor, 8
| to 6, in a fast and close contest. The
hall men put up a defense that was
hard to pierce and continually broke
up Delta Tau plays. They were un
able to score frequently, however, and
a fair offensive by the Delts enabled
them to score four points to a similar
number by the Encina five.
The second period was even more
close, the ball often changing hands,
but neither team could take advantage
of chances to score. The half ended
6 to 6, necessitating an extra five
minute period.
Play in the extra five minutes was
fast and even, neither five being able
to toss in the deciding goal. Ten sec
onds before the whistle, however, Col
gan won the game for Delta Tau Delta
by a spectacular shot through the bas
ket from the center line.
Colgan, Meyer, and James accounted
for the Delta Tau scores while Han
ley, George, and Sproul played a good
game for the Encina five.

ball being played up and down the
floor continually. The teamwork dis
played was not backed up by any
scoring accuracy, however, and the
first half ended 3 to 0 with Encina in
the lead.
Hoop Hard to Find
Desperate attempts to score were
made by both fives in the second
period but many misses the result.

the basket for three field goal.* de

up many of his opponents' plays, while
Meeks played a fast game at forward.
For Zeta Psi, Solomon, Oatman, and
Johnson made a last combination on
offense.

superior teamwork of the former car
ried the ball time after time into
Kappa Sig territory but could not
not score proportionately. Long shots
were frequent by the El Campo play
ers and the half ended 10 to 2.
Kappa Sigma slowed the pace a
little the second period and was able
to score only four additional points,

however. Smith was responsible for
the only score credited to El Campo in
the second half and the game ended
14 to 4 with Kappa Sigma on the
large end of the count.

ing in teamwork and kept the ball
in its own territory for most of the
period. At half time the count stood
14 to 4 with Sigma Alpha Epsilon
leading.
