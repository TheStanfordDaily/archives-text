# People Can Say What They Please, But the Glee Club Likes Its Shirts Boiled
## 
### 
Twenty-six men will appear in
classes tomorrow morning in hard
boiled shirts, wing collars, and white
bow ties. The remainder of their cos
tumes will be more soiled.
These men are the Glee Club neo
phytes who must go through the initi
ation ritual laid down by the veterans
of the organization.
After disporting themselves until
the hour of twelve, noon, the new men
will rest in preparation for the more
strenuous exercises of the evening at
the Glee Club banquet. At this time
the more impressive rites of member
ship will be performed, and the club
officers will risp to the occasion with
speeches.
Paddles . . . but enough. We have
been sworn to secrecy. We must not
even mention Warren D. Allen's an
nual joke.
