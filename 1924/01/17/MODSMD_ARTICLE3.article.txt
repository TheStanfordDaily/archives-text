# Chappie Editorial On Clean Humor Is Praised By Comic
## 
### 
Chappie's valiant battle for humor
that has at least one clean meaning
has received recognition.
Back East, in the editorial offices
of the "Pennsylvania Punch Bowl,"
ranking with the "Columbia Jester"
as one of the country's leading comics,
certain of the editorial gentry gazed
with approval on a Chaparral editorial,
• and this was the result —as copied
from the editorial page of the "Punch
j Bowl" for January:
"Once in a while we see something
; so terse and pithy and altogether to
the point that we can't repress the
desire to reproduce it for our readers.
The editorial below was lifted from
the December "Chaparral." We re
print it for what it is worth."
They Liked It
And then follows the Chappie edi
torial which they liked —
"Is this a college comic? Yes, mis
i ter, we think so. Then where is the
smut? Sir, we are as shy of smut as
we are of shaggy dogs. Well, then,
young fellow, how do you expect to
live up to the reputation of all college
comics for being just a bit spicier
than should be? Mister, we don't. You
mean to say you put out an anti-smut
; publication and get any response from
your student body? Yes, kind sir,
that's just what we mean to do. And,
furthermore, we've been doing it for
going on twenty-five years now.
Don't Believe in Ghosts
"Ever so often we slip a cog and
something sneaks by, and we're genu
inely sorry for it. But we're not sorry
because there's a big, black Faculty
bugaboo telling us to, because we
have the hearty co-operation of the
Faculty.
"They realize, as do Chappie's read
ers, that the epithet of "rich-rare
racy-risque" fastened on college com
ic as a class is pure hooey, and that
neither Chaparral nor any other Ham
mer and Coffin publication, nor any
of the other colleger comics whom we
like to consider as our best friends,
are what they're cracked up to be
when it comes to smut."

inely sorry for it. But we're not sorry
because there's a big, black Faculty
bugaboo telling us to, because we
have the hearty co-operation of the
Faculty.
"They realize, as do Chappie's read
ers, that the epithet of "rich-rare
racy-risque" fastened on college com
ic as a class is pure hooey, and that
neither Chaparral nor any other Ham
mer and Coffin publication, nor any
of the other colleger comics whom we
like to consider as our best friends,
are what they're cracked up to be
when it comes to smut."
Chappie's valiant battle for humor
that has at least one clean meaning
has received recognition.
Back East, in the editorial offices
of the "Pennsylvania Punch Bowl,"
ranking with the "Columbia Jester"
as one of the country's leading comics,
certain of the editorial gentry gazed
with approval on a Chaparral editorial,
• and this was the result —as copied
from the editorial page of the "Punch
j Bowl" for January:
"Once in a while we see something
; so terse and pithy and altogether to
the point that we can't repress the
desire to reproduce it for our readers.
The editorial below was lifted from
the December "Chaparral." We re
print it for what it is worth."
They Liked It
And then follows the Chappie edi
torial which they liked —
"Is this a college comic? Yes, mis
i ter, we think so. Then where is the
smut? Sir, we are as shy of smut as
we are of shaggy dogs. Well, then,
young fellow, how do you expect to
live up to the reputation of all college
comics for being just a bit spicier
than should be? Mister, we don't. You
mean to say you put out an anti-smut
; publication and get any response from
your student body? Yes, kind sir,
that's just what we mean to do. And,
furthermore, we've been doing it for
going on twenty-five years now.
Don't Believe in Ghosts
"Ever so often we slip a cog and
something sneaks by, and we're genu
inely sorry for it. But we're not sorry
