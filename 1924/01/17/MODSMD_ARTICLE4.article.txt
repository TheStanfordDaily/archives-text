# STUART RECOMMENDS BOK PEACE PROGRAM
## Good Features of League of Nations Utilized; Bad Are Eliminated 
### 
"The Bok Peace Plan utilizes all
the good features of the League of
Nations and eliminates all of the
bad," declared Professor Graham
Stuart in the discussion held last
night in the Little Theater concern
ing the Bok Peace Plan which will be
voted upon by the University in a
short time.
Discussing the advantages of the
plan, Professor Stuart believes the
League of Nations seems to be the
only possible solution for obtaining
peace because it does furnish mach
inery whereby nations can get to
gether and thrash out their differ
ences and also furnishes a court
whereby difficulties can be settled in
the judicial fashion.
Students Favor Plan
In the general discussion which fol
lowed by the students a great major
ity of them seenvecl to be favorably
disposed to the plan. Some opposed it
on the ground that it would lead us
into the League of Nations, but the
j concensus of opinion seemed to be
I that, even so, the advantages were all
j on the side of the United States. Pro
fessor Stuart remarked on the fact
j that the questions asked by the stu
j dents showed that they had a real
| knowledge of the situation.
One objection raised was that the
League of Nations was a league of
allies. Professor Stuart pointed out
that this was untrue because Bulgaria,
I Austria and other enemy states have
been admitted to the League. Answer
i ing the objection that the council was
! entirely dominated by the big powers,
Professor Stuart stated that in the
last assembly two more small powers
were added, making the ratio now in
the council six small powers to four
large powers.
U. S. Need Not Use Force
"The particular advantage of the
plan is that it entirely eliminates the
use of force as far as the United
j States is concerned in doing away
, with Articles X andXVI. In fact, if
the United States should join the
League under the resolutions proposed
by this plan we would be merely fol
lowing out our traditional policy of
settling our disputes by arbitration
rather than war," concluded Profes
sor Stuart.

Elihu Root recently underwent an
operation for removal of a kidney
stone in New York. He will not be
able to leave the hospital for three or
four weeks. Root is 79 and has held
the position of Secretary of State.

whereby difficulties can be settled in
the judicial fashion.
Students Favor Plan
In the general discussion which fol
lowed by the students a great major
ity of them seenvecl to be favorably
disposed to the plan. Some opposed it
on the ground that it would lead us
into the League of Nations, but the
j concensus of opinion seemed to be
I that, even so, the advantages were all
j on the side of the United States. Pro
fessor Stuart remarked on the fact
j that the questions asked by the stu
j dents showed that they had a real
| knowledge of the situation.
One objection raised was that the
League of Nations was a league of
allies. Professor Stuart pointed out
that this was untrue because Bulgaria,
I Austria and other enemy states have
been admitted to the League. Answer
i ing the objection that the council was
! entirely dominated by the big powers,
Professor Stuart stated that in the
last assembly two more small powers
were added, making the ratio now in
the council six small powers to four
large powers.
U. S. Need Not Use Force
"The particular advantage of the
plan is that it entirely eliminates the
use of force as far as the United
j States is concerned in doing away
, with Articles X andXVI. In fact, if
the United States should join the
League under the resolutions proposed
by this plan we would be merely fol
lowing out our traditional policy of
settling our disputes by arbitration
rather than war," concluded Profes
sor Stuart.

Elihu Root recently underwent an
operation for removal of a kidney

"The Bok Peace Plan utilizes all
the good features of the League of
Nations and eliminates all of the
bad," declared Professor Graham
Stuart in the discussion held last
night in the Little Theater concern
ing the Bok Peace Plan which will be
voted upon by the University in a
short time.
Discussing the advantages of the
plan, Professor Stuart believes the
League of Nations seems to be the
only possible solution for obtaining
peace because it does furnish mach
inery whereby nations can get to
gether and thrash out their differ
ences and also furnishes a court
whereby difficulties can be settled in
the judicial fashion.
