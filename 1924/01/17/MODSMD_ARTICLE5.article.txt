# JUVENILE INTELLECTUAL PRODIGY NOW MENTALLY UNSTABLE-TERMAN
## William J. Sidis, Lecturer to Harvard Professors When Ten Years Old, Discussed By Psychologist 
### 
"William J. Sidis, who. at the age
•of ten. lectured to Harvard professors
on the fourth dimension, is now un
doubtedly psychopathic—that is men
tally unstable." This is the diagnosis
made by Professor L. M. Terman,
head of the Stanford Psychology de
partment, in the case of this "juvenile
intellectual prodigy" and "wonder
boy" of a decade ago, who has just
been found eking out a meagre, exist- j
jence as a statistical clerk in New i
York at $23 a week. J
Sidis at the age of ten was greeted j
as a mathematical and linguistic:
genius, and was set up to deliver lec
tures to distinguished professors as;
the "wonder of the age." He was ad
mitted to Harvard and graduated at
the ago of lfi. After two years' post
graduate work, he became a teacher
of mathematics in Rice Institute,
Texas.
A Misfit in Society
In 1919 he was arrested on the
charge of rioting connected with so
cialistic tendencies, and was sent to
the House of Correction for two years.
Now. at the age of 25, he seems a
hopeless misfit in society, and friends
have found it difficult to find any oc
cupation where he can be a success.'
"Probably due to his early training,
his exploitation and advertisement as
a genius, Sidis is in a condition of j
mental instability bordering on in- 1
sanity," says Professor Terman. "He!
was allowed to grow up lacking in all)

the normal social experiences, which
are so essential in the early years of
the child. As a result he can not get
along with other people or adjust him
self to conditions. He does eccentric,
impossible things, and, because he
does not fit in with the rest of society,
harbors a mania of persecution.
Father a Psychologist
"His father received his M.D. and
Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard. He
ran a hospital for the treatment of
nervous and mental diseases and
wrote several books on psychological
subjects. Most of his works have been
discredited by recognized psycholo
gists, because, though strong on
theory, he lacked the faculty or the
inclination to back up his surmises
with scientific experiment and fact.
"He came to the United States from
Russia at the age of twenty with no
knowledge of the English language.
He always found great difficulty in
making his social contacts and adapta
tions.
"The newspapers and the public in
general seem to be finding several of
their theories about 'child wonders'
! proved true by this case," said Pro
| feasor Terman. "I would like to ex
plain that geniuses do not become in
sane or mentally unstable any oftener
than the general run of population.
We have found from our studies of
I 1,000 'gifted children' that on the aver
age these children have better ability
for leadership, social adaptability, and
common sense than is found in the
same number of children not so gifted
mentally.
No Original Discoveries
"Sidis was no more mentally gifted
as a child —no more a genius than
Francis Galton or Goethe or any other
of the world's great men. His gifts
were distinctly narrow and one-sided,
pertaining only to mathematics and
language. He was not a remarkable
genius, but was only able to master
subjects of a certain type a little
faster than the average. He made no
great or original mathematical dis
coveries, and became known as a
genius only through his father's ex
ploitation and advertisement of him."
