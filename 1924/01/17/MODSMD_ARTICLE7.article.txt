# PERSONAL INTEGRITY, GOOD ASSOCIATES VITAL IN BANKING
## 
### 
The ideal banker must possess in
tegrity, care as to associates, good
health, and ability to make decisions
and to carry responsibility.
This is the formula given by Charles
J. Crary, '03, in his lecture yesterday
on choosing banking as a profession.
Crary divided the banking business
into three fields, mechanical, clerical,
and official.
"You often find your work by acci
dent. Get good experience if choice
has to be made between that and a
good salary, and the best thing that
can happen to you is to get a low
salary, a hard job, and a harder boss
â€”but you won't like it."
Man of 30 Should Get Results
Up to thirty years of age experience
should come first. After that it is
results that count, according to Crary.
"Learn the territory right around
you, the job of the man above and
below. You may hurt yourself by not
having a man ready to step into your
place when a chance for your advance
ment comes."
Assets and liabilities should be
weighed. It is important for a man not
to fool himself, even if he does fool
the boss. If he fails to get along then
he has not "sold himself 'to his job.
"Don't be afraid of responsibility,
or of decisions," was Crary's advice.
"The man who is carrying on his own
business is usually stronger than even
a big man in a larger corporation.
Borrowing money is all right as a
business proposition, for you have to
work with people, and not against
them.
