# JUNIOR-SENIOR TEAMS TO START INTERCLASS POLO CONTEST FRIDAY
## 
### 
Final practice takes place this af
ternoon in preparation for the first
interclass polo game which will be
played tomorrow between the junior
mallet, swingers and the senior four.
It was announced that the freshman
sophomore team would play the open
ing game of the interclass schedule,
but Captain Charles E. Boyle, polo
coach, found it necessary to change
the schedule.
The senior quartet is given the edge
in the first game. Three players, Otto
Barby, Ralph Biirbv, and Ed Laub,
who were on the varsity lineup during
the autumn quarter, are included
among those eligible to play with the
fourth year men. John Irwin will play
on the junior team.
The interclass games will be played
on the highway field each afternoon
at 3 o'clock.
