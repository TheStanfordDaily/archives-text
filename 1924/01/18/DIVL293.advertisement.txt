These are Wise Words
And they quite* hit the nail on the head, but ivc feel
that Mr. Webster would have risen to even greater
heights of verbal splendor if he could have pictured the
new spring arrivals at the Livingston Shop. They are
coming in every day, saucy little hats, in the brightest
colors, frocks, and frocks of knitted silk, of knitted
wool, for dress or sport, and the blouses so dear to the
college girl's heart are here in a profusion of delightful
models.
Come to the Livingston Shop, and catch the first
breath of Spring, and you can easily do that without
fear of financial ruin, as is always the case with Livings
ton merchandise.
