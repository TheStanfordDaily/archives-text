# MAY OF DIAMOND STARS INCLUDED ON IRELAND NINE
## Cliff Assures Card Baseball Team Stiff Competition Next Wednesday 
### 
"You can be assured of my bringing
a list of players that are mostly well on
their way to big league fame," claims
Cliff Ireland in a letter to "Cy" Sy
inonds, varsity baseball manager, an
nouncing the list of players which will
play the Card nine next Wednesday.
And coming as it does from Cliff
(himself) there is nothing to "doubt,
even if Cliff in bis off hours is an im
porters' broker for rice, seeds, peas,
peanuts, cream of tartar, currants, and
mustard flour.
Bert Ellison to Play.
Ireland's list of players is enough to
startle a fifty-year member of the Old
Ladies' Home. Gazing down the list
appear such names as Bert Ellison, star
first baseman for the San Francisco
coast leaguers; Art Black, a catcher
from the Southern league; Fred Kelly,
brother to the famous George Kelly,
home run clouter for the Giants;
George Rippy, a pitcher, with a pedi
gree as long as the League of Nations
dispute; Barney Kearns, a Salt Lake
infielder, AND last but not least, Cliff
Ireland (himself).
Harry Wolter doesn't absolutely
promise to take Cliff's aggregation of
Finian shamrock blossoms into camp.
This will be the first scheduled game
for the varsity, and naturally the squad
is not lip to top form.
Card Lineup Indefinite.
Wolters' choice of players is not defi
nite to date. It will be a hard job to
pick the catcher from two such players
as Dick Lawson and "Pat" Patterson.
Both men are just about on a par as
far as fielding ability goes, and in the
batting department neither has a de
cided advantage.
Pitchers who have been working out
consistently thus far arc: Solomon,
Teague, Loewenstein, Ditzler, and
Oviatt. Solomon and Teague have a
decided edge over the other candi
dates, and one of the two will no doubt
start the game against the Hibernians.
Good Iniielders, Outfielders.
There is a wealth of infield and out
field material. Playing first base are
"Chuck" Johnston, and "Bud" Wood
ward, both stars on the 1923 football
team. "Shorty" Roberts has an edge
over Draper and Lovelace at second
base, and Mulchay is favored at short
stop over A1 Lucas and Dave Brown,
although both of the latter seem to be
hitting the ball hard and fielding well.
Murray Cuddeback is being pushed for
the third base job by Bert Green and
Koba. Green played third for last
year's freshman nine. He is a hard
hitter and a good infielder.
Among the candidates for outfield
.are: Frank Fuller, a veteran from last
I year, "Lefty" May, and "Bus" Mc-
Candless, also veterans. "Bill" Trace
and "Barney" Dickey are also showing
! up well in the outer gardens.
