# JORDAN FAVORS BOK PLAN
## Tells Of Necessity For Reconstruction of Clauses In International Law 
### 
Dr. Jordan thoroughly endorsed the idea of a world court and the en
couragement of leagues of peace in his talk on the Bok Peace Plan last
evening at his home.
He said, "The more you talk things over, the better, even though some
are half-hearted, and some are dishonest."
He further advocated the necessity of the reconstruction of international
law, hy cutting out all that concerns war, for war preparations never brought

peace. Dr. Jordan told of a suggestion i
he had made to restore the assistant !
secretaryship of conciliation in the |
United States because there has been
no one in the government to stand for:
peace, and there have been many who;
represent war.
No Arms to Enforce Peace
Discussing the League of Nations 1
as advocated by the winner of the j
Bok Peace Plan, Dr. Jordan empha
sized the fact that there must bo no
arms to enforce peace—the League |
must be separate from treaties. "In :
order to be more than a mere league
of friends, it must make an attempt ;
to include all nations." He says that
it gives an opportunity for world opin
ion to enforce the league.
"Military terrorism is just an ex
ample paralleled to that of the sow-1
ing of the dragon's teeth In the old j
myth; it means more destruction, and
no results. The economic boycott sug-1

gested in the League of Nations for
enforcement of law is very bad for
final results, because of the unequal
strength of nations. Conciliation is
what the league should work for."
Education of Public
Dr. Jordan himself submitted a plan
for the Bok prize, and in comparing
his ideas with those of Ihe winning
paper of which he is in great favor,
he said that in addition to suggestions
concerning the League of Nations, his
plan embodied the establishment of
an office in our government to pro
vide for the education of the people
so that they may assist in maintaining
pnaco. Instruction of the adult popu
lation should be along lines necessary
for the understanding of the import
ance of peace; for the children, he
advocated learning that the United
States Is not the only nation on earth,
as is sometimes the idea given in a
sort of selfish patriotism.
Peace Possible After Armistice
In a review of war conditions, Dr.
Jordan told of the first plan advocated
in this country for world peace which
was gotten up by Hamilton Holt.
Holt's idea was to "enforce it." which
cannot be accomplished except by
public opinion and without force. Dr.
Jordan maintained. "After the signing
of the armistice, peace should have
been brought about by entire demobo
lization, feeding of the starving peo
ple, relieving of reparations, and with
out changing of boundary lines."

was gotten up by Hamilton Holt.
Holt's idea was to "enforce it." which
cannot be accomplished except by
public opinion and without force. Dr.
Jordan maintained. "After the signing
of the armistice, peace should have
been brought about by entire demobo
lization, feeding of the starving peo
ple, relieving of reparations, and with
out changing of boundary lines."
Dr. Jordan thoroughly endorsed the idea of a world court and the en
couragement of leagues of peace in his talk on the Bok Peace Plan last
evening at his home.
He said, "The more you talk things over, the better, even though some
are half-hearted, and some are dishonest."
He further advocated the necessity of the reconstruction of international
law, hy cutting out all that concerns war, for war preparations never brought

peace. Dr. Jordan told of a suggestion i
he had made to restore the assistant !
secretaryship of conciliation in the |
United States because there has been
no one in the government to stand for:
peace, and there have been many who;
represent war.
No Arms to Enforce Peace
Discussing the League of Nations 1
as advocated by the winner of the j
Bok Peace Plan, Dr. Jordan empha
sized the fact that there must bo no
arms to enforce peace—the League |
must be separate from treaties. "In :
order to be more than a mere league
of friends, it must make an attempt ;
to include all nations." He says that
it gives an opportunity for world opin
ion to enforce the league.
"Military terrorism is just an ex
ample paralleled to that of the sow-1
ing of the dragon's teeth In the old j
myth; it means more destruction, and
no results. The economic boycott sug-1

gested in the League of Nations for
enforcement of law is very bad for
final results, because of the unequal
strength of nations. Conciliation is
what the league should work for."
Education of Public
Dr. Jordan himself submitted a plan
for the Bok prize, and in comparing
his ideas with those of Ihe winning
paper of which he is in great favor,
he said that in addition to suggestions
concerning the League of Nations, his
plan embodied the establishment of
an office in our government to pro
vide for the education of the people
so that they may assist in maintaining
pnaco. Instruction of the adult popu
lation should be along lines necessary
for the understanding of the import
ance of peace; for the children, he
advocated learning that the United
States Is not the only nation on earth,
as is sometimes the idea given in a
sort of selfish patriotism.
Peace Possible After Armistice
In a review of war conditions, Dr.
Jordan told of the first plan advocated
in this country for world peace which
