100 yard dash, 440 yard dash, 120 yard
high hurdles, two mile run, 880 yard
run, 220 yard dash, 220 yard low
hurdles, relay.
Only about half of the events will be
held this afternoon. The meet is to
give members of the track class some
competition and only a few of the var
sity men will he out.
Prospects Bright.
Prospects are bright for a winning
track team this year. "Dink" has cap
able men in every event, and California
will have a hard job to retain her track
laurels in the Big Meet in April.
"Swede" Leistner is improving daily.
Tcmpleton considers him one of the
best in the country now. By the Olym
pic games tryouts, "Dink" hopes to
have him capable of winning a place
on the team to represent the United
States, in the hurdles. With "Hal"
Boles as a running mate for Leistner,
Stanford has nothing to worry about
in either of the hurdle events.
A1 Smith is another Card trackster

He will run either the half or the mile
on the Stanford team. Tcmpleton is
pushing him for a candidate in the
1500 meter run at the Olympic tryouts.
Dole Working Out.
Norm Dole, who won the half mile in
the Big Meet last year, has been trot
ting around the track several times a
week. Dole, a dark horse in the Cali
fornia meet, came through in great
shape and won against a strong field.
Bill Swayne, who came second, was
another dark horse. He was not ex
pected to come anywhere near placing
but took the lead on the last turn, and
was only nosed out a little before the
tape was reached.
If these men show the improvement
that can rightfully be expected of them,
A1 Smith and Bill Richardson may have
a hard time maintaining their reputa
tion as the best half milers in the Uni
versity.

nents have been announced as yet.

Varsity to Go Easy.
Coach "Dink" Templeton has de
cided to let the varsity men take things
easy for a few weeks. Regular work
outs for the veterans will not start until
towards the middle of February.
At a recent meeting of the confer
ence, the following order of track
events at all meets was decided upon
for a period of three years: Mile* run,
100 yard dash, 440 yard dash, 120 yard
high hurdles, two mile run, 880 yard
run, 220 yard dash, 220 yard low
hurdles, relay.
Only about half of the events will be
held this afternoon. The meet is to
give members of the track class some
competition and only a few of the var
sity men will he out.
Prospects Bright.
Prospects are bright for a winning
track team this year. "Dink" has cap
able men in every event, and California
will have a hard job to retain her track
laurels in the Big Meet in April.
"Swede" Leistner is improving daily.
Tcmpleton considers him one of the
best in the country now. By the Olym
pic games tryouts, "Dink" hopes to
have him capable of winning a place
on the team to represent the United
States, in the hurdles. With "Hal"
Boles as a running mate for Leistner,
Stanford has nothing to worry about
in either of the hurdle events.
A1 Smith is another Card trackster
who is an Olympic games possibility.
He will run either the half or the mile
on the Stanford team. Tcmpleton is
pushing him for a candidate in the
1500 meter run at the Olympic tryouts.
Dole Working Out.
Norm Dole, who won the half mile in
the Big Meet last year, has been trot
ting around the track several times a
week. Dole, a dark horse in the Cali
fornia meet, came through in great
shape and won against a strong field.
Bill Swayne, who came second, was
another dark horse. He was not ex
pected to come anywhere near placing
but took the lead on the last turn, and
was only nosed out a little before the
tape was reached.
If these men show the improvement
that can rightfully be expected of them,
A1 Smith and Bill Richardson may have
a hard time maintaining their reputa
tion as the best half milers in the Uni
versity.
