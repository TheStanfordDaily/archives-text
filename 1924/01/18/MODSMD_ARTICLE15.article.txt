## Friars Have Well Balanced Squad In Offensive And Defensive Departments Of Game

Santa Clara will meet the Stanford varsity quintet in the pavilion tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock.
With the Cardinal five running smoothly after winning two early-season
games by overwhelming scores, Stanford has an edge over the Missionite
aggregation. Nevertheles, Coach Andy Kerr expects a hard game, since the
Friars continually pull the unexpected.
Missionites Boast Veterans
At least three veterans on the Santa Clara squad will be looking for red
revenge. Vukota, Toso, and Fawke, three of Coach Kienholz's mainstays,
have experienced three dousing defeats at the hands of former Stanford
teams.
Vukota, playing at forward for Santa Clara, is one of the best free throwers
in the game, and his dribbling antics are things to be watched. Two years
ago, Vukota came close to beating the Stanford team with his steady shooting.

Â»He is now a veteran on the squad with
! an additional year of experience. Sev
| eral experts have pronounced him one
of the best forwrads on the Coast.
Squad Well Balanced
While the Missionites boast a strong
offensive, they claim to have no mean
defenseive combination, and to prove
it, Keinholz is putting "Moose"
Fawke in the line-up at running guard,
and his teammate, Toso, at the other
guard position. Both of these men
have had experience against Stanford
teams and are out to give the Cardi
nal forwards a bit of real competition
in an effort to keep the score heavier
on the Santa Clara side of the score
board.
Maley is slated to play center for
the Friars and McKee will play the
other forward position opposite Vu
kota. McKee is a new man. Maley sub
stituted at guard for Santa Clara last
season.
Cards Look Stronger
The Cardinal team has been going
great guns in practice. In the last
week, it has improved over 20 per
cent on its showing Jn previous prac
tice workouts. Floor work, co-opera
tion on signals, handling of the ball,
dribbling, and team work in general
have come up so steadily that Andy
Kerr finds himself forced to state he
is well satisfied with the steady pro
gress the squad is making, and he
promises even a better outlook for the
future.
The substitutes especially have im
proved. Moody is getting to be a more
consistent shot, and has lost much of
his pre-season awkwardness in han
dling the ball. Mitchell is developing
| so fast that it may not be long before
he will be starring in the Card line-up.
Running guard seems to be the posi-
I tion best suited for Mitchell, although
he is fast and dodgy enough to war
rant breaking in as a forward. Steffan
has also lost most of his inaccuracy,
and is improving his style of play
rapidly.
