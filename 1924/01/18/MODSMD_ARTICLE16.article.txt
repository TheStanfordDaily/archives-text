# ECONOMIC LEAGUE VOTE IS IN FAVOR OF WORLD COURT
## 
### 
A vote of 10 to 1 in favor of the
United States' entrance into the World
Court is the result of a referendum on
the question made to members of the
National Council of the National Eco
nomic League, according to the an
nouncement received today by Presi
dent Wilbur, who is a member of the
council.
Recognition as leaders of public
opinion is the qualification for the
3500 members of the National Council
of the National Economic League, who
are directly nominated and elected
by preferential ballot from each state.
The vote is thus considered signifi
cant as an accurate reflection of pub
lic opinion.
The national vote was 1601 to 155
in favor of asking the United States
Senate to give its consent, on the
terms proposed by President Harding
on February 24, 1923, to adhesion by
the United States to the protocol of
the Permanent Court of International
Justice. In California, the vote was
63 to 7.
The returns from each state indicate
that public opinion on the subject is
practically the same in all parts of
the country. In Michigan, Idaho, North
Carolina, Rhode Island, and Oregon
the affirmative vote was unanimous.
The largest percentage of negative
votes came from New Mexico, whero
the voto was 15 "yes" and 9 "no."
