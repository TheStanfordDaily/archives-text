# TWO WEEKS AGO A YEAR FROM NOW

It is January 1, 1925. Old King Sport is making his annual review
of what took place in his realm during the preceding twelve months.
First he paused to consider eastern colleges and universities. From there
he passed to the south, the middle west, and finally to the Pacific Coast.
Coming across a brilliant red page in his great book, he chuckled
audibly.
"Stanford certainly came back," he said, "Last year was her greatest
in almost a decade, and it would have been a strange thing if she hadn't
come back.
"Now take Andy Kerr's basketball team. Who would have thought
a gang like that could have come through the way they did, with a five
man team. Still, that little fellow Kerr is a wonder and a great credit
to my kingdom. More power to him.
"Harry VVolter certainly put baseball back on its feet. 1 thought he
could do it, though. He certainly had a great gang of players from
which to build a team. Dink Templeton was finally rewarded, too, for
his hard work. His track team put a spectacular and well-deserved dent
in California. Tennis, too, had the best year since Phil Neer and Jimmy
Davies ceased competition.
"Of course, Maloney and Brandsten came through in minor sports.
They always do. Any college with a coaching staff which includes those
two men is fortunate.
" 'Pop' Warner, the old fox â€”lie hasn't forgotten any of his old
tricks. I knew that gang would beat the tar out of California in football.
Looks like the Golden Bear was going to have to like it a couple of years
longer, too." D. E. L.
