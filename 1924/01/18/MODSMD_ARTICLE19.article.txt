# WINGED COLLARS AND DIGNITY

### 
Resplendent in their boiled shirts and winged collars twenty-six newly
elected members to the glee club appeared on the Quad this morning. This
debut of the songsters brings forth comment on the club itself, and some
suggestions.
Many people expect a college glee club to put on a spicy musical vaude
ville in the traditional rah-rah style. A number of musical clubs of coast
colleges do give such a program. But under the direction of Warren D.
Allen, the Stanford Glee Club composed of about eighty-five men, has de
veloped into a high-class musical body capable of interpreting the works
of the masters. The songs selected are of the type used by the leading
clubs of the eastern colleges. The glee club is one of the few male choruses
in the west to appear in concert with such foremost musical organizations
as the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and with the Philharmonic
Orchestra of Los Angeles.
But while the glee clubs of California and U. S. C. take concert trips
to Chicago, New York, to China and Hawaii, the Stanford Glee Club
manages to conduct several short journeys down the state by the grace
of frenzied finance on the part of the individual members, and even has
to rent the Assembly hall for home concerts. It is to be hoped that when
the A. S. S. U. has available funds it will aid the glee club in taking more
extensive trips to represent the University.
Among eastern colleges glee clubs are given deserved support by the
students, home concerts and contests with the clubs of other colleges being
of frequent occurrence. Last year at the Hotel Pennsylvania in New
York the annual intercollegiate glee club contest was entered by musical
organizations from all over the east. This year the contest will be held in
Carnegie Hall about March 1.
Here are a few suggestions : that the glee club give home concerts more
frequently than has been its custom, thus offering a fair opportunity for
the student l>ody to learn to appreciate the club and support it; that efforts
l>e directed toward a glee club contest with California and other coast col
leges ; that an attempt l>e made to arrange an intercollegiate glee club con
test l)etween as many coast colleges as possible, the winner to be sent to the
annual eastern club competition in New York on March 1. R. E.
