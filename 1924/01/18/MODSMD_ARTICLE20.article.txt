# NEW MEMBERS OF THE STAFF
## 
### 
Six new names are to be seen under the heading "News Staff" higher
up in this column. After one week of try-outs, in which twenty-five stu
dents were "writing copy" under the supervision of staff officers, these
people were chosen as the six best suited to have places on the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto. They are: Bert Andrews, Alfred Post, Paul Wayte,
Marjorie Morehead, Rowena Mason and Don Hines.
To these new members will be entrusted some of the news gathering
and some of the work of putting out the paper each day. The committee
of selection feels that the work of the successful tryouts was of sufficient
quality to approach the standards of college journalism and to insure the
Daily Palo Alto of maintaining these same standards in the future when
the present new members of the staff arc given more responsible positions.
The six new reporters will meet in the Daily office tomorrow at 10 a. m.
for assignment of beats.
