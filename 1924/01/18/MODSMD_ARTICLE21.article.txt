COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS AS THEY OUGHT TO BE
or
Ways and Means of Outsmarting
Your Prof.
Ex's are staring us in the face again. We feel that something should be
done about it. Professors are beginning to take too many liberties with us
these days, and some of their questions show a low attempt to find out how
much we know. It's a doggoned injustice, and just to start things going, we
submit below our idea of how the ex's should be run.
