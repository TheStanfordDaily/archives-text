# RULES OF CONDUCT TO BE OBSERVED
## 
### 
1. In the first place, don't take the ex if you really don't want to, or can't
spare the time or something. The instructor doesn't want you to
anyway; you're only one more paper to correct.
2. If you decide to take the ex, above all, don't get there on time. Just drift
in any time and stay as long as you like. An informal atmosphere is
to be highly desired.
3. If you feel that your text book, notes, or outlines, etc., will be of any
assistance to you, why bring them along and don't hesitate to use them
freely. The instructor will admire your resourcefulness.
4. Don't hesitate to talk or converse freely with your neighbors. It is such
manifestations of social intercourse and communion that the University
wishes to foster.
5. Make your prof understand that the honor system is still an institution as
far as he's concerned. If he displays a tendency to hang around while
you're gathering data on your examination, why just sneak up on him
quietly and toss him out the window.
Those are merely general rules to be followed in all examinations. Below
follow some sample examinations which may well be given.
THE HISTORY EX
Question: What two nations participated in the Spanish-American War?
Now if you consider this question beside the point, or possibly a
little impertinent, just answer, "None of your business." Or, if
you'd rather, just make up a question of your own and answer it.
Anything will do for a history ex.
THE MATH EX
Question: How do you like math?
The answer to this is, of course, very simple. Just say, "It makes
me sick." The instructor will like that for it's simple, and un
affected straightforwardness.
THE LAW EX
Question: What is the method of treatment for prisoners in the county jail?
In the first place, you might answer him by saying, "Don't be so
fresh," or, if you shrink from such a direct method just answer,
"You ought to know better." The instructor ought to know those
things anyway.
THE ECON EX
Question: How about the law of diminishing returns?
You won't know that of course. The prof really doesn't expect
you to, anyway; so evade him, play his own game, and frame
your answer something like this: "Well, how about it?"
THE LANGUAGE EX
Question: Do you know how to conjugate the verb "to study"?
This is one of the easiest, and should not give the average student
much difficulty. We recommend the following answer: "No, I don't."

THE LAW EX
Question: What is the method of treatment for prisoners in the county jail?
In the first place, you might answer him by saying, "Don't be so
fresh," or, if you shrink from such a direct method just answer,
"You ought to know better." The instructor ought to know those
things anyway.
THE ECON EX
Question: How about the law of diminishing returns?
You won't know that of course. The prof really doesn't expect
you to, anyway; so evade him, play his own game, and frame
your answer something like this: "Well, how about it?"
THE LANGUAGE EX
Question: Do you know how to conjugate the verb "to study"?
This is one of the easiest, and should not give the average student
much difficulty. We recommend the following answer: "No, I don't."

1. In the first place, don't take the ex if you really don't want to, or can't
spare the time or something. The instructor doesn't want you to
anyway; you're only one more paper to correct.
2. If you decide to take the ex, above all, don't get there on time. Just drift
in any time and stay as long as you like. An informal atmosphere is
to be highly desired.
3. If you feel that your text book, notes, or outlines, etc., will be of any
assistance to you, why bring them along and don't hesitate to use them
freely. The instructor will admire your resourcefulness.
4. Don't hesitate to talk or converse freely with your neighbors. It is such
manifestations of social intercourse and communion that the University
wishes to foster.
5. Make your prof understand that the honor system is still an institution as
far as he's concerned. If he displays a tendency to hang around while
you're gathering data on your examination, why just sneak up on him
quietly and toss him out the window.
Those are merely general rules to be followed in all examinations. Below
follow some sample examinations which may well be given.
THE HISTORY EX
Question: What two nations participated in the Spanish-American War?
Now if you consider this question beside the point, or possibly a
little impertinent, just answer, "None of your business." Or, if
you'd rather, just make up a question of your own and answer it.
Anything will do for a history ex.
THE MATH EX
Question: How do you like math?
The answer to this is, of course, very simple. Just say, "It makes
me sick." The instructor will like that for it's simple, and un
affected straightforwardness.
