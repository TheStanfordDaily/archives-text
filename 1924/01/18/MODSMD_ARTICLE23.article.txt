# CARDINAL SPIRITS RALLY 'ROUND THE BOTTLE
## 
### 
The good old Cardinal spirits will rally 'round the bottle tonight when the
school moves en masse against San Francisco's Second Annual Quatr's Arts
Ball and Artist's Frolic, which has come, by popular interpretation, to be
loosely translated with a literal meaning into "The Four Quarts Brawl."
After a hurried meeting last night, the Executive Committee decided to
grant the affair a closed date in order to preserve its own dignity and save
itself from any embarrassment which may arise from the general depopulation
of the campus which is feared.
A special train, with buffet car attached for preliminary rooting, will leave
Palo Alto at 12:01 Saturday morning and will arrive in San Francisco in
plenty of time to assure all aboard a very merry evening.
Although tickets can be ransomed for five dollars, membership cards to
the Order of the Gate-Crashers, with full guarantees of admission, will be
disposed of at twentyflve cents to the first ten thousand in the line
Attention is also called to the fact that a special rooter's train will leave
San Francisco for Palo Alto at 12:01 p.m., Saturday afternoon. In order to
facilitate the comfort of its guests on the return trip, the Southern Pacific
will provide ice-water and towels free of charge. —K. H.
