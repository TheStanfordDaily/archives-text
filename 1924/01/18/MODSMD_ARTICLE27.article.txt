has grown rapidly in popularity in the United States during the
last ten years, and skiis are now common sights wherever the snow flies,
instead of being curiosities in museums. Skiing (you pronounce it "sheeing"),
was originated in Norway. It is the national sport of that country, where it
is the usual thing for children three years old, as well as grandmothers and
grandfathers, to go gliding around on skiis. In about two weeks the United
States ski team will be competing in the Olympic contests at Chamonix in the
French Alps. Due to the mild winter, our contestants have had a hard time
finding snow to train in, and so were considerably handicapped. Last year
Anders Haugen of Indianapolis won the National Ski championship with 277
points. His longest jump was 122 feet. He has been the National champion
six times. Other prominent ski jumpers of the 1923 season, some of whom
should figure in the Olympic contests, are Harry Lien, Carl Neilsen, and "Alf"
Jensen of the Norge Ski club of Chicago, and Nels Neusen of Revelstoke, B. C.
Nelsen holds the amateur record of 201 feet.
Every February Dartmouth holds a winter carnival with Intercollegiate
championships in skiiing and snow shoeing. T. D. Frost (appropriate name)
was last'year's champion.
The world's record for ski jumping, professional, according to some authori
ties, is 229 feet, made in 1921 by Harry Hall of Detroit.
Crown Prince Olaf of Norway, twenty-one years old, is an enthusiastic
participant in the sport, and has been invited to compete in the Northwest
Ski tournament at Minneapolis on February 3. Ski kjoring, or racing on skis
behind horses, is an exciting winter sport, as is sailing on skis before the wind.
