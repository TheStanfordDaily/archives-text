# ART EXHIBIT IS UNUSUAL
## Water Color Painting More Difficult Than Oil Work, Says John T. Lemos 
### Allene Thorpe 
"It is seldom that Western art lovers have an opportunity of viewing
such a good exhibition of work done entirely in water color," said John T.
Lemos, of the Art Gallery, speaking of the paintings now on display there.
"Contrary to the general impression, pure water color work, or "aquarel" as
it is called by the French artists, is much more difficult than painting in oils.
"In the newer countries, and particularly in the western part of the United
States, high art is generally thought of in terms of oil; but in European art
centers, and especially in England, <$> :

water color painting is held in high
esteem," Lemos declares.
Water Color Society Famed
In order to cultivate an appreciation
of all that is good in water colors, a
group of progressive artists in Cali
fornia have established what is known
as The California Water Color So
ciety. Some of the work of these art
ists is being shown in the exhibition.
These pictures, about fifty in all,
are a splendid example of what can
be done by the water color artist who
"knows how." They include painting
done in pure and transparent water
color, in superimposed wash, in com
binations of water color and pastels,
and in tempora paint. With these, are
a few sketches done in pastels only.
Pure Water Color Difficult
"By far the most difficult medium
of them all is the pure water color
method, in which no opaque color is
used, and where all high lights must
be left on the paper without any re
touching. A good example of this type
of work is the 'Flower Garden,' by
Edouard A. Uysekal. This picture has
been painted in almost pure color, and
must be viewed at a distance to be
properly appreciated. It takes an art
ist who is sure of himself to work in
this manner.
" 'Sunny Slopes,' by John W. Cotton,
and 'When the Sun Is Low,' by Charles
L. A. Smith, are two good examples
of the superimposed method of water
color work. To obtain the effects
shown here, the artist puts a series
of wash tones over one another, rub
bing the paper lightly with a damp
cloth between tones. This has the ef
fect of producing depth and atmos
phere in the high lights, and also a
grain of stipple surface on the paper,
similar to canvas. Charles Smith's
landscape is particularly rich in these
tonal qualities.
Methods Explained
"A combination of water color and
' pastels is shown in 'Early Morning,'

by Dana Bartlett. In work like this,
the water color part is put on first,
and the detaails and accents sketched
over the water color areas," explains
Lemos.
"Art critics sometimes say that it is
poor taste to mix various mediums in
working out a picture, but illustrators
and artists do this quite often with
good results. An example of a pleas
ing effect produced by such a mixture
is found in the painting, 'The Green
Door,' by Bartlett. In this picture,
tempera paint, pencil, and ink have all
been combined."
