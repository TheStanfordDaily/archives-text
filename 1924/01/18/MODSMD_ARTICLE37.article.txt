## 
### 
"Red" Norris, star pole vaulter for
California for the past three years, will
wear a Winged "O" suit this spring,
according to a recent announcement
by Charlie Hunter, Olympic Club track
coach.
Norris is still attending U. C., but is
barred from further service on the var
sity because of his three years previous
intercollegiate competition.
Norris tied with "Bill" Black of Stan
ford in the Big Meet last year.
