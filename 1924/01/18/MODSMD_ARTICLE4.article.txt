# EL CUADRO, THETA CHI, EL TORO WIN BASKET CONTESTS
## Speedy But Ragged Playing Characterizes Group Two Intramural Games 
### 
El Toro sprang a surprise on intra
mural followers yesterday when it de
feated Delta Upsilon 11 to 6 in round
two of the intramural basketball tourna
ment.
El Cuadro and Theta Chi were also
victors of the day, while Alpha Sigma
Phi defaulted to Phi Sigma Kappa.
Fives Show Good Team Work.
Fast team work was shown by both
fives the first period of the El Toro-
D. U. contest and the ball changed
hands frequently, being carried into the
opposing territory many times by each
squad. The defensives were not so
strong, however, and it was only the
inability to find the basket which pre
vented the D. U.'s from getting a
larger lead the first half. The score at
half time was 4 to 2 with Delta Upsilon
leading.
An improvement in its passing game
was made in the second half by El Toro
and it began the period by keeping the
ball in its own territory most of the
time. On the other hand, Delta Up
silon could not find the basket to any
greater success than in the first half,
while five additional points were scored
by El Toro. Only two counts wert
allowed D. U., and El Toro retained
its lead, winning 11 to 6.
A. T. O's Smothered.
Theta Chi downed Adpha Tau
Omega 17 to 6 in a fast but slightly
ragged contest. Both fives attempted
a number of long shots and dribbles
the first period, but Theta Chi com
bined a superior brand of team work
with better accuracy and created a
lead of 9 to 0.
Armour began the second half by
scoring for A. T. O. on two long shots,
but these were the only two of the
three allowed them that period. Theta
Chi, on the contrary, used a number of
short passes to advantage and scored
eight additional points although many
shots were missed.
Schultzberg led the scoring for
Theta Chi with 7 points, Smith follow
ing with 4 and Hogle with 2.
For A. T. 0., Armour scored four of
the six points credited, while Taylor,
Graves, and Stratton also showed up
well.
El Cuadro Wins, 17 to 10.
El Cuadro defeated Chi Psi 17 to 10
in another ragged contest. Play the
first half was up and down the floor,
and both fives took long shots at the
basket, using little team work. Cava
naugh, for Chi Psi, accounted for two
long tries, but a lead of one free throw
for El Cuadro made the score 9 to 8
at the end of the half.
The second period developed into a
rough contest. Little passing was done
and dribbling was used to put the ball
in position to shoot under the respective
goals.
Robinson led the offense for El
Cuadro and was aided by Harries at
guard and Holstein at forward.
King showed up well for Chi Psi.
