# UNDEFEATED BABE TEAM WILL MEET SANTA ROSA HIGH
## Freshmen Doped to Win From Strong Northern Five In Preliminary 
### 
The undefeated freshman hoop ag
gregation goes against the Santa Rosa
High School five at 7 tomorrow eve
ning in the pavilion, in a preliminary
to the varsity game.
Santa Rosa has a good high school
team, but it will take more than a
good prep five to register a win over
Coach "Husky" Hunt's fighting babes.
Freshman followers are not expecting
a setback during the preliminary sea
son.
Babes Show Up Well
The babes looked better than ever
Wednesday against the Santa Clara
first year men. They had a lead of
eighteen points at the end of the first
half, and didn't have to work hard in
the final period to keep the Mission
players from scoring.
Not a weak spot can be found on
the team this year. The five regulars
have been playing as good a brand
of ball as a coach could ask for this
early in the season.
Anderson Shows Class
The playing of Ned Anderson at cen
ter Wednesday was a big surprise to
those who had not seen him in action
