# UNDEFEATED BABE TEAM WILL MEET SANTA ROSA HIGH
## Freshmen Doped to Win From Strong Northern Five In Preliminary 
### 
The undefeated freshman hoop ag
gregation goes against the Santa Rosa
High School five at 7 tomorrow eve
ning in the pavilion, in a preliminary
to the varsity game.
Santa Rosa has a good high school
team, but it will take more than a
good prep five to register a win over
Coach "Husky" Hunt's fighting babes.
Freshman followers are not expecting
a setback during the preliminary sea
son.
Babes Show Up Well
The babes looked better than ever
Wednesday against the Santa Clara
first year men. They had a lead of
eighteen points at the end of the first
half, and didn't have to work hard in
the final period to keep the Mission
players from scoring.
Not a weak spot can be found on
the team this year. The five regulars
have been playing as good a brand
of ball as a coach could ask for this
early in the season.
Anderson Shows Class
The playing of Ned Anderson at cen
ter Wednesday was a big surprise to
those who had not seen him in action
before. Jayred was unable to start
the contest because of an injured
knee, so Anderson substituted for him.
From the start of the contest An
derson was all over the court, inter
cepting, passing, dribbling, and best
of allâ€”shooting with exceptional ac
curacy. He scored five baskets. His
work Wednesday will probably war
rant his being started at the pivot
position tomorrow. Jayred may play
if his knee is in good shape. Jayred
and Anderson are putting up a hard
fight to play this position regularly
and Hunt is having a difficult job de
ciding between the two.
Team Unusually Strong
Price has one forward position
cinched. Either David or Riese will
start as the other forward. David was
a little off in his playing against Santa
( lara, but when he is playing his usual
brand of ball he is better than Riese.
Riese is a good defensive forward,
and succeeded in stopping Wallace,
the star Santa Clara forward from do
ing much scoring.
Newhouse almost completely stops
scoring within the fifteen foot zone.
It is impossible for an opponent to
knock him over. He gets the ball from
the back board after nearly every shot,
and passes it safely.
Shipkey and Williams are both
showing up well at standing guard.
Shipkey will probably start tomorrow.
Williams can take his place without
slowing up the work of the team.
