row or Wednesday.
A count of the votes already cast in the

Senate Contradicted

of propaganda in connection with the
peace plan, I feel that there is little to
fear with such men as Brandt Whitlock,
Elihu Root, and Roscoe Pounds on the
Committee of Awards," said Professor
Stuart today.
"The accusations of the Senators
bringing charges against the Bok com
mittee should have little weight when
men of such character as those judging
the plans are considered."
