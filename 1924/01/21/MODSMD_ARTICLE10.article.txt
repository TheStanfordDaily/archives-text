# SPIRITUAL FACULTY IN MAN SUBJECT OF SERMON YESTERDAY
## 
### 
In his sermon on "man's spiritual fac
ulty or the faculty of God," yesterday
morning in the Memorial Church, the
Rev. J. Wither Gresham. D.D., Dean of
Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, took
for his theme the words of Elihu in the
book of Job: "There is a spirit in man,
and the inspiration of the Almighty
giveth him understanding."
"The spiritual faculty, like others, may
be developed and cultivated, or neglected
and lost," he said. A striking example
of the loss of certain faculties was given
by Dr. Gresham when he related the case
of Charles Darwin, whose mind became
such a machine for grinding out general
laws from facts, that he was no longer
able to read poetry, or even listen to
music. A loss of these tastes is a loss
to happiness and injurious to the intel
lect, and the spiritual faculty, when in
too consistent disuse, may suffer a sim
ilar loss, according to Dr. Gresham.
"I think college life with its emphasis
on mental interests, and its new field of
social relationships, has a tendency
temporarily to obscure the religious life,"
says Dr. Gresham.
"However," he continued, "it is a great
mistake to suppose that the partial eclipse
of the religious sensibilities which comes
to every college man is either to be
feared or discouraged. Later on, the
man, or the woman emerges with deeper
convictions and stronger faith.
"This is especially the case in a college
like that of Stanford University, with its
Memorial Church and the constant ad
ministration of such a leader as the Uni
versity possesses in Dr. Gardner. The
University life here at Stanford keeps
ever before the student the place of re
ligion and the power of faith, and thus,
spiritual foundations are unconsciously
laid for the work of life."
