# JOURNALISTS WILL HEAR PAUL COWLES
## Work of Associated Press Will Be Discussed by Newspaper Man 
### 
The work of the Associated Press
in the collection and dissemination
of news will probably be the subject
of the talk by Paul Cowles, superin
tendent of the western division of the
Associated Press, at a meeting of the
American Journalists Association to
be held at the home of Professor Eve
rett Smith, 12 Alvarado, on Wednes
day evening, January 23, at 7:30
o'clock.
The Associate Press is grouped in
four divisions in the United States,
the central division with the head of
fice in Chicago, Illinois; the southern
division centered at Atlanta, Georgia;
the northern division around New
York, and the western division, of San
Francisco. Cowles has been superin
tendent of every division of the Asso
ciated Press during his journalistic
career.
Exciting Times
He was in Chile during the earth
quake, and was a correspondent in
China during the Boxer rebellion.
The meeting is not confined to mem
bers of the journalists' association,
but is open to every one interested in
newspaper making. An informal dis
cussion concerning newspaper work
will follow the talk by Cowles.
