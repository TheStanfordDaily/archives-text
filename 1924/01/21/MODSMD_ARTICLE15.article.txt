# WASHINGTON CREW TO FURNISH COMPETITION
## 
### 
Crew practice at the University of
Washington is well under way and the
rivalry for the various positions on the
varsity assures a strong competitor for
the national intercollegiate rowing cham
pionship at Poughkeepsie again this year.
Last year the Washington crew won the
championship.
Every member of the championship
varsity eight, except three who gradu
ated, is hack in school and is expected
to make his appearance at practice this
week. Two men will battle for the
stroke oar. Dow Walling, who stroked
last year's crew, is the outstanding figure
for the seat because of his experience,
although A1 Ulbrickson, 1923 frosh
stroke, is expected to give him a hard
fight.
