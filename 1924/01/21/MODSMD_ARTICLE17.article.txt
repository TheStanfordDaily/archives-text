# SEQUOIA SECONDS BEAT CHINESE IN INTRAMURAL GAME
## Independents Fall Before Theta Xi Offensive In Fast Game 
### 
Theta Xi beat the Independents 11
to 2 and Sequoia Seconds smothered
the Chinese Club with a score of 48
to 4 in Friday's intramural contests.
Superior teamwork of the Theta
Xis proved its worth over the indi
vidual work of the Independents in
the early stages of the game. Despite
the clever floor work and strong de
fense shown by Sanders and Abbot
of the Independents, the Theta Xi of
fensive managed to work In close
enough to secure their 11 points, 7 of
which came during the first half.
The Independents gleaned their lone
field goal late in the second half when
Herz slipped through the defense and
made a goal from a close-in position.
Passing Is Poor
The game was fast and ragged
throughout. Both teams played a poor
passing game and the ball changed
hands many times. Abbot, who played
running guard for the Independents
during the first period, showed con
siderable class in fast dribbling and
passing and played even better the
second period as forward.
Lawrence of the Theta Xi was high
point man with two field goals to his
credit while Mulchay, Porterfield, and
Maillot each succeeded in making one.
Sequoia swamped the Chinese Club
with superior defensive and offensive
playing, shutting them out complete
ly during the first period with a 14 to
0 score and adding 34 more points
during the second half while they
allowed the Chinese only four markers.
Chinese Defense Weak
May, Brown, and Cole made fre
quent inroads into the Club defense
for scores. May was high point man
with a total of 16 points, Cooper was
a close second with 12 points, while
Brown and Cole each made 10. Sah
and Chang were the only men to make
a goal for the Chinese.
Although Sah, Tsieh, and Ta'am of
the Salvatierra Street club showed
flashes of speed and form, there was
an apparent lack of teamwork, and
especially of a good defense. Their
passing was accurate but much too
slow, and Sequoia's strong defense
would break up a play before it had
gotten well under way.
Sah, Ta'am, and Chang were the
oustanding players for the Chinese
Club and showed some clever work
despite the overwhelming defeat of
the team.
