# FOOD OR NO FOOD
## 
### 
Ever since Abraham Hatchetstein started selling his planked ptero
dactyls at the Elite Cave it has been the nature of the human race to raise
moans about its food. If it's not a kick about quality, it's a kick about
quantity ; if the prices aren't too high, why then, there's not enough variety
—same darn thing every day, this place is the rocks!
All these chronic kickers on edibility standards are the product of the
convention of food-fighters, and would complain lustily about the rotten
nectar and stale ambrosia, if they got the chance. All men are apt to get
personal about their grub—unless they have cooked it themselves.

Bill Brogan, sitting on the table in the Union store and swinging a
loose foot, had something new to offer on the situtaion.
"Seenis to me," said Bill, "that the Union Board of Governors is off
on the wrong foot when it prohibits a store over in the dormitories until
next year. The main reason advanced, if I get it right, is a fear.
"This fear is that the store, by its temporary nature, will not satisfy
the students who always kick about grub. They believe. I guess, that they
are in so bad now that any further enterprise, when handicapped bv its
temporary nature, would just mean more bricks flying.
"All wrong, seems to me. The Union Board has done everything it can
with this store, and the grub served is good. But I should think that the
Union Board would be more afraid of getting its first attempt perma
nently in bad by making it a long-distance monopoly, than they would fear
the complaints against a counter in the Encina dining halls which every one
would know to be temporary.
"There will always be a kick coming from some people on the grub.
It's when there is no grub that the real kick comes forth. You're hearing
it now."
