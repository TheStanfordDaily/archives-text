# R. O. T. C. CADETS DENIED GLORIES OF BRASS BUTTONS
## 
### 
R. O. T.C. cadets will be denied
the glories of wearing brilliant brass
ornaments. A recent army order made
brass the official metal for uniform
ornaments and buttons in all branches
of the regular army.
Even cadet officers must give up
their new metal work to be blackened
into the regulation "bronze," and any
one attempting to develop a high
polish upon present equipment will be
looked upon with displeasure by the
authorities.

It is planned to replace the Mexican
dollar and foreign coins in China with
a new uniform Chinese silver dollar.
