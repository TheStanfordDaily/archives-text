Consensus of campus opinion asked for in "Another Viewpoint" (see page 2):
"I think the band's idea of moving into a circus tent is the
acme of appropriateness. Especially the stripes."—Hugo, the
Midnight Moth.
"Immediately back of the library is a splendid place for band practice.
Perhaps with a little effort they can drown out the sorority chatter at Table 5
in the reading room so that some of us may study."—Anonymous Phi Beta
Kappa.
"We think a special election, referendum, and recall should
be held on such a matter of extreme importance. What will the
succeeding generations at Stanford say if we let this thing slip
by without a murmur?"—Ex. Committee.
"So it's a circus tent now, eh? Well, then, our musical future is at stake,
all right."—First Violinist, Stanford Band.
"I think it is disgraceful that the band is going to hold its
orgies right back of the Library."—One of the Five (100).
"It will be a good thing for freshmen, because the sponsors will probably
move out now. No, the freshman won't—they can't."—Humble Senior.
—ANONYMOUS.

Anyway, the Bolt Peace Plan will get 21,507
votes, seeing as how none of the contestants
as yet are sure that they didn't win it.

Now that this talk of a i*izz sheet is bobbing up again—and reliable
authority has it that it will be out in a couple of weeks — this great
family department for clean homes wishes to suggest a few rules for
regulating such a publication. Such a one as last year's must not be
allowed to appear again . . .
1. All material must be submitted to President Coolidge and his cabinet at
least two days prior to publication.
2. Whatever they say should be entirely disregarded.
3. Proper names of women should be omitted entirely . . . Who said any
thing about improper names?
4. The faculty should not be "razzed"—be unfair and tell the truth.
5. A public apology should be prepared beforehand, the right to sign being
sold for $10 per signature. In this way the sheet will pay for itself.
6. Nothing that is published should hurt anyone's feelings.
7. More than is necessary. ANONYMOUS.
