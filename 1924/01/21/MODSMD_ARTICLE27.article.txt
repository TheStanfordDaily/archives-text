Editor The Daily Palo. Sir: When
will a certain element of men in the Uni
versity learn the difference between
maintaining of a tradition and pure
rowdyism-
The custom that has been established
of not "queening" to athletic contests is
a fine one, and is one of the many
things that distinguishes Stanford from
other universities.
Rut why should a few of these mis
guided, would-be collegiate goofs raise
their voices, which in many cases aren't
too cultured, and cry, "Queener!' at
every man who accompanies a woman to
any of the basketball games?
That cry, which is supposed to force
the one at whom it is directed to hide
his head in shame, was raised entirely
too often at the Stanford-Olympic game.
What impression did the rooters for
the Olympic Club, who brought their
wives to the game, take away regarding
a Stanford rooting section?
Professors and their better halves came
came in for their shouts from the jeering
section, the members of which were scat
tered through the crowd. I believe that
if an eighty-year-old man on three
crutches had come to the game these
same collegiate boys would have yawped
"Queener!"
Perhaps that is the right way to keep
up the old tradition of razzing a student
who queens to a game, but I believ that
who queens to a game, but I believe that
we'd be better off if a few of these loud
and use it for chewing gum, which is
about their idea of a major sport.
