# DRINKING AT U. C. IS ON WANE SAYS DEAN OF MEN
## 
### 
BERKELEY â€”Paul Cadman, assist
ant dean of men of the University of
California, doesn't believe that drink
ing is increasing at the University of
California, although there are no com
parative figures at hand. He believes
that students have their own situation
well in hand at the University and
as far as the presence of liquor 011
the campus is concerned, it is prac
tically negligible.
"There were only two cases last
semester where liquor was brought
to the university campus, and in both
cases the guilty students were sus
pended after a hearing before the stu
dent affairs committee, controlling the
student self government," states Mr.
Cadman.
"1 do not think there is more drink
ing now than in the days before the
eighteenth amendment, although the
flask is a decided menace."
