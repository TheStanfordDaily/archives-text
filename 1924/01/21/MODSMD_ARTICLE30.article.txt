### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Track fans were looking forward to another series of sensational record
breaking indoor races this winter between Joie Ray and Willie Ritola, and
then Ritola spoiled it all by beating it back to his "native country, Finland.
Willie says he'll represent the old country in the Olympics, and hopes to meet
Ray next June at the Columbus stadium. Ray, being a cocky American, merely
answers, "I see you're Finnish," and goes on breaking more records. It's
possible that Chesty Joie may meet Nurmi, one of Ritola's countrymen, on
the boards this winter.
Nurmi accomplished last summer what Joie had been trying to do for years
without success —he broke Norman Taber's world's record for the mile run.
During the last indoor track season, Ray set seven new American records at
distances from one and a half miles to 5,000 metres. He beat Ritola, and was
also beaten by him. Willie's best marks were made in the three and four mile
runs. Ray competed only in the 1,500 metre run at the 1920 Olympics, but it
is quite possible that he will run in the 5,000 metre race at the Paris Olympics
in an effort to take another fall out of Ritola.
