# "Blink" Williamson Leaves for Orient
## 
### 
"Blink" Williamson, who has starred
in Stanford athletics for the past four
years, will leave soon for a trip
to the Orient. Williamson says that
he will make the trip a combination
of business and pleasure. His business
will be to see that he makes enough
on the ship to get money for pleasure
ashore. Eventually Williamson plans
to extend his journey to a complete
circle of the globe. Williamson was a
point-winner for three years in the
quarter mile, and was on the first
squad in football this fall.
