Senior poloists won the first interclass
mallet contest from the junior four Fri
day afternoon by a 7-6 score. The
fourth-year men took the lead in the
opening period and continued to score
consistently until the fifth, when they
were held scoreless and tied by the
juniors. One goal made in the final
chukker won the game over the juniors'
six-point handicap.
Fast field playing and better team
work made possible the senior victory.
Three varsity players, Otto Barby, Ralph
Barby, and Ed Laub, proved too much
for the inexperienced juniors. John
Irwin was the only varsity man in the
third-year team line-up. The senior
handicap totals 14 points and the juniors
8, which gives a difference of six points,
these being scored to the junior credit
at the beginning of the game. The
third-year team failed to score in the
six periods.
Two goals were made by the seniors
in the first and second periods; one in
the third and fourth, bringing the score
to a tie. The final goal was made by
the winning team just before time 011
the last chukker was called.
