scoring came as a result of long field
goals.

A strong Santa Clara defense was not powerful enough to check a con
sistent Cardinal scoring machine and Stanford was able to add a Missionite
scalp to her rapidly growing belt with a 27 to 16 victory in the pavilion
last Saturday.
The feature of the game was the Missionite defense. By playing close to
the basket with a five-man defense, Santa Clara regularly checked the advance
of the Stanford offensive and forced the Cards to make long tries for the goal.
Nevers was the first man to score for Stanford with a long field goal. He
repeated soon after with another score from the floor. Captain "Nip" McHose
followed on Never's heels with two additional points . Santa Clara then
scored five points, bring the score 8 to 5 in favor of Stanford . Score at half

time was 17 to 9, the Cardinals lead
ing.
Stanford played a waiting game in
the second half, stalling until such
times when they could find an open
ing in the Friar defense. Most of the
scoring came as a result of long field
goals.
McHose Active
"Nip" McHose was by far the out
standing player on the floor. He scored
13 of the 27 Stanford points.
Vukota starred for the visitors with
5 points. The flashy Santa Slara for
ward often evaded the Cardinal de
fense and, aided by well-aimed pass
ing from Fawke, kept the Stanford
guards on the jump.
Mcßurney played one of the best
floor games seen on the Stanford
court this season. Continually on the
go, the Stanford running guard man
floor right after the start of the quar
ter. Riese went in for Price and Jay
red for Anderson.
Jayred scored from under the bas
ket on an out of bounds play. Both
he and David scored middle distance
shots before the half ended. The score
now stood 19 to 1.
Price returned to the game at the
start of the second half. He was the
big cog in the scoring machine during
the quarter, making three field goals
and two foul tries.
Subs Used
The score at the end of the third
period was 29 to 1 for the Babes, and
Coach "Husky" Hunt sent in a steady
stream of substitutes.
Blazier took center and a few min
utes later Riese and Anderson took
the places they had had earlier in the
game. Williams replaced Shipkey and
Joseph went in for Newliouse. The
ball went back and forth with neither
side being able to score. Fouls were
frequent and the Santa Rosa team
scored four of them during this period.
Anderson made a long shot for the
Babes which ended the scoring. Hoff
man, Southworth, Lewis, and Taylor
were sent in to finish the game for the
Babes.
