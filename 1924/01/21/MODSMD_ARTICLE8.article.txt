# SANTA ROSANS ARE WEAK ON OFFENSIVE
## Babe Defense Is Too Much For Northerners; 1927 Wins by 29-5 Score 
### 
Santa Rosa junior college was un
j able to stand against the onslaughts
of the Stanford freshmen in the pa
vilion Saturday night, and the latter
won easily by the score of 29 to 5.
The five Santa Rosa scores came
from the foul line. The five man de-
I dense used by the Babes still remains
an unfathomable mystery to the north
; erners, for they did not get through
iit a single time during the entire
j game.
Much of the credit for this shut-out
! goes to Newhouse and Shipkey, who
played the guard positions during the
greater part of the game. However,
the whole team played good defensive
! ball, and on the few occasions that a
! Santa Rosan managed to get through
: the first defense Newhouse, the big
standing guard, broke up the play
with ease.
Good Passing
The freshmen worked their passes
better Saturday than in any of their
: preceding games. There was very lit-
I tie wild shooting. Price, David, Ander
: son, and Shipkey worked the ball to
j the hoop and if there was no opening
for a shot, threw the ball out to New
; house and started over again. As a
| result the Babes had the ball in their
i possession most of the time.
Anderson started the game at center
| but Jayred took his place for about
half of the time.
I The Babes started with a rush and
had three baskets and two fouls
j chalked up to their credit before the
j end of the first quarter. The Santa
Rosans had chances to score on foul
tries but missed all of them during
: this period. The score stood 8 to 0 for
the 1927 team.
