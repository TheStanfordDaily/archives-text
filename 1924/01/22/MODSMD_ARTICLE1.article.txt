# THREE ARTISTS TO PRESENT MUSICAL PROGRAM TONIGHT
## Allen, Mrs. Cowger, and Davison Will Appear At Memorial Church 
### 
Mrs. Lester Cowger, soprano, and
Malcolm Davison, cellist, will assist
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
in giving a musical program in the Me
morial church at 7:30 tonight.
"Chorale in A minor" by Cesar
Franck will be the first number. It is
one of the three great masterpieces
composed by Franck on his death-bed.
The three chorals are not, like the
Bach Chorale-Preludes, based upon
the traditional hymns, but are wholly
original. They reflect, however, both
the grandeur of the Bach influence and
the mysticism of Franck's spiritual
ideals.
Alessandro's Scarlatti's "Come Unto
Me" will be a soprano solo with the
cello obligato.
The next numbers "Lied from the '24
Pieces in Free Style,'" and "Allegro
from the First Symphony" were com
posed by Louis Vierne, who was a
pupil of Franck. Although he reflects
the master's influence, his own original
ity and inspiration place him in the
front rank of musical composers. The
Lied is chamber music which makes no
use of anything but the cello voices in
the pedals. The Allegro has somewhat
the spirit of a joyous Scherzo with a
canon for the middle section which re
minds one of Franck.
Mrs. Cowger will sing "Ave Maria"
by Franz Schubert. A pleasing lyric
voice and an attractive style charac
terizes her work as soloist in the Palo
Alto Christian Church, and also in her
work on the concert platform, and in
oratorios.
A change in the program has been
made substituting a 'cello solo, "Wal
ter's Prize Song," from "Die Meister
singer," for the "Reverie," by Golter
mann. The "Introduction to the Third
Act," and the "March of the Master
singers" are also from "Die Meister
singers" by Richard Wagner.
Contrast will be shown in the pro
gram in the "Introduction to the Third
Act," which is dreamy and quiet, and
the "March of the Mastersingers"
which is a big conventional march.
Davison, who is a Stanford student,
has studied under Joseph Zoellncr for
a number of years, and has appeared in
programs on the campus and in Palo
Alto. In addition he has made two
tours with the Stanford Glee Club.
The cello solo. "Walter's Prize Song,"
is a well known composition.

use of anything but the cello voices in
the pedals. The Allegro has somewhat
the spirit of a joyous Scherzo with a
canon for the middle section which re
minds one of Franck.
Mrs. Cowger will sing "Ave Maria"
by Franz Schubert. A pleasing lyric
voice and an attractive style charac
terizes her work as soloist in the Palo
Alto Christian Church, and also in her
work on the concert platform, and in
oratorios.
A change in the program has been
made substituting a 'cello solo, "Wal
ter's Prize Song," from "Die Meister
singer," for the "Reverie," by Golter
mann. The "Introduction to the Third
Act," and the "March of the Master
singers" are also from "Die Meister
singers" by Richard Wagner.
Contrast will be shown in the pro
gram in the "Introduction to the Third
Act," which is dreamy and quiet, and
the "March of the Mastersingers"
which is a big conventional march.
Davison, who is a Stanford student,
has studied under Joseph Zoellncr for
a number of years, and has appeared in
programs on the campus and in Palo
Alto. In addition he has made two
tours with the Stanford Glee Club.
The cello solo. "Walter's Prize Song,"
is a well known composition.
Mrs. Lester Cowger, soprano, and
Malcolm Davison, cellist, will assist
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
in giving a musical program in the Me
morial church at 7:30 tonight.
"Chorale in A minor" by Cesar
Franck will be the first number. It is
one of the three great masterpieces
composed by Franck on his death-bed.
The three chorals are not, like the
Bach Chorale-Preludes, based upon
the traditional hymns, but are wholly
original. They reflect, however, both
the grandeur of the Bach influence and
the mysticism of Franck's spiritual
ideals.
Alessandro's Scarlatti's "Come Unto
Me" will be a soprano solo with the
cello obligato.
The next numbers "Lied from the '24
Pieces in Free Style,'" and "Allegro
from the First Symphony" were com
posed by Louis Vierne, who was a
pupil of Franck. Although he reflects
the master's influence, his own original
ity and inspiration place him in the
front rank of musical composers. The
Lied is chamber music which makes no
use of anything but the cello voices in
the pedals. The Allegro has somewhat
the spirit of a joyous Scherzo with a
canon for the middle section which re
minds one of Franck.
