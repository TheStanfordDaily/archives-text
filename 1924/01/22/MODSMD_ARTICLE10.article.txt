# BOOK FROM CZAR'S LIBRARY IS SHOWN IN HOOVER EXHIBIT
## 
### 
The Hoover War Library has kept
its treasures hoarded long enough in
the dark steel-lined rooms of the Li
brary's inner recesses. Henceforth,
from time to time, interesting and
valuable books, papers, and documents
will be brought out to the light of
day for the general edification of the
public. Two eye-arresting show cases,
placed in the lower entrance hall of
the library, will make this display
possible. The initial exhibit is made
up of volumes collected by Professor
Frank A. Golder of the Stanford His
tory department.
Historical significance, celebrity of
their owners, or beauty of workman
ship in the bindings and print of the
volumes themselves has been made a
basis for selecting the books shown.
These are only representatives of a
large and interesting collection.
Historical Documents
There is a facsimile of the acts of
abdication of the Czar and the Grand
Duke Michael Alexandrovich, and 1 a
copy of the Izvestra containing the
article which is the cause of Secre
tary Hughes' refusal to recognize the
Soviet government of Russia. In this
article the Third International is
spoken of as part of the Russian gov
ernment, according to Hughes. This
organization distributes propaganda in
the United States; so if it is part of
the Soviet government, that govern
ment can not be recognized.
The fourth oldest manuscript of the
New Testament in Russian, written
In 1092, is shown. It is called the
Archangel Evangile. The translation
is said to most nearly resemble that
of the modern Russian Bible of all
old translations.
Artistry in Bindings
Beautifully covered with embossed
leather and silk-lined is the repre
sentative of the Czar's library. It is
only the report of a congress called
by Paul I, 1796-1801, but this does not
detract from the magnificence of its
exterior.
From the personal library of Wil
liam II of Hohenzollern there is an
account by Captain von Drygalski of
the "Organization of the Russian
Army." The book is marked quite
definitely as William's own possession.
The Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailo
vich contributes a splendidly illus
trated copy of the famous play, "Sor
row from Wisdom," while a book of
poetry comes from the library of
Grand Duke Constantino Romanoff, of
the Imperial family of Russia.
There is a report of the work of
the ministry of the Interior during the
past century in two huge volumes, and
a history of the hunts of the Grand
Dukes and Czars of Russia from the
tenth to the nineteenth century.

The amount of fat in some coffee

exterior.
