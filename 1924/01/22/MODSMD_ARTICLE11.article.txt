# COMEDY DRAMA PREFERRED
## Educational Movies Disliked By Students Declares Theatre Manager 
### Ray Spangler 
"The type of picture the average
Stanford student likes best is a good,
clean comedy drama," says F. A. Le-
Suer. manager or the Varsity theater.
He cites Tom Meighan's "Back Home
and Broke" as a typical example.
"Of course, in a student body of
2ROO, one is bound to find diversity of
tastes. Many people will flock to Â»
theater if they think they are going
to see something they shouldn't. Last
week I ran Elinor Glyn's 'Six Days'
and had one or two very good houses
during the run. But T didn't like the
picture, and I don't think the majority
of people who saw it liked it either.
They would rather sen a good bit of
comedv written around a clever plot.
I think I broke the record on Harold
Lloyd's "Safety Last."
Educational Films Disliked
"Educational sluff doesn't go at all.
It is only natural that students should
n't like it, but there are some town
people who really enjoy it.
"Occasionally, we run a poor pic
ture. People come out of the show

complaining that the feature was ter
rible. Well, we know when we run a
poor picture. But it is the best we
can do. Between the two shows in
Palo Alto, we run six and seven pic
tures a week. And if anybody tells
you that seven good pictures are made
every week, he's crazy.
Poor Movies Unavoidable
"Another thing, to get pictures from
distributing organizations, we often
have to contract for either their entire
output or at least a block of ten or
more pictures. Obviously, we cannot
review all of these pictures before we
sign up for them. Some of them will
be good, and others poor.
"We have in Palo Alto unusually
critical audiences. The people are
well educated, and have high tastes.
The picture that, goes over big in San
Francisco may be an absolute failure
here. Film salesmen try to sell me
their pictures on the basis of box
office receipts in other cities. But I've
been here for twelve years, and I
Know that a picture has to be really
good to get over in Palo Alto."
