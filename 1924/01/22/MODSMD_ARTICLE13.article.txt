# UNIQUE YELL-LEADING COURSE ESTABLISHED
## 
### 
To the end that Stanford may never
suffer from lack of proper guidance
for its cheering sections, a thorough
course in the art of leading yells has i
been established at Encina gymna
.
sium.
Lectures by various members of the
faculty, dealing with the theoretical
side of the subject, and practical
training at the hands of the present
yell-leaders, will constitute the work ,
of the course.
The course will be open to sopho
mores only, and may be taken by them
for physical education credit. Any
sophomore may transfer to the class
from his present sport.
Although the plans for the class are
not entirely settled it is assured by
the Rally Committee, which is spon
soring the idea, that the following lec
tures will be given:
"Bleacher Psychology," by Profes- 1
sor Strong of the Psychology depart
ment. Two lectures.
"The Correct Use of the Voice," by
Professor Basset of the English de
partment.
"Development of Stage Presence," j
by Gordon Davis, dramatic coach.
"Bleacher Singing," by Warren D. 1
Allen, organist.
"What a Coach Expects from the
Yell Leader." by Andy Kerr.
The first meeting of the class will
be held Wednesday at 4 p.m. in the
varsity training quarters at Encina
gymnasium. The hour for the subse
quent meetings of the class will be
arranged at that time.
This is recommended by the Rally
Committee as a real opportunity for
those sophomores who are not out for
some activity to work into the posi
tion of yell-leader.
Experience is not necessary for en
rollment in this course. Every phase
of the subject will be taken up and
gone over by capable teachers. Writ
ten examinations will be held and will
cover the lectures in the course.
The members of the class will have
an opportunity to try out before the
bleachers at the preliminary basket
ball games.
