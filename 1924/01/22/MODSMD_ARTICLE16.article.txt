# VARSITY NINE AND HANDS ID OPEN SEASON TOMORROW
## Cliff to Bring Independents Down for 32nd Annual Game With Cards 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team will
open the 1924 season tomorrow after
noon at 2:30 against Cliff Ireland's In
dependents on the Cardinal diamond.
Considerable interest should be
shown in the contest as it will be the
thirty-second (,-ear that Ireland has
brought a team to the Stanford campus.
It will be the first game of the season
for the Cards.
Varsity Strengthened.
\\ ith the addition of several players
who were ineligible last season, the var
sity looks to be in every respect
stronger than the 1922 aggregation.
Lawson, Cuddeback, and Johnston,
who were missing from the line-ups
last year are strong additions to the
squad. All are good fielders and rank
among the best hitters on the team.
Cliff is bringing a boquet of sham
rocks whose records brand them as real
baseball players. Cliff adnrits rather
forcefully that his flock is well on its
way to big league fame.
Ditzler or Ovioatt to Start.
Either Oviatt or Ditzler will start on
the mound for the Cards according to
Coach Wolter. Lawson will be behind
the plate at the start of the game.
For the infield positions Wolter has
chosen Woodward at first base, Roberts
at second, Mulchay at short stop, and
Cuddeback at third.
In the outfield: Johnston at left
field, McCandless at center, and Trace
at right.
Substitutions will no doubt be fre
quent. Patterson will probably see ac
tion as catcher; Solomon, Teague,
Lowenstein, and Campbell are the re
serve pitchers. The best prospects for
third base substitutions are Green and
Brown, for second Draper. Outfielders
who will probably sec action during the
game are: Dickey, Fuller, and May.
Kohler is also a dependable substitute
for the catcher's position.
