# THE 						GAS THAT ERASES LIFE
## 
### 
There is a small island off the coast of Luzon, on which a short time
ago a dozen or so people were living, with cattle, horses, sheep, and other
livestock. Back in the wooded hills there was an abundance of wild life.
The United States government bought out the inhabitants of the
island, and moved them to Manila, leaving the livestock to forage. Then
the air forces at Manila loaded three bombing planes with a couple of gas
bombs apiece, and gave the pilots orders to bomb the island.
The six bombs were dropped as the planes roared over the woods and
fields of the small island. One went in the sea. The explosives were so
arranged as to spread the gas laterally along the ground, without dissipat
ing them by the force of the impact.

Ten days later investigators landed 011 the island. The livestock, the
wild life, the trees, even the insects were wiped out; 110 life remained
above ground. The entire island was a barren mound of earth. Along
the beach the sea had washed up quantities of dead fish.

That is the prospect for the next warâ€”the war by scientific extermina
tion. A continent could become a waste, a nation a mass of dead, in less
time than it took the Germans to march through Belgium.
A fleet of 40 bombing planes, by modern aircraft methods, could travel
from Europe to the Atlantic seaboard in sixty hours; if even one of the
forty could penetrate our air defenses by traveling high and coming over
the defense line at dawn, its load of bombs could wipe out all of New
York City, Brooklyn, and part of New Jersey. The buildings would not
l>e destroyed, but the thousands in them would be dead.

While these things are rushing upon us we are concerned only with our
petty squabbles, with such medieval piffle as the Ku Klux Klan, and with
our own supreme self-importance.
Regardless of private opinions on the plan for peace submitted to Mr.
Bok, and regardless of whether it would accomplish the millennium of
world arbitration, it is a move towards that goal. The vote being taken
on the plan is not so much an indication of the desire of the people to
adopt the plan in toto, as it is a ballot on whether the people want peace
by arbitration, or war by science.
The move for peace is irresistible, world-wide; the League of Nations
is the instrument at hand to aid that move. The Bok Peace Plan provides
a means to make the League effective by the entrance of t|ie United
States, and to make the United States safe in entering th covenant by
adequate, double-ribbed safeguards. A vote on the Bok Plan is a vote for
peace, an index of the desire of the people to do away forever with the
gas that kills all life.
