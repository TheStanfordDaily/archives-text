# Irish Propaganda Wave Hits Campus; No Snakes Appear
## 
### 
Although no snakes have yet been
seen on the campus, "the wearin' of
the green" is all the vogue today. A
green tie, a wing collar, a green
flower in the buttonhole, and a derby
hat don't mean that the proud wearer
has an originality complex; it merely
means that if all goes well he will be
a full-fledged member of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers after
the curfew rings tonight. The names
of the initiates have been carefully
suppressed and even the most hard
ened campus geneologist would have
difficulty in recognizing his room
mate amidst the scenery, so the new
brothers will not gain the proper pub
licity until tomorrow.
