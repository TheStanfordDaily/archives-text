# The 						Promise of Peace

### 
(ANOTHER VIEWPOINT)

Civilization is headed for its own destruction, using •every resource at its
disposal to accomplish it. War has been developed to the point where it is no
longer a means of settling disputes for the benefit of one of a combination of
contestants it is now a scientific marvel that if allowed to continue to exist
will shortly destroy the thing that has produced it, man's industrial, techno
logical and social civilization.
These are words of significance, spoken by the leaders of military science.
What are we doing to prevent the fulfillment of their prophecies? Resting in
torpor, refusing either to believe or to try to form other conclusions on a
basis of fact. No one has tried to show that anything else will come about,
presumably because there is no evidence of it.
The Filibuster that Blocked the League
Many of us think of the League of Nations of 1919 as a piece of politics
only. It was a sincere effort on the part of able and sinecre men to bring
about an end of war. It was botched by politicians and imperialists so that
it became something that we could take no part in. When it was revised to
the point where we could and would have entered it a group of senators,
unable to prevent its acceptance by vote, did it by parliamentary trickery, as
subversive to public interest as any filibuster ever was and always will be.
The Workable Plan
During the time that the League of Nations has been officially dead in the
United States there has been no public denial of the necessity of a similar
scheme, without its defects and with its principal feature's. The prize offered
by Mr. Bok was for a plan for the consummation of world peace that would be
most practical for the United States to enter; in other words, one which the
United States might enter without peril to herself and with profit.
Such a plan has been chosen, and it complies with the requirements. It
holds no dangers for us, and it does offer promise of helping to bring about
world peace.
Is the Plan Futile? Is It Dangerous?
It has been criticized from two angles; it has been said that it is so
lacking in forse as to be futile, and that it is intended to draw us into the
League of Nations, with all of its evils and dangers. The second objection is
most easily answered. The plan approved by the jury on the Bok Peace
Award specifically provides that the United States shall not be bound by
Article X or XVI, that we shall not enter the League, and that the Monroe
Doctrine shall be safe-guarded. It also provides that we shall not be com
pelled in any action, not even that of submitting our quarrels to the World
Court, though without any fear we have entered previous to this time into
compulsory arbitration agreements with thirty-one nations. There are no
dangers in such a plan.
The first objection is of even less force; it is a negation of every principle
of humanitarianism.
A Move Towards the Goal
War is a vicious circle which civilization has developed, and all agree
that escape is necessary—vital. We know that there is only one way to
accomplish this, by a tremendous effort. We know that this cannot be done
in a moment or in a single trial. We recognize that this Bok Peace Plan if
carried out will be some movement in the right direction. Can we say that
any such move is futile if it brings us nearer a so much desired goal?
Opinions may differ as to the extent of that movement, but it is certain
that it exists. If it does it is worth working for.
If It's Going to Be Done, We Must Do It
The Bok Peace Plan is now being submitted for public approval. We can
certainly agree that it has in it no inherent dangers and that it has potenti
alities of good. The business of preventing further wars is not a matter of
pure altruism, as any veteran of the last war can testify: it is a piece of most
important selfishness. The students of Stanford should be interested in
seeing it become as potent as is possible. That can be brought about by each
man reading the plan when submitted to him and turning in his vote. We
may pray to God to protect us, but we can be fairly sure from experience
that if men are to be saved that men must do the saving. —W. L. S.

presumably because there is no evidence of it.
The Filibuster that Blocked the League
Many of us think of the League of Nations of 1919 as a piece of politics
only. It was a sincere effort on the part of able and sinecre men to bring
about an end of war. It was botched by politicians and imperialists so that
it became something that we could take no part in. When it was revised to
the point where we could and would have entered it a group of senators,
unable to prevent its acceptance by vote, did it by parliamentary trickery, as
subversive to public interest as any filibuster ever was and always will be.
The Workable Plan
During the time that the League of Nations has been officially dead in the
United States there has been no public denial of the necessity of a similar
scheme, without its defects and with its principal feature's. The prize offered
by Mr. Bok was for a plan for the consummation of world peace that would be
most practical for the United States to enter; in other words, one which the
United States might enter without peril to herself and with profit.
Such a plan has been chosen, and it complies with the requirements. It
holds no dangers for us, and it does offer promise of helping to bring about
world peace.
Is the Plan Futile? Is It Dangerous?
It has been criticized from two angles; it has been said that it is so
lacking in forse as to be futile, and that it is intended to draw us into the
League of Nations, with all of its evils and dangers. The second objection is
most easily answered. The plan approved by the jury on the Bok Peace
Award specifically provides that the United States shall not be bound by
Article X or XVI, that we shall not enter the League, and that the Monroe
Doctrine shall be safe-guarded. It also provides that we shall not be com
pelled in any action, not even that of submitting our quarrels to the World
Court, though without any fear we have entered previous to this time into
compulsory arbitration agreements with thirty-one nations. There are no
dangers in such a plan.
The first objection is of even less force; it is a negation of every principle
of humanitarianism.
A Move Towards the Goal
War is a vicious circle which civilization has developed, and all agree
that escape is necessary—vital. We know that there is only one way to
accomplish this, by a tremendous effort. We know that this cannot be done
in a moment or in a single trial. We recognize that this Bok Peace Plan if
carried out will be some movement in the right direction. Can we say that
any such move is futile if it brings us nearer a so much desired goal?
Opinions may differ as to the extent of that movement, but it is certain
that it exists. If it does it is worth working for.
If It's Going to Be Done, We Must Do It
The Bok Peace Plan is now being submitted for public approval. We can
certainly agree that it has in it no inherent dangers and that it has potenti
alities of good. The business of preventing further wars is not a matter of
pure altruism, as any veteran of the last war can testify: it is a piece of most
important selfishness. The students of Stanford should be interested in
seeing it become as potent as is possible. That can be brought about by each
man reading the plan when submitted to him and turning in his vote. We
may pray to God to protect us, but we can be fairly sure from experience
that if men are to be saved that men must do the saving. —W. L. S.
