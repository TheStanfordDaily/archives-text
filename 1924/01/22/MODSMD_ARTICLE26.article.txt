### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Arthur Havers and Gene Sarazen will compete for the championship of the
universe this week-end, playing thirty-six holes in San Francisco and thirty-six
in Los Angeles. The golfing world is "all liet up" over this match between
the Open champion of England and the Professional and Ex-Open champion
of the United States.
Havers beat Hagen in the British Open last year by one stroke. His real
winning stroke was a long spoon shot through a heavy cross wind which
stopped a few feet from the cup at the seventeenth green. He needed a three
there to keep in front of Hagen and he got it. Sarazen, it will be remembered,
competed in the British Open and failed even to qualify . Gene, however, has
a habit of coming through in big matches in this country. He is accustomed
to taking men into camp who spell their last names with a capital H. Artist
that he is, he won't play to let Art win for art's sake.
