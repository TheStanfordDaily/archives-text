# AVERAGE OF THREE CARS PER MINUTE PASS PALM DRIVE
## 
### 
Recent investigations reveal that
three cars a minute on an average
pass the entrance to Palm Drive dur
ing the daylight hours. From nightfall
until midnight the average traffic
score is a little less than two cars
each minute.
The number of passengers is a frac
tion over two for each car. Before
the road divides in front of the Ad
ministration building, however, the
passenger figure is increased to an
average of almost two and a half to
each vehicle.
Results from the attempt to com
pute the price ranges of cars driven
by the college community were incon
clusive. The investigators had so much
trouble in estimating the value of stu
dent-owned cars, that the project was
finally abandoned.
Estimates ranging from several
thousands to five and ten dollars were
scored. On one car the judges agreed
that minus twenty-five was the most
accurate expression of the machine's
appearance. In this respect the cam
pus may be said to show no difference
from any other group.
