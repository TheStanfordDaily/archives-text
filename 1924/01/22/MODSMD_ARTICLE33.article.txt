# PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY TO CALL WORLD SESSION
## 
### 
At the annual meeting of the Amer
ican Philosophical Association it was
proposed to call a World's Congress
on Philosophy in the near future. The
last one was held just before the
opening of the European War, for
the Congress scheduled for July, 1915,
in London, was abandoned. It was
suggested at the meeting that the next
Congress be appointed for 1926 at
Philadelphia during the declaration of
the Sesqui-Centennial of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence.

James N. Gamble, 87, has an
nounced that he will build a football
stadium for the University of Cin
cinnati as a memorial to his late
grandson, James Gamble Nippert, the
first University of Cincinnati student
to die of a football injury.
