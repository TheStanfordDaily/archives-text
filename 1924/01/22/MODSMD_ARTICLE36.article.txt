# TWELVE-WHEEL MACHINE CROSSES SAHARA DESERT
## 
### 
For the first time in history the
great sand dunes of the Sahara desert
have been crossed by an automobile,
and a trip hitherto impracticable ex
cept by a camel caravan which took
from ten to twelve days, can now he
made by auto in two days.
A specially-designed machine with
six pairs of wheels was used for the
trip. The eight rear wheels receive the
propelling power from an ordinary ten
horsepower engine. Six, besides the
chauffeur, is the carrying capacity of
the car. When fully loaded it weighs
about three tons.
The new roadway thus opened up
lies between Southern Algeria and
Southern Tunis and passes through
an expanse of desert land 186 miles
wide including 62 miles of the worst

sand dunes of the whole desert. The
journey can now be made without en
countering any grave dangers. There
are, nevertheless, many difficulties.
Miles of sand hills must be ascended
and descended at angles varying from
30 to 35 degrees, sometimes even as
great as from 40 to 45.
The Sahara has been crossed before
from north to south, from Touggourt
to Timbuctoo, but this was by means
of caterpillar-wheel machines, and the
road used ran, except for a very short
distance, across the hard ground of
which the greater part of the North
African desert consists. When the
caterpillar machines attempted the
route east from Touggourt, they
failed, although they were finally able
to reach El-Oued by means of outside
aid, digging and haulage.
