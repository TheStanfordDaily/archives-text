# CAMPUS VOTE FAVORS BOK PEACE PLAN
## 
### 
Preliminary returns from the cam
pus vote on the Bok prize peace plan
received this morning from the bal
loting by living groups last evening,
show a total of 151 for the plan and
23 against.
According to Professor J. H. Stuart,
of the political science department,
who is in charge of the balloting at
Stanford, a lively interest has been
displayed by students. Early indica
tions are that nearly every student
will vote on the plan. In every case
the plan was read before the living
groups previous to the voting.
This morning's results show a vote
of 67 for and 11 against by the mem
bers of fraternities, 32 for and 2
against by sororities; and 52 for to
10 against in one of the men's dormi
tories.
The Â£reat majority of the student
vote will be received today and to
morrow morning, Professor Stuart
states. The faculty vote cannot be
received until tomorrow, as the bal
lots were mailed to their homes.
A vote of the freshman class was
taken this morning in class periods,
but had not been tabulated at noon
today. The first-year students have
devoted a full week to the discussion
of this plan as a part of their work
in the Citizenship courses.
