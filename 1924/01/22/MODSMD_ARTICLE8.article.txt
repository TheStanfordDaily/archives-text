# BABES SCHEDULED TO MEET STRONG TEAMS THIS WEEK
## 
### Wallace Knox 
Some stiff competition has been se
• cured this week for the undefeated
! Stanford freshman quintet. Tomorrow
| at 8 in the pavilion the yearlings will
' tangle with the strong San Jose Teach
i ers' college team. As a preliminary
i to the varsity-U. S. C. game Saturday
! night the freshmen will try to down
| the Fresno State Teachers' college ag
i gregation.
These teams are considered to he
i stronger than any the Babes have met
|so far this year. Accordingly, this week
can be called an ante-climax to the Cali
i fornia freshman series. If Coach
| "Husky" Hunt's men manage to come
1 out on top in both contests they should
i have clear sailing until the Bear Cubs
j enter the scene.
Oakland Game Close.
The yearlings have had little diffi
! culty in downing all comers. Oakland
! Tech was the only opponent that was
i able to stop the Babe offense. The
, score of this game was 10 to 7. How
| ever, the Babes were having an off
I night, and it is safe to say that if the
' two teams were to meet apain the
j frcslnnan score would be considerably
: larger than that of the prep team.
At this time it is impossible to esti
i mate the strength of the 1927 five. So
j far it has never had to expend all of
j of its strength to defeat an opponent.
! With the exception of the Oakland
, game, the Babes have had a top-heavy
; score at the end of the half, and as a
| result were able to take things easy
, during the latter half.
