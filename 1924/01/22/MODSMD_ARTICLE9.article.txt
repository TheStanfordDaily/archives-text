### Douglas Meservey 
Close scores marked the opening
day's play of Round 3 in the intra
mural basketball tournament. Beta
Theta Pi, Delta Chi, El Tigre, and the
Japanese Club emerged victors from
hard-fought games while Phi Kappa
Sigma defaulted to Los Arcos.
Delta Chi Wins Slow Game
Delta Chi won over Alpha Kappa
Lambda, 8 to 4, in a close but rather
slow contest. Both fives attempted
teamwork to carry the ball down, the
floor but were not accurate in their
passes, and the ball changed hands
frequently. The half ended 4 to 2 with
Delta Chi in the lead.
Hood began the scoring of the sec
ond period by two shots under the
goal for Delta Chi. More fight was
shown by both fives during this
period but neither could find the bas
ket and the game ended 8 to 4, Delta
Chi still on the large end of the count.
El Tigre Wins
The Phi Gamma Delta-El Tigre con
test was started at a fast pace by the
Fijis but they had 110 eye for the
basket and lost, 8 to 0.
Both quintets made many tries for
the goal but it was found for only two
free throws and a field goal by El
Tigre, and the half ended 4 to 0 in
their favor.
An increase in fight was shown by
the Fijis to begin the second period
but they continued to miss many
chances to score. El Tigre, however,
displayed a good passing game and
managed to account for four addition
al points, winning 8 to 0.
Taylor was high point man for El
Tigre with three points to his credit
while Butterfield scored the only field
goal of the second period for the club
men.
Fol Phi Gamma Delta, Muir, Dills,
aud Lombard showed up well.
Betas Win Again
Beta Theta Pi won its third game
of the tournament over Encina, first
floor, 16 to 8. Fight and speed were
lacking in both fives in the first half
and long shots were attempted. When
teamwork was tried the ball was soon
lost to the other quintet. After a goal
by Anawalt, the score at half time
stood 6 to 4 with the hallmen leading.
The Betas brought a little fight
back with them to begin the second
period and Tibbe began the scoring
with a field goal, following with three
more during the half. They used a
good five-man defense, allowing only
two more points to the Encina men.
Tibbe led the scoring for Beta
Theta Pi, accounting for twelve
points. Sproul played a fast game at
guard and scored two points, as did
Alabaster at forward.
Anawalt was high point man for the
hall team, with four points, also show
ing up well on defense. Eicher and
Stevenson played good games on de
fense and offense, accounting for one
goal apiece.
For the first time during the tourna
ment, the fast Japanese Club was held
to a close score, winning from Se
quoia I, 12 to 4.
Both fives put. a five-man defense
into play the second period, which
showed both offensives considerably.
Two long shots, however, by the Japa
nese, gave them four additional points
while only two points were accounted
for by Sequoia.
Phi Kappa Sigma defaulted to Los
Arcos.
