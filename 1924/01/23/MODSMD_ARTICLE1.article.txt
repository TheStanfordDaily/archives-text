organization of the four divisions in
the United States and of the Asso

Accuracy Important
The Associated Press is the biggest
and most completely organized news
agency in the United States. Every
news source is carefully covered by
its correspondents. Accuracy is an im
portant element in the news service,
which it furnishes to member papers.
These members are elected to the or
ganization and all members share the
expenses incurred as it is a mutual
or co-operative, non-profit corporation.
All news which member papers get
is available to the Associated Press,
which disseminates it by wire to all
other members. In fact, the organiza- j
tion is a combine for routine stories j
by which expense in duplicating nevjs
is eliminated.
