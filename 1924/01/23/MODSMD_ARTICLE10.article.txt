# ANTICIPATE AUTHOR OF MASQUERS' PLAY AS FUTURE CLASSIC
## 
### 
Arnold Bennett, the author of "Mile
stones," which will be produced by
the Masquers Club, has been charac
terized as "The Great Writer of To
day, and the Classic of Tomorrow."
He passed his early years in Burs
lem, England, one of a group of vil
lages known as the Pottery Towns.
Brought up in this unchanging indus
trial environment, he utilized the ma
terials obtained from observation of
the pottery industry in writing sev
eral books under the collective name
of "The Five Towns."
He began studying law in London in
his early twenties, but he soon aban
doned this for the career of journal
ism. In successive stages he became
editor, novelist, playwright, and with
the success of his works, he was soon
an international celebrity.
The heights which he attained were
reached, not by accident, but by care
ful planning of his time. This he ex
emplifies in a short work, "How to
Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day,"
which achieved great popularity.
The best known of his novels is
probably "Old Wives' Tale" which
brought instant recognition of his
ability.
Before attempting to write plays,
he made a study of current drama.
This he published under the name of
"What the Public Wants."
Apparently his surmises were well
drawn for in "Milestones" he has
made a play which, while it may not
last forever, has proved a success for
a decade.
