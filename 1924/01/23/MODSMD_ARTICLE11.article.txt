# STANFORD, CALIFORNIA IN FORENSIC CLASH
## Decision To Be Made By Audience; Topic, Syndicalism Law 
### 
California and Stanford varsity de
bating teams will meet tomorrow
night in the Little Theater at 8 o'clock.
"Resolved: That, the California Crim
inal Syndicalism Law should be re
pealed" will be the subject of the de
bate.
A ballot will be taken from among
the audience to decide the winning
team.
Cardinal Team Strong
Stanley Weigel and Thomas Bailey
will uphold Stanford's side of the
argument. Weigel is a sophomore and
this will be his first appearance as a
Stanford debater. Bailey, a senior, was
on the team that won at Oregon last
year and was also on the Joffre team
I debating against California.
Instead of placing the power of de*
! ciding the contest in the hands of
J three judges, as has been the custom
[ in the past, the system of an audience
j decision will be given its first try at
! at Stanford.
At the conclusion of the main argu
! monls and rebuttals on both sides,
ballots will be passed out by the
ushers to the members of the audi
ence. Every one present will be al- i
. lowod to vote on the question, as he
sees it.
While the votes are being counted, :

discussion on the syndicalism laws
of the state will be conducted from
the floor by any who wish added in
formation on the subject. The mem
bers of the contesting teams will an
swer all questions put to them by the
audience.
Audience to Decide Verdict
This system of voting leaves the
entire verdict to the discretion and
fairness of the audience and is a fur
ther application of the honor system.
Prejudice and partiality should have
no sway, and have not in those places
where the system has already been
tried, according to those favoring the
idea.
California used this method in a de
bate last year at Berkeley with Brit
ish Columbia College. The debate was
closely contested and the 1200 persons
who voted gave the verdict to the
Canadians by 200 votes.
The debate tomorrow is part of a
triangular contest with California and
U. S. C. The Stanford team will go
south to debate with tlie southern op
ponents on Tuesday. In the meantime
California and U. S. C. will meet at
Berkeley for the third contest. The
Stanford varsity will have the nega
tive of the question in the south.
