# MUSICAL ANCESTORS ARE COMPARED WITH MODERNS IN CONCERT
## 
### Beatrice Flesher 
Familiar selections from the mod
ern work of Cesar Franck and Louis
iVierne were contrasted with romantic
Wagnerian compositions and with
Franz Schubert's nineteenth century
music, in a program which combined
organ, 'cello, and soprano voice in
| Memorial Church last night.
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, Mrs. Lester Cowger, soprano, and
Malcolm Davison, 'cellist, were the
artists.
Trio Work Pleasing
The two pieces in which all mem
bers of the trio took part were the
song, "Come Unto Me," by Alessandro
Scarlatti, and Franz Schubert's "Ave
Maria." In these, the harmonious com
j bination of organ accompaniment and
'cello obligato formed an orchestral
background for the smooth melody of
Mrs. Cowger's lyric soprano.
Mrs. Cowger's clear enunciation
j blended with the song-like quality of
the 'cello and combined with the or
gan to make Scarlatti's composition
lovely, although it could not be com
\ pared to the fine work of the trio on
i the wel-known "Ave Maria." The lat
; ter was most appealing, when the rich
background of the organ music was
J followed by the soprano, with the
I tones of the 'cello heard at intervals.
Chorale Brilliantly Played
The first number on the program,
Cesar Franck's "Chorale in A Minor,"
was brilliantly played by Mr. Allen,
and brought out the grandeur of the
composition. Before the fine climax
at the end of the piece, the full, vo
luminous minor strain makes a strik
ing contrast with the single, even
melody of the theme.
Mr. Allen's rendition of Louis
Vierne's "Lied" from the "Twenty-
Four Pieces in Free Style" delighted
with its repetitions of the melody of
the theme. Vierne's Allegro from the
First Symphony was like a joyous
scherzo, with a canon for the middle
section, unlike the consistent follow
ing of the melody in his other compo
sition.
"Mastersingers" Dramatic
A selection of Wagnerian pieces, the
last of which was the dramatic "March
of the Mastersingers" concluded the
program. "The Mastersingers" devel
ops a series of climaxes through which
the march strain carries the melody
in an appealing and forceful way.
Wagner's "Introduction to the Third
Act," also from "Die Meistersingers,"
changes to a dreamy, quiet, more seri
ous theme.

| Memorial Church last night.
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, Mrs. Lester Cowger, soprano, and
Malcolm Davison, 'cellist, were the
artists.
Trio Work Pleasing
The two pieces in which all mem
bers of the trio took part were the
song, "Come Unto Me," by Alessandro
Scarlatti, and Franz Schubert's "Ave
Maria." In these, the harmonious com
j bination of organ accompaniment and
'cello obligato formed an orchestral
background for the smooth melody of
Mrs. Cowger's lyric soprano.
Mrs. Cowger's clear enunciation
j blended with the song-like quality of
the 'cello and combined with the or
gan to make Scarlatti's composition
lovely, although it could not be com
\ pared to the fine work of the trio on
i the wel-known "Ave Maria." The lat
; ter was most appealing, when the rich
background of the organ music was
J followed by the soprano, with the
I tones of the 'cello heard at intervals.
Chorale Brilliantly Played
The first number on the program,
Cesar Franck's "Chorale in A Minor,"
was brilliantly played by Mr. Allen,
and brought out the grandeur of the
composition. Before the fine climax
at the end of the piece, the full, vo
luminous minor strain makes a strik
ing contrast with the single, even
melody of the theme.
Mr. Allen's rendition of Louis
Vierne's "Lied" from the "Twenty-
Four Pieces in Free Style" delighted
with its repetitions of the melody of
the theme. Vierne's Allegro from the
First Symphony was like a joyous
scherzo, with a canon for the middle
section, unlike the consistent follow
ing of the melody in his other compo
sition.
"Mastersingers" Dramatic
A selection of Wagnerian pieces, the
last of which was the dramatic "March
of the Mastersingers" concluded the
program. "The Mastersingers" devel
ops a series of climaxes through which
the march strain carries the melody
in an appealing and forceful way.
Wagner's "Introduction to the Third
Act," also from "Die Meistersingers,"
changes to a dreamy, quiet, more seri
ous theme.
Familiar selections from the mod
ern work of Cesar Franck and Louis
iVierne were contrasted with romantic
Wagnerian compositions and with
Franz Schubert's nineteenth century
music, in a program which combined
organ, 'cello, and soprano voice in
