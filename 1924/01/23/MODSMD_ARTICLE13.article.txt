# MUSICAL ANCESTORS ARE COMPARED WITH MODERNS IN CONCERT

Familiar selections from the mod

iVierne were contrasted with romantic
Wagnerian compositions and with
Franz Schubert's nineteenth century
music, in a program which combined
organ, 'cello, and soprano voice in
| Memorial Church last night.
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, Mrs. Lester Cowger, soprano, and
Malcolm Davison, 'cellist, were the
artists.
Trio Work Pleasing
The two pieces in which all mem
bers of the trio took part were the
song, "Come Unto Me," by Alessandro
Scarlatti, and Franz Schubert's "Ave
Maria." In these, the harmonious com
j bination of organ accompaniment and
'cello obligato formed an orchestral
background for the smooth melody of
Mrs. Cowger's lyric soprano.
Mrs. Cowger's clear enunciation
j blended with the song-like quality of
the 'cello and combined with the or
gan to make Scarlatti's composition
lovely, although it could not be com
\ pared to the fine work of the trio on
i the wel-known "Ave Maria." The lat
; ter was most appealing, when the rich
background of the organ music was
J followed by the soprano, with the
I tones of the 'cello heard at intervals.
Chorale Brilliantly Played

Cesar Franck's "Chorale in A Minor,"
was brilliantly played by Mr. Allen,
