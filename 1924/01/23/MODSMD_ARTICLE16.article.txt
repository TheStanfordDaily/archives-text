# CARDINALS WILL BATTLE TROJANS FRIDAY, SATURDAY
## U. S. C. More Formidable After Winning Contest From California 
### David Meiklejohn 
U. S. C., doggedly determined to
blot out a four-game defeat at the
hands of the Cardinal five last year,
will bring her quintet to the Stanford
campus to open the Conference sche
dule for the Cards next Friday and
Saturday.
Trojan supporters are more than
optimistic after the showing made by
U. S. C. in the California series last
week in which the southern aggrega
tion won the first game, 26 to 25, and
lost the second contest, 28 to 22.
Trojans Strong
Which goes to prove that U. S. C.
can not be underrated; for they have
one of the strongest teams on the
Coast.
Judging from reports, U. S. C.is
still using the same tactics employed
last year, a strong driving offensive
game, resembling more a free-for-all
than a basketball contest. There is
some excuse for the Trojan methods,
employed as they were against the
Bears in the first game. U. S. C. knew
what sort of an aggregation she had
to buck and realized that in pure fight,
alone was there any opportunity to
swell the Trojan score and keep pace
with the opposition.
Change Tactics
In the second game the southern
quintet relied more on a close fan-like
defense formation, forcing California
to make long tries at the goal. Evi
dently the methods .employed in the
first game were more to its advantage;
for it was forced to give way before
the superior luck of the Bruins.
Yowls of disgust are coming from
nowhere in particular because Stan
ford was not better able to penetrate
the Santa Clara defense last Satur
day. It wasn't that the Stanford t째am
was strong; the Santa Clara team was
weak, and having a formidable de
fense it preferred to keep the score
lower rather than use offensive tactics
and increase its own total. At no
point in the game were the Mission
ites leading.
It was to Stanford's advantage to
allow the Friar defense to park under
the Stanford goal and watch the ball
dribble back and forth between the
Card players, with no attempt to
break in and force Stanford to pass
in order to get within scoring distance.

Dr. Taylor on Trip
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, head of the
Stanford Food Research Institute, will
return to the campus next Monday after
a week's vacation trip through north
ern California. He is accompanied by
his son, Morris Taylor.

Which goes to prove that U. S. C.
can not be underrated; for they have
one of the strongest teams on the
Coast.
Judging from reports, U. S. C.is
still using the same tactics employed
last year, a strong driving offensive
game, resembling more a free-for-all
than a basketball contest. There is
some excuse for the Trojan methods,
employed as they were against the
Bears in the first game. U. S. C. knew
what sort of an aggregation she had
to buck and realized that in pure fight,
alone was there any opportunity to
swell the Trojan score and keep pace
with the opposition.
Change Tactics
In the second game the southern
quintet relied more on a close fan-like
defense formation, forcing California
to make long tries at the goal. Evi
dently the methods .employed in the
first game were more to its advantage;
for it was forced to give way before
the superior luck of the Bruins.
Yowls of disgust are coming from
nowhere in particular because Stan
ford was not better able to penetrate
the Santa Clara defense last Satur
day. It wasn't that the Stanford t째am
was strong; the Santa Clara team was
weak, and having a formidable de
fense it preferred to keep the score
lower rather than use offensive tactics
and increase its own total. At no
point in the game were the Mission
ites leading.
It was to Stanford's advantage to
allow the Friar defense to park under
the Stanford goal and watch the ball
dribble back and forth between the
Card players, with no attempt to
break in and force Stanford to pass
in order to get within scoring distance.
