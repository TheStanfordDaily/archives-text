half and missed often. The Phi Psis,
however, displayed a fast offense and
were successful in finding the basket
for 16 points in the first half. Only
three were accounted for by the fresh
men.
A number of substitutions were
made in the second period by Phi Psi,
slowing the pace to some extent. The
Encina five worked better against the
weakened Phi Psi defense and scored
six points.
Wittenburg and Knox showed up
well for the winners while Freeman
and Frazier played a good game for
Encina.
El Campo Has Little Trouble
El Campo had little trouble in de
feating Theta Delta Chi, 9 to 4. The
clubmen exhibited better teamwork
and carried the ball into their oppon
ents' territory often.
Hobro and Pearce were responsible
for most of the El Campo points and
showed up well on offense.
Haley and Clark each scored two
points for the Theta Delts.
