to begin the second period but their
lead of one point was not overcome
by El Capitan. Four additional points
were scored by both and the game
ended 11 to 10.

cina and led the scoring with six
points. Smythe also worked well on
offense, as did Siemons at guard.

Capitan with four points, Marsh fol
lowing with two.
