# HELLO, CLIFF

### 
Cliff was back 011 the farm today. His collection of semi-pro all-stars,
bush-league champs, and dark horses broke open the 1924 football season
this afternoon, and Cliff, the perennial second baseman, broke loose with
his ever-ready line of baseball banter. As usual, several belts were burst
in the mirth.
Back when Dr. Jordan used to pitch a couple of innings for the varsity,
Cliff Ireland sauntered down the peninsula and took 011 the Cardinals in
a combined baseball and word battle. Between prancing around the
second sack and leading a one-man peerade up and down the coaching line,
Cliff kept up a rattle of rapid-fire remarks calculated to cause compound
fracture of the funny-bone.
Cliff has been down every year since then. Always new, always ready
for a laugh or a two base hit, Ireland and his "line" are as inseparable as a
pair of pants, and as much a part of Stanford baseball as the water bucket.
