# TRYOUTS WILL MEET TODAY
## 
### 
Spectator today announces adoption of the tryoutee system in selection
of its editorial staff. Having tried choosing the staff by a joint publica
tion board of two societies, and finding plenty with several qualifications
but those of merit and experience, the board has finally authorized the
editor to install a tryoutee system without reference to membership in the
two societies which control' the destinies—but not the policies—of
Spectator.
Advantages of this action are double: first, of course, the undeniable
benefit to the magazine (for proof, see the Quad or Daily Palo Alto sys
tems in action) ; second, the benefit to underclass students in throwing
open another worthwhile activity for competitive participation.

The promptness with which two honor societies and one fraternity were
summoned before the Men's Council for damage to student body rules
shows that student government is still one jump ahead of faculty action in
the suppression of those who consider themselves above regulation. .
