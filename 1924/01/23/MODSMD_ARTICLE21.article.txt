# STANFORD TEN YEARS AGO

January 7 —Boating on the lake has
begun. Rains during the holiday vaca
tion caused the water level of Lagunita
to rise to a higher point than was
reached at any time last year. The
water now stands within a few feet
of the top of the large rock mound in
the center of the lake. Private boats
will appear with the return of pleas
ant weather, while rowing sculls for
the crew squad will be taken to the
boathouse soon.

"Resolved, That the Executive de

Changing the place of the hammer
throw cage, and the partitioning off of
an individual rubbing room in the
training house for the special use of
Trainer Maloney, are the most im
portant changes which have been
made at Stanford over the vacation.
In addition to these, the cinder path

is being partially resurfaced to put it
in good shape for the beginning of
track practice next week.

On tour of the Northwest, the Glee
Club concerts were the subject of
much newspaper comment. A clipping
from the Medford (Oregon) Sun,
where the first concert was given, fol
lows: "Even the college glee clubs are
cabaretized nowadays. The old-style
concert has given place to stunt men,
fraternity scenes, rouge and calcium
effects, illustrated songs, and all that
sort of thing."

January 12—"The College Prince"
has been chosen as the 1915 Junior
opera. With this work, a new coach,
William F. Rochester, of the American
School of Opera, will be introduced to
Stanford.

Action of unusual importance to the
University and to women who plan to
register at Stanford in the future, was
taken by the Academic Council, when
revised regulations governing the ad
mission of women were adopted. The
changes, in brief, mean the placing
of the "transfer" on the plane of wo
men entering college for the first time,
and the limiting of the privilege of
registering without formal application
to graduate students of institutions of
recognized standing.
