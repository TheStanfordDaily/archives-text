DAYS IN THE LIVES OF GREAT MEN
Alonzo awakes. Any man can awake. It takes a fool to get up. Alonzo
is nobody's fool. Alonzo goes back to sleep.
Alonzo awakes for the second time. This time he decides that
every man is a fool on occasions. Besides, he has an eight
o'clock. Alonzo gets up, washes his face without soap; brushes
his teeth without tooth-paste; and combs his hair without looking.
He eats without chewing and goes blithely to an ex in his morning
class without knowing what it is all about.
On his way he smokes a cigarette. Flunks his ex and blames it on the
smoke. Smokes another cigarette between classes. Bluffs the prof in his
nine o'clock. Gets by with it. Feels so good he smokes another cigarette and
cuts his next two classes.
Spends rest of morning talking to cute co-ed. She yawns.
"Tired?" asks Alonzo, always there with the right thing to say.
"Oh, no," she repartees back, "I'm just opening my mouth wide
enough to swallow your line."
Alonzo decides you can bluff profs but you're wasting time when you try
to bluff a co-ed. Moves on to the next stop. Which is lunch. Follows advice
about masticating food carefully and eats big meal in eight minutes.
Our hero plays bridge all afternoon. Wins thirty cents. Buys toothpaste
and soap. Hates to do it but his roommate is out.
Sees educational movie entitled "Three Weeks of Love."
Learns some new stuff. Gets a late date with a co-ed. Freshman,
this time. Uecides he didn't learn the new stuff as Avell as he
thought he d.id.
Goes to room. Washes his face with soap, brushes his teeth with tooth
paste, and looks at his tired face in the mirror with approval.
Tells his roommate what a hard day he has had. Goes to bed.
Alonzo sleeps. —B.A.

The Off-Campus Correspondent Gets Busy Again:
SCANDAL ROCKS UNIVERSITY!
SENATE TO INVESTIGATE CHARGES!
(By Our Star Reporter)
Special Report from Stanford Campus—l have found a scandal here equalling
in magnitude the fake "doctor mill" which operates in San Francisco. You
will remember that the court was told there that $200 "bought" a diploma.
Well, would you believe it, I have unearthed a similar scandal down here,
i I have it on reliable authority that students "buy" their diplomas here. One
I student, who wishes his name to be kept secret for obvious reasons (you see,
it is spelled "l-v-a-n-i-t-c-h") revealed to me that medical students pay from
$65 to $95 per quarter before they are allowed to receive their diplomas.
Just think of it!
I also have what practically amounts to a written confession from one of
the professors that if a student does not pay his tuition for six consecutive
quarters, he is not allowed to g<et his diploma!
The campus is in an uproar over something. Perhaps it is this.
This is nearly as great as the Bookstore Coupon scandal of a year ago when
; several students were reputed to have amassed huge private fortunes by
fraudulently saving the coupons, which of course they were not supposed tg do
at all. The Bookstore nearly went broke.
I shall wire you further details as soon as I can think any up.
