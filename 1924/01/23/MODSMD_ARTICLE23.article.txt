# An Unprotected Future
## ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
### 
A meeting was held in the Little Theater last week at which the Bok
Peace Plan was discussed. The discussion was of one type, mainly analytical.
What each of the impromptu speakers did was to ask whether the plan would
do such and such things, whether it would be accepted by everybody, whether
or not it was an approximately perfect document. The arguments were
academic. *
The subject is not an academic one. are dealing with a practical
problem of the present, one which does not admit of unlimited delay. We
have no precedents to guide us, but are forced by circumstances to go forward.
What we are working for is not immediate perfection, but immediate progress.
The Bok Peace Plan is our first move, probably not adequate, certainly not
perfect, but in the right direction.
The cost of another great war would be too great for civilization to bear.
Looking only at the results of the last, not peering into the ghastly vistas of
an unprotected future, we can say that. War must not come again. That
thought should guide us, force us into action to prevent it. â€”W. L. S.
