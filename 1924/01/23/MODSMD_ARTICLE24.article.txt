# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Dear Sir:
Maybe the Mechanical Engineering
Society and the Glee Club think they
can break University regulations and
get away with it just because they
are "honor societies."
At least, that is what they are braz
enly doing when they try this public
initiation stuff that they have been
putting* on the last few days. They
know quite well that it is against Uni
versity regulations, but they evidently
want to show us who are "on the out
side" that regulations are made for
everybody but honor society mem
bers.
Now I don't want these societies to
think that just because I am not a
member of any society that it is
"sour grapes" with me. I wouldn't
join the Glee Club if I was paid for it,
and from the way the M. E. Society
dolls its neophytes up, they must be
a motley crew to say the least.
But the point I am making is that
these honor societies such as the
above-mentioned have gone far enough
to show us "common people" how good
they are. Stanford, thank the Lord,
isn't made up exclusively of snobs
who pride themselves on being able
to bust the regulations and get away
with it.
The only kind of public initiations
for such groups that I can see the
use of is where they drown the neo
phytes.
Yours for sanity and common-sense.
