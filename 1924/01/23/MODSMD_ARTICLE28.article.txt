# The 						Hot Stove League-A Distinguished Visitor Drops In
## 
### 
Casey Stengel, in answer to a written invitation, dropped in on a meeting
of the Hot Stove league the other day and was presented with a large gold
watch by the old-timers. All of them thought he had been badly treated by
McGraw when he was sold to Boston. There was quite an argument as to
which one of the many who claimed to be the original subject of Ernest
Thayer's poem, "Casey at the Bat," should make the presentation speech.
Michael J. Kelly claimed the honor, but he was ruled out because he only had
a moustache. E. Robinson Casey, who said he played third for Detroit and
though the incident occurred in Minneapolis in 1885, was eliminated when it
was proved that Detroit had no third baseman named Casey, nor any games
with Minneapolis in 1885.
Finally K. C. Casey, who showed a birth certificate from Mudville, Ohio,
was elected, and he dropped the new turnip into Casey's outstretched palm
with these choice words, "Casey, me namesake, you have more than atoned
for my striking out with the bases full long, long ago. Your two homers have
won you more everlasting fame than Homer's 'Iliad' and Homer's 'Odyssey.'
Take this, wind it up, and you'll never get run down between the bases."
Mr. Stengel, who wore the names of all the National League clubs he had
been attached to in his career, said thanks, and hoped that he'd get three
homers against the Giants in the next World's Series. A. Luque sent flowers
(poison ivy).
