# DR. JORDAN TO TALK ON MODERN MEDICINE
## 
### 
"Immunity in Medicine" is the sub
ject of Dr. Jordan's weekly conference
tomorrow evening at his home at 7:30
o'clock. He will discuss the founda
tion of modern medicine.
"Cheerful-mindedness helps toward
a sound body," says Dr. Jordan. Mod
ern medicine treats of various classi
fications of human ailments. The first
of these are diseases of all kinds pro
duced by bacteria and parasitic pro
tozoa.
There are disorders caused by men
tal worries or lack of co-ordination,
cured by some mental means. Condi
tions of degeneration are brought on
by the use of drugs and liquors.
There are failures of organs and
failures of mind. This last, Dr. Jordan
says, is known familiarly as tempera
mentalism which he defines as that
state in which animal tendencies are
allowed to run wild without the direc
tion of a higher quality of wisdom.
