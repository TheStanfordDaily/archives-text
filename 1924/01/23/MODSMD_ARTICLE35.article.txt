# Pavilion Will Be Future Residence Of Stanford Band
## 
### 
The wanderings of the Band are at
an end â€”temporarily, at least.
The entrance room of the pavilion
has been obtained as a place for prac
ticing, and Encina freshmen tiring
of study in the late afternoon, may
now open their windows and partake
of the harmony.
The Band's troubles started when
it was found necessary to use as a
classroom the place in the Engineer
ing building where the Band has
practiced for fifteen years. Having
used the same room for so long, it
was not accustomed to changing its
residence, and great difficulty has
been found in locating anything suit
able.
The Zoology building was tried, but
the echo from the vaulted roof proved
overpowering. In the extremity, erect
ing a tent in the field near the Library
was suggested, but the problem is at
last solved.
Unless something occurs to inter
fere, the Band will in the future hold
forth in the pavilion.
