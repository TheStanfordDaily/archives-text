# CAMPUS VOTE SHOWS STUDENTS IN FAVOR OF BOK PEACE PLAN
## 
### 
With about half" the student vote
tabulated at noon today, indications
are that the Stanford student body
will show itself over-whelmingly in
favor of the Bok priz-e peace plan,
from figures compiled by Professor
Graham H. Stuart, in charge of ballot
ing on the campus. The total vote
tabulated this morning showed 952 for
and 85 against the plan.
The largest percentage of the few
opposing votes come from the fratern
ity men, with incomplete returns
showing 122 for and 18 against. Out
of a total of 118 sorority women, only
five declared themselves as opposed
to the plan. A representative vote
from dormitories and clubs shows a
total of- 327 to 29, while the vote of
the freshman class, taken yesterday
morning in class periods, is 420 to 33
in favor of the plan. The vote of the
freshmen is of particular significance
as it follows a week of class discus
sion.
About three-quarters of the total
number of ballots sent out have been
turned in to the office, Professor Stu
art stated; but it has been impossible
to count the votes as rapidly as they
come in. The tabulation is expected
to be completed tomorrow. Faculty
votes should come in this afternoon
and tomorrow morning, as thev were
sent out by mail.
