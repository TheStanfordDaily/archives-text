# NEED FOR BETTER-TRAINED TEACHERS TOLD BY DR, WILBUR
## 
### 
"The childhood of America is our
most priceless possession. What child
ren do with what we have built up
for them depends in what we give
them in the way of education," said
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur in a talk be
fore the San Francisco Mothers
and Parent-Teacher associations yes
terday. He emphasized the importance
of proper training of teachers, and
advocated an extention of the teach
er's college course to four years with
the granting of an A.B. degree on
completion of the course.
"Any one who has ever observed
the work of the trained teacher, and
that of the untrained, side by side,
must have been convinced of the
value of special training in the teach
er's craft. Many little children are
set. on fire with the desire to learn
by a primary teacher, and then are
snuffed out by poor teaching later
on," Dr. Wilbur explained.
"Cheap education is a costly thing.
We have to go on paying the bills
all the time, for ignorance is a con
tinual waste.
"The teacher's college gives the
teacher an opportunity to grow,"
said Dr. Wilbur in support of the re
cently adopted system. "The old
fashioned normal school with its two
year course is way out of date. The
problems of education are now very
different than in the old days and de
serve a different treatment."
The Congress is holding a sympos
ium on educational problems, especi
ally in regard to providing adequate
training for teachers in California,
which is recognized as our most
pressing need.
