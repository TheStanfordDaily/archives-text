# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MEET SAN JOSE TEACHERS TONIGHT
## Lightweights Will Oppose Y.M.C.A. Team In Preliminary Games Babes Will Face Fast and Aggressive Outfit in Pavilion Contest 
### 
The freshman basketball quintet
will have its first real test this eve
ning at 8 o'clock in the pavilion when
it tangles with the fast San Jose
Teachers College team.
The pedagogues are said to have a
powerful aggregation this year. They
have had a successful season thus far,
winning most of their games, and are
coming to the farm tonight with a de
sire to avenge the football defeat
handed them by the Babes last fall.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has developed
the best freshman team Stanford has
seen for several years. It has had
little difficulty in trouncing all com
ers and bids fair to go through the
preliminary season without tasting
defeat.
Babes Aggressive
The Babes are playing an aggres
sive passing game, and seldom take
shots at the hoop unless they are in
a good position to score. In Newhouse
Hunt has found the right man on
whom to center this play. The big
reaj guard comes to the middle of
the floor, and if the four men on the
offense cannot work the ball in near
enough to shoot, the ball is passed
back to him. The advance to the
basket then starts again.
Newhouse Steady
Newhouse has a cool head, and has
been one of the chief factors in the
Babes' success, by his calmness in
getting the ball out of difficulty. His
200 plus pounds of beef make him a
tower of strength when it comes to
breaking up plays that the opponents
try to get past liim. In the five games
played he has only been knocked off
his feet once.
. Anderson and Jayred are still fight
ing it out for the center position.
From the looks of things now both
men will get an equal chance to play.
Anderson looked best in scrimmage
yesterday and will probably start the
game.
Forwards Dependable
Price and David are going good at
forward. They are fast passers and
dependable shooters. Riese and Hoff
man seem to have the edge over the
other substitutes for this position.
Riese plays a good defensive game but
lacks the speed and shooting ability
ol' the two regulars. Hoffman is big
and tall. He is a valuable man for
play under the basket.
Shipkey will be Newhouse's running
mate in the guarding department. He
has been playing a consistent game
all season, and fits well into the babe
passing machine.
Williams and Joseph will probably
get in the game before it is over.
Williams can change off with Shipkey
without slowing up the work of the
team. Joseph is a good standing guard,
but he lacks the weight necessary for
a regular.
