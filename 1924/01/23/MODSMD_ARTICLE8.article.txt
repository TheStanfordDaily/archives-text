# ARTICLE WRITTEN BY DR. GRAY IS PRINTED IN SEWANEE REVIEW

"At the First Performance of 'King
Lear'," an article by Professor Henry
David Gray of the English department
appears in the October-December is
sue of the "Sewanee Review."
The article is divided into three
parts, the first of which is a plea di
rected to "My Dear Ancestor" by the
author, who is inquiring about the
first performance of the play, and
wondering whether the seeming incon
sistencies seen in the play today were
present in the original under Shakes
peare's direction.
He particularly mentions the real
ism of the storm scene, Lear's manner
of dividing his kingdom, Gloucester's
imaginary fall from a cliff, and the
elapse of time supposed to take place
while Kent is in the stocks. The au
thor speaks enviously of the oppor
tunity of being a "first afternooner at
a Shakespearian production."
Answer Is Dignified
The second part is the dignified an
swer of the ancestor to "My Degener
ate Descendant." Written in the
language of the Elizabethan period, it
shows surprise that Shakespeare
should be the occasion for so much
interest, and then follows with a vivid
description of the action of the play
as it was seen at the initial per
formance. It gives proof that all the
inconsistencies mentioned are mere
lack of imagination of the audiences
nowadays.
The rebuke at the end is: "This
much have I set down for the love
of the sweet poet who made it. Pri
thee troubl-e me 110 more with thy
needless questionings and thine un
couth idiom."
The author, however, retorts in the
third and last part of the article in
the same audacious note which is
characteristic of his first letter. He
gives thanks for the information, and
protests that his contemporaries would
not believe half of what is said by
the venerable ancestor.
