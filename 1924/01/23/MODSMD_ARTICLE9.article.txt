# Thornhill's Courtmen Are Handicapped by Lack Of Practice Games
## 
### 
Stanford's 130-pound basketball
team will meet the San Jose Y. M.
C. A. midget quintet in the third game
of the season at 7 o'clock tonight in
the pavilion. The Card team has yet
to show the teamwork necessary to
beat California next month.
Handicapped by lack of practice, the
130's haven't played together long
enough to find themselves as a quin
tet. They are limited to three nights
a week, and Coach "Tiny" Thornhill
has not had a chance to develop much
teamwork.
As a result, the squad has made a
very slow start this season. Their first
game was with the 130's of the San
Jose high school, supposedly a set-up
for the Stanford five. But the San
Jose team put up an unexpected fight,
and the Card lightweights were hard
put to win 18-12.
Last week the 130's won from Palo
Alto high school by a score of 10 to 6.
The Palo Alto quintet was leading up
to the last few minutes of play. The
Card lightweights attribute their poor
showing to an off night.
With a quartet of veterans for the
nucleus of the team, Thornhill should
be able to develop a fast, aggressive
five with a little more time. Tonight
he will probably start Meyers and
Hobro at forward, Hogle at center,
and Blosser and Hugo at the guard
positions.
