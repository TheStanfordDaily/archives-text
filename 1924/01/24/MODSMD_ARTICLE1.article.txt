The Delta Tau win was accomplished
after a ragged game. Victors over
Alpha Delt and Encina 2nd, they were
not tip to previous form and could not
often find the basket. Their passing

by Morrison of Delta Tau Delta to
begin the second half. The Delta Taus
missed frequently the remainder oi" the

Tail with 8 points, Collet tossing in the
additional 5. De√üach at running guard
played a fast game.
El Cuadro Easy Winner.
El Cuadro had little trouble in win
ning over Theta Chi, 17 to 4. The lat
ter put up a good defense but were not
able to retain the ball long on defen
sive plays.
El Cuadro, however, passed frc
quently and showed a better eye for
the hoop, ending the first period 12 to 0.
Theta Chi showed more fight starting
the second half and scored two points
soon after the opening whistle. Hogle,
a fast substitute center, strengthened
the fraternity offense but the clubmen's
lead was too great and they won, 17
to 4.
Sewell was high point man for the
victors with eight points, Thompson
scoring three and Holstein four.
For Theta Chi, Hogle, Smith and
Dice showed up well.
Alpha Delt Wins 22-8.
Alpha Delta Phi easily defeated the
Panthers 22 to 8. The Alpha Delts
used a fast offensive and carried the
ball under their basket frequently.
Kellogg was the only Panther who
could stop the Alpha Delt offense, and
the latter piled up a lead of 14 to 5 by
the end of the half.
Frequent substitutions were made by
the Alpha Delts the second period,
which weakened their offense. Accurate
passing, however, added eight points
for them while only three additional
counts were allowed the Panthers.
Phelps High Man.
Phelps was high point man for the
winners with twelve, Neer scoring six,
and Dennis four. Campbell played a
fast game at guard.
Chi Psi nosed out Phi Sigma Kappa
in a fast game, 15 to 11. Both fives
passed the ball frequently but good de
fenses broke up most of the scoring
plays. After fifteen minutes of close
play, Chi Psi accounted for six points,
allowing three to the Phi Sigs.
Chi Psi Holds Lead.
The second period both fives were
more accurate and Chi Psi tossed in
four field goals as did their opponents,
The three-point lead of the first half
was not overcome by Phi Sigma Kappa,
however, and Chi Psi won, 15 to 11.
King, playing forward, scored seven
points for the winners, Hays following
him with six.
Morrison led the scoring for Phi Sig
with six points, Miller accounting for
two and McLellan three.
It was erroneously announced in
Tuesday's Daily that Phi Kappa Sigma
had defaulted to Los Arcos and that
the Japanese Club won from Sequoia I.
The report should have stated that the
Japanese won from Los Arcos and that
Phi Kappa Sigma defaulted to Se
quoia I.
