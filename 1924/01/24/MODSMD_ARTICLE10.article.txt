# GOOD ARCHITECTURE NEEDED
## Los Angeles, City Of Beautiful Homes, Offers Good Study, Says Clark 
### Esther Greenacre 
Cultivating a good taste for architecture among people of all classes is a
delicate proposition and one involving a good deal of psychology, is the
opinion of Professor Arthur 13. Clark of the Graphic Art division of the
Education department. Professor Clark returned to Stanford this quarter
after three months in the southern part of the state where lie lectured on the
extension circuit of the University of California.
He delivered lectures on the "Art of the House" in Los Angeles where he had
three classes. He also gave a course in Whittier, delivered fifteen lectures in

San Diego, and gave extra lectures in
Hollywood. Those attending his class
es were people working for degrees,
school teachers, and clubwomen in
terested in improving the civic beauty
of cities. Prospective builders also at
tended the lectures.
Professor Clark's course on the
"Art of the House" included lectures
on interiors and exteriors, civit plan
ning, village improvement, and yard
planning. He conducted tours in busses
through Los Angeles and Santa Bar
bara, pointing out representative
types of good and bad architecture to
his classes. Pictures of the same
houses wore taken and lantern slide
lectures delivered.
Los Angeles Offers Good Study
"Los Angeles furnishes an excellent
field for architectural study.'V The
flourishing building business creates a

great interest in good architecture.
Many outside people consider erecting
only the vulgar bungalow and need to
be educated to the better style of
architecture. The chief factor in the
building business is speed, the lumber
men caring only to handle as much
work as possible. Consequently, the
bungalow books in which plans for
this type of house are shown are over
used and the poor type of homes is
perpetuated.
Spanish, Italian Styles Best
"The best present styles of archi
tecture are those from Italy and Spain.
The eastern colonial style is also very
good but not as suitable for the "West
as the other types.
In Santa Barbara, are found some
of the best homes. Under the auspices
of the art association of that place,
the Santa Barbara style of house is
being brought back and the number
increased. In Hollywood, the Hill as
sociation has as its object the de
velopment of the best type of domestic
architecture.
"In Whittier, a small place, I found
the situation more difficult to handle
than in the cities. There, the older
type of house is most prevalent. It is
necessary to show to the inhabitants
of such towns that they can build
moderately-priced houses on attractive
plans and combine style with conven
ience. Some of the smallest houses
have the neatest, space-saving de
vices."
Professor Clark brought back many
prints and pictures from the south for
use in his "Art of the House" course
at Stanford.
