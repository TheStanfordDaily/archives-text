## Los Angeles, City Of Beautiful Homes, Offers Good Study, Says Clark

Cultivating a good taste for architecture among people of all classes is a
delicate proposition and one involving a good deal of psychology, is the

extension circuit of the University of California.
He delivered lectures on the "Art of the House" in Los Angeles where he had

San Diego, and gave extra lectures in
Hollywood. Those attending his class

through Los Angeles and Santa Bar

types of good and bad architecture to
his classes. Pictures of the same
houses wore taken and lantern slide
lectures delivered.
