# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA DEBATE HERE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford meets California tonight
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theatre in
their corner of the annual triangular
debate. In this forensic contest a
novel scheme of judging will he in
troduced when the audience decides
by a majority vote which of the teams
has better argued the question.
"Resolved, That the California
Criminal Syndicalism Law should be
repealed," will be the topic under dis
cussion. This is a question that has
been brought to the attention of the
people of California many times in
the last few years and so carries with
it a great amount of interest.
One of the most recent and notable
applications of this section of the
California code was the arrest of Up
ton Sinclair in Los Angeles last year.
The law provides in a general way
that all members of the I. W. W. and
such organizations may be arrested
for that fact alone without the com
mission of any overt act by the of
fender. Hence Sinclair's suppression
while reading the Declaration of Inde
pendence of the United States.
The Stanford team will uphold the
affirmative side of the argument to
night. Upon Stanley Weigel and Thom
as Bailey rests the task of proving
to the audience that the syndicalism
law is no good and should be re
pealed. It is Weigel's first appearance
as a varsity debater but he has had
enough previous experience at the
game to take him out of the novice
class. Bailey was a member of the
winning tri-state team last year and
also represented Stanford in the
Joffre medal debate.
When the two teams have said all
that they can or will be allowed to say
the audience comes in for its share
of the evening's entertainment. Bal
lots will be passed around by the
ushers to every one present and the
decision will rest on the total of the
individual votes.
Tonight's intercollegiate battle of
words and ideas is a part of the
triangular meetings between U. S. Câ€ž
California, and Stanford. Next Tues
day evening the Stanford negative
team will journey to Los Angeles to
battle with the Trojans.
Bert Levit and Robert Littler will
make up the team next week. Both
will be debatfng for Stanford for the
first time. Littler is a transfer from
Willamette College where he was
known as a public speaker, taking
second place in the contest held at
Eugene last year.
