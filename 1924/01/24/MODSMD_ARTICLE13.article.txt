# JOHNSTON DEFEATS IRELAND 3 TO 2 IN DIAMOND STRUGGLE
## Cards Make Sensational Rally In Ninth Inning, Winning On Four Base Hit; Oviatt Hurls Well 
### 
Cliff Ireland won his first Stanford Independents contest yesterday ftftetnoont
by a score of 2 to 0, and then lost it when the Cards in general and Cliuci
Johston in particular refused to take the dose, and won 3 to
Stanford loafed along for eight innings, putting men on the bases but
lacking the final punch necessary to boost a man over the last hurdle . In the
last of the ninth, Mulchay and Oviatt flied out to the fielders, leaving two men
out and two runs needed to tie the score.
"Shorty" Roberts drove a hot grounder at "Mister" O'Brien, substituting
for Ireland at second. The ball bounced from a shin, and "Shorty" was safe
at first. Cuddeback drew a base on balls after Roberts had stolen second, and
"Shorty" immediately swiped third with great success. Johnston at bat, and
two strikes. Chuck took a deep breath and slugged between center and right
fields, driving the ball to the fence. Roberts and Cuddeback strolled over the
platter, knotting the count, while Johnston was raising a cloud of dust around

pthe paths. O'Brien juggled the ball on
the throw-in, and got it to the plate
about ten seconds too late. Score 3
to 2 for the Cardinals, with Johnston
famous.
Stanford out-hit the Irishmen by
seven blows to five, and played a fair
defensive game throughout. The of
fense fell short until the ninth inning,
but Oviatt opened his varsity career
with a glorious victory.
The aged Cliff showed few signs of
his scarlet fever, save for the fact
that he slipped up on his usual hit and
error. His humor first appeared when
he alluded to the rooting section as
the Sistine choir (later the Glee Club)
and persisted until Johnston's closing
episode knocked the wind out of him.
Cliff's crew drew first blood in the
third. Corrigan walked, but Kear'ns
forced him at the middle corner. Koe-'
nig blew a warm hittacross second, I
and Kearns pulled up at third. Koenig
set sail for Roberts' base, and a high
peg from the plate allowed Kearns to
score. Koenig was held at second.
Both teams went scoreless until the
ninth, when the lid blew off. "Fat"
Anfinson reached first on a fielder's ;
choice and took second on Reppy's |
bingle through shortstop. By this time j
the Independent batting order was a j
fable, and a man named Keefe strolled I
to the plate and made a hit, scoring
Atifinson. Ireland enjoyed a 2 to 0 j
lead, which lasted for about ten min-!
utes. O'Brien struck out, ending the i
inning, and allowing Roberts, Cudde- J
back, and Johnston to stage their act. j
Roberts played a slashing game
throughout, connecting for hits in
three out of five appearances at the
plate, and stealing three bases. John
ston singled, in addition to his Babe :
Ruth, and McCandless, Lawson, and
Woodward broke into the hit column.
Oviatt, though a trifle unsteady, hurled
a creditable game.
Cliff kept the bleachers well enter-:
tained. McCandless made a spectacu
lar grab of Anfinson's fly in the fourth, I
and Ireland opined that a letter would ;
go home to the folks. When Fuller
made a still more sensational snatch
that robbed Armstrong of a triple,
Cliff enjoyed his annual fainting-fit.
He closed the day by remarking that
the umpire had made a clean sweep.
