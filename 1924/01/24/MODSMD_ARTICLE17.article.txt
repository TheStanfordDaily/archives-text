# THE 						VOTE FOR PEACE
## 
### 
Student opinion on campus matters usually does not weigh much.
Students are not around the University long enough to make their thoughts
on college affairs any more than novelties without the benefit of experience.
But a student's opinion, expressed on affairs of the world in which he
will shortly take a more or less leading part, is given the consideration due
to one who will some day be a leader in the movements which other people
will only express opinions.
The vote of the student body on the Peace Plan submitted by Mr.
Bok is therefore significant as the attitude of the country twenty years
from now. Some details will be changed, of course, but the overwhelm
ing vote in favor of peace shows better than could the balloting of all
civic organizations in all cities in the, country whether or not the United
States some years hence will still be hiding in the hazy myth of isolation.
If the country as a whole votes "yes" in the right place Europe will
know, whatever is her opinion on the plan as a workable scheme, that the
United States at least wishes to join in some plan for unselfish benefit of
the world. If colleges throughout the country vote the same way, assur
ance will be given that the future men of influence- will carry through
what has been started.

THE TRADITIONAL INDEPENDENCE of the Stanford man is
again shown in the scarcity of hand-knitted Christmas sox to he seen 011
