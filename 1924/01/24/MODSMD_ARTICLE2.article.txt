# COWLES DISCUSSES NEWS MACHINERY OF ASSOCIATED PRESS
## Accuracy, Fairness and Non-partisan Attitude Has Made Reputation 
### 
"News is a common property and
is available to anyone who lias the en
terprise and the disposition to go
after it. The only advantage that the
Associated Press claims is its mach
inery for going after the news, ob
taining it, and distributing it," de
clared Paul Cowles in his talk last
evening to members of the American
Journalists Association at the home of
Professor Everett Smith.
Accuracy, fairness, and non-partisan
attitude have helped to build up
the reputation of the Associated
Press. Accuracy is gained because
the Associated Press never takes a
chance on news. It takes nothing for
granted but verifies before sending
stories out to members. No strings
can be pulled by those outside the
Associated Press to suppress any
news, because advertising is not ne
cessary to keep the organization go
ing, as is the case on daily papers.
A non-partisan attitude must be main
tained because the membership of
the organization is composed of men
representing every known political
party and religious sect.
A. P. Is Specialized
The highly specialized organiza
tion of the Associated Press was
pointed out by Mr. Cowles. It was or
ganized under the Club laws of New
York in 1893 and now has 1350 mem
bers. A thousand words of Associated
Press news released by wire costs
less than does the same amount of
local news gathered by a member.
The vigilance of the Associated
Press is illustrated by the way the
Harding death was handled. Mr.
Cowles happened to be in Seattle
when the President was taken sick
there. He immediately returned to
San Francisco to be on hand in case
of an emergency. When a favorable
bulletin was issued in regard to the
President's condition, Mr. Cowles call
ed some eminent physicians in San
Francisco and asked their opinion of
the symptoms.
When they stated that they would
be very much alarmed, Mr. Cowles ■
put a man on watch outside Mr.
Harding's door at the Palace Hotel
and told him not to leave his post
until he was relieved. A telegraph
wire and a private telephone were
installed at the hotel.
Everyone was under the impression
that Mr. Harding was going to get
well, except the Associated Press, so
when Mr. Harding collapsed and Mrs.
Harding rushed out screaming into
the hall the Associated Press man was
the only one on duty. The bulletins
which were sent out to the members
served as a warning to be on the
watch for something. When the official
announcement was made that Presi
dent Harding was dead, the Associated
Press representative was nearer the
wire than anybody else and got the
news out five seconds sooner.
Nippon Disaster Handled
A like vigilance was demonstrated
in the report of the Japanese earth
quake. The Associated Press engaged
a courier to go to Tokio from a wire
less station 150 miles north of the
stricken city and find their corres
pondent and get his story. The man
got. the story and returned in three
days to the station and sent it out.
"The scope of the Associated Press
is so great that there isn't a spot on
the globe where something happens
that there isn't somebody to send
news to the Associated Press,", con
cluded Mr. Cowles.

In 1824 the first three-story brick
building was completed in Brooklyn,
New York. The town had a population
of 7,000 and the houses had boon num
bered and some of the streets payed.

representing every known political
party and religious sect.
A. P. Is Specialized
The highly specialized organiza
tion of the Associated Press was
pointed out by Mr. Cowles. It was or
ganized under the Club laws of New
York in 1893 and now has 1350 mem
bers. A thousand words of Associated
Press news released by wire costs
less than does the same amount of
local news gathered by a member.
The vigilance of the Associated
Press is illustrated by the way the
Harding death was handled. Mr.
Cowles happened to be in Seattle
when the President was taken sick
there. He immediately returned to
San Francisco to be on hand in case
of an emergency. When a favorable
bulletin was issued in regard to the
President's condition, Mr. Cowles call
ed some eminent physicians in San
Francisco and asked their opinion of
the symptoms.
When they stated that they would
be very much alarmed, Mr. Cowles ■
put a man on watch outside Mr.
Harding's door at the Palace Hotel
and told him not to leave his post
until he was relieved. A telegraph
wire and a private telephone were
installed at the hotel.
Everyone was under the impression
that Mr. Harding was going to get
well, except the Associated Press, so
when Mr. Harding collapsed and Mrs.
Harding rushed out screaming into
the hall the Associated Press man was
the only one on duty. The bulletins
which were sent out to the members
served as a warning to be on the
watch for something. When the official
announcement was made that Presi
dent Harding was dead, the Associated
Press representative was nearer the
wire than anybody else and got the
news out five seconds sooner.
Nippon Disaster Handled
A like vigilance was demonstrated
in the report of the Japanese earth
quake. The Associated Press engaged
a courier to go to Tokio from a wire
less station 150 miles north of the
stricken city and find their corres
pondent and get his story. The man
got. the story and returned in three
days to the station and sent it out.
"The scope of the Associated Press
is so great that there isn't a spot on
the globe where something happens
that there isn't somebody to send
news to the Associated Press,", con
cluded Mr. Cowles.

In 1824 the first three-story brick
building was completed in Brooklyn,
New York. The town had a population
of 7,000 and the houses had boon num
bered and some of the streets payed.
"News is a common property and
is available to anyone who lias the en
terprise and the disposition to go
after it. The only advantage that the
Associated Press claims is its mach
inery for going after the news, ob
taining it, and distributing it," de
clared Paul Cowles in his talk last
evening to members of the American
Journalists Association at the home of
Professor Everett Smith.
Accuracy, fairness, and non-partisan
attitude have helped to build up
the reputation of the Associated
Press. Accuracy is gained because
the Associated Press never takes a
chance on news. It takes nothing for
granted but verifies before sending
stories out to members. No strings
can be pulled by those outside the
Associated Press to suppress any
news, because advertising is not ne
cessary to keep the organization go
ing, as is the case on daily papers.
A non-partisan attitude must be main
tained because the membership of
the organization is composed of men
representing every known political
party and religious sect.
