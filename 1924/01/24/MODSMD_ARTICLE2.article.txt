# COWLES DISCUSSES NEWS MACHINERY OF ASSOCIATED PRESS
## Accuracy, Fairness and Non-partisan Attitude Has Made Reputation

representing every known political

Press news released by wire costs
less than does the same amount of
local news gathered by a member.

there. He immediately returned to
San Francisco to be on hand in case
of an emergency. When a favorable
bulletin was issued in regard to the
President's condition, Mr. Cowles call

Francisco and asked their opinion of
the symptoms.
When they stated that they would
