### 
The "Military Ball" has been post-1
poned until spring quarter, it was
definitely announced today by the
Military department. The postpone
ment was made necessary by the fact
that a suitable closed date could not
be obtained this quarter.
Although a definite date has not
been decided upon it is expected that
the ball will be given some time dur
ing the first two weeks of the spring
quarter.
At a meeting of Scabbard and Blade
last week Glen C. Barnes was elected
chairman of the committee in charge
of the function. He will be assisted
by Andrew R. Boone and Leon T.
David; Junior representatives, Edward
Bye, Bert Price; Sophomore repre- j
sentatives, George Baker, Homer Don
baugh; Freshman representatives,
Phillip Duncan, George Wheaton.
