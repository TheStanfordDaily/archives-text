### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among all the animals, both wild and tame, who inhabit the mountain
slopes and rockbound coast of Catalina island, by far the most interesting is
the Squirrel. "Squirrel" de Arce, sometimes known as the Sheik of Avalon, is
as much an institution on the island as fishing and bathing. Those who
have visited Mr. Wrigley's playground know all about Squirrel. To those
who haven't been so lucky, let is be known that De Arce is:
1. A young man who is equally at home in or out of the water, and who
dives to a depth of forty feet just like it was easy, and picks up abalone shells
and tourists' false teeth.
2. A life-guard who has pulled many floundering humans from the smooth
waters of the bay.
3. A golfer extraordinary who shoots his home course in less than 70
regularly and who has acted as golf pro to clubs around Los Angeles.
4. A ball player of parts who has often pitched against and fanned out
the Cubs during their spring training on the Island.
5. A boxer, oarsman, fisherman, and inventor of the Catalina Beach Hats.
Vive le Squirrel!
