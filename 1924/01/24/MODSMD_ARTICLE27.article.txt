# INTERCLASS SWIMMERS COMPETE FEBRUARY 16
## 
### 
The freshman swimming team,
headed by "Bob" Williams, Phil
Brooks, and "Dutch" Fletcher, looks
like a good bet to swim away from
the rest of the classes in the inter
class meet set for February 16. Coach
Brandsten is enthusiastic over his
new men and says that they will keep
Stanford at the top in damp compe
tition for another four years.
The sophomores have two good men
in O'Connor and Allen but will have
to spring a few dark horses, or fish,
to win.
"Dutch" McAllister and "Bob"
Myers are the two best bets for '25,
while the seniors have Charlie
Fletcher, Curtis Wright, Eric Krae
mer and A1 White as their mainstays.
