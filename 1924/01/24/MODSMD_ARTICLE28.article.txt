# WESTERN KANSAS SCENE OF WAR ON JACK RABBIT
## 
### 
War has been declared on the Kan
sas jackrabbit in the western section
of the state, and the bombardment
seems to be taking its toll. One county
paid a bounty on 18,000 in two weeks.
Three weeks ago the price was raised
from five to ten cents per scalp.
