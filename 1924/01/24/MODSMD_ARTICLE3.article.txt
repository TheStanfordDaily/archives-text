# SLOSSON TELLS OF PAST AND FUTURE CHEMICAL SCIENCE
## Chemist Must Substitute His Products for Destroyed Natural Resources

"He is one of the few scientists
trying to produce a link between sci
ence and the people," said Dr. Wilbur,
introducing Dr. Edwin E. Slosson,
who talked on "Creative Chemistry"
at the University Assembly this morn
ing.
"The growing importance of the
constructive side of chemistry was
overshadowed by the destructive
forces of chemistry displayed in the
war," said Dr. Slosson. "Chemistry
will exercise an influence on the fu
ture world that cannot be compared
to the power of any other science.
"A good part of modern warfare is
conducted over the rights of posses
sion of food and fuel resources. Chem
istry can provide fuel and pow: -
eliminating one of the chief causes
of international disagreements.
"Chemistry is the science of power.
All energy is based on two chemical
principles, the oxidization of carbon
into carbon dioxide and the oxidiza
tion of hydrogen into water. Chemical
energy, in the form of gasoline and
high explosives, is a compact, porta
ble, and permanent power.
"Chemistry carries the keys of life
and death in the processes of the
body, compounds of chemicals. Of the
two systems of communication in the
body, one is chemical, carried on by
means of hormones.
"Chemistry is joyous science for it
contributes to the joys of life. Every
sense Is due to chemicals. Every tint
in the leaves of the forest, every shade
that delights the eye, is chemical.
"The aesthetic side of chemistry is
expressed in perfumes and dyes. No
other science has these riches.
"In the fields of household arts, mod
ern manufactures, and agriculture,
the possibilities of metamorphoses of
material in the world are astonishing.
A motto of the chemist is 'Where there
is industry, thero is waste. Where
there is waste there is wealth if pro
perly used.'
"Coal tar, by which the world has
been made brighter and sweeter, was
discovered by a boy experimenting
for quinine. Because his analines
were impure we got the first of the
dyes.
"We no longer have to beg the Medi
terranean mollusk for his royal pur
ple. The people have been raised to
ranks of kings for they can possess
for 10 cents a package what used to
be worth a king's ransom.
"The modern skyscraper is a syn
thetic organism made in the chemical
laboratory. Cement, steel, terra cotta,

brick, glass, copper wires, are all pro
duced by the chemist.
"In the great unsolved problems of
the future lies the potential power of
the science of chemistry. Leather, an
imperfect but indispensable commod
ity, has no satisfactory substitute.
Six million dollars, the annual cost of
leather in the United States, would be
a suitable reward for one.
"We nurture the silly lamb for short
stringy wool but have nothing better.
Man must put his pride In pocket just
as he did when he had no pockets.
"We are basking in the sunshine
that shone millions of years ago, but
coal, gas, petroleum, will sometime be
exhausted. Chemistry must solve the
problem of getting energy directly
from the sun or we will have to move
to the southern countries.
"Plans, noiseless, smokeless fac
tories, can, with water and the power
of sunshine, build up complicated
compounds that we cannot duplicate.
Twenty square feet of space receives,
in this latitude, one horsepower of
energy from the sun continually. The
energy of the sun on the desert of
California equals that of all the coal
consumed in the world in twenty-four
hours. If we could use this energy the
nations would be fighting over the
deserts as the region's riches in na
tural resources.
"If man had a head as good as a
cabbage head he would be able to do
these things."
