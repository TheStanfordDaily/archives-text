# KLUXERS HAVE ORGANIZATION AMONG RESIDENTS OF CAMPUS
## 
### 
Organization of a unit of the Ku
Klux Klan at Stanford University,
with officers and members drawn from
the student body, has been completed.
This was the statement made today
by Robert Burnett, graduate student
in engineering, who has been largely
responsible for the agitation leading
to the establishment of a unit of the
Invisible Empire here.
