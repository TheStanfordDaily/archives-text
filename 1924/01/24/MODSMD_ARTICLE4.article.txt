# LIGHTWEIGHTS LOSE TO SAN JOSE 15-12
## 
### Ray Spangler 
Stanford's 130-lb. basketball team
lost to tlve San Jose Y. M. C. A. light
weights last night by a score of 15
to 12. The fracas developed into a
basketball game in the last quarter.
Before that it was a slow, poorly
played melee.
The Card 130's need practice. When
they got the ball they passed it around
the middle of the floor and gave the
San Jose men a chance to bunch
around the basket. Heple, the San
Jose center, had the jump on both
Hogle and McLellan, and the Y. M.
C. A. team had some semblance of
teamwork in passing the ball to a
shooting position.
If the San Jose lightweights had
been able to shoot from the foul line,
their score would have been eight
points larger. They handled two out
of eight free throws in the first half,
and one out of three in the second.
At the end of the first half, the
score stood 4 to 4. At the end of the
third quarter the San Jose team was
leading 10 to 6. McLellan and Kitov*
went in for Hogle and Meyer, and the
Stanford team braced.
They uncovered an aggressive of
fense. Kitow went down for the bas
ket when Stanford got the ball, and
McLellan was able to shake his man
once in awhile. Hobro, who played all
over the court, found somebody to
pass to when he got the ball.
But at the same time, the San Jose
forwards began to find the basket.
During the first of the gamo they
tried long, wide shots, and missed
many good chances. During the last
quarter their men got under the bas
ket.
The Stanford forwards were well
covered throughout the game, ..and
their shots were usually hurried or
from difficult positions. The offense
wasn't fast enough to work free.
Stark did most of the scoring for
San Jose, with several long shots to
his credit. Hobro, Meyer, and Kitow
scored one field goal apiece for the
130's. Hobro put in four fouls, and
Hogle two. Hugo and Bloss-er did good
work in the guard positions, although
Hugo was caught alone several times
in the hole.
The line-up:
Stanford — San Jose —
Hobro F Stark
Meyer F Meridith
Hogle C Heple
Blosser G Sparks
Hugo G Herman
