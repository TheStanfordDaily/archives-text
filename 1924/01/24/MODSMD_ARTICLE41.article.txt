# Canoeing On Lake Strictly Forbidden Until Late Spring
## 
### 
As a result of the light rainfall this
year, Lagunita may not be filled until
late in the spring, and there is a pos
sibility that it will not be filled this
year at all, according to A. E. Roth,
comptroller. The lake has invariably
been filled in previous dry seasons.
Since San Francisquito Creek is the
only source of supply by which the
lake may be filled the only hope seems
to be in a heavy rainfall during the
remaining rainy season.
Regarding a permanent lake Roth
stated that at the present time there
seemed to be no prospects of having
the lake the year around. The only
possible way the lake could be perma
nent is to build a damn at the lower
end of San Francisquito Creek, thus
insuring an additional water supply
which would not effect the wells in
the vicinity.
