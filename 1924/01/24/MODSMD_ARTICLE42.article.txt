Since a woman of the freshman class
recently appeared at dinner carrying
what seemed to he a doll representing
Topsy's twin sister, it would seem that
the lingering instincts of childhood
have been unduly encouraged by the
latest craze for dolls, which is being
followed by women of fashion.
Too much "Topsy and Eva" may
also have been a cause for the sudden
appearance of the doll, who could be
none other than the twin sister in ques
tion, dressed up in her Sunday best,
and waving her arms and legs in the
wild way dolls of today have been
taught to do.
