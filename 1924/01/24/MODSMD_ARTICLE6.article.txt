# "MILESTONES" MOST DISTINCTIVE--DR. GRAY
## Praises Gordon Davis for Bringing Good Plays to Campus Stage 
### 
"One of the most distinctive and ef
fective stage plays I have ever seen," !
sr.; Dr. Henry David Gray, of the I
P !i-h Department, speaking of j
"Milestones" the coming Masquers'
production. "It is a play that by read- j
ing is only mediocre but by its pre- '
sentation on the stage becomes a suc
cess of the first magnitude."
Attracts Audience.
"'Milestones' attracts and holds the
audience, not only because of the fact
that the theme in itself is interesting
but that the leading actors arc re
quired to play 'three ages.'
"This taxes the ingenuity and skill
of the actors to the maximum, and it is
this situation that causes more than
the usual interest among the audience.
"The co-operation of Bennett and
Knoblauch in writing the play was a
most happy combination," says Gray.
"Bennett is more the novelist, while
Knoblauch is more the dramatist, and
by combining the works and experi
ences of these two we have a play that
has been a decided success wherever it
has played.
Theme of Play.
"It is unfortunate that Bennett and
Knoblauch were not able to carry their
main theme into the present day. Dis
satisfaction and ridicule by the older
generation of the younger, brought out
mainly through the medium of building
ships, is their theme.
"One generation builds iron ships
only to be laughed at by their elders,
and they in turn scorn their sons for
building with steel. How might these
sons have ridiculed cement ships of
this generation. So it goes, the younger
generation forging ahead, fighting
against the conservatism of age."
Praises Davis.
"Gordon Davis has been doing great
work for Stanford in the dramatic line.
He has brought unity, raised the stand
ards of the plays, and given them a
finish that is seldom found in college
dramatics," says Gray. "During my
trip east I attended three plays at one
of the large eastern universities and in
no way were they comparative to the
productions put on by Stanford."

of the large eastern universities and in
no way were they comparative to the
productions put on by Stanford."
