# BABE FIVE WINS WITH THREE EXTRA PERIODS
## San Jose Teachers Put Up Game Fight; Anderson Gets Winning Goal 
### Wallace Knox 
Fighting every minute of the game,
the freshman hoopsters nosed out the
San Jose Teachers College five after
three extra periods of play, by the
score of 20 to 18.
The game was the closest seen on
the campus this year. The lead shifted
back and forth from one team to the
other, but at no stage of the contest
was either team ahead by more than

The Babes were ahead, 16 to 14, a

second half but the teachers uncorked
a bit of fast passing and Lawless tied
the score from under the basket.

foul was called on David for holding,
but Cakebread missed his free throw.
The score stood 18-18 when the second
period ended.

This made the score 20 to 18 for the
Babes.
A personal foul was called on David
but Mitchell missed his shot. Ander
