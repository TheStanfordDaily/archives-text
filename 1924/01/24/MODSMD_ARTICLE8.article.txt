# BABE FIVE WINS WITH THREE EXTRA PERIODS
## San Jose Teachers Put Up Game Fight; Anderson Gets Winning Goal 
### Wallace Knox 
Fighting every minute of the game,
the freshman hoopsters nosed out the
San Jose Teachers College five after
three extra periods of play, by the
score of 20 to 18.
The game was the closest seen on
the campus this year. The lead shifted
back and forth from one team to the
other, but at no stage of the contest
was either team ahead by more than
three points.
The Babes were ahead, 16 to 14, a
few seconds before the end of the
second half but the teachers uncorked
a bit of fast passing and Lawless tied
the score from under the basket.
Many Long Shots
The first extra five minute period
was scoreless. Neither team could
penetrate the other's defense and as
a result many long shots were taken.
All of these went. wild.
Towards the middle of the second
extra period Anderson caged a long
shot. Things looked good for the
Babes but Watson saved the Teachers
for a few minutes by dropping in a
shot from near the center circle. A
foul was called on David for holding,
but Cakebread missed his free throw.
The score stood 18-18 when the second
period ended.
Blazier and Riese had taken the
places of Price and David as forwards,
and Hunt sent both of these men back
in when the Teachers began threaten
ing to win.
Anderson Saves Game
It was Anderson who again put the
game on ice for the Babes by scoring
in the third extra period. David and
Price tried some long shots, but they
went wide. Anderson managed to get
'under one of them and follow it in.
This made the score 20 to 18 for the
Babes.
A personal foul was called on David
but Mitchell missed his shot. Ander
son took the ball down the floor and
shot, but it caught between the hoop
and bankboard. This delayed the game
for several seconds, during which Mc-
Licli went in for Lawless.
The Sail Jose men started with a
rush when the play was resumed, but
Cakebread made his fourth personal
and was removed from the game.
Price missed the foul try, but the
Babes took things easy the rest of the '
game and did not give the Teachers j
a chance to tie the score.
Cards Have Hard Luck
The Card youngsters played into
hard luck throughout the early part
of the game. Shots which they were
in the habit of making easily hit
the hoop and rolled over the the out
side of the ring. The San Jose five
had a better offense than any team
the Babes have been up against this
year, and frequently managed to get a
man through the Babe defense in a
position to score before a freshman
guard could get to him.
The score was even at the end of
the first quarter, 5 all. The Southern
ers had a little the best of things
during the next period and were on
top of a 10 to 8 score at the end of
the half. The Babes came back the
third quarter and led 14 to 12. From
then on it was a fight to see which
team could outfight the other, and the
Babes succeeded in doing it.
