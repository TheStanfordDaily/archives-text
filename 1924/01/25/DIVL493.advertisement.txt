For the balance of
the College Year |
| The Daily Palo Alto
Send it home to your folks instead of writing
a four-page letter every day. Maybe your chum
back home would like to know what Stanford is
doing. Give them all a chance to find out what
Stanford is really like by sending them the
Daily for the rest of the year for only $2.00.
Call at the Daily Office in the Press Building and place your home
address on our mailing list.
