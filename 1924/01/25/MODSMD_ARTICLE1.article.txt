# AUDIENCE VOTES 158 TO 18 AGAINST SYNDICALISM LAW
## Weigel And Bailey Show Forensic Ability In University's First Honor System Competition 
### James Muir 
Outpointing their opponents in effectiveness of public speaking, clearness of
thought, and logical use of fasts, Stanley Weigel and Thomas Bailey, com
posing the Stanford debating team, were awarded last night the decision over
California. The audience vote was 158 to IS.
For the first time in the history of Stanford intercollegiate debating, the
honor system was applied in the selection of the winning team. Each member
of the audience was given a ballot on which he voted for the side which in
his opinion had displayed the most effective debating ability. The merits of
the question as such were to be disregarded as were also any youthful ideas
of college loyalty.
Stanford Upholds Affirmative
Stanford upheld the affirmative side of* the question, "Resolved, That the
California Criminal Syndicalism Law should be repealed." Bailey opened
(lie discussion with a brief statement of the topic and then endeavored to
show why the law should be repealed.
This section of the California Code as it now stands states that anyone
found advocating the use of force to bring about a political change shall be
liable to fourteen years in the state prison. Bailey stated that this is a
decided departure from all fundamental principles of the United States,
California, or any other state, in that it provides for the arrest of a person
for merely expressing his opinion on a subject, where hitherto an overt act
was always considered necessary. In this form, Bailey argued, the law was
a direct violation of the traditional right of free speech which is incorporated
in the constitutions of the United States, California, and even Los Angeles.
Free Speech Unaffected Says U. C. Speaker
Stuart Ward, speaking on the negative side for the California team, followed
Bailey, and attempted to show that the law does not affect the right of free

speech. A man can still say what he*
pleases as long as he does not advo
cate violence against existing society,
Ward said. Advocating violence is
harmful, for it encourages hearers,
•who are easliv affected, to wreck things.
This law furnishes an ounce of pre
vention that is worth a pound of cure.
Stanley Weigel and Wendell Hub
hard. speaking for Stanford and Cali
fornia respectively, carried on the
arguments already advanced, refuted
some of those of the opposing side, I
and introduced further interesting and
effective facts. Rebuttals followed by
each of the four debaters in turn and
Bailey was given the last word in a
three-minute concluding speech.

Ballots were then taken up and
while being counted several questions
were asked of the speakers by mem
bers of the audience. This turned out
to be one of the most interesting sides
of the evening's entertainment, for
the two teams had to be prepared to
defend themselves against many indi
vidual opinions.
Weigel and Bailey easily proved
themselves to be their opponents' su
perior in debating ability. Their
speaking was clear and impressive, as
well as logical, while the California
men seemed to be talking in a rather
hit or miss manner and failed to put
their ideas across to the audience as
effectively as their opponents.

defend themselves against many indi

Weigel and Bailey easily proved
themselves to be their opponents' su
perior in debating ability. Their
speaking was clear and impressive, as

men seemed to be talking in a rather
hit or miss manner and failed to put
their ideas across to the audience as

Outpointing their opponents in effectiveness of public speaking, clearness of
thought, and logical use of fasts, Stanley Weigel and Thomas Bailey, com
posing the Stanford debating team, were awarded last night the decision over
California. The audience vote was 158 to IS.
For the first time in the history of Stanford intercollegiate debating, the
honor system was applied in the selection of the winning team. Each member
of the audience was given a ballot on which he voted for the side which in
his opinion had displayed the most effective debating ability. The merits of
the question as such were to be disregarded as were also any youthful ideas
of college loyalty.
Stanford Upholds Affirmative
Stanford upheld the affirmative side of* the question, "Resolved, That the
California Criminal Syndicalism Law should be repealed." Bailey opened
(lie discussion with a brief statement of the topic and then endeavored to
show why the law should be repealed.
This section of the California Code as it now stands states that anyone
found advocating the use of force to bring about a political change shall be
liable to fourteen years in the state prison. Bailey stated that this is a
decided departure from all fundamental principles of the United States,
California, or any other state, in that it provides for the arrest of a person
for merely expressing his opinion on a subject, where hitherto an overt act
was always considered necessary. In this form, Bailey argued, the law was
a direct violation of the traditional right of free speech which is incorporated
in the constitutions of the United States, California, and even Los Angeles.
Free Speech Unaffected Says U. C. Speaker
Stuart Ward, speaking on the negative side for the California team, followed
Bailey, and attempted to show that the law does not affect the right of free

speech. A man can still say what he*
pleases as long as he does not advo
cate violence against existing society,
Ward said. Advocating violence is
harmful, for it encourages hearers,
•who are easliv affected, to wreck things.
This law furnishes an ounce of pre
vention that is worth a pound of cure.
