# VARSITY BATTLES U. S. C. IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAMES
## STANFORD DEBATERS WIN FROM U.C. TROJANS AND CARDS TO FIGHT OUT SUPREMACY IN TWO-GAME SERIES TONIGHT, TOMORROW Southerners Boast Stronger Squad Than Last Season; Both Teams Appear Evenly Matched 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford and U. S. C. quintets clash tonight and tomorrow night in one
of the crucial basketball series of the southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference schedule. Both contests will start promptly at 8 o'clock in the
pavilion.
Should either team be defeated it will mean a serious setback, and probable
elimination for U. S. C. from the race for the Conference title.
Trojans Are Determined
U. S. C.is after a victory, and Stanford is out to beat the Trojans. Both
squads will fight to the final whistle. That the score will be close in both

instances is not to be disputed. But
which team lias an actual edge is
something for conjecture.
It would be no surprise to find the
Trojans employing the same tactics
against Stanford as they used against
the strong Bear squad last Saturday.
U. S. C. profited by playing a rough
game to the limit, and by rushing the
Bruin defensive with what resembled
football methods it was able to nose
out California in the last minute of
play, 26-25. Obviously, the Trojans are
not excusing themselves for their
"conduct;" it is the U. S. C. style, and
as long as it remains in the bounds
of sportsmanship there is nothing ob
jectionable.
Campbell, Star U. S. C. Forward
Gordon Campbell is by far the
Southerners' chief offensive player.
The entire Trojan machine operates
around him, and to advantage, for
Campbell is a fast, aggressive, and
ruthless floor man. Â»
Boyer. who plays opposite Campbell
at the other forward position, is re
ported to be as useful as his team
mate in scoring ability. Campbell and
Boyer were the two outstanding U. S.
C. stars in both contests with the
Bears, and are to be watcher here to
night as closely as good guarding will
allow.
Gerpheide is scheduled to begin at
center for the U. S. C. five, Dorsey
will play running guard assisted by
Hawkins at standing guard.
Cards Have Beaten Trojans
Last year the Cardinal five gave the
Trojans a handful of defeats which
are not likely to be forgotten by U.
S. C.for some time to come.
The two-game series played at Stan
ford went to the Cards 29 to 14, and
23 to 12 respectively. There was never
any doubt as to the outcome of either
contest. The Stanford men were easily
the masters of the field, despite the
questionable methods of a few Trojan
basketers. In the brace of games
played in the south, Stanford won, 17
to 13 and 24 to 21. In these two con
tests, the Cards were able to win only
by a hard finish drive. The second
',rame went three extra periods.
Southerners Stronger
U. S. C., to all appearances, has a
much better balanced squad this year
than last. Stanford has just as good
a team as last season. Whether it is
any better will be decided in the com
ing series.

Rice Institute, Houston, Texas,
claims the distinction of having the
smallest college freshman in the world.
Joseph Simmons, who registered at
Rice this year is less than three feet
tall. He is twenty years old, takes part
in college activities and plays a cornet
in the Rice band.
