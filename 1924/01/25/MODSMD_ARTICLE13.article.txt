STANFORD UNIVERSITY, January 26, 9:59 p. m.—-Stanford
basketball followers now know what chances Stanford will have in the
Southern section of the Pacific Coast conference. The two games with
the University of Southern California, played before audiences which
packed the pavilion bleachers, have proven just what the Cardinal team's
strength is in relation to averages of other Coast teams.
But no more than that was revealed. The five-man defense of Andy
Kerr, still unperfected, will be about twice as effective against the Bears.
Andy Kerr's substitutes will improve in the same proportion.
As a matter of percentages, the Stanford basketball team might be
said to be fairly well fixed in the column; as to the Big Series against
California, the Cardinal rooters are perfectly aware that no more can be
said than that the comparative scores of the U. S. C.-California games
mean nothing in particular, and that the present Cardinal five will be
about twice as powerful against California as it has been against the
Trojans.
