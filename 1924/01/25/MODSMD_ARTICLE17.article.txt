# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
To the editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: In view of "One Who
Doesn't Belong" vitriolic comment
upon the brazen debauchery and utter
violation of every moral ethic by the
Mechanical Engineering Society and
the Glee Club, I would like to air my
view about sue'i comments as were
perpetrated in the viewpoint of last
night's D. P. A.
Granting that if the action taken by
the Glee Club and M. E. Society was
construed to be a public initiation the
societies were guilty of breaking a uni
versity regulation. However, neither
organization made any public demon
stration or in any way interfered with
students or classes, nor was there any
thing verging upon the obscene. This,
I was careful to note. If these activi
ties were disturbing or demoralizing,
our critic's caustic denunciation might
have been partly justifiied. But as it is,
since the grapes are not sour possibly
they arc a trifle under ripe. And judg
ing from the jolly tone of his view
point it is not difficult to discover why
our critic is "One of Those Who
Doesn't Belong."
But Stanford, thank the Lord, is not
made up entirely of ultra Blase "do
nothings" who rise in righteous wrath
at the slightest departure from the
staid and conventional. *
No doubt we should feel flattered to
provoke this publicity from those whose
deep insight should, at this time, be
concentrated on the Bok Peace Plan.
However he may rest easy for the
Men's Council have taken action on
the matter and no doubt justice will be
dispensed.
Wishing our reformer an early but
inconspicuous initiation into some
thing, I am
"ONE WHO BELONGS."
