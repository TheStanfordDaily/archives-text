# HOW TO WRITE POETRY
## 
### 
The first thing to do in order to write poetry is to let your hair grow long
and shaggy. This will take several weeks or more, but th<e time is lessened by
eating lots of carrots and spinach.
After two weeks of carrots and spinach, if you still feel that you want to
write poetry, get a rhyming dictionary, pin a daisy in your buttonhole, and
begin.
The first problem that faces the young poet is what to write about. Many
prefer to get personal about their Mute Imprisoned Souls or how they fre
quently feel the Lure of the Open Road. If you want to be original, you can
pick out some flower or fruit, like cocoanuts or grapes or lemons —There we
have it! The divine flash called inspiration! We will write a pome about a
lemon.
We put down the first line:
Oh, how I love the lovely lemon!
But we look up "lemon" in the dictionary and find that—horrors! —there is
no word in English to rhym-e with it. Oranges are naturally suggested, but
we find that there are no rhymes for "orange" either. We are stumped in
the citrus line.
If the poet is really gifted, however, he will finally think of bananas. There
the true genius shows —there are lots of rhymes to be found for "bai/ana."
Let us begin in a fine frenzy:
NO, WE HAVE SOME
In some far-off Nirvana—
I do not know the name—
By the door of her zenana
Sits a beauteous sultana
Whose Christian name is Anna
Or Anne —it's all the same.
t.-v ""r *
She bites a pink banana
Nor guesses how it came
From down in old Havana
Where the men on the savannah
Clad in red and white bandana
Pursue this toothsome game.
With many a loud hosanna
They snare this fruit of fame
With a lasso of liana
From the back of an iguana
And with ipecacuanha
They dose it till it's tame.
There —you see? Our pome is complete, and maybe we can sell it, because
it isn't "free" verse this time. —G. D.

We put down the first line:
Oh, how I love the lovely lemon!
But we look up "lemon" in the dictionary and find that—horrors! —there is
no word in English to rhym-e with it. Oranges are naturally suggested, but
we find that there are no rhymes for "orange" either. We are stumped in
the citrus line.
If the poet is really gifted, however, he will finally think of bananas. There
the true genius shows —there are lots of rhymes to be found for "bai/ana."
Let us begin in a fine frenzy:
NO, WE HAVE SOME
In some far-off Nirvana—
I do not know the name—
By the door of her zenana
Sits a beauteous sultana
Whose Christian name is Anna
Or Anne —it's all the same.
t.-v ""r *
She bites a pink banana
Nor guesses how it came
From down in old Havana
Where the men on the savannah
Clad in red and white bandana
Pursue this toothsome game.
With many a loud hosanna
They snare this fruit of fame
With a lasso of liana
From the back of an iguana
And with ipecacuanha
They dose it till it's tame.
There —you see? Our pome is complete, and maybe we can sell it, because
it isn't "free" verse this time. —G. D.
