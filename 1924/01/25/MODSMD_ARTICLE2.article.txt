# OR. JORDAN OUTLINES MEDICINE SINCE 1875
## 
### 
"When I graduated in medicine in
1875 everything in the medical profes
sion was a matter of chance," said
Dr. Jordan in a talk at his home last
night.
"The germ theory did not develop
until five years later, and the common
belief was that for each disease there
was a medicine that would cure it if
it could only be found.
Only Special Diseases Curable
"Today we know that only special
diseases have specific cures. We know
also that the cures only kill the germs
causing the disease and do not repair
the damage wrought by them while
they were active.
"Methods of treatment today are
carried on by the use of serums, in
case of typhoid for instance; 'bv vac
cination, as in smallpox; and by segre
gation, for infectious diseases.
Disease Caused by Parasites
"Disease is produced by the action
of either animal or plant parasites.
Disorders of the organs and functions
can be inherited, caused by misfor
tunes, or brought on by overwork and
worry. We have disorders of the pan
creas and the thyroid.
"Poisons, acting mostly on the nerv
ous system, as in the use of alcohol,
and cocaine, may also cause disorders
of the human system.
"Science of today has a running
mate in the shadows of science, the
quacks and their methods. Men traf
ficking in the frauds of ductless glands
of sheep and in electron treatment
have grown immensely wealthy."
