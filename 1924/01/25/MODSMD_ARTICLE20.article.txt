Ernestine
Many of Ernestine's friends predict a great future for her. Some go as far
as to say that she will become President some day; but as one of the
requirements is being 35 years of age and as Ernestine will probably never
confess to being that old, we doubt it.
Ernestine says she doesn't see why they have that funny rule about not
queening on the Quad.
She needn't worry. —G. D.
