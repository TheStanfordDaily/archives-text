# APRIL 26 WILL SEE FINALE IN 3 SPORTS
## High School Stars to Compete Big Meet, Last Bear-Cardinal Baseball Game, Alumni Reunion Scheduled 
### L. W. F 
April 26, next, is set for the annual
returning of Stanford alumni to the
l'"arm, for the big game of the spring
intercollegiate baseball series, and for
the big meet of west coast dual track
and field competition; and if plans of
the authorities materialize, students may
cxpect to be participants at that time in
the greatest and most typically Stanford
celebration since the World War.
Other events are also listed for the
same date. The northern section C.I.F.
alliance will send hundreds of high
school track men to the old Stanford
oval for competition in their annual
meet , &
The day should be typically Stanford
for several reasons, hirst, it will bring
together on common footing the three
elements which make up the University—
students, faculty, and alumni. These
three factors have by close co-operation
accomplished a great many things here
which could not have been effected by
any one group alone. Witness the bas
ketball pavilion, the new Union build
ing, and the stadium for material ex
amples.
All three were made possible only by
direct energy coining separately from
the three different Stanford groups. l)e-
tails are unimportant now, but freshmen
may ask old-timers who know if they
are interested in how this was done.
April 26 should bring the three Stan
ford groups together under new circum
stances. They have been together before,
but always there was an undercurrent
of doubt and dissatisfaction, expressed
in the question, "Will Stanford teams
come back to their old power-" No
matter how well Stanford scholarship
has stood, no matter how many new
buildings may have been built, the old
interested Mr. Alumnus was never satis
tied that matters were as they should be
on the "Farm," without first finding
some student who could give him hope
of future athletic success.
The graduate KNOWS his University
is one of the greatest, that it will con
tinue to develop engineers, doctors, and
lawyers.
But he judges the type of man at
Stanford in a large way by their sports
manship on the track, gridiron, or bas
ketball court.
During past alumni days, after the
President's dinner and talk were termi
nated, after the dances and stunts were
over, more than a few visitors sought the
rooms of old hall men to get a line on
the future of Stanford teams. They
went away encouraged, but wondering if

the hope was not largely student opti
mism.
On April 26, we hope, they will not
depend on student optimism. In track
and field, and in baseball, against Cali
fornia, they will see for themselves two
powerful teams, organizations which
compare favorably with the greatest of
old, and whether these teams win or lose
from California on that day, the old
alumnus will not worry about the future
of Stanford athletes. He will see for
himself two of the finest teams which
ever represented Stanford. And, the
Lord permitting, he may see one or the
other of them win, or both.
Again, this may be only the usual op
timistic "spring editorial." But the "ones
who know" think differently at least. In
any event, the opportunity is the greatest
of many years, for where Stanford was
favored to lose in the last few seasons,
she will now be given "equal chances,"
or favored to win.
With all this in mind there is a good
opportunity for students to do good
work for the University, which in the
end is for themselves. They may begin
now in encouraging each and every
human being within their reach to visit
the University on April 26. They may
write to alumni friends, telling of the
possibilities of the day, of the oppor
tunity to be on the "Farm" with count
less other old-timers on a real Alumni
Day, and on a real undergraduate day
when California and Stanford meet in
two sports.
Keep the day in mind. Work for it.

Stanford's re-arrival has long been her- j
aided, but as yet it has never come. If it
doesn't come on April 26, it never will.
Get behind this day, use whatever think
ing power is available, help bring people
here, and help make April 26 a typical
Stanford day of the old sort, a winning
day.
Remember it—APRIL 26.
