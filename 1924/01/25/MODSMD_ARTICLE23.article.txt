# APRIL 26 WILL SEE FINALE IN 3 SPORTS
## High School Stars to Compete Big Meet, Last Bear-Cardinal Baseball Game, Alumni Reunion Scheduled 
### L. W. F 
April 26, next, is set for the annual
returning of Stanford alumni to the
l'"arm, for the big game of the spring
intercollegiate baseball series, and for
the big meet of west coast dual track
and field competition; and if plans of
the authorities materialize, students may
cxpect to be participants at that time in
the greatest and most typically Stanford
celebration since the World War.
Other events are also listed for the
same date. The northern section C.I.F.
alliance will send hundreds of high
school track men to the old Stanford
oval for competition in their annual
meet , &
The day should be typically Stanford
for several reasons, hirst, it will bring
together on common footing the three
elements which make up the University—
students, faculty, and alumni. These
three factors have by close co-operation
accomplished a great many things here
which could not have been effected by
any one group alone. Witness the bas
ketball pavilion, the new Union build
ing, and the stadium for material ex
amples.
All three were made possible only by
direct energy coining separately from
the three different Stanford groups. l)e-
