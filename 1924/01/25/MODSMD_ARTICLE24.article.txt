# Can Tied to Dog Tied to Car
## 
### 
ihe controversy seems to resolve
itself into this: when you tie up a dog,
do you tie up the dog's howl too?
Some people say you should tie up
the howl separately; others say that i
because the dog lias howls only occa- }
sionallv, he should be treated for them,
not tied up for them.
Still others think that the howl is a
part of the dog, and that when you tie
up the flog the howl is there only you
can't see it, and to keep the howl in its
place the dog should be tied fore and
att. Andy Smith says you shouldn't
tie up a dog.
From One Gentleman to Another.
You see how it is. A dog just will !
howl; only this time one day started |
two howls. Both got results, as fol- '
lows:
"To the Gentleman Who Resides in
the Old Union Who Wrote Me Con
cerning My Dog:
"The fact that you did not sign your
letter, which was left in my car, makes
it impossible for me to tell you per
sonally that I regret very much the an
noyance caused you.
"It has been only recently that I
have had to tic him in the car, as here
tofore he has sat in it quite content
edly, and I was quite unaware of his
howling.
"However, I shall sec that you are no
longer annoyed and hope some day to
have the pleasure of knowing who it
was that was kind enough to tell me
that an oversight on my part was both
ering the neighborhood of the Union.
"Yours sincerely,
"DONALD McKEE."
Sarcastic, what? However, the fol
lowing note, posted up in the Old Un
ion, at least indicates that the owner
will hereafter tie his oversight some
place else, or tie him to the muffler.
Personally, it seems a good idea to
howl at the Union. Much better than
howling at the mooti, because it's
( loser and more concrete —although
how do we know the moon isn't made
of concrete? Besides, the man in the
moon would be just as likely to com
plain as the man in the Union.
It has been suggested that the owner
either get a closed car or get a dog
with a closed howl. These howls arc
slightly more expensive, of course, but
they are much warmer and can be
opened in hot weather.
Assuming that the owner is respon
sible for the dog's howl, lie is also re
sponsible for the following letter, al- I
leged to have been written and thought j
to have been left in the machine with
the dog and the howl and the tie:
"Say. You Degraded Dab of Dehy
drated Dish-water:
"May 1 request that you take your
dog some place else to tic him, as it is
really most pathetic tto hear him cry
ing all nigh right under my window?
J am a humane man, and unless you do
something about it I shall be forced to
shoot the poor creature to put him out
of his misery.
"This I would regret to do greatly,
a- i should much prefer shooting you,
you stem-winding, sapheaded essence
of hydrogen sulfrid. If you don't key
that mutt down inside of half an hour, '
I'll bust your lousy little can into forty

sonally that I regret very much the an

"It has been only recently that I

howling.
"However, I shall sec that you are no

that an oversight on my part was both

Sarcastic, what? However, the fol
lowing note, posted up in the Old Un
ion, at least indicates that the owner
will hereafter tie his oversight some
place else, or tie him to the muffler.
Personally, it seems a good idea to
howl at the Union. Much better than
howling at the mooti, because it's
( loser and more concrete —although
how do we know the moon isn't made
of concrete? Besides, the man in the
moon would be just as likely to com
plain as the man in the Union.
It has been suggested that the owner
either get a closed car or get a dog
with a closed howl. These howls arc
slightly more expensive, of course, but
they are much warmer and can be
opened in hot weather.
Assuming that the owner is respon
sible for the dog's howl, lie is also re
sponsible for the following letter, al- I
leged to have been written and thought j
to have been left in the machine with
the dog and the howl and the tie:
"Say. You Degraded Dab of Dehy
drated Dish-water:
"May 1 request that you take your
dog some place else to tic him, as it is
really most pathetic tto hear him cry
ing all nigh right under my window?
J am a humane man, and unless you do
something about it I shall be forced to
shoot the poor creature to put him out
of his misery.
"This I would regret to do greatly,
a- i should much prefer shooting you,
you stem-winding, sapheaded essence
of hydrogen sulfrid. If you don't key
that mutt down inside of half an hour, '
I'll bust your lousy little can into forty
pieces and request that you getahell !
outa here with 'em before 1 crown ya I
with a peavv, va little piece of cheese."
ihe controversy seems to resolve
itself into this: when you tie up a dog,
do you tie up the dog's howl too?
Some people say you should tie up
the howl separately; others say that i
because the dog lias howls only occa- }
sionallv, he should be treated for them,
not tied up for them.
Still others think that the howl is a
part of the dog, and that when you tie
up the flog the howl is there only you
can't see it, and to keep the howl in its
place the dog should be tied fore and
att. Andy Smith says you shouldn't
tie up a dog.
