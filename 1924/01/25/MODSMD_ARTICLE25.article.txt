# STANFORD WILL HAVE STRONG TEAM IN EVERYTHING BUT JUMPS
## "Dink" Templeton Has Veterans In All But Three Events; Squad Is Well Balanced 
### "Dink" Templeton 
Exceptional weather has allowed
the track team to get an early start.!
I like to start the season as early as
possible. The main reason is that it
enables the men to do the heavy work
of getting into the best possible con- 1
dition, and developing the form of
their events to the greatest extent,
before the sti'ain of the competitive i
season eommences.
This means that when the regular
schedule begins, the men can take
light work-outs, rest up, and store
away the spring of the muscles for
the meets, which makes possible the
best performances in competition.
It takes two or three weeks to get
the muscles in shape to stand hard
work, and that is the

main object now.
During this time the
work is light and the
temptation great for
a fellow to let out
and see what he can
do, which is the
worst thing possible.
While doing this,
the best opportunity
is afforded for the
development of form,
for changes in form
can be made, experi
mented with, and
corrected to lay a

foundation for the season's work.
Jumpers Developing
The team will be strong on the
track and in the weights, while the
three jumps will have men who are
capable of development.
Campbell and Hale, with Gaspar in
the 100, and Miller in the 220, make
a strong team of sprinters. Campbell
ran 10 flat and 21:2 last year while!
far from fully developed.
Hale is a beautiful natural runner;
with great speed, who has been handi
capped by a muscle, pulled two years
ago. By careful work, he should be
able to build up his leg so as to com-;
pletely heal the injury.
Leistner and Boles Should Star *
Leistner and Boles give us the best j
high hurdling team since "Feg" Mur
ray and Johnny Norton in '16. Both j
have done 15:1 consistently, and one |
of them should better that this sea
son. Both are conscientious trainers i
who get the greatest enjoyment from
the work and will develop fast.
Leistner is just as good in the lows, I
while Boles will be close behind all
year. Wells, a transfer from Fresno
State College, has also been showing
up well,
With Captain Van Judah, Stories,
Mixon, Coverley, and Shermuiul will
run the quarter. Richardson will also
be available, and Scofield can be called
on for a lap in the relay.

Never before have we had such a
wealth of material for the, distances.
Dole, Daly, Swayne, and Macintosh
have all made their letters in the 880,
while Smith and Richardson have both
bettered their times as freshmen.
In the mile, Smith, Kerr, Charles,
Cypher, and Thayer are high class
men, none of whom have come close
to full development.
And in the two mile, we will hav«
Hays, Murphy, Clifford, and probably
either Kerr or Charles, staying out of
the mile to run with them.
Hartranft, Ludeke, Richards, Weights
Hartranft in the shot and discus,
with Richards and Ludeke with him
in tlva shot, and Campbell and Ludeke
in the discus, should take our share
of the points.
Harlow has returned and will throw
the javelin with Farish and Kelley.
All three should go over 180 feet.
If we are to be weak any place, it
is in the three jumps.
Scofield and Dennis are both twelve
foot pole vaulters. Scofield. particu
larly, has a wonderful chance to de
velop, as he is a natural vaulter with
great ability.
Kemnitzer and Anderson are new
men in the high jump but they are
both good prospects, and one of them
should jump six feet or better.
Macßae and Bragg both did 21:6

last fall in the broad jump. Tliey also
! are inexperienced with plenty of room
i for development.
So in these three events, there is
; a good chance of developing point
winners.
These men make up a team which
is strong in nearly every event and 1
although there are few outstanding
stars, the season's training will de
velop a good many into that class.
There will also be names prominent
ly mentioned at the close of the sea
son, not included here.
Interest is at a high pitch on the
track, and the men intend to get the
utmost of development from the sea
son's training, which means that when
time for the Big Meet comes around,
they'll be prepared.
