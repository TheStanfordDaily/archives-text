# Pianiste Refuses To Wear Evening Dress; Plays All Her Concerts On Darkened Stage
## Ethel Leginska, to Appear in Assembly Hall February 4, Believes Clothes Distract Attention From Music 
### 
Ethel Leginska—only her name is not Leginska
famous pianiste who will play in the Assembly Hall
February 4, absolutely refuses to wear evening dress.
"It's not appropriate to the concert stage," she says;
"the dress distracts attention from the music." In this
self-effacement she differs from the Stanford rough, who
also refuses formal dress.
A short skirt, a rather long, boyish coat of black
velvet, a white blouse with a turn-back collar, is her
standard of attire for stage appearances. She always
has the stage darkened, so that her small dark figure
is almost lost against the black shadow of the huge
piano.
One of the Elect
Leginska is one of the few really great pianistes in
America, and has been ranked with Paderewski in style
and technique.
A group of six violin and "cello artists of the Chamber
Music Society of San Francisco are appearing in con
junction with Leginska under the auspices of the
Peninsula Musical Association. Seats are now on sale
at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
Leginska is small, with large luminous eyes and light
coppery hair, and is NOT Russian. She was born in
Hull, England, went to Berlin for her musical educa
tion, and returned to her own country with no backing
save her own earnings.
In order to force London critics and concert managers
to recognize her ability, she had to Russianize her name.
Unlike most musicians, she cannot boast a long musi
cal ancestry, except one of her aunts who, she says,
played the piano but was not recorded for proficiency.
"Get Out!" Said the Cop
Leginska's personality and power of artistry was
proved last week to be superior to the law —at least as

exemplified by a
San Francisco po
liceman and a
nightwatchman.
Leginska was
given permission
to use a piano in
the Wylie B. Al
len- store in the
evenings, while
her own piano
was under repair.
A nightwatch
man, trying doors j
in the building, ,
heard the concert
inside, and being
a dutiful soul, or
dered her to
leave as a non
paying guest.
This she refused
to do.
The nightwatch-

man called a policeman; the two of them attempted to
persuade her gently to leave. Leginska offered to play
a piece for them first. When she got through her eve
ning's practice almost two hours later, Leginska and
the two officers left together.
