CARMEN
San Carlos Grand Opera Company
Alice Gentle, returning to San Francisco in the role
of the gypsy, Carmen —that frank, impulsive creature,
ficle and cruel —opened the San Carlos Grand Opera

Company's engagement at the
Curran theatre Monday night.
She sang with fine freedom,
leaving no weak points in her
smooth utterance and well
rounded notes.
Marie Valle as Eseamillo gave
the toreador song with a ringing
vigor and sonority, as Jose left
much to be desired in such lyric
music as that of the flower song.
The chorus seemed in dis
agreement with the conductor
and indulged in some ragged
singing. —H. N.

SIXTH POPULAR CONCERT
* * *
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
Schubert's stirring "Marche Militaire," and Grieg's
famous "Peer Gynt Suite," No. 1, introduced a program
of old favorites in the sixth popular concert of the San

Francisco Symphony Orchestra Sunday
afternoon.
To quiet the applause following the
"Peer Gynt" selection, the orchestra was
forced to repeat the last part. Stravin
sky's popular "Song of the Volga Boat
men" played exclusively on the wind in
struments, and a Russian dance, "Gopak"

from "La Foire de Sorotchintsi" by Moussorgsky (com
poser of "Moris Godounow") which makes use almost
exclusively of stringed instruments, completed the first
half of the program.
In a group of four "Old Flemish Folk Songs" arranged
by the pianist, deGreef, the first was especially notable
for its beauty, which was brought out in a par
ticularly effective manner by the violins.
Two compositions by Kreisler followed, the first, the
"Liebsleid," that entrancing Viennese waltz, in which
Mr. Persinger in a short solo gave proof of the beautiful
tone of his violin; the second, the renowned "Liebs
freud." This was the only disappointing number on the
program: the orchestra made far too heavy work of it,
beating i<? out unmercifully.
The tuneful overture to the "Gypsy Baron," a light
opera of Joliann Strauss, the famous waltz composer,
concluded the program. —A. B.
* * *
Lillian Gish in the "White Sister" is still playing to
packed houses at the Capitol. The performance of
Miss Gish is the finest in her long- career, and the
scenes of Italy, where the picture was filmed in its
entirety, provide an unusual background to her acting.
An eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in which not only an
entire village is destroyed, but also the White Sister
placed in imminent danger, brings a sensational climax.
Ronald Colman is the leading man, and ftail Kane the
cruel half-sister. It is a Henry King production—M. A. C.

The Chamber Music Society group consists of Louis
Persinger and Louis Ford, violins; Nathan Firestone,
viola; and Walter Fermer, violincello. It is under the
direction of Persinger, and is well known in bay music
circles since the foundation of the society in San Fran
cisco ten years ago.

Mr. Persinger in a short solo gave proof of the beautiful
tone of his violin; the second, the renowned "Liebs
freud." This was the only disappointing number on the
program: the orchestra made far too heavy work of it,
beating i<? out unmercifully.
The tuneful overture to the "Gypsy Baron," a light
opera of Joliann Strauss, the famous waltz composer,
concluded the program. —A. B.

Lillian Gish in the "White Sister" is still playing to
packed houses at the Capitol. The performance of
Miss Gish is the finest in her long- career, and the
scenes of Italy, where the picture was filmed in its
entirety, provide an unusual background to her acting.
An eruption of Mount Vesuvius, in which not only an
entire village is destroyed, but also the White Sister
placed in imminent danger, brings a sensational climax.
Ronald Colman is the leading man, and ftail Kane the
cruel half-sister. It is a Henry King production—M. A. C.

The Chamber Music Society group consists of Louis
Persinger and Louis Ford, violins; Nathan Firestone,
viola; and Walter Fermer, violincello. It is under the
direction of Persinger, and is well known in bay music
circles since the foundation of the society in San Fran
cisco ten years ago.


CARMEN
San Carlos Grand Opera Company
Alice Gentle, returning to San Francisco in the role
of the gypsy, Carmen —that frank, impulsive creature,
ficle and cruel —opened the San Carlos Grand Opera

Company's engagement at the
Curran theatre Monday night.
She sang with fine freedom,
leaving no weak points in her
smooth utterance and well
rounded notes.
Marie Valle as Eseamillo gave
the toreador song with a ringing
vigor and sonority, as Jose left
much to be desired in such lyric
music as that of the flower song.
The chorus seemed in dis
agreement with the conductor
and indulged in some ragged
singing. —H. N.

SIXTH POPULAR CONCERT
* * *
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
Schubert's stirring "Marche Militaire," and Grieg's
famous "Peer Gynt Suite," No. 1, introduced a program
of old favorites in the sixth popular concert of the San

Francisco Symphony Orchestra Sunday
afternoon.
To quiet the applause following the
"Peer Gynt" selection, the orchestra was
forced to repeat the last part. Stravin
sky's popular "Song of the Volga Boat
men" played exclusively on the wind in
struments, and a Russian dance, "Gopak"

from "La Foire de Sorotchintsi" by Moussorgsky (com
poser of "Moris Godounow") which makes use almost
exclusively of stringed instruments, completed the first
half of the program.
In a group of four "Old Flemish Folk Songs" arranged
by the pianist, deGreef, the first was especially notable
for its beauty, which was brought out in a par
ticularly effective manner by the violins.
Two compositions by Kreisler followed, the first, the
"Liebsleid," that entrancing Viennese waltz, in which
Mr. Persinger in a short solo gave proof of the beautiful
tone of his violin; the second, the renowned "Liebs
freud." This was the only disappointing number on the
