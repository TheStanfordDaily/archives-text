# BAKERSFIELD WINS SILVER PRIZE
## 
### 
The silver stadium trophy, offered by the Stanford alumni of California as a perpetual trophy awarded each year
to the high school football team winning the state championship, will go to Bakersfield within a few days.
The small replicas of the stadium for high school teams were instituted this year. The first, of beaten copper,
given as a perpetual trophy by the Stanford Club of San Francisco to the winning team of San Francisco was won
by Polytechnic high school.
Kenneth L. Ferguson, under the supervision of Professor A. B. Clark, made the model for these prizes. It was
reproduced in metal by Hans Joachin, sculptor of San Francisco.
Bakersfield has also received a copper stadium trophy awarded by the Stanford Club of Fresno county to
the winner of the San Joaquin Valley high school champion football team.
Both trophies are mounted through the kindness of E. J. Stanley, head of the Stanford pattern shop. The copper
stadium has a mahogany base, and the silver, a redwood burl. The idea of the trophies is being taken up by a
number of alumni clubs.
