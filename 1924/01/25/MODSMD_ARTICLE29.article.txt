(A room in the slums of Petrograd.
Destitution, degradation, stark misery.
Dumka is seated, busily rocking her
baby on the rickety table. Enter Sava

Dumka: Welcome, husband. Is there
any news?
Savajieff: Yes. Your father has been
knouted to death. Your mother has
been sent to Siberia. Your brother
will be shot at sunrise. Your whole
family is wiped out.
Dumka: "Vyell, might be worse.

The baby falls to the floor and breaks

Savajieff: There, now you have done

Dumka: Ha-ha-ha-lia! Think of it!

Savajieff: Unhappy woman, have

Savajieff: There! That restores the
prevailing atmosphere of gloom.
