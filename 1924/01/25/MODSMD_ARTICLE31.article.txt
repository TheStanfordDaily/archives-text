# SOURCE OF MEXICAN JADE UNKNOWN, SAYS PROFESSOR HOOVER
## 
### 
That the source of Mexican jade has
never been discovered was a point
of interest brought about by Professor
Theodore Hoover, head of tlve Mining
and Metallurgy department in telling
of his experiences as consulting min
ing engineer in that country.
"There are tons of Mexican jade
ornaments ni the world's museums,"
he explained. "Montezuma's tribute
rolls stipulated that the tribute of
three of the states was to be jade, but
even in these states there are no de
posits to be found. Probably the de
posits are covered with dense jungle."
One-half the population of Mexico is
pure Indian, Professor Hoover esti
mated. When the Spaniards conquered
Mexico, these Indians were still in
the stone age and they are not far
beyond that stage now. In agriculture
they use wooden plows, drawn by
oxen, and they stiil employ the brush
harrow. Their homes are equally as
primitive, with stone corn grinders
still in use.
Professor Hoover was in Mexico in
1906, during the time when Diaz was
in power. This was one of the rare
periods of peace in the republic.
Revolutions Monotonous
"I view the present crisis as mere
ly one monotonous episode in two
hundred years' continuous history,"
he remarked. "There is no reason why
these peisodes should discontinue un
less some man is found of the same
calibre as Porfirio Diaz, who for thirty
years, by virtue of his natural strength
of character, was able to hold Mexico
in a fairly steady path. During this
time she developed a fair , degree of
civilization."
Professor Hoover considers this
civilization, which lasts through one
period of peace every two hundred
years as only a veneer, with no real
depth. Any hope that Mexico may en
tertain for another peace period is
based on finding another man of Diaz's
type, and he believes these to be very
rare, coming oftener than every twen
ty gene rati tyis.

Practically all the mines of Mexico
are owned by foreigners, according to
Professor Hoover, although native la
bor is employed. The mines, which
are all over Mexico, produce chiefly
gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The
native Indians have mined little of
these substances before the coming
of the white men. Their chief inter
est was centered in obsidian, which
they used for arrow heads, in alluvial
gold and silver, and in semi-ornament
al stones.

they use wooden plows, drawn by
oxen, and they stiil employ the brush
harrow. Their homes are equally as
primitive, with stone corn grinders
still in use.
Professor Hoover was in Mexico in
1906, during the time when Diaz was
in power. This was one of the rare
periods of peace in the republic.
Revolutions Monotonous
"I view the present crisis as mere
ly one monotonous episode in two
hundred years' continuous history,"
he remarked. "There is no reason why
these peisodes should discontinue un
less some man is found of the same
calibre as Porfirio Diaz, who for thirty
years, by virtue of his natural strength
of character, was able to hold Mexico
in a fairly steady path. During this
time she developed a fair , degree of
civilization."
Professor Hoover considers this
civilization, which lasts through one
period of peace every two hundred
years as only a veneer, with no real
depth. Any hope that Mexico may en
tertain for another peace period is
based on finding another man of Diaz's
type, and he believes these to be very
rare, coming oftener than every twen
ty gene rati tyis.

Practically all the mines of Mexico
are owned by foreigners, according to
Professor Hoover, although native la
bor is employed. The mines, which
are all over Mexico, produce chiefly
gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The
native Indians have mined little of
these substances before the coming
of the white men. Their chief inter
est was centered in obsidian, which
they used for arrow heads, in alluvial
gold and silver, and in semi-ornament
al stones.
That the source of Mexican jade has
never been discovered was a point
of interest brought about by Professor
Theodore Hoover, head of tlve Mining
and Metallurgy department in telling
of his experiences as consulting min
ing engineer in that country.
"There are tons of Mexican jade
ornaments ni the world's museums,"
he explained. "Montezuma's tribute
rolls stipulated that the tribute of
three of the states was to be jade, but
even in these states there are no de
posits to be found. Probably the de
posits are covered with dense jungle."
One-half the population of Mexico is
pure Indian, Professor Hoover esti
mated. When the Spaniards conquered
Mexico, these Indians were still in
the stone age and they are not far
beyond that stage now. In agriculture
they use wooden plows, drawn by
oxen, and they stiil employ the brush
harrow. Their homes are equally as
