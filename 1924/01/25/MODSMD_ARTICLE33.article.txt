# CARDINAL CANDIDATES FOR ANERICAN OLYMPIC GAMES SQUAD WILL BE SUNS IN 5 SPORTS
## Prospects Are Good In Swimming, Rugby, Track, Wrestling, and Boxing Events 
### 
Stanford's opportunities for sending athletes to the
Olympic Games in Paris this next summer are at least
equal to those of 1920 when sixteen Cardinal trackmen
and swimmers represented the United States and made
such a significant exhibition of collegiate amateur ath
letic ability.
Three Stanford coaches, "Dink" Templeton, Harry
Maloney, and Ernie Brandsten, are already counting
noses among their stars to see what Olympic material
will represent the Cardinal for 1924.
Tryouts for the various athletic events on the Olym
piad program of 1924 will be held in different sections
of the country before July 1 and the teams selected to
go abroad will probably leave shortly after that date.
Stanford May Have Ring Tryouts
Boxing tryouts will be held in sectional competitions

and the winners of these meets will be sent to fight
for places on the team when final tryouts take place in
the East. An effort is being made to have the Pacific
Coast elimination matches at Stanford and the choice
now lies between Stanford and the Olympic Club.
These tryouts will be held in the near future and will
decide the winners of the northern California district
in both boxing and wrestling.
At least three men on the Stanford ring squad stand
an excellent chance of going with the American team,
says Coach Maloney. Earl Armbruster, a junior, was
featherweight Pacific Coast champion last year, and
with as successful a season this year should easily
represent the West in amateur competition for the
Olympic tryouts.
In the lightweight class is Jimmy Ross, who has
fought the best collegiate boxers on the Coast and
defeated them.
Brad Adams and Bill Burkliard are very fair boxers in
the welterweight class. Burkliard fought on the varsity
two years ago and won his bouts against California
and U. S. C. Adams did the fighting last year and has
considerable native ability and skill with the gloves.
Freshman Leads Middleweights
The middleweight class is ably taken care of by
Myron Schall, a freshman, who has shown greater tech
nique than has been displayed on the campus for a
number of years.
Of all these men, Schall has probably the best chance
of making the Olympic team—although Armbruster
packs a good punch, "when right."

The Cardinal's wrestling prospects
are largely based on the performances
of one man, Vaughn Hosepian, who is
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate light
weight champion. Hosepian has held
this title for three years and has
gained easy falls in all of his inter
collegiate contests.
Nicholson has done some fair wres
tling in the light heavyweight class and
Woodhead has shown some ability in
the welterweight class.
Track Not Certain
Track men, says Templeton, who

stand a chance of making the Olympic team are an
unknown quantity, with the exception of "Swede" Leist
ner, who will probably get a shot at both the hurdle

events in
Paris, and -of
"Tiny" Hart
ranft. Harold
Boles is run
ning about
even with
Leistner, and
may also re
present the
United States,
next summer.

weight man and is doing as well now as when he com
peted in the California meet two years ago. lie will
enter the shot and the discus. A1 Smith is good for the
1500-meter run, according to "Dink," who says that
Smith has never yet been forced to his limit and doesn't
know his possibilities.
The Stanford trackmen will probably go east to take
part in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Boston the first of
June and those who desire may then take out a leave of
absence and stay over for the Olympic Games track
tryouts in Boston at the N. C. A. A. meet in Chicago
June 14.
Stanford Had Half 1920 U. S. Rugby Team
In 1920 Stanford placed ten men out of twenty-three
on the rugby team. This year the Coast tryouts show
that the Cardinal players are about the strongest avail
able, with the exception of Morris Kirksey and Jack
Patrick, former Stanford stars playing for the Olympic
Club. Dick Hyland, "Scotchy" Campbell, and Norman
Cleaveland are making a good fight for places. Besides
these men, Lynn Farish and "Porky" Dwight, are also
in the running.
Stanford has little chance of placing men on the
fencing or soccer teams. In soccer, it has been decided
that the team winning the cup for the championship east
of Chicago will be sent intact to the Olympiad. The
Eastern teams have asked the western teams to furnish
funds for this strictly Eastern team.
Ralph Howe Soccer Prospect
The National Soccer Association has selected one Los
Angeles man for the team but other than that there is
no opportunity for Western men to try out. Ralph
Howe, who has played at Stanford for two years, is the
equal of any soccer player on the Coast, according to
Coach Harry Maloney, who considers him an Olympic
possibility if given a chance.
Al White to Compete With Pinkston
Clarence Pinkston was entered in high fancy and
springboard diving in' the meet in 1920 and will enter
again, this time wearing Olympic Club colors. Pinkston
won a first and second in these two events in 1920 and,
with Al White representing Stanford, should capture
the honors again for the United States.
Both men will enter in the fancy diving, springboard
fancy diving, and high plane diving. Three sophomores
show ability in diving and may get on the United
States team. Dave Fall, Wayne Smith, and L. H. Brown
are all good divers with bright prospects.
Charlie Fletcher should place for the 200-meter breast
stroke and Wallace O'Connor should make the tryouts
for the 400-meter and 1500-meter free style swims.
Water Polo Championship in Sight
These two men, with the others on the water polo
team, will make a strong bid for the American water
polo championship. The preliminaries will be held at
Sutro Baths on March 8 and the winner will go to
Chicago to enter the national, meet to determine the
Olympic Games representative.
Few of the men who represented Stanford in 1920
will go to Europe again this year. Pinkston and Kirksey
are about the only ones. "Dink" Templeton will not
go for competition and probably Norman Ross will not.
Stanford Athletes Fill Ship in 1920
The 1920 representatives, besides Ross and Pinkston,
were Kirksey and Templeton in the field events, and
John Norton and "Feg" Murray in the hurdles. "Here"
Bihlman, "Swede" Righter, Jack Patrick, Mat Hazeltine,
Dave Wallace, Charlie Doe, and "Dink" Templeton made
up the rest of the Stanford crowd playing rugby for
America.
How many men will go this year is still an undecided
question, but from the looks of the present teams the
Cardinal will not be missing when the opening shot of
the Eighth Olympic Games is heard in Paris this next
summer.

Patrick, former Stanford stars playing for the Olympic
Club. Dick Hyland, "Scotchy" Campbell, and Norman
Cleaveland are making a good fight for places. Besides
these men, Lynn Farish and "Porky" Dwight, are also
in the running.
Stanford has little chance of placing men on the
fencing or soccer teams. In soccer, it has been decided
that the team winning the cup for the championship east
of Chicago will be sent intact to the Olympiad. The
Eastern teams have asked the western teams to furnish
funds for this strictly Eastern team.
Ralph Howe Soccer Prospect
The National Soccer Association has selected one Los
Angeles man for the team but other than that there is
no opportunity for Western men to try out. Ralph
Howe, who has played at Stanford for two years, is the
equal of any soccer player on the Coast, according to
Coach Harry Maloney, who considers him an Olympic
possibility if given a chance.
Al White to Compete With Pinkston
Clarence Pinkston was entered in high fancy and
springboard diving in' the meet in 1920 and will enter
again, this time wearing Olympic Club colors. Pinkston
won a first and second in these two events in 1920 and,
with Al White representing Stanford, should capture
the honors again for the United States.
Both men will enter in the fancy diving, springboard
fancy diving, and high plane diving. Three sophomores
show ability in diving and may get on the United
States team. Dave Fall, Wayne Smith, and L. H. Brown
are all good divers with bright prospects.
Charlie Fletcher should place for the 200-meter breast
stroke and Wallace O'Connor should make the tryouts
for the 400-meter and 1500-meter free style swims.
Water Polo Championship in Sight
These two men, with the others on the water polo
team, will make a strong bid for the American water
polo championship. The preliminaries will be held at
Sutro Baths on March 8 and the winner will go to
Chicago to enter the national, meet to determine the
Olympic Games representative.
Few of the men who represented Stanford in 1920
will go to Europe again this year. Pinkston and Kirksey
are about the only ones. "Dink" Templeton will not
go for competition and probably Norman Ross will not.
Stanford Athletes Fill Ship in 1920
The 1920 representatives, besides Ross and Pinkston,
were Kirksey and Templeton in the field events, and
John Norton and "Feg" Murray in the hurdles. "Here"
Bihlman, "Swede" Righter, Jack Patrick, Mat Hazeltine,
Dave Wallace, Charlie Doe, and "Dink" Templeton made
up the rest of the Stanford crowd playing rugby for
America.
How many men will go this year is still an undecided
question, but from the looks of the present teams the
Cardinal will not be missing when the opening shot of
the Eighth Olympic Games is heard in Paris this next
summer.

Stanford's opportunities for sending athletes to the
Olympic Games in Paris this next summer are at least
equal to those of 1920 when sixteen Cardinal trackmen
and swimmers represented the United States and made
such a significant exhibition of collegiate amateur ath
letic ability.
Three Stanford coaches, "Dink" Templeton, Harry
Maloney, and Ernie Brandsten, are already counting
noses among their stars to see what Olympic material
will represent the Cardinal for 1924.
Tryouts for the various athletic events on the Olym
piad program of 1924 will be held in different sections
of the country before July 1 and the teams selected to
go abroad will probably leave shortly after that date.
Stanford May Have Ring Tryouts
Boxing tryouts will be held in sectional competitions

and the winners of these meets will be sent to fight
for places on the team when final tryouts take place in
the East. An effort is being made to have the Pacific
Coast elimination matches at Stanford and the choice
now lies between Stanford and the Olympic Club.
These tryouts will be held in the near future and will
decide the winners of the northern California district
in both boxing and wrestling.
At least three men on the Stanford ring squad stand
an excellent chance of going with the American team,
says Coach Maloney. Earl Armbruster, a junior, was
featherweight Pacific Coast champion last year, and
with as successful a season this year should easily
represent the West in amateur competition for the
Olympic tryouts.
In the lightweight class is Jimmy Ross, who has
fought the best collegiate boxers on the Coast and
defeated them.
Brad Adams and Bill Burkliard are very fair boxers in
the welterweight class. Burkliard fought on the varsity
two years ago and won his bouts against California
and U. S. C. Adams did the fighting last year and has
considerable native ability and skill with the gloves.
Freshman Leads Middleweights
The middleweight class is ably taken care of by
Myron Schall, a freshman, who has shown greater tech
nique than has been displayed on the campus for a
number of years.
Of all these men, Schall has probably the best chance
of making the Olympic team—although Armbruster
packs a good punch, "when right."

The Cardinal's wrestling prospects
are largely based on the performances
of one man, Vaughn Hosepian, who is
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate light
weight champion. Hosepian has held
this title for three years and has
gained easy falls in all of his inter
collegiate contests.
Nicholson has done some fair wres
tling in the light heavyweight class and
Woodhead has shown some ability in
the welterweight class.
Track Not Certain
Track men, says Templeton, who

stand a chance of making the Olympic team are an
unknown quantity, with the exception of "Swede" Leist
ner, who will probably get a shot at both the hurdle

events in
Paris, and -of
"Tiny" Hart
ranft. Harold
Boles is run

even with
Leistner, and
may also re

United States,
next summer.

enter the shot and the discus. A1 Smith is good for the
1500-meter run, according to "Dink," who says that
Smith has never yet been forced to his limit and doesn't
know his possibilities.
The Stanford trackmen will probably go east to take
part in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Boston the first of
June and those who desire may then take out a leave of
absence and stay over for the Olympic Games track
tryouts in Boston at the N. C. A. A. meet in Chicago
June 14.

In 1920 Stanford placed ten men out of twenty-three

At least three men on the Stanford ring squad stand
an excellent chance of going with the American team,
says Coach Maloney. Earl Armbruster, a junior, was
featherweight Pacific Coast champion last year, and
with as successful a season this year should easily
represent the West in amateur competition for the
Olympic tryouts.
In the lightweight class is Jimmy Ross, who has
fought the best collegiate boxers on the Coast and
defeated them.
Brad Adams and Bill Burkliard are very fair boxers in
the welterweight class. Burkliard fought on the varsity
two years ago and won his bouts against California
and U. S. C. Adams did the fighting last year and has
considerable native ability and skill with the gloves.
Freshman Leads Middleweights
The middleweight class is ably taken care of by
Myron Schall, a freshman, who has shown greater tech
nique than has been displayed on the campus for a
number of years.
Of all these men, Schall has probably the best chance
of making the Olympic team—although Armbruster
packs a good punch, "when right."

The Cardinal's wrestling prospects
are largely based on the performances
of one man, Vaughn Hosepian, who is
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate light
weight champion. Hosepian has held
this title for three years and has
gained easy falls in all of his inter
collegiate contests.
Nicholson has done some fair wres
tling in the light heavyweight class and
Woodhead has shown some ability in
the welterweight class.
Track Not Certain
Track men, says Templeton, who

stand a chance of making the Olympic team are an
unknown quantity, with the exception of "Swede" Leist
ner, who will probably get a shot at both the hurdle

events in
Paris, and -of
"Tiny" Hart
ranft. Harold
Boles is run
ning about
even with
Leistner, and
may also re
present the
United States,
next summer.

weight man and is doing as well now as when he com
peted in the California meet two years ago. lie will
enter the shot and the discus. A1 Smith is good for the
1500-meter run, according to "Dink," who says that
Smith has never yet been forced to his limit and doesn't
know his possibilities.
The Stanford trackmen will probably go east to take
part in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Boston the first of
June and those who desire may then take out a leave of
absence and stay over for the Olympic Games track
tryouts in Boston at the N. C. A. A. meet in Chicago
June 14.
Stanford Had Half 1920 U. S. Rugby Team
In 1920 Stanford placed ten men out of twenty-three
on the rugby team. This year the Coast tryouts show
that the Cardinal players are about the strongest avail
able, with the exception of Morris Kirksey and Jack
Patrick, former Stanford stars playing for the Olympic
Club. Dick Hyland, "Scotchy" Campbell, and Norman
Cleaveland are making a good fight for places. Besides
these men, Lynn Farish and "Porky" Dwight, are also
in the running.
Stanford has little chance of placing men on the
fencing or soccer teams. In soccer, it has been decided
that the team winning the cup for the championship east
of Chicago will be sent intact to the Olympiad. The
Eastern teams have asked the western teams to furnish
funds for this strictly Eastern team.
Ralph Howe Soccer Prospect
The National Soccer Association has selected one Los
Angeles man for the team but other than that there is
no opportunity for Western men to try out. Ralph
Howe, who has played at Stanford for two years, is the
equal of any soccer player on the Coast, according to
Coach Harry Maloney, who considers him an Olympic
possibility if given a chance.
Al White to Compete With Pinkston
Clarence Pinkston was entered in high fancy and
springboard diving in' the meet in 1920 and will enter
again, this time wearing Olympic Club colors. Pinkston
won a first and second in these two events in 1920 and,
with Al White representing Stanford, should capture
the honors again for the United States.
Both men will enter in the fancy diving, springboard
fancy diving, and high plane diving. Three sophomores
show ability in diving and may get on the United
States team. Dave Fall, Wayne Smith, and L. H. Brown
are all good divers with bright prospects.
Charlie Fletcher should place for the 200-meter breast
stroke and Wallace O'Connor should make the tryouts
for the 400-meter and 1500-meter free style swims.
Water Polo Championship in Sight
These two men, with the others on the water polo
team, will make a strong bid for the American water
polo championship. The preliminaries will be held at
Sutro Baths on March 8 and the winner will go to
Chicago to enter the national, meet to determine the
Olympic Games representative.
Few of the men who represented Stanford in 1920
will go to Europe again this year. Pinkston and Kirksey
are about the only ones. "Dink" Templeton will not
go for competition and probably Norman Ross will not.
Stanford Athletes Fill Ship in 1920
The 1920 representatives, besides Ross and Pinkston,
were Kirksey and Templeton in the field events, and
John Norton and "Feg" Murray in the hurdles. "Here"
Bihlman, "Swede" Righter, Jack Patrick, Mat Hazeltine,
Dave Wallace, Charlie Doe, and "Dink" Templeton made
up the rest of the Stanford crowd playing rugby for
America.
How many men will go this year is still an undecided
question, but from the looks of the present teams the
Cardinal will not be missing when the opening shot of
the Eighth Olympic Games is heard in Paris this next
summer.

Woodhead and Nicholson
Stanford's opportunities for sending athletes to the
Olympic Games in Paris this next summer are at least
equal to those of 1920 when sixteen Cardinal trackmen
and swimmers represented the United States and made
such a significant exhibition of collegiate amateur ath
letic ability.
Three Stanford coaches, "Dink" Templeton, Harry
Maloney, and Ernie Brandsten, are already counting
noses among their stars to see what Olympic material
will represent the Cardinal for 1924.
Tryouts for the various athletic events on the Olym
piad program of 1924 will be held in different sections
of the country before July 1 and the teams selected to
go abroad will probably leave shortly after that date.
Stanford May Have Ring Tryouts
Boxing tryouts will be held in sectional competitions

and the winners of these meets will be sent to fight
for places on the team when final tryouts take place in
the East. An effort is being made to have the Pacific
Coast elimination matches at Stanford and the choice
now lies between Stanford and the Olympic Club.
These tryouts will be held in the near future and will
decide the winners of the northern California district
in both boxing and wrestling.

Both men will enter in the fancy diving, springboard
fancy diving, and high plane diving. Three sophomores
show ability in diving and may get on the United
States team. Dave Fall, Wayne Smith, and L. H. Brown
are all good divers with bright prospects.
Charlie Fletcher should place for the 200-meter breast
stroke and Wallace O'Connor should make the tryouts
for the 400-meter and 1500-meter free style swims.
Water Polo Championship in Sight
These two men, with the others on the water polo
team, will make a strong bid for the American water
polo championship. The preliminaries will be held at
Sutro Baths on March 8 and the winner will go to
Chicago to enter the national, meet to determine the
Olympic Games representative.
Few of the men who represented Stanford in 1920
will go to Europe again this year. Pinkston and Kirksey
are about the only ones. "Dink" Templeton will not
go for competition and probably Norman Ross will not.
Stanford Athletes Fill Ship in 1920
The 1920 representatives, besides Ross and Pinkston,
were Kirksey and Templeton in the field events, and
John Norton and "Feg" Murray in the hurdles. "Here"
Bihlman, "Swede" Righter, Jack Patrick, Mat Hazeltine,
Dave Wallace, Charlie Doe, and "Dink" Templeton made
up the rest of the Stanford crowd playing rugby for
America.
How many men will go this year is still an undecided
question, but from the looks of the present teams the
Cardinal will not be missing when the opening shot of
the Eighth Olympic Games is heard in Paris this next
summer.

Stanford's opportunities for sending athletes to the
Olympic Games in Paris this next summer are at least
equal to those of 1920 when sixteen Cardinal trackmen
and swimmers represented the United States and made
such a significant exhibition of collegiate amateur ath
letic ability.
Three Stanford coaches, "Dink" Templeton, Harry
Maloney, and Ernie Brandsten, are already counting
noses among their stars to see what Olympic material
will represent the Cardinal for 1924.
Tryouts for the various athletic events on the Olym
piad program of 1924 will be held in different sections
of the country before July 1 and the teams selected to
go abroad will probably leave shortly after that date.
Stanford May Have Ring Tryouts
Boxing tryouts will be held in sectional competitions

and the winners of these meets will be sent to fight
for places on the team when final tryouts take place in
the East. An effort is being made to have the Pacific
Coast elimination matches at Stanford and the choice
now lies between Stanford and the Olympic Club.
These tryouts will be held in the near future and will
decide the winners of the northern California district
in both boxing and wrestling.
At least three men on the Stanford ring squad stand
an excellent chance of going with the American team,
says Coach Maloney. Earl Armbruster, a junior, was
featherweight Pacific Coast champion last year, and
with as successful a season this year should easily
represent the West in amateur competition for the
Olympic tryouts.
In the lightweight class is Jimmy Ross, who has
fought the best collegiate boxers on the Coast and
defeated them.
Brad Adams and Bill Burkliard are very fair boxers in
the welterweight class. Burkliard fought on the varsity
two years ago and won his bouts against California
and U. S. C. Adams did the fighting last year and has
considerable native ability and skill with the gloves.
Freshman Leads Middleweights
The middleweight class is ably taken care of by
Myron Schall, a freshman, who has shown greater tech
nique than has been displayed on the campus for a
number of years.
Of all these men, Schall has probably the best chance
of making the Olympic team—although Armbruster
packs a good punch, "when right."

The Cardinal's wrestling prospects
are largely based on the performances
of one man, Vaughn Hosepian, who is
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate light
weight champion. Hosepian has held
this title for three years and has
gained easy falls in all of his inter
collegiate contests.
Nicholson has done some fair wres
tling in the light heavyweight class and
Woodhead has shown some ability in
the welterweight class.
Track Not Certain
Track men, says Templeton, who

stand a chance of making the Olympic team are an
unknown quantity, with the exception of "Swede" Leist
ner, who will probably get a shot at both the hurdle

events in
Paris, and -of
"Tiny" Hart
ranft. Harold
Boles is run
ning about
even with
Leistner, and
may also re
present the
United States,
next summer.

weight man and is doing as well now as when he com
peted in the California meet two years ago. lie will
enter the shot and the discus. A1 Smith is good for the
1500-meter run, according to "Dink," who says that
Smith has never yet been forced to his limit and doesn't
know his possibilities.
The Stanford trackmen will probably go east to take
part in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Boston the first of
June and those who desire may then take out a leave of
absence and stay over for the Olympic Games track
tryouts in Boston at the N. C. A. A. meet in Chicago
June 14.
Stanford Had Half 1920 U. S. Rugby Team
In 1920 Stanford placed ten men out of twenty-three
on the rugby team. This year the Coast tryouts show
that the Cardinal players are about the strongest avail
able, with the exception of Morris Kirksey and Jack
Patrick, former Stanford stars playing for the Olympic
Club. Dick Hyland, "Scotchy" Campbell, and Norman
Cleaveland are making a good fight for places. Besides
these men, Lynn Farish and "Porky" Dwight, are also
in the running.
Stanford has little chance of placing men on the
fencing or soccer teams. In soccer, it has been decided
that the team winning the cup for the championship east
of Chicago will be sent intact to the Olympiad. The
Eastern teams have asked the western teams to furnish
funds for this strictly Eastern team.
Ralph Howe Soccer Prospect
The National Soccer Association has selected one Los
Angeles man for the team but other than that there is
no opportunity for Western men to try out. Ralph
Howe, who has played at Stanford for two years, is the
equal of any soccer player on the Coast, according to
Coach Harry Maloney, who considers him an Olympic
possibility if given a chance.
Al White to Compete With Pinkston
Clarence Pinkston was entered in high fancy and
springboard diving in' the meet in 1920 and will enter
again, this time wearing Olympic Club colors. Pinkston
won a first and second in these two events in 1920 and,
with Al White representing Stanford, should capture
the honors again for the United States.
Both men will enter in the fancy diving, springboard
fancy diving, and high plane diving. Three sophomores
