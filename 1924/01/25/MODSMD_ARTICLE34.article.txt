### Homer S. Bodley 
Revell & Company, $1.75
"And still they wondered, and the
wonder grew
That one small head could carry all
he knew."
In this matter-of-fact day of ours
when we are so apt to take things for
granted without realizing their value
or their purpose in the divine scheme,
it takes a book like the "Fourth R" to
bring "s to a full realization.
What a marshaling of facts are here,
what divine inspiration to be able to
see the goodness of God depicted even
in the most minute detail of the uni
verse! What deep thought and what

profound conclusions are in this book!
We need but cite one illustration:
"Without water the great western
hemisphere might have remained un
discovered to this day."
Mr. Bodley is not only a deep
thinker but also a great student,
colour, geology, music, agriculture,
Would you know aught of astronomy,
the mind, dress, chemistry, or English
composition, read this book. It is all
here —that is, all except a discussion
of the similarity in characteristics be
tween the beetle and man.—M. S. R.
