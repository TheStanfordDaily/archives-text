# "THE WOMAN OF KNOCKALOE"
## 
### Hall Caine 
"Love is strong as death; Jealousy
is cruel as the grave—many waters
cannot quench love, neither cdn the
floods drown it," quotes Hall Caine in
beginning his new novel, "The Wo

man of Knockaloe." The famous old
biblical lines are the theme of the
story, a story that is a parable directed
against war.
It is a book distinctly diffehent from
most of Caine's books. It is short.

very short. Nothing more than a bro
ken series of scenes, some vague,
some vivid, it goes down to the dregs
of racial hatered left by the Great
War. On the Isle of Man a native girl,
at first hating everything German,
grows to love a prisoner in an intern
ment camp. The war ends and the
lovers hope to marry, but they find a
war-embittered world is closed to
them. There comes a solution that
is a sacrifice —and a plea for univer
sal peace.—M. C. C.
