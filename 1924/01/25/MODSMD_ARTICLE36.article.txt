# HETCH-HETCHY AND CALAVERAS PROJECTS WILL ASSURE WATER
## 
### 
Stanford's future water supply is
practically insured against shortage;
by the Calaveras and Hetch-Hetcliy
projects, according to Comptroller
A. E. Roth.
The recent report of Charles It. Lee, i
consulting engineer, regarding the
eventual shortage of water supply (
from local sources has been a well-|
known fact for several years.
The report, in 1920, of Tibbetts and
Keiffer, civil engineers,"acting under
the direction of the Santa Clara
Water Conservation Committee, pre
sented the following facts:
"In 1917 a permamnent decline of
the water plane began, owing to the
fact that the demand for water then
began to exceed the natural supply.
Since that date there lias been an
average annual permanent drop of
four to five feet. The maximum de-;
mand for water will be reached at the
end of the next decade and the perma-.
nent drop in tlie water plane then, no
doubt, will increase to approximately
six feet per annum.
Two Reservoirs to Be on Campus
"By means of the construction of
seventeen reservoirs, sites for two of
which are located on the Stanford
property, it will be possible to con
serve enough of the run-off to meet f
the ultimate maximum demands of
the Santa Clara Valley. At the present
time about G3 per cent of the run-off
is wasted.
"The requirements of urban com
munities are found to be almost
identical with those for orchard tracts, j
the former being about 1.31 acre feet !
per year, the latter atumt 1.25 per
acre feet per year. The continued
lowering of the water plane has in-1
creased the cost of pumping the TJni
versity domestic water supply, and
is a matter of considerable concern. j
New Wells Being Drilled
The University, in conjunction with
the Geology department, is at present
engaged in sounding wells for the in
crease of the local supply. A well
drilled near the county road in 1920
proved a disappointment because of
the rapidly lowering water levels in
the gravel beds underlying the county.
Pipe line for the Calveras project is
now being laid near Redwood City.
The line will be finished in about two
years. Stanford will use this supply
to supplement its present water sys
tem.
"I understand that the Hetch-
Hetcliy grant specifies that the bay
counties may participate in the sup
ply," says Roth. "Stanford will prob
ably make use of it."
However, the Hetch-Hetcliy will not
be finished until about 1928.

Two Reservoirs to Be on Campus
"By means of the construction of
seventeen reservoirs, sites for two of
which are located on the Stanford
property, it will be possible to con
serve enough of the run-off to meet f
the ultimate maximum demands of
the Santa Clara Valley. At the present
time about G3 per cent of the run-off
is wasted.
"The requirements of urban com
munities are found to be almost
identical with those for orchard tracts, j
the former being about 1.31 acre feet !
per year, the latter atumt 1.25 per
acre feet per year. The continued
lowering of the water plane has in-1
creased the cost of pumping the TJni
versity domestic water supply, and
is a matter of considerable concern. j
New Wells Being Drilled
The University, in conjunction with
the Geology department, is at present
engaged in sounding wells for the in
crease of the local supply. A well
drilled near the county road in 1920
proved a disappointment because of
the rapidly lowering water levels in
the gravel beds underlying the county.
Pipe line for the Calveras project is
now being laid near Redwood City.
The line will be finished in about two
years. Stanford will use this supply
to supplement its present water sys
tem.
"I understand that the Hetch-
Hetcliy grant specifies that the bay
counties may participate in the sup
ply," says Roth. "Stanford will prob
ably make use of it."
However, the Hetch-Hetcliy will not
be finished until about 1928.
Stanford's future water supply is
practically insured against shortage;
by the Calaveras and Hetch-Hetcliy
projects, according to Comptroller
A. E. Roth.
The recent report of Charles It. Lee, i
consulting engineer, regarding the
eventual shortage of water supply (
from local sources has been a well-|
known fact for several years.
The report, in 1920, of Tibbetts and
Keiffer, civil engineers,"acting under
the direction of the Santa Clara
Water Conservation Committee, pre
sented the following facts:
"In 1917 a permamnent decline of
the water plane began, owing to the
fact that the demand for water then
began to exceed the natural supply.
Since that date there lias been an
average annual permanent drop of
four to five feet. The maximum de-;
mand for water will be reached at the
end of the next decade and the perma-.
nent drop in tlie water plane then, no
doubt, will increase to approximately
six feet per annum.
