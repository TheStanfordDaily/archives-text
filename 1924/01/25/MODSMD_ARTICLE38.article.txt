# CALIFORNIANS ARE SOFT-SPOKEN, SAYS NOTED PHILOLOGIST

A great deal of the quality of speech
depends on temper, character of mind,
and manners, according to Professor
G. D. Krapp, visiting professor from
Columbia, and noted philologist, who
declared that he was struck by the gen
tleness of manner in the use of the
voice here.
"In New York, people tend toward a
strident speech," he explained. "They
have to contend with the noises of the

city, and are continually thrown up
against a rough type of people. This
makes them naturally assume an of
fensive and defensive attitude in
speech."
"People say that Californians have an
accent like that of New Kngland," he
remarked. "This is not true,' in the
New England which one thinks of as
including eastern Massachusetts. The
Italian 'a' which New Knglanders use
in pronouncing 'not' like 'nought,' is
not found in California. I have no
ticed, however, that many persons here
use a broad 'a', saying 'garden' as if it
were spelled 'Gordon.' Near Philadel
phia the same type of speech is em
ployed."
