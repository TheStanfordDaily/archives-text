# CARD NINE WILL BE STRONG
## Coach Wolter Has Squad of Veterans, Backed by '26 Pitching Staff 
### 
Judging from the showing made
Wednesday against Cliff Ireland's In
dependents, the 1924 Cardinal base
ball varsity is as strong on the field
as it is on paper. This practically as
sures a winning season unless un
expected events intervene and upset
the outlook.
The Cards showed up better than
Ireland's assortment of professionals

throughout the game, save for their
.inability to come through in a pinch
with hits that meant runs. The last
frame was enough to erase memory of
that early failing, anil incidentally
furnished as thrilling a moment as
could be found ir any Boys' Library.
In the field, Stanford was slightly
superior from first to last, and pounded
the ball for eight bingl-es to six for
the Irelands.
"Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man, hit
safely three out of five times at bat,
and scored one of the runs after beat
ing out a fumbled grounder to O'Brien.
Roberts looks better than ever on the
field, and the keystone combination
of Roberts and Mulchay seems good
for another year or so. Mulchay at
shortstop made three of his spectacu
lar stops and covered his position
faultlessly. His chief weaknesses at
present are a tendency to throw wide
to first base, and his old trouble at
the bat. Once on the paths he is a
dangerous base-runner.
Cuddeback, another member of the
championship 1925 Babe nine, will be
very nearly a fixture at third. "Cuddy"
is a ballplayer from his shoes up, and
his peg across the diamond is a hard
one to beat. He is a good man with
the willow, and his chatter goes a
long way toward keeping the infield
pepped up.
"Chuck" Johnston is something of a
utility man, performing equally well
behind the mask, at first, 01* in the
outfield. Coach Wolter has Captain
Patterson, Jim Lawson, and Wood
ward to take care of the infield berths,
and is using Johnston in the gardens
at present. The famous four-bagger
and a single to boot indicate reasons
for his presence in the line-up, and
lie is a reliable man on a fly-ball.
McCandless, in right field, staged
a weird stunt Wednesday when he
dumped a Texas Leaguer in the cen
ter of the infield, and made first on a
perfectly air-tight single. He is long,
rangy, and fast, and covers plenty of
ground in the outfield.
Jim Lawson seems to have rounded
into fairly good form a bit earlier
than Wolter's other catchers, though
he, and the rest of the team, have a

long way to go and plenty of time j
to get there. Lawson Is a brainy catch
er with a snappy peg to second and
plenty of ability with the willow.
Woodward is back at first base, with
his old consistent fielding and bat
ting. He is the cleverest base-runner
on the squad, and may be depended
on to take as much as the play allows.
He drew his usup l hit and walk in
the Ireland game.
The pitching staff should not be as
shaky as last year's. Teague, Solomon,
and Loewenstein are back on the job,
backed up by Oviatt, Ditzler, and
later Nevers of the 1926 Babe nine.
Teague has been slow in rounding into
shape, and none of the men have
opened up with anything like their
mid-season ability. Oviatt, though
nervous and pitching against the
breaks, did very well on Wednesday.
He had tough luck in working the
corners, and had a bit of early-season
wildness, but holding a professional
team to half a dozen bingles is not
even half bad.
Solomon and Loewenstein, as fast
and slow ball artists, will be effective
later in suiting the style of pitching
to the slugging eccentricities of the
opposition. Ditzler, who pitched near
ly every game early in the* freshman
season last year, will probably get a
chance to parade his slants before
long, and Nevers will be added to the
list after the close of the basketball
season.

dangerous base-runner.
Cuddeback, another member of the
championship 1925 Babe nine, will be
very nearly a fixture at third. "Cuddy"
is a ballplayer from his shoes up, and
his peg across the diamond is a hard
one to beat. He is a good man with
the willow, and his chatter goes a
long way toward keeping the infield
pepped up.
"Chuck" Johnston is something of a
utility man, performing equally well
behind the mask, at first, 01* in the
outfield. Coach Wolter has Captain
Patterson, Jim Lawson, and Wood
ward to take care of the infield berths,
and is using Johnston in the gardens
at present. The famous four-bagger
and a single to boot indicate reasons
for his presence in the line-up, and
lie is a reliable man on a fly-ball.
McCandless, in right field, staged
a weird stunt Wednesday when he
dumped a Texas Leaguer in the cen
ter of the infield, and made first on a
perfectly air-tight single. He is long,
rangy, and fast, and covers plenty of
ground in the outfield.
Jim Lawson seems to have rounded
into fairly good form a bit earlier
than Wolter's other catchers, though
he, and the rest of the team, have a

long way to go and plenty of time j
to get there. Lawson Is a brainy catch
er with a snappy peg to second and
plenty of ability with the willow.
Woodward is back at first base, with
his old consistent fielding and bat
ting. He is the cleverest base-runner
on the squad, and may be depended
on to take as much as the play allows.
He drew his usup l hit and walk in
the Ireland game.
The pitching staff should not be as
shaky as last year's. Teague, Solomon,
and Loewenstein are back on the job,
backed up by Oviatt, Ditzler, and
later Nevers of the 1926 Babe nine.
Teague has been slow in rounding into
shape, and none of the men have
opened up with anything like their
mid-season ability. Oviatt, though
nervous and pitching against the
breaks, did very well on Wednesday.
He had tough luck in working the
corners, and had a bit of early-season
wildness, but holding a professional
team to half a dozen bingles is not
even half bad.
Solomon and Loewenstein, as fast
and slow ball artists, will be effective
later in suiting the style of pitching
to the slugging eccentricities of the
opposition. Ditzler, who pitched near
ly every game early in the* freshman
season last year, will probably get a
chance to parade his slants before
long, and Nevers will be added to the
list after the close of the basketball
season.

ball team, back in uniform after a

Judging from the showing made
Wednesday against Cliff Ireland's In
dependents, the 1924 Cardinal base
ball varsity is as strong on the field
as it is on paper. This practically as
sures a winning season unless un
expected events intervene and upset
the outlook.
The Cards showed up better than
Ireland's assortment of professionals

throughout the game, save for their
.inability to come through in a pinch
with hits that meant runs. The last
frame was enough to erase memory of
that early failing, anil incidentally
furnished as thrilling a moment as
could be found ir any Boys' Library.
In the field, Stanford was slightly
superior from first to last, and pounded
the ball for eight bingl-es to six for
the Irelands.
"Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man, hit
safely three out of five times at bat,
and scored one of the runs after beat
ing out a fumbled grounder to O'Brien.
Roberts looks better than ever on the
field, and the keystone combination
of Roberts and Mulchay seems good
for another year or so. Mulchay at
shortstop made three of his spectacu
lar stops and covered his position
faultlessly. His chief weaknesses at
present are a tendency to throw wide
to first base, and his old trouble at
the bat. Once on the paths he is a
dangerous base-runner.

to get there. Lawson Is a brainy catch
er with a snappy peg to second and
plenty of ability with the willow.
Woodward is back at first base, with
his old consistent fielding and bat
ting. He is the cleverest base-runner
on the squad, and may be depended
on to take as much as the play allows.
He drew his usup l hit and walk in
the Ireland game.
The pitching staff should not be as
shaky as last year's. Teague, Solomon,
and Loewenstein are back on the job,
backed up by Oviatt, Ditzler, and
later Nevers of the 1926 Babe nine.
Teague has been slow in rounding into
shape, and none of the men have
opened up with anything like their
mid-season ability. Oviatt, though
nervous and pitching against the
breaks, did very well on Wednesday.
He had tough luck in working the
corners, and had a bit of early-season
wildness, but holding a professional
team to half a dozen bingles is not
even half bad.
Solomon and Loewenstein, as fast
and slow ball artists, will be effective
later in suiting the style of pitching
to the slugging eccentricities of the
opposition. Ditzler, who pitched near
ly every game early in the* freshman
season last year, will probably get a
chance to parade his slants before
long, and Nevers will be added to the
list after the close of the basketball
season.


Ed Patterson, captain of this year's
ball team, back in uniform after a
year's absence from the diamond.


"Bud" Woodward, hard-hitting in
fielder, who can cover the first or
third gunnysack equally well.
Judging from the showing made
Wednesday against Cliff Ireland's In
dependents, the 1924 Cardinal base
ball varsity is as strong on the field
as it is on paper. This practically as
sures a winning season unless un
expected events intervene and upset
the outlook.
The Cards showed up better than
Ireland's assortment of professionals

throughout the game, save for their
.inability to come through in a pinch
with hits that meant runs. The last
frame was enough to erase memory of
that early failing, anil incidentally
furnished as thrilling a moment as
could be found ir any Boys' Library.
In the field, Stanford was slightly
superior from first to last, and pounded
the ball for eight bingl-es to six for
the Irelands.
"Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man, hit
safely three out of five times at bat,
and scored one of the runs after beat
ing out a fumbled grounder to O'Brien.
Roberts looks better than ever on the
field, and the keystone combination
of Roberts and Mulchay seems good
for another year or so. Mulchay at
shortstop made three of his spectacu
lar stops and covered his position
faultlessly. His chief weaknesses at
present are a tendency to throw wide
to first base, and his old trouble at
the bat. Once on the paths he is a
dangerous base-runner.
Cuddeback, another member of the
championship 1925 Babe nine, will be
very nearly a fixture at third. "Cuddy"
is a ballplayer from his shoes up, and
his peg across the diamond is a hard
one to beat. He is a good man with
the willow, and his chatter goes a
long way toward keeping the infield
pepped up.
"Chuck" Johnston is something of a
utility man, performing equally well
behind the mask, at first, 01* in the
outfield. Coach Wolter has Captain
Patterson, Jim Lawson, and Wood
ward to take care of the infield berths,
and is using Johnston in the gardens
at present. The famous four-bagger
and a single to boot indicate reasons
for his presence in the line-up, and
lie is a reliable man on a fly-ball.
McCandless, in right field, staged
a weird stunt Wednesday when he
dumped a Texas Leaguer in the cen
ter of the infield, and made first on a
perfectly air-tight single. He is long,
rangy, and fast, and covers plenty of
ground in the outfield.
Jim Lawson seems to have rounded
into fairly good form a bit earlier
than Wolter's other catchers, though
he, and the rest of the team, have a

long way to go and plenty of time j
to get there. Lawson Is a brainy catch
er with a snappy peg to second and
plenty of ability with the willow.
Woodward is back at first base, with
his old consistent fielding and bat
ting. He is the cleverest base-runner
on the squad, and may be depended
on to take as much as the play allows.
