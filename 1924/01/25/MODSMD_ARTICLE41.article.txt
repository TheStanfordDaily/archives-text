cently, the four men who composed
Dr. Henry David Gray's Round Table ]
group in 1908-9 while attending Stan- ;
ford, were working together doing the |
editorial writing for the Globe, help-'
ing formulate public opinion, and being j

manager of the department, and his!
Co-workers were Frank E. Hill, '11,
Robert L. Duffus, '10, and Maxwell
Anderson, '09.
The group has scattered now, and j
Bliven is one of the editors of the i
"New Republic," and travels about do- j
ing special investigation work for the
paper. He is engaged in other writing, ;
and had an article, "Our Changing
Journalism," in the December issue of
the "Atlantic Monthly."

the New York Sun, besides being co- 1
editor of the "Measure," a magazine of 1

a prize for poetry in the "Nation." j
From a special poetry edition of the I
"New Republic," in which some of ,
Hill's work appeared, several poems j
