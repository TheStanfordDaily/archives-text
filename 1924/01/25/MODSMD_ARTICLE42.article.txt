Coach Andrew Kerr and Captain
"Nip" McHose have accomplished a dis
tinct achievement in basketball. Start
ing the season with little veteran ma
terial and with prospects far from prom
ising, they have developed both indi
vidual and team play, as a result of

which Stanford enters the University
of Southern California contest tonight
with odds neither way.
Coach Kerr with uncanny accuracy hit
on the right five-man combination at
the very first of the season. All of the

men of his choice have "come through."
Improvement in team play, advance
ment on the part of each team member,
and better shooting among all the men
of the squad account for the increased
power.
Ihe work of Captain McHose is now
50 per cent better than it was at the first
of the season, and it is 100 per cent bet
ter than last year. While there were
many errors noted in his early-season
game, critics now find little not in his
favor now. He is less deliberate, he
never gets caught, and his shooting from
difficult positions has made him high
point man of most of the games.
Mcßurney's development at running
guard has been the greatest single fac
tor in the improved strength of Coach
Kerr's men. At the first of the season
Mcßurney was a stand-off with several
other candidates, but he has coine ahead
so fast that there is now no doubt about
his permanent position at running guard.
His shooting has improved with his floor
work.
Since the first games, Dave Oliva
changed tactics, and in the last two en
counters, during which not a personal
foul was called against him, he looked
great. He lias stayed pretty well under
his own basket, and has allowed very
few offensive plays to get past him.
Much was expected of Steele and
Nevers, and both have lived up to ex
pectations. Nevers has gone a long


One of the big men on the Stanford
court —Ernie Nevers, who with Dave
Oliva forms the heavyweight combina
tion on Andy Kerr's five-man defense.
