## Famous Guys Who Golfâ€”No. 2 Arnold Statz 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There may be better ball players than Arnold Statz, but there certainly
aren't any better golfers among the ball players. Recently at the San Gabriel
club, near Los Angeles, Statz set a new amateur and professional record for
the course by shooting a sizzling 67, five strokes better than par. Statz had
seven birdies, and if he ever gets tired of playing lead-off man for the Cubs,
he ought to be able to knock down a few pennies as a pro golfer.
Statz learned the ins and outs of golf at Worcester, Mass., where he was
employed as a caddy at the tender age of thirteen. He later became an ardent
follower of the elusive pill on the municipal course of his home town, and
now, while golf is only his recreation, he is v the best golfer in baseball.
A year ago Statz competed in the California amateur championship, regis
tering a seventy in the finals and losing only to the famous Fred Wright.
Statz does not think that golf hurts his baseball, but he does not play during
the ball season, as he says the two games are too much for a person to attempt
at the same time. Have you seen Jigger cavort around center field in the
Cubs park? But say, you ought to see him drive the old golf ball!
