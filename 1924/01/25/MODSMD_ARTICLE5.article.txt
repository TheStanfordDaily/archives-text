# VARSITY NINE WILL PLAY INDEPENDENTS AT 2:30 TOMORROW
## Wolter Plans to Use Same Team, With Ditzler or Solomon Pitching 
### 
Cliff Ireland and his minor league
aggregation will arrive on the campus
tomorrow in time for the second game
of the series with Stanford. The con
test begins promptly at 2:30.
The Irishmen will be out for re
venge after th-e harsh treatment they
received during the ninth inning last
Wednesday, and the Cardinal line-up
intends to upset the old tradition of
losing the series to Cliff.
Though lacking the big-leaguers he
has carried in former years, through
couvUsy ol' Judge Landis, Cliff has an
outfit almost up to standard. Manaak
and Reppv are a sweet-looking pair of
hurlers, and Reppy in particular has
a fast ball and change of pace that
almost baffled the Cardinal batters.
Tue Ireland humor worked overtime
Wednesday, though Cliff never gets
going until he learns the peculiarities
of the team opposing him.
Coach Wolter will use about, the
same line-up tomorrow, with the pos
sible appearance of Patterson, who
has so far been prevented from prac
ticing regularly. The mound choice
will probably lie between Ditzler and
Solomon, with Jim Lawson again be
hind the plate, and the rest of the
positions practically unchanged.

With the approval of President
Coolidge and Secretary of War Weeks,
New York University has installed the
first course in aeronautical engineering
and aviation to find a place in the cur
riculum of an American college.
