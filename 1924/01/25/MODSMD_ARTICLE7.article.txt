# Hoop Skirts Have Vogue With Women In Masquers Play
## 
### 
Characters in "Milestones," the
Masquers production to be presented
next Friday night, dress according to
styles furnished by "Godey's Ladies'
Book," the Vanity hair of the Civil War
• period.
I'roni the aspect of clothes alone, aside
I from its very interesting plot, "Mile
| stones" will be well worth viewing. The
characters in the play are taken through
three different periods, the early eighties,
and the last act of the play shows the
players in styles of 1919.
Hoop Skirts Abound
Hoop skirts and other things no longer
used except in Philadelphia, abound in
! the first act.
