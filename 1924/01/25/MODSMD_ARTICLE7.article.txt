# Hoop Skirts Have Vogue With Women In Masquers Play
## 
### 
Characters in "Milestones," the
Masquers production to be presented
next Friday night, dress according to
styles furnished by "Godey's Ladies'
Book," the Vanity hair of the Civil War
â€¢ period.
I'roni the aspect of clothes alone, aside
I from its very interesting plot, "Mile
| stones" will be well worth viewing. The
characters in the play are taken through
three different periods, the early eighties,
and the last act of the play shows the
players in styles of 1919.
Hoop Skirts Abound
Hoop skirts and other things no longer
used except in Philadelphia, abound in
! the first act.
All of the dresses and hats used in
the second act, the action of which takes
place about 1880, have been loaned to
Masquers by Mrs. George J. Peirce, wife
of Professor Peirce of the Biology de
partment, from her prized collection of
garments of that time.
Ihe distinctive atmosphere in each
scene, created by the costumes, is main
tained by the furniture. The prized
horsehair stuffed chairs of the "60's"give
way to brilliant red plush, a score of
years later.
