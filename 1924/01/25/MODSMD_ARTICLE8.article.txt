# THEATRE MAY SHOW SONGS
## Students May Be Given Opportunity to Sing While In Palo Alto Play House 
### Ray Spangler 
pO-OPERATION of J. E. Lowery, manager of the Stanford Theatre, and Hurt
Lapp, varsity yell leader, may afford the Stanford student body an oppor
tunity to learn its songs in the Palo Alto theatre.
"We are willing to furnish the slides, and have our organist play the music
either before or between shows," says Lowery. 1 think it would be advan
tageous to both the theatre and the? ———

students to secure some means of co-!
operation."
Lapp favors the plan, and will prob
ably make arrangements with Lowery j
soon.
Program Selection Difficult
"It would be much easier to select
pictures for the students if they would
tell us what they want," Lowery
states. "It is the hardest job in the
world to pick programs that everyone
will like. We have the townspeople, j
the students, the board of censors, and
the children to please.
"Students are more critical than the
average theatregoer. They find more
Haws, and their tastes are many and
varied.
"About 60 per cent of our audiences
are townspeople, so we have to cater I
primarily to them, excepting on Fri
days and Saturdays, when the students I
form the majority.
Students Like Feature-Comedy
"Judging from box-office receipts,
students like a well-advertised comedy
with a popular star, such as Harold
Lloyd or Buster Keaton. Next to that,
they prefer a well-acted play, such as
George Arliss's 'Green Goddess.' They
will come to see a costume play if
they know it is good, and there is a
certain element that is always attract
ed if it thinks it is going to see some
thing slightly shady.
Romance Passes if Not Mushy
"They seem to like romance, if it is
not too mushy. In two-reel comedies,
students prefer slapstick rather than
situation stuff. Curtain newsreels,
travelogues, and cartoons prove satis- [
factory."
"One-Eyed Connolly," champion j
gate-crasher of the world, has several
potential rivals among Stanford stu
dents, according to Lowery. "Rushing
the gate is their old stuff," he says, i
"One of their original stunts is to ask
the ticket-taker to let them see a
friend inside. On the way out, they
ask for a return check, then they i
come back to see the show.
Students Give Little Trouble
"They used to wait in the alley
for the first show to let out. When
the doors opened, they would crawl

in on their hands and knees to a seat.
"We don't have much trouble with
upperclassmen in the theatres. Occa
sionally, a freshman breaks loose, but
after he's been here a year he seems
to realize what is right and wrong.
The main things I object to are the
popping of bags and questionably hu
morous remarks."

Program Selection Difficult
"It would be much easier to select
pictures for the students if they would
tell us what they want," Lowery
states. "It is the hardest job in the
world to pick programs that everyone
will like. We have the townspeople, j
the students, the board of censors, and
the children to please.
"Students are more critical than the
average theatregoer. They find more
Haws, and their tastes are many and
varied.
"About 60 per cent of our audiences
are townspeople, so we have to cater I
primarily to them, excepting on Fri
days and Saturdays, when the students I
form the majority.
Students Like Feature-Comedy
"Judging from box-office receipts,
students like a well-advertised comedy
with a popular star, such as Harold
Lloyd or Buster Keaton. Next to that,
they prefer a well-acted play, such as
George Arliss's 'Green Goddess.' They
will come to see a costume play if
they know it is good, and there is a
certain element that is always attract
ed if it thinks it is going to see some
thing slightly shady.
Romance Passes if Not Mushy
"They seem to like romance, if it is
not too mushy. In two-reel comedies,
students prefer slapstick rather than
situation stuff. Curtain newsreels,
travelogues, and cartoons prove satis- [
factory."
"One-Eyed Connolly," champion j
gate-crasher of the world, has several
potential rivals among Stanford stu
dents, according to Lowery. "Rushing
the gate is their old stuff," he says, i
"One of their original stunts is to ask
the ticket-taker to let them see a
friend inside. On the way out, they
ask for a return check, then they i
come back to see the show.
Students Give Little Trouble
"They used to wait in the alley
for the first show to let out. When
the doors opened, they would crawl

in on their hands and knees to a seat.
"We don't have much trouble with
upperclassmen in the theatres. Occa
sionally, a freshman breaks loose, but
after he's been here a year he seems
to realize what is right and wrong.
The main things I object to are the
popping of bags and questionably hu
morous remarks."
pO-OPERATION of J. E. Lowery, manager of the Stanford Theatre, and Hurt
Lapp, varsity yell leader, may afford the Stanford student body an oppor
tunity to learn its songs in the Palo Alto theatre.
"We are willing to furnish the slides, and have our organist play the music
either before or between shows," says Lowery. 1 think it would be advan
tageous to both the theatre and the? ———

students to secure some means of co-!
operation."
Lapp favors the plan, and will prob
ably make arrangements with Lowery j
soon.
