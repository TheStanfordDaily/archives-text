# FAST FRESNO FIVE WILL TANGLE WITH UNDEFEATED BABES
## State College Team Plays Good Passing Game; Is Unusually Strong 
### Wallace Knox 
Stanford freshmen are prepared for
another tough struggle tomorrow eve
j ning, when they go against the highly
J touted Fresno State Teachers' College
quintet. The game will precede the
Varsity-U.S.C. contest and will start
I promptly at 7 o'clock.
Fresno is said to have a better team
than the San Jose teachers' five, which
forced the yearlings to three extra peri-
I ods before they could win Wednesday.
The Fresno players have been together
for a long time, and have developed a
fast passing game. The inland school
intends handing the babes their first de
feat of the season, and so the contest
promises to he a nip-and-tuck affair.
Babes Can Fight
A real test of their strength was given
the frosh by the San Jose teachers. The
schoolmen were on a par with the babe?
in shooting and teamwork, and the
J Stanford five had to put everything it
had into the game to win. The fight dis
played by the first-year team was grati-
I fying.
1 f the babes continue to play the clean
brand of ball they exhibited Wednesday
they will not lose games l>ecause of
points from fouls. San Jose made but
two points from the foul line. Only
live personal fouls were called 011 the
babes and two uf these came during the
extra periods,
Frosh Can Locate Basket
The freshmen had considerable trouble
in making long shots against San Jose.
David managed to get three, but he
missed a number of tries. Jayred had
hard luck with his under the basket at
tempts, and failed to get any of them.
However, the freshmen have done good
shooting in the other games, and it is
safe to say that the breaks will not be
against them in shooting long tomorrow
night.
Anderson is probably the choice to
start at center against Fresno. He saved
the game Wednesday with his two goals
during the extra periods as well as his
playing a good defensive game. He was
slow in getting started against the
pedagogues, but once lie found himself
he did some of the best work on the
team.
Price, David Play Good Game
Price and David played a great floor
game against the teachers, and will hold
down the forward positions tomorrow.
Price has been acting as captain of the
squad, and is a good leader as well as
basket shooter.
Shipkey and Newhouse will hold down
the guard positions at the start of the
game. Both of them played the entire
game against San Jose, and seemed none
the worse for it.
