# SEAT SALE OPENS FOR "MILESTONES" TOMORROW NOON
## Edythe Baylis Takes Part Left Open by Illness of Helen Lewis 
### 
Drawings for seat tickets for the
Masquers production, "Milestones,"
will be held in the Administration
building and at Crandall's at 1 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon. Tickets will be
$1.25 and $1.
An unusually large seat sale is pre
dicted for "Milestones," due to the
play's previous success both in Eng
land and in this country. While play
ing in London it drew the biggest
crowds of the season and when two
English companies brought the play
to this country it enjoyed a similar
success.
The cast has polished oil' a lot of
the rough places and by constant ef
fort through this week should be able
to present a finely finished production
when the curtain rises Friday night.
Gordon Davis is more than pleased
with the cast, which is one of the
largest seen on the campus for some
time.
One very important change in the
list of characters had to be made last
week. Helen Lewis, who played the
lead in "Androcles and the Lion," and
had a leading role in the current pro
duction, took chicken-pox just when
she was giving promise of becoming
one of the stars of the show. How
ever. her part will be ably filled by
Edythe Balis, who is a familiar char
acter to campus audiences through
her dramatic work. Besides having
played in "You Never Can Tell;" the
lead in "Up On a Ladder," a Junior
Opera, and a lead in last year's Mas
quers play, "He Who Gets Slapped,"
she is going to direct the dramatic
part of the Women's Pageant this
year. She is president of Masquers
Society.
