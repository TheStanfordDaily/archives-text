# Opera Glasses Introduced Into Basketball Pavilion
## 
### 
Opera glasses have taken their place
in the basketball pavilion. Not only!
are the lenses turned upon the play
ers when the game is most furious,
but they are also used to make sure
that all suppositions about "Who's
With Whom, and Why,, are true.
This greatly aids the careful watch
ing of entrances, although the distrac
tion afforded makes the loyal rooter
thankful that the support of the team
does not depend on the manipulators
of the binoculars.
