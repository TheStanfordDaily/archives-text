# TROJANS SPLIT SERIES WITH CARDINAL QUINTET
## U. S. C. Takes First Contest 20-17; Stanford Wins Second Game 25-19 In Extra Period 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford and U. S. C. split two of the most spectacular basketball games
ever seen on the campus, in the pavilion last Friday and Saturday nights.
The first game went to the Trojans 20 to 17. Stanford won the second contest,
after an extra period of play, 25 to 19.
Both teams pushed the breaks to the limit, and only by getting a three
point lead at the end of the first half and playing a "stalling" defense in the
second period, was U. S. C. able to nose out the Cardinals in the first game
of the series.
Score Tied Often in First Game
The initial contest began with both teams fighting for an advantage.
Boyer, U. S. C. forward, was the first man to score. Campbell sneaked through
the entire Card defense to shoot another two points.
Things looked black for Stanford until Ernie Nevers managed to bring the
total in favor of Stanford, with two field goals, one following close after the
other. Gerpheide tied the score on a foul by Oliva. The two teams tied again.

>>soon after, 7 to 7, but a free throw by
Campbell, and a goal from the floor by
Dorsey, gave the Southerners a lead
which Stanford never reached. The
score at half time was 10 to 7, in
favor of U. S. C.
U. S. C. Stalls
The last half was a dreary exhibi
tion from the standpoint of the spec
tator. Stanford tried desperately to
keep the ball in play, but the Trojans
loafed at will, keeping a constant lead
my sending Campbell on an occasional
! dribbling drive to the goal, and usu
ally a score.
The second game began with a
multitude of fouls called on players
of each team. Neither side seemed
able to convert the penalties, and it
was not until Boyer scored on a field
Theta began the second half by several
long shots which increased its lead to
20. It was then that Dwight tossed in
two field goals for Sigma Nu. A fast
offense and strong defense on the part
of the Phi Delts, however, allowed no
more scoring for Sigma Nu while the
former piled up a 32 to 4 lead.
Logan and Fletcher led the scoring
for the winners, also playing a good
game on defense.
Dwight, Todd, and Mendenhall
showed up well for Sigma Nu.
