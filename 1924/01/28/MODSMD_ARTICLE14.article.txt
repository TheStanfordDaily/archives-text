# LIGHT-HEAVIES WIN FROM U. C. DENTISTS 21-14
## Blue and Gold Outfought in Ragged Game, Neer and Cornell Star 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound basketball team
defeated the U. C. Dental quintet 21
to 14 in the preliminary to the U. S. C. i
game Friday night. The game was
rough and hard-fought all the way
through.
Neer and Cornell are chiefly re
sponsible for the light-heavyweight's
victory. Neer was after the ball every
minute he was in the game, and Cor-.
nell's long shots and general floor
work were pretty to watch.
Farrar and Ivani did most of the
scoring for the dentists.
U. C. Leads
The U. C. team took the lead early
in the first half, but the 145's came
out from behind affd kept well ahead
for the balance of the game. The first
period ended 10 to 8. "Tiny"
Thornhill's squad added 11 more
points during the second half to the j
Dental 6.
Stewart and Knox alternated at cen
ter, and Smith and Frank were given
an opportunity to show their ability
at forward. Mangin and Lund played
steady games in the guard positions.
Promise Shown
With a little more practice in pass
ing, the 145's will have a better quin
tet than the one which defeated Cali
fornia last year. Several times the
ball was thrown wide during the game,
but there is«plenty of time to smooth j
out the offensive floor work before;
the California games on February 16 j
and 23. The showing the 145's made j
Friday night is promising.
