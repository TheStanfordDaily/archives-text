# THREE WEEKS
## 
### 
It was announced in class this morning that the quarter was now one
third over—if you understand what we mean—and it was high time to have
an examination. I his was greeted with the usual cheers, and various com
putations of how much work it would take to do the work that would have
been done in the past twenty-one days, if one had been inclined to work.
In the first three weeks of 1924. unimportantly brief as they may have
appeared, the campus has seen the following developments : FIRST, Stan
ford has developed a basketball team which met another team having a
much greater development, was beaten the first time, and came through
with a win in the second game. This victory, aside from its merits as one of
the best games played on a Cardinal court showed that the Redshirts are
capable of improving to twice their opening-season strength in the remain
ing month of play; not only that, but the U. S. C. games proved that Stan
ford athletes will never lose the "come-through" quality that has made
Cardinal championships in the past.
SECOND, one of the ideals of the University founders was realized at
the beginning of the quarter. Branner Hall was opened, and living ac
commodation on the campus was thereby made possible to every student
who desired it.
THIRD, a Stanford track team of greater power than has been seen
since the war started intensive training on the oval, and is now settling into
the pre-season grind.
FOURTH, two dramatic productions promising the utmost of suc
cess, judging from the talent engaged, are going through rehearsals for
production within the next three weeks.
LAST in the minds of some people, but first in real importance; mid
quarters are al>out to start.
PRAISE for the efforts of the band in the two basketball games this
week-end was universal throughout the bleachers. The Daily Palo Alto,
in joining the peerade, merely wishes to suggest that a lot of the apprecia
tion was due to the well-played popular pieces with which the band both
pleased and surprised its audience.
ANOTHER KICK on the Union store came yesterday evening from
a man who said that, quite aside from their excellent quality, the choc
malts served in the store were too darn big for the money paid.

commodation on the campus was thereby made possible to every student

THIRD, a Stanford track team of greater power than has been seen
