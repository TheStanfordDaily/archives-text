# STANFORD MUSEUM GETS RELICS FROM PREHISTORIC RACE
## 
### 
Fragments of tools and manufac
tured articles used by men in the
earliest stages of civilization, when
the human race was just beginning to
employ crude stone implements, con-!
stituted a collection of prehistoric j
specimens that have just been re-;
ceived by Stanford University from i
France, where the University aided in !
their excavation last year.
In the hundred specimens compris- 1
ing the collection, are flints in various j
stages of preparation and pieces of j'
flat bone that were used as protection
tc the hands of the prehistoric work-1
men as they laboriously gouged off
chips of the flint and still bear marks ;
of this use. Most of the flints were j
probably used for cutting and scrap-1
ing flesh off bones. There are also
pieces of bone that were cut by these i
flints.
Like Indians
Some bones have the butt end flat
tened as if for insertion into a handle.
There is a striking likeness in these
specimens to "points" and "scrapers" j
that have been found among the earli- j
est specimens of American archeology, j
In the Stanford collection are teeth
of animals that were contemporary j
with these French men of the early
stone age. including those of the bi
son. horse, reindeer, hyena, and vari
ous rodents. The great masses of ro- j
dpnt bones that were found are sup
posed to have been piled up by owls |
as they feasted.
There are also fragments of pottery
and other indications of later civiliza
tion. but these presumably rolled down
tlie hillside from caves above and be-j
came mingled with the earlier re- [
mains in the passage of ages.

These specimens were unearthed '
from a spot near La Quina, which is !
a hundred miles east from the point I
where the Gironde river empties into 1
the Bay of Biscay. It is 250 miles |
northwest of the spot where wide in- '
terest was aroused recently by the dis-j
coverv of prehistoric art and sculp-'
ture in caves, but the Stanford sped-,
mens are remamins of a much older
culture. It is difficult to fix any exact
date for the Stanford specimens, but
they originated in the paleolithic or
old stone age, which preceded the
later stone age and was ages before
the first attempts to utilize metals.
Stanford was one of the American
institutions that gave financial support
to the work of excavating a plot of
ground that was turned over by the
original owner, Dr. Henri-Martin, to
be developed by the American School
in France for Prehistoric Studies, and
this collection is Stanford's portion
of the results of the work during the
summer of 1923. The owner, after
working these deposits for many
years, ceded a large tract to the
French government, and turned over
a piece of ground immediately east
of this for American exploration.

In the hundred specimens compris- 1
ing the collection, are flints in various j
stages of preparation and pieces of j'
flat bone that were used as protection
tc the hands of the prehistoric work-1
men as they laboriously gouged off
chips of the flint and still bear marks ;
of this use. Most of the flints were j
probably used for cutting and scrap-1
ing flesh off bones. There are also
pieces of bone that were cut by these i
flints.
Like Indians
Some bones have the butt end flat
tened as if for insertion into a handle.
There is a striking likeness in these
specimens to "points" and "scrapers" j
that have been found among the earli- j
est specimens of American archeology, j
In the Stanford collection are teeth
of animals that were contemporary j
with these French men of the early
stone age. including those of the bi
son. horse, reindeer, hyena, and vari
ous rodents. The great masses of ro- j
dpnt bones that were found are sup
posed to have been piled up by owls |
as they feasted.
There are also fragments of pottery
and other indications of later civiliza
tion. but these presumably rolled down
tlie hillside from caves above and be-j
came mingled with the earlier re- [
mains in the passage of ages.

These specimens were unearthed '
from a spot near La Quina, which is !
a hundred miles east from the point I
where the Gironde river empties into 1
the Bay of Biscay. It is 250 miles |
northwest of the spot where wide in- '
terest was aroused recently by the dis-j
coverv of prehistoric art and sculp-'
ture in caves, but the Stanford sped-,
mens are remamins of a much older
culture. It is difficult to fix any exact
date for the Stanford specimens, but
they originated in the paleolithic or
old stone age, which preceded the
later stone age and was ages before
the first attempts to utilize metals.
Stanford was one of the American
institutions that gave financial support
to the work of excavating a plot of
ground that was turned over by the
original owner, Dr. Henri-Martin, to
be developed by the American School
in France for Prehistoric Studies, and
this collection is Stanford's portion
of the results of the work during the
summer of 1923. The owner, after
working these deposits for many
years, ceded a large tract to the
French government, and turned over
a piece of ground immediately east
of this for American exploration.
