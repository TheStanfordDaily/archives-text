# STANFORD MUSEUM GETS RELICS FROM PREHISTORIC RACE
## 
### 
Fragments of tools and manufac
tured articles used by men in the
earliest stages of civilization, when
the human race was just beginning to
employ crude stone implements, con-!
stituted a collection of prehistoric j
specimens that have just been re-;
ceived by Stanford University from i
France, where the University aided in !
their excavation last year.
In the hundred specimens compris- 1
ing the collection, are flints in various j
stages of preparation and pieces of j'
flat bone that were used as protection
tc the hands of the prehistoric work-1
men as they laboriously gouged off
chips of the flint and still bear marks ;
of this use. Most of the flints were j
probably used for cutting and scrap-1
ing flesh off bones. There are also
pieces of bone that were cut by these i
flints.
Like Indians
Some bones have the butt end flat
tened as if for insertion into a handle.
There is a striking likeness in these
specimens to "points" and "scrapers" j
that have been found among the earli- j
est specimens of American archeology, j
In the Stanford collection are teeth
of animals that were contemporary j
with these French men of the early
stone age. including those of the bi
son. horse, reindeer, hyena, and vari
ous rodents. The great masses of ro- j
dpnt bones that were found are sup
posed to have been piled up by owls |
as they feasted.
There are also fragments of pottery
and other indications of later civiliza
tion. but these presumably rolled down
tlie hillside from caves above and be-j
came mingled with the earlier re- [
mains in the passage of ages.
Stanford Leads
These specimens were unearthed '
from a spot near La Quina, which is !
a hundred miles east from the point I
where the Gironde river empties into 1
the Bay of Biscay. It is 250 miles |
northwest of the spot where wide in- '
terest was aroused recently by the dis-j
coverv of prehistoric art and sculp-'
ture in caves, but the Stanford sped-,
mens are remamins of a much older
culture. It is difficult to fix any exact
date for the Stanford specimens, but
they originated in the paleolithic or
