# Freshman Pranksters in Action Again; Doors of Encina Rooms Disappear
## 
### 
Encina wits have developed a new
prank with doors. One frosh returned
from a week-end trip yesterday eve
ning and found the portal of his room
among the missing. He also found
that his bed and a couple of chairs
had followed the door.
A frantic search led to the recovery
of the chairs and couch, but the portal
still remains A. W. O. L.
The owner and his roommates vow
awful vengeance, and the newly
adopted motto of the frosh is "Watch
Your Door."
