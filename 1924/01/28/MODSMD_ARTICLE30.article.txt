# VIKINGS HOLD CARD SOCCER VARSITY TO 1-1 TIE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Although lacking one man during i
part of the game, the Vikings of San i
Francisco held the Cardinal soccer var- !
sity to a 1-1 tie Saturday on the local
field.
Both teams were handicapped by a
very slippery field. In spite of this the
game was fairly fast. The scores came
in the first half, Stanford's from a free
kick and the \ ikings' shortly after
wards on a straight field goal.
During part of the second half, one of
the Vikings was out of the game with
an injured leg, but the loss of a man
seemed only to increase the energy of
the Viking attack. No scoring was
done by either team in the second half.
