Brian I. C. Norton of South Africa,, who, with Bill Tilden, won the doubles
championship of the United States in 1923. Norton was also ranked tenth
among the singles players of this country. He is very popular among the
tennis fans and players, and is the only man who ever stopped in the middle
of a set in the national tournament to comb his hair!
Art Nehf of the New York Giants, who was one of the pitching stars of
the last world's series. Like Max Carey, Nehf was born in Terre Haute,
Indiana. He pitched for the Boston Braves for five years, and in 1919 went
to New York, where he has been one of the mainstays of McGraw's pitching
staff ever since. Art pitched three games in the 1921 world's series, losing
two to Hoyt and finally winning one from him. In 1922 he beat Bush twice,
3-2, and 5-3, and in the last series, he beat Jones and Bush in the third game,
but cracked in the eighth inning of the sixth game, after allowing only two
hits in seven innings.
Battling Nelson, one of the gamest fighters who ever lived. The "Durable
Dane" was born in Copenhagen on the Independence Day of Denmark, and
won the lightweight championship of the world on U. S. Independence Day,
1908, by knocking out Joe Gans in seventeen rounds at Coloma, Calif. He put
Gans out again in September, which was some record performance. Two of
Nelson's biggest fights Were his eighteen-round knockout of Jimmy Britt in
1905. and his forty-two-round battle with Joe Gans in Reno in 1906. which he
lost on a foul. Nelson lost his title to Ad Wolgast in a forty-round fight in 1910.
