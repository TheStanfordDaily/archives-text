fHAUFFEURING for a blind traveling salesman is one of the unusual posi
tions filled by Stanford students who are working their way through college,
according to C. W. Barker of the Appointment Office.
Another enterprising student earns his expenses by conducting a class in
outdoor games three times a week before a group of Palo Alto grammar

school boys. 1
Many Hash, Do Gardening
"About 75 per cent of the fellows
support themselves by hashing and
gardening jobs," Barker states, "but
there are a few who do work which is
distinctly out of the ordinary."
A Palo Alto gentleman employs two
Stanford men to read to him from
standard works on economics and po
litical science. The men alternate in
riding in their employer's sedan to
secluded spots in the hills, where they
get out and readi to him for an hour
and then return to town.
Two women earn their way through
college by reading lessons to a blind
woman student three hours each day.

It sometimes happens in this and the
preceding case that the readers are
able to make a double killing when
their selections coincide with material
required in the courses they are tak
ing.
One Has Cooking Job
Another man capitalizes his culinary
skill by doing all the cooking as well
as the serving for a professor. A sec
ond professor pays a student for tak
ing entire charge of the gardening
and landscape work on the grounds of
his three-acre home.
General supervision of the Commun
ity House in Palo Alto enables another
student to support himself. Several

Palo Alto business men employ Stan
ford students in part-time capacities,
including shoe clerks, an auto sales
man, janitors, service station oper
ators, and soda "jerkers."
The women come in for a share of
the unique jobs ,also. One young lady
earns a part of her expenses by doing
all the sewing and dressmaking for
a family, while two others act as cam
pus agents for San Francisco firms,
selling sports clothes and Japanese
pearls respectively.
