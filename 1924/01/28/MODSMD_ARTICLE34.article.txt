# REV. H. B. BARD TALKS ON CONTRIBUTION OF SCIENCE TO RELIGION
## 
### 
In his sermon on the contribution o£
science to religion, yesterday morning
in the Memorial Church, the Reverend
Howard B. Bard, D. D., of the First
Unitarian Church in San Diego, said
th?.t the way in which science is de
structive is that case in which destruc
tion is tor the purpose of making way
for the rearing of a greater structure,
and when a greater service to humanity
is to be erected.
In his opinion, those who look upon
the teachings of science in all its ad
vancement, as detrimental to true relig
ion, and with fear, are like the Brah
min, who, after looking at water
through a microscope, and finding that
it contained millions of insects, found
that every time he took a glass of water
he went against his religion.
The Reverend Mr. Bard asserted
that science as a gain to religious
thought, means a quickening of a sense
of truth, with a demonstration of the
value of evidence. "Faith must find its
basis in evidence," lie said. "Intui
tion and revelation are above science
and historic fact." He continued, "A
matter of reality must be proven by
testimony."
According to the Reverend Air.
Bard, science opens up a new heaven
and earth, a larger vista, and gives an
enlarged conception of the universe.
"Advancing knowledge is the only pro
cess of clarifying of religious ideas,"
he said.
The revival of learning in the eigh
teenth century, and the culmination of
the great epic of science in the nine
teenth century with the rewriting of
the whole content of human knowledge
have given to men their broad concep
tions of religion today, thinks the Rev
erend Mr. Bard. He concluded, "The
greater knowledge of man there is, the
surer will the discord cfisappear."
