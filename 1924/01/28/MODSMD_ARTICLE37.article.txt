■7ROM Escondite, the picturesque, one-story cottage modeled after the Petit
* Trianon at Versailles and serving as the first residence of a Stanford presi
dent, to the big stone structure on Lagunita hill, is a big step and one indica
tice of the University's growth and expansion.
When Dr. David Starr Jordan and his wife and child arrived at Stanford
in 1891, Escondite, located on the road to Mayfleld, was the only available
house on the campus. The Jordanss> ——

named the house "hiding place."
History Romantic
The history of Escondite is singu
larly romantic, being connected with
Peter Coutts, commonly known as
"the Frenchman." Several years be
fore the Jordans' arrival, Coutts had
purchased the Matadero Ranch lying
south of the original Palo Alto estate.
Coutts, who apparently possessed a
considerable fortune, built the Trian
on cottage as a temporary home only,
preparatory to building a mansion on
the foothills. A large park planned 011
French lines with a poplar avenue,
small pine forest and an artificial lake
with a tiuy isle bearing a ruined
castle, surrounded the cottage. Op
posite the house was situated a plain
brick building, the lower floor serving
as an office. A large library of Elze
virs was on the second- floor.
In a vain search for water to supply
his property, Coutts drilled many hills
and on Matadero Creek built a brick
water tower of medieval type.
The French "Affair"
Coutts was in some way connected
with an affair with the French govern
ment, and when a French consul ap
peared in San Francisco, Coutts and
his family took an unexpected de
parture East, leaving the place filled
with guests. Upon investigation, it
was found that the estate had been
bought in tlje name of Eugenie Cho
gensen, the "governess." It was ru
mored that Coutts had fled from
France with Alsatian funds entrusted
to his bank during the Franco-Prus
sian War in order that they might es
cape sequestration.
The Matadero tract was later bought
I for Senator Stanford by his agent in
| London from Madamoiselle Eugenie
and became a part of the campus.
Large Residence Imperative
For two years the Jordans lived in
Escondite, until in 1893, the need for
a larger residence became imperative.
Senator Stanford had already ordered
plans for a large stone residence
which was to be rented to Dr. Jordan
as president, and a builder's contract
was placed in the Senator's hands the
day before his death. After Stanford's
death, the University underwent a
period of financial difficulty and the
plans for the residence were aban- j
doned. Dr. Jordan then hastily built
for himself Xasmin, the home which
he occupied from 1894 until last
Christmas vacation. This home, situ
ated 011 Serra street, was entirely in
adequate for a permanent official resi
dence.
During Dr. Jordan's presidency, Uni
versity social functions were often
held in the lobby of the Zoology build-;
ing, the Jordan home being unable to
accommodate many guests. There the
students gathered for the president's
reception, a'nd for other functions.
Dr. Branner Lived on Alvarado
During the two years in which Dr.
John Casper Branner was president
of Stanford, the president's home was i
shifted to Alvarado street where Dr. I
Branner had lived since his arrival at I
the University twenty-two years be
fore. In 1916, Ray Lyman Wilbur be
came president of Stanford. In 1917,
work was begun 011 the present presi
dential home, the Wilburs living in
Palo Alto until the new residence was
ready for occupancy in 1918.
As a center of University life, the
present presidential residence has be
come an indispensable part of the
campus. Two-thirds of the large build-j
ing are set aside for University fune-j
tions, only one-third being for the use:
of the president's family. In the for-!
mer, student receptions, alumni lunch
eons, and faculty gatherings are held.
Other large universities have likewise
found it necessary to provide social
quarters in conjunction with their
presidents' homes, the University of
Southern California even setting aside
a set of elaborate rooms in its ad
ministration building for social func
tions.
During the last Christmas vacation,
the Jordans left the house which
served so many years as a home {for
the president and later for the chan
cellor of Stanford, and moved into
their new home on Serra street. The
new house is owned and furnished by
the University and is to be perma
nently occupied by Ihe Jordans. The
old Jordan residence is to become
Manzanita hall, a hall for graduate
women.
Roman architects placed earthen
jars in tlve theater walls to increase !

as president, and a builder's contract
was placed in the Senator's hands the
day before his death. After Stanford's
death, the University underwent a
period of financial difficulty and the
plans for the residence were aban- j
doned. Dr. Jordan then hastily built
for himself Xasmin, the home which
he occupied from 1894 until last
Christmas vacation. This home, situ
ated 011 Serra street, was entirely in
adequate for a permanent official resi
dence.
During Dr. Jordan's presidency, Uni
versity social functions were often
held in the lobby of the Zoology build-;
ing, the Jordan home being unable to

students gathered for the president's
reception, a'nd for other functions.
Dr. Branner Lived on Alvarado
During the two years in which Dr.
John Casper Branner was president
of Stanford, the president's home was i
shifted to Alvarado street where Dr. I
Branner had lived since his arrival at I
the University twenty-two years be
fore. In 1916, Ray Lyman Wilbur be
came president of Stanford. In 1917,
work was begun 011 the present presi
dential home, the Wilburs living in
Palo Alto until the new residence was
ready for occupancy in 1918.
As a center of University life, the
present presidential residence has be
come an indispensable part of the
campus. Two-thirds of the large build-j
ing are set aside for University fune-j
tions, only one-third being for the use:
of the president's family. In the for-!
mer, student receptions, alumni lunch
eons, and faculty gatherings are held.
Other large universities have likewise
found it necessary to provide social
quarters in conjunction with their
presidents' homes, the University of
Southern California even setting aside
a set of elaborate rooms in its ad
ministration building for social func
tions.
During the last Christmas vacation,
the Jordans left the house which
served so many years as a home {for
the president and later for the chan
cellor of Stanford, and moved into
their new home on Serra street. The
new house is owned and furnished by
the University and is to be perma
nently occupied by Ihe Jordans. The
old Jordan residence is to become
Manzanita hall, a hall for graduate
women.

■7ROM Escondite, the picturesque, one-story cottage modeled after the Petit
* Trianon at Versailles and serving as the first residence of a Stanford presi
dent, to the big stone structure on Lagunita hill, is a big step and one indica
tice of the University's growth and expansion.
When Dr. David Starr Jordan and his wife and child arrived at Stanford
in 1891, Escondite, located on the road to Mayfleld, was the only available
house on the campus. The Jordanss> ——

named the house "hiding place."
History Romantic
The history of Escondite is singu
larly romantic, being connected with
Peter Coutts, commonly known as
"the Frenchman." Several years be
fore the Jordans' arrival, Coutts had
purchased the Matadero Ranch lying
south of the original Palo Alto estate.
Coutts, who apparently possessed a
considerable fortune, built the Trian
on cottage as a temporary home only,
preparatory to building a mansion on
the foothills. A large park planned 011
French lines with a poplar avenue,
small pine forest and an artificial lake
with a tiuy isle bearing a ruined
castle, surrounded the cottage. Op
posite the house was situated a plain
brick building, the lower floor serving
as an office. A large library of Elze
virs was on the second- floor.
In a vain search for water to supply
his property, Coutts drilled many hills
and on Matadero Creek built a brick
water tower of medieval type.
The French "Affair"
Coutts was in some way connected
with an affair with the French govern
ment, and when a French consul ap
peared in San Francisco, Coutts and
his family took an unexpected de
parture East, leaving the place filled
with guests. Upon investigation, it
was found that the estate had been
bought in tlje name of Eugenie Cho
gensen, the "governess." It was ru
mored that Coutts had fled from
France with Alsatian funds entrusted
to his bank during the Franco-Prus
sian War in order that they might es
cape sequestration.
The Matadero tract was later bought
I for Senator Stanford by his agent in
| London from Madamoiselle Eugenie
and became a part of the campus.
Large Residence Imperative
For two years the Jordans lived in
Escondite, until in 1893, the need for
a larger residence became imperative.

■7ROM Escondite, the picturesque, one-story cottage modeled after the Petit
* Trianon at Versailles and serving as the first residence of a Stanford presi
dent, to the big stone structure on Lagunita hill, is a big step and one indica
tice of the University's growth and expansion.
When Dr. David Starr Jordan and his wife and child arrived at Stanford
in 1891, Escondite, located on the road to Mayfleld, was the only available
house on the campus. The Jordanss> ——

named the house "hiding place."
History Romantic
The history of Escondite is singu
larly romantic, being connected with
Peter Coutts, commonly known as
"the Frenchman." Several years be
fore the Jordans' arrival, Coutts had
purchased the Matadero Ranch lying
south of the original Palo Alto estate.
Coutts, who apparently possessed a
considerable fortune, built the Trian
on cottage as a temporary home only,
preparatory to building a mansion on
the foothills. A large park planned 011
French lines with a poplar avenue,
small pine forest and an artificial lake
with a tiuy isle bearing a ruined
castle, surrounded the cottage. Op
posite the house was situated a plain
brick building, the lower floor serving
as an office. A large library of Elze
virs was on the second- floor.
In a vain search for water to supply
his property, Coutts drilled many hills
and on Matadero Creek built a brick
water tower of medieval type.
The French "Affair"
Coutts was in some way connected
with an affair with the French govern
ment, and when a French consul ap
peared in San Francisco, Coutts and
his family took an unexpected de
parture East, leaving the place filled
with guests. Upon investigation, it
was found that the estate had been
bought in tlje name of Eugenie Cho
gensen, the "governess." It was ru
mored that Coutts had fled from
France with Alsatian funds entrusted
to his bank during the Franco-Prus
sian War in order that they might es
cape sequestration.
The Matadero tract was later bought
I for Senator Stanford by his agent in
| London from Madamoiselle Eugenie
and became a part of the campus.
Large Residence Imperative
For two years the Jordans lived in
Escondite, until in 1893, the need for
a larger residence became imperative.
Senator Stanford had already ordered
plans for a large stone residence
which was to be rented to Dr. Jordan
as president, and a builder's contract
was placed in the Senator's hands the
day before his death. After Stanford's
death, the University underwent a
period of financial difficulty and the
plans for the residence were aban- j
doned. Dr. Jordan then hastily built
for himself Xasmin, the home which
he occupied from 1894 until last
Christmas vacation. This home, situ
ated 011 Serra street, was entirely in
adequate for a permanent official resi
dence.
During Dr. Jordan's presidency, Uni
versity social functions were often
held in the lobby of the Zoology build-;
ing, the Jordan home being unable to
accommodate many guests. There the
students gathered for the president's
reception, a'nd for other functions.
Dr. Branner Lived on Alvarado
During the two years in which Dr.
John Casper Branner was president
of Stanford, the president's home was i
shifted to Alvarado street where Dr. I
Branner had lived since his arrival at I
the University twenty-two years be
fore. In 1916, Ray Lyman Wilbur be
came president of Stanford. In 1917,
work was begun 011 the present presi
dential home, the Wilburs living in
Palo Alto until the new residence was
ready for occupancy in 1918.
As a center of University life, the
present presidential residence has be
come an indispensable part of the
campus. Two-thirds of the large build-j
ing are set aside for University fune-j
tions, only one-third being for the use:
of the president's family. In the for-!
mer, student receptions, alumni lunch
eons, and faculty gatherings are held.
Other large universities have likewise
found it necessary to provide social
quarters in conjunction with their
presidents' homes, the University of
Southern California even setting aside
a set of elaborate rooms in its ad
ministration building for social func
tions.
During the last Christmas vacation,
the Jordans left the house which
served so many years as a home {for
the president and later for the chan
cellor of Stanford, and moved into
their new home on Serra street. The
new house is owned and furnished by
the University and is to be perma
nently occupied by Ihe Jordans. The
old Jordan residence is to become
Manzanita hall, a hall for graduate
women.
