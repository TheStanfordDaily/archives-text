# BOTANY PROFESSOR SHOWS SKETCHES IN PALO ALTO LIBRARY
## 
### 
A collection of sketches by Profes
sor Douglas H. Campbell of the Botany
department is now on exhibition in the
gallery of the Palo Alto public library.
His profession of botany and eager
ness as a traveler have led Professor
Campbell to a wide range of subject
matter, including sketches of St. Paul's
on a gray London street, to a Square
in Calcutta, the lands of the South Seas
and Australia, Southern Asia, Egypt,
the Eastern states, Alaska and Cali
fornia.
Praised by History Professor.
Professor Reginald G. Trotter of the
History department says of Professor
Campbell's work: "The sketches are
what sketches should be, spontaneous,
direct recordings of immediate impres
sions, done simply, and with just the
significant details, but with a knowledge
and an expcrtness behind the painting
that makes each sketch not merely an
intelligent drawing, but a happy ar
rangement of luminous color.
"In the choice of subjects, the trav
eler's eye as well as the artist's has
played its part. Each sketch records a
scene that one feels to be typical of
place and seasqn, embodying the spirit
of its particular locality as that which
would be seized by a traveler, who had
wandered with vision in many lands.
This is equally true whether the sub
ject be a bit of exotic East Indian archi
tecture, or a jungle vista, the rich color
of Venice or Zara, or the pearl and
ivory tints of the upper Nile at twi
light."
