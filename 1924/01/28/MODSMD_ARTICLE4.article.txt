evening, and from then on he became
a veritable whirlwind.

to convert. McHose then sneaked up
to the basket, called for the ball, and
put Stanford ahead, 20 to 18. Nevers
continued to mount the Stanford total
by converting the two fouls which
forced Dorsey, U. S. C. guard, from
the game.
Campbell was practically helpless.

style of play was noticeably changed

shooting his final marker just a few
seconds before the gun was fired.
