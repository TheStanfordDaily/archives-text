# FRESHMEN DEFEAT FRESNO TOSSERS BY 26-17 SCORE
## Price Does Most of Scoring for Frosh, Visitors Use Long Shots 
### 
Stanford's 1927 Babes had little
trouble in stopping the Fresno State
College five in the pavilion Saturday
night. The freshmen were on the long
end of a 26 to 17 score when the game
ended.
Fred Price was the shining light for
the 1927 team. His defensive work
was good and he got baskets from all
angles, scoring six altogether.
The Fresno men were unable to get
through the Babe defense and had to
resort to long shots in an effort to
score. They scored first when Baxter
made good a shot from the middle of
the floor.
Jayred got a foul try and then he,
Price, and David carried the ball down
the floor, where Price scored. This put
the Frosh ahead and from then on
they managed to gradually increase
this lead.
Frosh Attack Fast
David, Price, and Jayred each ac
counted for a goal during the next
five minutes, which gave the Babes a
seven-point lead. Baxter managed to
elude the freshman guards long
enough to score twice. Rhodes and
Burr each made a point from the foul
line, giving Fresno a total of eight.
Price increased the freshman score
by caging two more baskets before
the half ended. Both of them were
scored from under the hoop. The score
at half time was 14 to 8.
The freshmen kept up the scoring
at about the same pace during the
next half. Shipkey came up from his
guard position long enough to make
a basket and a foul shot. Jayred fol
lowed the ball in for his second bas
ket. A minute later he added one point
by a successful foul try.
Fresno kept in the running and Fos
ter, Burr, and Telonicker all scored
on long shots. David broke up one of
their plays and dribbled the ball to
the basket for another score. Price
made his fifth and sixth baskets soon
after.
With eight minutes to go the Babes
started taking things easy and kept
passing the ball in a circle. Hunt sent
in Anderson for Jayred in both the
first and second halves, and towards
the end of the last half Blazier, South
worth, and Dunfee got a chance to
play.
