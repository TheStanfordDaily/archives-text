j
For five years we have recommended to car owners of Palo Atlo
nothing but Goodyear Tires.
During those five years we have been offered the long discounts on
inferior tires that appeal to many dealers who do not always think of
customer interest first.
We make less money per tire selling you Goodyear Tires than on
lots of other tires that we could handle.
But we continue to sell and recommend Goodyear Tires to you because
we know that they will give you real service and will bring you back
repeatedly for more Goodyears.
