# GOUDKOFF TO TALK ON RESOURCES OF SIBERIA TONIGHT
## Lantern Slides of Maps and Diagrams Will Be Used By Lecturer 
### 
With lantern slides of maps and
diagrams to illustrate his lecture, Pro
fessor P. P. Goudkoff, formerly of the
School of Mines at Tomsk, Siberia,
will lecture on "The Natural Re
sources of Siberia and their Develop
ment," tonight at 7:30, in the Assem
bly Hall.
To Tell Mineral Possibilities
Professor Goudkoff's discussion will
be chiefly from the point of view of
the mineral wealth of Siberia, and
will probably reveal facts concerning |
its location, what is necessary for fu- j
ture development and when this de
velopment will take place most profit-!
ably.
Professor Goudkoff's previous ex- j
perience has made him an expert on
the subject of his lecture. During the
fifteen years when he was Professor
of Economic Geology and Petrology
in the Mining Institute of the Univer
sity at Tomsk, he spent his time in
the summer doing field work extend
ing from the Ural Mountains east to
Sakhalin. He became particularly
familiar with the western Alcai Moun
tains. and the Urals.
He was born in one of the placer
mining districts of Siberia, where his
father was president of one of the
oldest gold mining companies. Pro
fessor Goudkoff was educated at the j
Imperial School of Mines at Petro
grad, and was a pupil of Federov, a j
famous professor of mineralogy at the :
university in Petrograd.
Is Consulting Geologist
Professor Goudkoff later became
consulting geologist for the mining;
company which had the most valuable i
concessions in Sakhalin, and was also
connected in the same position with
a number of large mining companies, i
Professor Goudkoff has been in Los
Angeles for the last year, engaged in
the same kind of work.
High Position at Vladivostok
Before he came West, however, he !
was in New York for a year, on a
diplomatic mission, as a representa- [
five of the Chamber of Commerce of
Vladivostok. Previously, he had been
at Vladivostok carrying on work for
the Far Eastern Republic, in charge i
of one of the cabinet departments.
After the Russian Revolution in j
1917. and before the Kolchak expedi
tion, Professor Goudkoff occupied the
post of Secretary of Commerce and
Industry in the Cabinet of the West J
Siberian government.

The lecture on "Metal Mining Dis- j
tricts of Siberia," which was to have i
been given this afternoon, has been I
postponed, and will be given tomorrow
afternoon at 4 o'clock in Room 334 of .
the Geology building. The lecture j
scheduled for Wednesday afternoon
on "Coal Districts of Siberia" will be
given Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock
in the Geology building in Room 334.
These lectures will be technical, and
are for the advanced geology stu
dents and all others interested.

With lantern slides of maps and
diagrams to illustrate his lecture, Pro
fessor P. P. Goudkoff, formerly of the
School of Mines at Tomsk, Siberia,
will lecture on "The Natural Re
sources of Siberia and their Develop
ment," tonight at 7:30, in the Assem
bly Hall.
To Tell Mineral Possibilities
Professor Goudkoff's discussion will
be chiefly from the point of view of
the mineral wealth of Siberia, and
will probably reveal facts concerning |
its location, what is necessary for fu- j
ture development and when this de
velopment will take place most profit-!
ably.
Professor Goudkoff's previous ex- j
perience has made him an expert on
the subject of his lecture. During the
fifteen years when he was Professor
of Economic Geology and Petrology
in the Mining Institute of the Univer
sity at Tomsk, he spent his time in
the summer doing field work extend
ing from the Ural Mountains east to
Sakhalin. He became particularly
familiar with the western Alcai Moun
tains. and the Urals.
He was born in one of the placer
mining districts of Siberia, where his
father was president of one of the
oldest gold mining companies. Pro
fessor Goudkoff was educated at the j
Imperial School of Mines at Petro
grad, and was a pupil of Federov, a j
famous professor of mineralogy at the :
university in Petrograd.
Is Consulting Geologist
Professor Goudkoff later became
consulting geologist for the mining;
company which had the most valuable i
concessions in Sakhalin, and was also
connected in the same position with
a number of large mining companies, i
Professor Goudkoff has been in Los
Angeles for the last year, engaged in
the same kind of work.
High Position at Vladivostok
Before he came West, however, he !
was in New York for a year, on a
diplomatic mission, as a representa- [
five of the Chamber of Commerce of
Vladivostok. Previously, he had been
at Vladivostok carrying on work for
the Far Eastern Republic, in charge i
of one of the cabinet departments.
After the Russian Revolution in j
1917. and before the Kolchak expedi
tion, Professor Goudkoff occupied the
post of Secretary of Commerce and
Industry in the Cabinet of the West J
Siberian government.
