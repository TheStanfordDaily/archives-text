# CARD WEIGHT SQUADS PLAY HIGH SCHOOLS
## 
### Ray Spangler 
Stanford's weight basketball teams
arc scheduled for one game each this
J week. The 145's play the Palo Alto
j high school team in the preliminary to
j the Freshman-San Jose game tomorrow
' night, and the 130's meet the San
| Mateo high school quintet Thursday
, in the curtain raiser for the Varsity-
Nevada contest.
The light heavyweights need only a
few more contests to be in shape for
the games with California on February
16 and 23. They lost their first game to |
j the San Jose Circle Y, but won a fast j
i game from the IT.l T . C. Dentals last Fri-1
I day-
Cornell and Neer make a good com- j
I bination at forward. Stewart and Knox ;
are fighting for the center position and ;
with a little more experience, both will
develop into good players. Mangin j
j and Lund are capable guards.
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill has reserve
forward material in Frank and Smith,
who showed up well in Friday's game.
The 145's started the season with a
poor outlook. Cornell was the only
veteran on the squad. But the team
staged a comeback and now stands a
good chance of defeating California.
On the other hand, the 130-pound
five, built around four veterans, has
yet to show anything in the way of
team work. They have won two out
of three games, but against the San
Jose Y. M. C. A. last Wednesday they
proved weak on the offensive.
Unless a game is scheduled for the
lightweights on February 8, Thursday's
game will be the last before the Cali
fornia series on February 13 and 20.
