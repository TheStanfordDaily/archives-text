j presenting Stanford, will compete
with the U. S. C. debating team at

This is the same question that was
1 taken in the Stanford-California de

tonight Stanford will uphold the ne-

skill as a member of the Euphronia
Debating Society. He is a clever
speaker and a keen thinker.
Robert Littler is one of the leading
debators on the campus. He has had
experience on former Stanford teams,
and his victories in this line far out
balance his defeats.
