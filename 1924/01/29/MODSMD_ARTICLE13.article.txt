# COMIC CHARACTER IN "MILESTONES" WELL PORTRAYED
## Cast Dress Rehearsals Will Be Held Tomorrow and Thursday Nights 
### 
Tomorrow and Thursday nights the
cast of Masquers' play will hold dress
rehearsals in preparation for the pre
sentation Friday night. Tickets went
on sale at the Administration building
this afternoon and can be obtained to
morrow and Thursday afternoon.
With Dorothy Dahler in the leading
comedy role, "Milestones" will not be
lacking Its full quota of good laughs.
According to Gordon Davis Miss Dah
ler will be seen at her best in the
Masquers production as Nancy Sibley,
the woman who steps from rags to
riches via the matrimonial route.
"If she had walked into the casting
director's office when the play was
first being made up," says Davis, "she
would have been given the part with
out any argument. The character is
exactly suited to her type and the
actress who portrayed it in the origi
nal run of the piece was no better
than she is."
Dorothy Dahler in Comedy Part
Miss Dahler made her debut in cam
pus dramatics last year as Peggy
Woofers in the Sophomore Play,
"Three Live Ghosts." There, as in
"Milestones," she was the chief comic
character and acted a part that was
fundamentally similar to the one in
which she will be seen Friday night.
In the Junior Opera last spring, how
ever, she made her biggest hit as an
actress that can put over roles that
are "different" when she appeared as
the dancing partner of Bill Lucas in
a specialty skit. j.

As Nancy Sibley, Miss Dahler is the
only discordant element in the age
hardened and tradition-bound English
family that lives according to the law
as laid down by John Rhead, the head
of the house. Marrying into the fam
ily from a much lower station in the
social scale doesn't bother her in the
least. She has her say whenever she
feels like it and pops oft with any
thing or nothing in a way that will
draw a laugh from any audience.
Her husband. Sam Sibley, in the
first act is a fiery young man who
does things as he wants them done or
not at all. He is quite a sporty man
about town and takes his fun where
he finds it until he marries Nancy. The
last two acts find her as the dominat
ing element in their own private fam
ily feud, creating a bit of a sensation
even where John Rhead is king.

English Family Depicted
As Nancy Sibley, Miss Dahler is the
only discordant element in the age
hardened and tradition-bound English
family that lives according to the law
as laid down by John Rhead, the head
of the house. Marrying into the fam
ily from a much lower station in the
social scale doesn't bother her in the
least. She has her say whenever she
feels like it and pops oft with any
thing or nothing in a way that will
draw a laugh from any audience.
Her husband. Sam Sibley, in the
first act is a fiery young man who
does things as he wants them done or
not at all. He is quite a sporty man
about town and takes his fun where
he finds it until he marries Nancy. The
last two acts find her as the dominat
ing element in their own private fam
ily feud, creating a bit of a sensation
even where John Rhead is king.
Tomorrow and Thursday nights the
cast of Masquers' play will hold dress
rehearsals in preparation for the pre
sentation Friday night. Tickets went
on sale at the Administration building
this afternoon and can be obtained to
morrow and Thursday afternoon.
With Dorothy Dahler in the leading
comedy role, "Milestones" will not be
lacking Its full quota of good laughs.
According to Gordon Davis Miss Dah
ler will be seen at her best in the
Masquers production as Nancy Sibley,
the woman who steps from rags to
riches via the matrimonial route.
"If she had walked into the casting
director's office when the play was
first being made up," says Davis, "she
would have been given the part with
out any argument. The character is
exactly suited to her type and the
actress who portrayed it in the origi
nal run of the piece was no better
than she is."
Dorothy Dahler in Comedy Part
Miss Dahler made her debut in cam
pus dramatics last year as Peggy
Woofers in the Sophomore Play,
"Three Live Ghosts." There, as in
"Milestones," she was the chief comic
character and acted a part that was
fundamentally similar to the one in
which she will be seen Friday night.
In the Junior Opera last spring, how
ever, she made her biggest hit as an
actress that can put over roles that
are "different" when she appeared as
the dancing partner of Bill Lucas in
a specialty skit. j.
