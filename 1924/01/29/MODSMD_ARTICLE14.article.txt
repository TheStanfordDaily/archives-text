# Track Team Works Out On Heavy Field; Pole Vaulters Show Promise
## 
### 
In spite of the heavy, rain-soaked
field, the track team went through
its paces Monday, carrying out
Coach "Dink" Templeton's plan of
early conditioning.
Scofield and Dennis are practicing
with the poles. The three jumps are
admittedly the weakest point of this
year's team. but. in Scofield, Temple
ton has a pole-vaulter with a great
deal of natural ability. He is already
clearing eleven feet without much
trouble; and with a month and a
half before the first meet of the sea
son in which to perfect his jump,
Scofield ought to be able to clear the
bar at better than twelve feet.
Norris and Black tied for first
place in last year's big meet at 12
feet 1. Scofield made 12 feet 3 in the
Southern Conference meet. Norris
will appear in Olympic club colors
against Stanford on March 15.
Scofield is getting power in his
jumps by contracting his arms more,
having the muscles in better control
for the final pull over the bar.
Dennis has not the natural ability
of his teammate, but is a consis
tent jumper. He failed to place in
the meet with California last year,
but with Norris and Black out, Dennis
should break into the point column.
