Stanford University, California,
January 28. 1924
Mr. F. E. Davis,
1820 West 41st St.,
Los Angeles, Calif.
Dear Mr. Davis:
On behalf of the Associated Students of Stanford University, 1 de
sire to apologize for the unsportsman-like conduct of the crowd at the
Stanford-U. S. C. game for which you officiated January 25.
I wish to assure you that such conduct on the part of Stanford rooters
is not customary, under any circumstances. In this particular case, the
Stanford coaches and players were unanimous in the opinion that your
work as referee was highly satisfactory.
Promising you that this will not happen again. I am,
Yours very truly,
ALFRED R. MASTERS,
President, A. S. S. U.
