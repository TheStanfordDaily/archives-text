# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: —
Are Stanford basketball rooters la- j
boring under the delusion that they
are mere theatergoers, because they
have paid admission to the games?
Do they look at the Big Five on the ;
floor last week-end as so many paid j
entertainers, to whom they must give 1
a polite ovation before leaving?
With utter disregard of the yell
leader's instructions, a large number
of the students started out of the
pavilion immediately after the final
gun was fired both on Friday and Sat
urday nights. "Hold it up for the
hymn"—those were the instructions.
Should those instructions be neces
sary to Stanford men and women AI
foolish question, as any old-timer will
tell you.
In the hymn we have the highest!
possible type of expression of our !
love and respect for the University.
This is an appeal to the freshmen
to "snap out of it" before they fall
into the bad habits of their elders. All
good music, is not made by Art Hick
man, my son.
i
This is a positive request to those
visitors who avail themselves of the
pleasures of our intercollegiate games
to remain where they are until the
hymn has been sung. And to some of
you uninitiated men, it is considered
good form to remove your hats in
deference to the Alma Mater we ac-1
claim.
« Finally, this is a denunciation of the
blase undergrads, men and women,
who are the worst offenders in this
matter. When you carry your affected
disregard of social refinements this
far you "hardys" are getting a long
way from your point.
But, of course, YOU won't read this.
