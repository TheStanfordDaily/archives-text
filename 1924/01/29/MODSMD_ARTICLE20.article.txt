# EMERSON TALKS TO FIRST-YEAR MEN ON STANFORD DERATING
## 
### 
"Debating as an Activity at Stan
ford." was the subject of a talk by
Professor J. G. Emerson, Stanford de
bating coach, at a freshman meeting
held last evening in the Encina club
rooms. The talk was the second of a
series which are being given for the
freshmen in place of the "On-the
boat" assemblies.
"I want to urge the men who are not
interested in becoming debaters to sup
port the activity for the sake of those
who are on the team," Professor Emer
son stated. "It is the duty of every
Stanford man to support all the activi
ties.
"Debating takes the intellectual side
of life and makes of it an activity. It
is a means of self-government as it
takes a great deal of hard work and is
not spectacular.
"Although debating has been in a
slump during the last few years it has
not been a slump typical of Stanford
history. The facts that more debates
are being considered this year than
ever before, and that a team will be
sent east to oppose Princeton and Har
vard show that it is decidedly on the
upgrade as an activity of the first rank.
"Tryouts for the freshman debating
team will be held Wednesday, Febru
ary 6, in the Little Theater. Six men
will be required for the debate with
California and four men for the debate
with the College of Pacific, both of
which will be held in March.
"I appeal to the members of this class
as makers of Stanford sentiment during
the next four years to make men feel
proud to be on the debate team and to
encourage them in every possible way."
