How to get an interview.
To the unsophisticated, the appearance of an interview in the Daily means
more or less nothing. To the writer it represents the ultimate attained.
For beginners, we advise the following: If the desk editor tells you to get
an interview, break your arm and go to the hospital. If you're an old hand
at interviewing, you're probably dead.
If, perchance, you have a wooden arm, and have to take an interview,
chances are ten to one that you also have a wooden head. Ah there, William.
