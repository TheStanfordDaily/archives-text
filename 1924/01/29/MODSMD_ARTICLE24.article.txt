Cabbages has, in the past, voluntarily assumed a rather impersonal attitude,
following the precedent set by the Southern Pacific, the Liberty Loan, the
Union store, and other contemporaries. Lately this monotony has been varied
a trifle, and it is the desire of the Cabbagitators to give the public what it
wants.
The public never knows what it wants.—William Jennings Bryan.
Thousands of little funny things happen every day—of interest to all, of
tragedy to some, and too funny to print. If Mie Lawson brothers take tea
with Professor Seward, we'll whisper it to you. If the Angel of Grief is
caught in the Cactus Gardens with a member of the Y. M. C. A., we'll be the
first to tell you. That is ... if you want it.
If we got you the moon . . .
You'd be tired of it soon!
—Bedouin Love Song.
