### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Jimmy O'Connell, the "$75,000 Beauty" of the New York Giants, who did
not do so well in 1923, but for whom McCraw has great hopes during the
coming season. Jimmy batted .335 with the San Francisco Seals in 1922.
In 1923, playing in 87 games with the Giants, he only hit .250. Now that
Stengel and Cunningham are gone from the Giants, however, watch Jimmy's
smoke in 1924.
Frances Ouimet of Boston, who has been a figure in international golf for
over ten years. He jumped into fame as a youngster in 1?)13 by defeating
the two famous Englishmen, Vardon and Ray, in the play-off for the United
States Open title. The next year he won the National Amateur title. He
had a good year in 1923, helping America win the Walker cup in England,
and winning the Royal St. George cup himself, and also being the best
American in the British amateur championship. Ouimet was put out in the
semi-finals of the National Amateur tournament of Flossmoor by Marston.
Harold Osborn of the Illinois Athletic Club, who is probably the world's
greatest all-around athlete. Osborne starred as a track and field man at the
University of Illinois, and in 1922 set a new National championship mark in
the high jump of 6 feet 5-8 inches. At the 1923 National meet at Stagg field,
Chicago, he broke the world's record for the Decathlon, or all-around per
formance of ten events, amassing 7,350.11 points. In an exhibition at Cham
paign, Illinois, in November, he jumped 6 feet 7 7-16 inches, which is better
than the world's record. He should help win for America in Paris this
summer.
