# SCHOOL HOUSE IS SCENE OF SUNDAY EVENING DANSANT
## 
### 
Something "new and novel" has re
cently been unearthed by an unknown
campus sleuth in the way of Sunday
evening entertainment.
The night watchman, while making
his rounds Sunday night was attracted
to the school house, situated at the
corner of Lasuen and Santa Ynez, by
a pleasant sensation which made a
noise on his eardrum like music.
He was skeptical; for it was Sunday
night and the curfew had long since
rung. He advanced cautiously upon the
school house, threw open the door and
to his amazement, he was confronted
with a full-fledged dance, fully organ
ized and attended by some six or eight
couples and a phonograph.
After refusing an offer to dance, the
trusty fellow brandished his billy-club
and quickly broke up the party.
Unfortunately, he obtained no names,
nor was he able to distinguish any of
the marauders in the dark.
Footprints found on the school house
floor however, will form the basis of an
exhaustive investigation which is ex
pected to eventually run down the of
fenders and accord them drastic atten
tion.
