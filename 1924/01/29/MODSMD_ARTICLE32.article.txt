l» | Through the co-operation of traffic
j! and peace authorities, bus line offi-
£ 1 cials and the California State Auto
j» ! mobile Association, much progress is
j. being made toward eliminating condi
rl tions which have been a constant
• source of complaint from motorists on
p the San Francisco Peninsula road, of
ficials of the Public Safety Depart
ment of the Automobile Club an
nounced yesterday.
Officials of the larger bus lines have
promised to co-operate with the Auto
mobile Association in correcting con
ditions which have led to speeding
and improper driving methods on the
part of bus drivers. Definite steps
have already been made in that direc
tion, it was announced yesterday. Fur
ther progress is expected as the re
sult of a conference of bus line of
ficials and other interested parties to
be called in the near future by Percy
I E. Towne, chairman of the Automobile
Association's public safety committee.
As a culmination of the public safe
, ty campaign which was begun on the
f, Peninsula highway some months ago
by the Automobile Club in co-opera
tion with traffic inspectors of the Di
vision of Motor Vehicles, seven bus
drivers were recently given suspended
j jail sentences by Justice of the Peace
Ray Griffin of Redwood City. The ac
tion followed a plea of guilty entered
by the drivers' attorneys in all seven
cases. The sentences which vary from
one to five days will become effective
if any of the drivers in question are
again found guilty of traffic laws vio
lations within six months in the terri
tory under Judge Griffith's jurisdic
tion.
, Judge Griffin told the Automobile
i Association that he believed such sen
tences would put an end to excessive
speeding in his territory. This policy
means that the operator must serve
a jail sentence for a second offense
within six months, besides the possi
bility of an increased sentence for the
second violation.
Officials of the Peninsula Rapid
Transit Company told the Automobile
Association that they have appointed
a traffic inspector, who rides in their
buses in plain clothes and checks the
driving methods employed by their
operators. They have announced that
they will not retain in their employ
any driver who violates the law.
Schedules of various bus lines have
been revised so that drivers will not
leave terminals at the same time and
race with each other in competing for
pick-up business.
Further plans for improving the con
ditions heretofore prevalent in the
Peninsula highway will be worked out
at this conference to be called soon
by the Automobile Association.

sult of a conference of bus line of
ficials and other interested parties to
be called in the near future by Percy
I E. Towne, chairman of the Automobile
Association's public safety committee.
As a culmination of the public safe
, ty campaign which was begun on the
f, Peninsula highway some months ago
by the Automobile Club in co-opera
tion with traffic inspectors of the Di
vision of Motor Vehicles, seven bus
drivers were recently given suspended
j jail sentences by Justice of the Peace
Ray Griffin of Redwood City. The ac
tion followed a plea of guilty entered
by the drivers' attorneys in all seven
cases. The sentences which vary from
one to five days will become effective
if any of the drivers in question are
again found guilty of traffic laws vio
lations within six months in the terri
tory under Judge Griffith's jurisdic
tion.
, Judge Griffin told the Automobile
i Association that he believed such sen
tences would put an end to excessive
speeding in his territory. This policy
means that the operator must serve
a jail sentence for a second offense
within six months, besides the possi
bility of an increased sentence for the
second violation.
Officials of the Peninsula Rapid
Transit Company told the Automobile
Association that they have appointed
a traffic inspector, who rides in their
buses in plain clothes and checks the
driving methods employed by their
operators. They have announced that
they will not retain in their employ
any driver who violates the law.
Schedules of various bus lines have
been revised so that drivers will not
leave terminals at the same time and
race with each other in competing for
pick-up business.
Further plans for improving the con
ditions heretofore prevalent in the
Peninsula highway will be worked out
at this conference to be called soon
by the Automobile Association.
