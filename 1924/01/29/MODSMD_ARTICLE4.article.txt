# DIRECTOR IS SECURED BY RAM'S HEAD
## 
### 
Miss Aileen Eyre has been secured
by Ram's Head Society to direct the
chorus of their coming production.
Traveling as a solo dancer in "Kis
met," she has gained a wide range of
stage experience, and she has also as
sisted in the direction of many plays
around the bay region
Louis Alabaster, musical director, is
putting in a lot of time perfecting the
songs and musical part of the farce.
The cast is working hard every
night in the lobby of the Zoology
building, where the conditions for act
ing are poor. Next week, when they
will be able to get into the Assembly
hall, more rapid progress should be
made. The members of the chorus are
working out occasionally under the
direction of Miss Eyre, perfecting
their voices and learning how to show
their legs to best advantage.
