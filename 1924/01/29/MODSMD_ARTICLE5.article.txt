# BABE QUINTET PLAYS SAN JOSE TOMORROW
## 
### Wallace Knox 
During the next two weeks the fresh- j
man hoopsters will meet four fast high ,
school teams, which should put the j
1927 men in good trim for the Cali- \
fornia series, beginning on February 13. J
The next game will be tomorrow even- j
ing at 8 o'clock in the pavilion, when
the Babes meet the San Jose high
school.
I 1
Berkeley will tangle with the Babes | ,
on Saturday, and next week the Pied- j
mont and Livermore high schools are j
scheduled for games. All of these j ,
games should be close and the fresh- ! J
men will have to show all the stuff they
have to defeat the trans-bay quintets.
San Jose defeated the San Jose |
Teachers', College five a short time 1
ago. The Teachers forced the Babes j
to three extra periods before they went
down to defeat. If San Jose high can '
defeat San Jose Teachers, the prep five <
must be able to give plenty of compe- :
tition to the freshmen.
Win Seven Games.
The yearlings won their seventh
straight game Saturday by defeating
the Fresno State College team. Fresno
had been defeated but once, and that
was at the hands of one of the fastest
junior college quintets in the state —
Modesto. Each victory makes the I
Babes' chances against California look j
better. If Piedmont falls before the j
onslaught of Coach "Husky" Hunt's |
well trained team, it will he almost a j
safe bet that California will meet defeat j
also. Piedmont had a brilliant bunch j
of players last year, and had little trou- j
hie in defeating the 1926 team.* From
reports, they have as good a bunch this I
year.
