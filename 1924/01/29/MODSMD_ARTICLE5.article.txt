# BABE QUINTET PLAYS SAN JOSE TOMORROW
## 
### Wallace Knox 
During the next two weeks the fresh- j
man hoopsters will meet four fast high ,
school teams, which should put the j
1927 men in good trim for the Cali- \
fornia series, beginning on February 13. J
The next game will be tomorrow even- j
ing at 8 o'clock in the pavilion, when
the Babes meet the San Jose high
school.
I 1
Berkeley will tangle with the Babes | ,
on Saturday, and next week the Pied- j
mont and Livermore high schools are j
scheduled for games. All of these j ,
games should be close and the fresh- ! J
men will have to show all the stuff they
have to defeat the trans-bay quintets.
San Jose defeated the San Jose |
Teachers', College five a short time 1
ago. The Teachers forced the Babes j
to three extra periods before they went
down to defeat. If San Jose high can '
defeat San Jose Teachers, the prep five <
must be able to give plenty of compe- :
tition to the freshmen.
Win Seven Games.
The yearlings won their seventh
straight game Saturday by defeating
the Fresno State College team. Fresno
had been defeated but once, and that
was at the hands of one of the fastest
junior college quintets in the state â€”
Modesto. Each victory makes the I
Babes' chances against California look j
better. If Piedmont falls before the j
onslaught of Coach "Husky" Hunt's |
well trained team, it will he almost a j
safe bet that California will meet defeat j
also. Piedmont had a brilliant bunch j
of players last year, and had little trou- j
hie in defeating the 1926 team.* From
reports, they have as good a bunch this I
year.
Fred Price played a good game Sat- |
urday. He accounted for six of the |
j freshman baskets, as well as playing a !
good floor game. David, his running J
mate, is going about as well and in
these two men Hunt has as dependable
a pair of forwards as could be asked
for. Both of them get a large percent
age of their shots from the floor, and
seldom miss from under the basket.
Riese, Southworth, and Blazier have
been used as substitute forwards in the
past few games, and may be used again
Wcdncsday.
Center Still in Doubt.
Jayred and Anderson are still fight
ing it out for center. Both of them
take care of the pivot position like vet
erans and no change in the work of the
team can be seen when one is substi
tuted for the other. Jayred will prob
ably start against San Jose.
Shipkey is doing well at running
guard. He broke into the scoring col
umn in both the San Jose Teachers and
Fresno games. Williams and Dunfee
are two other running guards who may
get a chance to play against the San
Jose high.
The Babe defense is ably backed by
Newhouse. the 235-pound standing
guard. Newhouse improves with every
game and his ability is proved by the
small number of baskets made by oppo
nents from within the 17 foot line. His
passing is good and he invariably gets
the ball from the backboard.

The tonnage of iron products in
1923 exceeded the 1920 output by 25
per cent and was 30 per cent greater
than that of 1922.
