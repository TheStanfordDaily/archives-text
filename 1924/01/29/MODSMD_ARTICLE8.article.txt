# "POP" HARRIS SETS RECORD
## Over 160 Relatives Back In Home State: Was Slave In Civil War Days 
### 
"Pop" Harris, keeper of the campus
shoe, set up yesterday what is believed
to be a new long-distance record on
the campus, when he declared that back
in North Carolina where he was born,
he has over one hundred and sixty liv
ing relatives. "Pop" has been back to
his native state three times since he
came to California, and he asserts that
the last time he was back that he
counted as least one hundred and
sixty and that there might have been
another half hundred or so that he
overlooked in the rush.
Today, "Pop" is seventy-one years
old and is the father of thirteen chil
dren. He also has fourteen grand
children and in addition to that, he has
twelve great-grandchildren. But even
in the face of those odds, he declares
he doesn't "feel a day over forty-five."
Slave in Civil War Days.
When he was a boy, he was a slave
for six years on a North Carolina cot
ton plantation. With the successful
termination of the Civil War however,
he was set free and he and his father
â€¢maintained a little farm of their own
until he was seven years old. at which
time, he confessed, he "up and got mar
ried."
Then lie decidcd to come to Cali

fornia, and in 1892 he and his wife
moved to Palo Alto, where "Pop" got
a job with one of the contractors who
was engaged in erecting University
I buildings. At that time the buildings
j of the inner Quad were the only ones
completed. He remained in this work
j for seven years as a sort of general
j helper.
Then lie entered the transfer busi
! ness, ami for sixteen years he hauled
i trunks, moved pianos and did general
drayage work about the University.
Next he was a red-cap porter at the
Southern Pacific station at Palo Alto
for two years, and finally, for the past
I six years, lie has been on the campus
, as its chief shoe-polisher.
Old Days More Wild,
i According to "Pop" the Stanford
students were "more rambunctious in
the old days, and used to cut up some
thing terrible." He recalls one instance
during a football rally, when a crowd
of exuberant students tried to rush
David A. Curry's stock theater in Palo
Alto. Curry, who later founded Camp
j Curry in Yoseniite National Park, was
;at that time the owner of a little
theater in Palo Alto which used to play
j the traveling shows of the day. Motion
pictures were, in those days, of course,
unheard of. "The boys used to shove
right in without paying nothing,"
"Pop" asserted, "and lots of times they
raised such a rumpus that Mr. Curry
had to stop the show." On that par
ticular night, Curry locked the doors,
formed a bucket brigade from members
of the audience and succeeded in thor
oughly drenching the clamoring stu
dents from one of the upper windows
of the building.
Business Not So Good.
"Pop" heartily approves of all sorts
of rainy and muddy weather as a
source of increased business. He be
wails the passing of Greene's store
however, which vised to be located di
rectly across the street from his little
stand. Greene's used to bring lots of
students over his way, and since it has
been removed "Pop"' declares his busi
ness has fallen off fifty per cent.
