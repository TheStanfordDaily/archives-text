# IRELAND AND VARSITY TO MEET AGAIN
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's aggregation
of sluggers will tangle tomorrow after
noon at 3:30 with Cliff Ireland's Inde
pendents in the second engagement of
the season, weather permitting. The
game was originally slated for last
Saturday, but a belated debut of the
rainy season put the skids on the dia
mond and under the match.
Wolter will probably use the same
line-up, with the possible appearance
of Captain Ed Patterson at first base.
Either Ditzler or Solomon will be dele
gated to do the flinging, with Jim Law
son receiving.
Ireland will also put practically
the same men on the field, with
Manauk or Reppy pitching. Ratner,
an outfielder on the 1922 Card varsity,
is a member of the squad, and may
be in the line-up tomorrow.
