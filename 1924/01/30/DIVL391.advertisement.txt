WALK-OVER
Shoes for
Stanford Women
For Afternoon Wear
CONTRASTING color and fabric in
the piping lend originality to the
cutout pattern on this dainty slipper.
Of Jack Rabbit and Grey Suede Milk
Kid Trim, or of glaze kid piped with
suede in a deeper shade of brown, it
would complement the most elaborate
costume.
Beautiful low heel strapped slippers in Black, Airedale,
Gray, and all the new shades.
