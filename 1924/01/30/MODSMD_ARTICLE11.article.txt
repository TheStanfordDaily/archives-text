# WOMEN LIKE COURT GAME
## Human Element, Excitement, Humor, Skill Appealing Elements In Basketball 
### Aileen Hicks 
It is the human element 111 basket
ball that appeals to Stanford women.
In this game they are able to see
every player and even watch the ex
pressions 011 their faces, while in foot
ball it is more of a panorama. Basket
ball players seem less like automa
tons; even their remarks can be heard,!
and these words of wisdom are at!
times enlightening—and of interest to J
the women. Because of the nearness ;
of the players, the spectators become '
intensely interested and they can fol
low the game almost as if they were
actually doing the playing.
Women Play Basketball Too
Then, many women have played
basketball, but none have ever played
football. (Alas, there are plenty who
would like to), and when you can do
something yourself, you always have
a greater interest in seeing just how
much better the other fellow can do
it than you can.
Excitement is a feminine craving,
and plenty of that is furnished in a
basketball game. The speed with
which ten men go tearing around the
floor is positively breath-taking. The
chances a player takes in making a
I

basket from the middle of the floor
furnishes the desired element of sus
pense.
Court Game Abounds in Humor
Then the humor. Women lik-e to
laugh, although some cynical men
probably think they don't because
they are afraid of making their mouths
too big. At a football game, when a
perfectly good player is carried off
011 a stretcher absolutely motionless
or writhing With pain, it is far from
pleasant for the women's rooting sec
tion. At a basketball game, however,
the players hurdle madly over each
other and accomplish some really
beautiful spills and find themselves in
extraordinary positions without actu
ally being hurt.
When a player stoops down to get
the ball with one leg gracefully arched
in the air, follies fashion, and an op
posing player bears down on him and
grabs said leg in the hope of separat
ing his opponent from the ball, that's
really entertaining.

really entertaining.
The Game of Skill —An Art
"Art is anything where skill is di
rected for the gratification of taste,"
It is the human element 111 basket
ball that appeals to Stanford women.
In this game they are able to see
every player and even watch the ex
pressions 011 their faces, while in foot
ball it is more of a panorama. Basket
ball players seem less like automa
tons; even their remarks can be heard,!
and these words of wisdom are at!
times enlightening—and of interest to J
the women. Because of the nearness ;
of the players, the spectators become '
intensely interested and they can fol
low the game almost as if they were
actually doing the playing.
Women Play Basketball Too
Then, many women have played
basketball, but none have ever played
football. (Alas, there are plenty who
would like to), and when you can do
something yourself, you always have
a greater interest in seeing just how
much better the other fellow can do
it than you can.
Excitement is a feminine craving,
and plenty of that is furnished in a
basketball game. The speed with
which ten men go tearing around the
floor is positively breath-taking. The

basket from the middle of the floor
furnishes the desired element of sus

Court Game Abounds in Humor
Then the humor. Women lik-e to
laugh, although some cynical men
probably think they don't because
they are afraid of making their mouths
too big. At a football game, when a
perfectly good player is carried off
011 a stretcher absolutely motionless
or writhing With pain, it is far from
pleasant for the women's rooting sec
tion. At a basketball game, however,
the players hurdle madly over each
other and accomplish some really
beautiful spills and find themselves in
extraordinary positions without actu
ally being hurt.
When a player stoops down to get
the ball with one leg gracefully arched
in the air, follies fashion, and an op
posing player bears down on him and
grabs said leg in the hope of separat
ing his opponent from the ball, that's
really entertaining.
