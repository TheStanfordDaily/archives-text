# "DOPE" FULLER AFTER SAN FRANCISCO-SAN JOSE SKATE RECORD
## 
### 
Dana "Dope" Fuller will try next
Friday night to demonstrate his right
to the title of world champion long
distance skater.
It is not with the idea of giving the
newspapers something to take the
space formerly filled by the long dis
tance dancers, but for the purpose of
settling various wagers, that "Dope"
will start on his trip.
The weapons will be roller skates.
The field of battle will be the San
Francisco-San Jose highway, and the
start of Fuller's daring race against
time will take place in front of the
St. Francis Hotel, San Francisco, at
10 p.m. Friday night.
To win the bet, Fuller must com
plete the 52-mile trip within a period
of 24 hours. He is not permitted by the
terms of the contract to tie himself
