The speediest intramural game yes
terday was that in which Alpha Delta
Phi defeated Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 19-
11. Other winners yesterday were: El
Campo, Delta Tau Delta, Encina Sec
ond, and Theta Chi.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon first took the
lead in its contest with the Alpha
Delts. The latter, however, soon hit
their stride, and things went fast and
furious. Real teamwork and varsity
tactics were used by both sides.
Phelps at center starred for the
Alpha Delts. He covered the floor well
and showed a good eye for the bas
ket, tipping one in and almost getting
another. Dennis and Neer also showed
up well for the Alpha Delts. Gibbons
was high point man for S. A. E., mak
ing ten of their eleven tallies.
El Campo Wins
El Campo defeated Zeta Psi, 10-0, in
the first game in the afternoon. The
Zetes were handicapped by the fact
that some of their regular men were
engaged in baseball practice and could
not participate.
Hobro, Schoen, and Beardsley
showed up well for El Campo. Hobro
is also a member of the Stanford 130-
pound team.
Delta Tau Delta scored its fourth
successive win in a triumph over the
Panthers, 18-7. Collet accounted for
12 points for the Delta Taus. Morrison
