# RUSHING PERIOD FOR WINTER QUARTER IS TO CLOSE MARCH 9
## 
### 
March 9th is the new date set by
the Interfraternity Council as the last
day of rushing for the Winter quarter.
This decision was reached in view of
the fact that rushing would neces
sarily interfere with preparation for
the final examinations which start on
March 18th.
Hushing will Ire continued again
with the taking up of the Spring quar
ter and will proceed under the same
rules that are in operation now, for a
period of two weeks, at the end of
which time formal bidding will take
place.
