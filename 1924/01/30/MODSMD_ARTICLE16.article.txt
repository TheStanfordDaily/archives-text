# STANFORD WILL PLAY SAGEBRUSH FIVE TOMORROW
## Nevada Considered One of Strongest Quintets in Western Leagues 
### 
Nevada, confident after the showing
made by its quintet against the Cali
fornia five Monday, and last night,
will meet the Stanford varsity in the
pavilion tomorrow night. Another
game will be played on Saturday, Feb
ruary 2.
The lighting Wolf aggregation took
most of the wind out of the Bruin
sails and managed to lead the Berke
ley quintet for three straight quarters
before the Bears made their terrific
rally which gave them a 51 to 31 vic
tory over Nevada. California won the
second game 24 to 18.
Nevada Is Fast
Which means that Nevada is noth
ing to pass by with a slight wave of
the hand. In fact the Wolf pack has
never been that kind of a team. Four
times during its basketball career it
has been champion of the Intercolle
giate Basketball League.
Those were the days when "Rabbit"
Bradshaw donned the abbreviated suit
for Nevada. Now Bradshaw is an alum
nus, but with three veterans, Frede
ricks, Scranton, and Harrison, still on
the line-up it is no wonder that Coach
Courtw right is not worried a great
deal over his 1924 material.
Veterans Strong
Harrison is Nevada's fighting cen
ter. From the time he tips off the
ball at the pivot position he is after a
score, playing ruthlessly, sometimes
too much so.
Scranton is an old football veteran
at Nevada. He is holding down the
standing guard position this year.
Scranton is another fight-to-the-finish
man.
Kerr Changes Defense
Andy Kerr changed his defensive
tactics somewhat in the last U. S. C.
game. Instead of playing Dave Oliva
further back toward the goal, the big
guard was allowed to rove more about
the center position. This served partly
to stop Campbell's dribbling drives,
and it also allowed Oliva to get a try
at the goal. Dave managed to cage a
long field score just when every point
was advantageous to the Stanford
team.
It is no end of relief to realize that
the Stanford quintet has a wonderful
recuperative power. Perhaps most of
the come-back was due to the shooting
prowess of."Nip" McHose, but it was
also aided a great deal by the concen
trated teamwork which the Cards
were able to put into effect so readily.
