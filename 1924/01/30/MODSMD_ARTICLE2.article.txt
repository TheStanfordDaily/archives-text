# SAN JOSE HIGH FIVE PLAYS BABES TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's babes will tangle with
the San Jose high school five at 8
o'clock this evening in the pavilion.
The game will be preceded by the
145-pound team-Palo Alto high clash.
San Jose high defeated the San
Jose Teachers College team recently.
The Teachers met the Babes last week
and played them to a standstill, fight
ing for three extra periods before the
Babes finally came out ahead. This
seems to point to a close, hard-fought
battle tonight.
The freshmen are determined to go
through the preliminary season with
out a defeat. They have already stop
ped the best junior college teams in
the northern part of the state, and
aren't inclined to let any high school
aggregation slip over a win.
The same line-up will start the
game tonight that started against
Fresno on Saturday. Price and David
will be the forwards; Jayred, center;
and Shipkey and Newhouse, guards.
Anderson will probably alternate with
Jayred. and Blazier Riese and South
worth may see service at tlie forward
positions.
Shipkey and Newhouse have been
doing their work in steady fashion, al
though neither of them is starring.
Shipkey has been getting more shots
in the last few games than he did at
the start of the season and may de
velop into a scoring running guard.
All of the regulars are good varsity
material for next year and in addition
to the first-string men. several of the
substitutes are of varsity calibre.
