# FREAK BETS
## 
### 
Announcement now comes forth that a Stanford student is going to
skate t rom the St. Francis to the \ endome, on a dare with remuneration
attached.
This spirit of adventure we admire greatly; we might even suggest
that some one take up a dare, hereby given, to turn a series of cartwheels
into the Memorial Church and turn them out again without putting more
than one foot at a time through the same window.
Seriously, though, we should like to see some enterprising student
start a jitney skate service from Palo Alto, for the purpose of towing
people to class on time.
Freak bets at this time of year are quite apropos; the most unheard
of bet we have ever heard of is that made by a student who flunked his
mid-quarter; he bet his professor he could get an A grade in the final ex
amination, and won. Very few of the freak gamblers coiMd do that.
