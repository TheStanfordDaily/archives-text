### 
A communication is now traveling through the postoffice, from the
Executive Committee to the Board of Athletic Control. It recommends
that the Glee Club be put under the direction of the Graduate Manager,
who will have charge of publicity, finances, concerts, and outside trips.
This move is so obvious a benefit to both parties, to the Glee Club
through the added interest due to the efficient management of an estab
lished machine, and to the Board of Athletic Control through the adver
tising given to Stanford and through the revenue derived, that it will
probably be accepted with amazement that no one had thought of such a
beneficial scheme before now.
