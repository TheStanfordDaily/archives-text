# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: —
Last Saturday three sophomore
baseball managers and I put up pos
ters on the campus to advertise the
Varsity-Olympic Club game, which is
to be played on the second of Febru
ary. Two days later there were no
posters left in the conspicuous places
where they belong.
These posters may make very nice
decorations for the room, but a stu
dent is certainly lacking in' Stanford
spirit when he destroys publicity for
any sport—especially a major sport.
Support is needed by the men who
work hard to make a winning team.
That is what publicity and advertising
are for.
Does a real Stanford man believe
that the decorations in his room are
more important than our varsity
teams? If so, that is why the posters
put up at Encina hall, the Postoffice,
and several oltier places are gone.
—A JUNIOR MANAGER.
