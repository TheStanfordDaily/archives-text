On How to Approach and Retreat
Nothing is more important tluin the correct approach. Much more im

After you get your hair and tie adjusted, and after you have assumed the
correct reportorial attitude, enter the sanctum. It's all right, there won't be
anybody there.
Don't try to think up an opening sentence. You won't be able to say
anything anyhow. If by any freak of misfortune, you do see the subject of
the interview, ignore him. He isn't important. It is you that conveys the
message to the peepul. You is it.
Be creative! Write your own message. If it so happens that the desk editor
is so dumb to consider your views unimportant as such, tell him that the man
you interviewed said so. It would be better to incorporate the same idea In
your story.
Be sure and get your name on the by-line. —R. S.
