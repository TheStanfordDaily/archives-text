(just to pad out the column)
Resolved, that there should or should not be any water in the swimming pool.
Water, water, everywhere
And not a Scotch to drink.
—Ab-Doman Allah.
Contests Number 3, 4, 5, and 6
Why, oh, why, must a nightingale die?
Who framed the Firpo bout?
Where, oh, where, is the kidnapped heir?
And what makes my hair fall out.
