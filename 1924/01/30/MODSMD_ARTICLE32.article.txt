# PLAY TO BE GIVEN FEBRUARY 28, WORK OF R. B. FITZGERALD
## 
### 
"Michael's Mother" has been chosen
as one of the three one-act plays
which are to be given 011 February
28 in the Assembly hall. It was com
posed by Robert B. Fitzgerald, a
graduate student in the English de
partment.
The play, according to Gordon
Davis, is unusually well written and
brings in a pleasing combination of
pathos and humor. It is practical and
can be considered a good indication
of the other two plays, which will be
chosen soon. The cast, which consists

of five characters, has not yet been
chosen.
Three one-act plays are written by
the class in dramatic composition
under the direction of Professor H. D.
Gray of the English department. The
theatrical workshop class produces
the playettes, taking charge of the
directing, costuming, designing, stage
scenery, and the acting.
