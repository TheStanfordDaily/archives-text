January 14 —Two hundred and nine
ty men will try for places on crew,
baseball, and track teams. The candi
dates signed up at the spring rally
held In Encina hall last night. There
is a greater wealth of material for the
varsity shell than at any time for sev
eral years, and in baseball, six of last
year's championship team will again
don togs. The Stanford band appeared
for the first time in years at the open
ing rally of the year.
Lagunita is rising rapidly toward
the point of overflow in spite of pre
cautions which have been taken. The
heavy storm last night and tliis morn
ing raised the high water mark to
within a few feet of the main outlet
pipe. If the top of the drain in front
of the boathouse is reachd, the cam
pus will be threatened with flood wa
ters. The season's rainfall has been
13.63 inches to date. The fall during
the last twenty-four hours was .72
inches.
* * *
January 15 —Final action with re
gard to the interpretation of the Uni
versity rule against "rag" dancing was
taken last night by the Women's Con
ference. The matter has been fully dis
cussed by the conference and the joint
men's and women's councils as to the
interpretation which would make for
the most lasting welfare of Stanford
social life. As a result of the discus
sion the Women's Conference passed
the following resolution: Resolved,
That any attempted evasion of the
rule in the form of college dances
shall be considered a violation of con
ference ruling.
Sixty-seven degrees for Christmas
graduates were granted by action of
the Academic Council. Of this number,
58 were Bachelor of Arts, as compared
with 67 such degrees given last Christ
mas.
+ * *
January 16—Eighty men and women
qualified in the preliminary Junior
Opera tryouts. W. F. Rochester of the
American School of Opera will coach
the 1915 operatic venture, the "College
Prince."
Seven Stanford women met last
night and organized the Women's
Mandolin club.
Eligibility of Stanford women for
participation in athletic games will no
longer depend on two months of pre
vious practice, but will rest with the
judgment of the captain and manager
of the activity concerned.

January 19 —One of the cleverest
ideas yet attempted for the Pre Pan
ama Exposition will be a "Kewpie";
booth, according to the committee in
charge. The plan is to sell "Kewpies"
of all sort and sizes in various cos- j
tumes. A large one dressed in a var
sity sweater will be raffled during the
afternoon. There seems to be such a
demand for these new toys that the
booth will unquestionably be a suc
cess."
An innovation was introduced to the
Stanford, stage at the Glee Club con
cert in the form of "Scottish Favo
rites." The program of the concert
was divided into two parts. The first
included a series of individual and
combined productions by the members
of the Glee Club, while the second
was a scene in a fraternity house: "As
we live and dress on the Stanford
'Farm'." "Roughneck" attire and the
general college atmosphere of a room
in a fraternity house formed the set
ting.

January 16—Eighty men and women
qualified in the preliminary Junior
Opera tryouts. W. F. Rochester of the
American School of Opera will coach
the 1915 operatic venture, the "College
Prince."
Seven Stanford women met last
night and organized the Women's
Mandolin club.
Eligibility of Stanford women for
participation in athletic games will no
longer depend on two months of pre
vious practice, but will rest with the
judgment of the captain and manager
of the activity concerned.

January 19 —One of the cleverest
ideas yet attempted for the Pre Pan
ama Exposition will be a "Kewpie";
booth, according to the committee in
charge. The plan is to sell "Kewpies"
of all sort and sizes in various cos- j
tumes. A large one dressed in a var
sity sweater will be raffled during the
afternoon. There seems to be such a
demand for these new toys that the
booth will unquestionably be a suc
cess."
An innovation was introduced to the
Stanford, stage at the Glee Club con
cert in the form of "Scottish Favo
rites." The program of the concert
was divided into two parts. The first
included a series of individual and
combined productions by the members
of the Glee Club, while the second
was a scene in a fraternity house: "As
we live and dress on the Stanford
'Farm'." "Roughneck" attire and the
general college atmosphere of a room
in a fraternity house formed the set
ting.
January 14 —Two hundred and nine
ty men will try for places on crew,
baseball, and track teams. The candi
dates signed up at the spring rally
held In Encina hall last night. There
is a greater wealth of material for the
varsity shell than at any time for sev
eral years, and in baseball, six of last
year's championship team will again
don togs. The Stanford band appeared
for the first time in years at the open
ing rally of the year.
Lagunita is rising rapidly toward
the point of overflow in spite of pre
cautions which have been taken. The
heavy storm last night and tliis morn
ing raised the high water mark to
within a few feet of the main outlet
pipe. If the top of the drain in front
of the boathouse is reachd, the cam
pus will be threatened with flood wa
ters. The season's rainfall has been
13.63 inches to date. The fall during
the last twenty-four hours was .72
inches.

January 15 —Final action with re
gard to the interpretation of the Uni
versity rule against "rag" dancing was
taken last night by the Women's Con
ference. The matter has been fully dis
cussed by the conference and the joint
men's and women's councils as to the
interpretation which would make for
the most lasting welfare of Stanford
social life. As a result of the discus
sion the Women's Conference passed
the following resolution: Resolved,
That any attempted evasion of the
rule in the form of college dances
shall be considered a violation of con
ference ruling.
Sixty-seven degrees for Christmas
graduates were granted by action of
the Academic Council. Of this number,
58 were Bachelor of Arts, as compared
with 67 such degrees given last Christ
mas.
