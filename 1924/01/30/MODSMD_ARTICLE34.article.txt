# SPORTS OF 1924

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among the numerous foreign invaders of the "Land of the Free and the
Home of the Bootlegger" in 1924 will be a collection of livestock, individually
classified as Epinard and Firpo. Epinard, the French race horse, will be four
years old on his next birthday, while Firpo, the wild bull, will be twenty-seven.
If Epinard was twenty-seven and Firpo four, neither one would be much good
in a race for a fight.
"Epinard," being translated from the French, means Spinach, while many
think that the true translation of the Argentine word "Firpo" is Apple Sauce.
Anyway, they are both coming after the same thing and you spell it J-A-C-K.
Epinard will try to win "beaucoup Jack" for his owner, Pierre Wertheimer,
while Firpo will come to fight our heavyweight champion, Jack.
Yes, little boys and girls, Zev eats Spinach and Dempsey just adores Apple
Sauce.
