## 
### 
"Babe" White, El Hombre Mosco,
scaled the dizzy heights of Palo Alto's
highest skyscraper, all three stories
of it, last night before a gasping multi
tude that blocked University avenue.
Pausing ever and anon to eloquent
ly impress his audience with the ap
palling danger of his feat, El Senor
Tobacco advertisement held the
throng's money in two galvanized iron
boxes. "Give until it hurts, because if
I fall it will hurt me," was his plea.
Aided by appropriate ropes and
cpen windows, the man who smokes
Mexican cigars reached the flag pole
of the building, did a nice bow, and
retired —shekels and all.
