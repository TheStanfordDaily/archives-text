# LEGINSKA TO PLAY ORIGINAL SOLOS AT MONDAY CONCERT
## 
### 
A treat not allowed to the people
of San Francisco is to be given Stan
ford concert audiences.
Ethel Leginska, famous pianiste—
and composer—has consented to play
tlirejp solo numbers on her program
to be given Monday evening in the
Assembly hall in conjunction with the
San Francisco Chamber Music Society.
This concession she has flatly refused
to grant in her San Francisco appear
ances, preferring to blend her artistry
with the work of the Chamber Music
group.
Beethoven's Rondo Capriccio ("Rage
Over a Lost Coin"), and two Chopin
selections, Etude in E Major Op. 10
and Etude in A Minor Op. 25 are her
choices for the campus concert.
Whispering Gargoyles Interpreted
The sneering, demoniacal gargoyles
of Notre Dame form the theme of one
of Leginska's best-known original
pieces, many of which she will use
as encores to her solo program. Le
ginska has been placed on a par with
Paderewski by critics in the East and
in London, because of the brilliant
compositions she has written herself.
A vivid picture of "The Gargoyles of
Notre Dame is given in a review of
one of her recent concertß, thus:
"The weird figures of Notre Dame
leap into life; the high places and the
low, the satanic and the ludicrous;
those with their tongues out, saying
things to each other, passing sardonic
comments on the turbid human folk
who gaze on them.
"They gather closer to pass some
judgment; a wind starts in a sudden
gust; they vanish, with a half-choked
laugh left hanging in the air."
Another Leginska composition,
"From a Life," is a fresh, original
work of the new school, suited to the
artiste's unconventional temperament
and technique.
Flute Soloist on Program
Because of the rarity of flute solo
ists, the trio number of Carl Maria
von Weber, a charming example of
the romantic school which will open
the concert, is seldom heard. This
piece, to be played by Leginska, Elias
Hecht, flutist, and Walter Ferner, vio
loncellist ,is Op. G3, in G Minor, in
cluding the allegro moderato, scherzo, I
(allegro vivace), andante espressivo, ;
and allegro.
The colorful Hungarian school is to
be interpreted, following Leginska's j
solo offerings, by the quintet in B
flat major of Nandor Zsolt, a con
temporary composer. This work is
arranged for piano and a quartet of
strings and will be played by Legin
ska, Louis Pefsinger, first violinist,
Louis Ford, second violinist, Walter
Ferner, 'cellist, and Nathan Firestone, I
viola. It includes Adagio maestoso —
allegro; adagio ma hon troppo; scher
zo; allegro con fuoco.
