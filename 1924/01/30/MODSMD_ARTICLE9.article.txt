# GOUDKOFF SPEAKS ON LOW ECONOMIC STATUS OF SIBERIA
## Normal Conditions to Bring Development of Great Mining Resources 
### 
Compared with the resources of
other countries, Siberian resources are
virgin, and will be developed when
economic conditions are normal. This
was the view of Professor Paul P.
Goudkoff, formerly of the School of
Mines at Tomsk, Siberia, giving an
illustrated lecture on the economic de
velopment of Siberia last night in the
Assembly hall.
Locations of Wealth
Professor Goudkoff gave a summary
of the most important geographical
facts concerning the position of Si
berian resources, and possibilities for
wealth. With the aid of lantern slides,
he showed the great area of Siberia,
tracing the courses of the important
river systems. He located the regions
where wheat-raising and cattle-raising
had been attempted, and where the
mineral wealth was most abundant.
The early history of the territory
from the time when it was invaded by
the Cossacks, until the settlers reach
ed the Pacific Coast and had started
development of the mineral resources
of the land were reviewed by Profes
sor Goudkoff. He emphasized the simi
larity between the westward move
ment of the United States and the
rush for gold, other minerals and fur
trading craze which attracted the ex
plorers to Siberia.
Early Mining Development
The three periods of development of
mining were outlined by Professor
Goudkoff. The first, in the eighteenth
century, when there were very few
people in Siberia, poor means of com
munication and no transportation fa
cilities, and therefore a time when
only crude equipment was obtainable.
The great losses sustained made it
necessary to mine only in the richest
