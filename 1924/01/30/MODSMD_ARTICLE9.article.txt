# GOUDKOFF SPEAKS ON LOW ECONOMIC STATUS OF SIBERIA
## Normal Conditions to Bring Development of Great Mining Resources 
### 
Compared with the resources of
other countries, Siberian resources are
virgin, and will be developed when
economic conditions are normal. This
was the view of Professor Paul P.
Goudkoff, formerly of the School of
Mines at Tomsk, Siberia, giving an
illustrated lecture on the economic de
velopment of Siberia last night in the
Assembly hall.
Locations of Wealth
Professor Goudkoff gave a summary
of the most important geographical
facts concerning the position of Si
berian resources, and possibilities for
wealth. With the aid of lantern slides,
he showed the great area of Siberia,
tracing the courses of the important
river systems. He located the regions
where wheat-raising and cattle-raising
had been attempted, and where the
mineral wealth was most abundant.
The early history of the territory
from the time when it was invaded by
the Cossacks, until the settlers reach
ed the Pacific Coast and had started
development of the mineral resources
of the land were reviewed by Profes
sor Goudkoff. He emphasized the simi
larity between the westward move
ment of the United States and the
rush for gold, other minerals and fur
trading craze which attracted the ex
plorers to Siberia.
Early Mining Development
The three periods of development of
mining were outlined by Professor
Goudkoff. The first, in the eighteenth
century, when there were very few
people in Siberia, poor means of com
munication and no transportation fa
cilities, and therefore a time when
only crude equipment was obtainable.
The great losses sustained made it
necessary to mine only in the richest
parts, and finally to abandon all pro
jects.
During the second period, the re
sults were more favorable, following
Professor Goudkoff's theory that the
development of industry follows that
of the economic life and conditions.
Under new organization, with greatly
improved methods of mining, and the
introduction of new mechanical de
vices, the period of the nineteenth
century was prosperous. Mining was
carried on on a greater scale of pro
duction, and railways facilitated trans
portation. Copper mining became ex
tensive, and gold and all other metals
were extracted with success.
The development of coal mining did
not take place until the second half
of the century, since the dense forests
had always furnished enough lumber
without looking for fuel. This industry
was enlarged by the increase in popu
lation, due to the great horde of peo
ple being driven out of Russia by the
war.
Last Period Promising
During the last decade, after the
trans-Siberian railway was completed,
there was an enormous increase in
the output of the Amur region. Coal
mines in the Urals were highly de
veloped, and then had to cease opera
tions on account of economic condi
tions.
Gold mining has the greatest pos
sibilities, according to Professor Goud
koff, and coal will be extensively
mined in the future, for the need of
these materials will be great. The
revolution stopped all the wonderful
developments expected, but they will
be realized when normalcy is regained,
he predicts.

During the second period, the re
sults were more favorable, following
Professor Goudkoff's theory that the
development of industry follows that
of the economic life and conditions.
Under new organization, with greatly
improved methods of mining, and the
introduction of new mechanical de
vices, the period of the nineteenth
century was prosperous. Mining was
carried on on a greater scale of pro
duction, and railways facilitated trans
portation. Copper mining became ex
tensive, and gold and all other metals
were extracted with success.
The development of coal mining did
not take place until the second half
of the century, since the dense forests
had always furnished enough lumber
without looking for fuel. This industry
was enlarged by the increase in popu
lation, due to the great horde of peo
ple being driven out of Russia by the
war.
Last Period Promising
During the last decade, after the
trans-Siberian railway was completed,
there was an enormous increase in
the output of the Amur region. Coal
mines in the Urals were highly de
veloped, and then had to cease opera
tions on account of economic condi
tions.
Gold mining has the greatest pos
sibilities, according to Professor Goud
koff, and coal will be extensively
mined in the future, for the need of
these materials will be great. The
revolution stopped all the wonderful
developments expected, but they will
be realized when normalcy is regained,
he predicts.
Compared with the resources of
other countries, Siberian resources are
virgin, and will be developed when
economic conditions are normal. This
was the view of Professor Paul P.
Goudkoff, formerly of the School of
Mines at Tomsk, Siberia, giving an
illustrated lecture on the economic de
velopment of Siberia last night in the
Assembly hall.
Locations of Wealth
Professor Goudkoff gave a summary
of the most important geographical
facts concerning the position of Si
berian resources, and possibilities for
wealth. With the aid of lantern slides,
he showed the great area of Siberia,
tracing the courses of the important
river systems. He located the regions
where wheat-raising and cattle-raising
had been attempted, and where the
mineral wealth was most abundant.
The early history of the territory
from the time when it was invaded by
the Cossacks, until the settlers reach
ed the Pacific Coast and had started
development of the mineral resources
of the land were reviewed by Profes
sor Goudkoff. He emphasized the simi
larity between the westward move
ment of the United States and the
rush for gold, other minerals and fur
trading craze which attracted the ex
plorers to Siberia.
Early Mining Development
The three periods of development of
mining were outlined by Professor
Goudkoff. The first, in the eighteenth
century, when there were very few
people in Siberia, poor means of com
munication and no transportation fa
cilities, and therefore a time when
only crude equipment was obtainable.
The great losses sustained made it
necessary to mine only in the richest
parts, and finally to abandon all pro
jects.

sults were more favorable, following
Professor Goudkoff's theory that the
