# NEVADA FIVE IS EXPECTED TO GIVE CARDINALS STIFF FIGHT
## Kerr's Quintet Should Profit By Hard Workouts Preparatory To California Contest 
### 
\TEVADA, bringing the stiff competition the Cardinals need in preparation for
the California games, will meet the Stanford quintet at 8 o'clock tonight
and Saturday, in contests prospectively hard-fought.
The Sagebrushers, with a strong offensive and defensive team, have given
California two hard fights during the past week, and the reputation of the
California team makes this considerable of a recommendation for the
Nevadans.
Last season the Cards walloped Nevada in two games, 18 to 12, and 17 to 10.
Both contests were never in doubt, for the Cardinal five scored at will
throughout the series.
Three Veterans Return From Reno
The veterans who showed up best for Nevada in these games were
Fredericks, who will play forward tonight, Scranton, and Harrison, who will
—<$>play guard and center respectively.

Ray Mcßurney's work in the last
U. S. C. contest was more than satis
factory. Mcßurney stuck himself to
Campbell in the second game and he
hung there like a burr. Even during
the dribbling offensive of the flashy
Trojan forward, Mcßurney was al
ways on Campbell's heels.
"Nip" McHose, with his last-period
comeback in Saturday's game, proved
that he can be depended on to be the
varsity's most consistent scorer.
Stanford Stronger
The Stanford quintet is developing
into a squad which will be hard to
beat as the season progresses. With
two such forwards as McHose and
Nevers to bolster the offensive, guards
like Dave Oliva and Ray Mcßurney on
the defensive, and Steele for center,
it looms as one of the strong con
tenders for the honors o fthe Pacific
Coast Conference championship.
Dave Oliva got in a few licks of his
own in the U. S. C. series. He scored
a total of five points for the two
games. In the last game especially, his
score aided in Lying the score at the
end of the second period.
