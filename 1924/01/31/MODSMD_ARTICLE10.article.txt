# THREE UNDEFEATED QUINTETS WIN IN INTRAMURAL SERIES
## 
### 
El Toro and Theta Xi in League 1
and El Cuadro in League 7 remained
undefeated yesterday in round four of
the intramural series.
Phi Sigma Kappa and Sequoia Sec
ond also won their games. El Cuadro
won by the default of Alpha Siga Phi.
The Theta Xi-Delta Upsilon contest
was fast but erratic. Theta Xi took
the lead, Mulcahy and Porterfield each
making a goal in the first few minutes.
Delta Upsilon tightened up and the
half ended 5-5. In the second half
Theta Xi sank three goals, while the
D. U.'s failed to score, Theta Xi win
ning 11-5.
Mulcahy, Porterfield, and Lawrence
starred for Theta Xi, playing consistent
games. Baker at center was the Delta
Upsilon mainstay.
El Toro Too Heavy for Chinese.
El Toro defeated the Chinese Club.
31-21. El Toro had a great advantage
over its opponents, both in height and
i weight. This did not seem to disturb
the Chinese Club players, however.
When they could gain possession of
the ball, they generally managed to
ring up a goal.
Although Ludeke, El Toro center,
had fully two feet on his opponent, the
Club-men made things rather hot for
the victors.
The final scorc was El Toro, 31; Chi
nese Club, 21.
Perhaps the hottest game of the day
was that in which Phi Sigma Kappa
won fram Alpha Omega, X-6. The
game was fast, with rough tactics show
ing occasionally. Neither team could
locate the basket at first, the half end
ing 4-2 in favor of A. T. O. Morrison
of Phi Sigma Kappa opened the second
half with a goal, tying the score. Both
teams increased their pace. Phi Sigma
Kappa drawing into the lead near the
score 17 to 5, Hunt started sending in
substitutes.
The half ended 19 to 7 for the
Babes.
Regulars Return
The regulars went back at the start
of the second half. Price opened the
scoring when he received a pass while
alone under the basket. David scored
a long shot, and Jayred made two in
rapid succession. Anderson went in
tor Jayred and the Quarter ended soon
after.
During the final period Hunt used
thirteen men, and the substitutes man
aged to hold the San Jose team from
scoring. Hoffman got the only basket
during this period. The final score
was 30 to 12.

Stanfordâ€” San Jose-
