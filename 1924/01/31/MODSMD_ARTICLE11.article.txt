# DEMOCRACY NEEDS INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM SAYS J. H. BARNES
## Assembly Speaker Outlines Three Ideals for Self-Governing Nation 
### 
Julius Barnes thinks that the suc
i cess of American democracy depends
I on its adherence to three fundamental
I ideals:
First, the industrial ideal of trans
luting the natural resources into
wealth in a manner that will provide
the greatest benefit for all.
Second, the social ideal of giving an
j equal opportunity for every one of
j equal industry, ability, and character.
Third, the political ideal of develop
i ing a government primarily for the
promotion of fair play among indi
' viduals seeking wealth and happiness.
This was the basis of his argument
for industrial development in an As
sembly address at 11 o'clock today.
"Few men have accomplished so
; much in government, business, and so
! cial service," said Dr. Wlibur, intro
ducing Mr. Barnes. "As director of
the United States Food Administra
tion Grain Corporation, he carried on
one of the greatest operations in his
tory without a jar, and with so much
ease that no one knew he was doing
it."
Barnes is now president of the
American Chamber of Commerce,
president of the Barnes-Ames Wheat
Exporting Company, and chairman of
the New York Institute for Public
| Service.
Self-Government Still Experiment
"Self-government for free peoples is
| under trial," said Mr. Barnes. "In
; Europe there are seven governments
j under dictatorship which have had
: self-government. The case of Russia
shows a complete failure of self-gov
: ernment. But dictatorship is contrary
: to the development of American in
dustry and to the ideals of American
government.
I "With the almost instant clirystalli
zation of public opinion made possible
! bv the newspapers and telegraph, the
■ old methods of reflections of public
opinion by election of officials every
j two years or so is too slow.
"Observation of other nations shows
that the system of responsible minis
try destroys continuity and responsi
bility in the execution of public af-
I fairs.
I "The American government must
j find the middle way. It found one,
where Europe did not, in the question
i of government or private owenership
j America answered the question by
governmental supervision and regula
j tion of railroads and industries.
"The modern industrial era began
with the invention of the steam engin#
in 1781. It was coincident with the
beginning of the American experiment
in self-government. At that time th«
j total wealth of the world was a hun
-1 dred billion dollars. Within three hun
| dred years the wealth of the American
, nation alone is estimated at three
hundred billion dollars.
"With industrial progress, inven
tions, and organization, we have one
man doing the work of from ten to
forty. Is there unempolyment? No, the
workers are being absorbed into bet
ter and better positions and greater
i earnings.
"Is the vast wealth produced being
distributed fairly? The answer is
found in the number of cars on the
railroads and the trucks on the high
ways carrying into millions and mil
lions of homes all the products of mod
i ern industry."

Self-Government Still Experiment
"Self-government for free peoples is
| under trial," said Mr. Barnes. "In
; Europe there are seven governments
j under dictatorship which have had
: self-government. The case of Russia
shows a complete failure of self-gov
: ernment. But dictatorship is contrary
: to the development of American in
dustry and to the ideals of American
government.
I "With the almost instant clirystalli
zation of public opinion made possible
! bv the newspapers and telegraph, the
■ old methods of reflections of public
opinion by election of officials every
j two years or so is too slow.
"Observation of other nations shows
that the system of responsible minis
try destroys continuity and responsi
bility in the execution of public af-
I fairs.
I "The American government must
j find the middle way. It found one,
where Europe did not, in the question
i of government or private owenership
j America answered the question by
governmental supervision and regula
j tion of railroads and industries.
"The modern industrial era began
with the invention of the steam engin#
in 1781. It was coincident with the
beginning of the American experiment
in self-government. At that time th«
j total wealth of the world was a hun
-1 dred billion dollars. Within three hun
| dred years the wealth of the American
, nation alone is estimated at three
hundred billion dollars.
"With industrial progress, inven
tions, and organization, we have one
man doing the work of from ten to
forty. Is there unempolyment? No, the
workers are being absorbed into bet
ter and better positions and greater
i earnings.
"Is the vast wealth produced being
distributed fairly? The answer is
found in the number of cars on the
railroads and the trucks on the high
ways carrying into millions and mil
lions of homes all the products of mod
i ern industry."
Julius Barnes thinks that the suc
i cess of American democracy depends
I on its adherence to three fundamental
I ideals:
First, the industrial ideal of trans
luting the natural resources into
wealth in a manner that will provide
the greatest benefit for all.
Second, the social ideal of giving an
j equal opportunity for every one of
j equal industry, ability, and character.
Third, the political ideal of develop
i ing a government primarily for the
promotion of fair play among indi
' viduals seeking wealth and happiness.
This was the basis of his argument
for industrial development in an As
sembly address at 11 o'clock today.
"Few men have accomplished so
; much in government, business, and so
! cial service," said Dr. Wlibur, intro
ducing Mr. Barnes. "As director of
the United States Food Administra
tion Grain Corporation, he carried on
one of the greatest operations in his
tory without a jar, and with so much
ease that no one knew he was doing
it."
Barnes is now president of the
American Chamber of Commerce,
president of the Barnes-Ames Wheat
Exporting Company, and chairman of
the New York Institute for Public
