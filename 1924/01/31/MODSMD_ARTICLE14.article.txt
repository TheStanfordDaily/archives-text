# WASTED CARDBOARD

### 
People who are used as examples in the meting out of discipline usually
feel very sorry for themselves; and usually they receive a disproportionate
amount of sympathy.
However, in the case of Delta Sigma Rho, debating honor society, no
one who has seen the decorations tacked on trees and poles about the cam
pus can feel very sad about their impending punishment by the Men's
Council.
The Executive Committee has had the topic of promiscuous poster ad
vertising thoroughly discussed, has sent out warnings, made threats to
individual organizations (and received the excuse of ignorance), all ap
parently with no effect.
It is hoped by those who have to go about the campus with their eves
open to the scenery that plain good taste will come to the aid of societies still
ignorant of the poster rule, and prevent another unsightly exhibition of
cardboard.
