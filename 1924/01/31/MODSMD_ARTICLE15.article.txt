## 
### 
A graduate student advances the theory that notes taken on most
courses are a pure waste of time, and should he reduced to an invisible
minimum. His theory, expressed,while waiting for a late professor, was
to the effect that he would never take a note, except that professors expect
him to have a pen in his hand and write something with it.
Notes are a short cut laziness, when one boils down the topic; they en
able a student to forget what has been said in his course and think about
other things until time for an examination. Then he runs through the
notebook annex to his brain, often without opening up the main building.
Writing letters is the last resort in some courses in which it is neces
hary for appearances' sake to wield a pen, but useless to take notes be
cause the lectures can be summarized as "repeat from yesterday."
