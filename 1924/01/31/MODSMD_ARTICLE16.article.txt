# PENN RELAYS ASSUME INTERNATIONAL ASPECT
## 
### 
The Penn Relays, held this spring
at the University of Pensylvania for
the thirtieth time, will bring together
in the space of two days many of the
greatest oval stars in the world. Cam
bridge University will send a great
team from England, and the English
sprint champion may be present to
compete with American talent.
Cambridge will probably choose to
enter the two-mile relay, as three of
the fastest half-milers in England are
attending that university. Cambridge
will also enter the medley relay, us
ing one man who placed first in three
events in the combination Cambridge-
Oxford, Harvard-Yale meet last July.
The University of Havana, Cuba,
' will send a team, Occidental College
will go East, Canada will be repre
' sented by several universities, and sev-
I
eral Australian collegiate stars may
; drop in on their way to the Olympic
I games. â€¢
Though invitations were sent out
! only a week ago, more than 600 col
leges have sent word that they will
be on hand. The Relay Carnival may
have bearing on the decision of the
Olympic Comittee in choosing the
American team.

Tlie call of "Quecner" heard at Stan
ford basketball games is not as string
] ent as the treatment which will be
; meted out to men at the University of
| Washington who sit with women dur
ing the games. These offenders will be
i "dragged out in the middle of the floor
and hot-handed" according to a recent
I announcement.
