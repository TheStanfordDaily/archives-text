# DIVIDEND OF $1 IS GIVEN BOARDERS IN ENCINA DINING HALL
## 
### 
A dividend of one dollar will be
given freshmen and club members
eating in the Encina dining halls by
action of the dining hall board of
control. The saving will take the form
of a reduction of board to $27 for the
month of February.
This action was taken when it was
learned that the Encina plant was
able to save $500 during January
above the cost of food and overhead
charges.
The plant charged $29 for board in
January and at the same rate the
board for February would be $28.13.
The dividend of the accumulated
surplus will be awarded by the reduc
tion of $1.13.
Board for February will be payable
at the office in Encina hall beginning
tomorrow. After February 5 an extra
ch;irge of 25 cents a day will be made
until the bill is paid.
Future Dividends May Be Divided
Further dividends may be divided
with the students in the future if a
surplus can be accumulated unless
the excess is put into better food. At
present the Board of Control has al
most complete charge of the eating
club service. The Board is composed
of twelve members who represent the
and Comptroller A. E. Roth are ad
visory members, but the Board has a
predominance of student members.
