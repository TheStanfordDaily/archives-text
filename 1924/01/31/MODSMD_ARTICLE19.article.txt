## Johnny and Stubby at Play 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Johnny Weissmuller, who has over half as many world's records as a
centipede has feet, and Stubby Kruger, who won more national championship
points in the last outdoor season than any one else, can do something else
besides swim like scared minnows. They have a comedy act that they put
on now and then between breaking records that goes over with a tremendous
splash.
The first part of the program consists in Johnny's offering to teach any one
who wants to learn, to dive. Stubby accepts, and steps forward out of his
bathrobe, clad in a swimming suit that is best described as an 1892 Sing Sing
model. Stubby's chest is adorned with medals, and on his face is a most
simple expression, quite belying the true character of the backstroke cham
pion. After the diving lesson, during which Kruger hits the water in the most
extraordinary ways, and has the crowd in convulsions by his contortions,
Johnny proposes a race.
They finally decide to swim across the pool the narrow way. After they hit
the water together. Stubby introduces his famous vertical stroke, and goes
slowly but surely on his simple way, seeming to sit erect in the water, like
a cork floating downstream. But what Kruger lacks in action, Johnny makes
up for, and he takes it upon himself to literally swim circles around his blonde
opponent, just making the touch ahead of his rival, after swimming possibly
ten times as far.
