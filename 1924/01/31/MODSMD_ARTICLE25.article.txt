# CAMPUS TRAVELS 187 MILES EACH DAY FOR MAIL; POSTOFFICE ATTENDANCE IS 1500
## 
### 
rjIHE Stanford catupus travels 187 miles for its mail every 24 hours, with the
* exception of Saturday and Sunday, according to a recent estimate. Round
trips to Uncle Sam's local chapter total 374 miles, a distance equal to the
mileage between Palo Alto and lleno, Nevada.
It is estimated that the average daily attendance at the Postoffice approxi
mates 1500 persons. Each person walks an average of thirty steps from the

time he places his foot on the first
step until he reaches the sidewalk on
the return. In other words, 45,000 steps
are taken daily in the building. Since
the average step is estimated at one
and one-half feet, the total distance
covered in the Postoffice in 24 hours
is in the neighborhood of 14 miles. The
value of shoe leather worn off runs
into several dollars.
The average weight for each person
entering the building is 125 pounds.
The weight supported by the floor in
24 hours registers 187,500 pounds, or
about 94 tons. This total does not in
clude the weight of the mail and par
cels.
Various estimates have been made
regarding the number of automobiles
which make short stopovers at this
point of interest each day, but the
majority of authorities agree that 200
cars is a reasonable number. The
amount of rubber deposited on the
pavement and the wear and tear on
brake bands along with the amount
of gasoline have not as yet been de
termined.
