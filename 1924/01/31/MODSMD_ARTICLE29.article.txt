# LIGHTWEIGHTS PLAY SAN MATEO TONIGHT
## 
### 
In the preliminary to the varsity-
Nevada game tonight, the Stanford
130 pound basketball plays the light
weight five from San Mateo high
school. Unless the Stanford 230's show
a speedier offense than they have dis
played in their games so far, they stand
to lose.
The San Mateo team is a strong con
tender for the championship of the
peninsula. In Roberts, McCue and
Shand they have a clever scoring com
i bination that will give the Stanford
guards plenty to do.
During this week's practice, the Card
13U's have improved. Coach "Tiny"
Thornhill will probably start Hobro
and Meyer at forward, Hogle at center,
and Blosser and Hugo at guard. To
night's game is the last before the Cali
fornia series.
