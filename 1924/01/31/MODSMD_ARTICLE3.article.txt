# CLOTHES HINDER WOMEN'S SUCCESS
## Ethel Leginska Believes Girls Waste Too Many Brains on Fancy Dress 
### 
"Women will never be truly great,
they will never succeed in their work
as men succeed, until they stop de
voting so much time and energy and
money to clothes.
Ethel Leginska, famous pianiste who
will play in the Assembly hall Monday
night, explained this in an interview
as one of the principles of her concert
success.
"What is clothing except something
to keep you warm and to keep you
covered?" she asked. Yet today it
doesn't, with many women, fulfill
either of these perfectly obvious func
tions. Men wear a costume which
amounts to a uniform. Why shouldn't
women?"
To the question, "What should be
the most important thing in a woman's
life work?" the pianiste answered: "If
she wished to be great, to succeed,
work must be the most important
thing to a woman. She must concen
trate on that and use everything else
as a means toward her work.
Women Have More Brains.
"That is what men do. That is why
men always have been greater than
women, who have better brains than
men, as well as the wonderful gift of
intuition. If to those gifts women
would only add the thoroughness, the
concentration, the selfishness of men,
1 believe that women would be greater,
would do finer work.
"So far, the opposite is true. Even
in my profession of playing I do not
think any women have done as well
as some men."
Leginska's appearance on the stage,
which is slightly darkened by her
orders, is always striking. An English
critic gives the following impressions:
"First, a mass of reddish brown
hair, bobbed and curled; then two
grey-blue eyes set in a pale face, that
light suddenly to the applause that
greets her entrance. A slight figure
that hurries on the platform, rather
strangely dressed in a close black vel
vet coat reaching somewhere halfway
between knee and ankle, with large
braided buttons set high on the waist
line, in at, the back and opening in
front to show a black silk skirt, and
severely plain white silk blouse, with
a turn-down collar. Her tiny hands
seem all the tinier for the white cuffs
encircling them.
"Then she sits down to play—usu
ally one of her own compositions—
with the feeling and sure touch which
have caused critics to compare her
with Paderewski."
