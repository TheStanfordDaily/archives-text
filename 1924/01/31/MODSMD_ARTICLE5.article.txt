# Delta Sigma Rho Violates Ruling Against Posters
## 
### 
The Delta Sigma Rho dance, sched
uled for February 2, may be can
celled due to a violation of the Execu
tive Committee ruling which states
that no posters shall appear on the
campus other than on the bulletin
boards provided for that purpose.
Posters announcing the dance were
posted broadcast over the campus, and
apparently no effort had been made to
restrict the publicity to the bulletin
boards as specified by the ruling.
It is suggested by a member of the
Executive Committee that organiza
tions pay closer attention to the regu
lations and avoid action by the stu
dent body committee in the future.
Action is left up to the Men's Coun
cil, and assurance was given today
that prompt punishment would be
given the organization.
As soon as they heard of the im
pending action, the debaters tore
down the posters and then appealed
to the authorities that no punishment
be given them.
