# NEWSPAPER SUCCESS WON By SPECIALISTS
## Opportunities in Journalism Are Best in Departments Says Fowler 
### 
"The valuable man is the one who is
doing all his own work and half of that
of the man above him," said W. H.
Begbie Fowler, '06, who began as an
office boy for the San Francisco Chron
icle and has risen to assistant publisher
and business manager, when he spoke
on opportunities in newspaper work
yesterday afternoon in the Little
Theater.
Speaks to Journalists.
"Editorial writers with good judg
ment and information are scarce while
advertising managers are usually copy
chasers," said Fowler in another ad
dress last evening to the American
Journalists' Association. The circula
tion manager must know the mind of
the public and the head of the mechan
ical department must know every tech
nical detailâ€žof his machinery in order
to turn out a good paper.
Originator of Auto Section.
Fowler, ex-editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, graduated from Stanford in 1906.
Before coming to Stanford, he worked
for the Chronicle as telegraph editor.
After graduating he returned to the
Chronicle business staff, and originated
the automobile section.
If money is considered the measure
of success Fowler believes that news
papers have about as much to offer
men of ability as other professions.
Salaries of city editors and specialty
writers compare favorably to those of
supreme court and federal judges. Be
ginners arc paid as well or better than
beginners in other professions.
"It is extremely desirable to special
ize in one field. News editors, Sunday
editors, financial editors, advertising
men, and sport writers are unbeliev
ably scarce. Such men are being taken
away continually by banks and corpor
ations to act as contact and publicity
agents.
Women as Journalists.
"The field for women is rather re
stricted, but they can succeed and are
greatly in demand, as art, music,
drama, and literature critics, and as li
brary and statistical experts." Mr.
Fowler advocated feature writing as the
field open to women. However, he said
that only two features have been good
enough to be syndicated, and both came
from San Francisco papers.
"Very few people can write sob-stuff
without making you want to weep for
another reason," declared Mr. Fowler.
Vast Opportunities.
Country papers offer just as good an
opportunity as city papers is the opin
ion of Mr. Fowler, and there is more
freedom for the executive in the smaller
scale work.
"Newspaper work is such that a man
can fit in and lie at home in any of
fice," said Fowler. "But he will not get
anywhere by shifting around. Raises
come quickest in the editorial depart
ment, but there and especially in the
business office, success is a matter of
sticking to the job and not expecting
a promotion too soon.
