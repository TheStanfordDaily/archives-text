# NIGHT FALLS ON IRELAND-VARSITY CONTEST; SCORE IS STILL 8 to 8
## Both Teams Slug Ball In Loosely Played Match; Lawson Cleans Bases With Three-Bagger 
### William Wright 
Darkness ended the second varsity-
Cliff Ireland baseball festival yester
day afternoon with the score tied at
8 to 8, after nine eventful innings of
slugging and thrills.
This leaves the Cards leading the j
series until February 23, when the 1
teams will bump for the last time,
this season.
Ditzler twirled his first game for
the varsity, and was nervous and a
trifle wild. The Independents collected
six hits and the same number of runs
during the five innings he occupied the |
box.
Teague, who succeeded him, held 1
the Irishmen scoreless, but Solomon |
was handicapped by the shades of
night and allowed the tying run in
the ninth frame.
The Irelands led off with three runs
in the opening tableau. Corrigan
walked, and took second on Clarke's i
bunt, lvoenig singled to right, scoring |
Corrigan and taking second on the :
throw-in. Tanner singled through i
short, scoring Koenig, and took a base !
on Stalker's infield out. Armstrong !
singled over Roberts' head, pushing J

Tanner across with the third tally.
The Cards came back and evened
things in their share of the same in
ning. "Shorty" Roberts cracked a hit
along the third base line, taking sec
ond on Cuddeback's base on balls.
Johnston fanned on a called strike,
but McCandless advanced the runners
with a hot liner to left field.
Jim Lawson stepped to the plate
and sponged the bags with a clean
triple beyond center field.
Score tied at three all, and Lawson
was stranded on third as the next two
men went down in order,
Errors, walks, and hits brought the
Irelands another brace in the second.
Ireland himself made the welkin ring
by planting a hit in short, outfield
over Cuddeback's position, and Wood
ward's error put him on second, with
Manauk safe on a fielder's choice. Cor
rigan's single filled the bases, and a
base on balls to Clarke forced Cliff —
proud and happy—across the pan.
Koenig's long sacrifice fly to Johnston
scored Manauk.
Cliff will be due for another hit
; about the time he gets into the 1924
World's ' Series, but he crossed the
j Cards prettily yesterday. It almost
ruined his performance in the field.
One run was all Wolters' team could
,do in the second. With two in the
tar, Roberts was safe on Clarke's mis
cue and immediately stole second.
Cuddeback scored him with a neat
single over second, but was caught
attempting to steal a moment later.
The score was tied again in the j
third, when McCandless drew first on !
a fielder's choice, scoring on an in- i
field out and Fuller's single.
Cliff's outfit again forged ahead ;
with two scores in the next two in- ' l
nings. Corrigan opened the fourth by j
walking, took third on Clarke's bingle
through second, and negotiated the i
home stretch on Tanner's sacrifice. !
Armstrong singled in the next frame, j
advanced on an infield out, took third
on a wild pitch, and scored on Wood
ward's error. A fast double play, Ditz
ler to Woodward, ended the inning.
Stanford gathered one more in the
fifth, bringing the count 7 to 6. Cudde
! back romped to third on an error,
I passed ball, and one more error, ring
j ing in at the plate on McCandless'
second blow of the day.
Reppy replaced Manauk, and again
stood treat to a Stanford lead, this
time in the eighth stanza. Clarke's j
error left Fuller on First, and Wood- 1
ward and Mulchay went out. "Lefty"
May, pinch-hitting for Teague, drew
a walk, and so did Roberts. With the j
bases full, Cuddeback drove a terrific j
grounder through first base, scoring
Fuller and May. Roberts was held at
third and Johnston walked, again
bulging the bags. McCandless was un
able to hit safely for the third time,
and the Cards were spotted to a one-!
run lead.
With darkness thick over the dia-|
mond, Roberts juggled Citron's ground
er to open the ninth. Kearns hit safely
through second, Armstrong flied out
to Roberts, and Anfinson hit through
third, scoring Citron. Kearns was on
third with the winning run and only
one out, but the hit-and-run play went
wrong. Keefe, batting for Ireland,!
| popped straight in the air to Solomon,
j who doubled Kearns off third and
called the game a tie.
Stanford was unable to see Reppy's i
; fast shoots through the twilight, and j
went down one-two-three.
Game called on account of darkness.

Darkness ended the second varsity-
Cliff Ireland baseball festival yester
day afternoon with the score tied at
8 to 8, after nine eventful innings of
slugging and thrills.
This leaves the Cards leading the j
series until February 23, when the 1
teams will bump for the last time,
this season.
Ditzler twirled his first game for
the varsity, and was nervous and a
trifle wild. The Independents collected
six hits and the same number of runs
during the five innings he occupied the |
box.
Teague, who succeeded him, held 1
the Irishmen scoreless, but Solomon |
was handicapped by the shades of
night and allowed the tying run in
the ninth frame.
The Irelands led off with three runs
in the opening tableau. Corrigan
walked, and took second on Clarke's i
bunt, lvoenig singled to right, scoring |
Corrigan and taking second on the :
throw-in. Tanner singled through i
short, scoring Koenig, and took a base !
on Stalker's infield out. Armstrong !
singled over Roberts' head, pushing J

Tanner across with the third tally.
The Cards came back and evened
things in their share of the same in
ning. "Shorty" Roberts cracked a hit
along the third base line, taking sec
ond on Cuddeback's base on balls.
Johnston fanned on a called strike,
but McCandless advanced the runners
with a hot liner to left field.
Jim Lawson stepped to the plate
and sponged the bags with a clean
triple beyond center field.
Score tied at three all, and Lawson
was stranded on third as the next two
men went down in order,
Errors, walks, and hits brought the
Irelands another brace in the second.
Ireland himself made the welkin ring
by planting a hit in short, outfield
over Cuddeback's position, and Wood
ward's error put him on second, with
Manauk safe on a fielder's choice. Cor
rigan's single filled the bases, and a
base on balls to Clarke forced Cliff —
proud and happy—across the pan.
Koenig's long sacrifice fly to Johnston
scored Manauk.
Cliff will be due for another hit
; about the time he gets into the 1924
World's ' Series, but he crossed the
j Cards prettily yesterday. It almost
ruined his performance in the field.
One run was all Wolters' team could
,do in the second. With two in the
tar, Roberts was safe on Clarke's mis
cue and immediately stole second.
Cuddeback scored him with a neat
single over second, but was caught
attempting to steal a moment later.
The score was tied again in the j
third, when McCandless drew first on !
a fielder's choice, scoring on an in- i
field out and Fuller's single.
Cliff's outfit again forged ahead ;
with two scores in the next two in- ' l
nings. Corrigan opened the fourth by j
walking, took third on Clarke's bingle
through second, and negotiated the i
home stretch on Tanner's sacrifice. !
Armstrong singled in the next frame, j
advanced on an infield out, took third
on a wild pitch, and scored on Wood
ward's error. A fast double play, Ditz
ler to Woodward, ended the inning.
Stanford gathered one more in the
fifth, bringing the count 7 to 6. Cudde
! back romped to third on an error,
I passed ball, and one more error, ring
j ing in at the plate on McCandless'
second blow of the day.

day afternoon with the score tied at
8 to 8, after nine eventful innings of
slugging and thrills.
This leaves the Cards leading the j
series until February 23, when the 1
teams will bump for the last time,
this season.
Ditzler twirled his first game for
the varsity, and was nervous and a
trifle wild. The Independents collected
six hits and the same number of runs
during the five innings he occupied the |
box.
Teague, who succeeded him, held 1
the Irishmen scoreless, but Solomon |
was handicapped by the shades of
night and allowed the tying run in
the ninth frame.
The Irelands led off with three runs
in the opening tableau. Corrigan
walked, and took second on Clarke's i
bunt, lvoenig singled to right, scoring |
Corrigan and taking second on the :
throw-in. Tanner singled through i
short, scoring Koenig, and took a base !
on Stalker's infield out. Armstrong !
singled over Roberts' head, pushing J

Tanner across with the third tally.
The Cards came back and evened
things in their share of the same in
ning. "Shorty" Roberts cracked a hit
along the third base line, taking sec
ond on Cuddeback's base on balls.
Johnston fanned on a called strike,
but McCandless advanced the runners
with a hot liner to left field.
Jim Lawson stepped to the plate
and sponged the bags with a clean
triple beyond center field.
Score tied at three all, and Lawson
was stranded on third as the next two
men went down in order,
Errors, walks, and hits brought the
Irelands another brace in the second.
Ireland himself made the welkin ring
by planting a hit in short, outfield
over Cuddeback's position, and Wood
ward's error put him on second, with
Manauk safe on a fielder's choice. Cor
rigan's single filled the bases, and a
base on balls to Clarke forced Cliff —
proud and happy—across the pan.
Koenig's long sacrifice fly to Johnston
scored Manauk.
Cliff will be due for another hit
; about the time he gets into the 1924
World's ' Series, but he crossed the
j Cards prettily yesterday. It almost
ruined his performance in the field.
One run was all Wolters' team could
,do in the second. With two in the
tar, Roberts was safe on Clarke's mis
cue and immediately stole second.
Cuddeback scored him with a neat
single over second, but was caught
attempting to steal a moment later.
The score was tied again in the j
third, when McCandless drew first on !
a fielder's choice, scoring on an in- i
field out and Fuller's single.
Cliff's outfit again forged ahead ;
with two scores in the next two in- ' l
nings. Corrigan opened the fourth by j
walking, took third on Clarke's bingle
through second, and negotiated the i
home stretch on Tanner's sacrifice. !
Armstrong singled in the next frame, j
advanced on an infield out, took third
on a wild pitch, and scored on Wood
ward's error. A fast double play, Ditz
ler to Woodward, ended the inning.
Stanford gathered one more in the
fifth, bringing the count 7 to 6. Cudde
! back romped to third on an error,
I passed ball, and one more error, ring
j ing in at the plate on McCandless'
second blow of the day.
Reppy replaced Manauk, and again
stood treat to a Stanford lead, this
time in the eighth stanza. Clarke's j
error left Fuller on First, and Wood- 1
ward and Mulchay went out. "Lefty"
May, pinch-hitting for Teague, drew
a walk, and so did Roberts. With the j
bases full, Cuddeback drove a terrific j
grounder through first base, scoring
Fuller and May. Roberts was held at
third and Johnston walked, again
bulging the bags. McCandless was un
able to hit safely for the third time,
and the Cards were spotted to a one-!
run lead.
With darkness thick over the dia-|
mond, Roberts juggled Citron's ground
er to open the ninth. Kearns hit safely
through second, Armstrong flied out
to Roberts, and Anfinson hit through
third, scoring Citron. Kearns was on
third with the winning run and only
one out, but the hit-and-run play went
wrong. Keefe, batting for Ireland,!
| popped straight in the air to Solomon,
j who doubled Kearns off third and
called the game a tie.
Stanford was unable to see Reppy's i
; fast shoots through the twilight, and j
went down one-two-three.
Game called on account of darkness.

error left Fuller on First, and Wood- 1
ward and Mulchay went out. "Lefty"
May, pinch-hitting for Teague, drew
a walk, and so did Roberts. With the j
bases full, Cuddeback drove a terrific j
grounder through first base, scoring
Fuller and May. Roberts was held at
third and Johnston walked, again
bulging the bags. McCandless was un
able to hit safely for the third time,

through second, Armstrong flied out

third, scoring Citron. Kearns was on
third with the winning run and only
one out, but the hit-and-run play went
wrong. Keefe, batting for Ireland,!
| popped straight in the air to Solomon,
j who doubled Kearns off third and
called the game a tie.
Stanford was unable to see Reppy's i
; fast shoots through the twilight, and j
went down one-two-three.
Game called on account of darkness.

Darkness ended the second varsity-
Cliff Ireland baseball festival yester
day afternoon with the score tied at
8 to 8, after nine eventful innings of
slugging and thrills.
This leaves the Cards leading the j
series until February 23, when the 1
teams will bump for the last time,
this season.
Ditzler twirled his first game for
the varsity, and was nervous and a
trifle wild. The Independents collected
six hits and the same number of runs
during the five innings he occupied the |
box.
Teague, who succeeded him, held 1
the Irishmen scoreless, but Solomon |
was handicapped by the shades of
night and allowed the tying run in
the ninth frame.
The Irelands led off with three runs
in the opening tableau. Corrigan
walked, and took second on Clarke's i
bunt, lvoenig singled to right, scoring |
Corrigan and taking second on the :
throw-in. Tanner singled through i
short, scoring Koenig, and took a base !
on Stalker's infield out. Armstrong !
singled over Roberts' head, pushing J

Tanner across with the third tally.
The Cards came back and evened
things in their share of the same in
ning. "Shorty" Roberts cracked a hit
along the third base line, taking sec
ond on Cuddeback's base on balls.
Johnston fanned on a called strike,
but McCandless advanced the runners
with a hot liner to left field.
Jim Lawson stepped to the plate
and sponged the bags with a clean
triple beyond center field.
Score tied at three all, and Lawson
was stranded on third as the next two
men went down in order,
Errors, walks, and hits brought the
Irelands another brace in the second.
Ireland himself made the welkin ring
by planting a hit in short, outfield
over Cuddeback's position, and Wood
ward's error put him on second, with
Manauk safe on a fielder's choice. Cor
rigan's single filled the bases, and a
base on balls to Clarke forced Cliff —
proud and happy—across the pan.
Koenig's long sacrifice fly to Johnston
scored Manauk.
Cliff will be due for another hit
; about the time he gets into the 1924
World's ' Series, but he crossed the
j Cards prettily yesterday. It almost
ruined his performance in the field.
One run was all Wolters' team could
,do in the second. With two in the
tar, Roberts was safe on Clarke's mis
cue and immediately stole second.
Cuddeback scored him with a neat
single over second, but was caught
attempting to steal a moment later.
The score was tied again in the j
third, when McCandless drew first on !
a fielder's choice, scoring on an in- i
field out and Fuller's single.
Cliff's outfit again forged ahead ;
with two scores in the next two in- ' l
nings. Corrigan opened the fourth by j
walking, took third on Clarke's bingle
through second, and negotiated the i
home stretch on Tanner's sacrifice. !
Armstrong singled in the next frame, j
advanced on an infield out, took third
on a wild pitch, and scored on Wood
ward's error. A fast double play, Ditz
ler to Woodward, ended the inning.
Stanford gathered one more in the
fifth, bringing the count 7 to 6. Cudde
! back romped to third on an error,
I passed ball, and one more error, ring
j ing in at the plate on McCandless'
second blow of the day.
Reppy replaced Manauk, and again
stood treat to a Stanford lead, this
time in the eighth stanza. Clarke's j
error left Fuller on First, and Wood- 1
ward and Mulchay went out. "Lefty"
May, pinch-hitting for Teague, drew
a walk, and so did Roberts. With the j
bases full, Cuddeback drove a terrific j
grounder through first base, scoring
Fuller and May. Roberts was held at
third and Johnston walked, again
