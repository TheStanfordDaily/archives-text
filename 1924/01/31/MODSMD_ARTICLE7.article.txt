# NIGHT FALLS ON IRELAND-VARSITY CONTEST; SCORE IS STILL 8 to 8
## Both Teams Slug Ball In Loosely Played Match; Lawson Cleans Bases With Three-Bagger 
### William Wright 
Darkness ended the second varsity-
Cliff Ireland baseball festival yester
day afternoon with the score tied at
8 to 8, after nine eventful innings of
slugging and thrills.
This leaves the Cards leading the j
series until February 23, when the 1
teams will bump for the last time,
this season.
Ditzler twirled his first game for
the varsity, and was nervous and a
trifle wild. The Independents collected
six hits and the same number of runs
during the five innings he occupied the |
box.
Teague, who succeeded him, held 1
the Irishmen scoreless, but Solomon |
was handicapped by the shades of
night and allowed the tying run in
the ninth frame.
The Irelands led off with three runs
in the opening tableau. Corrigan
walked, and took second on Clarke's i
bunt, lvoenig singled to right, scoring |
Corrigan and taking second on the :
throw-in. Tanner singled through i
short, scoring Koenig, and took a base !
on Stalker's infield out. Armstrong !
singled over Roberts' head, pushing J

Tanner across with the third tally.
The Cards came back and evened
things in their share of the same in
ning. "Shorty" Roberts cracked a hit
along the third base line, taking sec
ond on Cuddeback's base on balls.
Johnston fanned on a called strike,
but McCandless advanced the runners
with a hot liner to left field.
Jim Lawson stepped to the plate
and sponged the bags with a clean
triple beyond center field.
Score tied at three all, and Lawson
was stranded on third as the next two
men went down in order,
Errors, walks, and hits brought the
Irelands another brace in the second.
Ireland himself made the welkin ring
by planting a hit in short, outfield
over Cuddeback's position, and Wood
ward's error put him on second, with
Manauk safe on a fielder's choice. Cor
rigan's single filled the bases, and a
base on balls to Clarke forced Cliff —
proud and happy—across the pan.
Koenig's long sacrifice fly to Johnston
scored Manauk.
Cliff will be due for another hit
