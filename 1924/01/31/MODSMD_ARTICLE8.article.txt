# ENGLAND OF 1860 IS SEEN IN 'MILESTONES'
## Three Generations Of Costumes Brought Out In Rehearsal Of Cast Last Night 
### 
fFHE swish and rustle of hoop skirts, the mincing steps of a crinoline heroine
of the '60's, the shine of pearl buttons on fancy waistcoats —and the ghosts
of another day stepped forth on the Assembly hall stage.
The first dress rehearsal for "Milestones," held last night, was as much a
surprise to the actors as to the viewers. Nervous as a cat with boots on in
the frills and finery of a generation long dead, the cast went through its play
with surprising smoothness, especially for an initial dress rehearsal.
Of course, now and then, a property man wandered onto the set without
waiting for his cue, but that's to be expected.
Marjorie Allen and Aileene Burks, remembered as cabin-boy and senorita
in "Captain Applejack," are seen in the first act in hoop skirts, and later on

as old ladies —difficult parts handled well.
A "make-up" rehearsal is scheduled tonight as final prologue to the pre- '
sentation tomorrow.
Don't Argue With an Englishman
An argument of stupendously ludicrous proportions is started in the second j
act between Dorothy Dahler, as one half of a rather obviously happily married

couple, and Charles Parks, who is one \
of those almost unheard-of persons—
an English lord with a magnavox
voice.
The hustling '80's form the back- j
ground of the second act. Bustles, leg
of-rautton sleeves, dainty Victorian i
hats, all dug out of mothballs and
attic trunks by women in Palo Alto,!
are seen in a setting of what-nots and ,
red plush furniture.

hygienic. Thornton is appearing for
the first time, and carries a rather
difficult comedy part with the ease
of a dramatic hold-over.
Edythe Baylis, says Gordon Davis,
is a real trouper; she stepped into a
leading part last week when Helen
L/ewis became ill. and is now so per
fect in her role no one would suspect
that she had not been understudying
the part since rehearsals started.
All costumes are arranged in har
monious colors to match the settings,
and were designed under the direction
of Chrysella Dunker.
Delmer Daves, when interviewed at
noon today in the basement of the
Geology building, anounced that there
was a good sale of tickets but at last
account a few good seats were left
on sale in the office of the Alumni
Secretary. This has been verified.

the first time, and carries a rather
difficult comedy part with the ease
of a dramatic hold-over.
Edythe Baylis, says Gordon Davis,
is a real trouper; she stepped into a
leading part last week when Helen
L/ewis became ill. and is now so per
fect in her role no one would suspect
that she had not been understudying
the part since rehearsals started.
All costumes are arranged in har
monious colors to match the settings,
and were designed under the direction
of Chrysella Dunker.
Delmer Daves, when interviewed at

waiting for his cue, but that's to be expected.
Marjorie Allen and Aileene Burks, remembered as cabin-boy and senorita
in "Captain Applejack," are seen in the first act in hoop skirts, and later on

as old ladies —difficult parts handled well.
A "make-up" rehearsal is scheduled tonight as final prologue to the pre- '

An argument of stupendously ludicrous proportions is started in the second j
act between Dorothy Dahler, as one half of a rather obviously happily married

couple, and Charles Parks, who is one \
of those almost unheard-of persons—
an English lord with a magnavox
voice.
The hustling '80's form the back- j
