# ENGLAND OF 1860 IS SEEN IN 'MILESTONES'
## Three Generations Of Costumes Brought Out In Rehearsal Of Cast Last Night 
### 
fFHE swish and rustle of hoop skirts, the mincing steps of a crinoline heroine
of the '60's, the shine of pearl buttons on fancy waistcoats —and the ghosts
of another day stepped forth on the Assembly hall stage.
The first dress rehearsal for "Milestones," held last night, was as much a
surprise to the actors as to the viewers. Nervous as a cat with boots on in
the frills and finery of a generation long dead, the cast went through its play
with surprising smoothness, especially for an initial dress rehearsal.
Of course, now and then, a property man wandered onto the set without
waiting for his cue, but that's to be expected.
Marjorie Allen and Aileene Burks, remembered as cabin-boy and senorita
in "Captain Applejack," are seen in the first act in hoop skirts, and later on

as old ladies —difficult parts handled well.
A "make-up" rehearsal is scheduled tonight as final prologue to the pre- '
sentation tomorrow.
Don't Argue With an Englishman
An argument of stupendously ludicrous proportions is started in the second j
act between Dorothy Dahler, as one half of a rather obviously happily married

couple, and Charles Parks, who is one \
of those almost unheard-of persons—
an English lord with a magnavox
voice.
The hustling '80's form the back- j
ground of the second act. Bustles, leg
of-rautton sleeves, dainty Victorian i
hats, all dug out of mothballs and
attic trunks by women in Palo Alto,!
are seen in a setting of what-nots and ,
red plush furniture.
Dramatic "Find" Discovered
A dramatic find is brought to the!
spotlight in this act in William Thorn- 1
ton, who takes the part of an old man
insistent that pneumatic tires for
baby carriages are fundamentally 1111-


One reason why the halls of Old England were spacious—the hoopskirts of
Aileene Burks and Marjorie Allen. Cecil Morris
wears tight trousers for contrast.
