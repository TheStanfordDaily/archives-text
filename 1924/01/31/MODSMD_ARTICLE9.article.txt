# LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHTS LOSE TO PALO ALTO
## 145-Pound Basketball Team Defeated 25 to 18 in Ragged Game With High School 
### 
Palo Alto high school's unlimited
basketball team defeated Stanford's
145's last night 25 to 18, because the
light-heavvweights did most of their
playing under the opposition basket,
seldom getting a man free in position
to try a shot, and passed the ball
around to nobody in particular.
Cornell and Neer played way under
form, scoring only two field goals
apiece. Ossmanson, Palo Alto forward,
scored six field goals, and his team
mate, Ames, scored three. The Stan
ford forwards dribbled the ball around
the center of the floor instead of
breaking in for the basket, giving the
Palo Alto defense a chance to bunch.
The 145's had the jump at center,
hut the advantage didn't mean any
thing. A Palo Alto man invariably got
; the ball, and sent it in quick, short
passes to the basket.
Palo Alto Defense Clever
Lund, Stanford guard, played a hard
game, but was sucked out of the bas
ket several times, paving the way for
j a Palo Alto score. His passes were
long and inaccurate.
Stewart's game at center was slow.
He failed to go in for the basket after
passing the ball. Smith went in for
! Neer in" the second quarter, and for
Cornell in the last. He is the best shot
on the squad.
The score at half time was 8 to 8.
In the last period, the Palo Alto five
ran wild and piled up a big lead.
The 145's missed eight fouls, enough
to win the game.
