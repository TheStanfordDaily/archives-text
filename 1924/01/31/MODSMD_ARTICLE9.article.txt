# LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHTS LOSE TO PALO ALTO
## 145-Pound Basketball Team Defeated 25 to 18 in Ragged Game With High School 
### 
Palo Alto high school's unlimited
basketball team defeated Stanford's
145's last night 25 to 18, because the
light-heavvweights did most of their
playing under the opposition basket,
seldom getting a man free in position
to try a shot, and passed the ball
around to nobody in particular.
Cornell and Neer played way under
form, scoring only two field goals
apiece. Ossmanson, Palo Alto forward,
scored six field goals, and his team
mate, Ames, scored three. The Stan
ford forwards dribbled the ball around
the center of the floor instead of
breaking in for the basket, giving the
Palo Alto defense a chance to bunch.
