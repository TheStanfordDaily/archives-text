1 SPRING TOP COATS
There's a jauntiness in the top coat that
wins favor from men and young men.
Warmth without weight —just the coat
for Spring! These new Roos coats are
made of soft, fleecy domestic and im
ported woolens that don't need pressing
every time you sit down. All popular
styles and in most all colors —tan, taupe,
light and dark gray, and in the new
greenish tints. Some are cravanetted —
all carry the Roos unconditional guaran
tee of satisfaction.
