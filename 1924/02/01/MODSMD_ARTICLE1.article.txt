# DA VIS EXPECTS "MILESTONES" CAST TO REACH NEW LEVEL OF AMATEUR SMOOTHNESS TONIGHT
## Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks, and Cecil Morris Carry Difficult Roles Through Three Ages 
### 
CAMPUS interest in "Milestones" hinges on the individual work ot' Aileene
Burks and Marjorie Allen, who indicated considerable promise in "Captain
Applejack," and in the results of Gordon Davis' attempt to "whittle" away
for once all detracting marks of amateurishness.
The curtain will part tonight at 8:20.
In what is without doubt the most difficult portrayal in the production,
Aileene Burks smores a personal triumph. Never at any time does her part
| rise from its sombre level, and to prevent a single note of monotony from

entering into the interpretation, requires professional dramatic skill.
Marjorie Allen Appealing
Marjorie Allen, in the role of Rose Sibley, makes the most of her appealing
femininity and musical voice, and proves equally charming in each of the
three ages.
There is a peculiar fascination in watching the development of the charac
ters of these two, as the play unfolds itself. Rose Sibley, who through the
death of her father is permitted to marry the man of her desire, only to have
— -<£her every wish dominated by those

of her husband, still lives a contented,
happy life.
Parts Are Contrasted
In direct contrast, is the part played
* by Miss Burks. Disappointed in her
plans to marry the sweetheart of her
youth, she allows her bitterness to
1 tear down all the happiness which she
1 might have enjoyed. Her efforts to
e save her niece from the scheming de
si'-es of her parents, form one of the
1 big moments of the play.
Morris Does Clever Work
j Cecil Morris, as the leading male
" character, puts over one of the most


"The way they did it in '85." Four characters in "Milestones," from left
to right: Edythe Baylis, Aileene Burks, Charles Parks, and Marjorie Allen.
difficult roles of the play. From the
headstrong young man of the first act
who temporarily gives up his fiance
for his convictions, to the stern ruler
of his family, the man whose word is
law, in the second act, his portrayal
| is magnificent. And in the last act, as
the old * but stern grandfather, he
makes a perfect teammate for the win
some Marjorie Allen.
William Thornton, as the juvenile,
! should prove a hit. He plays the part
i of Sam Sibley, a conservative young
man who thinks the world is going to
| the dogs. As the irritable old husband
i of Dorothy Dahler in tlve second act,
however, he reaches his greatest
I heights.
Edythe Baylis Shows Talent
Edythe Baylis had to learn to play
1 the second act ingenue and the third
, act mother in the space of one week.
Her previous experience and natural
talent, however, were enough to in
sure the able portrayal of a leading
i character.
One of the most impressive features
of tonight's performance will be in
: the make-ups of the different charac
j ters. The portrayal of three distinct
ages requires many changes in both
grease paint and dress. "Ed" Mills in
1 "Milestones" has surpassed any of his
previous work in altering youthful
' campus actors so that they look like
perfect picture out of an old family
i album.
