# DA VIS EXPECTS "MILESTONES" CAST TO REACH NEW LEVEL OF AMATEUR SMOOTHNESS TONIGHT
## Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks, and Cecil Morris Carry Difficult Roles Through Three Ages 
### 
CAMPUS interest in "Milestones" hinges on the individual work ot' Aileene
Burks and Marjorie Allen, who indicated considerable promise in "Captain
Applejack," and in the results of Gordon Davis' attempt to "whittle" away
for once all detracting marks of amateurishness.
The curtain will part tonight at 8:20.
In what is without doubt the most difficult portrayal in the production,
Aileene Burks smores a personal triumph. Never at any time does her part
| rise from its sombre level, and to prevent a single note of monotony from

entering into the interpretation, requires professional dramatic skill.
Marjorie Allen Appealing
Marjorie Allen, in the role of Rose Sibley, makes the most of her appealing
femininity and musical voice, and proves equally charming in each of the
three ages.
There is a peculiar fascination in watching the development of the charac
ters of these two, as the play unfolds itself. Rose Sibley, who through the
death of her father is permitted to marry the man of her desire, only to have
— -<£her every wish dominated by those

of her husband, still lives a contented,
happy life.
Parts Are Contrasted
In direct contrast, is the part played
* by Miss Burks. Disappointed in her
plans to marry the sweetheart of her
youth, she allows her bitterness to
1 tear down all the happiness which she
1 might have enjoyed. Her efforts to
e save her niece from the scheming de
si'-es of her parents, form one of the
1 big moments of the play.
Morris Does Clever Work
j Cecil Morris, as the leading male
" character, puts over one of the most


"The way they did it in '85." Four characters in "Milestones," from left
to right: Edythe Baylis, Aileene Burks, Charles Parks, and Marjorie Allen.
