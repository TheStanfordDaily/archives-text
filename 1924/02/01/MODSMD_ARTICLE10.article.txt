# VARSITY MIXES WITH WINGED "O" ON DIAMOND
## Olympic Club Line-up Not Yet Announced; Loewenstein May Start in Box 
### 
The Cardinal nine will go to bat
against the Olympic Club tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 with the expecta- 1
tion of a much harder game than those
played against Cliff Ireland's Inde
pendents the last week. The contest
will be played on the varsity diamond, >
i Although 110 roster of Winged "O"
players has filtered down to the
"Farm," the club has a reputation for
putting out strong diamond combina-'
tions, and the Cards won the early
season game from them last year by
a ninth-inning rally which netted three
runs, with the assistance of a general
blow-up of the Olympic infield.
If the club brings the same line-up
that represented it in the final game I
of the series last May, Harry Wolter's
team will be up against a real propo
sition. This nine included "Lefty"
Herrnle, captain of the 1923 California
varsity, and other California stars.
A1 Loewenstein is the only twirler,
who has not yet had his chance on the
mound, and Wolter will likely select '
him to slow-ball the visitors. The cen
ter field position will be occupied by
"Bill" Trace, the only new man on the
so-called first team, or by Frank
Fuller.
"Jim" Lawsort will be back of the
log. as usual, with "Bud" Woodward
holding down the first sack. The 1925
freshman combination of Roberts and
j Mulchay is working beautifully around
second, and it is hard to see how this
combination will be disturbed through
out the season, unless an injury forces
one of the men out of the line-up.
Murray Cuddeback has taken to his
old job at the hot corner like the
veteran, he is. The outside gardens j
are handled by "Chuck" Johnston and
"Bus" McCandless, both of whom have
a faculty for beating the ball to all
corners of the lot.
