# JANITRESS TELLS STORIES
## Making Beds In Dormitories and Sweeping Anatomy Building Held Undesirable 
### Ray Spangler 
Mrs. G. A. Olive is Stanford's head
janitor, or rather janitress. She has
been here for three years, in the em
ploy of the American Building Main
tenance Company, which holds a con
tract for Stanford's janiting.
"Janitor work will be recognized
some time as important," says Mrs.
Olive. "Inexperienced help may cost
the institution a great deal. Men are
usually ashamed of the work, and are
'down and out' before they will take a
janitor's job. As a result, a low type
is intrusted with the keys to buildings.

Deterioration may go on unsuspected.
Bed-Making Difficult
"The most difficult jobs we have
are making beds in dormitories and
keeping janitors to sweep the Ana
tomy building. Janitors are often very
superstitious. In the Anatomy build
ing, there are from lfi to 18 'speci
mens' on operating tables, covered
with oil cloths. The job of cleaning
these rooms is often unpleasant. The
odor of the preservatives and the fact
that there are dead men in the room
make it a most undesirable job.
"I remember one time when we sent
a man over there one nigbt to sweep
the laboratory. As he opened the door,
a heavy draught moved the oil cloth
over one of the corpses. The poor man
saw the thing move, and he thought
the 'corpse* alive. He started running, j

and 1 haven't seen him since. He had [
three days pay coming too.
Anatomy Job "Spooky"
"I always tell the men that the i
specimens aren't dead; they're only"]
pickled. But we have to keep two
men on the job. It's too spooky for
one man alone at night.
"We have many funny experiences
with our help. After the U. S. C. game

last Saturday, the janitor carefully
swept up all the peanut shells in a
pile, and shoved them under the
bleachers. When I found them, I told
him to put them in a box. I came
back and found him putting them
one by one through a small opening
in the top. He'd have been packing
peanut shells away until Christmas
if I hadn't caught him."

Bed-Making Difficult
"The most difficult jobs we have
are making beds in dormitories and
keeping janitors to sweep the Ana

superstitious. In the Anatomy build

these rooms is often unpleasant. The

men on the job. It's too spooky for
one man alone at night.
"We have many funny experiences

last Saturday, the janitor carefully

bleachers. When I found them, I told
him to put them in a box. I came
back and found him putting them
one by one through a small opening
in the top. He'd have been packing
peanut shells away until Christmas
if I hadn't caught him."
