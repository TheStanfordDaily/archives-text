# BERKELEY TO TANGLE WITH BABE FIVE
## 
### Wallace Knox 
After eight straight victories, the
Stanford freshman five is preparing to
down the Berkeley high school team
tomorrow in the pavilion, in a prelim
inary to the varsity-Nevada game.
Berkeley is expected to have the
strongest team the babes have met so
far this year. The high school boys
defeated the University of California
freshmen recently, 21 to 20.
Game Offers Comparison.
The result of the game with Berkeley
will give Coach "Husky" Hunt his first
opportunity to get a line on the com
parative strength of the Cardinal and
Bear freshman teams. The other
Stanford games have been with teams
which liave not played the. Bruin first
year men, and hence no deductions can
be made from them other than the fact
that the frosh have a good team this
year.
The 1926 aggregation managed to
nose out the Berkeley five in a close
game last year. The 1927 five is much
stronger than the team last year, and
if Berkeley is still about the same the
freshmen should chalk up a victory.
The line-up tomorrow will be Price
and David, forwards; Jayred. center;
and Shipkey and Newhouse, guards.
Three Games Next Week.
It is probable that three games will
be played next week. The Livermore
and Piedmont high teams are already
scheduled for Wednesday and Satur
day, respectively, and another game
may .be secured with Willits high for
next Friday.
These games will give the freshmen
plenty of practice before they meet the
California freshmen at Berkeley, -Feb
ruary 13. as a preliminary to the first
varsity-California contest. If the
games with Willits and Livermore are
arranged for two consecutive nights, it
is likely that Hunt will not use the
regulars in both games.
Eighteen men played against San
Jose high Wednesday. The last five
to get in managed to play on a par with
the San Jose team. As San Jose de
feated the freshmen last year, the suc
cess of the third team speaks well for
the babes.
Price, David Good Forwards.
Price and David are working well
together at the forward positions.
Both of them are exceptionally accur
ate shots, and will be good varsity ma
terial for next year. David a nia ~
jority of his long shots when he has
time to aim, which is better than most
forwards can do.
Ted Shipkey seems to have found
his eye for the hoop. He got two
baskets in the game Wednesday. If he
can keep this up, it will add to the
babes' chances in any close games. In
the early part of the season all of the
scoring was done by the forwards and
center, but Shipkey may become a
regular point maker.
The frosh have been playing clean
ball. Fouls arc few, only seven were
called on them in the game against
San Jose, which is more than the}' us
ually make.

far this year. The high school boys
defeated the University of California
freshmen recently, 21 to 20.
Game Offers Comparison.
The result of the game with Berkeley
will give Coach "Husky" Hunt his first
opportunity to get a line on the com
parative strength of the Cardinal and
Bear freshman teams. The other
Stanford games have been with teams
which liave not played the. Bruin first
year men, and hence no deductions can
be made from them other than the fact
that the frosh have a good team this
year.
The 1926 aggregation managed to
nose out the Berkeley five in a close
game last year. The 1927 five is much
stronger than the team last year, and
if Berkeley is still about the same the
freshmen should chalk up a victory.
The line-up tomorrow will be Price
and David, forwards; Jayred. center;
and Shipkey and Newhouse, guards.
Three Games Next Week.
It is probable that three games will
be played next week. The Livermore
and Piedmont high teams are already
scheduled for Wednesday and Satur
day, respectively, and another game
may .be secured with Willits high for
next Friday.
These games will give the freshmen
plenty of practice before they meet the
California freshmen at Berkeley, -Feb
ruary 13. as a preliminary to the first
varsity-California contest. If the
games with Willits and Livermore are
arranged for two consecutive nights, it
is likely that Hunt will not use the
regulars in both games.
Eighteen men played against San
Jose high Wednesday. The last five
to get in managed to play on a par with
the San Jose team. As San Jose de
feated the freshmen last year, the suc
cess of the third team speaks well for
the babes.
Price, David Good Forwards.
Price and David are working well
together at the forward positions.
Both of them are exceptionally accur
ate shots, and will be good varsity ma
terial for next year. David a nia ~
jority of his long shots when he has
time to aim, which is better than most
forwards can do.
Ted Shipkey seems to have found
his eye for the hoop. He got two
baskets in the game Wednesday. If he
can keep this up, it will add to the
babes' chances in any close games. In
the early part of the season all of the
scoring was done by the forwards and
center, but Shipkey may become a
regular point maker.
The frosh have been playing clean
ball. Fouls arc few, only seven were
called on them in the game against
San Jose, which is more than the}' us
ually make.
After eight straight victories, the
Stanford freshman five is preparing to
down the Berkeley high school team
tomorrow in the pavilion, in a prelim
inary to the varsity-Nevada game.
Berkeley is expected to have the
strongest team the babes have met so
far this year. The high school boys
defeated the University of California
freshmen recently, 21 to 20.
