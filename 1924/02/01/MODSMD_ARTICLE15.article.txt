# LIBRARY TO SECURE ENTIRE WORKS OF VAN WYCK BROOKS
## 
### Beatrice Flesher 
The complete set of the works of
Van Wyck Brooks, instructor in Eng
lish at Stanford from 1911 to 1913, and
a member of Dr. Gray's Round Table
group, has been ordered for the Li
brary, which already contains his
"America's Coming of Age." "John
Addington Symonds," and his greatly
discussed "Ordeal of Mark Twain."
Brooks is a Harvard graduate, and
has published many books of criticism.
His first, "The Wine of the Puritans,"
published in 1909, is an attempt to
show the effect of the Puritans on
American civilization. It was at Stan
ford that he began to write his first
creative works, after his connection
with the Round Table group.
Creative Work Began Here
One of his early books was "The
Soul," in which he delved into the
highest matters and questions. Brooks
realized his youth, however, and his
inability to write comprehensively on
any such subjects, and so the book
was only privately printed.
In 1914, Brooks published "John Ad
dington Symonds," a scholarly thor
ough-going biographical study. The
next year, his "World of H. G. Wells,"
in which he analyzed with critical
insight, the whole of Wells' works, ap
peared. His "Coming of Age," pub
lished the same year, is an original,
daring analysis of American lierature,
in which the author tended to detract
from the established figures of Ameri
can literature, in order to show the
relatively high value of less well
known writers than the New England
group whose limitations he tried to
reveal.
Foremost Critical Writer
"The Ordeal of Mark Twain," ap
pearing in 1919, brought forth great
comment, and, according to Dr. Henry
David Gray, "definitely placed him in
the front rank of critics." Dr. Jordan
also expressed his appreciation of the
book in the highest terms. Few have
accepted the hypothesis offered by
Brooks, and several reviews following
its publication misunderstood his
viewpoint.
One of Brooks' latest books Is "The
Analysis of Henry James."
Brooks has been one of the asso
ciate editors of the Freeman since
1920, and has been in the habit of
taking a year off to come to Carmel
periodically where he usually spends
his timo writing a book.
Belongs to New School
Brooks is a member of the new
school of writers, certain members of
which, like H. L. Mencken, have
opened it to criticism. The charges
of flippancy and ultra-moderness
against Brooks, however, cannot be
substantiated by careful examination

of his works. For all his brilliancy
and dash, and lack of thorough founda
tion in scholarship, he has read wide*
ly, and has thought independently.

ough-going biographical study. The
next year, his "World of H. G. Wells,"
in which he analyzed with critical
insight, the whole of Wells' works, ap
peared. His "Coming of Age," pub
lished the same year, is an original,
daring analysis of American lierature,
in which the author tended to detract
from the established figures of Ameri
can literature, in order to show the
relatively high value of less well
known writers than the New England
group whose limitations he tried to
reveal.
Foremost Critical Writer
"The Ordeal of Mark Twain," ap
pearing in 1919, brought forth great
comment, and, according to Dr. Henry
David Gray, "definitely placed him in
the front rank of critics." Dr. Jordan
also expressed his appreciation of the
book in the highest terms. Few have
accepted the hypothesis offered by
Brooks, and several reviews following
its publication misunderstood his
viewpoint.
One of Brooks' latest books Is "The
Analysis of Henry James."
Brooks has been one of the asso
ciate editors of the Freeman since
1920, and has been in the habit of
taking a year off to come to Carmel
periodically where he usually spends
his timo writing a book.
Belongs to New School
Brooks is a member of the new
school of writers, certain members of
which, like H. L. Mencken, have
opened it to criticism. The charges
of flippancy and ultra-moderness
against Brooks, however, cannot be
substantiated by careful examination

of his works. For all his brilliancy
and dash, and lack of thorough founda
tion in scholarship, he has read wide*
ly, and has thought independently.
The complete set of the works of
Van Wyck Brooks, instructor in Eng
lish at Stanford from 1911 to 1913, and
a member of Dr. Gray's Round Table
group, has been ordered for the Li
brary, which already contains his
"America's Coming of Age." "John
Addington Symonds," and his greatly
discussed "Ordeal of Mark Twain."
Brooks is a Harvard graduate, and
has published many books of criticism.
His first, "The Wine of the Puritans,"
published in 1909, is an attempt to
show the effect of the Puritans on
American civilization. It was at Stan
ford that he began to write his first
creative works, after his connection
with the Round Table group.
Creative Work Began Here
One of his early books was "The
Soul," in which he delved into the
highest matters and questions. Brooks
realized his youth, however, and his
inability to write comprehensively on
any such subjects, and so the book
was only privately printed.
In 1914, Brooks published "John Ad
dington Symonds," a scholarly thor
ough-going biographical study. The
next year, his "World of H. G. Wells,"
in which he analyzed with critical
insight, the whole of Wells' works, ap
peared. His "Coming of Age," pub
