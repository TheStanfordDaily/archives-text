# WHEN NOT TO BRAG
## 
### 
A student was describing the basketball game last night to one who
could not go. And sa-a-v, said he, "we played that game with our
second team. Nevada didn't have a thing."
llow many other people have since then received the impression from
this student that Andy Kerr's substitutes defeated Nevada with a fifteen
point margin ? As many, probably, as he is able to make listen to him.
The statement of this enthusiast, known technically as "popping off,"
will have the following effect on those who believed it: they will go to the
game Saturday expecting to see substitutes as good as the first varsity
(which they could hardly be, seeing that they are substitutes), will find
out that the subs are only second-string men of secondary caliber, and will
go away from the game crabbing al>out the team being in a slump.
If such men would confine their braggart's habits to something safe
like the number of squares in the Quad walks, there would be less false en
thusiasm and more real knowledge on matters of student interest.
