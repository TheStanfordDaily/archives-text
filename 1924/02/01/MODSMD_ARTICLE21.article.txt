valuable document with all the intentness accorded an examination list.

that, and in about twenty minutes turned the page.
On the inside of the sporting section he read carefully everything said
by Barney (Joogle, Jack Keefe, and the rest. Pie spent another half hour
on the inside. The front page of the paper, full of news which was af
fecting the whole nation, lay before him unopened. lie turned to the back
page and spent another ten minutes on the comics.
Then he departed for his classes, his mind full of a conglomeration of
stale sport news and stale jokes.
