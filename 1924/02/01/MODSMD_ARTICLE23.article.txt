No. 2—Alonzo Steps Out
Alonzo* has a date. It's not unusual at all for some boys to have dates.
But you don't know Alonzo. It's unusual for Alonzo to have anything. When
he has anything you can be sure he picked it up some place. That's how he
got the date.
You wouldn't have to be told that if
if you saw the girl.
Alonzo found his girl in the libe. You
find lots of things in the libe. After he
found her he didn't know just what to
do with her. He wanted to hide her.
I don't blame him.
She was a Phi Bet. They say opposites
attract. That's probably the reason h liked
her. Alonzo's not dumb. He's just tired.
As has been said, Alonzo wanted to hide
her. So he took her to the postoffice. No one
would see a girl there. No one looks for any
thing but mail in the postoffice.
After that he took her for a walk. Not that he
was cheap. He wanted to talk to her. They walked
over by the cactus garden. She really wanted to talk.
They walked back from the cactus garden.
Alonzo has a hard time finding a girl, usually.
His trouble this time was that he couldn't lose this
one.
Alonzo had thought at first that he had picked up
a honey. She WAS rather sweet, but also sitcky.
He didn't have a chance to lose her. Then she got hungry.
If there is antvhing that Alonzo hates, it's a hungry girl.
Alonzo had a bright idea. He told her to wait and he'd go
to his room and get some cookies. He didn't get cookies.
He got sleepy. He didn't ditch the girl. He just forgot her.
It wasn't hard. Alonzo went to bed.
The next morning Alonzo rose to go to his eight o'clock.
Sitting in front of his dwelling place was the girl. She smiled.
"Alonzo dear, did you bring me the cookies?" B. A.
