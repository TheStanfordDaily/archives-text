# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Phooey! Look what the Editor has
gotten himself in for by calling attention
to a breech of rules! Also for remarking
in a news story that the fracture would
probably be punished.
The following viewpoint is published
not because it adds anything new to the
situation, but in order to correct any
impression thai the story published in the
Daily yesterday was NOT news. Assur
ance was given, as was said before, by a
member of the Mens Council, that the
violation would be punished. As for the
statement that Delta Sigma Rho wanted
sympathy, it is knoziii by those involved
that the society's representatives had to
plead ivith at least one official for quite
some time before it was decided that the
society's dance would not be cancelled
then and there.
As for the vituperative pen of the Edi
tor, the Editor awaits with interest more
nice, mild communications from the de
baters. On ivith the dance!
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir : Probably you can explain to
me through the medium of your editorial
column why you represented to the cam
pus that Delta Sigma Rho was going to
lose their dance, which you knew was not
so, and particularly why you gave out
the impression that we were going around
the campus whining for sympathy, and
why you singled us out for attack from
among the numerous violators of the ex
ecutive committee ruling in re posters?
You should know, as well as anyone on
the campus, that persons who are inter
ested in debating are of necessity of a
type who do not feel sorry for them
selves, as you express it, or they would
not be engaged in an activity that is
meted out so much sarcasm and criticism
by the campus wiseacres. «
Three days ago Masquers put a large
sign in an unauthorized place. Why
did you pick on them as a glaring ex
ample of law breaker? They were more
guilty than Delta Sigma Rho. Also
there have been previous violations as
you admit that have been given a warn
ing and let go by. Why, Mr. Editor,
did you not take a crack at them? Pos
sibly you thought that we were so weak
that we would not resent the insult?
In the past four years Delta Sigma
Rho has numbered in its membership
an editor of the Daily, an editor of the
Quad, and an editor of Chappie and a
student body president. An organiza
tion that has been composed of such
men will naturally resent being made
the plaything for the unsportsmanlike
and vituperative pen of a Daily editor.

column why you represented to the cam
pus that Delta Sigma Rho was going to
lose their dance, which you knew was not
so, and particularly why you gave out
the impression that we were going around
the campus whining for sympathy, and
why you singled us out for attack from
among the numerous violators of the ex
ecutive committee ruling in re posters?
You should know, as well as anyone on
the campus, that persons who are inter
ested in debating are of necessity of a
type who do not feel sorry for them
selves, as you express it, or they would
not be engaged in an activity that is
meted out so much sarcasm and criticism
by the campus wiseacres. «
Three days ago Masquers put a large
sign in an unauthorized place. Why
did you pick on them as a glaring ex
ample of law breaker? They were more
guilty than Delta Sigma Rho. Also
there have been previous violations as
you admit that have been given a warn
ing and let go by. Why, Mr. Editor,
did you not take a crack at them? Pos
sibly you thought that we were so weak
that we would not resent the insult?
In the past four years Delta Sigma
Rho has numbered in its membership
an editor of the Daily, an editor of the
Quad, and an editor of Chappie and a
student body president. An organiza
tion that has been composed of such
men will naturally resent being made
the plaything for the unsportsmanlike
and vituperative pen of a Daily editor.

Phooey! Look what the Editor has
gotten himself in for by calling attention
to a breech of rules! Also for remarking
in a news story that the fracture would
probably be punished.
The following viewpoint is published
not because it adds anything new to the
situation, but in order to correct any
impression thai the story published in the
Daily yesterday was NOT news. Assur
ance was given, as was said before, by a
member of the Mens Council, that the
violation would be punished. As for the
statement that Delta Sigma Rho wanted
sympathy, it is knoziii by those involved
that the society's representatives had to
plead ivith at least one official for quite
some time before it was decided that the
society's dance would not be cancelled
then and there.
As for the vituperative pen of the Edi
tor, the Editor awaits with interest more
nice, mild communications from the de
baters. On ivith the dance!
