## Mighty Ted 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
AY flNfwCßp, Belgium

Perhaps the greatest runner who ever represented the United States in
Olympic contests was Ted Meredith, who won the 800 meter race at Stockholm
in 1912 when a 19-year-old high school boy. Fresh from setting new world's
interscholastic records in the quarter mile and half mile runs while competing
for Mercersburg academy, Ted qualified for the Olympic team. When the
800 metre race was lueld, this youngster defeated the greatest half mile
runners in the world, including Sheppard and Davenport of the United States
and Braun of Germany, setting a new Olympic record of 1 minute, 51 9-10
seconds, which still stands. The runners continued a few feet further on to
the half mile mark, where Ted was also timed in the new world's record of
1 minute 52% seconds. Ted also competed in the finals of the 400 metre run,
placing fourth, and ran on the U. S. team which broke the record with the
1600> metre relay.
On May 13, 1916, as captain of the University of Penn. track team, M«redith
broke his own record in the half mile, setting a new mark of 1 minute 52 1-5
seconds. Two weeks later, at the Eastern intercollegiate meet in the Harvard
stadium, he proved himself to be the greatest middle distance runner of all
time by winning both the quarter and the half mile runs with only an hour s
rest between them, and setting new records in both races. Ted's time of 47 2-5
in the 440 yards is the world's record for that distance around one turn and his
time of 1.53 in the 880 s-et a new mark for the I. C. 4 A. games.
In September 1916, Ted went abroad with a team of five Americans who
competed in Norway and Sweden and he also competed in France during the
war. In 1920 Meredith made a popular "comeback" and qualified for the
American team to the seventh Olympiad at Antwerp. He ran in the 400
metres, but was shut out in the finals. Perhaps Ted will feel the old ambition
again this summer.
