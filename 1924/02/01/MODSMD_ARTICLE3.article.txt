1. Rooting Sections Gather.
£ By the beginning of the second half,
!•! a large sized rooting section for each
l» side had gathered, and the encourage-
Hment offered seemed effective in quick
ie ening the play. One side would drib
£ ble the ball the length of the court and
£ shoot for the basket, only to have an op
j. posing player catch the try and repeat
£ the process in the other direction.
£ The Phi Delts were the more suc
. cessful in their shots, and won 13 to 10.
J Fletcher, Phi Delt center, covered the
* floor well and got at least his share of
■ the jumps. O'Hara at guard made sev
£ eral scores and was also effective in
!* defense. Flood, heavy standing guard,
> was a veritable table Rock of Gibraltar.
£ Timmons starred for Sigma Chi, do
* ing most of the scoring. Dryden also
. played a good game.

* The Delta Chi-Beta Theta Pi game

. I finding the basket, and even the shots
"j that hit the hoop stayed out. The
Delta Chi men managed to sink two
J more field goals, and the half ended in
their favor, 6 to 0.
The excited rooting section nearly
! went wild when the Betas took a spurt
i and ran up four points at tl»e begin
ning of the second half. Playing with
renewed vigor, the Betas penetrated
i the Delta Chi defense time and time
| again, only to miss the try.
1 As the end approached, the pace stif
fened, the Betas tr^-indesperately to
j tie the score, with Delta Chi equally

' j final whistle found the score 10 to 6 in
* | favor of the latter team.
| Suffern was the outstanding player
* for Delta Chi. In spite of his light
' weight, he dribbled" the ball the length
*:of the floor more than once. Copeland
at forward and Hood at guard fur
[, nished able support.
| For the Betas, Granger, Sproull, and
Dole provided a strong defense. The
opposing defense prevented Alabaster
and Tibbe, forwards, from getting near
the basket, and their tries from a dis
tance were far below average.
