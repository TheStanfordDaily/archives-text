# "MILESTONES" TO BE VISIBLE TO ROUGHS AT FOUR BIT TAX
## 
### 
<$ <v
Roughs' Roost, which failed to ,3>
<?> pan out in the Union basement, <$>
<?• will be appropriately shifted to <S>
<•> the balcony of the 1 Assembly hall <♦-
<•> during "Milestones" this evening. <?>
<$> A block of "four-bit" seats, de- •$>
<?• signed especially for the non- <$>
<S> queening, unshaven, traditional <?>
<$> Stanford man will be set aside
<?> in the front of the horseshoe, al- 4>
<*> most overhanging the stage. Here <*>
<S> the real theatrical enthusiasts 4>
<§> may perch as at the opera, <£■
<§> munching peanuts, and shouting 4>
"bravo" at the actresses. <?>
<4> In order that the sweatered, <$>
<$• corduroyed gallery gods may ♦
<t> avoid embarrassment at contast 4>
<$> with sartorially slick queeners, •$>
<*> the TiO-cent seats will be dis- <$>
<S> pensed at a separate box-office / »>
<5> under the arch. <$>
