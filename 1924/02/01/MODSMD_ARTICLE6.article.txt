# FRESHMAN NINE TO PLAY SAN MATEANS IN SEASON OPENER
## 
### 
Cardinal freshman baseballers will
open the 1924 season against the San
Mateo high school nine at 2:30 on the
free man field tomorrow afternoon.
The strength of the Stanford team
, is little known this early in the sea
. son, hut Coach Harry Wolter, varsity
coach, has been able to scrape togeth
er a team which should give the San
Mateo team a stiff workout.
Babes Have Good Battery
Franz Osthaus, who will probably
take the mound for the freshman ag
| gregation, is a baseball nlayer of un
usual ability for a first year man. He
handles himself like a veteran, and
is a strong hitter.
"Jimmy" Stewart, catcher, should
show up well for the Babes at his
position. In practice he has displayed
' no end of strength in the hitting de
' partment. and his work behind the
1 mask has been highly satisfactory.
Alan McCray is perhaps the strong
: jest hitter on the squad. He is showing
1 up better at the first base position
" than any of the other candidates
' , which have turned out.
â€¢! Howard Sheets and Gerald Stewart
5 are two of the best outfielders which
1 have reported thus far.
