# GLASS CUTS TWO AS AUTOS CRASH AT SCHOOLHOUSE
## Miss Aileen Hicks Injured as Windshield Breaks; Visitors Hurt Also 
### 
Cuts about the face and head were
received by Miss Aileen Hicks, a
member of the Daily Palo Alto staff,
and by Mrs. Webster Hamlett of
Sunnyvale, when a light roadster
driven by Elwood James, a Stanford
student, collided with the touring car
operated by Webster Hamlett, at the
intersection of Santa Ynez and Lasuen
streets, yesterday at about 5 p.m.
Miss Marjorie Allen, who was also
riding in the roadster with Miss Hicks,
was uninjured, as were both drivers.
Mr. and Mrs. A. Thorpe, the other
occupants of the Hamlett car, each
received sprains as the automobile
swerved off the road and crashed into
the brick wall of the gramar school,
at 7 Lasuen, was uninjured, as were
both drivers.
James was traveling toward the
â– Quad along Lasuen as the other ma
chine was coming down the hill on
Santa Ynez. According to James, he
was reaching to choke the engine
when he approached the corner, and
did not notice the other car. Although
neither was traveling very fast, the
Sunnyvale driver could not stop at the
foot of the hill in time, he says. A
third car which reached the intersec
tion at about the same time escaped
damage by turning up the hill.
The wounds of both women were
dressed at the Peninsula hospital in
Palo Alto, proving to be not serious.
