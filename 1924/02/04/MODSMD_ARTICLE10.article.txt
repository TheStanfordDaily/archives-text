# PERSONALITY OF LEGINSKA IS CHIEF CONCERT INTEREST
## Pianiste to Appear Tonight in Joint Program With Chamber Music Group 
### 
The vibrant personality of Ethel
Login ska. felt by audiences wherever
she appears, is one of the chief antici
pations in her concert in the Assembly
i hall at 8:15 tonight in conjunction with
j the Chamber Music Society of San
j Francisco.
Leginska is a slight, blond English
! girl, with a magnetic touch at the piano
keyboard, peculiar ideas about dress,
(and a force of character which caused
her to change her name from "Ethel
Leggins" when she left her home in
| Hull. England, because in no other way
could she secure an audience with the
cynical London critics and producers.
Since then her mastery of the piano
has caused her to be compared in style
and technique to Paderewski.
Leginska Solos a Special Treat.
Leginska will play three solo num
: hers in her concert tonight, a conces
sion she has refused to grant San
Francisco audiences.
