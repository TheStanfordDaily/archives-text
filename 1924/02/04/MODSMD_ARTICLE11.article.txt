# Masquers Set Standard For Smoothness In 'Milestones'
## 
### 
"Milestones", Masquers drama, given
Friday night, went along so smoothly
that it was difficult to remember that
it was an Assembly hall performance,
and not something of the professional
j stage.
The play belongs to the most diffi-
I cult type of good presentations that
| camptis players can attempt. It lacked
1 the usual situations and action, which
1 are usual with performances and de
j pended entirely upon the power of
; the cast to give Bennett's characters
| such strong portrayals as to carry
the drama along without the play.
And one went away with the im
pression that Gordon Davis had got
the utmost out of tho abilities of the
cast which was adequate.
Although (hp youth of the last gen
eration tended to weaken the play
somewhat, as a whole it was well
done, find the odds against the por-
I formance being considerable — the

type of play and razzing "roughs"—
that unfavorable criticism of any
kind seems entirely out of place.
Some older members of the audi
ence were heard to remark (hat
Marjorie Allen as Rose Sibley sur
passed the work of the actress who
took that role in the original New
York production some years ago.
This is easy to believe.
More than any other member of
the cast Aileene Burke's acting was
consistently fine. As the unhappy
Gertrude Rhead she went through
each act changed only as such a one
could be changed by age and bitter
ness.
The dignity and weight of the play
rested heavily 011 the shoulders of
John Rhead, played by Cecil Morris.
His portrayal of old age was very
well done, and his dominance of
the latter part of the last act was
essential to the successful conclusion
of the presentation.
Charles Parkes, frequently a mem
ber of campus casts during the last
two years, gave by far his best per
formance as Ned Pym, the distin
guished "donkey", a very distinctive
personality.
Individuals, Not Types
This is one of the fine character
istics of the Masquer's production:
the players were distinct individ
uals, nad not types.
Sam Sibley, played by William
Thornton, was one of the chief in
struments of comedy. His best (and
most difficult) acting was done in
the first act, where he represented
clearly the unfortunate intollerance
of Ned Pym.
David Lamson as Arthur Preece,
was a very refreshing influence among
the troubles of the last acts. A strong
refinement distinguished Lamson's
Preece.
Emotion
Edythe Baylis as Emily Rhead as
-1 sunned perhaps the most difficult emo
| tional ucting in the drama. Her stage
j presence was good and her interpreta
j tion realistic throughout, though more
| effective in the last act.
Dorothy Dahler, as Nancy Sibley,
| the foremost comic character, secured
I laughing responses at every speech
| and act.
| Mrs. Rhead, played by Patrice Nau
l man, was very pleasant.
Comedy Good
Philip Urner gave a very creditable
1 interpretation of Lord Monkhurst, and
i carried the comedy of the role to
! good effect.
Adelaide Kellev as the Honorable
Muriel Pym. and James Rusk as Ricli
; ard Sibley, representing the modern
j generation, were not able to secure
the same sympathy with the audience
i as the other principals, perhaps be
! cause they had a shorter time in which
! to work.
Thompson, played by Carlton Byrne,
| and Webster, played by Wilfred Hun
i kins, were admirable butlers.
