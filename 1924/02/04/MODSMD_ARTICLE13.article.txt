# VARSITY SLUGGERS SWAMP OLYMPICS
## Stanford Scores Nine Runs in 4th Inning; Lowenstein Scatters Bingles 
### 
Stanford's baseball team made an
other victorious advance last Satur
day afternoon when they decisively
defeated the Olympic Club 11 to 3, on
the Varsity diamond.
A1 Lowenstein, pitching his first
game of the season for the Cards, kept
his hits well scattered, and with good
support from infield and outfield kept
the Winged "O" aggregation on stilts
throughout the game.
Cards Score Nine in Fourth
One of the most encouraging, and
at the same time disgusting, moments
of the game came in the fourth in
ning When the Cards smashed nine
runs across the rubber while Olympic
Club fielders were chasing hits and
making errors.
Fuller started the fourth stanza
with a hot liner to center field, was
advanced to second on Woodward's
walk, and scored on an error by
Berger made on Mulchay's smash.
Runs began to pour in at this point
like marks into a German bank. Wood
ward scored, Mulcahy. Lowenstein,
Roberts, Cuddeback, McCandlesa and
Lawson all tallied, the latter crossing
home plate twice. The other scores
come in the fifth and eighth innings.
At no point did the Olympic threaten
the Cards after the scoreboard regis
tered a nine-run lead for Stanford|
Lowenstein kept his head, and had
no end of support.
McCandless, Lnwson Star
"Bus" McCandless busted into the
per cent column with three clean hits
to his credit. McCandless invariably
was up to bat at a juncture when men
were on base, and his hits either
scored or advanced players on each
occasion. He made one nice catch in
tire outfield on a long fly by Hermle
which skinned the foul line, and
looked like an easy hit.
Lawson played the best all-'rouiul
ball of the afternoon. He managed his
position with precision and his pegs
to second went like bullets, catching
Olympic stealers without difficulty.
Lawson chalked up two clouts, a dou
ble in the fourth frame, and single to
left field in the eighth.
