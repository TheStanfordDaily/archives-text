# OLYMPICS TIE WITH CARD SOCCER TEAM; MUD SLOWS GAME
## 
### 
Playing on heavy, muddy ground,
the Cardinal and Olympic soccer
elevens finished with a 2-2 tie on robin
Field, San Francisco, Saturday after
noon.
The Post street men led with a 2 to
1 lead until one minute before the final
whistle when "Pete" Franklin, Stanford
forward, evened the count with a well
placed kick.
Franklin, aided by the rest of the
forward line, accounted for the two
Cardinal points. Sands, center for
ward for the "Winged O" eleven,
scored its two goals.
Coach Harvey Maloney, of the Card
inal squad, lias been experimenting
with several forward combinations and
sacrificed a large score in the endeavor
to find a workable combination.
He expressed himself as satisfied
with the showing made, however, since
the eleven is being pointed for the
California game. February 12. By that
time he hopes to have a forward com
bination that will equal the fast back
field he already has to work with.
