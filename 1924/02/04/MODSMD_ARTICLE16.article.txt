# CARD DEFENSIVE DEFEATS NEVADA By 30-10 SCORE
## Varsity Runs Wild in Last Half, Scoring Twenty to Sagehen's Three 
### David Mieklejohn 
Nevada, showing an utter lack of of
fensive strength, was swamped under
a 30 to 10 score by the team work and
diversified scoring ability of the Cardi
nal quintet in the Pavilion last Satur
day night.
The score of the first half was Stan
ford 10, Nevada 7.
For the greater part of the first
period the Nevada defense was airtight,
and it succeeded in keeping the Stan
ford team in the middle of the court,
forcing the Cards to attempt innumer
able long shots.
Substitutes Weaken Team.
Kerr began the game with Shipkey
and Moody replacing Steele and Mc-
Burney. The combination did not
work out to advantage, and it was not
until the regular players were put into
the contest that the Cardinals began to
gather headway.
Nevers was the first player to score
otf a pair of free throws, and "Nip"
McHose raised the score to Stanford 4,
Nevada 0 with another brace of fotds.
Nevada Leads at Start.
Nevada forged ahead for the only
period of the game with five points to
the Cards four. They held the advant
age for a period, but lost it when Mc-
Hose, Steele, and Mcßurney each
tallied a field goal. Fredericks raised
the Wolf pack total to seven points
with another score from the floor.
The first half was ragged. Both teams
were playing ; n circles, accomplishing
little. Funv ling was common, and
nn't 1. •- sick' seemed strong enough to
penetrate the other's defense.
Wolf Pack Weakens.
Something happened to the Sage
brushes in the second period. They
seemed unable to keep the ball going
toward their own basket, and lost it re
peatedly by fumbling and indecision to
a waiting Stanford man. Stanford on
the other band bad all the luck in the
world. The majority of the close shots
were scored, and a great many of the
long attempts also found their way
through the net.
Nevers started the last half with a
field goal in the first minute of play.
Mcßurney from in front of the goals I
stored another basket, and Nevers
again tallied with a field score. Nevada
appeared to be paralyzed. The best it
could gather during the entire period
was three points which came as the re
sult of personals on Stanford players.
The Card defense was a stone wall.
The Sagebrushers started what ap
peared to be a successful drive only to
have it broken up by a determined
Stanford guard.
Mcßurney Stars.
Mcßurney played the best game of
the evening. He scored six points in
the course of the game. His guarding,
floor work, and activity in penetrating
the Wolf defense puts Mcßurney on a
sound basis of the best running guard
on the team.
All the Stanford team shared in the
scoring, even Dave Oliva tallying on a
long shot from the center of the court.
McHose scored six of the Stanford
points, Nevers eight and Steele three.
Kerr substituted freely in the last
j part of the second half, and the re
serves played together to advantage,
checking the Nevada drives as effect
ively as the regulars.

Nevada 0 with another brace of fotds.
Nevada Leads at Start.
Nevada forged ahead for the only
period of the game with five points to
the Cards four. They held the advant
age for a period, but lost it when Mc-
Hose, Steele, and Mcßurney each
tallied a field goal. Fredericks raised
the Wolf pack total to seven points
with another score from the floor.
The first half was ragged. Both teams
were playing ; n circles, accomplishing
little. Funv ling was common, and
nn't 1. •- sick' seemed strong enough to
penetrate the other's defense.
Wolf Pack Weakens.
Something happened to the Sage
brushes in the second period. They
seemed unable to keep the ball going
toward their own basket, and lost it re
peatedly by fumbling and indecision to
a waiting Stanford man. Stanford on
the other band bad all the luck in the
world. The majority of the close shots
were scored, and a great many of the
long attempts also found their way
through the net.
Nevers started the last half with a
field goal in the first minute of play.
Mcßurney from in front of the goals I
stored another basket, and Nevers
again tallied with a field score. Nevada
appeared to be paralyzed. The best it
could gather during the entire period
was three points which came as the re
sult of personals on Stanford players.
The Card defense was a stone wall.
The Sagebrushers started what ap
peared to be a successful drive only to
have it broken up by a determined
Stanford guard.
Mcßurney Stars.
Mcßurney played the best game of
the evening. He scored six points in
the course of the game. His guarding,
floor work, and activity in penetrating
the Wolf defense puts Mcßurney on a
sound basis of the best running guard
on the team.
All the Stanford team shared in the
scoring, even Dave Oliva tallying on a
long shot from the center of the court.
McHose scored six of the Stanford
points, Nevers eight and Steele three.
Kerr substituted freely in the last
j part of the second half, and the re
serves played together to advantage,
checking the Nevada drives as effect
ively as the regulars.

war in 11)14 the number ot' reigning

Nevada, showing an utter lack of of
fensive strength, was swamped under
a 30 to 10 score by the team work and
diversified scoring ability of the Cardi
nal quintet in the Pavilion last Satur
day night.
The score of the first half was Stan
ford 10, Nevada 7.
For the greater part of the first
period the Nevada defense was airtight,
and it succeeded in keeping the Stan
ford team in the middle of the court,
forcing the Cards to attempt innumer
able long shots.
Substitutes Weaken Team.
Kerr began the game with Shipkey
and Moody replacing Steele and Mc-
Burney. The combination did not
work out to advantage, and it was not
until the regular players were put into
the contest that the Cardinals began to
gather headway.
Nevers was the first player to score
otf a pair of free throws, and "Nip"
McHose raised the score to Stanford 4,
