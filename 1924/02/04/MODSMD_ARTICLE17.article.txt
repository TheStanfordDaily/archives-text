# FROSH NINE LOSES TO SAN MATEO HIGH SCHOOL; GAME SLOW
## 
### 
After starting out with a bang in
their game with San Mateo high
school Saturday, the Frosh baseballers
got tired, decided that winning a ball
game was pretty hard work, and lost
5 to 3.
Morrill, lead-off man for the fresh
men, smashed out a double to open
Stanford's half of the first. Sheets
walked, and prospects seemed bright
for a win.
But "Minnie" O'Brien, San Mateo
hurler, worked himself out of a nice
hole by striking out two of the next
three batters and forcing the other to
push out a feeble grounder.
From then on it was all San Mateo.
O'Brien had a fast straight ball that
kept the frosh guessing, and his team
mates piled up enough runs to give
him a comfortable lead.
Runs Scattered
Stanford's runs came one at a time.
Smythe scoring the first when he was
walked. He made the rest of the trip
around the bases on walks and wild
pitches.
In the eighth inning McKersie,
Frosh first baseman, reached first on
an error and tallied the second run on
another wild pitch.
The ninth spasm opened strong and
for a few moments the freshmen came
to life. Osthaus was safe at first on
an error, Morrill walked. Sheets
struck out, and Jerry Stewart crashed
out a double, scoring Osthaus.
The San Mateo pitcher tightened up
at this point and forced McKersie and
Lindquist to ground out.
San Mateans Rally
San Mateo pushed over two runs in
thp second inning and three more in
the third. The Frosh fielders woke up
; and during the rest o'f the game kept
| the high school team from scoring.
Osthaus pitched a fair game, but
! the team as whole failed to show much
fight. Jerry Stewart lined out a couple
I of hits and covered left field capably.
, Morrill at third and Smvthe on the
keystone bag were trying all the tim<e.
There is plenty of good material
; out for the freshman team.
