# THE 						EXPERIMENT THAT FIZZLED
## 
### 
As an accommodation to the Stanford men who prefer to limit their
campus attire to cords and flannel, the management of "Milestones" de
cided last week to throw open a section of the house to roughs, at a price
of fifty cents. Appreciation of this privilege took the form of ill-man
nered yowling all through one of the best-directed plays this campus has
seen.
The roughs came, unshaven and unwashed, and brought their voices
with them. In the hope that they would be noticed, and remarked upon
for their "he-man" qualities (a pose they love to imitate), these roughs
made themselves conspicuous by childish boisterousness.
In an Elizabethan audience this would be overlooked as the usual out
burst of ignorant folk in the cheaper seats. Evidently the cheapness of
admission cheapened the roughs' standard of behavior to the same level.
The audience Friday night being supposedly made up of 1924 college
students, however, this attitude cannot be excused on such a basis.
The dramatic critic of the Palo Alto Times remarks that if one has to
sell certain seats for fifty cents, it would be better to limit the purchasers
to children. This, we believe, would not do, as the children, through lack
of training, might be almost as bad as the roughs have proven themselves
to be, and so keep up the regrettable atmosphere created last Friday.
The sale of seats to roughs was merely an unfortunate experiment,
and proved again the statement made after every Roughs' Day—that
roughs, as a class, cannot be trusted to wear their discretion, courtesy, or
common sense when they consider themselves on parade.
TWO STORIES appeared in the same paper yesterday; one said
"California rooters confidently expected a rally in the second half—but
the rally did not come, and the California five was beaten badly." The
other said: "The Stanford team did not really get started until the second
period; then the Cards rolled up twenty points to an easy victory."
THE EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily Palo Alto will meet tomor
row at 1:15 in the Daily office, to elect an editor for the balance of the
college year.
