the intramural series, when it defeated

a noticeable absence of fumbles. A. K.

such good feeling and such an absence

In the other scheduled game, Phi
Gamma Delta defeated Encina First,
17-14. Encina started out strong, run
ning up a seven-point lead. The Fijis,
by good guarding, checked the offen :

lose their drive, allowing the Fijis to
bring the score up to 7-10 by half time.
In the second half the Fijis passed
F.ncina and won, 17-14.
The game was clumsy, with many
fumbles, neither side seeming to he
able to hold the ball. Colvin, Condit,
and Hunt accounted for most of the
Fiji scores. A. Stevenson, Anawalt,
and Snow did good work for Encina.
