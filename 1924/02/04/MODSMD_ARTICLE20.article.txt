# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Cometh now the sccond dance. The
Daily Palo Alto is printing the view
point belozv for whatever value the reader
zcish.es to ascribe to it, the Editor merely
wishing to correct some false steps by the
writer before passing the matter along.
In the first place, it is becoming boring to
reiterate that while some members of the
debating honor society might have been
told that n-o ajrtion would be taken an their
case, the Daily Palo Alto was given dis
tinctly to understand by a competent au
thority that punishment would be meted
out zvhich it jmw.
The Daily Palo Alto nozv has another
enraged customer on its hands in the per
son of the chairman of the election com
mittee; his notice of the opening of nomi
nations was throum out in order thai the
notice of Delta Sigma Rho's dance might
be run in Friday's paper. My, what pre
judice!
In closing this spasm, the Editor rather
unnecessarily descends to the personal
level of the communication follozving, to
remark that debaters must be rather ego
tistical to think that some erne who has
never had any interest in debating would
take the trouble to haze a bias against it.
Let the dance procecd:
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: I wonder if it would not
have been better, Mr. Editor, had you
left the entire matter of Delta Sigma
Rho's dance and the objectionable posters

to be decidcd by those with whom the
final decision rested? And wouldn't it
have been more in keeping with the func
tion of a college paper, if it were neces
sary to print something, to print facts?
Circumstances surrounding the affair
were fully explained to those to whom
explanation was due; when it was under
stood that the posters were put up where
they didn't belong without the knowledge
of any member of Delta Sigma Rho, that
they were all taken down the next morn
ing before the students had been subjected
to their presence for more than two hours,
and certainly before any notice of impend
ing action by the Executive Committee
had been communicated, assurance was
given that the dance would not be can
celled. All this took place before Thurs
day's paper went to print, and you were
informed of it, yet that paper carried a
front page "news" article containing mis
statements and half-truths, with an un
warranted forecast of punishment to be
meted out to the guilty organization, and
an editorial, vindictive and insulting in
character, and obviously based on preju
dice. And Friday, instead of frankly ac
knowledging your error, you printed a
little notice on the back page to the effect
that the dance would be held, but stating
that "all proceeds must be turned over to
the student manager." Certainly it was
well known that that' was the sole purpose
of the danceâ€”why, pray, the use of the
word "must"? Your attitude was petty,
Mr. Editor; it seemed to be an attempt

on your part to assume the roles of judge,
jury, and the entire police forcc.
It is not to he overlooked that whereas
no editorial space ever was spared by you
for any comment on forensic plans or
achievements, you experienced no diffi
culty in finding space immediately for
knocking the honorary debating organi
zation and apparently trying to kill the
dance it was going to sponsor. Your dis
crimination was undoubtedly the result of
personal bias; but why use the Daily Palo
Alto advertise that bias? Why twist
facts to suit your prejudices?
In spite of your efforts, Mr. Editor,
the dance was held as advertised, and it
was a success, financially and otherwise.
And, oh yes, the proceeds will be turned
over immediately to the student manager.
Respectfully,
ROBERT E. LEWIS,
President, Delta Sigma Rho.
