Elynor was the maid with the golden locks and the eyes of blue. Elynor
was a freshman and did not know the ways of university life. Wednesday
night found her at the dance with Jimmie. Friday night she went to the
play with Paul, and Saturday night found her queening to the game. Sunday
night she went to the movies with Bill. Thus the weeks went by, yea even
the weeks of finals.
Now Elynor knows one of the ways of university life—the way out. —G. J.
