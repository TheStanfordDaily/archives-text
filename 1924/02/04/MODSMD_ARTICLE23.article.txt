To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: —
In regard to the question of proper
display of posters on the campus, no
true lover of art will deny that the
vivid squares of cardboard harmonize
badly with the color scheme of trees
and telephone poles. But has it ever
occurred to the authors of the re
strictive ordinance that there are on
the whole campus only a scant half
dozen bona fide, legitimate, duly sanc
tioned bulletin boards which are avail
able for poster display?
Why can't we have a few more such
havens for the persecuted poster? Pos
sible locations are: a corner of the
E. E. laboratory, opposite the book
store; the west facade of the campus
car depot, one of the oaks in front of
the Library; the Romanic Languages
building.
What say, believers in progress?
Here's a chance to champion a cause.

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: —
We shall never have anything but
provincial drama at Stanford until we
in the audience learn to show as good
taste as the actors do.
"Milestones" was a potent example
of an excellent play, well-acted, nearly
spoiled by the provincialism of us
who composed the audience.
We seem unable to forget person
alities even on the stage. High school
audiences laugh when two of their
well-known schoolmates act out a
love scene on the stage. The fact that
Stanford audiences do the same belies
the name "university."
"Milestones" had a punch that prob
ably got over to the majority of the
audience. But in the first act espe
cially, it was nearly spoiled, through
no fault of the actors or the play.
We continually demand better
drama, and just as continually thwart
attempts to give it to us.
Those who saw the play undoubted
ly feel that better acting, better set
tings, and better coaching could not
be expected in any campus. How much
more effective it would have been had
there been that impersonal feeling
that an audience must have to get the
best enjoyment from such a play! It
is worth thinking over.
—One of the Audience.

Rollin Pease, music professor at
Northwestern University, says there
are no new tunes. "Yes We Have No
Bananas" is a cobination of "Peter,
Pumpkin Eater," and "Bring Back My
Bonnie to Me," he asserts.

To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: —
We shall never have anything but
provincial drama at Stanford until we
in the audience learn to show as good
taste as the actors do.
"Milestones" was a potent example
of an excellent play, well-acted, nearly
spoiled by the provincialism of us
who composed the audience.
We seem unable to forget person
alities even on the stage. High school
audiences laugh when two of their
well-known schoolmates act out a
love scene on the stage. The fact that
Stanford audiences do the same belies
the name "university."
"Milestones" had a punch that prob
ably got over to the majority of the
audience. But in the first act espe
cially, it was nearly spoiled, through
no fault of the actors or the play.
We continually demand better
drama, and just as continually thwart
attempts to give it to us.
Those who saw the play undoubted
ly feel that better acting, better set
tings, and better coaching could not
be expected in any campus. How much
more effective it would have been had
there been that impersonal feeling
that an audience must have to get the
best enjoyment from such a play! It
is worth thinking over.
—One of the Audience.

Rollin Pease, music professor at
Northwestern University, says there
are no new tunes. "Yes We Have No
Bananas" is a cobination of "Peter,
Pumpkin Eater," and "Bring Back My
Bonnie to Me," he asserts.
To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir: —
In regard to the question of proper
display of posters on the campus, no
true lover of art will deny that the
vivid squares of cardboard harmonize
badly with the color scheme of trees
and telephone poles. But has it ever
occurred to the authors of the re
strictive ordinance that there are on
the whole campus only a scant half
dozen bona fide, legitimate, duly sanc
tioned bulletin boards which are avail
able for poster display?
Why can't we have a few more such
havens for the persecuted poster? Pos
sible locations are: a corner of the
E. E. laboratory, opposite the book
store; the west facade of the campus
car depot, one of the oaks in front of
the Library; the Romanic Languages
building.
What say, believers in progress?
Here's a chance to champion a cause.
