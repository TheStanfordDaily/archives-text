### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Clarence Pinkston of the Olympic Club of San Francisco, who is the outdoor
national diving champion. Pinkston first jumped into fame in 1920 when he
won the fancy high diving championship at the Olympic games, and took sec
ond in the springboard diving. Last year he defeated his club mate, A1 White,
former champion in both outdoor events. Both Pinkston and White are pupils
of Ernie Brandsten, swimming coach at Stanford University.
Charley Paddock of Pasadena, California, the world's fastest human, who
has been much in the limelight of late because of the controversy over his
eligibility to represent America in the coming Olympics. I was a member of
the U. S. Olympic team in 1920 and slept in the "Glory Hole" of the transport,
and lived in the ill-smelling schoolhouse in Antwerp with Charley, and can't
help but sympathize with him in his arguments with the A. A. U. A lot of
Paddock's "errors" were probably indirectly caused by the A. A. U.'s "errors"
in 1920, and this should be considered before preventing our best sprinter
from competing for his country again.
Herb Pennock of Kenentt Square, Pennsylvania, who was the leading
American league pitcher last year and one of the stars of the world's series.
Herb pitched in three games for the Yankees, all of which his team won.
Perhaps his best bit of pitching skill and nerve was shown in the fourth
game, when he was sent in to pitch to the dangerous Frisch in the eighth
inning with two out, the bases full, and three runs in. He retired the side,
however, and probably saved the game for his team. Pennock pitched four
years for the Athletics and six for the Red Sox, and was a member of the
U. S. ball team that toured the Orient a year ago.
