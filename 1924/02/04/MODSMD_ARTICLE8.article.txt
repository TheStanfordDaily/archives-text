# DEKE PURSE GOES TO FULLER IN 52 MILE SWEEPSTAKES
## Roller Skater Makes San Francisco-San Jose Trip in 11: 50 
### 
Skating und"er the colors of Stan
ford University, Dana "Dope" Fuller
on Friday night won the champion
ship in the San Francisco-San Jose
roller-skate marathan, completing the
event in 11 hours and 50 minutes.
He was caught in eight hours flat
by one watch, but the watch had
stopped.
Clear, cool weather all the way
aided the Cardinal racer as he sped
down the road, racing against time
for the Deke purse in the Highway
Sweepstakes.
Flashing by the starter's box at
10:45 Friday night, Fuller rolled away
from his home, 2025 Lion street, San
Francisco, headed for the finish line
fifty-five miles away at the city limits
of San Jose, trailed by his mechani
cian, "Blink" Williamson, in an auto
mobile.
Exactly one hour from the time of
the start, a front wheel on his left
skate broke. Fuller went to the pit,
and in 55 seconds had a new wheel in
its place.
The first thirteen miles were cov
ered in the fast time of two hours and
fifteen minutes.
A stop was made at South San Fran
cisco and half an hour was spent in
filling the radiator with sandwiches
and coffee.
Leaving South San Francisco at
1:30 a.m., "Dope" passed through Bur
lingame at 2:30, Redwood City at 4
a.m., and rolled into Palo Alto at 5
o'clock Saturday morning.
An hour was spent here, during
which Fuller came out to the campus
and congratulated his fraternity broth
ers on their bad bets.
After eating a steak in Palo Alto,
Fuller breezed on with the idea of
finishing as soon as possible.
He had covered the first thirty-six
miles in six hours and fifteen minutes.
Nearing Mayfield, Fuller had en
gine trouble. His legs began bothering
him, and frequent stops were neces
sary from Mayfield to Santa Clara, at
each of which "Blink" Williamson, me
chanic, slapped alcohol on Fuller's
aching legs.
For a time it looked as though
Fuller would have to give up his ra.ce.
His legs were tied in knots and re
fused to function for longer than ten
or fifteen minutes at a time.
Near Santa Clara, he rested for half
an hour and, refreshed by this, rolled
the last four miles in fifty minutes,
running on two cylinders.
His actual skating time for the fifty
five miles was nine hours and a half.
His average speed was five and three
fourths miles per hour. These records
will be filed with the A. A. S. U.
At San Bruno, Fuller was flagged by
the chief of police, who mistook him
for a young boy, and ordered him to
throw away the cigar which he was
smoking'. After a few moments' delay,
Fuller convinced the chief that he
was responsible, and was allowed to
proceed.
Near Redwood City, where repairs
on the highway are being made, the
road was covered with gravel which
had been transformed into slush by
the recent rain, and the skater was
forced to plod through in low.
Fuller attracted large crowds as he
reached the finish line, and passing
through Santa Clara he received huge
cheers. As he passed the judges' box
on the outskirts of San Jose, the entire
grandstand arose a.6 one man, and
gave him the campus ovation.
In spite of the protection afforded

by Williamson's auto, which trailed
him the entire distance, Fuller was
crowded off the course several times
by motorists who cut in too sharply
after passing Williamson's car.
During the trip Fuller smoked fif
teen cigars and a package of cigar
ettes. In addition to the meals he ate
at his stopping places, Fuller con
sumed four bars of chocolate and a
pint bottle of coffee.
Fuller will be awarded the Skate
"S" because of his brilliant feat in
bringing the roller-skate title home
to Stanford.

were disposed of by 600 members of
the California Grape Growers' Ex
