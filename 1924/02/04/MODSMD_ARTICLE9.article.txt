# DAVID AND PRICE STAR AS FRESHMEN DEFEAT BERKELEY
## 
### 
Berkeley high failed to live up to ex
pectations Saturday, and proved easy
for the Babes, who defeated the preps
23 to 7.
The conquerors of the California
freshmen were completely outplayed in
all departments of the game by Coach
"Husky" Hunt's fighting freshmen.
David and Price shot with unusual ac
curacy and were responsible for most of
the freshman scores.
David scored five field goals. All of
them were from long shots. Price made
four goals, and Jayred the other two.
Only one point was made from the foul
line.. Price seems to be able to score
consistently from all angles. Jayred's
goals came from shots from under the
basket after he had received a pass from
one of the forwards.
Close Guarding.
The ability of the 1927 guards was
shown again Saturday when they held
the Berkeley five to two lone goals.
