# Leginska Shows Amazing Power In Chamber Society Concert
## 
### Katherine Capell 
Amazing power, the skill and clear
ness of Cortot, and something of her
own delightful personality, permeated
Ethel Leginska's playing the joint con
cert with the Chamber Music Society
of San Francisco last evening.
Despite calls after her solo numbers,
Leginska refused however to break
the custom of "no encores" in a Cham
ber Music concert.
In the ensemble numbers, Leginska
showed her genius as a true artist in
a perfect subordination to the other
musicians. Beautiful tones and fine
rvtlim marked the group numbers, in
which no one of the artists was pre
dominant.
Weber's Trio, Op. 63, G minor, given
by Leginska at the piano, with Hecht.,
fluitiKt, and Perner, 'cellist, was played
with a lovely delicacy and feeling.
The 'cello tones were particularly fine
in the first movement, while the flute
predominated in the Andante ex
pressivo. The Scherzo (allegro vivace)

movement was one of the most attrac
tive of the ensemble offerings.
Beethoven's Rondo a Capriccio, first
of Leginska's solo numbers, was ren
dered with a power astounding in so
small and feminine a musician. As she
played, half crouched over the key
board, she seemed to infuse her whole
personality into the composition.
Chopin's familiar Etude in A minor,
played with remarkable technique,
carried with it a totally new impres
sion—something that had never been
heard before.
Nandor Zsolt's Quintet B flat minor
was a combination of piano and quar
tet of strings—Persinger and Ford,
violins; Firestone, viola, and Ferner,
'cello. The beautiful melodies of the
Adagio maestosto movement were
played with vigor and color, while
velvety tones and exquisite harmonies
characterized the second movement.
The Scherzo was given with a de
lightful spontaneity.
