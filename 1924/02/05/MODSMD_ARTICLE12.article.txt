# Shylock Battles Antonio In Great Laundry Warfare
## 
### 
Antonio and Shylock, waging a ter
rific warfare over the rights to the
laundry monopoly of Venice, are the
leading comedians in the newest of
fei ing of Ram's Head Society, which
will hold the boards at the Assembly
hall on February 15.
The writers of the play, which is as
yet unnamed, go back to old reliable
Shakespeare, and bring to light some
of the hidden history of the characters
of "The Merchant of Venice."
Cuthbert Tibbe, as Shylock, and
Irving Anschutz in the part of An
tonio, fight a stirring battle for the
possession of the laundry business of
the biggest man in Venice, who is the
Duke of Minter. Chester Gunther
makes a sturdy duke, and his natural
Irish accent helps make him a striking
Italian.
Shylock has for long been given the
contract for the Duke's laundry, but
fails to send it back regularly and
intact, even as modern laundrys do
today.
Because of this, Antonio seizes his
opportunity and strikes while the laun
dry is dirty, in an effort to undermine
the influence of Shylock. Shylock
clings to sacred rights as "Washer to
the Duke," and the struggle between
him and Antonio, and its outcome, fur
nish the most hilarious scenes of the
play.
The acting in the Ram's Head play
is by far superior to that which has
been exhibited in any of their past
performances. The dancing, even at
this early stage, shows the hand of
an experienced director.
