### 
Poloists of the University of Ari*
j zona R. O. T. C. unit will not play
1 the Stanford varsity squad this spring.
The Arizona team, which recently
j captured the intercollegiate champion
ship of the Southwest, has refused to
1 accept the challenge recently made by
Stanford, according to a statement
made yesterday by Captain Charles E.
Boyle, Cardinal polo coach.
The southern team is unable to
make the trip to Stanford in view of
'< the fact that the squad has already
| spent considerable time away from
; home during the first, jMtyt of the sea
' son. It played at the intercollegiate
, tournament held at Sail Antonio dur
j ing the Christmas holidays. The All
| zona horsemen are also planning an
j East-West game with some represent
ative college of the *East. The team
and date have not yet been selected,
but it is expected that tlve game will
be played at the time when the Stan
ford team had planned to meet Ari
zona.
Captain Boyle expected to have a
tournament with the champions of the
Southwest at Stanford during tlie
Spring vacation. The Cardinals already
hold the championship of the Pacific
j Coast and hoped to capture the Ari
zona title, giving them the intercolle
giate championship of the West.
Word from Arizona states that it
might be possible to have a tourna
ment following the close of school in
June, but Captain Boyle feels that
this would be impossible. The varsity
poloists are disappointed in view of
the fact that last year the Cards trav
i eled to Tucson for a tournament and
expected that Arizona would come to
Stanford for a return gttme this year.
