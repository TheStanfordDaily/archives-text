# GORDON DAVIS TO TRAVEL THROUGH EAST FOR STUDY
## Spring Trip Will Precede Dramatic Plans for Summer Quarter 
### 
After traveling for three months
through the East during the spring
quarter and studying in New York
and some of the large universities,
Gordon Davis will return to the cam
pus to present three or four ambi
tious Assembly hall plays in the sum
mer quarter.
"My trip." says Davis, Ms going to
be one of absorption. I am going out
looking for ideas. While traveling
through the East I plan to see some
of the late Broadway plays and if
opportunity permits, may do a little
first-hand work myself. I am also ex
pecting to visit Harvard. Yale, Prince
ton, and Columbia, to study their dra
matic productions so that I may bring
back to Stanford some of the latest
ideas in theatre work."
Davis Lays Plans
Davis is particularly anxious to have
any people who are interested in dra
matic work, whether acting or tech
nical, to get in touch with him if tbev
expect to be here in the summer quar
ter.
Drawing away from the "box-office"
play, Davis will endeavor to present
something more in the artistic line.
He expects to present at least three
or four big productions during the
quarter, several of which will be for
eign plays.
Loose Organization
The productions are to be kept only
under p loosn organization as the plays
themselves will not be given under
the auspices of any definite society.
The players may be chosen from any
where; students, faculty members,
graduates, or residents of Palo Alto,
will be eligible. Already many well
known campus players have signified
their intention of being here in the
summer quarter as Davis is also con
templating an extensive Theatre
Workshop course.
Interest in Plays
This Theatre Workshop course will
have a two-fold interest as there are
many graduate students and teachers
directing high school and college pro
ductions who will welcome the possi
bility of practical stage direction
work; and the people of Palo Alto are
expected to back the play of the sum
mer months.
Of the plays to be given here in the
spring quarter only one, the Senior
Farce, would come under Davis' super
vision. In all probability this play will
be directed either by a student or by
some outsider recommended by Davis.

The productions are to be kept only
under p loosn organization as the plays
themselves will not be given under
the auspices of any definite society.
The players may be chosen from any
where; students, faculty members,
graduates, or residents of Palo Alto,
will be eligible. Already many well
known campus players have signified
their intention of being here in the
summer quarter as Davis is also con
templating an extensive Theatre
Workshop course.
Interest in Plays
This Theatre Workshop course will
have a two-fold interest as there are
many graduate students and teachers
directing high school and college pro
ductions who will welcome the possi
bility of practical stage direction
work; and the people of Palo Alto are
expected to back the play of the sum
mer months.
Of the plays to be given here in the
spring quarter only one, the Senior
Farce, would come under Davis' super
vision. In all probability this play will
be directed either by a student or by
some outsider recommended by Davis.
