# ANOTHER EDITOR
## 
### 
Don Liebendorfer lias been elected editor of the Daily Palo Alto on
what amounts to a white ballot ; over two-thirds of the staff of the Daily,
in balloting this afternoon, chose Liebendorfer to be their chief for the
next four months.
A glance at the names listed on the editorial staff makes it clear that
this could not have been possible had peanut politics, formerly so notice
able in the inner workings of the student newspaper, played any part in
the election this afternoon.
The testimony of the staff given today is ample proof of Liebendorfer's
capabilities and makes it almost unnecessary to state here that the Daily
will have, in Don Liebendorfer, an editor of sound judgment, able to carry
on a fearless editorial policy. His work since he came on the Daily, two
years ago, until he reached his present position of managing editor, has
been a successive record of hard jobs well done.

STANFORD STUDENTS will meet the San Francisco police force
in a new role tomorrow afternoon; the "cops" will play the varsity base
hall nine in what promises to he a real clubbing match. The San Francisco
police department has always been friendly to Stanford athletics, Chief
O'Brien having put himself out several times to assist Graduate Manager
Paul Davis. The campus is therefore thankful of this opportunity to wel
come the bluecoats' team to the Farm.

DRAMATIC REVIEWS in the Daily Palo Alto, unless otherwise
signed, are written by Allan Charles, in charge of the drama department
of the Daily.

American markets will handle about
seventy million pounds of silk this
year. Nearly one-half of this will be
artificial silk.
