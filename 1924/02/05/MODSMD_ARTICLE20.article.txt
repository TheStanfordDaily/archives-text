# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
I To the Editor of the Daily Palo Alto;
Dear Sir:
What a terrible thing it is to dis
cover that we have a bad boy in the
family—and that the "unshaven and
' unwashed rough" walked right into
the sacred circle of our amateur dra
matics and howled. My, how it must
have hurt our feelings.
And to think that since our Univer
sity was founded we have taught and
encouraged him to show the "he-man"
qualities by wearing cords (and dirty
ones at that) to be democratic, and
he turns out boisterous. Shame on
him!
Of course we don't defend his ac
tions. He is a nuisance, but —such a
frank outburst as you make against
the "unwashed" surely must lead you
to remark on the intellectuals in the
"highbrow" section; those who came
late to performances; interfere with
the action; tread on other people's
feet, or slap them in the face with
their wraps when crowding into their
seats; annoy the audience and artists
with their continuous flow of conver
sation or in bobbing about in their
chairs; or cause one to become sick-1
ened by the high odor from their coat- j
ing of powder, or from toilet solu
tions, or from chewing gum that they!
use to clean their teeth in public.
Of course, with the intellectuals j
this is not ill-mannered —just a con
tinuation of Elizabethan customs,
such as eating meat from your hands
and throwing the bones under the
table —and therefore should be coun
tenanced.
—One Sometimes Unwashed.;
