"I don't see that you can go many miles on a gallon of home tea, but I'm
glad you asked me, anyway. First the correct costume is necessary. Wear
your radiator cap, and, if the weather is wet, your mudguards. Clutch your
handle carefully and handle your clutch with care also. Keep your eye on
the road. If you should happen to one-man-top your drive, never mind.
Don't get cranky, juet crank 'er up again. But be careful not to fly off the
handle, for it'o hard to drive out of the top of a tree. Take care lest you
drive into a speed trap, and don't try to go up Bunker Hill on high. The
stream line body of your Flivver will take care of the water hazards. Address
what you're driving something like this, 'Now you pretty little Swiss stem
winder, I am about to smack you on your tail light and I want to see you
make this next hole without a tire change. And when you get on yon green,
I want to hear your motor go "Put —putt—putt!" The shock absorbers will
take care of the swearing."
