### 
Neither the California State Auto
mobile Association nor the division of
Motor Vehicles is engaged in taking
an automobile census in any part of
the state, according to an announce
ment made yesterday by D. E. Wat
kins, secretary-manager of the Auto
mobile Club.
Watkins said his announcement was
made as the result of information that
a house-to-house canvass of automo
bile owners was being made in sev
eral Northern and Central California
communities by individuals who repre
sented themselves as seeking this in
formation for the Automobile Associa
tion and the Division of Motor Vehi
cles.
"Representations made by any par
ties that they are taking an automo
bile census for the Automobile Club
are false," Watkins said yesterday. "I
have been authorized to make the
same statement in behalf of the Divi
sion of Motor Vehicles.
"This is evidently a scheme to se
cure sales prospects and would be
legitimate enough in itself if properly
represented. However several in
stances have been called to our at
tention where it was represented that
the information was wanted by the
Automobile Association or the Division
of Motor Vehicles. Any such repre
sentations are entirely without founda
tion of truth."
