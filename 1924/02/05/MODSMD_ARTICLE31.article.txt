## 
### 
Gasoline prices took another two
cent jump throughout California to
day. This raises the Santa Clara coun
ty retail price to 20 cents, including
the two-cent state tax. However, cam
pus gas hounds may still beat the
game and pay only 19 cents for their
fuel at the University oil station next
to the fire house.
A marked decrease in oil produc
tion in the state was the reason as
signed for the advance. In the month
of January there was a drop of over
1,000,000 barrels below the total out
put for December. Today's price jump
is the second 2-cent increase since the
first of the year.
