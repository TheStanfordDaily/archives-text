## 
### 
Improvement of the Branner Goo
logy Library as a permanent memor
ial to the second president of the Uni-|
versity is the aim of the recently i
organized Branner memorial associa
tion. Members of the geology and
mining departments compose the new
organization.
Dr. Branner founded the library
when he first came to Stanford, and j
devoted a great deal of time and !
energy as well as a large part of his
personal fortune towards establishing
it.
The University has promised to
furnish a full-time librarian as soon
as funds are available. A number of
Palo Alto engineers have promised
private libraries to the memorial
association, and several mining com
panies have agreed to furnish their
financial reports.
Approximately 10,000 volu m e s
greatly overload the present struct
ure. Plans of the association include
the erection of a library between the
geology and mining buildings some
time in the future as a part of the new
quad. It will be directly across the
street from the present geology
building.
Definite promises of money have
been received. All money raised will
be devoted to the enlargement of the
library.
All undergraduates are eligible for
associate membership in the associa
tion, full membership to be acquired
