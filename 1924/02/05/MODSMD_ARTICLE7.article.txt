# STRENUOUS WEEK BOOKED FOR BABE BASKETBALL TEAM
## Piedmont, Livermore, and Willits Will Try to Defeat Freshmen 
### Wallace Knox 
With nine scalps safely tucked away
the freshman hoop squad is getting
in some good licks preparing for the
hardest week of the season.
Wednesday, Piedmont high will try
to stop the undefeated yearlings. Two
days later, on Friday. Willits high will
come to the "Farm" with a similar
purpose in view, and Saturday eve
ning, as a preliminary to the first var
sity-California game, the Babes will
take on the Livermomre high quintet
These three teams are conceded to,
be the fastest high school aggrega- 1
tions in this part of the state. They ,
have all had successful seasons, and
they all have the idea that they can
defeat the freshmen, so some close,:
scrappy games are bound to result.
Over-Confidence Feared
The freshmen have been going at '
a great clip all season, but Coach
"Husky" Hunt is beginning to worry j
about over-confidence now. This over- |
confidence is bad stuff, because it can ;
wreck a team faster than anything i
else. From this consideration it would
be a good thing for the Babes to be
handed a setback in one of the games j
just preceding the California series, j
to take what little over-confidence,
there is out of the yearlings. How
ever. the attitude of the team has been I
good to date, according to Hunt, and
it may be the Babes can weather this j
danger without having to meet a de
feat.
