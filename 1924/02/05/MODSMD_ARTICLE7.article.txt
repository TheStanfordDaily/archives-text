# STRENUOUS WEEK BOOKED FOR BABE BASKETBALL TEAM
## Piedmont, Livermore, and Willits Will Try to Defeat Freshmen 
### Wallace Knox 
With nine scalps safely tucked away
the freshman hoop squad is getting
in some good licks preparing for the
hardest week of the season.
Wednesday, Piedmont high will try
to stop the undefeated yearlings. Two
days later, on Friday. Willits high will
come to the "Farm" with a similar
purpose in view, and Saturday eve
ning, as a preliminary to the first var
sity-California game, the Babes will
take on the Livermomre high quintet
These three teams are conceded to,
be the fastest high school aggrega- 1
tions in this part of the state. They ,
have all had successful seasons, and
they all have the idea that they can
defeat the freshmen, so some close,:
scrappy games are bound to result.
Over-Confidence Feared
The freshmen have been going at '
a great clip all season, but Coach
"Husky" Hunt is beginning to worry j
about over-confidence now. This over- |
confidence is bad stuff, because it can ;
wreck a team faster than anything i
else. From this consideration it would
be a good thing for the Babes to be
handed a setback in one of the games j
just preceding the California series, j
to take what little over-confidence,
there is out of the yearlings. How
ever. the attitude of the team has been I
good to date, according to Hunt, and
it may be the Babes can weather this j
danger without having to meet a de
feat.
Colds Keep Men Out
Shipkey and Anderson were unable |
to practice yesterday afternoon be
cause of bad colds. Neither of them
are seriously ill, but their injuries
come at an inopportune time, because
it will be hard for the Babes to get
through three games in a row without
their assistance.
All of the substitutes will be given
an opportunity to play this week, as
Hunt is trying to save the regulars so
that they will be in good condition to
go against California. The first game
with the Bruin Cubs will take place
next Wednesday at the Oakland audi
torium. The second game of this series
will be a week later, 011 February 20,
at Stanford.
So far there has been little oppor
tunity to get any comparative dope
concerning the two freshman aggre
gations. Berkeley high was supposed
to have defeated the Blue and Gold
five by a 21 to 20 score recently.
When the Berkeley players were here
Saturday they said that the California
team they defeated was composed of
substitutes, which makes it impossible
to use that game as a test.
The freshmen completely outclassed
Berkeley and won by a 23 to 7 score.
David, Price, and Jayred did most of
the Stanford scoring, making 22 of
the 23 points. When Hunt put in his
second string of players Berkeley held
them to an even score. This means
that the California and Stanford
freshman reserves are on a par, but
it does little to settle the question as
to which school has the best first
first team. *
