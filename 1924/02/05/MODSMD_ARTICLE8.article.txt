# CITY POLICE NINE TO CLASH WITH CARD TOSSERS TOMORROW
## Stanford Ball Aggregation Will Attempt to Keep Up Victory Record 
### 
The Stanford campus will 6e well
guarded tomorrow afternoon when
the San Francisco nine starts on the
trail of the Card baseball team on the
varsity field at 3.30.
Although the crook coopers have a
reputed strong aggregation, Harry
Wolter, Stanford ball coach, confident
ly expects the varsity to keep on the
victory side of the column.
The Stanford team is slowly emerg
ing from the dubious outlook which
usually comes at the first of the
baseball season. Strength, both in the
hitting and fielding departments, is
one of the fixed assets, but the pitch
ing department is one of the glittering
jewels in the athletic case.
Two victories and one defeat is the
record of the Stanford ball tossers
to date. The batting averages far out
ditance the strike out records, and the
erors made by the squad are keeping
well in the foggy background of the
game.
Wolter has made few substitutions
on the team to date aside from the
pitchers, and the line-up tomorrow
will probably be the same as in the
Olympic Club game with Lawson be
hind the plate, Woodward on first,
Robefts oil second, Mulehay on short,
Cuddeback, third base, and Johnston,
Fuller, and McCandless in the out
field.
