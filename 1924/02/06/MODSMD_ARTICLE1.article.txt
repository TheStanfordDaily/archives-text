# POWELL FAVORS LEARNING FACTS IN CONSTITUTION
## Speaker States Compulsory Study Wrong, Ideals Over-Emphasized 
### 
In his talk on the Constitution last
evening. Professor Thomas Reed Powell
expressed his disapproval of the new
school law, requiring the study of that
document in the public schools. He con
tended that the leaders of this movement
were trying to teach the young fairy tales
and build up a reverence around ideals,
not facts, which would lead to disillu
sionment later in life.
"1 hope the movement will in time turn
into a genuine education concerning the
actual situations with which the govern
ment has to deal," he said. "It would be
well, in the study of the government, to
(minimize the Constitution. Too much awe
for it is apt to take away the feelings of
independence and responsibility."
"The Constitution and Supreme Court
can't keep us from doing what we want
to do. The Party System shows this,
by the manner in which it gets around the
difficulties set up by the old Constitu
tional effort for separation of powers."
Professor Powell explained that the
writers of the Constitution could not be
â€¢expected to lay down in advance any
scheme to tell just what to do in every
situation. This is left in part to the
Supreme Court.
He quoted an old scholar of law, who
said, "They say the Holy Ghost presides
at the councils, when really it is the odd
man who is the Holy Ghost." This he
declares to be the methods of the Su
preme Court, denying that it attempts
to actually find the "will of the fathers."
"If the words of the Constitution were
clear there would be no occasion for
court interpretation," he added. "In the
early days it was recognized that the
purpose of the Supreme Court was to de
cide cases in the way it thought they
should be decided, and not thought, as
many do now, that the Constitution had
come from Mount Sinai, and all the
Court had to do was divine its meaning."
