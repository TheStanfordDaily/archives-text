El Toro in Close Contest
Both El Toro and Theta Xi entered ;
their contests undefeated. The teams
took some minutes to get started,
then Wright shot a goal for El Toro.

Theta Xi, and the battle was on. Theta
Xi took the offensive, but the only
man to connect with the basket was
Lawrence. Then Clifford made two
foul tries and a field goal for El Toro,
and the half ended in their favor, 6-4.

up five points, and was robbed of
