## 
### 
Oakland Tech high school, conquerors 1
of last year's freshman baseball team, i
will battle the Stanford yearlings on the
freshman diamond at 2:30 Saturday in
an effort to show up the college-beginners
for the second straight year.
Franz Osthaus pitched a passable game
last week and will probably get the call
against Tech. Contrary to the usual su
perstition, Osthaus is also one of the best
hitters on the squad.
Jerry Stewart, in left field against the j
San Mateo team last Saturday, accepted
several difficult chances and smacked out
a pair of clean hits.
The experience in last week's game j
proved to the Freshman squad tliat ball
games don't win themselves and that a
'ittle fight goes a long way. With that J
lesson learned and a week's hard prac- j
tice behind them, the Frosh should come
through with a win this Week,
Another tendency that has beeri
ironed out by Coach "Husky" Hunt, is j
that of taking the game as a joke, which i
was prevalent among the freshmen last
week.
