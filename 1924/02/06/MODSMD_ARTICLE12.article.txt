### Ray Spangler 
ATHLETIC trainers have much more to do besides administering rub-downs
and patching up injuries. The problem of keeping a team in condition has
a great deal to do with morale as well as physical fitness, according to
Trainer Wallace Denny, who has been at the game for twenty-five years.

"You have to know the individuality
of each man, what he wants, and what
he doesn't want. Some men you can
bawl out for all you're worth, and
they'll see red and go into the game
full of fight. Others take it as a per

never complain. As soon as they are
hurt, we rush them in and work them
into shape for the next game.

fight. If the players feel they're in the
game for the fun of it, not for hard

Team's Condition Important
"Sometimes the condition of a
team means losing or winning the
game. At the first of the week, they

have seen a team make that peak on
Friday, and be just a little on the
down grade for the game.
"When a player is really good, he
doesn't pay any attention to the au
