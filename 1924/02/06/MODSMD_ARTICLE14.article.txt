# PIEDMONT TEAM OF LONG SHOT EXPERTS WILL TACKLE BABES
## 
### 
The freshmen will tackle a tough oppo
nent tonight when thev-go against the
Piedmont high school basketball team at
| 8 o'clock in the pavilion. No preliminary
i is scheduled for this game.
Everyone on the campus who saw the
freshman-Piedmont fracas last year is
I looking forward to the contest tonight
| with more than ordinary interest. This is
because Piedmont and the 1926 aggrega
tion staged one of the fastest games seen
: in the pavilion during the year,
i Piedmont won by a score of 28 to 13,
i but the game was much faster than the
score would indicate. Practically all of
the Piedmont scores came from long
shots. Robie, at forward, made eight
shots from the middle of the floor.
High Arch on Shots
The entire Piedmont team seemed to
have the art of shooting down to the
"n'th" degree. The players arched their
shots almost to the ceiling and when the
ball came down it generally went through
the hoop without touching. Although
Robie has graduated, Piedmont still has
a few long shot artists, including a
younger member of the Robie family. It
will take a team that can score from the
middle of the floor to beat the freshman,
since the Babe defense is almost flawless.
Anderson and Joseph will probably
be unable to play tonight because of
colds. Shipkey has been on the sick list,
but he has sufficiently recovered to start
the game, he usual lineup will start,
namely, Price and David, forwards; Jay
red, center; and Shipkey and Newhouse,
guards.
As the freshmen have three games this
week, Coach "Husky" Hunt will try and
save the regulars as much as possible by
allowing the substitutes to play a good
portion of the game.
Nineteen Men on Squad
Hunt has a squad of nineteen men, all
of whom have shown marked ability.
Blazier, Riese, Hoffman, Soiithworth, and
McCormick are aspirants for the forward
positions. All of them are capable of

relieving Price and David without up
setting the work of the team. Riese and
Hoffman are the ones most likely to get
in the game.
With Anderson out of the game, it
will probably fall to the lot of Walker to
relieve Jay red at center. McCormick may
also be used at this position.
Hunt has half a dozen men who are
eager to take a try at the running guard
job. Williams is the best of the lot and
has seen the most service to date. How
ever, Clark, Holman, Taylor, and Dunfee
may be allowed to play.
Newhouse will have to do most of the
work at standing guard, for want of an
experienced man to replace him. Post is
about the only man on the squad who can
fill in at this position, now that Joseph
is out for a day or two.

but he has sufficiently recovered to start
the game, he usual lineup will start,
namely, Price and David, forwards; Jay
red, center; and Shipkey and Newhouse,
guards.
As the freshmen have three games this
week, Coach "Husky" Hunt will try and
save the regulars as much as possible by
allowing the substitutes to play a good
portion of the game.
Nineteen Men on Squad
Hunt has a squad of nineteen men, all
of whom have shown marked ability.
Blazier, Riese, Hoffman, Soiithworth, and
McCormick are aspirants for the forward
positions. All of them are capable of

relieving Price and David without up
setting the work of the team. Riese and
Hoffman are the ones most likely to get
in the game.
With Anderson out of the game, it
will probably fall to the lot of Walker to
relieve Jay red at center. McCormick may
also be used at this position.
Hunt has half a dozen men who are
eager to take a try at the running guard
job. Williams is the best of the lot and
has seen the most service to date. How
ever, Clark, Holman, Taylor, and Dunfee
may be allowed to play.
Newhouse will have to do most of the
work at standing guard, for want of an
experienced man to replace him. Post is
about the only man on the squad who can
fill in at this position, now that Joseph
is out for a day or two.
The freshmen will tackle a tough oppo
nent tonight when thev-go against the
Piedmont high school basketball team at
| 8 o'clock in the pavilion. No preliminary
i is scheduled for this game.
Everyone on the campus who saw the
freshman-Piedmont fracas last year is
I looking forward to the contest tonight
| with more than ordinary interest. This is
because Piedmont and the 1926 aggrega
tion staged one of the fastest games seen
: in the pavilion during the year,
i Piedmont won by a score of 28 to 13,
i but the game was much faster than the
score would indicate. Practically all of
the Piedmont scores came from long
shots. Robie, at forward, made eight
shots from the middle of the floor.
High Arch on Shots
The entire Piedmont team seemed to
have the art of shooting down to the
"n'th" degree. The players arched their
shots almost to the ceiling and when the
ball came down it generally went through
the hoop without touching. Although
Robie has graduated, Piedmont still has
a few long shot artists, including a
younger member of the Robie family. It
will take a team that can score from the
middle of the floor to beat the freshman,
since the Babe defense is almost flawless.
Anderson and Joseph will probably
be unable to play tonight because of
colds. Shipkey has been on the sick list,
but he has sufficiently recovered to start
the game, he usual lineup will start,
namely, Price and David, forwards; Jay
red, center; and Shipkey and Newhouse,
guards.
