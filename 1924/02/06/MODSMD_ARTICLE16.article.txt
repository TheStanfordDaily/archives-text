# BEAR-CARDINAL QUINTETS CLASH NEXT SATURDAY
## Comparative Scores Fail to Favor Either Bruins or Stanford 
### 
Beyond predicting a hot squabble,
the writer who ventured an opinion
on the first Stanford-California basket
ball series in the pavilion Saturday
evening would be taking a long
chance. California in the past has had
an unfortunate habit of taking most
of her defeats before tangling with
the Red, and the dependent Southern
Division title of the Conference will
have the same stimulating effect on
both teams.
Teams Look Even
As to the merits of the two squads,
there is nothing exceedingly favoring
one side or the other. Both teams
have split two contests with the Uni
versity of Southern California five,
and the results clearly indicate that
neither California nor Stanford has a
decisive edge in the coming series.
Last season the dope was all in
favor of the Cardinals. California had
gone through an erratic preliminary
season, while the Cards were sweep
ing their opponents before them in
every contest. Two gruelling games
with U. S. C. in the South were played
but a short time before the Bruin
series, and the Stanford five was in
no shape to give the Bears a hard
fight.
Bears Win 1923 Series
The first game of the series last
year went to the Bears, 26 to 23, a last
minute rally by the Cards failing to
check the advance of the Blue and
Gold quintet. Stanford came back in
the second contest, and by fighting
for every point, nosed out Berkeley
18 to 17, a foul goal by "Nip" McHose
in the last minute of play brekaing
the tie.
California had to win the two fol
lowing games of the series to tie
Stanford for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence title. Both contests were over
whelming victories for the Bears, the
first score being 30 to 20, and the sec
ond 33 to 17. Stanford withdrew from
the Conference race on the basis of
these victories.
Andy Kerr is devoting most of his
time to coaching his team so as to
break up the California offensive.
Since Johnny Talt is the Bear's most
consistent scorer, Kerr is also spend
ing time on methods to check the
flashy Bruin forward, which means
that the Stanford defense will possibly
be different, and centered more than
ever around Dave Oliva.
