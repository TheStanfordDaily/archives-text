APPRECIATION
Volume Sixty-four of the Daily Palo Alto goes to press for the last
time tomorrow.
Amid the dust and commotion of removing papers, old hats, and un
complimentary letters from the private sanctum of the editor, the present
administration calls to mind many people not on the regular staff who
have helped to enliven the columns of the Daily by contributing their time
and talent during the past four months.
Volume Sixty-four owes a debt of gratitude to Carl Shoup, who has
had charge of "Cabbages and Things Chester N. Hess, writer of "Under
the Sun" last quarter;" Henry Mack, who wrote "The Aisle Seat'' until
the first of the year; William F. Leiser, who has contributed many sports
stories; Ruth Mcßride. David Lamson, and Northcutt Ely, who have all
contributed courageously to the "Cabbages" column.
