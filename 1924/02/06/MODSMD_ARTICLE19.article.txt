# Sophomore Women Forced To Hold Picnic in Clubhouse
## 
### 
Rain intervened last night and to
day to prevent the picnic of the
sophomore women in Lagunita lake
bottom scheduled to take place this
noon. A fresh shower an hour before
the start of the food-fest reduced the
number of those attending to a mini
mum and forced a retirement to the
Women's Clubhouse where the pre
pared meal was served.
The untimely intervention of the
weather was an added barrier to the
complete success of the first program
arranged to permit sophomore women
to become better acquainted with
each other.
