# DANGER OF RACE WAR IN RAM'S HEAD SHOW
## 
### 
Race riots, Tong wars, and Swedish
battles may start among the actors
in the Ram's Head Society's newest'
play.
Only skillful diplomacy on the part
of the director of the show, has so far
prevented the representative of :
Sweden, Japan, and Jerusalem from j
quarreling among themselves.
Evert Young, who is gifted with a
Japanese accent so perfect that he
could demand a good job as a cook
in any household, has the part of
Eako Togowa. Whether or not Young
picked up his knowledge of Japanese
in the Sacramento valley is not
known,but at any rate laughs should
fall his way on the night of the per
formance.
Sweden's interpreter is Charles'
Simons, who, when interviewed as to
his part, said, "Well, Ay tank Ay ban
play purty good acting." In rehearsals,!
he lives up to his boast and with more
practice, will make his scenes among i
the best.
"Jack" Tibbe, with a natural profile j
and an acquired accent, makes a Shv
lock that would surprise Shake
speare. Added to his clever clowning
in the part, a pleasing voice gives
him an opportunity for stopping the
show.
