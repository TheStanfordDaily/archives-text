# GOPHERS RUIN PROSPECTS FOR WINTER CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Gophers have ruined the prospects of
a winter carnival at the University of
Idaho by preventing the flooding of the
big ice skating rink which was being
constructed under the supervision of
the university "I" men.
Three times the rink has been
flooded and each time the water has
run down the gopher holes. The en
gineers and chemists are going to form
a combine to outfox the gophers if pos
sible, in the hope that they will "die
inside" and so fill the holes, before the
spring thaw begins.

The pigmy camel belongs to a spe
cies found only in western Persia. It
is only five feet high and snow white.
