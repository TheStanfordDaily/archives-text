# Water Color Sketches of Japanese Quake on Exhibit
## 
### 
Thirty-three Japanese water color
sketches made by Kako Morita, a for
mer Stanford student, during the re
cent quake in Japan, are now on ex
hibition at the Stanford Art Gallery
through the courtesy of Dr. Jordan.
Morita is a graduate in art of the
Imperial University of Tokyo, and for
several years was connected with the
technical department of the univer
sity as a painter of animals.
"The scenes were sketched at the
time of the disaster," said John T.
Lemos, of the Art Gallery, "and are
very clever representations of the
earthquake locality. In many of them
there is the flat decorative touch typi
cal of Japanese painting."
The water colors have been sent
over to be sold for the relief of the
earthquake victims. They are moder
ately priced, and will be on sale over
the week-end.
