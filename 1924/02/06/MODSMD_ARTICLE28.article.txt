## Some 1924 Basketball Captains 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Now thai the college basketball season is in full swing, it will not be amiss
to look over some of the leaders of the cage squads in different parts of the
country.
"Nip" McHose of Stanford University is little, but how that boy can shoot
baskets! "Nip" also blushingly admits to contributing works of art to the
campus comic magazine. When the little forward is out of the game the
team usually slumps; when "Nip" returns to the fracas the change is phe
nomenal. Last year in the Southern section of the Pacific Coast conference,
Stanford tied California, mainly through the efforts of McHose.
"Hoxie" Haas, captain of the Yale five, hails from Marion, Ohio, so is well
qualified to be a leader of men. "Hoxie" was star guard on last year's
"miracle team," which rose up from the cellar to win the Eastern Inter
collegiate championship. He scored seventeen field goals last year in 351
minutes of play.
Campbell Dickson, of Chicago, was handicapped with a knee injury during
the first part of this season. Dickson is a speedy forward, an artful dodger,
and a trick dribbler. He is a scoring asset to his team, and scored forty-one
field goals in twelve games last year. Dickson is also end on the football
team and a star track man.
"Cap" Gibson of Wisconsin is the tall top-off man of "Doc" Meanwell's
quintette, and ranked as one of the four best centers in the western con
ference last year.
