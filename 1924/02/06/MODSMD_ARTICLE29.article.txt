# LINGUIST PROVES MYSTERY TO IMMIGRATION CHIEFTAIN
## 
### 
A young man of mystery who speaks
ten languages but no English, and who
admits deserting at New York from
the crew of "some steamer" is proving
a puzzle to Dr. P. L. Prentis, chief of
the local immigration department.
The young man is David Latorski, 25,
who was picked up by the police after
he had frightened a negro by deluging
him with a linguistic torrent.
