THE BAT
Curran Theatre, San Francisco
"The Bat," thrilling as ever, is
again presented at the Curran for two
weeks. As many of us know, it is one
of the most blood-curdling and spine
creeping mystery plays that have ever
made an audience sit up on edge and
long to denounce the murderer, shriek
at the heroine for staying alone in
the dark attic, or laugh hysterically
at the frightened maid.
The cast this year is extremely
good. The work of Lizzie Evans as
Miss Van Gorier is excellent. Jo
sephine Morse as Lizzie, the terrified
maid, always blundering into the Bat,
and forever certain she was going to
wake up with her throat cut, gives
an exceedingly funny bit of comedy.
Frederick Conklin as Dr. Wells does
some clever acting, as do Edward
Kearns, the mysterious stranger, Ben
Taggert, and Helen Redd.
The three acts are crammed full of
thrills and excitement, and the big
gest surprise comes just as the cur
tain is going down. —M. A. C.
