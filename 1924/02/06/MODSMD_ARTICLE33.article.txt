# Medieval Romance Is Basic Theme of 1924 Partheneia
## 
### 
The 1924 Parthenia at the Univer
sity of California will turn to the
realms of faerie and romance of the
Middle Ages for its theme. The pa
geant, "The Merrie Masque of May,"
will be presented by* the women stu
dents of the University some time in
April.
Following the annual cuslcm the
pageant will be symbolical and will
depend for its effect on the use of
exotic color schemes in costuming and
picturesque dance groups. The theme
holds quite different aspects from
those of its predecessors.

It takes the beech tree about 200
years to become 18 inches around.
