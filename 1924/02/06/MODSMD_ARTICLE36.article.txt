# NO. 2. THE LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
OERVING as a chapel, assembly hall, and classroom, the Little Theatre was
twenty years ago the center of University life. At that time the building
was known as the Chapel, the Memorial Church not being finished until 1903.
When the University opened in 1891, only the Inner Quadrangle with the
exception of the Memorial Church, was completed. The present Assembly'

hall, Memorial Arch, and the Admin- 1 *
istration building, which was then
used as a library, were completed in
1899.
Little Theatre Once a Chapel
With its little organ, small platform,
and rows of folding chairs, the interior
aspect of the Little Theatre was de
cidedly different from that of today.
The primary use of the building was
that of a church, both morning and
evening services being held there.
Sunday speakers from San Francisco
and elsewhere were secured by a fac
ulty committee. The organ was of the
old-fashioned pumping type, many a
student earning his spending money
by wearily working the instrument.
On the platform, there were three
large chairs padded with red plush.
The floor of the room was level and
covered with rows of folding chairs,
on the backs of which were wire racks
for hymn books and Bibles. On the
1
further side of the room was a space
for the large choir of voluntary stu
dents. A small vestry room was lo
cated near the entrance door.
Pictures on Walls
As a chapel, the walls of the room
were decorated with religious pic
tures. Among these was the "Descent
from the Cross," by Benjamin West,
a noted American artist. This paint
ing was hung in a dark corner of the
room and remained practically un
noticed until it was moved to the
Museum, where it was placed in an
advantageous position and the light
revealed hidden beauties in the work.
In the minds of many graduates, the
Little Theatre is intimately associated
with memories of Dr. Jordan, for
there he conducted his large class in
evolution. At that time, such a course
was a startling innovation and was the
subject of much discussion and no
little criticism.
Also Place for Lectures
On Tuesday nights, the building was
packed for the regular Tuesday eve
ning lecture. These lectures were ex
tremely popular during the first years
of the University. They later dwin
dled and disappeared, being revived
by President Wilbur. Many illustrious
people have spoken in the Little
Theatre. William Jennings Bryan ad
dressed a large meeting there.
The name of "Little Theatre" was
not given the building until it was
remodeled twelve years ago. It was
then used considerably for public
speaking, a course which rapidly de
veloped under the guidance of Profes
sor Emerson Bassett. Lesser dramatic
productions were staged in the room,
all big student plays being given in
the men's old, frame gymnasium.
