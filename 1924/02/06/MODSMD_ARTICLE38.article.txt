# AMERICAN COLLEGE LIFE DISTRACTED BY ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
"It seems to me that American col
lege life is to a terrible extent a dis
tracted life," says H-erbert Gray, the
Scotch minister. "Your boys and girls
dissipate their intense vitality by
touching lightly a multitude of things.
The name of your college activities
is legion. Your students don't work
too hard, but they put in some work
at too many things."
