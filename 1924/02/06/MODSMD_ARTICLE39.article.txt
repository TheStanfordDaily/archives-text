# "College Humor" Waxes Enthusiastic On Chappie's Chief
## 
### 
Last mouth the Pennsylvania Punch
Bowl waxed enthusiastic over Chapar
ral. This month it is "College Humor,"
a well-known Chicago publication,
which looks on the doings of the
Chappies with favor. In the first in
stallment of a series called "The Men
Who Make Our Comics," the first il
lustration is a photograph of "Mike"
Ely, Chaparral's editor, and accom
panying it is the following informa
tion, gathered by fair means or foul:
Clean College Comic
"Stanford University is fortunate
in having such a sane-minded man as
Northcutt Ely to edit her "Chaparral."
He is attempting to do a thing which
many people believe impossible: run
a college comic with clean jokes. The
office boy gives us the following his
tory of this remarkable gentleman:
" 'As an editor, Ely is more or less
of a disappointment. During the last
year he has only put out one issue
a month of the Chaparral, won first
place with his magazine in Judge's
College Wits Contest, and their cup
for the best literary contribution."
"'ln speaking of the Chaparral, Ely
modestly said, "Cornell has the best
college comic in the country . . . we
mail it to them every month, so that
they won't miss it".'
Owes Ely Everything
'"Ely's ideas of a college comic do
not accord with those men who be
lieve that if a joke has a clean mean
ing, however obscure, it should be run.
His pages do not drip salacious drivel
liberally spattered with profanity, and
his stand has been recognized by stu
dents, with the result that Chaparral
is more appreciated than ever.
" 'In short, Chaparral owes every
thing to Ely . . . except, the business
manager has just reminded me, one
or two bills outstanding in San Fran
cisco'!"
