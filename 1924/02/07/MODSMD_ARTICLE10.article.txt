# ENGINEERS UNDER APPRENTICE SYSTEM, SAYS E. E. McCANN
## 
### 
The engineering profession today
takes the place of the old apprentice
system of the middle ages; the en
gineering graduate has to go through
from five to ten years of hard trial
before he can start to branch out for
himself, just as the apprentice had to
do under the guild system.
This is what E. E. McCann, '10, per
sonirell manager of the Pacific Gas &
Electric Company, told engineering
students yesterday atfernoon in the
Little Theatre when he was talking on
opportunities in public utilities work.
"Positions on the •engineering staff
of a public utility or industrial cor
poration of any kind require an ex
tensive knowledge of that particular
company's equipment which it takes
years to gain, and as a rule only men
who are particularly good in technical
lines are eligible.
"Rut, owing to the fact that every
one in public utility work, from the
president of the company to the sales
men, has engineer's training, there is
an almost unlimited field for every
type of engineer.
"In the contract and operating de
partments, supervision, and ability to
master detail are the main things.
The usual engineer's greatest trouble
is not knowing how to express him
self clearly, and it is essential that
he must learn.
"A man's attitude twoards his work
means as much .as his technical
knowledge, and a good personality and
ability to get along with people make
up the greatest part of his chances for
success."
