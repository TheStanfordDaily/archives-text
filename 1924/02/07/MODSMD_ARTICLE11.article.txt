## 
### 
Two robberies were committed on
the campus between the hours of 6
and 7 last night.

by the I>elta Upsilon house, was the
heaviest loser, and Ernest Daugherty,
employed by Beta Theta Pi in a simi

thief, or thieves.
From Mori's house in the rear of the j
Delta Upsilon fraternity, a suit of
clothes, $85 in cash, and a check for
$75 was taken.
Daugherty lost an overcoat as a re
sult of the evening visit.
The door to Mori's house had been 1
left unlocked, and entrance was
gained while he was preparing dinner
in the D. IT. kitchen.
A window in the Beta cook-shack
was broken by the marauder, who
crawled through and helped himself
to the overcoat. He was apparently
frightened away before finishing hisJ
raid, as several articles of clothing'
were found just inside the window,
where the robber had evidently drop
ped them in his haste to escape.
Details of the affair have been
turned over to the Palo Alto police'
department.
