### 
Chaparral for March will be edited
by women. j
Theta Sigma Phi, national women's
journalism fraternity, which was in
vited recently by Hammer and Coffin
to take over the next issue, has ac
cepted with pleasure, and is now
working on the magazine.
Spring Fever, which is said to at
tack the Old Boy about the time of
March hares and final examinations,
will be the theme of the issue.
Vigorous denial that spring fever is
the cause of Chappie's courtesy was
given by Northcutt Ely, editor, in
making the offer. Hammer and Coffin,
says Ely. will be very busy about that
time bringing home another humor
cup in the Judge College Wits contest,
entries for which close in March.
The spring fever dryad shown gaz
ing drowsily at the havoc wrought by
a March hare, has been chosen for the
cover of the Theta Sigma Phi issue.
The deadline for copy for this issue
has been set at February 15.
"Feminine Fling" Artists Obtained
Two years ago the same organiza
tion published the "Feminine Fling"
as the March iesue, and the same
feminine artists have been obtained to
do the drawings for the "Spring
Fever" number.
Jester plus Chappie will put out the
February issue, which is now on the
press. Jester, Columbia's comic, will
alternate in literary work. Salesmen
will be on the Quad with the Chapar
ral-Jester early next week.
Midnight, February 20, has been
proclaimed the deadline for copy to
be turned in to Chaparral for forward
ing to Judge in the College Wits Con
test.
The Old Boy, in an interview today,
announced it as his aim to equal the
Jester and the Cornell Widow in hav
ing two legs on the cup. The cup is a
three-legged affair, and one more vic
tory for either of the two Eastern
magazines makes it their permanent
property.
