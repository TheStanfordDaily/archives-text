# WEIGHT FIVE MEETS SAN MATEO JUNIOR COLLEGE TOMORROW
## 
### 
San Mateo junior college vs. Stan
ford's 145-pound basketball team will
furnish the preliminary for the fresh
man-Willits game tomorrow night in
the pavilion.
This will be the last game for the
145's before the California series. So
far they have lost, two contests, and
won on-e.
Last week, against the Palo Alto
high school unlimited team, the light
heavyweights played poor basketball,
losing 25 to 18. The team lacks an
offensive attack, and there are no
"sure-shots" on the squad.
Cornell, the only veteran from last
year's team, has failed to show any*
outstanding ability at forward. Neer
plays an aggressive game, but seldom
gets the hall through the hoop.
Stewart at center plays a slow game
and is somewhat of a stranger in the
point column.
Mangin is holding down the berth
at running guard, but his attempts at
field goals are few and far between.
â€¢Lund handles the other guard posi
tion well, but is often caught in front
of the opposing forwards when they
go in for the basket.
