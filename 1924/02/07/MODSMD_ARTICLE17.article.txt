# THE 						PEANUT-WAGON WHISTLE
## 
### 
Nominations are now open for two men to serve on the Executive
Committee, one man for the Board of Athletic Control, two men for the
Union Board of Governors, and all class officers.
Nominations will close tomorrow.
On Tuesday the election will take place.
* * *
Meanwhile, highly important caucuses are being held; cigars are
passed around; candidates are chosen and argued into running "for the
good of the party." The smell of politics is beginning to offend the nos
trils of the campus.
In the past, the Daily Palo Alto has advocated, as strongly as possible
from its position as a non-partisan organ, that candidates be elected lie
cause of their ability to hold the office, NOT because of living group asso
ciations.
Whereupon the campus politicians have unsheathed their cigars and
hot air guns as follows:
"Say, you're a friend of mine. 1 want you to vote for McGump."
"Why?"
"Now look here. I'm not trying to work any politics, and I'll leave it
up to your judgment. But I KNOW McGump; and I want to see him
elected, not because he's a member of our group, y'understand—nothing
like that —simply because he's the best man for the job. Now you're a
friend of mine—"
"But why is he the better man? Why is he better than Skate?"
"Why? Well, aw— looka here: he's a member of our group, isn't he?
Well, that makes him the best man, doesn't it?"
"Oh!"
* * *
And so it goes. The candidate promoted is always the best man for the
job; very rarely for any other named reason than because he lives on the
Row, or li a the Hall.
* * *
Politics * Stanford campus has always been tainted by this silly,
useless demo. on of living group animosity. In some activities, and
some few timt 1 1 activities, there has been none of this political odor.
But it is he. 1 as far as we can see, it is here to stay. That is, it
will be here unti. rundamental cause of its presence is removed.
That cause is simply this: exclusive clannishness 011 one hand, and
the natural resentful reaction on the other.
There you have it, without any lace frills. The Row thinks the Hall
is trying to run politics; the Hall thinks the Row is trying to run every
thing.
It is simply a case of mutual misunderstanding, which the parties
themselves do not want to remedy. That is the cause of the biennial odor
of faction politics on the campus, and it will remain so until this cause is
4 removed, by removing the distance between the two living groups.
* * *
The writer of this editorial is now going to take the risk of being de
clared in cahoots with the faculty. He is going to come out openly and
express himself in favor of the idea now filed among the plans for future
living groups.
That plan is to have the fraternities on the campus all living in Halls,
in close proximity to the Halls occupied by non-fraternity members.
When this idea was first broached, the writer was among the loudest to
boo resentl fully at the change.
Since then he has reached this conclusion: that until the cause of the
political group battles is removed, by removing the "exclusiveness" evil of
fraternities, which, rightly or wrongly, non-fraternity men resent, there
can be no permanent clearing of the political horizon.
When fraternities, eating clubs, and non-organization men are housed
in the same dormitory group, under the same conditions, meeting on the
same paths to the Quad, the silly struggle will cease, for the animosity
will have died.
Then, perhaps, all student body officials will be chosen regardless of
party ticket.
* ♦ ♦
Until that time comes, it is the difficult task of those people who do not
follow the peanut-wagon whistle of that pie-eyed piper, Group Politics, to
see that as many men as possible are elected to student body offices be
cause of qualification, not affiliation.
Nominations are now open for two men to serve on the Executive

Union Board of Governors, and all class officers.

Whereupon the campus politicians have unsheathed their cigars and
hot air guns as follows:
"Say, you're a friend of mine. 1 want you to vote for McGump."
"Why?"
"Now look here. I'm not trying to work any politics, and I'll leave it
up to your judgment. But I KNOW McGump; and I want to see him
elected, not because he's a member of our group, y'understand—nothing
like that —simply because he's the best man for the job. Now you're a
friend of mine—"
"But why is he the better man? Why is he better than Skate?"
"Why? Well, aw— looka here: he's a member of our group, isn't he?
Well, that makes him the best man, doesn't it?"
"Oh!"
* * *
And so it goes. The candidate promoted is always the best man for the
job; very rarely for any other named reason than because he lives on the
Row, or li a the Hall.
* * *
Politics * Stanford campus has always been tainted by this silly,
useless demo. on of living group animosity. In some activities, and
some few timt 1 1 activities, there has been none of this political odor.
But it is he. 1 as far as we can see, it is here to stay. That is, it
will be here unti. rundamental cause of its presence is removed.
That cause is simply this: exclusive clannishness 011 one hand, and
the natural resentful reaction on the other.
There you have it, without any lace frills. The Row thinks the Hall
is trying to run politics; the Hall thinks the Row is trying to run every
thing.
It is simply a case of mutual misunderstanding, which the parties
themselves do not want to remedy. That is the cause of the biennial odor
of faction politics on the campus, and it will remain so until this cause is
4 removed, by removing the distance between the two living groups.
* * *
The writer of this editorial is now going to take the risk of being de
clared in cahoots with the faculty. He is going to come out openly and
express himself in favor of the idea now filed among the plans for future
living groups.
That plan is to have the fraternities on the campus all living in Halls,
in close proximity to the Halls occupied by non-fraternity members.
When this idea was first broached, the writer was among the loudest to
boo resentl fully at the change.
Since then he has reached this conclusion: that until the cause of the
political group battles is removed, by removing the "exclusiveness" evil of
fraternities, which, rightly or wrongly, non-fraternity men resent, there
can be no permanent clearing of the political horizon.
When fraternities, eating clubs, and non-organization men are housed
in the same dormitory group, under the same conditions, meeting on the
same paths to the Quad, the silly struggle will cease, for the animosity
will have died.
Then, perhaps, all student body officials will be chosen regardless of
party ticket.
* ♦ ♦
Until that time comes, it is the difficult task of those people who do not
follow the peanut-wagon whistle of that pie-eyed piper, Group Politics, to
see that as many men as possible are elected to student body offices be
cause of qualification, not affiliation.
Nominations are now open for two men to serve on the Executive
Committee, one man for the Board of Athletic Control, two men for the
Union Board of Governors, and all class officers.
Nominations will close tomorrow.
On Tuesday the election will take place.
* * *
Meanwhile, highly important caucuses are being held; cigars are
passed around; candidates are chosen and argued into running "for the
good of the party." The smell of politics is beginning to offend the nos
trils of the campus.
In the past, the Daily Palo Alto has advocated, as strongly as possible
from its position as a non-partisan organ, that candidates be elected lie
cause of their ability to hold the office, NOT because of living group asso
ciations.
