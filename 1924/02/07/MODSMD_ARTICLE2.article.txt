Looks like a damp day tomorrow
"whether the rain continues or not.
Down at Encina Pool, the four
classes will stage their yearly swim- j
ming meet, with the ibets on the
freshmen.
The seniors should furnish the stiff -
est individual competition with
Charles Fletcher and A1 White as
their star fish.
McAllister and Gibbons for the jun
iors and Wallace O'Connor and Allen
for the sophomores look like point
winners.
Lawrence Fletcher, brother of
Charles, will try to cancel the points
won by his brother in the breast
stroke, by taking the back stroke

should roll up additional counters for i
the first-year men.
