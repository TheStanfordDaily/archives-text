# NAME OF COMING RAM'S HEAD PLAY CAUSES RUCTION
## 
### 
"Mike" Ely is in bed with a mangled
necktie; "Hank" Mack is lying at
death's door; and Carl Shoup has six
teeth marks on his right calf, all on
account of one thing, the name for the
forthcoming Ram's Head Show.
After fighting on the postoffice steps j
for more than fifteen minutes the
three authors were finally dragged
apart and rushed to the hospital with
the rest of the poison oak victims.
However, rehearsals still go on and j
last night on the Assembly Hall stage 1
one of the most soul-rending scenes
ever tried out on the campus was put j
forth. A huge courtroom scene is seen
with Antonio, the defendant, and
Cuthbert Tibbe, as Shylock, the crafty
old Jew, fighting over "a pound of
flesh." When Chester Gunther, as the
old judge, calls for the verdict, a >
tense moment of suspense falls over
all. Only those who have been caught
speeding will understand.
Poor little Mary Miles Minter, so
ably portrayed by Louis Miller, has a!
dreadful time of it, weeping on every
body around, for she is Antonio's
lover. The verdict is read —but wait,
all is not over yet. Howard Wilson as
Portia puts forth a plea that would
bring tears to a rock. She is of no
avail, however, as Shylock does not
intend to hold the sack.
However, Portia finally hits upon a
scheme where by Antonio regains his
freedom, the laundry monopoly of
Venice, and his sweetheart all in one 1
stroke. j
Oh yes—the Ram's Head show has
been named. But each author has a
different name. An arbitration com
mittee is to be appointed Saturday
night.
