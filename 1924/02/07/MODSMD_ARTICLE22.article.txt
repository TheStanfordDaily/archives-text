### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
One summer night in 1922, young Charley Paddock, the prominent sprinter
and friend of the A. A. U., came home after an afternoon on the Pasadena golf
course so excited he could hardly eat his supper. Finally, Papa Paddock in
quired, "Well, what is it, Charles—another statement of yours misquoted by
the press?"
"No," fairly shouted the world's champion sprinter. "I shot a 77 today,
and I'm afraid the A. A. U. won't accept my record!"
Charley beat that, too, a year later, turning in a card of 73 at the Clifton
Springs course in New York state, although he admits the course was built
for invalids and cripples. He has played only three years and has already
won three cups.
To rur the 100 yards half a dozen times in 9 3-5 seconds is all very well,
but to win a tournament match by holing out a 300-yard brassie shot —that's
something to live for! Charles has done it. Long live Sir Charles!
