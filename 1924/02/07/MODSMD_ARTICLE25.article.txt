# Library, Physiology Department Join to Pull Cat From Well
## 
### 
"Me no go there, ket there, ket
there," shrieked Max, the Library's
Polish janitor, when Librarian G. T,
Clark suggested that he clean out the
light well next to the reserve book
room. And a display of battle-scarred
hands and face sent the Librarian
hastily to the depths of his domain.
There in the light well was the vic
tor of the recent battle, peaceably ab
! sorbing the sun. Clark called, "pussy,
, pussy," and was all for removing the
1 cat until she launched her attack. He
retired. Other attempts were made,
but pussy remained decidedly wild.
As a last resort the physiology de
partment was called. A representative
arrived; a recruit from the loan desk
. was enlisted. With arms and hands
padded, faces veiled, the two men en
j tered the arena. Kitty all but escaped
up the drain pipe into the document
j room. But, due to the supreme efforts
of two able-bodied men, the foot and
a half of grey fur was captured, caged,
and consigned to the Physiology de
partment for psycopathic treatment.
| Clark was tempted, but he didn't
j rage. "I hope the person who put her
in there enjoyed his joke," he said.
! "But let this be a warning"—and here
1 he voiced the sentiments of a certain
| professor of history—"He who puts
a cat into the well, shall, hereafter,
pull her out again."
