# WHEAT AND FLOUR PRICES STUDIED BY RESEARCH WORKERS
## Stanford Food Institute Will Give Figures on Crop Costs 
### 
World-wide statistics of wheat and
flour production and consumption and
their relation to prices, are being
studied as a part of the work of the
Stanford Food Research Institute, ac
cording to the annual report of that
bureau.
Alouzo E. Taylor, head of the Insti
tute, has just returned from several
conferences in the East with food
production experts.
Analyses of the world wheat posi
tion will be made available from time
ti, time when satisfactory statistical
methods and materials have been dis
closed.
Research work in crop estimating

and reporting methods in the United
States ana abroad is being carried on
with a view of determining the relia
bility of crop statistics and of improv
ing the accuracy of forecasts and re
ports of crops.
Accuracy in analyzing farm costs
is the object of study of statistics
furnished by the Kansas State Agri
cultural College. Other research work
carried on by the institute has shown
marked differences in starches of dif
ferent types of wheat.
Intensive studies of economic prob
lems of the commercial baking indus
try are being made with the counsel
and assistance of the American Bakers
Association.
Investigate Food Costs
Transportation of wheat and flour
in the United States as relat-ed to just
freight rates, and the food factors in
the cost of living are other important
phases of investigation.
In addition to studies carried on at
Stanford, the institute has given ad
vice to producers, distributors, and
consumers in th-e food industries on
the Pacific Coast. One of the insti
tute's directors is a member of a com
mittee of the Department of Com
merce appointed to study the export
of agricultural commodities. Assist
ance has been given by different mem
bers of the institute to the Bureau of
Census in gathering data for the cen
sus of flour manufacturers which will
be issued in 1925.
