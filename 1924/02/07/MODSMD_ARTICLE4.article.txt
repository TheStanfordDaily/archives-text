# FRESHMEN DEFEAT PIEDMONT BASKET TEAM BY 14 POINTS
## First Half Is Ragged, But Babes Show Speed in 3rd Quarter; Win 22-8 
### Wallace Knox 
Piedmont did not have much luck
with long shots last night and fell
before the superior teamwork of the
Stanford freshmen in a slow game,
the final score being 22 to 8.
The Piedmont quintet was expected
to give the Babes a hard fight, but
the team this year is much lighter
than last year, and as a result could
not last against the heavier freshmen.
David and Jayred led in the scoring,
each being responsible for four ba3-
kets. David is the most consistent shot
on the team, and always gets a good
percentage of his long shots.
During the first half the freshmen
had plenty of shots at the hoop, but
failed to get but two baskets, and
both of them were in the first quarter.
Robie and Corbin for Piedmont at
tempted a number of shots from the
middle of the floor but all of them
went wide;
Shipkey Scores First
Shipkey opened the scoring with a
long shot trom the side line soon after
the game started. Price scored from
the foul line, and David received a
pass from Price under the hoops.
This made the score 5 to 0 for the
Babes. During the rest of this quar
ter neither team could score, and
both sides missed frequent setups.
Riese started the game at center
but was replaced by Jayred soon after
the second quarter began. This change
seemed ol no benefit for the freshmen
failed to score during the half. Corbin
and, Sheffield each got a foul for Pied
mont. and the half ended 5 to 2.
New Team Used
In the third quarter the Babes finally
managed to get going and shot seven
baskets in rapid succession. Price
made a point from the foul line, bring
ing the Babe total to 20 points at the
end of the quarter.
With the score 20 to 5 Hunt sent
in an entire new team.
