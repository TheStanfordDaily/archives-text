# BEARS-CARDS OPEN SERIES ON SATURDAY
## Individuals Are Bruin Mainstay; Team Work Is Strong Asset Of Cardinal Varsity 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford and California quintets meet Saturday night in
the first game of the series with the odds favoring neither
team to any outstanding degree.
Individually California seems to have the edge on the Card
five, but as a team Stanford has shown more power, more
ability to come back in the pinches, ahd more concentrated
teamwork than the Berkeley court squad.
Around Johnny Talt, flashy Bear forward, is centered
most of California's hopes. 1 alt has made a ragged showing
this season, coming through with an overwhelming majority
points in one contest, and taking a dismal flop in otliers. But Talt is dan
gerous. It is safe*to say that he will be in top form in the Stanford game.
The California motto is "heat Stanford," and to beat Stanford Talt
must necessarily be the keystone, or the Bears will be seriously, if not
hopelessly, handicapped.
Kincaid, playing standing guard for the Bruins, is another bright
light. Kincaid is playing a better game this season than at any time in his

He is the center of the Bear
| defense, and from him most of the
California plays begin.
Kincaid usually plays more in the
center of the court than is usual for
a running guard. Before the U. S. C.
contests the Bear defense made it
necessary for him to play under the
basket, but the Trojans worked all
around this mode of defense in the
same way that they did against Stan
ford, and Wight, seeing the weakness,
has continued to keep his standing
" guard roving from center to the goal.
Kyte Shifted to Center
Kyte, who began at forward for the
Bears {ft the first of the season, is
now working out at center. Kyte has
j shown some ability at his new posi
' tion, especially in the recent Nevada
games. He was the player must in
strumental in staging the Bear come
back against the Sagebrushers when
the score looked darkest for the
Bruins.
Houvenin is playing another year at
forward, but so far this season he has
proved disastrously inconsistent. In
oQ'i contest lie will play like a top
notclier, and in another game he looks
a greenhorn. But, like Talt,
Houvenin is most apt to make his best
showing against Stanford.
Bear Substitutes Strong
California has a wealth of substi
tute material from which to draw. The
strongest asset the Bears possessed
last season against the Cards was
their reserve strength. Stanford had
no power from which to draw in this
department, which resulted in easily
staged last-period rallies by the Bears,
who were aided by fresh men pitted
against Card players who had with
stood the gaff of an entire contest.
This year the same problem looms
up menacingly. There is not one sub
stitute on the Card bench who can
be depended upon to enter into the
offensive plays with any success. The
substitution records this year have
shown that the Cardinal team slows
up to such an extent with reserves in
the line-up that the opposition takes
the upper hand immediately.
