# CHINESE SYSTEM OF EDUCATION IS COMING TO FRONT
## President of Yale-in-China College Expresses Hope For Future 
### 
"China has the beginnings of an
educational system which is already
taking the lead, and the days will
come when it will spread over the
country," predicted Dr. Edward H.
Hume, president of the Yale-in-China
College at Shang-Sha, China,speaking
on discouragements and hopes in
China to a University assembly this
morning.
"Help, which American universities
are giving China in founding schools,
is only a temporary expedient. Chin
ese, educated in America, have begun
schools themselves and instituted a
superior educational system.
Construction Forces United
"Before I came to America this
time, I asked the greatest scholar in
China what I should tell the Ameri
can people. He said, 'When 1 look at
the political situation in China, I am
twelve-tenths discouraged. But the
men who are so selfishly fighting for
themselves are bound to fail, because
they are at oclds with each other.
The forces which are making for con
struction are all united.'
"An example of the growing power
of the forces which make for con
struction is in the schools of China.
Twelve years ago, at the close of the
Manchu dynasty, there were 1,500,000
children in Chinese schools. In spite
of the depression, the military chaos,
and the political selfishness, there are
now 7,000,000 children in schools, â€¢
China On Up-Grade
"Confucius believed that a
boy had learned filial obedience and
the principles of citizenship, then
there was time enough to learn to
read and write.
"But China has begun to see and
to improve, not only educational op
portunities, but also agricultural
methods, forestry and road building;
railroads are coming.
"The Chinese people have always
possessed two characteristics, love
and respect' for education, and great
hospitality. For centuries, impetus has
been coming from China for education
and advancement. In the middle ages,
inventions were brought into Europe
from China.
Chinese Civilization Old
"Many things which we think are
modern, China has had for thousands
of years. The earthquake detector,
which we consider new, was invented
in China 100 years or more B. C. The
action of the heart and the circulatory
syslem were known in China 1000
years B. C. Treatments for disease,
which we call modern, have been used
for centuries.
"China is a 'timeless country', and
it is slowly developing and gaining
power. Americans would do well to
make friends with this greatest of
coming nations."
