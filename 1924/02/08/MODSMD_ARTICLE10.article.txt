# U. S. NEEDS ANOTHER PARTY
## No Prospects For Liberal Organization In Politics, Says Professor West 
### Marjorie Morehead 
THE United States needs today a liberal and progressive party. This is the
opinion of Victor J. West, head of the Political Science department, in dis
cussing the possibility of a third party in the United States.

There are no prospects for such an
organization, according to Professor
West. One reason for this black out
look is the hereditary allegiance to
one of the two leading parties, which
is the legacy of a large proportion of
the voters today. 'Most of these voters
are too well satisfied with whatever
their party dictates to even think of
the establishment of a new party.
Two Parties Dominate
"Due to this allegiance, the Demo
crats and Republicans have become
so strong that as soon as any minor
organization appears to be gaining
power in the political field they imme
diately take steps to absorb it into
their own ranks.
'Another reason why I see so little

— I
hope for a third party is the great !
lack of leadership in the United j
States, today. Practically no outstand-;
ing leaders haw appeared on the J
political horizon in the last two or'
three years, and without a leader it (
is hopeless to even think of starting
such a venture."
Good Leaders Lacking
"A new party would require a man
who could become indignant over
some measure and who would have |
the power of making others indignant i
too. Roosevelt was such a man. The |
onlv one at present who comes any-1
where near this roughrider leader is [
Eugene Debs, and at present both he J
and his party are in ill repute. Conse j
quently, we need hope for few results
in this direction."
According to Professor West, the
late ex-President Wilson and William
Jennings Bryan are the outstadning!
leaders of the last century.
"In addition to the lack of leader
ship and this inherited allegiance to
the two leading parties, there is a
general political inertia in the United
States today which also plays a part
in keeping all newcomers out of the
political field."
