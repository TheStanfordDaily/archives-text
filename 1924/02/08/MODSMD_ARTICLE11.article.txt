# "Stars" Twinkle in Merchant of Menace" Practice
## 
### 
Starting off with a bang, the cast of
Ram's Head's "Merchant of Menace"
ran through its lines last night in
snappy style, under the direction of
Gene Trago. Many "stars in the mak
ing" were evident and by the time the
curtain goes up next Friday night,
they should be shining in all their
glory.
"Ted" VanDeusen has a song up his
sleeve that ought to bring down the
house. Aided by Gardner Lippincott
as Napoleon and "Eddy" Howard as
Caesar, the trio should prove a show
all by themselves. "Ted" can wheeze
just as well as he draws.
Chorus Takes Form
"Working into the main plot with
amazing skill, the chorus, last night,
showed up in good form. It was the
first time it had gone through rehears
als with the main cast. Aileen Eyre,
chorus director, has developed some
of Stanford's champion mud-plows into
dainty ladies.
The chorus will probably be seen
gracing the footlights about twenty
one times in all, counting at least two
encores for every song, which is a
moderate estimate. Some of the gentle
men and ladies who are putting in
time every night perfecting their
form are: Dean Grunland, "Bob"
Cavanaugh, George Frazier, "Van"
King, "Bill" Hammond. Jack Gregory,
"Ev" Young, and "Barney" Lane.
