# "LAME DUCKS," CIVIL SERVICE EVIL-JORDAN
## 
### 
"Lame ducks," men who have failed
to be elected, or re-elected, are one
of the greatest evils of the civil service
now. The President feels he must do
something for them so he puts the
lamest into the Indian service and
the rest into other positions.
This is what Dr. Jordan said at a
conference of students at his home
last evening.
Dr. Jordan outlined the history of
the civil service reform. "It began
with Garfield's administration. He at
tempted to clean up incompetency in
government affairs, and lost his life
for it. President Cleveland did a great
deal by introducing the competitive
examination into some offices. That
isn't the best system but it at least
keeps out illiterates.
"Roosevelt did the most for civil
service reform and the service was
at its best during his terms. Wilson
went into office firmly determined to
have justice, but a president can not
do everything, and during the war
there was a great deal of corruptiou,
especially in the encampments, ship
i building, and airplane divisions."
