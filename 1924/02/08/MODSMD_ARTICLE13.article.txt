Beta Theta Pi, Delta Chi, and El
Tigre are tangled up in a triple tie
for the championship in League 3 as a
result of yesterday's intramural
games.
Japanese Club cinched the title in
League 4 with its fifth straight win.
Beta Theta Pi vanquished the hith
erto undefeated El Tigre five, 14 to 11,
in a fast game. Delta Chi tied these
two contestants at four wins with a
Iff to 12 victory over the Encina Firsts
in another close contest. Japanese
Club had little trouble in defeating
Encina Fifths, 22 to 9. In the other
game, Phi Gamma Delta overwhelmed
Alpha Kappa Lambda, 17 to 3.
The Betas entered the game with
one less win than El Tigre, but started
off with a bang. Alabaster and Smith
each tallying a field goal before the
clubmen knew what had happened.
Butterfield came back with a basket
for El Tigre and the battle speeded
up. Granger sunk a free throw for the
Betas, only to have Lowe retaliate
with a club score from the floor. The
fraternity men rallied as the half
ended, Smith and Granger contributing
a basket apiece to bring the score at
half time to 9 to 4. El Tigre seemed
j to experience difficulty in penetrating
its opponents' five-man defense, and
did not have much success with long
shots.
El Tigre Rallies
The second half saw even faster
play than the first. El Tigre rallying
: in the scoring department. Alabaster
opened with a basket from under the
hoop for the Betas, and Butterfield
counted with a pretty shot from the
center of the court for the club team.
This made Alabaster just mad enough
to loop the ball through once more. I
Tibbe sunk a free throw for the Betas j
as the game ended, making the final ;
count 14 to 11 for them.
Alabaster, Smith, and Granger lead!
the scoring for the Betas, while Butter-1
field and Taylor showed well for the !
losers.
Delta Chi-Encina Game Fast
Delta Chi had its hands full in tak- \
ing the measure of the Encina Firsts
in a game that was fast all the way i
through. Delta Chi managed to hold
on to a slim lead in the first half
through the good work of Coplen and
Suffern at forwards. The first period i
ended with the fraternity on top, 9 to
8. Both teams seemed to have diffi
culty in finding the basket.
Coplen, Whitfield, and Suffern play-,
ed a good game for Delta Chi. Ana
wait, Encina forward, was responsible'
for the bulk of the hall men's scores. !
If Delta Chi had been able to sink
free throws she would have been able |
to run up a much larger total.
Japanese Win Handily
The Japanese Club walked away
with an easy victory over the Encina
Fifths. The hall team put up a fair
fight in the first half, Bennett opening
with a basket for Encina. Both teams
missed many easy shots. The score
at half time was 8 to 5 in favor of'the I
Japanese.
Koba, star running guard for the
Japanese Club, hung up an individual
scoring record of fifty-two points for ;
the series when he accounted for ten
markers in this game. Brady per
formed well for the losers.
To break the triple tie in League 3,
Delta Chi will meet El Tigre Monday
at 4:15, and the winner will play Beta
Theta Pi at 4:15 Thursday.
