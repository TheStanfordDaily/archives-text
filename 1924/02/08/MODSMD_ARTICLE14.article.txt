# PUNCH GIVES PUBLIC OPINION, SAYS ADAMS
## 
### 
"Punch has been one of the instru- j
ments for expressing public opinion j
in England," said Dr. E. D. Adams in
his illustrated lecture before History!
Club last night. "By 1860, the maga
zine had become conservative and re-;
fleeted the opinion of the governing
class."
The slides illustrated the different
periods of the Civil War as they ap- >
peared to the English. The dependence j
of England on America's cotton sup- j
ply was shown in several cartoons, j
Punch considered the Civil War as j
servile. The magazine failed to men
tion either Vicksburg or Gettysburg,
two of the most important battles of
the war.
Th<* pictures of Lincoln showed a
change in his face as Punch changed
its opinion of him. At first, according
to Professor Adams, the cartoons por
trayed hiÂ«n with a foolish expression,
but this gradually changed until at
the end he was pictured with due dig-,
nity and seriousness.
Slides of other statesmen were also :
j shown. Most of the cartoons were the;
work of John Tenniell.
