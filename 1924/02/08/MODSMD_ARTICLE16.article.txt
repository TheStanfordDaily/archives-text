# 'NOW BEAT CALIFORNIA', SAYS KERR
## CARD, BRUIN QUINTETS EVENLY MATCHED FOR FIRST CONTEST IN PAVILION TOMORROW NIGHT Stanford Varsity Has Power When Working As Unit; Bear Players Are Strong Individually 
### David Meiklejohn 
Coach Andy Kerr will cut his practice short this afternoon with the
words, Now. heat California. And some 10,0() people will he looking
011 in the pavilion at N oclock tomorrow night to see if Kerr's mandate
will he fulfilled.
Neither squad has any decided advantage. Comparative scores are
thrown into the waste basket as the Stanford-California series approaches,
and the teams will fight it out basically on the pure merits of a deep-seated
rivalry.

Bears Strong Individually
If individualism is to count for any
advantage, the Bears seem to have
an edge, but it is indeed a dull one;
because for every Talt, Houvenin, and
Kincaid, there is a MeHose, a Nevers,
and an Oliva.
The Stanford team has power—if
it works as a unit. The defeat at the
hands of the Trojans in the first game
was probably due to the attempts of
the players to individualize their play.
In the last half of the second contest,
it was exceedingly evident that the
Stanford team work was driving, and
driving with effectiveness.
MeHose, Nevers Are Barriers
There is not another pair of for
wards like Ernie Nevers and "Nip"
McHr; e anywhere on the Coast. Both
work well together despite the ques
tionable handicap of size. Size might
after all have something to do with
the success of their combined efforts.
An elusive forward, and a hard plung
ing forward are like a fleet halfback,
and a plowing fullback in football.
Both MeHose and Nevers are fast.
How Nevers can handle his 200 pounds
with such alacrity on the court is a
revelation, but ne does it, and gets
away with it, which is all that is ex
pected of any player, even a Talt.
Five-Man Defensive Prevails
More than likely, both squads will

employ the usual five-man defense
which has turned out to be the strong
er method in the case of the Card
quintet. Both fives will have the prob
lem of a strong standing guard to
contend with, Kincaid and Oliva.
If Stanford plays a game like it
staged in the first Trojan contest, the
results are likely to be disastrous.
Whereas, if it is to be the same brand
as was shown in the last of the U. S.

1 C. games, the thermometer of chance
rises higher in favor of Stanford.
Talt, Bear Star
On Johnny Talt rests most of the
California responsibility, and on "Nip"
McHoße lies a great deal of the Stan
ford hopes for victory. McHose, like
Talt, has been inconsistent in many
I of the games this season, but he comes
j through in the pinches, and there are
many pinches which are likely to be

gone through tomor oefore

The Stanford team has power—if
it works as a unit. The defeat at the
hands of the Trojans in the first game
was probably due to the attempts of
the players to individualize their play.
In the last half of the second contest,
it was exceedingly evident that the
Stanford team work was driving, and
driving with effectiveness.
MeHose, Nevers Are Barriers
There is not another pair of for
wards like Ernie Nevers and "Nip"
McHr; e anywhere on the Coast. Both
work well together despite the ques
tionable handicap of size. Size might
after all have something to do with
the success of their combined efforts.
An elusive forward, and a hard plung
ing forward are like a fleet halfback,
and a plowing fullback in football.
Both MeHose and Nevers are fast.
How Nevers can handle his 200 pounds
with such alacrity on the court is a
revelation, but ne does it, and gets
away with it, which is all that is ex
pected of any player, even a Talt.
Five-Man Defensive Prevails
More than likely, both squads will

employ the usual five-man defense
which has turned out to be the strong
er method in the case of the Card
quintet. Both fives will have the prob
lem of a strong standing guard to
contend with, Kincaid and Oliva.
If Stanford plays a game like it
staged in the first Trojan contest, the
results are likely to be disastrous.
Whereas, if it is to be the same brand
as was shown in the last of the U. S.

1 C. games, the thermometer of chance
rises higher in favor of Stanford.
Talt, Bear Star
On Johnny Talt rests most of the
California responsibility, and on "Nip"
McHoße lies a great deal of the Stan
ford hopes for victory. McHose, like
Talt, has been inconsistent in many
I of the games this season, but he comes
j through in the pinches, and there are
many pinches which are likely to be

gone through tomor oefore

TJie California lin >bably
be: Talt, forward; J ward;

Stanford's starting eludes
all the veterans, McHose, forward;
Nevers, forward; Steele, center; Mc-
Burney, guard; and Oliva, guard.
Coach Andy Kerr will cut his practice short this afternoon with the
words, Now. heat California. And some 10,0() people will he looking
011 in the pavilion at N oclock tomorrow night to see if Kerr's mandate
will he fulfilled.
Neither squad has any decided advantage. Comparative scores are
thrown into the waste basket as the Stanford-California series approaches,
and the teams will fight it out basically on the pure merits of a deep-seated
rivalry.

Bears Strong Individually
If individualism is to count for any
advantage, the Bears seem to have
an edge, but it is indeed a dull one;
because for every Talt, Houvenin, and
Kincaid, there is a MeHose, a Nevers,
and an Oliva.
