# DIAMOND VARSITY TO MEET KENEALY SEALS TOMORROW
## 
### 
With a little co-operation from the
weather, the Cardinal nine will see
action against the Kenealy Seals to
morrow afternoon at 2:30 on the var
sity diamond. The rain last Wednes
day stopped the projected brawl with
the San Francisco Police team, and
the Redshirts are in tine fettle after
a week's rest.
The pitching staff has worked all
the way around this season, and the
chances are that Coach Harry Wolter
will pick Oviatt for the mound. Oviatt
bears the distinction of having won
his first varsity game, and 1s a good
twirler to boot. The Seals have a
reputation for slugging the ball, com
bined with all-around ability on the
defensive, and the game will be tight.
Mulchay got his eye on the ball last.
Saturday for the first time this season,
and his fielding gives him a clear title
to the shortstop position. Roberts will
be at second, with other positions as
usual. Trace or Fuller will start in
center field.
