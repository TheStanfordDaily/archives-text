# Policy

### 
Today's issue of the Daily Palo Alto is the first of Volume 65.
The policy of the Daily for the next four months will be to serve the
best interests of the University and to publish accurate and unbiased news.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that, in order to safeguard the community
which makes up Stanford University, against itself as well as outside
criticism, certain practices must he encouraged and others discouraged.
A greater interest in student affairs is absolutely necessary. It will be
the ambition of the Daily to increase interest in student body elections. Too
many important student body and class offices have been filled in the past
on white ballots. Athletics, journalism, dramatics, debating and all other
activities merit and should get the whole-hearted support of the student
body.
Petty Hall-Row politics tend to disrupt the student body and break up
what should be the STANFORD FAMILY. "Small" politicians are
under foot constantly. As they are menaces to the welfare of the Univer
sity, they should not be tolerated.
The Daily Palo believes that social activities form a very important
part of the life of any university. However, when they conflict with class
room work and student activities, they become parasitic.
Constructive criticism will be welcome in the Daily office at all times.
Signed communications which are meritorious will be published, provided
that they are not longer than 250 words.
The editorial columns will not be confined to the opinions of one man.
A Board of Editorial Assistants has been created. It is to be composed
of Carl Shoup, '24, Robert Edwards, '24, and Philip Newill, '24. These
men will contribute editorial material from time to time. No editorials
will be signed, as they will all represent the attitude of the paper rather
than of an individual. The men who have been placed on this board are
all well-informed, interested participants in student affairs.
The support and co-operation of the student body is absolutely essen
tial to a successful college daily paper. The Daily Palo Alto is owned and
published by the students of Stanford University and in turn seeks only
to serve the best interests of the institution which it represents.
