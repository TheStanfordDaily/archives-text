## 
### 
Frosh baseball prospects have re
ceived a jolt Avith the placing of
Smythe. McKersie, and Sheets on the
ineligibility list.
Smythe at short, McKersie at first,
and Sheets in the outfield, showed up
-well in the San Mateo game last week,
and their places will be rather hard
ito fill.
In spite of 1 this blow, Coach "Husky"
Hunt will send a strong squad against
Oakland Tech tomorrow afternoon.
Collins May Pitch
Collins will probably be given a
■chance to start in the box, with Ost
liaus on hand in case anything goes
•wrong. "Bill" Stewart will make up
the other half of the battery.
Lindquist, who held down second
last week, will be shifted to first, and
Pegram will be moved in from the
outfield to fill Lindquist's old job. New
kirk at short, and Morrill at third, will
complete the infield.
Jerry Stewart, Lewis, and either
Osthaus or Collins, will chase flies
through the puddles in the outfield.
