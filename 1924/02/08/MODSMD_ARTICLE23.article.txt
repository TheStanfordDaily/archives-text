# "DANCE DIFFERENT" IS TITLE SUGGESTED FOR CLUBHOUSE FOOT FROLIC TONIGHT
## 
### 
"The Dance Different" might be the
title for the foot frolic tonight at
the Woman's Clubhouse. The fact
that it isn't doesn't make much dif
ference. Because —
The Rally Committee has arranged
for a programme that, it is rumored,
will cause the most calloused club
house climber to team with joy
throughout the evening. Because —
(1) There will be three 'spot"
dances, — the one who is on the
lucky spot when the music stops gets
a pound box of Co-Ed chocolates. If
the same one wins the prize each of
the three times, a criminal investi
gation of the Rally Committee will
be started, it was announced late this
afternoon by the district attorney.
(2) Delmer Daves and the Glee

Club's quartet will entertain those as
sembled with either a Persian love
song or a Siberian bugle call special
ty. Anyway, they're going to be there.
(3) Dorothy Dahler, of "Seven or
Eleven" fame in last year's Junior
Opera, will oblige by a selection, the
exact nature of which has not yet
been revealed.
(4) "Nip" McHose, who leads his
basket-shooters into the first of the
California battles tomorrow night, will
talk on the current topic fo greatest
interest, i. e., basketball.
(5,6,7,8,9) This is a close date.
A few warnings are in order:
This affair will absolutely not be a
"jolly-up." Palo Alto's Chief of Police
confirmed this statement early this
morning.
Dinner will not be served.
