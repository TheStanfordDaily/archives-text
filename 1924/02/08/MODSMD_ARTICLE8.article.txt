# WILLITS EXPECTS TO DEFEAT BABES IN COURT BATTLE
## 1927 Team Plays Livermore In Varsity Preliminary Tomorrow Evening 
### Wallace Knox 
Willits high arrived on the campus
yesterday morning with a squad of
confident hoopsters to prepare for its
game with the freshmen this evening
at 7 in the pavilion.
The northern team couldn't get any
competition in its own section of the
state, so it secured this game with the
Babes in the hopes that the yearlings
might at least give it a stiff workout.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men are ready
to fool the northern stars.
Willits has been piling up large
scores in most of its games. Recently,
it won by a GO to 20 count in a league
game. One of the Willits players got
eleven field goals in the contest.
Has Good Record
From the record of the Willits team,
it should be able to give the Babes a
hard fight. The freshmen have won
ten games to date, and have not met
with a single defeat. Willits tonight,
and Livermore tomorrow night are the
only remaining preliminaries before
the California series which starts next
week.
Livermore should be the easier of
the two games. Livermore has been
defeated by both Berkeley and Pied
mont, teams which the freshmen
downed easily.
The Babes were off form in their
game against Piedmont Wednesday
night. They won by the score of 23 to
8, but almost all of the points were
made in the third quarter, when the
forwards seemed to be able to find
the hoop with their usual accuracy.
Off Night Uncommon .
The freshmen are not in the habit
of having two off-nights in a row, and
so it is probable that they will be
registering goals with their usual luck
against Willits and Livermore.
Hunt used three teams against Pied
mont. With games on consecutive
nights, he will try and get as many
substitutes into the play as possible.
As the game with Willits is expected
to be hard, the regulars will probably
have to play the greater part of it.
x\nderson was unable to get in a
suit Wednesday because of a bad cold,
but he will be ready for action tomor
row. Riese started the game at center
against Piedmont, but he is not fast
enough to hold down this position in a
close game. McCormick and Walker
also took the pivot job for a few
minutes each. McCormick will be first
choice to relieve Jayred tonight, if
Anderson is unable to play.
Reserves Can't Score
Price and David seem to be the only
forwards who are able to score. All the
baskets that substitutes at forward
have made during the season can be
counted on one hand. Hoffman, Riese,
and Blazier are the best of the forward
reserves, but as yet none of them
have shown ability to evade their
guards.
Shipkey is getting to be a better
shooter as the season progresses. He
opened the point-making against Pied
mont with a shot from the sidelines.
Williams, Clark, and Holman got in
the game at running guard against
Piedmont, and all of them are capable
of giving Shipkey a rest.

From the record of the Willits team,
it should be able to give the Babes a
hard fight. The freshmen have won
ten games to date, and have not met
with a single defeat. Willits tonight,
and Livermore tomorrow night are the
only remaining preliminaries before
the California series which starts next
week.
Livermore should be the easier of
the two games. Livermore has been
defeated by both Berkeley and Pied
mont, teams which the freshmen
downed easily.
The Babes were off form in their
game against Piedmont Wednesday
night. They won by the score of 23 to
8, but almost all of the points were
made in the third quarter, when the
forwards seemed to be able to find
the hoop with their usual accuracy.
Off Night Uncommon .
The freshmen are not in the habit
of having two off-nights in a row, and
so it is probable that they will be
registering goals with their usual luck
against Willits and Livermore.
Hunt used three teams against Pied
mont. With games on consecutive
nights, he will try and get as many
substitutes into the play as possible.
As the game with Willits is expected
to be hard, the regulars will probably
have to play the greater part of it.
x\nderson was unable to get in a
suit Wednesday because of a bad cold,
but he will be ready for action tomor
row. Riese started the game at center
against Piedmont, but he is not fast
enough to hold down this position in a
close game. McCormick and Walker
also took the pivot job for a few
minutes each. McCormick will be first
choice to relieve Jayred tonight, if
Anderson is unable to play.
Reserves Can't Score
Price and David seem to be the only
forwards who are able to score. All the
baskets that substitutes at forward
have made during the season can be
counted on one hand. Hoffman, Riese,
and Blazier are the best of the forward
reserves, but as yet none of them
have shown ability to evade their
guards.
Shipkey is getting to be a better
shooter as the season progresses. He
opened the point-making against Pied
mont with a shot from the sidelines.
Williams, Clark, and Holman got in
the game at running guard against
Piedmont, and all of them are capable
of giving Shipkey a rest.

Willits high arrived on the campus
yesterday morning with a squad of
confident hoopsters to prepare for its
game with the freshmen this evening
at 7 in the pavilion.
The northern team couldn't get any
competition in its own section of the
state, so it secured this game with the
Babes in the hopes that the yearlings
might at least give it a stiff workout.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's men are ready
to fool the northern stars.
Willits has been piling up large
scores in most of its games. Recently,
it won by a GO to 20 count in a league
game. One of the Willits players got
eleven field goals in the contest.
