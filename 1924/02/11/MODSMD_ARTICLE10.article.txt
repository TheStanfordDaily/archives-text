# BABES BEAT WILLITS AND LIVERMORE FIVES
## Freshmen End Preliminary Schedule, Winning 12 Straight Contests 
### 
Defeating two strong high school
hoop teams on successive nights, the
freshman basketball team completed its
preliminary schedule without a defeat.
The hitherto undefeated YVillits team
was down 22 to 17 on Friday, and the
next night the Babes trampled over
Livermore, snowing them under a 26 to
14 score.
Fred Price was the outstanding star
of both games. In the game against
Livermore he made five field goals,
most of them coming from difficult
angles. His defensive work was of a
high order, and he was the center of
the Babe offeffnse. The first team
played for only a quarter against Wil
lits, but in this time Price shot two
baskets.
Jayred and David also played good
games both nights. Jayred made five
follow shots for goals in the two games.
David did not do too well in the scor
ing end hut his floorwork was respon
sible for many of the Babe scores.
Regulars Taken Out.
The regulars started the game
against Willits, but in order to save
them for the second game, Coach
"Husky" Hunt sent in his second string
during the second quarter, after the
freshmen had secured a 10 to 3 lead.
The highly touted Willits team failed
to outscore the new squad. Towards
the end of the half they staged a rally
and tossed in three baskets in rapid
succession, but Riese scored twice from
the foul line and the freshmen led at
the half, 12 to 9.
Willits continued to threaten
throughout the next half, being only a
basket behind most of the final period.
Hoffman, playing in the "hole," re
ceived two long passes, and scored from
under the hoop on both occasions.
With the score 19 to 17, Anderson
ended the Willits' hopes of scoring
when he made two baskets in as many
minutes. This practically ended the
scoring, and the gun ended the contest
with the Babes ahead 22 to 17.
Livermore Fast.
Livermore has the fastest team the
yearlings have played against this sea-
