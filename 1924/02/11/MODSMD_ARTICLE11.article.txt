half.
Coach "Tiny" Thornhill started
O'Hara and Necr at forward, and Stew
art at center. The score was 3 to 3 at
the end of the first quarter. Cornell

the end of the first quarter. Cornell
went in for Neer, and Knox for Stew
! art. However, it wasn't until the sec-
I ond half that this combination solved
| the San Mateo defense.
Cornell showed up well in the sec
ond period. He made three long shots
! through the hoop in a row, and threw
\in one foul. Knox scored two field
goals and two fouls, showing more
' stuff than he has in any previous game.
O'Hara's contribution to the total
was two field goals. His floor work
was one of the main reasons for the
light heavyweight victory. The fac
ulty of working the ball in toward the
basket, so far noted for its absence in
145-pound games, made its appearance
Friday night personified by O'Hara.
Mangin and Lund played steady
games in the guard positions. Lund
! showed improvement, staying well tin
der the basket and following the ball
like a cat.
San Mateo used two pairs of forwards
alternately throughout the game. Tun
berg showed to the best advantage.
Aliomous.lguard, ran up two field goals
for the visitors.
