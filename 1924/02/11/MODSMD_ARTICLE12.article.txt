STANFORD took the lead in the southern section of the Pacific Coast Con
ference Coast Conference basketball league by defeating the California
varsity, 18 to 17, in the pavilion last Saturday night.
A Bear struggled, and five Cardinal basketball men trounced, hard at first,

The score at the end of the first half was Stanford 9, California 7.

18 to 17 which the Bears could not
beat.
Stanford took an early lead. Nevers
started the scoring for the Cards on a
free throw, the result of a foul on
Kincaid. Steele had finished putting in
