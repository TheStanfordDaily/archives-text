# CARD FIVE WINS FIRST CALIFORNIA GAME 18-17
## McHose Saves Contest For Stanford Quintet On Two Free Throws 
### 
By David Meiklejohn
STANFORD took the lead in the southern section of the Pacific Coast Con
ference Coast Conference basketball league by defeating the California
varsity, 18 to 17, in the pavilion last Saturday night.
A Bear struggled, and five Cardinal basketball men trounced, hard at first,
then gradually slowing down as the struggles of the Bruin became more
violent. Finally the Bear freed himself. His revenge was short. "Nip"
McHose came up from behind, threw two free throws in his way, and tripped
him beyond recovery.
It was a frantic struggle with the Cards in the lead with one exception,
when California headed by 17 to 16.
The score at the end of the first half was Stanford 9, California 7.
McHose Saves Game
"Nip" McHose saved the game for Stanford in the last part of the second
period, when California was leading 17 to 16. A foul on Houvenin, within the
limits of the Stanford Goal, gave McHose the opportunity of tieing or putting

>Stanford ahead. He converted both
tries, and gave the Cards a lead of
18 to 17 which the Bears could not
beat.
Stanford took an early lead. Nevers
started the scoring for the Cards on a
free throw, the result of a foul on
Kincaid. Steele had finished putting in
a field goal, but the score was not
counted because of Kincaid's penalty.
But the Card center came through
soon after and added his only tally of
the game on a free throw.
Both squads were suffering from
stage fright, handled the ball nervous
ly, and were too prone to foul.
California missed easy chances to
score repeatedly. Stanford also bob
bled many opportunities for shots.
Oliva Is Hurt
Stanford, minus the services of
Dave Oliva. who was injured in the
knee in the first half, began to slacken
down in the second period to a notice
able extent. Houvenin, who was sub
stituted for Kyte at forward for the
Bears, was able to sneak under the
basket twice, and scored two easy at
tempts without interference from the
Card defense.
Houvenin tied the score at 9-9 a
minute after the second period was
under way. Mcßurney gave the lead
to Stanford on a field goal from side
center. Nevers converted a foul on
Talt, and Mcßurney missed a foul on
Houvenin. Houvenin shot another field
goal, and Nevers converted another
free tally, giving Stanford the shaky
lead of 13 to 11.
Mcßurney Finds Hoop
Mcßurney found the net for two
more points, and Higgins carae back
in like manner for the Bears. Nevers
converted a foul. Stanford led 16 to
13. Talt shot a field goal from a play
which started from under the Stan
ford goal with California having the
ball outside. Talt sank a second field
marker, and California was ahead, 17
to 16. Houvenin fouled and McHose
converted two free throws, giving the
Cardinal basketers the lead and game,
18 to 17.
Houvenin missed the opportunity to
win the game when his final attempt
hit the side of the hoop, rolled around
and dropped outside.
