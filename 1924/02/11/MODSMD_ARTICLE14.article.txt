# CIRCUS SHOWS UP VARSITY MATERIAL
## 
### 
Good material for varsity teams was
brought to light Friday evening in the
all-University three-ring circus spon
sored by Coach Harry Maloney.
Bouts in boxing, wrestling, and fenc
ing were staged, the entries being nov
ices and prospects for later varsity com
petition.
Interest was centered in the leather
pushers as usual and a number of good
bouts were fought although all showed
novice ability.
Tull and Herz, heavyweights, put on
a good slugging exhibition, Herz Hail
ing like a windmill. The match was
given by Referee Maloney to Tull to
save further slaughter.
Goldwater, a lightweight, displayed
perhaps the best defensive work of the
evening and easily won over Freedman.
Fannin and Harris, two light heavies,
mixed it for three fast rounds, which
were lengthened to a fourth. This was
finally called a draw.
Parsons and Martin, junior welter
weights, put forward a fast match for
the large gallery present. The bout
was close and declared a draw only
after it had gone an extra fourth round.
Jacobs beat Thomson in the feather
weight class.
The Schall-Vaughn (middle weight)
and McCallister-Stevenson (senior
welterweight) bouts were declared no
decisions and postponed.
