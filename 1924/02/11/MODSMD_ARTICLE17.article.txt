Some three thousand people, jammed into the Pavilion Saturday
night, saw the Stanford varsity basketball team triumph over the Univer
sity of California quintet in one of the hardest fought and most sensa
tional games ever seen on the Stanford campus.
They saw Andy Kerr's team trot out on to the floor, the under-dog.
They saw Coach Wight's team appear, confident of the victory of which
dope almost assured them. They saw the Cardinal sweep the Blue and
Gold off its feet in the first few minutes. They saw the Stanford team
maintain its lead until the final minutes and lose it. Finally, they saw
Captain McHose, his team trailing by one point, step to the free throw
line and make good two tries, with less than sixty seconds of playing time
remaining.
The Cardinal team clung desperately to that one point advantage
which proved just enough to win 18-17.
Every Stanford player who got into that game came through. Nevers
and Steele, playing under a severe handicap in the second half, deserve a
great deal of credit. Each of them had three personal fouls called in the
first half and the fourth would have meant disqualification. Mcßurney,
under-rated by the California team, was one of the shining lights. ()liva,
until he was hurt, played a wonderful game on the defense. Shipkey, who
took Oliva's place, played the best game of his basketball career.
History evidently repeats itself. Last year. "Nip" McHose made
good a free throw in the closing minutes of a tight game to defeat the
California team 18-17. Saturday night, he repeated his performance of
last year. It is come through athletes that strengthen a team.
Too much praise cannot be given "Little Andy" Kerr for the showing
the Stanford team made. He has been handicapped by lack of capable
substitutes, but has done remarkably well.
