Scene: Women's Clubhouse. A dance is in progress. Chairs around
the sides and ends of the room are almost all occupied by roughs. Women
and their escorts are standing up wondering how soon they are to be
crowded off the floor.
Fair "Import:" Isn't there any place to sit down? Why are those
men in old clothes occupying all the seats?
Escort: Sh-h-h, they may hear you. Those are roughs.
F. I.: And, pray tell, what and who are "roughs?"
Escort (In an awed tone) : They are a sacred tradition at Stanford.
They, like the king, can do no wrong.
F. I.: Hmph!
