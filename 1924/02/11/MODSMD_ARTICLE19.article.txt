Tomorrow afternoon, Coach Harry Maloney's varsity soccer team
meets the California squad here. Soccer, while a very deserving sport,
and interesting from the spectator's standpoint, has not received much
support in the past.
While the interest of the student body is centered mainly on major
sports, it would be well to rememl)er one or two things. The men who are
playing on minor sport teams are working just as faithfully, the coaches
are striving just as hard to build up a winning aggregation, and the players
are just as much representing the Cardinal as players and coaches of
major sports.
There is no other sport event to conflict with the soccer game tomor
row afternoon and a good crowd should be on hand.
