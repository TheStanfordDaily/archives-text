## 
### 
In one of the fastest games of the
season Kappa Sigma won League 5 of
the intramural court series Friday, by
defeating Encina Third, 10 to 7, in the
playoff tor the title. At the end of the
preliminary rounds the teams had been
tied with four wins apiece.
Defenses Strong.
The game was fast and rough
throughout, with the result in doubt
until the last few minutes. In the first
half neither side could penetrate the
•opposing defense, and the ball remained
close to the center of the floor. Lind
quist caged a long one for Encina, and
Middleton sank a foul try for Kappa
Sigma, making the score at the half,
2 to 1 in favor of Encina.
Close Guarding.
Short shots, however, were pre
vented by close guarding. First one
side, then the other, took the lead,
until a lucky shot by Kappa Sigma men
put them ahead just before the final
whistle.
Middleton at center played his usual
star game for the Kappa Sigs, scoring
six of their ten points. Deffebach at
forward and Symonds at guard were
the other Kappa Sigma men to find the
basket. For Encina. Lindquist and
Smythe were the outstanding players.
