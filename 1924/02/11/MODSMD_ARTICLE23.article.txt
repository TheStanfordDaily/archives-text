Alonzo intends to be a doctor. Lots of men come to college with that idea.
Most of them end up on a ranch and learn to be cowboys. Then they
move to the cities and remain cowboys. Only they range over the
wide, open spaces of a drugstore. Alonzo is not that kind. He
sticks to anything he starts on. Once he started down a
slide at a playground. He stuck to it. And tore his —
upholstery. Alonzo wanted to be a doctor from the
time his mother first forced castor oil down his
throat. He liked the taste so well. Some
boys get that slick appearance at college.
Alonzo got his by taking castor oil.
That's how he got his habit of taking
things. His slick appearance got him in a
, fraternity. His taking ways kept him in shirts
and toothpaste. He just borrowed things. He had
everything he needed in his trunk. But he threw the
key away. That got by big with the brothers. Alonzo got
lots of practice in borrowing. He talked an Irish pawnbroker out
of $9 on an Ingersoll watch. Alonzo started out to be a doctor. Lots
of men change their minds. Alonzo hasn't any to change, and if he had, no
one would trade him. But he can't be a doctor now. He's at the end of his rope.

In going through the waste-basket, we find that banana jobbers announce a
convention to be held in Florida soon.
(Now wait a minute! Give us a chance! We're not going to pull that old
one )
Judging by repeated comment during the past many months we are of trie
opinion that there are no bananas and we see no need for holding such a
convention unless the jobbers hope to find some more bananas.
Speaking of bananas, the author of the well-known piece of jazz claims that
he never will be able to equal his first musical comments regarding the yellow
fruit. If this is a promise we shall probably let him live. D. A.

No. 3 —Alonzo's Career
Alonzo intends to be a doctor. Lots of men come to college with that idea.
Most of them end up on a ranch and learn to be cowboys. Then they
move to the cities and remain cowboys. Only they range over the
wide, open spaces of a drugstore. Alonzo is not that kind. He
sticks to anything he starts on. Once he started down a
slide at a playground. He stuck to it. And tore his —
upholstery. Alonzo wanted to be a doctor from the
time his mother first forced castor oil down his
throat. He liked the taste so well. Some
boys get that slick appearance at college.
Alonzo got his by taking castor oil.
That's how he got his habit of taking
things. His slick appearance got him in a
, fraternity. His taking ways kept him in shirts
and toothpaste. He just borrowed things. He had
everything he needed in his trunk. But he threw the
key away. That got by big with the brothers. Alonzo got
lots of practice in borrowing. He talked an Irish pawnbroker out
of $9 on an Ingersoll watch. Alonzo started out to be a doctor. Lots
of men change their minds. Alonzo hasn't any to change, and if he had, no
one would trade him. But he can't be a doctor now. He's at the end of his rope.
