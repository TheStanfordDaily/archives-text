# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor. Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Sir:
Mr. Editor, do you approve of the
Stanford "rough" and the tradition
surrounding him? I feel sure you do.
But I also feel sure that you do not
approve of the spectacle staged by
our cherished Stanford "roughs" and
our famous Stanford gentlemen at the
Women's Clubhouse last Friday and
Saturday nights.
On both nights most of the chairs
in the clubhouse were filled by these
so-called "roughs" who sat there and
sucked their thumbs while the couples
who came there to dance had to stand
during intermissions or go outside and
walk around.
I did not count the chairs occupied
by the seat-hogs, but I venture to say
that on Saturday night at least three
fourths of the chairs were taken by
the "roughs" long before the music
started for the first dance. And I
might add, incidentally, that I was
there on both nights as a Spectator,
so my viewpoint is not prejudiced in
the least.
As a matter of fact, those fellows
who sprawled themselves over the
chairs and tried to act hard-boiled,
succeeded only in making themselves
highly ridiculous by their painfully
obvious lack of common courtesy.
They may have worn cords, sweaters,
etc., but after all they really were
not Stanford "roughs." A hard-boiled
attitude and rough clothes do not
make Stanford "roughs;" they never
have, and they never will. .
And as to how far our hoggish
friends fall short of being Stanford

gentlemen â€”well, why speak of it at
all? Most of them probably have never
even heard of such a category.
The point is, Mr. Editor, that this
state of affairs is no new and sudden
development of the past week. It has
been coming on gradually and getting
worse all the time, and if something
is not done about it, it is quite likely
that the lid will begin to come down
on our "roughing" tradition, as it has
on so many other traditions during
the last year or two.
However, there is absolutely no
reason why such conduct on the part
of the "roughs" should be tolerated
for a moment, even though most of
them seem to feel that just because
they are Roughs they have license to
do as they please. There is no time
like the present to squelch that idea
completely.
Yours for some "On the Boat Assem
blies", for Roughs.
Bill Senter, '22.
