tion Yard team, 13 to 8.
Pitcher Mayerhofer, for the Press
outfit, not only pitched a good game
but stretched one of his hits to a
home run.
Manager McNabb is very enthusi
astic over his team and expects a
return game soon with the fast Cor
poration Yard team.
Although both teams played good
ball—much better, in fact, than was
expected so early in the season —the
Press boys were seen -to have a slight
edge on the Corporation Yard boys.
Only one change was made in the
line-up, and there was real neces
sity for that change. The ink-slingers
pitched one man the entire game, and

fielding kept the Corporation Yard
team from scoring several times.
The teams are indebted to Wallace
Denny and C. R. Oliver, who umpired
the game.
Manager McNabb says, "We are
open to all comers, and especially
challenge the D. P. A., Chappie, and
