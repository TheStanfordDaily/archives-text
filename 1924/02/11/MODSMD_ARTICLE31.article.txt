# FROSH NINE SHOWS STRENGTH IN GAME WITH OAKLAND TECH
## 
### 
Despite the fact that the Frosh base
ball team lost three first-string men
last week due to low scholarship, they
displayed a surprising strength in
their 6-4 victory over the strong Oak
land Technical High School nine Sat
urday.
Negus, Linquest, and Osthaus ap
peared to fill the void places left in
the team. Osthaus demonstrated his
ability as an outfielder by making
several good catches from his center
field position. Negus, at shortstop, and
Linquest on first base, looked like
good material.
Collins proved himself to be a
pitcher of considerable ability, hold
ing the visitors to five hits and strik
ing cut eight men. The hits that he
did allow came at very opportune
times for the Prep school and this
explains partly the four scores made
by the visitors.
The only position in the infield
which still appears to be weak is sec
ond base. Pegram and Newkirk alter
nated at that position Saturday, and
although both may develop later in
the season it seems that the filling of
that position will cause trouble for
Coach Hunt. Pegram, who started the
game, shows fair form on the field,
but he is a poor hitter.
With Collins and Osthaus alternat
ing in the pitching boxes, it appears
; that the team will have good pitching
strength. There should be one more
substitute pitcher.
The main strength of the Freshman
nine will probably lie in their hitting.
They made nine hits Saturday to the
visitors' five, Walter Stewart making
three out of this number.
