### 
For the second game of this season,
California and Stanford soccer varsities
will clash tomorrow afternoon on Stan
ford field at 4 o'clock. The freshman
squads will also meet in a return game.
U. C. Wins First Game
The Blue and Gold aggregation man
aged to come through with a 4 to 3
win in the first contest played last
quarter on its own field and the Cardi
nal eleven is prepared to even the count
in this tourney.
Four mainstays of the Stanford
eleven who did not play the California
contest will materially strengthen the
squad tomorrow. "Porky" Dwight,
center forward, is to start the game
having been a protege of "Mike" Reed
with his Grays last quarter. "Pete"
Franklin who accounted for the only
two goals made in the Olympic Club
contest two weeks ago, was not reg
istered last quarter but will be seen to
morrow at inside left.
Miron in Lineup.
C. A. Miron, ineligible for competi
tion in the first California game, will
take his old place at center forward.
And Ted Off. also not eligible last
quarter, will start at outside right. „
Little information is available at the
present time as to the strength of the
California squad since its resignation
from the University and Club league.
| In the past six years, however, it has
met the Cardinal eleven with a strong
J aggregation. Last quarter it finished
the University and Club league two
places below Stanford.
Looking over the past records made
i in California-Stanford contests by the
1 Redshirts, the fact is gleaned that out
{ of 27 games between the two —Stanford
! has won 16 and California 6. with 5 tie
! games to finish the record.
Last year, the Cardinal hooters took
both contests with the Bear eleven—
I winning 2 to 1 and 3 to 1.
Strong Backfield.
This year Coach Harry Maloney has
| suceeded in perfecting early in the sea
son a strong backfield and, just re
| cently, several good forward combina
tions. The showing made in the
Ranger game Saturday by the forward
line bids fair to be repeated tomorrow
against the Blue and Gold eleven.
The freshman aggregation will go
into the game tomorrow with a good
backfield and mediocre forward line.
The loss of David, a fast backfield
man, to the basketball squad has caused
the yearling soccer stock to take a
slight slump, but the backfield remain
ing has showed up well so far this sea
son.
The beginning lineups tomorrow will
be:
Varsity: Rogers, goal; Clark, right
back; Munford, left-back; J. Franklin,
right-half; Howe, center-half; Off. left
half; Swayne, outside-right; Dwight,
