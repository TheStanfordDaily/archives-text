### 
Playing through an eleven-inning
game in a fashion that entitles them to
the name of "Hitless Wonders," Coach
Wolter's varsity ball players beat the
Kenealy Seals on the varsity diamond
Saturday, by a score of 4-3.
Nineteen hits were pounded out dur
ing the afternoon, but not one of them
went for more than a single, and only
five were registered in the Stanford
column.
Solly Solomon pitched a nice game
for the varsity in spite of the fact that
fourteen hits were gathered from his
delivery. With men on liases, he tight
ened tip and was never in very great
danger. Eight of the visitors were sent
back to the bench via the strike-out
route and only two of them were given
free trips to first.
Visitors Score First.
The visitors scored the first run of
the game in the second inning. Bailey
walked, went to second on Lee's sacri
fice, and tallied on Peter's single over
first base. The Seals added one run in
the fifth and another in the sixth.
Fuller counted Stanford's first score
in the fifth on a combination of errors.
In the next stanza, with two out, Tap
son at short for the Seals, booted two
grounders in succession and allowed
May to score. Roberts got his usual
run in the seventh after he was walked.
Cuddeback. next man up, singled to
right field, Roberts crossing the plate
when Handley at third, muffed the
throw-in.
Last Innings Slow.
Neither team could squeeze in a run
during the next few innings. In Stan
ford's half of the eleventh, Lefty May
walked and moved to second on Fuller's
bunt. Both May and Fuller advanced
on an error by Peters, the visitors' sec
ond baseman. May scored on Mul
chay's sacrifice fly to left, giving the
Cardinals the winning run.
Johnston, who replaced Lawson be
hind the bat in the second inning, after
the latter had suffered a split finger,
handled Solomon's hurling capably.
Mulcahy and Roberts form the
strongest combination around second
base that a Stanford team has had for
some years.
The varsity will play the Redwood
City police force Tuesday afternoon
at 2:30 on the varsity diamond.

Playing through an eleven-inning
game in a fashion that entitles them to
the name of "Hitless Wonders," Coach
Wolter's varsity ball players beat the
Kenealy Seals on the varsity diamond
Saturday, by a score of 4-3.
Nineteen hits were pounded out dur
ing the afternoon, but not one of them
went for more than a single, and only
five were registered in the Stanford
column.
Solly Solomon pitched a nice game
for the varsity in spite of the fact that
fourteen hits were gathered from his
delivery. With men on liases, he tight
ened tip and was never in very great
danger. Eight of the visitors were sent
back to the bench via the strike-out
route and only two of them were given
free trips to first.
Visitors Score First.
The visitors scored the first run of
the game in the second inning. Bailey
walked, went to second on Lee's sacri
fice, and tallied on Peter's single over
first base. The Seals added one run in
the fifth and another in the sixth.
Fuller counted Stanford's first score
in the fifth on a combination of errors.
In the next stanza, with two out, Tap
son at short for the Seals, booted two
grounders in succession and allowed
May to score. Roberts got his usual
run in the seventh after he was walked.
Cuddeback. next man up, singled to
right field, Roberts crossing the plate
when Handley at third, muffed the
throw-in.
Last Innings Slow.
Neither team could squeeze in a run
during the next few innings. In Stan
ford's half of the eleventh, Lefty May
walked and moved to second on Fuller's
bunt. Both May and Fuller advanced
on an error by Peters, the visitors' sec
ond baseman. May scored on Mul
chay's sacrifice fly to left, giving the
Cardinals the winning run.
Johnston, who replaced Lawson be
hind the bat in the second inning, after
the latter had suffered a split finger,
handled Solomon's hurling capably.
Mulcahy and Roberts form the
strongest combination around second
base that a Stanford team has had for
some years.
The varsity will play the Redwood
City police force Tuesday afternoon
at 2:30 on the varsity diamond.

son at short for the Seals, booted two
grounders in succession and allowed
May to score. Roberts got his usual
run in the seventh after he was walked.
Cuddeback. next man up, singled to
right field, Roberts crossing the plate
when Handley at third, muffed the
throw-in.
Last Innings Slow.
Neither team could squeeze in a run
during the next few innings. In Stan
ford's half of the eleventh, Lefty May
walked and moved to second on Fuller's
bunt. Both May and Fuller advanced
on an error by Peters, the visitors' sec
ond baseman. May scored on Mul
chay's sacrifice fly to left, giving the
Cardinals the winning run.
Johnston, who replaced Lawson be
hind the bat in the second inning, after
the latter had suffered a split finger,
handled Solomon's hurling capably.
Mulcahy and Roberts form the
strongest combination around second
base that a Stanford team has had for
some years.
The varsity will play the Redwood
City police force Tuesday afternoon
at 2:30 on the varsity diamond.
