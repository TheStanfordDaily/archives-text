# CARDS MEET U. S. C. IN SOUTH TONIGHT
## Cardinal Freshmen Set For First Game of California Series in Berkeley Tomorrow Night 
### David Meiklejohn 
Today and tomorrow mark the turning point in Stanford
basketball hopes. The Cardinal varsity quintet meets the
University of Southern California five in the first game of the
southern series in Los Angeles tonight, and the Stanford
freshmen clash with the Bruin babe court squad in the initial
contest of the season at Berkeley tomorrow night.

Stanford's freshman aggregation has
kept its slate of records clean to
date, and has managed to nose out
every opponent by scores which in
dicate that it possesses strength
enough to give the Bear yearlings one
of their toughest tangles of the year.
Despite the fact that the California
babes have just as presentable a re
cord as their Card opponents, if not
a much better score record, there is
every reason to believe that Coach
"Husky" Hunt's '27 team has a little
edge on the Bear quintet.
In recent games the freshmen have
improved in their teamwork to a
surprising extent. Their offensive
game has become more concentrated
and less individual, as was the case
at the beginning of the season. Price
and David, who will play the forward
jobs tomorrow, are working together
like a well-oiled piece of machinery,
and the guards are learning what ef
fective team work will do in keeping
the defensive on the jump.
Nelson David has been improving
his shooting in recent games and it
is safe to say that he will be one of
the most dependable scorers tomor
row night. David is of the McHose
type. He is flashy, a good passer, and
an accurate shot in a pinch.
Price, who was recently elected cap
tain of the babe team is another de
pendable scorer. Price plays more of
a waiting game than David, and while
not so flashy as his team mate he
has been the mainstay of the squad
all season. Ha can always be counted

j Coach Andy Kerr and his varsity
quintet will carry the fight for Pacific
Coast Conference honors into the
court of the opposition tonight and
tomorrow night in a tangle with the
University of Southern California's
aggressive five at Los Angeles.
The Trojans loom as doubly danger
ous opponents on their own' court,
while the Cards remain somewhat
weakened from the California game
here last Saturday. Dave Oliva is still
suffering from the injury to his knee,
and it is doubtful if Kerr will use him
against U. S. C. unless it is absolutely
necessary.

U. S. C. Dangerous

U. S. C. proved beyond a doubt that
it is a team which must be watched
when it played the two-game series
with Stanford 011 the campus. The
games also showed that Stanford has
a recuperative power which will carry
the fight on to the last minute of play.
The Trojans are becoming more of
1 a menace to the league standings. In
a two-game series with the University
i of Arizona last Tuesday and Wednes
day, U. S. C. defeated the Wildcats
3G to 16, and 31 to 25. The desert team,
| fresh from a victory over the Cali
fornia squad the week before, offered
the Trojan quintet little in the way of
strong opposition.
Campbell Going Strong
Gordon Campbell, flashy U. S. C.for
ward, has been improving steadily
since the Stanford aeries, and he will
be one of the most formidable obsta
cles in the way of a victory for the
Cards.
Should the University of Southern
California win both contests it will
take the lead in the Conference. At
present Stanford leads the race in the
southern section with two victories
and one defeat.
U. S. C.is second with two victories
and two defeats out of four games
played, and California trails, with two
defeats and one win. If Stanford beats
the Trojans in both games, and returns
to beat California twice, its position
in the Conference would be indisputa
ble.
The line-up for otnight's game is as
follows:
Stanford U. S. C.—
McHose F Campbell
Nevers * F Boyer
Steele C Berpheide
Mcßurney G Hawkins
Oliva, Shipkey G Dorsey
ing six of the victors' seven points.
Kitow also played a fast game. Sewell,
Robison, and Harris showed good
teamwork for El Cuadro.
El Toro Weakens
The Delta Tau Delta-El Toro game
began at a fast pace. Clifford of El
Toro was the first man to find the
basket, making a field goal after about
five minutes of play. Near the middle
of the half El Toro weakened, allow
ing the Delta Taus to run up seven
points. Clifford made another field
goal, and the half ended* 7 to 4 in
favor of Delta Tau.
In the second half El Toro missed
many tries. Near the end of the game
its defense crumbled, and it allowed
Delta Tau to run up thirteen points,
making the final score 20 to 4.
Morrison, de Back, Collett, and
James shared equally in the scoring
for Delta Tau. Mixon, although he did
not score, played a fast game at guard.
Clifford and Ludeke were the out
standing men for El Toro.
El Tigre Finds Hoop
El Tigre and Delta Chi started out
well matched. El Tigre was better
able to find the basket, however, and
the bald ended in its favor, 9 to 5.
In the second period the play was
very close. Woodhead of El Tigre was
the only man to score, shooting a field
goal in the last five minutes of play.
The final score was 11 to 5 in favor of
El Tigre.
Butterfield, McKeney, and Wood
head did most of the scoring for the
winners.
