Japanese-El Cuadro Game Close
The closest game of the day was
that between the Japanese Club and

I the half.

I half, Koba. for the Japanese, tied the
score by sinking a free throw. Fol
i lowing a few minutes of close play,
1 Seymour of El Cuadro broke through
i for a goal. Soon after, Koba made one
! for the Japanese Club. With the time

upon to score when the opportunity
offers itself, his passing is accurate,
and his floor work is beyond criticism.
In "Moco" Newhouse the freshmen
have a standing guard who will likely
raise havoc with the California offen
sive. Newhouse is a heady player. He
knows at all times where to pass the
hall, and, moreover, he knows how to
get the ball away from the opposition.
He has held down his position so well
all season that Hunt has been at a
loss how to substitute for the big
fellow.
Should the freshmen revert back fo
their old weakness of individualism
they are going to meet with several
disappointments. California is report
ed to have a freshman squad whose
team work, contrary to the usual rule
of babe quintets, is its main asset.

Japanese-El Cuadro Game Close
The closest game of the day was
that between the Japanese Club and
El Cuadro. The teams were evenly
1 matched, and that fact, together with
the good guarding, kept the score
down. Before the players were fairly
j going, El Cuadro had rung up four
points and the Japanese Club three.
No scoring was done in the rest of
I the half.
Near the beginning of the second
I half, Koba. for the Japanese, tied the
score by sinking a free throw. Fol
i lowing a few minutes of close play,
1 Seymour of El Cuadro broke through
i for a goal. Soon after, Koba made one
! for the Japanese Club. With the time
nearly up, Kitow sank a free throw,
making the final score 7-6 in favor of
! the Japanese Club.
Koba starred for the winners, cag
upon to score when the opportunity
offers itself, his passing is accurate,
and his floor work is beyond criticism.
In "Moco" Newhouse the freshmen
have a standing guard who will likely
raise havoc with the California offen
sive. Newhouse is a heady player. He
knows at all times where to pass the
hall, and, moreover, he knows how to
get the ball away from the opposition.
He has held down his position so well
all season that Hunt has been at a
loss how to substitute for the big
fellow.
Should the freshmen revert back fo
their old weakness of individualism
they are going to meet with several
disappointments. California is report
ed to have a freshman squad whose
team work, contrary to the usual rule
of babe quintets, is its main asset.
