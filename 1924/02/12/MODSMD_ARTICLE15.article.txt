It is encouraging to see the increased interest students are taking in
baseball this year. Turnouts to the preliminary games thus far have
been better than at any time in the past four years.
Stanford has every reason to be proud of the team that is representing
her on the diamond this year. Coach Harry Wolter has developed an
aggregation which promises to be one of the strongest in the history of
baseball on the Farm.
The Cardinal nine has won three of its four games, the fourth ending
in a tie. Ireland's Independents, the Olympic Club, and Kenealy Seals,
three of the best teams in this part of the state have been the victims.
To Coach Wolter goes most of the credit fori the showing the team
has been making and hence for the increased interest.
