The Stanford freshman basketball team journeys to Berkeley Wednes
day night to meet the California yearlings in the first of a two-game
series.
Coach Hunt's team enters the series this year with a highly successful
preliminary season behind it. Twelve successive victories in as many
games is an excellent record.
The babes look to have an excellent chance to win from their Blue
and Gold adversaries and deserve to play before a good crowd of
Stanford rooters.

The varsity basketball team left for Los Angeles cn the Lark Sunday
night. All five of the students who were present to see them off cheered
as the train pulled out.
