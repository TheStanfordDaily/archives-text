Play Has Irish Theme
"Michael's Mother," written by Rob
ert B. Fitzgerald of the English de
partment, is a study of Irish home life
in which not only the leading charac
ters, but all others, have one problem
and one point of view. They work it
out with unusual insight and compre
hension of Irish character. The play
is serious but not. "unhappy," and
might be called "high comedy."
The other two plays which are to
be presented at the same time have
not yet been determined.

Law students at the University of
Texas are barred from student ac
tivities.
