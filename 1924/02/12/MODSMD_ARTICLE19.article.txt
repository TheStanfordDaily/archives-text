No. A—Alonzo Visits a Beauty Parlor
Alonzo breaks out again. He can't help it. It's poison oak. Alonzo tries
every cure known. None avails. Doctors can't help him. Finally, in despair, 1
Alonzo, at the advice of his little blonde Roble honey, tries a beauty parlor.
Anyway, Alonzo crashes the gate at the shop where warts are
changed into noses. At fifty cents a nose. One gent played with a
frog, went to the beauty renovator, and when he came out he could
stand in the campus postoffice and smell steak cooking in the kitchen
of the St. Francis. The queer part was that the chefs were preparing
onion soup.
Alonzo breezes up to the lady-robber in charge of the place and tells her all
about his troubles. She turns him over to the massager. The massager tells
him to take off his necktie. Alonzo goes to college and there are three things
he doesn't wear. One of them is a necktie and the other two are garters.
Anyway he takes off his necktie. Then the mud-slapper-on
flops him in a chair like the barbers have, the only difference
that it costs fifty cents to get out of a barber's chair, and
three months' allowance to break out of a chair in a beauty
parlor.
After Alonzo is comfortably seated and tied down, a pound of mud is
thrown over his face.
When the manager is sure there is enough mud
in his eyes to keep him from seeing,
she presses three thumbtacks into his ear to keep him
from feeling, and then lifts his watch and three
dollars.
The treatment is guaranteed to remove poison oak and the beauty doctors
remove everything else.
After two hours, Alonzo is declared cured. Sure enough, he is. He dis
covers the loss of his valuables. He doesn't care about the money but there
is sentiment attached to the watch. He won it in a crap game.
Does Alonzo cry out about his missing articles?
He does not.
You don't know Alonzo. While the beauty expert was scraping his face,
Alonzo bit the diamond ring oft' her finger. She never felt it. Her hands
were false, So was the diamond. But Alonzo didn't care.
He went out apd gave the diamond ~p~
to the Roble girl. —B. A.
