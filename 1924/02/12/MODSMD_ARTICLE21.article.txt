# HEAD OF JOURNAL TO RELATE EXPERIENCES
## 
### 
Andrew M. Lawrence, editor and
publisher of the San Francisco Jour
nal, will have many personal experi
ences to relate concerning his work
with the Hearst newspapers, at an
informal meeting of the American
Journalists Association Wednesday
night at the Alpha Tau Omega house.
When Lawrence was Washington
correspondent for the San Francisco
examiner he "scooped the world" by
getting into the Examiner the first
announcement of the McKinley tariff
bill. Another "scoop" he made was
the prediction of Benjamin Harrison's
nomination for the presidency on the
second ballot two days before it oc
curred.
Mr. Lawrence states that the John
son-Boynton letter which created such
a furor in national political circles by
its publication in the San Francisco
Journal was not by any means stolen
as has been charged. The Journal has
never given any explanation of how
it happened to get this letter but Mr.
Lawrence declares there is no secrecy
about the matter.
Mr. Lawrence was an executive of
the New York Journal at the time
Arthur Brisbane worked in a depart
ment of that paper and knows the
famous Hearst editorial writer inti
mately. •*

WASHINGTON—That a slab of lead
found in a back yard may show trace
of the disappearance of Virginia Dare,
the first white child born in America,
has been called to the attention of
scientists of the Smithsonian Insti
tute. When cleaned the following in
scription, apparently cut with a hot
instrument, was disclosed:
"Virginia Dare —Died here —Captis
Powhatas —1590 —Charles R."

A loan fund of $10,000 has been
placed at the disposal of the students'
loan fund committee of the University
of Kansas. No deserving student is
denied the opportunity of benefiting
from this fund.
