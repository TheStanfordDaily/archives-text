# SPORTS OF 1924
## 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Blair Guillon, of Purdue, is one of the best centers in the Western con
ference. He is a quick jumper and covers the floor in a clever manner. Coach
"Piggy" Lambert has had much success lately with his Boilermaker basketball
trams and Blair Gullion is one of the reasons.
Johnnie Talt, fast, rangy forward of the University of California five, was
chosen for the All-Pacific. Coast team the last two years.
Harold Tedford, of Idaho, although a guard, has the habit of outplaying and
outscoring his opposing forward. Harold is another instance where, when
you start getting bald, you begin to get famous. As has been said before,
"Successful men come out on top."
Capt. K. Friedmknn is center at Dartmouth, where they make 'em big and
husky. Coach Zahn puts much faith in Friedmann as a floor coVerer and
point scorer.
