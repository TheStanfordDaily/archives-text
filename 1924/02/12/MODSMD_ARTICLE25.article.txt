## 
### 
An exposp of the Stanford Chapter
of the Ku Klux Klan is the feature
article of the March Spectator, appear
ing on the campus Wednesday. Sub
terranean investigation by a staff cor
respondent has revealed some start
ling, and at the same time, laughable,
facts about the local Knights. An
intercepted letter, or, rather, a letter
which was secured through the good
offices of a person who refuses to
have his name divulged, forms the
basis of the article, and is reproduced
with the signature in the article.
"Mr. Spectator feels like a lady
with a new bonnet this issue," an
nounced the editor, referring to the
new two-color cover which encloses
the Spectator this month for the first
time. The cover is the work of Stan
ley Wheate, staff artist.
Bill Wright has taken up the task
of refuting Walter Camp's charges of
over-specialization in athletics; at
least as far as they refer to conditions
at Stanford. The attention of the fac
ulty is called to the fact that a satire
on college protervity will appear in
this issue. This is called 'Fingers of
Cloud" and was written by John Stein
back.
Dave Lamson has contributed an
other poem entitled "Two Gardens."
Dean Storey has written a compre
hensive review of "Milestones" for
this issue, and the usual number of
literary and musical reviews will be
included.
Action photographs of the five mem
bers of the basketball team, which
defeated California Saturday, are one
of the features of this number.
The Spectator is advancing a plan
by which the garage question on the
campus can be most readily solved.
According to Henry Mack, editor of
Spectator, all automobile owners
should read this editorial.
