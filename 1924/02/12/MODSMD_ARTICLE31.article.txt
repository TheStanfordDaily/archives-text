# Lightweight Quintet to Play Bruins Tomorrow
## 
### 
Touted at the first of the season as
a sure winner from California, the
Stanford 130-pound basketball team
goes up against the Blue and Gold
lightweights tomorrow night on the
wrong end of the dope.
The team is built around four vete
rans from last year's squad, but has
failed to come through in the expected
fashion. If they play up to their possi
bilities, the 130-pounders should win.
If they play the inconsistent, mediocre
basketball that they have displayed so
far, they are due to lose.
San Mateo high school and the San
Jose Y. M. C. A. teams have defeated
the Stanford lightweights. Hobro and
Meyer, forwards, have scored a total
of ten field goals in four games. Hogle,
center, has scored five. Neither one
of the guards have scored field goals.
The first game with California to
morrow night will be played at Berke
ley in Harmon gymnasium at 7 p.m.
as a preliminary to the freshman
game.

By a straw vote taken recently at
the University of Colorado, a majority
of students favor the appointment
method for the editor of the Silver
and Gold, the daily newspaper, in
stead of the election method as is
now the case.
