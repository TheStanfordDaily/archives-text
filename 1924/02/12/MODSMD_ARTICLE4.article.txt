## 
### 
"It is the control of time by a stu
dent which enables him to enter activi
ties as well as to attend to his main
work, studies. Loafing is one of the
worst difficulties that first year men
have to meet; they must learn to con
centrate." This was a statement made
by Dr. Wilbur before a freshman as
sembly in Encina last night.
The meeting was called to enable
the sponsors to take a survey of the
activities engaged in b£ the members
of the class of 1927.
"Every one has some wasteful ac
tivities such as 'gassing'," continued
Dr. Wilbur. "We have the power of se
lection to enable us to choose the right
sort of activities. Don't get into too
many things. It is hard to make a
success in life if there is not one thing
you can do well."
Following Dr. Wilbur's talk Herbert
Hoover, Jr., explained that a survey
will be taken of the activities that
each freshman is interested in. This
information will he strictly confiden
tial, going only to the sponsors and
to the coaches of the different activi
ties to enable them to keep an eye on
the work of the first-year men. The
sponsors distributed cards on which
each freshman will list the activities
in which he is interested.
Dud DeGroot explained the work
which Skull and Snakes is doing to
influence high school athletes to come
to Stanford. Formerly the funds for
this purpose wore raised by a jolly-up
held by the honor society each year,
but from now on each man enrolled
in the University will be asked to con
tribute a dollar to the cause. All the
money obtained will be used to mail
Stanford publications and literature
to California high schools.
