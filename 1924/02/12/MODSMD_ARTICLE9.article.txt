# RAM'S HEAD TICKET RUSH STARTS TOMORROW NOON
## "Merchant of Menace" Nears Perfection As Practice Becomes Concentrated 
### 
Tomorrow at 12:50 p.m., the big
Ram's Head rush begins in the Ad
ministration building. Drawings for
seats will start sharply at that time.
Possibilities for roughs' seats are
slight, according to Delmer Daves,
dramatic manager, since previous
campus girlie shows have always
hung out the S. R. O. sign.
Through four acts of broad bur
lesque "The Merchant of Menace"
parodies the Shakesperian master
piece, using all the English 4 stand
bys as gags to beguile the audience.
Even the quality of mercy is not
strained from the piece and many
other famous passages and lines are
lvmodeled to suit the funnybones of
the authors.
Last night the court room scene was
put together and run through with
chorus, sets, props, and Duke Gunther
presiding on the bench. Shylock came
to demand his flesh and was about to
collect when Portia entered to save
the day. After a moving speech she
took charge of affairs and started to
present the loophole through which
Antonio could escape. But just then
the night watchman came in and
turned out the lights, leaving the solu
tion in the dark.
It has been rumored about the As
sembly hall recently that on the night
of the show a prologue will be shot on
the stage to give the play a send-off
with a recoil. An interview with Di
rector Trago failed to bring out any
thing other than such a thing might
happen and it may or may not be
Shakesperian.
From now on both chorus and cast

will be rehearsing afternoon and night
so that Friday's performance will look
like Ziegfield's show at the end of a
six months' run. Oh yes, the chorus
costumes are the real stuff this time
and do not try to follow out the lines
usually adopted for the more modest
Junior Opera spectacles. Some of them
really are discarded Follies lace de
nothings.
