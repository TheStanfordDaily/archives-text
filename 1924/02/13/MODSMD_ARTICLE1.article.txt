# FRESHMAN FIVE TO OPEN BEAR SERIES TONIGHT
## Odds in Favor of Undefeated Redshirts; Cubs Have Been Beaten Twice 
### 
The undefeated freshman hoop
squad left at noon today for Berkeley
where it will tangle with the Bruin
Cubs tonight in Harmon gymnasium.
Twelve men made the trip.
Odds favor the Stanford team. It
completed the preliminary schedule
last Saturday by defeating Livermore
26 to 24. This game was the twelfth
straight victory for the freshmen. The
Blue and Gold team, on the other
liand. lias been defeated twice, by
Berkeley and Piedmont.
Frosh Have Disadvantages
Since the game is at Berkeley, the
freshmen will be at a disadvantage,
because all of their games have been
played in the pavilion. A strange floor
and different backboards may have an
upsetting effect on the Babes, but it is
hardly possible that this can prove to
he a deciding factor.
In their games to date the freshmen
at California have not shown a great
deal of teamwork. Shifts in lineup and
substitutions have been frequent, in
an effort,to find the best combination,
and as a result their scores have suf
fered. If the Bear forwards get going
tomorrow, and the teamwork shows,
it may mean defeat for the Redshirts.
Robie. who thrilled Stanford fans
last year when Piedmont played the
192tj squad, is one of the forwards on
the California five. Robie tossed in
eight field goals from the center of
the floor in the game he played in the
pavilion.
La Rue Best Scorer
La Rue, the other forward, has been
outscoring Robie in most of the games.
His work is consistent. The defense
