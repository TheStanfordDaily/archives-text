# SOLVE ISSUES BY RELIGION
## Preacher Advises Dominance of Church In Settlement of World Problems 
### Beatrice Flesher 
IF" religion does not concern itself with world problems, other agencies will
solve the questions, and religion will he left behind, so says the Rev. G.
Bromley Oxnam, of the Church of All Nations in Los Angeles,

The Rev. Mr. Oxnam has just re
turned to the United States after a
trip around the world, and finds that
the three great modern problems
which need study are the interna
! tional, industrial, and racial issues.
He says that the church in Europe
is facing a serious crisis, but that the
religious situation in the United States
is not as bad as in other countries,
the country as a whole did not suffer
during the war, and therefore, the in
stitutional forms of religion are pro
gressing.
"Religion, viewed as a body of ethi
cal concepts," he says, "is strong the
world over." As typical of the position
of the church, however, he quotes

j Ramsay Mac Donald, British prime
minister, as saying that he had spent
1 ilmost as much time organizing work
! in the church as he had on the labor
party and its movement, but that now
I lie no longer occupied himself with
! the church. He exclaimed. "The
church has forfeited the confidence of
men of sincerity. If I returned to it,
T should not feel assured that T was
[ not aiding an organization to re-
I crucify Christ."
To survive, the church must take
the ethics of Jesus seriously, and for
get the petty conflicts over creed, ac
cording to Oxnam. who condemns the
arguments now in progress between
the fundamentalists and modernists.
"They discuss matters which were not
vital to Jesus, and had no interest for
him. If they would progress, they
should get down to essentials, and re
member the brotherhood of man."
The six principles advocated by the
Rev. Mr. Oxnam, for aid in carrying
out his ideals, are that men and not
things should be the goal of social
living, that the solidarity of the hu
man family should be maintained, that
the common good be supreme, that all
should have equal rights, that co-opera
tion and not selfish competition should
be the law of progress, and that love
and not force should constitute the
social bond.

Oxnam delivered a sermon in the
Memorial Church February 3 on the
subject of the relation of the Christian
students to international affairs. In
this, he expressed his hope that it
would be through the influence of the
keen thinker and student that the in
ternational issue would be finally set
tled.
The difficulty of reform, and better
ing of conditions the world over, were
illustrated when he cited the indus
trial situation in Shanghai factories.
He had visited the factory of one of
the Americans, and had contained
of ihe terrible conditions under which
the workmen were laboring. He found
out, however, that it was impossible
for improvements to be made without
having the other American and Euro
pean competitors put the man out of
business by their continued bad condi
tions, greater profits, and lower prices.
He urged that the United States send
men to the Orient who practice Chris
tian ideals if Americans expect to
have the natives learn Christianity.

IF" religion does not concern itself with world problems, other agencies will
solve the questions, and religion will he left behind, so says the Rev. G.
Bromley Oxnam, of the Church of All Nations in Los Angeles,

The Rev. Mr. Oxnam has just re
turned to the United States after a
trip around the world, and finds that
the three great modern problems
which need study are the interna
! tional, industrial, and racial issues.
He says that the church in Europe
is facing a serious crisis, but that the
religious situation in the United States
is not as bad as in other countries,
the country as a whole did not suffer
during the war, and therefore, the in
stitutional forms of religion are pro
gressing.
"Religion, viewed as a body of ethi
cal concepts," he says, "is strong the
world over." As typical of the position
of the church, however, he quotes

j Ramsay Mac Donald, British prime
minister, as saying that he had spent
1 ilmost as much time organizing work
! in the church as he had on the labor
party and its movement, but that now
I lie no longer occupied himself with
! the church. He exclaimed. "The
church has forfeited the confidence of
men of sincerity. If I returned to it,
T should not feel assured that T was
[ not aiding an organization to re-
I crucify Christ."
To survive, the church must take
the ethics of Jesus seriously, and for
get the petty conflicts over creed, ac
cording to Oxnam. who condemns the
arguments now in progress between
the fundamentalists and modernists.
"They discuss matters which were not
vital to Jesus, and had no interest for
him. If they would progress, they
should get down to essentials, and re
member the brotherhood of man."
The six principles advocated by the
Rev. Mr. Oxnam, for aid in carrying
out his ideals, are that men and not
things should be the goal of social
living, that the solidarity of the hu
man family should be maintained, that
the common good be supreme, that all
should have equal rights, that co-opera
tion and not selfish competition should
be the law of progress, and that love
and not force should constitute the
social bond.

Oxnam delivered a sermon in the
Memorial Church February 3 on the
subject of the relation of the Christian
students to international affairs. In
this, he expressed his hope that it
would be through the influence of the
keen thinker and student that the in
ternational issue would be finally set
tled.
The difficulty of reform, and better
ing of conditions the world over, were
illustrated when he cited the indus
trial situation in Shanghai factories.
He had visited the factory of one of
the Americans, and had contained
of ihe terrible conditions under which
the workmen were laboring. He found
out, however, that it was impossible
for improvements to be made without
having the other American and Euro
pean competitors put the man out of
business by their continued bad condi
tions, greater profits, and lower prices.
He urged that the United States send
men to the Orient who practice Chris
tian ideals if Americans expect to
have the natives learn Christianity.
