# CARD BOXERS TO MEET DAVIS FARM TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford and Davis Farm boxers are
I carded to meet in their annual boxing
j tourney tomorrow night in Encina
j gymnasium at 7:30.
Willie Ritchie, former light-heavy-
J weight champion of the world, has
; consented to act as third man in the
1 ling.
Aggies Weaker This Year
The Aggies are slightly weakened
i this season. Taking seven out of four
i teen contests last year, they appeared
I to have the edge on the Cardinals but
! loss of three hard punchers
through ineligibility and graduation
has caused their stock to take a down-
I ward slide this year.
Coach Harry Malonev, on the other
; hand, has developed a well-balanced
and efficient team.
i The veterans of last year have all
shown marked improvement and the
new men undoubtedly have much abil
ity, as brought out in the recent
| elimination bouts.
Armbruster Outstanding Man
| Earl Armbruster, weighing in as a
! featherweight, is perhaps the out
! standing man of the Stanford aggre
! gation. He holds the Pacific Coast
featherweight championship through
his decisive victory last year over
Farlow, of U, S. C. Armbruster won
both bouts with Davis Farm the same
season, and bids fair to repeat the
performance tomorrow.
"Jake" Irwin, middleweight, has the
enviable record of no defeats in hi 3
entire career of intercollegiate corn
petition. His wins last year over the
Davis Farm competition were accom
plished by clever exhibitions of real
boxing and Maloney reports him much
improved this season.
Simmons Speedy
Bradford Simmons, boxing as a ban
tamweight, shows the characteristic
speed of his class. He is a varsity man
although not out last year and will
take Freedman's plffce as representa
tive in the 118-pound division.
Elbert Harward, entered in the
lightweight class, is not a varsity

regular, but displayed such ability in
the elimination tournament last week
that Maloney is placing his bet on
him tomorrow.
