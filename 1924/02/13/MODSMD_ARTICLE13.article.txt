# STANFORD LOSES CLOSE GAME TO WANS. 24-20
## Card Five Leads 13 to 6 at First Half; Rice Stars For U. S. C. 
### 
University of Southern California's
quintet came from behind in the last
few minutes of play and defeated the
Stanford varsity five 24 to 20 in the
first game of the Trojan series in Los
Angeles last night.
"Cot" Rice, who was substituted for
Gordon Campbell, U. S. C. forward,
was the star of the gam 6. He staged
one of the most spectacular come
backs which has ever been seen on a
southern basketball court, and turned
what looked like certain defeat for the
Trojans into a decisive victory.
Stanford was leading at the end of
the first half by 13 to 6. Everything
pointed to a Cardinal victory until
Rice began to score a flurry of points
which gradually ate up the Stanford
lead, overcame it, and gave U. S. C.
a lead which the Cards could not sur
mount.
Campbell dislocated a shoulder in
the first five minutes of play, and was
taken from the game in a serious con
dition.
Ernie Nevers and Mcßurney starred
for the Stanford squad. Nevers scored
seven of the Stanford points, and Mc-
Burney broke into the totals by adding
five markers. Nevers' dribbling was
something which few southern sup
porters had ever seen. He busted his
way through the opposition with a
force which swept everything before
him.
Dave Oliva did not start the game
for Stanford at standing guard. Harry
Shipkey, who replaced Oliva, was
taken from the game because of per
sonal fouls, and Mitchell was substi
tuted for Shipkey. Both substitutions
greatly weakened the Cardinal de
fense, and the U. S. C. plays worked
with ease around the weak spot, giv
ing the Trojan forwards no end cf
opportunities for scores.
U. S. C. lost all hope of victory upon
the substitution of Rice for Campbell,
and the supporters settled down to
witness one of the most efficient
slaughters of the season. Stanford did
not disappoint them in the first half.
When Campbell was taken from the
game, the Cards led 5 to 1. Stanford
increased the score at will during the
remainder of the half, piling up a 13
to 6 lead without difficulty.
The two squads play again tonight
in the second game of the series. The
game this evening determines whether
Stanford has lost all hope of winning
the Conference championship.
It is doubtful if Dave Oliva will be
allowed to enter the game tonight.
His knee is still in bad shape, and it
j is not likely that Kerr will sacrifice
him in view of the coming California
contest next Saturday.

opportunities for scores.
U. S. C. lost all hope of victory upon
the substitution of Rice for Campbell,
and the supporters settled down to
witness one of the most efficient
slaughters of the season. Stanford did
not disappoint them in the first half.
When Campbell was taken from the
game, the Cards led 5 to 1. Stanford
increased the score at will during the
remainder of the half, piling up a 13
to 6 lead without difficulty.
The two squads play again tonight
in the second game of the series. The
game this evening determines whether
Stanford has lost all hope of winning
the Conference championship.
It is doubtful if Dave Oliva will be
allowed to enter the game tonight.
His knee is still in bad shape, and it
j is not likely that Kerr will sacrifice
him in view of the coming California
contest next Saturday.

University of Southern California's
quintet came from behind in the last
few minutes of play and defeated the
Stanford varsity five 24 to 20 in the
first game of the Trojan series in Los
Angeles last night.
"Cot" Rice, who was substituted for
Gordon Campbell, U. S. C. forward,
was the star of the gam 6. He staged
one of the most spectacular come
backs which has ever been seen on a
southern basketball court, and turned
what looked like certain defeat for the
Trojans into a decisive victory.
Stanford was leading at the end of
the first half by 13 to 6. Everything
pointed to a Cardinal victory until
Rice began to score a flurry of points
which gradually ate up the Stanford
lead, overcame it, and gave U. S. C.
a lead which the Cards could not sur
mount.
Campbell dislocated a shoulder in
the first five minutes of play, and was
taken from the game in a serious con
dition.
Ernie Nevers and Mcßurney starred
for the Stanford squad. Nevers scored
seven of the Stanford points, and Mc-
Burney broke into the totals by adding
five markers. Nevers' dribbling was
something which few southern sup
porters had ever seen. He busted his
way through the opposition with a
force which swept everything before
him.
Dave Oliva did not start the game
for Stanford at standing guard. Harry
Shipkey, who replaced Oliva, was
taken from the game because of per
sonal fouls, and Mitchell was substi
tuted for Shipkey. Both substitutions
greatly weakened the Cardinal de
fense, and the U. S. C. plays worked
with ease around the weak spot, giv
ing the Trojan forwards no end cf
opportunities for scores.
