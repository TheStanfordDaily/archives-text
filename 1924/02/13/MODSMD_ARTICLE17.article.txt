Hats off to the two Harrys !
While Harry Wolter's varsity baseball team was treating the Red
wood City Police to a fine lacing, Harry Maloney's varsity and freshman
soccer teams were dealing out a double trouncing to their respective op
ponents from California.
Wolter's team looks more like a real ball club with every game. He
has put a world of confidence and baseball knowledge into his charges and
they are beginning to show the results.
Maloney's soccer teams came back strong yesterday. Ihe varsity lost
to its Blue and Gold opponents last quarter largely because of the ab
sence from the lineup of four of its stfongest players. The best the fresh
men could do in the last game, was to tie with the California yearlings.
Stanford is fortunate in having two men like Harry Wolter and Harry
Maloney on her coaching staff.
