Anyone who operates an automobile between Palo Alto and San Fran
cisco cannot help but note with a feeling of satisfaction that steps have
l>een taken to improve traffic conditions on the Peninsula highway south of
San Francisco.
At a conference called last week by the California State Automobile
Association, a definite program was laid down. The most encouraging
thing that came out of this conference was the pledge by bus companies
that improper driving methods and violations of motor vehicle laws would
be discontinued.
The public safety committee of two hundred Peninsula residents
which will be formed soon will be watched with interest. In spite of the
fact that the Peninsula highway has been widened to forty feet, there is
still plenty to do to make it a safe place on which to drive an automobile.
From the way a few speed maniacs have been driving around the
campus lately, maybe some such committee, functioning properly, would
not be amiss at Stanford.
Two more days until the Ram's Head show.
Why criticise people for a pessimistic attitude, hasn't Nature made a
mountain out of a Thornhill.
