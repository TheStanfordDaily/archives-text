DAYS in the LIVES of GREAT MEN
No. s—Alonzo Studies
Alonzo has a mid-quarter. There's
nothing amazing in that statement.
All of us have mid-quarters. It's
Alonzo's method of attack that is dif
ferent. (SO Different.)
But then, Alonzo is original in many
things. Alonzo wears red neckties for
mourning. Alonzo's not afraid of bulls.
Not the kind that grow in pastures.
And the kind that comes in sacks!
He inhales those. Like all of us,
Alonzo is a little leary of the species
that have big feet and carry handcuffs.
He's not afraid of them. He just eases
away when one of them appears on
the horizon.
But Alonzo has wandered away from
his mid-quarter. Even as you and I.
Alonzo's a darned hard boy to control.
It's hard to tell what he'll do next.
I can't. And I write him.
Alonzo goes to the library. Reaches
the outside at eight o'clock and de
cides to have just one more cigarette
before going in for two hours' hard
work. Takes him ten minutes to bum
one. And five minutes to smoke it.
The chimes ring the quarter hour.
Alonzo climbs the stairs to the read
ing room.
Looks about and decides that the
best-looking girl is sitting away down
at the table. Carries books to said
table. Girl has on one of these trick
hats. You know the kind. You have
to sit on the floor to see what her
face looks like. Or cough and make
her look up. Alonzo coughs. Girl looks
up.
Alonzo decides if she is the prettiest
girl there, that he is Apollo. Picks his
books up and moves. Not fast. But he
moves.
It's now eight-thirty.
Alonzo finds a vacant table, around
which ten other chairs are lined. De
cides the odds are five to one that a
girl will take a seat there. And that
the odds are ten to one that she'll be
a honey. And that the odds are twenty
to one that if she is a honey, she'll
speak to him. Takes a gambling
chance and sits down.
Alonzo studies until nine. Feels
overworked and goes down for an
other smoke. Only takes five minutes
to find one this time. So he takes ten
minutes to smoke it.
Goes back to study. Studies ten min
utes. Sees his Roble blonde. Hails her
for a date. Fixes it up. Walks home
with her. Leaves her.
Makes his way homeward. Gets up
next morning with a guilty conscience.
Knows he hasn't studied. Goes to mid
quarter.
Looks at the ex. Does he hand in a
blank blue-book? You don't know
Alonzo. He knocks the ex for a loop.
Even as you and I. —B. A.

Not the kind that grow in pastures.
And the kind that comes in sacks!
He inhales those. Like all of us,
Alonzo is a little leary of the species
that have big feet and carry handcuffs.
He's not afraid of them. He just eases
away when one of them appears on
the horizon.
But Alonzo has wandered away from
his mid-quarter. Even as you and I.
Alonzo's a darned hard boy to control.
It's hard to tell what he'll do next.
I can't. And I write him.
Alonzo goes to the library. Reaches
the outside at eight o'clock and de
cides to have just one more cigarette
before going in for two hours' hard
work. Takes him ten minutes to bum
one. And five minutes to smoke it.
The chimes ring the quarter hour.
Alonzo climbs the stairs to the read
ing room.
Looks about and decides that the
best-looking girl is sitting away down
at the table. Carries books to said
table. Girl has on one of these trick
hats. You know the kind. You have
to sit on the floor to see what her
face looks like. Or cough and make
her look up. Alonzo coughs. Girl looks
up.
Alonzo decides if she is the prettiest
girl there, that he is Apollo. Picks his
books up and moves. Not fast. But he
moves.
It's now eight-thirty.
Alonzo finds a vacant table, around
which ten other chairs are lined. De
cides the odds are five to one that a
girl will take a seat there. And that
the odds are ten to one that she'll be
a honey. And that the odds are twenty
to one that if she is a honey, she'll
speak to him. Takes a gambling
chance and sits down.
Alonzo studies until nine. Feels
overworked and goes down for an
other smoke. Only takes five minutes
to find one this time. So he takes ten
minutes to smoke it.
Goes back to study. Studies ten min
utes. Sees his Roble blonde. Hails her
for a date. Fixes it up. Walks home
with her. Leaves her.
Makes his way homeward. Gets up
next morning with a guilty conscience.
Knows he hasn't studied. Goes to mid
quarter.
Looks at the ex. Does he hand in a
blank blue-book? You don't know
Alonzo. He knocks the ex for a loop.
Even as you and I. —B. A.

Alonzo has a mid-quarter. There's
nothing amazing in that statement.
All of us have mid-quarters. It's
Alonzo's method of attack that is dif
ferent. (SO Different.)
But then, Alonzo is original in many
things. Alonzo wears red neckties for
mourning. Alonzo's not afraid of bulls.
Not the kind that grow in pastures.
