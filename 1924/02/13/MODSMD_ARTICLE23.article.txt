Don't bet with your friends as to who
the criminal is, or you'll surely lose, j
It is not often that such good pic- i
tures are shown In Palo Alto. This
one has an excellent plot with interest
that is intense, climax after climax, i
good acting, and a swift and rapid
denouement that takes you off your j
feet. It is the type of picture which, !
according to Palo Alto theatre mana-1

acting has much to do with the high
pitch of interest reached throughout!

well done and is very realistic. Run-j
ning true to form, there's a bailiff
with the proverbial chewing tobacco |
and cuspidor.
