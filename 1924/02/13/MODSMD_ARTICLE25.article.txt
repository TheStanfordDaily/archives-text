# monotypes; WATER COLOR WORK TO BE SHOWN ON CAMPUS
## Quaint Sketches, Drawings, Form Interesting Art Gallery Exhibit 
### Allene Thorpe 
Monotypes and water color sketches
by two California artists will be placed
on exhibition at the Art Gallery Sun
day.
The collection of water colors was
made by Miss Enid Kinney of San
Jose, and the monotypes are the work
of a Berkeley artist, Miss Shirley Wil
liamson.
Miss Kinney recently returned from
a trip to Europe where she painted in
localities famous as artists' sketching
grounds. Some of the sketches were
made in the fishing villages of Corn
wall, on the English coast. While she
was there, she found that the inter
ested children, who watched her at
work, used many-syllabled art phrases
which they had picked up from hear
ing artists talking together.
Quaint Paintings Displayed
One of her sketches shows the
quaint village of St. Ives which was
made famous by the old-time nursery
rhyme. According to Miss Kinney's
account of the place, the town still
harbors the seven cats, but the man
with seven wives seems to have dis
appeared.
Several sketches from the French
village of La Rochelle show the bril
liantly-colored sails seen in that lo
cality. The fishermen mix their paint
with some sort of a paraffin which
enables the sails to be easily furled
after being painted. The sight of a
fleet of these boats with the pictur
esque sails is not an unusual sight.
Miss Kinney's paintings, some thirty
in all, are done in a direct manner,
displaying spontaneity and brilliancy
of color. The quality of being "done
in the open" seems to pervade the
whole exhibition.
Monotypes Are Interesting
In the other gallery is shown a col
lection of monotypes by Miss William
son, who has been identified with the
activities of Berkeley and the
University of California. The exhibi
tion gives the observer a good oppor
tunity to study this type of print.
Monotypes are so named because
only one or two prints are obtainable
from the original. Monotypes are made
by directly painting in oils U]§on a
piece of metal, and transferring this
painting to a sheet of damp paper, by
running it through a hand press. If a
second impression is desired, the art
ist paints the picture again over the
faint image remaining on the metal
and makes a second proof.
Occasionally, monotypes are printed
on to canvas or burlap and transferred
to the paper as in the case of "Fog,"
done by Miss Williamson. This method
gives the print the quality of an oil
painting done on canvas. The exhibi
tion contains a wide variation of color
notes, many being in monochrome,
others in rich color scheme?.
Both exhibitions will be open to the
public until March 2.

The collection of water colors was
made by Miss Enid Kinney of San
Jose, and the monotypes are the work
of a Berkeley artist, Miss Shirley Wil
liamson.
Miss Kinney recently returned from
a trip to Europe where she painted in
localities famous as artists' sketching
grounds. Some of the sketches were
made in the fishing villages of Corn
wall, on the English coast. While she
was there, she found that the inter
ested children, who watched her at
work, used many-syllabled art phrases
which they had picked up from hear
ing artists talking together.
Quaint Paintings Displayed
One of her sketches shows the
quaint village of St. Ives which was
made famous by the old-time nursery
rhyme. According to Miss Kinney's
account of the place, the town still
harbors the seven cats, but the man
with seven wives seems to have dis
appeared.
Several sketches from the French
village of La Rochelle show the bril
liantly-colored sails seen in that lo
cality. The fishermen mix their paint
with some sort of a paraffin which
enables the sails to be easily furled
after being painted. The sight of a
fleet of these boats with the pictur
esque sails is not an unusual sight.
Miss Kinney's paintings, some thirty
in all, are done in a direct manner,
displaying spontaneity and brilliancy
of color. The quality of being "done
in the open" seems to pervade the
whole exhibition.
Monotypes Are Interesting
In the other gallery is shown a col
lection of monotypes by Miss William
son, who has been identified with the
activities of Berkeley and the
University of California. The exhibi
tion gives the observer a good oppor
tunity to study this type of print.
Monotypes are so named because
only one or two prints are obtainable
from the original. Monotypes are made
by directly painting in oils U]§on a
piece of metal, and transferring this
painting to a sheet of damp paper, by
running it through a hand press. If a
second impression is desired, the art
ist paints the picture again over the
faint image remaining on the metal
and makes a second proof.
Occasionally, monotypes are printed
on to canvas or burlap and transferred
to the paper as in the case of "Fog,"
done by Miss Williamson. This method
gives the print the quality of an oil
painting done on canvas. The exhibi
tion contains a wide variation of color
notes, many being in monochrome,
others in rich color scheme?.
Both exhibitions will be open to the
public until March 2.
Monotypes and water color sketches
by two California artists will be placed
on exhibition at the Art Gallery Sun
day.
