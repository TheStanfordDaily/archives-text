### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Nick Altrock, the well-known baseball comedian, is touring the country with
a professional basketball team, the "Holly Majors." Since Nick has complained
that ordinary basketball plays are too complicated for him to understand,
SPORTS OP 1924 submits the accompanying chart illustrating a simple, but
effective play, especially well adapted for correspondence school teams.
The play calls for a backward tip-off by No. 3, the center, to No. 5, the
offensive guard. He can be made all the more offensive by sticking his
finger in his opponent's eye, as he dashes for the ball. When about three
strides away from SX, the opposing guard, he presents his back and his
compliments to the referee and shakes hands with forward No. 1, stealthily
giving him the ball as he does so. No. 1 throws a long pass to No. 4, who is
hiding in the bleachers disguised as an usher, and he climbs up over the
back of the basket and grounds the ball from the aerial. Score —Altrock, 7 —
Opponents, minus 11.
