## Bailard Stars as Yearlings Win Second Contest From Blue and Gold Frosh Eleven, 3 to 1 
### Paul Wayte 
A rejuvenated Stanford soccer team
tied the series between Stanford and
California yesterday by defeating the
Blue and Gold aggregation, 5 to 2, on
i the Cardinal field. The rresiiman team
i won its series by defeating the Cali
j fornia yearlings 3 to 1.
Greatly strengthened by four vete
| rans who were ineligible to play last
quarter, the Cardinal eleven showed
| considerable class, outplaying and out
fighting their rivals during the greater
: part of the game. It was a different
team from the one which was de
i feated 4 to 3 by California last quar
j ter.
The game started off with a bang,
i Dwight kicking a goal before the

1 game had progressed a minute, but he j
was called offside and the goal failed j
to count. During the next four rain- j
utes the ball was in Stanford terri-1
tory. Rogers, goal-keeper, prevented j
; California from scoring twice during 1
this time by excellent blocking.
During the latter part of the first
half, when California was playing the
ball close to the Stanford goal, Thie- i
baut, playing inside left, kicked the i
ball low for a goal. Rogers, Stanford ,
goal-keeper, was blinded by the sun
and his attempt to block it was un- j
successful. Miron, playing center for
ward for the Cardinals, kicked a goal ;
a few minutes before. The score at 1
half period was 1 to 1.
During the first five minutes of the |
second half Howe was given a free |
kick and Franklin scored from the !
center of the field on the pass. Before j
the half had ended Franklin had shot
two goals and Dwight one. Captain de
, Sousa, outside left of California, also
succeeded in scoring a goal during
the latter half.
C. A. Miron, Ted Off, "Porky"
Dwight, and "Pete" Franklin, the re
turned veterans, all played a good j
game. Mumford and Clark at fullback,
Rogers at goal, tlid some good de
fensive work during the game. Captain
Swayne played his usual game at out
side right. Although he did not make
any score himself his offensive work
was brilliant.
The line-up: Rogers, goal; Clark,
right back; Mumford, left back; J.
Franklin, right half; Howe, center
half; Off, left half; Swayne, outside
right; Dwight, inside right; Miron,
center forward; P. Franklin, inside

A rejuvenated Stanford soccer team
tied the series between Stanford and
California yesterday by defeating the
Blue and Gold aggregation, 5 to 2, on
i the Cardinal field. The rresiiman team
i won its series by defeating the Cali
j fornia yearlings 3 to 1.
Greatly strengthened by four vete
| rans who were ineligible to play last
quarter, the Cardinal eleven showed
| considerable class, outplaying and out
fighting their rivals during the greater
: part of the game. It was a different
team from the one which was de
i feated 4 to 3 by California last quar
j ter.
The game started off with a bang,
i Dwight kicking a goal before the

1 game had progressed a minute, but he j
was called offside and the goal failed j
to count. During the next four rain- j
utes the ball was in Stanford terri-1
tory. Rogers, goal-keeper, prevented j
; California from scoring twice during 1
this time by excellent blocking.
During the latter part of the first
half, when California was playing the
ball close to the Stanford goal, Thie- i
baut, playing inside left, kicked the i
ball low for a goal. Rogers, Stanford ,
goal-keeper, was blinded by the sun
and his attempt to block it was un- j
successful. Miron, playing center for
ward for the Cardinals, kicked a goal ;
a few minutes before. The score at 1
half period was 1 to 1.
