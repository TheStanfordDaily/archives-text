# WACE TELLS OF FINDS IN ANCIENT MYCENAE
## 
### 
"We know more about the history of
Grecian civilization today than the
Greeks did in the time of Pericles,"
said Director Allen John Bayard Wace
of the British School of Archaeology
at Athens, last evening in his talk on
the recent important archaeological
discoveries of Mycenae.
Wace described the last four years'
work, at which he was present, and
showed slides of the restorations at
Mycenae, which he said was not a
city, but a fortified castle of a king,
high on a citadel, and surrounded by
members of the court.
Work Follows Schliemann's
During these last years, it was the |
purpose of the excavators to carry on
the ideals of Schliemann, who, at the
end of the last century, found the
sites of Troy and Mycenae, thereby
furnishing an historical background
for the works of Homer, and taking
Grecian history back a thousand years
earlier, to the sixteenth century B.C.
Director Wace noted that the re
discovery of the ancient East, and the '
early Bronze Age of man has been j
; made during the last 100' years.
Lion Gate Remarkable
In describing the Lion Gate, one of
1 the recent discoveries, Wace stressed I
the remarkable fact that the imple- j
' ments of bronze were the only ones i
available for the work of lifting the
huge stones of at least one ton.
"Moving Cyclopean blocks without
the aid of a Cyclops was not an easy
task," said Wace, in telling of his
J difficulties as an excavator.
j The lions over the gatepost, mod
! eled out of heavy stone, are the ear
! liest piece of Greek sculpture in hard
1 stone found in Greece.
Pottery Shows Age of Graves
The pottery found within the graves
; proves their date. In one of the royal
graves was found a silver vase clearly ,
typifying Homeric customs. It is a
battle scene in which the men are j
: fighting the foe from the open ground
in front of the citadel, while the wo
-1 men are encouraging them from the
I walls.
' About the work done in restoring
the palace itself, Wace said. "We en
deavored to use only good Mycenean
evidence for our restorations, and this
evidence was sometimes a piece of
fresco, which may have been from the
walls, which were covered by painted
stucco. This is another indication of
Homeric custom.
Tomb Digging Is Lottery
The cemetery near Mycenae is im
! portant, because in it is buried an
uninterrupted family line dating from
i thf> sixteenth to the twelfth century
1 B.C.
"Tomb digging is like marriage—it
: is a lottery," said Wace, as he ex- i
plained the thrill that comes to the
archaeologist when he is about to
| open a tomb, and does not know !
, whether lie will find valuable material
or mere heaps of bones. The pottery
j found in the tombs is most important,
tcp"°ther with the other relics, like
I beads and seals, for they indicate the
• time of burial, and show pictures in
: dicative of the life of the times.
