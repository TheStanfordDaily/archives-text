# LARGE NUMBER TURN OUT FOR WASHINGTON CREW

"I am extremely pessimistic about
the California race," says Coach Callow,
mentor of the University of Washing
ton crew. This statement is made de
spite the fact that more than 175 men
have turned out for crew practice. Five
freshmen crews were sent out for a
workout, while enough material was on
hand for eight varsity shells at the
first turnout last week.
