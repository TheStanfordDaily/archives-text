# VARSITY NINE WINS OVER REDWOOD 8-0
## Milton Teague Gives Police Batters Only One Hit; Infield Is Strong 
### 
With Milt Teague pitching a beauti
ful game and allowing the strong Red
wood Police ball team only one hit
and two to second base, won its fourth
contest of the season, 8 to 0, on the
varsity diamond yesterday.
Cards Waste No Time
Stanford wasted no time in starting
and put over two runs in the second
after two men were out. Mulchay
walked and advanced to third on
Teague's single. Roberts, with another
single, brought both men in. From
then on it was all Stanford, Teague
sending the cops back to the bench
about as fast as they came up.
Coach Wolter's men went after runs
in the fourth inning and collected two
more, accounted for three in the sev
enth, and added another for good
measure in the eighth.
Redwood Hits in Fifth
Redwood's lone hit came in the
fifth, when Richie hooked one over
Cuddeback's head. Casey, next man
up, pounded a hot one to Cuddeback
only to have it start a double play,
Cuddeback to Roberts t > Woodward.
The whole Stanford ball club looked
mighty sweet yesterday, with team
work evident throughout. Johnston
handled everything Teague could
throw and proved that he is a valuable
man either in the outfield or behind
the bat.
Brown Looks Good
Brown, playing in his first varsity
game, looks to be about the best of
Wolter's gardeners. McCandless came
through with three bingles and scored
one of Stanford's eight runs. Fuller
fielded his position well but couldn't
knock the ball out of the infield when
at bat.
Stanford Infield Improved
Stanford's inner defense looks bet
ter in every game. Roberts nicked the
Redwood hurlers for four hits and
participated in one double play. Cud
deback on third, Mulchay at short, and
Woodward at first, worked together as
a machine.
