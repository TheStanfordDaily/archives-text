# EDITOR, PUBLISHER OF SAN FRANCISCO JOURNAL TO SPEAK
## 
### 
The theory of sane Journalism will
be developed by Andrew M. Lawrence,
editor and publisher of the San Fran
cisco Journal, in his informal talk to
the American Journalists Association
at the Alpha Tau Omega house at
7:30 tonight.
Lawrence explains that his object is
to run the San Francisco Journal on
conservative, non-sensational lines and
print all the news that is fit to read.
Lawrence purchased the San Fran
cisco Journal of Commerce, which was
a strictly business men's publication,
about four years ago, and later ex
panded it and changed it into a gen
eral newspaper. His wide experience
as a correspondent and executive of
Hearst publications qualifies him to
give many interesting side-lights on
newspaper work.
All those interested in journalism
are invit-ed to attend the ipeeting.
