# CARDS TRIM U.S.C.; BABES BEAT CUBS
## FRESHMEN TAKE THIRTEENTH GAME, TROUNCING BEAR CUBS 29 TO 22 IN ROUGH BATTLE 
### Wallace Knox 
/MVING a brilliant exhibition of smooth teamwork, the Stanford freshmen
" trampled over the Bear Cubs last night 29 to 22. This victory marks the
thirteenth consecutive wiu for the yearlings, and since it came on the
thirteenth of tlve month, the numerals i 3 will be taken as ISKZI's lucky figure
for the rest of the season.
The refereelng was poor and as a result considerable rotighness marred
the work of the players. Newhouse, Stanford's 232-pou!ftid standing guard,
was taken from the game towards the last of the second half because of
having an excessive number of personal fouls called on him. Joseph took
his place for th-e remainder of the game.
The Berkeley five took the lead at the start of the game when Healv,

running guard, evaded Coach "Husky"
Hunt's guards long enough to make a
field goal. Stanford came back and
evened things a minute later. From
this time on the Blue and Gold team
■was trailing the Redshirts. The only
time that the Cubs threatened was
toward the middle of the second half
when they brought the score to 17 to
15.
David and Price Star
David and Price were the stars of
the game. David shot baskets from all
angles with uncanny accuracy. He
garnered seven goals, which made him
high point man of the contest. It was
DaVid who put the game on ice in the
last half after the Cubs had almost
overcome the lead, by sinking some
shots from behind the foul line.
Captain Price played a steady floor
game. He sent the ball through the
net for three field goals and two foul
1 goals. His defensive work was a fac
tor in keeping the Bruin score down.
! Jayred and Anderson alternated at
I center in both halves. Jayred made
five points as well as playing a heady
game. The only man besides Anderson
and Joseph to substitute was Williams,
who replaced Shipkey at running
guard.
Robie, or long snot Tame, Tailed to
connect last night, and only scored
once from the floor for the Bruins.
Fecher, the other Bear forward, was
i responsible for two baskets. The Bears
had a hard time getting past Shipkey
and Newhouse, who succeeded in in
tercepting most of their passes.

offensive during the first half and led

The refereelng was poor and as a result considerable rotighness marred
the work of the players. Newhouse, Stanford's 232-pou!ftid standing guard,
was taken from the game towards the last of the second half because of
having an excessive number of personal fouls called on him. Joseph took
his place for th-e remainder of the game.
The Berkeley five took the lead at the start of the game when Healv,

running guard, evaded Coach "Husky"
Hunt's guards long enough to make a
field goal. Stanford came back and
evened things a minute later. From
this time on the Blue and Gold team
■was trailing the Redshirts. The only
time that the Cubs threatened was
toward the middle of the second half
when they brought the score to 17 to
15.
David and Price Star
David and Price were the stars of
the game. David shot baskets from all
angles with uncanny accuracy. He
garnered seven goals, which made him
high point man of the contest. It was
DaVid who put the game on ice in the
last half after the Cubs had almost
overcome the lead, by sinking some
shots from behind the foul line.
Captain Price played a steady floor
game. He sent the ball through the
net for three field goals and two foul
1 goals. His defensive work was a fac
tor in keeping the Bruin score down.
! Jayred and Anderson alternated at
I center in both halves. Jayred made
five points as well as playing a heady
game. The only man besides Anderson
and Joseph to substitute was Williams,
who replaced Shipkey at running
guard.
Robie, or long snot Tame, Tailed to
connect last night, and only scored
once from the floor for the Bruins.
Fecher, the other Bear forward, was
i responsible for two baskets. The Bears
had a hard time getting past Shipkey
and Newhouse, who succeeded in in
tercepting most of their passes.
Babes Lead at Half

offensive during the first half and led
: 14 to 10 at the end of the period. In
