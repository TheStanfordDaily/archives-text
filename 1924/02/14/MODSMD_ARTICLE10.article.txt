### David Meiklejohn 
PAPTAIN "Nip" McHose of the Stanford varsity quintet "came back" in the
second game of the Trojan series in Los Angeles, and with his total of
sixteen points gave the Cards the necessary impetus to keep the lead in the
race for Pacific Coast Conference basketball honors, the Cardinals winning
31 to 23,
The game was closely fought up until the last few minutes of play when
Stanford brofee an 18 to 18 tie, and took a spurt which the Trojans never
overcame.
The score at half time was 11 to 11.
"Nip" McHose was the outstanding player of the evening, overshadowing
even the brilliant playing of "Ken" Boyer, U. S. C. forward, who was high

point man with fifteen markers.
Score Tied at Halt
Three field goals and five fouls
apiece gave each team the 11 points
which tied the score at the end of the
first half,
Stanford took the lead at th<e begin
ning of the second period on two
fouls. At this point Ernie Nevers was
taken from the game on his fourth
personal foul. Steffan was substituted
for Nevers.
"Nip" McHose on a long dribble to
the goal broke through the Trojan de
fensive and scored on a field goal, fol
lowed soon after by another dribbling
drive by Shipkey, who also scored
from the floor. Boyer tied the score
for U. S. C. on two desperately-shot
field goals. Stanford took the lead once
more, only to have Boyer come back
desperately as before with a tieing
score. Tlie Trojan offensive and de
fensive weakened, and Stanford
attacked with a furiousness which
drove the Trojans under cover. A
series of field and foul goals gave tlf*>
Cardinals the 111 to 23 score and the
victory.
Oliva Out of Game
Kerr did not play Dave Oliva at the
standing guard position, and Shipkey
played in his stead. Shipkey played
his best game of the season last night,
effectively checking the onrushing
Trojan offensive drives like a veteran.
His surprising performance gives
Stanford one more hope in the form
of a capable substitute.
Campbell, U. S. C.'s star forward,
was out of the game on account of his
injured shoulder. Rice, who played
such a star game in the first game
against Stanford Tuesday night, scored
on six free throws.
