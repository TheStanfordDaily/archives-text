# "Inside Roughing" Is Prohibited At Clubhouse Dances
## 
### 
That all "roughing" at the Women's j
Clubhouse dances must be done out-;
side the building was the jist of a
resolution passed by Men's Council
Tuesday. No "roughs" will be allowed
inside the clubhouse at all, and stu
dent police will be on hand in cas<e
any "roughs" should see fit to break
this rule.
This action was taken with regards !
to the condition at the dances held j
last week in the Clubhouse where all
the chairs intended for the dancers j
were occupied by the "roughs" during \
the intermissions as well as the
dances.
" 'Roughing' is one of the last re
maining sacred traditions left at Stan- j
ford," says George Baker, president i
of Men's Council, "and unless we take
proper measures now to keep 'rough- J
ing' from becoming an announce, it
will also become one of the traditions i
of the past."
