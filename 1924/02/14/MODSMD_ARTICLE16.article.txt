# Disgrace

### 
The Stanford rough has fallen into disrepute.
He has been forgetting his place for some weeks past but the events
of last week end were the crowning disgraces.
Last Friday and Saturday nights, not one, but many roughs forgot that
they were Stanford menâ€”gentlemen. Beyond doubt, the rankest case
was one of actual stealing.
Mrs. Ewell, who is in charge of the Women's Clubhouse, went into
her room on the first floor Saturday night while a dance was in progress,
leaving her key in the door. Attached to the key by a ribbon, was a silver
fountain pen, bearing the initials E. C. E. When she returned less than a
minute later, both key and pen were missing. The pen, aside from its in
trinsic value was treasured as a gift. It may be of interest to the vagrant
who committed the theft to know that the lock on the door has been
changed since that time. The stolen key is useless, and, as the pen would
be recognized upon sight, the easiest way out of the difficulty would be to
return it to the rightful owner.
Under ordinarv circumstances, no one would think of accusing the
Stanford roughs of such a deed. Had they not done other ungentlemanly
things the same night and the night before, they might have escaped sus
picion.
No college man, and certainly 110 Stanford man, whether in cords or
in a Tuxedo should sit down with a dozen or more women standing up all
around him. And yet more than a hundred roughs did that very thing
Friday and Saturday nights. Not content with these things, they clam
bered up the sides of the clubhouse,, breaking down the drain pipes and
smashing garbage cans 011 which they stood. 1 hey crowded onto the or
chestra platform until the musicians were disturbed. They stood about
the sides of the building (those who either had scruples or couldn't find
seats) and dropped burning cigarettes 011 the floor, leaving them to burn
holes and ruin the hardwood.
Then, just to top the evening off, someone stopped in the men's dress
ing rooms, picked out the newest hat in sight, and escorted it home with
him. (The man who lost the hat did not seem much surprised as he de
clared that the loss of the hat brought his total of missing articles of cloth
ing to something like $54).
And now the Men's Council has been forced to step in and make regu
lations in regard to the conduct of the roughs. According to a ruling
passed by the council Wednesday, no roughs will be allowed inside the
clubhouse during dances. There will be student police on hand to enforce
the new regulation. Offenders will be turned over to the Men's Council.
It is regrettable that such action has been necessary, but undoubtedly
when the roughs see the "error of their ways" the ruling can be repealed.
