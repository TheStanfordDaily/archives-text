Tonight in Encina Gymnasium, Harry Maloney's varsity boxing team
opens its intercollegiate season against Davis Farm.
Boxing has risen rapidly from the rank of a second class minor sport
to first class rating. As an intercollegiate sport it is conducted on a clean
basis and is deserving of support.
judging from the number of women who were present at the elimina
tion bouts last Friday, the crowd tonight will not be entirely made up of
men. There will be special arrangements made to take care of any women
who desire to attend.
The boxers have been working out since the first of October and Ma
loney has a very formidable aggregation. Last year. Davis and Stanford
broke even, the former winning the first tournament and the latter taking
the return bouts.
There will be plenty of accommodations to take care of a large crowd
and the boxers will probably perform before a packed house.
