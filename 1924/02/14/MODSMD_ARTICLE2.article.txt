# BROWNING ARTICLE BY MRS. RUSSELL IS IN SEWANEE REVIEW
## 
### 
"Browning's Account With Trag
edy.'' the latest article of the series of j
Browning studies by Mrs. Russell of I
the English department, appeared in
the last issue of the Sewanee Review,
for the months of January, February,
and March.
In this article Mrs. Russell first gave
a clear understanding of the true mean
ing of tragedy, distinguishing it from
pathos, saying that the confusion of
the two was due to carelessness rather
than true resemblance, "for in so far as
it is true that men must work and fight,
and women must weep, pathos is the
faminine of tragedy. Hie essence of
tragedy." she continues later, "is con
flict leading to catastrophe, with triumph
on the wrong side."
Includes Few Tragedies.
Browning's excursions into tragedy
were few, according to Mrs. Russell,
who finds tragedy in only five of his
dramas, not counting his transcriptions
from the Greek, three narrative poems,
and his great epic.
Mrs. Russell writes of "Browning's
tragic symphony," and says, "Genuine
tragedy is an irreconcilable discord.
Browning's art smooths and attunes
until his conciliating touch has pro
duced a finish of sweet, melodious har
mony. His heroes and heroines are all
beautiful with joy or some compensat
iung emotion at the end; all are uplifted
by altruism or sublime resignation."
In describing what tragedy is ac
cording to Browning's point of view,
Mrs. Russell says, "Death to him is
anything but tragic in itself."
His Tragedy Contains Hope.
His tragedy is not without hope, she
says. "Unhappincss to the point of
terror, frenzy, despair, darkens many of
Browning's pages, but always some
light filters through."
In conclusion of her discussion of
the various parts of Browning's works
which have an element of tragedy, Mrs.
Russell wrote, "His tendency to find
compensation, to harmonize and recon
cile. together with an incorrigible habit
of being jocular out of season, diluted
the flavor of his tragic cup. Its best
assets are the subtlety of his presenta
tion. This is perhaps a small enough
card of admission to the Temple of
Fame, but it is sufficient. It gives him
the entrance denied to any man or artist
who is wholly oblivious to the tragic
aspect of life."
Other Works of Browning.
In October, "A I'ungent Poet," deal
ing with Browning as a satirist, was
published by Mrs. Russell in the Uni
versity of California Chronicle. Others
of her Browning series have been
printed by the Psychological Review
and Sewanee Review.

it is true that men must work and fight,
and women must weep, pathos is the
faminine of tragedy. Hie essence of

Includes Few Tragedies.
Browning's excursions into tragedy
were few, according to Mrs. Russell,
who finds tragedy in only five of his
dramas, not counting his transcriptions
from the Greek, three narrative poems,
and his great epic.
Mrs. Russell writes of "Browning's
tragic symphony," and says, "Genuine
tragedy is an irreconcilable discord.
Browning's art smooths and attunes
until his conciliating touch has pro
duced a finish of sweet, melodious har
mony. His heroes and heroines are all
beautiful with joy or some compensat
iung emotion at the end; all are uplifted
by altruism or sublime resignation."
In describing what tragedy is ac
cording to Browning's point of view,
Mrs. Russell says, "Death to him is
anything but tragic in itself."
His Tragedy Contains Hope.
His tragedy is not without hope, she
says. "Unhappincss to the point of
terror, frenzy, despair, darkens many of
Browning's pages, but always some
light filters through."
In conclusion of her discussion of
the various parts of Browning's works
which have an element of tragedy, Mrs.
Russell wrote, "His tendency to find
compensation, to harmonize and recon
cile. together with an incorrigible habit
of being jocular out of season, diluted
the flavor of his tragic cup. Its best
assets are the subtlety of his presenta
tion. This is perhaps a small enough
card of admission to the Temple of
Fame, but it is sufficient. It gives him
the entrance denied to any man or artist
who is wholly oblivious to the tragic
aspect of life."
Other Works of Browning.
In October, "A I'ungent Poet," deal
ing with Browning as a satirist, was
published by Mrs. Russell in the Uni
versity of California Chronicle. Others
of her Browning series have been
printed by the Psychological Review
and Sewanee Review.
"Browning's Account With Trag
edy.'' the latest article of the series of j
Browning studies by Mrs. Russell of I
the English department, appeared in
the last issue of the Sewanee Review,
for the months of January, February,
and March.
In this article Mrs. Russell first gave
a clear understanding of the true mean
ing of tragedy, distinguishing it from
pathos, saying that the confusion of
the two was due to carelessness rather
than true resemblance, "for in so far as
it is true that men must work and fight,
and women must weep, pathos is the
faminine of tragedy. Hie essence of
