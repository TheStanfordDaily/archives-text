Student Asks:
Q. Dear Sir, can you tell me what
two nations participated in the
Franco-Prussian War?
A. Why England and Czecho-Slova
kia of course. Ha! Ha! You rascal.
You tried to trip us up on that
one didn't you? Well, we're harder
to catch than that. We won't bite.
Try again.
Rich Widow Asks:
Q. Dear Sir, I am a rich widow, but
am suspicious of all offers for
marriage, because I am afraid my
suitors don't really love me, and
are only after my money.
A. Do nothing until we see you. What
is your address? How much money
did you say you have?
Poor Man Asks:
Q. Dear.Sir, I am a poor man and
am tired of poverty. How can I
get some money?
A. Well, your question is a hard one
to answer right off hand. A piece
of lead pipe about two feet long
is as good as any, we imagine. A
gun makes too much noise of
course, and a knife is too messy.
Write us again in a few days.
Politician Asks:
Q. Do you know anything about the
recent strike bill passed by Con
gress ?
A. Didn't you read what it says at

The only way to get everybody out
to vote at elections is to abolish nomi
nations and let everybody vote for
whom he chooses without being both
ered by having those names printed
on the ballots. Then he (she or it)
could vote for himself without embar
rassment, and there would probably
be a 100% turnout. A second election
would, of course, be necesasry—just
take the first two in alphabetical
order.
