# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Dear Sir:
It has recently, but not quite recent
ly, been noticed that freshmen, sopho
mores, and upperclassmen are avail
ing themselves of the self-inflicted
liberty of crossing on their way to and
from the Chemistry building that por
tion of the lawn lying in front of the
Biology and Zoology buildings.
A few years ago there was a well
worn path existing over the above
mention grass plot which made things
look like — You know what???
The University took action by placing
a sign at the entrance to that man
made-cow-path which said in simple
and effective words, "Keep Off the
Grass." We did that, the grass grew,
and things weren't so bad to look at.
Now that the sign no longer appears,
the students are again trespassing on
the lawn, causing danger of another
path to mar the beauty of the dande
lions.
Allow me to suggest that the Chem.
students eat some more vitamines and
take it upon themselves to keep off
the grass by traveling on the beaten
path, the road. Then there would be
no need for a sign to read "Please
Keep Off the Grass, Which Would Be
Grass if You Would Keep Off."
