Track, at the University of Cali
fornia. is an unknown quantity. Dope-
Sters and men who have followed the
achievements of the team for the past
three years are shaking their heads and
voicing a doubt as to chances for a win
this season.
For three years California has won
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet under tin
coaching of Walter Christie. Harold
"Brick" Muller, Norrifc, Sorrenti, Jack
Merchant and men of like calibre are
lost to the Blue and Gold through
graduation. It now remains to be seen

whether Coach Christie will be able to
develop a winning team from the re
maining members of last year's var
sity and from the material to be found
j in the 160 candidates who have ex
pressed their desire to make a berth
for themselves on this year's varsity.
Christie who has been coaching Cali
fornia tracksters for 23 years is hope
ful, for he has a good nucleus upon
which to build his present varsity.
Captain Neufeldt made good in the
weights last year and together with
Lang this department is fairly well
taken care of. Petersen gets quite a
heave into his javelin shots and will
probably make good.
In the sprints and distances Tommy
Ryan and Jack Blemmer are members
of last year's varsity and established

I some good marks.
j It now remains to he seen as to just
I what sort of material the new candi
| dates are composed of. The track due
to some recent light rains has not been
fast and has remained firm enough to
I allow only some light jogging. The
I weather is warm which allows for out
| door training and eases the muscles of
the tracksters. The men have been
reporting faithfully and Christie walks
about the pits and track watching for a
spurt of speed or conquering of dis
tance.

The first big meet which California
will enter is the one with the University
of Illinois on April 19. The meet will
be held at the University of California.
The following week the varsity will
meet Stanford.
On May 3 the Bears will enter the
Pacific Athletic Association meet.

Ohio State University is making use
of the "movie" screen in the classroom
as a means of visual education. The
moving pictures used deal for the most
part with agricultural subjects.
