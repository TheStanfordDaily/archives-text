# Eighty-Six Calls For Game Results Received by D. P. A.
## 
### 
Eighty-six calls for the results of
the basketball games were received
and answered at the Daily Palo Alto
office last night. The calls started com
ing in at 9 o'clock and the last one
was chalked up at 11:30 when a female
voice put the old (by this time) query
of "Who won the game?" to the tele
phone boy after the melody of the
nickel rolling into the pay station cof
fer had ceased.
Sixty-four calls were from men,
twenty came from the gentler sex,
and two failed to say "Thank you" so
their sex went unrecorded.
This system of giving out game
scores will be continued by the Daily.
No calls will be received before 10
o'clock, however, and two phones will
be in use during the succeeding hour,
if the rush of calls equals that of
last night. Â»
