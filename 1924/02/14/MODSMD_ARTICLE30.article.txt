# FACTORS IN LIVING COST STUDIED BY RESEARCH WORKER
## 
### 
Food factors in the cost of living
of the average family have been in
vestigated by Miss Edith Hawley of
the Stanford Food Research Institute.
Budgets collected from 1600 Ameri
can homes during the war by the U. S.
Department of Agriculture furnished
| data upon which Miss Hawley's flnd
i ings are based. This is the first study
of its kind in the United States to
include all the different occupational
groups. Of the budgets investigated,
15 per cent are those of laborers, 9 per
cent of farmers, 15 per cent of teach
ers, 22 per cent of business and pro
j fessional m-en, 11 per cent of clerks?
• and students, and 28 per cent of vari
! ous institutions, such as college dormi
tories and fraternity and sorority
houses.
Using the food consumption of the
average man as the standard Miss
Hawley found ten standard commodi-
I ties to be represented in his diet in
J the following quantities: meat, oue-
I fourth of a pound; fard, one-half an
! ounce; butter, one ounce; milk, one
pint; cheese, one-third o£ an ounce;
| eggs, one;bread, one-fourth of a
'pound; flour, one-third of a pound;
| sugar, two and one-half ounces ;pota
j toes, one-half pound.
In estimating food value these sta
-1 pie foods constitute three-fourths of
the caloric value of the diet and 60
I per cent of the cost.
Potatoes, pork, milk, butter, and
I eggs* predominate in the farmer's
j diet; beef, potatoes, and bread in the
i laborer's; 1 milk, butter, eggs and sugar
in the diet of the "white collar" group
made up ol' business men, clerks,
teachers, and students; and beef,
! milk, bread, and potatoes in the
j bill-of-fare of institutions. Fruits and
; vegetables have not been included in
| the investigation because of the diffi
culty in estimating the cost of these
' often home grown products.
I In comparison with other countries
i the most striking differences in the
American diet occur in milk, bread,
and flour consumption. These foods
\ constitute about one-tenth of the total
j diet in the United States, over one
third in Switzerland, and almost one
' half in great Britain.
