# April 4 Is Named as Date For Annual Military Ball
## 
### 
April 4 has been set as the date for
the annual Military Ball, after several
postponements.
A closed date has been granted for
the occasion. Although the affair is
some distance off plans are rapidly
being perfected to make it one of the
big dances of the year.
Tickets will be placed on sale in
the near future. R. O. T. C. men will
attend in dress uniform, while other
students will wear the regular formal
garb.
