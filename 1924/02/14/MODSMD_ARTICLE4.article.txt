# LAWRENCE CHARGES PRESS WITH MUCH OF PRESENT CRIME
## 
### 
"I charge the press of San Francisco
with one-half the crime that exists,"
declared Andrew M. Lawrence, execu
tive of tlve San Francisco Journal, in
talking on journalistic standards to
the American Journalists Association
last night.
If the .papers would maintain an edi
torial attitude censuring crime, Lawr
ence believes that much crime would
be obviated because the people would
not stand for it. However, he thinks
that in the end the "yellow" journal
ist will get his just desserts and be
lieves that there is a general trend to
wards decency in present-day news
papers.
Scandal Due to Disappear
"In another three years I don't, think
that the average scandal case will run
in the newspapers because nobody will
read it. In other words, newspapers
will be kept on a par as much as pos
sible with conversations among ladies
and gentlemen in social life," stated
Lawrence.
Lawrence discussed the psychology
of advertising, saying that he found
! that the lighter-minded people run to
! the evening papers while the more
j sober-minded read the morning edi
: tions, and advertising must be done
; accordingly.
"The biggest problem in journalism
isn't editing the paper; it is circulat
: ing it. We don't need editors; we need
boys," declared Lawrence. In this con
; nection he commented 011 the huge
! circulation a one-cent paper could
maintain but when the price was
raised to two cents the circulation
would immediately drop off.
"You've got to proceed along your
| line of duty as you see it. Don't be
I truculent but don't be intimidated," is
! the advice of Lawrence to all who
want to be successful journalists.
Should Work on Newspaper
"I would learn the newspaper busi
ness no matter what profession I was
going to take up. If you take three
years of journalism it gives you a
clearer insight into life than any other
known thing. You find human nature
j in the raw. It teaches you to under
stand men and you will always know
instinctively whether or not a person
i is telling you the truth. You will also
learn fearlessness and courage," con
i eluded Lawrence.

"The biggest problem in journalism
isn't editing the paper; it is circulat
: ing it. We don't need editors; we need
boys," declared Lawrence. In this con
; nection he commented 011 the huge
! circulation a one-cent paper could
maintain but when the price was
raised to two cents the circulation
would immediately drop off.
"You've got to proceed along your
| line of duty as you see it. Don't be
I truculent but don't be intimidated," is
! the advice of Lawrence to all who
want to be successful journalists.
Should Work on Newspaper
"I would learn the newspaper busi
ness no matter what profession I was
going to take up. If you take three
years of journalism it gives you a
clearer insight into life than any other
known thing. You find human nature
j in the raw. It teaches you to under
stand men and you will always know
instinctively whether or not a person
i is telling you the truth. You will also
learn fearlessness and courage," con
i eluded Lawrence.
