# ROMANCE IN RAM'S HEAD SHOW HELPS FORM TRIPLE PLOT
## Famous Characters Involved In Three Love Affairs In 1924 Burlesque 
### 
Music, songs and women are not to
be all the show in "The Merchant of
Menace," an romance and intrigue run
through the plot of the play in a
highly entertaining manner. Besides
behing a vehicle for a number of en
tertaining songs as "smart cracks,"
this year's show carries a deep-dyed
romantic plot that would shame many
of the so-called i#orti#rn romantic
plays.
Although the maiVf plot involves
some highly dramatic scenes centered
around the laundry business of Venice,
a few very clever and entertaining
love stories are worked in, so as to
lighten up the general effect and not
cause any suicides among the audi
ence.
Portia Pursued by "Lovers"
Portia, the attractive young woman
of Venice who is pursued by many of
the younger bloods on account of her
wealth, finally falls in love with Bas
sanio, a serious-minded young man
who is after her only for "love."
Running parallel to this love affair
is another, that of little Mary Miles
Minter and Antonio; while the third
couple in Dan Cupid's triangle is Shy
lock's daughter, Jessica, and Saka
Togawa, the Japanese Count.
Some dirty deals are involved on the
stage with Nerissa, the vampire, hold
ing the black ace. Although Charles
Simons does not wear a long clinging
black gown he does his stuff, don't
worry.
