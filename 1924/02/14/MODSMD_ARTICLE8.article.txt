# CARD BOXERS MEET DAVIS FARM TONIGHT IN ANNUAL TOURNEY
## Aggies Report Loss of Three Veterans; New Fighters On Varsity Squad 
### 
Stanford leather-pushers will meet
the Davis Farm team tonight in their
annual boxing tourney. The meet will
begin at 7:30 p.m. in Encina gymna
sium.
Davis Farm comes to Stanford this
year slightly weakened from the loss
of three veterans of last season. Re
ports have come from the Aggie in
stitution, however, that several men
have been developed who will be en
tered in the Olympic Games trvouts
this spring.
Coach Harry Maloney has succeeded
in putting out a Cardinal squad which
is much improved over last year's.
The veterans have all put on a little
more, polish and a number of now
men. products of the recent elimina
tion bouts, promise to show up well.
Vincent Martin to Box
Vincent Martin, entered in the wel
terweight division, will enter the ring
for the first time tonight as a varsity
man. His recent showings against Par
sons, another novice welter who
slings a fast pair of fists, make him
rate high, and he will undoubtedly
give his opponent a stiff fight.
Stuart Van Hook is a varsity light
heavy whose stock has taken an up
ward jump this season. His defense
is much better and, coupled with his
unusual cleverness in footwork, should
make him a dangerous man for the
Aggies to meet.
Earl Armbruster is one of Maloney's
best bets, being Pacific Coast feather
weight champion through his victory
last year over Farlow of U. S. C.
Floyd Tull has yet to make his ap
pearance as a varsity man in the
heavyweight division. He is another
product of the tournament last week.
"Jake" Irwin, middleweight, is one
of the mainstays in the Stanford ag
gregation. He has never lost an inter
collegiate bout and looks good to con
tinue his winning streak tonight.
Bradford Simmons, boxing as a ban
tamweight, is a varsity man who was
not out last year. He is fast and clever
and his lay-off appears to have done
him some good.
Elbert Harward, lightweight, will
box tonight for the first time as a
varsity man. having won his place on
the squad by his good showing in last
week's tournament.
