# REAL BEAUTY OF MEMORIAL CHAPEL LOST TO MAJORITY OF VISITORS TO STANFORD
## McCaskill Declares Windows Exceed Oil Paintings for Realism and Color 
### 
Alan McCaskill, popularly known as
"Sandy" McCaskill, the veteran cam
pus mail man, bewails the fact that
the real beauty of the Stanford Me
morial Chapel is almost wholly lost
to the many people who pass through
its doors every day. "They don't look
for the beauty in it," he asserted.
"They view the Chapel as a sort of
sight-seers' curiosity, and most people
will 'come in, walk around a little and
then go out again without seeing a
thing." Even people of the ITniversi.y
who have been around the campus for
years, for the most part, fail to see
the real beauty in the chapel, he de
! clares.
Windows Especially Beautiful
I Mr. McCaskill is especially enthusi-
I astic over the great windows in the
, chapel. Tie has been through most of
; the famous art galleries of England
and the Continent, as well as those of
| America, and he declares that for him
| at least, the "pictures as depicted
j through the medium of the stained

, glass windows of the chapel, far ex
ceed any oil paintings he has ever
seen. "The light shining through the
panes of glass makes for a vividness
of color that oil cannot produce. And
:
moreover," lie declares, "I have never
seen any picture which can compare
with these windows for realism, and
actual human qualities. Oil paints are
unable to produce as lifelike an effect
as are the rays of the suri."
Especially at certain hours of the
day and certain seasons of the yeaV
are these windows to be seen in what
Mr. McCaskill describes as their
"heighth of glory." "At times," he goes
on, "they look as if they have been
actually painted with precious jewels,
and they blaze with such splendid
color that one can hardly stand before
them and look on them."
Mosaics Not Really Genuine
The mosaic work found in the
; chapel is not strictly genuine, Mr.
McCaskill asserts. A true mosaic em-
ploys only real stone. The mosaics of
the Chapel are made with bits of col
ored, opaque glass, which are manu
factured especially for that purpose
by the Salviatti Company of Venice,
Italy. The work was all done by the
finest artists, and probably the best
example in the Chapel is found in the
picture of "The Last Supper," located
at the back of the altar and facing the
entrance to the church. The original
of this picture was done by Cosimo
Russelli, an artist of the 14th cen
tury, and is regarded as a maserpiece
of art. It has been excellently repro
duced in the mosaic for the Chapel
and its perspective is so perfect that,
many people in looking at it for the
first time, believe it to be inlaid and
set in from the wall. Others take it for
an oil painting, and still others believe
it to be a tapestry.
Compares University to Freight House
Mr. McCaskill first came to Stanford
in 1917. He declares that his first im
pression of the University as seen
from Palm Drive, reminded him pe
culiarly of a large freight terminal,
with the many doors along the long
front elevation appearing as receiving
doors for freight. This impression has
s ; nce left him, however, and he as
serts that the of the campus
and the surrounding country becomes
more apparent to him every day.

panes of glass makes for a vividness
of color that oil cannot produce. And
:
moreover," lie declares, "I have never
seen any picture which can compare
with these windows for realism, and
actual human qualities. Oil paints are
unable to produce as lifelike an effect
as are the rays of the suri."
Especially at certain hours of the
day and certain seasons of the yeaV
are these windows to be seen in what
Mr. McCaskill describes as their
"heighth of glory." "At times," he goes
on, "they look as if they have been
actually painted with precious jewels,
and they blaze with such splendid
color that one can hardly stand before
them and look on them."
Mosaics Not Really Genuine
The mosaic work found in the
; chapel is not strictly genuine, Mr.
McCaskill asserts. A true mosaic em-
ploys only real stone. The mosaics of
the Chapel are made with bits of col
ored, opaque glass, which are manu
factured especially for that purpose
by the Salviatti Company of Venice,
Italy. The work was all done by the
finest artists, and probably the best
example in the Chapel is found in the
picture of "The Last Supper," located
at the back of the altar and facing the
entrance to the church. The original
of this picture was done by Cosimo
Russelli, an artist of the 14th cen
tury, and is regarded as a maserpiece
of art. It has been excellently repro
duced in the mosaic for the Chapel
and its perspective is so perfect that,
many people in looking at it for the
first time, believe it to be inlaid and
set in from the wall. Others take it for
an oil painting, and still others believe
it to be a tapestry.
Compares University to Freight House
Mr. McCaskill first came to Stanford
in 1917. He declares that his first im
pression of the University as seen
from Palm Drive, reminded him pe
culiarly of a large freight terminal,
with the many doors along the long
front elevation appearing as receiving
doors for freight. This impression has
s ; nce left him, however, and he as
serts that the of the campus
and the surrounding country becomes
more apparent to him every day.
Alan McCaskill, popularly known as
"Sandy" McCaskill, the veteran cam
pus mail man, bewails the fact that
the real beauty of the Stanford Me
morial Chapel is almost wholly lost
to the many people who pass through
its doors every day. "They don't look
for the beauty in it," he asserted.
"They view the Chapel as a sort of
sight-seers' curiosity, and most people
will 'come in, walk around a little and
then go out again without seeing a
thing." Even people of the ITniversi.y
who have been around the campus for
years, for the most part, fail to see
the real beauty in the chapel, he de
! clares.
Windows Especially Beautiful
I Mr. McCaskill is especially enthusi-
I astic over the great windows in the
, chapel. Tie has been through most of
; the famous art galleries of England
and the Continent, as well as those of
| America, and he declares that for him
| at least, the "pictures as depicted
j through the medium of the stained

, glass windows of the chapel, far ex
ceed any oil paintings he has ever
seen. "The light shining through the
panes of glass makes for a vividness
of color that oil cannot produce. And
:
moreover," lie declares, "I have never
seen any picture which can compare
with these windows for realism, and
