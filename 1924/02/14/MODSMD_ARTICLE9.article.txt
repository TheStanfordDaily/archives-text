# REAL BEAUTY OF MEMORIAL CHAPEL LOST TO MAJORITY OF VISITORS TO STANFORD
## McCaskill Declares Windows Exceed Oil Paintings for Realism and Color 
### 
Alan McCaskill, popularly known as
"Sandy" McCaskill, the veteran cam
pus mail man, bewails the fact that
the real beauty of the Stanford Me
morial Chapel is almost wholly lost
to the many people who pass through
its doors every day. "They don't look
for the beauty in it," he asserted.
"They view the Chapel as a sort of
sight-seers' curiosity, and most people
will 'come in, walk around a little and
then go out again without seeing a
thing." Even people of the ITniversi.y
who have been around the campus for
years, for the most part, fail to see
the real beauty in the chapel, he de

Windows Especially Beautiful
I Mr. McCaskill is especially enthusi-

, chapel. Tie has been through most of
; the famous art galleries of England
and the Continent, as well as those of

| at least, the "pictures as depicted
j through the medium of the stained

, glass windows of the chapel, far ex
ceed any oil paintings he has ever
seen. "The light shining through the
panes of glass makes for a vividness
of color that oil cannot produce. And
:
moreover," lie declares, "I have never
seen any picture which can compare
with these windows for realism, and
actual human qualities. Oil paints are
unable to produce as lifelike an effect
as are the rays of the suri."
Especially at certain hours of the
day and certain seasons of the yeaV
are these windows to be seen in what
Mr. McCaskill describes as their
"heighth of glory." "At times," he goes
on, "they look as if they have been
actually painted with precious jewels,
and they blaze with such splendid
color that one can hardly stand before
them and look on them."
Mosaics Not Really Genuine
The mosaic work found in the
; chapel is not strictly genuine, Mr.
McCaskill asserts. A true mosaic em-
