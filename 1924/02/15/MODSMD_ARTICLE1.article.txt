# VARSITY BOXERS DOWN DAVIS FARM, 5 TO 1
## Vincent Martin and Floyd Tull Deliver Knockouts To Aggie Opponents 
### 
Three knockouts added to the ex
citement last night when Stanford
boxers easily defeated Davis Farm,
5 to 1. One fight went to a draw.
It was Vincent Martin, welter
weight, who dished out the sleep-pro
ducing blow to Jensen, the Aggies'
hope. He began his bout by forcing
the fight and delivered the final blow
five seconds after the opening bell.
Two Technical Knockouts
The other two knockouts were tech
nical. One of the matches was award
ed to Mil he of Davis Farm over Brad
ford Simmons of Stanford, and the
other to Floyd Tull, Stanford, over
Beilar, Davis Farm.
Milhe, a bantamweight, began the
fight by rushing Simmons at every
turn, and forced him to cover under a
rain of blows. Simmons attempted an
offense but was unable to get his
bearings and lost the bout by Referee
Flanagan's decision during the first
round.
Tull Shows Well
Tull's bout was his first appearance
as a varsity heavyweight. He was
awarded a technical knockout after
dropping Beilor to his knees twice in
a fast ten seconds.
Earl Armbruster (S), in the 125-
pound division, fought to a draw with
Bernshouse (D. F.), after an extra
round. Both men saw dynamite in the
other's fists and stayed away from
each other for the first round. The
second and third sessions saw a little
mixture of fists but both fighters
seemed loggy and put up little de
fense. After the extra round which
developed into a slugging party, the
bout was declared a draw.
Elbert (S) and Fisher (D. F.), light
weights, mixed it hot and heavy for
two rounds, but seemed out of condi
tion and lacked any kind of a punch
in the third. The match was called a
draw and Harward was given the de
cision after the fourth round.
A fast exhibition bout was staged
at this point between Jack Parsom;
(S) and Creffin (D. F.). Parsons made
one of the best showings of the eve
ning and displayed clever footwork
•coupled with hard-hitting fists.
"Jake" Irwin, middleweight, added
another win to his string of scalps
through his defeat of Barlow (D. F.).
The bout was a close one throughout
but Irwin is a two-handed slugger who
knows when and where to land his
hlows, and forced his man to stay cov
ered most of the time.
Stuart. Van Hook (S) won a hard
bout over Kovecs (D. F.) by judgment
of the referee after the judges had
disagreed. Both men landed a number
of blows but Van Hook ifc a clever in
fighter and undoubtedly garnered the
deciding points in that department.
Mort Blackburn, former light-heavy
weight champion of the University of
Wisconsin, and Jack Feeley, an ex
perienced amateur of the Middlewest,
acted as judges.

Mort Blackburn, former light-heavy
weight champion of the University of
Wisconsin, and Jack Feeley, an ex
perienced amateur of the Middlewest,
acted as judges.
Three knockouts added to the ex
citement last night when Stanford
boxers easily defeated Davis Farm,
5 to 1. One fight went to a draw.
It was Vincent Martin, welter
weight, who dished out the sleep-pro
ducing blow to Jensen, the Aggies'
hope. He began his bout by forcing
the fight and delivered the final blow
five seconds after the opening bell.
Two Technical Knockouts
The other two knockouts were tech
nical. One of the matches was award
ed to Mil he of Davis Farm over Brad
ford Simmons of Stanford, and the
other to Floyd Tull, Stanford, over
Beilar, Davis Farm.
Milhe, a bantamweight, began the
fight by rushing Simmons at every
turn, and forced him to cover under a
rain of blows. Simmons attempted an
offense but was unable to get his
bearings and lost the bout by Referee
Flanagan's decision during the first
round.
Tull Shows Well
Tull's bout was his first appearance
as a varsity heavyweight. He was
awarded a technical knockout after
dropping Beilor to his knees twice in
a fast ten seconds.
Earl Armbruster (S), in the 125-
pound division, fought to a draw with
Bernshouse (D. F.), after an extra
round. Both men saw dynamite in the
other's fists and stayed away from
each other for the first round. The
second and third sessions saw a little
mixture of fists but both fighters
seemed loggy and put up little de
fense. After the extra round which
developed into a slugging party, the
bout was declared a draw.
Elbert (S) and Fisher (D. F.), light
weights, mixed it hot and heavy for
two rounds, but seemed out of condi
tion and lacked any kind of a punch
in the third. The match was called a
draw and Harward was given the de
cision after the fourth round.
A fast exhibition bout was staged
at this point between Jack Parsom;
(S) and Creffin (D. F.). Parsons made
one of the best showings of the eve
ning and displayed clever footwork
•coupled with hard-hitting fists.
"Jake" Irwin, middleweight, added
another win to his string of scalps
through his defeat of Barlow (D. F.).
The bout was a close one throughout
but Irwin is a two-handed slugger who
knows when and where to land his
hlows, and forced his man to stay cov
ered most of the time.
Stuart. Van Hook (S) won a hard
bout over Kovecs (D. F.) by judgment
of the referee after the judges had
disagreed. Both men landed a number
of blows but Van Hook ifc a clever in
fighter and undoubtedly garnered the
deciding points in that department.
