# Roughs May See "Merchant Of Menace" From Rowboats
## 
### 
Since all the Gondolas and Gondo
lalas for the Ram's Head show this
â€¢evening have been satisfactorily dis-!
posed of, a limited number of Row
boats will be thrown open to the
roughs.
These seats are in the side sections
of the balcony, and it will cost the
roughs 75 cents to take a row. This
bargain sale of seats will last from
7:30 until 8 only. After that time they
will be sold to unsuspecting visitors
on the campus as unassuming Gon
dolas.
Roughs have been requested to act
as though they were among queeners j
during the more dignified sections of
the show. Applause will be welcomed
by the actorines at the crucial mo
ments only.
