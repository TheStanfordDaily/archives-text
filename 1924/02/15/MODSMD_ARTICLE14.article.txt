# CONFERENCE HONORS WILL BE AT STAKE WHEN CARDS MEET GEARS IN SECOND ENCOUNTER
## Stanford Is Weakened by Gruelling Contests With Trojans and Long Railroad Journey 
### 
pACIFIC Coast Conference basketball honors will be at stake in the Oakland
Auditorium tomorrow night when Stanford's varsity meets the University
of California quintet in the second game of the series.
The game will start promptly at 8 o'clock.
Stanford returns from Los Angeles considerably weakened by the gruelling
U. S. C. contests and by the long trip. This gives the two fives practically an
even break.
Bruins Not Wonders
California is not all it has been cracked up to be. There are four weak
spots on the team. Johnny Talt is the only player who deserves credit of
i being an all-around court man. His teammates give Talt as little support as
'they dare.
Houvenin is a possible exception he got in some lucky swats against the
| Cards last Saturday, but had Dave Oliva been playing at his usual position
his luck probably would never have materialized.
Oliva has returned from the southern series with his knee still in a critical
condition. It is altogether probable that Kerr will not make any attempt to
i put Oliva in the line-up tomorrow night.
Shipkey Deserves Credit
Due credit goes to Harry Shipkey, who handled the standing guard position
against the Southerners with all the fight he could muster. His opportune
scores, coming at the time when the red-shirts needed them most, were more

>than instrumental in the rally of the
second game.
California's passing game is pos
sibly smoother than that of the Cards.
But they are inconsistent. In the first
half the Bears handled the ball like
a high school quintet, and during the
second period they showed a class
which would be hard to equal.
California Style Ragged
Granted that the Bears had hard
luck in shooting their baskets, it must
be admitted that a team which has
gone through the season playing a
consistently ragged game, can hardly
expect to be given the odds.
Stanford has gone through the sea
son with no less amount of raggedness
than their Bruin opponents. But the
Cards have the happy faculty of being
able to come through in the pinches.
The game will be close. California
will try with all her might to even up
affairs with Stanford, and may suc
ceed.
Ernie Nevers will have to watch
himself closely tomorrow. He plays a
rushing offensive, which may not get
by as well with the referee as with
his supporters. On this weakness the
Bears will be working.
Not one oponent has been able to
check "Nip" McHose. The Cardinal
forward is always on the dot with his
part of the Stanford score, which often
assumes the proportions of the largest
slice.
The probable line-ups tomorrow
will be:
Stanford— California—
McHose F Talt
Nevers F Houvenin or Kyte
Steele C Higgins
Mcßurney G Kincaid
Sliipkey G Belasco
