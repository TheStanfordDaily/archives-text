We Stanford students, all of us, scoff uncompromisingly at a high
school "star" who can think of nothing but his schooL's wonderful record
and what a place he had in it. We scornfully refer to this attitude as pro
vincialism."
Yet as we go about the campus today, we find that the normal student
can think or talk of nothing but the University life, what a record our
teams have made, and what the latest social gossip may be.
Does it interest us as Stanford students to know:
That national figures are having their reputations brought dangerously
near to ruin by disclosures at Washington?
That a bitter fight is raging in the Protestant churches of America be
tween the "fundamentalists" and the "modernists?"
That in San Francisco the crisis of the battle between municipal and
public ownership is reaching its height?
That women and children are being killed by drunken automobilists ?
Think of what you talked about yesterday —from the rush before
breakfast to the "bull" session before bed. Were any topics of the above
type mentioned even casually ?
We expect to be in the middle of these things in from one to six years.
Yet the same old talk of campus personalities, campus teams, campus
problems, goes on and on with never a break.
Then we accuse high school graduates of provincialism!
