This class of 1927 which is popularly supposed to be miles and miles
"off the l)oat" seems to be getting along quite well in spite of such a
terrible handicap.
quarter, these same freshmen (far off the boat) came through
in true Stanford style with a 12-0 victory over the California yearling
football team. The triumph over the Bruin Cubs was rather unexpected
on the basis of preliminary game scores.
Wednesday night, the 1927 basketball team traveled to Berkeley and
once again made the California freshmen "like it." Now some of the
skeptics are beginning to wonder if those frosh are as far off the boat as
they are generally considered to be.
While the class of 1927 has some very brilliant athletes, a great deal of
the credit for its triumphs is due to Coach Hunt. "Husky" is a hard
working mentor, who not only knows the games he is trying to teach, but
he also has the happy faculty of getting his knowledge across to his men.
He gets results and at the same time is very popular with both players
and students as a whole.
