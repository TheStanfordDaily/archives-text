# Crisis
## 
### 
The Stanford varsity basketball team returned from Los Angeles last
night. The same team which broke even in two hard games with U. S. C.
Tuesday and Wednesday faces the crisis of its season tomorrow night
when it meets the University of California quintet in Oakland Auditorium.
Andy Kerr's team is going to need all the support available from the
student body in that game tomorrow night. While the Stanford team was
engaging in two of the hardest games of the season in the south this week,
the California varsity has been resting.
The showing the Cards made against the Trojans indicates that they
have the stuff to make it two straight. They are not going into that game
over-confident but they will be very determined. The outcome of the
game may rest largely with the rooting sections.
Jf such is the case. Andy Kerr and his basketball men need not fear,
l>ecause it is a safe l>et that Rurt Lapp will have a madly excited crowd of
Stanford supporters on hand to furnish plenty of noise.

Wednesday night, the Daily Palo Alto informed eighty-six people who
called by phone for the results of the U. S. C.-Stanford and Stanford-
California freshman basketball games.
The Daily appreciates the interest the students are taking in this
slight service. For the benefit of any who are unable to attend the game
in Oakland tomorrow night, the Daily will have the results at 9:45. To
hear the final score, call Palo Alto 1074.
