SPEAKER IN THE ASSEMBLY
What He Says and
IT indeed gives me great pleasure to
be able to speak before you this morn
ing.
What He Knows He Means
I'M sorry I had to comc dozen here,
but now that I'm lure, I'm going to make
the best of it.
IT affords me especial delight to
speak in such a magnificent auditorium
before such a handsome, intelligent
group of students.
THE auditorium isn't so bad, but you
certainly are an uneasy, stupid looking
crowd. You look as if you haven't had
an intelligent thought in years, lioiv did
you ever get in here, anyway?,
I MUST enjoin you not to succumb
to the common temptations of school
life. Study like a dog. Keep away
from the city, and never allow yourself
any pleasure at all. Sacrifice builds
character and strengthens your back
bone. If you ever have a chance to
have a good time, don't take it. You'll
never make a success that way.
IF yon knew hozv I slid through school
you'd probably hiss vie off the stage,
you're a bunch of green peas for com
ing here anyway. Why didn't you cut?
I used to. Now that you're here, Jwiv
ever, I'm going to get my revenge. I had
to come to these assemblies when I zms
a, freshman, ami I've never forgotten it.
I'm going to stand up here and talk till I
drop. It's my turn now, and you're at
my mercy.
I DO not wish to preach. I merely
intend to point out the dangers and pit
falls of university life.
I. DON'T know anything about zvltat I
was requested to speak on, so I guess I'll
give you a sermonized account of the
mistakes I made at college. That's an
uninteresting subject.
NOW my time is running short, and
I must bring this talk to a close. I have
only one more point to make. I thank
you for your attention, and hope to
have the pleasure of addressing you all
again sometime.
I CAN tell by the zt'ay you're fidgeting
around that you're about ready to pass
out. But I'm not nearly through zvith
you yet. I've got about ten more long
points to make yet, and then I'm going to
summarise my zvhole speech. Maybe
you'll have sense enough to stay azuay
from here next time. Thank God this is
the last time you'll catch me up here.

you'd probably hiss vie off the stage,
you're a bunch of green peas for com
ing here anyway. Why didn't you cut?
I used to. Now that you're here, Jwiv
ever, I'm going to get my revenge. I had
to come to these assemblies when I zms
a, freshman, ami I've never forgotten it.
I'm going to stand up here and talk till I
drop. It's my turn now, and you're at
my mercy.
I DO not wish to preach. I merely
intend to point out the dangers and pit
falls of university life.
I. DON'T know anything about zvltat I
was requested to speak on, so I guess I'll
give you a sermonized account of the
mistakes I made at college. That's an
uninteresting subject.
NOW my time is running short, and
I must bring this talk to a close. I have
only one more point to make. I thank
you for your attention, and hope to
have the pleasure of addressing you all
again sometime.
I CAN tell by the zt'ay you're fidgeting
around that you're about ready to pass
out. But I'm not nearly through zvith
you yet. I've got about ten more long
points to make yet, and then I'm going to
summarise my zvhole speech. Maybe
you'll have sense enough to stay azuay
from here next time. Thank God this is
the last time you'll catch me up here.

SPEAKER IN THE ASSEMBLY
What He Says and
IT indeed gives me great pleasure to
be able to speak before you this morn
ing.
What He Knows He Means
I'M sorry I had to comc dozen here,
but now that I'm lure, I'm going to make
the best of it.
IT affords me especial delight to
speak in such a magnificent auditorium
before such a handsome, intelligent
group of students.
THE auditorium isn't so bad, but you
certainly are an uneasy, stupid looking
crowd. You look as if you haven't had
an intelligent thought in years, lioiv did
you ever get in here, anyway?,
I MUST enjoin you not to succumb
to the common temptations of school
life. Study like a dog. Keep away
from the city, and never allow yourself
any pleasure at all. Sacrifice builds
character and strengthens your back
bone. If you ever have a chance to
have a good time, don't take it. You'll
never make a success that way.
IF yon knew hozv I slid through school
you'd probably hiss vie off the stage,
you're a bunch of green peas for com
ing here anyway. Why didn't you cut?
