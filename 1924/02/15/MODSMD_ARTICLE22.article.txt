# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
Here is, strange fate, another view
point which does not take exception
to anybody, or anything; it does not
accuse the Daily Editor of bias, small
mindedness, or of warping facts; in
fact, it is an unusual viewpoint, as it
is commendatory in tone!
In the last issue of the Stanford
Spectator appeared a suggestion in
the form of an editorial which ap
peared to have real merit. After point
ing out the lack of garage space on
the campus, which has been evident
enough to car-owners for long enough,
and the consequent effect of leaving
student autos bleaching in the sun and
rain, the editor suggested that some
thing be done about it.
Comptroller Roth is evidently will
ing to erect more garage space if he
can be sure that he will not be hold
ing the sack with a lot of nice, new,
and vacant garages on his hands when
he gets through. In order to get some
thing started, Spectator carried a
blank petition on page 151. This view
point is to urge car owners to aid in
securing more garage space by filling
it out, and mailing it, so that a work
ing basis can be obtained, and at least
one step taken towards securing ade
quate facilities for student-owned cars.
