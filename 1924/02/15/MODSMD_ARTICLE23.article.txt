## Martin Sheridan 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Martin Sheridan was one of the most famous American athletes of past
Olympiads. Sheridan won four of his five world's championships in the
discus throw, breaking his first record in 1901.
The Olympic games were held in St. Louis that year, and Sheridan won his
world honors by throwing the discus 128 feet, inches. Sheridan won
both the shot put and the discus at Athens. His win was all the more
remarkable because at the last minute Sheridan was forced to throw with a
Greek discus, which was much clumsier than the American type he was used
to throwing.
At the Fourth Olympiad, held in London in 1908, Sheridan again won three
places, first in Greek and American discus throw, and third in the broad jump.
In 1911 he broke his own world's record in the discus throw for the sixth
time, setting a mark of 141 feet, 4 3-8 inches. His death was mourned by
the entire sporting world.
