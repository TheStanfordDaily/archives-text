Your issue of Thursday, February
14, states that the Stanford Memorial
I
mosaics are not strictly genuiue.
Old European mosaics are stone
mosaics.
Stanford Memorial Church mosaics
are true mosaics but made of glass
unfadeable and probably may last
longer than stone mosaics. Glass'
colors can be made more varied than
colors in stones therefore glass is a
better medium than stone for fabri
cating mosaics.
