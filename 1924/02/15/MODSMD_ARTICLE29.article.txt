# AT 21 YEARS OF AGE
## Professor Robinson Was Teaching English, Civics To European Immigrants 
### 
pROFESSOR Edgar E. Robinson, of
the History department, was writ
ing a thesis on "The Instruction of
Delegates" in American history, and
teaching English and civics to a group
of immigrants from central Europe,
during the spring semester of his sen
ior year at the University of Wiscon
sin when he was 21 years old.
"I learned from them," says Profes
sor Robinson, "that it isn't necessary
to go to Europe to find Bohemia! It
was an eventful spring for me. I had
been associate editor of the Daily
Cardinal, and had represented Wis
consin in debate at Lincoln, Nebraska,
and in the North Oratorical League
contest at lowa City."
Was Regimsntal Adjutant
Professor Robinson was a regiment
al adjutant in the university cadets,
and incidentally a charter member of
Scabbard and Blade, an honorary ca
det society which recently established
a chapter at Stanford.
Representing Wisconsin, he won the
intercollegiate oratorical contest of
the northwestern universities at Chi
cago, with an essay on "John Adams."
This was sent by R. G. Thwaites to
Charles Francis Adams, and brought
him a kindly letter of appreciation.
Work at this time on "The Frontier"
with Dr. Frederick Jackson Turner,
now at Harvard, definitely turned his
interest to history.
During his senior year, Professor
Robinson was a member of President
Van Hise's student council, and be
longed to Iron Cross, senior honor so
ciety. He was a member of the com
mittee which abolished hazing, and
which later initiated a system provid
ing for student advisors to freshmen.
At this time was started the first
intercollegiate magazine in the Middle
West, the short-lived "Wisconsin Spec-

tator," of which Professor Robinson
was editor-in-chief for three months.
He was also correspondent on the
Milwaukee Sentinel, and for a short
time, on the Chicago Examiner.
Was in Newspaper Work
"I interviewed William Jennings
Bryan, La Follette, and Victor Berger,
all candidates for office that year. I
shall never forget the thrill I experi
enced when I learned from Mr. Bryan's
secretary that he would grant me an
interview.
"Although it was twelve years after
Mr. Bryan's first race for the presi
dency, I noticed that he flushed, as if
with embarrassment, every time he
went out on the platform of the train
to address the crowds that gathered.
At a junction point where we stayed
for a time, he lay out on the grass
and went to sleep. When we reached
Mayville, on a stub line from Milwau
kee, a band met us, and my com
panions and I found ourselves in the
midst of a triumphal parade.
Met W. J. Bryan
"I was impressed, as I think of it
now, by Mr. Bryan's tendency to quote
scripture in reply to questions. One
of the correspondents persisted in
calling Mr. Bryan 'Colonel,' referring
to his service in the Spanish war, and
he was not displeased.
"Mr. La Follette impressed me as a
fox terrier, so deadly earnest that he
saw neither himself nor his audience.
Victor Berger's house was lined with
books, not only the study, but the din
ing room and the hall. He seemed any
thing but an agitator."
Upon graduation, Professor Robin
son w;is offered five fellowships, one
in political science and one in history.
He chose the last named, under the
cMrection of Frederick Jackson Tur
ner, at Wisconsin.

ior year at the University of Wiscon
sin when he was 21 years old.
"I learned from them," says Profes
sor Robinson, "that it isn't necessary
to go to Europe to find Bohemia! It
was an eventful spring for me. I had
been associate editor of the Daily
Cardinal, and had represented Wis
consin in debate at Lincoln, Nebraska,
and in the North Oratorical League
contest at lowa City."
Was Regimsntal Adjutant
Professor Robinson was a regiment
al adjutant in the university cadets,
and incidentally a charter member of
Scabbard and Blade, an honorary ca
det society which recently established
a chapter at Stanford.
Representing Wisconsin, he won the
intercollegiate oratorical contest of
the northwestern universities at Chi
cago, with an essay on "John Adams."
This was sent by R. G. Thwaites to
Charles Francis Adams, and brought
him a kindly letter of appreciation.
Work at this time on "The Frontier"
with Dr. Frederick Jackson Turner,
now at Harvard, definitely turned his
interest to history.
During his senior year, Professor
Robinson was a member of President
Van Hise's student council, and be
longed to Iron Cross, senior honor so
ciety. He was a member of the com
mittee which abolished hazing, and
which later initiated a system provid
ing for student advisors to freshmen.
At this time was started the first
intercollegiate magazine in the Middle
West, the short-lived "Wisconsin Spec-

tator," of which Professor Robinson
was editor-in-chief for three months.
He was also correspondent on the
Milwaukee Sentinel, and for a short
time, on the Chicago Examiner.
Was in Newspaper Work
"I interviewed William Jennings
Bryan, La Follette, and Victor Berger,
all candidates for office that year. I
shall never forget the thrill I experi
enced when I learned from Mr. Bryan's
secretary that he would grant me an
interview.
"Although it was twelve years after
Mr. Bryan's first race for the presi
dency, I noticed that he flushed, as if
with embarrassment, every time he
went out on the platform of the train
to address the crowds that gathered.
At a junction point where we stayed
for a time, he lay out on the grass
and went to sleep. When we reached
Mayville, on a stub line from Milwau
kee, a band met us, and my com
panions and I found ourselves in the
midst of a triumphal parade.
Met W. J. Bryan
"I was impressed, as I think of it
now, by Mr. Bryan's tendency to quote
scripture in reply to questions. One
of the correspondents persisted in
calling Mr. Bryan 'Colonel,' referring
to his service in the Spanish war, and
he was not displeased.
"Mr. La Follette impressed me as a
fox terrier, so deadly earnest that he
saw neither himself nor his audience.
Victor Berger's house was lined with
books, not only the study, but the din
ing room and the hall. He seemed any
thing but an agitator."
Upon graduation, Professor Robin
son w;is offered five fellowships, one
in political science and one in history.
He chose the last named, under the
cMrection of Frederick Jackson Tur
ner, at Wisconsin.
