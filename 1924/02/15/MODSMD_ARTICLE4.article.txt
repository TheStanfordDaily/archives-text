# MENACE MERCHANT IS AFTER POUNDS OF FLESH TONIGHT
## Last Dress Rehearsal Presages Big Success For 1924 Ram's Head Burlesque Production 
### Marjorie Allen 
IpHE "Merchant of Menace" is out after his 100 pounds of fiesh tonight! But
against him are two charming ladies, the dainty Mary Miles Minter and the
fair Portia, as well as ten cunning ladies of the chorus who will display their
charms of femininity in the Ram's Head Show of 1924 this evening at 8:15.
The last dress rehearsal promises a good show. Catchy tunes and tricky

steps interwoven into a most intricate plot hold the interest from the time
Gene Trago introduces the show until the curtain goes down on the grand
finale.
Chorus Girls Dainty
; - Ten dainty chorus girls, well versed in the art of shaking their bobbed
curls and using their eyes as well as their legs, give the "girly-girly" element
without which no musical comedy would be complete. They go through the
| intricate steps of the chorus with a nice degree of smoothness and prance

>> around the stage with the required
| amount of dazzling smiles and high
| kicks.
Miller and Sproul Are Hits
Unless we miss our guess, Mary
Miles Minter (Lewis Miller), and
I "Kewp" Sproul, who offers something
: new in housemothers, will be the big
| hits of the evening. Mary is the es
i sence of femininity in all its sweet
' girlishness, etc., etc. You can just tell


The above "ladies" and gentlemen appear in the "Merchant of Menace"
tonight. At the left, Dick Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, as Bassanio and Portia
seem to find plenty to talk about. Louis Miller and Irving Anschutz, portray
ing Mary Miles Minter and Antonio, also apepar to enjoy each other's company.
she writes her letters on perfumed
pink stationery. She dances through
each act with the grace of Irene Castle
and in "Dago Man," her special sing
ing and dancing number in the third
act, and in "Mary," which incidentally
is one of the best tunes of the plays, is
given a good chance to show off. Even
old Shylock (Cuthbert Tibbe) suc
cumbs when she starts vamping him.
The costumes and scenery speak for
themselves. The first act is a riot of
yellows, reds, and blues. Purples and
greens predominate in the second and
third acts. The chorus has five changes
costume, each one more startling
and more brilliantly colored than the
last.
As for the music, it's good. Nearly
all of the songs are bound to get
across and everyone on the campus
will be humming the strain of "Mary"
or "Oley Come Back" for weeks to
come. Don't miss it.

' girlishness, etc., etc. You can just tell


The above "ladies" and gentlemen appear in the "Merchant of Menace"
tonight. At the left, Dick Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, as Bassanio and Portia
seem to find plenty to talk about. Louis Miller and Irving Anschutz, portray
ing Mary Miles Minter and Antonio, also apepar to enjoy each other's company.
she writes her letters on perfumed
pink stationery. She dances through
each act with the grace of Irene Castle
and in "Dago Man," her special sing
ing and dancing number in the third
act, and in "Mary," which incidentally
is one of the best tunes of the plays, is
given a good chance to show off. Even
old Shylock (Cuthbert Tibbe) suc
cumbs when she starts vamping him.
The costumes and scenery speak for
themselves. The first act is a riot of
yellows, reds, and blues. Purples and
greens predominate in the second and
third acts. The chorus has five changes
costume, each one more startling
and more brilliantly colored than the
last.
As for the music, it's good. Nearly
all of the songs are bound to get
across and everyone on the campus
will be humming the strain of "Mary"
or "Oley Come Back" for weeks to
come. Don't miss it.
IpHE "Merchant of Menace" is out after his 100 pounds of fiesh tonight! But
against him are two charming ladies, the dainty Mary Miles Minter and the
fair Portia, as well as ten cunning ladies of the chorus who will display their
charms of femininity in the Ram's Head Show of 1924 this evening at 8:15.
The last dress rehearsal promises a good show. Catchy tunes and tricky

steps interwoven into a most intricate plot hold the interest from the time
Gene Trago introduces the show until the curtain goes down on the grand
finale.
Chorus Girls Dainty
; - Ten dainty chorus girls, well versed in the art of shaking their bobbed
curls and using their eyes as well as their legs, give the "girly-girly" element
without which no musical comedy would be complete. They go through the
| intricate steps of the chorus with a nice degree of smoothness and prance

>> around the stage with the required
| amount of dazzling smiles and high
| kicks.
Miller and Sproul Are Hits
Unless we miss our guess, Mary
Miles Minter (Lewis Miller), and
I "Kewp" Sproul, who offers something
: new in housemothers, will be the big
| hits of the evening. Mary is the es
