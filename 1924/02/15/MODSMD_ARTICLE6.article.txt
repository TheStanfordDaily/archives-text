# Wilson and Roosevelt Only Human, Says Jordan

"Wilson and Roosevelt were only
human after all, and like the rest of
us they had their limitations, but
when slight flaws in big men's charac
ters are spread before the world they
become very large," said Dr. Jordan
in his discussion of "Roosevelt and
Wilson" last evening at his regular
Thursday night conference.
"No man ever reached the pinnacle
and received universal acclaim. Wash
ington, during his lifetime, was called
the step-father of his country, now he
is worshipped as flawless. Abraham
Lincoln was criticized bitterly by his
contemporaries but today he is uni
versally praised. This will be the case
with Roosevelt and Wilson."
"These two men," said Dr. Jordan,
"differ from each other in that Wilson
had his own ideas and wanted to be
obeyed, while Roosevelt liked advice,
and always wanted his friends around
so he could obtain their counsel."
