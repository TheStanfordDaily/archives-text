# WEIGHT FIVE PLAYS BERKELEY TOMORROW
## 145-Pounders Have Improved But Are Not Favorites In Game With Bruins 
### 
With only one veteran on the squad, i
the 145-pound basketball team is
doped to lose tomorrow night against
the California weight men at Okland
in the preliminary to the varsity con- !
test. The light-heavyweights from
Berkeley are said to be almost as good
as the Bear varsity.
Not until last week against San
Mateo junior college did the 145's j
show any promise. Up to that time, |
their teamwork was consistently
ragged, their shooting inaccurate, and
their handling of the ball awkward. j
O'Hara Strengthens Line-Up
O'Hara, varsity substitute, was '
largely responsible for the improve- j
ment last week. Whether or not the
addition of another man from the sec- j
ond varsity ranks will make the 145's j
a winning combination is hard to say. j
Neer or Cornell Will Start
Either Cornell or Neer will start !
with O'Hara at forward. Stewart will
probably start at center, although i
Knox's showing against San Mateo
may ear 4 n him a place early in the
game.
Mangin and Lund have held down
the guard positions all season, and
will probably play through the whole
game. :
The light-heavyweight game will be
played as a preliminary to the varsity
game in the Oakland auditorium at
7 p.m.
