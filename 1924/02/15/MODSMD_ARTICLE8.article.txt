# SEMI-FINAL GAMES IN INTRAMURAL SERIES SLATED FOR MONDAY
## 
### 
With five t.:ams still in the running, j
the semi-finals of the intramural court
championship will be played Monday
night in the Encina gym.
Three of the five teams are unde
feated: the Japanese Club, Delta Tau
Delta, and Phi Delta Theta. Beta Tlieta
Pi and El Tigre meet today to decide 1
League 3, and the winner will play Phi
Delta Theta Monday.
Monday's schedule: 730, Japanese
Club vs. Delta Tau Delta; 8:15, Phi
;
Delta Theta vs. winner of Beta-El ,
Tigre game.
Last year the Betas carried off the
pennant, and they stand a good chance !
to repeat, with four of last year's
veterans in their line-up: Alabaster, j
Tibbe, Dole, and Granger. There is a
possibility that Mannoccir, another
veteran, will be eligible for the re-!
maining games.
El Tigre boasts two of last year's 1
veterans: Woodhead and Butterfield.
While they have lost one game to the i
Betas, they defeated Delta Chi, which
was the only team to down the Betas.
Delta Tau Delta, runner up to the
Betas last year, has five last year's j
men back, Colgan, de Back, Collett, j
Mixon and Meyer. They have been I
showing great stuff, and should make
a strong bid for the title.
Logan, Fletcher, and O'Hara are
playing a second time for the Phi
Delts. With the addition of Playter at
forward and Flood at standing guard
the Phi Delts have developed an
ability to work together which is
likely to puzzle the best of them.
The Japanese Club also has three
veterans in Mizota, Murata, and Sano.
Kitow and Koba, new men, strengthen
the team materially, both having
starred in recent games. Although the
Club-men are somewhat handicapped
by their shortness of stature, they
more than make up for it by their sur
prising quickness in covering thfe
floor.
