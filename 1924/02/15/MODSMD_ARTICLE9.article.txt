## HAYWARD HIGH TEAM TO MEET FRESHMEN 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseballers are
i conceded an edge over the Hayward
I high school nine which they meet to
morrow at 10 o'clock on the varsity
i diamond.
Last year's yearlings succeeded in
j beating Hayward by a decisive score
in both of the games played. The
prep school men are supposed to have
! a stronger aggregation this year and
j as yet the freshmen have had 110 real
I test of their strength.
New Battery May Start
! Coach Hunt will probably start a
new battery with "Bob" Baillard be
| hind the bat and Linquest 011 the
mound. Baillard captained the fresh
man soccer team and has just come
out for baseball, whilg Linquest has
been playing in the infield. Both of
these men have shown considerable
j class.
Oesthouse and Collins are the other
freshman twirlers. Oesthouse has been
I showing up particularly well, and he
will probably be called on to relieve
Linquest if he fails to deliver the
goods.
