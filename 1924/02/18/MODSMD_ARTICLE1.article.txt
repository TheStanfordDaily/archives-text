# JOURNALISM TO BE SUBJECT OF MONITOR EDITOR
## Willis J. Abbott Will Speak On Clean Handling of News Tomorrow 
### 
"Clean Journalism" will be the sub
ject of a talk by Willis J. Abbott, edi
tor and publisher of the Christian
Science Monitor, tomorrow afternoon
at 4:15 in the Little Theatre.
The Christian Science Monitor, ac
cording to Abbot, has the most wide
spread circulation in the world, going
into the libraries of more public men
and foreign embassies than any other
paper, even eclipsing in this respect
the Manchester Guardian which stands
high in this class of subscribers.
Many Correspondents
More cable material is received by
the Monitor than any other six-day
paper as it has a larger corps of Euro
pean correspondents than any other
publication. This fact is astonishing
because >.he paper does not syndicate
any of this news. Newspapers such as
the New York Times, Chicago Tri
bune, and Philadelphia Ledger syndi
cate the stories their correspondents
send them for circulation outside their
own territory. The Monitor cannot do
this because it does not recognize any
place on earth as being outside its
own territory. This is Abbot's explana
tion of why the paper does not syndi
cate this news. Their European cor
respondence is centered at London in
a four-story building devoted exclu
sively to the activities of the Chris
tian Science Monitor.
An idea of the variety of Abbot's
newspaper experience can be gained
from the fact that he was a Hearst
newspaper man and editorial writer
for many years and is now editor of
the Christian Science Monitor, whose
journalistic standards are universally
recognized as being of the highest.
Abbot has been prominent as a writ
er on political topics from Washing
ton for interior newspapers, and has
written many magazine articles and
stories.
The American Journalists Associa
tion, which is sponsoring the lecture,
cordially invites anybody to hear
Abbot talk.
