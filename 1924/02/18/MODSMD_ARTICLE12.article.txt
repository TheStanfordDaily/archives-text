# Office Boy Shocked at Profane Vocabulary of Card Basketball Fans
## 
### 
"Thank you" and "Oh! My "
represent the range of various ex- !
clamations heard over the Daily Palo 1
Alto telephone from 102 disappointed j
inquirers who called for the results j
of the Stanford-California game Sat- j
urday night. "Thank you" was the
answer from the majority of calls, but
the shrill feminine scream of disap
pointment caused the office boy to
jerk the receiver from his ear more j
than once.
Among the outstanding phrases |
used, the office dog jotted down the
following: "Oh H ," "Oh my,"
"Uuuuuuh," "O-o-o-o-o-o-o-h," "Oh! Ter-,
rible," "Oh deah," "Horrible!" "Oh;
Judas," "Oh Gee," "What, 26 to 25?"
"Too bad," "Son-of-a-gun," "Well, I'll
be d ." Several were registered
which could not be illustrated in cold
print.
