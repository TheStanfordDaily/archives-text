# era CHORUS LADIES APPEAR IN RAM'S HEAD
## Van Deusen, Lippincott as Serenaders Have Finish Of Professionals 
### Katherine Capell 
Clever chorus numbers and excel
lent individual acting lifted Friday
night's performance of Ram's Head's
"Merchant of Menace" from the ranks
of the commonplace in burlesque. The
chorus director. Miss Eyre, deserves
much credit for the ease with which
her "girls" went through their steps
and coquetted with the audience in a
truly feminine manner.
Van Deusen and Lippincott, in their
serenade number, displayed the snap
and finish of professional vaudeville
artists, and were by far the best fea
ture number of the program.
Not Much Plot
The plot? Naturally there wasn't
much. But what there was failed to
appear until Act 11. Gene Trago's
unique in production, however, gave
the play a momentum which, aided by
the musical numbers, carried it
through the first act.
Jokes Subtle
Some of the jokes were too subtle
for most of the audience and some
failed to get across either through
sheer inaninity, or because of faulty
enunciation on the part of the actors.
The girlish sweetness of Louis Mil
ler as Mary Miles Minter was, on the
whole, screamingly funny, although
at times it became rather too saccha
rine.
Irving Anscliutz, in the character
of Antonio, did some excellent work,
especially in his musical numbers.
The role of Portia gave Lloyd Nolan
very little opportunity to demonstrate
musical or dramatic talent.
Shylock, as interpreted by Cuthbert
Tibbe, was an admirable take-off on
the original. His solo number,
"Lonely," enabled him to display an
unusually good voice, but, coming as
it did at the end of the play, its ef
fectiveness was decidedly weakened.
Many Song Hits
"He's a Ku Klux Klan," sung by
Diogenes (Ted Van Deusen) and Na
poleon (Gardiner Lippincott) was the
snappiest musical piece on the pro
gram. The orchestral effects ought to
make it popular on the campus as
dance music.
"Oley Vent Away" was another en
livening feature of the second act.
Charles Simons as Nerissa. the Swed
ish maid, put originality and humor
into his singing, and the manner in
which he answered the enthusiastic
encore was a stroke of genius.
Antonio's "Soap Sud Sobs" was
helped materially by the costumes and
steps of the chorus. "Tell It to the
Judge" may have been a good song,
but the jury failed entirely to get it
across to the audience.
Most of the cast did creditable
work, but were not oustanding as comi
cal characters. Milton Teague got a
hearty laugh for the few lines he had
to speak as Abraham Isaac Levinstein.
End of Last Act Flat
The end of the last act fell rather
flat, perhaps because it was so abrupt.
In its entirety, however, the perform
ance was diverting to listen to, and it
was easy to look at, thanks to colorful
scenery and a variety of costumes.
