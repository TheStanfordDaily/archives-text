# Speed

Speed maniacs have been running wild on the campus in the last few
weeks. Crossing the road between Encina and the car tracks or the street
in front of the Post Office is a dangerous business.
Student car owners, though the most frequent offenders, are not en
tirely to blame. Palo Alto delivery trucks speed up and down Lasuen and
Salvatierra at a dangerously fast rate.
The flying squadron of speed cops which preyed on speeders along
Palm drive a few* weeks ago aroused a great deal of indignation on the
campus. However, the pedestrian found the campus a very safe place
while it was known that the officers were here.
It should not be necessary to enlist the aid of the officers of the law to
stamp out Demon Speed here. It is the duty of every student who owns
an automobile to operate it in such a way that he will not endanger the
lives of other people. Certainly, the honor system should apply in such a
case as much as in a classroom examination.
There are many ways in which the authorities may go about abolishing
reckless driving. It seems that the most logical method would be to de
prive speeders of the right to operate motor vehicles on the campus for a
short time. A second offense would justify a permanent injunction against
the driver.
It should be an easy matter to punish deliverymen who drive recklessly.
If the firms they represent are prevented from making deliveries on the
campus by automobile for a time, pressure would soon be brought to bear
on the drivers to impress on them the necessity for sane driving.
