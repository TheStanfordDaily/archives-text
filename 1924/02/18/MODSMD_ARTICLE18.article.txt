Ram's Head society deserves credit for presenting one of its best plays
in years, last Friday night.
"The Merchant of Menace" far surpassed last year's production in
every way. The chorus was well drilled and showed the results of the
training all through the show. The principal characters were well-cast, for
the most part, and they kept the audience in an uproar nearly all the time.
The spirit of the show was well carried out in both make-ups and cos
tumes. Fortunately, the roughs who came armed with vegetables did no
damage, as nobody paid much attention to them.
