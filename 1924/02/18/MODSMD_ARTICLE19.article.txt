# "Thanks"
## 
### 
Last week, the Dramatic Manager placed a poster advertising the
Ram's Head show on the bulletin board at the Post Office.
In the center of the bill, a note was placed, asking that it remain until
after the show. At the bottom of the appeal was the word, "THANKS."
A few hours after he had placed it there, the Dramatic Manager re
turned and found that nothing remained but the "THANKS."
Incidentally, the poster had taken something like three hours of work.
