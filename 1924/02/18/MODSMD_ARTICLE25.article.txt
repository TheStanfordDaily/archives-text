No. 6—Alonzo Abstains.
Alonzo swears off smoking. Alonzo
has wonderful will power. He can stop
doing anything. Just like that.
He took a girl out. And swore he
wouldn't kiss her that night. But the
girl had other plans. Anyway, Alonzo
swore off. Give him credit for that.
But he swore off smoking. He knew
it would be no trouble at all to quit.
Cigarettes have no hold over him. He
stopped smoking seventeen times last
year. He was sick for seven months.
That was one of the times. The other
sixteen lapses were caused by sheer will
power. On the part of his intimates.
They refused to supply him. So he quit.
He decides to cut them down grad
ually this time. From consuming
twelve of his own and eighteen
mooched from various sources, he
makes up his mind to stop smoking
his own.
It isn't hard. He very seldom has
any. And when you haven't any cigar
ettes, you can't smoke. That's an ob
vious fact. But an awful mistake. You
don't know Alonzo.
The second day he lights up only
eight cigarettes. But he borrows lots
o£ butts. He's not proud.
Finally he cuts out smoking alto
gether.
He's sick again. —B. A.
