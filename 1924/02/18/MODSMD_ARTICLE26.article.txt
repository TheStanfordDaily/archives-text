# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Hark to the zvail of an old timer zvho
still lizrs in the days of the past, those
flood old days that zee hear so much about.
IVlien in-en were men and roughs were
roughs.
We fear that "Old Timer" fails to take
into consideration that "times is chang
ing."
Editor D. P. A.,
Dear Sir:
I hesitated this morning before
putting on the old flannel shirt and
cords. If I had thought that your "Dis
grace" editorial Thursday was either
a logical or justifiable indictment of
the "rough," I should not have donned
the insignia of the tribe.
I do not believe that "The Stanford
rough has fallen into disrepute." Cer
tainly he has if the imputation of
theft in your editorial is justifiable.
That the theft happened I do not
doubt. Indisputably some one took the
missing articles; but there is nothing
(in your editorial at least) which jus
tifies your imputation of the theft to
the roughs there; much less that the
rough in general is in disrepute be
cause of such theft.
It seems that you regard the fact
that they had done "other ungentle
manly things the same night," as a
justification for your imputation of
theft. I hold no brief for those guilty
of such acts as you mention, but the
inference that they stole is certainly
not logically justifiable from those
facts alone. Yet no other justification
appears in your editorial.
Your allusion to the other clothing
losses of the unfortunate gentleman
who lost his hat, must be taken as a
parenthetical space filler. Certainly so j

far as any connection with the "Dis
grace" of the rough is concerned it is
irrelevant."
I, and I believe all the roughs, agree
with you that acts of boorishness and
vandalism are inexcusable in Stanford
men. Does it logically follow, however,
that the roughs in general are "in
disrepute" because of such acts at the
dance iu question?
You have, I believe, confused the
"rough" with, and blamed him for, the
activities of a totally distinct (regret
tably not extinct) animal. It may be
that now "roughing" a dance includes
going into the ballroom; if so, such
customs are new for the roughs. The
real rough "came to scoff." (In both
senses of the world if there happened
to be any chance for eats). He did
not wish any any way to participate
in nor to interfere with the pleasures
of his more giddy brethren. After
watching some time to see "What do
they see in that darn stuff?" failing as
usual to discover it, he went away
making caustic remarks about the san
ity of the dancing people.
The rough feels the same still, I
daresay, and says regarding those who
kept the seats, etc.:
» . Those weren't roughs;
those were disappointed snakes!"
