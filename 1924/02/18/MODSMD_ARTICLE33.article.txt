# FRESHMEN PREPARE FOR BEAR CONTEST
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt Is putting the
fiinishing touches on his freshman
basketball team for the second game
with the California freshmen which
will take place in the pavilion Wed
nesday evening.
Babes Win From Bears
The Babes won the first game of the
series last week by a score of 29
to 22. This vistory, together with the
fact that the coming game is on the
home court,give the Stanford players
a decided advantage. Overconfidence
is a word not found in the Babe vo
cabulary and there is little danger
of it entering in to upset the play of
the yearling five. Although no other
Stanford team can defeat California
it now seems like a safe bet that the
freshmen can do it twice in a row.
La6t Game Rough
The game last week was except
ionally rough. The California players
seemed to forget all rules of clean
play when the score went against
them, and the referee let them get
away with it. However, the officiating
will be better Wednesday, and a
clean, fast game is promised.
Superior team play was the big
factor in the victory last week. The
California squad has a number of
stars but they do not work together.
David Stars In First tilt
David was the big star of the first
game. He caged seven baskets during
the contest. He will probably be
closely covered Wednesday and so
the chief work of scoring may fall to
Captain Price and Jayred. Price and
David will play at forwards positions,
Jayred the center, and Shipkey and
Newhouse, guards.
