# TALES FROM THE ARCHIVES
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY OF STANFORD'S BUILDINGS No. 3. STANFORD LIBRARY 
### Esther Greenacre 
The growth of the Stanford library
from the small collection of 3,000
books to the present total of over
300,000 volumes coincides with the
gradual development of the University
and has been made possibly only by
the contributions and untiring efforts
of officers and friends of the institu
tion.
Library in Law Building
When the University first opened in
1891, the main library occupied the
room now known as the law library
and was a miscellaneous collection of
literature and governmental docu
ments. The one large reading room
was capable of holding 100 students.
Edwin H. Woodruff, now Dean of the
Law School of Cornell University, was
the first Stanford librarian. During the

first few years, the students obtained
the majority of their works from the
private libraries of professors. In 1891
a valuable gift of 2,000 books on rail
roads, the nucleus of the Hopkins rail
way library, was made by Timothy
Hopkins, who has since made many
important contributions to the library.
Following the death of Senator
Stanford in 1893, a period of severe
financial stringency occurred. During
this time few funds were available for
the purchase of books.
New Library in 1900
By 1900 the first home of the library
had been outgrown and a new library,
the present Administration building,
was built in the outer quadrangle at a
cost of $300,000, the gift of Thomas
Welton Stanford of Australia. The
library, which consisted of about 50,-
000 volumes, was transferred to the
new building through the voluntary
work of about 250 students, who stag
gered from the law building to the
administration building with their
heavy loads.
Today the Administration building
is completely transformed from its
appearance twenty-three years ago
when it served as a library. The huge
lobby was then a reading room filled
with rows of desks. Stacks occupied
the rear of the first floor where the
registrar's offices are now. The Presi
dent's office was a secluded periodical
room. Comptroller Roth's section
served as a catalogue room and the
books of Timothy Hopkins lined the
walls of the room where the dean of
men now is located. The upstairs of
fices were used as seminar rooms,
each one beinÂ£ devoted to books on
a certain subject.
Earthquake Destroys Library
In 1904 it became apparent that the
new quadrangle building would not be
sufficient very long for the rapidly in
creasing library. This fact and the
inadequate protection of the quad
rangle structure from fire led to the
construction by Mrs. Stanford of a
handsome buliding in front of the
Quadrangle buildings. To lessen the
expense of the undertaking, iron
girders were omitted from the build
ing. As a consequence, when the earth
quake of 1906 occurred the new li
brary, which was yet unoccupied, was
entirely demolished save for its huge
iron dome. The wild swaying of this
dome during the quake served to
weaken the substantial building and
at the end of the disaster it alone re
mained, standing grotesquely aloft on
its four supports. It was not deemed
economical to restore the building,
and in 1913 the Trustees decided to
have constructed a library which
should be adequate in size for the de
mands of many years to come and
which should be fireproof.
George T. Clark, librarian of the
San Francisco public library and for
merly connected with the library of
the University of California, was se
cured as head librarian in 1907. Plans
for the new library were worked out
in co-operation between Mr. Clark
and the architects, the present beauti
ful and thoroughly equipped building
being the result of their detailed
work.
