## Pianist, Violinist and Cellist To Play Tomorrow Night In Assembly Hall 
### 
Miss Lois Adler, pianist, and Wen
ceslao Villalpando, cellist, will be di
rected by Orley See, violinist, in giv
ing a musical program at 7:30 tomor
row evening in the Assembly hall.
The numbers presented by the trio
will include Trio Op. 1, No. 3, by
Beethoven, and Trio "Dumkv," Op. 90,
by Dvorak.
Dvorak Composition Unusual
Dvorak's composition is mad-e up of
short and constantly changing sec
tions. Dumky comes from the word
meaning "little Russia," and is used
by Dvorak in his chamber music to
denote the melodies that are slow and
melancholy in character. The trio is
largely a succession of Dumky inter
spersed with livlier dance-like melo
dies of Bohemian character.
Concerts Since Childhood
See played in public for the first
time at the age of seven, later won
a scholarship in Denison University
conservatory, and eventually became
an instructor there. His style was fur
ther finished by study with Sol Mar
cosson, Hugo Heerman, and Theodore
Spiering.
He played in the Cincinnati Sym
phony Orchestra, and was for several
seasons a member of the San Fran-
Koven, and was a member of the
Rakeman Quartet. Villalpando has
been associated with chamber music
in San Francisco for a number of
years, as he has played in the Lyric
Quartet, Beel Quartet, and the Mans
feldt-di Grassi-Villalpando Trio. He
has been in the Symphony Orchestra
in San Francisco since its beginning.
