# PHILHARMONIC TRIO WILL GIVE RECITAL
## Pianist, Violinist and Cellist To Play Tomorrow Night In Assembly Hall 
### 
Miss Lois Adler, pianist, and Wen
ceslao Villalpando, cellist, will be di
rected by Orley See, violinist, in giv
ing a musical program at 7:30 tomor
row evening in the Assembly hall.
The numbers presented by the trio
will include Trio Op. 1, No. 3, by
Beethoven, and Trio "Dumkv," Op. 90,
by Dvorak.
Dvorak Composition Unusual
Dvorak's composition is mad-e up of
short and constantly changing sec
tions. Dumky comes from the word
meaning "little Russia," and is used
by Dvorak in his chamber music to
denote the melodies that are slow and
melancholy in character. The trio is
largely a succession of Dumky inter
spersed with livlier dance-like melo
dies of Bohemian character.

time at the age of seven, later won
