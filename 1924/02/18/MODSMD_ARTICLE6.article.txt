# SMITHS IN LEAD IN CENSUS AT U. S. C.
## 
### 
The clan of "Smith" has the edge
at 11. S. C. according to a recent cen
sus. There are 52 varieties. The Mil
lers come next with 37. Twenty-five
apiece have been checked up for the
J Wilsons and Johnsons. Tho Jones fam
l ily make a poor showing in compari
| son to their usual supremacy in num-
I hers, having but 24 delegates to the
Trojan convention. Andersons, Adams
es, Browns, and Whites are in the van.
while few Blacks darken the doors of
j the Methodist institution.
