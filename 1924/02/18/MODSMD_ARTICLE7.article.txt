# SECOND CAGE GAME GOES TO CALIFORNIA, 26 TO 25
## Stanford Loses Chance to Win In Last Minute of Play When McHose Converts Foul 
### David Meiklejohn 
I ADY Luck smiled favorably on the California quintet last Saturday nighr
and gave the Bruins the one point margin of a 26 to 25 score against Stan
ford in the Oakland Auditorium.
From start to finish the game was a perfect melee of fight, fouls, and
questionable roughness.
Stanford led in the first half by 14 to 12, but the game was too close
throughout the period to give either team any advantage.
Game Starts Raggedly
Both teams were nervous when they took the fjoor at the start fo the game.
Passing was broken up, and held balls were common. Finally, Higgins,
California center, sneaked under the Stanford goal, and receiving a well
placed pass from Talt from the middle of the court, scored the first points.
McHose dribbled the ball through the California defensive and evened the
score on a field goal; Steele followed with another field shot from the side of
the court, and Nevers converted a personal. Stanford led 5 to 2.
Bears Go Ahead
Nevers came back and put Stanford in the lead with a field goal from center.
California then staged a terrific comeback which put them ahead of the
Cards, 8 to 7, only to have McHose tie the score on Belasco's foul.
The score waltzed back and forth in hectic fashion, first one team breaking
the lead, and the other five evening the count. Nevers' score from the field

gave Stanford the two point advantage«
in the first half.
California started a rushing offens
ive in the second period which tied
the score at 14 to 14. Mcßurney
scored and Stanford took the lead; a
double personal on Mcßurney and
Houvenin resulted in an additional
point for each team. Stanford 17, Cali
fornia 15.
Bears Stage Spurt
A field and free throw by Talt, a
field goal by Belasco put California
ahead 21 to 17. McHose reduced the
advantage two points, but the Bears
shot their last five points of the game
in a short space of playing. Nevers

converted a foul on Talt, and shot a
field goal. McHose put in a free throw,
and brought the score 26 to 23.
Stanford's only chance to win came
i after the gun had been fired, but with
i two personal fouls remaining to be
thrown. McHose called Moody aside.
The play was evident. McHose was to
shoot one free throw, and miss the
next, putting the ball back into play.
But at this point Lady Luck shook
| her head in disfavor; for, the first
! ball converted, and the spectators
; waiting in tense silence for the next
step, the ball rolled lazily about the
hoop, dropped in, and Stanford had
lost.
"Cow" Oliva did not play at his
usual position of standing guard, and
Shipkey took his place throughout the
game. Shipkey played with every atom
of fight that he possessed, and while
the California plays were circling his
territory with increasing regularity,
the big standing guard blocked the
Bruin offensive at more than one stage
of the game.
