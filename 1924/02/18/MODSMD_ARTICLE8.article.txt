# BETAS WIN FROM EL TIGRE, 24-8, IN DECISIVE CONTEST
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi won the title of
League 3 and the right to play to
night in the semi-finals of the intra
mural court series, by defeating El
Tigre, 24-8, Friday in a decisive game.
The Betas put up an air-tight defense,
allowing El Tigre few tries at the
basket. The latter scored no field
goals in the first half, but in the
second period Woodhead and Butter
field each connected for a basket.
These, rvvith three free throws by
Wodhead and one by Butterfield, were
El Tigre's only tallies.
Betas Score Evenly
Scoring for the Betas was well dis
tributed. Alabaster, Granger, and
Smith each accounted for three bas
kets, Sproul for two, and Tibbe for
one. Foul shooting was particularly
poor, not a single one of the eight free
throws finding the hoop.
Granger was the nrst man to score,
caging one in the opening play. El
Tigre seemed to have difficulty in
handling the ball, and its only score
was a free throw by Woodhead to
ward the end of the half, leaving the
count 10-1.
Many Fouls Called
Roughness marred both periods,
and fouls were called freely. Two men
had three personals, and most of the
players had at least one.
In the second half the Betas con
tinued to boost thescore. Toward the
end of the game they became careless,
and El Tigre chalked up two field
goals before the Betas could tighten.
There were no individual stars on
the Beta team. All worked together in
both offensive and defensive tactics.
The guarding was well above average.
