Footwear of Good Quality Only
This Season s Oxford Styles for men are particularly
Good Looking. The fuller toes (often made soft) as
sure complete COMFORT. Fine materials and fine
workmanship hold these shoes to the lines of their style
—they will not quickly become "sloppy."
The values are "right"—you're sure to get your
money's worth because they are priced on a basis of
QUALITY only.
We would like to show you a New Model made by
Thompson of Brockton—it has three distinctively dif
ferent features—in black or tan thistle calfskin.
