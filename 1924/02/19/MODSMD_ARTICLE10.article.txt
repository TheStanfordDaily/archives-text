# CLUBHOUSE HAS BIRTHDAY
## Building Was Opened Nine Years Ago But Not Wholly Completed Until 1923 
### 
I Nine years ago last evening the
, doors of the Women's Clubhouse were
thrown open for the first, time. This
meant the realization of plans and ef
forts towards which women students
and alumnae had been concentrating
I their efforts for seven years, according
to Mrs. E. P. Cubberley, member of
| the Clubhouse Board of Directors,
At this time the third floor was !
without partitions and staircases, and
the second floor was no better, except
I that, due to the efforts of Cap and
Gown, the dancing floor had been in- j
stalled.
The clubhouse now stands complet- '
led as to building, and although it is
not as well furnished as could be !
wished, it is well equipped to serve its
i various purposes, Mrs. Cubberley says. ,
The women's organizations are at !
home there without charge, but all are
working toward the removal of the
debt still hanging over five buildings.
At First Clubhouse Incomplete j
When the clubhouse opened, the
I sum of $14,000 had been raised, and
$6,000 more had been borrowed, with
which the outside walls and roof had
been erected, and (he lower floor part
ly finished and furnished.
The approximate total cost of the
clubhouse with its furnishings, $40,000,
is all paid, except $3,000.
I Most of fhe money was raised in

comparatively small amounts. Two
gifts of $1000 have been received from
wives of University Trustees, in ad
dition to a donation of .$2OO, half a
dozen of $100, and many individual
gifts of smaller amounts. There were
also 325 Life Memberships at twenty
five dollars each.
Debt Paid Slowly
The great bulk of the debt has been
discharged through the efforts of the
women's organizations. The largest
amounts contributed were from Cap
and Gown and the Resident Alumnae,
though co-operation lias been given
by the Women's League, Women's
Conference, Women's Athletic Associ
ation, Christian Association, La Liana,
Collegiate Alumnae, and Faculty Wo
men's Club.
In the spring of 1018, $4000 was bor
rowed from the University and used
to finish off the second and third floors
as they are now. The Social Dramatic
Club assisted in fixing up the stage,
and the Resident Alumnae finished
and furnished the reading room.
The guest room, a memorial to Mar
g iret Post Stolz, an ardent Clubhouse
v orker, was installed the summer of
mo.
