# CHAPPIE SET FOR WEDDING WITH JESTER
## 
### 
That loud crash, Heloise, was just
the breaking of the windows over in
the Press building. And what made
the windows break? Why, Chappie
broke them with his silver hammer.
And why did Chappie break the win
dows with his silver hammer? Why,
he had just finished reading the fol
lowing full-page advertisement in the
last issue of the Columbia Jester —
"The La Vie Parisienne Number":
"The Laughing Association
"Invites you to attend the temporary
marriage of its Wayward Cub"
"THE COLUMBIA JESTER
"To
"THE STANFORD CHAPARRAL
"Upon the occasion of the next issue
"The bride will be charmingly ar
rayed in chaps and a wild, western
lariat.
"The groom will wear a pair of
sophisticated spats and a tasteful silk
shirt.
"Bridesmaids: The Messrs. Edward
Bok and Upton Sinclair. (Ballet skirts
and toppers.)
"The Secretary of the Interior will
perform the ceremony. Tickets will
cost thirty cents each, at all news
stands. Do buy one!"
"NOW THAT," remarked Chappie,
just after breaking the windows, "is a
blankety-blank libel. The Ancient One
ain't no bride."
But, with a blush, he added that
whatever you call the affair, it WILL
take place next Thursday, at high
eight o'clock.
