# MOVIE FIRM OFFERS PRIZE FOR SCENARIO ON STANFORD LIFE
## 
### 
The Raymond Nichols Company is
offering a $100 prize for the best Stan
ford motion picture written by a stu
dent now attending the University.
The scenario must give a complete
view of Stanford life as it exists to
day. in order that the beauty of the
Quad and typical campus scenes may
be introduced.
Pictures will be taken on the cam
pus, with the students as actors.
Rules concerning the contest were
given out by Professor H. D. Gray of
the English department, who, with
Mr. Raymond of the film company and
John E. McDowell, alumni secretary,
will read the manuscripts. The rules
are as follows:
All manuscripts must be submitted
to the committee before March 10.
Manuscripts should be addressed to
Dr. Gray and left in his office, or with
the secretary of the English depart
ment.
Manuscripts must be signed by a
fictitious name, and should bear a
sealed envelope containing the true
name of the author.
No technical knowledge of the con
tinuity form is necessary. The story
may be handled in either continuity or
story form, but should approach as
nearly as possible, the form the writer
desires for the presentation of the
play. If the story is good, the form
will be changed to correct scenario
form.
The story should be three reels in
length (a reel is 1000 feet of film.)
This means that the picture should
last from forty to forty-five minutes,
and should contain about 300 scenes.
The scenes must be in the exterior,
and so constructed as to show com
pletely the life at Stanford and the
beauty of the University.
The story should NOT be an edu
cational film, but it will not be ac
cepted if it is like the typical moving
picture romance. The salient appeal
must be in the portrayal of Stanford
life and not the appeal of the regula
tion motion picture.
The company wants to produce a
film which will appeal to the people
of the state and country who have an
interest in Stanford, and especially
the alumni.
Dr. Gray says of the contest: "Cer
tainly the film, if it is accepted, must
be a fair and worthy representation
of Stanford. We wish the friends of
Stanford and the alumni to realize
Stanford life at its best, as it is today.
That is why no cheap or sensational
story typical of motion pictures will
be accepted. A genuinely human story
of college life today set as to bring
in the beauty and variety of the cam
pus, will prove the successful story."
Questions regarding the picture
should be sent to Professor Gray, who
will answer them from time to time
by general statements in the Daily
Palo Alto.

of Stanford. We wish the friends of
Stanford and the alumni to realize
Stanford life at its best, as it is today.
That is why no cheap or sensational
story typical of motion pictures will
be accepted. A genuinely human story
of college life today set as to bring
in the beauty and variety of the cam
pus, will prove the successful story."
Questions regarding the picture
should be sent to Professor Gray, who
will answer them from time to time
by general statements in the Daily
Palo Alto.

The Raymond Nichols Company is
offering a $100 prize for the best Stan
ford motion picture written by a stu
dent now attending the University.

view of Stanford life as it exists to
day. in order that the beauty of the
Quad and typical campus scenes may
be introduced.
Pictures will be taken on the cam
pus, with the students as actors.
Rules concerning the contest were
given out by Professor H. D. Gray of
the English department, who, with
Mr. Raymond of the film company and
John E. McDowell, alumni secretary,
will read the manuscripts. The rules
are as follows:
All manuscripts must be submitted
to the committee before March 10.
Manuscripts should be addressed to
Dr. Gray and left in his office, or with
the secretary of the English depart
ment.
Manuscripts must be signed by a
fictitious name, and should bear a
sealed envelope containing the true
name of the author.
No technical knowledge of the con
tinuity form is necessary. The story
may be handled in either continuity or
story form, but should approach as
nearly as possible, the form the writer
desires for the presentation of the
play. If the story is good, the form
will be changed to correct scenario
form.
The story should be three reels in
length (a reel is 1000 feet of film.)
This means that the picture should
last from forty to forty-five minutes,
and should contain about 300 scenes.
The scenes must be in the exterior,
and so constructed as to show com
pletely the life at Stanford and the
beauty of the University.
The story should NOT be an edu
cational film, but it will not be ac
cepted if it is like the typical moving
picture romance. The salient appeal
must be in the portrayal of Stanford
life and not the appeal of the regula
tion motion picture.
The company wants to produce a
film which will appeal to the people
of the state and country who have an
interest in Stanford, and especially
the alumni.
Dr. Gray says of the contest: "Cer
tainly the film, if it is accepted, must
be a fair and worthy representation
of Stanford. We wish the friends of
Stanford and the alumni to realize
Stanford life at its best, as it is today.
That is why no cheap or sensational
story typical of motion pictures will
be accepted. A genuinely human story
of college life today set as to bring
