# STANFORD FIVE TO REST BEFORE BEAR GAME ON SATURDAY
## California Contests With Trojans in South Will Decide Triple Tie 
### 
This week will see the culmination
of the existing triple tie of the south
ern half of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence between Stanford, U. S. C., and
the University of California quintets.
California will go south to meet the
Trojans in a two-game series. The
Bears have played but four games to
the Trojans' six, and should the Bears
or the Trojans win both contests it
will put them in a commanding posi
tion for conference honors.
Meanwhile the Cards will be taking
a much-needed rest, practicing only
to keep in shape for the coming clash
with tire Bruins next Saturday at Stan
ford.
Coach Andy Kerr is planning only
the lightest kind of workouts, allow
ing the injured players to get back on
their feet.
Cards Crippled
Guidon Steele is still troubled with
his sprained wrist, the result of an
injury in the last Berkeley fracas, but
it is probable that he will be in the
line-up Saturday. Oliva, on the other
hand, is in critical condition, and un
less his knee shows signs of rapid re
covery in the next few days, it is
doubtful whether or not Kerr will at
tempt to use him at the guard posi
tion.
The rest of the players are in
slightly better shape, but all are in
need of rest, following the gruelling
grind of the southern trip, and the
concentrated warfare of the last Bruin
game. Nevers, who was made the
brunt of most of the California rough
ness, is not in top form, but this
week's rest ought to put him in condi
tion.
The lack of dependable substitutes
has become evident in the results of
the last two conference games. When
Substitutes replace varsity players a
weakness is at once noticeable.
