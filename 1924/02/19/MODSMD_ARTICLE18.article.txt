# Narrowness 2. THE NATION
## 
### 
A university is supposedly a place in which we prepare ourselves for
the wild scramble we shall meet in earning our living, and, later on, in
tackling bigger jobs. Is it? Is Stanford such a place?
Think back over the conversation you have had today —all of it. Was
any mention made of even one or two of the most seiious pioblems
which confront the nation ?
Mr. Doheny lent Mr. Fall $100,000 a couple of years ago, and then
tore the signature oft the promissory note. 1 lave you discussed that fact
with anybody around the campus ?
Jt is proposed to send the Shenandoah to the North Pole to discovei
for the United States a possible "lost continent" in the middle of the
Arctic wastes; and a vigorous opposition has decried the attempt because
of its alleged foolhardiness. All those who even know what the Shenan
doah is, please stand up.
Over 400,000 working men were doomed to a year of disappointment
in their hopes of better wages, at the United Mine \\ orkers convention
recently. Have we anything in common with coal miners—or are we such
a privileged group apart that we can neglect them entirely along with the
rest of the world outside our campus?
We instinctively deny the charge of narrowness and provincialism.
Take thirty seconds off, though, and think back over the day and the
week. Have you heard even a mention of any national problems by a
Stanford man or woman?
If not —is not that absurd one-sidedness?
