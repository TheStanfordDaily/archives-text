Stanford and University of California Boards of Athletic Control are
to be the guests of Dr. T. M. Williams and Professor J. P. Mitchell at
the Bohemian Club in San Francisco, tonight.
According to the invitations issued, the purpose of the meeting is to
promote good will between the two bodies. Dr. Williams, president of the
Stanford board, and Professor Mitchell, secretary-treasurer, have not
only included members of the two boards in the invitation, but also, Presi
dent Wilbur of Stanford and President Campbell of the University of
California, in addition to prominent students.
The entire idea seems a most commendable one. Several years ago,
the two bodies met in joint session and the results were highly satisfactory.
At that time, the topic of discussion was the expansion plan of the two
universities.
Now that both stadiums are completed, tonight's meeting should be in
the nature of a "mutual admiration party."
There is much to be gained from perfect understanding between two
groups of men whose interests are so nearly identical. It is a matter of im
portance to both institutions that athletic relations be continued on a sound
basis. Certainly, personal contact between the men who represent Stan
ford and California in such important capacities should result in co-opera
tion which will prove of benefit to both.
