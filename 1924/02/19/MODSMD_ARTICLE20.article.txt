# Swimming

Tonight, in the Olympic Club taok in San Francisco, Coach Ernst
Brandsten's varsity and freshman swimmers will compete with teams
from the University of California.
Swimming at Stanford has never aroused the interest nor has it ever
received the support which it merits. Brandsten's teams have met with
almost uniform success in the past few years. Few people realize just
how much Cardinal swimmers and divers have done to put Stanford on
the map all over the world.
Perhaps it is too much to expect that a large crowd of rooters will ac
company the team to San Francisco tonight, as it is hard to attract many
students to any athletic event in the middle of the week.
However, there will be other opportunities for Stanford people to see
the swimming teams in action this year. The cramped quarters, and in
adequate pool are serious handicaps to the work of "Ernie's" teams. Im
provements are already being planned, but they would no doubt be made a
reality much sooner if the swimmers were given more support by the
students.

Owing to a rearrangement which makes an earlier press time possible,
all viewpoints and announcements must be in the Daily Palo Alto office
by ten o'clock of the day on which they arc to be printed.

Results of the California-U. S. C. games tonight and tomorrow night
may be obtained by calling the Daily Palo Alto Office, Palo Alto 1074, any
time after 9:45.
