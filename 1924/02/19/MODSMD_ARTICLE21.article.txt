## A 						FLY'S-EYE VIEW. 
### 
Dear reader, tell me, have you ever
been up in an aeroplane? You haven't?
Well, you haven't missed much. You
can see just about as much in any
first-class stable yard, because when
one is up in an aeroplane everything
looks like a fly.
It's true, alright. Every account I
ever read of anyone who had just taken
a trip in an aeroplane, always described
everything below them as looking like
a fly. Now that seemed very singular
to me, because try as I could, I couldn't
see why everything couldn't look just
as well like a mosquito, or a bed-bug
maybe, or even a flea.
These newspaper articles that had
everything looking like a fly made me
sore, and so I determined to make a
flight myself to find out once and for
all, the truth of the matter. 1 viewed
my trip as a sort of super-voyage of
scientific discovery, and myself as a
real public benefactor.
"The public has been bamboozled
long enough on this fly proposition," I
told a reporter as I climbed into my
plane, "and I'm off to prove it." And
as the reporter gave me three rousing
cheers, my machine rose into the air
with a roar.
In accordance with a plan I had in
mind, 1 immediately sought out: one
particular object so that I could note
any changes that might take place as
we rose higher and higher into the air.
1 decided on a large white house which
stood well out in the open, and began
to watch it intently. To my utter
amazement and consternation, the thing
began to undergo a series of very per
ceptible changes as we mounted into
the sky.
Long, hairy legs sprouted out from
the sides; the front gables of the struc
ture were replaced by two enormous
and protruding eyes; transparent wings
soon made their appearance, and finally,
with a few more characteristic touches,
I realized tbac the thing looked exactly
like a fly. Moreover, it was undeniably
a special kind of fly. It was a house fly.
My faith shaken, I removed my at
tention from what had been the house,
and glanced over the side of my plane
to where I knew the Susquehanna river
flowed into the sea. Surely it wouldn't
look like a fly, I thought. But no,
there it was. The fool thing looked
exactly like a fly. It looked like a wet
fly, to be sure—sort of watery in the
eyes, like a fly with a bad cold, but un
mistakably, it did look like a fly.
Next we flew out over the ocean.
Here I felt more secure. Here, I
thought, there would be no flies, because
I knew flies couldn't swim and I didn't
think they liked the water anyway.
But far below me I observed something
on the water. If I had been down
there, I feel positive that it would have
been a boat, maybe a big ocean liner,
but now that I was up in this con
founded aeroplane, the darned thing
looked exactly like a fly. It was pad
dling around down there having a fine
time.
Circling back from the sea, we flew
over the city of New York. It too,
looked like a fly. Disgusted, I ordered
my pilot to fly over to the Chicago
stock yards, where I knew that a very
large shipment of horses had just ar
rived. On the way over, we ran
through a flock of what should have
been birds. They might have been, but
they looked like flies.
I was almost ready to give up, but I
still clung hopefully to my horses.
Maybe they would be normal. If they
weren't, I was going to call it off. The
thing was getting on my nerves. I was
getting hungry for the sight of a de
cent, self-respecting mosquito or even
a wood-tick. These cursed flies had
this aeroplane proposition cinched.
Finally we reached Chicago, and
soon we were circling over the stock
yards. Eagerly, I leaned over the side,
and looked for my horses. Yes, there
they were, confound them! They
looked exactly like horse-flies—a whole
herd of 'em.
That beat me. I ordered the pilot to
take me home. The papers are right,
and I'll have to admit that when one
is up in an aeroplane, everything looks
like a fly. I'm wondering now, if one
were down in a submarine, if every
thing would look like a fish.

yards. Eagerly, I leaned over the side,
and looked for my horses. Yes, there
they were, confound them! They
looked exactly like horse-flies—a whole
herd of 'em.
That beat me. I ordered the pilot to
take me home. The papers are right,
and I'll have to admit that when one
is up in an aeroplane, everything looks
like a fly. I'm wondering now, if one
were down in a submarine, if every
thing would look like a fish.

Dear reader, tell me, have you ever
been up in an aeroplane? You haven't?
Well, you haven't missed much. You
can see just about as much in any
first-class stable yard, because when
one is up in an aeroplane everything
looks like a fly.
It's true, alright. Every account I
ever read of anyone who had just taken
a trip in an aeroplane, always described
everything below them as looking like
a fly. Now that seemed very singular
to me, because try as I could, I couldn't
see why everything couldn't look just
as well like a mosquito, or a bed-bug
maybe, or even a flea.
These newspaper articles that had
everything looking like a fly made me
sore, and so I determined to make a
flight myself to find out once and for
all, the truth of the matter. 1 viewed
my trip as a sort of super-voyage of
scientific discovery, and myself as a
real public benefactor.
"The public has been bamboozled
long enough on this fly proposition," I
told a reporter as I climbed into my
plane, "and I'm off to prove it." And
as the reporter gave me three rousing
cheers, my machine rose into the air
with a roar.
In accordance with a plan I had in
mind, 1 immediately sought out: one
particular object so that I could note
any changes that might take place as
we rose higher and higher into the air.
1 decided on a large white house which
stood well out in the open, and began
to watch it intently. To my utter
amazement and consternation, the thing
began to undergo a series of very per
ceptible changes as we mounted into
the sky.
Long, hairy legs sprouted out from
the sides; the front gables of the struc
ture were replaced by two enormous
and protruding eyes; transparent wings
soon made their appearance, and finally,
with a few more characteristic touches,
I realized tbac the thing looked exactly
like a fly. Moreover, it was undeniably
a special kind of fly. It was a house fly.
My faith shaken, I removed my at
tention from what had been the house,
and glanced over the side of my plane
to where I knew the Susquehanna river
flowed into the sea. Surely it wouldn't
look like a fly, I thought. But no,
there it was. The fool thing looked
exactly like a fly. It looked like a wet
fly, to be sure—sort of watery in the
eyes, like a fly with a bad cold, but un
mistakably, it did look like a fly.
Next we flew out over the ocean.
Here I felt more secure. Here, I
thought, there would be no flies, because
I knew flies couldn't swim and I didn't
think they liked the water anyway.
But far below me I observed something
on the water. If I had been down
there, I feel positive that it would have
been a boat, maybe a big ocean liner,
but now that I was up in this con
founded aeroplane, the darned thing
looked exactly like a fly. It was pad
dling around down there having a fine
time.
Circling back from the sea, we flew
over the city of New York. It too,
looked like a fly. Disgusted, I ordered
my pilot to fly over to the Chicago
stock yards, where I knew that a very
large shipment of horses had just ar
rived. On the way over, we ran
through a flock of what should have
been birds. They might have been, but
they looked like flies.
I was almost ready to give up, but I
still clung hopefully to my horses.
Maybe they would be normal. If they
weren't, I was going to call it off. The
thing was getting on my nerves. I was
getting hungry for the sight of a de
cent, self-respecting mosquito or even
a wood-tick. These cursed flies had
this aeroplane proposition cinched.

large shipment of horses had just ar
rived. On the way over, we ran
through a flock of what should have
been birds. They might have been, but
they looked like flies.
I was almost ready to give up, but I
still clung hopefully to my horses.
Maybe they would be normal. If they
weren't, I was going to call it off. The
thing was getting on my nerves. I was
getting hungry for the sight of a de
cent, self-respecting mosquito or even
a wood-tick. These cursed flies had
this aeroplane proposition cinched.
Finally we reached Chicago, and
soon we were circling over the stock
yards. Eagerly, I leaned over the side,
and looked for my horses. Yes, there
they were, confound them! They
looked exactly like horse-flies—a whole
herd of 'em.
That beat me. I ordered the pilot to
take me home. The papers are right,
and I'll have to admit that when one
is up in an aeroplane, everything looks
like a fly. I'm wondering now, if one
were down in a submarine, if every
thing would look like a fish.

Dear reader, tell me, have you ever
been up in an aeroplane? You haven't?
Well, you haven't missed much. You
can see just about as much in any
first-class stable yard, because when
one is up in an aeroplane everything
looks like a fly.
It's true, alright. Every account I
ever read of anyone who had just taken
a trip in an aeroplane, always described
everything below them as looking like
a fly. Now that seemed very singular
to me, because try as I could, I couldn't
see why everything couldn't look just
as well like a mosquito, or a bed-bug
maybe, or even a flea.
These newspaper articles that had
everything looking like a fly made me
sore, and so I determined to make a
flight myself to find out once and for
all, the truth of the matter. 1 viewed
my trip as a sort of super-voyage of
scientific discovery, and myself as a
real public benefactor.
"The public has been bamboozled
long enough on this fly proposition," I
told a reporter as I climbed into my
plane, "and I'm off to prove it." And
as the reporter gave me three rousing
cheers, my machine rose into the air
with a roar.
In accordance with a plan I had in
mind, 1 immediately sought out: one
particular object so that I could note
any changes that might take place as
we rose higher and higher into the air.
1 decided on a large white house which
stood well out in the open, and began
to watch it intently. To my utter
amazement and consternation, the thing
began to undergo a series of very per
ceptible changes as we mounted into
the sky.
Long, hairy legs sprouted out from
the sides; the front gables of the struc
ture were replaced by two enormous
and protruding eyes; transparent wings
soon made their appearance, and finally,
with a few more characteristic touches,
I realized tbac the thing looked exactly
like a fly. Moreover, it was undeniably
a special kind of fly. It was a house fly.
My faith shaken, I removed my at
tention from what had been the house,
and glanced over the side of my plane
to where I knew the Susquehanna river
flowed into the sea. Surely it wouldn't
look like a fly, I thought. But no,
there it was. The fool thing looked
exactly like a fly. It looked like a wet
fly, to be sure—sort of watery in the
eyes, like a fly with a bad cold, but un
mistakably, it did look like a fly.
Next we flew out over the ocean.
Here I felt more secure. Here, I
thought, there would be no flies, because
I knew flies couldn't swim and I didn't
think they liked the water anyway.
But far below me I observed something
on the water. If I had been down
there, I feel positive that it would have
been a boat, maybe a big ocean liner,
but now that I was up in this con
founded aeroplane, the darned thing
looked exactly like a fly. It was pad
dling around down there having a fine
time.
Circling back from the sea, we flew
over the city of New York. It too,
looked like a fly. Disgusted, I ordered
my pilot to fly over to the Chicago
stock yards, where I knew that a very
large shipment of horses had just ar
rived. On the way over, we ran
through a flock of what should have
been birds. They might have been, but
they looked like flies.
