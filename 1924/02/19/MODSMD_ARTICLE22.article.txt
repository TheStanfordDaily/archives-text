# BUSY! BUSY! BUSY!

Daily Kansan
Is the pace of life really becoming
swifter, the world whirling more madly,
or are students getting so used to the
idea that they are "too busy" that such
an excuse comes naturally in reply to a
call for service?
If the seemingly mad scramble of ex
istence, such as most students would
have you believe they are living, is a
means used by nature to determine the
survival of the fittest, then the coming
years will see students as whirling der
vishes in an effort to keep up the pace.
But if nature is not to blame and
such a situation is unnatural, then it is
time for those students who honestly
have tackled too much to bump up
against a calm wall of sane living.
Probably the majority of students are
"too busy" just because it seems to be
the style. The psychology of the mob
seems to be affecting them. One person
feels he is overworked, and the feeling
becomes contagious.
Of course, everyone is busy, but he
should be glad that he isn't suffering
from boredom—a worse ailment than too
much work. There is nothing more
truthful than the old saying: "The
more you do, the more you can do."
