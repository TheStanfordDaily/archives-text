# DELTA TAU DELTA, BETA THETA PI WIN SEMI-FINAL GAMES
## 
### 
Delta Tau Delta and Beta Tlieta Pi
will be the teams to mix for the intra
mural basketball championship, as a
result of yesterday's games.
Delta Tau Delta swamped the Japa
nese Club, 22-5. Beta Theta Pi downed
Phi Delta Theta, 10-3.
The Betas' more accurate shooting
was too much for the Phi Delts, who
made but one field goal to their op
ponents' four. Smith, with two free
throws for the Betas, was the only
man to score from behind the foul
line.
Teams Show Fight
Both teams started out fighting
hard. The passing and dribbling was
poor, however, and neither team
scored for several minutes. Then
Smith dropped one in for the Betas.
The Phi Delts had several chances,
but missed them. After much loose
playing on both sides, Tibbe of the
Betas caged another field goal. Play
ter converted a free throw for the Phi
Delts, and the half ended 4-1 for the
Betas.
The second period was tenser than
the first. The Phi Delts were robbed
of several baskets, and then Fletcher
sank their first field goal of the game.
For the Betas, Alabaster and Smith
found the hoop, and Smith caged two
free tries. Although few fouls were
called, the game was rough, and the
ball changed hands frequently. Ala
baster and Smith were the outstand
ing men for the Betas.
Delta Tau Wins Easily
Delta Tau Delta had little trouble
disposing of the Japanese Club. Hav
ing the great advantage of superior
height and weight, and using better
teamwork, they were never threat
ened.
The Japanese Club did not score a
single field goal. Its five tallies were
on free throws. The Clubmen could not
penetrate the Delta Tau defense, and
had to content themselves with long
shots at the basket. Some of these,
however, missed narrowly.
Delta Tau took the offensive from
the start. Morrison chalked up their
first tally after a few minutes of play.
Then the Delta Tau scoring machine
got under way, and the half ended
13-3 in their favor.
Club-Men Come Back Strong
In the second half the Japanese
Club came back with a strong offen
sive, but failed to score. The Delta
Taus continued to find the cage, and
the final tally was 22-5 in their favor.
Beta Theta Pi and Delta Tau Delta
meet Wednesday, February 27, in the
pavilion, to decide the championship.
Judging from yesterday's games, a
fast, close contest should take place.

Gil Dobie, football coach at Cornell,
will again teacli in the summer session
coaching school at the University of
Illinois. Last summer he and Coach
Rupert C. Zuppke of Illinois instructed
a class of more than 250 college and
high school coaches in their respective
styles of play.
