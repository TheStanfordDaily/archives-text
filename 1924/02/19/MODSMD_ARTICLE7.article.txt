# STANFORD SWIMMERS MEET BRUINS TONIGHT
## Brandsten Expects Cards to Make 8 New Varsity, Freshman Records 
### 
CTANFORD and California varsity and freshman swimming teams will meet
tonight in the Olympic Club tank in San Francisco at 8:15. Although the
Cardinals have a decided edge in both meets the events will be followed
closely because of the possibility of star performances by Stanford men who
loom as Olympic Games material.
Wallace O'Connor, Stanford entree in the 50-yard free style, the' 100-yard
free style, and the relay events, is expected to win easily, although he meets
Mitchell, the best man on the California squad. Last month O'Connor came
within 17 seconds of the world's record time for 1500 meters, swimming
without competition.
Five Varsity Records May Go
Coach Ernie Brandsten expects the varsity to make five new Stanford-
California records tonight. O'Connor should break th<e existing record for
100 yards, and Allen may do the same in the 220-yard event. DeGroot and

Fletcher in the 100-yard back-stroke<j
and breast-stroke respectively are po
tential record-breakers.
O'Connor, Allen, Carlsmith, and ,
Hirschman have a good chance of
swimming the relay in better than 7
flat.
The freshman team, which took the
Olympic Club Juniors to defeat by a j
score of 52 to 16, is the strongest Stan- I
ford has ever had. They will probably
be seriously handicapped tonight, how
ever, by the possible inability of both
Williams and Brooks to participate, j
both of whom have been on the sick
list for several days.
Doerr is expected to set a new
Stanford-California freshman record
in the 50-yard free style, and Hanlay
may do the same in the breast-stroke.
