## 
### 
Stanford freshman debaters will
j meet first-year teams from California
; and the College of Pacific in a tri
j angular debate early in April on tlid
I subject of the recognition of Soviet
j Russia.
No definite teams have been select
j ed as yet. Eight men are working hard
! on the question under the coaching of
j Bert Levit, varsity debater. From this
; group two three-man teams will be
picked. The affirmative will meet the
California negative here, while the
negative will try for the decision over
the College of Pacific affirmative at
j San Jose.
As this will be the first debate for
the freshmen their exact powers can
not be determined. According to Levit,
who coached the freshman team
which was victorious in both sides of
! the dual debate with California last
| year, the first-year men show promise.
Robert Bruce, Ted Baer, Craven
j Scott. Harold Peterson, John Leiter,
| Robert Fraser, and Lloyd Sullivan
! compose the group from which the
j teams will be selected.
