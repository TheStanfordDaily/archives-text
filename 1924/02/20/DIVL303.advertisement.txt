My First Big Picture xrfL*
and I want you all to come and see me.
It's the most thrilling story you've ever
seen, lots of big moments, suspense
and heart-trrobs. Some of the greatest actors in pictures, including
Sheldon Lewis, Gladys Brockwell, Max Davidson, Carl Stockdale, Min
nie Steele, Frank Currier and others, are also in it with me. Please be
sure to come and see how you like me in a real big picture.
