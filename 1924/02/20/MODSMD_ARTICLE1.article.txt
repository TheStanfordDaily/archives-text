# U. C. WINS FROM TROJANS 25-16; LEADS P. C. C.
## Victory Gives Bears Edge Over Stanford Varsity In Cage Race 
### 
As a result of California's 25 to 16
-victory over the ,University of South
erÂ® California quintet in the south
yester(U(y, the Bruin five is leading
the race for the honors of the south
ern half of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence Basketball league.
The Bears have a record of three
games .won, and two defeats. Stanford
comes a close second with three won,
and three lost, while U. S. C. now
trails the conference with de
feats and three wins.
Conference Race Threatened
Should the Bears win the remaining
game on the schedule from the Tro
jans tonight, they will hold an envi
able position in the conference race.
If the Trojans defeat the Bruins an
other triple tie will result, with the
Trojans carrying the bulk of the
games played.
In any case the triumph of the Blue
and Gold last night places the Stan
ford-California game next Saturday
in the limelight of all-importance.
Whether California wins or loses to
morrow night, it, will still have the
advantage over the Trojans in the
number of games played, and the next
two contests between Berkeley and
Stanford will determine somewhat
which team will represent the south
ern half against the northern cham
pions.
Trojans' Hope Is Tie
The best the Trojans can hope for
is a victory over the Bruin quintet
tonight, and a triple tie in the race.
With all the teams tied, U. S. C. can
only sit back and hope for a split in
the remaining Card-Bear games.
Andy Kerr is well satisfied with the
showing of his quintet against the
Bears lust Saturday. And so are the
supporters of the varsity at large.
Stanford has exhibited better basket
ball knowledge than the Bears in the
last two games played, and the close
scores only serve to show that the
Card five is able to hold its own with
the disadvantages of a crippled team
against it.
Dave Oliva will remove the cast
from his knee today. If the stiffness is
all worn off before the game, he might

:be used in the Stanford line-up. An
; injured knee is an injured knee, how
j ever, and it only takes the slightest
bump to dislocate it, and if the Bear
five is playing anywhere up to stand
ard game it will find the easiest way
to bring about a fresh hurt without
difficulty.
