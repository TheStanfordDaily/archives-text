# SENSATIONAL NEWS IS ON WANE. SAYS ABBOT

### Aileen Hicks 
"It is possible for a newspaper to
make a success without being sensa
tional," declared Willis J. Abbot, edi
tor and publisher of the Christian
Science Monitor, in his talk yesterday
afternoou under the auspices of the
American Journalists Association.
In support of this contention he
gave as examples of clean journalism
the New York Times, Boston Trans
cript, and New York Evening Post,
which have an enormous circulation
although they do not deal in sensa
tionalism.
Discussing the Christian Science
Monitor, Abbot explained his policy of
keeping all harmful news of disasters
and crimes out of the paper. In such
a case as the Teapot Dome scandal he
merely used the Associated Press re
port without editorial comment. This
avoids the general hysteria which is
COmtnuhicated through the press, and
so i-aises the real news value of the
pap6r.
Abbot Outlined the Monitor Peace
Plan based on the main proposal that
everybody should be made to pay for
war, rich and poor alike. The nation
should conscript the labor of all peo
ple just as they conscript soldiers.
This even division of the work be
tween capital and labor would pre
vent war profiteering, and in the end
Â«
take away the incentive for war, the
burden of which has always fallen on
the poor and weak.
This plan was launched in the Moni
tor after all Bok Peace Plan possibili
ties had been turned in, and has been
recognized in Congress to the extent
that it has been drafted in the form
of an amendment to the constitution.
Abbot stressed the fact that the
Monitor was an international news
paper which rescognize no territory
as being outside its field. This is
proof, he believes, that sensationalism
isn't necessary to success.
