# BABES PREPARE TO HAND CUBS SECOND DEFEAT
## Stanford Freshmen Have Not Downed Blue and Gold Twice Since 1917 
### 
California and Stanford freshman
quintetw will clash tonight in the sec
ond game of the Little-Big basketball
series at 8 o'clock in the pavilion.
The freshmen have already defeated
the Cubs in the first game of the
series. Tonight they will try to accom
plish something which has not been
done since 1917, to defeat the Blue
and Gold hoopsters twice in one sea
son. The freshmen of the class of *20
succeeded in trouncing the Bears
twice, the scores being 34 to 2G and
19 to 18.
Improve Defensive
Coach Husky" Hunt has been cor
recting the !illilts displayed by the
freshmen against California since last
Wednesday and the Babes will un
dou^te^> r preaO/il 2 smoother offen
sive tonight. Hunt is Making
CflfUft the game and has an
nounced thai will be 00 manipu
lations in the fi'eshman linel<i> solely
.to allow more men tcÂ» make their' tiu-"
merals. Substitutions will be made
from necessity only.
Nelson David led in scoring last
Wednesday, accounting for seven field
goals. He will probably be so closely
followed tonight, however, that he will
have scarcely a shot from the floor.
If tiie Blue and Gold players con
centrate on David, Captain Fred Price
and "Wally" Jayred will probably do
most of the scoring. Price has been
high point man in a number oi' the
games and is good at sinking shots
when closely guarded.
Jayred has a habit of scoring once
or twice in a game from under the
hoop on follow-up shots and his height
gives him an advantage in evading
the ordinary guard.
Ted Shipkey has been holding down
the running guard position in a steady
fashion all season. He seldom scores,
but has made most of the victories
possible by his defensive play.
Newhouse Is Guard
"Moco" Newhouse will take care of
the rear guard position. He passes
equally well with either hand, is a
wonder at getting the ball out of dan
ger, and has been characterized as
the most adroit member of the squad.
Southworth at forward and Clark
at guard are the best of the substi
tutes. These men have rapidly come
to the front during the last week and
will probably see service tonight. Ned
Anderson will alternate with Jayred
at center.
