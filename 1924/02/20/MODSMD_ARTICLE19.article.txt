It would seem that if there is hope for a movement toward better
thing's, it should be in a university, where men and women who do not
have to work for a living have time in which to play and think.
Yet the apparent hopelessness of that idea is clearly expressed by one
phase of college life—the violation of the prohibition law.
That there are students who drink is a fact known to everyone. This
does not necessarily mean that there is drinking on the campus, for
local regulations can be enforced when the national law fails. Nor does
the remark as to drinking refer to Stanford more than any other
university. But student drinking, like drinking among the rich, is a
matter of common knowledge and causes no undue comment. •
In violating the law, the university students are merely following the
example set by a great body of respectable and influential American
citizens. Perhaps that is the reason why none of us ever dream of
asking our fellow-students if they don't believe breaking the law is a
rather poor thing to do. Imagine the reaction if you, who are reading
this, were to ask one of your friends who drinks, say, only occasionally,
"Don't you think it's expedient, even on principle alone, to violate
the prohibition law?"
"The law? Why should I worry about the law? Don't talk to me
about the law! Look what everybody gets by with ! The law doesn't
mean anything."
" the law doesn't mean anything!"
Surely an opinion destructive enough, on its face, to make anybody
think for at least thirty seconds. We shun a counterfeiter but many of
us welcome a bootlegger.
Well, what about it? The reaction is evidently not coming from
those who have charge of the world right now. When is the step forward
to start?
In universities? What an absurd thought!—the students of the
universities upholding the prohibition law!
Yet, we as students, like to think of ourselves as being slightly more
educated and cultured than the masses. In view of the facts, can we
escape the charge of provincial narrowness? Stanford students as
supine followers instead of leaders—it is worth thinking over.
