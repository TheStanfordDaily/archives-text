### Helen Nelson 
"Figureheads", the one act play
given by Miss Elizabeth Buckingham's
dramatic interpretation class at Mrs.
Wilbur's at home yesterday, proved
a delightful bit ot' whimsy. Charm
was significant in each of the charac
ter interpretations.
Marjorie Allen, as the vain and tem
ruental Princess Felicia of Ponderay,
was convincing in her ultimate deci
sion that it was better to be a beauti
ful figurehead in love than a leader
of conqueoring peoples.
Marjorie Bailie, as the masculine
Prince of Domdometer decided with
quite feminine intuition that life with
the lovely princess was to be pre
ferred to a life "without such encum
brances."
Janet Wallace was excellent as the
nervous over-conscientious maid,
while Natali eßaymond and Barbara
Probasco were quite dashing as guards
of the court. Gladys McLeod in the
prologue showed remarkable control
of voice and musical interpretation.
Musicians: Elizabeth Pierce, Miriam
Ebright, and Helen Ames contributed
a tuneful atmosphere to the playlet.
