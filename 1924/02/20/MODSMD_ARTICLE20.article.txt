"NOW THAT" the announcement of the temporary marriage of
Chappie and the Columbia Jester has appeared in the society columns of
the Daily Palo Alto, it is high time to offer the Old Boy a congratulatory
hand.
The full page advertisement o£ the occasion which appears in the last
issue of the Jester shows that Chappie's mate-to-be is very proud of the
occasion. The Daily Palo Alto does not blame the Columbia comic for
being proud. Stanford is mighty well satisfied with the efforts of the
Chaparral, too.
Chappie, too, is to be commended for its judicious choice of a mate.
Jester is a credit to the ranks of college comics. Such a combined issue
as will appear on the campus Thursday, can only be made possible by a
great deal of hard work.
The campus looks forward to the great occasion.
