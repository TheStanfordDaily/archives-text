Congratulations to the Clubhouse Board of Directors and all others
who have helped to make it possible for the Women's Clubhouse to
celebrate its ninth birthday.
The clubhouse plays a very important part in student life on the
campus. The reduction of the large debt which originally hung over it
reflects a great deal of credit upon those who have given so generously.
Every student joins cordially in the wish, "Many happy returns of
the day."
