# A 						Word for the Ruf.
## 
### 
Why O fellow citizens, cattle thieves.
And debtors, should the immortal ruf j
Be forced to relinquish or otherwise J
Give up his chair to ladies present at a j
Club House Brawl? Were not the i
rufs made holey in the first days of'
Creation? Are they not the largest)
Patch on the earth? Arc they not
Sons of the soiled? Why, forsake, j
Should they not smack their lips j
to the tune of Dramatic kisses?
Their day will come for like Saint j
Patrick in Ireland the rough is I
in to exterminate the loathsome j
snake. â€”D. M. I
