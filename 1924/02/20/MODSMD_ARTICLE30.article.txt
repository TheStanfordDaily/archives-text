# WOULD CUT OFF EARS FOR STEALING OWN COW
## 
### 
A curious instance of the need of
keeping legislation up-to-date is seen
in a recent case in Winnipeg, where
a man was convicted of taking one
of his own cows from the pound,
where it had been placed after it
was found straying at large.
On looking up the law for punish
ing such a crime, it was found that
no penalty was provided in the sta
tutes, so English Common Law was
invoked. This offered two alterna
tives: death; or cutting off both ears
and deporting the criminal to the
penal colony in Australia.
