"THIS is my building," said Mrs. Stanford in speaking of the Stanford
museum. The idea of the museum was first conceived by Leland Stanford
Junior and it was the aim of his mother to carry out his plans for its
establishment. The collections in the building represent years of research
on the part of both Senator and Mrs. Stanford.

Leland Collects in Europe
In 1880 Leland Stanford Junior be
ing eleven years old, accompanied his
parents to Europe. During their trav
els through Great Britain and Central
and Southern Europe, young Leland
conceived the idea of bringing away
from each place some object of local
or general interest. At first this idea
was only to perpetuate in his memory
the pleasures of the trip, but gradually
the scope of his plans broadened and
he decided to furnish a play room at
home with his treasurers. He carefully
catalogued and arranged his purchases
and when, in 1883, the family made a
second trip abroad, his parents as
sisted him in his archaeological re
searches and collecting. In 1884 Le
land died in Florence, Italy, from Ro
man fever, and his mother took up
the work which he had begun.
Museum Begun in 1891
In 1891 the present museum was
started, but it was not completed un
til 1906. The structure is of the Gre
cain type of architecture and was the
first reinforced concrete building in
the West. The museum withstood well
the earthquake of 1906, the two wings
of ordinary brick being the only parts
destroyed by the quake. During the
earthquake a valuable collection was
in Mrs. Stanford's home in San Fran
cisco. This was moved out during the
first of the fire and when all danger
seemed past was returned to the build
ing. According to stories of the big
fire, the wind changed and the flames,
sweeping back, burned the Stanford
home and at the same time destroyed
the valuable collection.
Has Valuable Collections
The Stanroru museum boasts one
of the finest Egyptology collections
west of the Metropolitan Museum. The
Cyprian collection excavated on the
Isle a .of Cyprus contains valuable con
necting links in the history of man
kind. Several oriental collections, one
of which was given to Stanford by Mr.
and Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, constitute
a valuable of the museum's con
tents.
A series of excellent paintings rep
resenting masterpieces by famous art
ists line the upper walls of the gallery
in the entrance to the building. Three
new collections, the American or early
colonial, the California and the textile
collections, are now being completed.
Articles of local interest are also to
be found in the museum. One case con
tains pictures from which the first
movies were made, the movie inven
tion originating at Stanford. Many
other collections of value and interest
are gathered in the building.
