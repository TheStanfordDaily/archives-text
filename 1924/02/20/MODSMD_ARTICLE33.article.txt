# FIRE DEPARTMENT REDUCES RATE OF CAMPUS INSURANCE
## Residents Given 20 Per Cent Cut, Result of Improved Fire Protection 
### 
A 20 per cent reduction in insurance
rates has been received by campus
residents since the organization and
improvement of the Stanford fire de
partment, according to a letter issued
today by University Accountant E. S.
Erwin for the Comptroller's office.
Two six-man shifts of trained fire
men furnish fire protection for the
University day and night. In addition
to these two regular shifts six en
listed men of the R. O. T. C. are paid
members of the fire department and
are subject to call for duty through
out the 24 hours.
Fire Marshal Robert Dugan, former
ly a member of the San Francisco fire
department, and Assistant Fire Mar
shal Fred Frehe are in command of
all firemen. Up to two years ago a
volunteer department did all the cam
pus fire fighting. It was handicapped
by lack of adequate equipment and of
trained firemen, although it ranked
high among departments of its class.
The present fire department is main
tained by the University, and its
$35,000 worth of up-to-date apparatus
makes it one of the best-equipped of
its size in the state. Three sources of
water supply are available, including
the Searsville system, the domestic
supply, and the Felt Lake reservoir,
in an emergency all three systems can
be thrown together for immediate use.
A fireman is detailed to safeguard
the Assembly hall whenever it is in
use for shows or lectures. It is his
duty to keep all the exits open. Hose
reels and fire lines are installed in
all University buildings and dormi
tories. .
In order to defray the overhead ex
penses of the department a gasoline
filling station has been established by
the University next to the fire house,
where campus residents may purchase
gasoline, oils, and greases at reduced
prices.
The greatest fire hazard, according
to Fire Marshal Dugan, is the accumu
lation of rubbish in the buildings. He
asks general co-operation in eliminat
ing this danger as far as possible, and
warns that failure to comply with
this regulation will Ire sufficient
ground for the cancellation of leases.
