# TRIO PLEASES WITH INTERPRETATION OF CONCERT NUMBERS
## Philharmonic Group Displays Skill and Experience In Chamber Music

Delicacy rather than force was the
outstanding feature of last evening's
recital by the Philharmonic Trio in
the Assembly hall.
There was little solo work in the
numbers. Miss Lois Adler, pianist,
Orley See, violinist, and Wenceslao
Villalpando, cellist, played so well in
trio, that the work of no one artist
was outstanding.
Dvorak's Trio "Dumky," Op. 90, was
deftly played, bringing out unexpected
changes in melody, and emphasizing
the unity of feeling which was the
only relating tie of the different parts.
Change of mood from the dignified
measures of a peculiarly "Dumka"
phrase to a joyful tune made this num
ber delightful.
The "Dumka," a Bohemian musical
form, was introduced to concert music
by Dvorak, and was used by him for
slow, melancholy movements.
The musicians phrased this selec
tion well, and brought out the varia
tions between the lively, stirring
dance-like tunes to the funereal, ele
giac parts.
From time to time, suggestions of
folk tunes were caught in the con
stantly-changing sections, which wa
vered between dignity at one extreme,
and light-hearted harmony, with un
usual repetitions of theme at the
other.
Smooth technique and pleasing tones
were evident in an intelligent render
ing of the Beethoven composition. The
trio presented the Menuetto movement
with more warmth than they displayed
in any of the harmony and theme
variations of the first two movements
of the number.
