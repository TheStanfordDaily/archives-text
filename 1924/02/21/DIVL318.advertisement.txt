BE READY WHEN
YOUR CHANCE COMES
What value is there in
opportunity if a fellow is
not prepared to handle it
when it does come along?
Opportunities are plen
tiful, especially to the
man who has some ready
cash tucked away in an
interest-bearing account.
It is quite worth while
to prepare for good
things by regularly sav
ing part of the income
than it is to waste any
time hunting for them.
Your term deposit will
attract many splendid
opportunities.
We will be pleased to
take good care of your
spare funds.
