# CALIFORNIA CATCHES BABES ON OFF-NIGHT AND WINS, 14 TO 9
## Freshman Basketball Team Plays Ragged Game; Defeat Is First Of Year For 1927 Quintet 
### Wallace Knox 
£ALIFORNIA caught the Stanford freshman on an off night and handed them
a 14 to 9 defeat in the most ragged exhibition of basketball that has been
seen in the pavilion this year.
Over-confidence was probably a factor in the downfall of the Babes after
fourteen consecutive victories. The Stanford quintet got the lead at the start
and was on top of a 4 to 1 score after ten minutes of play. Robie then sank
two of his mid-floor bankless shots and put the California team ahead. The
fight of the Blue and Gold players, coupled with their one-point lead at this
time, seemed to surprise the Babes to such an extent that they forgot their
teamwork completely.
California Has Edge
From this point on, California had a decided advantage. The Cubs handled
the ball well in defensive territory and easily broke up the passing of the
Stanford five.
The Babes were unable to penetrate the Cub defense with their passing
game. Then they resorted to long shots. However, the freshmen failed
almost completely to follow the shots, and as a result the Bears got the ball
off the Stanford backboard every time. Jayred got down a few of them,
but his follow shots were hurried by<S> —

the Cub guards and all went wild.
Fouling was frequent on both sides.
Each member of the yearling squad
had chances to score from the foul
line but all of them missed. California
accumulated four points by the foul
try route. Williams, who went in for
Jayred in the second half, managed to
cage one foul try towards the end of
the game.
Both Teams Ragged
While the Babes were ragged, the
Talifornia five was not.much better.
They had shots enough to win several
basketball games, but managed to get
only five of them. Had the Babes been
playing up to their usual form they
would have had little trouble in win
ning the game. The first half ended
with the California team ahead, 7 to 4.
Unlucky on Shots
In the second half things went from
bad to worse. Fate frowned on the
Cards and shots that were usually
easy for them hit the inside of the
