U. S. C.'s victory over California last night leaves Cardinals, Bears,
and Trojans tied with a percentage of .500 in the southern division of the
Pacific Coast Conference.
Saturday night, in the pavilion, Stanford and California meet. When
that game is over, the deadlock will he broken and the team which will
battle the northern invader for the coast title will he fairly definitely picked.
Andy Kerr and his Cardinal basketball team have fought an uphill
battle all season. Developing rapidly from the ranks of the unknown to
the position of a dangerous contender for the title, the Stanford quintet
has come through in great shape. "Little Andy" is largely responsible for
the showing the team has made.
Stanford has an excellent chance to win Saturday night. The team,
having enjoyed a week of much-needed rest, is in fine shape and is primed
for the battle of the season.
Probably not more than half of that game will he fought on the pa
vilion floor. The other half will depend on the rooters, three thousand in
number, who will be crammed into the bleachers.
There has been no opportunity for a rally this week, because of the
holiday tomorrow. From the way the tickets have been selling, however,
it is evident that no rally will be needed. Today, several hundred students,
who were unable to buy scats Tuesday, purchased standing room.
Saturday night, the pavilion will lie a bedlam of wild cheering when
the rival teams trot out on to the floor. Stanford rooters will be there to
do their share.
When support has been the deciding factor, in past athletic contests
between Cardinals and Bears, the Stanford rooters have never been found
wanting.
Every Stanford man and woman who is in the pavilion Saturday night
will be behind those five red-jcrseycd men on the floor. It will not be live
men with which the California team will have to contend but two thousand.
Cardinal rooters have always had tlie reputation of being good .sports.
Win, lose, or draw, thev remember that they are ladies ;:nd gentlemen,
and above all, Stanford people. Needless to say, the rooting section Sat
urday night will uphold this most sacred of Stanford traditions.
