# STANFORD, BEARS CLASH SATURDAY
## U. S. a TRIMS BLUE AND GOLD 26 TO 25; VARSITY WILL MIX WITH U. OF C. TO BREAK TIE Bruins Must Win Two Remaining Contests to Eliminate Cards From Southern Half Race 
### David Meiklejohn 
i MNIVERSITY of Southern California's quintet defeated the California varsity,
26 to 25, in the second game of the southern series in Los Angeles last
j night, causing a triple tie in the southern half of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Stanford and California will fight it out to attempt a break in the tie Satur
day night in the pavilion at 8 o'clock. The Bears must defeat Stanford in
both of the remaining games to win the right to represent the South in the
j Pacific Coast Conference elimination.
, The Cards will have an edge over the Bruins when they meet on Saturday.
; The California five has undergone the grind of a southern trip, and two of
the most hotly-contested games on its schedule, but despite these disadvan
; tages, it will make a concentrated effort to keep the red-shirts from winning
I a hold in the percentage column.
Bears Will Fight Hard
No doubt but that the Bears will be fighting every minute of the coming
game. Last Saturday's game should fade out in pale oblivion to the efforts
of both teams to secure the upper hand.
The varsity, after a week's rest, is more than prepared to give the Bruins
a sharp tussle for the title. Andy Kerr, with the majority of Stanford
—— is praying for the return of

Dave Oliva to the line-up.
In case Oliva is still incapable of
playing, Harry Shipkey will doubtless
be used. There is little time for bick
ering as to which man is the better
player. Shipkey has come through in
his playing with ability which no one
supposed he possessed, and his pres
ence in the line-up does by no means
indicate that the team will be hope
lessly weakened.
Those who watched Shipkey play
in the last Bruin contest could not
but admire the way in which the
husky guard tore down the field in at
tempts to block the California of
fensive. Shipkey in practice is improv
ing every day, and Saturday's game
ought to see him in the best possible
shape.
McHose Worries Bruins
"Nip" McHose, the trustworthy, will
be the Bruins' chief lookout. He is
playing the best game of his career
this season. "Come-through" player
that he has proven to be all year, he
should play one of his best offensive
games the day after tomorrow when
every point means an advantage for
Stanford.
Coach Wight of the California var
sity has harked back many times to
the words he uttered about Ray Me-
Burney early in the season. "If Meßur
ney can make the Stanford team,"
Wight was quoted as saying, "then
California will have no trouble in
wiping up the Stanford five." Mcßur
ney HAS made the Stanford team;
moreover he has been one of the main
cogs on the Ca.'d squad, and one of
the reasons why the Bruin offensive
has seemed so inoffensive at times.
The probable line-up for Saturday's
game is:
California — Stanford —
Talt If McHose
Houvenin rf Nevers
Hlggens c Steele
Kincaid rg Mcßurney
Belasco lg Oliva or Shipkey
