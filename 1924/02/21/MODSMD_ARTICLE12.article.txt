### 
With the single idea of proving that
Washington was wrong when he said,

ball clubs will cross bats with the

Stanford diamond stars of former
years, under the name of the North
ern Alumni, will perform in the first
game, tomorrow afternoon; and on
Saturday, the Olympic Club team will
try to wipe out the defeat handed it.
by the varsity in an early season
game.
The most ancient members of the
Alumni team are Newland, Mitchell,
and Wavland. all members of the class
of '21. Newland will hurl against Wol
ter's team and the other two will work
in the outfield.
Peavy, who captained the '23 var
sity, will hold down second base.
Heckendorf, Maillott, and Ratner, all
'22 men. will complete the infield.
On paper the collection of not-so
old-timers looks like a strong aggrega
tion and will furnish a real battle
against the varsity.
Saturday afternoon, the Olympic
Club will perform against the Cards.
In their last contest. Wolter's slug
ging crew fell on the Olympic pitcher
for nine runs in one inning.
To prevent a repetition of this dis
aster, the clubmen have added several
strong semi-pro players to their roster.
Clark, who played at short for Ire
land last Saturday, will be seen in
the same position for the Olympians.
He is one infielder who knows his
business, and, what is more, knows
how to accomplish it. •
Hermle, the lanky first baseman
who always furnishes a few thrills for
the bleachers, will be on hand to work
against Stanford.
In the box for the Olympics, will be
Gene Coruozzi. Gene has had hard
luck in his last two starts against the
Cards, but figures that good luck is
about due now.
Stanford will take the field with the
same line-up as was us«d last week
against Cliff Ireland's club. Oviatt or
Solomon will start in the box, with
Lawson at the receiving end.

The average error in the time signal
sent out by the Naval Observatory is
less than three one-hundredths of a
second.

and Wavland. all members of the class
of '21. Newland will hurl against Wol
ter's team and the other two will work
in the outfield.
Peavy, who captained the '23 var
sity, will hold down second base.
Heckendorf, Maillott, and Ratner, all
'22 men. will complete the infield.
On paper the collection of not-so
old-timers looks like a strong aggrega
tion and will furnish a real battle
against the varsity.
Saturday afternoon, the Olympic
Club will perform against the Cards.
In their last contest. Wolter's slug
ging crew fell on the Olympic pitcher
for nine runs in one inning.
To prevent a repetition of this dis
aster, the clubmen have added several
strong semi-pro players to their roster.
Clark, who played at short for Ire
land last Saturday, will be seen in
the same position for the Olympians.
He is one infielder who knows his
business, and, what is more, knows
how to accomplish it. •
Hermle, the lanky first baseman
who always furnishes a few thrills for
the bleachers, will be on hand to work
against Stanford.
In the box for the Olympics, will be
Gene Coruozzi. Gene has had hard
luck in his last two starts against the
Cards, but figures that good luck is
about due now.
Stanford will take the field with the
same line-up as was us«d last week
against Cliff Ireland's club. Oviatt or
Solomon will start in the box, with
Lawson at the receiving end.

The average error in the time signal
sent out by the Naval Observatory is
less than three one-hundredths of a
second.
