Tomorrow, the University, along with business and professional firms
all over the United States, suspends its work in honor of the birthday of
George Washington, the Father of ()ur Country.
Washington is commonly associated with all that is good, clean, and
righteous. He was a man of firm purpose, whom disappointments did not
phase. In the dark days during and following the American Revolution,
he stuck by his guns, undaunted, and finally won out.
As the first president of the United States, he is a shining example of
what a good citizen and a MAN should be.
He was a leader of his time. The leaders of the coming generation
are being developed at Stanford and her sister universities all over the
country.
The prayer of the nation is that our institutions of higher learning will
turn out more men like Washington.
