A university whose students hardly ever bother about plans for pre
venting the "next war" !
If some newspaper sensation-seeker should make that charge of Stan
ford, we would probably rise on our collective hind legs and call him a liar.
Then perhaps we would think it over calmly, and if we did, perhaps
we would wonder if we were entirely right in being so hasty. Only "per
haps," of course—for our self-esteem is too great to evaporate all at once,
and we all hate to believe that we are backward in important matters.
Yet try this simple test: Think back over the day's conversation. Do
you recall mentioning international affairs even once? What about the
whole week preceding—has it been as barren as today was?
It stings a little, doesn't it? .
In a few years most of us who are reading this tonight will be out
fighting for our living. It seems not unlikely that some of us will even be
married. Then perhaps a war will come alongt and our voices and the
voices of our families will rise in protest against the world-wide ciime
that will so lamentably affect us and our immediate interests; and we shall
perhaps wonder rather vaguely and dumbly why it all has to happen. Per
haps we shall even recollect our university days at Stanford, and, in so
recollecting, marvel at our own thoughtlessness in giving no attention to
the outside world.
But—wait a minute! Didn't we all talk about the Bok peace plan?
Wasn't there a lot of hot argument pro and con about it, especially if our
fathers happened to l>e bitter-end Republicans or idealistic Democrats?
Yes, there surely was, for at least a couple of days. N es, for at least a
couple of days. Then—
