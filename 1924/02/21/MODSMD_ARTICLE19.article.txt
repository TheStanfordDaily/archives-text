Tomorrow afternoon, on lowing I* leld, San two picktd
rugby teams will battle. 1 his game should be of more than ordinal)' in
terest to Stanford men and women.
From the men who play tomorrow will be chosen the team which is to
represent America at the Olympic games this year. There is a squad of
some forty men trying out. Of these forty, twelve are Stanford men
seven students and five alumni.
The team is coached by two men who formerly were Cardinal football
captains. It is probable that a Stanford man will accompany the team to
Kurope as trainer. At any rate, it is very probable that Stanford will be
well represented among the men who make up the squad.
Twenty men comprised the American team which won the rugby cham
pionship at the Olympic games in 1920. Of those twenty, ten were Stan
ford men. Rugby has always had a good following here.
Tickets for tomorrow's game are fifty cents and can be purchased at the
Board of Athletic Control office in the Administration building. The pro
ceeds will be turned over to the committee in charge, to help defray the
exj>enses of the team.
As tomorrow is a University holiday, there should be a large crowd of
Stanford rooters on hand to see the game.

"Keep off the grass," the old war-cry of Encina in defense of the
sward out in front, is still operating under a full head of steam. It is an
excellent sentiment, but too limited in application inside the same build
ing. Mid-quarters have impressed a hint upon some several minds, and
these persons are engaged in a bit of belated studying. In such cases, more
frivolous gentry might remember to "Keep off the grass."
