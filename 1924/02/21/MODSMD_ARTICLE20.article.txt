BE AMBITIOUS
When Noah built his famous ark
And waited for the rain,
The population had a lark
And laughter caused them pain;
The flood found Noah sitting Jake,
"For luck," they said, "he takes the
cake!"
When David twirled his leathern sling
And crowned Goliath's nob,
A hundred thousand felt the sting.
And envied David's job;
Men said, "He won that little tiff,
But Dave's an awlul luck stig!"
When Horatius swung his mighty
sword,
That ancient Roman day,
He proved he could not be ignored,
Before his geta-away;
And those who saw Horatius' pluck
Said, "Gee, that guy sure played in
luck."
No matter what a man attains
Upon this mortal earth,
By strength or prudence or his brains,
Or by increasing worth,
A lot of pikers in the muck
Will lay it all to Lady Luckâ€”D. M.
