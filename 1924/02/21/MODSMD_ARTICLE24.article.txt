# ALIEN ADVISES STUDY OF CLASSICAL MUSIC
## 
### 
Young people of today are getting
their ideas of musical classics from
jazz versions, according to Warren D.
Allen, University organist. "Why
don't they find out what the originals
sound like?"
Jazz has its place and may be useful
if it opens the way up to real music,
is his opinion, but if jazz is thought
the end in itself â€”and here Allen threw
up his hands. "By the way," he re
marked, "during the war kindly-dis
posed persons sent shell-shocked pa
tients into convulsions with synco
pated jazz."
"I hate the word 'highbrow'," said
Allen, "because if there is anything
that is human and appealing to the
manly as well as the womanly in
stincts it is music. The biggest cap
tains of industry are often men who
are also patrons of music."
He mentioned that Charles Schwab
sent the Bethlehem choir of 150 voices
on a special train to New York City
for a Bach program. George Eastman,
of the Kodak company, recently gave
four millions to the University of
Rochester for a school of music, which
is now one of the most extensive in
the country. The largest organ in the
world, according to Allen, is in the
Wanamaker store, of Pliiladelphia, and
it attracts thousands. "It has been
proven," he continued, "that at the
great industrial centers the bands,
glee clubs, and choruses are of pro
fessional caliber."
"As for the organ as a concert in
strument, more people are interested
in organ recitals than ever before,"
declared Allen. "I think one of the
difficulties in making the organ more
attractive is that it is so far removed,
and the performer is out of sight. But
the lack of intimacy surely is com
pensated for by the environment of
the Memorial Church."
Allen has given over 400 recitals in
his six years as University organist,
and several oratorios each year. "I
wish students would make requests
for special selections," he said. "Music
study develops the personality, satis
fies the emotions, and sharpens the
intelectual faculties."
