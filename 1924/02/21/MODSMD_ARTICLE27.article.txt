# HEALTH CONDITIONS SHOWN BY CAMPUS SURVEY ARE GOOD
## Dirty Backyards, Basements, Are Worst Offenses In Cleanliness 
### 
That the general sanitation on the
campus is good with the exception of
a few conditions that can be easily
remedied, was shown by a recent sur
vey of campus living groups made
under the direction of the faculty com
mittee on public health.
Statistics for the survey were gath
ered by Louis Olsen, Palo Alto health
officer.
"In view of the fact that no regular
inspection has been made for several
years, the report is very encouraging,"
said Dr. W. H. Barrow.
"The few conditions needing atten
tion, such as dirty backyards, ill-kept
basements, and careless disposal of
waste, can easily be corrected.
The keeping of ashes in a bathtub
was one of the minor conditions that
need to be corrected.
It is probable that similar inspec
tions will be made at regular intervals
in the future. The inspector found the
kitchens on the campus varying in
respect to cleanliness, but in none of
them was the condition serious.
In tabulating the sleeping porches
possessed by each house, it was found

that only four out of thirty-four houses
lack outdoor sleeping facilities. Five
houses get along without refrigerators.
The heating systems used are about
equally divided between steam heat
and hot air with a few depending on
gas and individual stoves.
