I of the new men. He ran the 352-yard
| event in 0:39 3-5, and also placed
second in the 220-yard dash. From the
| way in which he covered the 352 yards
| it looks like he will take the place of

than 0:50". He will have his first
I chance to run this distance in compe

I thon.

Informal Meet on Saturday
An informal meet is scheduled to
take place at 10:30 Saturday morning
on the varsity oval. Practically all of
the contenders for places on the var
sity and freshman squads will take
part.
The f.rst informal meet of the year
took place last Saturday.
All of the veterans showed their last
year's ability, but due to the earliness
of the season no exceptional perform
ances were recorded.
Story, a transfer who is eligible for
the varsity, was the most outstanding

I of the new men. He ran the 352-yard
| event in 0:39 3-5, and also placed
second in the 220-yard dash. From the
| way in which he covered the 352 yards
| it looks like he will take the place of
| "Blink" Williamson on the squad, and
act as running mate for Nelson Van
Judali. Rumor has it that Story runs
| consistently around the oval in less
than 0:50". He will have his first
I chance to run this distance in compe
: tition next Thursday at the Irish mara-
I thon.
Hartranft Going Well
"Tiny" Hartranft is settling down
to hard work in preparation for the
! coming meets. He took first in both
j the shot and discus last Saturday, al
| though his distances were not as great
as he does in actual competition. He
j got the discus out 133 feet 3 inches,
and the shot 43 feet 1 inch.
