# INTERCLASS NINES TO MEET IN FIRST GAME WEDNESDAY
## Seniors and Juniors Will Clash in Opening Contest 
### 
With the first game scheduled for j
next ednesday, the interclass base- j
ball teams are brushing the dust off
the willow stick and getting in some
practice licks.
Six contests have been arranged for !
the series, each team playing one
game with each other team. Dates for
the contests are:
Feb. 27 —Seniors vs. Juniors.
Mar. 3—Freshmen vs. Sophomores.
Mar. s—Sophomores vs. Seniors.
Mar. 6 —Juniors vs. Freshmen.
Mar. 10—Freshmen vs. Seniors.
Mar. 12—Sophomores vs. Juniors.
All games are scheduled for 4:15.
Games with the freshmen will be
played on the freshman field. Other
games are to be played on the inter
class diamonds near the military head
quarters, where the football fields !
were located.
No varsity men are eligible for in
terclass competition. Men on the fresh-'
man squad, however, can participate.
This should give the freshmen a dis- !
tinct edge. Besides being able to play |
their best men, they have the advan-'
tage of having played preliminary
games.
Last year the seniors won the series,
with the juniors taking second place,!
and the freshmen and sophomores j
tieing for third. This year, however,
the teams have stepped up one notch, j
the former juniors being seniors, and j
so on.
The dope rates the present seniors !
to repeat their last year's victory over
the next two lower classes. The sen-!
iors have lost fewest, men to the var
sity squad.
Half a dozen of the best men from
the present sophomore and junior
classes who played last year will not 1
be eligible for interclass competition \

j 011 account of transfer to the varsity.
1 The freshmen have shown up fairly
well in their games with outside
schools, and if all the men come out
for interclass, they stand a good
, chance of nosing out the sophomores
' and resuming first place in the all-
I sport standing.
