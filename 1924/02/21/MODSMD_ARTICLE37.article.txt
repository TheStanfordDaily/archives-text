### 
"Stock brokerage offers by far the
best opportunities for the college man
stock and bond business." said George
N. Keys to n, of the Lcib-Keyston stock
and bond firm of San Francisco in dis
cussing the opportunities for the col
lege man as a bond dealer or stock
broker.
"The bond business is the most ac
cessible field but one which is over
crowded and in which competition is
severe," continued the speaker. "The
profits of the bond salesman draw
many college men into the bond field
while on the other hand the stock
brokerage business is one requiring
two or three years of drudgery at
clerical work before the beginner makes
much progress. Especially on the
coast, the competition in the bond
business has become so keen that it
takes unusual personality and persist
ence to get ahead.
"San Francisco has the only stock
exchange that can compare at all with
the New York exchange. For this rea
son, the Pacific coast is an especially
good district in which to enter the
stock and bond business."
Keyston explained in detail the two
phases of the business, namely the bqnd
dealer and the stock broker. He also
described the business of the stock ex
change and the street trader, who deals
in securities having a market too small
to list on the exchange or to go through
the regular broker.
"The field of financial advertising is
one practically undeveloped and one
with great possibilities," said Mr. Keys
ton. "The stock and bond business has
much to offer a man with good business
ability and his success depends in a
great part upon his ability to think and
act quickly."
