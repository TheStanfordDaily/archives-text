# CARD LIGHTWEIGHTS BOW BEFORE ATTACK OF CALIFORNIA FIVE
## Berkeley 130-Pounders Take Series as Result of 23 to 16 Win Last Night 
### 
California won the 130-pound bas
ketball series last night by defeating
the Card lightweights 215 to 16 in a
rough game. Schultzberg, Stanford
guard, and Kitow, forward, were car
ried off the floor, injured.
Allen, California center, was taken
out of the game in the first half with
four personals. Hobro, Stanford for
ward, was taken out 011 the same
count early in the second period. The
Card center, Hogle, played the entire
second half with three personals
against him. Eleven fouls were called
against Stanford and eleven against
California.
U. C. Leads at Half Time
The Blue and Gold five took the
lead early in the game. The score at
half time was 14 to 12 in favor of the
Berkeleyites. In the second half, Stan
ford was able to score but one field
goal and two fouls.
Hogle, Stanford center, was high
point man of the game with four field
goals and one score from the foul
line.
The game was full of action, but not
so full of basketball. Stanford took
many wild shots at basket. Schultz
berg, standing guard, although he
I
fought hard every minute he was in
the game, was often drawn away from
the basket.
Ponsi, California forward, played
a clever game. He and Leith did most
of the scoring for the Bruins. In the
last minute of play the Bears put an
entirely new team on the floor.
