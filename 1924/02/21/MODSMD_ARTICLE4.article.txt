i Davis' class in Theatrical Workshop
j next Thursday in the Assembly Hall,
i Aileene Burks will appear before cam
! pus playgoers in her most strongly
emotional role since her introduction
to Stanford audiences this year. As
Pierrette, the neglected lover of the ir

i ing spinster, developing the difficult
I transition from youth to old age in the
; three successive acts. In the coming
| playlet Miss Burks will be called upon
j to give her role all of the warmth and
| youth belonging to the ideal lover.
