# TWELVE REMITS SURVIVE OLYMPIC GAME TEAM SLASH
## Norm Cleaveland and Dick Hyland Are Doped as Probable Choices 
### 
Seven Stanford undergraduates and
five Card alumni survived the cut of
rugby candidates for the 1924 Olympic
Games.
The undergraduates include Norm
Cleaveland, Lynn Faust, Jim Kelly,
Phil Clark, "Porky" Dwight, and Dud
DeGroot. Alumni who will remain with
the squad are: Jack Patrick, Charlie
Doe, Morris Kirksey, "Red" Houser,
Merlin Henry.
The most promising among the list
of Stanford men are Norm Cleave
land, who played halfback on the var
sity football team last season, and
Dick Hyland, star 1926 backfield man.
Both are old rugby players, and their
chances of surviving the next cut are
exceedingly better than that of any
other college candidate.
Wylie, Austin Good Material
Jim Wylie, once a Stanford rugby
coach, and Captain Charlie Austin,
who also held the position of rugby
mentor on the campus in the years
when the game was one of the princi
pal major sports, are also probable

To Play British, French Teams
Twenty-five players will make up
the personnel of the Olympic Games
rugby team, which will leave May 8.
The eleven will probably play a series
of games with English and French
teams before the regular scheduled
contests.
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports at the University, is in line to
go with the squad as trainer. Maloney
has had a great deal of experience as
a rugby player and roach.
Ten of the twenty rugby players
who represented the United States in
1920 were members of the Stanford
rugby teams. The American team
made a clean sweep in that year, de
