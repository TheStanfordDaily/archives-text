# TWELVE REMITS SURVIVE OLYMPIC GAME TEAM SLASH
## Norm Cleaveland and Dick Hyland Are Doped as Probable Choices

five Card alumni survived the cut of
rugby candidates for the 1924 Olympic

The undergraduates include Norm
Cleaveland, Lynn Faust, Jim Kelly,
Phil Clark, "Porky" Dwight, and Dud

the squad are: Jack Patrick, Charlie

Merlin Henry.

chances of surviving the next cut are
exceedingly better than that of any
other college candidate.
