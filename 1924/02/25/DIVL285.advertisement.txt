Gaulard and (iibbs originated the alternating

practical in many respects, but had been used with
some success for lighting.
George Westinghouse became interested, and im

system lay in the design and principles governing
He devoted the resources of his organization to
the development of the transformer. When he made
it a practical unit, alternating current, with its vast
commercial advantages, then became possible.
The beginning of the bitter struggle by George
Westinghouse for the supremacy of alternating
