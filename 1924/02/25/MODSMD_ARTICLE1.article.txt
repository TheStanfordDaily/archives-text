### Bert Andrews 
Celebrating the holiday week-end in a
fitting manner, the varsity ball team wal
loped the Northern Alumni on Friday,
10-0. and squeezed through with a 5-4
win over the Olympic Club team in an
eleventh inning battle, Saturday.
Oviatt Stars for Cards
Tod Oviatt, in the box for Stanford in
the first game, held the alumni sluggers
to two hits and was never in danger of
letting the alumni score. Just to be sure
of sewing the game up, Oviatt poled a
home run over the left field fence in the
fourth inning. During the rest of the
afternoon he added a pair of safe blows
to his total
The alumni team played a good game
in the field but showed lack of batting
practice, Maillot and Deffenbach being
the only ones to nick the Stanford hurler
for safeties
The varsity collected thirteen hits,
Roberts coming in for his share as usual.
Cuddeback, Johnston, and Woodward got
a pair of blows apiece.
Stanford Scores First
In the Olympic Club game, Stanford
started out with a run in the first. Rob
erts walked and scored when the club's
centerfielder let McCandless' hit go
through. McCandless was out trying to
make it home ahead of the throw. The
varsity added another run in the fourth
and prepared to hold the lead. But things
went wrong.
Powell, first man up for the Olympic in
the fifth, was out, Cuddeback to Wood
ward. Then the explosion.
Larkin smashed a hot one to Johnston
in left. Johnston let it go through, Lar
kin going to second. Viverous lined a
grounded to Mulchay, and Mulchayay
heaved the ball three feet over Wood
ward's head. No one was hurt but Lar
kin scored and Viverous went to second.
Clubmen Strike Out
Clarke, the club pitcher, singled, send
ing Viverous across the pan. When
Altshul struck out, things looked better.
Cuddeback, however, imitated Mulchay
