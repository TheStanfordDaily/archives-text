# VARSITY NINE WINS FROM WINGED "O" AND ALUMNI CLUBS
## Stanford Downs Olympians 5-4â€”Cardinals Defeat Comebacks, 10-0 
### Bert Andrews 
Celebrating the holiday week-end in a
fitting manner, the varsity ball team wal
loped the Northern Alumni on Friday,
10-0. and squeezed through with a 5-4
win over the Olympic Club team in an
eleventh inning battle, Saturday.
Oviatt Stars for Cards
Tod Oviatt, in the box for Stanford in
the first game, held the alumni sluggers
to two hits and was never in danger of
letting the alumni score. Just to be sure
of sewing the game up, Oviatt poled a
home run over the left field fence in the
fourth inning. During the rest of the
afternoon he added a pair of safe blows
to his total
The alumni team played a good game
in the field but showed lack of batting
practice, Maillot and Deffenbach being
the only ones to nick the Stanford hurler
for safeties
The varsity collected thirteen hits,
Roberts coming in for his share as usual.
Cuddeback, Johnston, and Woodward got
a pair of blows apiece.
Stanford Scores First
In the Olympic Club game, Stanford
started out with a run in the first. Rob
erts walked and scored when the club's
centerfielder let McCandless' hit go
through. McCandless was out trying to
make it home ahead of the throw. The
varsity added another run in the fourth
and prepared to hold the lead. But things
went wrong.
Powell, first man up for the Olympic in
the fifth, was out, Cuddeback to Wood
ward. Then the explosion.
Larkin smashed a hot one to Johnston
in left. Johnston let it go through, Lar
kin going to second. Viverous lined a
grounded to Mulchay, and Mulchayay
heaved the ball three feet over Wood
ward's head. No one was hurt but Lar
kin scored and Viverous went to second.
Clubmen Strike Out
Clarke, the club pitcher, singled, send
ing Viverous across the pan. When
Altshul struck out, things looked better.
Cuddeback, however, imitated Mulchay
on the next and threw Hundley's grounder
over the first baseman's head, counting
Clarke, and permitting Handley to take
third. Rose singled, scoring Handley,
making it four runs for the visitors.!
Hills popped up a fly to Bud Woodward
next, who dropped it hut he recovered
in time to shoot it to Solomon at first
and the excitement was over.
But the varsity went after more scores
in a systematic way. In the sixth, the '
cluh third baseman and shortstop decided
that Mulchay and Cuddeback weren't the ]
only ill fielders who could pull boots. They !
proved it and after the dust had cleared j
away, the varsity had another score
counted.
Roberts Ties Score
Roberts came through with the tying
run in the seventh and the game pro- j
ceedcd into extra innings. Solomon was
pitching a better game as each inning
went by and his support was better.
In the eleventh, Mulchay got his first
hit of the day, went to second 011 Solo
mon's sacrifice and scored when Shorty
Roberts tapped out a hit.

Celebrating the holiday week-end in a
fitting manner, the varsity ball team wal
loped the Northern Alumni on Friday,
10-0. and squeezed through with a 5-4
win over the Olympic Club team in an
eleventh inning battle, Saturday.
Oviatt Stars for Cards
Tod Oviatt, in the box for Stanford in
the first game, held the alumni sluggers
to two hits and was never in danger of
letting the alumni score. Just to be sure
of sewing the game up, Oviatt poled a
home run over the left field fence in the
fourth inning. During the rest of the
afternoon he added a pair of safe blows
to his total
The alumni team played a good game
in the field but showed lack of batting
practice, Maillot and Deffenbach being
the only ones to nick the Stanford hurler
for safeties
The varsity collected thirteen hits,
Roberts coming in for his share as usual.
Cuddeback, Johnston, and Woodward got
a pair of blows apiece.
Stanford Scores First
In the Olympic Club game, Stanford
started out with a run in the first. Rob
erts walked and scored when the club's
centerfielder let McCandless' hit go
through. McCandless was out trying to
make it home ahead of the throw. The
varsity added another run in the fourth
and prepared to hold the lead. But things
went wrong.
Powell, first man up for the Olympic in
the fifth, was out, Cuddeback to Wood
ward. Then the explosion.
Larkin smashed a hot one to Johnston
in left. Johnston let it go through, Lar
kin going to second. Viverous lined a
grounded to Mulchay, and Mulchayay
heaved the ball three feet over Wood
ward's head. No one was hurt but Lar
kin scored and Viverous went to second.
Clubmen Strike Out
Clarke, the club pitcher, singled, send
ing Viverous across the pan. When
Altshul struck out, things looked better.
Cuddeback, however, imitated Mulchay
on the next and threw Hundley's grounder
over the first baseman's head, counting
Clarke, and permitting Handley to take
third. Rose singled, scoring Handley,
making it four runs for the visitors.!
Hills popped up a fly to Bud Woodward
next, who dropped it hut he recovered
in time to shoot it to Solomon at first
and the excitement was over.
But the varsity went after more scores
in a systematic way. In the sixth, the '
cluh third baseman and shortstop decided
that Mulchay and Cuddeback weren't the ]
only ill fielders who could pull boots. They !
proved it and after the dust had cleared j
away, the varsity had another score
counted.
Roberts Ties Score
Roberts came through with the tying
run in the seventh and the game pro- j
ceedcd into extra innings. Solomon was
pitching a better game as each inning
went by and his support was better.
In the eleventh, Mulchay got his first
hit of the day, went to second 011 Solo
mon's sacrifice and scored when Shorty
Roberts tapped out a hit.

Celebrating the holiday week-end in a
fitting manner, the varsity ball team wal
loped the Northern Alumni on Friday,
10-0. and squeezed through with a 5-4
win over the Olympic Club team in an
eleventh inning battle, Saturday.
Oviatt Stars for Cards
Tod Oviatt, in the box for Stanford in
the first game, held the alumni sluggers
to two hits and was never in danger of
letting the alumni score. Just to be sure
of sewing the game up, Oviatt poled a
home run over the left field fence in the
fourth inning. During the rest of the
afternoon he added a pair of safe blows
to his total
The alumni team played a good game
in the field but showed lack of batting
practice, Maillot and Deffenbach being
the only ones to nick the Stanford hurler
for safeties
The varsity collected thirteen hits,
Roberts coming in for his share as usual.
Cuddeback, Johnston, and Woodward got
a pair of blows apiece.
Stanford Scores First
In the Olympic Club game, Stanford
started out with a run in the first. Rob
erts walked and scored when the club's
centerfielder let McCandless' hit go
through. McCandless was out trying to
make it home ahead of the throw. The
varsity added another run in the fourth
and prepared to hold the lead. But things
went wrong.
Powell, first man up for the Olympic in
the fifth, was out, Cuddeback to Wood
ward. Then the explosion.
Larkin smashed a hot one to Johnston
in left. Johnston let it go through, Lar
kin going to second. Viverous lined a
grounded to Mulchay, and Mulchayay
heaved the ball three feet over Wood
ward's head. No one was hurt but Lar
kin scored and Viverous went to second.
Clubmen Strike Out
Clarke, the club pitcher, singled, send
ing Viverous across the pan. When
Altshul struck out, things looked better.
Cuddeback, however, imitated Mulchay
on the next and threw Hundley's grounder
over the first baseman's head, counting
Clarke, and permitting Handley to take
third. Rose singled, scoring Handley,
making it four runs for the visitors.!
Hills popped up a fly to Bud Woodward
next, who dropped it hut he recovered
in time to shoot it to Solomon at first
and the excitement was over.
But the varsity went after more scores
in a systematic way. In the sixth, the '
cluh third baseman and shortstop decided
that Mulchay and Cuddeback weren't the ]
only ill fielders who could pull boots. They !
proved it and after the dust had cleared j
away, the varsity had another score
counted.
Roberts Ties Score
Roberts came through with the tying
run in the seventh and the game pro- j
ceedcd into extra innings. Solomon was
pitching a better game as each inning
went by and his support was better.
In the eleventh, Mulchay got his first
hit of the day, went to second 011 Solo
mon's sacrifice and scored when Shorty
Roberts tapped out a hit.
