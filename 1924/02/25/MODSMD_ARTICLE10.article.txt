# ODDS FAVOR CUBS IN THIRD CONTEST WITH CARD BABES
## Teams to Meet in Deciding Game on Oakland Floor Tomorrow Evening 
### 
California will have a decided edge
over the Stanford freshmen when the
two teams meet in the third encounter
of their annual scries in the Oakland
auditorium tomorrow night.
Both teams have won one game so
far. The Stanford team was victorious
in the first game played at Berkeley.
When the fives met for the second clash
Stanford had the best of the odds, due
to the previous victory and to the fact
that the contest was on the home court.
However, Stanford had an off night,
and this plus over-confidence brought
defeat. California won in a slow game,
the score being 14 to 9. 0
Cards May Win.
If the Babes line up the way they did
in the first match they should be able
to defeat the Cubs and take the series.
However, the Oakland auditorium is a
hard place to play in, and, as the Stan
ford men are not used to this court,
they will be up against a considerable
handicap as the Cubs have played in it
before.
Babes Defeated Once.
The defeat last week was the only
one the freshmen have had this year.
They had previously won fourteen
games, and had been victorious over
teams that had defeated California. The
Blue and Gold triumph came as a sur
prise, and Coach "Husky" Hunt has
had his hands full since Wednesday to
prepare his charges for the coming fray.
When California got the lead in last
Wednesday's contest the Babes seemed
to forget their team play altogether.
The forwards were unable to locate the
net, and enough shots went wild to win
a couple of games. If the Babes can
get used to the bankboards in the audi
torium tomorrow before the game
starts they will have an even break, as
Price atid David are consistent shooters.
Hunt will start the same lineup that
went against the Cubs Wednesday.
Price and David will be forwards; Jay
red, center, and Shipkcy and New
house, guards,,
