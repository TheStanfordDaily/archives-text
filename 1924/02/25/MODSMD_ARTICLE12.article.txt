# CALIFORNIA BREAKS TRIPLE TIE BY DEFEATING STANFORD 27 TO 23 IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Card Quintet Loses Heavy Lead in First Half Before Powerful Bruin Offensive Drive 
### 
QALIFORNIA took the lead in the southern half of the Pacific Coast
Conference by defeating the Stanford varsity quintet, 27 to 23, in the
pavilion last Saturday night.
Ability to come back with the odds heavily against it gave the California
five the victory.
Stanford was leading at the end of the first halt', 14 to 11.
Bears Stage Rally
Ten minutes before the game ended the two quintets were running nevk
and-neck, the score shifting first to favor one team, then the other. With but
five minutes to go, both were tied at 19 all. Then the California offensive
pushed the game to the limit. Scores by Kyte, Talt, Houvenin, and Higgins,
coming in rapid succession, gave the Bruins a lead of 25 to 19, before the
Stanford team had time to put out an effective check.
Stanford fought desperately for the remainder of the game, and for a
period it looked as if the Cards would accomplish the impossible.

* But the Bear quintet stalled to ad
vantage, and while it scored but once
after the strong splurge, it managed to
hold the Redshirts at arm's length
from victory.
Cards Lead First Half
The Cardinal quintet piled score on
score during the first half. Everything
pointed to an overwhelming Stanford
lead on which to begin the next period.
"Nip" McHose was shooting field goals
with deadly accuracy from the side of
the court, and the California men were
puzzled by their inability to penetrate
the Card defense.
Ladar scored the first point of the
game on a foul by Mcßurney. Kincaid
fouled, and Nevers converted. McHose
took time to shoot a hard basket from
the side of the court, and Stanford
was ahead, 3 to 1. Then followed a
bevy of fouls, intermingled with suc
cessive scoring on the side of the
Card five.
California awoke from a reverie to
find the score 11 to 2 in favor of the
Card court men. Slowly but surely the
Bruin aggregation advanced the score,
eating up the Cardinal advantage un
til the half ended with the Redshirts
three points ahead, and the score 14
to 11.
Stanford seemed over-anxious to
pile up a bigger and bigger lead, in
stead of taking the opportunity to
stall and await openings with a score
heavily in its favor.
In the last part of the second half
the Card defense was completely de
moralized, and it was not uncommon
to see a California player sneak up to
the basket with no one to prevent his
making a set-up shot.
McHose Stars
"Nip" McHose battled desperately
throughout the whole game, but his
thirteen points alone could not win
the game with the remainder of the
squad, Mcßurney excepted, shooting
with consistent and tearing ragged
ness.
The final battle of the Pacific Coast
Conference will take place tomorrow

! night in the Oakland Auditorium be
tween California and Stanford. If Cali
fornia wins, it has the right to meet
the northern champion. Stanford win
ning, the three teams, California, U.
S. C., and Stanford are tied for honors.
