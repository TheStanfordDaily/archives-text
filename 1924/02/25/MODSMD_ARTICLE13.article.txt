# ONE-ACT PLAYS WILL BE PRESENTED BY DRAMATISTS
## 
### 
"Michael's Mother," R. B. Fitzgerald's
one-act play which is to be presented by
Gordon Davis' class in Theatrical Work
shop in the assembly hall Thursday night,
is a dramatization of the clash between
love and ambition.
It is but a few hours before iMichael
is to enter the priesthood when the cur
tain rises. The hope of the boy's parents,
old country Irish folk, who have pros
pered in New England, is about to be
fulfilled. As he is about to give up
women forever, Michael realizes that he
is in love, and it is finally Michael's
mother who must solve the problem.
Clark to Star
For the first time on any stage, H. M.
"Jim" Clark, pitcher on last year's var
sity baseball nine, will appear Thursday
as Bart Shaunessy. Clark's Irish dialect,
which has popularized many parlor stories
at informal sittings, will be brought into
action. In rehearsing the role of iriate
father, Clark is very convincing.
Charles Parson is cast as Michael. Par
son is said to be something of a dra
matic find. Hitherto, the rich emotional
qualities of his voice have been used on
the stage merely to yell to a busy stage
manager.
Opposite Parson, Alice Wilbur will act
in the role of Ellen, his favored colleen.
Kathaleen Hill is and Enid Root, direc
tors of this playlet, say that Miss Wilbur
promises to score heavily in this part,
which she makes her debut into campus
theatricals.
Irene Thompson in Cast
Irene Thompson will appear as Mrs.
Shaunessy, Michael's mother. This part
has perhaps the most dramatic possi
bilities of all the characters in the play.
Fitzgerald has written exceptionally good
lines for Miss Thompson. Mrs. Burke, a
neighbor, will be played by Grace Peter
son.
This playlet and "Let's Pretend." Scherl
Levy's imaginative fantasy, make good
companion acts for an evening's pro
gram. The "tense realism of Fitzgerald
and the lyric quality of Levy's blank verse
make the playlets contrast to each other's
advantage.
There will be no admission charge to
see the show, which is given as part of
the Theatrical Workshop course. The
curtain will rise at 8 o'clock instead of
I at 8 :30 as was previously announced.
