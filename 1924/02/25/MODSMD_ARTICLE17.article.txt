UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA
DAVIS FARM
Davis, California,
February 19, 1924.
Mr. Harry Maloney,
Stanford University,
California.
Dear Mr. Maloney:
On behalf of the California Aggies 1 wish to thank you and your de
partment for the courtesies extended to, and care taken of our boxing team
during its visit to your campus last week.
However, this was not my first visit to your campus, by past experi
ences I knew that our stay with you would be made very pleasant but I
never dreamed to be taken charge of and entertained as royally as you and
your assistants did us. You made it almost a pleasure to lose the meet to
your team.
We are looking forward with pleasure to your coming visit. Let me
urge that you do not hesitate to make any suggestions for the meet here.
Please let me know of any details you wish looked after before your ar
rival in Davis.
Again I wish to thank you for the pleasures we enjoyed while on your
campus. Give my best regards to your team.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) WAYNE McCORKLE,
Faculty Manager of Boxing.
The above letter serves as a fine example of what good sportsmanship
can do for the reputation of a university. It is this kind of feeling that
puts intercollegiate athletics on the right basis. A visiting team is bound to
appreciate good treatment and resent any other kind.
Teams and coaches have come to expect good sportsmanship at Stan
ford among athletes, coaches, and spectators. Fortunately, they are sel
dom disappointed.
However, a contrast between the impression received by the Davis
Farm men and that which officials in last Saturday rfight's basketball game
must have carried away, is odious. The men who handled that game were
thoroughly competent and unbiased. Undoubtedly, they made some mis
takes during the evening. If they hadn't they would not have been human.
While Stanford rooters were partly to blame for the booing, they were
not alone responsible. At times, it was hard to tell whether the noise came j
from the Stanford side of the pavilion, or whether it was an echo from
the opposite side.
Both California and Stanford rooters stepped outside the bounds of
good sportsmanship. There is no definite procedure which may be taken
to eliminate such actions. As long as there is a certain small percentage
of people who forget themselves, there will be booing and hissing.
It might be well to relate, in this connection, the story of the farmer,
who, with his wife, once attended a baseball game in the city. In the
progress of the game, the umpire made a questionable decision, whereupon,
spectators began to hiss. Turning to his wife, the farmer said:
"That's funny, out on the farm the only creatures that hiss, are snakes
and geese."
