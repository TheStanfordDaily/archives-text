"Smiths Lead In Census At U. C."â€”
headline.
It seems unfair that nobody but the
Smiths and Millers and perhaps the
Browns once in a while, get a chance
to lead all the different censuses, or
censi. Why not give some other com
mon family name, such as Woggen
britzel or Blumph, a chance to show
its worth?
Anyway, Lincoln's name wasn't
Smith.
