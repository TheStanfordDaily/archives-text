David Warfield in "The Merchant of
Venice" — Columbia theater — David
Warfield's original interpretation of the
famous old Jew shows him as a much
more human character than the cring
ing, scheming villain to which one is ac
customed. Warfield's Shylock is a de
termined, revengeful old man—but he
seems half-crazed by the double loss of
his daughter and his ducats, a pathetic
ally thwarted figure. He is neither vil
lain nor hero, but merely unfortunate
man.
Some of the scenes of the original
play have been cut out to give more
prominence to the scene in which the
personalities of Shylock, Portia, and
Bassanio are portrayed. Mary Servoss
is a most charming and effective Por
tia. The production has all the finish
to be expected of Belasco, and the sim
ple stage settings are very beautiful.

"Fool's Highway," at the Granada.
The picture is taken from Owen Kil
dare's novel, "My Mamie Rose," a story
of the Bowery with all the usual props
—background of saloons, politicians,
and Mary Philbin starring as the sweet
young reformer of a Bowery "tough."
The picture is not so bad, as that type
goes, but it seems a pity to waste Miss
Philbin's delightful and evident talent
on anything so commonplace.
Paul Ash's musical interlude,
"Twenty Minutes on the Bowery" in
cludes some very clever numbers, es
pecially the first, a take-off on the old
Bowery street dances.
