This communication■ might be entitled j
"Much Ado About Nothing." As far as j
the electioneering is concerned, the Daily j
Palo Alto believes that there is very little i
of it going on illegitimately.
Certainly, it is within the poiver of the
Election Hoard to count the votes at any
time it desires. The principal reason that
votes have been counted so early is that it'
is necessary for the results to be available I
at about 2:30 if they are to be printed in;
the Daily Palo Alto.
Editor,

Dear Sir: Will some charitable person
well versed on the subject of political eti- |
quette be kind enough to enlighten a num- I
ber of questioning dumbbells like myself , j
concerning the fololwing:
How long has it been vogue for the
members of the Election Board to
electioneer while acting in official ca
pacity at the polls?
Why should the ballot box be
empty at 1:40 p. m. if the polls are
not scheduled to be closed until 2 p. m.,
and voting goes on until 2 p. m. ?
Should the board keep count of the
votes as the election takes place so
that it can give information to those
yet to vote? Should the board be i
able to tell you a half hour or so be
fore the polls close who is winning
out and who has already lost out?
My opinion concerning the above seems
to he in direct opposition with the prac
tice on the campus, hence this S. O. S.
