### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Now that Georges Carpentier lias started something, why not let some other
celebrities finish it? Dispatches from Paris say that his long locks are
marcelled so that they. fall in semi-curls over his ears. Wouldn't Jack
Dempsey look pretty with his hair fixed that way, maybe with a hair net, too?
And the Bambino —oh, girls, just look at him —the name Ruth sure suits
the home run queen, now. She'll run home after each game to rearrange her
permanent wave. Hut think of the sad side of this, too —take a peek at the
shiny dome of the Polish prima donna, Stanislaus Zbyszko. He ain't got no
locks to marcel, and toup£s cost $10.50, which is too much to pay!
