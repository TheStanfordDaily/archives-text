# TYPES OF PICTURE FRAMES GRADUALLY CHANGE, SAYS LEMOS
## Hand-Carved, Parti-Colored Frames Replace Models In Gold Tones

| "Visitors to art galleries have
! doubtless noticed the gradual change
jin the type of frames found around
I the paintings placed on exhibit," was
1 a comment made by John Lemos, of
the Stanford Art Gallery.
"Not very many years back an art
| ist to be in style found it necessary to
| surround his picture with a so-called
gold frame. This French method of
framing pictures was based upon the
idea that gold would match with prac
| tically any color and 'what could be
j richer than gold?' With the advent of
these gilt frames came the fad of em
; bellishing them with all manner of
1 ornamentation, until in many cases
j the frame itself became the predomi
i nant part of the picture. Much of the
I over-ornamentation can be attributed
! to the framer's desire to make plenty
of work for himself.
Whistler Designed Frames
"Even in the early days there was
j a reaction against the roeocco type of
frame and we find men like Whistler
designing frames of individual char
j acter. The so-called 'fluted' frame,
1 which is still very popular, was a con
j ception of Whistler's.
"These frames contain narrow
; straight grooves carved into them and
! running around the edge of the frame.
! This idea kept the frame from appear
j ing severe and at the same time sub
j consciously carried the onlooker's eye
i from one part of the picture composi-
I tion to another."
Trend Toward Individual Frames
Lemos remarked that the present
trend is toward frames of an individu
al nature. In the modern exhibitions
are found hand-carved frames, parti
colored frames and those simply orna
mented with a medium known as
"compo."
Hand-carved frames are effective
and usually ornamented at the corners
with a simple motif. Parti-colored
frames are completed in two or more
colors. One of these is generally a
dull or grayed gold and the other some
i color which repeats a color found in
the painting itself.
"This method invariably connects
the frame with the picture from a
color standpoint and makes the two
a unit," explained Lemos.
"Compo" Applied to Frames
The material known as "compo" is
I a specially prepared sort of clay thai
! is applied when hot and used to build
j up relief surfaces. When dry it is firm
| and brittle and can then be colored to
match the frame. Reliefo is a similar
' substance, but easier to work with.
| and can be applied with a brush. It
is especially good for the smaller
frames and comes in a variety of col
ors.
"Many people do not know that old
gilt frames which are marred or too
'goudy,' may be given a 'gasoline
wash'," he said. This work is made by
mixing the desired color or oil paint
down to a thin consistency with ordi
nary gasoline. The wash is put over
the frame with a brush and when near
ly dry is rubbed lightly with a soft
cloth. The gasoline wash allows just
enough of the original color showing
through to give a rich effect. By se
lecting a color which matches some
hue in the picture, the frame can be
toned to go with the painting.
