Oyster Home Built in 1893.
The Oyster home, which is located
between the Beta and Chi Omega
houses, was built in about 1893 by Lieu
tenant Oyster, a son-in-law of Mr.
Tubbs, one of the early trustees of the
University. Lieutenant Oyster had
charge of the first military company on
the campus. Students joined the group
voluntarily. The lieutenant had retired
from the army on account of deafness.
In 1917 a son of Lieutenant Oyster,
who died several years ago, graduated

In the early days, the place where
the Sigma Alpha Epsiloti house now
stands was occupied by a boarding
house run by Mrs. O. W. Dunn, who

for about 20 years has owned the big,
white colonial house at 13 Lasuen be
tween the Beta and Theta houses. This
latter residence is still occupied by Mrs.
Dunn. Another home of interest is the

of Lagunita. Mr. Charles Lathrop, a
brother of Mrs. Stanford and for years
a trustee, treasurer, and business man
ager of the University, owned the
place. The home is now occupied by

abandoned by the laborers a large num
ber of men students moved into these
quarters. The buildings were occupied
by students for at least ten years, some
of the most noted Stanford graduates
having been inhabitants of the "camps."
