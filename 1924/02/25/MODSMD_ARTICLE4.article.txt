### 
Target shooting by night has lately
been added to the list of outdoor
sports at Stanford. The light on the
Theta Chi mast has lately been serv
ing as a convenient objective for bul
lets from rifles in the hands of prowl
ing snipers. Whether it is the Rifle
Club out for a little extra practice or
the Ku Klux Klan trying to show how
rough they really can be has not been
ascertained. Anyhow, the blinking
thing has been blown to blazes at
least three times in the past week.
