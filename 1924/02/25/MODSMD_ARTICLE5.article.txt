# IRISH MARATHON TO FORMALLY USHER IN 1924 TRACK SEASON
## Richardson and Swayne Run Close Race in Half-Mile At Saturday's Meet 
### 
Interest is centering on the Irish Mara
thon, which will take place on the varsity
track oval next Thursday afternoon. Be
sides the marathon a number of novelty
events will be on the program.
Class Tryouts Open.
All men who wish to participate in
the distance event are asked to report
to the class captains at once for try
outs. Twenty-four men from each class
will run a Quarter of a mile. Runners
who can cover the distance in less than
:60 should sign up for their respective
class teams.
Prizes will be given for the man who
makes the best varsity time, and for
the one who makes the best non-varsity
time. Last year Nelson Van Judah,
present track captain, took the varsity
honors with :51 flat. He is expected to
repeat this performance again this year.
Storey Fast.
Of the non-varsity runners, Storey
will undoubtedly cop first place. He
ran the 440 in :50 flat at San Jose Fri
day, and Saturday morning in the in
formal meet turned in a time of :5l 2-5.
As yet no freshmen stars have been
seen.
The list of events for Thursday's pro
gram has not been announced. The an
nual holdover show will probably take
place, but no plans have been sched
uled for it. The feature events will in
clude a three-legged race, a one hun
dred yard dash backwards, a greased
pig race, and a chicken chase.
An informal track meet was held last
Saturday morning, with most of the
varsity men taking part. The time and
distances were all good for this early
in the season, although no exceptional
performances were turned in.
Half-mile Race Close.
Bill Richardson and Bill Swayne ran
a close race in the half mile. Richard
