# CARD QUINTET LOSES 145-POUND TITLE TO BEARS, 34-20
## 
### 
Light heavyweight basketball honors
went to California Saturday night when
the Bruin 145-pound five defeated Stan
ford 34 to 20. California took the series
in two straight victories.
The Stanford 145's put up a much bet
ter game than they did last Saturday at
Oakland, but the improvement was not
sufficient to put the Cards on an equal
basis with the Bear quintet.
Clement, California center, was the
outstanding star of the game. He made a
total of nine points for the Blue and
Gold team, and his clever floor work and
passing were important factors in the
California victory.
Neer, Alexander, and Stewart each
contributed two field goals to the Stan
ford total. Knox and Smith each made
one.
O'Hara and Lund did good work in
the guard positions, but the California
forwards, aided by Clement, often
passed around them.
Knox started at center, but Stewart
was sent in during the second period,
giving way to Knox again near the
end of the game.
California led at half time 14 to 8,
and Stanford was never able to over
take the lead.
