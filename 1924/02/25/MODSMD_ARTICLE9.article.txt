# Row Rejoices As Chinamen Return After Tong War
## 
### 
The war is over! And peace and
quiet reign once again in the domestic
regions of several of the houses on
the Row where the kitchens are pre
sided over by oriental potentates.
Great consternation was evident yes
terday afternoon. Visions of Palo Alto
restaurants were agonizing the un
fortunated who were bidding tearful
farewells to their cooks. With food
and clothing to last for an appallingly
long time, the dutiful tong members
departed.
But this morning Chong and Woo
came back with beaming faces for the
tongs are again at peace.
