The way to get
the finest shave
The Hinge-Cap is a sure way of identifying
Williams Shaving Cream. And Williams, be
sides giving you the convenient Hinge-Cap,
will improve your shave in three waj^s:
First, the lather is heavier and holds the
moisture in against the beard. Quicker and
more thorough softening of the beard results.
Second, the razor glides more easily through
the Williams-softened beard because Williams
lather lubricates the skin. Lastly, an ingredient
in Williams keeps the skin in good condition
no matter how heavy your beard nor how
frequently you shave. In addition, you'll enjoy
Williams because it is a pure, natural white
cream without coloring matter of any kind.
Ask for it.
