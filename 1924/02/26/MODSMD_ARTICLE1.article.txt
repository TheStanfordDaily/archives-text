# CARD-BEAR BASKETBALL GAMES TONIGHT DECIDE TWO TITLES
## Defeat Will Mean Elimination From Pacific Coast Conference, Loss of California Series 
### David Meiklejohn 
Two titles are at stake tonight when Stanford and California varsity and freshman
basketball quintets meet in Oakland Auditorium.
For Andy Kerr's varsity, the loss of tonight's game will mean elimination from the
race for the Pacific Coast Conference title.
A victory will mean a fighting chance to represent the California universities against
the northern invader.
"Husky" Hunt's freshmen play the deciding game of the annual series against the
Cubs.
Neither Cardinal team is accorded more than a fighting chance tonight. The Blue
and Gold varsity, with two wins out of three, starts against the Redshirts as a slight
favorite. The California yearlings, because of their showing against the Card babes in
the last game, also have a slight edge.
Another triple tie in the southern half of the Pacific Coast Conference is threatened tonight.
If Stanford wins, another game will have to be played on March 1 to decide the winner of the California-
Stanford series.
Considering the showing the Card five made last Saturday against the Bears it would not be stretch-

itig facts to say that Stanford has a good chance to cop in tonight's
game, despite the weakness it exhibited in the last half of the recent
fracas.
Steele Due for Comeback
Qurdori Steele, who has not had a scoring night this season, is due for a
big comeback. It would not be surprising to see the big center come through
with a majority of the points, in view of the many chances at goals which he
gets during a contest. Some of his attempts are bound to materialize when
.a series championship is at stake.
There will be a merry mess in the conference standings should the Cards
win tonight. How the affair will be straightened out in case of such an
occurrence is hard to forecast, but it is safe to say that the presentiment of
a tangle will not keep the Cardinal varsity from putting forth every effort to
give the Bruins a decisive walloping.
Nevers Closely Guarded
Ernie Nevers had some hard luck in the last game, and although many of
his attempts were fruitless because of close guarding, his floor work did

much to keep the Bears from taking
a bigger lead in the second period.
When the California varsity spends
most of the time watching one Stan
ford forward, there is always a team
mate on which the Redshirts may de
pend for chances to score. The Bruins
concentrated their defense on Nevers
and. as a result, McHose came peri
lously close to scoring enough pointy
to win the game on his own.
Kerr Drills Squad in Defense
Kerr drilled the squad in a stalling
defense last night, which bodes ill for
the Berkeley court men should Stan
ford assume the heavy lead it did in
the game Saturday.
Dave Oliva is not slated to begin at
standing guard position but may get
into the game later.
The probable line-up will be:
Stanford — California —
McHose F Talt
Nevers F Ladar
Steele C Higgins
Mcßurney G Kincaid
Shipkey G Belasco

itig facts to say that Stanford has a good chance to cop in tonight's
game, despite the weakness it exhibited in the last half of the recent
fracas.
Steele Due for Comeback
Qurdori Steele, who has not had a scoring night this season, is due for a
big comeback. It would not be surprising to see the big center come through
with a majority of the points, in view of the many chances at goals which he
gets during a contest. Some of his attempts are bound to materialize when
.a series championship is at stake.
There will be a merry mess in the conference standings should the Cards
win tonight. How the affair will be straightened out in case of such an
occurrence is hard to forecast, but it is safe to say that the presentiment of
a tangle will not keep the Cardinal varsity from putting forth every effort to
give the Bruins a decisive walloping.
Nevers Closely Guarded
Ernie Nevers had some hard luck in the last game, and although many of
his attempts were fruitless because of close guarding, his floor work did

much to keep the Bears from taking
a bigger lead in the second period.
When the California varsity spends
most of the time watching one Stan
ford forward, there is always a team
mate on which the Redshirts may de
pend for chances to score. The Bruins
concentrated their defense on Nevers
and. as a result, McHose came peri
lously close to scoring enough pointy
to win the game on his own.
Kerr Drills Squad in Defense
Kerr drilled the squad in a stalling
defense last night, which bodes ill for
the Berkeley court men should Stan
ford assume the heavy lead it did in
the game Saturday.
Dave Oliva is not slated to begin at
standing guard position but may get
into the game later.
The probable line-up will be:
Stanford — California —
McHose F Talt
Nevers F Ladar
Steele C Higgins
Mcßurney G Kincaid
Shipkey G Belasco
Two titles are at stake tonight when Stanford and California varsity and freshman
basketball quintets meet in Oakland Auditorium.
For Andy Kerr's varsity, the loss of tonight's game will mean elimination from the
race for the Pacific Coast Conference title.
A victory will mean a fighting chance to represent the California universities against
the northern invader.
"Husky" Hunt's freshmen play the deciding game of the annual series against the
Cubs.
Neither Cardinal team is accorded more than a fighting chance tonight. The Blue
and Gold varsity, with two wins out of three, starts against the Redshirts as a slight
favorite. The California yearlings, because of their showing against the Card babes in
the last game, also have a slight edge.
Another triple tie in the southern half of the Pacific Coast Conference is threatened tonight.
If Stanford wins, another game will have to be played on March 1 to decide the winner of the California-
Stanford series.
Considering the showing the Card five made last Saturday against the Bears it would not be stretch-

itig facts to say that Stanford has a good chance to cop in tonight's
game, despite the weakness it exhibited in the last half of the recent
fracas.
