# WORK ON ENLARGING OF POSTOFFICE IS STARTED
## 
### 
Under the direction of Chauncey
Keefer, University engineer, work
was begun yesterday on a twenty by
fifty-six foot addition to the campus
postoffice.
The addition is being built onto the
back of the present postoffice, and
will have a second entrance facing
west, so that the congestion will be
relieved in the lobby.
Five hundred new boxes will be
added, and the interior of the entire
building will be remodeled with mod
ern equipment. The building will then
be in accord with the other changes
which have been made on the campus.
The Trustees of the University
voted to appropriate money for the
enlarging and remodeling of the post
office, and the government will lease
the building from the University.
The Postoffice Department is
anxious to give this community the
best of postal service. Recently a new
clerk was provided so that a second
delivery window could be opened.
During the time that the office is
being rearranged, Mrs. Chester A.
Thomas, postmistress, realizes that
patrons, especially those depending on
window service, will be inconven
ienced, and it will be difficult for the
postoffice staff to work regularly. How
ever, she promises to keep mails mov
ing as promptly as possible.
Mrs. Thomas asks for co-operation
from patrons, by indicating address
clearly and specifically, for after the
building is completed there will be
greatly improved facilities and oppor
tunity for greater scope in service.
