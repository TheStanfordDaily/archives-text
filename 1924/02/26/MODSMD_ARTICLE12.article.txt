# HISTORY OF SCIENCE EXHIBIT BY BECKING SHOWN AT LIBRARY
## 
### 
An exhibit dealing with the history
of science by Lawrence Becking, as
sistant professor of Economic Biology,
is on display in the exhibit cases of the
Library this week.
The exhibit resulted from a paper
presented by Dr. Becking to the Society
for the History eif Science, an organi
zation formcU last spring by Dr. Wil
liam Ophuls and Dr. Otto Barkan of
the Stanford Medical school.
Dr. Becking's paper concerns Leeu
wenhoeck, a Dutch anatomist and
microseppist of the seventeenth cen
tury, who is called "the father of scien
tific discovery." Leeuwenhoeck was
the first to discover bacteria and his in
vestigations overthrew the theory of
"spontaneous generation," commonly
believed until this time.
The Library exhibit prepared by
Dr. Becking goes farther into the his
tory of science than his paper. One
exhibit case contains pictures and ex
planations of the discoveries of Leeu
wenhoeck alone. The other one deals
with the scientists who followed
Leeuwenhoeck up to Pasteur.
Some of the scientists mentioned in
Professor Becking's exhibit arc Lister,
who was the first to apply an antiseptic
intelligently, von Licbcg, the founder
of organic chemistry, Windier, who
presented the vitalistic theory of fer
mentation and Ncedham and Chaptal,
later scientists.
