By definitely going on record last night against high school fraternities,
the Interfraternitv Council took a step in the right direction.
It is quite evident that college and high school Greek letter societies
have little or nothing in common. I heir ideals, principles, and methods
are entirely different.
Exponents of high school fraternities have yet to advance any legiti
mate reasons for the existence of such organizations. In the first place,
they are contrarv to state law. 1 hat, alone, should be enough evidence
against them.
Certainly, the social prestige which high school (ireek letter organiza
tions offer their members, is not of sufficient importance to offset the
many disadvantages.
The writer graduated from a high school where three fraternities weie
in existence. These'three organizations caused nothing but trouble. Their
members were at the bottom of most of the horse-play which dragged the
name of the school into the newspapers in an unfavorable light. Then
public initiations were nothing short of ridiculous and lather 1 effected
upon the intelligence of the men who allowed themselves to be made the
goats of such tomfoolery nonsense.
The Stanford Interfraternity Council, in taking the lead among col
lege fraternity groups, deserves a great deal of credit. Ihe whole situa
tion has been brought to a head by recent high school boy pranks which
have been perpetrated in the name of fraternities. The legislature has
started an investigation which should go far toward eliminating the trouble.
With the law-making body, backed by public opinion, determined to
wipe out the offending groups, and with college fraternities frowning 011
them, the future of high school fraternities does not seem very bright.
