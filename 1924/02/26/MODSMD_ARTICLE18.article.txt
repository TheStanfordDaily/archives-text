# Punishment
## 
### 
Two organizations have been placed on social probation for one quar
ter for the violation of regulations.
The Men's Council, in making examples of the offenders, has done the
right thing. Neither of the organizations was guilty of a very serious vio
lation. However, too much leniency would encourage a second attempt
to "get away with" something of the sort .
One society was penalized for placing posters about-the campus in
other than the authorized places. Although it was not a member of the
offending organization who put the posters up, the blame cannot be
shifted, as any body is responsible for the disposition of posters which it
has printed.
The second organization was punished for bringing in outside enter
tainment to one of its dances. Professional entertainers cannot be en
gaged for campus functions without special permission. This ruling is a
verv sane one and should be rigidly enforced. Ihe average campus dance
is much better off without the atmosphere brought in by outside enter
tainers.

Results of the Stanford-California varsity and freshman games to be
played in Oakland Auditorium tonight will be available at the Daily Palo
Alto office.
The outcome of the freshman game, together with the half time score
of the varsity game will come in by 9 o'clock. The final score of the
varsity game will be available at 9:45.
Two telephones will be used tonight, Local 13, and Palo Alto 1074.
The work of getting out the results will be greatly speeded up, if no
calls come in before the times announced above.
