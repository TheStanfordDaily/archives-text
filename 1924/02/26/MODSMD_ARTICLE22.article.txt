That Washington's birthday speech
was too much for the prize dumb bell
of our class. This morning he came up
to the professor with a sheepish look,
eyes averted, and said in a low voice:
"Mr. Wopps, I cannot tell a lie, T, I cut
my eight o'clock."

Loyal rooter at California game—
"Kill 'em! Step on that big bozo's
neck! Uppercut 'im, the dirty long
legged bum! Jump on 'em, cripple 'em!
Well—of all the dirty tricks, did you
see that guy slap our center? Did you
ever see such an underhand trick?
Come on gang, twist their necks, never
mind that blind referee!"
