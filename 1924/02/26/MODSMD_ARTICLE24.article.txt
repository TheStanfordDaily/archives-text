The Ku Klux and Chinese are at
war again. The local Chinese laundry
men charged with operations counter
to the wishes of the torch paraders
are tearing down the clothes lines and
fleaing for the Mexican border. Why
should the citizens of Hooshish go
shirtless while hoodwinked bandits go
unpunished! A terrible crime, citizens
of Hooshish! Not satisfied with steal
ing the laundry bags from our yellow
skinner cleaners, the fiery brand order
has gone the limit, and stolen the
laundry marks! What will Hooshish
do?
