Fhony Fhun
A nigthingale once in the summer,
you know,
Was singing a song to the moon,
While a frog on the bank of the river
below
Was croaking a different tune.
The bird thought: "How much nicer
'twould be
"Ifi he'd shut up his mouth and
listen to me."
While froggy was thinking, "The chap
overhead,
My musical ear seems to vex,
With his 'jug-jug-jugging' why can't
he instead,
Like ME, sing, "breck-reckitty
quex?"
But as long, I suppose, as the sound
he enjoys,
He don't give a darn whom else he
annoys. —Epie Neezer.

Physicians of ancient China classi
fied disease under the four seasons of
the year: headaches and neuralgia in

and bronchial and pulmonary com

Three planes for use in Roald
Amundsen's projected flight from
Spitzbergen to the North Pole next
