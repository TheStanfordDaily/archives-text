# WORK PROGRESSING ON ELABORATE SETS FOR ONE-ACT PLAYS
## 
### 
Work on some of the most elaborate
sets ever attempted for the Theatrical
Workshop one-act playlets, which are
produced quarterly, is progressing
rapidly in the Assembly Hall.
Of the two plays to lie presented
Thursday evening, "Let's Pretend" in
volves the most stagecraft. Leslie
Kiler has designed a scene reflecting
the fantastic and unreal quality of the
lines in a warm medley of color.
To the fanciful quarters of Pierrot
and Pierette, Kiler has given spright
liness by the use of pastel tints of
rose, orange, and a dash of green. A
grotesque scene is revealed through
the curious windows of the ideal
lovers' apartment.
A singularly shaped hearth and dis
tinctive entrances assist in supporting
the spirit of the play and brightly
colored hangings and pillows decorate
the room. .
Lighting, which is being directed by
William Irwin, will be in sympathy
with the portent of the action. As the
play progresses the lights will vary to
correspond with the developing situa
tions. To secure this effect the most
plastic arrangements are being
planned.
In "Michael's Mother" the effort is
being made to secure realism more
than anything else. The homey kitchen
of the Shaunessy family, as designed
by Mildred Overholtzer, is compara
tively easy to represent. Crews work
ing on both sets, however, are finding
plenty to do.
Eight o'clock has been set as the
time for the curtain to rise. There will
be no admission charge.
