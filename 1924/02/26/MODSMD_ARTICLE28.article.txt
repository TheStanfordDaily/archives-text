# RULES FOR STANFORD MOVIE CONTEST ARE EXPLAINED BY GRAY
## 
### 
That the stories which students are
writing to submit for the prize being
offered by the Raymond Nichols Com
pany should be as significant as pos
sible of Stanford life at this time is
again emphasized by Dr. H. 1). Gray,
of the English department, who is in
charge of the contest. The film will
belong to the University after its
showings, and will be kept as a record
of the University life.
Gives More Information
Dr. Gray gave forth the following
information in answer to the questions
he has received from contestants:
The scenario may contain interior
scenes if no expensive lighting is in
volved. This means that facilities for
lighting must already be present, or
that the scene will occasion use of
spotlights only.
It is esential that no trick features
be introduced into the story.
It is possible to go back as far as
the war, if necessary, for the plot.
The present R. O. T. C. could be used
for those scenes.
Manuscripts must be turned in by
March 10 in order that the winner be
chosen, and the principal parts be as
signed to those students who will take
part in the picture. Work will start
during Easter vacation, and the en
semble scenes will be taken after the
student body returns to the campus.
Football scenes may be used in the
story, as films for that are available.
Scenes do not have to be confined
to the campus, if it is necessary to the
story to have other local color.
The story may be written in col
laboration by two or more students.
Dr. Gray will answer further ques
tions on this subject through the col
umns of the Daily Palo Alto.
