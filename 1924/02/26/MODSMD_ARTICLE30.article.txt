Ken Alvyard plays standing guard for the Indiana team. He's not so much
on shooting baskets, but he's a big long guy and uses his bean as well as
his size.
Howard Birks, captain of the Michigan team, has been laid up somewhat
this season and so stayed out of several games.
Gordon Campbell, of the 11. S. C. Trojans, is the boy who beat Stanford
recently by dashing in and calling for the ball when one of his opponents was
about to throw it in from the outside. The trick worked—he got the ball and
his team won the game.
Wilson is a steady guard and mainstay of the fast going Columbia quintet.
