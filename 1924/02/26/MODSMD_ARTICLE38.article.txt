# "VICTORY HIGHWAY" WILL BRIDGE DESERT
## 
### 
The Great American Desert, which
since the beginning of history has
separated East from West, is being
bridged, and Central California open
ed to the East through funds supplied
by this section of the state.
The completed highway will be
known as the Victory Highway and
is sponsored by the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce and the Utah-
Nevada-California Highway Associa
iton. Last week a check for $10,000
of California money was sent to the
State of Utah, the second payment
of a sum aggregating $35,000 already
contributed.
California money is building Utah
and Nevada roads because most of
the later states are composed of
government lands and the taxes im
posed upon them are not sufficient to
carry on the work, according to F. H.
Meyer of the San Francisco Chamber
of Commerce.
The principal reason, however, says
Meyer is that "a completed highway
over the Great American Desert will
tend to increase Central California's
population so greatly as to assure us
many times the population we now
have."
