# DELTA TAU'S MEET BETAS TOMORROW IN INTRAMURAL FINALS
## Teams Meet for Second Successive Year in Deciding Game 
### 
Delta Tau Delta and Beta Theta Pi
meet tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the pavil
ion to decide the intramural basket
ball championship.
These two teams met last year in
the finals, and the Betas won the
title. With four members of last year's
team playing again this year, they
stand a good chance of repeating their
victory.
In their game against the Phi Delts,
their only weakness was in their pass
ing. They have been practicing stead
ily the last week, and have shown
great improvement in this line.
No individual stars are numbered
on the Beta lineup. The •emphasis is
on teamwork. The men who will start
the game are: Alabaster and Tibbe,
forwards; Smith, center; and Granger
and Dole, guards. The forwards and
center form a fast offensive combina
tion, and with the guards giving their
usual strong support, the Betas should
make a strong bid for the champion
ship honors.
Delta Tau Delta will furnish no mean
competition in this contest. Five of
their men are last year's veterans.
This year Meyer has played on the
130-lb. team, and James with the 145's.
Teamwork is Delta Tau's motto,
also. In the preliminary games they
exhibited a good deal of it, coming
through the series undefeated. They
have been getting in their practice
licks this week, and promise to make
things hot for the Betas.
The Delta Tau lineup has been an
nounced as; Morrison, deßack, and
Meyer for the two forward positions;
Collett at center; and Mixon and
James at guard.
Between halves of the game, the
winners of the seven leagues will be
presented with their placques, which
have already been engraved. Each
league winner is requested to have a
representative present to receive the
trophy.
