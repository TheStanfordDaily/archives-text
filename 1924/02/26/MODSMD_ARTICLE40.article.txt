# All Y. M. C. A. Branches Represented for First Time in State Meeting
## 
### 
All branches of the Y. M. C. A. met
together for the first time in a state con
vention held at Modesto February 22-
24.
In former years city, army and navy,
student, and Hi-Y associations held
separate conventions.
Demonstrations of the work of the
different departments gave each of the
650 delegates the scope of the whole
work being done by the "Y."
D. K. Chang of Stanford spoke on
"The Racial Question as it Bears on
International Relations." Other Stan
ford delegates were Jim Sparling, as
sistant secretary of the local branch;
Dave Harris, Don Robertson, Junior
Collins, and George Stray.
Chang and the champion of the 125-
pound division at U. C. staged an exhi
bition wrestling match. The Stanford
student formerly held both 115 and
125-pound intercollegiate titles.
The Chamber of Commerce, Rotary,
Kiwanis, Lion, and Exchange Clubs of
Modesto entertained the delegates with
automobile rides, banquets, and a
theater party, in addition to bearing a
large portion of the convention ex
penses.

The trustees of Colgate University
have decided to limit the enrollment
at tire University. Intensive rather
than extensive training will be the
university motto.
