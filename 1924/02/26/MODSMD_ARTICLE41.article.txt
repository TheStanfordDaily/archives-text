# MOTORISTS PROTEST AGAINST WAR TAXES ON AUTO PRODUCTS
## 
### 
"Help abolish 191S war taxes in
1924."
This is the appeal being broad
casted to by the California
State Automobile Association. Plans
for a united protest to Congress
against the continuance of war excise
taxes on automotive products have
been perfected.
The opening gun in the campaign
was fired recently when the associa
tion entered a protest with California
congressmen against the continuation
of this tax. Now. it plans to follow up
with a monster petition to congress
signed by California automobile own
ers.
A petition demanding that congress
take immediate action to abolish the
five per cent war taxes on automobiles,
tires, accessories and parts, and three
per cent on motor trucks, was sent
yesterday to everyone of the Associa
tion's twenty-three district offices and
touring bureaus.
There will also be a copy of the
petition at the Pacific Automobile
Show in San Francisco this week.
Last year motorists of the nation
paid the government $146,000,000' in
excise taxes on new cars, tires, parts,
and accessories. This is almost twice
as much as was withdrawn from the
federal treasury to aid road building
purposes. In five years these taxes
have amounted to more than twice the
federal expenditures for roads.
While no tax is now required on
pianos, chewing gum, and soft drinks,
every purchaser of a Ford car must
pay $15.20 to the government for the
privilege of buying the car, and a
proportionately larger amount for
more expensive makes. Every time a
motorist replaces a tire on his car or
has the misfortune to break some part
he must pay five per cent of the cost
to the government.
"The war tax on rail transportation
was properly removed in 1918 and
the removal of the tax on telephone,
leased wires, and telegraph communi
cations has been recommended. There
is no longer any justification for the
retention of a tax on highway trans
portation and motorists should unite
in demanding that congress take im
mediate action to -eliminate this tax,"
D. E. Watkins, secretary and general
manager of the Automobile Associa
tion, declared recently.
