# CENSUS OF VILLAGE CATS MADE BY BABES
## 
### 
A census of the village cats has just
been completed by the freshman class
of Chowan College, a Baptist institu
tion. The taking of the feline census
was the last stunt imposed upon the
freshmen by the second-year
The freshmen discovered that there
were 170 cats in the village varying
in age from 3 months to 5 years. Fifty
two black cats answered to the name
of "Tom."

The University of Oregon juniors
had their annual "shine" day recent
ly. On that day both men and women
shine each other's shoes for the cus
tomary ten cents. The proceeds are
given to charity.
