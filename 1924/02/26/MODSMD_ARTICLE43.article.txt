# FOUR-WHEEL BRAKES AND BALLOON TIRES CAUSE AUTO CHANGES
## 
### 
General adoption of balloon tires
and four-wheel brakes has caused com
plete re-designing of a certain make
of car, according to its manufacturers.
Front axles, for instance, have been
required heretofore to resist only
slight twisting strain and have b&en
built accordingly. The addition of
four-wheel brakes has therefore caus
ed the strengthening fourfold of the
front axles.
Spring design also has required re
vision. Without the change little ad
vantage is derived from the balloon
type tires.
