# FRESHMEN PREPARED FOR CRUCIAL CONTEST
## 
### Wallace Knox 
Coach "Husky" Hunt left this after- j
noon for the Oakland auditorium with (
his freshman hoop aggregation, where
he will send his babes against the j
California freshmen for the third timei
this year in the preliminary to the j
varsity-California battle.
The Stanford team may win the I
game, notwithstanding the fact that,
odds favor California. The Babes have
been playing exceptional ball all sea
son, but in the last game with thej
Cubs met defeat. This defeat coupled )
with the fact that the Babes will have ;
to play on a strange floor away from 1
their own rooters cause dopesters to 1
pick the Blue and Cold quintet to win. j
Try Many Shots
A number of causes for the defeat i
last week can be named. The Cards
may have been stale, or it may have
been overconfidence, or what is most |
likely, it was just an off night. It has
been estimated that the freshmen took
sixty-nine tries at the hoop, while the '
Cubs only attempted twenty-three'
shots. Yet the Bruins won, 14 to 9. As I
Price and David are usually very ac- J
curate basket tossers, their inability:
to locate the net can probably be cred
ited to an off night.
It is not unusual that a team will
have two such nights in a row, and
so the Redshirt forwards should be
able to register goals on a par with!
the California players tonight. Foul-j
shooting was also poor in the last,
game, the Babes missing enough foul j
tries to win the contest.
Robie Dangerous
Robie, star California forward, will |
have to be watched. He caged two j
goals from the middle of the floor last j
week. Healy, who plays running guard.'
is another Berkeley man who will bear
attention. He is adept at carrying the
ball down the court for a score.
The Cubs showed a marked improve
ment in their team play in the second
game. If they have improved as much
since Wednesday as they did the pre
ceding week things are liable to go
hard for Stanford. Lack of teamwork j
on the part of Stanford was a cause j
of the last defeat. All things consid
ered it is about a toss-up between the
two teams, and the one getting the
lead at the start is likely to win.

The Cubs showed a marked improve
ment in their team play in the second
game. If they have improved as much
since Wednesday as they did the pre
ceding week things are liable to go
hard for Stanford. Lack of teamwork j
on the part of Stanford was a cause j
of the last defeat. All things consid
ered it is about a toss-up between the
two teams, and the one getting the
lead at the start is likely to win.
Coach "Husky" Hunt left this after- j
noon for the Oakland auditorium with (
his freshman hoop aggregation, where
he will send his babes against the j
California freshmen for the third timei
this year in the preliminary to the j
varsity-California battle.
The Stanford team may win the I
game, notwithstanding the fact that,
odds favor California. The Babes have
been playing exceptional ball all sea
son, but in the last game with thej
Cubs met defeat. This defeat coupled )
with the fact that the Babes will have ;
to play on a strange floor away from 1
their own rooters cause dopesters to 1
pick the Blue and Cold quintet to win. j
Try Many Shots
A number of causes for the defeat i
last week can be named. The Cards
may have been stale, or it may have
been overconfidence, or what is most |
likely, it was just an off night. It has
been estimated that the freshmen took
sixty-nine tries at the hoop, while the '
Cubs only attempted twenty-three'
shots. Yet the Bruins won, 14 to 9. As I
Price and David are usually very ac- J
curate basket tossers, their inability:
to locate the net can probably be cred
ited to an off night.
It is not unusual that a team will
have two such nights in a row, and
so the Redshirt forwards should be
able to register goals on a par with!
the California players tonight. Foul-j
shooting was also poor in the last,
game, the Babes missing enough foul j
tries to win the contest.
Robie Dangerous
Robie, star California forward, will |
have to be watched. He caged two j
goals from the middle of the floor last j
week. Healy, who plays running guard.'
is another Berkeley man who will bear
attention. He is adept at carrying the
ball down the court for a score.
