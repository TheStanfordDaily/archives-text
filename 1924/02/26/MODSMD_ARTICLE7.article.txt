# NEW TAX MEASURE WILL BE TOPIC OF TALK BY H. L. LUTZ
## Aspects and Significance of Mellon Proposals Are To Be Discussed 
### 
"Some aspects of the Mellon Tax
Proposals" is the subject on which
Professor Harley Leist Lutz of the
Economics department will talk at
7:30 tonight in the Assembly hall.
"It is certain that we must reduce
tax rates in order to make them ef
fective," said Professor Lutz, speak
| ing in favor of the measures from a
j financial point of view. The tax rates
are defeating their own purpose by
being too high, he thinks.
To Tell Its Significance
; In his lecture, Professor Lutz will
discuss the important points of the
tax proposals, giving arguments for
! them from their political and economic
aspects.
Proposal Is Political '
"The tax proposal is a clever politi
cal move for political purposes, and
is being thwarted only by the oppos
ing faction," he declared.
Professor Lutz is particularly well
able to talk on his subject, due to
j his previous experience in such work.
I He was economic advisor of the Joint
| Taxation Commission of the Eighty
j third Ohio General Assembly, in 1919.
, He has been editor of the Bulletin
published by the National Tax Asso
ciation, and is a member of various
! national economics associations.
Professor Lutz, previous to his com
i ing to Stanford this year, had been
; head of the Economics department at
Oberlin College since 1914, and has
been associated with the department
since 1909.
He received his A.B. at Oberlin, and
j his A.M. and Ph.D. at Harvard.

I State Tax Commission," published in
