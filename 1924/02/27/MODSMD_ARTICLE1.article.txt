# CARD FRESHMEN TAKE FIRST CUB HOOP SEMES SINCE 1917
## Jayred, Price Tear Loose With Bevy Of Scores as Yearlinys Win Crucial Contest, 27-20 
### 
"JMMELY scoring by Jayred and Price, Stanford freshmen, enabled the Cardinal
Babes to win the series from the California first year men for the first time
since 1917, in the Oakland Auditorium last night.
Jayred and Price both scored eleven points.
Both teams were tied at the end of the first half, 12 to 12.
Coach Hunt used a different offensive to advantage by playing Jayred, cen
ter, underneath the Bruin freshman goal. Jayred had opportunity to shoot
several set-up shots from this formation, while his less-aggressive teammates
were gathering headway.
It was a different Stanford team from the one which the Berkeley Babes
defeated so ingloriously last week. Every man on the squad was playing in

top form, and in the second half the<3
California team was outclassed from '
ev>ery angle of the game.
"Mocco" Newhouse, with his steady
and sometimes sensational guarding,
was the star defensive player. He di
rected the team with precision, passed
with phenomenal perfection, and kept
his head throughout the contest,
Rodie of the California freshmen
was the first man to score in the first
half.Stanford reciprocated a minute
after. Price dribbled down the court,
passed to Jayred, who took his time,
and tied the score.
The score shifted back and forth,
and for two consecutive times after
the first Stanford score, Jayred found
opportunity to reach idly up to the
basket and tally a field goal.
Price shot five points during the
half and Williams, substituting for
Jayred, converted a field goal. Cali
fornia. managed to advance regularly
through the efforts of Watson, center,
and the half ended in a tie.
The second period was all Stan
ford's. Jayred and Price who had an
opportunity to rest during the first
half found the basket with increasing
regularity. The score steadily advanced
in the Card's favor, 15 to 13, 17 to 13,
17 to 14, 19 to 14.
At this point the Bear cubs staged a
rally and managed to bring their total
to within two points of the Cardinal,
lead. But it was their last splurge; for
the Red-shirts only fought the harder
and scored oftener.
The score mounted on Jayred's field
goal, 22 to 18, David made it 24 to 19,
