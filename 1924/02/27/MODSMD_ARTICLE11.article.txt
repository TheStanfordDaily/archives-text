# EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTS BEING MADE IN X-RAYS

night and day with a s;
basement of the Physics building,
department, is conducting an exhausti
bility in wave-lengths of x-rays when
About a year ago, Professor A. H. (
Compton, of the University of Chicago,
advanced a theory which held that
when the x-ray ciime in contact with
the substance against which 1t was
being directed, it was deflected from
its normal path at a certain angle, and
in so doing lost some of its original
energy, thereby producing a longer
wave-length.
This meant that the greater the
angle of deflection, the greater the
amount of energy is lost, and a cor
respondingly longer wave-length re
sults.
The theory involves the conclusion
that the x-rays are not waves at all,

but really very minute material parti
cles; directly refutes the present idea
that light is composed of wave-lengths,
and goes back to Sir Isaac Newton,
who was the first to advance this con
ception.
Professor Ross Investigates
Professor Ross of Stanford was un
able to credit the theory advanced by
Professor Compton. and about a year
ago started experiments to test the
validity of the theory. At the same time.
Professor Rergen Davis of Columbia
University started similar experi
ments, and curiously enough thg work
of all three men checked out and tal
lied exactly, both in .theory and fact.
Hence, the theory which was backed
by Compton, Davis, and Ross seemed
practically undeniable, because all
three had conducted their experiments
separately, and all three had obtained
the same results and conclusions.
Theory Opposed
However, Professor Wm. Duane of
Harvard announced that he had con
ducted the same experiments, received
totally different results, and declared
that wave-length had nothing to do
with the angle of deflection, but de
pended entirely on the substance
against which the x-ray was directed.
Professor Duane was joined by Pro
fessor George L. Clark, also of Har
vard, and together they opposed the
theory as advanced by Compton, Davis,
and Ross.
Experiments Being Repeated
Professor Ross is now repeating the
experiments to discover any discrep
ancy which might exist. He lias pub
lished several papers within the past
year which have appeared in Science,
Proceedings of the National Academy
of Science, and the Physical Review.
The actual work consists of scatter
ing x-rays by directing them against
various substances such as copper, and
zinc, photographing the results, and
measuring the different wave-lengths
obtained under a powerful microscope.
If it is found that the wave-length
varies with the angle in which it is
reflected, it is to be assumed that Pro
fessor Ross and his colleagues have
worked out the true theory. However,
if it is found that the wave-length
varies with the substance against
which the x-ray is directed, it seems
more likely that Professor Duaue's
theory is correct.
Professor Ross has been at work for
almost a year now making these photo
graphs. It is a very slow process, and
a single plate sometimes takes over a
week to produce. Because of the deli
cacy of the apparatus in obtaining
these photographs, and its dangerous
nature, due to the very high voltage
which is required in the work, Profes
sor Ross finds it necessary to remain
almost constantly 011 duty with the
apparatus while a picture is being
made. He sleeps there at night in con
stant readiness for any emergency
which might develop.
Apparatus Interesting
The apparatus itself consists of an
x-ray tube which is confined in a
large lead-sheathed box, and which
projects its rays against a sheet of
copper set at an angle. The rays are
thus scattered, and pass through a
lens in the side of the box, which act:;
as a prism in arranging the rays.
Through this prism, the rays are pro
jected on the photographic plate from
which all computations are later made.
About 40,000 volts are constantly
passing through the tube, which ne
cessitates its being constantly cooled
by a water-circulating system. Profes
sor Ross has constructed an ingenious
safety device which automatically
shuts off the current through the tube
in case the water system should
denly become disabled. The tube alons
is valued at about $200, and unless it
is kept cooled it would burn up in a
very short time.
Professor Ross first came to Stan
ford as a student in 1903 and has re
mained here ever since. In 1910 he
was made a member of the faculty,
and recently was appointed as Asso
ciate Professor of Physics.

x-ray tube which is confined in a
large lead-sheathed box, and which
projects its rays against a sheet of
copper set at an angle. The rays are
thus scattered, and pass through a
lens in the side of the box, which act:;
as a prism in arranging the rays.
Through this prism, the rays are pro
jected on the photographic plate from
which all computations are later made.
About 40,000 volts are constantly
passing through the tube, which ne
cessitates its being constantly cooled
by a water-circulating system. Profes
sor Ross has constructed an ingenious
safety device which automatically
shuts off the current through the tube
in case the water system should
denly become disabled. The tube alons
is valued at about $200, and unless it
is kept cooled it would burn up in a
very short time.

Professor Ross of Stanford was un
able to credit the theory advanced by
Professor Compton. and about a year
ago started experiments to test the
validity of the theory. At the same time.
Professor Rergen Davis of Columbia
University started similar experi
ments, and curiously enough thg work
of all three men checked out and tal
lied exactly, both in .theory and fact.
Hence, the theory which was backed
by Compton, Davis, and Ross seemed
practically undeniable, because all
three had conducted their experiments
separately, and all three had obtained
the same results and conclusions.
Theory Opposed
However, Professor Wm. Duane of
Harvard announced that he had con
ducted the same experiments, received
totally different results, and declared
that wave-length had nothing to do
with the angle of deflection, but de
pended entirely on the substance
against which the x-ray was directed.
Professor Duane was joined by Pro
fessor George L. Clark, also of Har
vard, and together they opposed the
theory as advanced by Compton, Davis,
and Ross.
Experiments Being Repeated
Professor Ross is now repeating the
experiments to discover any discrep
ancy which might exist. He lias pub
lished several papers within the past
year which have appeared in Science,
Proceedings of the National Academy
of Science, and the Physical Review.
The actual work consists of scatter
ing x-rays by directing them against
various substances such as copper, and
zinc, photographing the results, and
measuring the different wave-lengths
obtained under a powerful microscope.
If it is found that the wave-length
varies with the angle in which it is
reflected, it is to be assumed that Pro
fessor Ross and his colleagues have
worked out the true theory. However,
if it is found that the wave-length
varies with the substance against
which the x-ray is directed, it seems
more likely that Professor Duaue's
theory is correct.
Professor Ross has been at work for
almost a year now making these photo
graphs. It is a very slow process, and
a single plate sometimes takes over a
week to produce. Because of the deli
cacy of the apparatus in obtaining
these photographs, and its dangerous
nature, due to the very high voltage
which is required in the work, Profes
sor Ross finds it necessary to remain
almost constantly 011 duty with the
apparatus while a picture is being
made. He sleeps there at night in con
stant readiness for any emergency
which might develop.

measuring the different wave-lengths
obtained under a powerful microscope.
If it is found that the wave-length
varies with the angle in which it is
reflected, it is to be assumed that Pro
fessor Ross and his colleagues have
worked out the true theory. However,
if it is found that the wave-length
varies with the substance against
which the x-ray is directed, it seems
more likely that Professor Duaue's
theory is correct.
Professor Ross has been at work for
almost a year now making these photo
graphs. It is a very slow process, and
a single plate sometimes takes over a
week to produce. Because of the deli
cacy of the apparatus in obtaining
these photographs, and its dangerous
nature, due to the very high voltage
which is required in the work, Profes
sor Ross finds it necessary to remain
almost constantly 011 duty with the
apparatus while a picture is being
made. He sleeps there at night in con
stant readiness for any emergency
which might develop.
Apparatus Interesting
The apparatus itself consists of an
x-ray tube which is confined in a
large lead-sheathed box, and which
projects its rays against a sheet of
copper set at an angle. The rays are
thus scattered, and pass through a
lens in the side of the box, which act:;
as a prism in arranging the rays.
Through this prism, the rays are pro
jected on the photographic plate from
which all computations are later made.
About 40,000 volts are constantly
passing through the tube, which ne
cessitates its being constantly cooled
by a water-circulating system. Profes
sor Ross has constructed an ingenious
safety device which automatically
shuts off the current through the tube
in case the water system should
denly become disabled. The tube alons
is valued at about $200, and unless it
is kept cooled it would burn up in a
very short time.
Professor Ross first came to Stan
ford as a student in 1903 and has re
mained here ever since. In 1910 he
was made a member of the faculty,
and recently was appointed as Asso

About a year ago, Professor A. H. (
Compton, of the University of Chicago,
advanced a theory which held that
when the x-ray ciime in contact with
the substance against which 1t was
being directed, it was deflected from
its normal path at a certain angle, and
in so doing lost some of its original
energy, thereby producing a longer
wave-length.
This meant that the greater the
angle of deflection, the greater the
amount of energy is lost, and a cor
respondingly longer wave-length re
sults.
The theory involves the conclusion
that the x-rays are not waves at all,

but really very minute material parti
cles; directly refutes the present idea
that light is composed of wave-lengths,
and goes back to Sir Isaac Newton,
who was the first to advance this con
ception.
Professor Ross Investigates
Professor Ross of Stanford was un
able to credit the theory advanced by
Professor Compton. and about a year
ago started experiments to test the
validity of the theory. At the same time.
Professor Rergen Davis of Columbia
University started similar experi
ments, and curiously enough thg work
of all three men checked out and tal
lied exactly, both in .theory and fact.
Hence, the theory which was backed
by Compton, Davis, and Ross seemed
practically undeniable, because all
three had conducted their experiments
separately, and all three had obtained
the same results and conclusions.
Theory Opposed
However, Professor Wm. Duane of
Harvard announced that he had con
ducted the same experiments, received
totally different results, and declared
that wave-length had nothing to do
with the angle of deflection, but de
pended entirely on the substance
against which the x-ray was directed.
Professor Duane was joined by Pro
fessor George L. Clark, also of Har
vard, and together they opposed the
theory as advanced by Compton, Davis,
and Ross.
Experiments Being Repeated
Professor Ross is now repeating the
experiments to discover any discrep
ancy which might exist. He lias pub
lished several papers within the past
year which have appeared in Science,
Proceedings of the National Academy
of Science, and the Physical Review.
The actual work consists of scatter
ing x-rays by directing them against
various substances such as copper, and
zinc, photographing the results, and
measuring the different wave-lengths
obtained under a powerful microscope.
If it is found that the wave-length
varies with the angle in which it is
reflected, it is to be assumed that Pro
fessor Ross and his colleagues have

if it is found that the wave-length
varies with the substance against
which the x-ray is directed, it seems
