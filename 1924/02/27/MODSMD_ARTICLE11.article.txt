About a year ago, Professor A. H. (
Compton, of the University of Chicago,
advanced a theory which held that
when the x-ray ciime in contact with
the substance against which 1t was
being directed, it was deflected from
its normal path at a certain angle, and
in so doing lost some of its original
energy, thereby producing a longer
wave-length.
This meant that the greater the
angle of deflection, the greater the
amount of energy is lost, and a cor
respondingly longer wave-length re
sults.
The theory involves the conclusion
that the x-rays are not waves at all,

that light is composed of wave-lengths,

Professor Ross of Stanford was un
able to credit the theory advanced by
Professor Compton. and about a year
ago started experiments to test the
validity of the theory. At the same time.
Professor Rergen Davis of Columbia
