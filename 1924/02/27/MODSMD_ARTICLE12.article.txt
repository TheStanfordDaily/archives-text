# STANFORD LOSES CHANCE FOR TITLE; BEARS TRIUMPH, 26-23
## California Makes Last Half Rush; Redshirts Weakened by Loss of McHose, Steele on Fouls 
### David Meiklejohn 
QALIFORNIA 26, Stanford 23.
This score doesn't tell the story of how Stanford led 12 to 9 in the first half,
assumed a six-point lead in the second period, and through the loss of two
of its best players and scorers, went to pieces, losing the California series
and all hope of a conference championship to the Bear varsity in the Oakland
Auditorium last night.
The loss of "Nip" McHose and Gurdon Steele on account of four personal
fouls early in the second half weakened the team beyond recovery, despite
the heavy lead which the Cards had acquired.
Nevers battled hopelessly against odds. Closely guarded and checked on all

> sides by the Bruin defensive, he kept
his head, and managed the substitute
team to the best of his ability. He
was so closely watched that opportuni
ties for field goals were wanting, and
the best the big Stanford forward
could do was to convert frequent fouls
on the Bear players.
Davis was calling personal fouls as
no referee has done this season. Two
California men, Ladar and Kincaid,
went the route of four personals to
the bench. Each player, on both sides,
who started at the beginning of the
game, had at least two fouls against
his name before the fracas ended.
Kerr substituted freely in the sec
ond half in an effort to' get the Card
machine back to normal. It was be
yond hope. Stanford was shooting
wildly, the substitutes were nervous,
and the offensive and defensive lacked
the coherent unity characteristic of
the varsity five.
History repeated itself, and again
the Bruin substitutes were stronger
than the Redshirt reserves.
Steele was having the best scoring
night of the season, and when he was
taken out of the game he had a total
of four points. McHose left the game
with two field goals to his credit.
In the second half Stanford kept her
lead up until five minutes before the
game ended. Kyte converted the foul
which lost McHose to Stanford and
made the score 12 to 10. Mcßurney
converted two with the score 14 to 10,
and made it 16-10.
At this point the Stanford defense
went to pieces, and California began
