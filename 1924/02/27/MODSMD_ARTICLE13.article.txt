# WAR LIBRARY PLACED IN CHARGE OF TEN MEN
## 
### 
The Hoover War library of Stanford
University, now one of the four larg
est collections of the sort in the world,
having passed the pioneer stage of
collecting, has been placed in charge
of ten directors, representing various
fit-Ids and activities which it touches.
The purpose of the change is that
its- future development may be con
ducted along plotted lines that will
make it most useful to scholars from
all parts of the world who will utilize
its resources, which are already in
many respects unequalled in any other
collection.
The directors, who have been con
firmed by the trustees of the Univer
sity, include the following: Herbert
Hoover, the founder of the library;
Rav Lyman Wilbur, president of the
University; E. D. Adams, professor
of history who has been director from
the beginning and who now becomes
chairman of the present directors; G.
T. Clark, University librarian; J. S.
Davis, director of the Food Research
Institute; H. H. Fisher, of the Stan
ford History department, who will
have charge of the American Relief
archives which constitute one of the
most valuable parts of the Hoover War
library; F. A. Golder of the History
department, who has collected large
amounts of material for it in Europe,
especially 111 Russia; R. H. Lutz, who
has been associated with Professor
Adams as director and who becomes
secretary of the present group; G. H.
Stuart, of the political science depart
ment, and H. S. Wildman, of thw eco
nomics department.
Directors selected from the Univer
sity departments have been appointed
with the idea that each of the-a will
assume general supervision of depart
ments of the library with which he
is especially familiar, in order that
the library may be made as complete
as possible in each of these fields.
They will work together to deter
mine upon the lines of general devel
opment of the library and to make it
most useful to graduate students of!
Stanford and other universities and :
to scholars in particular departments
who are using its facilities in increas
ing numbers.
The Hoover War library at present j
numbers more than 125,000 pieces, and
ranks with the Imperial War museum |
in London, the Weltkriegsbucherei at I
Stuttgart, and the Musee de Guerre at |
Paris.
Stanford has provided in its library '
building two whole floors for stack j
room, besides a large steel vault for
some particularly valuable and confi
dential material, and an adjoining
room for research workers with at
tendants and its own, library staff un
der the direction of the University
librarian.
While it has not been possible to i
catalogue the vast amount of material i
completely as it has been collected,
the books and documents have been
placed in such order on the shelves
and so recorded that it is readily avail
able for research students with the!
exception of the confidential files.
The work of gathering material was j
begun by Professor Adams immedi- ,
ately after the armistice was signed
and has been prosecuted steadily ever j
since. The work has been intensified
on the period of reconstruction all
over the world, especially in Europe.
The library contains material for stu-1
dents of the Russian revolution such
as exists nowhere else, not even in
Russia, where much of it has been
destroyed.

Stanford has provided in its library '
building two whole floors for stack j
room, besides a large steel vault for
some particularly valuable and confi
dential material, and an adjoining
room for research workers with at
tendants and its own, library staff un
der the direction of the University
librarian.
While it has not been possible to i
catalogue the vast amount of material i
completely as it has been collected,
the books and documents have been
placed in such order on the shelves
and so recorded that it is readily avail
able for research students with the!
exception of the confidential files.
The work of gathering material was j
begun by Professor Adams immedi- ,
ately after the armistice was signed
and has been prosecuted steadily ever j
since. The work has been intensified
on the period of reconstruction all
over the world, especially in Europe.
The library contains material for stu-1
dents of the Russian revolution such
as exists nowhere else, not even in
Russia, where much of it has been
destroyed.
The Hoover War library of Stanford
University, now one of the four larg
est collections of the sort in the world,
having passed the pioneer stage of
collecting, has been placed in charge
of ten directors, representing various
fit-Ids and activities which it touches.
The purpose of the change is that
its- future development may be con
ducted along plotted lines that will
make it most useful to scholars from
all parts of the world who will utilize
its resources, which are already in
many respects unequalled in any other
collection.
The directors, who have been con
firmed by the trustees of the Univer
sity, include the following: Herbert
Hoover, the founder of the library;
Rav Lyman Wilbur, president of the
University; E. D. Adams, professor
of history who has been director from
the beginning and who now becomes
chairman of the present directors; G.
T. Clark, University librarian; J. S.
Davis, director of the Food Research
Institute; H. H. Fisher, of the Stan
ford History department, who will
have charge of the American Relief
archives which constitute one of the
most valuable parts of the Hoover War
library; F. A. Golder of the History
department, who has collected large
amounts of material for it in Europe,
especially 111 Russia; R. H. Lutz, who
has been associated with Professor
Adams as director and who becomes
secretary of the present group; G. H.
Stuart, of the political science depart
ment, and H. S. Wildman, of thw eco
nomics department.
Directors selected from the Univer
sity departments have been appointed
with the idea that each of the-a will
assume general supervision of depart
ments of the library with which he
is especially familiar, in order that
the library may be made as complete
as possible in each of these fields.
They will work together to deter
mine upon the lines of general devel
opment of the library and to make it
most useful to graduate students of!
Stanford and other universities and :
to scholars in particular departments
who are using its facilities in increas
ing numbers.
