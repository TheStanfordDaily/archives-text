University, now one of the four larg
est collections of the sort in the world,
having passed the pioneer stage of
collecting, has been placed in charge

The purpose of the change is that
its- future development may be con

make it most useful to scholars from
all parts of the world who will utilize
its resources, which are already in
many respects unequalled in any other
collection.
The directors, who have been con
firmed by the trustees of the Univer
sity, include the following: Herbert
Hoover, the founder of the library;
Rav Lyman Wilbur, president of the
University; E. D. Adams, professor
of history who has been director from
the beginning and who now becomes
chairman of the present directors; G.
T. Clark, University librarian; J. S.
Davis, director of the Food Research
Institute; H. H. Fisher, of the Stan
ford History department, who will
have charge of the American Relief
archives which constitute one of the
most valuable parts of the Hoover War
library; F. A. Golder of the History
department, who has collected large
amounts of material for it in Europe,
especially 111 Russia; R. H. Lutz, who
has been associated with Professor
Adams as director and who becomes
secretary of the present group; G. H.
Stuart, of the political science depart
ment, and H. S. Wildman, of thw eco

Directors selected from the Univer
sity departments have been appointed
with the idea that each of the-a will

ments of the library with which he
is especially familiar, in order that
the library may be made as complete
