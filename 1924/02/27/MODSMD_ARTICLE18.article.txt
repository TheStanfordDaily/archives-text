# Defeat

### 
It is no disgrace to lose as the Stanford varsity basketball team did last
night. Andy Kerr's men went into that game as the under-dogs. The
first few minutes saw them get away to a fair lead. Half time saw them
clinging desperately to a three point margin.
The second half saw those red-shirts struggling valiantly to stave off
the California rally. They succeeded until the closing minutes of the
battle when the Bruins' superior reserve strength began to tell.
In the second period, the varsity was greatly weakened by the loss of
Captain Mcllose and Gurdon Steel. Both of these men were taken from
the game for four personal fouls. "Nip," one of the cleanest and hardest
fighting captains that ever wore a Cardinal basketball jersey, in his last
game for Stanford, was disqualified for the first time in his college caieer.
Steele is not a customary offender, either.
McHose, handicapped by his size, is forced to play harder than the
average player. He is not a "dirty" player. Lhe officials in last nights
game were unbiased, but very strict as is shown by the fact that four men
were disqualified on personal fouls.
With the loss of the game last night, Stanford is eliminated from the
race for the Pacifiic Coast Conference title. Ihe Cardinals lost to a good
team, one that is well worthy of representing the California universities
against the northern winner.
The best wishes of the Stanford student body, athletes, and coaches
go with the Golden Bear when he meets the northern invader. Go get
'em, California, we're strong for you.
With the close of the basketball season here, a glance back over the
record of the team, will disclose a record that is very creditable, lhe
Cards started the season with what was supposed to be a second-rate team.
They fought an uphill battle all the way. They came through their pre
liminary season without a defeat. They split even with U. S. C., one of
the strongest teams on the coast, in a four game series, and finally lost out
to the Bruins.
With due regard for the wonderful work the players have done, it
would be impossible to over-estimate the worth of Andy Kerr. "Little
Andy" has worked consistently and did wonders with a team which was
practically without reserve strength.
The Stanford student body is behind you to a man, Andy. Better luck
next time.

against the northern winner.
The best wishes of the Stanford student body, athletes, and coaches
go with the Golden Bear when he meets the northern invader. Go get
'em, California, we're strong for you.
With the close of the basketball season here, a glance back over the
record of the team, will disclose a record that is very creditable, lhe
Cards started the season with what was supposed to be a second-rate team.
They fought an uphill battle all the way. They came through their pre
liminary season without a defeat. They split even with U. S. C., one of
the strongest teams on the coast, in a four game series, and finally lost out
to the Bruins.
With due regard for the wonderful work the players have done, it
would be impossible to over-estimate the worth of Andy Kerr. "Little
Andy" has worked consistently and did wonders with a team which was
practically without reserve strength.
The Stanford student body is behind you to a man, Andy. Better luck
next time.
