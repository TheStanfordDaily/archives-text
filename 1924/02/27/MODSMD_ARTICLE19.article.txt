"Us men," remarked Bill Brogan, cocking one eye at the lake bottom
and the other at a cloudless sky, "work hard while we're working, and when
we aren't working we want to take things easy. I met a snake the other
day that claimed he took Free Reading just for pleasure, and got a kick
out of reading Stevenson and those things. Me, I read 'Treasure Island'
when I was a kid and haven't seen him since. I get a headache. What's
the use of being intellectual, anyhow?"
Certainly Bill would flinch at parading anything like "intellectuality,"
but he seems to carry the program too far by boasting a total absence of
intellect. This is only a pose, as is adequately proven by the development
of Stanford men after leaving college, but as a rule the development does
not begin until after graduation. Dallying with the classics may be dull
sport compared with discussions of basketball, Barney Google, and kin
dred topics of the day or night. However, the time comes when the 1924
varsity pales into insignificance, leaving a vacancy to be filled with more
permanent, pertinent, and potent facts. About this time the head becomes
capable of doing something beside aching.
It seems unfortunate, perhaps a bit criminal, to retard such a happy
phenomenon until too late for it to be completely effective. Until intellect
is recognized as an asset ■rather than a peculiarity Stanford will continue
to develop an edge rather than a polish.
