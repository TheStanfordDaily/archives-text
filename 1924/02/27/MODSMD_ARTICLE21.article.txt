# MARRIAGE HINT UNINTENTIONAL IN WASHINGTON PLAY POSTER
## 
### 
"Nearly all the great men have been
married; it can't have been accident,"
is the text of a poster that has been
spread over every bulletin board on
the campus at the University of Wash
ington.
It is not a hint to the men, or a
Leap Year suggestion to the women.
The quotation is the theme of the All-
University play that was given re
cently.
