with an umbrella crossing A, a crowd
ed street. B denotes rain. It is B'ing.
C, a city clerk, is crossing A from D.
(D denotes opposite direction). C, in
hurrying across from D, trips up A
and she falls under P, a street car,
which immediately stops. A gets very
wet from falling down in the B.
Question: —Does C show any con
sideration here? Is that so?
REAL PROPERTY: A deeds Black
acre to B but says "It's a rotten
swamp anyway, and I hope you get
the malaria." B enfeoffs C, reversion
to D, remainder to E if he gets malaria
too. remainder to F, remainder over
to G if he doesn't marry T, who has
been dead three years; remainder to
H, and what's left over to Z, infant
son of A, B. and C.
Question: What's left over?
AGENCY: One Smith says to one
Jones: "Drive this car down Third
street, and go like past the
soap works, the fish wharves, and the
leather tannery." Said Jones does as
directed with the exception of the
leather tannery; as a result, Smith
passes out from suffocation. Jones
was born south of Market, so is un
harmed.
Question: Does this come within
the "family automobile doctrine?"
TORTS: Aa is a telegraph oper
ator. He writes a short story for "Hot
Dog" in which he says of Bb, who is
a dog biscuit manufacturer, "Bb's dog
biscuits taste like raisin bread, and
will give the baby the heeby-jeebies
if you feed them to him." Aa sues Bb
for slander, libel, malicious use of pro
cess, false arrest and imprisonment,
and interference with trademark.
Question: Is Bb liable? Liable to
do what?
