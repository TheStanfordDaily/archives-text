# PETIT MERCHANTS CATER TO HUNGER RAVISHED ENCINA
## 
### 
"Candy! Chewing gum! Peanuts and
cigarettes!" Shades of Jack Meyers!
Encina's staid halls reverberate each
night with the shrill cries of boys
with baskets full of hunger-dispellers,
For over a month these young entre
preneurs canvassed the freshman dor
mitory, enjoying a lucrative monopoly.
The nearest competitive source of
supplieo is the Union store, a voyage
of alarming distance when one con
siders value of time and the coolness
of the evening breeze.
So long as the miniature venture
does not operate in restraint of trade
by enforcing monopoly prices, it will
flourish, as did Jack Meyers' hangout
of old. But if the little merchants ever
start charging twenty cents for
smokes, it'll be up and away to the
Union.
