# U. S. C. ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE "HIGH-BROW"
## 
### 
"Say it first" was the slogan of the
campaign for "Hello" week which was
recently observed at the University
of Southern California to aid in the
elimination of the "high-brow" from
the Trojan campus.

A jitney dance was recently given in
the Collegiate Grille at the University
of Oregon by the Alpha Phi sorority.
Cash raised from the affair was placed
in the house fund.
