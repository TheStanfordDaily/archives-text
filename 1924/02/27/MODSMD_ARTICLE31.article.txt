# NO EXAMINATIONS

Cornell Daily Sun
The faculty of Columbia University is
in process of considering a petition sub
mitted by students, asking that examina
tions, as well as compulsory attendance
for honor students be abolished, the un
dergraduates affected being enticed to
classes by the interest thereof, and ex
amined on the proficiency in the subject
only by bccasional questions in class—
when they happen to be there. Strange
to say—at least it seems strange to a
Cornellian—the Columbia faculty.is giv
ing the matter serious consideration.
Somehow, such a move appears to us
essentially illogical. If the aim is to
give the student greater freedom as to
the manner and time when he shall go
out in search of learning, permitting him,
if he so desire, to devote a week ex
clusively to one subject, cutting classes
in all others should he think it advisable,
or otherwise arranging his plan of study
as seems best to suit his particular needs
—if such is the. Columbians' desire, a
rational luit complete final examination,
testing his knowledge of the subject for
which he has registered, at the com
pletion of what is taken to be his study
of it. seems to be the only rational
method of passing upon the success or
failure of his term's work. If a student
cannot answer reasonable questions,
based upon the work of a particular
course, at its completion, what matter
that he might have answered them in
class two months before? And if he is
able to answer a reasonably complete set
of questions with a degree of accuracy
comparable with that of students who
have compiled with the faculty's con
ception of what constitutes a correct
method of study, what matter that he
did not, in fact, adopt that method him
self?
