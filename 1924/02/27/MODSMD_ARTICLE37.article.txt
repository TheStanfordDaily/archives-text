# ESTIMATE SUN'S AGE AT THREE BILLION YEARS
## 
### 
The age of the sun has been fixed
at something between two billion and
three billion years by Professor Wal
ter Nernst of Berlin, after researches
announced at a meeting of the Society
for Industrial Progress. Estimates are
based in part on the rate of decompo
sition of radio-active elements, and in
part on deductions from Einstein's
theory of relativity, concerning the
relation between mass and energy.
Early estimates set the age of the
sun as low as 10 million years, but
geologists show this was too short to
allow for the erosion and other
changes observed in the crust of the
earth, since it became solid.
