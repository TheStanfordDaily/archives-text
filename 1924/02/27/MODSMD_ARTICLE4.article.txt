# WORKSHOP PLAYLETS IN DRESS REHEARSAL
## 
### 
Dress rehearsal for the two one-act
plays which the Theatrical Workshop
class is to produce tomorrow night is
scheduled for tonight. The directors
of both casts gave their players a fair
ly light workout last night with the
intention of putting in the final in
tensive drill this evening. Both groups
are being pointed for the big per
formance at 8 o'clock tomorrow.
Aileene Burks, who is taking the
leading role, Pierrette, in "Let's Pre
tend," is recovering from a cold which
has slowed up practice for the last
few days. Director Paul Bissinger says
that she will have regained the full
use of her voice by tonight.
Miss Burks is the most experienced
member of the cast and is relied upon
by Bissinger to score heavily in to
morrow's performance.
Musical Numbers
Most of the practices lately have
been concentrating upon the musical
numbers for "Let's Pretend." Harle
quin and Columbine, played by Bert
Brouse and Mary Chaney, respective
ly, have a song and dance, and Pier
rot, Jack Dillman, is working on his
solo number written by Chester Bar
ker.
Under Katholeen Hillis and Enid
Root, the production of "Michael's
Mother" is approaching perfection
without encountering difficulty. The
Fitzgerald play lends itself to pro
duction readily and the actors have
the lines well in hand.
Michael's Mother-
Michael, Charles Parson, and Mi
chael's mother, Irene Thompson, in the
leading parts, have overcome their
inexperience, which was noticeable at
first, arid threaten to carry away the
whole show. H. M. "Jim" Clark, as
Michael's father, hurls himself into a
rage nightly which becomes more and
more convincing. His Irish brogue de
livery is smoothing out, and, as the
rehearsals go by, Clark looks more
and more like a dangerous contender
for stardom.
Ellen, played by Alice Wilbur, and
Mrs. Burke, Grace Peterson, support
the Shaunessy family well.
These plays mark the culmination
of a quarter's work in the technical
department of the theatre. The pro
duction, from the building and paint
ing of the sets to explaining the
broken properties, is entirely in the
hands of the students of the class.
It is the class' treat. There will be
no admission charge tomorrow night.

Michael, Charles Parson, and Mi
chael's mother, Irene Thompson, in the
leading parts, have overcome their
inexperience, which was noticeable at
first, arid threaten to carry away the
whole show. H. M. "Jim" Clark, as
Michael's father, hurls himself into a
rage nightly which becomes more and
more convincing. His Irish brogue de
livery is smoothing out, and, as the
rehearsals go by, Clark looks more
and more like a dangerous contender
for stardom.
Ellen, played by Alice Wilbur, and
Mrs. Burke, Grace Peterson, support
the Shaunessy family well.
These plays mark the culmination
of a quarter's work in the technical
department of the theatre. The pro
duction, from the building and paint
ing of the sets to explaining the
broken properties, is entirely in the
hands of the students of the class.
It is the class' treat. There will be
no admission charge tomorrow night.
Dress rehearsal for the two one-act
plays which the Theatrical Workshop
class is to produce tomorrow night is
scheduled for tonight. The directors
of both casts gave their players a fair
ly light workout last night with the
intention of putting in the final in
tensive drill this evening. Both groups
are being pointed for the big per
formance at 8 o'clock tomorrow.
Aileene Burks, who is taking the
leading role, Pierrette, in "Let's Pre
tend," is recovering from a cold which
has slowed up practice for the last
few days. Director Paul Bissinger says
that she will have regained the full
use of her voice by tonight.
Miss Burks is the most experienced
member of the cast and is relied upon
by Bissinger to score heavily in to
morrow's performance.
Musical Numbers
Most of the practices lately have
been concentrating upon the musical
numbers for "Let's Pretend." Harle
quin and Columbine, played by Bert
Brouse and Mary Chaney, respective
ly, have a song and dance, and Pier
rot, Jack Dillman, is working on his
solo number written by Chester Bar
ker.
Under Katholeen Hillis and Enid
Root, the production of "Michael's
Mother" is approaching perfection
without encountering difficulty. The
Fitzgerald play lends itself to pro
duction readily and the actors have
the lines well in hand.
