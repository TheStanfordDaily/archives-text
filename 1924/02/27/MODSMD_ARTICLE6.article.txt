# SENIORS DOPED TO TAKE FIRST PLACE IN IRISH MARATHON
## Tomorrow's Track Event Will Begin at 4 p.m.—Holdover Show to Be Given 
### 
The Irish Marathon will take place
at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon on
the varsity track oval. The program
will include the annual holdover show
and a number of novelty events.
The senior team has the best chance
of copping honors in the marathon.
Under the direction of Dick Mcßae, a
fast group of runners has been assem
bled which bids fair to better the
time made by the winners last year.
Nelson Van Judah, who won the medal
for best varsity time, :51 flat, last
year, is the fastest of the fourth year,
and fie will probably cover the dis
tance about the same tomorrow.
Seniors Strong
In addition to Judah the senior team
will include Mcintosh, Coverly, Mixon,
Daly, Swayne, Campbell, Hale, Sco
field, Wheat, Graves, Colgan, Cleave
land, Tarlton, Van Wyck, Allen, Gene
reaux, Woods, and Wilson. The first
eight men are varsity runners, and
will probably all do better than :54 in
their laps.
The sophomores have a number of
good runners and may give the sen
iors a close race with such men as
Gaspar, Thompson, Pastorious, Hum-
phrtes, Young, Carlsmith, Clifford.
Cypher, Hay, Kerr, Boles, Miller, and
Richardson. Richardson won the non
varsity medal last year with a time
of :51 3-5.
The juniors and freshmen do not
seem to have as good teams as the
other classes. There are a few fast 1
men in both classes, but the majority
of the 1925 and 1927 men run around
the track in more than :56.
Storey Fastest
Storey is the best of the juniors.
1-Ie is expected to cop non-varsity
speed honors, as he runs consistently j
in :50 when in form. Shermuiul made j
the best 1925 time last year with : 52 I
flat. Charles, Dole, Leistner, Thayer.;
and Bell are other outstanding juniors.
Speed in the 440 is undiscovered in
the 1927 team. Richmann, Babcock,
Adams, McDougal, and Spencer are
about the fastest in the class.
The team winning the marathon will !
be given ten points to count towards !
the interclass track meet next week.
Medals will be given the men who
make the best varsity and non-varsity
time. It is probable that prizes of
some sort will be secured for the win
ners of the novelty races. The mara
thon is under the direction of the
Quadrangle club and the proceeds will
go to the Trophy room.
The show given by the holdovers
was not written yesterday. However, j
its authors state that it will be in the;
hands of A1 Masters in plenty of time
for the show tomorrow. As the actors
read their lines there is no need for
extensive preparation.
