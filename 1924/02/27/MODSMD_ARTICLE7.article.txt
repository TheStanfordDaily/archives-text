# VARSITY-FRESHMAN WATER POLO TEAMS PLAY BEARS FRIDAY
## 
### 
Results of the Stanford-California
varsity water polo game Friday after
noon in Encina pool will give the first
dope 011 the strength of the Card
seven.
California's team, which lost to
Stanford last year by a score of 7 to 4,
is just as strong, if not stronger, than
it was a year ago.
The Stanford seven is purported to
bp much better than last season's
squad. The forwards of the Stanford
team are particularly strong. The
three berths are held down by Fletch
er, Meyers, and O'Connor. McCallister,
Sclimeider, and Allen are the varsity
backs, and Collett will play goal.
Coach "Ernie" Brandsten is a firm
l>eliever in the effectiveness of team
work. In the last Olympic games, the
American team, composed of individu
al stars, lost higher honors because
they had not played together long
enough to develop teamwork.
The Blue and Gold outfit has in its
line-up three of the best water polo
players # on the Coast. These men will
play on the Olympic Club team against
Stanford on March 8.
The Bruin seven is strong enough to
push the Cards to the limit to win.
The freshman team is strong, and
should win easily from the Cubs. The
Babe line-up is Stewart, Brooks, and
Fletcher, forwards; Sibbett, Graham,
and Herth, backs; Hinkle or Paulson,
goal.
