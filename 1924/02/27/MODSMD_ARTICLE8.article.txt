# COPY FOR COLLEGE WITS CONTEST DUE WITHIN SEVEN DAYS
## 
### 
Chappie sawed a hole through the
floor to call down that there are just
seven more days to the close of the
College Wits Contest â€”now set as
March 5. On that date the Old Boy
will lug down to the postoffice Stan
ford's bid for Judge's w.k., jf., and c.
cup.
Last year Chappie scuttled down
the home stretch just 262 points ahead
of its nearest competitor, the Colum
bia Jester. This year, according to the
sad shakings of heads seen in the
Chaparral office, he is going to need
a whole mess more of contributions
than now grace the editorial sanctum.
