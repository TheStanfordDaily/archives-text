# MELLON TAX PROPOSAL HAS POLITICAL REASON
## H. L. Lutz Favors Measure, But Is Doubtful About Income Distinctions 
### 
"It was a master stroke to cut both
the surtax rates and taxes on earned
incomes. The Mellon tax proposal was
introduced at the strategic moment
for the administration in power," said
Frofessor Harley L. Lutz of the Eco
nomics department, last night in his
talk on some of the important, aspects
of the Mellon tax proposals.
"The opposition is discrediting the
bill 011 account of the coming elec
tions which will be greatly influenced
by the successful outcome of the pro
posal," said Professor Lutz in discus
sing the political aspect of the ques
tion.
Distinctions Between Incomes
After giving a summary of the fea
tures of the proposal, Professor Lutz
told details of the plans relating to
income taxes, consisting of the cutting
of surtaxes, with distinction between
earned and unearned incomes.
Differences between earned and un
earned incomes will bring up difficult
problems, according to Professor Lutz,
who, however, favors the reduction of
tax rates, which are included in the
proposal.
In giving arguments for the pro
posal, from the fiscal or treasury point
of view, Lutz said, "It is directed
against excessive surtax rates, and
will lower income taxes in general."
Lutz quoted the economist, John
Stuart Mills, who said that no tax
should be so high that it furnishes
incentives for evasion.
Present methods of taxation have
forced people to take refuge in tax
exempt securities, and so the revenue
from income taxes has decreased in
spite of the fact that incomes have
grown larger.
Reduction Unusual
The unique situation of planning re
duction of taxes at a time when there
is a surplus in the treasury is to be
commended, according to Professor
Lutz, who told of the various ways in
which money had been squandered
under the same circumstances in the
past.
The economic argument in favor of
the proposals were given by Professor
Lutz, in the fact that the plans will
adjust the weight of taxation, and
equalize the distribution of wealth.
Among the minor issues, Professor
Lutz advocated measures contrary to
those in the bill. He thinks it advisable
to retain the tax on theatre tickets,
which in 1923 brought in a revenue of
$70,000,000, and taking off the tax on
club memberships, which in the same
year brought in only $7,000,000.
