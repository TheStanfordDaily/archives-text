Stiegelers —Tailors
to College Men —and Others
For many years this establishment has
catered to the exacting requirements of col
lege men. And because we know that every
student's suit we make is an animated adver
tisement for us, we have always taken par
ticular pains to give just a little more than
full money's worth.
This applies too, to evening clothes, overcoats,
and sport clothes—there's distinction in every
garment *we prodwx.
