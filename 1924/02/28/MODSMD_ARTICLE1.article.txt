# CARDINAL NINE DROPS GAME TO TAILORS, 7 TO 2
## Varsity Loses to Oakland Outfit After Winning First Nine Starts 
### 
Six runs, which resulted from the
Ambrose Tailors' batting carnival in
the first inning of the game yesterday
afternoon, proved too big a handicap
for the Cards to overcome and the
Oakland visitors won 7-2. This first
defeat of the season, coming after nine
straight victories, was handed the
varsity by a team composed of eight
regular Coast Leaguers and a ninth
man who tries out with Seattle this
season.
The tailors opened the California
season this year. In the first game
against the Blue and Gold, Ambrose's
men won 9-0. None of the pitchers
showed up for the second game, and
with the Oakland shortstop, Maderas,
in the box, the Berkeley outfit was
whipped the second time 3-2.
Teague Gets Bad Start
Teague got away to a bad start by
hitting Maderas, first man up. Viver
ous, batting next, hit a single which
lie stretched to three on Johnston's
error, scoring Maderas. Marriot sing
led and Viverous came home. Hafey,
who came to bat next, was also hit by
Teague's delivery and went to second
on Bankhead's single. Apperson struck
out next for the first out of the game.
With Marriot, Hafey, and Bank
liead on the bags, Teague walked Fen
ton, scoring Marriot. At this point
Loewenstein went in to pitch. Koehler
made first on Mulcliay's error and
Hafey brought in the fourth run.
When Plummer singled, Bankhead
scored and Fenton came in as Cudde
back fizzled Maderas* fly. The next
man flied out and a Roberts-to-Wood
ward put-out stopped the slaughter.
Stanford started in the third to re
trieve some of the loss. Woodward
was hit by Plummer's pitch and stole
the score at six all with a free throw.
With seven minutes yet to go, the
teams tightened, keeping the play in
the middle of the floor. Morrison of
Delta Tau finally broke the tie, cag
-1 ing a goal after one of his teammates
i had missed a free throw.
Score Close .
De√üach raised Delta Tau's lead to
four points by a well-placed shot.
Smith of the Betas broke through for
a goal, and prospects loomed for a
second tie. However, Collett, after
dribbling the length of the floor, found
the cage, raising Delta Tau's lead
again to four points. This was re
duced to two points .when Smith sank
two free throws for the Betas. The
latter were unable to break away for
another tally, and Delta Tau won,
12-10.
For the winners, Morrison caged two
field goals, Meyer, Collett, and de
Bach each made one. Mixon and James
at the guard positions showed up well.
Alabaster found the hoop twice for
the Betas. Smith tallied the Betas'
only other field goal.
