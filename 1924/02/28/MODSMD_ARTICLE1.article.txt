# CARDINAL NINE DROPS GAME TO TAILORS, 7 TO 2
## Varsity Loses to Oakland Outfit After Winning First Nine Starts 
### 
Six runs, which resulted from the
Ambrose Tailors' batting carnival in
the first inning of the game yesterday
afternoon, proved too big a handicap
for the Cards to overcome and the
Oakland visitors won 7-2. This first
defeat of the season, coming after nine
straight victories, was handed the

whipped the second time 3-2.

who came to bat next, was also hit by
Teague's delivery and went to second
on Bankhead's single. Apperson struck
out next for the first out of the game.
With Marriot, Hafey, and Bank
liead on the bags, Teague walked Fen
ton, scoring Marriot. At this point
Loewenstein went in to pitch. Koehler
made first on Mulcliay's error and
Hafey brought in the fourth run.
When Plummer singled, Bankhead
scored and Fenton came in as Cudde
back fizzled Maderas* fly. The next
man flied out and a Roberts-to-Wood
ward put-out stopped the slaughter.
Stanford started in the third to re
trieve some of the loss. Woodward
was hit by Plummer's pitch and stole
