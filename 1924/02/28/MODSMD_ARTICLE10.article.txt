# DELTA TAU DEFEATS BETA THETA PI IN BASKETBALL FINAL
## Intramural Banner Goes to Delts When They Trim 1923 Winners, 12-10 
### 
Delta Tau Delta disproved the adage
that history repeats itself, by defeat
ing Beta Theta Pi in the finals of the
intramural basketball championship
last night in the pavilion.
Last year, when the same two teams
met for the title, the Betas emerged
victorious by the score of 11-7. With
the Betas using four veterans and
Delta Tau five, almost the same line
ups have faced each other in the two
years.
Game Is Rough
Excessive roughness marred the
game. Alabaster, of the Betas, was
knocked out during a scrimmage. Mor
rison of Delta Tau emerged from an
other fracas minus two front teeth.
Sixteen personals were called during
the game, eight on each team.
Unusually strong defense marked
the play of both sides. For the most
part, guarding was close. Seldom was
a mun able to break away for a try
at goal.
Delta Tau Scores First
The game started with both teams
fighting for a lead. Delta Tau tallied
first, when James and Mixon scored
on free throws. After five minutes of
play, Meyer shot Delta Tail's first field
goal. Morrison followed with another,
making the score 6-0 in favor of Delta
Tau.
A few minutes later Granger made
the first point for the Betas on a free
throw. The Betas took the offensive,
and Alabaster caged a field goal. Be
fore the whistle sounded the end of
the period, the Betas had several more
tries at the hoop, but Delta Tau's
close guarding forced them to shoot
so quickly that none of the attempts
succeeded, the half ending in favor
of Delta Tau, 6-3.
Betas Take Offensive
The Betas again assumed the of
fensive at the opening of the second
period, but were unable to connect
with the basket until Alabaster drop
ped in a field goal. Then Tibbe tied
second. Mulchay got him to third on
a single and there they waited while
Loewenstein struck out. Roberts was
up next and was out at first on field
er's choice while Woodward came
home and Mulchay went to second.
Cuddeback leaned on it for a two
bagger next, scoring Mulchay. The side
retired with Johnston out at first.
With this inning the scoring was
over, saving only the run made by the
Tailors in the seventh.
During the last few innings, Coach
Harry Wolter had Ernie Nevers warm
ing up along the sidelines. Nevers was
out for the first time since the basket
ball season closed, and for a time it
looked as though he might get a
chance to pitch.
Herb Manauk, who has been com
ing to the Farm with Cliff Ireland for
several seasons, was calling them
from behind the box instead of de
livering, yesterday.
The score by innings follows:

Stanford . 0020 0 0 0 0 o—2 3 5
Tailors 6000 0 0 1 0 o—7 13 0

ups have faced each other in the two
years.
Game Is Rough
Excessive roughness marred the
game. Alabaster, of the Betas, was
knocked out during a scrimmage. Mor
rison of Delta Tau emerged from an
other fracas minus two front teeth.
Sixteen personals were called during
the game, eight on each team.
Unusually strong defense marked
the play of both sides. For the most
part, guarding was close. Seldom was
a mun able to break away for a try
at goal.
Delta Tau Scores First
The game started with both teams
fighting for a lead. Delta Tau tallied
first, when James and Mixon scored
on free throws. After five minutes of
play, Meyer shot Delta Tail's first field
goal. Morrison followed with another,
making the score 6-0 in favor of Delta
Tau.
A few minutes later Granger made
the first point for the Betas on a free
throw. The Betas took the offensive,
and Alabaster caged a field goal. Be
fore the whistle sounded the end of
the period, the Betas had several more
tries at the hoop, but Delta Tau's
close guarding forced them to shoot
so quickly that none of the attempts
succeeded, the half ending in favor
of Delta Tau, 6-3.
Betas Take Offensive
The Betas again assumed the of
fensive at the opening of the second
period, but were unable to connect
with the basket until Alabaster drop
ped in a field goal. Then Tibbe tied
second. Mulchay got him to third on
a single and there they waited while
Loewenstein struck out. Roberts was
up next and was out at first on field
er's choice while Woodward came
home and Mulchay went to second.
Cuddeback leaned on it for a two
bagger next, scoring Mulchay. The side
retired with Johnston out at first.
With this inning the scoring was
over, saving only the run made by the
Tailors in the seventh.
During the last few innings, Coach
Harry Wolter had Ernie Nevers warm
ing up along the sidelines. Nevers was
out for the first time since the basket
ball season closed, and for a time it
looked as though he might get a
chance to pitch.
Herb Manauk, who has been com
ing to the Farm with Cliff Ireland for
several seasons, was calling them
from behind the box instead of de
livering, yesterday.
The score by innings follows:
R. H. E.
Stanford . 0020 0 0 0 0 o—2 3 5
Tailors 6000 0 0 1 0 o—7 13 0
The batteries: Stanford —Teugue,
Loewenstein. and Lawson. Ambrose
Tailors —Plummer, Hammond, and
Koehler.
Delta Tau Delta disproved the adage
that history repeats itself, by defeat
ing Beta Theta Pi in the finals of the
intramural basketball championship
last night in the pavilion.
Last year, when the same two teams
met for the title, the Betas emerged
victorious by the score of 11-7. With
the Betas using four veterans and
Delta Tau five, almost the same line
ups have faced each other in the two
years.
