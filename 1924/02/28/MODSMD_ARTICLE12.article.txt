### Esther Greenacre 
IS a result of a $25,000 wager made by Senator Stanford, the first motion
** pictures were invented on the Stanford estate in 1877.
The invention owes its origin to an experiment in instantaneous photography
made to probe that a horse has all of its feet off the ground at intervals when
trotting. The Senator had a firm conviction that the conventional manner in
which artists depicted the relative po-$

sitions of the feet of horses in rapid
motion was erroneous.
His theory was opposed by James
R. Keene, famous horse runner, and
a wager of $25,000 was made between
the two horse lovers to the effect that
Electioneer, the Senator's trotting
stallion, had all four feet off the
ground at periods when in action.
Electioneer was Senator Stanford's
prize member of a long string of
thoroughbred horses and is now known
as the world's greatest producer of
equine speed.
Edward Muybridge, a San Francisco
photographer, was engaged to perform
the experiment. Senator Stanford is
also said to have consulted John D.

i Isaacs, who held the position of con
sulting engineer on the Southern Pa
cific system until last year when he
resigned after fifty years of service.
At this point converse statements
are found as to the inventor of the
moving pictures, available records
being unable to prove whether the
plan of setting up battery cameras to
take a succession of pictures of Elec
tioneer was the idea of Muybridge.
the photographer, or Isaacs, the en
gineer. Although the invention of the
motion pictures is usuull.v credited to
Thomas Edison, it is said to actually
| belong to either Muybridge or Isaacs.
