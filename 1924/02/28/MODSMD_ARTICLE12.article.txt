# FIRST MOVING PICTURES MADE ON CAMPUS FARM
## 
### Esther Greenacre 
IS a result of a $25,000 wager made by Senator Stanford, the first motion
** pictures were invented on the Stanford estate in 1877.
The invention owes its origin to an experiment in instantaneous photography
made to probe that a horse has all of its feet off the ground at intervals when
trotting. The Senator had a firm conviction that the conventional manner in
which artists depicted the relative po-$

sitions of the feet of horses in rapid
motion was erroneous.
His theory was opposed by James
R. Keene, famous horse runner, and
a wager of $25,000 was made between
the two horse lovers to the effect that
Electioneer, the Senator's trotting
stallion, had all four feet off the
ground at periods when in action.
Electioneer was Senator Stanford's
prize member of a long string of
thoroughbred horses and is now known
as the world's greatest producer of
equine speed.
Edward Muybridge, a San Francisco
photographer, was engaged to perform
the experiment. Senator Stanford is
also said to have consulted John D.

i Isaacs, who held the position of con
sulting engineer on the Southern Pa
cific system until last year when he
resigned after fifty years of service.
At this point converse statements
are found as to the inventor of the
moving pictures, available records
being unable to prove whether the
plan of setting up battery cameras to
take a succession of pictures of Elec
tioneer was the idea of Muybridge.
the photographer, or Isaacs, the en
gineer. Although the invention of the
motion pictures is usuull.v credited to
Thomas Edison, it is said to actually
| belong to either Muybridge or Isaacs.
Complicated and costly apparatus
was used to perform the experiment,
the entire equipment valuing about
$12,000. A shed was erected at the
side of the race track, and twenty-four
cameras were set up in a row in the
shed. A baseboard, which was twelve
inches high and on which were drawn
longitudinal lines four Inches apart,
was set up in front of the shed. In
front of the baseboard a strip of wood
was fastened to the ground. Wires
were strung across the baseboard from
the top of this strip of wood to the
other side of the track.
Each wire that crossed the track
was depressed when the wheel of the
sulky went over it and then drew upon
a spring connected with it, making a
contact with a metallic button. The
depression of the metallic button com
pleted an electric circuit with a mag
net conected with the corresponding
camera to move its latch and to liber
ate the shutters for an infinitesimal
part of a second.
Pictures Prove Theory
The weight of the sulky drawn by
Electioneer completed the circuit in
front of each camera, snapping off a
series of pictures in passing. Thus the
house was photographed in every po
sition. The series of pictures satisfied
Keene and laid tlte foundation for the
development of the moving picture
industry.
Having started the experiment, Sen
ator Stanford decided to continue it,
and pictures of athletes running,
wrestling, and boxing were taken in
addition to pictures of various kinds
of animals. Dogs, foxes, deer, cows,
goats, and even boars performed in
the experiment, the results of the pic
tures being contained in a large book
of plates now exhibited in the Stan
ford museum.
Trial Excites Ridicule
Newspapers all over the country re
produced the pictures of Electioneer
and many artists, in defense of the
conventional conception of the posi
tions taken by speeding animals, de
clared the pictures to be a hoax and
not. true to life. Ridicule of Senator
Stanford and his performance was
heard on every side.
The first American artist to cham
pion (lie pictures was Frederick Rem
ington. He studied the photographs
of Isaac and Muybridge and then
painted the striking horse pictures

which made him famous. There is now
no longer any doubt as to the authen
ticity of Senator Stanford's theory.
A study of the photographs enabled
Senator Stanford to determine meth
ods of increasing the speed of his
racers. By adding small weights to
the feet of his racers, the horseman
was able to so noticeably increase the
speed of his animals, that he found it
difficult to enter them in Eastern
matches.

Complicated and costly apparatus
was used to perform the experiment,
the entire equipment valuing about
$12,000. A shed was erected at the
side of the race track, and twenty-four
cameras were set up in a row in the
shed. A baseboard, which was twelve
inches high and on which were drawn
longitudinal lines four Inches apart,
was set up in front of the shed. In
front of the baseboard a strip of wood
was fastened to the ground. Wires
were strung across the baseboard from
the top of this strip of wood to the
other side of the track.
Each wire that crossed the track
was depressed when the wheel of the
sulky went over it and then drew upon
a spring connected with it, making a
contact with a metallic button. The
depression of the metallic button com
pleted an electric circuit with a mag
net conected with the corresponding
camera to move its latch and to liber
ate the shutters for an infinitesimal
part of a second.
Pictures Prove Theory
The weight of the sulky drawn by
Electioneer completed the circuit in
front of each camera, snapping off a
series of pictures in passing. Thus the
house was photographed in every po
sition. The series of pictures satisfied
Keene and laid tlte foundation for the
development of the moving picture
industry.
Having started the experiment, Sen
ator Stanford decided to continue it,
and pictures of athletes running,
wrestling, and boxing were taken in
addition to pictures of various kinds
of animals. Dogs, foxes, deer, cows,
goats, and even boars performed in
the experiment, the results of the pic
tures being contained in a large book
of plates now exhibited in the Stan
ford museum.
Trial Excites Ridicule
Newspapers all over the country re
produced the pictures of Electioneer
and many artists, in defense of the
conventional conception of the posi
tions taken by speeding animals, de
clared the pictures to be a hoax and
not. true to life. Ridicule of Senator
Stanford and his performance was
heard on every side.
The first American artist to cham

of Isaac and Muybridge and then
painted the striking horse pictures

which made him famous. There is now
no longer any doubt as to the authen

A study of the photographs enabled
Senator Stanford to determine meth
ods of increasing the speed of his
racers. By adding small weights to
the feet of his racers, the horseman
was able to so noticeably increase the
speed of his animals, that he found it
difficult to enter them in Eastern

tioneer was the idea of Muybridge.
the photographer, or Isaacs, the en
gineer. Although the invention of the
motion pictures is usuull.v credited to
Thomas Edison, it is said to actually
| belong to either Muybridge or Isaacs.
Complicated and costly apparatus
was used to perform the experiment,
the entire equipment valuing about
$12,000. A shed was erected at the
side of the race track, and twenty-four
cameras were set up in a row in the
shed. A baseboard, which was twelve
inches high and on which were drawn
longitudinal lines four Inches apart,
was set up in front of the shed. In
front of the baseboard a strip of wood
was fastened to the ground. Wires
were strung across the baseboard from
the top of this strip of wood to the
other side of the track.
Each wire that crossed the track
was depressed when the wheel of the
sulky went over it and then drew upon
a spring connected with it, making a
contact with a metallic button. The
depression of the metallic button com
pleted an electric circuit with a mag
net conected with the corresponding
camera to move its latch and to liber
ate the shutters for an infinitesimal
part of a second.
Pictures Prove Theory
The weight of the sulky drawn by
Electioneer completed the circuit in
front of each camera, snapping off a
series of pictures in passing. Thus the
house was photographed in every po
sition. The series of pictures satisfied
Keene and laid tlte foundation for the
development of the moving picture
industry.
Having started the experiment, Sen
ator Stanford decided to continue it,
and pictures of athletes running,
wrestling, and boxing were taken in
addition to pictures of various kinds
of animals. Dogs, foxes, deer, cows,
goats, and even boars performed in
the experiment, the results of the pic
tures being contained in a large book
of plates now exhibited in the Stan
ford museum.
Trial Excites Ridicule
Newspapers all over the country re
produced the pictures of Electioneer
and many artists, in defense of the
conventional conception of the posi
tions taken by speeding animals, de
clared the pictures to be a hoax and
not. true to life. Ridicule of Senator
Stanford and his performance was
heard on every side.
The first American artist to cham
pion (lie pictures was Frederick Rem
ington. He studied the photographs
of Isaac and Muybridge and then
painted the striking horse pictures

which made him famous. There is now
no longer any doubt as to the authen
ticity of Senator Stanford's theory.
A study of the photographs enabled
Senator Stanford to determine meth
ods of increasing the speed of his
racers. By adding small weights to
the feet of his racers, the horseman
was able to so noticeably increase the
speed of his animals, that he found it
difficult to enter them in Eastern
matches.

There are (518 universities, colleges,
