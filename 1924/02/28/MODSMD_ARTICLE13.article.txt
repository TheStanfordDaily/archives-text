# Mystery Dance To Be Given Saturday Night In Clubhouse
## 
### 
"Dance with her" Saturday night,
March 1, at the Women's Clubhouse
from 9 to 12 o'clock (if she's the kind
of a girl who gets ready on time â€”
otherwise from ? to 12) is the advice
being broadcasted by posters on the
campus. Unlike most reports being
circulated around here, this one is
absolutely true. There will be a dance,!
Witmer's orchestra will play, and the
sum of one dollar will gain the de
sired admission.
The dance is being sponsored by
some organization, name unknown to
us, but those consumed by curiosity
can look the date up in the Executive
Committee Date Book in the A, S.
S. U. office and find out. Roughs are
advised to bring along screw drivers
to pry the windows open unless they
desire to flatten their noses on the
panes.
