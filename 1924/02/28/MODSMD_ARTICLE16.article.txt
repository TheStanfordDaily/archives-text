### 
\ arsity and freshman water polo
J teams will meet California tomorrow
| afternoon at 4:30 in Encina pool.
Mitchell, Herrington and O'Brien
of California form a nucleus which can
make any team a danger; and supported
l>y team-mates who are veterans the
Bears will present a formidable aggre
gation. I'rom the Blue and Gold team
of last year, which Stanford defeated
7 to 4, only two men, Julian and Car
j son have not returned, and their berths
, have been suitably filled.
The California line-up is Mitchell,
; Herrington, and O'Brien, forwards;
| Rau and Sackett, backfield; Hess, goal',
j -Varsity Composed of Veterans.
The Stanford team, meeting the in
, vaders from across the bay, will like
wise be composed of veterans. With
j the exception of Allen, who was the
j star of last year's freshman team, it is
the same outfit that placed second in
the National Championships at Chicago
last year, where Collett was the sensa
tion of the meet. He is considered one
of the best goal keepers in the United
States.
Coach "Ernie"' Brandsten says that
the team has no weak links. The line
up is: O'Connor, Myers, and Fletcher,
forwards; McCallister, Allen and
Schmieder. brickfield; Collett, goal.
The Bear team is strong, but the
Cardinal team is without doubt a better
team than that of last year. The men
are in good condition, and have been
out every night since January 6, and
Coach Brandsten says, "If they can't
play water polo now, they never will."
Stanford has the psycological ad
vantage in that a water polo team wear
ing the Cardinal has never been downed
by the Gold and Blue.
The result of the game will be a good
indication of Stanford's possibilities
With the Olympic club on March 8,
when the varsity plays the club team
for the $2000 pnrse to pay the expenses
of the winning team to the National
championships at Chicago. Mitchell,
Herrington and O'Brien, California
stars, and three of the best water po
loists on the coast, will all play for the
Olympic club on that date.
But little is known of the California
freshman team, and Coach Brandsten
believes that the Babes will have little
difficulty in downing the Bear yearlings.
The Stanford freshman line-up is:
Stewart, Fletcher, Brooks, forwards;
Sibbett, Graham and Herth, backfield;
Hinkle, goal.
Women are invited to the meet to
morrow, where a section in the bleach
ers will be reserved for them. General
admission to the game is fifty cents;
students with cards, twenty-five cents.
