# Y. W. C. A. Organizes Night Classes for Chinese Help
## 
### 
English classcs for the Chinese help
on the campus are being organized by
the Y. W. C. A., since it is too difficult
for the cooks and second boys to get
into night classcs in Palo Alto after
working hours.
Helen Knight, Mabel McKibbin,
Helen House, Helen Friebel, Beatrice
Lee and Maxinc Sollars will act as
teachers. Classes arc to be held in the
Women's Clubhouse Monday, Tues
day, Wednesday and Thursday nights.
