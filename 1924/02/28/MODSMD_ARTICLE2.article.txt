# WORKSHOP CLASS TO GIVE PLAYS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Gordon Davis' Theater Workshop
class will present two sketches written
by Dr. Henry D. Gray's playwriting
group at 8 o'clock tonight in the as
sembly hall. No admission will be
charged.
Coaeh Davis emphasizes the neces
sity of the audience being on time. 8
o'clock sharp, in order that the first
act, which is rather difficult to pre
sent, may not be interrupted.
"Let's Pretend." a fantastic Pierrot-
Pierrette act, will open the program. It
is written by Schorl Levy and the cast
has been directed by Paul Bissinger.
Following this will be R. B. Fitzgerald's
"Michael's Mother," presented under
the direction of Katholeen Ilillis and
Enid Root.
Aileenc Burks, who has appeared in
several important parts during the col
lege year, is to play Pierrette. Pierrot
will be acted by Jack Dillman. Harle
quin and Columbine are parts which
will be taken by Bert Brouse and Mary
Chanev.
Rehearsal Good.
Leslie Kiler's set was assembled for
the first time last night at dress re
hearsal and under the influence of the
surroundings, the cast had a good prac
tice.
Under William Irwin's lights, the
costumes and scenery contrast well for
pictorial effects and a fanciful impres
sion of unreality lends itself to the
stage.
Entirely different from "Let's Pre
tend" is "Michael's Mother," the sec
ond sketch to be produced tonight.
After the 'romantic poetry of Levy's
playlet, the audience will have an act
of the most realistic drama.
Irene Thompson has the title role.
Throughout the entire performance she
is the center of the action. The story
concerns her loyalty to her son Mi<*hael,
played by Charles Parson. Michael
shatter.- his parents' ambition to see
him a priest by falling in love.
The kitchen in which the playct takes
place was designed by Mildred Over
holtzer and executed by Richard Fried
hinder, stage manager.
