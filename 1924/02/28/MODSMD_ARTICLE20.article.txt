"Block circle 'S's' shall be awarded to members of any weight team
which distinguishes itself, providing the conditions are such that Executive
Committee deems it advisable to make such an award to each team."
Such is the ruling in force at Stanford in regard to awards for weight
teams. This rule will l)e put to a severe test this year. Last season, both
UO and 145 pound basketball teams were victorious over their California
opponents. There is scant doubt that both "distinguished themselves. '
This year, neither team won a single game from their Blue and Gold
adversaries. It will be interesting'to note in what way the Executive Com
mittee interprets the existing rule. The whole situation hinges on the in
terpretation of that phrase, "distinguishes itself."
Certainly, if that expression implies the necessity for a victory over
California, neither the 130's nor 145's will get letters this year. If such
is not the meaning, what must a weight team do to distinguish itself?
The entire rule is wrong, is worded poorly, and can cause nothing but
trouble. In the first place, why should it be necessary for a team to dis
tinguish itself in order that its members be granted their awards? The
fact that they play on the team indicates that they are the best in their
class and as such are entitled to some reward. Members of a weight team
will encounter just as many difficulties and will strive just as hard to
make a good showing as varsity players.
The second great objection to the present rule is that a block circle
"S" does not seem the logical award for a weight team. Ihe letter should
be of some kind different from that awarded to varsity teams. In addi
tion, the designation of the team, such as 130 or 145 should appear at the
bottom or across the face of the letter.
Such a distinction seems only fair and just. - With a different kind of
award such as suggested above, it would not be necessary for the light
weights to win games to receive their letters. '1 hey could go out on the
same basis as any other team to put their best into the sport, with the
knowledge that their efforts would be rewarded whether or not they dis
tinguished themselves."
