# Rooting

"Nice work, this inning," came a derisive call from a student rootei,
yesterday afternoon when the varsity baseball players trotted out on the
field after failing to score when they had a chance.
That certainly is a fine spiritâ€”the kind that will make athletes hi ace
up and put everything they have into the game to do better the next time.
It is the same kind of spirit that prompted the California rooters to rise
up and boo in unison at the basketball game Tuesday night.
University student bodies are to be pitied because, among their mem
bers, are some that have no sense of fairness or decency. The average
college student looks with scorn on such an attitude. Why not squelch
the over-grown high school boy who so far forgets himself as to pop off
in such a ridiculous way. He not only makes a fool of himself, but he is a
disgrace to his Alma Mater.
