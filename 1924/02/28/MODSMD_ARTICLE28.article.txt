THE FOOL —Curran Theatre —is the
type of play that will make you think
for a change. It is filled with intellec
tual stimuli and emotional thrills that
hold the attention at all times. Getting
a slow but weighty start, it gradually
gathers a force that brings about a
third-act climax which is "powerful
stuff." It is the sort of modern drama
that has the lobby filled with people
saying: "The best show I've s*een this
year."
Briefly, the plot is that of a young
man who sets everything aside in the
way of material success to follow the
spiritual dream with which he is in
spired. His struggle against the nar-

row and selfish people of all classes
with whom he comes in contact is a
contest with a marked modern flavor
that keeps the audience always in sus
pense.
