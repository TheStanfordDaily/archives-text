### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When you and I were young, Maggie, back in 1894, Bob Edgren \ised to
throw the 16-1 b. hammer further than anyone else. He jumped l'rom one
athletic event to another, winning medals and glory and breaking records in
discus throwing, tumbling, bowling, and speedboat racing, but as for playing
golfâ€”pooh, pooh! He wouldn't stoop to that! One day his fellow cartoonist,
Vic Forsythe, induced him to try to drive a golf ball at the Havana Country
Club in Cuba. The ball went so'far that Bob was fascinated, and at once
took up the game. Today, the stakeholder of the Dempsey-Carpentier fight
says golf is the greatest sport going.
