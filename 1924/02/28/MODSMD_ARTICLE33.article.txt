# O. A. C. SENIORS HAVE HAIR-RAISING MATCH
## 
### 
The senior mustache-growing con
test at Oregon Agricultural College
gained three new entries recently. The
rules and regulations of the contest
will be strictly observed, no tonics,
coaxing, shampoos, or beauty treat
ments being permitted. The measure
ments will take place at junior week
end. No dope as to winners can be

given at this time because many claim
that the spring atmosphere will do
wonders for the crop. It is agreed that
the three losers will be hosts at a
dinner to the other contestants when
the battle is over.
