# Nothing Proven in Mental Telepathy, Coover States
## 
### 
"Nothing has been proven in the
science of thought transference," as
serted Professor J. E. Coover at a
meeting of Euphronia last night. "Most
mental telepathy is accomplished by
means of muscle reading or through
a code with the co-opertaion of a con
federate."
Professor Coover gave a short dem
onstration of thought transference after
his talk. He read off the number on a
watch belonging to a member of the
audience, and which he had never seen.
With almost complete accuracy he
picked out several specified cards from
a deck.
