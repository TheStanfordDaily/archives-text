# PAN-HELLENIC MAY ASSIST SORORITIES IN DATING RUSHEES
## Interest of Eastern Colleges Centers on Stanford Rushing System 
### 
College women all over the country
are watching Stanford women's rushing
system, according to Miss Marie Leg
horn, national officer of Kappa Kappa
Gamma, who addressed a meeting of
Pan-Hellenic yesterday.
Miss Leghorn suggested that invi
tations for dates with sororities be sent
out through Pan-Hellenic in order to
avoid the difficulty of any sorority ask
ing a rushee for more than one date in
advance and thus breaking Pan-Hel
lenic rules. This plan has not been
definitely accepted by Pan-Hellenic
but it will probably be tried for 'the
first dates of rushing week.
"Such a rushing system as you are
trying here at Stanford has never
worked out." said Miss Leghorn. "It
has been tried at other universities, but
never for longer than a period of two
years. That is why every college
woman is so interested in your attempt
to solve the problem. If you can solve
your housing problem in this manner
you will have done what others could
not do.
"After all, what every sorority
woman should think about is the ideals
of her fraternity. What we are striv
ing for is a well-rounded, open minded
fraternity woman."
All penalties for non-observance of
the rushing date rules will be put in
the hands of the Alumnae Board.
