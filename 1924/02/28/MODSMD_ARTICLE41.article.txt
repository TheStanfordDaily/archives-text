# Shrubbery For Dances Is From Campus Nursery
## 
### 
All trees and shrubs used for deco
rations at campus dances and other
University social functions are fur
nished by the University nursery situ
ated back of the Medical building.
The nursery also raises all the
flowers and plants set out on the Uni
versity grounds.
When established in 1892, simul
taneously with the founding of the
University, it consisted solely of one
lathhouse and a few small plots of
ground for setting out young plants.
Since that time several additions have
been made. A glass-roofed propagation
house furnishes protection for young
plants until they are strong enough
to withstand exposure in the open
plots. Specimens of shrubs for the bet
any department are also raised. An
other glass-covered structure is de
voted exclusively to the culture of
ferns. The original lathhouse is still
used for growing small plants and
shrubs. A new lathhouse was built
last year.
Approximately seven acres of
ground are used for setting out plants
when they have become strong and for
the growing of trees.
Peacocks Roam Loose
An interesting feature of the nur
sery is the flock of ten peacocks which
roam loose throughout the grounds.
The birds are direct descendants of
those which Senator Stanford brought
here from bis ranch in Weiner.
On the grounds there is also an ex
periment station for the culture of
silkworms. Miss Mary McCracken of
the entymology department has charge
of this work.
Directly adjacent to the nursery the
United States Department of Agricul
ture conducts an experimental station
for the study of disease-resisting
types of deciduous fruit trees.
Employes Hired by Stanford
Most of the nursery employes were
originally hired by Senator Stanford.
J. H. Reinhart has worked on the
Stanford estate for forty years and
has cared for plants ever since the
institution was established. A Chinese
gardener is one of the original ranch
hands of the University founder.
Charles Myers, superintendent of
the nursery, has been here since 1906.
He has worked with plants nearly all
his life and understands every phase
of their culture.
