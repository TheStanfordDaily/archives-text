# Balance Faults, Merits in Debating, Advises Emerson
## 
### 
"Constructive debating does not con
sist in utterly condemning a man Or in
boosting him to the 'skies, but rather
in balancing up his faults and merits,
thus giving him a solid foundation upon
which to base his future progress."
Such was the definition given by
Professor J. G. Emerson at the Nes
toria meeting held in room 12 of the
law building last night. The debating
coasji used the speakers in the preced
ing informal debate on the question,
"Resolved, that the Federal government
should own the oil resources of the
United States" as concrete examples
to illustrate his points.
A. T. Steele and J. E. Raaf success
fully upheld the affirmative of the sub
ject.
