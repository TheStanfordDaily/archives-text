# SWIMMING, TRAINING QUESTIONS SETTLED AT W. A. A. MEETING
## 
### 
A regulation governing women regis
tering in swimming next quarter pre
paratory to the April meet with Cali
fornia was passed by the governing
board of the Women's Athletic Aaso
ciation at its bi-monthly meeting last
night.
It was decided that a woman might
enter swimming at the beginning of
spring quarter, undergo intensive
training for thre<e weeks, participate
in the California meet, then, if so de
siring, change to another sport. She
may thus receive W. A. A. points to
ward her "S" sweater in the line to
which she has transferred.
W. A. A. voted to join the National
Amateur Athletic Federation of Amer
ica, which has invited Stanford to
become a member of its women's sec
tion. The purpose of this organization,
which has Mrs. Herbert Hoover as one
of its leaders, is to further women's
athletics by keeping them sane and
providing for competitions under the
proper conditions, with adequate medi
cal supervision.
Training rules for all sports were
discussed and the team captains are
to be instructed to emphasize them to
the teams.
Second teams in basketball are to
have games on the same days as the
first squads. This decision applies to
freshmen, sophomores, and seniors.
