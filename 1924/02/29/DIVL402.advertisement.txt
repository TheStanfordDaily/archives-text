Coming!
â€”the Rolls-Royce of Radio
It's Radiola's greatest achievement,
the SUPER-HETERODYNE. A Radio
so improved in sensitiveness and se
lectivity that a novice may enter new
regions of entertainment and delight.
Within the next two weeks we will
| have the SUPER-HETERODYNE. If
t you have contemplated building such
a set, it will pay you to wait. It sells
for little more than parts would cost
you.
Come in and ask about it.
We are open every evening
j after seven-thirty
