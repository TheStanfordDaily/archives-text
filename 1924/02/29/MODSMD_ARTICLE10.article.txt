# ORIGINAL PLAYS OF DRAMATIC CLASS PLEASE AUDIENCE
## Aileene Burks Shows Ability In Ingenue Role; Jack Dillman Does Well 
### Marjorie Allen 
Reaching a high pinnacle in The-!
atrical Workshop productions, "Let's!
Pretend" and "Michael's Mother," twoj
original plays presented by Theatrical
Workshop class last night in the As
sembly hall, left the audience with i
the satisfied expression of an evening
well spent.
Both plays succeeded in holding the
interest and attention of the audience, j
However, Gordon Davis showed good j
judgment in placing "Let's Pretend" j
as the second number on the program.
With a more experienced cast this de- j
lightful fantasy was able to hold the!
audience at the dramatic points where
the other play failed.
Aileene Burks Good
The work of Aileene Burks and
Jack Dillman as Pierrette and Pierrot
practically "made" the performance.
Miss Burks, who was working under:
the handicap of a bad cold, in the part,
of the love-sick Pierrette, showed the j
campus that she is capable of carrying j
an ingenue part as well as a heavier
character role. Jack Dillman was well
fitted for the part of Pierrot in form
and voice. His portrayal of the for- f
tune-seeking youth was enjoyable and j
his dramatic moments intense.
Froth Villainy
Mary Chaney and Bert Brouse as
Columbine and Harlequin did interest
ing work and added the necessary
"villain and villainess motive" to the
play, although their parts demanded \
a rather frothy type of villainy.
The work of Irene Thompson as I
Mrs. O'Shauglmessy in Michael's -
Mother was the noticeably interesting
work in the play by Robert E. Fitz- i
gerald. Considering that the play was j
the work of a class and not a finished j
campus production, it was unusually
well done as to directing and acting, j
Inexperienced Cast
If some of the actors were not quite j
able to forget their own personalities j
it was probably due to the fact that i
they were amateurs at it. The cast j
showed promise of better work in fu
ture plays.
The Theatrical Workshop class I
should be complimented for the ex
cellent handling of lighting and scenic
effects. The coziness of an Irish home
on a sunny morning and the gorgeous
splendor of the home of Pierrot and
Pierrette presented artistic settings
for the plays.

PENN STATE WOMEN STUDY
HOUSEKEEPING WITH BABY
Women at Pennsylvania State Col
lege are learning the art of house
keeping in a modern house with a
modern baby. In a model home,
equipped with gas and electricity and
every convenience, they study the arts
of domesticity and economy. The baby
was installed after the students com
plained to college authorities that they
needed a "tot" around to give first
hand experience, and provide the
proper atmosphere.
