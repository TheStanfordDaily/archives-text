# "Tell It To Judge" Is Week-End Motto
## 
### 
If it isn't the weather it's something
else, but according to some pretty re
liable information which seeped into the
Daily office today, it looks like a dark
week-end ahead in spite of the fact that
a few more stars than usual will shine
on the campus.
And that's just where the hitch comes
in. They're the wrong kind of stars.
They're the kind that ride around on
motorcycles and shine on offending
motorists when they forget to watch
their speedometers closely enough. In
other words, they are motorcycle cops,
and four of them from Santa Clara
county are going to be guests of the
University over the week-end.
They are especially interested in stu
dent motorists and expect to make an
intensive study of motoring conditions
on the campus, paying particular at
tention to the phases of speeding, of
fensive mufflers, and non-functioning
head and tail-lights.
Rumor lias it that any student who
attempts to give a too enthusiastic dem
onstration along those lines will be
asked to call on the chief at the Santa
Clara county courthouse and leave not
less than twenty dollars with him.
It is said also that if business is
good, the four bloodhounds of the law
will not be averse to remaining on the
campus for three or four days next
week as well.
