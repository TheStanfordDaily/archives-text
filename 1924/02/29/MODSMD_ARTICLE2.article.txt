# JORDAN DISCUSSES DARWIN, LINCOLN
## 
### 
Lincoln, the apostle of democracy,
and Darwin, the leader in the dis
covery of true scientific methods, were
the subjects of Dr. Jordan's discussion
last night.
Dr. Jordan reviewed the ancestry,
early life, education, political aspira
tions, and finally the presidency of
Lincoln.
"Lincoln," said Dr. Jordan, "was in
favor of peace, but he was forced to
lead his country through the most
critical war in its history. He had
trouble with his cabinet and generals
but through it all he stood up for his
principles and was finally able to ac
complish that which he hoped for for
many years, the freedom of the
slaves."
Darwin Unlike Lincoln
"Darwin was unlike Lincoln, the self
made man, in that he had the advan
tages of an education, having attended
Cambridge for several years."
"Not long after leaving school," said
Dr. Jordan, "Darwin made a tour
around the world and was surprised
to note, on visiting several islands,
that there were a great many of the
same animals that were to be found
in South America, but that they were
of a different species. This discovery
caused the scientist to question the
theory that the species were unchange
able.
"Darwin is not cast aside by people
of scientific quality. He will never be
come old-fashioned for all of his con
clusions are going to last and all sci
ences will be based on them," said
Dr. Jordan.
