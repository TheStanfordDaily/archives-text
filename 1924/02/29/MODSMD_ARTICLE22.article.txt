# SENIORS TAKE IRISH MARATHON; AVERAGE TIME IS :53.7 TO LAP
## Storie and Tarleton Get Medals For Fastest Quarters; Holdover Show Satirizes Sponsor System 
### Wallace Knox 
Averaging :53.7 to the lap, the senior team easily won the Irish Marathon
** yesterday afternoon on the track oval.
Bill Storie, running last for the juniors, won the varsity medal when he
covered his quarter in :49 1-5. Storie's time was the best in the Marathon,
and he made it without competition, as the juniors were considerably behind
the other teams.
Non-varsity honors went to Tarlfton, a senior who transferred this year
from the University of Hawaii. Tarleton turned in a time of :50 4-5. Miller
had the best sophomore time. He did his lap in :51 1-5, giving the second
year men a substantial lead at the start of the race.
Sponsor System Satirized
The hold-over show was a satire on the sponsor system. The playlet tried
to show the present plan as tending to make the freshman "cocky" and
disrespectful of Stanford traditions and ideals. It depicted a meeting of the
sponsor committee at which a freshman appeared and reprimanded the

sponsors, Dean Culver and Comptrol
ler Roth, for not taking better care
of the first year men.
The characters of the show were:
De Snoot, Hock Chalmers; McHorse,
"Kewp" Sproul; Tom Irwin's brother,
Walt Alexander; Dutch Roth, Orville
Tucker; Dean Culver, Fred Anderson;
Gene Trago, Charlie Deffebach; fresh
man, Bob Bailard.
Spencer Fastest Frosh
Elmer Spencer, holder of the Na
tional Intel-scholastic 220-yard low
hurdle title, ran the fastest freshman
lap. He overcame a big lead for the
freshmen, and the watches caught him
at. :51 as he crossed the line. Mcintosh
and Bragg also made good times for
the seniors. Bragg's time was :51 4-5,
and Mcintosh's was :50i 2-5.
Three-Legged Race
Leistner and Clifford won the three
legged race, negotiating the 100 yards
together in :13 3-5. Smith and Coverly
put up a hard fight but could not keep
up with the winner. Gaspar and Mc-
Dougal were third.
Mcintosh repeated his performance
of last year and handily won the 100-
yard backwards dash. West was sec
ond.
Cleaveland, Humphries, and Truman
walked almost a dead heat in the 440-
yard walk. Truman led most of the
way, but Humphries took the lead on
the last curve. Cleaveland sailed by
both of them on the last twenty yards,
and finished a scant yard ahead.
Chickens Chased
The foot and mouth disease pro
hibited the use of a greased pig, and
so five chickens were used as substi
tutes. After chasing the Bantams all
over the bleachers and even onto the
soccer field the frightened roosters
were bagged. The best cliicken-cliasers
proved to be Milliken, Carlsmith, Al
len, Daly, and de Reynier.
Somphomores Lead
The sophomores led the first lap of
the marathon. Miller gained a substan
tial lead for the 1926 team, with the
seniors second, and the juniors and
freshmen bringing up the rear.
Spencer gained a momentary lead
for the babes but the sophomores re
gained it on the fourth lap. The sen
iors had been bringing up (he rear
until the seventh lap when Gil Wheat
passed the freshmen and juniors, and
gave Cleaveland the baton almost as
soon as the sophomore runners
changed.
From this time until the thirteenth
lap the lead was shifting back and
forth between the sophomores and the
juniors. Art Bragg and Johnny Graves
then came through with fast quarters
and put the seniors far enough ahead
to make them safe during the rest
of the race.
The senior runners maintained this
lead, which was about seventy-five
yards, throughout the rest of the race.
The sophomores held second, the
freshmen third, and the juniors last
throughout the latter part, and fin
ished in the same order.
The total senior time for the six
miles was 21:51 4-5.

tial lead for the 1926 team, with the
seniors second, and the juniors and
freshmen bringing up the rear.
Spencer gained a momentary lead
for the babes but the sophomores re
gained it on the fourth lap. The sen
iors had been bringing up (he rear
until the seventh lap when Gil Wheat
passed the freshmen and juniors, and
gave Cleaveland the baton almost as
soon as the sophomore runners
changed.
From this time until the thirteenth
lap the lead was shifting back and
forth between the sophomores and the
juniors. Art Bragg and Johnny Graves
then came through with fast quarters
and put the seniors far enough ahead
to make them safe during the rest
of the race.
The senior runners maintained this
lead, which was about seventy-five
yards, throughout the rest of the race.
The sophomores held second, the
freshmen third, and the juniors last
throughout the latter part, and fin
ished in the same order.
The total senior time for the six
miles was 21:51 4-5.
Averaging :53.7 to the lap, the senior team easily won the Irish Marathon
** yesterday afternoon on the track oval.
Bill Storie, running last for the juniors, won the varsity medal when he
covered his quarter in :49 1-5. Storie's time was the best in the Marathon,
and he made it without competition, as the juniors were considerably behind
the other teams.
Non-varsity honors went to Tarlfton, a senior who transferred this year
from the University of Hawaii. Tarleton turned in a time of :50 4-5. Miller
had the best sophomore time. He did his lap in :51 1-5, giving the second
year men a substantial lead at the start of the race.
Sponsor System Satirized
The hold-over show was a satire on the sponsor system. The playlet tried
to show the present plan as tending to make the freshman "cocky" and
disrespectful of Stanford traditions and ideals. It depicted a meeting of the
sponsor committee at which a freshman appeared and reprimanded the

sponsors, Dean Culver and Comptrol
ler Roth, for not taking better care
of the first year men.
The characters of the show were:
De Snoot, Hock Chalmers; McHorse,
"Kewp" Sproul; Tom Irwin's brother,
Walt Alexander; Dutch Roth, Orville
Tucker; Dean Culver, Fred Anderson;
Gene Trago, Charlie Deffebach; fresh
man, Bob Bailard.
Spencer Fastest Frosh
Elmer Spencer, holder of the Na
tional Intel-scholastic 220-yard low
hurdle title, ran the fastest freshman
lap. He overcame a big lead for the
freshmen, and the watches caught him
at. :51 as he crossed the line. Mcintosh
and Bragg also made good times for
the seniors. Bragg's time was :51 4-5,
and Mcintosh's was :50i 2-5.
Three-Legged Race
Leistner and Clifford won the three
legged race, negotiating the 100 yards
together in :13 3-5. Smith and Coverly
put up a hard fight but could not keep
up with the winner. Gaspar and Mc-
Dougal were third.
Mcintosh repeated his performance
of last year and handily won the 100-
yard backwards dash. West was sec
ond.
Cleaveland, Humphries, and Truman
walked almost a dead heat in the 440-
yard walk. Truman led most of the
way, but Humphries took the lead on
the last curve. Cleaveland sailed by
both of them on the last twenty yards,
and finished a scant yard ahead.
Chickens Chased
The foot and mouth disease pro
hibited the use of a greased pig, and
so five chickens were used as substi
tutes. After chasing the Bantams all
over the bleachers and even onto the
soccer field the frightened roosters
were bagged. The best cliicken-cliasers
proved to be Milliken, Carlsmith, Al
len, Daly, and de Reynier.
