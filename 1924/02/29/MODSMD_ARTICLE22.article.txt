# SENIORS TAKE IRISH MARATHON; AVERAGE TIME IS :53.7 TO LAP
## Storie and Tarleton Get Medals For Fastest Quarters; Holdover Show Satirizes Sponsor System 
### Wallace Knox 
Averaging :53.7 to the lap, the senior team easily won the Irish Marathon
** yesterday afternoon on the track oval.
Bill Storie, running last for the juniors, won the varsity medal when he
covered his quarter in :49 1-5. Storie's time was the best in the Marathon,
and he made it without competition, as the juniors were considerably behind
the other teams.
Non-varsity honors went to Tarlfton, a senior who transferred this year
from the University of Hawaii. Tarleton turned in a time of :50 4-5. Miller
had the best sophomore time. He did his lap in :51 1-5, giving the second
year men a substantial lead at the start of the race.
Sponsor System Satirized
The hold-over show was a satire on the sponsor system. The playlet tried
to show the present plan as tending to make the freshman "cocky" and
disrespectful of Stanford traditions and ideals. It depicted a meeting of the
sponsor committee at which a freshman appeared and reprimanded the

sponsors, Dean Culver and Comptrol
ler Roth, for not taking better care
of the first year men.
The characters of the show were:
De Snoot, Hock Chalmers; McHorse,
"Kewp" Sproul; Tom Irwin's brother,
Walt Alexander; Dutch Roth, Orville
Tucker; Dean Culver, Fred Anderson;
Gene Trago, Charlie Deffebach; fresh
man, Bob Bailard.
Spencer Fastest Frosh
Elmer Spencer, holder of the Na
tional Intel-scholastic 220-yard low
hurdle title, ran the fastest freshman
