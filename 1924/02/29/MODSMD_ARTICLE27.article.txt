The campus owes Quadrangle Club a vole of thanks for the afternoon
of good entertainment provided yesterday.
Everything went off smoothly. The Holdover Show was well written
and well acted. It was short and spicy and kept the large crowd of spec
tators laughing all the way through.
The specialty stunts were the usual big successes. The Marathon itself,
though rather one-sided after the first few laps, was very satisfactory.
Those who grumbled at having to pay an admission fee of twenty-five
cents can rest assured that their money will go for a good cause.
Quadrangle Club will devote all the proceeds to the Trophy Room.
From the good crowd which was on hand to see the fun, the contribution
will be a substantial one.
