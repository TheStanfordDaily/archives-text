Cometh a suggestion from somewhere intimating that a prolonged
hoot on the Power House whistle, delivered promptly at seven o'clock
each morning, would be a mighty good thing, and the proposal will lie set
before the Executive Committee next Tuesday evening. At first blush,
this matitudinal disturbance smacks strongly of "high school stuff." but
after all it has points good and bad.
Freshmen living in Encina must report for napkin-drill between 7:15
and 7 :30 of the dawn, or cast themselves upon a sea of hunger through
out the morning. A shattering blast of the whistle would be well calcu
lated to rouse the recalcitrant from his pillow and send him forth in
well-fed contentment. Contrariwise the nine-o'clock scholar would find his
sleep blighted and the day beginning all wrong. The point has been brought
up that individuals within close range of the uproar would become trained
to itâ€”the whoop would rouse them if they so wished, otherwise they
would learn to peacefully ig-snore it. Experience will tell.
University authorities leave it up to those most concerned with the
daylight-saving idea. Some years ago the whistle refused to function for
a fire-alarm, and since then it has blow'n once a day, just to keep in condi
tion. Whether it clears its throat during the early morning or late after
noon is of no consequence.
It then devolves upon the campus in general and Encina in particular
to decide the question of a steam alarm-clock.
