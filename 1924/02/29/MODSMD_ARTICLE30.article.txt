# Glee Club

### 
This afternoon, the Stanford Glee Club gave a concert at the opening
of the new Galileo high school auditorium in San Francisco.
The Glee Club is an organization which goes about its business without
much publicity and does a great deal of good for the University. It is fre
quently called upon to help out with campus functions such as rallies and
dances and is never found wanting.
The club will make a trip south during the spring holidays to sing at
Hollywood, Manual Arts, Lincoln, Pasadena, Glendale, and Bakersficld
high schools.
Friday, March 7, Stanford students will have a chance to hear the glee
club on the campus. Tickets have been reduced from one dollar to 75
cents.
Under the direction of Warren D. Allen, the club this year has been
doing the same fine kind of work as it has done in the past. The Assembly
Hall should be crowded next week for the first performance of its kind
this year.
"First moving picture made on campus farm." We would hate to
think that some of the atrocities which are shown on the silver screen now
could be traced even indirectly to Stanford.
A check in the hand is worth two in the mail.
Knickers and golf go together (sometimes). So do ham and eggs.
