Did you ever fail
To get a letter from
That Home Town girl,
And got so sore and
Disgusted that you
Tore up all her mail
For the past ten weeks,
Then sat down and
Wrote a scathing note
On the weather with
A "yours truly" on the end,
And after you've mailed
It you get a loving
Missile asking for forgiveness.
So have I.

Never again, say we.
At 10:30 p.m., last night, in the
darkness, a light appeared in the boat
house. Cries of fire resounded. But

Bill's the lucky man in our room.
See that big box of candy in the cor
ner? That's Bill's, not mine.
We've a phonograph, a mandolin, a
nice easy chair, and the walls in the
room are covered with all sorts of
pictures. But they're all Bill's, not
mine.
The drawers are full of clothes, col
lars, neckties, and socks. The're Bill's,
not mine.
The desks are covered with pictures
of pretty girls. They're Bill's, not
mine.
At the end of every month we get
a hundred letters. Yes, they're BILLS,
and they're all mine.
