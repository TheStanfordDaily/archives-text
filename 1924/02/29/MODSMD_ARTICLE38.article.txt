# WOMEN ARE BARRED FROM THE YALE-COLUMBIA GAME
## 
### 
Women will be barred from the
Columbia-Yale basketball games due
to the great number of ticket applica
tions from alumni. The classes of 1926
and 1927 will be forced to make use
of the running track above the gymna
sium floor as reserved seats will be
available only for Alumni and upper
classmen.
