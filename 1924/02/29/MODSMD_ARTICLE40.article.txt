It is with our extreme apologies that we present this
picture. We thought that we could take the day off (since
it was February 29th, which only coines every four years),
and left this picture for our understudy to finish. We told
him to put H. Wills opposite Suzanneâ€”and he got the wrong
H. Wills!
