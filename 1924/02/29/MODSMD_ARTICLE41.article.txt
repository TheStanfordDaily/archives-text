# NO MORE INTERFRATERNITY ATHLETICS FOR MONTANA U.
## 
### 
The interfraternity council at the
University of Montana has decided to
abolish inter-fraternity athletics at the
college. All the cups and trophies
which the fraternities already have in
their possession will be scrapped at a
public meeting.
