# Women's Boathouse Destroyed by Blaze
## 
### 
Fire, supposedly caused by a care
lessly-thrown cigarette, almost totally
destroyed the women's boathouse at
Lagunita about 10:30 last night.
A large part of the student body
turned out for the blaze. The fire de
partment arrived on the scene about
ten minutes after the spectators had
gathered, too late to save any of the
old structure except a few badly
charred timbers.
Women students raised money by
their own efforts for the erection of
the boathouse in 1910. Until two years
ago it was used for storing boats. Sev
eral women's dressing rooms were
also included in the structure.
In 1922 it was turned over to the
University by the women because
there was no further use for it.
The cost of rebuilding the boathouse
would be approximately five hundred
dollars. No boats were stored in the
structure when the blaze occurred.
