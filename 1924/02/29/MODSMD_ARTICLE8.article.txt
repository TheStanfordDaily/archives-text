# QUAD IS BEING SOLD ON INSTALLMENT PLAN
## 
### 
The 1925 Quad is now being sold on
the installment plan for a first pay
ment of $2.00 and the balance of $4.00
payable April 15. The first forms of
the Quad go to press in about ten
days, according to the Editor, Donald
McKay, and will be ready for final dis
tribution on June 1.
Twenty-five sample covers for the
Quad have arrived from the David J.
Molloy Company of Chicago, Illinois,
who are the inventors and perfectors
of the Molloy process of embossing
and artificial coloring. The design for
the covers was made in San Francisco
by Leo Krumel, who is also doing six
paintings in full color which are to
appear as frontispiece and division
pages for the book. The Stanford art
gallery as seen through a leaded plate
glass arche is the basis of the design,
which is embossed to make the build
ing stand out in bas-relief. An attempt
has been made to preserve closely the
colors of the buff sandstone and cardi
nal roof. The change in size of the
book makes it much less bulky.
