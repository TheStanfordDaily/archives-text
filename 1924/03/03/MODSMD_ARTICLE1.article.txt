# KENEALY'S SEALS SHUT OUT VARSITY BASEBALLERS, 5-0
## Stanford Nine Gives Oviatt Poor Support in Field; Makes Two Hits 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball wrecking
crew failed to pound out the hits Satur
day afternoon and the Kenealy Seals
emerged from a colorless fray on the
top side of asto 0 score. This was the
second clash with Kenealy. The first
one came to the Cards 4 to 3 in eleven
innings.
Only two hits were garnered in the
nine frames off the Seal pitcher,* Rock,
and one of those came in the ninth in

to left center field for two liases. Had

have carried across the fence for a
home run, and as it was the ball just
struck the top of the barrier.
Second Defeat in Week.
This was the second game in the
season and during the last week that
the varsity has dropped, after making
a clean sweep of all opponents for nine
successive contests. The day was cold
and a high wind made it hard to field
the ball. The fielders showed clearly
the results of the frigid weather, and
the Cardinal support was credited with
five errors.
Oviatt pitched a winning game of ball
but he was not backed up well in the
field. The Seals opened up in the first
inning and scored a run on a walk, a
bunt, an outfield fly and a single by
Lewis.
They came back in the second and
scored two more after the Cards went
down in order. Another walk, and a
stolen base put Rowe on second, from
where he scored on Fuller's error in
judging a fly ball. Rocke got to third
on the error and scored on Black's
