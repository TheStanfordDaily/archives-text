but he was not backed up well in the
field. The Seals opened up in the first
inning and scored a run on a walk, a
bunt, an outfield fly and a single by
Lewis.

scored two more after the Cards went
down in order. Another walk, and a
stolen base put Rowe on second, from
where he scored on Fuller's error in
judging a fly ball. Rocke got to third
on the error and scored on Black's
single to center.
The next score came in the fifth
round when Kenealy's crowd collected
a couple more runs. With one down,
Lewis singled to center, and Rowe fol
lowed with another hit to the same
spot after Lazzeri struck out. With
men on second and third, Hobckc hit to
Mulchay. The Card shortstop let the
ball get away from him, and the two
men scored. Black struck out for the
last out.
Stanford's innings were lean. Mc-
Candless made a single in an early
frame hut the varsity batsmen were
turned back in order with the exception
of the ninth round. Oviatt opened up
with his long drive to center for two
bases. Roberts grounded out and
Oviatt went to third. Cuddeback
struck out and Johnston, with the
count three and two, drew a pass. Mc-
Candless who had gathered 50 per cent
of the previous hits took a couple of
clean cuts at the ball and then waited
for three balls. With the count three
and two on him, lie took two foul swats
and finally lifted a high fly to Tapson
at second which ended the game.

hits. Oviatt struck out at least one man

Stanford's varsity baseball wrecking
crew failed to pound out the hits Satur
day afternoon and the Kenealy Seals
emerged from a colorless fray on the
top side of asto 0 score. This was the
second clash with Kenealy. The first
one came to the Cards 4 to 3 in eleven
innings.
Only two hits were garnered in the
nine frames off the Seal pitcher,* Rock,
and one of those came in the ninth in
ning when Oviatt crashed the ball out
to left center field for two liases. Had
the wind slacked up the drive would
have carried across the fence for a
home run, and as it was the ball just
struck the top of the barrier.
Second Defeat in Week.
This was the second game in the
season and during the last week that
the varsity has dropped, after making
a clean sweep of all opponents for nine
successive contests. The day was cold
and a high wind made it hard to field
the ball. The fielders showed clearly
the results of the frigid weather, and
the Cardinal support was credited with
five errors.
Oviatt pitched a winning game of ball
but he was not backed up well in the
field. The Seals opened up in the first
inning and scored a run on a walk, a
bunt, an outfield fly and a single by
Lewis.
They came back in the second and
scored two more after the Cards went
down in order. Another walk, and a
stolen base put Rowe on second, from
where he scored on Fuller's error in
judging a fly ball. Rocke got to third
on the error and scored on Black's
single to center.
The next score came in the fifth
round when Kenealy's crowd collected
a couple more runs. With one down,
Lewis singled to center, and Rowe fol
lowed with another hit to the same
spot after Lazzeri struck out. With
men on second and third, Hobckc hit to
Mulchay. The Card shortstop let the
ball get away from him, and the two
men scored. Black struck out for the
last out.
Stanford's innings were lean. Mc-
Candless made a single in an early
frame hut the varsity batsmen were
turned back in order with the exception
of the ninth round. Oviatt opened up
with his long drive to center for two
bases. Roberts grounded out and
Oviatt went to third. Cuddeback
struck out and Johnston, with the
count three and two, drew a pass. Mc-
Candless who had gathered 50 per cent
of the previous hits took a couple of
clean cuts at the ball and then waited
for three balls. With the count three
and two on him, lie took two foul swats
and finally lifted a high fly to Tapson
at second which ended the game.
Oviatt Strikes Out Seven.
Besides holding the Seals to seven
hits. Oviatt struck out at least one man
in each round except the first, third and
ninth, accumulating seven strike-outs
