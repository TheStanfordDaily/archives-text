# Zoologists Become Cat Catchers When College Quail Begin Disappearing
## 
### 
Do you love your cat? Then keep
your eye on him, for the Zoology de
partment will ge ( t him "if you don't
watch out!"
It is not because it loves cats less,
but because it loves birds more, that
the University officials haVe granted
the Zoology department permission to
dispose of the bewliiskered animals,
who have been living off campus quail.
Over a dozen birds have been killed in
the last two months, and those In
j tenested in preserving the feathered
flocks think it time for drastic action.
No traps will be set between Alva
rado Row and the County Road unless
inhabitants request that stray cats be
kept out of their back yards.
