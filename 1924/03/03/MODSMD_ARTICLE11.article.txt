# BABE DIAMOND TEAM DOWNED BY ALAMEDA HIGH NINE. SCORE 5-3
## 
### 
Ragged infielding caused the Frosh
baseball nine to bow before the strong
Alameda high school aggregation, 5-3,
Saturday afternoon.
Osthaus and Collins alternated in the
box. Osthaus held the prep school
leaguers to a no-hit tally and allowed
three walks during the four innings he
was on the mound. Five hits were
credited against Collins in the remain
ing innings, but they were well scat
tered. Collins struck out eight men
and allowed one walk.
The catching position appeared to be
the weak spot of the battery. "Bill"
Stewart. Scherer, and Bailard each took
a turn at this position, but none of them
held the hall with any success. Errors
in this department were responsible
for at least two of the five runs.
Reese who just appeared on the
squad this week showed up well in his
position in right field. Out of three
times to bat lie made three clean hits
giving him a batting average of 1000
per cent for his first game.
Coach Hunt requests that all fresh
men baseball aspirants report at once,
as he will pick the first team during the
next few weeks.
The line-up: B. Stewart, catcher;
Osthaus, pitcher; Mack, first base;
Lundquist, second base; Morril, third
base; Wood, shortstop; G. Stewart, left
field; Pegram, center field; Bailard,
right field.
