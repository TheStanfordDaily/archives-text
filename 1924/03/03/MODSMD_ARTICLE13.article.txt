### 
"Legend of the Laurel" is the title
which has been given to the Fiesta,
the women's pageant to be held May
3. The pageant, which was written by
Evelyn Brownell, was selected at the
first of the quarter as the best of sev
eral works submitted for production.
The name of the Fiesta remained un
decided until recently.
Tryouts Begin Today
Tryouts for acting roles in the
Fiesta began this afternoon in the As
sembly hall and will continue from
7 to 10 tonight. All women wishing to
try out for the dances will report at
the women's gymnasium for the five
o'clock advanced dancing class tomor
row afternoon. Dancing tryoutees will
also report again tomorrow night ot
the Assembly hall.
About seventy women are needed
for group dancing. The play calls for
eight leading characters.

All women in the University are
eligible for tryouts, the Fiesta being
the one dramatic activity in which
freshman women may participate. Wo
men in the pageant will not be de
barred from the Junior Opera.
Variety of Work
The Fiesta is the one campus pro
duction which is handled entirely by
the women and it offers work for prac
tically every woman student. Many
people will be needed for tableau ef
fects and as audiences in scenes, in
addition to those who dance and act.
There is also much work to be done
in costume and scenery designing.
The "Legend of Laurel" takes place
on the island ol' Delos and requires a
very simple background. Touches of
light humor are combined in the story
with the mythical romance. The plot
offers excellent opportunities for tab
leaux and colorful dances.
