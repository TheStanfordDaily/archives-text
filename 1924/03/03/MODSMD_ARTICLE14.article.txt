# NEW INTERPRETATION OF CHRIST GIVEN BY DR. WILLIAM BITTING
## 
### 
"The question that concerned Christ
was 'How are you spending today?'"
was the statement made by the Rev
erend William C. Bitting, of the Sec
ond Baptist Church of St. Louis, Mis
souri, in the Memorial Church Sunday.
He explained that Christ's mission was
not to tell of the glories or tortures of
an afterlife, but to put heaven in men
themselves.
"The popular conception of Christ as
depicted in art is incorrect. Did you
even see Christ in a painting with a
joyous face?" asked Dr. Bitting.
"What was this joy which He shared
with men? It was the joy of self
realization and of perfection of social
adjustment," said Dr. Bitting. "When
men realize this their material appetites
are checked. The basis of the Christian
religion is love of God, one's self, and
the other person.
"Religion must appeal to the rational
nature or it can have no appeal," con
tinued Dr. Bitting. "Love and scholar
ship will overcome sects; we must build
on reverence based on knowledge
rather than ignorance and superstition."
He showed the failure of the modern
world in this principle when a world of
nations was sacrificed to personal and
political ascendency.
"We are crying out for a reinterpre
tation of God,'' Dr. Bitting declared.
"Every day we need something fresh
and new which embodies the new ra
tionalism and discoveries of science,
and throws away the antiquated disc of
dogma. Religion is not a finality, it is
only the beginning of our understand
ing of things."
