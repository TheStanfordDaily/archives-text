# CARDINAL VARSITY, FUN WATER POLOISTS DEFEAT SEAS SEVENS IN ONE-SIDED MATCHES
## Teamwork Puts Stanford at Long End of Score; Bruins Forced To Play Defensive Game 
### John Kenney 
CARDINAL water poloists overwhelmed the California seven by the score
of 10 to 3 Friday afternoon in Encina pool.
The Stanford freshmen set the pace for the varsity by decisively downing
the California frosh by the score of 13 to 1 in the preliminary game.
The varsity started off with a rush and within the first minute of play had
made two goals. California rallied momentarily when Herrington scored
the Bear's first point. With the exception of O'Brien's goal, the Bears were
kept on the defensive for the remainder of the half and the first priod ended

with the score 5 to 2 in favor of the
Cards.
Bears Play on Defense
At the beginning of the second half
the Bears made an effort to even up
the score but were in no way success
ful. California was able to make only
one goal during the latter seven min
utes while the Stanford seven made
five.
California's style of play was a de
fensive one. Mitchell and O'Brien, two
of the best forwards on the Coast,
were played in the backfield in an ef
fort to keep the score down. When the
Bear forward line discovered that it
could not out-charge "Wally" O'Con
nor in the rush for the ball they laid
back with the hope, that Stanford
would throw the ball away.
Herrington was the Blu« and Gold's
outstanding player, scoring two of
their three goals. O'Brien made the
other score.
Meyers Is Star
Captain "Bob" Meyers of the Stan
ford seven played a strong aggressive
game and with five goals led in the
scoring for his team. Close behind
him came "Charlie" Fletcher with
three goals. McCallister and Allen
each scored one apiece. O'Connor at
center forward beat the California for
ward line to the ball at every try and
would pass it back to his teammates
who frequently converted this advan
tage into a goal within a few seconds.
McCallister at guard played a good
game, breaking up the Bear offense
time and again.
This victory gives a hopeful outlook
for the game this Saturday with the
Olympic Club to decide which team
shall go to the National Champion
ships at Chicago. If Stanford could
pile up a lead of seven points against
California, a team which was playing
a defensive game and trying to keep
the score down rather than win, her
chances of victory are good.
Frosh Have Easy Game
The Stanford freshmen, continuing
j to show their utter disregard for all
things wearing the Blue and Gold,
1 completely swamped the Bear year
lings. The game was never in doubt
and only once was the frosh goal in
danger. The babes piled up points
just as fast as they could swim from
one end of the pool to the other.
Brooks, with six goals, was high
point man for the frosh. Captain Stew
art was close behind him with four
goals. Both of these men played well
and made apparently impossible shots.
