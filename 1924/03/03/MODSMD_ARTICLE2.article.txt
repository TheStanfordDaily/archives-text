# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY REFUSES TO BUY DEATH MASK
## 
### 
An offer made by Dr. F. M. Kir
cheisen, German historian and author
of several works on the life of Napo
leon I, to sell a death make of the
for about $5,000 has been declined.
According to Professor Ralph H. Lutz,
of the history department, the reason
for declining the offer is that the li
brary handles material having to do
only with the world war.
Authenticity Doubted
casts doubt on the authenticity of a
death mask of Napoleon recently ac
quired by the Chicago Historical So
ciety. This mask is supposed to be one
of those made of the emperor at the
time of his death by Francisco Anto
marchi, his personal physician. Ac
ccording to recent dispatches from
Chicago, two of these masks are in the
Louvre, one in the British museum,
and one is owned by Lawrence Hutton.
Fifth Mask Missing
The fifth mask,until recently miss
ing, is supposed to have been taken
into Mexico wehre it lay in a trunk
for many years, and is supposed to
have found its way into the United
States. It was purchased by the Chi
cago Historical Society last month.
Dr. Kircheisen, however, states that
the mask is in Germany. Professor
Ralph H. Lutz has expressed his be
lief that the mask which Kircheisen
is offering is the real thing.
