# STANFORD FRESHMEN 26; LIVERMORE HIGH 14
## 
### 
Livermore high school went down to defeat before the Stanford freshmen
at Stanford last Saturday night by a 26-14 score.
Livermore put up a good game, and has no excuses to make. The local
boys give Stanford credit for an A-l team, which "excels in every department
and gave an exhibition of goal throwing which would be hard to beat. The
Livermore players were in their best form and gave the freshman a fast game.
The high school players are enthusiastic over the treatment accorded them
at Stanford. Several days before the game Manager Russell Taylor received
a letter from the Stanford management requesting the Livermore boys to
arrive early at Stanford, so that they could be shown over the campus by a
guide who would be on hand to meet them. They were also told that if the
color of their suits conflicted with the Stanford suits a complete outfit would
be ready for them to use. The Stanford management had representatives on
hand to meet the Livermore boys at the train, believing that they would
travel by that means, and rooms were at their disposal on the campus for
them to stay overnight. Seats were reserved for the players and coaches so
that they could see the game between the Stanford and California varsities,
which followed their game. Everything possible for their entertainment and
convenience was arranged in advance by Stanford and they were made to feel
that they were welcome on the campus.

Above is a clipping from the Livermore Herald for February 15.
It is just this kind of feeling in high schools of the state which will do
more for Stanford than anything else. A university which establishes
such a reputation does not need to go out "scouting" for high school
athletes.
Every Stanford man and woman should be proud of an Alma Mater
which succeeds in playing the role of host so well. Before a high school
boy decides which university he will attend, he should see the campus and
know something about it.
If all institutions of higher learning would do things in this way, it is
highly improbable that there would be any complaints about "scouting."
