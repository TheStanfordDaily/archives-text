# Rain

Seldom has rain been so welcome in the state of California as it is
now. The showers which started Saturday night have been greeted with
smiles almost everywhere.*
For the farmer, every drop increases the possibility of good crops
next year. The winter just past was one of the dryest in the history of
the state. A dry winter means poor crops, which in turn means that
tillers of the soil will be hard pressed to pay interest and taxes. When
the farmer is poor, the financial depression is felt all over California.
Perhaps this rain means that it will be possible for students from
farming districts to return to school when they had not expecetd to.
The farmer is not the only one who welcomes rain. Stanford stu
dents should be glad to see it for two reasons. It would be hard to
imagine a Spring quarter without the lake being full and Lagunita is
almost entirely dependent upon rainfall.
I hen, too, with finals but two weeks away, it becomes necessary to
"hit the books." Rainy weather is an ideal time to study.
The Daily believes that the only person who has any kick coming is
the fellow who has to hire a taxi going to and from a dance and he
can either borrow an umbrella or stay at home if he objects.

The Pacific Coast Conference did the right thing in deciding to count
the games the Montana basketball team played in the north. The Grizzlies
were admitted to the conference late and had not been included in the
schedule.
The inconsistency worked a hardship on the Oregon Aggies, but it
was unavoidable that someone should be the "goat." Washington comes
south this week to meet California for the coast title.

The last issue of the Daily Palo Alto for the Winter Quarter will be
