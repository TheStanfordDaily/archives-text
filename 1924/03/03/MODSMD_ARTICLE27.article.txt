The large community party given in
the Community tent was a great suc
cess in every way. All the young
sprouts in the neighborhood were pres
ent, including Mr. and Mrs. Eggibie
Jenkins from up-stream.
The big sensation of the night was
the playful attitude of the crowd.
Someone suggested a game of drop
the-handkerchief, but it was found
that nobody had one.
The Rev. Walpoole Leaftop was the
most playful member of all. One of the
sprouts, well sprouted by this time,
had the nerve to suggest that the Rev.
dance with his wife once in a while,
and the Rev. playfully knocked all of
SAM Hinks' teeth out, smiling all the
while.
Some one said there was liquor in
the crowd, but the Howl reporter un
fortunately saw none of this.
