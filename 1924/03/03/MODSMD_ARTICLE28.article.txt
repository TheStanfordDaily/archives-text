Two hundred and forty-nine sorority
women burned to death at Stanford
University!
Horrible headline in San Francisco
paper. World gasps and Stanford's
stock rapidly descends. Waiting list

to the desperate measure of sending
out circulars painting in glowing terms
the advantages of the University for
women.
But the response to this petition is
startlingly unanimous.
"I could never be persuaded to enter
Stanford. For what shall it profit a
woman to attend such a university if
she be burned to death because she
obeys the regulation and stays in after
10:30?"
