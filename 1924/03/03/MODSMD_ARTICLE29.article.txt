# STANFORD, CALTECK TO MEET IN DEBATE AT REDWOOD TONIGHT
## 
### 
Further experience with audience de
cisions in debating will be afforded to
night when Stanford meets the Cali
fornia Institute of Technology in the
Redwood City high school auditorium.
1 The debate will begin at 8 o'clock.
United States' entrance into the
1 World Court is the subject of the for
ensic contest. A neutral audience will
! cast the vote tonight. This system of
judging causes the speakers to direct
their arguments at the entire assembly,
rather than at three men.
George Crocker and Percival Spen-
I cer will present the affirmative argu
ments for Stanford. It will be the first
time either contestants have appeared
on varsity teams but they are well pre
pared and confident of victory.
The same team will uphold the af
i firmative of the same question against
I the University of Oregon in the tri
i state debate on March 6.
