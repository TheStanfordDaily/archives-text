# EXTEND SUMMER SCHOOL TO 8 WEEKS AT W. S. C.
## 
### 
Summer session at the State Col
lege of Washington will be eight
weeks, or half a regular college se
mester, this year, Dean A. A. Cleve
land of the Department of Education
has announced. The session opens
June 16, and closes Aug. 13.
The change was made because the
usual six-weeks session is so short
and the curriculum so crowded that
it was found difficult if not impossi
ble to do wo'rk that would merit
credit toward collegiate degrees with
out hardship to both faculty and stu
dents at a time when they are tired
from the regular year's work. The 12-
weeks session in vogue at some col
leges was discussed but discarded be
cause it would extend almost to the
very day of opening of schools in the
fall, working hardship on teachers
who would thus lose all chance to
rest and prepare for the fall term.

Four dates a week is the maximum
for women at the University of Mis
souri. It was also decided that when
ever a woman was in a man's com
pany after 7 o'clock she was on a
technical date.
