# SPORTS OF 1924
## Harry Hebner 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Be a swimmer and see the world." Witness Harry J. Hebner, who has had
free trips to England, Sweden, and Belgium via the U. S. Olympic teams of
1908, 1912, and 1920. And he would have gone to the Berlin games in 1916
if the Kaiser hadn't been so busy. Harry has a good chance of going to the
1924 games, which will set a world's record for long distance Olympic globe
trotting.
Hebner now specializes in water polo with the Illinois A. C. team in Chicago,
but his Olympic experience also includes the 100 metres free style, the relay,
and the 100 metres back stroke (which he won in 1912). In 190S Hebner was
by far the youngest member of the American team. In 1920 he was honored,
because of his age and experience, to carry America's standard in the opening
day's ceremonies. If he goes over again this year they'll have to let him
occupy the Presidential box with Poincare and Georges Carpentier.
