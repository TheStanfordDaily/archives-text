# LOST AND FOUND BUREAU REVEALS COLLEGE LIFE
## 
### 
The new lost and found bureau es
tablished at the University of Oregon
has acquired a marvelous collection
of articles in its first week of running.
If it continues its present growth
there is some conjecture as to when
the collection will outgrow the build
ing. The wets seem to be in the lead
as ten umbrellas and numerous rub
; bers are among the unclaimed.
