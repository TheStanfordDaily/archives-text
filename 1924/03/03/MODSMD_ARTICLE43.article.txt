# Miss Handy to Manage Roble, Encina, Branner, And Union Next Autumn
## 
### 
Running on a cost basis, Miss Etta
Handy will manage Roble, Encina,
Branner halls, and the Union next
fall. She has been in charge of the
Union since it opened.
Roble will be under a student board
of control, similar to that of Encina,
and the women on the board will de
termine the monthly bills on the basis
of cost of materials. A trained dietician
will plan the meals.
Purchasing will be done through
one office, thus gaining the advan
tages of large quantity buying. Sup
plies will be distributed as needed. A
central butcher shop will be opened
at Encina to serve the campus.
Miss Handy has beeu at Stanford
for two years. She arrived before the
Union was opened and helped furnish
the lobbies and guest room there. She
also selected furnishings for the lob
bies, dining rooms, and kitchens of
Toyon and Branner halls.
Before coming here, she was head
of the Division of Industrial Manage
ment in the College of Home Eco
nomics at Washington State College,
where she instructed and did execu
tive work. Miss Handy was also state
dietician, appointed by the govern
ment.
