# U. C. SETS UP INFIRMARY FOR OVER-WORKED STUDENTS
## 
### 
Action is to be taken by the University
Infirmary and administrative offices to
apprehend and protect students from ill
health resulting from overwork of any
kind. This action is said to have been
brought about by the recent disappear
ance of two University students, which
was caused by these students laboring un
der excess academic burdens. It is now
the aim of the Infirmary, assisted by the
office of the Recorder and the Dean of
Men, to give careful attention to all stu
dents carrying work of any kind that
would tend to undermine their health.
The new measure is not being taken to
scare anyone out of carrying the work
he wishes, but rather to encourage and
protect the student who undertakes extra
work in the pursuit of knowledge.

Because of the difference in scale,
Chinese music does not appeal to
western ears as it did to Confucius,
who records that after listening to a
certain melody he was so affected as
not to he able to taste meat for three
months.
