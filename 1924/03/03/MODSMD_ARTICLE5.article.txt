## 
### 
Freshmen swimmers paddled away

second places in the California frosh
meet.

the exception of the 50-yard dash which i
was won by Doerr in 0:26 1-5, and the j
100-yard breast stroke won by Cundall
of Alameda in 1:19 2-5. This latter race

by the absence of Stewart, Fletcher,
Sibbett, Goodwin, and Newhouse. All
of these men had taken either first or
second places in the California frosh
meet.
The times were decidedly slow with
the exception of the 50-yard dash which i
was won by Doerr in 0:26 1-5, and the j
100-yard breast stroke won by Cundall
of Alameda in 1:19 2-5. This latter race
was the most exciting one of the morn
ing, Cundall, the C. I. F. champion, and
Hanley coming neck and neck down
the home stretch. At the finish line,
Hanley was a bare few inches behind
Cundall.
