N. C. Hanks, of Sunshine Heights,
Buriey, Idaho, third cousin of Abra
ham Lincoln, will talk on "My Per
sonal Experiences as a Student" at
4:15 Wednesday afternoon in the Lit
tle Theatre.
Hanks, who is without either hands
or eyes, is an example of success at
tained only by the greatest courage
and determination in the face of al
most insurmountable difficulties.
Twenty years ago he was blown
forty feet in the air by a dynamite
explosion in a silver mine, and. as a
result of this accident, lost his hands
and sight, and was confined to his bed
for two years.
Studied at Stanford
Determined to become a lecturer,
Hanks paid his way through school
by giving talks. He studied for seven
years in a school of oratory in Utah,
four years at Stanford, and two years
at Harvard.
Hanks now gives lectures all over
the country, and has established a
worthy reputation. According to thi
Cambridge Tribune, he is known
everywhere in this fcountry and in
Canada, and combines a "quaint hu
mor with a rare pathos in a manner
that drives home a lesson for all who
hear him."
