# PAGEANT TRYOUTS FOR ACTING ROLES DRAW GOOD CROWD
## Joint Trials for Actresses and Dancers of Fiesta to Be Continued Today 
### 
About seventy women reported in
the Assembly hall last night to try
out for acting parts in the spring fiesta,
"The Legend of the Laurel."
A joint tryout for actresses and
dancers will be held this afternoon
from 5 to 6 at Roble gymnasium. The
dancing tryouts will be continue this
evening in the women's gymnasium
from 7 to 10 p.m.
Over 100 women will take an active
part in the pageant itself. The large
cast affords an unusually large num
ber of dancing and acting roles. Those
not participating in the pageant proper
will work on the numerous commit
tees connected with the production.
Women who will play for rehearsals
are especially needed.
All women, including freshmen, are
eligible for tryouts. The fiesta will not
count as a dramatic production but
as an activity, and so women who par
ticipate in the pageant will not be de
barred from the Junior Opera.
