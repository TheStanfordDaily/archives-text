# DEBATERS' TRIP IS REFUSED SANCTION OF EX COMMITTEE
## Two-Man Team Is Now on Way to Tri-State Match At Washington 
### 
"M. S. C. That, because of the action
taken by the Tri-State debating team
in assuming the financial obligations
of the trip to Washington, over the
heads, of the Executive Committee,
that the Executive Committee refuse
the amount, to-wit: $215, which they
now ask for the trip."
The above motion, passed by the
Executive Committee in special ses
sion at 1 o'clock today, definitely
places the responsibility for the re
fusal 011 the action of the debate mana
ger.
The two-man debate team left last
night for Washington in spite of being
informed yesterday that no finances
could be granted without a meeting of
the Executive Cpmmittee.
Today debate representatives ap
peared before the Executive Commit
tee and appealed to the Committee
to relieve the departed team of the
financial burden of the trip.
A hot extemporaneous debate fol
lowed. It was brought out that the
activity of debating had already re
ceived more financial support from the
Executive Committee than any other
activity aided by the A. S. S. U., and
that a budget turned in by the debate
manager at the beginning of the year,
for $500, was turned down with in
structions to the manager to turn in
another for a lower amount. No fur
ther word has been received from the
debate manager until today, when the
manager, who is one of the team now
on its way north, was represented by
the two other debaters who appeared
before the Committee.
The team could have left tonight to
arrive in Seattle in plenty of time for
the debate. This was determined from
the Southern Pacific time schedule.
The Executive Committee made it
clear to the debate representatives
that refusal of the sum was on account
of gross irregularity and the "big
stick" methods used in attempting to
get the sum.
Support for debate, which is grant
ed more funds than any other activity,
will continue as strong as before, ac
cording to the unanimous opinion of
the Executive Committee, but the
finances will have to be handled more
systematically.
