# BABES WILL PLAY PALO ALTO NINE
## Freshmen Expected to Stage Comeback on Thursday Against Prep Team 
### 
With a determination to "come
back" after their poor showing against
the Alameda high school last Satur
day, the Stanford frosh nine will
tackle the Palo Alto high school team
at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon on the
Stanford diamond.
The strength of the Palo Alto team
is still unknown as it is just starting
its season, but it is expected to show
its usual good form again this year.
Last year's yearlings had a hard job
downing the home town "prep" school.
Coach "Husky" Hunt expects to use
two new men on the mound in tomor
row's game. Riese will probably start
the game with Linquist relieving him
during the last few innings.
Riese has been on the squad a week
and has four hits to his credit out of
four times at bat. Linquist has been
playing a consistent game on second
base for the past two weeks.
The catcher's position will be filled
by either Scherer or Stewart as Bail
ard is out of the game with an injured
hand. Otherwise the regular line-up
will start the game.
