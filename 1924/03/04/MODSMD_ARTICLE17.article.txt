# SANTA CLARA AND STANFORD NINES MEET TOMORROW
## Wolter Will Start Either Teague or Solomon in Pitcher's Box 
### 
The first intercollegiate ball game
of the season will be played tomorrow,
when the varsity battles Santa Clara
on the latter's home grounds.
Little is known of the Saints except,
that their infield works together
smoothly and that the batting power
of the team is concentrated to a great
part in the outfielders.
Olympics Win From Saints
The Olympic Club turned in two
wins over the Saints, but two pitchers
have been added to the Catholic squad
since the disbanding of the basketball
team. Since the box was their big
weakness In early season games, a
much stronger team should face Stan
ford tomorrow.
Teague or Solomon to Start
Coach Harry Wolters will probably
start either Solomon or Teague
against the Missionites. The remain
der of the lineup will be composed of
the same performers who have been
working together the past few weeks.
Next Saturday the varsity will take
the Olympics on for the third game
of the annual series, both of the others
having gone to the Cards. Santa Clara
will visit the campus for a return
game Wednesday, March 12.
The Pittsburgh Pirates have been
signed to show the Cards how baseball
is played in the majors, and will work
out on the varsity field on Saturday,
the 22d, the day following the last
finals.
