# University or High School?
## 
### 
Whether a university is really a university or only a high school is a
question that is becoming more and more pressing as political affairs in
the world outside our campus hurrv on, complex and troublous. If what
is seen and heard is a correct index to the present student thought, that
thought is almost wholly self-centered on local affairs, and is entirely un
concerned with those problems which it will have to face in one—or four
—years more when it shifts to the thought of the man who must help with
the world's problems.
That shifting usually takes place at graduation, or shortly after. Why
it does not occur four, or at least two, years earlier is a question as yet un
answered. Suppose it did. The world would have at its disposal, to aid in
solving its puzzles, a large part of two years of thought produced by the
thousands of university students throughout the land. These students
have far more time to devote to the study of remedying the world's ills than
has the young non-university man who must earn his living.
The world will not be aided in this way, however, until we in the uni
versities omit a large part of our discussions of local topics, and turn our
thoughts to more important things. The bulk of the talk that constantly
circulates around the campus is futile, of no lasting good, and indicates
the whirling of well-greased wheels in heads whose interiors are shaped
in accordance with narrow and strictly traditional designs.
History shows us that steps forward toward a pleasanter world have
been steps in violation of honored traditions. It has been our university
tradition, as undergraduates, to be loyal to our alma mater, and to be so
completely absorbed in that loyalty as to forget other more important
things. Perhaps it will taste better if we say that our loyalty to Stanford
should be broadened out, to include subjects' we now neglect.
It is presumed that Senator Stanford founded this university in the
hope that it might be one of the leaders in the van of the army of the
earth which has as its goal a continually better and better world. What
the old gentleman would think were he alive to see and hear the one-sided
ness of the campus life today, is of course conjecture; but it is conjecture
which provokes serious thought.

Walter Christie, track coach at the University of California, has been
appointed to take charge of entrants in the field events on the American
Olympic games track squad.
The appointment of Christie does not come as a surprise to anyone who
has followed sports on the Pacific Coast for the past four years. He has
turned out championship teams at California, consistently.
Not only is Christie's appointment a tribute to his ability, but it is in
the nature of a recognition of Pacific Coast athletics.
Stanford and California will undoubtedly contribute heavily to the
American track team at the Olympic games. As the California coach will
have complete charge of chosing the entrants in the field events, the western
universities are assured of a fair chance.
Athletes representing Pacific Coast universities have long merited
recognition but have seldom gotten it. Washington in crew, California in
track and football, and Stanford through her contributions to other Olym
pic games teams, have made the east realize that athletics in far-western
universities are on a high plane.
Christie's appointment looks like the beginning of the long waited-for
recognition.
