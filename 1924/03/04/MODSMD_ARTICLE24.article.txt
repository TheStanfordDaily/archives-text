Socialists rise and Republicans howl
As election time draws near.
Democrats sing, and Bolshevists prowl
As unwary votes appear.
Cigars are passed with elucidation,
• By sleek Republican pesterer,
Promises made of intoxication,
By fat old Democrat gesturer.
A wide-world move of co-operation,
Says the skinny Socialist polisher,
And dreams of complete annihilation,
Assured by Bolsheviky demolisher.
But the world rolls by with a wary eye,
Untroubled with threats and cam
paigning,
Platforms blacken and pulled ropes
slacken,
As the old globe rolls on, uncom
plaining.

Oh! Up and away,
For Sprig ab here.
A young man's fancy
Turns to Beer —
There is no beer.
Oh! Up and away,
With harp and lute.
Dance with the girlies,
Ah! So cute.
They're not so cute.
Oh! Up and away,
That's what the registrar said!
