# TICKETS FOR CADET FORMAL ARE TO BE RELEASED THURSDAY
## 
### 
Tickets for the military ball on
April 4 will be sold Thursday after
noon only, in the Bookstore. The early
sale is made necessary by the fact
that the Ball is to be given on the
first Friday of the Spring quarter so
the tickets must be sold this term.
Two hundred couples will be ad
mitted to this affair which is givon
annually by the Military department.
Since there are nearly that number
registered in the R. O. T. C. only a
limited number of tickets will be open
to the general public, according to
Glen Barnes, chairman of the dance
committee.
The ball will have a decided mili
tary atmosphere. Hundreds of flags
have been secured to serve as decora
tions while some of the local artillery
material will be placed around the
floor to further carry out the effect.
Uniforms will be the proper dress
for the evening for the cadets and
officers that attend. Tickets will sell
for $3.50.
