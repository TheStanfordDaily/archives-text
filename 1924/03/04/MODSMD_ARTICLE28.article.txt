# WELLESLEY WOMEN HAVE SPECIAL MAIL SERVICE
## 
### 
Wellesley College girls received 2969
special delivery letters in a period
of two weeks last month. The post
office at times received as many as
250 special deliveries in a single day,
and the postoffice officials state that
one Wellesley girl requires as much
service as "ten citizens."
Three frantic postoffice carriers own
ing and operating their own cars de
liver the mail each day.

Thirty-three students formed the
total number of those dropped from
the University of Oregon for flunking
their first semester work.

Average schedule speed of a city
street car is 11 miles an hour.
