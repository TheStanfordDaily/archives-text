# FOUR CLASSES WILL VIE IN INTERCLASS TRACK COMPETITION
## Stadium to Be Initiated as Track Oval; Hartranft May Not Compete 
### Wallace Knox 
Track stars from each class will vie !
with each other for honors Saturday 1
afternoon in the annual interclass
track and field meet.
The meet will be held in the sta
dium. This will be the first time the
stadium has been used for a regular
track meet, and will probably be the
only preliminary meet this year that
will be held on the new track. All of
the other meets are scheduled for the
varsity oval.
Practically every varsity and fresh- j
man squad possibility will take part. |
"Tiny" Hartranft, leading shot and ;
discus man, may not compete, due to
the fact that his throwing arm is in j
bad shape. With Hartranft out the ;
lesser lights will have some , close
competition for first place in the two
weight events.
440 On One Turn
If the weather clears up excellent
times should be made in all of the
track events. The Stanford record
most likely to be smashed will be the
440-yard dash. A new plan is being
inaugurated in this event, namely, i
that it will be run around only one
curve. This will eliminate the possi
bility* of the runners getting boxed.
Storie is the man most likely to lower
the former mark. He was credited with

I :49 1-5 in the Irish Marathon last
J week, and may get down even lower
Saturday. The fact that he was not
pressed in the marathon is offset by
his having a running start.
First place should be contested for
by the seniors and juniors, with odds
favoring the fourth-year men. The sen
iors won the Irish Marathon, which
gives them ten points towards the' in
terclass title. The sophomores are not
expected to take more than fifteen
points, while the freshmen remain an
unknown quantity.
