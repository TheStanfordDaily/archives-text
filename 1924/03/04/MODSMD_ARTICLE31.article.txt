## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY OF STANFORD'S BUILDINGS No.6. SEQUOIA HALL 
### Esther Greenacre 
For almost thirty years the hall now
known as Sequoia served as a dormi
tory for women. Encina and old Roble,
or Sequoia, were the only two dormi
tories on the campus when the Uni
versity opened in 1891.
As originally planned, women were
not to be admitted to Stanford when
the University first opened, as Mrs.
Stanford wished to have a large dor
mitory similar to"Encina built for their
occupancy. However, President Jor
dan was convinced that the women
should enter the University when the
institution first opened, in order that
their admittance should not appear an
after-thought and their relation should
not seem that of a small addition to
j the original organization. Mrs. Stan
ford agreed with President Jordan's
j idea and the construction of the pres
ent Sequoia hall was rushed through
1 during the three months preceding
! October 1, 1891.
Roble was the second campus build
s ing to be built of reinforced concrete.
Inasmuch as speed was the main ele
ment in building the hall, recourse
was had to the then recently patented
: 'Ransome Process," or the use of re
j inforced concrete. The museum was
the first building to be made of this
j material. Both the. museum and Se
quoia were constructed of crushed
sandstone clippings from the Quad
rangle and Encina.
In 1891 the number of students en
! tering Stanford was 465, about 350 of
I whom were freshmen. In its original
! form, Encina held 300 men. About
: eight years ago the basement was
made into accommodations for stu
dents, increasing the capacity to 450
men.
When first opened. Encina was not
under student government but was in
charge of a "master.". The first master
was Bert Fesler, a graduate of Indiana
University and now a judge in Wis
consin. The dining room was leased
to private individuals and was a con
stant cause of much complaint. George
Adderson, formerly an English butler,
was first in charge of the boarding ar
rangements at Encina. Adderson was
a big, gruff man with a rough exterior
but a kindly heart, and he was both
feared and loved by the men. His
most common title on the campus was
that of "Santa Claus." Mrs. Stanford
finally gave up the dining room in En-

cina and built the Stanford Inn be
tween the library and art gallery. The
Inn was leased to private individuals
but was quite a popular boarding
place.
Matron Similar to Dean
The matron of old Roble for several
years held a position almost equiva
lent to that of Dean of Women, there
being no dean until 1905. As originally
planned, the women were to have
been housed in a large dormitory simi
lar to Encina in style and situated a
little west of the present Sequoia.
However, this plan was abandoned
when hasty construction of a hall be
came necessary. Encina, in its general
elevation, repeats on a large sca'e the
plan of a finely situated hotel at Silva
Plana in the Swiss Engadine where
the Stanfords once spent a happy holi
day.
Accommodations in men's dormi
tories have now. been increased to
about 850 students, not including
those who room at the Union or En-:
cina. Branner and Toyon together hold I
750 men while Sequoia accommodates j
100.

A sorority house at Missouri uni
versity claim to have a cat and a
toad who are the best o friends. At cer- 1
tain timÂ«s of the day they play to
gether, the cat using the toad for a
ball.

There are about 10,000 commercial
coal mines in the United States.
