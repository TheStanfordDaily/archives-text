# FOUR-WHEEL BRAKES NOT NEW INVENTION
## 
### 
Four-wheel brakes are not new by
any means, in fact; they are some 15
years old. At least so says Edward J.
Jordan, head of the motor company of
that name and one of the pioneers of
the industry.
"Fifteen years ago they appeared on
a fine car of British make," states
Jordan. "My first introduction to them,
however, occurred four years ago
when I rode through the Bois de Bou
logne of Paris in a wonderful car
equipped with four-wheel brakes at
sixty miles an hour, taking the turns
at high speed (to prove the brakes'
efficiency)—without sliding—and, of
course, got arrested."
Jordan went on to explain that the
French brakes were mechanical but,
while he felt that they were all O. K.
in the hands of an expert European
chauffeur, they were hardly suitable
for America, where an owner might
get into constant trouble.
Then came the hydraulic brake, and
Jordan, having become convinced that
the American public really wanted
four-wheel brakes, offered them (as
optional equipment) hydraulic four
wheel brakes on his cars.
