# PENINSULAR POLO TEAMS WILL PLAY FOR CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### 
Eight teams will participate in the
Peninsular Polo tournament at Stan
ford from March 17 to 29. The teams
now entered for the coming contest,
the first of its kind to be held at Stan
ford, include the 11th Cavalry, and the
76th Field Artillery of Monterey, the
Santa Cruz Junior and the Santa Cruz
Senior teams, the Berkeley Polo Club,
the 30th Infantry team of the Presidio,
San Francisco, the Peninsular Free
booters, and the Stanford University
four.
Schedule of play in the tournament
and final arrangements for the com
ing contests will be handled at a
meeting of the representatives of the
various teams planned for Saturday at
the Military Headquarters.
Two Stanford players will be in
cluded in the lineup of the Peninsular
Freebooters. Taylor and Tremaine
have been selected along with two
mallet swingers of the 30th Infantry
to play on the Freebooter four. Cap
tain Charles Boyle will take the place
of John Irwin in the Stanford lineup
for the coming games.
Captain Boyle is optimistic as to
the outcome of the tournament, and
figures that the Cards have a fair
chance to take both events which in
clude open and handicap champion
ship. The Stanford four will have the
highest handicap of the teams entered
in the tournament.
In view of this handicap, the local
team is perfecting its offensive work
along with special attention to mallet
practice. Dry weather has made pos
sible an increased amount of prepara
tion and the Cards should be in good
form at the opening of the tournament
March 17.
