# GLEE CLUB TO GIVE CONCERT AND DANCE ON CAMPUS FRIDAY
## 
### 
Admission prices to the annual cam
pus concert of the Glee Club have
been reduced to get as large a num
ber of students as possible in the
Assembly hall next Friday night. The
Club will sing practically the same
program that it will present for its
six-day engagement at the Ambassa
dor hotel, Los Angeles, during its
southern tour in the spring vacation.
After the concert the club will give
a dance in the Women's Clubhouse.
Friday night is a closed date for the
Glee Club and the dance will be one
of the last of the quarter. Stubs from
concert tickets, if presented at the
door, will secure admission at fifty
cents a couple. Otherwise the custom
ary dollar will be charged. The Mertz-
Alabaster orchestra will furnish the
music.
The Glee Club will participate in
Stanford Day at Bakersfield high
school on March 24, when the alumni
present the stadium trophy to the
state champion high school football
team. On its southern tour, the club
will probably sing in five high schools,
including schools in Hollywood, Los
Angeles, Pasadena, and Glendale.
