# Plans For Improvement Of Arboretum Outlined In President's Report
## 
### 
Plans for the improvement of the
Arboretum are outlined by Comptrol
ler Roth in the President's Annual
Report which has just been issued.
The plans are a result of the efforts
of Gardiner Dailey, a former Stanford
| student and landscape architect, Pro
| fessor Le√üoy Abrams, and John Mc-
Laren, superintendent of Golden Gate
S Park. The trees already growing in
the Arboretum have been located on
j maps and all future planting will be
done scientifically about these as a
| nucleus.
Some of the half-dead fan palms
1 along Palm Avenue have been re
moved and it is planned to take out
the rest this year. They will probably
be replaced by young live oaks which
are now being raised in the University
nurseries. The date palms will remain
for tho present.
In discusing. the plans, Comptroller
Roth said, that it is hoped that some
day there may be established at Stan
ford one of the greatest botanical gar
dens in the world.
