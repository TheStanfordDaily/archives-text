# OLD BOY GOES FISHING; WOMEN EDIT CHAPPIE
## 
### 
Spring fever has hit the Old Boy j
rather hard this year. In fact, he com- j
pletely deserted the campus, and I
sneaked off on a fishing trip. What was
to be done? Leave the suffering stu
dents without their monthly quota of:
laughter? Never! Theta Sigma Phi |
has nobly come to the rescue, and en- j
listed the aid of all the lady artists
and humorists on the campus, with j
the result that Chappie will make his ;
appearance on Thursday as gaily as j
every, looking as sweet as a Ram's i
Head chorus lady.
Spring fever hit the lady journalists,'
too, as they were gathering in copy,!
and consequently the spirit of spring
will fill Chappie's pages. What more j
could you ask?
