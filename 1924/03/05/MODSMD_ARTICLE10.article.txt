# USE OF ORAL CODES SOLVES TELEPATHY
## Performers Vary Their Questions In Order to Give Key Words Says Professor Coover 
### Barbara Milter 
Mental telepathy performances are
really based upon an Intricate system
of codes, according to Professor John
E. Coover, of the psychology depart
ment.
"Oral codes are often of a disarming
nature and appear perfectly natural
as a part of the patter of the per
former," said Professor Coover, "One
member of the team acts us the agent
and asks such a question as, 'What is
this?' or 'Can you tell what this is?'
By varying the wording he tells the
percipient what to answer."
Example of Code
The following conversation is char
acteristic of the method followed:
"That's right. Can you name this
here?" questions the man who circu
lates through the audience, collecting
articles.
"Certainly. It is a Greek letter fra
ternity pin," responds the blindfolded
seeress 011 the stage.
"See the monogram. What —be
quick!
"Yes. It is 'Tlieta Nu Epsilon'."

r* i. r." p " 1 'TTir
The code appears complicated to the
uninitiated, but may be learned in six
months if one possesses a nimble and
j retentive memory. An explanation of
| the above seemingly miraculous identi
j fleation will show how it works.
"That's right" is merely code for
the fact that this article belongs in
the same list as the one last identified
and need not be recorded. "Can you
| name" is number five in the list, which
is a pin, and "here" is the word for a
| sub-list indicating what kind of a pin,
a Greek letter fraternity. "See" is
! number eight, "what" is number tliir
| teen, and "Be quick" is number five in
1 the code for the Greek alphabet. And
Jso that seemingly innocent question
contains in it the Greek letters, "Theta
! Nu Epsilon."
Coover Investigates
In 191 f> Professor Coover was "pes
' tered" by faculty and students to sef
1 a stunt presented on the Zone ut the
1 .San Francisco Exposition, where
| telepathy was "on tap all the time
1 and always right." The -entertainers
were booked as "The Ellises, Mind
Readers Supreme." Coover finally con
sented to hear them.
He says, "I found that it was an
oral code, straight through. In order
to give the campus public a chance to
see what a code might do, I just fabri
cated a section for the November num
ber of the Stanford Sequoia. The com
mon acceptance of the truth of the
act indicates how readily an audience
overlooks the significance of varied
but apparently natural questions."
His Idea Verified
Professor Coover's suggestion was
verified by two men from the Univer
sity who went to the performances six
times, taking as complete stenographic
notes as possible. From these they
worked out a definite code, which was
revealed in an article in the Daily Palo
Alto Times. Madame Ellis, the gifted
seeress, took exception to the state
ments concerning her act, and wrote
a heated letter to the Times.
Entertainment an End
"They were clever entertainers and
were not 'in search of the truth. Nei
ther were they obliged to tell how
they got the result. The Ellises ful
filled their function, as do all artists,
when they divert the audience," ex
plained the professor.

Coover Investigates
In 191 f> Professor Coover was "pes
' tered" by faculty and students to sef
1 a stunt presented on the Zone ut the
1 .San Francisco Exposition, where
| telepathy was "on tap all the time
1 and always right." The -entertainers
were booked as "The Ellises, Mind
Readers Supreme." Coover finally con
sented to hear them.
He says, "I found that it was an
oral code, straight through. In order
to give the campus public a chance to
see what a code might do, I just fabri
cated a section for the November num
ber of the Stanford Sequoia. The com
mon acceptance of the truth of the
act indicates how readily an audience
overlooks the significance of varied
but apparently natural questions."
His Idea Verified
Professor Coover's suggestion was
verified by two men from the Univer
sity who went to the performances six
times, taking as complete stenographic
notes as possible. From these they
worked out a definite code, which was
revealed in an article in the Daily Palo
Alto Times. Madame Ellis, the gifted
seeress, took exception to the state
ments concerning her act, and wrote
a heated letter to the Times.
Entertainment an End
"They were clever entertainers and
were not 'in search of the truth. Nei
ther were they obliged to tell how
they got the result. The Ellises ful
filled their function, as do all artists,
when they divert the audience," ex
plained the professor.
Mental telepathy performances are
really based upon an Intricate system
of codes, according to Professor John
E. Coover, of the psychology depart
ment.
"Oral codes are often of a disarming
nature and appear perfectly natural
as a part of the patter of the per
former," said Professor Coover, "One
member of the team acts us the agent
and asks such a question as, 'What is
this?' or 'Can you tell what this is?'
By varying the wording he tells the
percipient what to answer."
Example of Code
The following conversation is char
acteristic of the method followed:
"That's right. Can you name this
here?" questions the man who circu
lates through the audience, collecting
articles.
"Certainly. It is a Greek letter fra
ternity pin," responds the blindfolded
seeress 011 the stage.
"See the monogram. What —be
quick!
"Yes. It is 'Tlieta Nu Epsilon'."

r* i. r." p " 1 'TTir
The code appears complicated to the
uninitiated, but may be learned in six
months if one possesses a nimble and
j retentive memory. An explanation of
| the above seemingly miraculous identi
j fleation will show how it works.
"That's right" is merely code for
the fact that this article belongs in
the same list as the one last identified
and need not be recorded. "Can you
| name" is number five in the list, which
is a pin, and "here" is the word for a
| sub-list indicating what kind of a pin,
