# WATER POLO TEAM MEETS WINGED '0' SATURDAY
## Club Will Send Formidable Aggregation of Stars Against Cards 
### 
Stanford water poloists will meet the
Olympic Club Saturday morning at
Sutro baths for the Pacific Coast cham
pionship. They are to play for a $2,000
purse to pay the expenses of the win
ning team to the National champion
ships at Chicago.
The Club team is a big, heavy, fast
traveling aggregation and have had a
world of experience. Many of them
have played together as juniors, and
later as club members, for the past five
years. Stieger, goal keeper, and Gard
ner, captain, played on the 1920 cham
pionship team.
Bear Stars on Club Seven
Mitchell and Herrington, two stars
of this year's California seven will both
be on the winged "O" line-up. Carson
was the sprint man on the team that
represented the United States in the
last Olympic games. In Schroth, their
230-pound guard, the Club has one of
the best defensive backs in the country.
The Stanford seven, however, is by
no means a green team. With the ex
ception of Allen, the star of last year's
freshman team, every man on the var
sity is a veteran. Fletcher, O'Connor,
McCallister, Schmieder, Collett, and
Meyers all played on the team which
made such a good showing at the Na
tional Championships at Chicago last
1 year.
| Man for man the teams are about on
, a par and the decisive way in which
j the Stanford water poloists trounced
'the Bears last Friday makes for a
[ closer and more bitterly fought game.
In the Bruin game, Stanford played
only straight water polo and it is the
consensus of opinion that they did not
show all their tricks. They played a
strong aggressive game keeping the
Bears continually on the defensive.
Tickets for the game are on sale at
the Administration building, and En
cina pool. The price is fifty cents.
The proceeds are to go in the Oylmpic
game fund which will pay the expenses
of American athletes to the games in
Europe.
