# SUCCESS MEASURED IN TERMS OF ONE'S PERSONALITY-BITTING
## Declares That Experience Is Finishing of Task and Profiting From It 
### 
Success is measured in terras of per
sonality, and should not be judged by
what a man has in his pocket, accord
ing to Dr. William C. Bitting of the
Second Baptist Church. St. Louis, Mis
rouri, who spoke on 'The Beyond That
Is Within," last night in the Assembly
hall.
There are two great moments in
life, thinks Dr. Bitting. "The first is
when you wake up to the fact that
you would rather b-e yourself than any
one else.
"The second is when you come to
Ihe conclusion that there is somebody
else in the world besides yourself. You
must realize that the personality of
another is as sacred as your own. and
that you have no right to demand
more respect from others than you
want to give them.
"Success is the approximation of at
tainment to possibilities." Bitting ad
vises everyone to take time to find out
what he can do best. 'It is common
sense," he says, "that everyone does
best what he was made to do."
"Misfits" Are Tragic
The two most incurable diseases in
the world are. according to Bitting,
ihe "misfits and counterfeits." The
world is not richer for these men who
are, in his opinion, "the cheap c.hromos
of great masters."
"Education is defined in terms of
personality, not knowledge," said Bit
ting. "In the process of education,
criticism from friends is priceless."
Experience means going through
something, and coming out with some
thing gained. We must not be like
the man who had "experiences, but
no experience."
"Isolation is the great secret of our
lives, and from it comes the develop
ment of all achievement and person
ality," claimed Bitting.
