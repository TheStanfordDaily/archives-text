# A 						Mess
## 
### 
Last January, the debating manager submitted a budget of something
like five hundred dollars for the approval of the Executive Committee.
The committee did not see fit to expend that much money on debating and
rejected the budget.
The debating manager was not officially notified of the action of the
Executive Committee. According to the schedule of the Tri-State Debate,
a Stanford team is to meet a team from the University of Washington at
Seattle Thursday night. The two-man team left Palo Alto for the north
Monday night.
Those two debaters, one of whom is the debating manager, took mat
ters entirely into their own hands. They started on a trip without either
having had the date of the debate approved or having their expenses guar
anteed. Which is a rather high-handed procedure.
The whole trouble goes back to January when the budget was first
brought up and disapproved. In the first place, the debating manager was
not officially notified of the action of the Executive Committee. It is quite
evident that some one on the committee slipped up in this matter. On the
other hand, it seems perfectly logical that, if the debating manager was at
all interested in his activity, he would have investigated the situation to see
what disposition had been made of his proposal.
Monday, a few hours before the two men were to leave for the north,
the debating manager inquired if the money for the trip was ready. No
one on the Executive Committee knew that the time for the trip was so
near and an attempt was made to call a special meeting. Because of the
illness of one member and because other members were not available, it was
impossible to get a quorum.
The debating manager knew about the situation and, with his col
league, took matters into his own hands, advanced the money, and left as
per schedule. Investigation shows that it was unnecessary for the de
baters to leave until last night. By leaving last night, they would have
gotten to their destination Thursday morning, twelve or more hours be
fore the debate.
And now the question arises, from where is the money for the trip to
come? The men who advanced the money at the mercy of the
Executive Committee. What would happen if athletic teams tried the
same kind of a stall? We might conceive of a lot of undesirable things
happening in such a situation.
And now, there is another side to the situation. As long as debating is
a recognized activity, it should be supported by the student body, espe
cially in such a well-recognized event as the annual Tri-State debate. And
yet, how can any organization or activity expect support after such high
handed proceedings ?
It is not the first time the debaters have offended in the same way. Last
quarter, when they went to Los Angeles to debate against U. S. C., they
tried the same kind of a procedure. It was necessary to approve the trip
on the afternoon the team was to leave.
As far as support is concerned, the debaters are getting more of it
through the Executive Committee than any other activity. Already this
college year they have used $236.00.
The whole situation is a mess and resolves itself into the question ag to
the Executive Committee or individual activities and organiza
tions are going to run student affairs. The constitution states that the
committee is all-powerful in student affairs. If we are going to depart
from the older and saner way of doing things, we might just as well do
away with the Executive Committee and allow anyone who sees fit to take
things into his own hands.
It happens, with the tightening down of regulations in the past few
weeks, that the debaters have stuck their heads into the noose twice. And
still they complain of lack of support. Possibly if they would back up for
a moment and get into step they would find the student body as a whole
and the Executive Committee, in particular, easier to get along with.

rejected the budget.
The debating manager was not officially notified of the action of the
Executive Committee. According to the schedule of the Tri-State Debate,
a Stanford team is to meet a team from the University of Washington at
Seattle Thursday night. The two-man team left Palo Alto for the north
Monday night.
Those two debaters, one of whom is the debating manager, took mat
ters entirely into their own hands. They started on a trip without either
having had the date of the debate approved or having their expenses guar
anteed. Which is a rather high-handed procedure.
The whole trouble goes back to January when the budget was first
brought up and disapproved. In the first place, the debating manager was
not officially notified of the action of the Executive Committee. It is quite
evident that some one on the committee slipped up in this matter. On the
other hand, it seems perfectly logical that, if the debating manager was at
all interested in his activity, he would have investigated the situation to see
what disposition had been made of his proposal.
Monday, a few hours before the two men were to leave for the north,
the debating manager inquired if the money for the trip was ready. No
one on the Executive Committee knew that the time for the trip was so
near and an attempt was made to call a special meeting. Because of the
illness of one member and because other members were not available, it was
impossible to get a quorum.
The debating manager knew about the situation and, with his col
league, took matters into his own hands, advanced the money, and left as
per schedule. Investigation shows that it was unnecessary for the de
baters to leave until last night. By leaving last night, they would have
gotten to their destination Thursday morning, twelve or more hours be
fore the debate.
And now the question arises, from where is the money for the trip to
come? The men who advanced the money at the mercy of the
Executive Committee. What would happen if athletic teams tried the
same kind of a stall? We might conceive of a lot of undesirable things
happening in such a situation.
And now, there is another side to the situation. As long as debating is
a recognized activity, it should be supported by the student body, espe
cially in such a well-recognized event as the annual Tri-State debate. And
yet, how can any organization or activity expect support after such high
handed proceedings ?
It is not the first time the debaters have offended in the same way. Last
quarter, when they went to Los Angeles to debate against U. S. C., they
tried the same kind of a procedure. It was necessary to approve the trip
on the afternoon the team was to leave.
As far as support is concerned, the debaters are getting more of it
through the Executive Committee than any other activity. Already this
college year they have used $236.00.
The whole situation is a mess and resolves itself into the question ag to
the Executive Committee or individual activities and organiza
tions are going to run student affairs. The constitution states that the
committee is all-powerful in student affairs. If we are going to depart
from the older and saner way of doing things, we might just as well do
away with the Executive Committee and allow anyone who sees fit to take
things into his own hands.
It happens, with the tightening down of regulations in the past few
weeks, that the debaters have stuck their heads into the noose twice. And
still they complain of lack of support. Possibly if they would back up for
a moment and get into step they would find the student body as a whole
and the Executive Committee, in particular, easier to get along with.
Last January, the debating manager submitted a budget of something
like five hundred dollars for the approval of the Executive Committee.
The committee did not see fit to expend that much money on debating and
rejected the budget.
