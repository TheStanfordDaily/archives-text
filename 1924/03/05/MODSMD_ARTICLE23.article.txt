Devil: Well, well, my old friend
"Brick" Morse, and what brings you
here at your young age?
Brick: The curses of the Stanford
boys.
Devil: Nice of them to spare me
your company, and how do you like
your new home?
Morse: It looks like hell to me.
Shut up, we know it's old. But we
couldn't pass up this opportunity to
give "Brick" a little publicity, after all
he's done for us. "Brick" would deny
all of this, but then "Brick" was always
modest about telling the truth.

Oh! the ground is covered with snow,
Maggie,
And the mortgage will soon be due,
The pantry shelves are getting low,
Maggie,
But I'll spare my life for you.
This is no story of fiction or screen,
Maggie,
Where the prodigal son conies home,
Our son is only a fantocine, dear Mag
gie.
And this but a rotten poem.

The heroine turned to the hero in vain,
And pleaded with love in her eyes,
To save her from peril, ravish and
shame,
At the hands of the wily villain.
The hero stood rooted with arms pan
tomimic,
Seeking to free his fair sweetheart,
But he was a statue, Grecian in mold,
And the villain was only a mimic.

We met in a sylvan meadow,
There where the fairies dwell,
But she was going to heaven,
And I was going to work.
Yes, we think so, too.
