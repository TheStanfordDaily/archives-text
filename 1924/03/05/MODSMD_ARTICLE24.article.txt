# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I have the privilege of your j
"Viewpoints" column to make a sug- j
gestion concerning the latest develop- j
ment in a matter about which unfor- J
tunately there has been too much!
booting about of heated opinion, too j
much misunderstanding, and too little j
of a disposition to think reasonably |
before rushing into print. I refer to'
the new difficulty that has arisen over j
the question of debate.
My suggestion is this: that every j
reader of last night's story on the j

action of the Executive Committee re
serve judgment on the matters al
leged therein until Mr. Lewis has re
turned from the north and has had an
opportunity to reply. I feel sure that
his answer —if he cares to answer —
will reveal another ease of misunder
standing and perhaps show that no
particular person is to blame for the
present state of affairs.
Debating has been, and still is for
that matter, in a bad way at Stanford.
Those students concerned in furthering
it have been most disinterested and
loyal in the face of repeated and em
barrassing discouragements. The pre
sent manager has been one of these
and has in his dealings with me been
efficient and fine spirited to the last
degree. I am sure that he would not
deliberately have proceeded with plans
for our usual debate with Washington
had he the slightest notion that finan
cial support to this time-honored ar
rangement was to be withheld.
Nor am I so certain that the act of
the debators in advancing expense
money for the trip (after the Execu
tive Committee had met on Monday
evening and failed, by one, of the
quorum necessary for action) will im
press your readers as being particu
larly criminal. Reservations had been
made for the earlier train; it was not
probable that they could be duplicated
on the later one. Time was short and
one of the debaters was on the verge
of illness. The other positively needed
the rest to condition his none-too-ro
bust voice for the strain of speaking
in a large auditorium. Believe it or not,
a night's undisturbed sleep just pre
vious to the event is as essential to
effective debating as it is to winning
football. And —after all —that is a
matter for the manager, with the
advice of the coach, to decide.

Those students concerned in furthering
it have been most disinterested and
loyal in the face of repeated and em
barrassing discouragements. The pre
sent manager has been one of these
and has in his dealings with me been
efficient and fine spirited to the last
degree. I am sure that he would not
deliberately have proceeded with plans
for our usual debate with Washington
had he the slightest notion that finan
cial support to this time-honored ar
rangement was to be withheld.
Nor am I so certain that the act of
the debators in advancing expense
money for the trip (after the Execu
tive Committee had met on Monday
evening and failed, by one, of the
quorum necessary for action) will im
press your readers as being particu
larly criminal. Reservations had been
made for the earlier train; it was not
probable that they could be duplicated
on the later one. Time was short and
one of the debaters was on the verge
of illness. The other positively needed
the rest to condition his none-too-ro
bust voice for the strain of speaking
in a large auditorium. Believe it or not,
a night's undisturbed sleep just pre
vious to the event is as essential to
effective debating as it is to winning
football. And —after all —that is a
matter for the manager, with the
advice of the coach, to decide.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
May I have the privilege of your j
"Viewpoints" column to make a sug- j
gestion concerning the latest develop- j
ment in a matter about which unfor- J
tunately there has been too much!
booting about of heated opinion, too j
much misunderstanding, and too little j
of a disposition to think reasonably |
before rushing into print. I refer to'
the new difficulty that has arisen over j
the question of debate.
My suggestion is this: that every j
reader of last night's story on the j

action of the Executive Committee re
serve judgment on the matters al
leged therein until Mr. Lewis has re
turned from the north and has had an
opportunity to reply. I feel sure that
his answer —if he cares to answer —
will reveal another ease of misunder
standing and perhaps show that no
particular person is to blame for the
present state of affairs.
Debating has been, and still is for
that matter, in a bad way at Stanford.
