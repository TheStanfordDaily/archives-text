"Look who's here!" said Ebenezer Sourapple, as he peered through the
magnifying glass at two diminutive figures. "Two new pitchers for the
Cincinnati Reds —Jakie May and Carl Mays—ain't this int'resting? May is j
the famous southpaw of the Vernon Tigers who set the Coast league on fire
in 1922 with thirty-five victories."
"And this submarine fellow Mays," piped up Silas, "he hasn't been so good
lately—what's his trouble?"
"Shh—little pitchers have big ears, you know—the trouble with Carl is he
thinks he ought to have been a prize fighter—he's a Bolshevik, so he ought '
to go good with the Reds."
"These two birds have got McGraw worried, and I don't mean May-be."
