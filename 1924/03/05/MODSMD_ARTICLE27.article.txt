# JOURNALISTS AT O. A. C. WILL TUSSLE FOR TITLE
## 
### 
. Hammer and Coffin and Sigma Delta !
Chi will decide the basketball cham
pionship in journalistic circles at Ore-1
gon Agricultural College next week,
when they tangle in their annual I
struggle. Backers of the coffin and !
sledge are rumored to be given odds 1
to the quill shovers' cohorts but the ;
reporters may have something up
their sleeves besides arms, and spring 1
a surprise like they did last year when j
they won from the winged-coffin crew
by one point in the last 30 seconds
of play.
