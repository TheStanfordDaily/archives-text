# Snakes, Roughs Delight Junior Women at Party Given by Class of 1927
## 
### 
Fashion decrees trousers as latest
style for women! Such a statement
would not be surprising to any who
saw the great ease and enthusiasm
with which the youngest women of
the University donned men's clothing
last evening when they played hosts
to the juniors at Roble.
Every type of man was represented,
from the rough to the snake. Even a
Captain Applejack was seen. One man
who wore cords and a sweater bearing
the freshman numerals of '27, also
was seen.
After a dinner at which the young
hosts toasted and were toasted, a
seven to eight dance was given where
all the latest wrinkles of snakedom
were exhibited. Even the Ram's Head
novelty dancing number was well du
plicated by some "tuxedoed" women.
Judging from the number of mus
taches present, the fair sex must con
sider them .either a goo* means of
disguise or an object to be admired.
