## 
### 
Extra! All about the big expose and
riot.
Members of Theta Sigma Phi and
their assistants will greet eight o'clock
travelers on the Quad tomorrow with
a juicy scandal.
1 The secrets of house meetings in a
prominent sorority have been laid
bare: within the covers of the Spring
Fever number of Chappie, on sale to
morrow, Is a complete revelation of
methods, scandals, and mysteries con
nected with a Monday night sorority
session. Nothing has been left out by
the diligent reporter, even to what the
president said after the fight was
over.
Why he did it nobody seems to
know, but Chappie, suffering from a
bad attack of conscience, steps for
ward and offers to cure any one
(who'll risk it) of spring fever. The
cure, sez he, is thirty cents a shot,
and —hist! —it has something to do
with his new course in perpetual mo
tion.
