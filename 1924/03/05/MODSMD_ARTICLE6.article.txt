# WOMAN NET STAR DIVIDES MATCHES WITH VARSITY MEN
## 
### 
Eleanor Goss, third ranking woman J
tennis player of the country, played on ;
the varsity courts yesterday afternoon, â– 
splitting two sets of singles with Dick
Hinkley, 3-6, 6-4; and two sets of dou- j
bles with Mertz as a partner against
Hinkley and Overfelt, 6-4, 4-6.
She has made herself known during
the last three years by defeating sev- !
eral of the most famous women players
of the country, including Helen Wills.
Few people can claim that honor, al
though the little Bcrkelevan came back
and defeated the older woman in the j
National championship last year.
In the first set, Hinkley appeared to ;
have an easy time, but he was com- 1
pletely outplayed in the second. In the ,
doubles, Mertz was the star, showing j
by far the best form he has used this j
season.
Miss Goss is leaving for the East to j
play several exhibition matches before
going to Europe for the Olympic j
games.
