# GLEE CLUB OFFERS CONCERT, DANCE FRIDAY NIGHT
## Student Attendance Will Be Test of Popularity of New Program 
### Ray Spangler 
After nearly two quarters of pre
paration, the Glee Club will give a
concert in the Assembly hall Friday
night, offering a program which
ranges from the beautiful old melodies
of Bach and Palestrina to the rollick
ing tunes of "Old Man Noah" and the
"Three Sea Chanties."
This type of program has enabled
the Glee Club to sing with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra and
the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orches
tra. It has received favorable reviews
from newspaper critics, and has suc
ceeded to the extent that the Ambas
sador hotel in Los Angeles has booked
the club for a six-day engagement in
the spring vacation.
Student Approval Hard to Win
Undergraduate opinion has been the
most difficult to win over to the
changed program. That opinion, ap
proving or disapproving, will be ex
pressed by the student attendance at
Friday's concert. Prices have been re
duced to 75 anu 50 cents, so it will be
a matter of the attractiveness of the
program alone upon which depends
the success of the Glee Club on the
campus.
Dan Evans, '22. wrote a new stunt
for Arnold Bavley last week-end. Bay
ley has since been huntingfl around
the campus for a magnavox and aloud
suit of clothes. But so rar, these are
the only indications of what the new
stunt is. It will be surrounded by utter
mystery until number ten on the pro
gram arrives next Friday night.
Martin D'Andrea, tenor soloist, will
sing some Neapolitan songs. D'An
drea's singing has been an unqualified
success in the early-season concerts.
Malcolm Davison, cellist, and Bol
ton White, violinist, will both give
solos, and play in the string trio with
R. Willis-Porter at the piano.
The concert will open with Bach's
"Now Let Every Tongue," followed by
Improperia's "Palestrina." Both of
these compositions are classics of per
fectly tuned melody. The first num
ber will be completed with "My Bon
nie Lass," by Morley, a lighter, more
rhythmical selection.
Henschel's "Morning Hymn" and
"John Peel," old English, compose the
second number. "Bon Jour Ma Belle,"
"Pirate Dreams," "Toreador Song
from 'Carmen'," the "Volga Boat
Song" and "Drake's Drum" will com
plete the songs to be sung by the Club
as a whole.
Following the concert, the Glee Club
will give a one o'clock dance in the
Women's Clubhouse. Stubs from con
cert tickets, if presented at the door,
will secure admission at fifty cents a
couple. This is the last all-University
dance of the quarter.
Tickets for the concert are now on
sale at the Stanford bookstore and at
Crandall's in Palo Alto. The advance
sale by members of the Glee Club in
dicates that this year's campus con
cert will have a record attendance.
And a record attendance means that
the student body will have at last
recognized the merit of the Glee Club,
as that merit has been recognized off
the campus.
