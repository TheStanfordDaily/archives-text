# BRONCS REVERSE DOPE. BEAT CARD BALL TEAM, 3-2
## Randazzo Breaks Up Diamond Clash by Home Run in Seventh Inning 
### 
Stanford visited Santa Clara yester
day with the idea of tramping on the
Missionites, but a home run by Ran
dazzo, Saint centerfielder, in the sev
enth, wrecked the hopes of the Cards
and gave the Catholics the game, 3-2.
Teague took up the hurling burden
for the varsity at the start and looked
good until the third, when three suc
cessive hits by the Santa Clarans sent
him to the showers.
Solomon relieved Teague and al
lowed only one hit during the rest of
the afternoon but that one hit gave the
Saints the one big run needed to win.
Randazzo Gets Homer
The score was tied in the seventh
when Randazzo came up.to the plate.
Just like the famous Casey. But Ran
dazzo failed to duplicate Casey's feat.
Instead, he slammed out a lpng hit to
left center that just ruined the after
noon for the Cards. While the Stan
ford outfielders were galloping after
thp ball, Randazzo sauntered across
the plate with the winning tally.
The varsity seems to be in a hit
ting slump, having lost the last three
starts mainly because of a failure to
connect solidly with the ball. Cudde
bac-k was the only {Stanford hitter in
yesterday's game to get a real swing
at the ball. He lined one out for a.
double that scored Roberts. Five other
hits were turned in by his teammates |
but they failed to come at a time when j
hits meant damage.
However, now that the tliree-in-a-|
row jinx has been satisfied, things j
look bright for a win over the Olym
pic Club in Saturday's game.
According to Coach Harry Wolters,
Ernie Nevers may be given the job of
pitching to the Olympians. Nevers has |
been working under Wolter's eye since;
the end of the basketball season and
seems to have plenty of stuff on the
ball.
