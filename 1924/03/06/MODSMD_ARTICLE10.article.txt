# FINAL HOOP GAME FOR WOMEN FRIDAY
## 
### 
Freshmen and sophomore women's
basketball squads are slated for the
final struggle of the season tomorrow
at 4:10 on Roble Field.
The teams are of equal standing,
each having won and lost a game.
Both squads are fast, but play a dif
ferent style of game. They are evenly
matched, with good work of the fresh
man guards offset by the accurate
shooting of the sophomores. Charlotte
Lovekin captains the freshmen and
Lois Wilbur the sophomores.
According to schedule, the freshmen
and senior second teams will also
meet. Shirley Wood is the captain of
the 1927 team and Isabelle Muzzey of
the 1924 squad.
Loraine Cleaveland, women's yell
leader, urges that every woman in the
University who is free at the time
make it a point to be on the athletic
field. This-is the last game and spe
cial awards are to be made.
