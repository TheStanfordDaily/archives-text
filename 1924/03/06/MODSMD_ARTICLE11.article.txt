# TERMITE STUDY IMPORTANT
## Economists Watching Professor Heath's Work in Hope of Saving Millions 
### 
i As a result of an extensive study of i
I the life history and structure of the
I California termite, being conducted i
by Processor Harold Heath of the
; Stanford Zoology department, it may
be possible to exterminate that insect
and thus save millions of dollars in
property each year.
Although Professor Heath's object
in studying the termite is not an eco
nomic one, he is being in
; his work by different people not only
in the United States, but in Africa,
South America, and at different places
in the tropics where it is hoped that
some method may be discovered to
! successfully combat this pest.
I "The California termite," Professor j
Heath said, "is just a primitive type
of the larger species found in Africa
and South America, but it is believed
I that their life history is about the J
..
same.
Describes Termite
In describing the termite Heath ;
j said, "It resembles the ant somewhat |
in appearance, and many people mis- ,
j take the two insects. The termite is :

| divided into castes and has a division
of work very much similar to the dif
j ferent species of ants. The reproduc
tive type has wings. The king and
queen termite, as they are called, will
fly away to some suitable spot and
start a new colony. It was estimated
that a certain African type lays an
average of 80,000 eggs a day. This re
productive rate has never been
; equalled by any other organism."
Dr. Heath stated that the termite
destroys timber and property each
year worth between 40 and 50 millions
of dollars. It attacks books, wood,
paper, or leather, and has been known
to dig holes through cement sidewalks.
I In the main, however, its chief food
consists of wood.
Professor Heath has been making
' intensive studies of the termite for
: the last two years and expects to have
j the major part of his work finished in
! a few months. He will not be able to
! write a paper on the subject for an
; other year, however, as he intends to
, conduct some breeding experiments
j at Pacific Grove this summer.
