# UPPER CLASSES FAVORED 10 WIN MEET SATURDAY
## Seniors Have Advantage of Ten Points Because of Marathon Victroy 
### 
Two upperclass teams will fight it
out Saturday for first honors in the
annual interclass track and field meet
which will be held at 1:30 in the
stadium.
Odds point to a 1924 victory as the
seniors already have ten points to
their credit for winning the Irish
Marathon. The juniors have a formida
ble aggregation and will run the sen
iors a close second.
The sophomores are not sure of a
single first place, while the freshman
strength is unknown. The babes are
expected to garner more seconds and
thirds than the 192G team, and accord
ingly should place third in the meet.
Fast Times Expected
The stadium track is expected to
favor record times. Both the 440-yard
dash and the 880-yard run will start
on the straight-of-way, which will
make each race a turn less than in
former years when they started in the
middle of the track.
The events Saturday are being held
in the stadium to test the new track.
After this meet the new oval will not
be used again until the Big Meet.
