# UPPER CLASSES FAVORED 10 WIN MEET SATURDAY
## Seniors Have Advantage of Ten Points Because of Marathon Victroy 
### 
Two upperclass teams will fight it
out Saturday for first honors in the
annual interclass track and field meet
which will be held at 1:30 in the
stadium.
Odds point to a 1924 victory as the
seniors already have ten points to
their credit for winning the Irish
Marathon. The juniors have a formida
ble aggregation and will run the sen
iors a close second.
The sophomores are not sure of a
single first place, while the freshman
strength is unknown. The babes are
expected to garner more seconds and
thirds than the 192G team, and accord
ingly should place third in the meet.
Fast Times Expected
The stadium track is expected to
favor record times. Both the 440-yard
dash and the 880-yard run will start
on the straight-of-way, which will
make each race a turn less than in
former years when they started in the
middle of the track.
The events Saturday are being held
in the stadium to test the new track.
After this meet the new oval will not
be used again until the Big Meet.
"Tiny" Hartranft has been taking it
easy this week in an effort to get his
arm in shape. He will enter the discus
throw but it is doubtful if he will
compete in the shot put in the inter
class contests.
Storie in 220
Bill Storie will perform in the 220
instead of the quarter, if Coach "Dink"
Templeton carries o;it his present
plans. This change is being made to
give Storie a little rest, as he has been
overworking of late.
For the same reason, Al Smith, star
miler, will run the half mile instead
of his usual event. With Smith in the
half mile, Bill Richardson will
have to step to cross the tape first.
Besides Smith and Richardson. Dole,
Daley, Swayne, Mcintosh, and Pas
torius will compete in the two-lap
event. All of these men are capable
of less than 0:50 flat, and so a close
finish is assured.
Ted Miller, star 1926 220 man, will
be used in the quarter mile. "Dink"
will probably use Miller regularly in
the quarter this year, as he has shown
considerable ability in this distance.
Nelson Van Judah, track captain, will
not compete Saturday. With Storie
and Van Judah out, Miller should cop
first in this event. Coverley and Mixon
are also strong contenders in the
quarter.
With the exception of Storie, Smith,
and Miller, the other tracksters will
compete in their usual events.
Seniors Have Sprinters
The seniors' greatest strength is in
the track events. Lan Campbell and
Marshall Hale are almost certain of
places in both sprints; Leistner should
win both hurdle events; and places
should go to the fourth year men in
the distance races.
Hartranft will add to the senior to
tal in both the discus and shot, if he
should compete in both. Bill Wright,
also a senior, is the first choice to
win the broad jump. The other field
events will go to the juniors and fresh
men.
Dennis should win the pole vault
and Harlow the javelin throw for the
juniors. The freshmen should take
most of the points in the high jump
with West and Richman.

Besides Smith and Richardson. Dole,
Daley, Swayne, Mcintosh, and Pas
torius will compete in the two-lap
event. All of these men are capable
of less than 0:50 flat, and so a close
finish is assured.
Ted Miller, star 1926 220 man, will
be used in the quarter mile. "Dink"
will probably use Miller regularly in
the quarter this year, as he has shown
considerable ability in this distance.
Nelson Van Judah, track captain, will
not compete Saturday. With Storie
and Van Judah out, Miller should cop
first in this event. Coverley and Mixon
are also strong contenders in the
quarter.
With the exception of Storie, Smith,
and Miller, the other tracksters will
compete in their usual events.
Seniors Have Sprinters
The seniors' greatest strength is in
the track events. Lan Campbell and
Marshall Hale are almost certain of
places in both sprints; Leistner should
win both hurdle events; and places
should go to the fourth year men in
the distance races.
Hartranft will add to the senior to
tal in both the discus and shot, if he
should compete in both. Bill Wright,
also a senior, is the first choice to
win the broad jump. The other field
events will go to the juniors and fresh
men.
Dennis should win the pole vault
and Harlow the javelin throw for the
juniors. The freshmen should take
most of the points in the high jump
with West and Richman.
Two upperclass teams will fight it
out Saturday for first honors in the
annual interclass track and field meet
which will be held at 1:30 in the
stadium.
Odds point to a 1924 victory as the
seniors already have ten points to
their credit for winning the Irish
Marathon. The juniors have a formida
ble aggregation and will run the sen
iors a close second.
The sophomores are not sure of a
single first place, while the freshman
strength is unknown. The babes are
expected to garner more seconds and
thirds than the 192G team, and accord
ingly should place third in the meet.
Fast Times Expected
The stadium track is expected to
favor record times. Both the 440-yard
dash and the 880-yard run will start
on the straight-of-way, which will
make each race a turn less than in
former years when they started in the
middle of the track.
The events Saturday are being held
in the stadium to test the new track.
After this meet the new oval will not
be used again until the Big Meet.
"Tiny" Hartranft has been taking it
easy this week in an effort to get his
arm in shape. He will enter the discus
throw but it is doubtful if he will
compete in the shot put in the inter
class contests.
Storie in 220
Bill Storie will perform in the 220
instead of the quarter, if Coach "Dink"
Templeton carries o;it his present
plans. This change is being made to
give Storie a little rest, as he has been
overworking of late.
For the same reason, Al Smith, star
miler, will run the half mile instead
of his usual event. With Smith in the
half mile, Bill Richardson will
have to step to cross the tape first.
