# Glee Club

### 
The Stanford student body will have a chance to show whether it ap
proves or disapproves one of its most creditable activities when the Glee
Club presents its first campus concert of the year, Friday night.
The Glee Club has changed its type of program so that it can now ap
pear with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and the Los Angeles
Philharmonic Orchestra. The new program should have something of in
terest for everyone who enjoys music.
Off-campus, the Stanford Glee Club is held in very high esteem, as is
evidenced by the fact that it is to appear at the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles six days during the Spring vacation.
ihe Glee Club is one of the few activities which has not received the
support it merits in the past. For Friday night's concert, the admission
price has been reduced to fifty and seventy-five cents. These prices have
been made to fit almost any pocketbook and the club deserves to perform
before a packed house.
