# SENIORS WIN FROM JUNIOR ELEVEN 2-1 IN SOCCER CONTEST
## 
### 
Senior soccer players defeated an
overconfident junior team this after
noon by a 2-1 score in the second
game of the interclass series.
The juniors, having a preponderance
of varsity men, allowed the seniors,
who diil not have a full team, to play
several sophomores. The underclass
men played unexpectedly well and
won the day for 1924.
Within the first six minutes of play,
Dwight shot the first goal for the
seniors, and was quickly followed with
another one by Franklin. Both teams
then tightened down to business and
the score was unchanged until the last
ten minutes of the game when Quigley
shot the only tally for the juniors.-
Neither team played conspicuously
fine soccer and individual playing was
more noticeable than efficient team
work. Dwight, ranklin, and Crondonna
were the oustanding men for the win
ners. while Off and Quigley distin
guished themselves in vain for the
losers.
The line-up was as follows:
Seniors — Juniors—
