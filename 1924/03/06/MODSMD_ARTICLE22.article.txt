This afternoon, in the Union court, the Stanford Band gave its only
concert of the quarter.
Stanford has every reason to be proud of her band and students greatly
enjoy the concerts which have been too few and far between lately. It
seems that it should be possible for the band to appear once a week or at
least every two weeks.
It is to be hoped that the musicians see fit to give concerts more fre
quently next quarter. There is no reason why the band could not prepare
a special program once a quarter and give an indoor performance. This
would be a legitimate and agreeable way to raise funds and would give
those who like music some good entertainment.
