# Water Color Paintings of Wild Flowers on Exhibit
## 
### 
One hundred and twenty-seven
wuter color paintings by Ethel Wickes
are now on exhibition at the Art Gal
lery. "These pictures are the most per
fectly painted collection of the Btate's
flowers ever produced," says John D.
Lemos, of the gallery. "They are artis
tic in themselves and botanically
true."
Miss Wickes spent many years in
collecting the subjects and had some
difficulty in finding specimens for her
work. Many of the pictures show the
type of landscape where the flowers
generally grow and so adds a new
note to the usual flower exhibition.
The collection is found to be of spe
cial interest in the spring, and chil
dren are more numerous in the num
ber of visitors.
