# MODERN SYSTEM OF TELEPHONES IS NOW BEING PUT IN ENCINA
## 
### 
An automatic, room-to-room tele
phone system is now being installed in
Encina hall, which is practically the
same system that has been put in at
both Toyon and Branner halls.
All three halls will be controlled by
a single switchboard located in Toyon
hall. When the installation has been
completed, almost 1000 men will be
handled through this central ex
change.
Buzzers are to be placed in all the
rooms. When a man receives a call his
room is buzzed, and he answers by
pressing a button which notifies the
operator whether or not he is in his
room. Phones will be placed on each
floor, where the student will answer
his call.
The whole system is one of the most
modern to be obtained. It is estimated
that in a very short time it will pay
for itself through savings in cost of

operation. Under the present system
of calling out through the windows,
over $100 a month are paid out in
salaries to students doing that work.
The installation of the system in
Encina alone will cost approximately
$8,000.
