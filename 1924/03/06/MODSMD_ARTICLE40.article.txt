# Law and Business Closely Related, States Shepherd

### 
"Law and business are closely inter-;
related. It is through business that
laws are made. Legal training teaches
a business man when to get a lawyer's
aid. Much money is lost by not know- j
ing when to employ an attorney."
This was the assertion of Professor
Harold Shepherd of the Law School
at a Nestoria meeting in Room 12 of
the Law building last night.
Russell Walter defeated Philip der- i
ger in an informal debate immediately
following Professor Shepherd's talk, i
"Resolved, that all students who in-'
tend to go into business should be
compelled to take a three-year law
course" was the subject. Walter de
fended the negative.
