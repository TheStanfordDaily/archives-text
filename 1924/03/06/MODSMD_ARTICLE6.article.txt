# LIFE EXPERIENCES ARE RECOUNTED BY N. C. HANKS IN TALK
## 
### 
A tale of mishap in which only a
strong determination could have sur
vived, was what the audience heard
yesterday afternoon in the Little Thea
tre when N. C. Hanks of Sunshine
Heights, Burley, Idaho, recounted his
experiences.
Hanks said of his early life, "I was
one of the fortunate lads in the family,
for T worked my way through school."
The accident which robbed him of
hands and of eyesight occurred when
Hanks was working in a silver and
lead with some other men, in
order that he might finish his educa
tion, which had proceeded as far as
the first two years in a commercial
school.
Hanks described the joy and beauty
of the last morning he was able to
see, with such vividness and pathetic
pleasure that one who hears him is
willing to be content with his lot, and
to enjoy the simple pleasures of exist
ence which are so often taken for
granted.
A picture of agony and suffering is
the one recounted by Hanks when he
told of the first few years which fol
lowed his accident. But after he had
heard several people say that it was
a shame he had not died, he said, "My
Yankee blood began to boil, and I
made up my mind to live. However,
there is a difference between deter
mining to do something, and really
doing it."
"The great, pile of preparation for
anything I would do was before me
wherever I turned," said Hanks. "How
to get along without hands or eyes
was my great problem."
At a lecture, he met the man who
finally became his instructor for seven
years, and helped Hanks to become a
lecturer, and to memorize readings.
"It took me five weeks to learn to
dress myself," said Hanks. "The sec
ond step was learning how to eat
alone."
