# DEBATERS OPPOSE OREGON TONIGHT
## Team Victorious Over Tech Will Uphold Tribunal In Little Theatre 
### 
Fresh from a victory on the same
question over the California Institute
of Technology, Stanford devaters op
pose Oregon tonight in the annual Tri-
State forensic duel.
The debate will start at 8:30 in the
Little Theatre, immediately following
the lecture in the Assembly hall.
"Resolved, that the United States

subject.
Fortified by upholding what is ad
mittedly the better side of the ques

speakers have a good chance to repeat
their Tech victory.
Stanford will be represented by
George Crocker and Percival Spencer.
The Tech debate was the first varsity
appearance for both men. Crocker em
ploys an eloquent, polished style of
delivery, while Spencer counts on
keen, analytical argument to carry
him through.
Oregon is sending down her two
best speakers, Harold C. Sox and
Herschel J. Brown, to defend the nega
tive. Their greater experience may
prove the deciding factor in winning
the debate for them.
Three Men to Judge
Owing to an agreement between the
three universities entered in the Tri-
State contest, three men rather than
the audience as a whole will render
the decision.
Dwight E. Watkins, head of the Pub

Daniel C. Imborden, manager of the
Three-Cities chamber of commerce of
San Mateo; and Grant R. Bennett, San
Jose attorney and former Princeton
debater and football star, are the
judges.
