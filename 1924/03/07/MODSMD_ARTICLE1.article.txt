# WINGED "O" MEETS CARD WATER POLO TEAM AT SUTRD
## Winner Represents West at National Championship Meet at Chicago 
### John Kenney 
Tomorrow at 2:15 the Card water
poloists meet the Olympic Club at
Sutro Baths to decide which team
shall represent the Pacific coast at
the National Championships in Chi
cago.
Two months ago when Charlie
t'ered $2,000 for the best water polo
team from the local association to
compete at Chicago, the first of April,
it was taken for granted that the
Olympic Club would be awarded the
$2,000 without a struggle. Coach Ernst
Brandsten of Stanford had other
thoughts and he challenged the Club
men to play for the right and honor to
represent the West.
The challenge was accepted and for
the past two months both teams have
been practicing with a persistency
that showed that they meant business.
The contest will be a battle from start
to finish.
Veterans on Club Team
The Club has a veteran aggregation
which has been playing together for a
number of years. Stieger, the goal
keeper. and Gardner, the captain, ware
on the 1920 championship team. Car
son, the center forward, was the
sprint man on the team which wont
to the last Olympic games and not
once in Europe was he out-rushed.
Wally O'Connor, the Card center for
ward, uncovered the spot at every
start against California. It will be an
interesting battle between these two
center forwards to see which uncovers
the greatest number of times. If O'Con
nor can out-rush Carson it will give
the Cards quite an edge.
"Ginny" Austin Will Play
"Fish" Herrington, of this year's
Bear seven, and "Ginny" Austin, the
star of the 1923 Card team, will be
seen on the Card line-up. Mitchell, the
California captain, who kept O'Connor
from scoring and who handled the
ball so speedily and accurately in the
California game, will be one of the
backs who will endeavor to break up
the Card offense. Working with him
in the backfield will be Schroth, the
Club's 230-pound guard.
The Stanford line-up will be the
same one that so decisively trounced
the Blue and Gold last Friday. They
only played straight water polo then,
but Olympic Club players, who wit
nessed the game, sat up and took
fiotice. Their teamwork and precision
in passing does not speak well for.
Olympic Club chances.
Tickets on Sale
Tickets for the game are on sale at
the Administration building and at
Encina Pool. The price of admission is
fifty cents and the proceeds are to go
to the Olympic Game fund.

The Women's Christian Temperance
Union has a national membership "of
500,000.
Tomorrow at 2:15 the Card water
poloists meet the Olympic Club at
Sutro Baths to decide which team
shall represent the Pacific coast at
the National Championships in Chi
cago.
Two months ago when Charlie
t'ered $2,000 for the best water polo
team from the local association to
compete at Chicago, the first of April,
it was taken for granted that the
Olympic Club would be awarded the
$2,000 without a struggle. Coach Ernst
Brandsten of Stanford had other
thoughts and he challenged the Club
men to play for the right and honor to
represent the West.
The challenge was accepted and for
the past two months both teams have
been practicing with a persistency
that showed that they meant business.
The contest will be a battle from start
to finish.
Veterans on Club Team
The Club has a veteran aggregation
which has been playing together for a
number of years. Stieger, the goal
keeper. and Gardner, the captain, ware
on the 1920 championship team. Car
son, the center forward, was the
sprint man on the team which wont
to the last Olympic games and not
once in Europe was he out-rushed.
Wally O'Connor, the Card center for
ward, uncovered the spot at every
start against California. It will be an
interesting battle between these two
center forwards to see which uncovers
the greatest number of times. If O'Con
nor can out-rush Carson it will give
the Cards quite an edge.
"Ginny" Austin Will Play
"Fish" Herrington, of this year's
Bear seven, and "Ginny" Austin, the
star of the 1923 Card team, will be
seen on the Card line-up. Mitchell, the
California captain, who kept O'Connor
from scoring and who handled the
ball so speedily and accurately in the
California game, will be one of the
backs who will endeavor to break up
the Card offense. Working with him
in the backfield will be Schroth, the
Club's 230-pound guard.
The Stanford line-up will be the
same one that so decisively trounced
the Blue and Gold last Friday. They
only played straight water polo then,
but Olympic Club players, who wit
nessed the game, sat up and took
fiotice. Their teamwork and precision
in passing does not speak well for.
Olympic Club chances.
Tickets on Sale
Tickets for the game are on sale at
the Administration building and at
Encina Pool. The price of admission is
fifty cents and the proceeds are to go
to the Olympic Game fund.
