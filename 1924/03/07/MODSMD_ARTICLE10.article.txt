# Yearling Ballplayers Prepare for Contest With Lick-Wilmer ding
## 
### 
In preparation for the invasion of
Lick Wilmerding high school tomor
row morning at 10 o'clock, the frosh
diamond crew will go through a light
workout today. Coach Hunt is expect
ing a hard tussle with this school
which distinguished itself in football
this year.
Hunt will start either Osthaus or
Collins in the box but he expects to
use at least two pitchers in the re
maining practice games so as not to
overwork any one man. It is possible
that Linquist or Iliese may get on the
mound as both of them showed up
well against Palo Alto last Wednes
day.
Stewart or Scherer will be on the
receiving end of the battery as Bail
ard's injured hand will keep him out
of the game.
