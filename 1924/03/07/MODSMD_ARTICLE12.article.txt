# ODDS FAVOR SENIORS TO WIN INIERCLASS MEET TOMORROW
## Juniors Have Many Point Getters, But Victory in Marathon Gives Sponsor Team Advantage 
### Wallace Knox 
Senior tracksters will enter the interclass track and field meet at 1:30
tomorrow afternoon slightly the favorites.
The juniors have a strong team and will be right on the heels of the seniors
in the scoring. However, the seniors have a ten-point lead already because
of their victory in the Irish Marathon, and this lead will be enough to win,
even if the juniors should outscore them in the meet tomorrow.
Third place will be contested for by the sophomores and freshmen. Kerr,
Richardson, Boles, Miller, Caspar, and Clifford will be the chief sophomore
point-getters. The babe runners have shown little ability as yet, but it is
possible that Hoffman, Macabee, Richmann, West, Meeks, Shipkey, Anderson,

''Spencer, and Templeton will be able
to nose out the second-year team by
placing in the hurdles and field events.
Seniors Strong in Sprints
The seniors are strongest in the
sprints. Lan Campbell, winner of the
220 and second in the 100 in the Big
Meet, and Marshall Hale should place
first and second in both the century
and furlong. Storie, a junior in the
220, and Gaspar, a sophomore in the
hundred, will probably 'g>ot the third
places. Adams, Babcock, and McDou
gall, the freshman sprinters, may
break into the point column.
Storie will not run in the quarter,
according to the present plans of
Coach "Dink" Templeton. Miller,
sophomore, and Coverly and Mixon,
seniors, will probably be the three men
to place.
The half mile should be the closest
and fastest race of the day. Al Smith
will run against Bill Richardson, and,
with tl'ese speed demonds tangling, a
record time may result, and Daly will
also be in this race, but none of them
are considered to have a chance to
win.
Kerr to Run Mile
Bill Kerr, sophomore, will probably
run in the mile, instead of the two
mile. He should get a first, although
Murphy and Thayer are strong con
tenders. In the two-mile, Al Charles,
junior, is the fastest runner. He should
be good for a first, with Hayes, senior,
second, and Clifford, sophomore, third.
"Swede" Leistner is a cinch to take
both hurdle events for the juniors.
Boles, sophomore, Spencer and West,
freshmen, and Wells, junior, are the
other outstanding entrants.
The seniors have the best chance in
the broad jump with Bill Wright, Dick
Macllae", and Art Bragg. Meeks, a
freshman, is expected to place also.
The freshmen, with Richmann and
West, should get first and second in
the high jump, with Anderson or Kem
nitzer taking the other point for the
seniors.
Dennis to Vault
Guy Dennis, a junior, is the first
choice in the pole vault. Scofleld, sen
ior; Tompleton and Williams, fresh
men; and Whistler, junior, are some
of the other pole vaulters who will
fight for honors.
In the weights, "Tiny" Hartranft
will take both firsts for the seniors if
he is able to compete. His arm has
been troubling him and it is not cer
tain whether he will be able to par
ticipate. Other good men are Hoff
mann and Macabee for the babes,
Campbell and Ludeke for the seniors,
and Richartfs for the juniors.
Harlow, junior, has the best chance
in the javelin throw. Shipkey and An
derson showed up well in the fresh
man meet and will give the junior
heaver some competition. Jim Kelly,
senior, is another entrant in this event.

ior; Tompleton and Williams, fresh
men; and Whistler, junior, are some
of the other pole vaulters who will
fight for honors.
In the weights, "Tiny" Hartranft
will take both firsts for the seniors if
he is able to compete. His arm has
been troubling him and it is not cer
tain whether he will be able to par
ticipate. Other good men are Hoff
mann and Macabee for the babes,
Campbell and Ludeke for the seniors,
and Richartfs for the juniors.
Harlow, junior, has the best chance
in the javelin throw. Shipkey and An
derson showed up well in the fresh
man meet and will give the junior
heaver some competition. Jim Kelly,
senior, is another entrant in this event.
Senior tracksters will enter the interclass track and field meet at 1:30
tomorrow afternoon slightly the favorites.
The juniors have a strong team and will be right on the heels of the seniors
in the scoring. However, the seniors have a ten-point lead already because
of their victory in the Irish Marathon, and this lead will be enough to win,
even if the juniors should outscore them in the meet tomorrow.
Third place will be contested for by the sophomores and freshmen. Kerr,
Richardson, Boles, Miller, Caspar, and Clifford will be the chief sophomore
point-getters. The babe runners have shown little ability as yet, but it is
possible that Hoffman, Macabee, Richmann, West, Meeks, Shipkey, Anderson,

''Spencer, and Templeton will be able
to nose out the second-year team by
placing in the hurdles and field events.
Seniors Strong in Sprints
The seniors are strongest in the
sprints. Lan Campbell, winner of the
220 and second in the 100 in the Big
Meet, and Marshall Hale should place
first and second in both the century
and furlong. Storie, a junior in the
220, and Gaspar, a sophomore in the
hundred, will probably 'g>ot the third
places. Adams, Babcock, and McDou
gall, the freshman sprinters, may
break into the point column.
Storie will not run in the quarter,
according to the present plans of
Coach "Dink" Templeton. Miller,
sophomore, and Coverly and Mixon,
seniors, will probably be the three men
to place.
The half mile should be the closest
and fastest race of the day. Al Smith
will run against Bill Richardson, and,
with tl'ese speed demonds tangling, a
record time may result, and Daly will
also be in this race, but none of them
are considered to have a chance to
win.
Kerr to Run Mile
Bill Kerr, sophomore, will probably
run in the mile, instead of the two
mile. He should get a first, although
Murphy and Thayer are strong con
tenders. In the two-mile, Al Charles,
junior, is the fastest runner. He should
be good for a first, with Hayes, senior,
second, and Clifford, sophomore, third.
"Swede" Leistner is a cinch to take
both hurdle events for the juniors.
Boles, sophomore, Spencer and West,
freshmen, and Wells, junior, are the
other outstanding entrants.
The seniors have the best chance in
the broad jump with Bill Wright, Dick
Macllae", and Art Bragg. Meeks, a
freshman, is expected to place also.
The freshmen, with Richmann and
West, should get first and second in
the high jump, with Anderson or Kem
nitzer taking the other point for the
seniors.
Dennis to Vault
Guy Dennis, a junior, is the first
choice in the pole vault. Scofleld, sen
ior; Tompleton and Williams, fresh
