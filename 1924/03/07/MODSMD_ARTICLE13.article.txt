# CLUB NINE HOPES TO STAGE COMEBACK AGAINST STANFORD
## 
### 
Having lost its two previous starts
against Harry Wolters' ballplayers,
the Olympic Club team will take the
field tomorrow afternoon in an effort
to wipe out the memory of those af
fairs.
Three pitchers will arrive with the
visitors, including Clarke, who turned
the Cards back easily for five innings
in the last encounter, only to blow up
and lose the battle in the sixth. Gene
Camozzi and Bill O'Toole are the other
two hurlers who may be called upon
to face Stanford.
Powell, the hard-looking catcher
who entertained the bleachers with
his tough line of chatter, will be seen
in Saturday's game.
The varsity sluggers are about due
to break loose from the hitting slump
that has cost them the last three con
tests, and if they do —look out Olym

Ernie Nevers has moved his big
form from the court to the diamond
and is Wolters' most likely choice for
the pitching job. Nevers' arm has
loosened up nicely and he looks like
a sure bet to win if the varsity gets a
few runs for him.
Johnston, who was out of the Santa
Clara game, will be back in left field.
The game will be called at 2:30" on
the varsity diamond.
