Sunday is Founders' Day. The event this year commemorates the
one hundredth birthday of Senator Stanford, who was born in New
York March 9, 1824.
Senator Stanford founded our University in memory of his son, who
died at an early age. He was a man who had a vision of a great
university nestling in the foothills on his great estate.
Once he conceived the idea, nothing could turn him from it. He
devoted most of the remainder of his life and his entire fortune to
carrying out his plans.
Senator Stanford was one of the most influential men in the early
history of the state of California. He was public-spirited, generous, and
far-seeing. Above all, he was a good citizen and a man.
Stanford students seldom stop to think of just what this University
represents. Few know of the critical period Stanford passed through in
her early history. Investments failed to live up to expectations, and
funds "Were exceedingly low. Professors worked and slaved to educate
the young people of California and for a long period of time, some of
them received no remuneration.
The entire student body should join. Sunday, in paying homage to
the memory of the man who founded Stanford, where "the winds of
freedom blow."
