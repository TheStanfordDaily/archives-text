It is hard for Californians to realize that, while the Stanford student
body is charging around in light clothing and dropping in on a January
baseball game, eastern universities are fighting their way through snow
and slush and holding rallies in steam-heated halls in support of -the
hockey team. The matter of climate puts California universities in a
class by themselves, and leaves the way clear for them to further develop
an individuality in any way they see fit. Stanford in particular, with
the largest university campus in the world, has every opportunity to
enfold herself with a personality—an atmosphere—such as Oxford's.
Everything on the practical side favors this. The campus is far enough
from a city to be free from any metropolitan influence, and the archi
tectural style as inaugurated by a far-sighted founder and enlarged upon
by wise successors, is absolutely individual. The University is young
enough to be unhampered by the worn-out and senseless tradition so
characteristic of more narrow institutions. Stanford has an excellent
opportunity to select or adopt a line of development that will make her
absolutely unique in every respect.
As represented by the motto, Stanford already casts a ballot in favor
of individual freedom. Further expansion of this policy, together with
a continuance of the reputation for consistent success in later life, would
bring Stanford well near the level of her present possibilities.
