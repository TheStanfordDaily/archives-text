# LOW DIVING TITLE WON BY DAVE FALL
## 
### 
Dave Fall of Stanford won the na
tional junior A. A. U. low board cham
pionship in a meet held at the Holly
wood Athletic Club last night. Cleve
Morrison of the Hollywood Athletic
Club placed second, and Biddle Dorcy,
Card freshman diver, third.
The winning of this meet adds an
other to the already long list of cham
pions that Coach "Ernie" Brandsten
has developed. Taking first and third
place will boost the national A. A. U.
rating of Stanford because the points
that these divers made all go towards
the making of that rating.
Six Card divers made the trip. The
men who competed besides Fall and
Dorcy were Gibbons, King, Kenney,
and Brown. A1 White went along in
the capacity of coach.
