By defeating the University of Washington quintet last night, the
University of California basketball team won the Pacific Coast Champion
ship.
Stanford supporters had their eyes on that banner before the Card-
Bruin series. The Stanford quintet played good basketball against
California, but did not have sufficient reserve strength to come out on top.
California proved herself the best team in the southern division of
the conference at that time, and last night she proved herself the best
team on the coast.
Cardinal rooters are glad to see the Golden Bear turn back the north
ern invader. While the two leading universities in the state, Stanford
and California, are, have been, and always will be, natural rivals, a
friendly feeling exists between them.
Friendly rivalry is the only kind that has any place in the lives of
American universities. It would be a fine thing if all the institutions that
Cardinals and meet on athletic fields could merit sharing such a
feeling.
