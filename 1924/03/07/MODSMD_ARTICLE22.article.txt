### 
"A Visit With Barrie and His Dream
Children" will be the subject of the
readings which Katherine Oliver Mc-
Coy will give in the Assembly hall at
7:30 Tuesday evening.
Mrs. McCoy has an international
reputation for her interpretation of
Scottish literature, and especially of
Barrie's works.
She has given readings at the White
House in Washington, D. C., and at the
Government House in Canada, besides
in lecture hall√ü on this continent and
Europe.
Early in her career, Mrs. McCoy
even performed before Barrie himself,
to whom she gave her interpretation
of his "Little Minister." She received
from Barrie the only testimonial he
ever gave anyone.
