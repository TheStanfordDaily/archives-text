# Freshmen Net Men Meet Lowell High Tomorrow
## 
### 
Freshman tennis players will have
a chance to show their mettle against
Lowell High School tomorrow after
noon on the varsity courts.
The team will be picked from the
six highest men in the latest weekly
ranking, Holman, Gardner, Kurihara,
Menzies, Baer, and Anawalt.
So far Cranston Holman has been
the outstanding star of the class and
is practically certain to win his match
in the California meet. He is one of
the best court players that have en
tered Stanford for some time, having
already been mentioned as a prospect
for the Olympic Games. '
