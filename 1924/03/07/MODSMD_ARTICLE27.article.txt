### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
T stands for tennis, temperament, and Tilden, all of which are more or less
synonymous. "Big Bill" was runner-up in 1918 to my brother, Lindley
Murray, and second to Billy Johnston the next year, but since then has
reigned supreme as national champion.
T also stands for track and Thomson. Earl Thomson of Canada, Long
Beach, California, and Dartmouth was one of the greatest of all track athletes.
Any drawings I make of Earl should really show a rear view, for that is the
one I had of the world's and Olympic hurdle champion in numerous races.
Tunney is another T who holds a title —Gene is the American light heavy
weight champ, and if McTigue ever condescends to fight him he will un
doubtedly hold the world's title, too. Gene is the only one of the A. E. F.
champs to make good, and is one of the few men who hare lost a title and
then rewon it.
