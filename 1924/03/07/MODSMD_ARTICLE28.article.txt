# Pergola Is Being Built In Front of Pavilion
## 
### 
A pergola is being built above the
entrance to the pavilion.
This addition is a part of the origi-j
nal plans for the basketball court, and
is similar in design to the pergola over
the front of Encina.
The pergola will be completed in
time for the University Day dinner on
April 26.
