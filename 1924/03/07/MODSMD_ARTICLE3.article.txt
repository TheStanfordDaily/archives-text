# Debaters Earn Even Break In Tri-State Duel
## 
### 
Stanford's affirmative team defeat
ed the Oregon arguers by a two to one
decision in the Tri-State Debate held
in the Little Theatre last night. At the
same time the negative team lost a
two to one decision to Washington at
Seattle.
'George Crocker and Percival Spen
cer upheld the affirmative of the ques
tion, "Resolved, that the United
States should enter the World Court,"
against Glenwood Archer and Herschel
Brown of Oregon. In the north, Robert
Lewis and Ronald Button were unable
to convince the judges of the opposite
side of this question.
The affirmative urged American en
trance to the tribunal for two main
reasons â€”first, because such a step
would be a natural outgrowth of our
past international policy, and second,
because it is absolutely necessary for
the realization of American aims in
international affairs.
Negative speakers contended against
United States participation on the
grounds that the court possesses in
herent weaknesses, and that entrance
would involve America in a direct re
lationship with the League of Nations.
