# FAVORITE PAINTINGS OF FORMER EXHIBITS NOW AT ART GALLERY
## 
### 
Favorite paintings from former ex
hibitions have been grouped together
in the Stanford Art Gallery. Many of
the pictures are part of the main col
lection of works made by Thomas Wel
ton Stanford for his private collection
in Australia.
"The majority of the paintings are
those that have been asked for by
visitors," according to John Lemos, of
the art gallery, "and they have always
proved popular in previous exhibi
tions." Â«
One such picture is "The Siege of
Paris," which hung in the front gal
lery for several years, and has since
been the object of many inquiries.
Five or six of the collection shown
are the so-called "story pictures," a
type popular in the past days of oil
painting. A marked preference for this
style has been shown in the number
of requests for "To Late" by Gordon
Coutes. This picture, because of its
human interest element, made such
an impression that it was engraved,
and colored prints of it were sold in
many localities. "The Letter," by H.
Bethke, is also popular.
"Two desert scenes are shown, paint
ed by different artists. The opinions of
the amateur art critics who visit the
collection seem divided as to which is
the best representation," says Mr.
Lemos.
The exhibition will remain in the
gallery for several weeks.
