# MALONEY'S BOXERS MIX WITH FARMERS TONIGHT AT DAVIS
## 
### 
Harry Maloney's squad of leather
pushers are carded to meet Davis
Farm tonight at Davis in a return meet
between the two teams.
The Card boxers won the first tour
ney, easily garnering a 5 to 1 victory
with three knockouts to their credit.
The Aggies, however, are thought to
have improved. If their trimming of
California last Friday may be taken
as an indication, they may give the
Stanford fighters more opposition than
before.
Seven men left this morning as
members of the team. They were:
Armbruster, Harward, Martin, Adams,
Shaw, Steele, and Robinson.
Shaw, a middleweight, and one of
the cleverest fighters of his class ever
seen at Stanford, will box an exhibi
tion bout with some Davis Farm en
trant. He is ineligible for varsity com
petition.
Armbruster, Pacific Coast feather
weight champion, hopes to avenge the
draw with Bernshouse (D. F.) that he
was given in the last meet. The Card
featherweight is undoubtedly in bet
ter condition and may come through
with the decision.
"Jake" Irwin, one of the Stanford
mainstays and an undefeated middle
weight, is afflicted with poison-oak
and could not make the trip. Adams
will substitute.
Steele will make his first bid for
honors tonight after a season on the
basketball floor. He is substituting for
Van Hook who scored a win over his
opponent in the last meet.
