# WORLD ECONOMY TO PREVENT WARS IN FUTURE-GAEVERNITZ
## 
### 
With present economic tendencies
leading to interdependence, world
economy, and peace, the United States,
the country which went to war for
equal rights for all, cannot hesitate
to combine with these tendencies, high
spiritual ideals in order to prevent
future wars.
This was the opinion expressed by
Professor von Schultze-Gaevernitz of
the University of Freiburg, Baden,
Germany, who spoke on the "Interde
pendence of the World's Economics,"
last night in the Assembly hall.
In tracing the development of the
present day economic tendencies, and
their results, Gaevernitz raised the
question of whether we are in the be
ginning of a new stage in which na
tional units are secondary and the
whole of mankind is united in one
economic unit in which war would be
impossible.
Commenting on the great evolution
in the direction of world economy in
the nineteenth century, with the dif
ferent nations interdependent and self
supporting, Gaevernitz told of the ne
cessary effect of widespread interna
tional commerce.
Causes of War
War tendencies arise with imperial
interests, and continental divisions,
thinks Gaevernitz. These imperialistic
forces followed the national tendency
of building supernatural units, in his
opinion. And then the exploitation and
monopolies of the last part of the nine
teenth century and first part of this
century resulted, in opposition to in
ternational principles.
Gives Economic History
Gaevernitz showed how, in economic
history, the law of diminishing re
turns and the industrial revcolution,
then increasing importing and export
ing, led to the interdependence of na
tions, and division of labor between
industrial communities.
A new force in this, he explained,
was the international credit system,
which resulted in the further interde
pendence of nations, so that what af
fected one affected all.
