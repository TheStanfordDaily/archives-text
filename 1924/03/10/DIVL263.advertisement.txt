we chose the name
Campus Togs for our clothes
Despite the fact that for twenty-five years we made our clothes and sold
them under the label, Chas. Kaufman & Bros., we chose the name Campus
Togs as significant of the new spirit in clothes for men of all ages.
For the past ten years we have featured Campus Togs as the trade label
for our clothes. It seemed to us significant as a name that would indicate
clothcs designed and proportioned to please discriminating men. It also
signifies in dress the breeze and smartness that the young man or college
boy who travels the campus has, and which puts him in the envied class,
at least from the standpoint of being youthful and making the most of
his age in his appearance.,
To also put youthful appearance into clothes for older men, was the new
feature for our designing department to work out successfully, and in its
achievement we confidently present clothes to the world, for all men,
which measure up to the significance of the trade name we have chosen.
We guarantee our clothes
