The trip to Australia was arranged
through the efforts of the Australian
Universities Sports Association of
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and
Queensland. Word was received some
time ago that such a trip would be
welcomed by the Australian associa
tion on account of the construction of
larger tennis facilities in several cities,
especially one bowl of 10,000 to 15,000
capacity.

As lightning rods contain platinum
they are subject to occasional rifling
by thieves.

In Bahia, Brazil, funeral processions
pass over the city's electric railways
and use street car hearses.

Co-eds at O. A. C. are turning in
copy for the "Unlucky Number" of the
Orange Owl, the comic magazine pub
lished by the Hammer and Coffin chap
ter at that college.
