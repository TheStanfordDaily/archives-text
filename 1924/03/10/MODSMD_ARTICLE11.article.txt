# HELPFUL ADVICE FOR THOSE ABOUT TO GO ON PICNICSâ€”DON'T!
## 
### 
Spring, tra-la, is here.
The grass grows, the birds sing, the
sap stirs in the roots of the trees,
hoists itself up into the buds, and the
poison oak turns red and green with
envy.
The accent is on the poison oak.
Yon innocent-appearing shrub is the
reason for the masks of milky white
ness appearing on the faces of so
many of our young men and women.
The masks are of salve, and are not
worn for ornament, strange as it may
seem. Don't laugh at the sufferers;
you may take it yourself.
As every rose has its thorn, so every
picnic has its poison oak; and the
tubes of poison oak remedy purchased
in the last two weeks would, if laid
end to end, reach from Camp Sears
ville to Strawberry Canyon.
