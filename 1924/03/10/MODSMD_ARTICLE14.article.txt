game, but the Cards were unable to
stem the tide and two more goals were
made by the Clubmen.
With the score 3 to 1 "Dutch" Mc-
Callister was ordered out of the water
for fouling and not permitted to return
until a goal had been shot. The Cards,
now three goals behind and seeing de
feat looming up, increased their fight.
Fletcher and Meyers scored two goals
in quick succession, but "Ginny" Aus
tin, the Club's right forward, also tal
lied. The gun went off for the end of
the game with the score 5 to 3 and
the Cards fighting for the ball in front
of the Olmpic Club goal.
O'Connor Out-Sprints Carson
Schroth, at guard, was the star of
the game, making good use of his
weight, speed, and reach. Carson and
Herrington, with two goals apiece,
lead in the scoring for the Winged "O."
In the contest between O'Connor and
Carson, the center-forward on the
Olympic team, O'Connor easily showed
his superiority, getting the ball seven
out of eight tries.

minutes of play neither side was able
to score. Collett of the Cardinals gave
a fine exhibition of goal-keeping dur
ing the first half, preventing all of the
Olympian shots fired at him from
going through. In the latter part of
this half Stanford began to show the
first signs of playing an offensive game
when Charlie Fletcher made the first
count of the day. Shortly after this
Fletcher was ruled out of the water
because of fouling, and the Cards with
six men kept the Club from scoring.
The half ended with the Cards leading
1 to 0.
Clubmen Tie Score
At the opening of the second period
the Clubmen started off with a rush
and Stanford, still battling with only
six men, was unable to hold them
down. Within forty-five seconds Car
son, on a throw from Schroth, stored
the Olympian's first tally. Fletcher
was then permitted to return to the
game, but the Cards were unable to
stem the tide and two more goals were
made by the Clubmen.
With the score 3 to 1 "Dutch" Mc-
Callister was ordered out of the water
for fouling and not permitted to return
until a goal had been shot. The Cards,
now three goals behind and seeing de
feat looming up, increased their fight.
Fletcher and Meyers scored two goals
in quick succession, but "Ginny" Aus
tin, the Club's right forward, also tal
lied. The gun went off for the end of
the game with the score 5 to 3 and
the Cards fighting for the ball in front
of the Olmpic Club goal.
O'Connor Out-Sprints Carson
Schroth, at guard, was the star of
the game, making good use of his
weight, speed, and reach. Carson and
Herrington, with two goals apiece,
lead in the scoring for the Winged "O."
In the contest between O'Connor and
Carson, the center-forward on the
Olympic team, O'Connor easily showed
his superiority, getting the ball seven
out of eight tries.
