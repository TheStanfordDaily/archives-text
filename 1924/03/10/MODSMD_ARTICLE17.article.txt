# April 26

### 
After the showing made by Coach "Dink" Templeton's track team in
the interclass meet Saturday, every loyal Stanford man and woman should
look forward, more than ever to the events of April 26.
Prospects for a victory over California in the Big Meet on that day
are brighter, by far, than they have been in many years. Stanford will be
strong in practically every event this year. Sprinters, middle distance, and
distance men, are already in mid-season form. In the field events, the
Cardinal will be much stronger than it was last year.
While Stanford has many very fine track athletes, too much credit can
not be given to "Dink" Templeton for the showing they are making. The
majority of these men have developed under his tutelage. He has had a
great deal of hard luck in the past three years. Two years ago, sickness
and unfavorable breaks gave California a to 65YÂ± tie in a meet that
the Cards had apparently won. Last year, scholarship and sickness again
played havoc with the squad.
In spite of the fact that the Big Meet is still six weeks away, it seems
improbable that the jinx will hang on any longer.
The Big Meet will not be the only attraction on April 26. In addition
the deciding games of the varsity and freshman baseball series with Cali
fornia will be played here, and the annual University Day will be cele
brated.
Coach Wolter has a fine diamond team this year. It is the most cap
able that has been developed on the Farm in some time and has an excel
lent chance, barring accidents, to win over the Bruins. The team has re
cently hit a slump but any athletic team is subject to reverses and it is safe
to predict that the squad will find itself soon.
A great deal of credit for the showing of this year's baseball varsity,
is due to Harry Wolter. Any team that can win nine straight games at the
opening of the season before it lflses one, is to be commended.
University Day always brings around one thousand alumni back to the
campus and the events arranged indicate that April 26 will be the biggest
and most successful reunion ever held here.
An alumni reunion is of benefit to both students and alumni. To the
former, it gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the old timers and
the latter group usually grasps the opportunity to "see how things are run
ning now,"
Taken all in all. April 26 should be a day long to be remembered in the
history of Stanford. It will be a day to which alumni may look back for
years to come, and recall pleasant memories.
April 26 should be the slogan of every undergraduate in the university
for the next six weeks. The folks at home will enjoy being here for the
day, and any alumni who are friends should be reminded that they will
miss a great deal if they are not on deck bright and early on the morning
of Saturday, April 26.

Wednesday, March 12, will be the last issue of the Daily Palo Alto for
the winter quarter.

Will the fellow who said the Stadium track was slow kindly step for
ward and receive his medal ?

The large crowd which packed the Assembly Hall at the Glee Club
concert Friday night was well satisfied. The only possible criticism, is
that the program was a trifle long.
