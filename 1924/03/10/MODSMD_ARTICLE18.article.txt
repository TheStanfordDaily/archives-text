The Editor,
Daily Palo Alto,
Campus.
Dear Sir:
May 1 use your columns as a me
dium for expressing the thanks which
the Glee Club owes to the students
and townspeople who supported us in
Friday night's concert and dance, to
the extent of setting a new record for
attendance and appreciation. It is a
great aid to the Club to start out on
its Spring Tour with the knowledge
that our friends on and near the Cam
pus are loyally backing us.
A material help in securing the un
qualified success of the Glee Club's
campus appearance was the generous
publicity which your paper gave it all
last week. The value of a plenty of

"Dippy" write-ups was undeniably
proved.
The plans of the Glee Club for the
immediate future will be of special
interest to those of students who are
to be in Los Angeles the week of
March 24. Every evening that week
the Club will sing in the "Cocoanut
Grove" at the Ambassador hotel be
tween the hours of 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.
On Friday evening, March 28, the
"Fiesta Room" of the same hotel will
be the scene of a "Stanford Night"
celebration —the eve of the U. S. C.
track meet —in which the Glee Club
will also put on stunts between dances.
Again may I thank you and your
readers on behalf of the Club for the
great start given us on our 1924 sea
son by last Friday's turn-out.
Very truly yours,
C. E. Beardsley, Mgr.
