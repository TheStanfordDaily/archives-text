HOW TO BECOME A COLLEGE PROF

Course in Six Payments

The Corrector
To be a successful college prof, one
first has to serve his apprenticeship
as a corrector. This is obviously be
cause of the unimportance of this job.
One has to start at the bottom and
work up, just like in any other busi
ness. For instance, take any success
ful hod-carrier. These fellows all start
at the bottom of the ladder and work
up. Their position in life, of course,
depends directly upon the length of
the ladder.
But now, casting all such serious
ness aside, let's get back to this cor
rectorship. First of all, to be a good
corrector, you must know as little as
possible about the course you are cor
recting. If you have any knowledge of
rhe course at all, you simply can't help
being partial to one paper as against
another. Just because one paper is
better than another is obviously no
reason at all why it should be graded
any higher. Of course not. It is such
recognition of ability that the Univer
sity is striving to suppress, as it leads
to big-lieadedness and an undesirable
surplus of ego.
* * *
Now, after you have assured your
self of your ignorance concerning the
course, the next thing to do is to get
a hold of some blue-books. This is
very easy. You can find 'em by the
hundreds in any prof's wastebasket.
They don't want the things. They only
give ex's because it's conventional
anyway. Sometimes, when his basket
is full, you can find them scattered
around the prof's private office. He'll
thank you to take them away, as he
has no place to put his feet as long as
they clutter up his desk.
Now after you get the papers, you're
practically all through. In order to in
sure an equal and unbiased treatment
for all papers alike, the University
has mapped out a definite yet simple
procedure which you, as the corrector,
have to follow in the grading of all
papers. It's done like this. Simply take
a batch of papers, ten or fifteen at a
time will do, and, standing twenty feet
away from the closed door of your of
fice, try and heave 'em through the
transom. Repeat this, until you have
thrown all the papers at the transom.
* * #
Now, all the papers that went
through the transom and stuck on the
ceiling of the next room, receive the
grade of A. All that went through and
stuck on the walls of the next room
get a B. All those that went through
and stood up on edge on the floor of
the next room get a C. All that went
through, and merely lay flat on the
floor, are D's. Then all the papers that
didn't go through the transom at all
are straight minuses.
Check up carefully the position of
each paper, and enter the grades in
your grade book. If you can find it.
And if you can't find it, why don't
worry about it. Life's too short to
worry about things like that. Chances
are, the prof won't think of looking at
it anyway, when he makes out the
final grades.
* * *
After that's done, mix the papers all
up, taking care not to get them in
alphabetical order, and place them in
the wrong boxes at the next meeting
of the class. Then pack your suitcase
and leave the following note on the
door of your office:
"GONE TO EUROPE. BACK NEXT
YEAR MAYBE. IF YOU'VE GOT
ANY KICKS ON YOUR PAPERS,
TELL 'EM TO SWEENEY. YOU'LL
NEVER CATCH ME. BYE-BYE!"
—K. H.
I hear you lost your coolc.
Yeah, "My Swedie went away."
Speaking of the Israelite immigra
tion, I hear the tuition is going to be
raised.

The Corrector
To be a successful college prof, one
first has to serve his apprenticeship
as a corrector. This is obviously be
cause of the unimportance of this job.
One has to start at the bottom and
work up, just like in any other busi
ness. For instance, take any success
ful hod-carrier. These fellows all start
at the bottom of the ladder and work
up. Their position in life, of course,
depends directly upon the length of
the ladder.
But now, casting all such serious
ness aside, let's get back to this cor
rectorship. First of all, to be a good
corrector, you must know as little as
possible about the course you are cor
recting. If you have any knowledge of
rhe course at all, you simply can't help
being partial to one paper as against
another. Just because one paper is
better than another is obviously no
reason at all why it should be graded
any higher. Of course not. It is such
recognition of ability that the Univer
sity is striving to suppress, as it leads
to big-lieadedness and an undesirable
surplus of ego.
* * *
Now, after you have assured your
self of your ignorance concerning the
course, the next thing to do is to get
a hold of some blue-books. This is
very easy. You can find 'em by the
hundreds in any prof's wastebasket.
They don't want the things. They only
give ex's because it's conventional
anyway. Sometimes, when his basket
is full, you can find them scattered
around the prof's private office. He'll
thank you to take them away, as he
has no place to put his feet as long as
they clutter up his desk.
Now after you get the papers, you're
practically all through. In order to in
sure an equal and unbiased treatment
for all papers alike, the University
has mapped out a definite yet simple
procedure which you, as the corrector,
have to follow in the grading of all
papers. It's done like this. Simply take
a batch of papers, ten or fifteen at a
time will do, and, standing twenty feet
away from the closed door of your of
fice, try and heave 'em through the
transom. Repeat this, until you have
thrown all the papers at the transom.
* * #
Now, all the papers that went
through the transom and stuck on the
ceiling of the next room, receive the
grade of A. All that went through and
stuck on the walls of the next room
get a B. All those that went through
and stood up on edge on the floor of
the next room get a C. All that went
through, and merely lay flat on the
floor, are D's. Then all the papers that
didn't go through the transom at all
are straight minuses.
Check up carefully the position of
each paper, and enter the grades in
your grade book. If you can find it.
And if you can't find it, why don't
worry about it. Life's too short to
worry about things like that. Chances
are, the prof won't think of looking at
it anyway, when he makes out the
final grades.
* * *
After that's done, mix the papers all
up, taking care not to get them in
alphabetical order, and place them in
the wrong boxes at the next meeting
of the class. Then pack your suitcase
and leave the following note on the
door of your office:
"GONE TO EUROPE. BACK NEXT
YEAR MAYBE. IF YOU'VE GOT
ANY KICKS ON YOUR PAPERS,
TELL 'EM TO SWEENEY. YOU'LL
NEVER CATCH ME. BYE-BYE!"
—K. H.
I hear you lost your coolc.
Yeah, "My Swedie went away."
Speaking of the Israelite immigra
tion, I hear the tuition is going to be
raised.
