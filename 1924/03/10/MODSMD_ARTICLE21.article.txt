# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor:
Dear Sir:
As briefly as possible, because of
the lack of space, may I answer the
charges against me appearing in last
week's Dailies?
My budget was presented on about
the second Tuesday in January, and
was for less than $400. For some reason
or other the Executive Gommittee
chose not to meet that night. A few
days later I asked for the expense
money to send the team to Los An
geles. It was given to me, and not a
word was said. I now learn that this
was the beginning of my "big stick"
practices!
Sometime early in February, the
president of the student body told me
not to figure on an eastern trip, as it
would take too much money. Now it
seems that this was the conversation
from which I was to imply that my
budget had been turned down and that
I was to revise it!
Nothing to the contrary ever having
been said, I naturally supposed, as
had been done the previous quarter,
that the budget had been approved, and
that I could call on the student mana
ger for funds when needed, staying
within the amount named. Last Mon
day I was informed the budget had
been refused sanction. Feeling that
sanction for a regularly scheduled de
bate surely would be forthcoming, my
colleague and I advanced the money,
in order to secure a necessary night's
rest, in Seattle. More "big stick" meth
ods!
It is entirely too easy to make state
ments without investigation and to
thereupon jump at conclusions. That
is evident in reading the accusations
made against me. Although no student
body officer ever has exhibited the
least interest in the activity of debat
ing, or showed any desire to co-oper
ate, I have tried, with the co-operation
of those *who are interested, to ad
vance the activity a few steps here at
Stanford. I naturally resent having
motives and actions attributed to me
without proper foundation and which
are derogatory in character.
Sincerely,
Robert E. Lewis. I
