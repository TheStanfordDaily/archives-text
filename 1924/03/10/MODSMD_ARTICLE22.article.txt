"Basket shooting is quite different from snipe shooting and crap shooting,
although the same delicate twist of the wrist and lift of the eyebrows is
necessary to all three. The secret of my success is so simple that there's
nothing in it —it's a vacuum. Any good electric sweeper may be attached to
your basket before the game, and when the juice is turned on, it automatically
sucks in all of your shots and makes suckers out of your opponents. Another
stunt, suggested by the late David O'Laith, is to have two of your team wear
a huge rubber band —or even a pair of suspenders—which forms a sling-shot
to be used in shooting baskets from the further end of the court. "Shoot to
kill!"
