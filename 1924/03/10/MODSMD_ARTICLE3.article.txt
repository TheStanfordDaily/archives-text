# CLAMBAKE GIVEN BY SIGMA DELTA CHI IS FIZZLE; PICNIC GOOD
## 
### 
Sigma Delta Chi's clambake at the
coast yesterday degenerated into a
mere picnic due to the inability of
the Daily editor to dig enough clams
to satisfy the ravenous appetites of
the twenty-sixe men, women and chil
dren who helped the journalists cele
brate Founders' Day.
Food in abundance supplied the ma
terial needs of the newspaper enthusi
asts, and their gymnastic require
ments were satisfied by a tight base
ball game between two teams, cap
tained by Carl Shoup and Daniel
Boone. Shoup's aggregation was com
posed of seven future Big League
aspirants, while Boone was content
to struggle along with a ten-man
squad.
The score, 7-3 in favor of the Boone
diamond artists, showed that numbers
and not brains sometimes win.
