# GLEE CLUB RECITAL WELL RECEIVED BY AUDIENCE
## Arnold Bayley, David Lamson Score Success in Radio Imitation Stunt 
### Ray Spangler 
Undergraduate opinion of the Glee l
Club's cnocert in the Assembly hall
Friday night is summed up in one
typical utterance: "Say, boy, that was
great!"
Starting with Bach's rugged, human
composition, "Now Let Every Tongue
Adore Thee," and ending with the rol
licking strain of the "Three Sea Chan
ties," the program pleased nearly
every appreciation possible. A total of
ten encores was given.
Radio Stunt Scores Success
Arnold Bayley, assisted by Dave j
Lamson, presented the "Radio Robot,"!
which included vocal imitations
of steamboats, concrete mixers, Schu
mann-Heink, cows, street cars, prize
fights, and the flower-fairy bedtime
story. Bayley, who already has built
up a reputation in Los Angeles, should
score a big success with this new
number at the Ambassador hotel when !
the Glee Club sings there March 24-29. |
Diction Clear
The diction of the club in all of its
numbers was Clear, and the texts of !
the songs reached the audience dis-j
tinctly. This was particularly evident
in "Son Jour, Ma Belle," by Behrend,
a difficult mixture of bad French and
pigeon English, upon which depends!
its success.
Palestrina's "Improperia" was given j
with marke dability in the dynamics!
of music. Director Warren D. Allen!
controlled the crescendos, the diminu
endos, retards, and accelerandos with
nearly the same dominance he exer-1
cises over the Memorial Church organ.
The "Improperia." with its consonant
harmonies and mystic beauty, con
trasted with the preceding selection j
of Bach, who. writing a century later
than Palestrina, sacrificed beauty to
idea.
Solos Please Audience
Perhaps the most successful of thei
solos was the most ambitious. Charles
Stratton put timidity in the back-!
ground when he attempted the "Torea-j
dor Song" from "Carmen." His inter
pretation was not that of the fiery
Spaniard, but rather staid and Anglo-
Saxon. But Stratton succeeded so well
that the audience demanded that he
sing his song again.
Martin D'Andrea's neapolitan songs J
were well-received. Quite unemotional, j
D'Andrea does his best work in the j
light, rhythmic Italian compositions of
the type that he sang Friday night. 1
The Volga boat song, in Russian, |
was a little weaker than the other j
chorus numbers on the program. Sev- i
eral of the attacks were slightly ir-j
regular, but the nearly perfect diminu- ;
endo that finishes the piece saved it '
from mediocrity.

Cloves come from Indies and take
their name from the Latin clauvis,
meaning "a nail."

solos was the most ambitious. Charles
Stratton put timidity in the back-!
ground when he attempted the "Torea-j
dor Song" from "Carmen." His inter
pretation was not that of the fiery
Spaniard, but rather staid and Anglo-
Saxon. But Stratton succeeded so well
that the audience demanded that he
sing his song again.
Martin D'Andrea's neapolitan songs J
were well-received. Quite unemotional, j
D'Andrea does his best work in the j
light, rhythmic Italian compositions of
the type that he sang Friday night. 1
The Volga boat song, in Russian, |
was a little weaker than the other j
chorus numbers on the program. Sev- i
eral of the attacks were slightly ir-j
regular, but the nearly perfect diminu- ;
endo that finishes the piece saved it '
from mediocrity.

Cloves come from Indies and take
their name from the Latin clauvis,
meaning "a nail."
Undergraduate opinion of the Glee l
Club's cnocert in the Assembly hall
Friday night is summed up in one
typical utterance: "Say, boy, that was
great!"
Starting with Bach's rugged, human
composition, "Now Let Every Tongue
Adore Thee," and ending with the rol
licking strain of the "Three Sea Chan
ties," the program pleased nearly
every appreciation possible. A total of
ten encores was given.
Radio Stunt Scores Success
Arnold Bayley, assisted by Dave j
Lamson, presented the "Radio Robot,"!
which included vocal imitations
of steamboats, concrete mixers, Schu
mann-Heink, cows, street cars, prize
fights, and the flower-fairy bedtime
story. Bayley, who already has built
up a reputation in Los Angeles, should
score a big success with this new
number at the Ambassador hotel when !
the Glee Club sings there March 24-29. |
Diction Clear
The diction of the club in all of its
numbers was Clear, and the texts of !
the songs reached the audience dis-j
tinctly. This was particularly evident
in "Son Jour, Ma Belle," by Behrend,
a difficult mixture of bad French and
pigeon English, upon which depends!
its success.
Palestrina's "Improperia" was given j
with marke dability in the dynamics!
of music. Director Warren D. Allen!
controlled the crescendos, the diminu
endos, retards, and accelerandos with
nearly the same dominance he exer-1
cises over the Memorial Church organ.
The "Improperia." with its consonant
harmonies and mystic beauty, con
trasted with the preceding selection j
of Bach, who. writing a century later
than Palestrina, sacrificed beauty to
idea.
