Little Minister" before James Barrie
in his London home. Later she went
to his old home town, Thrums, and
gave the same reading in the town hall
before the author's boyhood friends.

cially artistic.

ment House in Canada and at the

her work, C. M. Wise, professor of
Dramatic Literature at the State
Teachers College in Missouri, says,
"Those who knew Barrie well followed

who knew Barrie less perfectly found
their inclination to read and analyse
him powerfully stimulated."
