INTERCLASS TRACK MEET POINTS
Seniors 63%
Juniors 45
Sophomores . .-36'/ 2
Freshmen 29%

OCORING heavily in the field events, the seniors nosed out the juniors for
first place in the annual Interclass track and field meet Saturday, having
63% points to 45 for the third year men.
The seniors actually made but 53% counters in the meet, but they were
given an additional ten points for winning the Irish Marathon last week. The
juniors were slightly ahead throughout most of the meet, but the fourth year
team took three places in the broad jump, the last event to be finished, and
these points put the seniors ahead of their opponents.
The sophomores showed more strength than was expected and came third,
having a margin of seven over the freshmen, who were last.
Miller Surprises
Ted Miller came through in great shape in the quarter, covering the
distance in 50 flat. Miller was yards ahead of Van Judah, who came second.
As Judah is not registered this quarter his place was not counted for the
seniors.
The half mile was the most closely-contested race of the day. Tne runners
kept bunched until the last 200 yards, with A1 Smith in the lead. Going
down the home stretch, Bill Richardson uncorked a brilliant spurt and

sailed into the lead. His time was
1:57 flat.
Fred Anderson upset the dope by
copping first in the high jump. Ander
son cleared the bar at G feet % inch.
Richmann, who was considered to have
a good chance to win, was tied for
second with Lou Ivemnitzer
With but one exception the veterans
of last year did what was expected of
them. That exception was when lan
Campbell got off to a poor start in the
220, and was passed by Storie and
Adams. Hartranft and Leistner each
took two firsts, tying them for high
point honors.
The summary:
100-yard dash —Campbell ('24), first;
Gaspar ('26), second; Storie ('25),
third; Adams ('27), fourth. Time 0:10
flat.
220-yard dash —Storie ('25), first;
