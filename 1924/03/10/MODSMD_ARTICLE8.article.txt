stop the match, however, and Martin
was forced to deliver the final sleep
producing punch.

quest of the Aggies, the bout was not
continued through the third round.
Price Robinson (S) lost by a tech
nical knockout, to Smith (C.A.). Smith
began by swinging somewhat wildly

threw in the sponge, giving Smith a
technical knockout.
