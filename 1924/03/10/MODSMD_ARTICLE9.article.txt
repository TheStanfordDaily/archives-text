# VARSITY NINE LOSES RAGGED GAME TO OLYMPICS, 5-2
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers, pitching his first game
for the varsity, was hit freely for the
six innings he was in the box, and Stan
ford lost to the Olympic Club in Sat
urday's game, 5-2.
The club sluggers inflicted most of the
damage in the third. Heckcndorff, first
man up for the Olympians, smashed a
hot one to Mulchay at short, who made
a beautiful stop, and threw Heckcndorff
out at first. Nevers walked O'Toole, who
came home on Altschul's double to left.
Hermle Hits Triple
Hermle, the first baseman who comes
in for more than his share of booing in
every game he plays at Stanford, had
the laugh on the bleachers Saturday. In
this spasm he came through with a triple,
sending Altschul home.
Smith followed Hermle to the plate
with a determined look in his eye but
could do no more than to pop a foul fly
to Lawson for the second out. Hermle
scored when Rose doubled down the third
base line, and Rose came in on an error
by Roberts.
The varsity came back in the same
inning and on a walk by Roberts, a single
from Cuddeback's bat, and an error on
the part of the Olympic's right fielder,
scored one run.
O'Toole turned Stanford back with
ease for the rest of the afternoon with
the exception of the eighth inning. John
ston hit to the fence in left center for
two bases, sending Cuddeback, who had
singled, to third. May slapped out a
sacrifice fly to center, allowing Cudde
back to score.
Oviatt replaced Nevers after the sixth
and was faced by only nine men in the
following three innings.
Hermle Stars for Olympics
Hermle, with a double and a triple,
featured for the Olympics. Roberts on
second for Stanford, pulled a circus
catch of Heckendorff's grounder in the
sixth, making the second time that Lefty
had been robbed of a hit by the varsity
infielders.
Cuddeback and Fuller each collected
two blows for the varsity.
