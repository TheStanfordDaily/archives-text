# CARD NINE MEETS BRONCS IN SECOND CAME TOMORROW
## Reversal of Form About Due; Varsity Hurlers in Good Condition for Game 
### 
Having taken a close game from
the Stanford varsity in the first game
of the baseball series, a confident
Santa Clara team will visit the cam
pus for the second contest tomorrow.
The game will start at 3:30 on the
varsity diamond.
Coach Harry Wolters has three
pitchers aching for a turn in the box.
Teague, Solomon, and Lowenstein
have all had sufficient rest to give
the visitors a battle.
Wolters is not discouraged over the
fact that the varsity has lost its last
four games and feels that a pro
nounced reversal of form is about due.
Hitting Has Been Weak
The hurlers on the squad have been
turning in fair performances but their
teammates have failed to hit when
hits meant runs. It is a known fact that
there are sluggers on the team and
when they start hitting their stride
again, Stanford will come out on top
in a few games.
The Pittsburgh Pirates will oppose
the varsity on the Stanford diamond
a week from Saturday in a game that
should prove of real interest to all
baseball fans.
St. Mary's will meet the Cardinals
this Saturday.
