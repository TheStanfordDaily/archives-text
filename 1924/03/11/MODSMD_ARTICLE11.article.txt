# JAZZ AT STANFORD IN 1913
## First "Ragtime" Orchestra Offers Music At Senior Ball In Vendome Hotel 
### 
Very different from the harmonious
syncopation of today's dance musi
cians was the first jazz orchestra
which made its appearance at. a cam
pus dance just eleven years ago.
It was at the Senior Ball which was
held at the Vendome Hotel in 1913 that
Irving Perkins, San Francisco pianist,
with a group of six other musicians,
played the first notes of jazz officially
for a Stanford dance.
Accordian for Jazz
At that time, the music was called
"ragtime," and consisted of an accor
dian, two banjos, a trombone, and a
drum, in addition to the piano.
This was a great advance from the
orchestras of violins, flutes, and cellos
which had formerly furnished the in
centive for dancing, and it delighted

students so greatly that Perkins im
mediately received four or five en
gagements to play at house dances
for the next year. He also played at
the next year's Senior Ball.
"The boys themselves started to get
up orchestras," said Perkins, "and of
course you know what wonderful
things they have accomplished along
that line today."
Tango Became Popular
It was a big jump from the classical
music which had formerly accom
panied their two steps and waltzes,
to the jazz which formed an accom
paniment to the tango and hesitation
which became popular at that time,
according to Perkins.
The music, in his opinion, was
crude, and illustrated the idea of
"every man for himself," for the more
noise the instrument could make the
better it was. "Those were the days
in which the cowbell became popular,"
says Perkins. "It has only been during
the last six years that the saxaphone
and other of the jazz instruments have
developed."
Old Favorites
Pieces in favor in "the old days"
were the "Maurice Tango"; "Inter
national Rag"; "That's How I Need
You"; "When I Leave the World Be
hind"; and "Too Much Mustard."
