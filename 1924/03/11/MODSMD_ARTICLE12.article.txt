# PHI KAP FIRE PUT OUT WITH WATER GLASS
## 
### 
Fire was responsible for excitement
but no serious damage in the Phi
Kappa Sigma house yesterday after
noon. It is thought to have been caused
by tar-paper catching fire from a de
fective chimney.
One of the brothers put the blaze
out with a glass of water while an
other phoned wildly for the fire en
gines. After getting a wrong number
and the Palo Alto fire department he
had no little trouble in convincing the
campus chief that there was really a
fire.
The department arrived as the last
of the disappointed roughs was leav
ing. and chopped up the side of tho
house to show what they would have
done had it been necessary. What the
campus needs is bigger and better
fires or no one will come to them
any more.
