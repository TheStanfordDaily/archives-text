# TRACKSTERS SET FOR WINGED 'O' INVASION
## 
### 
A galaxy of stars wearing the
Winged "O" of the Olympic Club will
invade the Stanford Farm Saturday,
seeking revenge for the defeats ad
ministered them by the Cards in the
last two years.
The club roster includes such names
as Sudden, Cochran, Boyden, Doerr,
Norris, McGurn, Merchant, Hanner,
and Sorrenti. These men are all num
bered among the best in the country
and are very capable of giving the
Redshirts a run for their money. The
real strength of the Post street team
cannot be determined until it arrives
on the campus, and the exact number
of celebrities that have been picked
up for the occasion, can be seen.
The meet should be close. Stanford
can win if Coach "Dink" Templeton's
men perform the way they did in the
interclass meet. The hammer throw
is still in controversy and it may be
that this event will not be held, as was
originally agreed upon some time ago.
If this event is ruled out it will be a
big blow to the Olympics, because
they are confident of taking nine
points in it.
Gaspar Shows Form
Louie Gaspar looked good in the
sprints Saturday. He was right on lan
Campbell's heels in the finals of the
hundred, and had found little difficulty
in winning his heat. Gaspar got a
fourth in the 220, while the best
Campbell could do was take a third.
The furlong is really Campbell's best
race, and if he doesn't get left on the
start he should be able to show Eddie
Sudden a few tricks. Marshall Hale,
capable of 0:10 flat in the hundred,
was unable to run last week. but.
"Dink" .expects to have him in togs
against the clubmen.
Bill Storie and Ted Miller form a
fast quarter-mile team. Storie can run
in less than 0:50, and Miller ran 0':50.
in the interclass meet. Cochran, who
runs this race for the Olympics, hails
from the University of Minnesota, and
while representing that school won
the quarter at the N. C. A. A. for two
years in succession. Storie has never
had to exert himself since he has been
at Stanford, but it will take all he has
to defeat the Olympic runner.

Winged "O" of the Olympic Club will
invade the Stanford Farm Saturday,
seeking revenge for the defeats ad
ministered them by the Cards in the
last two years.
The club roster includes such names
as Sudden, Cochran, Boyden, Doerr,
Norris, McGurn, Merchant, Hanner,
and Sorrenti. These men are all num
bered among the best in the country
and are very capable of giving the
Redshirts a run for their money. The
real strength of the Post street team
cannot be determined until it arrives
on the campus, and the exact number
of celebrities that have been picked
up for the occasion, can be seen.
The meet should be close. Stanford
can win if Coach "Dink" Templeton's
men perform the way they did in the
interclass meet. The hammer throw
is still in controversy and it may be
that this event will not be held, as was
originally agreed upon some time ago.
If this event is ruled out it will be a
big blow to the Olympics, because
they are confident of taking nine
points in it.
Gaspar Shows Form
Louie Gaspar looked good in the
sprints Saturday. He was right on lan
Campbell's heels in the finals of the
hundred, and had found little difficulty
in winning his heat. Gaspar got a
fourth in the 220, while the best
Campbell could do was take a third.
The furlong is really Campbell's best
race, and if he doesn't get left on the
start he should be able to show Eddie
Sudden a few tricks. Marshall Hale,
capable of 0:10 flat in the hundred,
was unable to run last week. but.
"Dink" .expects to have him in togs
against the clubmen.
Bill Storie and Ted Miller form a
fast quarter-mile team. Storie can run
in less than 0:50, and Miller ran 0':50.
in the interclass meet. Cochran, who
runs this race for the Olympics, hails
from the University of Minnesota, and
while representing that school won
the quarter at the N. C. A. A. for two
years in succession. Storie has never
had to exert himself since he has been
at Stanford, but it will take all he has
to defeat the Olympic runner.
