# Anonymous Communications
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto has received several anonymous communications
in the past few weeks. Some of them have been meritorious and some of
them otherwise. However, none of them has been published because of
the existing rule against unsigned viewpoints.
For the sake of perfect clearness, the Daily's rule in regard to this
matter is here repeated. "Any meritorious communication, not in excess
of 200 words, which is signed by the writer, will be published in the Daily
Palo Alto, provided that it is in the hands of the editor before ten o'clock
of the day on which it is to be published. The name of the writer will be
withheld upon request."
It is just a trifle difficult to understand why a man, who believes thor
oughly in what he writes, is unwilling to sign his name to the communica
tion, especially when it will not appear in print.
Every newspaper is troubled with anonymous contributors and in al
most every case, the unknown authors are ignored.
Probably the most interesting of these anonymous writers who has
come to the attention of the Daily Palo Alto recently, is the one who de
plored the unfair way in which the editor wrote one of his editorials. The
mysterious writer wrote a very caustic communication, but chose not to
sign his name. When informed through the editorial columns of the Daily
that his viewpoint would be published when his name was made known, he
wrote an even more sarcastic and personal note to the editor.
The envelope was addressed in this way:
To the "Editor" (?)
Daily Palo Alto,
Campus.
Perhaps the writer thinks that type of thing to be fair. 1f he does, the
Daily Palo Alto fails to agree with him. That kind of an attitude is best
ignored completely, and in the future, any such will be consigned to the
waste basket without further consideration.
