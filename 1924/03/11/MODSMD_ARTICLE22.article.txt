# Tuesday Lectures
## 
### 
In another column, today, is published a communication in regard to a
story which appeared in the Daily Palo Alto of March 6.
In this viewpoint, the Daily is indebted to Professor Peirce foi a most
sensible and constructive criticism. Possibly there is some misunderstand
ing.
The Daily Palo Alto does not minimize the importance of the Tuesday
evening lectures. They are, as a rule, of a very instructive and entertain
ing character, and merit a larger attendanc on the part of students.
Not only do they give the students an opportunity for an evening's en
tertainment and instruction, with a change from the classroom routine,
but they are appreciated by the people of Palo Alto. 1 alo Alto is very
defiinitely a part of Stanford University, and her people are close follow
ers of campus activities.
Certainly, it seems that if the people of Palo Alto appreciate the \alue
of the Tuesday lectures enough to attend regularly, students who are right
here on the campus should turn out in larger numbers.
Types of program vary from week to week. Lectures, readings, and
concerts, are the most frequent. Tuesday evening is not often a busy one
and the lectures seldom last longer than an hour.
A little wholesome entertainment, along with classroom work and out
side activities, will benefit any student. Ihe Daily Palo Alto heartily
agrees with Professor Peirce that the Tuesday lectures are worthy of stu
dent support.
