# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor,
Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:
Those who read local papers have
recently seen letters from Palo Alto
townspeople in which the Stanford
"rough" was made to occupy an un
enviable position—to put it mildly.
It seems that "certain objectionable
roughs from the University" make it
a habit to rough Paly high school
dances where, it is alleged, their pres
ence exerts a certain demoralizing—
to say nothing of immoralizing—in
fluence.
To most true roughs the pleasure
in roughing dances is questionable. On
the other hand, the "roughing" of a
"prep" school dance is simply out of
the question. But unfortunately there
is always a certain small percentage
in every university that exhibits —con-
sidering their position—an unbeliev
ably small amount of "savior faire."
The nature of that species is such
that neither letters of Palo Alto towns
people variety nor thiß will penetrate.

This group is classed by the uniniti
ated under the category of "roughs."
It is unfair, obviously, to blame the
roughs for the misdeeds of those who
do not belong. It is the purpose of this
epistle to suggest a suitable appella
tion for the thus far unclassified "cer
tain small percentage." I suggest we
call them "peewees"—and connect
such contempt and scorn to the name
that the most peeweeistically inclined
will be consciously careful to cerebrate
a little before giving way to their in
stinctive impulses.

The Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
Stanford University,

Dear Sir:
Some years ago I overtook two stu
dents on their way to a Tuesday eve
ning meeting. The one was saying, "I
don't know what a String Quartet is.
I'm going over to find out." The occa
sion was a concert, or recital, in the
Little Theatre, by the Savannah String
Quartet. The student who was "going
over to find out" proved the value of
the idea which prompted the revival
of the Tuesday evening meetings, soon

after Dr. Wilbur's accession to the
Presidency of Stanford University.
The Tuesday evening meetings were
resumed for two purposes: to give to
the members of the University com
munity a greater variety of intellectu
al stimuli than they could receive by
taking courses; and to make additional
return to the public for the exemption
from taxation which the University
enjoys. The "leisure class of Palo Alto"
showed its appreciation by coming
early and, on the most popular eve
nings, so fully occupying the seats in
the Little Theatre that many members
of the University found only standing
room, and formed the habit of stay
ing away.
Between the limited capacity of the
Little Theatre and the size of the
Assembly hall there is the contrast
between coziness and barrenness. We
have no autditorium for seven or eight
hundred persons. But in the Assembly
hall one may always count on a seat.
The wisdom of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises in holding the Tuesday
evening meetings in the Assembly hall
is evident, for the audiences, as the
record shows, are growing. "The lei
sure class of Palo Alto," as a matter
of fact, is not attending in much larger
number, but the members of the Uni
versity are doing so.
Your "story" of the Tuesday eve
nings, which appeared on March 6th,
is therefore misinforming. As "amuse
ments" the Tuesday evenings are no
rivals of games or movies, but as en
tertainments they are rewarding. They
are brief, punctual, varied, and afford
glimpses into many lines of activity.
Musical recitals, vocal and instru
mental, seem most, attractive, and
there is evident appreciation of the
occasional opportunities to hear mem
bers of our own community outside
their own classrooms.
The members of the University may
well realize that an occasion which
comes once a week, at a convenient
hour after dinner, which lasts only an
hour, and which enables one to see
and hear many other things than those
of classroom, laboratory, library, ath
letics, and other features of college
life, is worth considering, worth at
tending. It is like the "Literary Di
gest" and the "Saturday Evening
Post," a crisp summary of very many
interests. Why not "go over and find
out?"
Yours truly,
George H. Peirce,
Professor of Botany.
