# University Press Loses To Corporation Yard, 11-1
## 
### 
With the aid of an imported pitcher
the Corporation Yard ball tossers de
feated the University Press nine 11 to
1 on the varsity diamond yesterday.
Each aggregation had previously
won one encounter, hence this victory
cinched the series for the Corporation
Yard.
"Mike" Callahan, catcher for the
Yard team, crashed out a home run in
the first with two men on for the
first runs of the game.
Manager McNabb of the Press team
made the only run for his nine.
The next game for the Press men
will be played with Sequoia Club on
the Sequoia diamond. All of these
games are mere preliminaries for the
ultimate three-game series with the
Daily Palo Alto staff which will be
played the first of the spring quarter.
