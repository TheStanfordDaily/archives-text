### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among those present in the National handball tournament which takes
place in the Los Angeles Athletic club courts in the near future will be two
boys from the Pacific coast who will be hard to beat. Red Murray, the present
national champion, of the Olympic Club of San Francisco, is a rugged hard
liittin' fool who smites the pill with his closed fist and trains on road work like
a prize fighter. Maynard L#«well, whom Murray beat in the finals of last
year's tournament at St. Paul, is a smooth working player, using the open
hand when he plays. "Laz" has worked the movies, but don't hold that
against him —he will be very hard to beat in his own courts (that's what they
said last year about Dr. Haedge of St. Paul* twice a former champion).
