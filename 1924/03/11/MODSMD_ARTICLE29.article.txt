# MODERN NEWSPAPER EDITOR IS COMPARED WITH MINISTER
## 
### 
The modern newspaper editor was
compared to the minister by John R.
Giblyn, representative of a New York
publishing house, in a talk at Kansas
University recently. He made the dis
tinction that the editor has infinitely
greater possibilities for reaching a
larger "congregation" without the dan
ger of having them walk out on him
if they do not like the "sermon."
