# HOOF, MOUTH DISEASE OUSTS PIGEON FLOCK
## 
### 
The cooing of pigeons around the
Library will no longer give solace to
the weary student who toils away in
his pursuit of knowledge. For years
these birds have been part of the at
mosphere around the Library and
University buildings, but now traps
have been set on campus buildings
by the order of University officials in
an effort to kill off the pigeons as
carriers of the hoof and mouth disease.
The trapping was started as a result
of the action of the Palo Alto Stock
Farm in shooting pigeons found about
the barns. Although the hoof and
mouth disease has been controlled
around Oakland, the Stock Farm is
still taking precautions and has erect
ed "No Parking" signs at all en
trances to the farm and has employed
an armed guard to enforce the edict.
