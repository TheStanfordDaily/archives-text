# HONOR SYSTEM SUSPENDED AT UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI
## 
### 
The honor system in all classes was
suspended by the Student Council at
the University of Missouri recently. It
will require a petition of 90 per cent of
the student body to reinstate the sys
tem.
The change was made upon the
recommendation of Laurence DeMuth,
president of the Missouri University
student body. "Snitching" was given
as one of the causes for the failure of
the system.
