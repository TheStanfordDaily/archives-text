# BABES DOWN SENIORS IN INTERCLASS TILT
## 
### 
Freshman diamond artists displayed
real speed yesterday and downed the
hitherto undefeated senior crew, 9 to
5. The much-touted seniors were un
equal to the combination of fast team
work and good pitching displayed by
the first-year men.
The seniors, in the person of "Nip"
McHose, scored, the first run. After a
single, McHose was brought home on
a three-bagger by Deffebach. The
freshmen did not score in the first
inning.
The third frame marked the begin
ning of the freshman rally. Morrill and
Smythe singled, and came home 011 an
overthrow to second. The first-year
men made two more in the fourth,
Sheets bringing in a home run.
The fifth was the prize round for
the freshmen. Clark, senior pitcher,
weakened, and five wearers of the dink
galloped around the field.
After their lone tally in the first
the seniors did not score until the
fourth. Heckendorf walked, Deffebach
singled, and Edwards brought them
in on a three-bagger. McHose and
Bumbaugh accounted for senior scores
in the fifth, completing the seniors'
five runs.
Both teams are out for blood, as the
game decides their relative positions.
Should the sophomores win, they stand
a show to tie for first place in the
series, as they have lost but one game.
The juniors have lost two; so the
best they can do is take third.
