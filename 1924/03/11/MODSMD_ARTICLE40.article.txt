# CAMPUS COP FOILS STUDENTS WHO TRY TO PARK NEAR QUAD
## 
### 
We hear that student motorists who
try to save a little time by driving
their cars to class are being foiled by
a watch-dog of the University who has
recently been stationed just inside
the post line down there opposite the
Engineering Corner.
It seems that tht University wants
all the cars strung in a nice straight
line along Portola street. Late comers
find that Toyon is about as close as
they can come to getting near the
Quad, and it's as good as two reels of
Mack Sennett at his best, to see the
afore-mentioned improvised traffic cop
making frenzied efforts to keep the
students from creeping into their old
accustomed berths.
Zero hour seems to come around
eight o'clock in the morning, and en
thusiastic spectators report that stu
dent motorists, bent on making eight
o'clocks lead the fellow a merry chase.
Hurriedly compiled statistics disclose
the disconcerting facts that in one
morning alone, he barely escaped be
ing run over on thirty-two different
occasions.
It seems likely that it won't be long
now until the University installs a 25c
parking station down there by the
Library. Anyhow, disgruntled motor
ists are said to be murmuring, "Los
Angeles was never like this."
