# Motorists Asked Not to Visit Quarantined Sections
## 
### 
An appeal to California motorists to |
aid in overcoming 'the prevalent hoof
and mouth disease was made yester- i
day by E. M. Hagen, secretary of the
California Cattlemen's Association. I
|
Hagen explained that human beings j
can be a large factor in spreading the
disease many miles from the place â€¢
where it is picked up. He said that'
there is a tendency for many people '
to visit the infected areas out of idle !
curiosity and that if this could be
eliminated it would help materially in
controlling the situation.
"This appeal is not made to those
who must visit the infected areas upon j
business," said Hagen, through Percy j
E. Towne, general counsel of the'
Automobile Club, "nor to those who j
may have occasion to drive through j
on the principal highways and roads.
It is an appeal to motorists in general
to refrain from wandering into ranch
roads and by-ways unnecessarily in
search of curiosity-impelled 'close-ups'
of the results of this tragedy to stock
owners."
