## 
### 
Oil paintings by Carlos Vierra, de
picting many of the missions of the
Southwest, are now on exhibition at
the Stanford Art Gallery until March
23.
Vierra is a native of San Francisco
who has made Santa Fe his home for
so long that he seems to have caught
the spirit of the locality. Before going
there he rounded Cape Horn in his
travels. He is well known as a marine
painter and illustrator for New York
magazines.
The paintings of the Arizona and
New Mexico missions are full of the
color typical of the Indian country—
the warm mellow buff, salmon tones,
and brilliant deep blues, and blue
greens. The buildings are shown in
the soft rounded lines peculiar to the
adobe architecture and are painted in
a strong virile technique. In a few in
stances Indian figures with their
splash of brilliant colors have been
brought in to give life to the color
scheme.
In the center of one wall is placed
the famous Cathedral RoJ*k, from
which it is said the early builders ob
tained their inspiration for the origi
nal type of mission architecture.
