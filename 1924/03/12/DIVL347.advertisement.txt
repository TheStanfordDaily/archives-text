I'm on Brunswick records, folks
Bat Listen! —You ain't heard nothin' yet
Al Jolson—the King of Musical Comedy—the
mighty monarch himself—on Brunswick
Records. The star of "Sinbad," "Robinson
Crusoe, Jr.," and now of "Bombo" can now be
heard at any time.
Isham Jones' Orchestra accompanies Jolson in
each Brunswick selection. Two Jolson songs
are on every Brunswick Record.
You'll think Al Jolson is standing before you
when you play:
THE ONE I LOVE BELONGS TO SOMEBODY ELSE { 2 567
STEPPIN' OUT } 75c
I'M COIN* SOUTH ) 2569
CALIFORNIA, HERE I COME - - - . } 75c
And remember there is always something neu>
on Brunswick Records.
