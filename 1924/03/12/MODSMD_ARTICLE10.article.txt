# MENTAL TELEPATHY TESTED
## Experiments at Stanford Fail to Prove it Exists, Says Professor Coover 
### Barbara Miller 
"If mental telepathy really exists,
the warm search for proof of its ex
istence which has been in full swing
during the last forty years should have j
yielded results."
This was the reply of Professor
Johu E. Coover, of the Psychological
department, when questioned con
cerning the actual existence of the
phenomenon.
Stanford Experiments
"Here at Stanford we have publish
ed the results of 10,000 experiments on
normal persons," continued Professor
Cover. These results furnish no sup
port for the hypothesis that telepathy
is a capacity possessed even in a
slight degree by normal individuals. I
The London Society for Physical
Research made intensive investiga
tions iti 1884. publishing a series of
reports on the results. The best in
stances contained data got from per
sons who latter confessed to the use
of codes.
A similar organization, founded at
Boston, also recorded investigations.
These differed from the English in <
being almost wholly negative. It was
believed that the favorable returns

were due to the fact that thought J
transference operates only under cer
tain conditions, perhaps largely
j through a specially favoring nervous
system. It was considered to be a
process which is probably taking
place with all normal individuals,!
though in a degree too slight for gener
| al notice.
"The subjects were not chosen at!
random. Those acting as percipients)
were selected on belief and experience !
j in some form of telepathy, such as the j
ability to tell when they were being i
stared at. Those who served as agents;
were chosen because of their experi-,
ence in being able to cause certain
! persons to turn around by "willing",
! them to do so,"
"Feeling Of Being Stared At"
More than 2500 experiments were!
performed on the "feeling of being
: stared at." The first set of 1000 experi
ments was carried out under the sup
position that tht' "staring" in the re
! spective experiments was determined
jby chance. The percipient was re
quired to record afterwards whether,
| or not in her judgment, she had been
stared at during the critical interval.
Answering objections against the
first, a second set of 1000 experi
ments was carried out. The percipient
was given to understand that at the
beginning of the critical interval she
was to rid her mind of all thoughts
and await impressions intruding them
selves on their own initiative.. The
merit of the introspection would con
sist entirely in the fidelity with which
she reported her experience. The re
sult was that not one of the 1000
noted the feeling of being stared at.
Final Tests Made
A third set of experiments was
made, in which a battery of twelve
powerful starers was selected. They
were instructed to stare earnestly and
powerfully, with a determined set of
mind that the .percipient should feel
it, for of all of the three they were to
stare at number two only.
In the non-staring experiments they
were to close their eyes and image in
their minds a big black rat. standing
on the lecture table and turned to face
Palo Alto. They werp to try to pro
ject this vivid picture into the mind
of percipient number two.
Black Cat Absent
The results indicated that the
starers attended to their busi-'
wss so well that the fourth percipient
was unabfe to determine which were
the staring experiments. Percipient
number two, the real object, had the
feeling of being stared at with em
barrassing vividness, but on both the

staring and the non-staring experi
ments. No percipient got the impres
sion of the black cat.
Therefore the results of all our ex
periments in thought transference
agree with the great majority of ex
perimental results in being complete
ly negative," concluded Professor Coo
ver.
"This does not mean, however, that
we have proven the impossibility of
telepathy. Science proves no nega
tives. However, it does mean that tele
pathy is highly improbable as a ca
pacity of normal persons."
"If mental telepathy really exists,

phenomenon.
Stanford Experiments
"Here at Stanford we have publish
ed the results of 10,000 experiments on
normal persons," continued Professor
Cover. These results furnish no sup
port for the hypothesis that telepathy
is a capacity possessed even in a
slight degree by normal individuals. I
The London Society for Physical
Research made intensive investiga
tions iti 1884. publishing a series of
reports on the results. The best in
stances contained data got from per
sons who latter confessed to the use
of codes.
A similar organization, founded at
Boston, also recorded investigations.
These differed from the English in <
being almost wholly negative. It was
believed that the favorable returns

were due to the fact that thought J
transference operates only under cer
tain conditions, perhaps largely
j through a specially favoring nervous
system. It was considered to be a
process which is probably taking
place with all normal individuals,!
though in a degree too slight for gener
| al notice.
"The subjects were not chosen at!
random. Those acting as percipients)
were selected on belief and experience !
j in some form of telepathy, such as the j
ability to tell when they were being i

were chosen because of their experi-,
ence in being able to cause certain

"Feeling Of Being Stared At"
More than 2500 experiments were!
performed on the "feeling of being
: stared at." The first set of 1000 experi
ments was carried out under the sup
position that tht' "staring" in the re
! spective experiments was determined
jby chance. The percipient was re
quired to record afterwards whether,
| or not in her judgment, she had been
stared at during the critical interval.
Answering objections against the
first, a second set of 1000 experi
ments was carried out. The percipient
was given to understand that at the
beginning of the critical interval she
was to rid her mind of all thoughts
and await impressions intruding them
selves on their own initiative.. The
merit of the introspection would con
sist entirely in the fidelity with which
she reported her experience. The re
sult was that not one of the 1000
noted the feeling of being stared at.
Final Tests Made
A third set of experiments was
made, in which a battery of twelve
powerful starers was selected. They
were instructed to stare earnestly and
powerfully, with a determined set of
mind that the .percipient should feel
it, for of all of the three they were to
stare at number two only.
In the non-staring experiments they
were to close their eyes and image in
their minds a big black rat. standing
on the lecture table and turned to face
Palo Alto. They werp to try to pro
ject this vivid picture into the mind
of percipient number two.
Black Cat Absent
The results indicated that the
starers attended to their busi-'
wss so well that the fourth percipient
was unabfe to determine which were
the staring experiments. Percipient
number two, the real object, had the
feeling of being stared at with em
barrassing vividness, but on both the

staring and the non-staring experi
ments. No percipient got the impres
