# MENTAL TELEPATHY TESTED
## Experiments at Stanford Fail to Prove it Exists, Says Professor Coover 
### Barbara Miller 
"If mental telepathy really exists,
the warm search for proof of its ex
istence which has been in full swing
during the last forty years should have j
yielded results."
This was the reply of Professor
Johu E. Coover, of the Psychological
department, when questioned con
cerning the actual existence of the
phenomenon.
Stanford Experiments
"Here at Stanford we have publish
ed the results of 10,000 experiments on
normal persons," continued Professor
Cover. These results furnish no sup
port for the hypothesis that telepathy
is a capacity possessed even in a
slight degree by normal individuals. I
The London Society for Physical
Research made intensive investiga
tions iti 1884. publishing a series of
reports on the results. The best in
stances contained data got from per
sons who latter confessed to the use
of codes.
A similar organization, founded at
Boston, also recorded investigations.
These differed from the English in <
being almost wholly negative. It was
believed that the favorable returns

were due to the fact that thought J
transference operates only under cer
tain conditions, perhaps largely
j through a specially favoring nervous
system. It was considered to be a
process which is probably taking
place with all normal individuals,!
though in a degree too slight for gener
| al notice.
"The subjects were not chosen at!
random. Those acting as percipients)
were selected on belief and experience !
j in some form of telepathy, such as the j
ability to tell when they were being i
stared at. Those who served as agents;
were chosen because of their experi-,
ence in being able to cause certain
! persons to turn around by "willing",
! them to do so,"
"Feeling Of Being Stared At"
More than 2500 experiments were!
performed on the "feeling of being
: stared at." The first set of 1000 experi
ments was carried out under the sup
position that tht' "staring" in the re
! spective experiments was determined
jby chance. The percipient was re
quired to record afterwards whether,
