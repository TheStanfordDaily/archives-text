# A. T. O.'S SUCCUMB TO KITE FLYING; LASUEN BECOMES PLAYGROUND
## 
### 
Eminent psychologists arc puzzling
' over the succumbing of the A. T. O.
: brothers to the childish pastime of kite
flying. Upper Lasuen resembles a pri
j mary school yard with its groups of
j brothers chasing madly around on the
j end of floating kite strings.
I Machines venturing up the Row have
| to thread their way through a maze of
| men and string. Those who are not
| participating in the sport stand on the
j front porch and yell hoarsely whenever
j a kite hits an air pocket.
The losing of a kite Sunday, when it
j stalled on a telephone wire, sent the ,
entire house into a panic. Mental ex
perts arc now laying this sudden lapse |
of the brothers into second childhood i
to the great strain of approaching ex- :
; animations.
