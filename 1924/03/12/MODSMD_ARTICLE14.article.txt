# OLYMPICS BRING BALANCED TEAM TO MEET CARDS
## Varsity Trackmen Have Even Chance to Win First Dual Competition 
### 
Stellar track men of former years
will try to show that age has not af
fected them, when the Olympic Club
; all-star aggregation tangles with Stan
ford, Saturday, in the first varsity
meet of the 1924 season.
I The clubmen have a well-rounded
| squad and intend to give the Cards
an upset. "Whether or not they can do
; it depends upon the number of stars
| that Coach Charlie Hunter can bring
down to the Farm with him, and on
; the condition these men are in. Un-
I doubtedly the meet will be close, but
Stanford has a good chance to win if
every man does what he is capable of
doing.
Chief Race Is Half-Mile
The chief race again seems to be the
' half-mile. Bill Richardson and Elmer
j Boyden should stage a thrilling show.
! In the Little Big meet last year these
two runners ran neck and neck to
within a few yards of the finish, when
Boyden managed to get a hair-breadth
load, which he held to the tape. Rich
ardson did 1:57 last week and if he
| can repeat again Saturday he has a
| good chance of showing his heels to
the Olympic runner.
Besides Boyden, the Post street club
boasts Scott, one time Olympic games
! half-miler; Seiman, formerly of Yale;
j and Stone, late of O. A. C. Mcintosh,
j Swayne, and Daly for Stanford will
have to step to get a third place from
! the Olympic trio.
Eddie Sudden, Stanford's
1 sprinter two years ago, will appear
