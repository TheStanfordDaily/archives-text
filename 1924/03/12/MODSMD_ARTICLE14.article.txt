# OLYMPICS BRING BALANCED TEAM TO MEET CARDS
## Varsity Trackmen Have Even Chance to Win First Dual Competition 
### 
Stellar track men of former years
will try to show that age has not af
fected them, when the Olympic Club
; all-star aggregation tangles with Stan
ford, Saturday, in the first varsity
meet of the 1924 season.
I The clubmen have a well-rounded
| squad and intend to give the Cards
an upset. "Whether or not they can do
; it depends upon the number of stars
| that Coach Charlie Hunter can bring
down to the Farm with him, and on
; the condition these men are in. Un-
I doubtedly the meet will be close, but
Stanford has a good chance to win if
every man does what he is capable of
doing.
Chief Race Is Half-Mile
The chief race again seems to be the
' half-mile. Bill Richardson and Elmer
j Boyden should stage a thrilling show.
! In the Little Big meet last year these
two runners ran neck and neck to
within a few yards of the finish, when
Boyden managed to get a hair-breadth
load, which he held to the tape. Rich
ardson did 1:57 last week and if he
| can repeat again Saturday he has a
| good chance of showing his heels to
the Olympic runner.
Besides Boyden, the Post street club
boasts Scott, one time Olympic games
! half-miler; Seiman, formerly of Yale;
j and Stone, late of O. A. C. Mcintosh,
j Swayne, and Daly for Stanford will
have to step to get a third place from
! the Olympic trio.
Eddie Sudden, Stanford's
1 sprinter two years ago, will appear
I for the San Francisco team. Sudden,
I when in form, is faster than lan Camp
j bell of Stanford. Newhoff and Kreugen
are the other club sprinters. Marshall
Hale, who was unable to run in the
interclass meet, will probably take
part Saturday. Louis Caspar is Tem
-1 leton's other sprinter, but he can
hardly be counted upon for a place.
"Swede" Leistner should take first
place in both hurdle events. Krogness,
of the Olympic Club, is in good shape
for this early in the season, and he
may be able to give the Stanford ace
a close race. Boles is practically cer
tain of a place.
Smith and Kerr in Mile
A1 Smith and Bill Kerr will match
speed and strength in the mile with
Waltz, Downey, and Fuller of the
club team. This race looks like it.
should be all Stanford.
A1 Charles and Charlie Dorr are
primed for a gruelling battle in *he
two-mile. The man who wins will prob
ably have to do better than 9:50. Pat
Murphy will also run in this race for
Stanford.
Storie Is Fast in 440
Cochran, who won the N. C. A. A.
quarter-mile twice for the University
of Minnesota, is coming down, confi
dent of beating Storie. He is likely to
get the tables turned on him, how
ever, as Storie is the best 440 runner
seen on the squad for a long time. Ted
Miller, who did 0:50 flat last week,
may also surprise the national cham
pion.
Stanford seems to be a blank in the
javelin throw. Sorrenti, Hanner, and
Peterson of the Olympic Club all toss
the spear around the 190 i -foot mark.
Harlow i,s about the only entrant for
Stanford, but he. cannot cope with the
three club stars.
Hartranft Should Win
Hartranft has an edge in the weight
events. His showing in the interclass
meet was better than he had done
hitherto this year, which seems to
point to a steady improvement. Mer
chant and McGurn will handle the
weight for the Winged "O." Richards,
in the shot, and Campbell, in the dis
cus, are Templeton's other weight
men.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright both '
jumped more than 22 feet Saturday. |
This gives them a good chance to land 1
ahead of Treyer, Kelly, and Merchant. |
Norris and Green of the Olympics will j
vie with Scofield, Whistler, and Den-1
nis in the pole vault. Norris is favored !
to win, as he is capable of 12 feet 0 I
inches.
Fred Anderson cleared the bar at
6 feet 3-4 inches in the interclass
meet and Lou Kemnitzer did 5 feet 11
inches. Treyer and Kelly will do the
jumping for the Olympic Club.

Storie Is Fast in 440
Cochran, who won the N. C. A. A.
quarter-mile twice for the University
of Minnesota, is coming down, confi
dent of beating Storie. He is likely to
get the tables turned on him, how
ever, as Storie is the best 440 runner
seen on the squad for a long time. Ted
Miller, who did 0:50 flat last week,
may also surprise the national cham
pion.
Stanford seems to be a blank in the
javelin throw. Sorrenti, Hanner, and
Peterson of the Olympic Club all toss
the spear around the 190 i -foot mark.
Harlow i,s about the only entrant for
Stanford, but he. cannot cope with the
three club stars.
Hartranft Should Win
Hartranft has an edge in the weight
events. His showing in the interclass
meet was better than he had done
hitherto this year, which seems to
point to a steady improvement. Mer
chant and McGurn will handle the
weight for the Winged "O." Richards,
in the shot, and Campbell, in the dis
cus, are Templeton's other weight
men.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright both '
jumped more than 22 feet Saturday. |
This gives them a good chance to land 1
ahead of Treyer, Kelly, and Merchant. |
Norris and Green of the Olympics will j
vie with Scofield, Whistler, and Den-1
nis in the pole vault. Norris is favored !
to win, as he is capable of 12 feet 0 I
inches.
Fred Anderson cleared the bar at
6 feet 3-4 inches in the interclass

Stellar track men of former years
will try to show that age has not af
fected them, when the Olympic Club
; all-star aggregation tangles with Stan
ford, Saturday, in the first varsity
meet of the 1924 season.
I The clubmen have a well-rounded
| squad and intend to give the Cards
an upset. "Whether or not they can do
; it depends upon the number of stars
| that Coach Charlie Hunter can bring
down to the Farm with him, and on
; the condition these men are in. Un-
I doubtedly the meet will be close, but
Stanford has a good chance to win if
every man does what he is capable of
doing.
Chief Race Is Half-Mile
The chief race again seems to be the
' half-mile. Bill Richardson and Elmer
j Boyden should stage a thrilling show.
! In the Little Big meet last year these
two runners ran neck and neck to
within a few yards of the finish, when
Boyden managed to get a hair-breadth
load, which he held to the tape. Rich
ardson did 1:57 last week and if he
| can repeat again Saturday he has a
| good chance of showing his heels to
the Olympic runner.
Besides Boyden, the Post street club
boasts Scott, one time Olympic games
! half-miler; Seiman, formerly of Yale;
j and Stone, late of O. A. C. Mcintosh,
j Swayne, and Daly for Stanford will
have to step to get a third place from
! the Olympic trio.
Eddie Sudden, Stanford's
1 sprinter two years ago, will appear
I for the San Francisco team. Sudden,
I when in form, is faster than lan Camp
j bell of Stanford. Newhoff and Kreugen
are the other club sprinters. Marshall
Hale, who was unable to run in the
interclass meet, will probably take
part Saturday. Louis Caspar is Tem
-1 leton's other sprinter, but he can
hardly be counted upon for a place.
"Swede" Leistner should take first
place in both hurdle events. Krogness,
of the Olympic Club, is in good shape
for this early in the season, and he
may be able to give the Stanford ace
a close race. Boles is practically cer
tain of a place.
Smith and Kerr in Mile
A1 Smith and Bill Kerr will match
speed and strength in the mile with
Waltz, Downey, and Fuller of the
club team. This race looks like it.
should be all Stanford.
A1 Charles and Charlie Dorr are
primed for a gruelling battle in *he
two-mile. The man who wins will prob
ably have to do better than 9:50. Pat
Murphy will also run in this race for
Stanford.
Storie Is Fast in 440
Cochran, who won the N. C. A. A.
quarter-mile twice for the University
of Minnesota, is coming down, confi
dent of beating Storie. He is likely to
get the tables turned on him, how
ever, as Storie is the best 440 runner
seen on the squad for a long time. Ted
Miller, who did 0:50 flat last week,
may also surprise the national cham
pion.
Stanford seems to be a blank in the
javelin throw. Sorrenti, Hanner, and
Peterson of the Olympic Club all toss
the spear around the 190 i -foot mark.
Harlow i,s about the only entrant for
Stanford, but he. cannot cope with the
three club stars.
Hartranft Should Win
Hartranft has an edge in the weight
events. His showing in the interclass
meet was better than he had done
hitherto this year, which seems to
point to a steady improvement. Mer
chant and McGurn will handle the
weight for the Winged "O." Richards,
in the shot, and Campbell, in the dis
cus, are Templeton's other weight
men.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright both '
jumped more than 22 feet Saturday. |
This gives them a good chance to land 1
ahead of Treyer, Kelly, and Merchant. |
Norris and Green of the Olympics will j
vie with Scofield, Whistler, and Den-1
nis in the pole vault. Norris is favored !
to win, as he is capable of 12 feet 0 I
inches.
Fred Anderson cleared the bar at
6 feet 3-4 inches in the interclass
meet and Lou Kemnitzer did 5 feet 11
inches. Treyer and Kelly will do the
jumping for the Olympic Club.
