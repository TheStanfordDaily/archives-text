After a brief period of rushing next quarter, the class of 1927 will be
faced with the annual Greek letter entanglement. It is probable that
the bulk of the men have already formed a more or less definite idea of
the course most expedient to them, but the rest and isolation of the
vacation period will be valuable in allowing them to get a perspective
on the situation.
Primarily, the line of cleavage between Greek and non-Greek is far
from all-important. Hysterical and misleading literature like "The
Barb" to the contrary, success in practically every line except the ac
cumulation of crested jewelry is open to either group, and it boils down
to a question of the most pleasant surroundings during college life.
Fraternities rarely make a winner out of a loser; just as rarely do they
make a good man go wrong. 1 Jail or Row in themselves will never make
or break—in either case it is up to the man himself to choose between
success or failure.
1 lie chief possibility for error lies in the choice of the fraternity, if
one is to be chosen. A congenial group should be the sought-for thing,
and where that congenial atmosphere is located matters not at all. Find
it, and stick to it. A veneer of back-slapping and false cordiality spread
over a rushing season will not last through four years of intimate asso
ciation, and the freshman who allows himself to be deluded by such a
display of stage talent deserves to be stung. And will be!
Selection of a fraternity is-a matter of importance, and should receive
plenty of detailed consideration. Think it over—be sure you're right—
and go ahead.
