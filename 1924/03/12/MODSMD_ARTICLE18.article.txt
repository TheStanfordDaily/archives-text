# Final Examinations
## 
### 
With final examinations coming next week, every student in the
University should be rounding up stray ideas and getting ready to
"hit em."
For those who have done their work regularly during the quarter,
finals hold no horrors. A little reviewing, and they are ready to "go
to bat." For those who have let things slide on the supposition that they
would skin through in some way or other, examinations are a constant
source of worry.
While speaking of final examinations, a word about the honor system
is always in order. The honor system has been a big success at Stanford
for the simple reason that one does not have to depart from the recog
nized ideals on the Farm to live up to it.
Consequently, violations have been few and far between. The regula
tions are simple. No one is to receive outside help during examination
periods. The few students who have stepped over the line in the past
have probably not stopped to think just what they were doing. In violat
ing the honor system, a student is, of course, being unfair to his fellows.
However, the one who suffers most is the violator himself. He is
forming habits which will cause him no end of trouble in the; outside
world.
When a student disregards the honor system, he is either dismissed
from the University, or hours are added to his graduation requirement.
The honor system, under another name, holds in the business and
professional world in practically the same way. The main difference lies
in the punishment. Penitentiaries and asylums take care of violators
who disregard laws.
The success of the honor system lies entirely with the students. If
they uphold and observe it, as they have in the past, there will be no
question as to its continuance. If the honor system is violated con
sistently, it will probably be necessary, eventually, to go back to the
"police" system, where college students are treated as grammar school
children.
