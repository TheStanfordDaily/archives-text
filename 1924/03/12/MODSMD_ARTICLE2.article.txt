# J. M. BARRIE SHOWS VALUE AND LOVE OF HOME IN HIS WORKS
## 
### 
Glorification of the home was what
Mrs. Katherine Oliver-McCoy stressed
as one of J. M. Barrie's important
achievements, when she presented "A
Visit With Barrie and His Dream Chil
dren" last evening before a large audi
ence in the Assembly hall.
With intimate glimpses of the great
author and his mother, "Margaret
Ogilvy." giving selections from the
book by the latter name, Mrs. McCoy
summarized Barrie's different stages
of development in writing.
Mother and Son
His mother's struggle to overcome
the fascination in which Stevenson's
works held her, and lver shame over
the fact that she preferred reading his
tales of those of her own son, were
well dramatized by Mrs. McCoy in
her dialogues between mother and
?on. In these selections she made evi
dent the delightful companionship ex
isting between the two, and the moth
er's great influence over Barrie, who
so often made her the heroine in his
creations.
Assuming the characters of Tommy
and Shovels from "Sentimental
Tommy" she pictured the boasting
contest, illustrating Barrie's handling
of genius which was so remarkable in
the first of his great hovels.
