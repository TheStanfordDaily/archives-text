# BOXING WITH L. A. CLUB CALLED OFF
## 
### 
Boxing bouts with the Los Angeles
Athletic Club, scheduled for March 27,
have been called off by Coach Harry
Maloney.
In order to keep in proper condition
for the bouts, the men would have to
hold daily workouts in the gym which
would interfere with final examina
tions; consequently the bouts have
been cancelled and the team has been
disbanded until next quarter.
The meet with the University of
California, Southern Branch, will be
held as scheduled, Saturday, April 12,
at Los Angeles.
