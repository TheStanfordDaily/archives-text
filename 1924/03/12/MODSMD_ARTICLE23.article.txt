# March Spectator Goes On News Stands Friday
## 
### 
Resplendent in a new three-color
cover, as well as increased size, the
March Spectator goes on sale Friday.
The big feature of the issue will be
a dope story by Norris James on track.
The number presents a wide variety
of reading matter â€”short stories, es
says, and sketches. "Ma's Valuable
Memory," by Mary Baker, is a short
story written especially for the Spec
tator, as is Viriginia Clippinger's "Man
Proposes." Carl Wilhelmson offers an
essay on "Religion" and Harford Hays
a .short sketch entitled "The Adven
tures of the Almonds."
