# LEVEL OF SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER IS DROPPING FAST
## AVERAGE FALL FIVE FEET Professor Sloan Concluding Important Investigation Of Water Problem 
### 
During his two-year investigation
of the water supply of the Santa Clara
valley, W. H. Sloan, associate pro
fessor of Chemistry, has found that
the underground reservoirs are being
pumped out faster than they are being
replenished by rainfall, and the whole
question resolves itself into just how
long the present supply will last.
Drop Varies
"The level of the gravel beds for
some years back has had an average
drop of five feet per year," says Pro
fessor Sloan. "This drop varies in
different sections in the valley. In the
Cupertino and Campbell district, the
level dropped fifty-five feet in the
period of 191G to 1920.
"The University draws all of its
drinking water from wells, one of
which is situated near the cac)lus
gardens and another on the state high
way just above Mayfield, with the
gymnasium well as an emergency
supply. The gymnasium well was the
oniy source of supply during part of
last fall, according to one of the Uni
versity engineers.
Dependence on Wells
"Palo Alto, Mayfield, Los Altos,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa
Clara all get their water from wells.
San Jose gets about half of its supply
from wells. Of the total water used in
the valley, about 10 per cent is used
by the towns, and about 90 per cent
for agriculture.
"What has happened is simply this:
water from the underground reservoirs
has been pumped out faster than it
has been going in. The increase in
pumping plants from 1900 to 1920
has been from 230 to 1700. The percent
of this increase from the years 1910
to 1920 was 74.
From 1910 to 1920 the orchard acre
age increased from 55,000 to 71,000.
The irrigated area increased from
42,500 acres to 86,000 acres, and there
has undoubtedly been a tremendous
increase since then.
Former Investigation
"In 1919 a fund of $25,000 was raised
by private subscription and by the
Hoard of Supervisors of this county to
investigate the water situation. Tib
bets and Keiffer, San Francisco en
gineers, spent a year measuring over
600 wells, and gathering a great deal
of data. They submitted a plan to con
serve the water which runs off to the
bay by additional reservoirs, tempor
ary dams, the idea being to keep the
water level up rather than to run it
off through irrigation ditches.
Water District Defeated
"An election was held in 1920 to
organize a water district. Understand,
this was merely to provide for organi
zation. No bonds were to be voted.
Yet the issue was defeated, largely by
the agricultural vote. There is a pos
sibility that in the case of an emer
gency, the townspeople and the agri
culturalists will be seriously divided
on this question.
"The average run-off to the bay is
260,000 acre-feet. The total available
water supply that can be conserved by
the building of additional reservoirs,
etc., is 215,000 acre-feet. The maximum
need in 1927, calculated on the basis
of past increase, will be 213,000 acre
feet. The average natural absorption
is about 89,000 acre-feet. The conclu
sion is that from Palo Alto north, the
water supply will have to be obtained
from outside sources.
Hetch-Hetchy Wanted
"Stanford plans to use the Hetch-
Hetchy. University engineers and Palo
Alto officials have conferred with the
Spring Valley water company to ar
range for water in case of emergency.
Although no emergency is expected, in
the event that there is a shortage, it
is doubtful whether the Sprftig Valley
company will have much surplus to
pipe to this section.
Chloride Content Increases
"There has been a remarkable
change in the content of the well
water both on the campus and ni Palo
Alto. From January, 1922, to Decem
ber, 1923, the chloride content in the
cactus garden well has increased from
73 (parts per million) to 125.
"Just what this means nobody
knows. It may indicate that bay water
is seeping in. If the fresh water level
should sink so low as to allow the
salt water to break through the clay
strata which keeps it out at present,
the valley wells would pump nothing
but salt water, and naturally, nothing
could grow. This is, of course, merely
conjecture."
Sloan expects to have more import
ant data next month when he con
cludes his investigation.

the building of additional reservoirs,
etc., is 215,000 acre-feet. The maximum
need in 1927, calculated on the basis
of past increase, will be 213,000 acre
feet. The average natural absorption
is about 89,000 acre-feet. The conclu
sion is that from Palo Alto north, the
water supply will have to be obtained
from outside sources.
Hetch-Hetchy Wanted
"Stanford plans to use the Hetch-
Hetchy. University engineers and Palo
Alto officials have conferred with the
Spring Valley water company to ar
range for water in case of emergency.
Although no emergency is expected, in
the event that there is a shortage, it
is doubtful whether the Sprftig Valley
company will have much surplus to
pipe to this section.
Chloride Content Increases
"There has been a remarkable
change in the content of the well
water both on the campus and ni Palo
Alto. From January, 1922, to Decem
ber, 1923, the chloride content in the
cactus garden well has increased from
73 (parts per million) to 125.
"Just what this means nobody
knows. It may indicate that bay water
is seeping in. If the fresh water level
should sink so low as to allow the
salt water to break through the clay
strata which keeps it out at present,
the valley wells would pump nothing
but salt water, and naturally, nothing
could grow. This is, of course, merely
conjecture."
Sloan expects to have more import
ant data next month when he con
cludes his investigation.
During his two-year investigation
of the water supply of the Santa Clara
valley, W. H. Sloan, associate pro
fessor of Chemistry, has found that
the underground reservoirs are being
pumped out faster than they are being
replenished by rainfall, and the whole
question resolves itself into just how
long the present supply will last.
Drop Varies
"The level of the gravel beds for
some years back has had an average
drop of five feet per year," says Pro
fessor Sloan. "This drop varies in
different sections in the valley. In the
Cupertino and Campbell district, the
level dropped fifty-five feet in the
period of 191G to 1920.
"The University draws all of its
drinking water from wells, one of
which is situated near the cac)lus
gardens and another on the state high
way just above Mayfield, with the
gymnasium well as an emergency
supply. The gymnasium well was the
oniy source of supply during part of
last fall, according to one of the Uni
versity engineers.
Dependence on Wells
"Palo Alto, Mayfield, Los Altos,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa
Clara all get their water from wells.
San Jose gets about half of its supply
from wells. Of the total water used in
the valley, about 10 per cent is used
by the towns, and about 90 per cent
for agriculture.
"What has happened is simply this:
water from the underground reservoirs
has been pumped out faster than it
has been going in. The increase in
pumping plants from 1900 to 1920
has been from 230 to 1700. The percent
of this increase from the years 1910
to 1920 was 74.
From 1910 to 1920 the orchard acre
age increased from 55,000 to 71,000.
The irrigated area increased from
42,500 acres to 86,000 acres, and there
has undoubtedly been a tremendous
increase since then.
Former Investigation
"In 1919 a fund of $25,000 was raised
by private subscription and by the
Hoard of Supervisors of this county to
investigate the water situation. Tib
bets and Keiffer, San Francisco en
gineers, spent a year measuring over
600 wells, and gathering a great deal
of data. They submitted a plan to con
serve the water which runs off to the
bay by additional reservoirs, tempor
ary dams, the idea being to keep the
water level up rather than to run it
off through irrigation ditches.
Water District Defeated
"An election was held in 1920 to
organize a water district. Understand,
this was merely to provide for organi
zation. No bonds were to be voted.
Yet the issue was defeated, largely by
the agricultural vote. There is a pos
sibility that in the case of an emer
gency, the townspeople and the agri
culturalists will be seriously divided
on this question.

has been from 230 to 1700. The percent
of this increase from the years 1910
to 1920 was 74.
From 1910 to 1920 the orchard acre
age increased from 55,000 to 71,000.
The irrigated area increased from
42,500 acres to 86,000 acres, and there
has undoubtedly been a tremendous
increase since then.
Former Investigation
"In 1919 a fund of $25,000 was raised
by private subscription and by the
Hoard of Supervisors of this county to
investigate the water situation. Tib
bets and Keiffer, San Francisco en
gineers, spent a year measuring over
600 wells, and gathering a great deal
of data. They submitted a plan to con
serve the water which runs off to the
bay by additional reservoirs, tempor
ary dams, the idea being to keep the
water level up rather than to run it
off through irrigation ditches.
Water District Defeated
"An election was held in 1920 to
organize a water district. Understand,
this was merely to provide for organi
zation. No bonds were to be voted.
Yet the issue was defeated, largely by
the agricultural vote. There is a pos
sibility that in the case of an emer
gency, the townspeople and the agri
culturalists will be seriously divided
on this question.
"The average run-off to the bay is
260,000 acre-feet. The total available
water supply that can be conserved by
the building of additional reservoirs,
etc., is 215,000 acre-feet. The maximum
need in 1927, calculated on the basis
of past increase, will be 213,000 acre
feet. The average natural absorption
is about 89,000 acre-feet. The conclu
sion is that from Palo Alto north, the
water supply will have to be obtained
from outside sources.
Hetch-Hetchy Wanted
"Stanford plans to use the Hetch-
Hetchy. University engineers and Palo
Alto officials have conferred with the
Spring Valley water company to ar
range for water in case of emergency.
Although no emergency is expected, in
the event that there is a shortage, it
is doubtful whether the Sprftig Valley
company will have much surplus to
pipe to this section.
Chloride Content Increases
"There has been a remarkable
change in the content of the well
water both on the campus and ni Palo
Alto. From January, 1922, to Decem
ber, 1923, the chloride content in the
cactus garden well has increased from
73 (parts per million) to 125.
"Just what this means nobody
knows. It may indicate that bay water
is seeping in. If the fresh water level
should sink so low as to allow the
salt water to break through the clay
strata which keeps it out at present,
the valley wells would pump nothing
but salt water, and naturally, nothing
could grow. This is, of course, merely
conjecture."
Sloan expects to have more import
ant data next month when he con
cludes his investigation.
During his two-year investigation
of the water supply of the Santa Clara
valley, W. H. Sloan, associate pro
fessor of Chemistry, has found that
the underground reservoirs are being
pumped out faster than they are being
replenished by rainfall, and the whole
question resolves itself into just how
long the present supply will last.
Drop Varies
"The level of the gravel beds for
some years back has had an average
drop of five feet per year," says Pro
fessor Sloan. "This drop varies in
different sections in the valley. In the
Cupertino and Campbell district, the
level dropped fifty-five feet in the
period of 191G to 1920.
"The University draws all of its
drinking water from wells, one of
which is situated near the cac)lus
gardens and another on the state high
way just above Mayfield, with the
gymnasium well as an emergency
supply. The gymnasium well was the
oniy source of supply during part of
last fall, according to one of the Uni
versity engineers.
Dependence on Wells
"Palo Alto, Mayfield, Los Altos,
Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa
Clara all get their water from wells.
San Jose gets about half of its supply
from wells. Of the total water used in
the valley, about 10 per cent is used
by the towns, and about 90 per cent
for agriculture.
"What has happened is simply this:
water from the underground reservoirs
has been pumped out faster than it
has been going in. The increase in
pumping plants from 1900 to 1920
has been from 230 to 1700. The percent
of this increase from the years 1910
to 1920 was 74.
