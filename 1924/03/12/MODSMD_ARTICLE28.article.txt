# UNIVERSITY ISSUES VALUABLE BOOK ON CHOICE OF VOCATION
## 
### 
Attention is called by the Registrar's
office to the fact that a very valuable
and extensively-used book has been
published by the University as one of
the series of bulletins that it issues
yearly. This book is entitled "Voca
tional Information" and was prepared
by the Committee on Vocational Guid
ance.
The real aim of this book is to en
able the student wlio enters Stanford
to make an intelligent choice of a vo
cation, and to assist him in planning
his work and outlining his course to
the best advantage. It also gives many
valuable suggestions to the graduate

, as how to establish himself and how 1
to meet and solve problems which will
; confront him when he starts to take
up his vocation.
Practically every field of occupa
tion has been thoroughly covered by
specially written articles by persons
who are acknowledged leaders in their
! work. In almost every instance, it was
possible to secure Stanford graduates
! who were qualified to write these arti
cles.
The book is considered the best of
its kind that has ever been published.
The first edition, which was printed
some time ago, met with such ap
proval that it was necessary for the
University to issue this last edition
which was published in October, 1923.
It is used in regular classwork by
many of the leading universities. This
book is also read in vocational in- â– 

! stitutions and by vocational advisers.
New York and Massachusetts, as well
as several other states, have incor
porated it into their public school sys
tem, it being considered very valuable
to the student who contemplates con
tinuing his education at some college
after graduating from high school.
In preparing this book, the commit
tee worked over two years in gather
ing data and information. Much of this
valuable information was obtaiued
from Stanford alumni.
The book is on sale at the Adminis
tration building for 25c a copy.
