# NEW STAFF MEMBERS TO ENTERTAIN WITH SONG, FOOD, DANCE
## 
### 
In order that the doubtful honor of
"making" the Daily Palo Alto staff be
not depreciated, the new members will
attempt to impress their elders this
evening with a display of gratitude
by furnishing, as a climax to the quar
ter's labors, a much needed repast and
necessary accoutrements, including a
great diversity of entertainment.
The Tri-Delt house has finally been
selected as the scene for the merri
ment. The curtain will be raised at <5
p.m. with the opening strains of a
two-piece orchestra.
Rumor has it (copywrited journal
sese) that the new members will sing.
In so far as their tryout tests took
no cognizance of presence or absence
of this innate ability, the results are
doubtful.
