f Here are two pairs of speedy legs and feet that go like lightning—perhaps
not small enough to wear Cinderella's diamond slippers, but nevertheless
supreme on the cinderpath and on the diamond. They belong to Charley
Paddock, the "Archvillain of Amateur Athletics" (subtitle by the A. A. U.),
and Maurice Archdeacon of the White Sox ball club. Besides being the* same
height and weight both these birds hold world's records. Paddock's are too
numerous to mention, Archdeacon's more timely at the present.
Archie made the greatest number of hits and runs with the Rochester club
of the International league in 1923, batting .357. Then he went to the Sox and
established a world's record by getting on base the first time up In his first
eight games, and also making 23 runs in the 20' games he played. In Septem
ber, 1921, Archie knocked 2-5 of a second off the old record of 13 4-5 for
circling the bases. Tie that one, Charlie!
Paddock has been lecturing all winter, so his wind should be in good
condition. If he isn't permitted to represent Uncle Sam in Paris, perhaps the
Sox manager would lend Archdeacon for a month or so? Not a CHANCE!
