# EXHIBIT OF GERMAN PAPER MONEY BEING SHOWN IN LIBRARY
## 
### 
German paper money, collected by
Ziemer Hawkins of Sequoia Club, who
spent last year in Europe, is now on
exhibit in the Library.
The display is arranged by dates,
showing German paper money from
1920 to 1923. The "good old notes" of
1920 are of heavy paper and are print
ed on both sides. They are worth
about one-twentieth of their face value.
The next issue, that of 1922, is on
cheaper paper and of higher denomi
nation. The succeeding issues of 1923
go into the millions, and in the latter
part of that year into the billions.
The one hundred billion note of
October, 1923, is only a matter of
small change. The two hundred billion
note, if worth its face value, "would
pay reparations and allied debts, and
leave enough to buy several railroads."
One of the bills of this issue is en
graved by Abrecht Durer, and is
thought by some to have been changed
to represent a French vampire suck
ing the blood of a German peasant.
