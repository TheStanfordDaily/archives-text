# NEW COURSE OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION
## 
### 
The Department of Physical Educa
tion, with the assistance of the De
partment of Bacteriology, is offering
lor the spring quarter a three-unit
course in Preventive Medicine and
General Hygiene (Physical Education
2, MWF 8, Schultz, Barrow). This will
be a lecture course covering the funda
mental principles of bacteriology and
preventive medicine.
Emphasis will be laid upon conta
gious disease, the hygiene of food,
milk and water supplies, and general
sanitation. Lectures and reading will
be supplemented by laboratory demon
strations of the fundamental princi
ples of bacteriology and also demon
strations of laboratory methods in the
examination of food supplies and
water. No previous knowledge of the
subject is required and the course will
be open to both men and women stu
dents. It may be applied toward the
fulfillment of the lower division bio
logical science requirement.
Courses have for some time been
offered for both nven and women in
physiology and personal hygiene and
it has been felt that there is a real
need for such a course as outlined
above which will continue the subject
into the broader field of community
health. It is hoped that a small num
ber of lectures may be given by mem
bers of the faculty on correlated sub
jects.
