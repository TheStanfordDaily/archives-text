# BUSH LABOR AIMS FOR INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
## Attitude of English Toward Workingmen Shown by Assembly Speaker 
### 
"With its aim the establishment of
a society which really can be called
an industrial democracy, the labor
movement is rising in every nation
of the world," said Paul Blanshard,
field secretary of the League of In
dustrial Democracy, before the Uni
versity Assembly this morning.
British Labor Party Strong
Men of great intellect are behind
the British movement, according to
the speaker. Shaw writes in its favor,
and has been for many years one of
the most effective and loyal soap-box
orators. Even Thomas Hardy and Ar
nold Benett vote the labor ticket.
Leaders in the church are also in sym
pathy with the idea of letting the
other class have a chance at govern
ment.
Social Legislation Favored
Next to the strength of organized
labor in industries, social legislation
plays an important part in England.
Socialization of industry is the aim of
the Labor party. This is to be accom
plished by taxation by a majority vote.
Land, that last great stronghold of
the ruling clas, is to be dealt with on
the theory that a man has only the
right to what he can use himself. The
huge estates will gradually be dis
posed of by taxing.
