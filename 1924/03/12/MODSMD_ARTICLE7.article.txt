# REPRESENTATIVES OF FIVE SCHOOLS WILL MEET CARD RABES
## 
### 
Five schools will attempt to take the
measure of the Cardinal freshman
track squad Saturday afternoon, at
1 o'clock, on the varsity field.
The aspiring quintet is composed
of Modesto high and junior college,
Sacramento high and junior college,
and Cliico high school.
From Sacramento will come Loclie
liart, present holder of the state titles
in the mile and 880 events, having an
nexed both in the state meet last year.
Another state champion will be a
member of the Modesto high squad,
White, who tossed the shot for a state
record last year also.
Shipkey, having taken a first in the
interclass meet last Saturday by heav
ing his javelin IGG feet, 11 inches,
looks good to repeat this week for the
freshmen.
Spencer, interscholastic champion
in the low sticks, has been hovering
close to 0:25 and 0>:26 lately and
should have little trouble in account
ing for a first. He has also been show
ing up fairly well in the highs but
West will probably beat him out, liav
| ing taken a good third in the meet
Saturday.
West will also be entered in the
high and broad jumps. Both events are
good meat for him since he usually
does as well in one as the other.
Cummings, winner of the intramural
' cross-country and fourth in the inter
class tourney, is about the only good
yearling bet in the mile.

There is a museum devoted solely
to a collection of dress fastening de
â€¢ vices of all kinds and ages in Prague.
