# PATTERSON RESIGNS CAPTAINCY Of VARSITY NINE
## Cardinals Meet Saint Mary's, Pirates Here; U. S. C., Bakersfield on Tour 
### 
E. A. ("Pat") Patterson, resigned j
the captaincy of the 1924 baseball var- j
sity today, following the announce-1
m-ent that he was ineligible to compete
for Stanford this year. The baseball
squad was to choose Patterson's suc
cessor this afternoon.
Patterson's ineligibility comes as
the result of his competing for an out- i
side team during the academic year I
at the close of the last baseball sea-j
son. His action was entirely voluntary, i
as the charge against him had neither j
been pressed nor proved.
The Stanford baseball varsity has a j
busy two weeks ahead of it, having I
two games scheduled at home and j
three to be played 011 foreign grounds. \
This Saturday Saint Mary's visits!
the campus for the first game of its
annual series with the Cards. Saint
Mary's has played California once this
year and won the game by a single i
run.The Saints have a strong pitching
staff which will give trouble, to any
of its opponents this year.
On the Saturday following the Pitts-!
burgh National League club will per-,
form in the varsity field. McKecknie,'
the Pirates manager, will renew an
old friendship with Harry Wolter, the j
varsity coach.
Some of the better-known stars who
will appear with the big league team,!
are Schmidt who is rated as one of |
the best catchers in the big leagues, j
and Traynor, who plays a fast game j
at third. In Max Carey, the Pirates j
have the fastest baserunner in the
big circuits. Carey's running should
be a revelation to Coast fans.
No little interest will be aroused
over the performance of Carson Bigbee
in the outfield for the visitors. Bigbee
is a former University of Oregon play
â€¢er and has been making good with a
bang since his arrival in fast company.
During the vacation wepk Stanford
will journey South, meeting the Baker
field Standard Oil team at Bakerfield
on Wednesday the twenty-sixth.
From there the Cards move to Los
Angeles for two games with the Uni
versity of Southern California. Little
is known of the strength of U. S. C.
at the present time, but it is probable
that Stanford will meet a strong team
in the two contests which will be
played on Friday, March 28, and
Saturday, March 29.
The proposed freshman trip is hang
ing fire and it is not known at this
time whether the Babe performers
will be able to take the journey ori
ginally planed for them.
If the trip, as scheduled is carried
out, the Frosh will meet Fresno
State Teachers College on March 24,
followed by a game with Dinuba, Visa
lia, and Hanford High Schools.
