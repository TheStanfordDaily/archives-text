A Bonus for Quality
not quantity
There is so much more | )
fun in doing a thing as y
well as it can be done
than as fast as possible. /
Speed and quality do not mix very well. For that
reason the Packard factory pursues a policy of employ
ing salaried shoemakers who are paid a bonus for
QUALITY —not quantity.
Made painstakingly by salaried craftsmen instead of
hurrying piece workers, PACKARD SHOES are an ideal
creation of head, heart, and mind. There is but one
ideal that governs the Packard policy—
A firm determination to produce nothing short of the
very best
