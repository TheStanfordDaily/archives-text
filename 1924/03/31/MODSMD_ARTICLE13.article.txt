After winning a see-saw contest
from the Trojans on the Stanford dia
mond, the Cardinal ball team jour
neyed south and dropped two games,
and the series to U. S. C.
All three games developed into
slugging matches with the southern
hitters smashing the ball out a little
more than the Stanford pastimers.
Fay Thomas, a big blonde with a
fast ball, lots of confidence, and poor
control, had one bad inning in his first
attempt to pitch the Trojans to vic
tory, and Stanford came out on top,
6-5.
