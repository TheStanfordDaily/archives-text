# An Inventory

Those who are fortunate enough to be able to clo so have registered,
paid their fees, and said their "glad-to-sec-yon-hack'sand another
quarter of work will begin tomorrow.
The beginning of a new quarter, particularly the Spring Quarter, is
an excellent time to take an inventory. Possibly the senior who is to
graduate soon makes the most startling discoveries when he "takes stock."
Situated as he is, at the end of the road of education which stretches
hack some fifteen or sixteen years, he can tell fairly well just what he
has accomplished. Ahead of him, the road forks. The rocky one, to the
right, which does not look easy to traverse, leads to success. The smooth
one. to the left, winds aimlessly away, finally disappearing down over the
edge of a steep hill. Seemingly, that road is harmless enough. Besides,
there are more people traveling it. It is the road to failure.
The man at the fork in the roads looks back again. I'pon what he
sees will depend which road he will take ahead. If his education has
trained him mentally, morally, and physically, as it should, he will be
well fitted to take the more difficult route and reach his destination. If
he has not made the most of his time, particularly in college, he will
probably turn to the left, and drift along with the others who, slowly,
but none the less surely, disappear over the hill.
Once he starts on the wrong road, Mr. Graduate will find it mighty
hard to get back on the right one. There are no short cuts. Ile must
retrace his steps and start over from the place where the roads fork.
The fellow who is forced to turn to the left might not have found
himself there, had he "taken stock" at the end of each quarter in college,
or even at the end of each year. The man who knew at all times just
what he was getting out of his education never hesitated when he came
to the end of the road of education. He turned to the right immediately
because he knew where he was going and was equipped to overcome any
obstacles he encountered.
Farther back along the road of education are thousands of college
students, all looking in the same direction—forward. All about them are
opportunities which make or break them. Some of them, pausing to look
around, and losing sight of their goal, drop by the wayside. They must
finally reach the fork in the roads by a long and tedious detour. Of those
who go on, some grasp the opportunities, and some do not. Those who
do not may keep up with the others, and, in some cases, even forge ahead
and reach the end of the road first.
However, inevitably they will turn to the left, while their wiser
fellows wish them well and choose the rocky road which brings them,
in the end, to SUCCESS.
All communications and announcements must be in the Daily Palo Alto
office by 10 a.m. on the day they are to appear.

what he was getting out of his education never hesitated when he came
to the end of the road of education. He turned to the right immediately
because he knew where he was going and was equipped to overcome any
obstacles he encountered.
Farther back along the road of education are thousands of college
students, all looking in the same direction—forward. All about them are
opportunities which make or break them. Some of them, pausing to look
around, and losing sight of their goal, drop by the wayside. They must
finally reach the fork in the roads by a long and tedious detour. Of those
who go on, some grasp the opportunities, and some do not. Those who
do not may keep up with the others, and, in some cases, even forge ahead
and reach the end of the road first.
However, inevitably they will turn to the left, while their wiser
fellows wish them well and choose the rocky road which brings them,
in the end, to SUCCESS.

quarter of work will begin tomorrow.
The beginning of a new quarter, particularly the Spring Quarter, is
an excellent time to take an inventory. Possibly the senior who is to
graduate soon makes the most startling discoveries when he "takes stock."
Situated as he is, at the end of the road of education which stretches
hack some fifteen or sixteen years, he can tell fairly well just what he
has accomplished. Ahead of him, the road forks. The rocky one, to the
right, which does not look easy to traverse, leads to success. The smooth
one. to the left, winds aimlessly away, finally disappearing down over the
edge of a steep hill. Seemingly, that road is harmless enough. Besides,
there are more people traveling it. It is the road to failure.
The man at the fork in the roads looks back again. I'pon what he
sees will depend which road he will take ahead. If his education has
trained him mentally, morally, and physically, as it should, he will be
well fitted to take the more difficult route and reach his destination. If
he has not made the most of his time, particularly in college, he will
probably turn to the left, and drift along with the others who, slowly,
but none the less surely, disappear over the hill.
Once he starts on the wrong road, Mr. Graduate will find it mighty
hard to get back on the right one. There are no short cuts. Ile must
retrace his steps and start over from the place where the roads fork.
The fellow who is forced to turn to the left might not have found
himself there, had he "taken stock" at the end of each quarter in college,
or even at the end of each year. The man who knew at all times just
