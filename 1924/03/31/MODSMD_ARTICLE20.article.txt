# JUNIOR OPERA TRYOUTS TO START TOMORROW
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Junior Opera will be
held in the Assembly hall on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday evenings
from 7 to 10 under the supervision of
Gene Trago, who is to direct the pro- j
duction.
As the cast this year is unusually |
large a big turn-out is expected.
large and elaborate chorus has been j
provided for in order to give many j
aspirants a chance to frolic into the
sphere of the spotlight while warbling,
to the tune of some popular ditty. All
men and all but the freshman women j
are eligible to try out.
