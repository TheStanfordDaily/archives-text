THWARTED
I wandered thoughtfully along
By Lagunita's basin
And met a man so woebegone
I asked him for the reason.
His eyes were blood-shot and besides
Were filled with nameless terrors,
His hair was matted, stiff and long,
His life was made of errors.
His clothes were torn and how they
hung!
Half-off and full of wrinkles.
He clasped and often wrung his hands,
His eyes shed tears in sprinkles.
The most pathetic man upon
The earth's indifferent crust.
The picture of him standing there
Will haunt me 'til I'm dust!
And then his tale he b'gan to tell.
Oil! How his voice then wrung.
My heart! Into my eyes
The hot tears quickly sprung.
"Speak on," 1 said. "Speak on and tell
Your tale of woe, my man.
I'll listen to it throngh my tears
And hear it if I can."
He looked his gratitude at me
And then began to speak;
And with each word his tremulance
Rose to a piercing shriek.
"Ah, woe is me, ah woe, woe, woe!
For days and nights I've prayed
This al-omr.ipotent for help,
But yet He has delayed.
"Oh, that I might complete my plans i
'Twill kill me if 1 don't
Die before I've carried
Out my plans, I simply won't.
"But toll me, stranger, tell me please,
How may ray life I take
By drowning—if the cursed rain
Does not fill up the lake?"
And with these words he fell a heap j
Of moaning, mad despair.
He could not drown himself, the I
wretch!
I wept and left him there. —I. C.
Three hours I sit in dazed dismay,
No flashes seem to come my way.
The bell! The bell! Time to go!
Can't help it if the mark is low;
Can't help it if I flunk.
With beaten air. I hurry by,
The prof's cold and condemning eve,
As he, silent, accepts my novel bunk.
Outside the crowd who draw the "A's"
Are whining their D-minus lays;
"We flunked —they played us dirt!"
When I have listened to their lies,
I dine on fifty ice cream pies,
With rat poison for desert.
