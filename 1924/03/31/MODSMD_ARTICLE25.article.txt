## Did You Know That- ? 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Suzanne can wield a wicked cue, but her pocket billiard game, unlike her
tennis game, is handicapped because she has to keep one foot on the ground.
And speaking of pool, one naturally thinks of Johnnie Weissniuller, who
breaks a swimming pool record every day or so. He likes his water hard as
well as wet and is always among tlie first out on the steel runners each winter.
Lastly, our old pal and fellow Californian, Earl Thomson, the fastest hurdler
who ever lived, is good on another kind of "sticks" and skis about a bit
while not busy coaching at Yale. "The ski's the limit," says Earl.
