# "BEST OF ITS KIND" SAYS JOHN LEMOS OF WILD FLOWER EXHIBIT
## Arrangements Made to Keep Collection on Display Due to Popularity 
### Allene Thorpe 
"The best of its kind in existence
may well be applied to the collection
! of wild flowers now 011 exhibition at
the Art Gallery," says John T. Lemos
of the Art Gallery. "For this reason
arrangements have been made to leave
it on display longer.
Unusual Interest Shown
"Many private art collectors and
! several public institutions have shown
unusual interest in it as something
I that should be placed 011 permanent
i display where people could study it."
Miss Ethel Wickes, who painted the
flowers, is 3 resident of San Francisco
j and has been working at art since she
was fifteen. She originally planned to
be a painter of animals and later she
became proficient in the painting of
' birds.
Finally, Miss Wickes painted several
i pictures of California wild flowers that
1 particularly appealed to her and be
! came sufficiently interested to start
I the collection now on display. She
j found that there are between three
I and four thousand Californian wild
flowers, some of them rare and diffi
; cult to obtain.
Well Handled Technique
Experts who have examined Miss
Wickes' wild flower paintings say they
j are a rare combination of good com
position, botanical accuracy, and well
1 handled technique. The free artistic
finish noticeable in her work is seldom
| seen in flower paintings.
Contrary to tlie popular idea, water
| color work is the most difficult of
all the mediums. The difficulty in
handling transparent water color lies
j in the fact that all the highlights or
! liter tones must be left on the paper
: while the medium and dark tones are
painted around them. 111 oil paintings
I the colors are opaque and a light spot
can be painted 011 top of a dark one
without any difficulty. This makes it
| very easy to remedy any errors made
in the tone or construction of an oil
1 painting.
Water Colors Difficult Medium
In water color work the paper is
I fastened to a drawing board and the
outlines of the subject are sketched
lightly with a pencil. The entire sur
| face of the paper is then flooded with a

wash of clear water, and when this
has dried sufficiently so that the paper
feels slightly damp to the hand the
lighter tones of the picture are put in.
When these lighter tones are nearly
dry the medium tones are laid in and
finally the deeper colors and accents
are added. Using one brush and water
sup for all the light colors and a
separate one for the dark colors helps
keep the tones clear and crisp in ap
pearance. Water color work is just be
ginning to be appreciated in America,
although in Europe and in England
particularly it has long been popular.
