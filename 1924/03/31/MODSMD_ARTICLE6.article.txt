# 'TINY' HARTRANFT STARS AS CARD VARSITY DOWNS U. S. C. TRACKSTERS BY 79-52 SCORE
## Stanford Ace Comes Within Two Feet of World's Records in Shot and Discus Throw 
### Wallace Knox 
urpiNY" Hartranft's phenomenal heaves in the shot and discus, both of
which came within two feet of the world's records, featured the track
meet with the Trojans last Saturday and helped the Cardinal trackmen to
snow the southerners under a 79 to 52 score.
Charlie Hunter's collection of Olympic Club satelifes were hopelessly out
classed by the Stanford team before vacation and were defeated S5 to 4f».
Hartranft silenced all of the doubtful ones with his sensational victory over
Norman Anderson and "Bud" Houser in both of the weight events. "Tiny''
tossed out the discus 154 feet 4 1-4 inches, which made Anderson's mark of
144 feet impotent.
Wins in Shot
In the shot Tiny had little trouble in downing the stellar U. S. C. weight
throwers. His throw of 49 feet 4 inches took first, but afterwards he put the
cannon ball out 51 feet 4 inches in an -exhibition, four inches better than the
world's record, but the throw was disqualified because he stepped over the
board.
U. S. C. upset the dope in the high hurdles, Dye took tlva lead in the start
and managed to keep ahead of "Swede" Leistner the entire distance, finishing
in 0:15 1-5. "Swede" did his stuff in the low sticks, however, by running
away from Grumbles and Anderson.
Scofield, whose jump of 12 feet G inches in the Olympic Club meet made
him the choice for first in the U. S. C. meet, had hard luck and knocked the
bar down with his hand three times as he was going over. White of U. S. C.
<S>took first and Wright tied for second

in this event, with Guy Dennis.
Fred Anderson was doped to win the
high jump but he was disqualified
early ni the jumping. The event went
at 5 feet 11 1-2 inches with Ross of
IT. S. C. first and Kemnitzer second.
Richardson Wins
Bill Richardson ran a beautifully
timed race in the half, trailing Niers
bach of U. S. C. throughout the early
part, but uncorking a sprint on the
home stretch that put him well to the
front. Mcintosh took a third.
Torkelson had the pole in the quar
ter and kept the lead until the back
stretch when he was passed by Miller
and Van Judah who finished in the
order named. Storie, who was slated
to win this rat-e, was unable to run
because of sickness.
