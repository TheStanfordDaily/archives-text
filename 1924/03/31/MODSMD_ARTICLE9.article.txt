# Postoffice Improves Southern Mail Service
## 
### 
Farly mail dispatch service to south
ern California went into effect at the
Stanford postoffice on March 16. This
early mail closes at 6 a.m., and ar
rives in Los Angeles at 10:45 p.m. on
the same day. Up to the time the new
service was made possible the south
ern mails were slow.
The Stanford postoffice is also ap
plying for faster dispatch service to
San Francisco. These additional dis
patches are made possible by the en
largement of the postoffice building,
permitting facilities for the more
rapid handling of the mails.
