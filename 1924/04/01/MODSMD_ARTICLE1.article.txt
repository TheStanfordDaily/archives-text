# 'POP' WARNER HERE 10 TAKE HELM Of GRIDIRON MACHINE
## New Football Mentor Begins Annual Spring Practice This Afternoon 
### 
"Pop" Warner, carrying with him
the hopes of future Stanford football
teams and a bag of golf clubs, arrived
on the campus this morning prepared
to take charge of spring practice which
begins on the varsity field today.
"The success of Andy Kerr and
'Tiny' Thornhill in the last two sea
sons has been so evident that it would
be foolish to predict any great im
provement over their work this sea
son aside from the fact that it is rea
sonable to say that the Stanford team
can be expected to develop just as
much this year as it has in the past
seasons under Kerr and Thornhill,"
said Warner.
"Practice," he continued, "consists
of much of the same routine work as
last spring, getting the fellows in con
dition early, lining up' the new ma
terial, and getting a foundation for a
team on which to begin work in the
fall."
Warner was well satisfied with the
scholastic achievements of the football
men as a whole in the winter quarter,
and is satisfied that few men will be
lost to the squad via the keen edge of
the faculty axe.
When asked what his opinion was
on the end-over-end pass, over which
there was a great deal of criticism in
the Western press, Warner stated:
"The criticism on the end-over-end
pass is unjustified. It is used exten
sively in many Eastern colleges and
lias proved to have many advantages
over the spiral. Gil Dobie has used the
end-over-end with no end of success,
and other coaches over the country
are beginning to use this type in pre
ference to the spiral. To say that the
end-over-end pass was solely responsi
ble for many of the blocked kicks last
season is unfair, inasmuch as there
are many other things which might
have been the cause.
"There is little difference in the
time it takes a center to throw the
eud-over-end, hardly enough to be de
tected by a stop-watch. I have com
pared the two thoroughly and there is
little doubt in my mind as to the ad
vantages of the end-over-end to the
other type."
Warner had nothing definite to say
in regard to the new football rulings
which required the ball to be kicked
from the center of the field without
an improvised mound, and the play
for-point to start three yards from the
goal line instead of five.
The details of the rulings were still

obscure, he said, but should the mound
be done away with it would only make
for a lower, swifter kick, which would
probably cause the ball to go over the
goal line, and force plays to start
oftener from the twenty-yard line.
Using (he mound the balls travel higher
and not so taÂ»\ putirne,* the ball in
play immediately, which makes for a
faster and more interesting game.
It would make little difference, the
new pig-skin mentor claimed, to have
the play for extra point start from the
three-yard line instead of the live.
