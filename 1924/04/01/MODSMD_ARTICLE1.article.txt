# 'POP' WARNER HERE 10 TAKE HELM Of GRIDIRON MACHINE
## New Football Mentor Begins Annual Spring Practice This Afternoon 
### 
"Pop" Warner, carrying with him
the hopes of future Stanford football
teams and a bag of golf clubs, arrived
on the campus this morning prepared
to take charge of spring practice which
begins on the varsity field today.
"The success of Andy Kerr and
'Tiny' Thornhill in the last two sea
sons has been so evident that it would
be foolish to predict any great im
provement over their work this sea
son aside from the fact that it is rea
sonable to say that the Stanford team
can be expected to develop just as
much this year as it has in the past
seasons under Kerr and Thornhill,"
said Warner.
"Practice," he continued, "consists
of much of the same routine work as
last spring, getting the fellows in con
dition early, lining up' the new ma
terial, and getting a foundation for a
team on which to begin work in the
fall."
Warner was well satisfied with the
scholastic achievements of the football
men as a whole in the winter quarter,
and is satisfied that few men will be
lost to the squad via the keen edge of
the faculty axe.
When asked what his opinion was
on the end-over-end pass, over which
there was a great deal of criticism in
the Western press, Warner stated:
"The criticism on the end-over-end
pass is unjustified. It is used exten
sively in many Eastern colleges and
lias proved to have many advantages
over the spiral. Gil Dobie has used the
end-over-end with no end of success,
and other coaches over the country
