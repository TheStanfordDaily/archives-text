# FALL STUDENTS BRIGHTEST
## Comparison Made by Intelligence Tests and Academic Work for Two Years 
### 
Students entering: in the autumn
quarter have more brains than students
entering in the other three quarters,
says a report of the sub-committee on
student ability at Stanford.
This determination has been made
through comparison of psychological
examinations with academic grades for
the last two years.
Intelligence tests were first given to
entering students at the beginning of
the fall quarter of 1921. Since then
2700 students have been examined and
their records studied.
327 Questions Asked.
The tests in use, prepared by Pro
fessor E. L. Thorndike of Columbia
University, contain twenty-one differ
ent kinds of tests and 327 items; they
have a wide range of information called
for, and are designed to be tests of
power rather than speed, though a time
limit is set.
"B" and "A" students have been
found to have an average intelligence
test score of eighty-five; those from
"C" to "B," seventy-five, and those with
less than a "C" rating, sixty-three. No
student with a score as high as seventy
is likely to "Hunk out" through inability
to carry his hours.

High scoring students not only get
j better marks, but also carry a some
what heavier program than students
I having low psychological scores.
Women with high scores usually
! major in language, literature, econom
ics, history, education, law, and phil
osophy, while men with superior scores
enter scientific or engineering fields.
Transfers Score High.
Transfer students, both men and
j women, score slightly higher than
freshmen but arc equal to those in their
own class matriculated here.
Students entering from high schools
with an attendance of 1000 or over,
j make a higher average score than those
entering from smaller high schools.
This difference is less evident in the
; case of women, and with both men and
i women is less marked in the scores
i ranging above ninety than below sixty.
Women entering on the preferred list
average a marked superiority of score.
I Those entering on the numbered list
| attain the general average.
Daughters of Faculty Members Score
Low.
Daughters of faculty members and
alumni score somewhat lower than
average while a good percentage scorc
below fiifty.
Scores arc proportionately lower as
the age of the student increases. Schol
arship marks earned by students ma
triculating at various ages agree with
the psychological scores in the verdict
that the younger the student the higher
the score he will make, and the better
material he is likely to be. This age
difference in scholarship is not as no
ticeable among women.
Men initiated into fraternities have a
somewhat lower average score than
non-fraternity men. Sorority women
have a slightly higher average score
than non-sorority women.
Swimmers, Debaters, Actors, Get
High Marks.
Members of men's major sports
teams have an average scorc ftf sixty
one or ten points below the mean aver
age for all entering men. The varsity
swimming, debating, and dramatic
groups rank from seven to eleven
points above average. The freshman
tennis, swimming and socccr groups,
and women's athletic teams rank with
the average of entering students. Of
the total major sports group, forty-four
per cent score below sixty, and twenty
eight per cent below fifty.
"New Line" on Student.
"The psychological score tells what
the student might be expected to do
under reasonably favorable circum
stances, rather than what he actually
will do," says the report in explanation
of the tests. "The predictive value of
the test would be much greater, but for
such factors as variable application,
outside work, ill health, unreliability of
college marks, and the industry of the
student. It does not measure social
and moral qualities, although these are
known to have more or less positive
correlation with intelligence, but to a
considerable extent the psychological
examination gives a 'new line' on the
student."
