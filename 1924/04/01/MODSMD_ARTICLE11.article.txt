# Canoes, Swimming Suits, Doomed to Discard—Lake Lagunita Remains Empty
## 
### 
Turn your old canoe upside down
and put it in the cellar. Sell your
water-wings or give 'em to the fish in
the bay. Pack your bathing suit with
mothballs and hide it. For, in the big
words of the small boy from Palo
Alto, "There ain't gonna be any lake."
It's true enough that when the finals
ended, the rain began, but not having
any Hatfield on the job to cause a
cloudburst, the moisture wasn't more
than enough to soak up the ground.
The Comptroller's office is authority
for the statement that Searsville lake
is three and a half feet below the level
that would justify turning any water
into the Queeners' playground. At the
present time there is not enough water
to fulfill the normal requirements for
irrigation.
So —we'll have no lake this year
unless —the clouds get in and put in a
few eight-hour days.
The outlook is bad but we can still
hope. For, after all, as the popular
song has it,
"How in the -—world, can the old
folks tell,
That it ain't agonna rain no more?"
