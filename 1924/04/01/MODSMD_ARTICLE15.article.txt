# CARD BASEBALLERS BEAT BAKERSFIELD STANDARD OIL, 5-2
## St. Mary's, Only Undefeated College Nine in North, Here Tomorrow 
### 
The varsity ball nine stopped off at
Bakersfield yesterday on the way
home from the southern trip and
handed the Standard Oil nine a 5-1
defeat.
Solomon pitched a beautiful game
for the Cards and was backed up with
strong support. The Stanford sluggers
recovered their skill in the contest
and smashed out enough clean hits to
store the game away.
St. Mary's ball team, which holds
victories over all the colleges in this
section of California, will play its sec
ond game of the year against Stanford
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30 on the
varsity diamond.
Saints' Pitching Staff Strong
The Saints have a well balanced
club and an unusually strong pitching
staff. Their only contest with Cali
fornia this year ended in a win for
the Oakland college, when Nounan,
the Blue and Gold's star hurler, fal
tered in the ninth inning.
In the first game of the Stanford
series, St. Mary's came out ahead, but
it is a question whether Stanford did
not almost beat itself. The Cardinal
fielders made twelve errors during the
game which ended 12-2.
Santa Clara has also fallen before
the attack of the Saints' sluggers in
one game.
With all the errors out of the Cards'
system, the game Wednesday should
be a close one. Bud Woodward, who
has been elected to replace Patterson
as captain of the varsity, will be on
his toes to lead the nine against St.
Mary's.
