# Howdy, Pop

### 
Glen Warner, who is to direct the destinies of the Stanford football,
varsity arrived oil the campus this morning and went right to work, start
ing spring practice this afternoon.
With "Pop" on the grounds now to take charge of the Cardinal squad,
Stanford has the best coaching staff in the United States. Warner, who is
known as the "daddy of them all" will be ably assisted in his work by
Andy Kerr and "Tiny" Thornhill.
"Pop" is a coach of whom Stanford may well be proud, lie comes
from the east with a wonderful reputation which his teams at Pittsburgh
and elsewhere well justify, in the past two years, while still undef con
tract at Pitt, he has conducted spring practice on the Farm. In this way,
he has become acquainted with most of the material which is the basis of
Cardinal football hopes in the future.
In his two short stays here, he has made himself immensely popular
with students and players.
Stanford is also fortunate in again having Andy Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill on the Farm. For the past two years, Andy has taken charge
of the football team and "Tiny" has been his assistant. Now, in spite of
flattering offers from other colleges, both of these men are to remain in
the capacity of assistants. They have introduced the Warner system and
have laid the foundation on which Warner is to build victorious teams in
the future.
With the material they have, Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill will prob
ably develop, in the next few years, some of the most powerful football
aggregations Stanford has ever seen. It has been freely predicted that
1924 will see the "arrival" of the Stanford football varsity.
Every Stanford man and woman is confident that "Pop" and his lieu
tenants can deliver the goods. We're glad you're here, "Pop," make
yourself at home!
