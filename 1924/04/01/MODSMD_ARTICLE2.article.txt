# TONY SARG PUPPETS TO BE SHOWN ON CAMPUS THURSDAY
## 
### 
The Chinese Willow Plate story, to
lie given by Tony Sarg's marionettes
in the Assembly hall Thursday after
noon and evening, is based on the
ancient legend pictured on the well
known willow plates.
The story consists of ten scenes,
each lasting several minutes, and tell
ing some phase of the love story of the
beautiful daughter of the Mandarin
and her lbver, who had been secre
tary to the Mandarin. A procession of
lantern-bearers, a caravan bringing a
young nobleman to the house of the
Mandarin, the pursuit of the lovers,
and other similar incidents bring in
brilliant costumes, startling night
acenes, monstrous goldfish in subma
rine gardens, and the dog which Tony
Sarg always includes in his puppet
plays.
Figures Are Transparent
The figures are worked out in a
transparent substance, brilliantly col
ored and held together by wires and
clamps, and so jointed that the figures
are able to perform all the movements
for which the Tony Sarg marionettes
are famous. The characters are thrown
on the screen from behind, and the
artist has invented a way of produc
ing the effect of fully-rounded ligures
instead of merely Hat ones.
Victor Herbert, well-known com
poser, has written the music which
will be played by a Chinese orchestra,
sung by the artists that manipulate
the characters, and used for the danc
ing of marionettes and members of the
company.
Tickets for the performance will go
on sale at the Administration building
and at Crandall's tomorrow. Seats for
the evening show will be reserved at
$1.00, 75 cents, and 50 cents. Twelve
lows will be reserved for the after
noon at $1.00, and general admission
is 50 cents for adults, 25 cents for
