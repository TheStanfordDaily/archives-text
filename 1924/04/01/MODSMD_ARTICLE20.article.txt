Next Monday, students interested in journalism will be given an op
portunity to try out for the editorial staff of the Daily Palo Alto.
Underclassmen, and particularly freshmen, are needed and will be
given preference. Journalism at Stanford ranks second only to athletics,
and the Daily offers anyone an excellent opportunity to gain invaluable
experience and get out for some activity.
At the present time, there is but one freshman on the staff and it is
probable that ten or twelve more will be added after this tryout period,
which will last a week. Previous experience is not necessary.
The class of 1927 will furnish two editors for the Daily Palo Alto and
those men and women who get on the staff first and gain the most experi
ence will have the advantage.
The Daily does not demand an exhorbitant amount of time, and staff
members are given a chance to learn a little of all sides of the newspaper
game.
The Class of 1927 has done well in other lines of activity in the past
six months. It will be interesting to see how it measures up in journalism.
