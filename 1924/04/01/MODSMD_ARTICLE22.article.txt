ELEGY IN A COUNTRY QUIZ-YARD
The bell's harsh sound peals forth its
plea,
And beckons on to fate, both you and
me.
One farewell glance at notebooks neat,
Where cartoons clash with poetry de
plete,
Repeating with unusual overburning
zest,
The points so emphasized in last year's
test,
1 number, bawl up, and define,
Until at last I think it mastered-mine!
Professors stare, now deaf and dumb,
On student victims, helpless numb,
"Get set!" commands a puny voice,
"Select eight questions of your choice.
You shouldn't all look so perplexed,
It deals with topics outlined in the
text."
A snap: yet as I got them dumbly
down,
Fleetly fade the vision of cap and
gown,
Cold chills park down along my spine,
When swift and brainy friends of mine
Stalk boldly from that hated place,
With knowledge that would save dis
grace. —D. M.

My Dear Mr. Dolley: The lake is
dry, and so am I, and I'm hoping you're
the same. My throat is sore, no dope
therefore, and I think you're a dirty
name. We live, oh why, in a world so
dry, that summer will burst into
flame; no water, no booze, nothing
but blues; it's hard to keep looking
dapper. Naught but choc malt, it's
partly your fault, you clumsy damn
wire tapper.

The Cannibals' ChoraT Society will
gather after the consumption of the
new Missionary and sing, "Where is
That Dear Old Grad-U-Atc?"
