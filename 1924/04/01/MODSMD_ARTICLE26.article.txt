# SPORTS OF 1924
## DID YOU KNOW THATâ€”? 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Harry Heilmann, leading batsman of the American league, is an expert
handball player and during the winter plays regularly at the Detroit Athletic
club.
Bill Tilden is a bridge hound. I watched Bill play cards just before the
finals of the National Tennis tournament in 1022. The Grand Slam he made
then was nothing to the one he made on the courts later when Billy Johnson
led him two sets to one and three games to none.
Joie Ray, runner, extraordinary, taxi driver, and inventor of the capital "I,"
longs to be a real boxer, and has competed in amateur tournaments in Chicago.
Today George Sisler is all of 31 years old.
