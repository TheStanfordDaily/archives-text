# JUSTICE CLARKE TO TALK ON LEAGUE OF NATIONS
## Non-Partisan League Head Will Give Lecture in Assembly Hall 
### 
Justice John Hessin Clarke, presi
dent of the League of Nations Non
partisan Association, will talk on the
"League of Nations" at 7:30 tonight in
the Assembly hall.
Justice Clarke resigned his position
in September, 1922, in order that he
might use all his energies towards the
furthering of the League cause. He
preaches the League first, last, and al
ways, with other .considerations after
wards. Clarke says, "I believe the fu
ture of the United States depends
upon our entrance into the League.
Reservations may or may not be ne
cessary—the main thing to do is to
join."
Is Leader in Cause
Since the death of Woodrow Wilson,
who was the great crusader in the
movement, Clarke has stepped up into
the place of national leader, since he
seems most adapted to the position by
interest and achievement.
Even before the Versailles Confer
ence assembled, Clarke had hopes that
a league for peace would be the last
ing result of the war. He fully en
dorsed President Harding's world
court proposal, but objected when he
stated that he had put the League of
Nations aside.
Clarke is an independent advocate
of the League idea. However, he pre
diets that the League issue will be a
decisive factor in the next election.
Always in support of the same cause,
Clarke has made lecture tours in ihe
northern states, and has always been
heralded and recognized as a brilliant
speaker. Now at sixty-seven, he speaks
as often as his health permits, and is
active in all work for the League. Jus
tice Clarke is at present making a
tour of California, lecturing. He comes
with recommendations from all over
the eastern states, for his stimulating
talks.
Justice for Six Years
As an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court for six years, Clarke
preferred a certain blunt honesty of
intellect to refinement of argument.
He was one of the Justices who ob
jected to the unconstitutionality of
the Child Labor Law.
In the position of Federal Judge in
Ohio from 1914 to 1916, Clarke was
known for his innovations in the meth
od of Americanizing aliens. After
granting citizenship, he held a recep
tion for the newly-fledged citizens, and
made them feel the importance of
their new status.
Before that time, Clarke had been
practicing as a corporation lawyer in
Lisbon, Youngstown, and Cleveland,
Ohio. He is a native of Ohio, and was
admitted to the bar in that state in
1878.

the eastern states, for his stimulating
talks.
Justice for Six Years
As an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court for six years, Clarke
preferred a certain blunt honesty of
intellect to refinement of argument.
He was one of the Justices who ob
jected to the unconstitutionality of
the Child Labor Law.
In the position of Federal Judge in
Ohio from 1914 to 1916, Clarke was
known for his innovations in the meth
od of Americanizing aliens. After
granting citizenship, he held a recep
tion for the newly-fledged citizens, and
made them feel the importance of
their new status.
Before that time, Clarke had been
practicing as a corporation lawyer in
Lisbon, Youngstown, and Cleveland,
Ohio. He is a native of Ohio, and was
admitted to the bar in that state in
1878.
Justice John Hessin Clarke, presi
dent of the League of Nations Non
partisan Association, will talk on the
"League of Nations" at 7:30 tonight in
the Assembly hall.
Justice Clarke resigned his position
in September, 1922, in order that he
might use all his energies towards the
furthering of the League cause. He
preaches the League first, last, and al
ways, with other .considerations after
wards. Clarke says, "I believe the fu
ture of the United States depends
upon our entrance into the League.
Reservations may or may not be ne
cessary—the main thing to do is to
join."
Is Leader in Cause
Since the death of Woodrow Wilson,
who was the great crusader in the
movement, Clarke has stepped up into
the place of national leader, since he
seems most adapted to the position by
interest and achievement.
Even before the Versailles Confer
ence assembled, Clarke had hopes that
a league for peace would be the last
ing result of the war. He fully en
dorsed President Harding's world
court proposal, but objected when he
stated that he had put the League of
Nations aside.
Clarke is an independent advocate
of the League idea. However, he pre
diets that the League issue will be a
decisive factor in the next election.
Always in support of the same cause,
Clarke has made lecture tours in ihe
northern states, and has always been
heralded and recognized as a brilliant
speaker. Now at sixty-seven, he speaks
as often as his health permits, and is
active in all work for the League. Jus
tice Clarke is at present making a
tour of California, lecturing. He comes
with recommendations from all over
the eastern states, for his stimulating
talks.
