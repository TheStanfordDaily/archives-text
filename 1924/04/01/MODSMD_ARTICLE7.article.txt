# UNION INCREASES PRICES SLIGHTLY DUE TO BIG LOSS

### 
An advance of 5c on table d'hote
meals and on full salad orders, and an
increase of 2c on all beverages are
the principal changes which have been
announced by Miss Etta H. Handy on
the Union menu.
This action was made necessary be
cause of a loss of $7618.35 sustained by
the cafeteria and main dining room
of the Union from October 1, 1923, to
March 1, 1924, since the opening of
the Encina Dining Hall. During 1923
the Stanford Union lost $3720.38 in
the operation of the main dining room
and was able to meet the loss with in
come derived from student fees and
rentals. However, the loss sustained
so far this year is too large to be met
by the limited income available from
other departments, hence the neces
sary increase in prices. The steam
charges and payroll for which the
Union is liable during the vacation
period, always causes a loss at this
time, but it is the present desire of
the management to make the Union
pay day by day and to provide for the
necessary loss during vacations.
