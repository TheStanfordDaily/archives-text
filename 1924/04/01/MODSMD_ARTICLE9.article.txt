# SWIMMING MANAGER URGES THAT WOMEN SIGN NOW FOR MEET
## 
### 
All women are asked to sign up im
mediately to train for the Stanford-
California swimming meet, set for
April 19. This is the urgent request
of Mabel McKibbin, swimming mana
ger.
Training for the competition will be
intensive, five times a week during the
short period before the event. By a
recent ruling of the governing board
of the Women's Athletic Association,
women may transfer from swimming
to any other sport after the meet and
receive their W. A. A. points in the
sport chosen.
