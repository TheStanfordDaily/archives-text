# VARSITY TRACK STOCK SLUMPS OVER VACATION

Big Meet.
To offset the loss of these men
Track Captain Nelson Van Judah and
Elmer Elliott, crack miler, have re

Meet last year and his presence on
the team should give Stanford three
places in the mile run in all of the

in the majority of the remaining
meets.
Fred Anderson ran into some hard
luck against U. S. C. and was elimi
