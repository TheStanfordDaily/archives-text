# VARSITY TRACK STOCK SLUMPS OVER VACATION
## Return of Judah and Elliott Strengthens Squad in Quarter and Mile 
### Wallace Knox 
Stanford track stock met with a
bearish action over the vacation and
registered a drop of several points.
The slump came because of the upset
in several events in the U. S. C. meet,
and because Jim Arthur and Lynn
Farish have decided not to return to
the University this quarter.
Arthur would have placed in the
shot and discus in the Big Meet, and
Farish should have been a strong con
tender for first honors in the javelin.
The former is working and the latter
left for France with the United States
rugby team.
Storie Is Disabled
Bill Storie, who was expected to
break the Stanford-California quarter
milt:' record is suffering from internal
trouble and may not be able to run
for a few weeks, although it is prob
able that he will be in shape for the
Big Meet.
To offset the loss of these men
Track Captain Nelson Van Judah and
Elmer Elliott, crack miler, have re
turned. Elliott won the mile in the Big
Meet last year and his presence on
the team should give Stanford three
places in the mile run in all of the
meets. Van Judah is a valuable quar
,ter-miler and also runs the relay.
Hale Shows Well in Century
Marshal Hale showed up well
against U. S. C. when he copped the
century in 0:10 flat. His leg is still
troubling him, but if it gets no worse,
he should be able to break the tape
in the majority of the remaining
meets.
Fred Anderson ran into some hard
luck against U. S. C. and was elimi
nated early in the high jump trials. He
was expected to place easily, but was
unable to take-off from the turf on
the Coliseum field and as a result
not come through. Anderson has been
doing 6 feet all season, and can be
counted upon for this mark while
jumping in the Stanford pits.
Vault Is Disappointment
The pole vault at U. S. C. was like
wise a disappointment because Sco
field, who was doped to win, failed to
place. Scofield has done 12 feet 6 but
lacks the experience to come through
consistently in close competition. The
pole-vault take-off was also poor.
As there is no meet scheduled until
a week from Saturday, when the
tracksters go against the small col
leges in the Southern California con
ference, Coach "Dink" Templeton will
have an opportunity to get in some
good licks with his men, who should
show a marked improvement by that
time.
The Southern California conference
meet will be the only one between
now and the Big Meet for the Cards.
After the annual classic the men will
continue working out for the P. A. A.
contest which will be held at Stanford
and the California relays which will be
held at Berkeley. It is probable that
the team will be sent East to compete
in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
Southern Team Strong
Last year the southern schools de
feated the Redshirts in a close meet,
the relay being the deciding event.
Nothing has been heard of the strength
of the team that will be sent up this
year, but it is certain to prove a
formidable one, as it comprises the
best of the athletes from each of the
schools.
"Tiny" Hartranft will be watched
closer than any other Stanford man
in this meet because of the remark
able performance he made at Los
Angeles last week. "Tiny" has been
showing a steady improvement in each
meet, and, against the Trojans, he suc
ceeded in coming within two feet of
the world's records in both the discus
and the shot. If he continues to im
prove he should be a certain winner
for Stanford in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
and also in the Olympic games.
The rain yesterday put a damper on
the workouts, but if the weather clears
up "Dink" will begin in earnest to
prepare his charges for the Big Meet.

Farish should have been a strong con
tender for first honors in the javelin.
The former is working and the latter
left for France with the United States
rugby team.
Storie Is Disabled
Bill Storie, who was expected to
break the Stanford-California quarter
milt:' record is suffering from internal
trouble and may not be able to run
for a few weeks, although it is prob
able that he will be in shape for the
Big Meet.
To offset the loss of these men
Track Captain Nelson Van Judah and
Elmer Elliott, crack miler, have re
turned. Elliott won the mile in the Big
Meet last year and his presence on
the team should give Stanford three
places in the mile run in all of the
meets. Van Judah is a valuable quar
,ter-miler and also runs the relay.
Hale Shows Well in Century
Marshal Hale showed up well
against U. S. C. when he copped the
century in 0:10 flat. His leg is still
troubling him, but if it gets no worse,
he should be able to break the tape
in the majority of the remaining
meets.
Fred Anderson ran into some hard
luck against U. S. C. and was elimi
nated early in the high jump trials. He
was expected to place easily, but was
unable to take-off from the turf on
the Coliseum field and as a result
not come through. Anderson has been
doing 6 feet all season, and can be
counted upon for this mark while
jumping in the Stanford pits.
Vault Is Disappointment
The pole vault at U. S. C. was like
wise a disappointment because Sco
field, who was doped to win, failed to
place. Scofield has done 12 feet 6 but
lacks the experience to come through
consistently in close competition. The
pole-vault take-off was also poor.
As there is no meet scheduled until
a week from Saturday, when the
tracksters go against the small col
leges in the Southern California con
ference, Coach "Dink" Templeton will
have an opportunity to get in some
good licks with his men, who should
show a marked improvement by that
time.
The Southern California conference
meet will be the only one between
now and the Big Meet for the Cards.
After the annual classic the men will
continue working out for the P. A. A.
contest which will be held at Stanford
and the California relays which will be
held at Berkeley. It is probable that
the team will be sent East to compete
in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
Southern Team Strong
Last year the southern schools de
feated the Redshirts in a close meet,
the relay being the deciding event.
Nothing has been heard of the strength
of the team that will be sent up this
year, but it is certain to prove a
formidable one, as it comprises the
best of the athletes from each of the
schools.
"Tiny" Hartranft will be watched
closer than any other Stanford man
in this meet because of the remark
able performance he made at Los
Angeles last week. "Tiny" has been
showing a steady improvement in each
meet, and, against the Trojans, he suc
ceeded in coming within two feet of
the world's records in both the discus
and the shot. If he continues to im
prove he should be a certain winner
for Stanford in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
and also in the Olympic games.
The rain yesterday put a damper on
the workouts, but if the weather clears
up "Dink" will begin in earnest to
prepare his charges for the Big Meet.
Stanford track stock met with a
bearish action over the vacation and
registered a drop of several points.
The slump came because of the upset
in several events in the U. S. C. meet,
and because Jim Arthur and Lynn
Farish have decided not to return to
the University this quarter.
Arthur would have placed in the
shot and discus in the Big Meet, and
Farish should have been a strong con
tender for first honors in the javelin.
The former is working and the latter
left for France with the United States
rugby team.
