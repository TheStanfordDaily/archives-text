# VIOLATORS OF HONOR CODE ARE PENALIZED BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## 
### 
The Men's Council has taken final
action on four cases dealing with the
violation of the honor system. One of
the offenders was suspended from the
University, with hours added to his
graduation requirements. The other
three were let off with added hours
and loss of the courses in which the
cheating was detected.
In the case in which the most dras
tic action was taken, the student ac
cused of cheating denied his guilt for
some time, hut finally confessed of his
own accord. In addition to one quar
ter's suspension from the University,
thirty hours were added to his require
ments for an A.B. degree.
The other three confessed their
guilt readily upon being questioned.
Fifteen hours were added to the gradu
ation requirements of two of them, and
ten hours to those of the third. Lighter
action was taken in the last case be
cause the offender was a freshman
who had been registered but one quar
ter. In addition, each of the three lost
the courses in which their violation of
the honor system occurred.
In each of the four cases, the cheat
ing was reported as a first offense, and
this weighed largely in giving the of
fenders a second chance.
Action on several other cases dis
covered during the finals is now being
taken, and a final decision 011 them
will be reached by the council next
week.
