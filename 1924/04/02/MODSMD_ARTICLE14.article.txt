# ENGINEERS DECLINE TO PLAY WITH BOYS IN PRETTY KNICKERS
## 
### 
Is Stanford losing all her time-hon
ored traditions? Not if the Engineers
have anything to say about it. Some
of the aged customs that somebody
thought were out of date have been
lately shoved off the calendar, but
when it comes to cords the shaggy
eared roughs object noisily. New tra
ditions can easily be started when the
good old ones are threatened and the
lawyers haven't any corner on the
hand market. Knickers are all right in
their place say the Engineers, but
their place is not on the Quad. Watch
them clap for the next pretty boy
who thinks the arcades make a first
class fairway.
