# LEAGUE OF NATIONS ONLY HOPE FOR PEACE-CLARKE
## 
### 
"The League of Nations is the only
rational hope of preventing a world
war, and nothing would add to League
prestige as much as the entrance of
the United States. Over the whole j
question hangs the menacing shadow
of another world war vastly more de-1
structive than the last."
This was the opinion expressed by
former Justice of the Supreme Court
John H. Clarke last evening in the
Assembly hall when he spoke in de
fense of the League of Nations and the
World Court, as working together for
peace.
League Without Precedent
Speaking of the League, Clarke said,
"Let us keep faith with the living and
with the dead, and join the one promis
ing experiment to secure world peace.
"It is the first attempt in all the j
long history of mankind to invite all
nations under one treaty In order to I
make it as difficult to declare war.
"During the last 150 years," he says, |
"there has been great progress made j
in science, mechanical art, and nation-j
al government, but in dealing with in-1
ternational affairs, the statesmanship
of the world has stood still, not for 150 1
but for 1000 years."
People Are Uncertain
In telling of the origin of the ;
League, its present organization, and ;
its accomplishments of the last four j
years, Clarke proved that "our people j
are not convinced that the League will
accomplish what they want in the way
of preventing war," and then refuted
all objections by his explanations of
general misunderstandings of the
meanings of the formation and work
ing of the League.
Of the fifteen objections to the
League in the Senate in 1920 all have
vanished except one, according to
Clarke, and this one is the argument
against "forming entangling alliances,"
in the words of Washington.
League Has Possibilities
"In 1917, when the United States
was bound by no such alliance and
there was no League, we were irre
sistibly drawn into the conflict with
out opportunity to prevent it or know
it was coming," said Clarke in ex
plaining that surely the League would
promote no worse conditions.
To help the economic situation and
the sufferers here and in Europe, the
United States must stabilize affairs,
and join the League, is his claim.
The first article in the Covenant
providing for withdrawal of any na
tion from the League two years after
notification, in which time all interna
tional obligations must be satisfied,
answers many objections. Clarke gave
a plea for this as a factor in favor of
the League for if it is not satisfactory
the LTnited States may once more re
turn to its state of isolation.
In endorsing the World Court idea,
Clarke showed how six United States
presidents had maintained by policy
their belief in such an institution.

League, its present organization, and ;
its accomplishments of the last four j
years, Clarke proved that "our people j
are not convinced that the League will
accomplish what they want in the way
of preventing war," and then refuted
all objections by his explanations of
general misunderstandings of the
meanings of the formation and work
ing of the League.
Of the fifteen objections to the
League in the Senate in 1920 all have
vanished except one, according to
Clarke, and this one is the argument
against "forming entangling alliances,"
in the words of Washington.
League Has Possibilities
"In 1917, when the United States
was bound by no such alliance and
there was no League, we were irre
sistibly drawn into the conflict with
out opportunity to prevent it or know
it was coming," said Clarke in ex
plaining that surely the League would
promote no worse conditions.
To help the economic situation and
the sufferers here and in Europe, the
United States must stabilize affairs,
and join the League, is his claim.
The first article in the Covenant
providing for withdrawal of any na
tion from the League two years after
notification, in which time all interna
tional obligations must be satisfied,
answers many objections. Clarke gave
a plea for this as a factor in favor of
the League for if it is not satisfactory
the LTnited States may once more re
turn to its state of isolation.
In endorsing the World Court idea,
Clarke showed how six United States
presidents had maintained by policy
their belief in such an institution.
"The League of Nations is the only
rational hope of preventing a world
war, and nothing would add to League
prestige as much as the entrance of
the United States. Over the whole j
question hangs the menacing shadow
of another world war vastly more de-1
structive than the last."
This was the opinion expressed by
former Justice of the Supreme Court
John H. Clarke last evening in the
Assembly hall when he spoke in de
fense of the League of Nations and the
World Court, as working together for
peace.
League Without Precedent
Speaking of the League, Clarke said,
"Let us keep faith with the living and
with the dead, and join the one promis
ing experiment to secure world peace.
"It is the first attempt in all the j
long history of mankind to invite all
nations under one treaty In order to I
make it as difficult to declare war.
"During the last 150 years," he says, |
"there has been great progress made j
in science, mechanical art, and nation-j
al government, but in dealing with in-1
ternational affairs, the statesmanship
of the world has stood still, not for 150 1
but for 1000 years."
People Are Uncertain
In telling of the origin of the ;
League, its present organization, and ;
its accomplishments of the last four j
years, Clarke proved that "our people j
are not convinced that the League will
