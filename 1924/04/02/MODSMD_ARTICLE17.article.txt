# DEMOCRACY IS EDUCATION SAYS DR.MEIKLEJOHN
## America Has Yet to Begin Educational System Is Belief of Speaker 
### 
"America has not yet the beginning
of an educational system. It is still in
the preliminary stages of making the
external shell," said Dr. Alexander
Meikl-ejohn this morning in the Uni
versity Assembly.
In discussing the relation of educa
tion to democracy, Meiklejohn said,
"Democracy is education. To make a
democracy is to make an educated
people.
"The question is whether we can
educate over a hundred million to such
a level that they can genuinely take
part in life as a whole, each making
his choices individually.
Education Is Only Gift
"There is only one thing one can
give, and that is education," he said.
"Other gifts end in disaster; most peo
ple have too much, What we should
do is to learn how to use what we
have.
"How much is a vote worth to a
man?" he asked. "A man gets as much
control out of the situation by a vote,
as he understands the situation. To
give him a vote when he is ignorant is
to make him the tool of another.
"Excellence has never been in a
large body of people. Will America
succeed in performing the miracle?
We have a better chance than most of
the other nations, and the only way
to find it is to play and tako a chance.
It is this sporting situation that fflakus
America a good place to live in," he
said.
"The most important thing ill a
democracy is getting people ready for
living. We, as American people, are
still in the terms of what to do. When
we have learned what to do the great
: est part of the income of the nation
will be used for educational purposes."
Telling of the two laws or duties
to which every one must conform, and
which are always in conflict with each
other, he said, "The first duty is to
appreciate what is m liie. The one
unforgivable sin is dullness, failure to
proceed, that is, to be like a dumb
beast in the face of glory.
i "Men make life fine and excellent,
jor low and tawdry. There is always
a choice between the two. We send
life up or down by the way we take it.
Second Law Is Sharing
"The second law is the moral law,
i that of sharing," he said. He quoted
the old Stoic philosopher, Epicletus,
in this, saying that if anything is
worth having in the way of excellence,
someone else should have it as well
as the person himself."
Meikiejohn says that a Doy cannot
j be educated unless his father is edu
cated. When he is uneducated him
self, and takes his body to college for
!an education, he asks that the boy
: become a stranger to him in tastes,
I lines of thinking. However, the boy
probably cannot be educated, accord
ing to Meikiejohn, since four years in
comparison to the nineteen years be-
I fore he has gone to college, and the
I years afterwards when the boy will be
lin the same environment, are very
| small.
