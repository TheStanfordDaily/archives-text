# MARIONETTES WILL PERFORM TOMORROW IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
Two performances by Tony Sarg's
; marionettes will be given tomorrow at
I 3:30 and 8:15 p.m. in the Assembly
| hall, when the Chinese Willow Plate
[â€¢story is to be presented with musical
! accompaniment especially written and
I directed by Victor Herbert.
Something new in puppet perfor
| raances will be offered. Most of the
I figures are life size, although they
vary in different scenes from very
small characters to mammoth goldfish,
j The figures are of a transparent sub-
I stance, and their brilliantly-colored
| shadows are thrown on the screen
| from a lighting system behind, giving
the effect of animated church v/in
j dows.
Changing colored backgrounds for
I the brilliant figures are provided by
I
j Sarg's novel lighting apparatus, the
j details of which he has kept a secret.
| The puppets are worked from below
| in some of the scenes, instead of from
| above, as most marionettes are.
A Chinese mandarin stands before
J the curtain and adds comments and
explanations as the story progresses.
In one scene a real girl dances with
the puppets, dressed in the fantastic
Oriental costume which gives much
the same effect as the puppet figures.
Many original ideas have been worked
out by the author in this performance,
which -critics pronounce even better
than Rip Van Winkle, Don Quixote,
or any of his other productions.
Tickets for the performance are on
sale in the Administration building
and at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
