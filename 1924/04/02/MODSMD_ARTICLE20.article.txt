# Stanford Week
## 
### 
Varsity and freshman baseball teams, the varsity track squad, varsity
fencers, and the Stanford Glee Club combined to paint southern California
a brilliant reel last week.
"Dink" Templeton's powerful track team treated the U. S. C. squad
to a fine lacing, thereby proving itself to be the most formidable aggrega
tion on the Pacific Coast. Although the varsity baseball team did not fare
so well, Coach Wolter's men gave the Trojans two hard games and proved
that the Bruins would not have any set-up in the annual series.
The freshman nine did not venture so far away from home, but it
made an admirable showing against some of the best high school teams in
the state, winning every game. The yearlings had to go through two extra
inning contests. The fencers, pitted against strong competition in the Los
Angeles Athletic Club, lost, but succeeded in making a good showing.
Continuing the high class of entertainment it introduced this year at
the campus concert, the Stanford Glee Club scored a series of triumphs in
its six concerts at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The club also
aided in the presentation of the Alumni Stadium trophy to the Bakersfield
high school football team.
Stanford alumni in the southern part of the state had every reason to
be proud of their Alma Mater. They turned out in large numbers to sup
port the Cardinal athletic teams and did a great deal to make the stay of
the glee club a pleasant one.
In turn, Stanford has every reason to be proud of her alumni. -They
are a fine bunch, ready and willing to co-operate at any time.
