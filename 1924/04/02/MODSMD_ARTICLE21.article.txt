# The 						Spring Quarter
## 
### 
Few Stanford men and women leave the Farm without pleasaTit mem
ories of the Spring Quarter. Perfect weather, an abundance of social
activity, and plenty of athletic contests, make the last quarter one long to
he remembered.
It is very easy, with so many other things claiming attention, for stu
dents to let their studies slide. After all, the real job that most people
come to college to accomplish, is concerned with classroom work rather
than outside activity.
With this in mind, a little care at the beginning of the Spring Quarter
always pays. It is much easier to enjoy the Big Meet and Junior Week
with no scholastic worries to bother about.
