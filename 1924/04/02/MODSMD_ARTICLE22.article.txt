# Sarg's Marionettes
## 
### 
The Chinese Willow Plate story, to be presenetd by Tony Sarg's mar
ionettes, in the Assembly Hall Thursday afternoon and evening, typifies
the kind of clean and wholesome entertainment which appeals to the col
lege student.
Sarg's puppets are famed all over the United States and they will un
doubtedly have a large and appreciative audience in both performances
here. Their kind of humor and pathos is such that it appeals to almost
everyone.
Not the least attractive feature of the entertainment is the reasonable
schedule of prices which has been announced.
