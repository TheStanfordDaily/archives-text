# Scholarship and Publicity
## 
### 
Probably the best publicity that Stanford has gained in some time arose
out of the excellent scholastic records made by athletes last quarter.
No college team can be strong if the scholarship of its members keeps
them in danger of flunking out. The men who are keeping Stanford on
the map in athletics and at the same time making enviable records in their
classroom work are great assets to the university.
They are real Stanford men.

The stadium turf will feel mighty good under foot on April 26
