# SPORTS OF 1924
## THREE IRON MEN 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The three H's shown above, Hills, Hartranft, and Houser, are all quite
capable of taking care of Uncle Sam's affairs in the shot-put at the next
Olympic games. In 1920, Porhola of Finland won that event with a put of
4S ft. 7 J 4 ins. Hartranft and Houser were unknown then. Now the three must
be included in any list of the five best weight men in this country today, and
each, when at his best, is capable of giving Porhola the stiffest kind of
competition.
Hartranft is one of the three men in the world to put the IG-lb. shot over
50 tt. 1 his he did in 11)22 and reached 49 ft. or more on foTir other occasions.
Houser, national champion in 1921 when only 18 years old, has put over 48 ft.;
and Hi'ls established a new world's record in 1923 with a heave of 48 ft.
9 inches.
