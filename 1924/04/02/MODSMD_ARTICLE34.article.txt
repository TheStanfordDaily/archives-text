# BABE TRACKSTERS MEET PENINSULA LEAGUE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Showing marked improvement over J
first season prospects, Coach "Dink" j
Templeton's freshman track squad
will clash with the Peninsula Athletic
League Saturday afternoon 011 the
varsity oval.
Yearling stock rated low 011 the i
Farm for the few weeks preceding and
following the first informal babe meet,
but in the last two engagements with
prep squads, the freshmen have come
through for easy victories.
Next Game Is With Bruin Cubs
The P. A. L. clash will be the last
test administered to the freshman
tracksters before they come against
the Blue and Gold aggregation April
12 at Berkeley.
With the opening of the spring
squarter, one strong link was added
to the squad in the person of Tom
Work, versatile high-jumper and an
artist who has a hobby of collecting
first places in this event. Work left
school at the end of the fall quarter
and his re-entry will materially
strengthen the Card team. He con
sistently jumps near the 6-foot mark.
Hoffman Ties Discus Record
Hoffman proved the surprise of the
Oakland-Berkeley high school meet on
March 22 when he tossed the discus
137 feet 4 inches, tying the California-
Stanford record made last year in the
i Big Meet by Neufeld of California.
I Hoffman is also putting the 12-pound
i shot consistently around 50 feet.
Templeton has been using Spencer
in both the low sticks and 440, Spencer
furthermore showing his mettle by
turning in 0:53 2-10 for the quarter in
i the Bay Schools meet.
I West is "Dink's" only three-event
I man. The 120-yard hurdles is his fa-
I vorite entry but he is coming along
' close to Richmann in the high jump
| and to Meeks in the broad.
