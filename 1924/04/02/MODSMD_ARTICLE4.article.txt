# OLD BOY YELLS FOR LAST GOB OF COPY FROM CAMPUS WITS
## 
### 
Two more days, and Chappie takes
his silver girdled hammer, his non
combustible coffin, and his cracked
mirror into battle to retain the na
tional championship won for Stanford
last year in Judge's College Wits' Con
test. Two more days, and, in answer
to Judge's telegram of inquiry—"How
much can we expect from your con
tributors this year?"—the Old Boy
shouts back his answer, embodied in
a package containing Stanford's bid
for the trophy. The Foolish One is
tuning up his larnyx with one last loud
bellow for copy from contributors of
the brush and Underwood. Six o'clock
in the evening of the fourth of April
sounds the final gong.
