# BOXING TRIALS FOR OLYMPIC GAMES ARE IN APRIL
## Amateurs in Good Standing With P. A. A. May Enter; Winners Go East 
### 
Olympic Games boxing tryouts for
northern California will be held at
Stanford April 24 and 25, according
to arrangements completed with the
P. A. A. yesterday. These bouts will
be run off in Encina gym in the eve
ning and the winners will be sent di
rectly to Boston for further competi
tion.
All amateurs in good standing in the
P. A. A. are eligible to take part in
these preliminary matches. Letters
containing entry blanks will be sent
out by Harry Maloneyr chairman of
the Northern California Olympic
Games boxing tryouts committee, in
the near future. All men desiring to
enter must file one of the blanks with
Maloney and show a P. A. A. card.
Maloney, who is vice-president of
the P. A. A., was placed in charge of
tryouts by that body. Through his ef
forts Stanford received the bid for the
boxing contests over the Olympic Club
of San Francisco which was awarded
the wrestling competition. The bouts
will be run off under the auspices of
the Stanford Board of Athletic Con
trol.
All club and university teams in the
northern part of the state expect to
send men for these events, according
to letters received by Maloney to date.
University of California, Davis Farm,
Sacramento Athletic Club, Olympic
Club of San Francisco, Italia Virtus,
and Unione Sportiva will make entries.
Possibly men will be sent down from
the Presidio in San Francisco and from
Mare Island. Unattached men in good
standing will very likely also take
part.
The winners of the final bouts in
the northern tryouts will be sent di
rectly to Boston to take part in the
final Olympic Games tryouts there on
May 19, 20, and 21.
The rules of the International Ama
teur Boxing Federation will be used.
Eight-ounce gloves are required. No
overweight will be allowed. The first
two rounds of the bouts will be of
three minutes each, and the third
round will last four minutes. In case
of a tie, the referee can call for two
more two-minute rounds on which he
alone will judge the winner.
Eight different weights will be used.
They are: Flyweight—ll2 pounds;
bantamweight—llB pounds; feather
weight—l2(s pounds; lightweight—l3s
pounds; welterweight—l 47 pounds;
middleweight—loo pounds; light
heavyweight—l7s pounds; and heavy
weight—over 175 pounds.
The rules for "attack" are that
marks will be given for direct clean
hits with the knuckle part of the
closed glove of either hand on any
part of the front or side of the head
or the body above the belt. Points will
be given for "defense" for guarding,
slipping, ducking, counter-hitting, or
getting away. In case the two men are
equal according to this point system,
the aggressor will be given the deci
sion.
No man will be forced to fight more
than two fights in one evening, but the
winners will probably be required to
engage in two matches in one night.
This is less than the number required
in some of the New York boxing try
outs where contestants are sometimes
made to participate in a smany as four
bouts in one evening.
