# EIGHTY ASPIRANTS REPORT FOR FIRST SPRING WORK-OUT
## Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill Put Players Through Light Practice 
### Walter Campbell 
With a facial expression that be
spoke optimism, Coach "Fop" Warner
met his 1925 varsity football aspirants
for the initial practice of the spring
training season yesterday afternoon.
More than 80 candidates went
through their paces under the watch
ful eyes of Warner and his assistants.
The workout was comparatively
light, with 110 scrimmage or contact
tackling work. Handling the ball fig
ured strongly in the practice, in order
to accustom the men to the feel of the
leather spheroid. The linemen spent
part of their time in man-handling two
of the dummies under the direction of
"Tiny" Thornliill.
Work for the backfield men consist
ed largely in practicing starts, and in
throwing and receiving passes. Tack
ling and blocking 011 the dummies,
followed by a turn at the buckinc
machine comprised the dish served
the line aspirants.
Veterans Are Absent
Veterans of last season's varsity
wei-e. noticeable for their absence.
Thomas, end; Baker, center; and
Wheat, halfback, were the only regu
lars in togs. In addition to these three
were Stratton, fullback; Hunt, center;
Armour and Potts, linemen. Among
the freshmen were Swan, Bogue, Nat
cher. and Trombetta.
Most of the regular varsity men are
tied up in current major sports for
the present. In baseball are Captain
Lawson, Johnston, Cuddeback, Nevers,
Solomon, and McDermont. On the
track varsity is Dennis. Norman
Cleaveland and Hyland, a possibility
from the frosh team, are with the
American rugby team, 011 their way
to Paris'to take part in the Olympics.
These men, with the exception of the
last two named, should be in suits'
within the next few weeks. There are'
several more varsity men who will i
report during the next few days.
Practice to Last Five Weeks
The spring practice period, under j
the schedule used by Warner and J
Kerr, will call for about live weeks of
training. The work will probably not
be intensive, since it is more of a I
general conditioning period and an op
portunity to get a slant on new ma- i
terial than anything else, in this way.
the coaches will keep in touch with
any new men who show promise and i
will continue the development of the j
older players. The spring period is j
also highly useful for eradicating any !
basic faults or difficulties the candi
dates may be showing.
