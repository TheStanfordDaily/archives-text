# Scientist Seeks Improvement Of Existing Deciduous Fruits
## 
### Alfred Post 
Improvement of existing varieties of
deciduous fruits is the object of ex
periments being conducted on the cam
pus by W. F. Wight of the United j
States Department of Agriculture. I
The University furnished the de
partment with twenty acres back of
Dr. Jordan's home, of which about five
acres have been planted to different
species of peaches, prunes, apricots,,
pears, and persimmons.
Except in the Santa Clara valley and
a faw other favored districts, pears
are afflicted with a disease known as
fire blight. Wight's aim is to get a
tree resistant to this disease and at
the same time of good commercial
quality. The Bartlett and the Bosc, the
two varieties of greatest commercial
value at present, are both susceptible J
to the blight.
A Chinese pear which is resistant to
the disease and is of fair commercial
quality, has been crossed with the
Bartlett and the Harwell and others of
similar excellence. These hybrids are
not yet of bearing age, but the scien-1

tftft has hopes that from them one or
two varieties which meet the require
ment will be developed.
Brown Rot Hinders Plums
European types of plums cannot be
grown in the southern states because
of the prevalence of a form of brown
rot. The only species raised success
fully are native plums or hybrids
formed from crossing the native fruit
with Old World trees.
Wight has experienced perhaps his
greatest difficulty in his experiments
with the apricots, as few varieties can
be crossed with it which will produce
a fruit of apricot character. Two
genera of slight, value for this purpose
are primus desyearpa and primus bri
gantiaca. Seeds of the latter have been
introduced here from northern Italy
and it is hoped they will germinate
this spring.
Importation of seeds from Asia
Minor is considered the surest method
to obtain strains more resistant to the
brown rot. Apricots which would ripen
later than the Blenheim are also i
sought, as the canners have a slack
period between the last of that variety
and the earliest of the peaches.
Standard Peaches Sought
The goal in peach experimentation
is to obtain types nearly identical in
quality and which ripen in succession,
thus enabling the canners to handle
them more easily. The ideal peach
must be yellow to the pit, fairly sweet,
resistant to mildew, and with a pit
which will not split. It must be firm
enough to ship well to eastern mar
kets.
No matter how perfect the specimen
is in other respects it is of no com
mercial value unless borne on a tree
which is a good grower with sturdy
branches. Peach raisers have suffered
considerable losses, too, from having
otherwise satisfactory fruit drop off
the branches before it is fully ripened.
Persimmons Peculiar Fruit
Persimmons are in some respects
the most peculiar fruit grown in Cali
fornia. They are divided into astrin
gent varieties. In order to be edible
the former type must be ripened until
it becomes mushy, while the latter is
fit to eat when it is fairly firm.
The tree is unique in that some
varieties will bear fruit whether they
are pollinated or not. Types ordinarily
non-astringent are astringent when
not pollinated. Wight made a state
wide trip three years ago to collect
speciments of both classes, and se
cured 235 samples including 60 varie
ties. He planted seeds from these in
hopes of securing good pollen-produc
ing types.
Astringent species are most fre
quently marketed because of their
more handsome appearance. They are
picked for shipping while firm, and
consumers eat them in that condition
and are displeased, not understanding
that they must be mushy before be
coming ready to eat.
