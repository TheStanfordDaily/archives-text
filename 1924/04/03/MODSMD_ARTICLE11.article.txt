# Scientist Seeks Improvement Of Existing Deciduous Fruits

### Alfred Post 
Improvement of existing varieties of
deciduous fruits is the object of ex
periments being conducted on the cam
pus by W. F. Wight of the United j
States Department of Agriculture. I
The University furnished the de
partment with twenty acres back of
Dr. Jordan's home, of which about five
acres have been planted to different
species of peaches, prunes, apricots,,
pears, and persimmons.
Except in the Santa Clara valley and
a faw other favored districts, pears
are afflicted with a disease known as
fire blight. Wight's aim is to get a
tree resistant to this disease and at
the same time of good commercial
quality. The Bartlett and the Bosc, the
two varieties of greatest commercial
value at present, are both susceptible J
to the blight.
A Chinese pear which is resistant to
the disease and is of fair commercial
quality, has been crossed with the
Bartlett and the Harwell and others of
similar excellence. These hybrids are
not yet of bearing age, but the scien-1

tftft has hopes that from them one or
two varieties which meet the require
ment will be developed.
Brown Rot Hinders Plums
European types of plums cannot be
grown in the southern states because
of the prevalence of a form of brown
rot. The only species raised success
fully are native plums or hybrids
formed from crossing the native fruit
with Old World trees.
Wight has experienced perhaps his
greatest difficulty in his experiments
with the apricots, as few varieties can
be crossed with it which will produce
a fruit of apricot character. Two
genera of slight, value for this purpose
are primus desyearpa and primus bri
gantiaca. Seeds of the latter have been
introduced here from northern Italy
and it is hoped they will germinate
this spring.
Importation of seeds from Asia
Minor is considered the surest method
to obtain strains more resistant to the
brown rot. Apricots which would ripen
later than the Blenheim are also i
