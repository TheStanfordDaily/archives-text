# VARSITY DIAMOND SQUAD DOWNS ST. MARY'S TEAM, 1-0
## Cards Score Only Tally in Second Inning Rally; Nevers Stars 
### 
After the smoke from a few near
riots had cleared away yesterday, the
Stanford ball club was discovered to
be just one run ahead of "Slip" Madi
gan's St. Mary's nine.
The Cards got the only run of the
game in the second inning when Mr-
Candless doubled down the third base
line and scored on "Lefty" May's hot
single over second.
Both teams threatened for the next
six stanzas but neither could push a
run over second.
Cards Weather Crisis
The big uproar came In the ninth
when Carrington, the second man up
for the visitors, lined a hit into right
for two bases. The ball rolled to the
fence, McCandless recovering and
throwing to Roberts on second. Car
rington was well on his way to third
and arrived there about the same time
Roberts' peg to Cuddeback reached
the bag. Hob Vallou took a hasty um
pire's look and called the St. Mary's
man out. It was a close play but
Madigan and his team didn't agree
with Vallou. For a moment it looked
like war, but thr> umpire couldn't be
argued with so the game went on.
"Slip" was made, the Saints weren't
any too well pleased, and Vallou was
scared to death.
Painter brushed a fast single
through first that would have scored
a runner from third, which made the
decision seem even worse to the visi
tors. Gardner popped to Cuddeback
for the third out, and the battle was
over.
Varsity Stronger
The Stanford team looked better
yesterday than it has since early in
the season. The sluggers gathered ten
hits behind Nevers and fielded smooth
ly. Had it not been for poor base run
ning«in the second inning, at least one
and perhaps two more runs would
have been added to the total, but that
was the only flaw in an otherwise
faultless exhibition.
Captain Woodward performed in
Mulcliay's place at short and made a
good job of it. Mulchay is out for a
time with eye trouble.
Ernie Nevers pitched a pretty game
yesterday and was never in trouble.

In closing, Professor Taylor sums
up hi,s tentative college as follows:
"A college free to pursue its mission
as the maker of men and enlightener
of mankind, with unobscured of
the truth, and power to proclaim the
truth without fear or favor of poli
ticians, or religious sects, or benefac
tors, or public cries, or its own- ad
ministrative machinery."
