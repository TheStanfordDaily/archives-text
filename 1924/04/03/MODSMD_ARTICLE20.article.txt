# Sportsmanship?

Sportsmanship in a college, and in teams representing that college, can
I>e one of two things—present or absent. In the present high stage of civ
ilization it is hardly noticeable when present, but its absence makes it stick
out like a flagpole.
"Come in with your spikes in the air" said the visiting baseball coach
yesterday, after his catcher, who was blocking the baseline, was knocked
on his most convenient ear by a sliding Stanford baserunner. It hap
pened that this choice bit of advice was well followed out, as the visitors
were l>eing stood on their heads most of the afternoon.
Absolutely without exception, the most impressive thing about this vis
iting team is its entire lack of sustained clean playing. The first bit of
adverse fortune always changes blatant cockiness into vindictive, malic
ious muckerism. This is not the first time, nor the second, nor the fifteenth
-—its merely happened once more, A scrappy, up-and-coming baseball
team is the finest thing in the world, but a crew of crooked spike-wavers
is something else again. John McGraw is noted for the crabbiness of his
teams, but the Giant skipper never hopped out *>f his dugout before an
audience and directed a comprehensive catalogue of enthusiastic blasphemy
at an astonished umpire. Neither does he direct his team to spike the op
position intentionally. Fortunately these players were of a rather higher
caliber than their coach, and failed to so much as put out the eye of an in
tielder. This may be insubordination, but it is encouraging.
This coach has been visiting the campus for some time, and rather less
is thought of him after each exhibition. When he learns to play the game
as it should be played, taking his misfortunes like a man, athletics at his
institution may assume their ideal function of making better men out of the
athletes.
