# An Opportunity for Freshmen
## 
### 
Next Monday the freshmen and to some extent the underclassmen will
be given an opportunity to try out for editorial positions on the staff of
the Daily Palo Alto.
Journalism is probably one of the most complete activities on the cam
pus. Making, to some extent, the same demands that will be encountered
after graduation, and operating under a rigid schedule admitting no inde
cision or delay, the Daily affords valuable training in the art of coming
through in a pinch—or out of a pinch, for that matter. Starting as a cub
reporter, the Daily tryoutee has an absolutely clear field in developing
further his common sense, perspective, executive ability, and personality.
The first advancement—to desk assistant—usually comes early, and
from that point on the work is to some extent managerial as well as lit
erary. The next promotion is to news editor and department head, a posi
tion demanding to a large degree an understanding of the vital points of
newspaper construction, and the ability to direct the work of others. The
responsibilities connected with this job are correspondingly increased with
each further promotion.
A couple of years on any good college newspaper will leave anyone
with a clear idea of journalistic fundamentals, a keener and more analytical
mind, and better judgment. Invaluable habits of punctuality and relia
bility are essential to a successful college journalist. Finally, the Daily
Palo Alto is the best medium for keeping in close touch with every aspect
of campus life.
Men and women both will be eligible to try out, and prospects are
especially bright for members of the class of 1927.
