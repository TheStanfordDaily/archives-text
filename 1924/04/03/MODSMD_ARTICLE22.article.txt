# Tennis Squads Prepare For California Matches
## 
### 
With only one week to go before the
freshman tennis matches with Cali
fornia and two weeks before the var
sity match, "Hal" Davis plans to put
the players through some intensive
practice.
The method of selecting the team
has been changed from that used last
quarter. Instead of holding ranking
matches in which the whole squad par
ticipates, each man playing the next
above and below him, Davis will take
the best six or seven men from both
the varsity and freshman squads and
have them play among themselves.
Each man will have an opportunity to
play any other man regardless of his
numerical ranking.
Davis will also try out different com
binations of doubles and get the pairs,
who work best together, used to play

ing with each other,
Both matches will be played at
Berkeley this year as both were held
here last year. The freshman event
comes on April 12 and the varsity on
April 19. The freshmen play their last
preliminary match of the season with
Oakland high next Saturday on the
varsity courts.
