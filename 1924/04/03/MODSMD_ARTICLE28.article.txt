## OLYMPIC STARS OF OTHER YEARS 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Melvin Sheppard was the outstanding star of the 190S Olympic games at
London. He won the 800 metres run in 1 min. 52 4-5 sees., the 1500 metres in
4 min. 3 2-5 sees, (both new Olympic records) and he was also a member of
the winning U. S. relay t-earn. 11*4 points for Uncle Sam won by this
remarkable athlete!
At Stockholm in 1912 "Shep" was again a member of the team, and although
he eclipsed his record performance of four years before, he only placed second
in the 800 metres and sixth in the 1500 metres!
Melvin Sheppard still holds the records for 700, 800, and 900 yards, and his
name may be found in the books as National half mile champion for the years
1906, 1907, 1908, 1911, and 1912. He was one of the greatest middle distance
runners of all time.
