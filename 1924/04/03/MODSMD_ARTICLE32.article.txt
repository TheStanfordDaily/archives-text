# CALIFORNIA DIAMOND TEAMS LEAD IN WINS OVER CARD SQUADS
## Bears Are Victors in Nineteen Of Thirty-One Yearly Baseball Contests 
### 
An earthquake won one Stanford-
California baseball series. California
has come out on top nineteen times,
and Stanford has been tlve victor in
twelve of the annual battles.
Only one man has coached baseball
for more than two successive years on
the Farm.
These are just a few of the inter
esting facts brought to light by a
study of the thirty-two years of base
ball relations between Stanford and
California.
After the Cards and Bears had each
taken a game in the 1906 series, the
earthquake stepped in and declared
the struggle a tie.
Bears Hold Lead in Games
California also holds the lead in in
dividual games won, with a total of
forty-six. Stanford claims thirty-seven
victories over the Blue and Gold.
The task of turning out Stanford
ball teams seems to be particularly
hard 011 coaches. From 1892 through
1896 the Cardinals played without the
guiding hand of a mentor and won
five straight, series.
Since that time but one man, G. J.
Presley, who headed the 1908, '09, and
'10 varsities, has remained as baseball
coach more than two straight years.
Wolter Coached Nine in 1916
Harry Wolter, the present varsity
coach, took over the 1916 team and
lost a hard-fought series to California.
Wolter went on a six-year vacation
and returned to the campus in 1923.
Faced with a crew of inexperienced
players, he devoted most of his time
to building up a team. The 1924 squad
is proof that he builded well.
Two men, H. H. Lougheed, '00, and
Z. A. Terry, '14, have held the posi
tions of captain for two years. Lough
eed was head of the 1898 club and
was re-elected the next year after the
death of Captain G. M. Beckett.
Terry was varsity captain in 1913
and 1914.
California, after losing three straight
years to Stanford, started on a win
ning streak in 1920 and has won four
series from the Cards.

Harry Wolter, the present varsity
coach, took over the 1916 team and
lost a hard-fought series to California.
Wolter went on a six-year vacation
and returned to the campus in 1923.
Faced with a crew of inexperienced
players, he devoted most of his time
to building up a team. The 1924 squad
is proof that he builded well.
Two men, H. H. Lougheed, '00, and
Z. A. Terry, '14, have held the posi
tions of captain for two years. Lough

death of Captain G. M. Beckett.
Terry was varsity captain in 1913
and 1914.
California, after losing three straight
years to Stanford, started on a win
ning streak in 1920 and has won four
series from the Cards.
