# ESTABLISHMENT OF IDEAL UNIVERSITY BEING CONSIDERED
## Student Choice of Curriculum And Faculty; Endorsed by Leading Educators 
### 
Of interest to every college student
is the recent proposal for an entirely
new type of college, as advanced by
Professor Alva Park Taylor, acting
Dean of General Science at the New
Mexico College of A. and M. A. State
College, New Mexico. The plan has
been favorably commented upon by
several of the leading educators of
the country, and is now presented to
the students.
The Plan in Brief
In the first place, the scheme calls
for a student-body of only three hun
dred students. These students will be
carefully chosen on the basis of their
physical and mental superiority, inter
est in learning and capacity for leader
ship. In New College, it is planned
that they will be trained for intelli
gent living in the world and for leader
ship in the new rennaissance by in
tense study, association with like
minded companions and teachers, con
ference with leaders, and the general
spirit of the place.
The second feature is found in the
faculty, which is to be the finest ob
tainable. The teachers will be se
lected by their colleagues and the
upper-classmen at the school for their
intellectuality and liberality of out
look. They will enjoy absolute aca
demic freedom. Their tenure of office
will be subject wholly to public opin
ion within the college community.
Such conditions together with the
salary to be offered —four or five thou
sand dollars —and the unique oppor
tunity which the experiment will af
ford, is expected to attract a faculty
of very superior calibre.
Liberal Curriculum
The course of study in detail is to
be worked out by the faculty and the
advanced students of the institution.
Every effort will be made to adopt the
course of study to the present social
needs and to make the instruction
genuinely vital.
In regard to extra-curiculum activi
ties, the students will be expected to
develop their own outside interests at
New College. Learning is to be the
principal "student activity." There
will be absolutely no inter-collegiate
athletics of any sort. Students will be
permitted to engage in intramural
sports, journalism, drama, self-help,
business, art, and so on, always re
membering that the college is to be
devoted primarily to the development
of intelectual leadership.
Such then is a brief outline of the
program. To carry this out, a tuition
fee of $250 will be charged, giving the
college an annual income of $75,000.
This fund would be thus distributed:
$55,000 for salaries, $10,000 for rent
and upkeep of quarters, $10,000 for
books and laboratory equipment each
year.
Buildings to Be Rented
The college as such will have no
dormitories and refectories, "fearing
to run the risk," as the author of the
plan explains, "of being confounded
with a boarding house, a country club,
or an amusement park." Houses may
be rented by the students and con
ducted co-operatively. For lecture
rooms and laboratories, the college
will rent adequate quarters. Proximity
to a large city—Chicago, New York, or
Washington—is to be desired, as it
will give access to libraries for re-
