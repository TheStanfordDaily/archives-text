# BIRDIES AND EAGLES SUFFER WHEN RUFFS GO OUT AFTER GOLF
## 
### 
If the Stanford Rough refuses to dec
orate his limbs in knee breeches, he at
least doesn't object to a little game of
golf once in a while. Every afternoon
and half the mornings scattered groups
of golf shooters can be seen out after
birdies and eagles on all parts of the
campus. Each house has its one or two
hole course out and back with the nine
teenth on some sorority front porch.
Encina, however, lays claim to the best
fairway on the Farm, thanks to the
R.O.T.C. When the polo ponies aren't
digging up the turf 011 the Encina field,
the pill chasers get in some good spring
plowing with the driver and midiron.
