# FRESHMAN NINE TO CLASH WITH LOWELL PREPS ON SATURDAY
## Vacation Tour Brings Out Added Strength of Card Babes 
### 
Freshman diamond artists will meet I
the strong Lowell high school nine at!
10 o'clock Saturday morning on the
yearling field. This is the last ot' the ;
scheduled preliminary games before;
the series with the California babes i
which will start the following Satur-!
day on the University of California !
field.
The Lowell aggregation has won a!
majority of its games this season and. j
according to all reports, play an air- j
tight game of ball. In a game with the j
California freshmen recently Lowell j
was only downed by a score of 7 to 5 j
after a desperate struggle. The high j
school team secured 8 hits to the 7 1
made by the Cubs and were beaten I
only because they were unable to
bunch their hits.
Collins Will Toss
Coach "Husky" Hunt will probably!
start Steve Collins in the box with |
Stewart on the receiving end. Hunter,
who is apparently a dark horse on the
squad, went into the box during the
last inning of the Dinuba game and
sent three Dinubans in a row to the j
dug-out. It is possible Hunt may give j
him another chance to show his wares 1
Saturday.
The freshmen have been slow round-,
ing into form, but their vacation tour,
has brought them to such a state of
perfection as gives rich expectations
for the series with the California
freshmen.
Hunt will start a line-up Saturday
very similar to the one he will lite
the following week against the Bear .
cubs.
