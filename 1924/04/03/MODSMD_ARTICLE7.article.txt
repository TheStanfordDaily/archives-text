# TONY SARG PUPPETS APPEAR TONIGHT IN PLAYLET
## Palo Alto Parents, Teachers Sponsor Production of Chinese Legend 
### 
The Chinese Willow Plate story,
showing Tony Sarg's puppets, is being
presented in the Assembly hall this
afternoon and at 8:15 this evening,
under the auspices of the Palo Alto
Union Parents-Teachers association.
All tickets for the evening perform
ance are reserved, and may be ob
tained at the Administration building,
or at Crandall's in Palo Alto.
New and ingenious lighting arrange
ments make it possible for the figures
to be presented in varying sizes in the
different scenes. The characters, which
are of a colored transparent substance,
perform behind a curtain, their bril
liant shadows being thrown 011 the
screen from behind. Elaborate experi
ments by the artist were necessary to
achieve the effect of moving figures on
a stained glass window.
The performance consists of ten
scenes, each shoWing some phase of
the ancient legend depicted on the
willow ware without which 110 house
hold collection of china is complete. A
Mandarin's beautiful daughter, accord
ing to the legend, fell in love with
her father's secretary. She was im- j
prisoned and her lover ordered to j
leave the country, but he fashioned a |
little boat out of a cocoanut shell and j
sent it down the canal to her garden
house one night with a message of i
love. She sent it back to him with ;
another message, telling him to come j
and take her away if lie loved her as
he declared.
While this was going on the Man
darin was making arrangements to!
marry his daughter to a Chinese no-!
bleman. The lover came in a Chinese !
junk one night and carried her off to
an island. They were discovered and j
sentenced to be beheaded, according I
to Chinese law, but were changed into I
doves, and flew off together, safe from
the wrath of the irate father.
Brilliant caravans, startling night
scenes, crimson sunsets, and bright
blue seas make gorgeous backgrounds
for the marionettes. Special musical i
numbers written by Victor Herbert J
are played by an orchestra trained I
under his direction. The Tony Sarg!
marionettes have appeared as part of !
concert performances with Galli Curci
and other famous artists.
