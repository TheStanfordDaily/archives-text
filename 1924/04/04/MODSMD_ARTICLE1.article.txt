# FROSH DISTANCE RUNNERS SCARCE FOR P. A. L. MEET
## Return of Work Strengthens High Jump and Hurdles; Hoffman Improving 
### 
Though weakened in the distances,
the Card babe tracksters should annex
a majority of the other first places
when they meet eight members of
the Peninsula Athletic League tomor
row on the varsity oval.
San Jose was doped to send the
strongest competition for the fresh
men but has lately withdrawn its en
tries. The schools that have signified
their intention of competing are: San
Franciscco Polytcehnic, Salinas, Santa
Cruz, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Se
quoia, William Warren, and Palo Alto.
Cummings in Three Runs
Unless Cummings does the "iron
man" trick for the Cards, their
chances for points in the mile and
two-mile are going to be given a boost
skyward by the P. A. L. entries. Cum
mings can turn in fairly creditable
time, around 2:08, in the half, with
Dekker and Truman close behind, but
if he extends himself in his first race,
the mile, which he will probably place
in, the 880 and two-mile will suffer
for lack of wind and other candidates.
Two events will benefit by the re
turn of Work to school —the high tim
ber and high jump. Six feet in the
latter is an every-dav performance for
him, while he can closely trail West in
the high hurdles.
West, by the way, may pull the
"Cliff Argue" stunt and try for points
in four events. He is a sure first in
the high hurdles with his frequent
times of 1(5 flat; if Meeks' bad ankle is
still troubling him he may repeat in
the broad jump; second or third are
possibilities in the high jump; and it
is probable that Coach Templeton may
use him as a running mate for Spen
cer in the low sticks.
Spencer to Run Quarter
Spencer is being groomed for the
400-meter hurdles and will attempt a
win in the quarter-mile as a side-dish
to his low hurdle race.
So far Templeton has unearthed no
brilliant performers with the pole but
it is hoped that Knight Templeton and
Williams will boost their 10-foot aver
ages to the vicinity of 11 feet.
Hoffman in practice is still hovering
close to his record toss with the dis
cus of 137 feet 4 inches against the
Bay schools last quarter. Tomorrow
may see the mark boosted some and
the yearlings' attempts will be watched
with interest.
Anderson surprised himself and his
fellow-tosser, Shipkey, when he pro
ceeded to throw the javelin yesterday
for IG3 feet. Shipkey has been making
close to that mark and with Ander
son's late improvement the babes will
probably cop a first and second.

row on the varsity oval.
San Jose was doped to send the
strongest competition for the fresh
men but has lately withdrawn its en
tries. The schools that have signified
their intention of competing are: San
Franciscco Polytcehnic, Salinas, Santa
Cruz, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Se
quoia, William Warren, and Palo Alto.
Cummings in Three Runs
Unless Cummings does the "iron
man" trick for the Cards, their
chances for points in the mile and
two-mile are going to be given a boost
skyward by the P. A. L. entries. Cum
mings can turn in fairly creditable
time, around 2:08, in the half, with
Dekker and Truman close behind, but
if he extends himself in his first race,
the mile, which he will probably place
in, the 880 and two-mile will suffer
for lack of wind and other candidates.
Two events will benefit by the re
turn of Work to school —the high tim
ber and high jump. Six feet in the
latter is an every-dav performance for
him, while he can closely trail West in
the high hurdles.
West, by the way, may pull the
"Cliff Argue" stunt and try for points
in four events. He is a sure first in
the high hurdles with his frequent
times of 1(5 flat; if Meeks' bad ankle is
still troubling him he may repeat in
the broad jump; second or third are
possibilities in the high jump; and it
is probable that Coach Templeton may
use him as a running mate for Spen
cer in the low sticks.
Spencer to Run Quarter
Spencer is being groomed for the
400-meter hurdles and will attempt a
win in the quarter-mile as a side-dish
to his low hurdle race.
So far Templeton has unearthed no
brilliant performers with the pole but
it is hoped that Knight Templeton and
Williams will boost their 10-foot aver
ages to the vicinity of 11 feet.
Hoffman in practice is still hovering
close to his record toss with the dis
cus of 137 feet 4 inches against the
Bay schools last quarter. Tomorrow
may see the mark boosted some and
the yearlings' attempts will be watched
with interest.
Anderson surprised himself and his
fellow-tosser, Shipkey, when he pro
ceeded to throw the javelin yesterday
for IG3 feet. Shipkey has been making
close to that mark and with Ander
son's late improvement the babes will
probably cop a first and second.
Though weakened in the distances,
the Card babe tracksters should annex
a majority of the other first places
when they meet eight members of
the Peninsula Athletic League tomor
row on the varsity oval.
