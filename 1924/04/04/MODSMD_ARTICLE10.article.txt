# VARSITY LETTER MEN REPORT FOR SPRING PRACTICE
## Six Block "S" Winners and Eleven Freshman Grid Players Get Suits 
### 
With close to 100 men reporting for
the second night of practice. Coaches
Warner, Kerr, Thornhill, and Hunt
continued the spring training period
which was started Wednesday.
The work yesterday afternoon was
of a vigorous character, in order to get
the men into condition as rapidly as
possible. To the spectator, it appeared
that the coaches were laboring every
bit as hard as the men.
Drill in Fundamentals
After a brief setting-up exercise,
Warner separated the linemen and
backfield candidates, and began the
drilling of fundamentals. The linemen
practiced the hard, low charging which
is a marked feature of all teams with
which "Tiny" Thornhill is connected.
Following this, they indulged in phan
tom blocking, and then practiced tack
ling on their fellow gridders. Â«.
Backfield Men Work
The backfield aspirants followed
substantially the same program as on
the first afternoon, starting with the
ball, and passing.
At present, over 120 men have drawn
suits for the spring training period. Of
these, seventeen are members of last
year's varsity squad. Six of these,
Mitchell, Hunt, Dwight, Baker, Thom
as, and Wheat, are varsity letter
men.
Freshman Stars Out
Last season's freshman outfit is re
presented by eighteen players, eleven
of which are numeral' wearers. Among
these are Price, Trombetta, Bogue,
Baldwin, Phillips, Greisser, Post,
Moore, Mann, Natcher, and Captain
Swan. At least two of these men, Swan
and Bogue, are bound to make varsity
men hustle in order to hold their jobs.
Swan, former Olympic Club player,
is one of the most promising players
reporting for practice, and should
make a mighty good end for the var
sity. The other freshman player,
Bogue, was handicapped through last
season by a bad knee. But in spite of
his injury, he was good enough to
make the two touchdowns against the
California first year men. His work
on the practice field shows him to be
a fullback of speed and power, al
though not yet in a class with Nevers
or Solomon.
