# W. A. A. BOARD PLANS CONFERENCE AT U. C.
## 
### 
Plans for the Athletic Conference of
American College Women, to be held at
California April 10 to 12, occupied the
major part of the VV. A. A. board meet
ing yesterday.
The California conference is similar
to the one which met here last spring,
except that it is national instead of sec
tional. It convenes every three years.
Stanford wishes to be well represented,
so any woman who is particularly inter
ested in attending the conference is
asked to call Eunice Middle, Palo Alto
1030, for further information. Trans
portation will be the only expense for
those who go to California.
Eunice Biddle, president of W. A. A.,
is the official delegate, and will speak on
"Varsity Competition." Margaret Wat
sod, secretary, will present "Standard
ization of Swimming Events." decided
upon at the western conference here last
year. If these suggestions are found
acceptable, they will go into effect
nationally.
