# SOUTHERN CINDER TEAMS MEET VARSITY NEXT WEEK
## 
### Wallace Knox 
Southern California's small colleges
will send a strong track team to Stan
ford to meet the Card varsity a week
from tomorrow.
Last year, the southern colleges
completely upset the dope and handed
the Cards a 74 to 66 drubbing. The
personnel of the southern team will
not be determined until tomorrow,
when the six schools in the confer
ence, Pomona, Occidental, Southern
Branch, Redlands, Whittier, and Cali
fornia Tech, meet in their annual con
ference meet. The outstanding per
formers in this meet will be chosen to
represent their conference against
Coach "Dink" Templeton's hopes.
While a number of the men who
participated in Stanford's 74 to 66 de
feat are no longer in college competi
tion, the southern schools still have
some potential athletes.
Argue Is 9 4-5 Man
Argue of Occidental is perhaps the
most outstanding man in the South.

He sprints, high jumps, broad jumps,
and then, if he isn't tired, tosses the
weights around. In the last two meets
in which he has taken part he ran
the century in 0:09 4-5. Last Year lan
Campbell beat him in both short races,
but from the marks that he has been
chalking up so far this season, he is
likely to give Campbell and Marshal
Hale some stiff opposition.
He defeated Templetorfs jumpers
last year when he cfeared the bar at
6 feet. He will probably be entered in
this event, again next week.
Maxwell of Pomona is considered by
some to be the best hurdler on the
Coast. His time for the high sticks is
around 0:15 1-5, while he can cover
the lows in 0:23 8-10. He and "Swede"
Leistner should put on a couple of
pretty races.
Good Broad Jumper
Frisby, who also hails from Pomona,
is a 23-foot man in the broad jump.
He beat Lou Minsky in this event last
