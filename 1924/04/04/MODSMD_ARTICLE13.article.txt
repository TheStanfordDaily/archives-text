Shovel the moth balls out of the way
and dig tip the old decorated khaki from
the bottom of the trunk; the Military
Ball is on tonight. Cadets of the R. O.

explosion and lots of recoil, so they
are starting the quarter off with a for

nations. This array was obtained from
the Presidio, where it was previously
used to decorate one of the army balls.
