# FRESHMEN PREPARED FOR LOWELL NINE TOMORROW MORNING
## Preliminary Schedule Ends With Babes Ready For Bear Cub Series 
### 
Freshman diamond artists are ready
with a smooth-going, hard-hitting ma
chine to overwhelm the Lowell high
school nine tomorrow morning in the
final game of the preliminary sche
dule. The visitors will come to the
campus in a cloud of past glories
which the freshmen are determined
to change into a cloud of dust.
After sending two freshman teams
to a victory over their cub rivals,
Coach "Husky" Hunt is preparing his
diamond squad for another pennant,
With one of the strongest yearling
nines that has played in Cardinal col
ors for s-everal years, it appears that
Hunt will complete his schedule with
victories. In the game tomorrow he
will give the babes their final test
before the Little-Big series.
Four Pitchers Ready
Hunt, has four good pitchers for
mound work and three first-class
catchers. Just what combination he
will use against the prep school ag
gregation has not been decided, but
it seems to be quite certain that it
will keep the Lowell nine on its toes
to score.
Steve Collins appears to be the best
twirler on the squad, and since he has
been used more than any other pitcher
during the season it is likely that he
will start the game tomorrow if Hunt
has any apprehension of a defeat from
this San Francisco school.
This game will give a definite clue
to the relative strength of the Stan
ford frosh and their cub playmates
across the hay, as Lowell was beaten
7 to 5 by the California freshmen r%
cently in a hard-fought contest. Lowell
made one more hit than the cubs, but
was beaten because of its inability
to bunch safe cracks.
Hitting is one of the strong points
of the Cardinal youngsters anjl when
the Lowell mound-worker faces men
like Morrill, Lindquist, Southworth,
Riese, and Stewart, he will have to
show his stuff or incur the enmity
of his outfielders.
