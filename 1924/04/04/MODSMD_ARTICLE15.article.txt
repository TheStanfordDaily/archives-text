## 
### 
Overfelt, Mertz, Hinckley, Tussing,
and will make up this year's
tennis varsity, according ,to an an
nouncement by H. M. Davis, assistant
director of Encina gymnasium.
Unless something unexpected hap
pens, these men, who were chosen as
the result of the ranking tournament
held last quarter, will represent Stan
ford in the match with California on
April 1(9. They should be able to take
revenge for last year's defeat as four
of them are veterans of the 1923 var
sity and the fifth man, Harold Over
felt, is now the best player on the
squad.
Overfelt Shows Improvement
Overfelt, until recently, has been ail
obscure player. Within the last two
j months, however, he has worked his
way up from sixth place to the head
of the list, defeating Captain Mertz
and last year's captain, Dick Hinckley.
Both Mertz and Hinckley are playing
better tennis than last year and should
win their matches in the big meet.
Tussing and de√üack are consistently
i good players.
Both varsity and freshman matches
will be held at Berkeley this year
since they were played here in 1923.
