# D. P. A. EDITORIAL CANDIDATES WILL SIGN UP MONDAY
## Freshmen, Sophomores Will Have Preference in Six-Day Tryout 
### 
Candidates for editorial positions on
the staff or the Daily Palo Alto will
report on the second floor of the Press
building at 12:45, Monday, April 7,
for a six-day tryout. Underclassmen,
especially freshmen, who are inter
ested in journalism or literature of
any kind, will be given every oppor
tunity to make good. Both men and
women are invited to sign up.
During the trial period, which will
close Sunday, April 13, tryoutees will
be asked to submit one or two sample
news stories each day, on certain
designated subjects. They will also be
expected to turn in a news or feature
story every day, on a subject not in
cluded in the regular "beat." Stories
missed by regular reporters and
"scooped" by tryoutees will count
heavily toward election to - the staff.
Work of Tryoutees
This schedule is a bit heavier than
the work of the member after making
the staff, but only because it is de
sirable to have a quantity of sample
copy on which to pass judgment. It
also proves pretty conclusively wheth
er or not the prospective reporter can
stand the gaff. After election, the suc
cessful candidates will be broken in
on light beats, and given an oppor
tunity to learn the game thoroughly
Election will be made in considera
tion of three thingsâ€”initiative, as
judged by the quantity of copy turned
in and the number of unassigned
stories; ability, in regard to readable
style and proper use of correct Eng
lish grammar; and reliability, shown
by complete covering of beats and at
tendance at tryout meetings.
These meetings will be heM every
day next week, at 12:45 in the Press
building. They will be shorn and
snappy, and usually dismissed in time
for 1 o'clock classes. Any tryoutee un
able to report for one of these meet
ings must speak to the Editor. Manag
ing Editor, or Associate Editor in ad
vance. Excuses will be issued then, but
not later.
The primary function of the Daily
Palo Alto is to be as good a college
newspaper as possible, but there is a
great deal of pleasure connected with
staff membership. Life around the of
fice is congenial, and an organization
known as the "Afternoon Club" of
ficially handles the social activities of
ihe editorial staff, which usually cul
ruinate in a banquet held during the
latter part of the quarter.
