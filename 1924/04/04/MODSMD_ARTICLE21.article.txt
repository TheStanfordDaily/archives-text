Saturday night in the Assembly hall. Stanford students will have an
opportunity to support an entertainment put on for the benefit of the Boy
Scouts of Palo Alto, Stanford University, and May field.
The program, which is made up largely of campus talent, is a very
attractive one. and the price of $1 is reasonable. Business men of I'alo
Alto are responsible for the idea and they have given unselfishly of their
time to making the affair a success. Those who are to take part in the
program evidently think the project a worthy one. for they have donated
their services.
I here are probably very few men in the university who cannot re
member the time when they proudly wore a Boy Scout uniform. The
scouts make up a fine and worthy organization. Their ideals and practices
are conducive to the development of good citizens.
The entertainment tomorrow night should be well attended by students
as well as residents of Palo Alto and Mayfield.
