And now we have a freshman vigilance committee, appointed to dis
cipline freshman violators of Stanford traditions. The purpose of the
committee, to gain for the freshmen, the respect of other classes, is a
worthy one and should he accomplished.
The fact that the first year men passed the ruling unanimously is very
significant. It is evident that the new men, as a whole, are in favor of
punishing their classmates who fail to observe long standing traditions.
As long as we have traditions at Stanford, we should observe them.
If we are to neglect them, they may as well be abandoned completely. The
freshmen are largely responsible for what happens to the recognized and
worthy traditions. They are to be the upperclassmen of the future.
In view of this fact, the freshmen are the logical ones to keep their
classmates in line. Under the sponsor system, the Class of 1927 has done
very well thus far. The men and women of this class have started in the
right direction. They should accomplish a great deal of good for Stan
ford before they bid the Quad adieu.
