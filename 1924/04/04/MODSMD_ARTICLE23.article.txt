Now that spring seems to be here to stay, the Daily Palo Alto can
venture to publish the annual "spring editorial."
Without fear of contradiction, the Daily rises to assert that that little
corner of the earth which makes up the community of Stanford Univer
sity, is the most delightful spot in the world when the year is young. The
weather is ideal, with old Sol holding forth in an unbroken sky of blue.
Nature must have conceived the brown sandstone and the red tile roofs
when she created this spot.
The hills, which look to be but a stone's throw away on a clear day,
form a perfect background. Right in the midst of all the natural beauty,
hundreds of students are living, preparing themselves for careers in the
outside world. Many of them are absorbing what is handed out to them
in the classroom and utterly neglecting the liberal education that Nature
has put within their grasp.
The hills beckon to hikers and picnickers. The weather is perfect—
now. There is a lot of joy in just being alive this time of year at Stanford.
Whereupon the writer of this comment, having lived in California
some fifteen years digs out his umbrella and overshoes and calmly awaits
the next spring shower.
Oh, well, it will help fill Lagunita.
