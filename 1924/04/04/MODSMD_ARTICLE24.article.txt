## 
### 
"Neither party, today, has any par
ticular principles," said Dr. Jordan, in
discussing "Parties and Presidents" last
evening; "consequently it doesn't matter
to most people which party wins."
In discussing individual candidates for
the presidency, Dr. Jordan said, 'The
atmosphere at Washington is made by
the president. The moral influence of
Roosevelt did much for this country.
The same is true of many other presi
dents. Wc have had several presidents
who liked to be with the boys, but wc
have never had a president who was
really bad."
In a brief comment on President
Coolidge, Dr. Jordan referred very
favorably to the president's recent ap

pointments, and in discussing prospects
for reforms said, "No great reform is
expected from Coolidge. However, he will
keep things from sliding back. This is
a bad time for the reform because things
at present arc very badly broken up."
