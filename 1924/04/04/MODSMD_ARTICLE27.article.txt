# GOLF CHAMPION REFUSED BLOCK LETTER BY HARVARD
## 
### 
Bobby Jones, national open golf
champion and now a student at Har
vard university, will leave Cambridge
next month without having the golf
"H" conferred upon him. Though
Bobby was not a member of the Har
vard golf team the student council
seriously considered him a letter for
winning the open title. It was finally
ruled that an athlete must be a mem
ber of a Harvard team in order to
earn his letter.
