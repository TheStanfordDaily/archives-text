# Freshman Vigilance Men To Punish First-Year Breakers of Tradition
## 
### 
& Freshmen violators of Stanford tra
ditions will be disciplined by a vigilance
committee composed of their fellow
classmen, according to action taken at
a 1927 class meeting yesterday morning.
President James Stewart discussed
violations'of traditions by first-year men
and askefl them to remedy the conditions
in order to gain the respect of the other
classes and to set a good example for
freshmen entering this quarter. Smok
ing cigarettes and not wearing dinks
were the most flagrant offenses men
tioned by Stewart.
After a brief debate a motion was
unanimously carried, empowering the
president to appoint a vigilance commit
tee to mete out punishment to offenders.
A similar body was effective last fall in
dealing with men who did not work on
the bonfire, but violators of other tra
ditions were left alone.
Class dues of one dollar were also
voted to defray the expense of buying
sweaters for freshmen minor sport men.
