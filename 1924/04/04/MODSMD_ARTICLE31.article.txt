# HE WILL HELP UNCLE SAM

Norman Ross' recent attempt at a comeback in Hawaii is good news, as this
remarkable athlete, who holds numerous world's records from 400 metres up,
will fit in very nicely in the United States Olympic swimming team. Good
material is lacking in the 15(H) metre event and it Ross gets into shape, which
he undoubtedly will, lie will greatly strengthen the U. S. team. Ross started
his swimming career in Portland and then competed for the Olympic Club in
San Francisco. Next he had a year's tutoring under Ernie Brandsten at
Stanford University, and then "the moose" moved to Chicago, where Bill
Bachrach put 011 the finishing touches.
Norman was the hero of the Inter-Allied games, single-handed winning five
events for this country, and competing in two others. He also starred at the
last Olympic games, winning the 400 metre and 1500 metre races and swimming
a lap on the winning U. S. relay team.
