# Scotch Jig Is Danced by Quad Buildings in Quake

### 
"Shiver my timbers," quoth an old sea
faring man on the campus yesterday aft
ernoon, "this is worse than any gale at
sea. Why, even the land isn't a safe
place any more."
And 1 right he was, for buildings nodded t
at him slightly in acquiescence, and win

dows chattered approval. Even the staid
and sober Library jumped up and down
with glee.
No, he had not been drinking hair
tonic. It was merely another California
earthquake, which occurred at about
3:40 o'clock yesterday afternoon. At a
rough estimate it could not have lasted
I more than fifteen seconds, yet it accoin
j lished surprisingly grotesque things with
the landscape during that short time.
