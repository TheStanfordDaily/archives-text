# TALES FROM THE ARCHIVES
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY OF STANFORD'S BUILDINGS No. 6. CONVALESCENT HOME 
### Esther Greenacre 
Once the center of hospitality and
activity, the old Stanford residence is
now fulfilling the important mission of
a home for convalescent children. The
Home for Convalescent Children occu
pies that part of the old Stanford resi
dence which survived the earthquake.
The home is surrounded by twenty
seven acres of ground and is ap
proached by a driveway leading from
the County Road, near the bridge di
viding the County of Santa Clara
from the County of San Mateo.
The house and grounds are held on
long lease from the trustees of the
University at a rental of one dollar
per year.
The older part of the home was
once the servants' quarters, the Stan
ford residence proper being destroyed
in the earthquake of 1906. A new build
ing known as the Crocker unit was
added to the institution last year as a
gift from Mrs. Henry Crocker.
The original idea of the home as
conceived by Dr. Charles Gardner,
president of the board of directors,
was to foster social service work
among the students. In 1919 a summer
camp for convalescent children from
San Francisco was established at the
present Isolation Hospital. During the
first three years, 120 children were
cared for. With the beginning of sum
mer school, the camp had to be dis
continued. At the urgent request of

the doctors of the clinics, a home
which should be open throughout the
year was started. The family of ten
children was first housed in the old
Acacia home across from the Delta
Kappa house. In 1920' the institution
took up its permanent home at the
old Stanford residence.
During the last five years the home
lias become an important institution
with a staff of ten people, an endow
ment of the $110,000 and an annual in
come of $25,000. The building of the
Crocker unit, in which are kept twen
ty bed patients, increased the accom
modations of the home to forty chil
dren. Convalescents live in the Stan
ford unit where excellent care and
both outdoor and indoor playgrounds
are provided for them.
