# SARG MARIONETTES APPEAR IN LEGEND OF WILLOW PLATE
## Vivid Effects Obtained in Chinese Shadowgraph Performance 
### 
Real Chinese music, a pseudo-Chinese
introducer, after the style originated in
the Chauve-Souris, and backgrounds
simulating Oriental screens, gave a col
orful atmosphere for the performance of
the Chinese Willow Plate story by Tony
Sarg's shadowgraph marionettes last
night.
In two of the scenes, real persons,
dressed in the brilliant transparent cos
tumes of the marionettes, acted in place
of the puppets, puzzling the audience by
the lack of strings or wires. A demon
stration by one of the artists showed
the method used to operate the small
figures from below, instead of from
above, as marionettes are usually con
trolled.
The scenes were short enough to es
cape being as boring as most puppet per
formances, and the explanations by the
interpreter of the design on the willow
plate and its symbolism in connection
with the story, made the show educa
tional as well as interesting. The little
toy dog, with his wagging bushy tail, was
especially attractive to the children, who
composed a large part of the audience.
