Francisco Polytechnic, 12; Santa Clara,
5; Salinas, 4; Palo Alto, 3; William
Warren, 1; Redwood, Santa Cruz, and

880 Goes to Santa Clara.
The lone blue ribbon was attained by
the efforts of'Chavez from Santa Clara
who traveled the 880 in 2:06 4-5, not
•excellent time but good enough to beat
out Cummings, the babe half-miler who
had just finished first in the mile. The
Card man led the field for the lirst lap
but C havez after being boxed at the
end of that distance, passed both Mc-
Culloch and Cummings of Stanford on
the last turn. He finished strong, ten
yards in the lead of Cummings.
Babcock, who has been trailing
Adams of late in the 100 and sometimes
the 220. gave the latter much better
competition Saturday and finished
ahead of him in the furlong for a first.
He was clocked at 0:22 3-5.
Fast Time in Century.
In the century, both sprinters broke
the tape for a tie with a time of 10 1-5.
Spencer took the 440 easily with a
time of 53 3-5, and without being forced
to extend himself. Borden of Palo Alto
took the lead from Spencer after the
first turn, but the latter was satisfied to
let tin' prep runner remain ahead until
the last curve. Spencer then passed liini
and finished in a near walk.
Meeks Looks Good.
Meeks, of Stanford, came within two
and,one-half inches of tying the exist
ing Stanford-California freshman broad
jump record by traveling across the
juming pit for a mark of 22 feet \/
