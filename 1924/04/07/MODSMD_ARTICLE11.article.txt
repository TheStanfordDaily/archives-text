# BEARS BEAT OLYMPICS BY 74 1-2 TO 56 1-2 COUNT
## 
### 
California managed to hand the
Winged "O" tracksters a decisive de
feat Saturday afternoon on the Cali
fornia oval by a score of 74 1-2 to
56 1-2. This is the first comparative
dope that has been available in com
paring the performances of the Stan
ford and California varsities. Stanford
trimmed the clubmen by nearly twenty
points more than the Bears, two weeks
ago on the varsity oval. The final score
of that meet was 85-46.
No unusual performances were
made in this meet except Jim Barber's
mark in the century of 0:09 9-10. This
is the third consecutive meet in which
the Blue and Gold sprinter has regis
tered this time. If he can do as well
on April 26 he should be able to beat
Marshal Male and lun Campbell of
Stanford.
Barber also won the 220, his time
being 0:21 4-5. This is hardly good
enough to beat Campbell, but, never
theless, it is such that the Stanford

runner will have no easy time to
breast the tape ahead of his Berkeley
rival.
Good Time in Half Mile
Ran Chase won the half in 1:59 G-10.
His steady improvement during the
season points to his being a danger
ous opponent for Bill Richardson.
Likewise, in the two-mile, Jensen has
been getting a little better witli each
successive meet. His time of 10:49 9-10
Saturday hardly compares with those i
made by A1 Charles, but it does show
that California will not draw a goose
egg in this race.
Becker Wins High Hurdles
Becker won the high hurdles in
0:15 4-5 but only placed second in the
lows. It is hardly expected that he will
be able to beat "Swede" Leistner, but
Becker does not develop until the
latter part of the season and so he
may come through in the Big Meet
better than his early season perfor-1
mances would point to.
