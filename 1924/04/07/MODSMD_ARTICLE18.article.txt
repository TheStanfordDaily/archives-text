With pledging time drawing near, freshmen would do well to consider
very carefully the importance which is attached to their decisions.
In many cases, the organization with which a man affiliates himself at
Stanford, either makes or breaks him. A man with great possibilities
often fails to advance to his rightful position in college life because he
does not have the right organization behind him.
Of course, this is true only with certain limitations. Many men are
big enough and have sufficient ability and initiative to go ahead of their
own accord. Such men would never be hampered by any organization, but
their work would lie much easier if they were supported by a sympathetic
and unselfish group of friends.
Whatever decision a freshman makes, must stand for the rest of his
career at Stanford—at least four years and often longer. The fact that
his mind is not fully made up should be an indication to any man that he
is not ready to do anything. Jle needs more time to think the matter over,
for when the time comes, his course will be perfectly clear in his own
mind. He will follow out the dictates of his judgment with the confidence
which is the result ofia step in the right direction.
It is not necessarv for a man to belo#g to a certain fraternity, or. in
fact, any fraternity at Stanford. STANFORD MEN ARE NO 1 MADE
BY ANY SMALL GROUP. Small groups may help, but it is the univer
sity itself which moulds them to live up to its ideals. The all important
thing for the freshman to ascertain is that he is not joining a group which
will retard his progress.
A few questions which a man making his decision might ask himself
are : Does this group actually want me or is it merely after what 1 can do ?
What may 1 expect as a reward for affiliation with this group? Does this
organization realize that its interests are secondary to those of Stanford ?
Are the members of this group the kind of men I shall be proud to claim
as friends? Will my joining this organization leave me independent, or
will my associates be limited by it . J
A man does well to scrutinize carefully any group which strives to im
press him with its greatness by "mud slinging." Beware of the fraternity
man who says that all the best men live on the Row and be equally careful
of the Hall man who declares that the non-fraternity group includes all
the worth-while men.
Above all. Mr. Freshman, "BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, THEN
GO AHEAD."

often fails to advance to his rightful position in college life because he
does not have the right organization behind him.
Of course, this is true only with certain limitations. Many men are
big enough and have sufficient ability and initiative to go ahead of their
own accord. Such men would never be hampered by any organization, but
their work would lie much easier if they were supported by a sympathetic
and unselfish group of friends.
Whatever decision a freshman makes, must stand for the rest of his
career at Stanford—at least four years and often longer. The fact that
his mind is not fully made up should be an indication to any man that he
is not ready to do anything. Jle needs more time to think the matter over,
for when the time comes, his course will be perfectly clear in his own
mind. He will follow out the dictates of his judgment with the confidence
which is the result ofia step in the right direction.
It is not necessarv for a man to belo#g to a certain fraternity, or. in
fact, any fraternity at Stanford. STANFORD MEN ARE NO 1 MADE
BY ANY SMALL GROUP. Small groups may help, but it is the univer
sity itself which moulds them to live up to its ideals. The all important
thing for the freshman to ascertain is that he is not joining a group which
will retard his progress.
A few questions which a man making his decision might ask himself
are : Does this group actually want me or is it merely after what 1 can do ?
What may 1 expect as a reward for affiliation with this group? Does this
organization realize that its interests are secondary to those of Stanford ?
Are the members of this group the kind of men I shall be proud to claim
as friends? Will my joining this organization leave me independent, or
will my associates be limited by it . J
A man does well to scrutinize carefully any group which strives to im
press him with its greatness by "mud slinging." Beware of the fraternity
man who says that all the best men live on the Row and be equally careful
of the Hall man who declares that the non-fraternity group includes all
the worth-while men.
Above all. Mr. Freshman, "BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, THEN
GO AHEAD."
