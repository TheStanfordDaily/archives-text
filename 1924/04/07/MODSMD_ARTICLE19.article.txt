# CAFETERIA MAIL SERVICE USED IN CONSTANTINOPLE
## 
### 
Constantinople, along with its new
Republican administration, also has a
reorganized postal department which
handles foreign as well as local mail,
according to a letter recently received
by the Hoover War Library from a
correspondent on the Bosphorus. But
stories, told about the town, do not
create any very strong confidence in
either its trustworthiness or its effi
ciency.
Recently, for example, a registered
package, with a 2000 pound sterling
valuation upon it. arrived at the Con
stantinople postoffice. Its heavy appraise
ment attracted considerable attention.
When the receipt was presented for
claiming the package, which it appears
contained English bank notes, the
claimant was informed that there was
something irregular about the ship
ment, and delivery of the package was
refused. It was stated that the pack
age would be sent back to the sender.
It was. But the contents were
changed, the employee substituting an
equivalent weight of worthless paper
for the bank notes. He then resigned
from the postoffice department and de
parted for Marseilles.

Again, it is said that a foreign mer
chant went to the postoffice a short
time ago to complain about the non
receipt of some mail which he said he
knew was at the postoffice. He was
shown some huge piles of mail, which

had not been sorted. The postal of
ficial politely pave him permission to
look through them for what he wanted.
After a long- search, the man found
part of his mail and returned to his
office, doubtless grateful for the un
usual courtesy accorded him.
But some postal employees are right
on the job. The other day an AmerK
can woman, leaving the city for a time
by train, remembered, at the depot,
an item of business to which she had
forgotten to attend. Before getting on
the train, she hurriedly wrote a note
and handed it to a friend for delivery.
This was observed by a postoffice em
ployee, who was nearby supervising
the transfer of mail pouches from the
incoming Orient Express to mail van.
The employee insisted that the letter
should go through the regular mail.
After a good deal of hot discussion, a
compromise was reached. The bearer
of the note put a stamp upon the let
ter, and the postal clerk cancelled the
stamp by drawing two crossed pencil
lines upon it. The letter was then re
turned to the person for delivery—and
the chance to cheat the Turkish gov
ernment was lost.

valuation upon it. arrived at the Con
stantinople postoffice. Its heavy appraise
ment attracted considerable attention.
When the receipt was presented for
claiming the package, which it appears
contained English bank notes, the
claimant was informed that there was
something irregular about the ship
ment, and delivery of the package was
refused. It was stated that the pack
age would be sent back to the sender.
It was. But the contents were
changed, the employee substituting an
equivalent weight of worthless paper
for the bank notes. He then resigned
from the postoffice department and de
parted for Marseilles.
Merchant Searches Postoffice.
Again, it is said that a foreign mer
chant went to the postoffice a short
time ago to complain about the non
receipt of some mail which he said he
knew was at the postoffice. He was
shown some huge piles of mail, which

had not been sorted. The postal of
ficial politely pave him permission to
look through them for what he wanted.
After a long- search, the man found
part of his mail and returned to his
office, doubtless grateful for the un
usual courtesy accorded him.
But some postal employees are right
on the job. The other day an AmerK
can woman, leaving the city for a time
by train, remembered, at the depot,
an item of business to which she had
forgotten to attend. Before getting on
the train, she hurriedly wrote a note
and handed it to a friend for delivery.
This was observed by a postoffice em
ployee, who was nearby supervising
the transfer of mail pouches from the
incoming Orient Express to mail van.
The employee insisted that the letter
should go through the regular mail.
After a good deal of hot discussion, a
compromise was reached. The bearer
of the note put a stamp upon the let
ter, and the postal clerk cancelled the
stamp by drawing two crossed pencil
lines upon it. The letter was then re
turned to the person for delivery—and
the chance to cheat the Turkish gov
ernment was lost.
Constantinople, along with its new
Republican administration, also has a
reorganized postal department which
handles foreign as well as local mail,
according to a letter recently received
by the Hoover War Library from a
correspondent on the Bosphorus. But
stories, told about the town, do not
create any very strong confidence in
either its trustworthiness or its effi
ciency.
Recently, for example, a registered
package, with a 2000 pound sterling
valuation upon it. arrived at the Con
stantinople postoffice. Its heavy appraise
