# "BUD" WOODWARD
## 
### Bert Andrews 
Woodward, Tyler Francis.
The above name appears in the bawl-;
out, but probably few would recognize j
it as belonging to "Bud" Woodward, j
captain of the 1924 varsity baseball
team.
"Bud" gained some of his diamond
experience on tlie Los Angeles high
school club, on which he played three
years. The first two of these found
him perched on first base, dragging !
down throws from the infield. He was
named captain in his third year and !
was switched to shortstop.
Coming to Stanford, Woodward was j
elected leader of the '24 frosh team ,
and continued to cover short. In that
year California won the series witli
the freshmen, but only after two hard
fought games.
Graduating to the varsity in the next
season, "Bud" changed over to first
and has covered that base during the
last three years. Recently, because of
the illness of Mulchay, Woodward has I
| again been working out at short and
i will probably be seen in that position
! when the Cards meet the Bears.
Captain Woodward bats and throws
! right handed, weighs around 170, and
is an inch under six feet.
His baseball career under the Cardi- ]
i nal will terminate with the last Cali-
I fornia game. "Bud" hit around .320 j
! last year and has been playing nard,
j consistent ball all through the present
schedule.
"He's played darn good ball for j
Stanford and it's going to be hard to
replace him." That's the opinion voiced
by his teammates and, after all, that
is better than any manufactured
j phrase would be in praising the worth
of the Cardinal captain.
