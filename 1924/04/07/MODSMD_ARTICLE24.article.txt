# SPORTS OF 1924
## NO MISMANAGEMENT THIS TIME 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
If you don't already know liim. meet Charley Dean, recently appointed
manager of the U. S. Olympic track team. There have been some famous
Charleys in history, Charles the Great, Charley Chaplin, Charley Paddock, and
Charley Horse, but any list you make ought to include Charley Dean of
Chicago. He has held more positions of honor and power in amateur athletics
in this country than any other man, from that of President of the A. A. V. on
down. Charles is there when it comes to sports, having taken active part in
basketball, football, baseball, track, handball, tennis, golf, wrestling, yachting,
swimming, or what have you? Basketball owes a lot to him, not only as a
player, but as an inventor of the apparatus used in the sport. The manage
ment of the 1920 Olympic team left a lot to be desired. It's safe to say that
there will be no kicks coming on account of the way the job is done in 1924.
