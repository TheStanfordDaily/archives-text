# YEARLINGS WIN FROM LOWELL DIAMOND TEAM, 10-5
## Freshmen Bat Well, But Bad Fielding Lets in High School Tallies 
### 
One three-bagger, two singles, a'
! walk, and an error in the first inning, j
! enabled the Stanford freshman nine !
| to get the jump on Lowell high last j
Saturday morning, and win its last j
| game before the California series, 10 I
| to 5.
The frosh made one run in every j
j stanza after the first, excepting the
; sixth. The babes showed their usual
good work with the stick. Lowell |
garnered four scattered hits off Ost- j
j haus and Collins, the Card twirlers,!
\ but ragged fielding by the babes |
i brought in the high school scores. j
|
Fireworks in First
Stewart, first man up for the fresh- j
| men in the initial stanza, poled out j
| a three-base hit, and scored on iliese's |
! single over second. Morrill walked.
| The Lowell back-stop man overthrew j
â€¢ second, and Riese tallied, Morrill go
, ing to third. Lindquist fiied out. David i
j knocked out a fast grounder, but the i
I ball hit a pebble on the diamond and |
I bounced over the prep shortstop's
I head, Morrill coming over the home ,
! plate for another counter.
Babes Score at Will
Lowell was demoralized after the [
j first spasm, and the babes had little
difficulty in scoring almost at will in j
j subsequent frames.
Riese got a homer in the fourth,!
! while Stewart, Lindquist, McKersie
| and Southward, all of Stanford, each j
| connected for triples.
