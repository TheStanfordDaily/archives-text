# INTELLIGENCE TEST TO BE NEW ENTRANCE REQUIREMENT
## Will Be Added Standard of Selecting Applicants For Admission 
### 
As an additional means of selecting
the most promising applicants for ad
mission to Stanford in the under
graduate group which is strictly limit
ed in numbers, Stanford has estab
lished an intelligence test, which all
candidates for undergraduate stand
ing must undergo after they have
successfully passed all other tests for
admission.
The University will give the exam
ination in numerous centers in Cali
fornia and outside the state in June
of each year, and it will also be given
at the University in October, January,
and April.
Utilization of the intelligence test
as a supplementary means of selecting
the best students seeking admission
to Stanford follows a year and a half
in which Stanford has given such a
test to all entering students, although
it has not made it a condition of ad
mission. Study of the records made in
these tests and comparison with the
work the students hae done later in
their college classes have indicated
that the test offers a surprisingly ac
curate indication of the students' abil
ity as college students.
Stanford has been forced to curtail
the number of underclassmen admit-
ted, while accepting upperclassmen
and graduate students without re
strictions because its facilities will not
care for the masses of beginers ade
quately, but there is some room for
the more advanced students. It has,
therefore, increased the requirements
for admission to freshman standing
from time to time in the effort to se
cure students of ability and character
that will insure their remaining in
the University until graduation with
out being forced out of the institution
through scholarship deficiencies in
such large proportions as are regarded
as normal.
The University will give the exam
ination in numerous centers in Cali
fornia and outside the state in June
of each year, and for those who find
it impossible to take the test at that
time it will also be given at the Uni
versity during the week preceding the
opening of college terms in October,
January, and April.
In addition to the ordinary methods
of gaining admission through high
scholarship records in .'high school
or through examinations, Stanford has
laid special stress on seriousness of
purpose. Now it has set up the intel
ligence test as a still further means
of selecting from those who have al
ready passed the other barriers.
The intelligence test requirement
will apply to both men and women
candidates for admission, and for both,
even though they are advanced stu
dents, admission may be denied if
scores in this test are below 50.

Seven scholastic prizes will be
awarded at the University of Cali
fornia during February, March, and
April. More entries than in any pre
vious year have been made, according
to Prof. B. H. Lehman, chairman of
the committee on prizes.

fornia during February, March, and
April. More entries than in any pre
vious year have been made, according
to Prof. B. H. Lehman, chairman of
the committee on prizes.
As an additional means of selecting
the most promising applicants for ad
mission to Stanford in the under
graduate group which is strictly limit
ed in numbers, Stanford has estab
lished an intelligence test, which all
candidates for undergraduate stand
ing must undergo after they have
successfully passed all other tests for
admission.
The University will give the exam
ination in numerous centers in Cali
fornia and outside the state in June
of each year, and it will also be given
at the University in October, January,
and April.
Utilization of the intelligence test
as a supplementary means of selecting
the best students seeking admission
to Stanford follows a year and a half
in which Stanford has given such a
test to all entering students, although
it has not made it a condition of ad
mission. Study of the records made in
these tests and comparison with the
work the students hae done later in
their college classes have indicated
that the test offers a surprisingly ac
curate indication of the students' abil
ity as college students.
Stanford has been forced to curtail
the number of underclassmen admit-
ted, while accepting upperclassmen
and graduate students without re
strictions because its facilities will not
care for the masses of beginers ade
quately, but there is some room for
the more advanced students. It has,
therefore, increased the requirements
for admission to freshman standing
from time to time in the effort to se
cure students of ability and character
that will insure their remaining in
the University until graduation with
out being forced out of the institution
through scholarship deficiencies in
such large proportions as are regarded
as normal.
The University will give the exam
ination in numerous centers in Cali
fornia and outside the state in June
of each year, and for those who find
it impossible to take the test at that
time it will also be given at the Uni
versity during the week preceding the
opening of college terms in October,
January, and April.
In addition to the ordinary methods
of gaining admission through high
scholarship records in .'high school
or through examinations, Stanford has
laid special stress on seriousness of
purpose. Now it has set up the intel
ligence test as a still further means
of selecting from those who have al
ready passed the other barriers.
The intelligence test requirement
will apply to both men and women
candidates for admission, and for both,
even though they are advanced stu
dents, admission may be denied if
scores in this test are below 50.

Seven scholastic prizes will be
awarded at the University of Cali
