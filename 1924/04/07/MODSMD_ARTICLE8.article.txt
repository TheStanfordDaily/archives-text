# UNDERSTAND SPIRITUAL URGE IN INDUSTRY SAYS OXNAM
## 
### 
"We must translate statistics into
human beings if we wish to under
stand the world industrial movement,"
asserted the Reverend Bromley Oxnam
last night in the first open forum lec
ture held on the Pacific Coast. His
topic was "Religion and Industry."
"One cannot understand the world
industrial movement unless he under
stands the spiritual urge behind it.
Analyze modern industry to see how
its ethics conform to the teachings of
Jesus. It is organized too largely
around the acquisitive motive, which
conflicts with his principles. Imperial
istic gain is put prior to the develop
ment of human beings."
British Industry Religious
"A dominant religious spirit put
British industry on a basis of co-opera
tion, not acquisition. What we need in
American labor is a spiritual goal."
In discussing the part the church
should play in the solution of the in
dustrial problem, Dr. Oxnam stated
that it should first study the labor
movement, and weigh its ethics with
the ethics of Jesus. We should devote
ourselves to find out the causes of
industrial unrest rather than to fram
ing silly criminal syndicalism laws.
We ought to know about the social
demands of our own religion.
The speaker declared that he re
frained from drawing a conclusion lie
cause he wished merely to offer sug
gestions for audience discussion, and
then threw the meeting open to ques
tions from the floor. Close knowledge
and interest in the subject were re
vealed in the inquiries which extended
half an hour beyond the scheduled
closing time.
