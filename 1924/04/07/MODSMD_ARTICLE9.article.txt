# FAST DRIVING CAUSES TWO ACCIDENTS SATURDAY
## K. C. Brown and T. Blackburn Injuredâ€”Automobiles Badly Damaged 
### 
Two automobile accidents occurred
I
on the campus over the week-end.
Kenneth C. Brown, Stanford fresh
man, suffered a concussion of the
brain and other injuries when the car
in which he was riding, owned by N.
K. Rathman, also a freshman, struck
an auto driven by Robert J. Hacken
berger, University employe, at G
o'clock Saturday evening. The accident
occurred at the intersection of Pine
avenue and the Stadium road near En
cina gymnasium.
Hackenberger's car, a Dodge steel
coupe, was rolled over on its top and
stopped on the car tracks near the
road. Rathman's car, a Ford, was dam
aged.
Both Rathman and Hackenberger
escaped injuries, the latter being saved
by the steel body of his car.
Brown was thrown out of the Ford
and lit on his head. He was
taken to the Palo Alto hospital where
he was attended by Dr. Carl Wilson.
He was still unconscious this morning
but will probably recover.
Brown registers from Sacramento
and Rathman from Blair, Nebraska.
The injured man is a polo player on
the freshman team.
The other accident occurred at 1:30
Saturday morning when Thorton
Blackburn, claiming registration in the
University, was struck by a sedan
while he was standing in back of his
car which was parked on Palm Drive.
He received cuts on the head and
was taken to the Palo Alto hospital
where he said he was a Stanford stu
dent. The registrar's office reports,
however, that no such name is listed
on the University records as a stu
dent.
