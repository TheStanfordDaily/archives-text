f Right Now—
4 You may be one of those
men who are wearing
shoes that hurt —or at
the best are uncomfort-
And after all, that's the
surest way to take the
joy out of life—isn't it?
Our business of course is
to sell shoes, but when
our customers keep com
ing back with smiles on
their faces and say:
'Those Packards sure
Lrj were fine," you can't
H blame us for talking a
g little bit about them.
