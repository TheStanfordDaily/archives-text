Don't give a j
"too much rope"
Just when you're hurrying the most
— zip! and away goes that shaving
cream cap. The new cap on Williams
ends the nuisance forever. It's hinged , V
on and can't get lost.
In shaving, too, Williams has just as noticeable im
provements: Williams lather is heavier and more closely
woven. It holds the water in against the beard. Result:
quicker softening. Williams lather lubricates —no irri
tating friction. Last, Williams is decidedly helpful to the
skin. It l&eps your face comfortable no matter how
heavy your beard and how tender your skin. There's
no coloring matter in Williams—it is a natural white,
absolutely pure. Say "Williams Hinge-Cap" toyour dealer.
