# FRESHMAN ORATORS MEET CALIFORNIA YEARLINGS MONDAY
## 
### 
Freshman debaters will go into ac
tion in their initial contest when they
meet California's first year men in the
Little Theatre next Monday night.
Ted Baer, Lloyd Sullivan, and Rob
ert Bruce will argue in favor of Ameri
can recognition of Russia. Simultane
ously, Stanford speakers will uphold
the other side of the question against
the College of Pacific at San Jose.
Harold Peterson, Rex Kramer, and
Craven Scott compose the rtegative
team.
Decision will be rendered under the
so-called "expert judge" system under
which but one man officiates. In all
probability the Pacific coach will act
as judge here, the California coach at
San Jose, and the Stanford coach at
Berkeley,* where California affirma
tive and Pacific negative will try con
clusions.
Freshman teams have been working
on the question for two months under
the direction of Bert Levit, a varsity
debater, and are confident of turning
in a double victory.
