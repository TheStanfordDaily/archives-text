### Beatrice Flesher 
"Knowledge of people or psychology
is essential for success in everything."
Thus spoke Leo Carrillo, the highly
romantic appearing figure of the typi
cal southern gentleman of 1847, richly
clad in hlack silk suit, adorned with
curly sideburns, and animated by a
pair of twinkling black eyes, one day
last week after his appearance in the
satirical drama, "Magnolia," by Booth
Tarkington, now playing at the Alca
zar theatre, San Francisco, in "Lom
bardi Ltd."

"I worked on the Examiner in San
Francisco," he said, "and my news
paper experience gave me insight into
the human sfd« of things. I know the
people 1 am portraying; I not only
imitate them."
Work, in capital letters, was what
Carrillo emphasized in telling of his
art. In addition to the dally drill of

rehearsals, study for parts, knowledge
of the atmosphere in a play is neces
sary for the actor.
Studies Local Color
"For 'Magnolia'," he said, "I satur
ated myself with local color by voy
ages on the Mississippi, and a visit to
Natchez. There I studied the people,
became acquainted with them, read all
the history dealing with the period of
the action of the play, until now I can
almost feel the location when I por
tray it."
Carrillo endorsed the study of the
periods of ancient and modern history
with a view to developing the sources
of imagination, as useful for those
lanning to go on the stage. He also
endorsed participation in amateur
theatricals for this end.
"Have a destination or goal picked
out," he advised. "Then educate your
self for it. Education is the basis of
everything. The actor, as well as other
artists, must be educated.
"I demand the same respect for the
theatre as the other arts receive.
"The moral standard of the theatre
is as serious and as big as any other
profession. It is up to the public to
maintain it. We need their moral sup
port for good clean American -drama."
As far as public taste is concerned,
he was uncertain. "One can never tell
how well a play will be received until
it is presented to an audience," he
maintained.

Booth Tarkington's name will go
down in American theatrical history
for the production of his delicious sa
tire, "Magnolia," according to the ac
tor. "He looks at life with a twinkle
in his eye; he has our 'number'."
In discussing the art of the Ameri
can drama, Carrillo said that the new
system of bringing plays to the West
before they are ancient history on
Broadway, will improve the status of
the profession. When producers stop
commercializing the drama, more
artistry will appear, and plays will be
an educational feature, he thinks.

of imagination, as useful for those
lanning to go on the stage. He also
endorsed participation in amateur
theatricals for this end.
"Have a destination or goal picked
out," he advised. "Then educate your
self for it. Education is the basis of
everything. The actor, as well as other
artists, must be educated.
"I demand the same respect for the
theatre as the other arts receive.
"The moral standard of the theatre
is as serious and as big as any other
profession. It is up to the public to
maintain it. We need their moral sup
port for good clean American -drama."
As far as public taste is concerned,
he was uncertain. "One can never tell
how well a play will be received until
it is presented to an audience," he
maintained.

Booth Tarkington's name will go
down in American theatrical history
for the production of his delicious sa
tire, "Magnolia," according to the ac
tor. "He looks at life with a twinkle
in his eye; he has our 'number'."
In discussing the art of the Ameri
can drama, Carrillo said that the new
system of bringing plays to the West
before they are ancient history on
Broadway, will improve the status of
the profession. When producers stop
commercializing the drama, more
artistry will appear, and plays will be
an educational feature, he thinks.
"Knowledge of people or psychology
is essential for success in everything."
Thus spoke Leo Carrillo, the highly
romantic appearing figure of the typi
cal southern gentleman of 1847, richly
clad in hlack silk suit, adorned with
curly sideburns, and animated by a
pair of twinkling black eyes, one day
last week after his appearance in the
satirical drama, "Magnolia," by Booth
Tarkington, now playing at the Alca
zar theatre, San Francisco, in "Lom
bardi Ltd."
Journalism Gives Insight
"I worked on the Examiner in San
Francisco," he said, "and my news
paper experience gave me insight into
the human sfd« of things. I know the
people 1 am portraying; I not only
imitate them."
Work, in capital letters, was what
Carrillo emphasized in telling of his
art. In addition to the dally drill of

rehearsals, study for parts, knowledge
of the atmosphere in a play is neces
sary for the actor.
Studies Local Color
"For 'Magnolia'," he said, "I satur
ated myself with local color by voy
ages on the Mississippi, and a visit to
Natchez. There I studied the people,
became acquainted with them, read all
the history dealing with the period of
the action of the play, until now I can
almost feel the location when I por
tray it."
Carrillo endorsed the study of the
periods of ancient and modern history
with a view to developing the sources
of imagination, as useful for those
lanning to go on the stage. He also
endorsed participation in amateur
theatricals for this end.
