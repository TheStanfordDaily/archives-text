# FOOTBALL PRACTICE GAINS SWIFT HEADWAY
## 
### 
Slowly but surely the number turning
out for spring football practice increases,
as men trickle in from other sports.
More than 100 men went through the
workout yesterday.
One encouraging feature of the early
practice this year, is the fact that many
of the candidates have never turned out
for varsity football before. By coupling
this fact of loads of new materials and
the one that there will be a veteran for
every position on next season's varsity
outfit, it is apparent why Card followers
have a right to be enthusiastic.
Varsity Men Are Out
The varsity "S" men now in suits in
clude Baker. Hunt, Dwight, Middleton,
Thomas, and Wheat. Dick Lawson, once
a member of the famous passing com
bination of Lawson to Lawson that won
a state championship for Long Beach
High School, is now out on the field, and
should put in a dangerous bid for the
quarterback position left open by the
graduation of "Scotchy" Campbell.
Almost the entire freshman first string
is turning out. Among these aspirants
are many possibilities for varsity squad
positions, although it is doubtful
whether any, with the exception of Fred
Swan, will be on the first eleven. Among
the likely looking babes is John Garth
waite, a really fast halfback. Garth
waite has a world of speed, although
just a little fellow, and with a little
more experience should make a capable
open field runner.
