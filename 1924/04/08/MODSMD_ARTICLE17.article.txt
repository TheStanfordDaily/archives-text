# FORTY MILES AN HOUR ONCE THOUGHT SPEEDY
## 
### 
"Tearing along at the terrific rate
of 40 miles an hour" —so begins a story
which appeared in papers 25 years
ago, telling the tale of Thomas Magee
of San Francisco, who was trying for
a speed record between San Jose and
Oakland.
Thomas had one of the powerful
motors of the time. He had motored
from San Francisco to Del Monte —
which was quite a trip in that day, and
was returning home via Oakland.
When he arrived in San Jose, he de
cided he would make a record for him
self.
He tore along as fast as the roads
would permit, and farmers by the way
side craned their necks to look at the
"gosh durned thing." All went well
with Magee until he neared Center
ville. He was chugging along at 40 per,
and was patting himself on the back,
when something caused the car to
stop dead. He got out to fix it. There
was a hiss and a roar, and Magee
came to. lying in the road, with pieces
of his valued racer scattered all over
the neighboring grain fields.
The only tow car in those days was
a grain wagon. Magee hired one of the
farmer's wagons, picked up as many
pieces of the machine as he could
find, and "toted" them to Oakland.
