# REDSHIRTS HAVE EDGE IN TRACK MEET SATURDAY
## Cliff Argue in Century Is 9 4-5 Man—Maxwell Speedy Hurdler 
### 
Everything points to a Stanford vic
tory against the conference track ath
letes of Southern California next Sat
urday when the two clash in the Cardi
nal oval in the annual meet.
As a whole, the performances made
in the conference meet last Saturday,
in which the southern institutions
took part, fall far below those being
regularly made by Coach "Dink" Tern
pleton's men.
Argue in the sprints, Buckman in
the furlong, Maxwell in the hurdles,
and Frisbie in the broad-jump, are the
only southern athletes who seem to
have a chance to cop first place.
Cliff Argue is a whole track team in
himself. He is being boosted for the
Olympic games, for he covers the cen
tury in 0:09 4-5 consistently. In addi
tion he runs a fast 220 1 , high jumps,
and broad jumps, and is somewhat of
a weight man.
Bruckman Best in 220
In the Southern Conference meet
Argue had little trouble in winning the
century in his usual fast time. How
ever, in the 220 he was nosed out by
Bruckman, who did 0:22 flat, a mark
which ties the conference record.
Montgomery of Occidental appears
to be the best half-miler. His best
season's time is 2:00 9-10.
Keetch, of California Tech, who won
the two-mile last year in the fast time
of 9:52 2-5, is not running.
Maxwell of Occidental is the best
of the hurdlers, and will make a very
good opponent for Leistner. Last year
he tied "Swede" for third in the high
sticks and defeated him in the low
barriers.
"Tiny" Hartranft should have things
easy in the weight events. Ridderhof,
