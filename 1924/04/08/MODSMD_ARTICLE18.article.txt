# REDSHIRTS HAVE EDGE IN TRACK MEET SATURDAY
## Cliff Argue in Century Is 9 4-5 Man—Maxwell Speedy Hurdler 
### 
Everything points to a Stanford vic
tory against the conference track ath
letes of Southern California next Sat
urday when the two clash in the Cardi
nal oval in the annual meet.
As a whole, the performances made
in the conference meet last Saturday,
in which the southern institutions
took part, fall far below those being
regularly made by Coach "Dink" Tern
pleton's men.
Argue in the sprints, Buckman in
the furlong, Maxwell in the hurdles,
and Frisbie in the broad-jump, are the
only southern athletes who seem to
have a chance to cop first place.
Cliff Argue is a whole track team in
himself. He is being boosted for the
Olympic games, for he covers the cen
tury in 0:09 4-5 consistently. In addi
tion he runs a fast 220 1 , high jumps,
and broad jumps, and is somewhat of
a weight man.
Bruckman Best in 220
In the Southern Conference meet
Argue had little trouble in winning the
century in his usual fast time. How
ever, in the 220 he was nosed out by
Bruckman, who did 0:22 flat, a mark
which ties the conference record.
Montgomery of Occidental appears
to be the best half-miler. His best
season's time is 2:00 9-10.
Keetch, of California Tech, who won
the two-mile last year in the fast time
of 9:52 2-5, is not running.
Maxwell of Occidental is the best
of the hurdlers, and will make a very
good opponent for Leistner. Last year
he tied "Swede" for third in the high
sticks and defeated him in the low
barriers.
"Tiny" Hartranft should have things
easy in the weight events. Ridderhof,
Occidental, succeeded in hurling the
Greek platter 123 feet 10 inches, and
Giles tj£>t the shot out 42 feet 1-2 inch.
Against this competition Hartranft
must be given an easy first, while
Dick Richards and "Scotchy" Camp
hell will have a good chance of snag
ging the second places.
Frisbie did not live up to expecta
tions in the broad jump, as he only
jumped 22 feet 5 inches. He won this
event at Stanford last year with a leap
of 22 feet 8 inches. If he does not do
better than 22 feet 5 Saturday he is
likely to find Dick Macßae's heel
prints farther out in the pit than his
own.
Goodenough of Occidental and Gra
ham of California Tech have been
fighting it out for pole vault honors
for several seasons. They hold a south
ern conference record of 12 feet 5 1-4
inches jointly, and have hopes of bet
tering this mark when they vault
against the Cards.
