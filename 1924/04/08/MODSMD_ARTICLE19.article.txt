# STATISTICS PROVE COLLEGE WOMEN ENJOY LONG LIFE
## 
### 
College women, as a rule, live longer
than their less highly educated sis
ters, according to statistics given out
by the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company.
The study, covering 15,561 college
women graduates, showed that the
death rate was three and twenty-four
hundredths per 1,000, between the
ages of twenty and sixty-tour. Between
twenty-five aiul thirty-four years, the
death rate was two and seventy-seven
hundredths per 1,000.
Among women in the general popu
lation the death rate at this age period
was six and ten-hundredths per 1,000,
or more than twice as high.
Dr. L. I. Dublin, statistician of the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company,
says that these figures are due to sev
eral important causes.
College Selective Process
"First," he says, "there is the se
lective effect of the secondary and
collegiate process. Those physically
unfit to pursue studies usually drop
from the rolls."
He believes also that college women
come from a superior home environ
ment, which should be conducive to
better health than the average.
Benefit in a college environment,
according to Dr. Dublin, comes from
medical examination and prescribed
physical exercise. Besides that, the
whyl>e of college education is influen
tial toward the right conduct of life,
he believes.
"After graduation many of them
enter professional pursuits where the
risk of death is at a minimum," he
says.
