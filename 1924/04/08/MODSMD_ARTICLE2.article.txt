# FIRST YEAR BALL TEAM HAS STRONG ARRAY OF PITCHERS
## 
### 
When Coach "Husky" Hunt's pro
teges meet the California freshman nine
next Saturday afternoon on the home lot
for the first game of the little-big series,
they will be strengthened by the best
array of pitching ability that has graced
a freshman team for several seasons.
Osthaus, Collins. Hunter, Riese, and
"Lindquist have all showed marked pitch
ing abilities. Osthaus and Collins have
been used more this season than the
mother three, but an examination of their
respective records shows their dependa
bility.
Osthaus has made 44 strikeouts in 55
innings, Collins has made 54 strikeouts
in 46 innings, Hunter has made 9 strike
outs in 13 innings, Riese has made 16
strikeouts in 12 innings, and Linquist has
-made 9 strikeouts in 6 innings. In 132
innings Cardinal pitchers have struck
•out 122 men.
Osthaus has pitched the largest num
ber of innings, but has failed to make
as manj' strikeouts as Collins. This
comparative average doesn't show a great
deal about the respective abilities of the
•mound Workers, but rather their general
run of action in the box. Osthaus and
Riese have.proved valuable in the out
field, while Lindquist is fighting for a
■berth at second.
In the 132 innings played, opposing
nines have only been able to score 78
hits from the youngsters' pitching staff,
while the frosh have made 157 hits in
the same number of innings which con
stituted seventeen games.
