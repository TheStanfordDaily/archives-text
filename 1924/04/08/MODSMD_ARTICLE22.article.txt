# A 						Menace
## 
### 
Two men were injured and several others narrowly escaped as the
result of two automobile accidents on the campus over the week-end.
These accidents should not prove surprising to anyone who has noticed
the reckless way in which many drivers propel their cars about the campus.
However, these occurrences demand that something be done.
Demon Speed has invaded the campus and he is here to stay until
some very definite step is taken to cut down his activities. Hundreds of
lives are endangered every day right here on the Stanford Farm bv these
parasites who drive their automobiles about at breakneck speed. All over
the United States, campaigns are being conducted to do away with this
menace.
And now the situation is brought home to us and we must act. The
presence of speed cops from time to time does not seem to have much
influence, nor do the small fines usually imposed on offenders. The Daily
Palo Alto is not advocating the banishing of machines from the campus—
now. However, if some measure is not taken to curtail the activities of
speeders, there will be no other course open. Then, the machines must go.
for they will have no place on the campus as long as they are menaces to
human life.
A logical solution to this most serious problem seems to be to punish
violators right here on the campus. Fifteen, or at the most, twenty miles
an hour is fast enough for automobiles on the campus. As it is, they tear
up and down the Row, at rates varying from twenty to forty-five or fifty
miles an hour. A pedestrian is not safe in crossing the street between the
Engineering Corner and the Post Office at any time of the day.
For the time being, it would be a good idea to post one or two officers
somewhere between the Art Gallery and the end of the Row. These men
should have instructions to halt anyone driving over twenty miles an hour.
All speeders should be turned over to the Men's Council. As the lives en
dangered are student lives, the punishment should be meted out by a
student disciplinary body.
For the first offense, a student violator should be deprived of operating
an automobile on the campus for a period of at least two weeks. The
second offense could be punished by added hours to the graduation re
quirement and the third by suspension from the University.
The Daily Palo Alto is very desirous of seeing something done im
mediately in this matter. Every day that is lost in debating as to the
course to be pursued means more possibilities for speed maniacs to destroy
property and human lives.
Of course, the most desirable way to solve the whole problem would be
through the drivers themselves. This does not seem possible, unfortu
nately, and now something else must be done. All operators of auto
mobiles on the campus are not to blame. There are a few people who
repeatedly offend and they are the ones at whom the new ruling should
be aimed.
It should be to the interest of the sane drivers to curb the activities of
the would-be Oldfields, Murphys, and De Palmas. It is one thing to drive
an automobile and worry about running into someone, but it is another
thing to be constantly wondering when the other fellow is going to run
into you.

It should be to the interest of the sane drivers to curb the activities of
the would-be Oldfields, Murphys, and De Palmas. It is one thing to drive
an automobile and worry about running into someone, but it is another
thing to be constantly wondering when the other fellow is going to run
into you.
Two men were injured and several others narrowly escaped as the
result of two automobile accidents on the campus over the week-end.
These accidents should not prove surprising to anyone who has noticed
the reckless way in which many drivers propel their cars about the campus.
However, these occurrences demand that something be done.
Demon Speed has invaded the campus and he is here to stay until
some very definite step is taken to cut down his activities. Hundreds of
lives are endangered every day right here on the Stanford Farm bv these
parasites who drive their automobiles about at breakneck speed. All over
the United States, campaigns are being conducted to do away with this
menace.
And now the situation is brought home to us and we must act. The
presence of speed cops from time to time does not seem to have much
influence, nor do the small fines usually imposed on offenders. The Daily
Palo Alto is not advocating the banishing of machines from the campus—
now. However, if some measure is not taken to curtail the activities of
speeders, there will be no other course open. Then, the machines must go.
for they will have no place on the campus as long as they are menaces to
human life.
A logical solution to this most serious problem seems to be to punish
violators right here on the campus. Fifteen, or at the most, twenty miles
an hour is fast enough for automobiles on the campus. As it is, they tear
up and down the Row, at rates varying from twenty to forty-five or fifty
miles an hour. A pedestrian is not safe in crossing the street between the
Engineering Corner and the Post Office at any time of the day.
For the time being, it would be a good idea to post one or two officers
somewhere between the Art Gallery and the end of the Row. These men
should have instructions to halt anyone driving over twenty miles an hour.
All speeders should be turned over to the Men's Council. As the lives en
dangered are student lives, the punishment should be meted out by a
student disciplinary body.
For the first offense, a student violator should be deprived of operating
an automobile on the campus for a period of at least two weeks. The
second offense could be punished by added hours to the graduation re
quirement and the third by suspension from the University.
The Daily Palo Alto is very desirous of seeing something done im
mediately in this matter. Every day that is lost in debating as to the
course to be pursued means more possibilities for speed maniacs to destroy
property and human lives.
Of course, the most desirable way to solve the whole problem would be
through the drivers themselves. This does not seem possible, unfortu
nately, and now something else must be done. All operators of auto
mobiles on the campus are not to blame. There are a few people who
repeatedly offend and they are the ones at whom the new ruling should
be aimed.
