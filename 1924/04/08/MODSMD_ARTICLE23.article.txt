# Support for the Freshmen
## 
### 
The freshman track team journeys to Berkeley Saturday to meet tlxe
California yearlings in their annual battle.
"Dink" Templeton has developed one of the strongest first year teams
Stanford has ever put out and his squad has a better chance to win than
any yearling track squad has had in years. In spite of the fact that two
athletic events on the campus Saturday will influence many students to
stay here, the babes should perform before a good crowd of Stanford
rooters at Berkeley.
The freshmen, particularly, should go to root for their classmates.
The Class of 1927 has already won two major sports from their California
rivals and a victory in track Saturday would further advance the fresh
man stock.

Hatfield, the "Rain-Maker," is only another proof of how easy it is to
get rich, if one is willing to capitalize the boob tendencies of the populace.
There was practically no investment on his part, and the gentle rain falls
On rich and poor .alike, making Hatfield richer. We will guarantee to make
the sun rise on any given morning, provided advance notice is given.

Stanford is putting over a big program the week end of the Rig Meet.
It is worthy of support on the part of students, alumrti, and friends of the
university.
