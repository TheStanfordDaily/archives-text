## PRINCETON ADOPTS NEW COMMON SENSE EDUCATION 
### 
Princeton has talten steps permit
ting the students to decide for them
selves if and when they will attend
classes. The committee says, "This
puts a fearful responsibility on the
instructor. Henceforth he must make
his classes interesting. At the end of
the course he will also have to pre
pare an examination determining less
whether the student has mastered his
facts than whether he has mastered
any ideas about them. Some will never
come to class at all, but if they do not
and can satisfy the instructor on
those two points, Princeton is ready
to admit the common-sense of the sys
tem, even if it does sound alarmingly
revolutionary."
