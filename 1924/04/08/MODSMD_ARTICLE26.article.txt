# TEXAS WOMEN PAY EXPENSES BY CLIPPING NEWSPAPERS
## 
### 
Reading and clipping approximately
550 Texas newspapers is the means
ten young women students of the Uni
versity of Texas have found to earn
their expenses while attending school.
The Students' Clipping Bureau is oper
ated entirely by students, under the
direction of the University Office of
Publicity. Every daily and weekly
newspaper published in the state is
received by the bureau, and the stu
dents read and clip them for numerous
subscribers, including state depart
ments, civic and commercial organiza
tions, fairs, chambers of commerce,
trade magazines, candidates for office,
and prominent individuals. The clip
pings are clipped, labelled, and mailed
out by the students.
