# QUAKERS FIRST TO RECOGNIZE STATE OF DISEASED MENTALITY
## Neurotic Cases Once Thought To Be Possessed of Devils, Spirits 
### Barbara Miller 
"Among the first to consider mental
cases as real illnesses and to try treat
ing them as such was the Society of
Friends or Quakers," said Dr. Eliza
beth L. Martin, medical adviser of wo
men during the absence of Dr. Moslier.
"Before that time such patients were
often looked upon as being possessed
of devils and were dealt with accord
ingly."
Dr. Martin has been doing psychi
atric work in the Friends' Hospital at
Philadelphia, Pa. This institution was
established in 1813 by the Quakers.
Though up-to-date methods of treat
ment are now followed, some of the
quaint buildings of the original plan
are still standing. Dr. Martin was the
only woman on the staff, serving with
three men.

"I went into the work there because
I feel that every physician should
know mental cases. 1 am deeply in
i terested in mental hygiene, which in
j dudes education in the prevention of
I nervous conditions," said Dr. Martin.
There were twice as many women as
men in this institution, which is not
the case in state institutions. Among
the patients were a few college stu
dents. Dr. Martin found that an im
proper attitude toward work and emo
tions, combined with physical disabili
ties, caused breakdowns.
Outlook on Life Vital
"Mental work does not result in
j breaks when both the nutrition and
! the outlook 011 life are good. The most
i important factors in mental hygiene
j are general hygiene and the proper
view of life. Even those with inherited
nervous weaknesses are often pre
vented from breaking by learning how
; to live and to meet their responsibili
| ties and emotions. Those studying
j these conditions feel that a physical
| cause will eventually be found for all
I the more serious mental states. Phvsi
[ cians today are bending all of their
energies toward finding these ultimate
causes."
The human side of the individual
must not be overlooked in work with
mental cases. It is this distinct per
sonality of each patient which lends
such fascination to the work and dou
bles the desire of the physician to help
the individual. There is a tremendous
amount of satisfaction in psychiatry,
j in the opinion of Dr. Martin.
College Sports Helpful
Health work in the colleges is pre
j venting a great deal of nervous trou
ble. She has had much work with
women of college age and finds today
a more wholesome attitude toward
life and a healthy interest in sports.
"It is perfectly obvious that health
opportunities here in California are
better than in the East. One lives more
in the open air and there are 110 great
extremes of climate."
Personality Three-Fold
This added interest in physical ac
tivities will make for saner and better
balanced personalities. According to
one physician, "Personality is a tripod
which rests upon three bases —mental,
physical, and spiritual or emotional."
For four years Dr. Martin was in
structor in hygiene and school physi
cian at the Margaret Morrison School
for Women of the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, located at Pittsburgh,

College Sports Helpful
Health work in the colleges is pre

a more wholesome attitude toward

"It is perfectly obvious that health

Personality Three-Fold
This added interest in physical ac
tivities will make for saner and better
balanced personalities. According to
one physician, "Personality is a tripod
which rests upon three bases —mental,
physical, and spiritual or emotional."
For four years Dr. Martin was in
structor in hygiene and school physi
cian at the Margaret Morrison School
for Women of the Carnegie Institute
of Technology, located at Pittsburgh,
"Among the first to consider mental
cases as real illnesses and to try treat
ing them as such was the Society of
Friends or Quakers," said Dr. Eliza
beth L. Martin, medical adviser of wo
men during the absence of Dr. Moslier.
"Before that time such patients were
often looked upon as being possessed
of devils and were dealt with accord
ingly."
Dr. Martin has been doing psychi
atric work in the Friends' Hospital at
Philadelphia, Pa. This institution was
established in 1813 by the Quakers.
Though up-to-date methods of treat
ment are now followed, some of the
quaint buildings of the original plan
are still standing. Dr. Martin was the
only woman on the staff, serving with
three men.

"I went into the work there because
I feel that every physician should
know mental cases. 1 am deeply in
i terested in mental hygiene, which in
j dudes education in the prevention of
I nervous conditions," said Dr. Martin.
There were twice as many women as
men in this institution, which is not
the case in state institutions. Among
the patients were a few college stu
dents. Dr. Martin found that an im
proper attitude toward work and emo
tions, combined with physical disabili
ties, caused breakdowns.
