"We fail to add faith to knowledge.
That is the trouble with the present con
troversy between religion and evolution,"
declared Professor C. A. Kofoid of the
University of California, last evening in
his lecture on "Religion and Evolution,"
the second of the open forum series be
ing held at Stanford.
"We are only at the beginning of ap
plication of science to social needs of
our daily life. The infinite personality
we cannot know is expressing himself
through us. His work in the world is
done through us perfectly or imper
fectly, according to our concept of him.
"Our great task is getting men to
work together sufficiently so we can use
our knowledge accurately. We may l)e
able sometimes to get scientific knowl
edge of human nature and link it with
other knowledge of the universe."
Kofoid questioned whether we can ad
just our thinking to a concept of a God
back of all with whom we may have a
share by being in harmony with his pur
pose, and whether with our present
knowledge we are not destroying our
better selves. He asserted that we are
only at the beginning of application of
science to social needs of our daily life.
With these suggestions the speaker
paved the way for questions from his
audi'>:.ce, in which careful thought was
in evidence.
