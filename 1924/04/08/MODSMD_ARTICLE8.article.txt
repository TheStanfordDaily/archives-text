## 
### 
Jim Arthur, varsity track man, is
registering in the University today,
and will be eligible to compete against
California. Arthur failed to place in
the Stanford-California meet last year,
but took third in the discus and fourth
in the shot-put at the N. C. A. A. in
Chicago last June, and placed second
to Neufaldt of California in the P. A.
A. meet last year at Berkeley.
Arthur should bolster up the
chances for the Stanford team in the
field events with places in the shot
and discus. Hartranft is practically
certain of first p:ace in uolli events,
and if Arthur continues to develop as
he did toward the end of last season,
he will probably place ahead of Rich
ards and Campbell.
