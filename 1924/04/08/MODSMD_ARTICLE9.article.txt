# INTRAMURAL NINES PLAY RAGGEDLY IN OPENERS
## A. T. O's Defeat Betas 7 to 6 In Initial Season Baseball Game 
### 
Two games and two defaults marked
the opening of the Intramural base
ball season yesterday. Alpha Tau
Omega outswatt'ed Beta Theta Pi, 7
to 6, in a game full of thrills. El Capi
tan swamped Theta Delta Chi, 19 to 1.
El Cuadro and Phi Kappa Sigma won
by default from Encina Fifth and
Fourth, respectively.
In the A. T. 0.-Beta game, Alpha
Tau Omega was the first to score. In
the latter half of the first, Hadley was
brought in on a two-bagger by Pe
gram. After stealing third, Pegram
came home on a passed ball. In the
second, Dorrestein made the circuit,
boosting the score to 3 to 0 in favor
of A. T. O.
Tibbe made the first Beta score,
coming home in the third after a two
bagger. The fourth inning evened the
score at 3-all, when a hit by Alexander
brought in Alabaster and Granger.
In the fifth, Forrest, of the Betas,
knocked a home run, which, however,
did not count, as the umpire declared
Forrest had not touched second. It was
some minutes before play could be re
sumed.
The sixth frame was a lucrative one
for A. T. O. With bases full, Van
Deusen scored on a passed ball. At
water came in on a sacrifice hit by
Koepfli, and Taylor was brought home
by Dorrestein's three-bagger, making
the score 6 to 3.
Betas Rally
With but one more inning and the
score against them, the Betas rallied.
