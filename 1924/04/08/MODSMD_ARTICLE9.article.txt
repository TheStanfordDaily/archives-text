# INTRAMURAL NINES PLAY RAGGEDLY IN OPENERS
## A. T. O's Defeat Betas 7 to 6 In Initial Season Baseball Game 
### 
Two games and two defaults marked
the opening of the Intramural base
ball season yesterday. Alpha Tau
Omega outswatt'ed Beta Theta Pi, 7
to 6, in a game full of thrills. El Capi
tan swamped Theta Delta Chi, 19 to 1.
El Cuadro and Phi Kappa Sigma won
by default from Encina Fifth and
Fourth, respectively.
In the A. T. 0.-Beta game, Alpha
Tau Omega was the first to score. In
the latter half of the first, Hadley was
brought in on a two-bagger by Pe
gram. After stealing third, Pegram
came home on a passed ball. In the
second, Dorrestein made the circuit,
boosting the score to 3 to 0 in favor
of A. T. O.
Tibbe made the first Beta score,
coming home in the third after a two
bagger. The fourth inning evened the
score at 3-all, when a hit by Alexander
brought in Alabaster and Granger.
In the fifth, Forrest, of the Betas,
knocked a home run, which, however,
did not count, as the umpire declared
Forrest had not touched second. It was
some minutes before play could be re
sumed.
The sixth frame was a lucrative one
for A. T. O. With bases full, Van
Deusen scored on a passed ball. At
water came in on a sacrifice hit by
Koepfli, and Taylor was brought home
by Dorrestein's three-bagger, making
the score 6 to 3.
Betas Rally
With but one more inning and the
score against them, the Betas rallied.
Dent Smith walked, Andrews singled,
Forrest singled, bringing in Andrews,
and Forrest scored after a caught fly.
The score was again tied, at 6-all.
Then Dorrestein ended the half by a
double play, catching Granger's fly and
touching Sproull off base.
Using the A. T. O.'s final chance to
score, Had ley bingled, Pegram lined
out a two-bagger, and Graves con*
nected, bringing in Hadley for the
winning run. Batteries for the game
were: Betas, Alabaster and Sproull;
A. T. 0., Taylor and Edwards.
The El Capitan-Theta Delta Chi
game was never in doubt. Metzgar
scored Theta Delt's lone run in the
first inning. Then began El Sapitan's
steady march around tue, diamond.
Two El Capitan men, Evans and
Marsh, scored in each inning. The
game was called at the end of the fifth.
Marsh pitched for El Capitan. Theta
Delt's regular pitcher was unable to
play, and Haley, who substituted, was
in no kind of condition.
Tomorrow's games: Sigma Nu vs.
Zeta Psi; Phi Kappa Psi vs. Sequoia
Second; El Campo vs. Sigma Alpha
Epsilon; Encina First vs. Phi Sigma
Kappa.
