Theta Xi and Sigma Chi emerged
victorious from yesterday's intramural
contests, defeating Delta Tau Delta,
4 to 3, and Alpha Delta Phi, 2 to 1,
respectively. Breakers and Kappa
Sigma won by default.
Collett, Delta Tau pitcher, struck
out thirteen men and allowed but one
hit. What might have been a shnt-out
was turned into a defeat by the Delta

4 to 3, and Alpha Delta Phi, 2 to 1,
respectively. Breakers and Kappa
Sigma won by default.

throw or a passed ball.
