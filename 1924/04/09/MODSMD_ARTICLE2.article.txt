# DR. JORDAN TO GIVE LECTURE SERIES ON RELIGION, SCIENCE
## 
### 
Beginning next Saturday at 10 a. m.,
Dr. Jordan will give a series of lec
tures on the general topic "Religion
and Science" in the Little Theater.
These lectures, according to Dr.
Jordan, will be "an 'effort to show
that knowledge, reverence and duty
cannot stand in natural or permanent
apposition. With love, these stand as
the culmination of the evolution of
life.
"Science and religion have the same
primal impulse and neither can do
without the other. Both have been
encrusted by the accretion of non
essentials, by which the true nature
of both has been historically conceal
ed. There is always a 'Warfare of
Science' for it is in constant revolt
against preconceived traditions, with
its own as well as with others."
The topics for the entire series are:
1. Scope of Science.
2. Scope of Religion.
o. Test of Truth; Need of Truth in
Conduct of Life; Need of Sense
of Duty.
4. Evolution, the Essence of Nature.
5. Warfare of Science.
6. Ethics; Its Science and Art.
