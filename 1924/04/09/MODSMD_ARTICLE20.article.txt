# BRONCOS FAIL 10 HIT NEVERS; CARDS WIN CONTEST 6-2
## Santa Clara Gets Only Four Hits; Johnston Knocks Homer in First 
### Bert Andrews 
The hurling of Ernie Nevers was
too much for the Broncs in yesterday's
game at Santa Clara, and the Cards
took the deciding tilt of the series, 6-2.
Nevers struck out six men and was
found for only four hits, none of which
went for more than a single.
Johnston Hits Homer in First
Roberts, lead-off man for the Cards,
reached first on an error by the Bronc
third-baseman. Bud Woodward beat
out a bunt to first, Roberts going to
second.
"Chuck" Johnston met a fast one
and clouted the ball to right for a
home run, scoring the two runners
ahead of him. McCandless was out,
third to first. May singled but Fuller
and Lawson, the next two batters,
went out, leaving May on base.
Santa Clara came back in its half
and tallied one counter. Maloney
singled to right and stole second.
Clancy got to first when McCandless
dropped his fly, Maloney going to
third. Ramlazzo grounded one to Rob
erts and was thrown out at first, Ma
loney scoring on the play. Nevers
tightened up and Santa Clara had to
be satisfied with the one run.
In the last half of the third inning,
Captain Woodward accepted three
chances in a row at short, throwing
the runners out at first.
In Stanford's half of the fourth,
"Lefty" May slammed one out past
the center fielder but after making the
rounds of the bases, was called out for I
failing to touch first.
Broncs Score Again
The Broncs' other run came in the |
fifth. Miller was hit by Nevers and ad- j
vanced one base on a single by
Marques. He scored when Mulchay;
threw Maloney's grounder wild to first. I
The Cards got two more in their
half of the sixth. Johnston singled
through second. McCaiulless beat out
a bunt, advancing Johnston, who stole I
third and came home on the third-'
baseman's error. McCandless scored
on Fuller's sacrifice bunt.
In the seventh, another run was
added to the Stanford score. Cudde
back walked. Nevers advanced him
on a sacrifice. Roberts walked and
Woodward singled, scoring Cuddeback.
The rest of the game was uneventful
save for a brief period in the ninth, j
Ernie Nevers, the Card pitcher, came
up to hit and lined out a double, j
There was only one out but Roberts [
made it two by flying out to right, j
and Woodward finished the inning by i
grounding to short.
Nevers and Johnston will form the
Stanford battery in the first game
against California Saturday. Mulchay j
will be back at short and Captain Bud !
Woodward will return to his old posi- i
tion at first. The remainder of the |
line-up will be the same as was used ,
against Santa Clara yesterday.
