Nevers struck out six men and was
found for only four hits, none of which
went for more than a single.

out a bunt to first, Roberts going to
second.
"Chuck" Johnston met a fast one
and clouted the ball to right for a
home run, scoring the two runners
ahead of him. McCandless was out,
third to first. May singled but Fuller
and Lawson, the next two batters,
went out, leaving May on base.
Santa Clara came back in its half
and tallied one counter. Maloney
singled to right and stole second.
Clancy got to first when McCandless
dropped his fly, Maloney going to
third. Ramlazzo grounded one to Rob
erts and was thrown out at first, Ma
loney scoring on the play. Nevers
tightened up and Santa Clara had to
be satisfied with the one run.
In the last half of the third inning,
Captain Woodward accepted three
chances in a row at short, throwing
the runners out at first.
In Stanford's half of the fourth,
"Lefty" May slammed one out past
