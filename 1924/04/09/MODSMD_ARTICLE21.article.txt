# CLARENCE C. WEST ELECTED TO LEAD FROSH TRACKSTERS
## 
### 
Clarence C. West, versatile athlete
from Alhambra high school, was elect
ed to lead the 1927 track squad as
captain last night by vote of his team
mates.
The new babe captain has the dis
tinction of being Coach "Dink" Tern
pleton's only five-event man, having
shown great promise in the high and
low sticks, relay, and broad and high
jumps, and will undoubtedly be en
tered in all, with the possible excep
tion of the broad jump, against the
California freshmen Saturday.
Holds Good Records
His records in the events are noth
ing to be sneezed at, moreover. His
0:16 flat and possible 0:25 4-5 in the
low and high sticks respectively com
pare very favorably with Enos, the
fast Blue and Gold entry in the two
races. As a relay man who seldom
runs the 440, he does well, for chances
are that he can turn in a time of 0:55
or less. Nineteen feet 6 inches is -easy
! meat for him as a broad jump per
formance and he rises to 5 feet 10
inches quite frequently in the high
jump.
Following West's election, he de
clined to make a lengthy speech ex
cept for the remark that "not one but
twenty or thirty teams will meet Cali
fornia Saturday and the result de
pends upon the individual efforts of
those twenty or thirty teams."
Field Events Are B«»t Bet
"Dink" seconded West's remarks
about individual efforts *>nd went on
! to give last-minute instructions and
advice to the men. He will be unable
to accompany them to Berkeley be
cause of the Southern Conference
meet here, but will place them in
charge of Track Manager Tucker.
According to "Dink," who followed
his advice with little dope, the field
events will be the best bet for the
Card babes. At least 30' points, nearly
half the meet, should easily be gar
nered in that part of the program, with
a few more added in the "breaks."
As for the track events, prospects
are fair for firsts in the high and low
hurdles, 220. and 440, with Schwab
of California taking a possible first in
the 100 and second in the 220.
West, "Dink" went on to say, looks
good for a first in the high hurdles,
and Spencer the same for the lows,
with Enos of California trailing sec
ond.

According to "Dink," who followed
his advice with little dope, the field
events will be the best bet for the
Card babes. At least 30' points, nearly
half the meet, should easily be gar
nered in that part of the program, with
a few more added in the "breaks."
As for the track events, prospects
are fair for firsts in the high and low
hurdles, 220. and 440, with Schwab
of California taking a possible first in
the 100 and second in the 220.
West, "Dink" went on to say, looks
good for a first in the high hurdles,
and Spencer the same for the lows,
with Enos of California trailing sec
ond.
Clarence C. West, versatile athlete
from Alhambra high school, was elect
ed to lead the 1927 track squad as
captain last night by vote of his team
mates.
The new babe captain has the dis
tinction of being Coach "Dink" Tern
pleton's only five-event man, having
shown great promise in the high and
low sticks, relay, and broad and high
jumps, and will undoubtedly be en
tered in all, with the possible excep
tion of the broad jump, against the
California freshmen Saturday.
Holds Good Records
His records in the events are noth
ing to be sneezed at, moreover. His
0:16 flat and possible 0:25 4-5 in the
low and high sticks respectively com
pare very favorably with Enos, the
fast Blue and Gold entry in the two
races. As a relay man who seldom
runs the 440, he does well, for chances
are that he can turn in a time of 0:55
or less. Nineteen feet 6 inches is -easy
! meat for him as a broad jump per
formance and he rises to 5 feet 10
inches quite frequently in the high
jump.
Following West's election, he de
clined to make a lengthy speech ex
cept for the remark that "not one but
twenty or thirty teams will meet Cali
fornia Saturday and the result de
pends upon the individual efforts of
those twenty or thirty teams."
Field Events Are B«»t Bet
"Dink" seconded West's remarks
about individual efforts *>nd went on
! to give last-minute instructions and
advice to the men. He will be unable
to accompany them to Berkeley be
cause of the Southern Conference
meet here, but will place them in
charge of Track Manager Tucker.
