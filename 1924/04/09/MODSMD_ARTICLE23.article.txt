Statistics given out by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in
dicate that college women, as a rule, live longer than women with less
education.
There are several reasons given for this by Dr. Dublin, statistician of
the insurance company. Among these causes are: the selective effect of
the secondary and collegiate process; the fact that college women, as a rule,
come from superior home environment which is conducive to better than
average health; regular physical exercise; college education is influential
toward the right conduct of life; the fact that, after graduation many col
lege women enter professional fields where the risk of death is at a
minimum.
These statements, coming from such a reliable and unprejudiced source,
are highly significant. They are merely by way of further proof of the
fact that the colleges and universities may be relied upon more and more
to produce the leaders of tomorrow.
Fifty or one hundred years ago, the fact that educated women lived
longer than their less fortunate sisters would have caused little stir. At
the present time, however, when women are playing such important roles
in the business, professional, and political world, such a fact cannot help
but receive a great deal of attention.
It is just this change in the position of women in our modern society
which has caused more of them to go to college to fit themselves for im
portant positions. Probably the greatest asset that a successful man or
woman can have is good health. If our colleges and universities are not
only training the minds of the men and women of tomorrow, but also
keeping them physically fit, they are measuring up, in the fullest extent,
to their duties.
