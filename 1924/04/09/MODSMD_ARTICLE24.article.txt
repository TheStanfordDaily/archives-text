# "Athletics for the Many"
## 
### 
Stanford is probably unique, at the present time, in having all five of
her major sports in full swing at the same time. While people across the
continent and even closer, are sweeping the snow off their porches and
front walks, football, baseball, basketball, track, and tennis players are
working out daily here.
In addition to major sport participants, many men are also engaged
regularly in minor sports. While Stanford is turning out athletic teams
which are gaining for her a reputation all over the United States, she is not
neglecting the men who are not fortunate enough to be of varsity calibre.
"Athletics for the many" is the slogan of the Physical Education De
partment. Minds that are trained at the expense of the body are prac
tically useless. Stanford realizes this important fact and she sends her
men and women out into the world prepared in both body and mind.
