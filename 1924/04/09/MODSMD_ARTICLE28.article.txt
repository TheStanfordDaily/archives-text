# SPORTS OF 1924
## HE WENT TO THREE OLYMPIADS 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The genial and efficient track coach at Dartmouth college has a three-fold
past. He has competed in three Olympiads, has won three Olympic champion
ships, and holds records in three-legged racing. Harry Hillman won the 400
metre run in the 1904 games in St. Louis, setting a record of 49 1-5 seconds,
which stood for eight years. He also won the 200 and 400 metre hurdle races,
and still holds the record for the shorter distance (that distance has not been
run since in the Olympic games, however). On board ship going to Athens in
1906 he was hit by a wave and banged against the rail of the boat, which
severely injured his left knee. In spite of this handicap he led for three
quarters of the race in the iinals of the 400 metre run. In 1908 he again
represented this country, this time at London, where he took second in the
400 metre hurdle race.
In three-legged racing Hillman and Lawson Robertson, now track coach at
Pennsylvania, ruled supreme in this country from 1905 to 1909. These two
birds could run 100 yards together in 11 seconds, which was going too fast
for the judges to see how many legs they were using.
