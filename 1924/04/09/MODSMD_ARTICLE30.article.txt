## FRANK FULLER 
### Bert Andrews 
(live Frank Fuller, who now pastimes
in the outfield for the Stanford varsity,
a few more years and he will probably
have played every position on a ball
team.
Fuller played on the Potter High
School club for three years at shortstop.
He was named captain of the team in his
senior year. Coming to college, he
caught on the '24 frosh team and was
sub-catcher on the varsity last year.
This is his second year on the varsity,
and Coach Wolter switched him to the
outfield, where he has been dividing his
time between left and center.
Fuller has an awkward position at the
plate, but manages to connect for his
share of base hits. He has been com
pared by his teammates to Max Carey of
the Pirates as regards his base-running
ability.
Frank pulls down the flics to the out
field in a fashion that makes his work
look easy, and he covers a lot of terri
tory.
He bats and throws right handed, is 22
years old and weighs around 160.
