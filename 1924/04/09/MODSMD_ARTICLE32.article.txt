# WASHINGTON GIVES MASTODON TUSK UNEARTHED BY SHOVEL
## 
### 
Two donations have recently been
received by the university museum,
that of a Mastodon tusk and a small
whale tooth. It comes from a beaked
whale and measures about seven
inches.
The tusk was unearthed by a steam
| shovel working for the Puget Sound
and Cascade railroad of the Clear Lake
Lumber Company. It was buried fifty
or sixty feet. Only the lower part of
the tusk was found. It is crumbling,
i showing it to be of great age.
The Mastodon is a mammal much
like the elephant. It has been extinct
for thousands of years and no com
plete specimen has ever been found.

More than 2,000,000 acres of land
in the State of Washington can be re
claimed for agricultural purposes
through irrigation, it is estimated.
