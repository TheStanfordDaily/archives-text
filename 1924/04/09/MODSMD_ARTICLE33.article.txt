# STANFORD SWIMMERS RETURN FROM MEETS
## 
### 
O'Connor, Fletcher, and White, who
represented Stanford at the intercol
legiate swimming meet at New York,
and at the A. A. U. meet at Chicago,
have returned to the campus.
The trip was very much of a success.
O'Connor won the 220- and 440-yard free
style swims at New York and established
a new intercollegiate record for those
distances. Fletcher placed second in the
220-yard breast stroke. White did not
compete in New York.
At Chicago, White won both the high
and low-board diving championships for
the second consecutive time. Here
O'Connor was unfortunate in the fact
that in each event he was in the same
preliminary heats with Johnnie Weiss
muller and was unable to qualify in spite
of the fact that he clocked the distances
in faster time than some of the men who
placed.
