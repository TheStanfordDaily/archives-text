# MISS H. M. BUNTING WILL ATTEND TWO EASTERN CONCLAVES
## 
### 
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, direc
tor of Roble gymnasium, will attend
conventions in Chicago and Kansas
City in April as official representative
of the Western Society of College Di
rectors of Physical Education for Wo
men. She was elected delegate at the
third annual conference of the society
held at Mills College April 3-5.
Miss Bunting will go to the con
vention of the Women's Section, Na
tional Amateur Athletic Federation,
April 21 and 22, at Chicago. In Kansas
City she will attend the Conference
of Association Directors of Physical
Education for Women in Colleges and
Universities.
In the opinion of Miss Bunting, a
number of interesting and helpful
talks were given during the Mills con
ference. Among them was "Posture
Training in Modern Medicine," by Dr.
Howard H. Martel of San Francisco,
in which he told that many ailments
are eliminated or greatly influenced by
correct posture. Miss Florence Alden,
of the University of Oregon, explained
an unusual posture campaign on that
campus. Even the trees were tagged,
showing their excellence of "posture."
A resolution was passed in which it
was decided to take steps toward re
organizing the methods of instruction
in the physical education departments
to make it comparable to that in the
general departments. This change
would leave time for essential re
search work in physical education.
