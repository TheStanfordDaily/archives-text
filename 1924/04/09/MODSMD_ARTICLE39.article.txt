## Five Men Are Potential Point Winners in Babe Contest

(Daily Californian)
California's babe track team is the
strongest in years. About five men
constitute the chief point getters and
the balance of the team, which is
large, works in well with these stars.
Rhodes and Schwab may be con
sidered as stars by their fine work in
the sprints. Schwab generally noses
out his running mate. He has done
10 1-10 in the century.
Bertillion stars in the quarter. His
running mates are House and Lane
and are both good. In the meet a week
ago Saturday the cubs scored a white
wash in this event.
Enos is the best hurdler to appear
on a first-year team for some time. He
gets a fast start and has not lost a
race this year. He has done the highs
in 0:15 3-5. Kinkead and Crick are his
running mates.
Schwobeda and Stevens are a good
pair of distance men. The former has
run the mile in 4:36 and has great en
durance.
The outstanding star of the team is
the tall high jumper, Hampton. He
did 6 feet 2 inches in the meet two
weeks ago and 6 feet 1 inch last week.
He goes about 21 feet in the broad
jump. Probert, Larue, and Bailey are
his understudies. Lutzi is a good
broad jumper.
Robinson is a fair pole vaulter.
Kirkland and Everett also work this
event.
The babes have a strong weight
squad in Cox, Anderson, Levy, Al
bright, Myers, Larson, Tampiiven, and
Dunham. Levy throws the discus fairly
well. Cox stars at the shot and Byers
and Dunham handle the spear in good
shape.
The relay squad is a swift team.
Rhodes, Schwab, Bertillion, Robinson
or Lutzi run this event. They do a
half mile around 1:38.
