# PIANO IS GREASED, READY FOR FRIDAY EVENING'S DANCE
## 
### 
The floor is waxed, the chandeliers
hung, the piano greased, and the doors
unlocked
Which is merely the quaint Old Eng
lish way of saying that everything is
ready for the All-University Dance to
be given at the Women's Clubhouse
on the campus Friday night. The event
is being sponsored by Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic fratern
ity.
Flats and sharps will be supplied by
the Mertz-Alabaster orchestra, who
will hit off the first note promptly at
nine o'clock.
In case it fails to ,rain, punch will be
available throughout the dance as a
thirst-quencher.
The usual Friday night poll-tax of
$1.10 per couple will be collected.
