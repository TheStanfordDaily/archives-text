# STRATTON DISCUSSES VARIETIES OF MIND
## Psychologist Explains Road Of Research Concerning Man and Religion 
### 
"Sectarian differences are really
differences of temperament and train
ing," said Professor George M. Strat
ton of the Psychology department of
the University of California, who spoke
last evening on "Where Psychology
Has Left Religion."
However, according to Stratton,
there are more sects in religion than
psychological classifications of people.
He says that the more one knows
about the human mind, the more toler
ant one is of the multiplicity of re
ligious sects, for one learns in psy
chology the variety of the human
mind.
Sects According to Nature
"Foundations for the different sects
are seen in the different tempera
ments, to which various things ap
peal," he said. "Some are interested in
the intellect, and want religion by
thinking.
"Some can't understand the intellec
tual viewpoint, but want quiet appre
ciation. They say, 'Let a man know
nothing, if his deeds be right'." Strat
ton says that people should be put
where others will sympathize with
their viewpoint and should be taken
away from those who irritate them.
Thus we have so many creeds.
Religion Ancient Cure
"Religion," he defined, "is one of
the oldest historical means of curing
self. It is something to make man
know his place."
Distinguishing religion from science,
Stratton explained, "Religion is an
attempt to do something that science
does not do. Science explains facts.
Religions shows a man right purposes,
adjustment to life.
"When one comes to a right under
standing of religion and psychology,
one sees that there is no substitution
of one for the other, but that each has
its own place.
Need Knowledge of Living
"Now, the need in the scientific
world is of academic education, not
discarding works of science. We need
something for the art of living, to
make our knowledge of living really
productive," was Stratton's belief.
Questioning whether the mind is, as
some scientists claim, a machine, be
cause it works regularly, Stratton
said, "Laws are our way of formulat
ing the way the mind performs. If
the orderly workings of the mind re
semble machinery there is no reason
for it being so. A watch has no
thoughts, no purpose, no reflection on
the future, no imagination, and no re
action to circumstances. Yet minds
appreciate these things, the atmos
phere, surroundings."
Mind Demands Deep Study
In telling of pseudo-utterances of
psychology which seem to make re
ligion impossible, Stratton described
the extreme behaviorists, who are so
bent upon the scientific that they are
convinced that study can be made
only of things that can be photo
graphed or definitely seen.
As a result they find mind in only
their narrow way, while the mind is
really complicated so that one should
use every possible means of studying
it.
