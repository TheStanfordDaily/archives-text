# JOFFRE DEBATERS MEET CALIFORNIA ORATORS TONIGHT
## Weigel, Littler, and Bailey to Represent Stanford in Forensic Clash 
### 
With three strong speakers, Robert
Littler, Thomas Bailey, and Stanley
Weigel, Stanford has a good chance to
win for the third consecutive time
from California in the annual Joffre
medal debate at Berkeley tonight.
Knox Miller in 1922 and Bertram!
Comparet in 1923 carried off firsts for
the Cardinal.
Individual Winner Given Medal
The man considered the best speak
er by the judges wins the Joffre
medal for himself and the debate for
the university.
Under the rules of the contest, the
general subject, "French Political
Policy Since the War," was chosen
several months ago. Some specific
question under that head will be an
nounced at 6 o'clock, two hours before
the debate commences.
Littler, the first Stanford speaker,
is said by Pacific Coast coaches to be
one of the best extempernneous ar
guers in years. He is a transfer from
Willamette University.
Bailey Is Tri-State Winner
Bailey, a successful debater for
three seasons, will speak second. He
helped to win the decision over Cali
fornia in the Tri-State debate in Janu
ary.
Weigel is the third entry. Although
only a sophomore, he has already ac
quired a reputation for ease and as
surance in speaking.
Paul Stanbury and Bernard Witkin
are two of the three men who will
represent California. Stanbury won for
the Blue and Gold against British
Columbia.
Records to Be Taken
Five judges will officiate instead of
the usual three. They are: Percy B.
Long, San Francisco attorney; John
L. McNab, former state attorney-gen
eral; Thomas Rickerd, San Francisco
mining expert; and two others not
yet selected.
Phonographic records of the speech
es will be taken by the California
Publicv Speaking department for use
in future reference. This is by way of
an experiment, supplanting the usual
shorthand reports.
