# SMALL COLLEGE ATHLETES HOPE TO DOWN CARDS
## Southerners Have Chance to Repeat Victory of Last Year 
### 
Southern California dopesters can
'Only give the universities of the South
ern Conference a slim chance to defeat
Stanford Saturday, when the two track
teams meet on the varsity oval.
Dope points to a close meet with a
victory for Stanford, say the Los An
geles critics, but the southern schools
must be conceded a chance because of
the surprise they pulled last year, when
they nosed out the Cards 74 to 66. The
theory seems to be that Argue, Buck
man. Maxwell, and Co. might be able
lo make history repeat itself.
However, Stanford is much stronger
now than last year. On the other hand,
the southern schools seem to have about
the same number of high class perform
ers as before. Twenty-nine men will
make the trip to Palo Alto to compete
against the Cards, and with a team of
this size they should lie able to garner
enough second and thirds, in addition
to their first places, to bring the score
dangerously near to that of Stanford.
Argue and Buckman May Place.
Southern fans are picking both Argue
and Buckman to place ahead of Hale in
the century. Argue has been running
less than 10 flat and in all of these
races Ruckman has been right on his
heels. The train ride from Los Angeles
to Palo Alto is bound to have some ef
fect upon the visiting trackmen, which
will give the Redshirts a slight advant
age. Lan Campbell beat Argue last
year in 10 flat, but he is not expected
to repeat Saturday. Hale has been
winning the hundred easily all season,
and is bound to give Argue a close
race. He should be so close to the Oc
cidental star, if not ahead of him, that
Buckman will have no opportunity to
get a second.
Maxwell is another man whom the
southerners are picking to win. He
tied Leistner for third place in the high
hurdles la at year, and beat hpn out of
second place in the lows. His run
ning has shown a marked improvement
this season, and his times have fre
quently been close to record breaking.
Leistner is being boosted for a place on
the Olympic games team, as is Max
well, and the barrier races Saturday
should decide which one of the hurdlers
most deserves such a position.
Another event which is expected to
be closely contested is the mile run.
Nick Carter, Occidental, placed third
in the mile last year, but has developed

markedly since then. The southerners
figure that he has a goo<l chance of
beating Bill Kerr.
The only other race which the in
vaders have a good chance to win is
the mile relay. Spangler, Powers,
Buckman, and Ellsworth of Occidental
form ahout as fast a combination as can
be found in the country. The Occi
dental team won the relay last year and
has been going better than ever in the
early season meets. If necessary Gard
ner of Pomona can be pressed into the
running, which will considerably add to
the strength of the southern baton
passers.

to their first places, to bring the score
dangerously near to that of Stanford.
Argue and Buckman May Place.
Southern fans are picking both Argue
and Buckman to place ahead of Hale in
the century. Argue has been running
less than 10 flat and in all of these
races Ruckman has been right on his
heels. The train ride from Los Angeles
to Palo Alto is bound to have some ef
fect upon the visiting trackmen, which
will give the Redshirts a slight advant
age. Lan Campbell beat Argue last
year in 10 flat, but he is not expected
to repeat Saturday. Hale has been
winning the hundred easily all season,
and is bound to give Argue a close
race. He should be so close to the Oc
cidental star, if not ahead of him, that
Buckman will have no opportunity to
get a second.
Maxwell is another man whom the
southerners are picking to win. He
tied Leistner for third place in the high
hurdles la at year, and beat hpn out of
second place in the lows. His run
ning has shown a marked improvement
this season, and his times have fre
quently been close to record breaking.
Leistner is being boosted for a place on
the Olympic games team, as is Max
well, and the barrier races Saturday
should decide which one of the hurdlers
most deserves such a position.
Another event which is expected to
be closely contested is the mile run.
Nick Carter, Occidental, placed third
in the mile last year, but has developed

markedly since then. The southerners
figure that he has a goo<l chance of
beating Bill Kerr.
The only other race which the in
vaders have a good chance to win is
the mile relay. Spangler, Powers,
Buckman, and Ellsworth of Occidental
form ahout as fast a combination as can
be found in the country. The Occi
dental team won the relay last year and
has been going better than ever in the
early season meets. If necessary Gard
ner of Pomona can be pressed into the
running, which will considerably add to
the strength of the southern baton
passers.

Twenty-four were pledged to Phi
Beta Kappa at Indiana university re
cently.
Southern California dopesters can
'Only give the universities of the South
ern Conference a slim chance to defeat
Stanford Saturday, when the two track
teams meet on the varsity oval.
Dope points to a close meet with a
victory for Stanford, say the Los An
geles critics, but the southern schools
must be conceded a chance because of
the surprise they pulled last year, when
they nosed out the Cards 74 to 66. The
theory seems to be that Argue, Buck
man. Maxwell, and Co. might be able
lo make history repeat itself.
However, Stanford is much stronger
now than last year. On the other hand,
the southern schools seem to have about
the same number of high class perform
ers as before. Twenty-nine men will
make the trip to Palo Alto to compete
against the Cards, and with a team of
this size they should lie able to garner
enough second and thirds, in addition
to their first places, to bring the score
dangerously near to that of Stanford.
