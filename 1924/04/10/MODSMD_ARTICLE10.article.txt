# DICTIONARY SET IS SHOWN AT LIBRARY
## 
### 
A collection of dictionaries is 011 ex
hibit on the second floor of the Library.
The collection is very complete, and is
the property of the Library. Many of
the volumes were a part of the Flugal
gift to the institution.
The history of dictionaries is shown
by the arrangement of the books. The
first is a photo-lithograph of an eighth
century Latin and Old English glos
sary. In 1499 the first real Latin-Eng
lish dictionary was published. A French-
English dictionary was composed in
1514 when Mary Tudor became the un
willing bride of Louis XII of France,
for the purpose of initiating her into
her husband's tongue. Many editions
of English dictionaries followed, and in
1755 Samuel Johnson's "Dictionary of
the English Language" appeared. Noah
Webster published his first dictionary
in 1828; this has been revised many
times, and now is "Webster's New In
ternational Dictionary."
