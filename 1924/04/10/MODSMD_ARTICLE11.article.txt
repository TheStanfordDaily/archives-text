# Bruin Nine Hits Mid-Season Slump After Early Victories
## 
### 
California's baseball team, like the
Card varsity, has had its troubles.
That is the big point brought out by
a study of the record of the Blue and
Gold club. California ran, a good race
at the start of the year, but stumbled in
mid-season and lias had lots of trouble
in getting back to a standing position.
St. Mary's handed the Berkeley team
two defeats, just squeezing through
with a win in the first game, but mak
ing a thorough job of it in the second.
Santa Clara picked on the Bears in
an eleven inning game and finished
ahead.
On the southern trip of the Blue and
Gold, U. S. C. jumped on Russell, the
Cal hurler, in one inning and broke up
the first game.
A double header between the two
teams several days later, resulted in two
victories for the Bears. The Trojan
support was terrible in these contests
and partly accounted for California's
triumph.
California apparently has a world of
pitching material, with Nounan, Rus

sell, and Minty, doing most of the work.
Jack Nounan is the leading Bear
twirler and has made a fine early sea
son record. He has averaged one
strike-oiit an inning and has allowed
but one hit to every innings
pitched.
Russell has done fair work hut in
every game he hurled tht* year he
has had one bad inning. This has
brought dowvi, hU effectiveness some
what.
*Â»iinty held U. S. C. to four hits in
lire second Trojan game.
Kelley, who beat the Cards twice in
last year's series, has been pitching in
and out ball this year but may come
through in the series.
Gould, McEneany, and Toomey make
up the rest of the staff.
Captain Duffy Geriach covers the hot
corner for California and is aided in the
infield by an experienced combination.
King, at short, was out of the game for
a time with a sore arm, but is expected
to be at top form in the first contest of
the series.
