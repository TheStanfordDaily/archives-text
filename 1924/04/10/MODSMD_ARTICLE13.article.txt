# BEAR TRACK SQUADS UNBEATEN BY BABES IN FOURTEEN YEARS
## High Jump Record of 1906 Stands 14 Years; Meeks, Hoffman Good 
### Douglas Meservey 
Track victories for Stanford fresh
men in years past have been far less
lrequent than those garnered by the
varsity. In fact, not once has a Cardi
nal babe track team triumphed over a
team flying the Blue and Gold colors.
Ever since Trainer "Dad" Moulton
and his squad of freshmen first at
tempted in 1906 to take the measure
of California, fourteen consecutive de
feats have been recorded against the
Stanford yearlings. No Stanford-Cali
fornia freshman meets were held from
1912 to 1915 inclusive.
Times and marks in the days of *06,
particularly those made by yearlings
fresh from high schools, which at that
time had few track coaches, did not
compare with those chalked up now.
For example, in the first meet the
century was won in 0:10 3-5; the fur
long in 0:23 4-5; the 440 in 0:55 1-5;
the 880 in 2:12; the mile in 5:03 1-5;
and the two-mile in 10:49.
Hurdles Are Slow
The hurdles fared even worse with
0:18 flat and 0:28 flat recorded as
times for the low and high sticks re
spectively.
Some of the field events, -especially
the high jump, brought out good ma
terial and competition. A mark of 6
feet 2 inches in the high jump, made
by Hall of California, stood for 14
years when "Brick" Muller, also of
California, came along and bettered it
seven-eighths of an inch.
Twenty feet 11 1-2 inches won the
broad jump; 10 feet 3 1-2 inches the
pole vault; 39 feet 7 1-4 inches the
shot put; and 114 feet 1-2 inch the
hammer throw.
All of these marks and times have
been bettered once or more during the
past 18 years and from late perform
ances it looks as though at least two
records will be nicked in the babe
meet at Berkeley Saturday. Hoffman
has already broken the discus mark of
; 129 feet 6 inches, made by Francis of
California last year, with a heave of
137 feet 4 inches; and Meeks has come
| several times within a few inches of
| the 22 feet, 4 inch broad jump record.
Cards on Sick List
In 1907, the Cards lost u number of
i men through sickness the week before
; the meet, but two arose from sick-beds
: to enter. One, Helsley, captured sec
; ond in the high hurdles, and tied for
first honors in the lows with a Cali
j fornia man, besides running a lap of
! the relay. The other, Shelton, finished
j third in a gruelling two-mile.
In 1919, the Stanford babes were
j badly defeated 89 to 24 but Captain
| Schlaudeman accounted for half of the
Card points, being entered in five
events and placing in three.
Five records were smashed in 1921,
although the Cards lost by the second
largest score that has ever been cred
| ited to a California freshman teamâ€”
94 1-4 to 36 1-4. Eddie Sudden,
Cardinal sprinter, left the other dash
men floundering behind him and es
tablished records of 0:10 flat and 0:22
j flat for the century and furlong re
j spectively.
Records Smashed
The other three records went to the
I Bruins. Bowman's time of 2:01 1-5 in
j the 880 undershot the old time bv
; 1 4-5 seconds. The two-mile was won
j by Fisk in 10 minutes 7 4-5 seconds.
! The fifth mark was set in the field by
i Harris, who heaved the javelin a dis
j tance of 158 feet 7 inches.
! t Total points made in each meet are
as follows:

There are nearly 700 special occu
pations listed in the United States
census reports. Of these only 35 have
no women representatives.
