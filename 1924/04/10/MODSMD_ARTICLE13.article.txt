# BEAR TRACK SQUADS UNBEATEN BY BABES IN FOURTEEN YEARS
## High Jump Record of 1906 Stands 14 Years; Meeks, Hoffman Good 
### Douglas Meservey 
Track victories for Stanford fresh
men in years past have been far less
lrequent than those garnered by the
varsity. In fact, not once has a Cardi
nal babe track team triumphed over a
team flying the Blue and Gold colors.
Ever since Trainer "Dad" Moulton
and his squad of freshmen first at
tempted in 1906 to take the measure
of California, fourteen consecutive de
feats have been recorded against the
Stanford yearlings. No Stanford-Cali
fornia freshman meets were held from
1912 to 1915 inclusive.
Times and marks in the days of *06,
particularly those made by yearlings
fresh from high schools, which at that
time had few track coaches, did not
compare with those chalked up now.
For example, in the first meet the
century was won in 0:10 3-5; the fur
long in 0:23 4-5; the 440 in 0:55 1-5;
the 880 in 2:12; the mile in 5:03 1-5;
and the two-mile in 10:49.
Hurdles Are Slow
The hurdles fared even worse with
0:18 flat and 0:28 flat recorded as
times for the low and high sticks re
spectively.
Some of the field events, -especially
the high jump, brought out good ma
terial and competition. A mark of 6
feet 2 inches in the high jump, made
by Hall of California, stood for 14
years when "Brick" Muller, also of
California, came along and bettered it
seven-eighths of an inch.
Twenty feet 11 1-2 inches won the
broad jump; 10 feet 3 1-2 inches the
pole vault; 39 feet 7 1-4 inches the
shot put; and 114 feet 1-2 inch the
hammer throw.
All of these marks and times have
been bettered once or more during the
past 18 years and from late perform
ances it looks as though at least two
records will be nicked in the babe
meet at Berkeley Saturday. Hoffman
has already broken the discus mark of
