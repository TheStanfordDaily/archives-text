### Alfred Post 
Delivering what coaches declared to
be the best extemperaneous speech
ever given In an intercollegiate de
bate on the coast. Robert Littler of
Stanford captured the Joft're medal at
Berkeley last night in competition
with University of California arguers.
Littler is the third Cardinal orator
in as many years to place first. H. R.
Cherninn and B. E. Witkin of Cali
fornia tied for second honors.
More than 2000 people packed
Wheeler hall to hear the speakers.
"Resolved, that the present French
alliances are a menace to the world"
was the question. Professor Arthur
Holcombe of Harvard anouuced the
subject at 6 o'clock, thus giving the
debaters two hours in which to com
pose their speeches.
Littler Supports Negative
Littler, with Thomas Bailey of Stan
lord and Paul Stanbury of California
defended the negative. He was the
last of the six competitors to deliver
his address. Stanley Weigel was the
third Cardinal speaker, upholding the
affirmative with Cherninn and Witkin
of California.
The winner maintained that any na
tion which joins forces with other
nations to protect itself from obvious
danger when there are no other means
of protection is not a menace but rath
er a security to the peace of the world.
By showing that Germany was pre
paring to attack France as soon as she
is strong enough, Littler justified
French alliances on the ground of ab
solute necessity.
Weigel, number one man on the pro
gram, made a strong bid for first place.
He displayed great versatility of argu
meat, and had a marked audience ap
peal. Bailey also spoke well.
Witkin and Cherninn, California
speakers who tied for second place, en
deavored to show that French alli
ances perpetuated the balance of
power idea in Europe and are thus a
potential cause of war. Witkin, who
received one vote for first honors,
gave an exceptionally clear analysis.
His colleague spoke deliberately, ex
hibiting a wide range of vocabulary.
Judges of the debate were: John L.
McNab, former state attorney-general;
Percy V. Long, San Francisco attor
ney; and Thomas A. Richard, mining
expert.
