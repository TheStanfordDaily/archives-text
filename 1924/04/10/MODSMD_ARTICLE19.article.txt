# The 						Housing Plan
## 
### 
The housing plan for next year, which was announced yesterday very
nicely takes care of a problem which threatened to be serious. Those
freshmen who are now living in Encina, and do not go into fraternities,
will have an opportunity to live any place on the campus.
In this way they will be scattered all over the campus, and will have
representatives in every group. It will be necessary for them to vacate
Encina in favor of the incoming freshmen and in view of the fact that they
must go, it is an excellent idea to give them their choice of living accom
modations.
Graduate students on the fifth floor, and freshmen and sponsors on
the other live, will take care of Encina. This is an excellent idea, inasmuch
as it gives the grads a quiet place to study and still clears the parts of the
hall where the freshman will live of all upper classmen but sponsors.
Eighty per cent of the rooms in Toyon and Branner not reserved
again by present occupants will be thrown open to freshmen now living in
Encina. This provision should take care of almost all those men, who
will be sophomores, who desire to live in either of the new dormitories.
Fifty per cent of the vacancies in Sequoia will be open to Lower Di
vision students from Encina and Sequoia. This is a fair provision inas
much as those majoring in medicine or science will probably want to take
advantage of the latter's proximity to their department buildings.
Although the Union will be open primarily to upperclassmen, under
classmen will not be prohibited from living there.
The housing situation this year has been cleared up a great deal by the
addition of Toyon and Branner. With the sponsor system under which
freshmen live in Encina one year, working well, there should be little
trouble in housing every man in the university next year. With graduates
out of Toyon and Branner, and all the freshmen in Encina, the pressure
for rooms in the two new halls will be relieved.
