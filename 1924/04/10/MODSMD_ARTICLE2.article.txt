# TRYOUTS FOR MOVIE OF STANFORD LIFE WILL BE ON MONDAY
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Stanford motion pic
ture are to be held at 1:30 p. m. Monday
in front of the Mausoleum.
At the tryouts brief pictures will be
taken with a few feet of film each, and
developed at once. Students will be
asked to read a letter or register some
emotion such as the character in ques
tion would be expected to express. As
soon as these strips of films are devel
oped the pictures will be cast and scenes
"'shot" at once.
Students are asked particularly not to
look into the camera when the pictures
are being taken. They should go about
their business, be natural and not pose,
but leave it to Mr. Nichols to catch the
grouping or mass scenes as he can.
Some special mass scenes will be
staged.
The winning scenario by Robert
Fitzgerald, author of "Michael's
Mother" which was produced in the As
sembly Hall last quarter, is to be sup
plemented by a special series of scenes
in a sub-plot taken from Evelyn Brow
nell's manuscript. ]Vliss Brownell, who
wrote the Stanford Pageant, is now in
corporating these scenes. Certain views
of Stanford which were contained in a
manuscript submitted under the title
of "Stanford the Beautiful" will also be
used. The author of this manuscript
is asked to see Professor Gray about it
in order that this arrangement may be
definitely made and his name an
nounced.
The prize of $100 was handed this
morning to Robert Fitzgerald by the
committee. The film is to be owned by
Stanford, and is a permanent record of
Stanford life. It is not a commercial
venture.
