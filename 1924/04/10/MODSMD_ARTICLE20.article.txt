# Help!
## 
### 
Stanford University and Palo Alto have been asked to raise $4,200 of
$450,000 to be gotten in California for the relief of ill-nourished children
of Germany.
There will be no organized campaign including personal solicitation on
the campus. Contributions will rest entirely with the students. Dr. Mur
ray, who is in charge of the work here, has made a plea for a large num
ber of small subscriptions rather than a small number of large ones.
Ten million dollars is the sum set to be raised in the United States.
The cause is a very worthy one, as hundreds of thousands of children are
starving in Germany. These children were not the ones 011 whom the
Allies made war, and they were in no way responsible. . Germany needs
a great deal of help if she is ever to get back on her feet and the surest
way to give this help is to feed her starving boys and girls.
The fact that Dr. Wilbur is the state chairman of the drive should give
it added impetus on the campus.
