### 
"Women have won a definite, per
manent place in the art of picture pro
duction, apart from acting," according
to Will H. Hays, president of the Mo
tion Picture Producers and Distributers
of America.
A recent articlc in the News-Bulletin
of the Bureau of Vocational Informa
tion went on to say that women have
been most successful in scenario and
continuity writing. Their achieve
ments have been both financial and ar
tistic, for the salary of one woman
writer, June Mathias, exceeds that of
the president of the United States.
Title writers and cutters have also
found an important place in the mo
tion picture industry.
