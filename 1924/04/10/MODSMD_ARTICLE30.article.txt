# Clubhouse Board to Give Bridge-Dance on Saturday
## 
### 
All bridge sharks and dancers will be
given a chance to perform Saturday
night in the Women's Clubhouse at the
price of one dollar per person.
l*or the benefit of those who do not
wish to dance, provisions for bridge
and Mali Jongg playing have been
made. Excellent music in the form of
the Mertz-Alabaster orchestra has been
secured by the Women's Clubhouse
Board.
.The proceeds of the dance will be
used to pay the Clubhouse debt which,
despite the profit-sharing plan of the
Stanford Bookstore, still lingers over
the building.
Operations will begin at 9 p. m.
