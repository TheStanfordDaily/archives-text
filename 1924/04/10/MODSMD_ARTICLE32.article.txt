# Who's Who On Card Baseball Squad
## "CHUCK" JOHNSTON 
### Bert Andrews 
If you see a husky ballplayer on the
Card varsity who resembleß Milton
! Sills the screen actor —it is Charles
("Chuck") Johnston.
"Chuck" may be the better looking
j of the two, but Sills gets paid for his
beauty.
Johnston is another of the Card ball
players who was elected captain of
his high school team. He played on
the Los Angeles Poly nine for three
years and led the club while he was
a senior. During all of this time, he
worked behind the bat.
"Chuck" played on the 1925 frosli
team and shared his time among three
positions. In some games he caught,
and in others played on first and in
the outfield.
This is Johnston's first year on the
varsity and he has duplicated his
freshman record as to the number of
positions held down. At the present
time it is likely that he will be the
backstop in the first California game.
Johnston is 6 feet tall, weighs 185,
and bats and throws right handed*
