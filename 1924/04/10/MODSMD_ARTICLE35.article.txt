# Sciences, Inexact and Exact, to Be Discussed
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will discuss "Science,
Exact and Inexact," this evening at
7:30 at his residence. "Science," says
Dr. Jordan, "is human experience test
ed and set in order. When stated in
terms of human experience it is truth.
To those whose experience gives them
the power to understand such terms
exact and inexact are relative terms.
"In a positive sense no science can
be exact. It has no certainty of divine
accuracy in its data, hut it has a
pragmatic exactness In a million direc
tions and can in a measure define and
bound its own ignorance."
