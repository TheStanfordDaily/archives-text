# Varsity Football Eleven Will Have Fast, Heady Ends
## 
### Walter Campbell 
.There's a beginning and an end to
every football game. Hut the end
should be the stronger, so Coach Glenn
"Pop" Warner is grooming lip as good
a quartet of ends as will be seen any
where next season.
The veteran Captain Jim Lawson will
hold down one of the wing positions.
Of that there is no doubt since he is
one of the best seen on the "Farm" in
recent years. His capable handling of
the position last season win him several
first place selections on all-coast teams
as well as the respect of those who
faced him in action.
Good on Defense.
Lawson is at his best on the defense.
It takes an exceptional halfback, ac
companied by no small degree of luck,
to break around the veteran's flank. If
in doubt, refer to Mr. Don Nichols, late
of the California varsity. On the of
fensive, Lawson is a streak, although
he has been handicapped by a bad leg.
Among the other candidates for end
ar<4 Thomas and Middleton, both wear
ers of the varsity block "S." Thomas
! played the left flank last season, receiv
ing the call over Middleton. Middleton,
however, came fast toward the end of
| the season, and put up a strong battle
I for the job. Thomas is essentially a
| defensive player, while Middleton
shines brightest when advancing the
ball.
Babe Captain Is Fast.
Fred Swan, captain of the 1927 babe
eleven and a former Olympic Club
player, must be counted strongly in the
! run. Swan is considered to be one of
I the sweetest football satellites that has
I struck the campus in recent years. His
Olympic Club training stands him in
j good stead for varsity experience, since
the Post Street club meets practically
the same teams as does Stanford. Swan
is a sure tackier and fast on his feet.
' Whether he can demonstrate an edge
| over Thomas and Middleton is a prob
| lem, but he should surely figure promi
| nently in the games next autumn.
Two other candidates are McDer
mont, who scored a touchdown on a
I pass' against the Olympic Club, and
Ted Shipkey from the frosh.
