## HENRY S. LYNE 
### 
Alumni still talk of the battle for'
heavyweight honors away back in
1912 when Henry Lyne wrested the
title from Fred Watkins, giant crew
man and boxer.
Lyne worked his way up from light
weight champion to heavyweight and,
in a bout fought before a crowd which
filled to capacity the old Encina gym
nasium, beat the dreaded Watkins.
At the outbreak of the World War,
Lyne enlisted in an Australian regi-!
ment with his fellow-countrymen, was i
gassed and wounded and sent to Eng-,
land to recuperate. When well, he 1
again joined the Anzacs and for the
second time was gassed and wounded,
this time convalescing in France.
While in the second hospital, he re
ceived three different citations for
bravery, coolness under fire, and lead
ership in action. These were followed
by an award of the Military Cross of
England, second in honor only to the
prized Victoria Cross.
Lyne is now working for his govern
ment in Australia at the profession he
was delayed so long in putting into
practice—geology.
The Henry S. Lyne medal is up for
the Junior light-heavyweight cham
pion of the university.
