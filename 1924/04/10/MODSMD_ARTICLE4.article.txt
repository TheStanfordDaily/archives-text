# LOP-SIDED SCORES GIVE INTRAMURAL TEAMS VICTORIES
## Superior Pitching Accounts For Wins in Four Ball Games 
### 
Lop-sided scores were the order of
the day in intramural baseball yester
day, when Sigma Nu, El Campo, Phi
Sigma Kappa and Phi Kappa Psi won
by wide margins.
Sigma Nu, last year's pennant win
ners, downed Zeta Psi, 16 to 7. The
first two innings looked like a real ball
game, the count standing 2 to 1 in favor
of Sigma Nu. Then Dickey, Zete
chucker. blew up, and Sigma Nu gar
nered eleven runs before the fireworks
subsided. Dickey was ditched for
Lovelace, who held his opponents to
three additional runs.
Aydelott pitched the first four frames
for Sigma Nu, allowing four hits and
two runs. Dwight pitched the other
three, in which the Zetes gathered five
tallies.
El Campo Wins.
El Campo pulled a surprise by
swamping Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 12 to
4. S. A. E. went to the finals of the
series last year. Strong started the
game for S. A. E. He was nicked just
once in the first two innings, and then,
after striking out two men in the third,
went up in the air, and El Campo
stored up seven runs. Murphy, who
succeeded him, allowed the clubmen
five more tallies in the fifth, and then
settled down to airtight ball.
George Smith, delivering for El
Campo, scattered his hits, and the most
5. A. E. could do was four counts, Har
rell and McDermont coming in in the
third, Harrell again in the fifth and
Gibbons in the sixth.
Sequoia Second was another team
without a pitcher, succumbing to Phi
Kappa Psi, 14 to 5. Bumbaugh, who
started the fracas for the Phi Psi's,
struck out eight men in six innings.
McCallister, substituting in the sixth,
whiffed out two and allowed one bingle.
Bumbaugh-and McCallister starred also
at bat, getting on base each time they
were up.
Through superior mound and team
work, Phi Sigma Kappa defeated En- j
cina I" irst, 14 to 4. Johnson, twirling
for the winners, allowed four runs in j
the first two frames, and after that shut (
out the Encina team completely. Sheets. I
Encina chucker, was impregnable for j
the first frame, and then blew.

Sequoia Second was another team
without a pitcher, succumbing to Phi
Kappa Psi, 14 to 5. Bumbaugh, who
started the fracas for the Phi Psi's,
struck out eight men in six innings.
McCallister, substituting in the sixth,
whiffed out two and allowed one bingle.
Bumbaugh-and McCallister starred also
at bat, getting on base each time they
were up.
Through superior mound and team
work, Phi Sigma Kappa defeated En- j
cina I" irst, 14 to 4. Johnson, twirling
for the winners, allowed four runs in j
the first two frames, and after that shut (
out the Encina team completely. Sheets. I
Encina chucker, was impregnable for j
the first frame, and then blew.
Tomorrow's games: Los Arcos vs.
Alpha Sigma Phi; Delta Chi vs. Phi
Gamma Delta; Sequoia First vs. El
Toro.
Lop-sided scores were the order of
the day in intramural baseball yester
day, when Sigma Nu, El Campo, Phi
Sigma Kappa and Phi Kappa Psi won
by wide margins.
Sigma Nu, last year's pennant win
ners, downed Zeta Psi, 16 to 7. The
first two innings looked like a real ball
game, the count standing 2 to 1 in favor
of Sigma Nu. Then Dickey, Zete
chucker. blew up, and Sigma Nu gar
nered eleven runs before the fireworks
subsided. Dickey was ditched for
Lovelace, who held his opponents to
three additional runs.
Aydelott pitched the first four frames
for Sigma Nu, allowing four hits and
two runs. Dwight pitched the other
three, in which the Zetes gathered five
tallies.
El Campo Wins.
El Campo pulled a surprise by
swamping Sigma Alpha Epsilon, 12 to
4. S. A. E. went to the finals of the
series last year. Strong started the
game for S. A. E. He was nicked just
once in the first two innings, and then,
after striking out two men in the third,
went up in the air, and El Campo
stored up seven runs. Murphy, who
succeeded him, allowed the clubmen
five more tallies in the fifth, and then
settled down to airtight ball.
George Smith, delivering for El
Campo, scattered his hits, and the most
5. A. E. could do was four counts, Har
rell and McDermont coming in in the
third, Harrell again in the fifth and
Gibbons in the sixth.
