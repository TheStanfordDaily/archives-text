# RIESE HEADS BATTING AVERAGE FOR FROSH BASEBALL PLAYERS
## 
### 
Riese, fielder and pitcher for the J
Cardinal yearling nine, leads bis team
mates in hitting with an average of
.541 for the season. He made 1 home
run. 1 three-base hit, 2 two-base hits,
and 9 singles during the 24 times he |
was at bat.
David followed a close second with
8 hits out of 18 times to bat. Collins
appears to have the best batting aver
age of the regular moundsmen, being
fifth highest with an average of .3GO.
He made 9 hits out of 25 times at the
plate. Osthaus was sixth on the list
with an average of .350, making 13 ;
hits out of 37 times at bat.
The average for the squad is .304
but the average of the regular nine
would figure close to the .350 mark.
Morrill Plays Every Inning
Morrill is the only man on the team
who has not missed an inning of play
during the season. Out of 67 times to
bat he made 17 hits or an average of
.253. His hitting in the last five games
shows much higher than this but a
slump at the first of the season has
dragged his average down.
Linquest, out of 58 times at the bat,
has made 2 home-runs, 2 three-base
hits, 2 two-base hits, and 13 singles.
In the Lick-Wilmerding game he made
a home-run, a double, and a single, out
of three times at bat.
This average should be the cause of
some worry to the California cubs who
tackle the freshmen Saturday in the
first game of the Big-Little series on
the varsity field at 3:30.
