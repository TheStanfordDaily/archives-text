# BOXERS LEAVE FOR SOUTH TOMORROW
## Seven Leather-Pushers Will Fight U. C. Southern Branch Fighters 
### 
Coacli Harry Maloney's squad of
leather-pushers leaves tomorrow night
for Los Angeles where they are carded
to meet the Southern Branch boxers
Saturday night.
The men who will make the trip
are: Earl Armbruster, featherweight;
Elbert Harward, lightweight; Vincent
Martin, welterweight; Giles Hall, wel
terweight; "Jake" Irwin, middle
weight; Stuart Van Hook, light heavy
weight; Price Robinson, heavyweight;
Howard Bissell, manager, and Harry
Maloney, coach.
Brad Simmons, bantamweight, is
unable to make the trip so two welter
weights are being taken, following the
request of the Branch an extra
man be brought.
Cubs Have Good Record
In coming against the Cubs, Ma
loney is running into some stiff oppo
sition from the records of the south
erners. Their blue-ribbon event of the
season was the defeat of the Cali
fornia squad, 5 to 3, on March 27. The
entire program was a fast one and the
five Cub victories were comparatively
easy ones.
The Cubs also have to their credit a
former team captain of the northern
Blue and Gold institution, Jimmy
Cline, as coach. Cline, while at Berke
ley, held the welter and middleweight
championships of U. C.
Cards "Pointed"
Maloney, however, is not meeting
stiff opposition with a squad of un
conditioned, inexperienced men. It
has met with only one defeat this sea
son and the men are now in the pink
of condition, having been "pointed"
for some weeks for the Southern
Branch mixup.
At the head of the list stands Cap
tain "Jake" Irwin, an undefeated mid
dleweight. Irwin has never lost an
intercollegiate bout and has shown up
well this year, having won his first
Davis Farm bout by a clever exhibi
tion of boxing. He was sick with poi
son oak in the last Davis meet and
was unable to compete.
Armbruster Improved
Earl Armbruster was the possessor
of the Pacific Coast featherweight
championship this year until he lost
it in a mediocre fight with Burns
house, of Davis Farm, in the last
Aggie meet at Davis. Armbruster has
not been in his usual form this year
and as a consequence has not made
creditable or startling showings. His
aggressiveness has improved in the
past three weeks, however, and he
should be well able to take care of
himself Saturday.
Elbert Harward won his spurs as a
varsity regular by his good exhibi
tions in the university elimination
bouts held last quarter. His first
match was with Fisher of Davis Farm
whom he downed in the fourth round
of their bout in the first Aggie meet.
In the return tourney, Harward lost
by decision when he failed to put for
ward a good defense.
Martin Has Two K. O.'s
Vincent Martin, welterweight, al
though a new man on the varsity this
season, has succeeded twice in garner
ing a knockout over his opponent in
Davis Farm meets. His first sleep
producing effort was directed toward
Jensen of the Aggies who took the
count five seconds after the opening
bell in the first Davis meet. Martin'Â«
second knockout was dished out to
Captain Spillman of the Aggies in
the second Aggie tourney, this time
also after a few seconds of fighting.
Giles Hali has not been boxing this
season but chalked up an easy tech
nical K. O. over Fox of U. S. C. last
year. He fights in the welterweight
division and is a regular "fire-eater"
with plenty of speed and power in
both mitts.
Van Hook Clever
Stuart Van Hook has fought ir. only
one intercollegiate bout this year with
Kovecs of Davis Farm, but won it by
the referee's decision. He has an un
usual amount of speed for a liglitheavy
and this, coupled with clever foot
work and marked improvement of late,
makes him a dangerous opponent.
Price Robinson, heavyweight, is a
new fighter who has had only cue in
tercollegiate bout, but he possesses a
hard-hitting left and plenty of speed.
