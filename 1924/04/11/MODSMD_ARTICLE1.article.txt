# STANFORD TRACKMEN IN PINK OF SHAPE AFTER LONG REST
## Southern California Conference To Send Powerful Combination Against Redshirt Squad 
### Wallace Knox 
STANFORD'S tracksters will get into action tomorrow at 1:30 against the
Southern California conference, after a lay-off of two weeks.
The varsity men have been taking things easy for the last few days and
all of them are in tlie pink of condition to stop the invasion of the cream of
the Occidental, Pomona, Southern Branch, and Cal. Tech athletes.
Jim Arthur threw the discus 131 feet soon after his arrival on the track
oval. His return insures the Cards of additional points in the weight events.
Dick Richards is also doing better in the shot put, as he landed the cannon
ball on the 44-foot mark the other day.
Storie Will Not Run

Bill Storie will probably not compete tomorrow. "Dink" is not taking any
chances of having him hurt himself"
before the Big Meet. Storie has been
working out regularly, and will un
doubtedly be in shape to race against
the Bears.
An upset in the 880 is a possibility.
Bill Richardson is expected to place
first, as usual, but Norm Dole and Bill
Swavne have begun to get into mid
season form and are liable to beat
Mcintosh out. Mcintosh has been plac
ing second of the Stanford runners all
jyear.
The southerners are hoping for noth
ing better than a third in this event.
Ellsworth and Montgomery of Occi
dental will compete against the Stan
lord runners, but neither of them can
do much better than 2:00.
Must Do Six Feet in High
Hamilton and Hill of Pomona and
Argue and Bradshaw of Occidental
form a quartet of high calibre high
jumpers. Fred Anderson and Lou Kem
nitzer will have to do 0 feet to get a
place against them.
The pole vault tomorrow will give
Stanford sport followers an oppor
tunity to see if Phil Scofleld will be
•able to successfully fill Bill Black's
shoes.
Scofield vaulted 12 feet 6 inches ii\
the Olympic Club meet and tied "Red"
Norris for first place. Graham and
Goodenough consistently clear the bar
at 12 feet 5 inches and they can be
depended upon for this height tomor
row. If Scofield is able to defeat them,
it will be a safe bet that he will not
disappoint anyone in the Big Meet.
The visitors will have to work to
break into the scoring column in the
weight events. "Tiny" Hartranft is a
sure first place winner in both events,
and Arthur, Richards, "Scotchy"
Campbell, and Fred Ludeke stand a
good chance of garnering the rest of
the places.
220 Shouid Be Fast
One of the closest races of the meet
should be the 220-yard dash. Buckman
did 0:22 flat in the conference last
Aveek, and in doing so tied the confer
ence record. Lan Campbell did 0:21
7-10 in the U. S. C. meet, and will have
to do almost this well tomorrow if he
wants to beat the Occidental runner to
the tape.
Captain Nelson Van Judah and Ted
Miller will have to do their stuff in
the quarter to beat Powers and Spang
ler of Occidental. Spangler placed third
in this event last year. Powers can do
0:50 flat, and is the type of runner
who comes through best in competi
tion. If things go right the Stanford
runners should cover the distance in
less than 0:50, however, and if they do

so the Occidental stars will find them
selves bringing up the rear.«
Eaton Best in Javelin
Eaton of Pomona seems like a cinch
to win the javelin. He is credited with
a heave of 185 feet in the A. A. IT.
meet, and if he does this well tomor
row should not have much trouble in
winning. Harlow and Kelly will prob
ably do better than 165 feet, but this
can hardly come up to Eaton's dis
tances.
The southern tracksters are certain
of scoring in most of the events and
may come dangerously close to out
scoring the Redshirts, although it is
not considered that they have much of
a chance to win.

ler of Occidental. Spangler placed third
in this event last year. Powers can do
0:50 flat, and is the type of runner
who comes through best in competi
tion. If things go right the Stanford
runners should cover the distance in
less than 0:50, however, and if they do

so the Occidental stars will find them
selves bringing up the rear.«
Eaton Best in Javelin
Eaton of Pomona seems like a cinch
to win the javelin. He is credited with
a heave of 185 feet in the A. A. IT.
meet, and if he does this well tomor
row should not have much trouble in
winning. Harlow and Kelly will prob
ably do better than 165 feet, but this
can hardly come up to Eaton's dis
tances.
The southern tracksters are certain
of scoring in most of the events and
may come dangerously close to out
scoring the Redshirts, although it is
not considered that they have much of
a chance to win.
STANFORD'S tracksters will get into action tomorrow at 1:30 against the
Southern California conference, after a lay-off of two weeks.
The varsity men have been taking things easy for the last few days and
all of them are in tlie pink of condition to stop the invasion of the cream of
the Occidental, Pomona, Southern Branch, and Cal. Tech athletes.
Jim Arthur threw the discus 131 feet soon after his arrival on the track
oval. His return insures the Cards of additional points in the weight events.
Dick Richards is also doing better in the shot put, as he landed the cannon
ball on the 44-foot mark the other day.
Storie Will Not Run

Bill Storie will probably not compete tomorrow. "Dink" is not taking any
chances of having him hurt himself"
before the Big Meet. Storie has been
working out regularly, and will un
doubtedly be in shape to race against
the Bears.
An upset in the 880 is a possibility.
Bill Richardson is expected to place
first, as usual, but Norm Dole and Bill
Swavne have begun to get into mid
season form and are liable to beat
Mcintosh out. Mcintosh has been plac
ing second of the Stanford runners all
jyear.
The southerners are hoping for noth
ing better than a third in this event.
Ellsworth and Montgomery of Occi
dental will compete against the Stan
lord runners, but neither of them can
do much better than 2:00.
Must Do Six Feet in High
Hamilton and Hill of Pomona and
Argue and Bradshaw of Occidental
form a quartet of high calibre high
jumpers. Fred Anderson and Lou Kem
nitzer will have to do 0 feet to get a
place against them.
The pole vault tomorrow will give
Stanford sport followers an oppor
tunity to see if Phil Scofleld will be
•able to successfully fill Bill Black's
shoes.
Scofield vaulted 12 feet 6 inches ii\
the Olympic Club meet and tied "Red"
Norris for first place. Graham and
Goodenough consistently clear the bar
at 12 feet 5 inches and they can be
depended upon for this height tomor
row. If Scofield is able to defeat them,
it will be a safe bet that he will not
disappoint anyone in the Big Meet.
The visitors will have to work to
break into the scoring column in the
weight events. "Tiny" Hartranft is a
sure first place winner in both events,
and Arthur, Richards, "Scotchy"
Campbell, and Fred Ludeke stand a
good chance of garnering the rest of
the places.
220 Shouid Be Fast
One of the closest races of the meet
should be the 220-yard dash. Buckman
did 0:22 flat in the conference last
Aveek, and in doing so tied the confer
ence record. Lan Campbell did 0:21
7-10 in the U. S. C. meet, and will have
to do almost this well tomorrow if he
wants to beat the Occidental runner to
the tape.
Captain Nelson Van Judah and Ted
Miller will have to do their stuff in
the quarter to beat Powers and Spang
ler of Occidental. Spangler placed third
in this event last year. Powers can do
0:50 flat, and is the type of runner
who comes through best in competi
