### Wallace Knox 
STANFORD'S tracksters will get into action tomorrow at 1:30 against the
Southern California conference, after a lay-off of two weeks.
The varsity men have been taking things easy for the last few days and
all of them are in tlie pink of condition to stop the invasion of the cream of
the Occidental, Pomona, Southern Branch, and Cal. Tech athletes.
Jim Arthur threw the discus 131 feet soon after his arrival on the track
oval. His return insures the Cards of additional points in the weight events.
Dick Richards is also doing better in the shot put, as he landed the cannon
ball on the 44-foot mark the other day.
Storie Will Not Run

Bill Storie will probably not compete tomorrow. "Dink" is not taking any
chances of having him hurt himself"
before the Big Meet. Storie has been
working out regularly, and will un
doubtedly be in shape to race against
the Bears.
An upset in the 880 is a possibility.
Bill Richardson is expected to place
first, as usual, but Norm Dole and Bill
Swavne have begun to get into mid
season form and are liable to beat
Mcintosh out. Mcintosh has been plac
ing second of the Stanford runners all
jyear.
The southerners are hoping for noth
ing better than a third in this event.
Ellsworth and Montgomery of Occi
dental will compete against the Stan
lord runners, but neither of them can
do much better than 2:00.
Must Do Six Feet in High
Hamilton and Hill of Pomona and
Argue and Bradshaw of Occidental
form a quartet of high calibre high
jumpers. Fred Anderson and Lou Kem
nitzer will have to do 0 feet to get a
place against them.
The pole vault tomorrow will give
Stanford sport followers an oppor
tunity to see if Phil Scofleld will be
•able to successfully fill Bill Black's
shoes.
Scofield vaulted 12 feet 6 inches ii\
the Olympic Club meet and tied "Red"
