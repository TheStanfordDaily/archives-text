# BABES OPPOSE BRUIN SQUAD TOMORROW IN 15th CINDER CLASH
## Christie Has Well-Balanced Team; Spencer and West To Give Enos Good Race in Hurdle Events 
### Douglas Meservey 
STANFORD'S squad of babe tracksters meet the Bruin yearlings tomorrow on
the California oval at 1:30 p.m. in the 15tli annual intercollegiate freshman
track classic of the two institutions.
In UOb, 11 ainer Dad Moulton took his squad of nineteen young hopefuls
to Bei keley for the first Stanford-California freshman meet. They were
conceded an even chance; some even bet they would garner much more than
half the points, but the Blue and Gold squad of some fifty men proved too
strong and scored a 73% to 48% victory.
I 1 roni then until 1911 when there was an interval of four vears with no
meets, and fiom 191fj to 1923 the record books show one ditto after another —
ull jecoiding a California victory over a small Stanford squad armed with

<£11 few hopes and individual stars,
j The 1924 season for the 1927 track
aspirants began inauspieiously, even
discouragingly.
Yearlings Surprise
But later these same yearlings, who
handed the Bruin babe eleven a de
feat and surprise simultaneously,
chalked up another surprise by de
cisively downing a strong combination
of five teams from Chico high school,
Modesto high and junior college, and
Sacramento high and junior college,
on March 15, by an 84 to 33 score.
The same performance was accom
plished a week later against the Oak
land and Berkeley prep teams by a
; score of 70 y 2 to 50%.
Last Saturday, under ideal weather
j conditions but with only mediocre op
position, the freshmen scored their
third win of the season over eight
| combined teams of the Peninsula Ath
letic League, winning easily, 97 to 25.
Looking to the season's record of
the California freshmen, we find that
Walter Christie, track mentor, has de
veloped his usual strong combination
and one which has lost only one meet.
This defeat came last Saturday at the
hands of Modesto junior college and
San Francisco Lowell high school. It
has been rumored, however, that a (
number of California babes were not '■
entered in the meet due to the near-1
ness of the Stanford clash.
Hampton Clears Six Feet
Counting without these hidden per
formers, Christie has at present, as |
far as the public, knows, a number of
fast and capable men, which gives j
him at least au even chance of turn- ]
ing in a Bruin victory. Hampton |
cleared 6 feet 1 inch with apparent j
east in the Modesto-Lowell meet. In j
the hurdles Enos has been clocked at
25 flat in the lows, and 0:15 -1-5 in the
highs.
Schwalb has been reducing his times
in the century and furlong until he
now covers them in 0:10 1-10 and
0:22 5-10' respectively.
Christie's strength has always been i
shown in the number of second and |
third places he garners to the result- j
ing defeat of Stanford hopes. To op
pose him this year, Coach "Dink"
Templeton has a number of probable ,
first place men but as usual his sec- '
ond and third place strength is doubt-1
ful.
In the dashes, Babcock and Adams i
are a quite inseparable pair when it J
comes to finishing, although the for
mer's favorite is the furlong, while I
Adams breaks the tape around 0:10 1-5 j
in the 100. Babcock's times hover near j
0:22 4-5 for the 220. McDougall is j
usually counted upon for a third in
the prep meets.
Spencer Tries 440
Spencer, primarily a 220-yard hurd
ler, has been trying his hand at the :
quarter-mile under Templeton's direc- j
tions, both to groom him for the Olym
pic Games 3-foot 440-yard hurdles, and
to gain points in the quarter. He has
made 0:51 flat and might possibly do
better when pressed. Ogden and Rich
mann will help him out in the 440.
Spencer is the best bet in the low
sticks, being the present holder of the
interscholastic title. He has been doing
I around 0:25 3-5 this season but will
; undoubtedly be able to give Enos and
his 0:25 fiat a good race. Allen and
Wool have both followed Spencer to
the tape for places in recent prep
meets.
In West, Templeton has had a sure
first place in two events when com
peting with high schools. With the re
turn of Work, high jumper, to school.
West will probably concentrate his ef
forts on the high hurdles which he
covers around 0:15 flat. First place in
the high jump must now be conceded
to Work who clears six feet with ease,
i and second to West who has done 5
| feet 10 inches, with Richmann a pos
sible third.
The distances are the babes' vulner
able spot with Cummings the only
prospect that can do under 4:50 in the
mile, and with Ridley an unknown
quantity in the two-mile. Dekker, Cum
mings, and McCulloch have done
around 2:08 for the 880 with Mann
and Ogden the other entries.
Hoffman Ties Discus Mark
Hoffman proved himself quite a sen
sation recently when competing with
the Oakland schools by giving the dis
cus a ride of 137 feet 4 inches, tying
the Stanford-California record made
by Neufeldt last year. He also tosses
the 16-pound shot out for 42 feet. His
teammates in the two events are
Evans, Macabee, and Hoffelmier who
have recorded 35 feet in the shot and
120> for the discus.
Shipkey has shown consistent im
provement with the javelin until he
now gives it a heave of 160 feet usu
ally, with 166 his best mark. Anderson
follows with an occasional 160 and
I Toft'elmier with 155.
Meeks has been bothered with a bad
ankle throughout the season but came
within inches of tying the Stan
ford-California freshman broad jump
record last Saturday by clearing the
pit for 22 feet 1% inches. Knight Tern
pleon, West, and Somavia are con
sistent at 18 feet 9 inches.
Before the P. A. L. meet Saturday,
Templeton and Williams had failed to
show more than 10 feet 8 inches but
Williams cleared the bar at that time
for 11 feet with Templeton second. Mc-
Dermott's best in competition is 10
feet 6 inches.
