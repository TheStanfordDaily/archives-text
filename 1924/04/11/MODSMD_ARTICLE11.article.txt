STANFORD'S squad of babe tracksters meet the Bruin yearlings tomorrow on
the California oval at 1:30 p.m. in the 15tli annual intercollegiate freshman
track classic of the two institutions.
In UOb, 11 ainer Dad Moulton took his squad of nineteen young hopefuls
to Bei keley for the first Stanford-California freshman meet. They were
conceded an even chance; some even bet they would garner much more than
half the points, but the Blue and Gold squad of some fifty men proved too

on March 15, by an 84 to 33 score.
The same performance was accom
plished a week later against the Oak
land and Berkeley prep teams by a
; score of 70 y 2 to 50%.
Last Saturday, under ideal weather
j conditions but with only mediocre op

third win of the season over eight
| combined teams of the Peninsula Ath
letic League, winning easily, 97 to 25.
Looking to the season's record of
the California freshmen, we find that
Walter Christie, track mentor, has de
veloped his usual strong combination
and one which has lost only one meet.
This defeat came last Saturday at the
hands of Modesto junior college and
San Francisco Lowell high school. It
