# FRESHMEN OPPOSE BLUE AND GOLD IN TENNIS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Freshman tennis players will play !
their big match of the year at Berke
ley at 10:30 tomorrow morning. Both
teams are confident of victory and it '
seems probable that the event will be
won by not more than one match.
Cranston Holman, No. 1 man
for Stanford, is National Municipal
Champion and Junior Coast Cham- i
pion, and should be able to defeat
Stow, the best man on the California
team. Petty and Wise, the second and [
third men for Berkeley, are both near- '
ly as good as Stow, and at least one of |
them may be counted on to win his
match.
Kurihara, who will meet Petty, :
played second to Bettens, the captain
of this year's California varsity, for
two years at Lowell high school. The 1
third man for the frosh has not yet j
been picked, but will probably be
either Gardner or Newhouse. Both of
them are good players but lack ex- I
perience, especially in a big match
against stiff opposition. It is not yet
known what California men will play |
McCrea and Baer in the other singles, ;
if there are any, but Stanford should
take at least one of them, as the re- j
maining opponents are not nearly as :
strong as the first three.
In the doubles, Holman and Kuri- j
hara. will be a hard combination to
beat, not only because of their indi
vidual ability, but because of the ex
ceptionally good team work that they
have developed. Neither team has yet j
been picked for the other doubles but
California has a slightly better chance |
for victory.
The odds at present are slightly in
favor of Stanford, but the match will i
be close, and a slight upset would
throw the result either way.
