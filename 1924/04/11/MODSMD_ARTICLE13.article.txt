# DR. JORDAN TO TALK ON SCIENCE, RELIGION
## 
### 
Doctor Jordan will deliver the first
of his series of lectures on "Religion
and Science" in the Little Theatre to
morrow morning at 10 o'clock.
According to Dr. Jordan these lec
tures will be "an effort to show that
knowledge, reverence, and duty can
not stand in natural or permanent
opposition."
The lecture tomorrow morning will
deal with "The Scope of Science," and
one next week with "The Scope of
Religion."
The lectures will be conducted on a
discussion basis. Verbal questions will
not be answered as in a forum, but
written questions handed in will be
answered by Dr. Jordan at the follow
ing meeting, if they are of general
interest.
