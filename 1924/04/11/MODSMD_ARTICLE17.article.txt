# A 						Winning Track Team
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Temple ton's varsity track team enters its last preliminary
meet of the season tomorrow against the powerful All Southern Conference
aggregation.
Although the Cardinal tracksters are pointed at the Big Meet, April
26, a victory over the southerners will he highl-y desirable by way of re
venge for the defeat of last year. "Dink" Templeton has one of the
strongest and best balanced track teams in the United States today.
Given proper support, the Cardinal varsity, will undoubtedly be able
to turn the trick tomorrow. The southern team is strong and should olTer
plenty of opposition, but Templeton's aggregation of potential record
breakers is a hard one to beat.
It should not be necessary to urge students to turn out for the meet
tomorrow. Every man and woman in the university should take great
pride in such athletes as Hartranft, Hale, Campbell, Judah, Storey, Rich
ardson, Miller, Scofield, Anderson, Swayne, Macintosh, Elliott, Smith,
Charles; Kerr, Mcßae, and should grasp every opportunity to see them
in action. These men are only a few of the stellar performers that will be
seen in action against the southerners. Every man on the squad will be
out there working hard and they all deserve encouragement.
A good rooting section is practically essential to a winning team. Burt
Lapp will have his tryoutees on hand to give students an opportunity to
look them over, and there should be a good representation present.
The entire track squad should go into the Big Meet with the knowledge
that the student body, as a whole, is behind it. Tomorrow will be the stu
dent rooters' last chance to prove their confidence.
