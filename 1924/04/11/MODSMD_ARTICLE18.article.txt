Wednesday night, at Berkeley, a Stanford debater, for the third suc
cessive time, won the annual JolTre debate from the University of Cali
fornia representatives.
Robert Littler, who was the winner, is to be congratulated. The JofYre
debate requires long and intensive preparation. All the Stanford men
entered in the debate, as well as the coach, are to be commended on the
showing.
Although intercollegiate debating has never received a great deal of
support here, the Joffre contest is one which should be given a great deal
of attention. As long as debating is a recognized activity, it should be
supported.
