"California has the best tennis team
this year that she has ever had while
Stanford has merely a good team,"
says Captain Ted Mertz. The odds in
the match next Saturday are in favor
of California, but by no means far
enough to make a Stanford victory im
possible or even highly improbable.
The Berkeley team is composed of
Weinstein, Bettens, Chandler, and
Stratford. Weinstein played third man
last year and was easily beaten by
Mertz, but he has developed amazing
ly during the past year and is now the
best man on the squad.
Bettens, who is the second ranking
junior player of the country and hold
er of numerous other city, state, and
coast titles, defeated Hinckley. Chand
ler was captain of the 1926 freshman
team and won his match. Stratford
played in the doubles with Captain
Bates, winning from Mertz and Hinck
ley.
The players in the big match are
not picked by ranking order but by
their relative chances of defeating the
man who will probably be placed
against them. For this reason neither
team is willing to announce the order
of its players until the last possible
moment and there is always a chance
of a change immediately before the
match.
Hinckley and Mertz, after two years
of playing together, have worked up
a doubles combination that is likely
to handle the best pair California can
produce. Deßaek and Tussing are an
other powerful combination, and, on
paper at least, have the best chance
to win of any match of the day.
