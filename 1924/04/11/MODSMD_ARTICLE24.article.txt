# ATHLETES BATTLE FOR LEAD IN SEVEN INTERCLASS SPORTS
## Seniors and Freshmen Tied At Present Time; Are Best Bets to Win 
### Don Hines 
Interclass competition is part of the
program of intramural athletics, of
which C. W. Davis is director.
Seven sports are included in the
schedule. The class scoring the highest
on a point basis is declared champion,
and its numerals, together with those
of the class placing second, are en
graved on the interclass perpetual
trophy.
Last year the seniors, class of '23,
won with 27 points, five first and two
last places. This year the seniors,
class of '24, are tied with the fresh
men, with tennis and soccer yet to be
played.
The records for the last two years:
1922-23

The seniors generally make a strong
bid for honors, as holdovers are eligi
ble to play on their teams. This makes
a great difference, particularly in
those sports in which varsity men are
excluded from interclass competition.
Freshmen Make Strong Bid
Freshmen are always strong con
tenders for several reasons. The first
is that their teams contain the best
men in the class, since none are
barred by being on varsity squads. A
second is that their teams have pro
fessional coaching and are together
for long enough periods to develop
real teamwork. A further reason is
that they have practice games before
the interclass season.
Swimming, track, and tennis are the
sports that attract the greatest general
attention. Since the compeition is in
dividual, varsity men are allowed to
participate. Coming, as do the first
two, before the intercollegiate season,
they give the campus its first glimpse
of the coming varsity. For this reason
they are watched with great interest,
both by the local and the general pub
lic.
Irish Marathon Starts Track
As a part of the interclass track
meet is the Irish Marathon. It is gen
erally run a week before the meet, and
is made something of a gala occasion.
The marathon proper is a relay race
between the four classes, in which 24
men from each class take part, a total
of 96 men. After the marathon, three
legged races, and backward races are
staged, ending with a greased-pig
chase. Between races, the "holdover
show" is presented. This is usually a
satire on some phase of college affairs.
Two more sports, tennis and soccer,
are yet to be played this season. Last
year the seniors won at tennis with
such men as Neer, Davies, Tussing,
and Mertz on their team. Tussing and
Mertz are holdovers this year, and will
play for the present seniors. Two other j
varsity men, Hinckley and de Back,
will also play for '24. With these four
men, the seniors should take first
place in tennis. Overfelt, ranking var
sity player, is a junior.
The interclass tennis schedule this [
year provides for eight-man teams, to
be chosen by the class managers, j
Places oij the teams will be open to
challenge. The winning class will be
decided on a percentage basis of
matches won.
Interclass soccer was started last
quarter after the varsity season, but a
misunderstanding arose over some of
the games, and it was decided to play
the whole series over. Last year 1925
won at soccer, and it should repeat its
victory, with Rogers, Clark, Polland,
Cardoza, Off, Schoen, Quigley, and
Hoover playing on its team.
With the seniors having an edge in
tennis and the juniors in soccer, 1924
seems to be in a position to carry off
the season's honors. 1927 has strong
teams in both tennis and soccer, and
it is entirely possible for the first-year
men to walk away with the cup, or at
least tie with the seniors.
