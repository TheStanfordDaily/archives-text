# "Pop" Warner Takes Over Fate of Stanford Elevens; Kerr, Thornhill Lay Foundation
## 
### Walter Campbell 
In olden days, the ancient Greeks
felt that all their hopes and plans for
the future lay with three old witches,
known as the three Fates. But today,
as far as Stanford football is con
cerned, the three Fates have been dis
carded in favor of one kindly-faced,
grizzly veteran —"Pop" Warner.
When Warner was secured on a
contract a little more than two years
ago, critics began to see a great light
in the way of future Stanford football
elevens. "Pop," they said, meant win
ning teams. And they were right.
Two men, "Andy" Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill, both capable of turning out
strong elevens on their own hook,
were sent ahead to install the famous
Warner system until the Old Master
himself could come. Their job was to
build a solid basis for the future
elevens.
Kerr Does Well
The result of Kerr's term of head
coach was summed up in the 1924 var
sity. Although finishing but third in
the Pacific Coast conference, the Card
eleven was one of the most-feared and
most-discussed teams on the Coast. In
eight games the Cardinals rolled up
202 points as compared with 46 for
their opponents, and this includes the
two games which were lost.
Nevada was the first college team
to hook up with the Stanford machine.
The Wolves had a great reputation,
but they were buried under a 27-0
score. The game was full of fumbles,
something like twelve being regis
tered by the Cards alone. Nevers and
Campbell played outstanding games.
"Scotchy" proved himself a great cap
tain by showing his team what he
wanted them to do, instead of merely
calling on them to do it. This same
Nevada football team later held the
mighty California bears to a 0-0 tie.
Santa Clara Easy
Santa Clara proved to be only a
brief workout for the Redshirts, and
this time they rolled up a 55-6 total.
Almost every man on the squad was
given an opportunity to show his
wares. The playing of the line, espe
cially the ends, was nothing short of
marvelous. The linemen charged to

! gether like a unit, low and fast. Thorn
; hill's efforts had not been in vain.
Occidental college, a new team on
1 the schedule, was met in Los Angeles.
The southern eleven was light, but
fought hard in spite of it. Not forced
| to open up, the Cardinals romped
home on the long end of 42-0, despite
j numerous bobbles with the ball. Nor
man Cleaveland began to show the
speed and power which had caused
Brick Morse to name him as one of
the outstanding backs on the Coast
at the beginning of the season.
Blocked Punts Fatal
The next set-to, that with the Uni
persity of Southern California, proved
to be an entirely different affair. Four
blocked punts spelled two touchdowns
and a victory for U. S. C. Stanford's
single touchdown came as the result
of straight football, combined with the
uncanny skill of Captain Campbell at
quarter in calling the right plays. As
a unjt, the Cards outplayed their op
ponents, but a few rough "dges that
needed polishing gave the -southerners
their chance for a victory, and they
I were nothing loath to take it. Nevers
demonstrated the great force and driv
ing power which was to earn him a
place on Camp's All-American elevens.
Cards Come Back
On the following Saturday, Stanford
staged a decided comeback, and ran
through, over, and around the Olympic
eleven for a score of 40-7. The substi

tutes were again given a chance to
demonstrate what they had, and they
did it with a will.
In the second Conference game,
Stanford journeyed to Oregon and de
feated the University of Oregon in a
hard-fought affair, 14-3. The game,
played on a sawdust field, and in the
absence of several veterans, was a
slow affair. The Web-footers put up a
stiff defense, although they never chal
lenged to take the lead in scoring.
Idaho Turned Back
The week before the Big Game, the
Idaho Vandals invaded the campus
with one of the most discussed elevens
on the coast, but were turned back by
the Cards in a hard-fought 17-7 con
test. Idaho presented a well-rounded
passing offensive, but the Stanford
team kept the Vandals carefully under
cover at critical moments. Nevers
starred during his stay in the game,
and succeeded in outkicking Fitzke of
Idaho.
The Big Game lived up to its title,
although the Cardinals found them
selves on the short end of a 9-0' score
when the final gun went off. Nevers
alone made almost as many yards from
scrimmage as did the entire Bruin
backfield. Only the breaks gave Cali
fornia her touchdown and safety,
which meant victory. The game, play
ed in the new Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley, was attended by 75,000 spec
tators. Stanford's chance to win came

at the end of the first half, when the
ball was rushed almost the length of
the field, only to be stopped by the
half-time whistle.
Three on All-Coast Team
Stanford placed three men on the
all-coast grid team chosen by a chain
of United Press sporting editors in the
Pacific regions. Jim Lawson was
placed at end, Dick Faville at guard,
and Ernie Nevers at fullback. Cravens
barely missed out for one of the guard
positions.
On the all-coast teams picked by
George Davis, San Francisco sporting
authority, the Cards landed six men on
the three elevens. Campbell, Nevers,
and Cravens were placed on the first
string; Lawson and Faville made the
second choice; and Shipkey found a
place on the third eleven.
Such was the record of last season.
Next season can only speak for itself.

s However, most authorities grant Stan
f' ford one of the top positions in thtr
• Conference next your if not first place
itself. Coach Warner is now here to
stay. There are veterans to fill every
' , position, and reserve material is plen
i tiful. Such facts can not help but cause
optimism among followers of the
Cardinal.
Captain Lawson, Thomas, and Swan
at ends; Johnston and Shipkey at
tackles; Faville and Neill at guard;
Baker and Hunt at center; and Cleave
land, Nevers, Wheat, Dennis, Solo
mon, Lawson, Bogue, Garthwaite, Hy
land, and several others in the back
field, are enough to cause any coach
on the coast, including Mr. Andrew
1 Smith, to turn green with envy.

and succeeded in outkicking Fitzke of
Idaho.
The Big Game lived up to its title,
although the Cardinals found them
selves on the short end of a 9-0' score
when the final gun went off. Nevers
alone made almost as many yards from
scrimmage as did the entire Bruin
backfield. Only the breaks gave Cali
fornia her touchdown and safety,
which meant victory. The game, play
ed in the new Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley, was attended by 75,000 spec
tators. Stanford's chance to win came

at the end of the first half, when the
ball was rushed almost the length of
the field, only to be stopped by the
half-time whistle.
Three on All-Coast Team
Stanford placed three men on the
all-coast grid team chosen by a chain
of United Press sporting editors in the
Pacific regions. Jim Lawson was
placed at end, Dick Faville at guard,
and Ernie Nevers at fullback. Cravens
barely missed out for one of the guard
positions.
On the all-coast teams picked by
George Davis, San Francisco sporting
authority, the Cards landed six men on
the three elevens. Campbell, Nevers,
and Cravens were placed on the first
string; Lawson and Faville made the
second choice; and Shipkey found a
place on the third eleven.
Such was the record of last season.
Next season can only speak for itself.

s However, most authorities grant Stan
f' ford one of the top positions in thtr
• Conference next your if not first place
itself. Coach Warner is now here to
stay. There are veterans to fill every
' , position, and reserve material is plen
i tiful. Such facts can not help but cause
optimism among followers of the
Cardinal.
Captain Lawson, Thomas, and Swan
at ends; Johnston and Shipkey at
tackles; Faville and Neill at guard;
Baker and Hunt at center; and Cleave
land, Nevers, Wheat, Dennis, Solo
mon, Lawson, Bogue, Garthwaite, Hy
land, and several others in the back
field, are enough to cause any coach
on the coast, including Mr. Andrew
1 Smith, to turn green with envy.

In olden days, the ancient Greeks
felt that all their hopes and plans for
the future lay with three old witches,
known as the three Fates. But today,
as far as Stanford football is con
cerned, the three Fates have been dis
carded in favor of one kindly-faced,
grizzly veteran —"Pop" Warner.
When Warner was secured on a
contract a little more than two years
ago, critics began to see a great light
in the way of future Stanford football
elevens. "Pop," they said, meant win
ning teams. And they were right.
Two men, "Andy" Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill, both capable of turning out
strong elevens on their own hook,
were sent ahead to install the famous
Warner system until the Old Master
himself could come. Their job was to
build a solid basis for the future
elevens.
Kerr Does Well
The result of Kerr's term of head
coach was summed up in the 1924 var
sity. Although finishing but third in
the Pacific Coast conference, the Card
eleven was one of the most-feared and
most-discussed teams on the Coast. In
eight games the Cardinals rolled up
202 points as compared with 46 for
their opponents, and this includes the
two games which were lost.
Nevada was the first college team
to hook up with the Stanford machine.
The Wolves had a great reputation,
but they were buried under a 27-0
score. The game was full of fumbles,
something like twelve being regis
tered by the Cards alone. Nevers and
Campbell played outstanding games.
"Scotchy" proved himself a great cap
tain by showing his team what he
wanted them to do, instead of merely
calling on them to do it. This same
Nevada football team later held the
mighty California bears to a 0-0 tie.
Santa Clara Easy
Santa Clara proved to be only a
brief workout for the Redshirts, and
this time they rolled up a 55-6 total.
Almost every man on the squad was
given an opportunity to show his
wares. The playing of the line, espe
cially the ends, was nothing short of
marvelous. The linemen charged to

! gether like a unit, low and fast. Thorn
; hill's efforts had not been in vain.
Occidental college, a new team on
1 the schedule, was met in Los Angeles.
The southern eleven was light, but
fought hard in spite of it. Not forced
| to open up, the Cardinals romped
home on the long end of 42-0, despite
j numerous bobbles with the ball. Nor
man Cleaveland began to show the
speed and power which had caused
Brick Morse to name him as one of
the outstanding backs on the Coast
at the beginning of the season.
Blocked Punts Fatal
The next set-to, that with the Uni
persity of Southern California, proved
to be an entirely different affair. Four
blocked punts spelled two touchdowns
and a victory for U. S. C. Stanford's
single touchdown came as the result
of straight football, combined with the
uncanny skill of Captain Campbell at
quarter in calling the right plays. As
a unjt, the Cards outplayed their op
ponents, but a few rough "dges that
needed polishing gave the -southerners
their chance for a victory, and they
I were nothing loath to take it. Nevers
demonstrated the great force and driv
ing power which was to earn him a
place on Camp's All-American elevens.
Cards Come Back
On the following Saturday, Stanford
staged a decided comeback, and ran
through, over, and around the Olympic
eleven for a score of 40-7. The substi

tutes were again given a chance to
demonstrate what they had, and they
did it with a will.
In the second Conference game,
Stanford journeyed to Oregon and de
feated the University of Oregon in a
hard-fought affair, 14-3. The game,
played on a sawdust field, and in the
absence of several veterans, was a
slow affair. The Web-footers put up a
stiff defense, although they never chal
lenged to take the lead in scoring.
Idaho Turned Back
The week before the Big Game, the
Idaho Vandals invaded the campus
with one of the most discussed elevens
on the coast, but were turned back by
the Cards in a hard-fought 17-7 con
test. Idaho presented a well-rounded
passing offensive, but the Stanford
team kept the Vandals carefully under
cover at critical moments. Nevers
starred during his stay in the game,
and succeeded in outkicking Fitzke of
Idaho.

The southern eleven was light, but
fought hard in spite of it. Not forced
| to open up, the Cardinals romped
home on the long end of 42-0, despite
j numerous bobbles with the ball. Nor
man Cleaveland began to show the
speed and power which had caused
Brick Morse to name him as one of
the outstanding backs on the Coast
at the beginning of the season.
Blocked Punts Fatal
The next set-to, that with the Uni
persity of Southern California, proved
to be an entirely different affair. Four
blocked punts spelled two touchdowns
and a victory for U. S. C. Stanford's
single touchdown came as the result
of straight football, combined with the
uncanny skill of Captain Campbell at
quarter in calling the right plays. As
a unjt, the Cards outplayed their op
ponents, but a few rough "dges that
needed polishing gave the -southerners
their chance for a victory, and they
I were nothing loath to take it. Nevers
demonstrated the great force and driv
ing power which was to earn him a
place on Camp's All-American elevens.
Cards Come Back
On the following Saturday, Stanford
staged a decided comeback, and ran
through, over, and around the Olympic
eleven for a score of 40-7. The substi

tutes were again given a chance to
demonstrate what they had, and they
did it with a will.
In the second Conference game,
Stanford journeyed to Oregon and de
feated the University of Oregon in a
hard-fought affair, 14-3. The game,
played on a sawdust field, and in the
absence of several veterans, was a
slow affair. The Web-footers put up a
stiff defense, although they never chal
lenged to take the lead in scoring.
Idaho Turned Back
The week before the Big Game, the
Idaho Vandals invaded the campus
with one of the most discussed elevens
on the coast, but were turned back by
the Cards in a hard-fought 17-7 con
test. Idaho presented a well-rounded
passing offensive, but the Stanford
team kept the Vandals carefully under
cover at critical moments. Nevers
starred during his stay in the game,
and succeeded in outkicking Fitzke of
Idaho.
The Big Game lived up to its title,
although the Cardinals found them
selves on the short end of a 9-0' score
when the final gun went off. Nevers
alone made almost as many yards from
scrimmage as did the entire Bruin
backfield. Only the breaks gave Cali
fornia her touchdown and safety,
which meant victory. The game, play
ed in the new Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley, was attended by 75,000 spec
tators. Stanford's chance to win came

at the end of the first half, when the
ball was rushed almost the length of
the field, only to be stopped by the
half-time whistle.
Three on All-Coast Team
Stanford placed three men on the
all-coast grid team chosen by a chain
of United Press sporting editors in the
Pacific regions. Jim Lawson was
placed at end, Dick Faville at guard,
and Ernie Nevers at fullback. Cravens
barely missed out for one of the guard
positions.
On the all-coast teams picked by
George Davis, San Francisco sporting
authority, the Cards landed six men on
the three elevens. Campbell, Nevers,
and Cravens were placed on the first
string; Lawson and Faville made the
second choice; and Shipkey found a
place on the third eleven.
Such was the record of last season.
Next season can only speak for itself.

s However, most authorities grant Stan
f' ford one of the top positions in thtr
• Conference next your if not first place
itself. Coach Warner is now here to
stay. There are veterans to fill every
' , position, and reserve material is plen
i tiful. Such facts can not help but cause
optimism among followers of the
Cardinal.
Captain Lawson, Thomas, and Swan
at ends; Johnston and Shipkey at
tackles; Faville and Neill at guard;
Baker and Hunt at center; and Cleave
land, Nevers, Wheat, Dennis, Solo
mon, Lawson, Bogue, Garthwaite, Hy
land, and several others in the back
field, are enough to cause any coach
on the coast, including Mr. Andrew
1 Smith, to turn green with envy.

ment found in beef and eight times

In olden days, the ancient Greeks
felt that all their hopes and plans for
the future lay with three old witches,
known as the three Fates. But today,
as far as Stanford football is con
cerned, the three Fates have been dis
carded in favor of one kindly-faced,
grizzly veteran —"Pop" Warner.
When Warner was secured on a
contract a little more than two years
ago, critics began to see a great light
in the way of future Stanford football
elevens. "Pop," they said, meant win
ning teams. And they were right.
Two men, "Andy" Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill, both capable of turning out
strong elevens on their own hook,
were sent ahead to install the famous
Warner system until the Old Master
himself could come. Their job was to
build a solid basis for the future
elevens.
Kerr Does Well
The result of Kerr's term of head
coach was summed up in the 1924 var
sity. Although finishing but third in
the Pacific Coast conference, the Card
eleven was one of the most-feared and
most-discussed teams on the Coast. In
eight games the Cardinals rolled up
202 points as compared with 46 for
their opponents, and this includes the
two games which were lost.
Nevada was the first college team
to hook up with the Stanford machine.
The Wolves had a great reputation,
but they were buried under a 27-0
score. The game was full of fumbles,
something like twelve being regis
tered by the Cards alone. Nevers and
Campbell played outstanding games.
"Scotchy" proved himself a great cap
tain by showing his team what he
wanted them to do, instead of merely
calling on them to do it. This same
Nevada football team later held the
mighty California bears to a 0-0 tie.
Santa Clara Easy
Santa Clara proved to be only a
brief workout for the Redshirts, and
this time they rolled up a 55-6 total.
Almost every man on the squad was
given an opportunity to show his
wares. The playing of the line, espe
cially the ends, was nothing short of
marvelous. The linemen charged to

! gether like a unit, low and fast. Thorn

as far as Stanford football is con
cerned, the three Fates have been dis
carded in favor of one kindly-faced,
grizzly veteran —"Pop" Warner.
When Warner was secured on a
contract a little more than two years
ago, critics began to see a great light
in the way of future Stanford football
elevens. "Pop," they said, meant win
ning teams. And they were right.
Two men, "Andy" Kerr and "Tiny"
Thornhill, both capable of turning out
strong elevens on their own hook,
were sent ahead to install the famous
Warner system until the Old Master
himself could come. Their job was to
build a solid basis for the future
elevens.
Kerr Does Well
The result of Kerr's term of head
coach was summed up in the 1924 var
sity. Although finishing but third in
the Pacific Coast conference, the Card
eleven was one of the most-feared and
most-discussed teams on the Coast. In
eight games the Cardinals rolled up
202 points as compared with 46 for
their opponents, and this includes the
two games which were lost.
Nevada was the first college team
to hook up with the Stanford machine.
The Wolves had a great reputation,
but they were buried under a 27-0
score. The game was full of fumbles,
something like twelve being regis
tered by the Cards alone. Nevers and
Campbell played outstanding games.
"Scotchy" proved himself a great cap
tain by showing his team what he
wanted them to do, instead of merely
calling on them to do it. This same
Nevada football team later held the
mighty California bears to a 0-0 tie.
Santa Clara Easy
Santa Clara proved to be only a
brief workout for the Redshirts, and
this time they rolled up a 55-6 total.
Almost every man on the squad was
given an opportunity to show his
wares. The playing of the line, espe
cially the ends, was nothing short of
marvelous. The linemen charged to

! gether like a unit, low and fast. Thorn
; hill's efforts had not been in vain.
Occidental college, a new team on
1 the schedule, was met in Los Angeles.
The southern eleven was light, but
fought hard in spite of it. Not forced
| to open up, the Cardinals romped
home on the long end of 42-0, despite
j numerous bobbles with the ball. Nor
man Cleaveland began to show the
speed and power which had caused
Brick Morse to name him as one of
the outstanding backs on the Coast
at the beginning of the season.
Blocked Punts Fatal
The next set-to, that with the Uni
persity of Southern California, proved
to be an entirely different affair. Four
blocked punts spelled two touchdowns
and a victory for U. S. C. Stanford's
single touchdown came as the result
of straight football, combined with the
uncanny skill of Captain Campbell at
quarter in calling the right plays. As
a unjt, the Cards outplayed their op
ponents, but a few rough "dges that
needed polishing gave the -southerners
their chance for a victory, and they
I were nothing loath to take it. Nevers
demonstrated the great force and driv
ing power which was to earn him a
place on Camp's All-American elevens.
Cards Come Back
On the following Saturday, Stanford
staged a decided comeback, and ran
through, over, and around the Olympic
eleven for a score of 40-7. The substi

tutes were again given a chance to
demonstrate what they had, and they
did it with a will.
In the second Conference game,
Stanford journeyed to Oregon and de
feated the University of Oregon in a
hard-fought affair, 14-3. The game,
played on a sawdust field, and in the
absence of several veterans, was a
slow affair. The Web-footers put up a
stiff defense, although they never chal
lenged to take the lead in scoring.
Idaho Turned Back
The week before the Big Game, the
Idaho Vandals invaded the campus
with one of the most discussed elevens
on the coast, but were turned back by
the Cards in a hard-fought 17-7 con
test. Idaho presented a well-rounded
passing offensive, but the Stanford
team kept the Vandals carefully under
cover at critical moments. Nevers
starred during his stay in the game,
and succeeded in outkicking Fitzke of
Idaho.
The Big Game lived up to its title,
although the Cardinals found them
selves on the short end of a 9-0' score
when the final gun went off. Nevers
alone made almost as many yards from
scrimmage as did the entire Bruin
backfield. Only the breaks gave Cali
fornia her touchdown and safety,
which meant victory. The game, play
ed in the new Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley, was attended by 75,000 spec
tators. Stanford's chance to win came

at the end of the first half, when the
ball was rushed almost the length of
the field, only to be stopped by the
half-time whistle.
Three on All-Coast Team
Stanford placed three men on the
all-coast grid team chosen by a chain
of United Press sporting editors in the
Pacific regions. Jim Lawson was
placed at end, Dick Faville at guard,
and Ernie Nevers at fullback. Cravens
barely missed out for one of the guard
positions.
On the all-coast teams picked by
George Davis, San Francisco sporting
authority, the Cards landed six men on
the three elevens. Campbell, Nevers,
and Cravens were placed on the first
string; Lawson and Faville made the
second choice; and Shipkey found a
place on the third eleven.
Such was the record of last season.
Next season can only speak for itself.

s However, most authorities grant Stan
f' ford one of the top positions in thtr
• Conference next your if not first place
itself. Coach Warner is now here to
stay. There are veterans to fill every
' , position, and reserve material is plen
i tiful. Such facts can not help but cause
optimism among followers of the
Cardinal.
Captain Lawson, Thomas, and Swan
at ends; Johnston and Shipkey at
tackles; Faville and Neill at guard;
Baker and Hunt at center; and Cleave
land, Nevers, Wheat, Dennis, Solo
mon, Lawson, Bogue, Garthwaite, Hy
land, and several others in the back
field, are enough to cause any coach
on the coast, including Mr. Andrew
1 Smith, to turn green with envy.
