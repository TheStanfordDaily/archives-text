# Basketball Squad Will Need Running Guards Next Year
## 
### Ray Spangler 
"Next year's basketball team may
not be any stronger than this year's,"
says Andy Kerr, "but at least we will
have more competition for positions,
and more reserve strength."
Three veterans, Oliva, captain-elect,
Steele, and Nevers, will probably be
back in the fall. This leaves a forward
and a running guard position to be
filled from the ranks of the "pros
pects."
The 1927 freshman team has plenty
of varsity material. Either David or
Price could fill the forward berth. A
running guard is yet to be developed.
It was largely with the idea of de
veloping material that Coach Kerr in
augurated sprin basketball practice
last Monday. The men who are not
out for baseball, football, or track will
have an opportunity to learn the fun
damentals of basketball, which will
save time in the fall practice next
year. The regular basketball men have
had a rest, and are still in good con-

dition. The spring practice, supervised
by Kerr, but mainly under the direc
tion of Oliva, will give the 1926 varsity
a six weeks' start.
Lack of Reserves Felt
The 1924 varsity, although a good
working machine as a unit, lost power
when a first string man was taken out
of the game. It was largely because of
this lack of reserve strength that the
Cards lost to California. Next season
there will be David, Nevers, Price, and
others available at forward; Steele
and Jayred for center; Oliva at stand
in guard, with Newhouse on the side
lines if the captain's knee goes bad.
The Blue and Gold five will remain
practically intact next season. Kyte,
Ladar, Belasco, Carver, and Higgins
are all expected back next fall.
The loss of McHose at forward will
hamper the Stanford five until either
David or Price develops into a suitable
running mate for Nevers. The big Card
forward, handicapped by his size,
needs a fast, clever floor man to help
work the ball under the hoop.
Mcßurney, last year's vnd at run
ning guard, leaves the only place with
out ready material waiting for the posi
tion. Sid Williams may turn the trick
with a little development.

last Monday. The men who are not
out for baseball, football, or track will
have an opportunity to learn the fun
damentals of basketball, which will
save time in the fall practice next
year. The regular basketball men have
had a rest, and are still in good con-

dition. The spring practice, supervised
by Kerr, but mainly under the direc
tion of Oliva, will give the 1926 varsity
a six weeks' start.
Lack of Reserves Felt
The 1924 varsity, although a good
working machine as a unit, lost power
when a first string man was taken out
of the game. It was largely because of
this lack of reserve strength that the
Cards lost to California. Next season
there will be David, Nevers, Price, and
others available at forward; Steele
and Jayred for center; Oliva at stand
in guard, with Newhouse on the side
lines if the captain's knee goes bad.
The Blue and Gold five will remain
practically intact next season. Kyte,
Ladar, Belasco, Carver, and Higgins
are all expected back next fall.
The loss of McHose at forward will
hamper the Stanford five until either
David or Price develops into a suitable
running mate for Nevers. The big Card
forward, handicapped by his size,
needs a fast, clever floor man to help
work the ball under the hoop.
Mcßurney, last year's vnd at run
ning guard, leaves the only place with
out ready material waiting for the posi
tion. Sid Williams may turn the trick
with a little development.
