# CARD MERMEN ARE OUTSTANDING STARS OF COLLEGE SEASON
## Albert White and Wallace O'Connor Win National And Local Titles 
### 
With Ernst Brandsten as their
coach, Stanford swimmers have set
the pace for all schools or clubs on the
coast. With the exception of the Olym
pic Club-varsity water polo contest,
Brandsten's splashers kept a clean
record throughout the season.
Individually, the Cards have prob
ably the greatest collection of mer
men on the coast. Fletcher and O'Con
nor are coast champions, O'Connor is
a national intercollegiate champion,
A1 White is a national open champion
in two events, and Dave Fall is a na
tional junior champion. In addition to
these titles, several of the swimmers
are possessors of sectional titles in
the P. A. A.
Snice Brandsten came to Stanford,
California has been unable to defeat
the Cards in either swimming or water,
polo. This past season has been no ex- |
ception. Varsity and freshmen alike
administered double defeats to their
rivals from across the bay.
Bears Downed Easily
In the California water polo contest, '
the varsity had but little trouble in
snowing the Bruins under a one-sided
score. However, the real obstacle was
met later, in the form of the Olympic
Club seven. This latter contest was
for a purse to cover expenses to the
national tourney at Chicago.
The game against the Olympic Club
was a fast and furious one. Both
teams were just about on a par, with
neither having the slightest edge. A
foul keeping one Stanford man out
of the tank for the greater part of the
game, gave the Olympic secen a 5-3
victory, and the purse to Chicago.
Later, in the national tourney, the
Olympic Club took second place.
The playing of the seven men on
the team was outstanding during the
season. Six of the men, Fletcher,
O'Connor, McCallister, Schmieder, Col
lett, and Myers, played on the team
that took part in the nationals last
year. Allen, a star of last season's
freshman team, was the seventh play
er to win his award.
In the California swimming meet,
California did not have a chance for

victory. Every first place, and most of
the second places were won by Cardi-
nal swimmers. Men who won points
against California were: O'Connor,
Allen, Carlsmith, Wright, White, Mc-
Callister, Kreamer, Brown, Fullerton,
Rosenbaum, Hirschmann.
In open and sectional meets, the
Cards copped a number of titles. Dave
Fall, star freshman diver, won the
national junior low board diving cham
pionship at Los Angeles, defeating his
i teammate, Mike Gibbons, who holds
the Pacific Coast junior championship.
Wallace O'Connor, Stanford sopho
more, is now title-holder of the Pacific
Coast for the 220, 440, and 880-yard
swims. In the national intercollegiate
meet at New York recently, he an
nexed the 220- and 440-yard events,
swimming the latter in record-break
ing time. Charles Fletcher, former in
tercollegiate champion, had a poor
night and only took second in his
favorite event, the breast-stroke.
White Wins Two Titles
A1 White, besides winning numer
ous smaller titles, won the national
low and high springboard diving cham
pionships at Chicago last week, defeat
ing the best divers in the country.
This is White's second year as the
high board champion, having won the
title last year as vtell. To win this
event, he had to defeat his former
teammate, Clarence Pinkston, now
, diving for the Olympic Club.
The freshman swimming team was
one of the strongest in years. Besides
Fall in the diving, Doerr was outstand
ing in the 50-yard swim. Hanley in the
breast-stroke, Fletcher in the 220,
Brooks in the back-stroke, and New
house in the plunge, were also con
sistent point-winners throughout the
season.

Snice Brandsten came to Stanford,
California has been unable to defeat
the Cards in either swimming or water,
polo. This past season has been no ex- |
ception. Varsity and freshmen alike
administered double defeats to their
rivals from across the bay.
Bears Downed Easily
In the California water polo contest, '
the varsity had but little trouble in
snowing the Bruins under a one-sided
score. However, the real obstacle was
met later, in the form of the Olympic
Club seven. This latter contest was
for a purse to cover expenses to the
national tourney at Chicago.
The game against the Olympic Club
was a fast and furious one. Both
teams were just about on a par, with
neither having the slightest edge. A
foul keeping one Stanford man out
of the tank for the greater part of the
game, gave the Olympic secen a 5-3
victory, and the purse to Chicago.
Later, in the national tourney, the
Olympic Club took second place.
The playing of the seven men on
the team was outstanding during the
season. Six of the men, Fletcher,
O'Connor, McCallister, Schmieder, Col
lett, and Myers, played on the team
that took part in the nationals last
year. Allen, a star of last season's
freshman team, was the seventh play
er to win his award.
In the California swimming meet,
California did not have a chance for

victory. Every first place, and most of
the second places were won by Cardi-
nal swimmers. Men who won points
against California were: O'Connor,
Allen, Carlsmith, Wright, White, Mc-
Callister, Kreamer, Brown, Fullerton,
Rosenbaum, Hirschmann.
In open and sectional meets, the
Cards copped a number of titles. Dave
Fall, star freshman diver, won the
national junior low board diving cham
pionship at Los Angeles, defeating his
i teammate, Mike Gibbons, who holds
the Pacific Coast junior championship.
Wallace O'Connor, Stanford sopho
more, is now title-holder of the Pacific
Coast for the 220, 440, and 880-yard
swims. In the national intercollegiate
meet at New York recently, he an
nexed the 220- and 440-yard events,
swimming the latter in record-break
ing time. Charles Fletcher, former in
tercollegiate champion, had a poor
night and only took second in his
favorite event, the breast-stroke.
White Wins Two Titles
A1 White, besides winning numer
ous smaller titles, won the national
low and high springboard diving cham
pionships at Chicago last week, defeat
ing the best divers in the country.
This is White's second year as the
high board champion, having won the
title last year as vtell. To win this
event, he had to defeat his former
teammate, Clarence Pinkston, now
, diving for the Olympic Club.
The freshman swimming team was
one of the strongest in years. Besides
Fall in the diving, Doerr was outstand
ing in the 50-yard swim. Hanley in the
breast-stroke, Fletcher in the 220,
Brooks in the back-stroke, and New
house in the plunge, were also con
sistent point-winners throughout the
season.
With Ernst Brandsten as their
coach, Stanford swimmers have set
the pace for all schools or clubs on the
coast. With the exception of the Olym
pic Club-varsity water polo contest,
Brandsten's splashers kept a clean
record throughout the season.
Individually, the Cards have prob
ably the greatest collection of mer
men on the coast. Fletcher and O'Con
nor are coast champions, O'Connor is
