# INTRAMURAL SPORTS GAIN IN POPULARITY WITH MEN STUDENTS
## Statistics Show Very Decided Increase in Number of Participants 
### Don Hines 
Interest in intramural athletics is
increasing, if numbers of those par
ticipating gives any indication.
Cross country and basketball have
already been played, and the baseball
season opened this week. The figures
for these sports are: Basketball, 375
men in 38 teams last year against 400
men in 42 teams this year; baseball,
432 in 36 teams against about 450 in
38 teams.
The cross country figures are mis
leading. They record 27 entries in
1922 against 17 in 1923. In 1922 intra
mural cross country was run a week
after the meet, with California; con
sequently varsity men could enter.
This season the Intramural was run
in connection with the California meet
and the varsity men's places could not
count in the intramural. Thus the ac
tive interest is not shown by the
figures.
While an individual sport, cross
■country is run partly to help varsity
track men get into condition early.
Bob Cummings, freshman miler, won
this year. For two seasons, however,

El Campo has carried off the plaque
for the most points.
The intramural season begins in
earnest in the winter quarter with bas
ketball. The competing teams are di
vided into leagues of about six teams
each. Each team plays every other
team in its league, and the league
winners play In the same way for the
title, which carries with it a pennant.
The league winners all receive
plaques.
It is a curios fact that in the last
two seasons only two teams, Delta
Tau Delta and Beta Theta Pi, have
been league winners both times. Both
years these two teams have met in
the finals, and each has been victori
ous once, the Betas in 1923 and Delta
Tau this year.
Baseball Starts Monday
The baseball series started last Mon
day. Sigma Nu won in 1923, defeating
Sigma Alpha Epsilon in the final
game. Other league winners were El
Cuadro, Theta Xi, Alpha Delta Phi,
and Delta Upsilon. All these teams are
expected to make strong bids for the
1924 title.
Track is the next sport after base
ball. This year the intramural meet
will be held the week of May 12 to 16
inclusive. Events will include the hun
dred-yard dash, 120 low hurdles, 880-

In connection with the finals of the
meet, a relay carnival will be held,
each team being composed of eight
men. Varsity letter men are ineligible
lor intramural track competition.
El Toro won at track in 1923. Lou
Minsky, El Toro man, won individual
honors for the highest point score.
After El Toro, placed Kappa Sigma,
Sigma Nu, Breakers, and Phi Kappa
Psi.
Swimming was won last year for the

second time by Phi Delta Theta,
O'Connor and Fletcher doing most of
the scoring. Phi Kappa Psi placed sec
ond. There is a possibility that water
polo also may be played this year if
enough entries are obtained.
Besides these intergroup activities,
individual competition is arranged for.
Handball and tennis tournaments each
quarter attract larg-e numbers of en
tries. This year two new events were
staged. A basketball free-throw con
test, in which each man was allowed
15 tries, brought 187 entries. A pen
tathlon, consisting of the broad jump,
12-pound shot, running the hop, step,
and jump, baseball-throwing with each
arm. an dthe 75-yard dash, had 43 par
ticipants.

Dr. Victor Smith, an American liv
ing in London since 1903, has been
appointed surgeon dentist to the
Prince of Wales.

The sale of a stamp collection for
merly belonging to Wilhelin II netted
the entente powers almost 12,000,000
francs.

after the meet, with California; con
sequently varsity men could enter.
This season the Intramural was run
in connection with the California meet
and the varsity men's places could not

plaques.
It is a curios fact that in the last
two seasons only two teams, Delta

ous once, the Betas in 1923 and Delta
Tau this year.
