Year Successful
On the whole, the year has been a
successful one for women's athletics
! at Stanford. According to Eunice Bid
i die, president of the Women's Ath
. letic Association, more interest than
I usual has been displayed in the vari
ous sports, especially in basketball.
In hockey, the sport of fall quarter,
the senior team won its games against
Mills and California, while the sopho
mores lost. Only one upper and one
underclass team was entered. The
1924 squad was champion of the Inter
class race for the second time in its
history, having also won the title in
its sophomore year.
No Outside Hoop Games
During the winter, basketball held
the center of the stage. By a ruling of
the W. A. A. board, there was no out
side competition. Both first and second
team games were arranged and played
off, each squad having three games.
The final result was that the seniors
were again champions, with the fresh
men second. Accurate and swift pass
ing, as well as excellent teamwork,
were the outstanding traits of the
winning squads.
In the past, the policy of Stanford
has been to arrange the competitions
with other universities. However, the
tendency of the W. A. A. board at
present is to gradually reduce the
i number of outside games, preferring
I to have only one in each sport.
Fiesta Big Event
"The Legend of the Laurel," the
women's fiesta to be presented on May
3, is the big event of spring quarter.
It is an affair in which every woman
in the University is expected to take
an active part. W. A. A. is sponsoring
it, in the way of finances and or
ganization.
Because of the amount of time and
labor necessary to make the fiesta a
success, it was decided that no teams
should be coached for outside games.
Only individuals are to compete this
quarter.
California Forfeits Meet
I A triangular meet was planned for
j April 19, at California. Stanford was
to meet California in swimming and
Mills in archery. But the former de
faulted because of lack of interest in
the sport at California, and the Mills
tournament may be forfeited by Stan
ford because of the illness of the
| coach.
However, interclass swimming and
j track are still on the slate for spring,
j as well as tennis and archery. All of
j these competitions lead up to the
grand finale of Field Day.
Particularly important to those in
terested in this field is the Athletic
Conference of American College Wo
men, convening at the University of
California April 10 to 12. It is a na
tional convention, with delegates from
! all the states of the Union. Eunice
J Biddle and Margaret Watson, presi
dent an dsecretary of W. A. A., will
read papers at the conference.
