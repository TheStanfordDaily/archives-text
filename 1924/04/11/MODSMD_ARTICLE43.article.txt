# "Intramural Sport Great Thing" Says Football Mentor
## 
### 
"Intramural is a great thing. It's a
big problem to get everybody out for
some kind of athletics; and Stanford
is succeeding better than any other
college I know of."
In these words Glenn H. ("Pop")
Warner, Stanford football mentor, ex
pressed his opinion of intramural ath
letics as conducted at Stanford.
"Perhaps the climate here has some
thing to do with it, but in Stanford a
larger percentage of men are out for
sports than in any university I have
heard about.
"Besides developing the men physi
cally, intramural athletics is an im
portant factor. It gets men together in
friendly competition and so promotes
real college spirit.
"Varsity and intramural athletics
are supplementary. Intramural over
comes the criticism of specializing on
a few men, and varsity teams, which
sets kind of an ideal, are a big factor
in making intramural athletics go.
"It has been my observation that
having large numbers out for sports
tends strongly to increase support of
varsity teams. When men have had
experience in playing themselves, they
are much more intelligent and inter
ested spectators. They have to get out
and try to do things themselves before
they realize what skill and science are
necessary—it looks so easy when the
major athletes do it. '
"Many times, too, men come out for
intramural with very little experience
in a sport, and find, to their own and
their friends' surprise, that they are
good enough to make the varsity in a
year or two. Needless to say, such
finds do not meet with disapproval."
