# POLO STARTED AT STANFORD IN '19
## Activity Made First Class Minor Sport in 1923; Cards Hold Title 
### Donald Adams 
Polo has been included among the
sporting activities at Stanford for the
past five years. The competition was
introduced in 1919 following the World
War at the time when the Field Artil
lery Unit of the R. O. T. C. was estab
lished under the direction of Major
L. P. Collins, until last command
ant of the local organization. This
activity officially represented* Stan
ford in intercollegiate competition for
the first time in 1923 when it was
made a first class minor sport by ac
tion of the Board of Athletic Control.
Major Collins introduced the sport
in the winter of 1919 and continued to
coach the Cardinal teams until Cap
tain Charles E. Boyle, present polo
coach, took over the work in 1921.
Captain Boyle has had the work of
building up inexperienced players and
putting them in such a condition that
they were this year able to capture
the Intercollegiate Polo Championship
of the Pacific Coast and of the West
ern United States.
Polo is a sport which takes con
siderable time to train players for
competition and a coach is handi
capped by the fact that his players
have had no previous experience of
any kind before coming to college.
Captain Boyle is responsible for the
production of two players rated as the
best college poloists in the West.
Ralph and Otto Barby, who graduated

last quarter, started work oil the local
fields four years ago and have been
recognised as the best two players
ever turned out by any college on the
coast.
After years of building up a
foundation for a team, Captain Boyle
entered the Cardinal horsemen in a
regular schedule of contests with
other mallet teams for the first time
in 1921. This included four middle
class teams of the West which were
the 30th Infantry of San Francisco,
76th Field Artillery of Monterey, and
the San Mateo Cardinals. Although the
season was not a completely success
ful one for the Cardinals, evidence of
a rapid stride forward was made. Con
tinued progress has been made up to
the present time, this season being
the most successful in the history of
the activity at Stanford.
Stanford Holds Title
At the present time the local team
holds the title of championship of the
Pacific Coast by virtue of the defeat
autumn of the Oregon Agricul
ture College four. The Cards also
claim the championship of the West,
because of the failure of the Univer
sity of Arizona team, holders of the
championship of the Southwest, to ac
cept a challenge made this year by
Stanford. Possibility of a trip east for
the Cards for an intercollegiate East-
West game is being contemplated by
Captain Boyle.
In a tournament held at Stanford
during the past spring vacation, Stan
ford rated second place among the
teams of the middle class in Northern
California. Captain Boyle regards this

| rating as significant of an important
achievement. He believes that his ef
forts to train and bring interest in the
, sport are showing results.
With the present backing of the
| Board of Athletic Control and the
financial returns from the games dur
ing the past two years, the polo equip
ment has been greatly increased. Two
. large fields are maintained at the
! present time. The Highway field was
built in 1921 at a cost of over $3,000
and is considered one of the best ou
; the peninsula. The field east of En
| cina hall was the first used at Stan
j ford.
Men on the polo squad who, during
| the past season have been awarded
the Circle "S" for participation in con
tests, include Ralph and Otto Barby,
I John Irwin, Ralph Tremaine, and Eg
bert Laub.
Stanford men are favored for all three
placef.
Ross Only Miler
With A1 Smith, Bill Kerr, Elmer El
liott, and Pat Murphy running, Stan
ford has the edge in the mile. Ross is
California's best bet but he can hardly
be given a chance against Coach
"Dink" Templeton's crack milers.
In the two-mile Stanford is again
favored, although Jensen of California
may have improved enough by April
26 to give A1 Charles some competi
tion. Bill Kerr and Frank Hayes will
try to help the Card point column in
this race also.
Leistner is a better hurdler than
Becker of California, and he should
win both hurdle events. Becker did
0:15 4-5 in the highs in the Winged

Kelly have been throwing it around
165 feet, which will hardly be good for
a place. Neufeldt is about the best bet
that the Blue and Gold will have.
Scofield has vaulted 12 feet 6, which
should easily take first place. Dennis
and Whistler are not far behind him

but Upson and Coates must be con
sidered also for second and third
places.
Boren of California is choice to win
the broad jump as he can jump 22 feet
8 inches. Bondschu of California will
fight it out with Dick Mac√üae and
Bill Wright for the other places.
The high jump should be an inter
esting event. Witherspoon looks good
for the Bears although Fred Anderson
and Lou Kemnitzer must also be con
sidered. It will probably take more
than 6 feet to win this event.
Stanford should win the relay with
Storie, Miller, Judah, and Coverly.
California will probably be represent
ed by McMillan, Aggler, Goert, and
Hurst.
