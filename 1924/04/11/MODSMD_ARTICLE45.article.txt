# STANFORD FAVORITE TO WIN FROM BEARS IN ANNUAL BIG MEET
## Christie's Trackmen Show Increasing Power; May Spring Surprise 
### Wallace Knox 
Doping a Stanford-California track
meet is a very precarious task at best.
Walter Christie, California coach, has
a habit of starting the season with
little or nothing in the way of track
stars, but by the time of the annual
Big Meet he has a potential team.
Such seems to be the case this year.
Early in the season opinion was
current that Stanford would score a
decisive win over the Golden Bears.
No one could see a chance for Cali
fornia, but the Bears managed to nose
out the U. S. C. team nevertheless.
Then, last week the Olympic Club met
a crushing defeat at the hands of the
Blue and Gold. The score was
to 56M>.
Now that the big classic is but two
weeks off it is possible to. draw a
rough comparison of the two teams.
If the meet were to be tomorrow Stan
ford should win by a score of about
76 to 55. However, Christie's team is
developing with leaps and bounds and
by the time of the season's climax the
dope may point to an even closer
score.
Meets Will Change Dope
California meets Lllinois next week
and Stanford tangles with the South
ern Califorrfia conference tomorrow
and the performances made by the
different men in these two contests
will open a new field upon which to
compare the two teams.
Barber, sophomore sprinter at Cali
fornia, has been running the century
consistently in 0:09 9-10. Marshal Hale
of Stanford has not done better than
0:10 flat, and as a result Barber has
the best chance of winning the event
with Hale placing second. Third place
should be contested for by lan Camp
bell and Louie Gaspar of Stanford and
Shepard and Farnsworth of California.
Campbell holds the record in the
furlong and he is favored to repeat
his performance of last year and cop
this race in the Big Meet. Hale has '
not been tested in the 220 as yet and
so his ability in this distance is un
known. Accordingly, the California
sprinters are given the edge for the
second and third places.
Two Places in 440
Stanford should get at least two and
possibly three places in the quarter.
Bill Storie, Ted Miller, and Nelson
Van Judah form as fast a trio as any
one could ask for. Judah is fast round
ing into form and he may beat the
other two runners, although both of
them have been leading him so far.
Storie has been sick, which has great
ly handicapped his training. Miller is
running his first year for the varsity
and is undoubtedly the big "find" of
the year. Hurst of California is the
only dangerous runner Christie will
have. He has done less than 0:51 but

he will have to do less than 0:50 to
place against Stanford.
Richardson has things his own way
in the half, although it is in this event
that an upset is most likely to occur.
Norm Dole and Bill Swayne placed
first and second in the Big Meet last
year, and they are the two dark horses
again this year. Both of them are the
kind that plug along all season, doing
little sensational running, but saving
everything for the Big Meet. Mcintosh
can also be counted upon for points.
Chace, of California, ran 1:59 3-5
against the Olympic Club, and if he
continues to improve he may be good
for a place, although at present the

I "O" meet and came second in the
lows. Ball and Crowley have both been
going well and they may nose Hal
Boles out for the third place.
"Tiny" Hartranft can be depended
upon in the weight events. His chief
opposition will come from Neufeldt.
The California star did 139 feet 6 in
the discus and 47 feet in the shot
against the club team. These marks
I can hardly compare with "Tiny's" 154
t feet 4 in the discus and 49 feet 8 in
the shot. Lang of California looks like
a third-place winner in both events.
Bears Have Javelin
Right now Stanford looks like a
total loss in the javelin. Harlow and
