# CARD TENNIS TEAM LEAVES IN JUNE TO TOUR AUSTRALIA
## Entire Trip to Be Longest Ever Attempted by Stanford Team 
### Ted Achilles 
"The tennis team's trip to Australia
this summer will be the longest trip
ever taken by any university team,"
says Harry Maloney, who will have
charge of the men. "It will be the first
of many such trips and will be of
great value in establishing permanent
athletic relations between the univer
sities of California and Australia."
This tour is unquestionably an
epoch-marking event in Stanford's his
tory. A Stanford rugby team went to
Australia in 1912, but it merely went
to Sydney and did not make an ex
tended tour of the continent as is
being done this year.
Play at Ojai April 24
After the California match which
comes on April 19 at Berkeley, Stan
ford will play the Southern Branch,
University of California, at Stanford,
on April 22. The team will then go
south for the annual turnament at
Ojai on April 24, which is the last
event on the present schedule.
From then until June 18 when they
embark, the men will k>eep in condi
tion by playing among themselves and
engaging in several exhibition matches
which have not yet been arranged.
They will arrive in Australia on July
12, and the schedule from then until
they sail for America on September 10
is as follows:
July 18, 19 —Australian Universities
at Sydney.
July 25, 26 —Melbourne University
at Melbourne.
August 1, 2 —Melbourne Metropoli
tan Team at Melbourne.
August 9 —Adelaide at Adelaide.

August 15, 16 —New South Wales
State Team at Sydney.
August 22, 23 —Australian Universi
ties at Sydney (2nd test).
August 29, 30 —Combined American
and Australian Universities xs. Au
stralia at Sydney.
September 5, 6 —Australian Univer
sities at Sydney (3rd test).
The men from whom the team will
be chosen are Overfelt, Mertz, Hinck
ley, deßach, and Tussing. Overfelt is
a new star who has recently become
the leading player at Stanford. Cap
tain Ted Mertz has been improving
steadily since he came to college and
is one of the best collegiate players to
be found on the Pacific Coast.
Hinckley Is Playing
Dick Hinckley, captain of last year's
varsity, is now turning in his usual
good games. "Nim" deßack was an
other member of the varsity last year,
and plays an excellent game. Ford
Tussing, winner in his match against
California, can also be counted on for
a consistently good match,
"Snowy" Baker, motion picture di
rector and actor, has been largely in
fluential in arranging the tour. He is
an enthusiastic sportsman, having
held the middleweight, light-heavy
weight, and heavyweight boxing cham
pionships of Australia. He is also part
owner of the great new Sydney sta
dium.
Though an Australian by birth, he is
now living in Los Angeles and is a
great friend of Stanford athletes. For
several years he has endeavored to
arrange an Australian trip for the
Stanford boxing team, which should
be accomplished in the summer of
1925. He hopes to establish a regular
interchange of visits from teams of
both countries in as many different
sports as possible.
The Australian Universities Sports
Association extended the invitation to
the tennis team.

A drive to exterminate squirrels
will be conducted this month in the
vicinity of Turlock and Delhi, it has
been announced recently.
