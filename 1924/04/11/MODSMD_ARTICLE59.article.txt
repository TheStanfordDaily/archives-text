# Dr. Jordan Says Human Experience Is Science
## 
### 
"All science is human experience; we
don't know anything till we find it out,"
said Dr. Jordan last evening in his lec-j
ture on "Scences, Exact and Inexact." !
"Exact science deals with quantity, j
distance, and weight, while inexact'
science deals with all the qualities living
things have -which lire always different
and changing. Both deal with evolution
in a way, for evolution is orderly
change.
"No science is exactly exact, for they
all move on the broad theory of trial and ;
error. All science deals, in the first
place, with conduct of life, that is, it :
tells what has been found out and its
final test is, can you live through it?
"Mathematics has been called the
queen of the sciences, but it is not a
science at all, but an instrument of
science. All history, psychology and
economics belong to the inexact scences.
\vh,ile chemistry is not quite an exact
science, for it deals with living tilings. '
It deals with lite which is subject to
evolution. Those who can run the
gauntlet of life and survive leave the
others behind them."
