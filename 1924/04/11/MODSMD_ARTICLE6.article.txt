### Paul Wayte 
Stanford yearlings meet the Cali
fornia cubs at 2 o'clock tomorrow on
the home field in the first game of the
annual Little Big series. The freshmen
will be represented by the strongest
nine that has donned the first-year
suits in several seasons, and should
put up a strong argument for this
year's title.
During the preliminary season the
Cardinal youngsters have succeeded in
winning 15 out of 17 games. These
practice tilts give the freshmen a total
of 140 runs against tlie 60 high schools
chalked up by opposing teams which
included various high schools in the
central and northern part of the state
and the University of California Den
tal College.
Cubs Strong in Past
A survey of the summary of the an
nual records shows that freshman
baseball in past years has been rather
unsuccessful. Since the first contest
played in 1916 the Stanford freshmen
have succeeded in winning only one
series, which was won in the yea&
1922 by the freshman class of '25. In
1919 the freshmen started out with
bright prospects and after dividing
two games with the cubs went all to
pieces in the third game and were
smothered by a 21 to fr defeat.

Coach "Husky" Hunt has guided two
freshman major sport teams to victory
this year an dthe babe nine feels con
fident that his directions are prepar
ing them for a third victory for the
class of '27.
When the game is called tomorrow
Hunt will have four good pitchers
ready to face the Bear youngsters.
Collins, Osthause, Hunter, and Reese.
Collins is apparently the favorite to
start tomorrow's contest since he has
struck out the greatest number of men
and held his opponents to smaller
scores.
Batteries Look Good
Ostliaus is a strong pitcher and has
made a very creditable showing since
the start of the season. Having been
used more than any other pitcher, his
experience should prove a valuable
asset if he enters the box against the
cubs tomorrow. Hunter and Riese have
not worked much, but both have
shown themselves capable and de
pendent in a pinch.
Baillard, Stewart, and Scherer are
' all first-class catchers, and will give
Coach Hunt no worry concerning the
receiving end of tlve battery.
Mackersie, by his brilliant work on
the initial sack, seems to have won a
permanent berth at that position.
David and Linquist are still fighting
for the second corner while South
worth at shortstop and Morrill at third
seem to have a field clear of com
petitors.
Freshmen in Good Form
The freshmen seemed to have de
veloped to top form during their va
cation tour in the central part of the
state when they succeeded in winning
three straight games, from Visalia,
Hanford, and Dinuba high schools.
During the Hanford game they were
pressed hard for twelve innings but
finally succeeded in putting over the
final run with a triple and single.
In the first game of the year before
they had become fully organized the
babes lost to San Mateo high school,
and on March 1 they dropped another
game by a 5 to 3 score when they
struck an off-day. Outside of these two
games the yearlings have always been
on top in the final inning, usually with
a comfortable margin.

the initial sack, seems to have won a
permanent berth at that position.
David and Linquist are still fighting
for the second corner while South
worth at shortstop and Morrill at third
seem to have a field clear of com

Freshmen in Good Form
The freshmen seemed to have de
veloped to top form during their va
cation tour in the central part of the
state when they succeeded in winning
three straight games, from Visalia,
Hanford, and Dinuba high schools.
During the Hanford game they were
pressed hard for twelve innings but
finally succeeded in putting over the
final run with a triple and single.
In the first game of the year before
they had become fully organized the
babes lost to San Mateo high school,
and on March 1 they dropped another
game by a 5 to 3 score when they
struck an off-day. Outside of these two
games the yearlings have always been
on top in the final inning, usually with
a comfortable margin.
Stanford yearlings meet the Cali
fornia cubs at 2 o'clock tomorrow on
the home field in the first game of the
annual Little Big series. The freshmen
will be represented by the strongest
nine that has donned the first-year
suits in several seasons, and should
put up a strong argument for this
year's title.
During the preliminary season the
Cardinal youngsters have succeeded in
winning 15 out of 17 games. These
practice tilts give the freshmen a total
of 140 runs against tlie 60 high schools
chalked up by opposing teams which
included various high schools in the
central and northern part of the state
and the University of California Den
tal College.
Cubs Strong in Past
A survey of the summary of the an
nual records shows that freshman
baseball in past years has been rather
unsuccessful. Since the first contest
played in 1916 the Stanford freshmen
have succeeded in winning only one
series, which was won in the yea&
1922 by the freshman class of '25. In
1919 the freshmen started out with
bright prospects and after dividing
two games with the cubs went all to
pieces in the third game and were
smothered by a 21 to fr defeat.

Coach "Husky" Hunt has guided two

this year an dthe babe nine feels con

When the game is called tomorrow
Hunt will have four good pitchers
ready to face the Bear youngsters.
Collins, Osthause, Hunter, and Reese.
Collins is apparently the favorite to
start tomorrow's contest since he has
struck out the greatest number of men
and held his opponents to smaller
scores.
Batteries Look Good
Ostliaus is a strong pitcher and has
made a very creditable showing since
the start of the season. Having been
used more than any other pitcher, his
experience should prove a valuable
asset if he enters the box against the
cubs tomorrow. Hunter and Riese have
not worked much, but both have
shown themselves capable and de

Baillard, Stewart, and Scherer are
' all first-class catchers, and will give
Coach Hunt no worry concerning the
