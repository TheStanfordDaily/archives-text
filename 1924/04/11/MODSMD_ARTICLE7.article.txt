# CARDS MEET BEARS IN OPENING DIAMOND CLASH ON U. C. FIELD
## Team With Best Moundsmen Should Win; Odds Are Even on Series 
### 
"Give us good pitching and we'll hand
the Bears a beating in the first game
of the series."
So Harry Wolter, coach of the Card
baseball varsity, expressed himself as
| to the probable outcome of the Stan
: ford-California diamond contest which
will be played on the Berkeley field
i tomorrow afternoon.
Since it seems likely that the class
of hurling will decide the winner,
Wolter plans to start Ernie Nevers in
the box. Nevers has developed into
I one of the most dependable of the
| Stanford flingers and will use every
| thing he possesses in an effort to beat
j the Bears. If Nevers should falter,
Solomon will be Coach Wolter's see
! ond choice for the mound work,
j Chuck Johnston will start behind
the bat in the opening game. Johnston
has been playing fine ball all year,
and has worked in the outfield, on first
base, and as catcher. His home-run
clout in the final Santa Clara game is
a sample of the sort of slugging he
has been doing all year. #
Mulchay Back on Short
The Card infield will be the same
that worked together in all the early
season games. Mult-hay, who had been
out for some time, went in in the fifth
inning of the last Bronc game at his
old position of shortstop, and will be
seen there in the contest against the
Blue and Gold. Captain "Bud" Wood
ward on first, "Shorty" Roberts on
second, and Cuddeback on third, are
the other in fielders.
This combination has played fairly
airtight ball all season and should cut
off a lot of hits.
In the outer gardens, Fuller in left,
May in center, and McCandless in
right, will take care of any balls that
get past the infield.
Stanford's Percentage of Wins High
The Cardinals have had a strenuous
schedule this year and have come
through with a goodly percentage of
wins. Against semi-pro teams, a record
of nine straight triumphs was re
corded.
St. Mary's split even with Stanford
in a two-game series, and Santa Clara
lost two out of three to the Cards.
Against the Trojans, Coach Wol
ter's club did not fare so well. Stan
ford took the first contest, which was
played here, by a score of 6 to 5. In
the south, U. S. C. came back and
captured two games and the series.
The big trouble in these games was
the lack of quality in the pitching.
The Trojan sluggers got to the Stan
lord hurler in the first innings of each
contest and piled up a lead too big to
overcome.
Since returning from Southern Cali
fornia the varsity has played improved
ball and will go into the California
series on an even basis with the Bears.
