### Douglas Meservey 
STANFORD'S 1923-1924 intercollegiate boxing season ends tomorrow night
when Coach Harry Maloney's squad of leather-pushers meets the Southern
Branch fighters at Los Angeles. The Card boxers have passed through a !
fairly successful season, winning one intercollegiate meet and losing the '
other by a close margin.
Circus Uncovers Material
A three-ring circus. February S, opened the season for Maloney's proteges
and brought to light a number of varsity prospects. Martin, who makes the
trip tonight to Los Angeles as a welterweight, was discovered by his fine
showing in these bouts. Tull, who scored a knockout in the first Davis Farm
meet, is also a product of the circus. 3>— —

Stanford won 5 to 1 in the first
round of bouts with the California
Aggies which were held at Stanford,
February 15. Two knockouts were
dished out to Davis fighters by Card
boxers —Martin and Tull.
Captain Irwin Is Fast
Captain "Jake" Irwin won his en
gagement in a fast bout and Harward
and Van Hook were given referee's
decisions over their opponents.
A return meet was staged at Davis
on March 7 but the Cards did not fare
so well, losing 5 to 2. Irwin and Van
llook were unable to fight, due to
sickness.

Stanford men to win their tights, Mar-
tin garnering another knockout over

the judges' decision after a strong
comeback in the second and third
rounds.
